ArcherFX,3e0x1s,MineDogger,60,Tue Jul 21 14:06:12 2015 UTC,"Live action Archer? Can't be done.  I see a lot of people citing the animation as the crucial element, but don't forget, the show is an evolution of the crappy flash animation of Frisky Dingo. It wasn't the animation as much as it was the madness and genius of the shows creators and voice talent. You could make a live action archer look right, you could have the same writers, but there's one thing you can't have in a live action Archer... Jon Benjamin. And that, my friends, is what you call a dealbreaker. Chris Parnell and the girls could totally pull it off tho.  On second thought, if they let Benjamin dub over this guys lines I'll watch this abomination..."

A good hairpiece and some really subtle prosthetics might help, if it looks right. But then you've either got to come up with some really convincing ice blue contacts, or just deal with a green eyed Archer.  Chris Parnell actually looks quite a bit like Cyril, Jessica Walter is a good match for Mallory, Cheryl, (Carol?) Looks exactly like her voice actor, pretty sure no one would mind Amber Nash looking a bit smaller than Pam, and then we start to enter weirdspace... We have to deal with Roy having the voice of Krieger..."

It would be like the proposed Cowboy Beebop live action remake, it misses the point that the animation is a major reason the show is great.  The animation in Archer is some of the best work I've ever seen and the animators are unsung heroes of the cast. To do it live action would be trying to make a great burger without using meat.  But all that said, yeah Cavill looks like a good cosplay of Archer there."

ArcherFX,3e0x1s,Soddington,2,Tue Jul 21 08:23:28 2015 UTC,"What do you think makes the animation so good? Personally I thought it was a bit lax in the first two seasons but from then on it did the job fine enough. Still, I don't see why it's particularly noteworthy amongst all other western cartoons. Not trying to be snarky just curious as to why you think so.   And I definitely think CB could be done in live action. The animation is phenomenal and was some of the best of it's day, but it's style could easily be replicated for live action without a doubt. It's a very cinematic show by itself so I think it would lend very well to the big screen."
ArcherFX,3e0x1s,Shoreyo,13,Tue Jul 21 07:32:25 2015 UTC,"I think the animation and its pallet choice makes a whole alternate world beautiful and believable. the characters, props and backgrounds are wonderfully detailed and together you get a world that is all its own. I just love the aesthetic of the show.  To me I find live action versions of animation with very few exceptions to be poor pale imitations. Take 'Aeon Flux', a very highly stylistic cartoon that totally failed to impress as a live action movie. I can't actually think of a successful animation turned live action, but surely there must be at least one. But for iconic anime like Cowboy and Akira or Ghost in the Shell any talk of doing it as live action just begs the question, 'Whats the point?'  Really I think its all down to respecting the art form of animation. Western animation is usually considered childish and its relegated to brightly coloured kids shows. Its a pleasant departure from that to have some animation aimed at Adult tastes. South parks animation is extremely crude, to the point its almost a parody of animation, but thats where its charm comes from.  Really its like asking, 'whats so special about that oil painting? I've got this 1080p camera and its gunna be so much clearer.' The high def camera is great, but its no guarantee it will make art.  Maybe I'm just a wanker. Maybe I'm being precious, but if someones doing a reboot of a property, I'd like it to be for a better reason than, 'because theres a market for it.'"

Double Deuce remains my absolute favorite Archer episode of all time (and I'm not saying it because of Coe's passing -- it'll still be my favorite , and it's 99% because of Woodhouse and George Coe's ability to make you actually forget that it's a fictional character.  It really sounds like a man genuinely talking about his lost love in a documentary (or historical documents). Both George Coe and the younger actor were fantastic.  I laughed so hard at the ""Reggie!!!!......."" desperate and sad cry into the void as a young, long-haired and naked Woodhouse was toking while covered with 2 Asian whores.   It's also the only episode where he we see him stand up to Archer, though the latter ends up forgetting it.   It was such a well-told story/episode, and it's the only Woodhouse-centric episode, unfortunately.   But George Coe really sells his character's story in Double Deuce, and I never for even a millisecond think that it's an animated character talking about a fictional lover.  George Coe does SUCH a good job that it sounds like documentary of someone legitimately talking about a lost love.  TLDR - Rest in peace, George Coe. You literally were the reason for my favorite Archer episode ever. Hope you find Reggie!!!!!...... So, Double Deuce remains personal favorite episode, while Skytanic is a close second. Double Deuce has probably the best start to finish story in one episode, in my opinion, and is also the funniest from start to finish for me....while Skytanic is the most well-balanced episode, as it somehow manages to exhibit the personality, role, and type of humor of every single character. Seriously, if you think about what the characters say or do in the episode, it's THE PERFECT episode to showcase all the characters and all you need to watch to know them, which is why Skytanic is the #1 episode that I recommend to friends who haven't watched it yet....and apparently it's a popular opinion and thing to do among people online and my real life friends."

Malory turns around and clears her throat. Then again. And as she does it again Lana interrupts  Lana: Ya' gonna say something?   Malory: What about me? I'm his mother!  Lana: And what a brilliant job you've done on that. Quick question though, roughly how many hours per day did you spend with him as a child?  Malory: HOUR PER DAY??? What am I? A daycare?

ArcherFX,3dsw6c,sambob,9,Sun Jul 19 13:56:49 2015 UTC,I was talking about the character in family guy having the same voice actor as archer and bob. I think by this point most people will already know that bob and archer are the same voice actor.

ArcherFX,3drsd6,Iokuas,5,Sun Jul 19 23:19:47 2015 UTC,"Because Krieger never said he was a clone of Edmund Burke?   He says the whole 'The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing' line, then Mallory says something like 'Says the clone of Adolf Hitler!' to which Kreiger replies 'Well, Edmund Burke actually'.   He's was just pointing out to Mallory who the quote was from."
ArcherFX,3drsd6,WildBizzy,4,Mon Jul 20 01:10:39 2015 UTC,"No, you are all wrong. the quote that he says is from edmund burke, so when malory says ""says the clone of Hitler"", Kreiger is talking about the quote, not himself"

ArcherFX,3drsd6,BridgetheDivide,12,Sat Jul 18 21:42:42 2015 UTC,"I think he just has some memory problems from his fall during the struggle with his clone bros. He wanted to stop the missile and still tried to, the clones very much wanted it to go and kill all those people. He had no incentive to stay and stop it if he was one of the clones. The clone would have just walked away and let it happen."
ArcherFX,3drsd6,hartmandietrich,10,Sat Jul 18 22:43:26 2015 UTC,"Well, if he was a clone, it makes zero sense he went from wanting to launch the nerve gas missile to trying to stop it once all opposition was removed at the end of Vice.  It could be the brain damage I guess."
ArcherFX,3drsd6,blackmarketdolphins,2,Sun Jul 19 00:09:15 2015 UTC,He could have realized that his other clones were all dead and therefore the life he had before was gone. It would make sense then that he would make any effort he could to convince the ISIS team that he was on their side so that they would accept him and allow him to slide into old Krieger's place.

ArcherFX,3drsd6,the_simurgh,13,Sun Jul 19 00:52:45 2015 UTC,season six alludes to him being alive and that all the clones are taking turns coming into work
ArcherFX,3drsd6,Sciencedragon,6,Sun Jul 19 03:49:47 2015 UTC,it's just a theory i have based on the evidence available. the he's not the original hints.. and then the aliens at roswell calling him by his name proving that in that episode he was the real kriger

ArcherFX,3drsd6,NoMoreNicksLeft,3,Sun Jul 19 02:22:58 2015 UTC,I think it's very possible that due to being a clone from the beginning AND the concussion that even Krieger doesn't know.
ArcherFX,3drsd6,NoxiousDogCloud,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:31:31 2015 UTC,"Even if it's not the original Krieger, that doesn't mean Krieger's dead.   Hopefully he returns to reclaim his place at not-ISIS-anymore."

ArcherFX,3drsd6,QuantumHoneybees,18,Sun Jul 19 08:33:43 2015 UTC,He's worn that tie since season one and swapped for that ep
ArcherFX,3drsd6,hotblondeboob,-2,Sat Jul 18 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, but in that particular episode, the tie is a way for us to tell which one is the real krieger. I'm with /u/scootter82 on this one!"
ArcherFX,3drsd6,Siddny-,7,Sat Jul 18 23:53:31 2015 UTC,But he said that he swapped it.
ArcherFX,3drsd6,Beersaround,4,Sun Jul 19 01:12:15 2015 UTC,When Krieger chokes the clone with the tie it wouldn't have removed the tie whereas the real Kriegers bowtie was actually ripped off of him and replaced with his normal tie  Edit: it wouldn't be hard to imagine Krieger suffering a concussion and with the way his brain works thinking he's a clone or maybe there was never a real Krieger who knows man
ArcherFX,3drsd6,blackmarketdolphins,5,Sun Jul 19 02:03:56 2015 UTC,The regular tie means nothing. He doesn't like bow ties so he switched.
ArcherFX,3drsd6,Fastriedis,3,Sun Jul 19 02:10:10 2015 UTC,Why would he stop the missile? The clones were willing to kill Krieger to ensure it went off
ArcherFX,3drsd6,evilpoptart,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:12:34 2015 UTC,"If a Krieger clone managed to kill the real Krieger, my guess is that the clone realized that the ISIS gang would be much better cover for his operations since San Marcos was about to be taken over by the CIA.

ArcherFX,3drsd6,twalker294,-11,Sun Jul 19 00:40:55 2015 UTC,True but after the show has aired it's no longer a spoiler.

ArcherFX,3diz7c,wise_idiot,9,Thu Jul 16 20:37:01 2015 UTC,Honestly if you didn't like season 1 you probably won't like it now. I loved the show from the beginning and I'm enjoying them finding innovative ways of keeping their formula fresh and hilarious. The core of the show hasn't really changed.
ArcherFX,3diz7c,QuestionMarkus,4,Thu Jul 16 23:00:12 2015 UTC,The first half of season one wasn't that good. It didn't really come into its own until the end of season 1 or the beginning of season 2.
ArcherFX,3diz7c,wise_idiot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:02:25 2015 UTC,"I've watched Bob's Burgers from the beginning and I was immensely disappointed in the last season.  There were a couple decent episodes, but I'm doubting I'll stick with it next season.   IMO it's already becoming repetitive."
ArcherFX,3diz7c,QuestionMarkus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:10:13 2015 UTC,I really hope it doesn't go the way of The Simpsons and stick around for the sake of making more.
ArcherFX,3diz7c,grensley,2,Fri Jul 17 10:17:50 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I feel like Family Guy has already gone that route and South Park is teetering on the edge.  My sincerest hope is that The Simpsons hits 30 seasons and then bows out, even though I know it won't.  I don't think Bob's Burgers has that kind of staying power, but at the same time it'd be nice to have a natural ending.  I hate when shows just cut off without a smooth ending."

ArcherFX,3diz7c,FreeNugs,5,Fri Jul 17 04:41:26 2015 UTC,Replace The Simpsons with Rick and Morty and that would have been a very strong list.
ArcherFX,3diz7c,Fletchenstein,8,Fri Jul 17 01:20:27 2015 UTC,Rick and Morty hasn't aired anything this year. The season doesn't start until this the 26th and the first season occurred before last years emmys
ArcherFX,3diz7c,CJ090,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:57:57 2015 UTC,You're right. My bad. Still think it belongs in a list with these shows next year assuming this season stays consistent.

ArcherFX,3diz7c,domirillo,6,Fri Jul 17 07:59:36 2015 UTC,"Of all seasons, they get a nom for this one? Seasons 1-3 were emmy worthy, not 4-6"
ArcherFX,3diz7c,subtle_nirvana92,10,Fri Jul 17 01:19:07 2015 UTC,"I would say 6 is worthy. yes, it's not as good as 1-3 but it's still a damn good season of t.v."
ArcherFX,3diz7c,pjdwyer30,7,Fri Jul 17 04:20:36 2015 UTC,"For some context, we likely would have gotten nominated for Outstanding Animated Series in seasons 1-3 if we had applied for it.   Instead, FX made a ballsy, but I think admirable decision to instead submit Archer for Best Comedy the first four seasons. That never worked. Animated shows very rarely get considered for Best Comedy, even if they deserve it.  Starting in season 5, we were submitted for the animation category, and sure enough, got a nomination.   Personally, I can't speak for the humor of the show. Humor is very subjective, and it can be hard to gauge what an audience is going to like. I'm not a writer, so I'm not responsible for it being funny anyway. I do have a part in the look of the show, and I would consider Archer to look better than almost any other show on television. I would love it if the show as a whole got an Emmy, but I would be far more satisfied if one of our individual directors and artists got some acclaim for the fantastic art they produce.  That's all."
ArcherFX,3diz7c,Gverreiro,3,Fri Jul 17 15:40:35 2015 UTC,5 is the only season I have a gripe with. Everything else they've put out is great.

ArcherFX,3diz7c,spoyte,21,Fri Jul 17 01:37:03 2015 UTC,"South Park - That's a sick joke.   I dunno, there has always been that aspect of it, but I feel the crux of the show is commentary on relevant current events, which it does like no other show of its kind."
ArcherFX,3diz7c,katzali,10,Thu Jul 16 19:47:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't really seen much of Rick and Morty, but how long does an episode take to produce? A South Park episode takes under a week, which allows it to be as relevant as possible. For example, one episode parodied Obama's acceptance speech, using clips from the speech, and the episode was aired less than 24 hours after the speech was made. It's a remarkable episode turn-over rate."
ArcherFX,3diz7c,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,0,Thu Jul 16 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"yeah, and it's very impresive. However, I gotta admit (I'm sorry reddit) that I don't understand all this attention for it. I mean sur South park is a very good cartoon, but it's not the only one. And it's not light year away from the other (I don't even consider it as the best current one). Yet, it get all the attention.  And for the short producing time, I consider it as a little advantage, but also as a big drawback. It doesn't allow it to have enough work under the media. It's kind of between the late night (every one) and last week tonight (John Oliver). At least, south park as only 10 episodes so they can think about it during the big-half a year-brake.  (I still love South park, I swear. I just don't consider it as THE BEST EVER)"
ArcherFX,3diz7c,McG2k1,6,Thu Jul 16 20:47:51 2015 UTC,"Over the Garden Wall - Art-house attempt at a movie, might get attention just for the fact that it was weird.   Did you even watch this?  Clearly not an attempt at a movie. It has ALL the features of a miniseries - where each episode has it's own climax and conclusion separate from the overarching conflict. If this were in movie form it would not make sense.  Not exactly sure what you're implying by art-house, but if we're going by the traditional definition this is NOT a serious independent project aimed at a niche market. It's a children's show.  And this doesn't get attention because it's weird (I don't see Uncle Grandpa getting nominated for weirdness), it gets attention because it's a great show."
ArcherFX,3diz7c,Amadaun,7,Thu Jul 16 20:53:41 2015 UTC,"Bob's Burgers is good, but Archer is definitely the superior show on that list. How is The Simpsons still considered good by some people? I'm saying it will be Archer or Bob's burgers, I feel like South Park has just become a show about ripping on whatever's popular that week."
ArcherFX,3diz7c,Synit,-1,Thu Jul 16 22:39:39 2015 UTC,I was briefly angry that this is considered animated programming.  In my head this is a real thing.

ArcherFX,3dph4t,moralfiber4,6,Sat Jul 18 04:46:14 2015 UTC,"Yes there's some character development along the way, and a lot of callbacks."
ArcherFX,3dph4t,Grimbriar,4,Sat Jul 18 04:50:03 2015 UTC,"The characters aren't totally flushed out until they reveal Pam's tattoo, which is my favorite episode."
ArcherFX,3dph4t,evilpoptart,3,Sat Jul 18 21:37:15 2015 UTC,Quite a huge amount of character development actually.
ArcherFX,3dph4t,SirCatnipple,2,Sun Jul 19 13:35:16 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of call backs, a lot of ""character development"" but not in huge ways. It's subtle. You have to watch all of it to see the changes and vic life events create smaller changes. Season 1-2 there's bigger changes simply because they're figuring out what to do with the characters themselves. pay attention though on your first run and you'll notice a ton of references and call backs."
ArcherFX,3dph4t,wolfdwnyourfood,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:53:33 2015 UTC,I was surprised to learn that this show is a lot like a sitcom where it has a coherent plot throughout the entirety of it instead of a new plot every episode like Family Guy/Simpsons/Futurama yada yada.
ArcherFX,3dswj2,Dashdylan,17,Sun Jul 19 03:32:17 2015 UTC,"No, the show used the name before it was popular for the terrorist group."

ArcherFX,3dswj2,Protomancer,17,Sun Jul 19 04:01:08 2015 UTC,Isis was an ancient Egyptian goddess.
ArcherFX,3dswj2,Protomancer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:00:57 2015 UTC,Ahhhh so that's the connection between the two? They both drew their names from that source? Or am I misinterpreting
ArcherFX,3dswj2,ajwhite98,14,Sun Jul 19 07:05:31 2015 UTC,All the spy agencies in Archer are named after ancient deities. The terrorist group has many acronyms but ISIS seems to be the one America has stuck with.
ArcherFX,3dswj2,WilliamChaseYoung,6,Sun Jul 19 07:11:00 2015 UTC,"For example, they are known by the US government as ISIL and by many in the media as IS, the Islamic State.  ISIS is the name used by the average American."

ArcherFX,3dswj2,DG729,2,Sun Jul 19 07:13:23 2015 UTC,ISIS is only used for the terrorist group in the west. They call themselves al dawla al islamia (الدولة الاسلامية ) and everyone else in the Middle East calls them daaish (al dawla al islamia fi Iraq wa sham) ( الدولة الإسلامية في العراق والشام‎)  So no link to the goddess
ArcherFX,3dswj2,albert_the_alleycat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:23 2015 UTC,Thanks! Any idea how we started using that name over here in the west?
ArcherFX,3dswj2,TheDarkHorse83,2,Mon Jul 20 17:28:55 2015 UTC,The Arabic name translates to Islamic State in Iraq and Syria
ArcherFX,3dswj2,TheDarkHorse83,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:48 2015 UTC,"This is great! I now have the full story, thank you!"
ArcherFX,3dswj2,TheDarkHorse83,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:24 2015 UTC,"ISIS (the ""nation"") is an acronym that stands for Islamic State in Syria. ISIS the spy organization probably draws its name from the Egyptian goddess, as ODIN, the rival organization, also gets its name from a mythological deity. The ISIS in the middle east is not related to the Egyptian goddess."
ArcherFX,3dswj2,mtwstr,3,Tue Jul 21 06:43:28 2015 UTC,Didn't TV's Joel Grey star with her in The Shazam/Isis Hour?
ArcherFX,3dswj2,Stonn,3,Sun Jul 19 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"ISIS in the Middle East isn't even called ISIS. It's called ""ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah fī 'l-ʿIrāq wa-sh-Shām"" which translates, roughly, to ""Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant"" - The Levant includes Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria, the last of which the media latched onto and the name (kinda) stuck. But before 2013 they were known by other names. 2006-2013, they were know as ISI or Islamic State of Iraq, also known as AQI or Al-Qaeda in Iraq.  Archer first aired in 2009, when the terrorist group was known as ISI, in 2013 ISI's name was changed, but Archer had already aired for the year, so the new season in 2014 was when we saw the FBI raid on Archer's ISIS HQ and they started to sell coke. If you notice, they haven't brought the name back yet and I'm looking forward to see what happens with that this season, now that they're going back to something close to what they were before (an unlicensed 'intelligence' agency/organization)."
ArcherFX,3dswj2,nicholb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:24:02 2015 UTC,"Woah, that's more detailed than I could've asked for! Any speculation on what they'll do with it in future episodes?"
ArcherFX,3dswj2,omgpro,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:16 2015 UTC,"This next season, since they have been officially kicked out of the 'intelligence' community by the CIA, I would guess they're going to do another Vice-style reboot of the team/organization. Hopefully, and this is just speculating, culminating in their redemption and acceptance back into that world, though perhaps under a different name. They'll give some BS reason, like rebranding or something along those lines."

ArcherFX,3dlzov,domirillo,6,Mon Jul 20 11:51:29 2015 UTC,"Matt Thompson, one of the shows producers, once said that Wikipedia should get a writing credit for some of the jokes on Archer.   There is a distinct chance, pretty much certain, that you will hear things that sound like jokes, but yet you do not understand what they mean, only to google them later, and realize that it was a super obscure reference to a historical event or person that is related to what is going on in the show.  Because the jokes are a bit thick like that, the episodes can stand up really well to re-watching. The more you learn about history, literature, & pop culture, the more you'll understand some of the references and homages in Archer."

ArcherFX,3daffq,rm-rfroot,6,Tue Jul 14 22:09:36 2015 UTC,I hope pass them on the road one day.
ArcherFX,3daffq,Quetzacoatl85,10,Tue Jul 14 23:44:11 2015 UTC,This is fanfuckingtastic. You need to tweet that at the ArcherFX twitter handle
ArcherFX,3daffq,rm-rfroot,8,Tue Jul 14 20:39:36 2015 UTC,"wait, as somebody who's unfamiliar with vehicle registration laws in the US, is that license plate intended for use on a real car? what about that picture on there, is that your official municipality's logo? or can you just chose whatever you like?"
ArcherFX,3daffq,dawgflymd,10,Tue Jul 14 22:23:31 2015 UTC,"In the US license plates are issued by the State government (such as Texas or Michigan). The states often offer stated based non profits, veterans, Universities, Cops/firefighters/EMTs, and Amateur Radio Operators (HAM Radio) an option to have their own plates they cost more then a normal plate but part of that increased cost goes to the university in question, or to that non profit. (not sure about Vets and First responders / licensed HAM operators).   You also have an option to get a different licenses at an increase cost then the standard default one.   Here is Michigan's default  Here is one of the alternate ones for Michigan   OP's plate I am guessing is a charity one judging by the URL on the plate.   Finally, for another additional fee you can make your plate a vanity plate by requesting your own selection of letters/numbers. such asBA8OU or G0BLUE etc.  I hope this answers your question."
ArcherFX,3daffq,777-300ER,3,Tue Jul 14 23:04:45 2015 UTC,"an honest thank you for that thorough reply! what piqued my interest was mostly the very flashy design (pictures; additional, non-essential elements like an URL), I think apart from vanity plates, which we also have, and the option to get charity plates (which I did not know about but think are a great idea), such customized designs would not be possible over here. there must be ordnung in accordance with ze rules! :)"
ArcherFX,3daffq,rm-rfroot,7,Tue Jul 14 23:14:02 2015 UTC,"In Texas, we have over 300 specialty options. The state has to approve each design which has to follow the general template, but any organization can design and sell plates for fundraising."
ArcherFX,3daffq,777-300ER,3,Tue Jul 14 23:50:06 2015 UTC,No problem! My guess it is part of the idea of individualism and the fact that US/North American plates are smaller then their Euro counterparts which normally means less distracting. Honestly when you are driving they rarely get your attention unless you are stuck in traffic.
ArcherFX,3daffq,rm-rfroot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:24:14 2015 UTC,"Of course they're a bit extra, but to a lot of people, it's worth it. Also, you'll see a lot of sport teams on plates as well. I'm in the south, so I see a lot of college football teams and NASCAR numbers on plates (I have the latter), but other sports are represented as well. All depends on what the state allows."
ArcherFX,3daffq,macfirbolg,2,Wed Jul 15 15:14:14 2015 UTC,The new sunset plate has replaced 'ol white and blue this year. They switched the letters from white to black so it looks better though. No charge extra now.
ArcherFX,3daffq,residentchubbychaser,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:21:44 2015 UTC,Oh nice I was wondering why I was seeing so many of the Sunset ones lately.
ArcherFX,3daffq,rm-rfroot,2,Wed Jul 15 05:25:31 2015 UTC,"White on orange looked bad but I like the black on orange ones more, so much I got one. However, they will never replace the old sunset from 2000 on. Those were great."
ArcherFX,3daffq,residentchubbychaser,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:44:08 2015 UTC,Yes those were great.
ArcherFX,3daffq,ender89,2,Wed Jul 15 05:48:44 2015 UTC,"In Texas at least, the ham radio plates are free (aside from standard registration fees) as long as the call sign on the plate belongs to the person listed on the vehicle's title."
ArcherFX,3daffq,allyourbase51,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:41:24 2015 UTC,"The states often offer stated based non profits, veterans, Universities, Cops/firefighters/EMTs, and Amateur Radio Operators (HAM Radio) an option to have their own plates they cost more then a normal plate but part of that increased cost goes to the university in question, or to that non profit. (not sure about Vets and First responders / licensed HAM operators).  You also have an option to get a different licenses at an increase cost then the standard default one.    This may have been what you meant by the last sentence, but here in Florida you can customize your license plate characters regardless of your profession or veteran status, as long as it's not already taken and you're willing to pay the extra fee. By that I mean the same number of characters and the same background and everything, but you choose the letters and numbers themselves. My dad had our last name on his plate for 15 years due to this before he finally let it go for privacy reasons."
ArcherFX,3daffq,Asmor,2,Wed Jul 15 06:17:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I was just listing the options as I remembered them.

ArcherFX,3daffq,Ras-Algethi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:23:58 2015 UTC,not sure about [...] licensed HAM operators   They probably just split it between themselves 50/50.
ArcherFX,3daffq,Rich77u,2,Wed Jul 15 07:22:01 2015 UTC,"Most of the states in the US have multiple different official designs, and on top of that, a lot of states have ways by which, provided your design meets criteria, you can get plates made, usually for an organization like a fundraiser, or sometimes car dealerships have their own custom plate designs.  Alaska is where my vehicle is registered, so they're the plates I'm most familiar with. They have two relatively current official plates, though I don't think they issue new Centennial plates anymore.  Centennial  (This isn't mine, but I have my old one on my wall) Standard (Also not mine)"

Finally I used a third random number generator to create a score for each one, and played it out.   And in case anyone can't read it, the lineups were:   Whore Island Ocelots vs Fetching A Rug (96-17) Hostile Work Environment vs Heart of Archness (98-2) Poovey Farm vs Danger Zone (23-90) Slightly Darker Shade of Black vs Pam's Dolphin (13-5) Rigid Airship vs Free Wales Army (61-62) Terms of Enrampagement vs M, as in Mancy (1-39) Rusty Kriegers vs Jazz Hands (59-56) Big Brown Giraffes vs Archers of Loafcrosse (72-39) Whore Island Ocelots vs Hostile Work Environment (73-77) Danger Zone vs Slightly Darker Shade of Black (95-69) Free Wales Army vs M, as in Mancy (54-87) Rusty Kriegers vs Big Brown Giraffes (96-92) Hostile Work Environment vs Danger Zone (14-4) M, as in Mancy vs Rusty Kriegers (75-84) Hostile Work Environment vs Rusty Kriegers (3-8)"

The settings may have changed, but the jokes haven't. The characters have become literal parodies of themselves, and the other characters openly acknowledge that fact when describing one another. They've been recycling the same catchphrases and inside jokes for the last two seasons, and none of the characters have shown much, if any, growth in that time. In fact, most of the characters have gone backwards, becoming one-dimensional stereotypes of what the other characters bust on them for.   I used to love this show as much as anybody, but the last two seasons have been a chore. Hopefully they stop trying to get as much mileage out of the jokes they've already told, and start thinking about advancing the story and the characters some."

I don't think the characters need to get more extreme or more ridiculous or whatever...I would be happy with a return to solid story telling. It's a good formula - Do a show drawing from and parodying typical spy shows and movies, but have the people act more real people in those settings (arguing about stupid shit, bragging about being a spy, etc).   There's too much concentration on trying to take everything to the next level. I almost hope they bring on outside writers to help give the show more big picture direction while Reed et al sort of direct stylistic elements and fun nitty gritty things."

Part of what made Frisky Dingo, Seasons 1-2 of Archer, and Archer Vice so endearing is that Adam really excels at upping how ridiculous things can get, while still making a cohesive story with intersecting plots.

Immortan John is the leader (who Pam is dressed as), and he hoards water to retain control over his population (keep them weak and dependent on him). He releases water every once and a while and warns them not to become addicted to it.   The aerosol is essentially silver spray paint. The war boys basically believe in a viking type afterlife, where dieing in battle is the way to ""Valhalla"" (I forget if it's actually Valhalla in the movie). They sometimes basically suicide on the heroes, and when they do they spray the spray paint on their mouths and say ""WITNESS ME! I AM SHINY AND CHROME"".  Krieger was a minor character who was bad ass. He basically provided the soundtrack to the movie. He was a blind guitar player with a flamethrower guitar who rode suspended on the front of one of the antagonists vehicles.   Anyway, that should answer your questions  End spoilers"

Worth it, although...the commercials (ads for other shows) go on and on and on and I kind of resented the fact that they were there even though I had paid to watch Archer.   Of course, you can just FF through them, but it's the principle of the thing to me.  Anyway, I enjoyed Season 6 very much (especially on second viewing where I noticed a lot more)."

Radical doesn't make Archer, and they did make Aqua Teen and Squids at one point, but that studio is shuttered completely now. All of their former work has moved to Awesome Inc..   The confusion comes from the fact that during Season 1 of Archer, Floyd County Productions rented space in the Radical Axis offices, and hired on some of it's employees. Radical had recently lost a short lived cartoon for Comedy Central called Freak Show, so they had extra space and a bunch of artists with out work.   Season 2 of Archer, Floyd County moved out of Radical's space and into their own office, but videos like this one still exist, showing Archer being made in that old space."

ArcherFX,3cra1l,gsuberland,12,Fri Jul 10 10:23:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if the name 'Dick' was used in this context it could have possibly gotten them kicked out of the bowling alley (depending on how strict the area is). And that wouldn't have been fun for anyone.  Admittedly, if an overprotective parent saw the player list in its current state there could have been an issue, as someone needs to think of the children(!) But the best the alley could have done with this is reset the board and make them choose different names. This is because it is really only alluding to something, that happens to be misspelled.  Plus you have to consider that lines in Archer aren't exactly clear for use in the public eye, and there's a pretty good reason that the show is rated MA in the U.S. If the full line was used in a family environment like a bowling alley there would be issues with that as well."
ArcherFX,3cra1l,Alonaar,4,Fri Jul 10 13:19:02 2015 UTC,Wow. Your bowling alleys must be infinitely more strict than ours. We have on many occasions used some utterly terrible words as our names.
ArcherFX,3cra1l,gsuberland,2,Fri Jul 10 13:20:55 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm not saying it's necessarily the case in terms of being strict. I'm saying that if someone complained, because their children were present, to protect the business I could see the manager kicking out the offender rather than siding with them.  People tend to get offended over the littlest things, so making sure it doesn't escalate would be their priority over keeping people who made a reference to Archer."

In the episode with the Russian sleeper, hot blonde actress ('aaaMAAZing'), Archer shoots a happy face blind out of a paper target and Lana shoots a 'Laverne-esque' cursive L in her target.  I can't remember Lana ever killing anyone with the thousands of bullets she shoots out of her Techs, and Archer is about 1 for 100 with his shots, although he has made a few crazy good shots in Berkeley and Gestadt.  Maybe they could reveal that 90% of the bullets they have used at ISIS were actually blanks to pay for Mallory's liquor?  My wife, who is in a wheelchair, says Ray once did a wheelie in an electric wheelchair, and she says that is physically impossible and that the chairs are designed and engineered to never allow such a move.  It could be explained by saying that Krieger modded it to make wheelies possible.

Maybe because of how it happened, Archer was having a near death experience, and because of that, the memory became un-surpressed (is that even a thing?) until he then wasn't near death, which made him forget again.  It makes sense though, I think you may well be right that Archers actual biggest fear is abandonment. He's been pretty fucked over through the years, although if he is subliminally masking his abandonment issues through alligators/crocodiles, he's picked a damn good replacement either way, those things are terrifying!

If it could only go 30 miles an hour and randomly shuts the engine off when you're on the highway, nobody wants that car unless they're going to scrap it.  You didn't buy the game used, you bought it on sale.  The game was released a year ago, but you already bought it for less than $5.  Being a AAA title from Ubi, that should be telling enough.  For some context, AC Unity, which was also infamously glitch and not very well received, is still $60 full price (and I believe only went to $30-$40 on sale) while W_D is $39.99.

ArcherFX,3cfm0a,scottrepreneur,3,Tue Jul 7 20:58:41 2015 UTC,"TIL Poché. Merci, also nice work.   Pronounced with an exaggerated accent on the final “e”, “poche'” is a French architectural term for the all the stuff that is inside the walls between spaces.  In architectural drawings, it is the stuff blackened in on the plans.  For typical construction where all the walls are about the same thickness and both sides run parallel to each other, poche’ isn’t really a design element.  However, back in the days of predominantly stone masonry buildings, the thickness of stone walls gave them a relative presence that allowed for their manipulation as architectural entities.  The simplest treatment of poche’ and the base cause of the terms use is when architects describe carving into a wall to create a niche.  In those cases they may describe using the poche’ space of the building.  In a sense, it is carving into the “solid” mass of the wall space even though in modern construction this space of the wall is certainly not stone or solid mass.  Baroque plans are especially rich in their interesting manipulation of poche’ to create geometrically shaped rooms.  The resultant wall shapes between rooms, the poche’, takes on a presence that is as “shaped” as the rooms and certainly more interesting than simply the space between two wall surfaces.   poche’ – architect’s glossary"

ArcherFX,3cc802,Tigris_Cyrodillus,6,Mon Jul 6 22:13:24 2015 UTC,That might explain the desire for a career as a country music career in Season 5.

ArcherFX,3cc802,100Points4Gryffindor,2,Mon Jul 6 22:21:51 2015 UTC,"Bipolar individual here, she doesn't have BPD.  She seems like a very manic individual, but bipolar is also marked by major depressive episodes which she lacks.  If she were bipolar 2, most of her life would be depression (but she wouldn't exhibit the mania that she obviously experiences).  If she were bipolar 1, she would still have long periods of depression marked by introversion, so she'd be absent from the social aspects of the show for periods of time.  Also, to be honest, she would definitely not function as well as she does if she had BPD and was unmedicated, which it seems like she is.  Screw being late because of a train dwarf, she'd be missing work a lot.  Yup, I just got all technical, but I find it important to inform about the true nature of mental illnesses since there are a lot of misconceptions out there!"

Anyone else notice this? I wouldn't be surprised if Invisible Monsters was drawn on for inspiration."
ArcherFX,3cc802,burgov_VI,11,Tue Jul 7 03:32:57 2015 UTC,"So as far as I can tell, she's been at least partially insane since childhood.  (Take THAT Gazebo!)  Where she was left in a house where her family was crazy and/or creepy (Grandpa utilizing the network of secret tunnels to check on the children), there was a longstanding history of crazy endeavors to accomplish hideous racist ends, and the fruits of exploitation and/or colonial expansion everywhere.  Her parents exemplify this, and are the primary indicator of her inability to form the connection known as love.  (She jokes about their deaths on the day she misses their funeral).  (Her brother, the compassionate and rational one, is deemed ""gross"").    Love instead becomes a damaging hate/control act wherein one is inevitably the victim.  (Her choke-sex with Cyril to get Archer jealous to win him back; her indifference to the fact that acting out her own murder is the only thing that truly arouses her).    Working for the Archers is the perfect place for her, since the level of physical violence and emotional insensitivity that goes on around ISIS is truly arousing to her.  (The Hatred is the only thing that gets her out of bed in the morning).  Her best friend, Pam, exemplifies her love/hate relationship with most things.  Pam can be extremely brutal, (hot) but is emotionally supportive, (gross).  Pam grew up on a dairy farm (Cheryl is lactose intolerant), and is consistently belittled by Cheryl/Mallory for her weight.  Yet Pam is also glaringly insensitive about the issues she should be quiet about.  (Pam's penchant for gossip about issues which an HR head should certainly keep confidential.)  This intersection of violence, insensitivity, caring, and grossness is what makes Pam Cheryl's safe-zone.  Archer and Mallory, likewise, are quick to mistreat Cheryl, but quicker to mistreat others or themselves be mistreated in her presence, yet the two have a deep familial bond where their emotional needs are satisfied in spite of their mistreatment.  This dynamic is familiar to Cheryl, and the most ""familial"" relationship she has.  So when something happens to ISIS and they're deprived of all their resources, what does family do?  Of course, invite them to all stay at her family mansion.  Her relationship with Dr. Krieger is an interesting one.  It started with her fantasizing about his thin hands being like a child was choking her, which she thought would be hot.  He then uses artifice to replace actual love (classic Krieger) when he doses her with LSD (breath strips/groovy bears), implants false memories in her (she gets those A LOT / Krieger's research into drug induced amnesia), and lends her his CCR records/creates choke-bots to help satisfy her, but it just doesn't work.  This relationship is ultimately unsuccessful but fulfilling to both.  Cheryl is a child, raised on chaos and intrigue, who has witnessed more hate and exploitation in her life than most, who has constructed a role for herself in that dynamic.  She embodies all of it, and wants to be pleasured, comforted, abused, and hurt all at once.  She is all feeling, while her ""thinking"" only gets her through the day to day concerns of arbitrarily running her ancestors' financial empire.  She is aware her job can be done by a monkey, but the opportunity to be front-row to the dysfunction and breakdown that is the Archer family is infinitely rewarding to Cheryl, and a more human interaction than she ever got with her own family."

I tend to find that younger viewers, those who didn't grow up in the '80s and experience it's movies and tv shows, and all the tropes in Vice, don't like it as much as us older viewers do.   Vice was as amazing as the rest of the series. It's just focused at an audience from the same generation as the creators and voice actors, instead of the younger ""just missed the 80s"" viewers."

ArcherFX,3cc9n3,ribbondino,2,Tue Jul 7 00:29:14 2015 UTC,"I rewatched Vice on netflix over a couple of days, and it works a lot better all at once than watching it as it aired.

I will dissent with most on this one but I'm not crazy for S6 either. The dialogue remained a bit awkward. Usually they filled up time with drawn out sequences (like Pam's crying intro) or cheap lines (""I wish you'd get hate-crimed""? Really?). It just feels diluted.  Tl;dr I feel spoiled by S1-S4."
ArcherFX,3c94zf,tigertrussell,131,Mon Jul 6 01:34:27 2015 UTC,This was most definitely done on purpose. The show was paying homage to Miami Vice which also had a lot of continuity flaws.

ArcherFX,3c94zf,bsilverstein,94,Mon Jul 6 03:26:11 2015 UTC,"Yep! The show is extraordinarily consistent in terms of details like this in other seasons. But in Archer Vice, we have numerous examples of things going awry:   This beer can changing back & forth as Pam drinks it. Krieger's head bump disappearing & reappearing. Krieger, Ray, and Pam all changing positions inside the limo. The fighter pilots' uniforms and insignia. Drinks disappearing and reappearing from Mallory's hand. Cyril's presidential outfit changes between shots.   There's simply no way this isn't intentional, given the attention to detail in the other 5 seasons."

ArcherFX,3c94zf,UltraChilly,0,Mon Jul 6 15:02:54 2015 UTC,"It's probably due to different animation houses doing different scenes, different animators in the same studio grabbing wrong assets or even changes not quite being made/checked for deadlines.

ArcherFX,3c94zf,complicationsRx,2,Mon Jul 6 15:54:08 2015 UTC,"I kinda guessed the process (right now I have After Effects and Illustrator opened and doing pretty much the same thing, only shitty because I started to learn a week ago), but I didn't know they were so many working on it, so that's indeed a great source of possible mistakes.   My first thought was that to change the characters' suits they'd have to build a new character rig (maybe there is a way to reuse them with different characters though, I don't know yet), which is something you can't do by mistake but if, for example, the characters had a different enough orientation between the two scenes, that's a possibility.   Concerning the beer can I was pretty much thinking they reused the same comp from one shot to another but they make it sound like their schedule is very tight so maybe at some point it was easier to redo the comp than wait for the other animator, IDK. Still think they're not mistakes but can't be 100% sure."

Knowing him, there was definitely racism behind those comments (as opposed to, say, drawing a connection between the trade of human trafficking and rape), but he did the thing a lot of contemporary bigots do where they self-censor and stop short of being outright racist to avoid massive controversy. Things like replacing ""Jew"" with ""Zionist,"" or ""black"" with ""thug,"" or in this case ""Mexican"" with ""illegal immigrant."" Unluckily for him, this strategy didn't work out in avoiding controversy.  Edit: Yeah, I'm now the guy who's editing his comment and asking why it was downvoted.

Is still obsessed with Rush. And throughout Vice he kept not recording things (studio sessions, film in camera.)  They still make obscure references to very appropriate people: ""Who am I, Charles Fredrick Andrus?""  ""That's exactly how Len Koenecke died.""  Holding up index finger while drinking, and Ray getting paralyzed are also still in the mix.  I do have to agree though, it seems like they are moving away from the more obvious callbacks. Some of it makes sense, like kind of lampshading Danger Zone! and phasing it out along with ""phrasing."" Those two jokes are way too easy and were about to become played out catchphrases and this show is smarter than that.

Either the titles will be a joke (for example, in ""Stage Two"" where Archer is undergoing surgery to remove his cancerous tumor, Lana and Mallory hold up magazines entitled, ""Waiting"" and ""Room"", respectively), or it will be foreshadowing (in Season 4, Cheryl reads a magazine that foreshadows trouble at an underwater research station. End of the season finds the gang at Sealab.).  This is yet another example of that."

It's a living breathing place that has room for reposted content to be seen by a wider audience than its original posting (point in fact: this is the first I've seen this).

SPOILERS:  The Tl;Dr of it though is the gods of the multiverse, the Beyonders, decide that the universes need to be destroyed at some point. So they create Molecule Man, the most powerful superpowered person ever. The twist is, he's a bomb. Each universe has one and when he dies, his universe also dies. One of them dies prematurely though which causes a contraction of the multiverses and an incursion between 2 universes. In an incursion either one earth is destroyed or both universes die. The contractions speed up with more incursions happening until it reaches Marvel 616. The Illuminati pushes the incursions back with the help of the Black Swan, a worshipper of Rabum Alal, the creator of the incursions and destroyer of worlds.  Doom finds out about the incursions and goes back in time to figure out what's happening but in doing so kills Molecule man, causes the first incursion and creates a religion based around himself to keep universes alive by having someone always destroy one earth.  Eventually all the universes are destroyed or saved until there's just 616 and 1610 universes left. Secret Wars starts with Doom telling the Beyonders he dares to stand before them and then both universes die. But then the next issue has a single universe where Doom is supreme ruler."

ArcherFX,3b34yt,Asarath,5,Thu Jun 25 22:38:46 2015 UTC,SPOILERS  Well he thought he did and was just about to press the button that kills both every single time lord ever but him and every single dalek ever before time travel shenanigans happened which made it so that instead of killing everything they all just got moved to another dimension. It also had the effect of him not remembering the time travel part and thinking he actually pressed the button and killed his race. Either way he could have and would have so he's pretty damn deadly.

ArcherFX,3b5kc4,Legobegobego,7,Tue Jun 30 17:55:37 2015 UTC,Dr. Krieger is my favorite.  I hate Mallory. There's no level of depravity or corruption that she won't delve to.

ArcherFX,3b5kc4,roborooter0,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:29:42 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel, I love the dynamic between Archer and Lana, even between Lana and the other characters, because everyone seems so much more crazy by comparison and I think everyone at least once in their lives has felt like they're surrounded by madmen, so I  find her to be relatable."

Every now and then I check to see if there are more interesting, minimalist, or subtle designs but most of them are so garish or poorly designed I can't bring myself to buy any, and the few they do have (excelsior, poovey farms racing) are not much better :(  It's a shame for how smart most of the show is that most of their shirts scream ""Spencer's Gifts."""
ArcherFX,3ax1l6,DukeFartknocker,5,Wed Jun 24 22:01:41 2015 UTC,"To our credit (I work at FCP) we do not design any of the merch, DVD covers or designs, t-shirts, etc. FX outsources those things for whatever reason to other people that are in no way directly associated with Archer, so they're going to look like cheap knockoffs. Trust me, if we could design the posters, merch, and DVD stuff we would, but FX does not allow us to do so."
ArcherFX,3ax1l6,Zombie_Jesus_,2,Wed Jun 24 22:25:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's actually very interesting! I had no idea you worked for FCP, but that explains so much as far as why it always seemed like there was such a weird disconnect with merch and how awesome and well thought out everything else surrounding the show seems to be (to be fair I bought the Glengoolie rocks glasses because they're awesome, so it's not ALL bad and I still want to support the show in any capacity).

I could go on bout the all the benefits for mankind this would bring, from correct alcohol usage in cocktails to the identification of various venereal diseases and even some culinary advice all wrapped up in a packet with mommy issues, alcoholism and stylish clothing. But I think the argument of fun would be the best to provide here.   For years the show Archer has amused me and millions of fans and often even inspired to read literature to find out various cultural references and to dress smart. Even though there is a real risk that this might not be the movie the world wants, but tis most certainly is what the world deserves.   Yours truly,   /u/Socratov."

ArcherFX,3ajl96,rhotuun,3,Sun Jun 21 09:02:17 2015 UTC,"Technically a brand of triple sec, for those wondering.  A French brand, so not necessarily keeping with the drink's Mexican heritage.  Triple sec itself is just a type of liqueur derived from orange peels.    A true, classic margarita consists of the following: A Mexican brand of Tequila, the brand of which obviously depends on your budget more than anything else.  Triple sec, again, buy whatever you can afford.  Lime juice.  Ice.  Kosher salt or margarita salt on the rim of the glass.    Here's what you do: grab yourself a glass that a margarita would look fucking awesome in.  Typically you could use a whiskey glass, one of those inverted cone looking things, or one of those that looks like an upside down sumbrero.  Basically you want something with a wide rim.  Put a layer of kosher salt on a plate or on a ""rimming saucer"", and moisten the rim of your glass with some sort of juice or liqueur.  Lime juice works great, but you could also do lemon juice, or just some of the triple sec.  DON'T USE WATER.  You want something tasty and sticky.  I like to use a lime wheel (round slice of lime), slice it from the center to the outside, and use that slot to moisten your glass.  You can also just use lime juice on a paper towel.  Shove your moistened rim into the salt.  If you want more salt, give the rim a twist before pulling out.  Boom, you've got yourself a salted glass, and you feel a little dirty mixed with kinky afterwards.    Find a shaker and fill it with ice, and throw in a shot of tequila (1.5 ounces), just a bit less of the triple sec (1 ounce), and even less of the lime juice (.5 to .75 ounces).  Basically you want things to be half tequila, and half triple sec with lime juice, ish.  You can play with it if you want.  Now shake shake shake!  Put some ice cubs in your margarita glass if you want, but not too many, and pour your margarita from the shaker into the glass.  Boom.  Almost done.  Remember that lime wheel that you used to moisten the rim?  Stick that on the glass to make it look pretty.  If you don't have one, get one.  Lime wedges are lame, go for the whole round wheel.    Done.  Drink up."

I think he was just trying to make a lower octane drink. And don't get me started on tomato-infused vodka for a bloody mary
ArcherFX,3ajl96,ofthedappersort,6,Sun Jun 21 04:38:27 2015 UTC,"That episode just pissed me off with how absurdly impractical everything was. It's either the same episode or another bar one where, in his little sketch thing, the customer orders a shaken vodka martini, and he makes it stirred with gin.

ArcherFX,3ajl96,Namaztak,3,Sun Jun 21 05:42:21 2015 UTC,"well, i'm not sure what ep. that was but, I think his point is that a traditional martini was made with Gin, Vodka martinis were an invention of the 50's/60's and the ""Shaken not stirred"" thing is pop culture because of bond, and you should never shake a Gin drink because it bruises the botanicals in the gin and changes the flavor profile. now, that all may sound pedantic to you, but to me its perfectly reasonable."
ArcherFX,3ajl96,from_dust,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:40:59 2015 UTC,Bruising the botanicals is a myth as far as I know but shaking a drink does produce a lot more dilution and shards of ice which doesn't look or feel good in a drink that is all booze

Might as well just go in order.  Buuuuut if you're looking for a great one to show him that doesn't require much knowledge of running jokes, I'd say try the Terms of Enrampagement one (I forget the title but it's in the middle of season 2)  Also, the first episode I saw was Swiss Miss (Season 2 opener) and I loved it so you can always try that too."

For a first timer, I'd knock off Once Bitten, though it's tied for top for me, it is abnormal in its heavy borrowing from The Natural. Skytanic, and The Limited both reference events from other episodes, so I'd say Lo Scandalo.   I'd say it is the perfect self-contained episode, with some top characterization for Mallory, Lana, Archer, and Krieger. Enough history talk, film/pop references, and weirdness, to acclimate someone with the show."

So the whole surviving about 75% of total contemporaneous species death is really quite irrelevant, in the same way that Woodhouse's desire for time off is irrelevant to our need for some Eggs Woodhouse and a few pitchers of Bloody."
ArcherFX,3a6gab,Catatafish,7,Wed Jun 17 21:12:19 2015 UTC,"precisely because it was •not• at the time an apex predator.   Actually at the time gators likely were the apex predators of their environments (rivers, swamps, etc...). The Cretaceous period was basically the golden age of crocodilians. The greatest peaks of their species lived during that time period; some all the way up until right around the KT event.   40 foot long, 10 ton monsters like Sarcosochus and Deinosuchus. Deinosuchas is especially likely to have been one because there were no predatory dinosaurs anywhere near its size in much of the range its species inhabited.  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Large_crocodyliformes.svg  As you can see from the chart, the only other crocodillian that rivals those two species in scale and fear factor would be Purussaurus... a monstrous species that terrorized South America only a few million years ago.  Now that I think about it, a super villain intent on cloning one of these things a la Jurassic Park would be a great plot line. Seems like something Barry would do.

ArcherFX,3a6st1,Classic_Rando_,3,Wed Jun 17 22:16:12 2015 UTC,Smash cut?
ArcherFX,3a6st1,TheEvilScotsman,2,Fri Jun 19 23:08:52 2015 UTC,"Smash cut:       A smash cut is a technique in film and other moving picture media where one scene abruptly cuts to another for æsthetic, narrative, or emotional purpose. To this end, the smash cut usually occurs at a crucial moment in a scene where a cut would not be expected. To heighten the impact of the cut, a disparity in the type of scene on either side of the cut is often present, going from a fast-paced frenzied scene to a tranquil one, or going from a pleasant scene to a tense one, for example.  A clichéd use of a smash cut is in a murder scene: the killer brings a knife plunging down into his victim, and just before the blade pierces the skin, the scene is suddenly replaced with a non-violent use of a cutting edge, such as the chopping of vegetables. Smash cuts are often used when a character wakes up from a nightmare to simulate the jarring nature of that experience.  Smash cutting can also be used to comedic effect: for example, directly after a prediction is made, cutting to the future showing the prediction to have been humorously, and often outlandishly wrong. One specific variety of smash cut is known as a Gilligan cut, so named for the TV show Gilligan's Island which frequently depicted a given character resolutely declaring his or her intentions immediately before a cut to a scene depicting the character doing the exact opposite.

ArcherFX,3a8lwk,sc13998,4,Thu Jun 18 13:58:02 2015 UTC,"The show's time setting is comically anachronistic, deliberately mixing technologies, clothing styles and historical backdrops of different decades. The characters wear 1960s clothing and hairstyles, and many episodes feature references to the Soviet Union as a current nation, yet in the fourth-season episode ""Once Bitten"", Turkmenistan is an independent nation rather than a Soviet republic. It also contains references to Fidel Castro as the current leader of Cuba. The show frequently uses pop-culture references which are contemporary to the 2010s, yet character backstories place them at older events — such as Woodhouse's service in World War I, or Malory's involvement in various espionage events of World War II and the Cold War era — which would require them to be much older than they are if the show were actually set in the 21st century.  The technological sophistication within the series also varies, with characters using dated computer technology (e.g. reel-to-reel mainframe systems, desktop computers closely resembling the Apple Lisa, dot-matrix printers, and punch cards) and making surveillance recordings on cassette tape rather than digitally, but also using modern technologies such as GPS devices, the Internet, laser gunsights, cryptocurrencies, USB flash drives and cellular phones (season 6 saw the appearance of touchscreen devices and flip phones). This ambiguity is explicitly recognized in at least two episodes, in which characters are unable to answer when asked what year they think it is.   Wikipedia"

And while the pairings were a good hold over, sometimes it is Jessica's look while someone else is talking that will get me laughing.  That just can't happen as much when they aren't all together.

ArcherFX,39ytil,chase_what_matters,4,Tue Jun 16 02:41:41 2015 UTC,My exact thought! Right on
ArcherFX,39ytil,QuaintBlasphemy,54,Tue Jun 16 02:46:37 2015 UTC,"No.    There's a subgenre of animated comedy that relies very heavily upon ad-libbed dialog and sound editing more than writing. Both Archer and Bob's Burgers have creators that fall well within that tradition.The creators of Archer and Bob's Burgers are Adam Reed and Loren Bouchard, respectively. Reed's resume includes Sealab 2021 and Frisky Dingo, both of which were highly reliant upon improvised dialog, and you can tell Archer runs in the same vein, especially when compared to Frisky Dingo. Bouchard co-created Home Movies, from which Benjamin emerged in his breakout role as Coach McGuirk, and another show that worked through a process of animating around edited improvised dialog.     Benjamin is arguably the best at this sort of voice work. On the commentary for Home Movies, it's often mentioned that the recording sessions can often be hours-long, and Brendon Small and Melissa Bardin Galsky casually refer to times when Benjamin gets in the zone as ""the wrath of Jon Benjamin."" Tom Snyder, who gave Benjamin his break on Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist and producer of Home Movies has stated that he thinks Benjamin's talents for improv are actually being wasted on Bob's Burgers because he's at his best when he's being let loose as the the most insane character in the scene, yet Bob actually tends to most play the straight role.    Anyway...  TL;DR: H. Jon Benjamin is getting hired for these shows because he doesn't read the scripts."
ArcherFX,39ytil,justjokingnotreally,14,Tue Jun 16 05:11:12 2015 UTC,"Adam Reed has stated that improvisation is roughly 5-10% of the show.  I can't be bothered to look up other interviews but I'm sure other voice actors for the show have discussed how awesome the scripts are and how well they stick to them.   http://www.avclub.com/article/adam-reed-52336  ""AVC: How much of the show is improvised?

ArcherFX,39ytil,sacramentalist,-12,Tue Jun 16 13:14:26 2015 UTC,You think Archer is anything other than tightly scripted? How cute.
ArcherFX,39ytil,Mr_A,6,Tue Jun 16 05:39:33 2015 UTC,The show may be tightly scripted. It's able to function this way because everyone else reads their scripts.   But I'm sure there is also an awful lot of improv going on through out.
ArcherFX,39ytil,c0ldsh0w3r,13,Tue Jun 16 05:52:51 2015 UTC,Amber Nash and Lucky Yates are both well known improv comedians and very often participate at an Atlanta improv theater. I'd be extremely surprised if Jon Benjamin was the only one making up a large percentage of their lines.

ArcherFX,39ytil,c0ldsh0w3r,5,Tue Jun 16 06:01:57 2015 UTC,"Item 4. Your move.  EDIT: A little more detail, from this article. No, they don't cut loose like a Loren Bouchard show, but Archer's definitely not so tightly scripted that ad lib doesn't happen occasionally.  Q: Do they give you a chance to ad lib on “Archer?”  H. Jon Benjamin: No, they’re not slave drivers. Depending on the scene, sometimes we can fool around a little bit. On the whole we pretty much keep to the script because the nature in which it’s written, it’s pretty tight and there’s a lot of jokes that have to do with scenes cutting against each other, so there’s not room for it but I’ll throw in a few things.  And a lot of things I assume other characters ad libbed end up having been written. Sometimes they’ll rewrite scenes when once you hear it they don’t work as well as we thought, on the spur of the moment. That’s when things change."
ArcherFX,39ytil,CanadianWildlifeDept,-4,Tue Jun 16 07:02:19 2015 UTC,One line in one episode. I guess you guys proved your point.
ArcherFX,39ytil,Mr_A,5,Tue Jun 16 07:04:41 2015 UTC,"Check the edit. Jon is pretty clear that while the show is fairly tightly scripted, ad lib can and does happen all the time.   Now, if you'd like to go argue with H. Jon Benjamin about this, I'm sure he'll have much more fun with your obnoxious tone than we have. Good day!  EDIT:  From an AV Club interview:  Adam Reed: We record all of the actors separately over two days, and Casey Willis and I direct those sessions. And then we get all the raw voice tracks, and we don’t do individual, numbered takes like a lot of shows do, where it’s “Okay, page seven, line 13. You have two seconds. Go.” We just turn on the machine and read it as a scene, back and forth to each other, and ad-lib, and keep it rolling, and it’s a little bit more organic, I think.  Crave Online interview:  Adam Reed: Actually we record the voices first and animate to that. Our process is all centered around the voice actor’s performance. It’s not like we have them read the picture or anything and it gives us the opportunity to do some ad lib’s, goof around in the booth and come up with new stuff. We put the voice track against the storyboard and we don’t animate anything until it’s done."
ArcherFX,39ytil,CanadianWildlifeDept,-3,Tue Jun 16 07:11:34 2015 UTC,"On the whole we pretty much keep to the script because the nature in which it’s written, it’s pretty tight   It's obvious you're hearing only what you want to. He admits that adlibbing happens some time and that the show ""on the whole"" is tightly scripted. Sure, things change as creative people get together, nothing is ever set in stone. But that's a long way from this quote:   Reed's resume includes Sealab 2021 and Frisky Dingo, both of which were highly reliant upon improvised dialog, and you can tell Archer runs in the same vein,   Which sparked this debate in the first place. Given all the quotes and articles you guys are pulling out left right and centre, I think all you've managed to do is prove that the show isn't ""highly reliant upon improvised dialog""."
ArcherFX,39ytil,Mr_A,7,Tue Jun 16 07:19:15 2015 UTC,"Your exact words: ""You think Archer is anything other than tightly scripted? How cute."" You were so convinced of the literal truth of this, that it was worth being a patronizing jerk to justjokingnotreally over it.  I just showed that Archer is often something other than tightly scripted, including multiple quotes demonstrating that ad libs are a fairly common part of Archer's production even if not a lot of them make it into the script. [EDIT: Note, for instance, that H. Jon said ""it’s pretty tight"", not ""it's really tight"", and then goes on to provide several examples of how it's not that tight at all.]   I never said you were 100% wrong; I'm trying to make it clear that you weren't so clearly and one-sidedly right that it justified being so condescending. However, please note that I would never question your need to be right and I apologize if you got any other impression."

ArcherFX,39ytil,CanadianWildlifeDept,7,Tue Jun 16 18:18:11 2015 UTC,"Not reading the script is different than improvising everything. If Archer were live-action, that would be the case, but since it's animated it means he's reading the script for the first time when he records his lines."

ArcherFX,39ytil,fetteelke,3,Tue Jun 16 08:35:14 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing.  He wants Archer to sound a little under pressure, a little confused, a little tense.  Being unfamiliar with the script probably helps get that edge into his voice."
ArcherFX,39ytil,dejour,3,Tue Jun 16 14:02:12 2015 UTC,This just makes me think of the raptor version of the pilot episode.
ArcherFX,39ytil,ImaginarySpider,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:06:39 2015 UTC,The what?
ArcherFX,39ytil,vultureslayer,3,Wed Jun 17 01:22:34 2015 UTC,There is a version of the pilot episode of archer where they replace Archer in all of his scenes with a raptor. And all of his dialog with raptor noises. It is out there on the torrent universe if you are looking. There have been a lot of people who have accidentally downloaded the raptor episode instead of the original pilot when they are trying to start the show and they end up really confused as to what is actually going on in the show and what it is about.  http://archer.wikia.com/wiki/Archersaurus
ArcherFX,39ytil,ImaginarySpider,2,Wed Jun 17 02:47:34 2015 UTC,Oh god bless America that is the greatest thing ever.  Edit: FXX just did one of those Comercial cuts about it. About how Archersaurus was a struggling actor before Archer. What a beautiful coincidence.
ArcherFX,39ytil,vultureslayer,6,Wed Jun 17 12:09:59 2015 UTC,"Professional voice actors usually don't read scripts before they head to the studio, especially for characters they're familiar with. Often scripts are being tweaked right until the last minute (at least in my industry) or are even locked under NDAs and can't get to the actors' hands before recording. There is nothing special about this."

ArcherFX,39ytil,GoldenSama,-12,Mon Jun 29 19:00:14 2015 UTC,Saying he doesn't read the scripts tells me he doesn't give a fuck about what happens in the show.  Just pay me.   Not really good news if you ask me.
ArcherFX,39ytil,Clashman223,4,Tue Jun 16 08:45:48 2015 UTC,"What happens in the show is largely out of his hands.  It's not like being a sitcom actor, who can ad-lib lines or want to change things based on the studio audience's response to a first take.  By the time a voice actor gets a script, the episode is well int its production schedule.    Sure, if he doesn't like where the character is going he can raise concerns with the producers, but there's not much he can do in the short term."
ArcherFX,3a3uk5,CJ090,8,Wed Jun 17 00:43:22 2015 UTC,"He doesn't say it's strange that she wears two, he says its strange that she wears them to a dinner party.

ArcherFX,3a3uk5,sc13998,2,Thu Jun 18 14:04:46 2015 UTC,I assumed she was about to spill the beans about how Malory insisted they all come prepared for action. She stopped Lana from disclosing this information because it would have seemed suspicious.

Without the suit, changing depths as quickly as they needed to (being extremely deep after all) would cause the oxygen in sterling to bubble up, which could cause serious harm/kill him (it's like being crushed on the inside), so instead they made him empty the oxygen from his body, temporarily drowning him, so it wouldn't be able to affect him. If you want to learn more about it (it is a real condition), look up decompression chambers and ""the bends"", otherwise known as decompression sickness."

It seems really odd that Krieger still has his fascination with Rush and the same holographic girlfriend if he wasn't the same person.  Any of his memory loss could be reasonably attributed to falling off the tower when fighting the clones.  At the same time, you could use similar logic to justify the things he ""remembers"" as Krieger, so it could really go either way.    It seems to fit into the Archer style to leave it up in the air awhile, potentially forever."

ArcherFX,39wn6z,studentthinker,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:44:27 2015 UTC,"If it's his title then ""Head of KGB"" would be better as articles aren't used as directly in Russian as in English. It's why when trying to do a Russian accent a good tip is to drop 'the' and 'a' as that's a common trend in English speaking Russians doing a more direct translation."

ArcherFX,39o4h6,bugshield,4,Sat Jun 13 04:20:56 2015 UTC,"This?  I totally thought it was a...hm, shit what's it called.  Crib.  I didn't know/forgot it had wheels.    Is that the only thing she has?  A quick search shows that white and pink prams are like 1k.  Or I can hunch with a child-sized baby doll pram for $200. D:    Hmm.  Maybe I can get away with a pink and white folding stroller."
ArcherFX,39o4h6,bugshield,9,Sat Jun 13 04:31:43 2015 UTC,Yes. Brits called it pram but in US it's vintage baby stroller/carriage. How about car seat? She's always in car seat.
ArcherFX,39o4h6,pavel_lishin,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:44:51 2015 UTC,"That seems even more annoying to carry around than just a baby.  /u/lehmongeloh might be able to build a pram like that out of cardboard; it won't look great without a fair amount of work, but it would get the job done, and would be cheaper than $200."
ArcherFX,39o4h6,Optical_Endevor,2,Sat Jun 13 15:22:33 2015 UTC,I looked on Craigslist for one after people mentioned it and found one for 10 that's in working order. I just need to spray paint it if I decide to buy. I wouldn't mind a stroller. I need something to put my shit in since Lana doesn't have pockets and carrying around a increasingly heavy purse is not fun. The only sticking point would be taking public transport. Cardboard seems like a way better idea. Thanks!

ArcherFX,39o4h6,beardface84,3,Sun Jun 14 12:06:46 2015 UTC,"As people mentioned there is a car seat and ptam/stroller/carriage.    But mostly they leave baby with her grandmother unattended, a lot of times seen alone in the room/lab, or carried by strangers. Don't forget, when baby is around, to smoke, drink (let baby taste the rocks, garnish from your drink), DON'T FEED, and randomly forget where you last saw her.  Ps: no badges, they did work for but not at CIA, you could use ""cancer ribbon"""
ArcherFX,39o4h6,nobasics,2,Sat Jun 13 07:48:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the food for thought. Great way to do some character acting with the prop. I don't have anyone else to cosplay with so I wanted to make it more recognizable than just some girl with guns in a dress.
ArcherFX,39o4h6,beardface84,2,Sat Jun 13 20:35:32 2015 UTC,I think the pram she has is a silver cross style pram. Pretty expensive
ArcherFX,39o4h6,nobasics,2,Sat Jun 13 22:19:15 2015 UTC,"Nice ID.  I just need something that looks close enough, and prams seem to be way better than a crazy cheap stroller.  So this thread has been super helpful.  I found some potentials since the $10 one I found seems to be sold already:   1 2 3   That I could just spray paint white and pink.  But prams are honking big as I've discovered, so maybe I'll do the cardboard sides idea over a lightweight stroller or...something...and then I could paint it and myself cartoon-y.  Although that might be more of a ""next time make it better"" thing."

When Archer kicks the Stewardess out of his house in the pilot, she says that Archer promised him breakfast. Archer responded that she try the diner because she's obviously into Greek (Greeks pioneered anal sex), and then Abelard barks in approval.  The reference here is that the historical Abelard was a French philosopher that studied the works of Socrates and other Greek philosophers, thus making it sensical that the dog would laugh at Archer's joke."

ArcherFX,39h0an,TheDarkHorse83,13,Thu Jun 11 18:00:13 2015 UTC,I loved coke Pam! And watching her run around outside of Ramon's place all coked-out was great!
ArcherFX,39h0an,hipery2,6,Thu Jun 11 20:05:59 2015 UTC,they just seemed to be trying too hard...the wit wasn't as sharp or quick to me.   Thank God it's not just me. It was like they were trying to fit as many jokes and character quirks from the previous seasons into one season.
ArcherFX,39h0an,kewidogg,11,Fri Jun 12 07:00:01 2015 UTC,Dang I just rewatched that one and it was actually funnier the 2nd time. Particularly when they first get captured and he uses Slater's CIA code hahaha.

ArcherFX,39h0an,Sam_Vimes177,4,Thu Jun 11 19:26:42 2015 UTC,"The why isn't due to relevance,  it's due to content. That episode was boring and generally uninspired and just felt like a big hamfisting of a joke because Loggins contacted the show about his interest. They could have gone a million ways with it to make it funny and the way they chose was rather shit."
ArcherFX,39h0an,TheDarkHorse83,5,Thu Jun 11 19:28:58 2015 UTC,"This one felt so forced, it didn't fit neatly into the story line of the season, they had to take a break from the flow of things to shoe-horn this one into place. It just wasn't the calibure that I've come to expect from Archer."

The minute that she revealed that she had broken into the doctors' office and stole Archer's sperm to impregnate herself, she dropped drastically in my book. 'Sitting' was just part of her continued downward spiral."

ArcherFX,39h0an,scootunit,2,Sat Jun 27 23:17:15 2015 UTC,I couldn't pick a bad one.  I might be in the minority but I really liked Archer Vice  Umm the one from Season 6 with Pam's sister?

What makes the interaction better is when Malory suggests that Lana is making a biblical reference but she doesnt get it since she didnt go to Rabbinical school. Cheryl says that he moves the rock after 3 days and Pam chimes in saying he then shuts off the tractor beam releasing the Jews from captivity.   to top it off Malory thinks she's heard that from the Gospel of Luke.

Yes, the patterns of most jokes are repeatable, but there are only 8 in the world, as scientists say.  Ray, there must be a reason why he gets all the troubles with his body being destroyed gradually; just look at Pam's story, how and where she grew up, should be enough to understand her (well not exactly), Cheryl is really smart, but also bit crazy, try inheriting half of the countries railroad, real estate and all that millions of dollars, see how it turns out, rich peoples' problems.

She has also referenced some things in the past that a stupid or even regular person probably wouldn't know ie ""who am I, 16th century female Irish pirate Grania O'Malley?""

ArcherFX,392wyz,Alantha,275,Mon Jun 8 21:33:53 2015 UTC,Lucky Yates modeled as Ray? TIL.
ArcherFX,392wyz,joel_of_the_jungle,81,Mon Jun 8 22:11:50 2015 UTC,Do you think he modeled for Ray then was cast as Krieger? Or cast as Krieger then modeled for Ray?
ArcherFX,392wyz,Sunuvamonkeyfiver,72,Mon Jun 8 22:39:24 2015 UTC,"I bet he was cast as Krieger first because in the early episodes, Ray was more of a minor character."
ArcherFX,392wyz,joel_of_the_jungle,35,Mon Jun 8 22:47:40 2015 UTC,so was krieger though
ArcherFX,392wyz,leonryan,47,Mon Jun 8 23:08:54 2015 UTC,Ray wasn't even in the pilot though. So I think it's safe to say Krieger came first.
ArcherFX,392wyz,beernerd,44,Mon Jun 8 23:34:56 2015 UTC,"Krieger didn't talk at all until episode 4. IIRC they didn't originally intend for him to be a speaking character, but changed their minds and cast Yates as the voice."
ArcherFX,392wyz,Bluefastakan,35,Mon Jun 8 23:52:54 2015 UTC,"seriously krieger, you are my oprah"
ArcherFX,392wyz,Vegito2468,5,Tue Jun 9 00:55:53 2015 UTC,No way... I mean... I knew he was originally a minor character... but seriously? Great. Now I have to go back and check...
ArcherFX,392wyz,beernerd,6,Tue Jun 9 00:53:57 2015 UTC,He wasn't even listed in the opening credits until a season or two ago
ArcherFX,392wyz,whyyoumad14,3,Tue Jun 9 04:18:23 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Ray still isn't listed in the opening
ArcherFX,392wyz,thejarlofboobs,3,Tue Jun 9 15:35:25 2015 UTC,"I think that's a guild thing, though I could be wrong."

ArcherFX,392wyz,rocky_comet,3,Tue Jun 9 06:20:05 2015 UTC,I'd imagine Krieger-san. Always Kreiger-san.

ArcherFX,396dkm,Jrdaviscubed,2,Tue Jun 9 20:41:06 2015 UTC,The difference though is that Lana really loves Archer and vice versa. Talia on the other hand whilst she loved Batman/Bruce she loves her daddy much more that she's willing to kill Batman for her daddy. Batman did loved Talia but the true love of Batman/Bruce's life is Selina Kyle in which Talia even confessed to Selina that Batman loves her more. (parallel between Lana and Katya?) Plus if Lana is crazy bitch Talia is psycho bitch who has mental issues.

(Cold open: Archer pinches his nose in disgust as he enters Woodhouse's darkened bedroom, after knocking on his door and yelling for him to make him breakfast and pick up his dry cleaning. He smacks the walls blindly looking for the light switch, and finally illuminates the tiny bedroom. Woodhouse is lying on his side, his back facing Archer)  Archer: Jesus, Woodhouse! It's damn near noon and you're still in bed?! Since when are you allowed to sleep in as long as me? (He approaches Woodhouse's bed, the valet doesn't stir)...Woodhouse? Dammit, did you overdose again?  (Archer shakes Woodhouse's shoulder a bit, and it's clear that rigor mortis has already set in. His face drops at the realization, he's speechless. He grabs a mirror off of Woodhouse's nearby nightstand, and holds it against his nose...nothing)  Archer: (he removes the mirror and covers Woodhouse's head with the bedsheets, and stares at him an extra few moments)...shit, now I gotta pick up my own dry cleaning.

ArcherFX,391wiq,vivvav,3,Tue Jun 9 20:30:48 2015 UTC,"Before the baby I think if this happened Archer just would've made jokes about it and dismissed the situation entirely. Like he just wouldn't care and would start looking for a replacement. But since in the past couple seasons he's undergone development where he starts to care about (some of) the people in his life, he may react differently.    I imagine Archer would probably feel more than a little guilt, as he basically encouraged Woodhouse's heroin addiction and regularly assigned him harmful tasks that likely shortened his lifespan. He's blame himself for not treating him better and have to come to terms with just what Woodhouse was to him and how much he took him for granted."
ArcherFX,391wiq,sc13998,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:10:09 2015 UTC,"I agree that the reaction will be bigger now a days, but I think even before AJ that Archer would still have been deeply saddened by the loss of Woodhouse. I don't believe that he would have made a big deal about it, but I think the writers would have shown a scene where sterling is maybe having a flashback to when Woodhouse was his only parent, causing him to feel truly upset by the loss."
ArcherFX,391wiq,sahArab,3,Wed Jun 10 00:02:17 2015 UTC,"I'd expect Archer would freeze up at the reality of death so close to home. I'd be more interested in seeing Malory react, maybe pay poor Woodhouse tribute, maybe realize her shortcomings that he was compensating for.  I would enjoy seeing Archer maybe panic during missions, show caution bordering on cowardice for a little while, just to make his usual thoughtlessness seem preferable."
ArcherFX,391wiq,BDalyxx,2,Mon Jun 8 21:08:13 2015 UTC,"It's easy to analyze the Archer and Woodhouse relationship, because we see it so much, but I agree: Mallory's reaction would be great to see, and a chance to give Jessica an opportunity to do some solid acting.  Woodhouse is a better parent (despite the whole heroin thing...) than Mallory has ever been, and I'm sure she knows and resents that a little. She's definitely be feeling some regret and other feelings not so easy to deal with."
ArcherFX,391wiq,dexanh,2,Mon Jun 8 22:30:49 2015 UTC,despite the whole heroin thing...
ArcherFX,391wiq,sahArab,2,Tue Jun 9 12:24:11 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see all of that, too.  In fact, seeing Malroy's reaction might be even better than Sterlings.   Hell, he saved her life and raised her son..... Yeah, I'm betting there could be some really great emotional action there."
ArcherFX,391wiq,burgov_VI,2,Mon Jun 8 22:33:05 2015 UTC,"They're both parental figures to Sterling, both are treated with ingratitude and disrespect by Sterling and both care very much about him.

ArcherFX,38ssvc,dankman13,3,Sun Jun 7 01:29:20 2015 UTC,I think Archer just thinks it's easier to have Cyril oblivious. If Cyril knew he'd feel obligated to take responsibility which means him paying child support or somehow being involved in the kids life.

ArcherFX,38ssvc,ON3i11,0,Sat Jun 6 22:28:30 2015 UTC,Plus the only noticeable difference about Archer is his haircut which was likely required by field agents but not comptrollers.
ArcherFX,38ssvc,Loss-of-Blood,4,Sat Jun 6 22:29:22 2015 UTC,"A screenshot from that scene was on the front page of the sub about a week ago   I don't remember much about it either, but then again for some reason that entire episode is a bit of a blur for me.  In the shot you can see that while virtually everyone in the picture is significantly younger (with Archer, Lana, Ray, and two other agents being fresh out of Training, and Crenshaw being present as well) Cyril looks identical. Seeing as the Archer Wiki puts Archer at 37, it's fairly obvious that this scene happened about 10-15 years before the events of the episode.  So two possibilities exist, either Cyril is significantly older than the rest of his coworkers (sans Mallory), or it was an oversight on part of the animators, where they just used Cyril's default model instead of tweaking it to remove the peppering of the hair and a few other ""age"" features"
ArcherFX,38ssvc,I_EAT_POOP_AMA,6,Sat Jun 6 22:41:30 2015 UTC,Either that or Cyril has just looked the way he looks for a long time. My dad went bald in his early twenties and looked exactly the same up until his late thirties.

ArcherFX,38t3xx,zerow6789,5,Sat Jun 6 19:09:22 2015 UTC,"Mallory was married to someone named Archer, the question has always been whether her husband was sterling's father or not.  Although now that I think about it, they did have the fake funeral with the 21 gun salute and sterling dressed like JFK jr."

ArcherFX,38pm0q,duck_waddle,-1,Sat Jun 6 00:49:39 2015 UTC,It's the one with the Koreans where Cyril goes to spy on Lana and Archer
ArcherFX,38pm0q,ypatel94,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:44:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the honeymoon suite one! Where Cheryl and Pam get a room with Cyril right? That also has the part where Archer paddles up the side of the hotel really fast to complain about his bonus, also hilarious."

It shows that overtly sensitive and humanistic side of Archer we rarely (but consistently) see, and it provides such a comical contrast to his typical egocentric attitude towards everything. It's also a bit dark, and that only adds to the humor."
ArcherFX,38pm0q,duck_waddle,0,Sun Jun 7 21:02:21 2015 UTC,"But it's not funny... the way it's scripted reveals the intended pun in the very beginning. And Lana's reaction made even less sense.  It would have been better if Archer had just said ""Pam told me a story about a girl trying to save a drowning puppy"" and afterwards he would reply with the ""The puppy drowned too"" line. Then Lana's reaction would have been understandable."

ArcherFX,38oxav,harveywendon,39,Fri Jun 5 17:10:40 2015 UTC,Cracking down on shitposts sounds amazing. Sadly I think it is very difficult for most TV shows to maintain decent levels of quality between seasons so you will have a lot of moderation to do!
ArcherFX,38oxav,boardmonkey,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:44:14 2015 UTC,"Then maybe we need to get more moderators.  There is nothing in the rules that states we can only have 5.  I am not saying the current mods are doing a bad job, and by initiating this discussion we can see that they want what is best for this sub.  What I am saying is if we implement change we may need additional mods to ensure the rules are followed."
ArcherFX,38oxav,boardmonkey,2,Fri Jun 5 20:33:08 2015 UTC,"Number of mods is not really an issue. The amount of work is, honestly, not all that huge. Though we could use someone who would love to make the sub look all fancy and is a wizard with CSS."
ArcherFX,38oxav,harveywendon,4,Fri Jun 5 21:03:01 2015 UTC,"If you believe that you are up to the task of being a more active moderation crew, then that is good enough for me. I really have no idea how much effort it would take.  Mainly I was stating that the amount of work shouldn't be a restriction.  Also, while I don't think that the sub looks bad in any way, I too would love to see what a CSS guru could do.  I would help, but all I know how to do is sell beer."
ArcherFX,38oxav,boardmonkey,2,Fri Jun 5 21:55:53 2015 UTC,I don't necessarily mean adding more mods. I meant that there isn't usually new content to talk about during offseason which means that shitposts are more obvious as there is less actual content.
ArcherFX,38oxav,fishgoesmoo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:42:21 2015 UTC,You are right.  I misinterpreted your statement.
ArcherFX,38oxav,boardmonkey,12,Fri Jun 5 20:57:25 2015 UTC,I don't know if this has been done before but maybe start a weekly discussion thread starting at season 1. It'll give us something to do.  The guys at /r/theamericans are doing exactly that.
ArcherFX,38oxav,Streber001,4,Fri Jun 5 19:46:39 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great idea.  We can start analyzing the show from a new perspective, and maybe find relations to previous episodes that we have not acknowledged.  I also don't mind seeing content about other projects that the cast, creators, and production staff are related to."
ArcherFX,38oxav,RevWaldo,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:27:09 2015 UTC,"This would be awesome. This is my all time favorite show, and I would love to see discussions on it weekly, even if we started with something like, best first episode to introduce people to the show. Everyone has a favorite episode but finding the perfect episode where you are still meeting the characters and such while still being something that grabs people from the start. Obviously start from the beginning but pilots normally aren't what people get pulled into. For me it was half way through the first season where I fell in love with it."
ArcherFX,38oxav,leostotch,8,Fri Jun 12 21:22:19 2015 UTC,"DON'T get rid of the low-relevance flair! I wish more subs had something like it. A lot of posts marked low-relevance can still be interesting (like, oh, I don't know, this one.) But yeah, random ocelots and the like should be figuratively killed off."
ArcherFX,38oxav,boardmonkey,18,Sat Jun 6 03:09:32 2015 UTC,"It's the off season, I'm not sure what else we could expect.  What would be left if we got rid of these 'shitposts'?  We get some interesting stuff about what the creators of the show are doing with their spare time, but that content is pretty sparse.    Also, FWIW, they don't particularly bother me.  Just downvote and move on - I don't see any need to gather the torches-and-pitchforks crowd every time someone posts a D4NGR2N license plate."
ArcherFX,38oxav,leostotch,10,Fri Jun 5 18:35:30 2015 UTC,"I would rather have quality over quantity.  I don't need to see a new post everyday, just as long as when there is a post it is a quality post.  In fact I would rather not have my frontpage littered with pictures of sticks, facebook posts, text messages, and so on.  When I log into reddit I want to learn something new, or see something amazing, or laugh at something hilarious.  If I want to see something mildly interesting, like a stick shaped like a gun, I would subscribe to /r/mildlyinteresting."
ArcherFX,38oxav,boardmonkey,5,Fri Jun 5 20:27:39 2015 UTC,"That's fair enough, but again, that's what the downvote button is for.  I don't think that more heavy-handed moderation is an effective answer here."
ArcherFX,38oxav,leostotch,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:34:27 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the voting is not necessarily the best way to decide which content should be viewed.  The reason for this is that there is a difference between active and passive users.  As an active member I participate in the activities of the subreddit.  I comment where I think appropriate, and I play an active role in the community.  The passive users do not focus on this subreddit as much as you or I, and largely do not care about how this subreddit is run.  By the very nature of reddit passive subscribers far outnumber the active subscribers, and therefore get to dictate the quality of posts seen.  By starting this conversation I don't see the moderators as trying to be heavy-handed.  On the contrary I believe that they are taking a more active role in the sub to ensure that those of us that are active members are getting to see the quality of content that we are looking for."
ArcherFX,38oxav,madcowga,5,Fri Jun 5 21:36:20 2015 UTC,"While this is true during the off season, it happens plenty during the season. And yeah, for the most part the shitposts don't bother me, but yesterday we reached a new low with a picture of a stick being posted. Dangerzone license plates and such are usually tolerated, but a stick... that is the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back and was the impetus behind this thread."
ArcherFX,38oxav,Historyguy81,4,Fri Jun 5 19:46:51 2015 UTC,"And it looks like the community responded pretty positively to a picture of a stick - nearly 600 upvotes as of right now.  Shoot, I had just watched that episode and chuckled a little at it.  I can understand not liking a post like that, it really doesn't add anything to the sub, but I also don't see the harm in it - if you don't like it, that's what the blue button is for."
ArcherFX,38oxav,ShoelessHodor,2,Fri Jun 5 19:49:07 2015 UTC,"The problem with posts like that is that once we allow one, more follow. This is not a sub for ""line from tv show"" title, ""random, tangentially related picture"" link. A stick epitomizes a shitpost. Low effort, low content, low relevance, blatant karma farming. You want that, go over to /r/funny or /r/pics."
ArcherFX,38oxav,YGOnewguy,4,Fri Jun 5 20:14:59 2015 UTC,"context is everything and people, hundreds of them, thought the context of a picture of a damn stick was funny.  Think about that.  That's some powerful stuff.  People voted for a picture of a stick based on a memory of a silly TV show.  This is what reddit is about: the community decides what to reward."
ArcherFX,38oxav,YGOnewguy,4,Tue Jun 9 13:05:42 2015 UTC,I agree that posts about tangentially related stuff should be curtailed.
ArcherFX,38oxav,-wwwpastacom,3,Fri Jun 5 18:47:36 2015 UTC,"Yes. Crack down on shitposts.   I would rather have no new content than shitty content.   This is always an issue with tv shows in the off season, especially shows like archer/GoT/anythingnetflix with only ten episodes that are all released in a short time, but there are ways to keep conversation going without all the clutter."
ArcherFX,38oxav,Scruffington2008,3,Tue Jun 9 15:41:15 2015 UTC,"Easiest way I can think of cracking down on ""Shitposts"" during the off season would be to remove the option for link posts and have self posts only, this would remove the people who are only posting for karma  /r/assassinscreed has text posts only (no season of link posts) and it is pretty good, nothing but discussions or useless posts"
ArcherFX,38oxav,residentchubbychaser,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:05:56 2015 UTC,That is actually not a horrible idea. I like it.
ArcherFX,38oxav,valkyrjas,2,Thu Jun 11 01:11:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would be pretty good, 3 months there are posts of all kinds, and then 9 months of text posts only, or maybe go 6 months with link posts and 6 without  Or for the off season have a ""daily theme"" and have link posts only on 2 days of the week while the other 5 are text post only  Either way, Mods have been pretty stellar on this sub"

Patron isn't bad tequila, it's just overpriced for what it is. Patron cafe is delicious though.

However, we also know that they have cellphones with high quality ring tones.  Burt Reynolds has silver hair.   Kenny Loggins did his Danger Zone thing and is rather washed up.  Christian Slater isn't a teen heartthrob but a fully grown adult.   Archer's car could talk to him.  Krieger, while being a semi Boy from Brazil, has a holographic Girlfriend and Kriegerands, his own cryptocurency.   There is also Sealab 2021 going on here too!

ArcherFX,38h6hq,leostotch,3,Thu Jun 4 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"Just to break that down:   Archer was born during World War 2 since we saw pregnant Malory and Woodhouse, himself a world war one veteran and war hero, in North Africa.   If we assume Archer is in his mid- to late- thirties, that puts us somewhere in the late '70s or early '80s.   There is constant talk about the KGB and the USSR.   So far so good; the Soviet Union was formally dissolved in 1991.   However, we also know that they have cellphones with high quality ring tones.   Now we're getting a little complicated - especially because their cell phones have video chat (see the blimp episode).  That complicates our timeline, since cell phones weren't really ubiquitous in the US until the late nineties or early naughties.  We have, however, ruled out most of the '90s.   Burt Reynolds has silver hair.   Not sure when his hair started to change, but he's coming up on 80 here pretty quick.  This doesn't give us a great date range unless someone can find where his hair started to change colors.   Kenny Loggins did his Danger Zone thing and is rather washed up.   In 1998, K-Log recorded a track for Elmopalooza; I think it's safe to say that his career has been on the downswing for some time.  Like Burt Reynolds' hair, this doesn't give us a good date range, but it does indicate it's later rather than earlier.   Christian Slater isn't a teen heartthrob but a fully grown adult.   Slater is currently in his mid 40s, so call this any time since 2000.   Archer's car could talk to him.   Whatever, KITT could talk and was an actual intelligence, not just a shitty Dodge recording.  Any time from 1982 onward.   Krieger, while being a semi Boy from Brazil, has a holographic Girlfriend and Kriegerands, his own cryptocurency.   ""Bit Gold"", the first cryptocurrency, was invented in 1998 according to Wikipedia.  Wikipedia also indicates that the first laser-generated holograms were created as far back as 1962, so that doesn't really impact our timeline.   There is also Sealab 2021 going on here too!   We all know that Captain Murphy left Sealab to lead earth's forces in the Great Spice Wars, so I'm going to say that the Archerverse is an alternate reality and discount this bit entirely.  In conclusion, it seems that we can say that Archer definitely does NOT take place between, say, 1991 and 1998.  Maybe push that out to 2000."

ArcherFX,38h6hq,christinatheterrible,5,Thu Jun 4 21:31:40 2015 UTC,"My personal head canon is that it is an alternative history and it is in modern times.  The point in which history alternated? The race to the moon never happened. Instead of antagonising the USSR further the US used the project to show ""humanity is great together"" and so the Soviet Union and the USA worked together on landing on the moon and overcome at least the biggest hostilities.  It fits with most things we can see on the show. Obvioussly WW2 happened as we know it, the technology is on par wit ours except for spacetraveling technology (they seem capable but just not willing to travel to Mars) which is the result of the two superpowers working together in that field and not against each other, and the US didn't had to constantly re-invent itself to promote capitalism so much that is why clothing style and technological aesthetic from the '60 are still around. Furthermore without the need to directly compete against capitalism the USSR is stable enough to maybe still exist in our times."

It was first described in 1638 by Galileo Galilei in his Two New Sciences.  This principle states that, as a shape grows in size, its volume grows faster than its surface area. When applied to the real world this principle has many implications which are important in fields ranging from mechanical engineering to biomechanics. It helps explain phenomena including why large mammals like elephants have a harder time cooling themselves than small ones like mice, and why building taller and taller skyscrapers is increasingly difficult.

ArcherFX,3881bk,BagelTrollop,3,Tue Jun 2 21:04:00 2015 UTC,Yeah.  It's all just character development.  There's a journey between points A and B as actors settle into a new character and work out the personalities.
ArcherFX,3881bk,Mistaken_Stranger,14,Tue Jun 2 17:57:24 2015 UTC,It happens in animation the voice they start with changes a little over time. Maybe the voice actor does it so it's easier on their voice. Maybe they get into a more comfortable flow with the characters so the voice relaxes a little.   If you go back and look at the first seasons of Futurama and The Simpsons it's pretty noticeable. Same goes for the venture bros. Their voices have shifted a little over time.   It's just something that happens. Either they do it to make the voices easier on themselves or because there's a tonal shift in the character. Or some other creative choice. Either way it's more common than you think.
ArcherFX,3881bk,JimNear,8,Tue Jun 2 18:00:15 2015 UTC,"Its funny that you mentioned Venture Bros because the voices on that show have gone the opposite direction. Dermott's voice is lower and scratchier, as is Dr. Girlfriend's, Billy is higher pitched and squeakier, the Monarch is high pitched and unbelievably loud, and so is 21. The only one that has been made easier is Hank, and I guess 24 because he's dead."
ArcherFX,3881bk,Mistaken_Stranger,4,Tue Jun 2 21:05:26 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely they pushed to have the voices more exaggerated but it's still an example of voices changing over time. In the best way possible.   Homer's voice got a lot more cartoony after season one in the Simpsons as well. As did Krusty's and Mr. Burns and a bunch more honestly.   Though with Archer it's actually pretty damn impressive how little most of the voices have changed. Probably because they're all pretty well just doing their voices haha.

The voice was incredibly generic. But when adam realized ray needed a personality, he probably put way more thought into the character's nuances so that the unique voice matched the now-fleshed out character. Also, there is the practical consideration that adam needed a voice he could sustain for long recording sessions. Perhaps a 'higher' voice was better for this."

I noticed that in the first season, Ray's voice and mannerisms were those of a stereotypical gay guy. My guess is that Adam didn't want Ray to be the typical, one-dimensional gay character that so many other series have so he changed his accent to more of a southern accent and his personally followed suit. I'd say it definitely worked for the better."

ArcherFX,3881bk,EinsteinKiller,2,Tue Jun 2 18:19:46 2015 UTC,"Actors voices change over time. Even with well established characters, especially if the voice is not their natural speaking voice. For example compare early Homer Simpson with today, and he sounds different, even though its the same actor. Also, Stewie Griffin used to have a much harder accent then he does now. Both of those voices are assumed for the role. That's not the case for most of the characters in Archer, where the actors are using their natural voices."
ArcherFX,3881bk,EveryGoodNameIsGone,2,Tue Jun 2 19:41:36 2015 UTC,"This happens all the time in cartoons. Go back and watch the first season of The Simpsons and listen to Homer's voice, or the first season of Futurama and listen to Bender and the Professor, compared to what those voices became later on.  The voice actor is just figuring out the role in the beginning. As they grow into it and become more comfortable, their voice matures (or devolves, depending on your point of view) until it sort of settles around the second or third season."

ArcherFX,380lnn,darksiderising,2,Mon Jun 1 03:22:08 2015 UTC,That would only make sense to do if they keep a tab on your identity and include that along with the data. And the connection between you and the VPN provider should really be encrypted.

ArcherFX,380lnn,BedMonster,2,Mon Jun 1 15:45:42 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is an oversimplification. But in this context - it is always reasonable to examine the funding model.    Are they replacing the ads you see with their own? (Opening you up to script based attacks and malware). Are they, as Hola appears to, selling your network bandwidth into a botnet?    When I buy a television from Walmart - the transaction, and underlying business model is clear. For VPN's it may not be so - we are only discussing this in the context of users being unaware of what they were enabling by using hola."

ArcherFX,380lnn,unfickwuthable,4,Mon Jun 1 12:02:39 2015 UTC,"Not really, the whole thing is based on torrentfreak article and netflix hasn't confirmed that the allegations are true, in fact they said:   in a statement to Engadget, Netflix said it hasn't made any changes to the way it handles VPN connections, and there are still a number of different proxy services and chrome extensions that international users can use to connect successfully. Torrent Freak notes that the recent increase in blocks could be part of a limited test that may become more widespread. Or, it might just have been an attempt by Netflix to keep the media companies with contracts happy by making an effort to address those cursed ""geo-pirates."""

Ray is completely revamped as a fully cybernetic being after his body succumbs to gangrene,  Cheryl continues to descend into madness at a rate becoming noticeable to the group, Mallory considers quitting espionage, Pam climbs the ranks and soon becomes as good as Archer and Lana, who both start to grow closer together as they raise little Abbiejean.  Much to their surprise, they operate better in espionage when it's illegal, and they soon catch the attention of some of the most dangerous groups of people out there, including the USSR.  But during one job where they break into the CIA's database, they discover that they were set up to fail, and that it's been taken over by a 'foreign power'  They plan a massive retaliation against the organization with the help of the USSR among others, and in the season finale, Other Barry, now a hulking mecha, fights Ray and Katya, Krieger is tearfully forced to kill Cheryl after she finally loses it, showing a far darker side to him than we ever expected, and Kazakh and Babou make a triumphant return.  But just as the CIA headquarters is about to be blown sky high, the gang is apprehended, with the CIA saying that they had an informant to help them.  The blame goes to Cyril at first, but then Woodhouse steps out, rehabilitated from his heroin addiction, and says that he's had enough of Archer and Mallory's abuse, and set up the whole thing, including their discrediting.  He then tells the gang, excluding Archer, to leave, saying that they will be spared if they never work in espionage again.  They leave against their better judgment, and Woodhouse is left alone to riff against Archer and shoot him in the head.    But just as he's about to pull the trigger, time stops, and Archer sees a man wearing a mirrored mask standing in front of him, offering him his hand.  Archer, noticing his hands are free from the handcuffs, takes it, and the both of them disappear.  Sixteen years later, Cyril and Lana live together, and Abbiejean is a teenager.  The doorbell rings and outside is an unchanged Archer and the masked man, with Archer saying, ""It's been a while, hasn't it Lana?"""

ArcherFX,384b02,TheDarkHorse83,11,Tue Jun 2 18:18:29 2015 UTC,"copy-&-paste  ""Archer"" wrapped up its sixth season by leaving the intrepid group of spies possibly out on their ears after the CIA mission debacle. So what does that mean for Season 7?   ""I can tell you that [creator] Adam Reed and I have made zero decisions,"" executive producer Matt Thompson tells Zap2it with a laugh. ""We do this purposely. We don't do anything until the season has been done for about 30 days. ... We use this time to go back and analyze what worked for the season and what didn't.""   But despite no major decisions having been made, Thompson can tease a few things fans can look forward to next year:   1. Woodhouse is alive and there's a big plan for him   ""I do know that Woodhouse is going to be back next season. We had a huge, huge thing that we had planned for him [in Season 6], and I know that we're going to take that plan and put it into Season 7. I don't want to say what it is, but Woodhouse is not dead. I know for certain he will be a part of Season 7.""   2. Archer's continued growth, albeit small, as a person   ""I think that this year, more than any other, you saw [Archer] take two steps forward, two steps backward, one step forward, one step sideways. Throughout the season you saw these little moments where we let him be emotional for a second and I really enjoyed it. It was informed by the baby, it was informed by his love for Lana, and I want to see that stick.""   3. But Archer isn't about to turn total family man   ""I think [Lana and Archer] are headed for the danger zone, if you will. The show is designed for Archer's life to be in turmoil, so I don't know how long they can go on in a nice, happy relationship without something happening to blow it up. It's best to keep that character under pressure, all things coming from all sides. I don't know how long he can hold on to the good feelings he has with his baby mama.""   4. This is not the last you've seen of Gary Cole or Christian Slater   ""Even if we don't work for the CIA or FBI, we have to find a way to keep Gary Cole and Christian Slater around. That was one of the saddest things about Season 5, we didn't see Barry at all. Barry is my favorite non-main-character character. There's always the people I want to see us return to.""   5. There are a few other guest stars they'd love to get   ""I know Archer loves 'Magnum P.I.,' so I'd love to see [Tom Selleck] do something. Then for me, the funniest person on the planet right now is Nick Kroll. I don't know what we'd do with him, but I'd love to get him on the show. ... And what would Daniel Craig do on an episode of 'Archer'? You'd want him to play really against Daniel Craig's muscularity type. I think he would be super interesting to comment upon what we're doing. Those would be my three.""   ""Archer"" Season 7 returns next year on FX.  By Andrea Reiher Apr 02nd, 2015 source"

Shit goes south, Hoff ends of taking a bullet.  Hoff manages to get out ""Sterling... your mother... alligator..."" and then dies.  Cue the team finding an alligator-skin briefcase in Mallory's hotel room with the chip in it.  Sterling always wonders whether he's the man who visited him back on his 6th birthday and gave him the alligator stuffie (a la the Turkmenistan episode)."

ArcherFX,37rv0h,Gerbils74,4,Sat May 30 18:50:11 2015 UTC,"It does work great. And that's the issue.   Usually things that work that great cost money. In Hola's case, it allows your connection to be used as an exit node instead of payment.   While this may seem like a small, inconsequential price to pay it's actually quite alarming that Hola doesn't ever tell customers this upfront. The link can explain better than I can.  I actually used Hola quite frequently up until recently. Im looking to start paying for a legit VPN such as PIA"
ArcherFX,37rv0h,legendofsteve,3,Sat May 30 08:39:59 2015 UTC,"Apologies, the title is misleading. Not sure how no one ever pointed that out in the original comments.

ArcherFX,37rv0h,nuinbot,1 point,Sat May 30 17:09:00 2015 UTC,"No. Netflix needs to realize that people are tunneling with VPNs and other services to get around the area restrictions (why they just don't lock them out via their account information is beyond me), which means they might as well make it available to everyone. Otherwise, they only end up losing customers that would rather find alternate viewing methods."
ArcherFX,37rv0h,VillaThrowaway,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:36:52 2015 UTC,"They know that - they just need plausible deniability when buying content from media companies for specific markets that the content will stay in that market. If you start pushing them, they'll start banning people who use VPNs to bypass their system. To be honest, getting content for specific markets and turning a blind eye to people who use a VPN to watch it is pretty reasonable in my opinion. I'm sure it hasn't stopped anyone in the US on this thread from watching the new season and it's kept the cost of content low for Netflix. I'm down with that.  But yeah, essentially I agree with you. It seems dumb not to make everything available for everyone without all this shady-gray area-VPN stuff. Maybe one day."

ArcherFX,37rv0h,jt_hans,-6,Sat May 30 02:25:37 2015 UTC,Not quite. If you are using free Hola you are running the equivalent of a Tor exit node. If you are not comfortable with this or don't know what it means don't use it(or find out what it is I suppose).
ArcherFX,37rv0h,disturbedfood,0,Sat May 30 03:04:51 2015 UTC,"OR you haven't done your research. If you don't pay for the premium Hola service, you are an exit node for possible illicit activities meaning YOU could be paying the price for other people's bad activities."

It gave Archer some serious character building and it let them do some crazy shit that wouldn't have worked with isis. They also needed to change that name after all the Islamic isis crap, so they mixed it up.   Try smoking some herb and watching it again. It's not supposed to be a serious show.

ArcherFX,37z032,WorkingReddit,-5,Sun May 31 16:39:53 2015 UTC,"I'm just perplexed about what happened behind the scenes to change the show so much.

Not unlike the 50 y/o dad that caught a game winning touchdown in a high school football game over 30 years ago but keeps referencing that one night.    I loved Vice. It gave Archer some serious character building and it let them do some crazy shit that wouldn't have worked with isis.... It's not supposed to be a serious show. You're supposed to watch it, laugh, and move on with your life.    the irony - the entire reason I don't like this season as much is because it is trying to do things like build characters. tell me jokes instead, I don't watch Archer for the plot.

I think Archer was honestly at a weird point where they were aware of their success, but they didn't know exactly how to handle it.

Typically we work full 40-hour weeks from june-march (one full 13-episode production season). Depending on the schedule there can be a lot of overtime or none. During those off months we sometimes have side-projects at the studio (DVD extras, twitter pics, new pilots, etc) but sometimes a portion of the staff has to take an unpaid break, which is no fun for anyone and usually results in a bunch of artists on the show look for freelance projects to fill in the gaps."

I know Stephen (one of lead illustrators on archer) has a print shop online: http://www.artofstephens.com/shop/  Beth, another senior illustrator, advertises commissions on her tumblr: http://offcolored.tumblr.com/ (she recently did a bunch for cheap to help pay for her mom's medical bills)  I will say, if there's an artist you like, please don't hesitate to ask them about commissions. We all like a little extra income, and in some cases it can be a real life saver. And while sometimes prices might seem high, you should hopefully always get what you pay for and will hopefully find it to be a really unique and rewarding experience."

One way is that FX has seen the pilot, and they liked it and have ordered the show. That is unlikely. We're not even done making the pilot yet, though they have certainly seen the script and storyboards and all that. The other, and more likely interpretation, is that FX has literally ordered the pilot. As in, they have paid to make a pilot episode. That is actually factually correct.   So, all I can really say is that I'm working on this pilot and it may or may not get picked up. But thus far I think the pilot is pretty great, so I hope the series gets greenlit."

The “Cassius & Clay” animated pilot hails from Megan Ganz (“Modern Family” and “Community”) and “Archer” creator Adam Reed of Floyd County Productions. Both will serve as writers and exec producers on the FX Productions project.  Described as an animated action-buddy-comedy centered on two women living as bandits in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic America, the A-list voice cast includes “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” star Kaitlin Olson and Lake Bell (“Childrens Hospital”), as the title characters, Ordwood Cassius and Shopcarter Clay. Cassius (Olson) is a hard-drinking, quick-thinking, fast-talking bull-sh-tter who has more debts than sense, and Clay (Bell) is the fastest gun in the post-apocalyptic South who doesn’t go looking for trouble, she shares a station wagon with it.  Susan Sarandon is also a series regular with Jeffrey Tambor, JB Smoove, Kevin Michael Richardson, Stephen Root, Katy Mixon and Robert Patrick all lending their voices to the comedy.  Floyd County Productions, under an overall deal with the network, is behind hit “Archer” and former FX animated series “Chozen” and “Unsupervised.”*  I'm sold!"
ArcherFX,37hgmx,guitarpick8120,3,Thu May 28 23:45:14 2015 UTC,This is gonna be fucking great. Megan Ganz was a critical part of the best seasons of Community.
ArcherFX,37hgmx,j1mb0,2,Wed May 27 21:54:02 2015 UTC,"I agree. I was disappointed when I read she was leaving Community for Modern Family. I don't watch MF very often, but you can't deny that the writing is top-notch. From all I've seen before and after her arrival, she seemed to enter the writing group in-stride.   Excited to see what she can do with this."
ArcherFX,37hgmx,guitarpick8120,3,Wed May 27 22:19:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this cast, group of creators and network is really a dream team."
ArcherFX,37hgmx,twalker294,2,Wed May 27 22:22:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Plus, that premise and diversity of character-types should allow for such a wide variety of hijinks and kerfuffles. Bully good all around!"

ArcherFX,37djb4,Megmca,5,Wed May 27 00:24:28 2015 UTC,I kind of wish there was an option to translate the foreign language lines.  The only reason I could tell what Framboise said to Barry is that I took French back in high school.
ArcherFX,37djb4,0hnoesazombie,10,Wed May 27 02:09:14 2015 UTC,So what does she say? That's figuratively killing me not knowing.
ArcherFX,37djb4,Megmca,13,Wed May 27 02:16:02 2015 UTC,"Well Barry says something like, ""Take my heart!  Take everything!""  And she says something like, ""Your heart?  You have no heart!""  And then he says, ""How is this my fault?"" Because he literally found his girlfriend getting anal from a guy she met like two hours ago."
ArcherFX,37djb4,JafBot,11,Wed May 27 02:41:33 2015 UTC,I thought that whole scene was in English. Am I subconsciously fluent in French?
ArcherFX,37djb4,athenieus,4,Wed May 27 11:46:03 2015 UTC,Must be. I just watched it again yesterday and I speak dick all French so I have no idea what she said to Barry.

ArcherFX,37djb4,Riccars,19,Wed May 27 10:12:56 2015 UTC,Do they ask you for the script for closed captions or is it part of whatever netflix deal is made to get the show on the service?
ArcherFX,37djb4,Protomancer,28,Tue May 26 22:09:54 2015 UTC,"I think that's a process the show goes through when its handed off to FX. I'm kinda talking through my ass here since that part of the production is a bit of a mystery to a lot of us. But I imagine there's probably a company that specializes in taking the shooting script and timing it for the closed captions. It's on the DVDs, Blurays and live on television the day it airs."
ArcherFX,37djb4,Shulerbop,5,Tue May 26 22:21:51 2015 UTC,"Not sure about TV, but in film, the Producer (aka production company) has to deliver a timed transcript with just about all 'sales' to foreign distributors, or when you sell TV rights, as part of your 'deliverables'.   They might farm this out to an independent company, but thats just a waste of money, considering it takes 3x runtime at max. Just copying and pasting from shooting script with some adjustments, and typing in timecode. Granted, you do have to ask your editor for a copy with hardcoded timestamp if you don't want to run an editing program.  Film school may have lied to me, though."
ArcherFX,37djb4,Protomancer,5,Wed May 27 03:08:38 2015 UTC,"If so, I have an entirely new level of appreciation for our editor. That's some tedious business. It's also good to hear from someone with experience in the film world, too. Thanks!"
ArcherFX,37djb4,bort_sampson,3,Wed May 27 03:46:54 2015 UTC,"TV editor here. Can confirm this is more or less the process.   Granted I've mostly worked on ""unscripted"" TV (read: reality) so there's no actual script, meaning the poor transcriber has to watch, listen, and type EVERYTHING, rather than just time out the script and make adjustments here and there.  But this is usually farmed out to people who specialize in this process (though some post houses employ people to do the job).   Thankfully as the editor all I have to do is prep the episode to get delivered to that person. And even then, it's usually passed off to the assistant editors. Those guys are the REAL heroes."
ArcherFX,37djb4,CircularMatrix,49,Wed May 27 12:39:00 2015 UTC,"This has nothing to do with Netflix and everything to do with Archer.  If you watch it on Amazon with the subtitles on, it will do the same.  Think of it this way, the Archer writers are far more funny/baddass than you thought."

ArcherFX,37djb4,El_Barto555,1 point,Wed May 27 09:34:54 2015 UTC,Netflix can run on devices that don't offer Silverlight like Linux PCs woithout a problem. Somewhere is a setting that lets you choose from HTML5 and Silverlight.

ArcherFX,3756ix,cyph3x,1 point,Mon May 25 20:40:40 2015 UTC,"Ben Wa balls:       Not to be confused with Baoding balls  Ben Wa balls, also known as Burmese bells, Orgasm balls, rin-no-tama, Venus balls or Geisha balls (Chinese: 阴道球; pinyin: yīndàoqiú ""vagina ball"", or Chinese: 内用球; pinyin: nèiyòngqiú ""internal-use ball""), are small, marble-sized balls, usually hollow and containing a small weight, that roll around and are used for sexual stimulation (by insertion into the vagina). Available in a variety of forms, the balls may be solid, or contain clappers or chimes within. Other, larger versions made of plastic encasing lesser balls are called Duotone balls. They are used by inserting them into the vagina and using the Kegel muscles to hold them in, stimulating movement and/or vibration. Ben Wa balls should not be confused with anal kegel exercisers and prostate stimulators for men: Ben Wa balls sometimes have a retrieval string or attachment of some sort, but they do not have an adequately flared base for safe anal play.   Ben Wa balls have a varied history; their origin and method of construction varies depending upon location. Most information concerning Ben Wa balls is vague and probably apocryphal. Originally they were made of a single ball placed in the vagina, used to enhance the act of coitus, but then evolved into multiple metal covered balls linked by either a chain or silk string for easy removal. Usage of Ben Wa balls creates a subtle stimulation, not meant to bring the user to immediate orgasm but rather to tease. It is possible to leave Ben Wa balls in one's vagina all day, or use them while seated in a rocking chair,  for an effect that some find pleasurable.    Image i - Gold-toned Ben Wa balls.

ArcherFX,374tsv,wizdumb,27,Sun May 24 21:57:14 2015 UTC,"Today I made true Eggs Woodhouse, complete with black truffle, beluga caviar, Pata Negra ham, Kashmiri saffron, and artichoke bottoms. Bloody marys and toast with lemon curd were also made, but not shown here. Video of the process is coming soon!  Edit: Photo-evidence of Bloody Mary from my wife's Instagram."
ArcherFX,374tsv,_doom,3,Sun May 24 21:59:08 2015 UTC,Beluga is illegal. I'm guessing you used something like paddle fish based on the price you listed below.
ArcherFX,374tsv,_doom,6,Mon May 25 22:16:02 2015 UTC,"I used caviar from USA farm-raised white sturgeon, which is not only perfectly legal, but also sustainable and less expensive."
ArcherFX,374tsv,fok_ye,2,Mon May 25 22:41:58 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that's where the extra fishy taste came from. The US farm raised white sturgeon, albeit more sustainable for the earth and wallet, typically don't have the maturity of a good osetra. The white sturgeon caviar I've had is typically harvested from 2-3 year old fish, compared to the 5-7 that a good osetra is taken from. I'd also highly recommend Iranian osetra in addition to the Russian, it's got the right about of illegality to it to really make it enjoyable. Let's be honest here, I'm sure Archer would rather have the illegal stuff."

ArcherFX,374tsv,geobloke,2,Mon May 25 16:39:12 2015 UTC,Impatience and lack of fine motor control are the major stumbling blocks to good poached eggs.

ArcherFX,374tsv,Timmeh7,10,Mon May 25 04:50:34 2015 UTC,I haven't really done the math for the whole shebang since it took a few days to track down all of the ingredients. I still have a lot of the truffle ($20/1oz) left and maybe half of the caviar ($45/1oz). It might have only come out to about $35 per plate?
ArcherFX,374tsv,Decalance,7,Mon May 25 07:13:05 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that seems almost reasonable, I was expecting a lot more!"
ArcherFX,374tsv,grannaldie,7,Mon May 25 07:54:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, I forgot about the Pata Negra, which was also about $20/oz. Still, it's not $130/plate like the recipe suggests."
ArcherFX,374tsv,Helenius,2,Mon May 25 18:34:23 2015 UTC,That's also super cheap caviar. Probably paddle fish. A good Russian osetra should be at least 90 an Oz.
ArcherFX,374tsv,geobloke,-14,Mon May 25 22:15:31 2015 UTC,Almost ? I can make a breakfast meal for one dollar
ArcherFX,374tsv,ram3489,12,Mon May 25 09:01:04 2015 UTC,"So can anyone, but probably not containing black truffle and caviar.  Point being, most people would likely expect to pay more for a dish comprising these ingredients, regardless of how much it costs you to make toast."

ArcherFX,374tsv,grannaldie,11,Mon May 25 02:06:29 2015 UTC,"It was pretty good, but there things I would do differently. The caviar added a hint of fishy-ness that didn't really play along with the other flavors. We tried both fresh and canned artichoke bottoms and the fresh were way better. The canned artichokes were much more acidic and overpowering."

ArcherFX,3751uh,scaredog20,3,Mon May 25 00:27:17 2015 UTC,It's definitely possible - we know that Krieger isn't opposed to cutting corners (like how he made Katya out of soviet parts to save $80). But also on that note - would Krieger have given Conway the other hand after Lana cut it off at the beginning of season 6?
ArcherFX,3751uh,sc13998,2,Mon May 25 06:46:31 2015 UTC,"But we also know that Katya's skin was 'hobo' So it could just be that the skin that he ""found"" for covering the had was from a black guy."

ArcherFX,373ra9,TheDarkHorse83,4,Tue May 26 08:35:59 2015 UTC,"The magic bullet was perfect because they were making fun of themselves with that one. But I still think that the best Brett moment was at Archer and Katya's second wedding when the lights are out and Archer is trying to track Barry in the dark to kill him: A: ""Brett?! I thought you were dead!"" B: ""No, just hurt really really badly Although not nearly as badly as I am now."" M: ""You better not be bleeding on my carpet!"" B: ""No, pretty sure I’m all out of blood.""  The way that 'Brett' (Neal Holman) delivered that last line cracks me up every time."
ArcherFX,373ra9,Urixevom,3,Tue May 26 13:41:01 2015 UTC,That was a fantastic read (the voice acting on this show is superb) but Archer's line about feeling like they were the Warren Commission makes the magic bullet my personal favourite. To each their own.

I thought it was way too similar to Archer that I thought Archer might be an homage.  I didn't know how to put all that into a title.    That being said, I'm probably wrong and it's just a coincidence.  But PA is/was pretty popular for a while and I know several of my friends used to make PA references for years.  It's not entirely improbable that their humor influenced Archer's writers.  Or it's a common enough comedic motif but I haven't happened across it much.  Or it's just a coincidence.  Either way, I still think it's funny, worth sharing, and at least evokes an Archer-ey feel."

ArcherFX,36qhyw,alfa96,33,Thu May 21 09:05:28 2015 UTC,I am not sure about the streaming question.   There is no huge archplot; each episode is able to stand on it's own however you may miss some recurring and subtle jokes if you watch them out of order.
ArcherFX,36qhyw,Simbrian,3,Thu May 21 09:35:20 2015 UTC,Not true for archer vice. And quite a few of the other seasons has 2-parters as well.
ArcherFX,36qhyw,TheDanishPencil,1 point,Sun May 24 02:04:33 2015 UTC,Even if it's a multi-part episode it's not hard to figure out what the characters are up to.
ArcherFX,36qhyw,Simbrian,13,Sun May 24 02:20:22 2015 UTC,"I think you can watch episodes on the network's website the following day.  Every so often they will do a multi-part episode. Archer Vice was a 1 season long story line. For the most part, episodes are stand alone. However, there are several stories that happen across the seasons, an episode here and there - like Archer v. Barry. More and more, the relationships, interactions, and inside jokes will carry from episode to episode."
ArcherFX,36qhyw,RogerDeanVenture,7,Thu May 21 09:35:25 2015 UTC,"As you know Seasons 1-5 are available on Netflix, but Season 6 just finished up a few weeks ago. It's not yet on Netflix, but done airing. I think that you should be able to find them on Amazon Prime, maybe the network's site... There's a few people here who use some of the online tools to watch the show, maybe they can help clear it up.  Unless it's a multi-parter (they will be explicit about that, too ie- Heart of Archness Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3) then the show can stand on it's own. Though as the seasons roll on they are making more and more inside jokes and references to older episodes. Missing them doesn't take away from the plot or humor of the show, but catching them does add a whole lot."
ArcherFX,36qhyw,TheDarkHorse83,12,Thu May 21 12:11:25 2015 UTC,"I'd watch them in order, but even if you don't, you'll catch all the recurring stuff on rewatches. And you will rewatch."

ArcherFX,36qhyw,jjdlg,2,Thu May 21 12:50:57 2015 UTC,"FX uploads episodes on their site from what I know  There's not really a giant plot for the first few seasons, Archer Vice (S5) is pretty much the only one tho and there are some running gags from past episodes but otherwise it's really easy to jump into. The show's so damn funny that stuff that might not make sense at first is still funny as hell"
ArcherFX,36qhyw,ook1718,1 point,Fri May 22 14:50:47 2015 UTC,"Tubeplus.me (redirects to tubeplus.is or something) streams a lot of shows. They get DCMA'd all the time so while it's not watching pirated torrents, it's nearly the same thing. Still, when ya gotta watch...  Archer has a lot of full-season story arcs...but don't worry, each episode is hilarious in itself."
ArcherFX,36qhyw,privated1ck,2,Thu May 21 13:25:45 2015 UTC,"Not advocating it, but at that point watchcartoononline is marginally better. It's definitely a last resort though, the legal services are generally far higher quality."

ArcherFX,36qhyw,XeverSeven,1 point,Thu May 21 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"In the US, the latest episodes are definitely available the next day after they air on Amazon streaming (for a fee, of course).  I have also heard they are available on iTunes but don't have firsthand experience.  Most episodes are stand-alone enough to be totally worthwhile, but there are a lot of running jokes and recurring themes/characters that are more enjoyable if you can watch them all.  There are a few long-term plotlines, but still nothing that makes the individual episodes unworthy on their own.  The show is still totally awesome even if you can't binge-watch it."
ArcherFX,36qhyw,giggleworm,1 point,Thu May 21 15:18:36 2015 UTC,"In addition to iTunes and Amazon, as mentioned below, you can also purchase the latest season on Google Play.   I bought access to the season about a week before it premiered, though unfortunately I can't remember how much it cost. I think somewhere in the neighborhood of $35-40 for the HD version. You can also purchase the SD version for less, if you want to save money or don't care about getting it in HD.  After an episode airs for the first time, I'm able to watch it on my phone/tablet/computer/Chromecast within 24 hours.  Hope this helps, and enjoy!"

ArcherFX,36kwm9,PerfectlyNormal77,11,Wed May 20 03:29:13 2015 UTC,"They may have succeeded in their first three missions, but they still bungled them:  -Plane in the jungle: the plane was destroyed, but we don't know if Archer actually got the computer. He just grabbed a computery-looking thing out of the cockpit. And was nearly caught by the rebels. And nearly got taken out by an elderly Japanese soldier. And never bothered to read the dossier.  -Conway Stern: Yes, they prevented Conway from getting the agent list, but their entry into the building was ""Archerized"", so not really all that stealthy. Good bet that there was some sort of fallout from the incident.  -The assassin in the Alps: No confirmed kill. The Interpol agents were all killed and their deaths could have been avoided if Archer had brought along the dossier.  In fact, how many missions over the course of the series has the ISIS team managed to complete successfully? My bet is that their success rate has dropped as time has gone on."
ArcherFX,36kwm9,PerfectlyNormal77,2,Wed May 20 17:55:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, oh, oh, wait, I see what you are saying, now. I misunderstood, initially, what your point was.  I still think that there never being any mention of the computer being wrong or the assassin living or anything related to... --- wait wait wait.. No, remember, when Slater picked up Archer and Lana after Conway shot Archer, the only thing Slater asked was if they got the disk. That was all he cared about"
ArcherFX,36kwm9,Thetford34,3,Wed May 20 20:11:00 2015 UTC,"Technically, they did get the disk and foil Conway. But it wasn't exactly...discreet. Or professional.  Archer tranqed or beat up quite a few guards, Conway got his other hand ripped off, Archer was shot multiple times in the back, and Conway got away.  The primary mission was accomplished, but man was it sloppy. And the CIA would TOTALLY focus on the methods used rather than the results."
ArcherFX,36kwm9,Kriegerbot01,-1,Wed May 20 20:46:18 2015 UTC,"Nah, your analysis is off. You say 'they still bungled them"" but then suggest that we dont know what happened with ""computer"".. The MISSION was to blow up plane and get ""computer"". He returned with that device. Do you think that it just would have been not spoken of if it was not the right thing?... You say ""not really all that stealthy"", as if that matters, one bit, which it doesn't. You think the CIA would care about a sloppy entrance that did no harm and enabled them to keep the identity of every south american agent secret? Makes no sense.... The MISSION was to secure that data, nothing more, once his being a double agent was realized....Assassin. I already said not confirmed, but they said he was killed. You are trying to add the variable that the CIA gives a sh!t about anything but their goal. You think the CIA cares about Interpol agents? Not a chance. The MISSION was to take out the assasin.... Accomplished, as far as the CIA knew....My statement is accurate, yours is not... You are adding hypotheticals where you shouldn't, resulting in flawed logic. There was no mention that they failed any of the first three missions, only evidence to the contrary. So injecting anything contradictory is manufacturing nonsense.... This may have come off more standoffish, than intended. I am an aspie, I just ""speak"" matter of factly, is all, no offense intended"
ArcherFX,36kwm9,Kriegerbot01,6,Wed May 20 19:45:29 2015 UTC,"Just went over the episode list. They were 50%. The missions they failed were the royals in ep9, the Wales brothers in ep11, and then the final mission in the last two episodes. The rest of the episodes didn't include missions."
ArcherFX,36kwm9,PowerSystemsGuy,3,Wed May 20 08:12:24 2015 UTC,"A similar ""inconsistency"" in the two parter I found is that Slater says the reason Pam and Cheryl are briefed in the mission is because they always mange to stow away, despite neither doing it once while he has known them."

S03E01, Heart of Archness Pt 1, she's on the private jet with Lana and Ray, taking Ray's extravagant food order (""and this chocolate terrine looks insaaaaaaaane!"").   Also note that in the pilot, she has a ping-pong paddle print on her ass, the paddle is lying between them, and Archer makes a joke about giving him 5 minutes on his backhand. Ping-pong paddles also come up many other times in the future, almost always red in color.   In Space Race, there's one floating around in zero gravity after Archer's quickie with Pam (it covers her nipples). In Skorpio, Mallory mentions spanking Archer with a wooden spoon, to which Lana replies, ""it might explain the ping pong paddle..."" During Archer Vice, La Madrina is standing over Archer with a riding crop in hand, and he's holding a ping pong paddle. When Archer quits ISIS during Job Offer, his box of personal effects contains a ping pong paddle. In Honeypot, Archer comes out of his bedroom asking Woodhouse is they have any lube, only to find Mallory in his living room. He's in a small white towel, yellow rubber gloves, a catcher's mask, and holding a green ping pong paddle. In a flashback, a young Sterling is wearing a party hat and crying. Mallory pulls out a ping pong paddle with which to spank him. Image EDIT: Bonus reference!

ArcherFX,36bvp8,Protoford,3,Mon May 18 08:33:07 2015 UTC,"My final presentation for one of my classes involved Eric Cartman's rendition of ""In the Ghetto"" and me giving the presentation doing my Eric Cartman impersonation. It's nice when you can get away with something like that, isn't it?"
ArcherFX,36bvp8,no-fun-at-parties,7,Mon May 18 18:54:32 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be important to watch some bond if you want to understand archer. It's become less of a bond parody as its gone on, but it started out parodying bond quite a bit. Archer being an asshole is 100% inspired by bond."
ArcherFX,36bvp8,2th,5,Mon May 18 14:12:15 2015 UTC,"I have left reddit for Voat due to years of admin mismanagement and preferential treatment for certain subreddits and users holding certain political and ideological views.    The situation has gotten especially worse since the appointment of Ellen Pao as CEO, culminating in the seemingly unjustified firings of several valuable employees.    As an act of protest, I have chosen to redact all the comments I've ever made on reddit, overwriting them with this message.    If you would like to do the same, install TamperMonkey for Chrome, GreaseMonkey for Firefox, NinjaKit for Safari, Violent Monkey for Opera, or AdGuard for Internet Explorer (in Advanced Mode), then add this GreaseMonkey script.     Finally, click on your username at the top right corner of reddit, click on comments, and click on the new OVERWRITE button at the top of the page. You may need to scroll down to multiple comment pages if you have commented a lot.    After doing all of the above, you are welcome to join me on Voat!"
ArcherFX,36bvp8,Diskourai,3,Mon May 18 13:08:10 2015 UTC,I'd love to read a copy of this :)
ArcherFX,36bvp8,theworldbystorm,5,Mon May 18 15:34:11 2015 UTC,I don't trust salmon...  but PM me an email and I'll see about it
ArcherFX,36bvp8,EitherBarry,3,Mon May 18 20:13:33 2015 UTC,Phrasing!
ArcherFX,36bvp8,Polterghost,2,Mon May 18 22:17:45 2015 UTC,"Didn't notice which sub this was from, I thought it was a Mad Men-related article about Sterling Cooper."
ArcherFX,36bvp8,IAMA_BAD_MAN_AMA,2,Mon May 18 15:31:47 2015 UTC,Please post the entire thing and let us know how you did with it! I am sure the Floyd County guys would also be interested in knowing!
ArcherFX,36bvp8,lajouissance,1 point,Mon May 18 16:13:15 2015 UTC,"I'm very interested and would love to give input. Given how late I am, I may not be able to help, but would love to read it."
ArcherFX,36agnh,greasywiener,13,Sun May 17 19:34:14 2015 UTC,"So as a big old-school country fan, I was impressed by Archer Vice's music while watching, but never listened to songs in their entirety.  The music is actually pretty incredible, I'm surprised at how much effort was put into it, listenable even if you knew nothing about Archer.  Amazing blend of outlaw country (WOOO!!!), bluegrass, old-school country-rock like Hank Jr, someone who knew their country music was behind this."
ArcherFX,36agnh,wattsghost,7,Sun May 17 19:44:30 2015 UTC,"I always go to greasywiener for my music reviews. And once again, he nails it."

ArcherFX,36agnh,kowboytrav,7,Sun May 17 21:49:29 2015 UTC,"I've been really curious about who's actually singing, but my amateur google-fu skills have failed me. Any chance someone can help me out?"
ArcherFX,36agnh,ashleton,9,Sun May 17 23:56:40 2015 UTC,Her name is Jessy Lynn Martens. She's also a hell of a fiddler.
ArcherFX,36agnh,taelor,8,Mon May 18 01:34:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  OUTLAW COUNTRY!  Ahem. Pardon me, it slipped."
ArcherFX,36agnh,grannaldie,3,Mon May 18 01:46:08 2015 UTC,The gta style cover is pretty awesome

ArcherFX,3697x1,seedzero,23,Mon May 18 01:40:16 2015 UTC,Really wish the mods would start deleting bullshit posts like this. Getting pretty close to unsubscribing this subreddit.
