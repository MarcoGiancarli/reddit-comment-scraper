FoggyPics,3c1w5s,FISH_HAVE_LEGS,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:13:35 2015 UTC,What a gorgeous picture. Makes me ready for fall to be here.
FoggyPics,3c0bl2,rubystarfruit,2,Fri Jul 3 16:40:57 2015 UTC,Wow. That sculpture fits perfectly with the mysterious atmosphere cast by a nice fog. It kinda looks like an alien artifact :)
FoggyPics,3bxqph,FISH_HAVE_LEGS,2,Fri Jul 3 00:53:34 2015 UTC,why are all the lights on at the same time?
FoggyPics,3bxqph,PScan69,6,Fri Jul 3 04:29:11 2015 UTC,Its an extended exposure.  so instead of the shutter being open for a fraction of a second it was probably open for minutes maybe hours. So all light that ever happened in the frame is all there.
FoggyPics,3bxqph,siren123,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:04:47 2015 UTC,You'd think that the yellow lights would be dimmer since yellow is usually on for a shorter period of time then red or green.
FoggyPics,3bxqph,Hypersapien,6,Tue Jul 21 15:06:29 2015 UTC,"whomever took this used show shutter photography.  edit: whoops! seems like i was wrong, refer to /u/siren123 comment for the correct answer."
