Definitely comedic though, that actor is great. Tony and being ""the kid on the school bus."" Feel like he says that about his relationship with Janice too.

What I love about this show is how no character acts in an over-the-top manner, and watching them converse is like watching everyday people converse. Compare that to Breaking Bad. As great it was, there was a lot of histrionics going on in that show."

They all had their own (at least partially) developed friends, family friends, distant relatives, and neighbors. They attended funerals, weddings, birthday parties, and school functions.

thesopranos,3e4v3r,kds405,3,Wed Jul 22 03:07:12 2015 UTC,"I think Livia got a more nuanced treatment as a character. In several scenes where she is talking with Junior (Corrado), there was a distinct glimpse of her personality being an act. She used her overbearing mannerisms to manipulate. Janice had a touch of this, but her personality seemed much less of an act and more genuinely her. She wasn't putting on an act just to manipulate, she was just really that way.  A huge theme of the show was the conflict between wanting to get away from the demands of The Life versus being addicted to it and its rewards. It seemed like Livia used her manipulative ways to get the most out of Johnny and later out of Tony and Junior. This was her tried and true method of exerting power.  Janice tried to escape the life by moving fast away but found herself right back. (Just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in, as Sil would quote.)  Tony, Junior, and probably Johnny never took Janice seriously so she had to create a place for herself in The Life.  I can't say I liked Janice but I could respect that she used what she had to get what she could.   I always hated AJ much, much more than Janice."

First episode with dream sequences and a unique way to end a season.  S3: University. The most chilling episode of the series and the first time we saw how much of a psychopath Ralphie really was.  S4: Whitecaps. The fights between Tony and Carmela felt like the most violent moments in the show in a show full of beatings and whackings.  S5: Long Term Parking. My personal favourite of the series. Greatest character death of all time.  S6A: Members Only. Started Tony's coma arc.  S6B: The Blue Comet. 99% of the New York story moved forward in this episode and you can really feel things coming to an end. And that ending with Tony lying on his bed with his M4...

Soprano Home Movies, Blue Comet, Made in America all had a good shot as well. And ""Whoever did this"" would probably beat a few of the other episodes I picked, but nothing stands a chance against Whitecaps for me."
thesopranos,3dw6qp,richshaugh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:57:30 2015 UTC,"Great picks. Surprised more people haven't picked College. And yeah, 6B is a tough one. Probably my favourite season. I feel the same way about Whitecaps and Whoever Did This, but reversed. Whitecaps is probably in the top 5 Sopranos episodes, but Whoever Did This is in the top 1."
thesopranos,3dw6qp,UniversalPolymath,3,Mon Jul 20 04:22:20 2015 UTC,"I'm expected to come here and see Isabella and College be every single answer, and I would probably have picked Boca just to give it some representation, but then I saw it was just one other person with College so I had to answer honestly.  Yeah, Whoever Did This is probably about tied with Kennedy and Heidi for me. I just really love how they take these huge, shocking, climactic deaths that most people would have seen all the foreshadowing for and exchanged the obvious shock value for a more insightful look at the impact. Both happen pretty early in their episodes, and both are brought about by very mundane circumstances, and I can't think of any other show that would dare handle a death like that. (BB I guess sort of did but the Jane thing was built up more within the episode and she wasn't nearly as big a character as Ralph or Chris)."

I watched this with a friend who had never seen The Sopranos the other day, he came to my house while I was watching it and it was difficult to explain to him that we normally root for Tony/Silvio/Chris after watching this episode.   Season 6a: Mayham: The scene with Tony at the Inn at the Oaks was haunting  Season 6b: Sopranos Home Movies although not by much so many good episodes in that final run.  Season 3 and Season 5 were also difficult to pick .The ones I picked were almost obviously the best episodes in those seasons (in my opinion), but Employee of the Month, Irregular Around the Margins, Second Opinion were all great episodes from their respective seasons.

It could've been a straight mob-drama for six years, and it would've been a hell of a ride (episodes like The Blue Comet demonstrate just how kick-ass that would've been), but it's the everyday ""human"" moments that really burrow into your brain and stick with you.   Those are the moments that make the big explosive developments worth any damn at all, because Chase and Co. took the time to get you invested in a cast of characters as relatable and true-to-life as any you've ever seen on-screen. Other shows would come later that are much more explicitly violent (Breaking Bad, Boardwalk), but The Sopranos understood that real impact doesn't come from just seeing a characters' face exploding; a beloved character could die completely off-screen, and it hit harder than anything just because the show allowed enough breathing room to let us get to know her."

Those just naturally tend to be the most memorable. Pine Barrens is memorable for completely different reasons. It's like a fairly self-contained short-film (definitely enhanced by prior knowledge of all the characters and how they relate to each other, of course), and it's funny as hell.  It's not my favorite - and the ones that I appreciate more, I appreciate a great deal more. But this one's probably a top-ten or so for me."

thesopranos,3drr8h,FranksTarantula89,9,Sat Jul 18 20:46:42 2015 UTC,"I understand that he had cancer so whatever tough guy persona he may have had probably faded fast as the disease took his toll on him, but even in the flashback episode to 1995 in the third season something about his character just didn't fit.    I don't think he was really fully developed as a character. His purpose in the show seems to be to cause Tony existential angst. Tony is distressed that such a ""strong, beautiful man"" could just whither away, losing all dignity, serving no greater cause. The writers probably thought of Jackie S in those terms originally. And then with the flashback they probably just didn't think to change his personality for whatever reason.  But really not everyone born into that life or caught up in it has to fit the stereotypical mob persona. Bobby didn't seem particularly cut out for the life either(Edit: although the scene where he makes thinly veiled threats to the union official almost convinced me otherwise.) But it's probably all they know. It's conceivable to me that that's the case with some real mobsters as well. But who knows I guess."
thesopranos,3drr8h,nofknziti,2,Sat Jul 18 21:29:47 2015 UTC,"I guess you just don't see enough of him.  Alot of times when I watch Patsy Parisi, I think there's no way he's a mobster.  Then he has the ""cinematic"" scene with Gloria and I think ok, maybe this guy is kind of a bad-ass.  Also, on a related note, Bobby Bacala... does he really ever do anything that seems like a tough guy?  I mean aside from his wrestling around with Tony."
thesopranos,3drr8h,NeroFiddles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:50 2015 UTC,"I think they created the character of Jackie Sr. for a reason. Essentially, the show is about Tony becoming the boss and slowly cracking under the pressure put on him by the position.  Jackie Sr. is portrayed as level-headed, well-liked and respected. No one in the show really questioned his position as the leader, even though his best friend Tony is an actual member of the Soprano family from which the gang derives its name.   I think they included Jackie Sr.'s character to show Tony was not actually meant to be the boss, but rather became the boss due to circumstance. Had Jackie Sr. not died, maybe Tony would have remained the lovable character we saw in Season 1 because he would have never experienced the pressure of being the boss.  I think my theory is further evidenced by how they portray Sylvio. When Tony gets shot, Sylvio assumes the role of boss and is immediately overwhelmed by the pressures of the job. On a few occasions, he regrets taking the position and awaits Tony's recovery so he can return to his position of number 2 in the crew.  Everything I am saying, of course, is speculation, but it seems clear that Tony's downfall comes as a result of his role as boss. I always though Jackie Sr. seemed like a better boss and I think the writers intended it to look that way."

thesopranos,3deffb,gyang333,14,Thu Jul 16 14:06:34 2015 UTC,"That's the point. The show was saying that the mob was declining, and certainly the NJ mob was declining. Chase wasn't interested in creating some fantasy-baseball ""dream team"" of all-star top-earners and best-killers or whatever lol. He wanted to show something closer to reality as he saw it, which was an initial sort of ""good times"" (S1-3) which is then followed by a gradual, inevitable fall into nothingness, despair and a general feeling that things aren't what they used to be (S4-6). I mean, Tony expressed that exact sentiment in the very first episode, yet he had it pretty good back then in terms of a reliable and strong crew, when you compare to who he was stuck with at the end of the series.  Pussy was a very strong character but I think it worked out killing him off when they did. I am curious, though, how he'd react to some of the later season's characters and events if he were there. But like I was saying, part of the reason why he was killed off was precisely to illustrate that sense of decline (which becomes more apparent from Funhouse onward). When three guys have to murder their lifelong best friend in cold blood, you know shit's gone downhill. So while it was sad to see Pussy go (Pastore was one of the more authentic of the actors playing mobsters, along with Sirico as Paulie), the way his ghost quite literally haunted the subsequent episodes and revealed more of Tony's own psychology was very effective.  By the way, I always have hated Palmice and never bought that an old-school guy like Junior would like him and trust him so much. He came off as an unreliable, psychopathic (in a bad-for-business way), disrespectful, slimy little douche. And that was in S1, too; already you saw clear signs that the younger generation of mobsters weren't nearly as savvy as their elders."

Just like federal indictments are hanging over the heads of the captains throughout the series they are constantly facing obstacles because the life they live isn't supposed to be sustainable. Without these key conflicts The Sopranos is no longer the same great show.

They're either on drugs or they're compromised with law or they're young and they don't listen to orders.'   Tony is aware that he doesn't have the strongest crew. In Italy Tony says to Annalisa (acting mob boss) 'A lot of guys today, they become soft living in America. One in five guys they're a fucking rat. Can't find anyone that believes in the old ways, keeping silent, putting the family first.' This is why he ends up recruiting Furio - 'they have ties to nobody over there (America), they'll belong to me 110%'    And even Furio didn't turn out how he wished, Tony ends up doubting almost everybody towards the end of the series, even Paulie. I think this is one of the themes that runs throughout every season that Tony can't really trust anybody."

thesopranos,3dcgl2,K3R3G3,3,Wed Jul 15 04:40:48 2015 UTC,"Great post. I'm especially interested in your ideas about how the editing could signify that these fantasies are happening from his bed. I love Isabella - it's one of season one's strongest - but the revelation about Isabella at the end has never quite sat right with me. I've never been on a strong dosage of Lithium, but the whole twist felt a bit too artificial/conventional-TV-ish for me. A rare misstep.  Your take is much easier to swallow, though, and one I'd gladly subscribe to. The only sticking point is that there's actually a third interaction between them that you didn't address - their first one, actually - in which Tony meets her in the Cusamanos' backyard to return an article of clothing that had blown off her clothesline. Cut from there to Tony leaving the driveway with Chris tailing him to his therapy appointment.  This does betray the idea that every interaction is interrupted in a similar fashion, but I don't think that necessarily means you're wrong about what we could glean from the other two. All of this is entirely speculative, but we could say Tony did initially wander into the neighbor's yard, only to continue his fantasy from home later. Again, I'm admittedly attracted to this only because it feels a lot more subtle than Tony literally sitting in a restaurant talking to an empty chair - and I've never seen your theory before, which I really appreciate.  Edit: D'oh. Sorry, I just skimmed your post again and saw that you did acknowledge this doesn't apply to the initial meeting. My bad."

thesopranos,3dfr2x,JamesGumb,11,Wed Jul 15 22:37:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think the show promotes Christianity whatsoever - on the contrary, and despite the superficial religiosity of many of its characters, I think the show itself has a certain level of contempt for (the corruptible nature of) organized religious institutions and the inherent fallibility of their ""leaders"".  Furthermore, it's completely wrong to interpret any moral judgment the show may (or may not) make as being rooted in traditional Christianity. The Christian church - and the Bible by extension - has no monopoly on what it means to live an ethical life. I think the message that ""being a bad person backfires"" is far too simplistic an analysis of Chase's intentions anyhow, but even granting that for the sake of conversation, there's no need to assume that message must have a biblical basis.  They treated Vito sympathetically because, despite being a murderer and every bit as reprehensible as everyone else on the show, he was victimized solely based on a characteristic that in no way is immoral in itself and in no way warranted a violent reaction. What happened to Vito demonstrates the outcomes of taking the casual homophobia that's become a staple of the characters' far-right Catholic tradition to their most ugly, hateful conclusions."
thesopranos,3dfr2x,UniversalPolymath,6,Wed Jul 15 23:33:55 2015 UTC,I have no idea what you're talking about. You're probably projecting in which case you should reexamine why you think that way

Tell that to the waiter."
thesopranos,3dfr2x,TonySoprano420,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:51:44 2015 UTC,"Vito was born homosexual. Homosexuality is natural.  What's unnatural is his life being so entrenched in illegal activity, working alongside other criminals whose own insecurities mire them in conflict of the heart. As they try to be successful (alive) in the (bad) path they've chosen, they are constantly having to reconcile their role in ""The Family"" with their personal awakenings and truths. This is the root to Vito's storyline, which highlights the issue of closeted men. If you watch and listen carefully, you'll see that Phil Leotardo has partaken in homosexual acts. He just ""justifies"" it by providing context that in prison, rules are different.  The Sopranos does incorporate a lot of themes which are touched upon in the Bible -- and in all literature, when one really studies the craft and tradition of storytelling.  But the point of not demonizing Vito for being gay is because he should not be demonized for being gay. That's as silly as demonizing him for being Italian, or demonizing you for having a user name so close in resemblance to the serial killer from The Silence of the Lambs' name. The characters who killed Vito in the show, demonized him. Phil Leotardo, ashamed of his own homosexual activity, demonized him, and viciously murdered his own family member, to prove something to himself.  Which begs the question: Why do you think Vito should be demonized?"

Like you say, it's left ambiguous, but I lean toward: yes, the supernatural does exist in the show. It would've been nearly impossible for that psychic to know all that about Paulie, and as far as I remember Tony doesn't even see the Pussy apparition, so it probably isn't his imagination. Also, I think I've heard that the whole Kevin Finnerty thing wasn't meant to be a dream, but then I also heard he may have gotten some of those ""Eastern"" ideas from watching kung-fu movies as a kid..so, I don't know.   I also almost get the feeling sometimes that something like ""God"" may have left the ""I go about in pity for myself"" note in Tony's hospital room, or maybe it was ghost- Livia in her Buddha-form, lol.  If I had to guess though, I'd say the sort-of ""quantum woo"" ideas discussed in Fleshy Part of the Thigh might come closest to the show's ""official stance."""
thesopranos,3d6k2k,nofknziti,8,Mon Jul 13 23:39:34 2015 UTC,"This has always interested me; it's elements like this that set The Sopranos apart and make it such an intriguing show to reflect upon. I think the show's inclusion of such occurrences doesn't mean that it 100% believes in an afterlife or that ghosts exist, but rather is the show acknowledging the many ambiguities and inexplicable happenings in life. Just as the show adheres so much to the mundane and the realistic in the way people talk and act and the way time moves and seasons pass, so too does it attempt to illustrate those odd sensations that you can't quite justify as real but feel too real to brush off -- that shape out of the corner of your eye, finding real life eerily echoing a dream you've had, watching a door closing by itself, or even seeing what seems to be a ghost or apparition. These things do happen in real life, to all different kinds of people regardless of belief, and I think it's included both because it interests Chase and for the aforementioned purpose of verisimilitude. That the show doesn't offer a definitive explanation for these happenings only makes it more true to life, where rarely if ever do we really know much of anything, let alone the answers to the Big Questions. Of course the show does this all the time with story elements, with the Russian's fate, whether Ralph killed Pie, and the series ending being the most famous examples.  Anyway, one of the eeriest and least-discussed of these scenes comes in Calling All Cars, when a wine glass clearly moves of its own accord while Bobby and Janice are eating Karen's last ziti. That whole episode is very spooky and death-haunted. Hell, even some scenes on the show that totally lack any supernatural happening feel eerie and ghostly to me: e.g. the ending of Whoever Did This when Tony leaves the deserted Bing, or earlier in the episode when Chris and Tony spend time in Ralph's house. I've said this before, but I find that the back half of S4 in particular has an especially paranormal or eerie feel to it."
thesopranos,3d6k2k,somerton,5,Tue Jul 14 04:08:21 2015 UTC,"I've heard of this wine glass moving but never seen it. In any case, if I'm Karen, you better believe I'm making a ruckus when Janice fucking Soprano cooks my last ziti making a move on my husband.   And yeah, that final scene in Whoever Did This was so creepy. I never really understood why it was written that way."
thesopranos,3d6k2k,illegal_deagle,5,Tue Jul 14 04:12:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when you think about it Bobby is one of the saddest characters because, though he did willingly marry Janice, he was basically preyed upon by her incessantly during his absolute weakest hour. Also ironic how early in the ep Janice says how she's not gonna tell Bobby to ""suck it up"" or ""get over it"" re: Karen, but before you know it she's forcing him to cave in and eat the ziti in a romantic dinner (not to mention mind-fucking his kids with the Ouji stuff, yeesh).  I think the ending of Whoever Did This, with Tony all alone and in a deserted, silent place, fits nicely with the episode considering how it had pared everything down to the bone over the past hour -- the way it moves to just Tony and Chris, of course, and then everything becomes darker, there is less and less dialogue, and an almost apocalyptic feeling begins to take hold (which arguably doesn't let up for the rest of the series)."
thesopranos,3d6k2k,somerton,2,Tue Jul 14 04:21:46 2015 UTC,"I think the wine glass may have just been a continuity error, but I am a glass half empty guy."
thesopranos,3d6k2k,DermotBologna,2,Tue Jul 14 06:00:47 2015 UTC,"It's not a continuity error. You literally see the glass move across the table on its own, in a single shot. It's not like you see it somewhere in one shot and then when it cuts back it's in another place. Take a look at the scene again and you'll see. (For convenience's sake, the scene occurs around 42 minutes into the episode).  EDIT: I just watched it again, and I remembered wrong in that the glass doesn't move ""across the table"" -- it's a smaller movement, but it's still undeniably there. (Note also the candles: when AJ pranked Bobby's kids with the Ouija board earlier, a candle was lit. That seance was bullshit, whereas this one seems to make Karen appear).  You could argue it's possible that it could be caused by Janice moving her placemat or something on the table that's under the glass (we can't see this because the frame cuts off above that area)... but 1) the movement of the glass is so smooth that it doesn't seem like it's being moved from underneath, plus 2) Janice's right hand, closest to the glass, is holding a fork and it'd be kind of odd for her to do that with her left hand, with her dinner plate in between the left hand and the glass, and 3) the whole episode is so redolent with supernatural stuff that I'm inclined to think it's a very deliberate thing along the lines of Pussy's ghost."
thesopranos,3d6k2k,somerton,2,Tue Jul 14 06:56:58 2015 UTC,"I am going to watch now. I've written this off for a while as continuity error, didn't know it was in a single shot."

Not to mention how the beginning of the shot Bobby looks like he is forced into that situation. Like he is choosing to make a family with Janice against his (and his wife's) will.  He's obviously not happy with his choice.
thesopranos,3d6k2k,DermotBologna,2,Tue Jul 14 07:27:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Bobby looks pretty pissed off there, really. And Janice has an apprehensive, strange look on her face as if she realizes something's not right. Then at the very end of the scene they both seem to cast an inquisitive glance in the direction of the wine glass, as if pondering what just happened, though this could be a coincidence.  Also, I'm not sure about this, but there are some creaky, footstep-like sounds during the scene as if someone is moving around the room. It's very quiet though and you have to turn the volume way up to hear."

thesopranos,3d6fq6,CampBloodSurvivor,20,Mon Jul 13 22:02:00 2015 UTC,"In season 4, the show intentionally deprives you of violence at almost every turn. It's one of those very deliberate techniques David Chase uses to jolt the audience awake to their love and longing for violence.   One of the reasons a family drama as highbrow as The Sopranos was able to pull such a wide audience is the broad appeal that mob epics have in the American entertainment consciousness--Primary characteristics being the thrill of coercion, physical violence, and assassination. Chase used these masterfully in the first three seasons, but always harbored a little self-loathing for becoming a success in this way. He was even more disgusted by that portion of the audience who clamored for more. That is to say, more blood.  The first part of season four, then, is a deprivation experiment, where violence is concerned. Not the first, and not the last that he would undertake, but certainly the longest in the series' run. I think the heat this season has taken from fans--many of whom were not as diplomatic in their disappointment as yourself, OP--would justify, to Chase, his suspicions about the bloodlust of his audience."

I'd say as brutal as it is, the final blows landed by Ralph didn't mark the most disturbing part of the episode for me. Ralph is fucking psychotic, and that fact is regularly reinforced during his tenure on the show. We're primed from the start to dislike this guy - to see him as an adversary for Tony in the same vein as Richie who came before him. Watching him kill Tracee is abhorrent and disgusting, but it's not exactly shocking. We did just see him take Georgie's eye out for no particular reason. He's clearly a nutjob.  No, what really got me was Silvio's violent outburst as he drags Tracee back to the Bing. That, and the total lack of empathy from Tony throughout the episode - his complete failure to have the foresight to realize this very young woman was in a seriously fucked up situation even before getting involved with someone as dangerous as Ralph. It was the devastating disregard and abuse she suffered at the hands of those among the most central characters - which we are conditioned from the beginning to find charming and relatable - that really knocks the wind out of you.  The abrupt cut from Silvio assaulting her (as Ralph looks on laughing) to a casual, lighthearted dinner scene of all these aforementioned men and their wives is a little too-on-the-nose (the episode's not the most subtle in the series, which might've been to its detriment had it not been so emotionally effective regardless), but it perfectly encapsulates the dissonance we're supposed to feel as we watch these guys go through their daily lives. They're utter pieces of shit, all of them (wives included, for their silent approval of this lifestyle), but look how quickly we can forget and go back to laughing along with Tony and the gang."

But there's Tracee, and the wuote from Christopher during his intervention, about Sil fucking ALL the girls at the club.  Although unrelated, I think this somehow casts some light on Van Zandts character in Lilyhammer, for those who've watched it. I think Frank Tagliano comes off as more and more of a sopranos character (meaning that he is a complete and utter asshole), even though it doesn't seem like the writers intend it.... Another sickening thing about Lilyhammer is how this aging, not very good looking or especally charming old fart seems to be able to pick up girls like young attractive woen with no problem....well, who cares, the show is crap anyway...."

I remember thinking that the writers must have experienced dementia first hand to get the behaviours so targetted.   Having said that, it makes the suggestion of an early symptom spot on, as the Sopranos flagged certain events before they surfaced. For instance, the comment by Vito about Genes suicide, when in the hospital for Tony, when he suggested that some guys suicide because they are secretly gay.  On its own it could simply be an isolated opinion, but it was an indicator as to Vito's own personal struggle."

thesopranos,3czv3u,jackyLAD,10,Sun Jul 12 07:52:11 2015 UTC,"S1 - A Hit is a Hit: It's not that bad, and it's pretty funny. I crack up every time those Defiler/Visiting Day douchebags are on-screen. But it isn't anything special, it adds nothing to the main plot-thread of the season, and nothing in particular from this episode really stands out.  S2 - Commendatori: It's a Very Special Vacation Episode of The Sopranos.   S3 - Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood: I don't have anything in particular against this one, but season three is incredibly strong and this is shameless filler right out the gate - an episode that ends up having no implications for the future whatsoever, despite the tease that the FBI might actually begin narrowing in on Tony starting here. This one's understandable though, in fairness, given the quick recalibration that had to be made after Marchand's death.  S4 - Christopher: It's been discussed to death, but this is where The Sopranos decided to forego any semblance of subtlety for a week. The final scene is great, though.  S5 - Sentimental Education: Another fine episode that just happens to be smack-dab in the middle of a fantastic season's worth of shows.  S6, pt. 1 - Luxury Lounge: Everything pertaining to Artie's plot was great, but the Christopher storyline felt - as was often the case when The Sopranos tried to broaden its universe beyond Jersey - a little off. But even for being the weakest, it's still a solid comedic episode - I love Kingley's and Bacall's commitment to playing completely insufferable versions of themselves - and it's a necessary step in the saga to get Cleaver on to the screen in the brilliant Stage 5.   S6, pt. 2 - Chasing It: Season six, in its entirety, is my favorite season of this and any other show, and in large part it's because of the ridiculously strong run of episodes it ended on. 6b was fucking killer, and yes, I'm going to include Chasing It in that distinction. That said, it was also probably the weakest of the final run, and again, because it just happens to be in an interlude in the middle of some of the best material the show ever produced. I like the Vito Jr. subplot, I like the idea of Tony's path to self-destruction coming in the form of gambling (and it leads to the most visceral, gripping fight between him and Carm this side of Whitecaps), I like the fracturing of the relationship between Tony and Hesh as part of 6b's ongoing theme of Tony's alienation. But I do think there's some legitimacy to the criticism that something about the gambling storyline feels a bit abrupt and artificial. And I don't know shit about professional sports whatsoever, but I don't think all these different games he's betting on would actually have overlapping seasons in real life. But shit, I'll still take it."
thesopranos,3czv3u,UniversalPolymath,2,Sun Jul 12 13:55:48 2015 UTC,i think Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood is supposed to be a spoof of the wire. which makes it even funnier.
thesopranos,3czv3u,stinkskc,2,Mon Jul 13 02:00:30 2015 UTC,"The Wire didn't exist when that episode aired, let alone was written. And I don't really see any similarities besides on a superficial level."
thesopranos,3czv3u,somerton,0,Mon Jul 13 04:35:06 2015 UTC,"The actual betting isn't that off, I think. I've worked in the gambling industry, but my employer concentrated mainly on the poker market. Whether the actual games could've been played when they did in the show, I have no idea about, but there is absolutely no shortage of sports matches to bet on, that is for certain. Some poor sod over here was in the news a few years ago, he'd managed to blow 10 million dollars on online sports betting.  What's more obviously off, is Tony aquiring this problem just like that, having shown no signs of it earlier. Even if it was happening offscreen, it is still not a very plausible way to tell a story about gambling problems. Someone beeing exposed to the industry as much as Tony, the signs would've come a lot sooner. it is an addiction, and the causes are so rooted in the personality of the gambler, that i trarely happens out of the blue like som midlife crisis or whatever. One of the few times  plot devices stood out as contrived in the series.  Another is of course Adriana suffering from IBS caused by stress, but Chase can't be blamed for that one, the medical profession thought so at the time (recent research shows IBS causes the stress, not the other way around. The real cause is incomplete gut flora)"
thesopranos,3czv3u,MadBigMadBoatMan,6,Mon Jul 13 11:09:01 2015 UTC,"I can't abide by the Commendatori hate. It's gorgeous to look at and contains some all timers - ""Major a Deegan Expressaway"" ""fucking nosy...eat your manigot!""  and basically anything Paulie says or does.  Also love Tony talking about Don Ciccio's villa in 2."
thesopranos,3czv3u,hautebird,5,Mon Jul 13 01:45:26 2015 UTC,"S1 - Boca - Soccer plot is ridiculous and heavy-handed, like some Law & Order or network TV episode; Junior's plot is just dull.  S2 - Do Not Resuscitate - Not bad, but not very memorable either. Livia and Janice grate a lot in this one.  S3 - Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood - Fun and creative but weak compared to the rest of the season.  S4 - Christopher - The regular ongoing plots are fine, but the Columbus stuff is the biggest mistake the show ever made. Very clunky.  S5 - Rat Pack - Something about it just feels a bit off... the writing is too broad. Again, not bad but not great.  S6 - Luxury Lounge - Some good moments but overall unnecessary; feels more like pure filler than maybe any other episode.  It seems the thing that these episodes all have in common is that they diverge in some way from the tone or feel of the show. Except for Do Not Resuscitate, which is just a mostly unremarkable transitional episode."
thesopranos,3czv3u,somerton,2,Sun Jul 12 12:47:14 2015 UTC,"Season 1- A hit is a hit, the entire season is great and my favorite but this episode doesn't really do anything Season 2- Commendatori, the episode doesn't do much either Season 3- Mr. Ruggerio's Neighborhood- season 3 is consistently amazing and this episode didn't anything except lead to Meadow taking the lamp later on Season 4- Mergers and Acquisitions- I don't care for Paulie's mother storyline Season 5- Sentimental Education- This season was also consistently great. The Carmela plot wasn't very interesting Season 6A- Luxury Lounge- I love this season but Ben Kingsley plot wasn't interesting Season 6B- Remember When- Season 6b was full of amazing episodes (not a single bad one) and this episode is great but not up to par."
thesopranos,3czv3u,jersey_wiseguy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:08:45 2015 UTC,"I don't really dislike any episode, but there are episodes I don't like as much as the rest.  Season 1 - College. Yeah, I said it. I like it for the scenes with Tony and Meadow. Dislike it for the scenes with Carmella and Father Intintola.  Season 2 - Commendatori. I like it for Paulie and his seeing the less romantic side of Italy. I dislike it for Annalisa.  Season 3 - ... Season 3's a hard one. It's pretty fantastic all the way through. Noah and Caitlin were annoying, but without Noah, we don't get the hilarious scene with him and Tony. I'm looking through the episodes right now, and I'm really having a hard time looking for a weak episode. Yeah, I can't choose an episode from season 3, so I'll just say ""Caitlin and Noah"".  Season 4 - Another toughie for me. I'm just now realizing how much I love this show, because I'm having trouble picking apart each episode and finding enough elements I dislike to mark it as a ""weak"" episode. I guess Calling All Cars would be it. AJ torturing Bobby Jr, Janice capitalizing on the whole Ouija board thing, and the whole thing with Karen's last ziti. I don't dislike those moments, but they're just moments I feel bad watching, because it's good people being manipulated while they're at their emotional weakness? I guess?  Season 5 - I used to dislike In Camelot because of Fran. Until my last rewatch of the series, and all of a sudden I like it. I love the moment when Tony realizes just what a horrible person Fran is, and the awkwardness of the scene where she wears JFK's hat and sings to Tony. The first episode Two Tonys maybe. Just for the scene with Tony in Melfi's office. It's just weird to see him be so openly loving toward Melfi. But, he does leave the office in a huff, calling her a ""cunt"" in the process, so that's awesome. And from that scene, we get Melfi reading Tony's apology letter to Elliot. ""I've been thinking, and I apologize for my use of fowl language""  Season 6 - Moe n' Joe - I don't dislike the Vito/Jim thing, but it's definitely the weakest moment of the whole show, IMO. Wait, no. Scrap that. The episode with Julianna Margulies as the realtor. Kaisha. For some reason, I dislike the actress, and really didn't care for the character or what she brought to the show."

thesopranos,3cyvza,alexandjef,21,Sun Jul 12 01:06:27 2015 UTC,"I think the show has a lot of things to say and is neither fully cynical nor fully optimistic, but ultimately one of the biggest things it communicates is how narcissistic and unpleasant and entrenched in their own worlds people can be. The show presents a very (unfortunately) realistic vision of a world where clear, honest communication is seldom accomplished between two people, lies disguised as truths and threats disguised as pleasantries are the norm, and most people ultimately hold their own self-interest and survival above everything and everybody else.  Conversation between these people tends toward the superficial (as AJ both rightly and misguidedly tries to point out), and yet there are moments when some characters have something deeper or more sensitive they're trying to impart. In almost every case, they either can't verbalize it or the other party doesn't understand them. Think of Tony trying to explain the import of his peyote trip to the crew when he comes back from Vegas, or the awkward conversations about ""tiling"" and ""painting"" between Furio and Carmela. Furio's whole S4 plot basically revolves around a failure to communicate what is essential to him, with Tony often cutting in at a key moment with some insensitive comment (e.g. brushing off Furio's grief for his father).  Also, the whole problem between Tony and Chris that comes to a head in 6B could've been quashed or at least helped if they actually had an honest conversation about things. Instead, when Chris dismisses his father as a no-good junkie it all but guarantees his murder at Tony's hand when the opportunity arises in the next episode. Later in that episode, too, Chris kills J.T. simply because J.T. was too tired and fed-up with Chris to give him some actual compassion and understanding -- obviously the blame is squarely on Chris for this cold-blooded murder, but you can see J.T. unwittingly sealing his fate as he both underestimates Chris's power and misunderstands or casts aside his emotional needs at that time. The ""you're in the mafia!"" comment was just the last straw, but it's likely Chris would have killed him anyway considering he had started to reveal deep secrets. It's a sad scene because J.T.'s death could have been prevented by so many factors, going all the way back to Paulie's reprehensible behavior toward Chris.  Anyway, it's basically just the realistic picture of how people communicate and interact that is one of the most impressive things the show achieves. It often denies us certain pleasures because it wouldn't be realistic for the character, like Carmela not pursuing Ade's death any further (whereas if this were some network schlock she'd invariably have a dramatic confrontation with Tony about it and etc.) Put most simply, The Sopranos just ""gets"" people right-on, how they think and talk and act. It may focus mostly on pretty awful people, and so is skewed, but even in them we see goodness and we see ourselves or people we know. That's part of the lasting genius of the show; it's totally fiction but it often feels like reality."
thesopranos,3cyvza,somerton,4,Sun Jul 12 02:17:22 2015 UTC,"Excellent post. Though I will say, you bring up this issue of honest communication, and in my mind JT dies because he's honest, and it forces Christopher to face an uncomfortable truth (which he then extinguishes by, well, extinguishing JT).   This also marks the end of Christopher's story. His whole arc, really, is about whether he'll finally put both feet in on his mob life. He's had several chances to get out, and JT was his final lifeline. Killing JT is officially turning his back on another life, thus bringing his story to a close. Everything else is denouement. (The show is particularly good at this -- you don't see the true end to a lot of the plot lines until after. While Christopher's life ends in the next episode, his story ends in ""Walk Like a Man,"" and it's almost like the particulars after that don't matter. Anyway, end rant.)"
thesopranos,3cyvza,nofuckinpodcast,5,Sun Jul 12 17:32:18 2015 UTC,"The show definitely had an impact on me, as I am still here years later talking about it! I think it was a combination of being the kind of show I've never seen before and the incredible performances, especially by James and Edie. The characters and relationships are so complex, even when I don't like them very much, I still find them fascinating.   The overall feeling I got from the show was similar to the feeling I got from watching Six Feet Under, but with more pessimism. Everyone dies, life is short, and it doesn't matter if you are a mob boss or average person, life happens and then ends. I think that's because the influence of Livia is felt through all six seasons (""it's all a big nothing""). When you are living your life, before your last meal in the diner or whatever you believe, you have to deal with your choices and be satisfied with what you did with your life. Tony obviously never found peace in himself; he was deeply unhappy by the last season and had caused a lot of pain and suffering during his life. But I don't mean that Tony is supposed to inspire us or teach us a lesson, that was just his journey in life and we got to watch it.   I'm not sure if this makes sense, it's hard to put my feelings about this show into words!"
thesopranos,3cyvza,yayoyesyou,5,Sun Jul 12 02:47:44 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting question. I'm not sure if I could distill what The Sopranos left me with into a singular ""overall feeling"".   I guess what springs to mind is a feeling of uncertainty and unease. A feeling of reverence for the mysteries of life - questions of god and morality and determinism and existential dread - that are inherently devoid of resolution. Whatever feeling it is that corresponds to the realization that life is an incredible puzzle, and that we spend too much of our time focused on bullshit to even attempt to piece it together.   The series is littered with characters trying to find purpose and meaning in life, trying to tackle the ""big picture"" questions that can roughly be reduced to ""Who am I?"" and ""Where am I going?"". Tony, Carmela, AJ, Christopher - hell, even someone as unsophisticated as Paulie - experience these fleeting moments of introspection and fascination with what it all means, but just as quickly it's covered up again by petty preoccupations with the minutia of everyday life. It's an incredibly (and unfortunately) accurate portrayal of how we all tend to operate on a regular basis.  The show throws so many questions at the wall. What, if anything, happens to us after we die? What supernatural presences might lie just outside the confines of our vantage points? What's the purpose of anything at all? Is this all there is? The show will occasionally offer answers from the sole perspectives of various characters (cue Livia's fantastic ""It's all a big nothing"" speech), but it never dares to hazard any concrete, tidy answers itself. The way the series embraced ambiguity and non-resolution, particularly when it veered off into headier philosophical territory, was probably its most beautiful aspect to me."
thesopranos,3cyvza,UniversalPolymath,3,Sun Jul 12 06:28:55 2015 UTC,"It was definitely able to be consumed as pure entertainment. Just seeing the characters interact was a pleasure. The show was funny, dramatic and exciting. I think those are the three most important things in a TV show.   As for it's overall feeling, it definitely made me think about the mind of the average person. I think it perfectly captured how vulnerable we all are, yet also the facade that everyone puts on in their day to day life. The show really does make you realise how everybody is the same neurotic asshole deep down.   It also made me think about how people let their emotions consume them. So many of the catalyst events in this show were caused by characters being overly emotional about something. The failure to accept failure can drive a person to terrible decisions."
thesopranos,3cyvza,The-Doctor-94,3,Sun Jul 12 08:05:04 2015 UTC,"I remember feeling like somebody else got it. I'm not sure if the show shaped my world view or confirmed it, but I felt like someone else saw the world that way I did."
thesopranos,3cyvza,nofuckinpodcast,3,Sun Jul 12 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"Chase's comments about the ending probably affected me more than the show itself. You know, the stuff about how our time here is short, and we need to make the most of it, by enjoying the good moments. It coincides with me having lost a couple of people that were close to me. But it has definitely made me spend more time with my family, and to try and not worry so much about what the future holds for my kids all the time, and just relax and have a good time....  The show itself left me with sadness. The last few seasons are just so heartbreaking, Janice destroying her children, Tony alienating himself from everything that means anything to him, going at it with Carmela after she didn't want to back him on that sportsbetting thing he was into...."

I watched Sons before I watched The Sopranos so this went completely over my head until now when I randomly decided to read The Sopranos IMDB trivia.

thesopranos,3cyf2p,somerton,6,Sat Jul 11 22:24:32 2015 UTC,"The show finished nearly 10 years ago, every minute detail of this show has been discussed to death. There's literally nothing to talk about any more."
thesopranos,3cyf2p,Lanlodger,3,Sun Jul 12 00:15:49 2015 UTC,"That's absurd. There's always fresh insights and interesting discussions to be had, you can see that just from looking at the Sopranos Autopsy site, or the comments section of the AV Club recaps, or many of the better threads here. For example, a couple years ago on the Chase Lounge forum, I made a thread pointing out the eerie similarities between the Colonial style houses seen throughout the show, first in Tony's dream with the woman on the stairs. Then someone on here made an excellent thread fusing my insights with their own about how the houses can be seen to represent death, etc. This essentially had not been really pointed out and analyzed before, not that I know of and I've read way too much Sopranos analysis. There's only nothing left to talk about if you're thinking on a surface level (I don't mean you personally).  95% of the discussion about the show is on the final scene anyways, leaving the bulk of the series itself actually ignored many times. When was the last time you heard someone talking about the significance of the numbers ""907"" in Season 4, for instance, or how Pussy and Tony are literally dining in an Irish pub after killing the kid at the end of From Where to Eternity? And analysis of the series on a more aesthetic/formal level has largely been ignored, whereas a look at the camera movement and lighting, lenses and filters, narrative structure and use of rhyming and doubling, etc. would be very fruitful. A lot of details get glossed over, and it's an incredibly rich show.  I mean, Last Year at Marienbad came out over 50 years ago -- does that mean that there's nothing new to say about it now? Hardly."
thesopranos,3cyf2p,yayoyesyou,7,Sun Jul 12 00:25:46 2015 UTC,"I would also love to see more discussions about characters and storylines, especially now that the podcast and Alan Sepinwall's weekly reviews are giving us another chance to think about the show. I think it's fine if people want to post quotes or screenshots, and I think it's up to the posters who want more discussion (myself included) to post more threads.

thesopranos,3cyf2p,locosherman1,6,Mon Jul 13 16:57:02 2015 UTC,We could just rewatch the show as a sub and have episode discussion threads once a week. We could try and get people who have never watched the show here as well since it would be fun to see thoughts from people who have never watched the show to see what they think is going on what would happen next.
thesopranos,3cyf2p,yayoyesyou,6,Sun Jul 12 01:09:28 2015 UTC,I think we tried a rewatch at one point last year but it stalled around Boca. I'd love to try again though.

thesopranos,3cyf2p,UniversalPolymath,4,Sat Jul 11 22:38:56 2015 UTC,"Hey, appreciate the shoutout. Truth is though, there are a lot of quality posters here. It's probably just my imagination, but the really good discussions just seem to come in waves. There will be a slow week here or there, and then on another all the top posts will be really good stuff.   That's what keeps me coming back, but I wouldn't necessarily disparage the screen-caps and gifs keeping the community active in the meantime. This place will never be The Chase Lounge, and that's fine. I'm just thrilled there's some sustainable community that's still as interested in talking about this series, in any capacity, as I am."
thesopranos,3cyf2p,dxgxnxratx315,3,Sun Jul 12 05:08:20 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm fine with it. It's a problem on bigger subs, for example during the off season of Breaking Bad /r/breakingbad was the worst. And the same right now with /r/gameofthrones. /r/thesopranos is a very small community who has discussed this show to death. There isn't much to talk about anymore. All the memes and pictures are fine because it's in such a low dosage compared to bigger subs."
thesopranos,3cyf2p,UniversalPolymath,-2,Sat Jul 11 23:17:46 2015 UTC,"You're right; there isn't that much to talk about at this point, perhaps. But I think there's still enough substantive discussion so that the front page doesn't have to be mostly pics. I guess I'm just an idealist about all this. At least it's not nearly as bad as the IMDb Sopranos board gags"
thesopranos,3cyf2p,nofuckinpodcast,3,Sat Jul 11 23:27:28 2015 UTC,"The IMDb boards were pretty good when the show was still airing. But it turned to shit the very day the finale aired, and has somehow been the same cesspool of ""Did Tony die?"" arguments ever since."
thesopranos,3cyf2p,hautebird,2,Mon Jul 13 18:29:50 2015 UTC,"It's a little slow right now because it's summer, but I actually feel like there can be some great discussion here sometimes. I also really like that this community here feels tight knit and cool with each other -- some other TV subs get loaded with drama.   But hey, I'm always up for more discussion. And I hate to shamelessly plug, but we at No Fuckin' Ziti love having in depth (albeit very goofy) discussions about the show."
thesopranos,3cyf2p,UniversalPolymath,2,Sun Jul 12 00:54:32 2015 UTC,"Let's discuss how it's the greatest show of all time and season 1 does not hold up.  That's my contention anyway.  It's incredible TV but it's comparable to season 1 Seinfeld when it comes to characters only being partially formed and the pacing being unfamiliar and dissimilar to the rest of the series.  I love it but man, it's overrated IMO as compared to the rest of the series."
thesopranos,3cyf2p,hautebird,3,Sun Jul 12 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I love some episodes from Season 1 (Isabella, The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti, Nobody Knows Anything, Down Neck, Denial Anger Acceptance, the Pilot even though it feels so different), but even those I'm not sure I'd put quite on the same level as the show's very best episodes. I just feel it got subtler and overall better in Season 2, qualities which increased every season, peaked with 3 and 4, and delivered a knockout blow with 6B.  I guess a good way of putting it would be Season 1 is the only season that almost feels like a different show at times, so different is the tone and pace and execution. It's way more overtly comedic, wacky even, much faster-paced and less dark and dramatic, and more Scorsese-influenced. Like, the Pilot pretty much unleashes all the show's thematic concerns, all totally fully-formed, and it's a masterful episode in many ways -- but aesthetically it feels so different from the more low-key, subtle, gloomy later seasons. Even S2, before 9/11 and all that, has a palpable air of discontent which in S1 is kind of counterbalanced by a general air of zaniness."
thesopranos,3cyf2p,porkrines,3,Sun Jul 12 01:45:38 2015 UTC,"Nail-on-the-head.  And it bears repeating that there is so much to like about S1. It has a fantastic arc to it, and probably tells the strongest (or most cohesive, at the very least) season-long story - the result of it being a long-form version of a movie idea that had been bouncing around Chase's head. The characters are fully-formed from the start, the dialogue is consistently sharp and well-observed ...  But as much as there is to love about it, you're right that it simply feels different. And had the tone of season one been maintained throughout the rest of the series, it would've been wildly entertaining, and I would've watched every minute of it - but it probably wouldn't have risen to the level of prestige it ultimately did. We probably wouldn't be sitting here talking about it eight years after the fact either.  To a certain extent, I'd extend that observation to the next couple seasons as well, by the way. You're right that the show would continue to tweak the formula each year, and certainly to greater success in seasons two and three, but those years still express a relative lightheartedness that the show would jettison in S4, which I'd consider the major turning point in the series.   But for what it's worth, though, I think that relative lightheartedness only heightens what comes afterwards. The constant dread that slowly consumes the latter half of the series - that dark, menacing mood that takes hold and never lets up; the aesthetic changes in the lighting and color palette; the sunny, colorful setting that's traded in for the perpetually autumnal backdrop of the last couple seasons, leaving the already bleak Jersey landscape looking even more deathly and barren - all of this is better appreciated when standing in deep contrast against the ""lighter"" years that came before them."

thesopranos,3cvc2a,arnoldknows,3,Wed Jul 22 03:42:43 2015 UTC,She knows the risks but it's the adrenaline rush/unconventional nature of having such a powerful and twisted man as a patient that keeps her interested. She has her own deep-seated issues and clings onto Tony because he takes control--something she ultimately feeds off.
thesopranos,3cvc2a,avoritz,2,Sat Jul 11 15:33:53 2015 UTC,I think she answers this in season 2 with her own therapist...elliot...but i dont recall what her answer was.
thesopranos,3cvc2a,UniversalPolymath,7,Sat Jul 11 03:23:38 2015 UTC,"I think the core reason is summed up in their conversation about why people enjoy roller coasters or scary movies: ""To experience the thrill of being terrified without the consequences.""  Elliot goes on to say he's worried that treating Tony might provide Melfi with some sort of vicarious thrill, and she denies it at the time - but in a rather defensive fashion that I think implies he's struck a genuine nerve."
thesopranos,3cvc2a,NotAlaskan,5,Sat Jul 11 15:55:39 2015 UTC,"I agree. I also think it was the same for Tony. Not necessarily him looking for a ""thrilling experience"" but to escape the monotony of average day life."

thesopranos,3cvc2a,iscarletpimpernel,2,Sat Jul 11 06:31:01 2015 UTC,"The reasons others have given here are valid, but I think her primary motivation was professional. Namely:  Harm reduction: When a murderer deliberately seeks to ""get better,"" the therapist has an ethical and professional responsibility to help towards that end. This brings to mind the program in Germany encouraging pedophiles to seek therapy and promising not to turn them in. If Melfi turns him away because he is violent, and he simply continues committing violence, in some ways she may consider herself partially responsible since she refused to treat him. Now, whether the therapy did or even could help is another story--the point is, you try your best. And she did try: recall when she issued a stern, ""Why don't you just give it up?"" which Tony brushed aside. Or when she told him he was responsible for a lot of pain and suffering after he was crying about Pie O My. She tried to reduce the harm he would cause.  Professional interest: In ""Blue Comet"" (S6,E20) when Melfi was at that dinner and Elliot exposed her client, she was asked if it was fascinating work. She said unambiguously, ""It is."" As a therapist, she couldn't help but be fascinated by the psyche of someone so violent and unethical--why does he do what he does, and how does he do it without any guilt? These are fundamental questions for therapists, and here was an opportunity to examine his background, thought process, and motivations up close, and try to get him to approach life in a different way. The professional challenge was irresistible for her."

It ends with all the characters hugging in a church and walking into a white light. Come on, man.) In fact, the entire final season was a major disappointment. But that shouldn't color how anyone feels about the rest of the series. I'll take a mediocre ending any day if I can get more episodes like ""The Constant"" or ""Walkabout.""  Is it on the same level as The Sopranos? Nowhere near it. But it's still an entertaining show, and there's a bit of ambiguity to it that I think elevates it above most network shows."

thesopranos,3cskfo,illegal_deagle,2,Fri Jul 10 13:37:33 2015 UTC,The fact that he's probably a shithead IRL only makes the Vito character more funny. Like that scene where he is chopping wood and refraining himself from looking at the time is hilarious. These characters exist on different dimensions. Some are serious/dramatic and others like Vito are parodies. Can you imagine a more serious character's internal monologue being on the show like that. The fact he asked a redditor for money to take his picture only adds more depth to his parodic character IMO.

thesopranos,3cskfo,nofuckinpodcast,3,Fri Jul 10 14:54:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah. That's my biggest problem with the Vito storyline: the actor. It's an interesting idea but not executed as well as most of the show's other ideas. Like imagine if Steve Buscemi played Vito instead of Tony B. With a truly solid actor that could have been a huge, huge story."
thesopranos,3cskfo,UniversalPolymath,2,Fri Jul 10 15:05:42 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I didn't hate on the Vito shit as much as some fans, but there was definitely some wasted potential there. It's a catch-22 though, seeing as the storyline never would've existed in the first place without Gannascoli."

While I wasn't flipping out like lost fans, I did almost reach a point where I was like, ""Ok let's maybe move this along.""  Of course, then, the next episode as ""Cold Stones,"" which was fantastic. So I should complain. I'm just good at it."

thesopranos,3cnqhq,ellomatey,7,Thu Jul 9 11:47:50 2015 UTC,"I imagine you're getting downvoted because season 2 isn't as bad as many people claim it to be, and if you don't watch it you miss out on some major plot points that affect later seasons."
thesopranos,3cnqhq,lippyjose,5,Thu Jul 9 15:15:59 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I love S2.  It seems out of place kinda, the first time through, but it adds so much depth to the series.  Frank, Nick, and Ziggy are all really interesting storylines.  And the Greek gives a 'how' to the whole drug trade there.    I really like S2.  Again it can be a bit of a change up initially....bc The Wire's kinda hard to get down at the start.  So ppl spend parts of S1 getting it together----who is who, etc---and then, when it's starting to get understood, it changes up the focus.  So I can see why S2 isn't loved at first....but I think it's great and fits well esp with multiple views."

thesopranos,3cnqhq,l__o-l-o__l,5,Thu Jul 9 16:06:28 2015 UTC,Boardwalk Empire is a must watch for anyone who likes the crime genre. It's not as good as The Sopranos but Steve Buscemi is great in it.

It's a bit cliche and hackneyed, and the out of place soundtrack drags it down a fair bit.  I think PB is still well worth a watch but wouldn't put it up there at the standard with those three. I'd put The Wire/Sopranos top, then BWE, BrBad, True Detective, then Peaky Blinders in a category or two below that. Still good but not amazing."

thesopranos,3clt0h,TonySoprano420,15,Wed Jul 8 22:37:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah the show takes place right at the transition, that's what I love about shows and novels that depict their own contemporary era. So in ""College"" Christopher is busting his ass to get to a payphone in the rain, but later episodes don't show the payphone hustle.   You can also hear the evolution of cell phone rings as the show progresses.   Also in the earlier episodes it shows Tony answering and talking on their house phone, but very seldom in the later episodes.  Also the evolution of cell phone norms. When Tony answers his phone in the middle of therapy, Melfi just grimaces and bears it, but these days that wouldn't pass without a comment. We were still trying to figure out proper etiquette at that time."

thesopranos,3ceew5,DermotBologna,6,Tue Jul 7 07:05:04 2015 UTC,"At the time he was writing ""College,"" Chase hadn't even begun to think about the series finale. So I have a hard time believing this connects. And besides, I really don't think this is a moralistic show like that. It was never about good and bad guys getting what they deserved, and in fact often about the opposite. Chase simply wasn't interested in meting out punishment or justice like that."
thesopranos,3ceew5,nofuckinpodcast,4,Tue Jul 7 12:54:36 2015 UTC,"The blocking of the scene allows for Meadow's death or at least injury though. If Tony gets killed right as she walks through the door, she would probably stand there in a state of shock blocking the exit of Members Only Guy. Would she be frozen in terror? Would she attack him? Would he blast her too or simply push her out of the way? I don't know that it's thematically related to ""College"" but it's definitely an interesting consideration."
thesopranos,3ceew5,billsender,2,Tue Jul 7 14:10:19 2015 UTC,"Judging from the other hits we've seen on the show, it seems unlikely the shooter would harm Meadow -- he'd just push her, or anyone else, out of the way so as to make a speedy exit. Then again, if you subscribe to the idea that Phil's gruesome death in front of his family made the ""families don't get touched"" credo off-limits for Tony, then it's possible he could've made a point to shoot not just Tony but also AJ, Carm and Meadow. Pretty fucked up.  What's great about the final scene, though, is precisely how suggestive it is of so many different things happening ""after"" the ending, many of them incredibly dark, while (by the nature of its very construction) being unable to actually confirm any one of them. I do think that Chase more or less pointed to Tony's death at the end there but I can't argue that it ""happened"" because everything after the cut to black is all in our imaginations (sorry, don't mean to start that debate again...)"
thesopranos,3ceew5,somerton,3,Tue Jul 7 20:08:41 2015 UTC,"Without getting into a major conversation about it, to me, the ending is about how we all have some version of a Members Only Guy leering over our shoulders, and the point isn't the cut to black, but how we spend our time before it happens."

That last scene with Paulie outside of Satriale's says it all. Once filled with capos and soldiers, now a shadow of its former self. This is Tony's state. Empty, alone. All he has done to be at the point he is, to be happy, all the people and family he has killed to get there. And what is left? He's still the man he was at the start. Maybe even worse with all of the psychiatry. And Carlo was going to testify against him. Indictments forthcoming again. Tony shares a ""last supper"" like moment with his family before the shitstorm rains. Whether he died there or not, he was finished anyway. And we rooted for him. Even though he was a sociopathic anti-hero, we wanted him to win against New York, and he did. Brilliant ending."""

thesopranos,3c0dtb,ctyt,8,Fri Jul 3 16:58:36 2015 UTC,"I don't agree about the Russians. One in particular. Svetlana was one of the best characterized minor roles on the show.   The show definitely didn't do a great job portraying black people with any kind of depth, I agree to that. Really, whenever the focus moved away from the core cast of characters and their subculture, the writing got worse and more stereotypical."
thesopranos,3c0dtb,rocketsauce2112,7,Fri Jul 3 23:03:21 2015 UTC,"One could maybe defend the often stereotypical depiction of black people on the show by saying that that's simply true to the sorts of black people that the main characters would run into: gangsters, crooked politicians, rappers, the odd crackhead, etc. The show does have a few depictions of genuinely decent black people, though -- the old minister in early S2 (or was he more morally corrupted?), and of course the cop in S3 who won't stoop to Tony's level. And it's clear the show is deconstructing and critiquing these very racist tropes and traditions of the mafia when we get to Unidentified Black Males in S5.  I also see Maurice, the politician, as someone who just happens to be black and also totally corrupt in typical Sopranos fashion, instead of being defined by his race. Though that scene with the crackheads that Maurice arranges to be shot/forced out of those homes, seems to me pretty clunky and awkward for the show, like what it looks like when network TV tries to do The Wire-type subject matter.  The show definitely felt more comfortable portraying Jews."
thesopranos,3c0dtb,somerton,6,Fri Jul 3 23:39:41 2015 UTC,"the old minister in early S2 (or was he more morally corrupted?)   He wasn't, but his son was.  And good thoughts on the ""sorts"" of people of color who would intersect with Tony's world. I think there's a lot to that. But on the other hand, I think groups represented outside our main cast  were pretty broadly caricatured throughout. The only reason I can come up with for this being intentional is that it was perhaps an extension of how Tony viewed members outside his core circle.  Or, for a less forgiving explanation, I think Chase and the rest of the writers' room just probably didn't have as good a grasp on how to authentically write for their fleeting black characters. That ""cultural voice"" just wasn't part of Chase's life experience. And his grasp on the Italian experience was just so phenomenally good, everything else would be bound to fall short by comparison.  It's not just people of color, though. Chase clearly has a certain level of disdain for the medigan (see the Cusamanos, or that nerdy fucking ""car instrument panel"" family from the beginning of Commendatori), and that absolutely comes through as intentional. And I don't think it was just an ethnic distinction, but also one of class - he also had fun at the expense of the upper-class intelligentsia, courtesy of Melfi's professional peers."
thesopranos,3c0dtb,UniversalPolymath,3,Sat Jul 4 05:14:25 2015 UTC,"Well said, yup, I think it'd be more accurate to say Chase/the show portrays a lot of different types of people very broadly and caricature-like, for better and for worse, whether they're gangster rappers or white upper-class sophisticates. In fact, the show seemed to reserve its most damning judgments for those well-to-do white intellectuals who are nonetheless clueless about so many essential things. Another person mentioned the opening scene in Commendatori where the black gangsters carjack the white yuppie family, and it's an instructive example because the show really almost depicts the family as being more objectionable than the criminals (and not just because the dad is racist)."
thesopranos,3c0dtb,somerton,6,Sun Jul 5 05:21:52 2015 UTC,"And it's clear the show is deconstructing and critiquing these very racist tropes   Another critique of a racist trope is the first scene of S2 E04, ""Commendatori,"" when those black guys jack the family's Mercedes SUV & the father spits out, ""Fucking niggers. Who else?"" Then the show cuts to ""who else:"" Tony, grinning and looking at snapshots of the cars he's about to make bank off of."
thesopranos,3c0dtb,mCmurphyX,3,Sat Jul 4 21:12:42 2015 UTC,"I think this nails it. These guys are not particularly tolerant of other cultures, and the only kinds of black people they really interact with are the kind you would go to when it's ""Wop whacking time in Brooklyn."""
thesopranos,3c0dtb,TonySoprano420,2,Mon Jul 6 17:02:26 2015 UTC,I don't think the kids were that stereotypical. How do you explain Meadow?   I don't know many stereotypical Italian American princesses who would do what she did. She took an interest in social justice issues (because you don't relate to black people clinging to logs) for some reason. She earned her own money and became highly educated. As much as she annoyed me.  AJ wasn't the sort of guido that Jackie Jr. was.
thesopranos,3c0dtb,fuschialotus,3,Fri Jul 3 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"The kids are stereotypical kids, not necessarily stereotypical Italian-American kids. Meadow is a high school overachiever that gets into an elite school and gets involved in social justice. AJ is an underachiever with borderline ADHD that gets into occasional trouble in school. These are pretty much tropes. The later plots with AJ (being fatherly to his girlfriend's kid and trying to kill Junior) look like a conscious attempt to get away from the trope."
thesopranos,3c0dtb,somerton,5,Fri Jul 3 17:14:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Chase wrote the Sopranos kids as a conscious rejection of the kid-character stereotypes you speak of. Most kid characters are the kind of unrealistically intelligent and likeable rebels who always have the right thing to say, always one-up their parents, and generally act like they have 20 more years of knowledge than they do. Meadow and AJ, though, acted simply like normal kids. They were alternately dumb and smart, cunning and innocent, kind and devious. AJ especially breaks out of the stereotypical TV-kid role by being such a realistically-written teenager, full of all the idiocy, angst, anger, depression and sudden existential crises that mark that period.  By contrast, I can't think of another series that examines what teenagers are actually like to such an accurate degree. I think AJ and Meadow (and Jackie Jr. and Noah and even Hernan, for that matter) were tremendously well-written, again especially AJ (Meadow could've used more screentime in S6, IMO). Anyway, what's so stereotypical about being an ""overachiever,"" or being ""borderline ADHD""? These are very real and common things, and it's not like they totally defined the characters, who I think were unusually multi-faceted for their age."

thesopranos,3btpi7,inkman,12,Thu Jul 2 01:58:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this pretty much covers it. There was nothing off about Nancy Marchand (she was fucking brilliant) - there was something off about Livia."
thesopranos,3btpi7,UniversalPolymath,10,Thu Jul 2 04:22:12 2015 UTC,"In that 5 hour interview that's linked to somewhere on these pages, Chase talks about her casting. She was one of the toughest characters to cast, they brought in dozens, and every one of them was totally clueless. Nancy just nailed it. Said Chase, and  Livia was Chases mother, down to exact lines like ""I wish the lord would take me"" or ""It's all a big nothing"".   Livia made more sense to me on re-watch. I hated her a bit too much the first time, and just hoped she's die off, but second time around I had more time to try to see her character for what it was, and how they're trying to say (mostly through Melfi) what effect growing up with such a mother might have had on a person. And I think this is where the show's writing really hits its zenith.   I've dealt with people with varying degrees of antisocial behavior through work before, and while I've of course never encountered anything like Tony or anyone else on the show, I have been witness to effects of not getting any love when you grow up, and I don't think either Livia, Janice or, say, Vito jr. are off as characters Remember, basic human skills like trust, empathy, confidence* needs to be awakened in children through stimulation, support and predictability. If it's not, well.... anyway, I think this is one of the things the show really does brilliantly, in addition to all the other great stuff that's going on. If you think Livia is off as a character, than that might mean you've never come across people like her, and I'll tell you, you shouldn't regret it if it's the case, because they do exist.  *Tony may seem confident, but that's an iron mask, and Melfi sees right through it. Shit, she even makes him cry, in the very first episode. Surprised he had the decency to stand up for Johnny Sack after Allegra's wedding."

It just seems weird that he's so important to everyone in the show and we've never heard about him.  I guess you can't really hold that against the show, but it just feels a little out of place."
thesopranos,3bivfs,eachfire,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:21:16 2015 UTC,"IDK, I always loved the way the show did a great job of introducing characters (Tony B, Richie, Ralph) without it feeling like ""OK HEY HERE'S A NEW CAST MEMBER!!!"" — the characters react to them as someone they've always known and so the audience has to get on board quickly. Just like it would happen in real life."
thesopranos,3bivfs,somerton,5,Mon Jul 6 17:06:17 2015 UTC,"I love Season 5 (though I definitely prefer 3, 4 and 6), but there does seem to be something different about the show pre- and post-S5. Typically people talk about 4 in this way, in that the show got a lot darker from that point on, but I think Seasons 1-4 have a kind of continuity in content and overall feel, actually, whereas 5 and 6 take on a different style. (Some of this may be because 1-4 were produced over four consecutive years, whereas 5 and 6 were very spread out over 5 more years; the writers having so much time was probably a very good thing, but it also naturally lead to a certain change in approach).  For one thing, you could argue that 5 is the season most guilty of wheel-spinning -- if great wheel-spinning -- with the show doing many things it had already done before, and often just delaying the inevitable NY-NJ war in any way possible. And 5 and 6 also continue and intensify the trend, started in 4, of really focusing on smaller characters in a way that annoys some, dedicating half an episode or whole episodes to seemingly minor plotlines or characters. I don't mind this, but many do. Plus, 5 and 6 make Tony far more unpleasant than he had been before -- it's a natural evolution, but I can see how it's not fun to watch for a lot of people.  Another thing about S5 is that it's very fast-paced compared to the three preceding seasons (though probably not S1). This can seem a bit surprising at first. And I do prefer Sopranos when it's more languorously-paced, to be honest. But S6 certainly can't be described as fast-paced, not really even the final adrenaline-pumping few episodes. I guess a good way of putting all this is that S5 is more friendly to the average viewer than most other seasons; after 4, which many reviled for ""nothing happening,"" the writers may have caved in slightly to pressure. Or maybe not; Chase doesn't seem to give a fuck what people think."

I think the black symbolizes Tony's unknown fate, he will either end up dead right then and there in the diner, shot by Members Only guy, or next week, or years later, or end up rotting away like Junior with nobody giving a shit and his own memories fading. Those are the only ways out for a guy like Tony, and the suspense built by Meadow tediously parking her car etc., represents the way Tony lives the rest of his life, wondering when the bullet might come."

I always tell people I think the ending is just a cut to black, because we don't know what happens. It ends abruptly because there really is no ending. Their lives continue, whether Tony is dead or not. Whether Tony continues to be boss until death in his old age, or if he goes to prison until he dies. Whether Tony goes civilian, or becomes even more sociopathic and criminal.  The show is about the fact that there is virtually no escape from ""the life"". It never ends. Vito couldn't stay in NH because he missed ""the life"". Meadow couldn't marry Finn because she was so used to ""the life"" and ends up with Parisi. Christopher had to die because he couldn't handle ""the life"". Tony can't escape ""the life"" because of his family ties and lack of willingness to change anything about himself.

thesopranos,3bh1an,HooDooOperator,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:24:22 2015 UTC,"Hey, glad you liked it man. I've seen the series more times than I could possibly count, and my mind is still blown apart every time (seriously, rest on it a little and then try giving it a rewatch - the show only gets more rewarding with subsequent viewings).  Other shows that have come out since - Breaking Bad, Boardwalk Empire - are heavily driven by plot. Great shows for what they were, and lots of fun to watch, but once I know everything that happens I don't feel super-compelled to revisit them. The Sopranos centered around its characters and took the time to develop them and round them out better than any show I've ever seen, and every time I watch it it's like hanging out with old friends.  As for your ridiculously minor nitpick #2: Some time probably elapsed between the when we see Tony first walk in the door and quickly survey the restaurant, and when we jump-cut to him already sitting at the table. Probably ordered them right before he started checking out that jukebox."
thesopranos,3bh1an,MC_Homicidal_Rapist,0,Mon Jun 29 04:33:00 2015 UTC,"watch boardwalk empire next.  its a great show, has ties to sopranos, is mob related.  and the wire sucks and is horribly overrated.  i watched it cover to cover and by the end just didnt give a fuck about the charachters, the story, the show in general.  but boardwalk is awesome, definitely what im watching after my latest go around with the sopranos."

I'm gonna guess  that they were either ousted or simply just brought down by the feds and Johnny boy and Junior picked up the slack there. You hear Richie Aprile talking about killing Rocco Dimeo so there's some evidence there was some conflict there.

thesopranos,3bg4qz,gyang333,3,Mon Jun 29 00:15:01 2015 UTC,"There probably just wasn't an interesting story to tell with him - it would've been a retread either of some of Junior's story arcs or a retread of Johnny Sack's arc in prison. A possible in-universe explanation is that he'd been in jail for awhile and had probably run out of intermediaries that he could use to communicate - if he was in some supermax out in the midwest, it'd be hard for him to get the word out without someone to carry the message. He was elderly and possibly sickly too?  That reminds me though, I remember one time before the sixth season came out - I'd read this really involved fucking write-up somebody had done on like imdb's message boards where they'd managed to convince themselves that season six would involve Ercole Dimeo being released from prison, and that it would be kind of an aggravated version of the storyline with Feech - only Tony would end up having to confront the fact his dad was an asshole by proxy in dealing with this old crime boss being out of jail and it would build to Tony having to kill him in a similar vein to how he'd ended up having to kill Tony B. And in doing so, Tony would experience some growth because he'd be burying the legend of his dad as well.  It was about as crazy as you'd expect a theory about a Game of Thrones plot point to be."
thesopranos,3bg4qz,Iohanne,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:29:01 2015 UTC,"do they really mention him outside of the first episode, and maybe during early squabbles between tony and junior?   when it comes to the pilot, all kinds of shit can change afterward.  but, whats important is that tony is the street boss, so, he is the defacto boss until the old man is out of the can.  and if he is in for life, then tony is boss for life, or until he winds up in jail as well."

Like at the end of this episode, Chasing It, Tony seems to be having one of those fleeting moments of clarity. He realizes that considering everything he's been through, and what is actually valuable in life, namely, life itself, he's actually ahead of the game. Perhaps this is what helps him realize what an asshat he's been with Hesh. After Hesh loses his wife(?) he finally pays Hesh back with ""Sorry for your loss."" I dont know, this was sort of rehabilitating in my eyes, but that's just me being a sucker probably."
thesopranos,3b4eel,iamirishpat,3,Thu Jun 25 23:07:04 2015 UTC,"That scene is somewhat complex, for one side Tony felt guilt and paid the remaining money of the debt after knowing that Hesh's wife died. Then when he walks out the door with a smug face, like feeling good of the Hesh's grieve.  Is the classic way of Tony of feeling ""empathy"" for someone, is always based on guilt, only and only if someone is having a really bad time, Tony do something ""nice"" for that person.   I feel bad for Hesh, he was in his legit right to ask for his money, not to say, he did it in a very polite way. If the debt were the way around, Hesh owing him money, Tony wouldn't be polite at all, even violent and aggressive. Besides, after season four Tony is very hard to talk to, anything upsets him, I wouldn't know how to talk to him, like Chris, he wanted to talk to him many times, but Tony was always rude to him, even bullying him. I liked the Tony pre season 4, not this Tony. However the acting of JG it is superb!"

He was busted by the FBI when he was on bail with guns under the pool table (and Tony remarks that Jimmy was lucky to get out so soon because of that) He was acting sketchy in Tony's basement asking him a bunch of questions All the capos thought something weird was up with Jimmy when they met at Satriali's (""Jimmy, this answers your concerns?"" ""I think a lot of good ground was covered"", then Tony: ""All of a sudden he asks to meet to discuss shit we've already covered."") When Sylvio has a a gun pointed at the back of his head and says ""Why don't you call for help on your radio mike, fuckin rat,"" Jimmy just says ""Mother of God""--he's not like, ""What the fuck are you talking about?"" Then Sylvio: ""Whatsa matter, you not wearing one tonight?"" Chris: ""No, he didn't have the chance to put on anything decent."" In other words, Chris grabbed him before he could put on the wire.

thesopranos,3b351k,mCmurphyX,9,Thu Jun 25 16:31:05 2015 UTC,"I thought it was fairly obvious that Jimmy was talking to the FBI. First of all, he asked a lot of superfluous questions. Second of all, he went from defiant to ""OH SWEET MOTHER OF GOD"" when he figured out that they weren't sticking a gun in his face because of a power play, but because they thought he was a rat."
thesopranos,3b351k,samferrara,4,Thu Jun 25 17:10:25 2015 UTC,I always wondered how they cleaned up all of the forensic type shit when they blew his head off. You can clearly see in the video that a ton of blood and guts went flying all over that room. That actually happens a lot with different soprano hits. That kind of sloppiness gets regular people busted I guess in soprano land it's a non issue. Although looking back the only time I saw anyone clean up after a murder is when Tony killed Ralph over that God for saken horse

thesopranos,3b1viu,datapye,3,Thu Jun 25 13:07:15 2015 UTC,"Yes! This was the scene that solidified season 3 as my favorite season (although I'm currently doing a rewatch and apparently it's not a lot of others' favorites so my opinion could change upon finishing).  I really love the emotion Junior's singing brings, and when it plays over different versions of the song from various languages. That was something really special.  And while she's not a very well-liked character, I had this flashback when Meadow repeatedly tried interrupting the room's mood. It reminded me a lot when I was a bit younger, and saw others of the young generation try to attempt the same thing towards their elders, so I liked that they written in that generation gap, even with all the annoyances it brought.  The whole scene brought a mix of different emotions one after the other, and the Aphex Twin track over the credits just topped it off for me"

Really, the worst way it could have gone (besides getting himself whacked right then and there) would be if he let Peeps spot him but let Peeps get away. He didn't do that, and he took out the whore witness too. He only made one simple mistake, which was standing too close to the tire and not anticipating it lurching forward.

He is the consigliere to Tony Soprano in the Soprano crime family. Silvio has one of the lowest profiles on the show. He is usually a behind the scenes figure and tries not to draw much attention to himself. He does very well at maintaining a legitimate business image as the manager and owner of the Bada Bing strip club. Silvio usually keeps his cool in even the worst situations but has been known to unleash his terrible fury and excessive anger when necessary (or when playing poker), revealing a temper comparable to his peers'. Silvio is a movie and film connoisseur and has an encyclopedic mind for movie lines. Throughout the series, he entertains the other members of the crew by getting into character and mimicking Michael Corleone's remark in the The Godfather Part III: ""Just when I thought I was out...they pulled me back in."" Silvio is one of the most loyal mobsters in the Soprano crime family. He is notorious on the show for executing FBI informants and traitors.

Life isn't just a relentlessly bleak drama, and it's not just a laugh-a-minute comedy. Life has it all - the hilarious, the tragic; the thrilling and mundane; the beautiful and ugly. The Sopranos had it all too.  The reason the comedy works so fucking well on this show is because they're not jokey, sitcomy situations (well, maybe sometimes - Pine Barrens?). Almost all the comedy comes from the characters just being funny people, and often unintentionally so. They're just like your friends that can make you laugh the more you get to know them."

And worse, he roughed up my appraiser!"". :D It's made all the worse when we all clearly know that Tony does not give two shits about Maurice or the appraiser, they're just pretexts for his outrage, which is really caused by the fact that he has to pay tribute to Carmine. He even has Vito give the appraiser a beatdown!  Many of the characters are also affected by gross, unadulterated stupidity.

The original title for ""Kennedy and Heidi"" was ""Sonya"" and the orignal title for ""The Blue Comet"" was ""The End of the Line""."

I think I remember seeing this on Deadwood Stage back in the day, but I've never been sure whether or not this was an official working title courtesy of Chase, or if it was just rumored. It retroactively fits the narrative of the ""Tony dies"" crowd - bolstered by the Steve Buscemi line in Mayham, and later alluded to by Nancy Sinatra in Chasing It - but I dunno if there's anything actually substantiating it."
thesopranos,3aycag,JohnBoy347,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:40:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely confirmed by the now extinct DeadWood Stage website which was always accurate and also had the names of new characters/extras from call sheets for casting agents months before the episodes were even filmed. You may be able to find it in the Chase lounge spoilers archives as well.  ""A Few Kind Words"" for ""Sopranos Home Movies"" makes sense as Tony says in the episode that that quote was all his father used to say that he wanted on his birthday.  ""Sonya"" was the name of Christopher's mistress in ""Kennedy and Heidi"" so it makes sense that may have been a working title for that episode.  ""The End of the Line"" makes sense for ""Blue Comet"" as it was the end of the line for Tony's crew as Phil decides to take them out and also ties into the toy trains as ""end of the line"" is an expression for the end of a train trip. And ""Going Home"" could refer to Carmela complaining to Tony that she just wanted to get home when she was at the safe house, which they eventually do.  It could also refer to the all American Holsten's.  But of course we also know that its real meaning would have been Tony's death for the reasons you correctly pointed out as well as the Inn at the Oaks look a like mural at Holsten's also a call back to the Steve Buscemi line in Mayham."

Then in the scene OP linked, you see two other instances of stage 5. One being Phil thinking about his legacy and being fed up, ultimately deciding to step up and fill the void at the top in NY (I think he takes out Doc Santoro the next episode but that might be wrong). The other is the relationship between Tony and Chris being completely and irreversibly damaged. They can't go back to how it used to be between them.

But he didn't. Whether this is the end here, or not, it's going to come at some point for the rest of us. Hopefully we're not going to get shot by some rival gang mob or anything like that. I'm not saying that [happened]. But obviously he stood more of a chance of getting shot by a rival gang mob than you or I do because he put himself in that situation. All I know is the end is coming for all of us.""

thesopranos,3athjy,Sopranola,32,Tue Jun 23 11:23:39 2015 UTC,"In an interview with Alan Sepinwall just before season six, David Chase said of Join the Club, ""I, frankly, would not call those (episode two scenes) dreams"", seemingly implying that Tony's west coast trip was more than just his subconscious trying to make sense of the trauma it had just sustained. That in the universe of The Sopranos, a far more mysterious, spiritual realm of some sort literally exists. The obvious interpretation is some sort of representation of purgatory.  There's a shot early on in the episode where Tony is in the hotel bar trying to call his family, and he's framed perfectly between a television set displaying flames and the large window where the serenity of the beacon lights up in the distance. And there's Tony, stuck between two fates. I think that one shot sums up the entire purpose of the episode.  But there's a lot more going on than just that. In this strange state, he's also being given every subtle hint to turn his life around upon waking. Not-Carmela on the phone points out that while he didn't even want to take this trip (that is, get shot by Junior), he's too wrapped up in his work (""This is partly your fault""). The monks tell him again and again that he needs to ""take responsibility"" or face the consequences. After a fall down the stairs sends him to the emergency room, he's urged to ""talk to his own docs back home"" (Melfi) to discuss the ""dark areas"" found in his brain. Everything is screaming at Tony as he finds himself suspended between life and death, heaven and hell, to get his shit together.  Edit: Plenty of other little ""Easter eggs"" throughout that aren't necessarily here nor there. Some clever wordplay with the Kevin Finnerty/Infinity thing, the bartender describing Costa Mesa as a ""dead"" city. Tony orders a grouper sandwich as a callback to Pussy. The cute, innocuous teddy bear Tony encounters (""Please Bear With Us"") serves as a counterpoint to the much scarier, more menacing bear that was previously associated with Tony in season five. Join the Club is one of my favorite episodes, just because of how jam-packed it is with things to pick up on.   This episode is also far more interesting to look at against Kennedy & Heidi later on, which provides a kind of hellish inversion of this west-coast trip - one where he can again ""be someone else"", but that time uses it as an opportunity to act out all his most base impulses and desires."

When he finally reaches that house and Tony B tells him he can't take it in with him, and he hesitates...Tony B is dead and likely in hell, where he would take Tony too. Tony can't let go of his briefcase, which symbolizes his soul or life and decides to stay with it and comes out of his coma. Was Tony spending all the time in his dream trying to get back to his briefcase or back to his real life? In the dream it is his briefcase though, Kevin's. He just truing to go back to being Tony."
thesopranos,3athjy,Poopieheadsavant,15,Tue Jun 23 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this episode was modeled after the experience David Chase had watching John Patterson die, who actually muttered the words ""Who am I? Where am I going?"" when close to the end. And it's there that Chase got the theme of loss of identity as tying into death. I think playing to this theme of identity loss is where the briefcase mixup initially came in (as well as the Alzheimer's thing, where Tony briefly wonders if it's possible he actually was Finnerty all along).  Anyway, I've always viewed the briefcase as representative of Tony's ""work"", which is an obvious connection. But it's a line of work that has completely eroded his soul, consumed his entire life, and completely informs his self-identity. He is completely defined - as a man, as a moral agent, etc. - by the work he does.  And it's that identity that needs to be shed in order to enter the Inn at the Oaks. Notice Steve Buscemi is credited only as ""Man"" in the episode with no mention of Tony B. When Tony asks if Finnerty is there (by name), ""Man"" replies ""We don't talk like that here."" The briefcase is who Tony is, and that's what must be jettisoned. Earlier, when he asked the question ""Who am I?"", we see now that the answer in death is simply ""no one""."

Admittedly, it seems to have a somewhat different take than what I went on about above. The link seems to go to the right page, but in case it doesn't, you're looking for page 56:   In an interview at the start of that season, I commended Chase on the bold choice to do a two-part dream episode, given how divisive they had been in the past. “I, frankly, would not call those dreams,” he said cryptically at the time, inspiring many theories (including my own) about Tony moving through Purgatory or some other section of the afterlife. Asked now what those episodes (in which Tony is mistaken for a salesman named Kevin Finnerty) represented, Chase says, “Alternate universes. Now, I have no proof. That’s what I consider them, as an artist. Something spiritual was happening with Kevin Finnerty; it wasn’t in ‘The Test Dream.’”   The sequence was inspired by Chase’s longtime friend John Patterson, who directed many episodes of the series before dying of cancer in 2005. At one point in his cancer fight, Patterson found himself in the hospital, muttering the same words - “Who am I? Where am I going” - that Chase would put into the mouths of both Tony in his hospital bed and Kevin Finery in the alternate reality. “The way my mind worked,” Chase says, “I wondered what he was seeing when he said that …The line between dream and reality, and death and sleep and all that - I’m into that whole thing.”"

I don't think Michele de Cesare was that bad an actress, and certainly no worse than the other young leads in the early goings. Robert Iler and Jamie-Lynn Sigler were both pretty rocky at the start - and part of the responsibility for that fell on Chase and his team, who weren't really sure how to write for them yet. His daughter brought just as much competency to the proceedings in her very limited screen-time as the others did - which is to say, not much, but she was passable.  Second, the ""nepotism"" doesn't bother me. This wasn't a political office we're talking about here, it was a piece of artwork that was very near and dear to Chase's heart. The shadow of his own mother loomed large over the series. He packed in a lifetime of his own experiences and hints of people he'd encountered. It was a very personal project for him, and it makes perfect sense to me why he'd think to involve his daughter.  Eh, so that's one take."

thesopranos,3aoydy,oroszorszag,13,Mon Jun 22 09:00:49 2015 UTC,"I guess this is my time to chime in...  The vast majority of Italian immigrants to America hailed from the South.  Much like other parts of the world, pronunciations vary by region.  In Italy's case, different regions had/have their own language unto itself.  Oftentimes these are referred to as ""dialects"", although linguistically speaking, they qualify as languages.  There are so many details here that are important to understanding this further.  Italy wasn't a unified country until 1865, and it took almost 100 years before the Standard Italian language permeated the entirity of ""The Boot"".  School wasn't even mandatory for children until the middle of the last century!  So, considering that almost all Italian-Americans started their American Dream before the standardization of the Italian language, they spoke their regional dialect.  Most of the Southern dialects are mutually intelligible amongst other Southerners, with some exceptions.  For example, Neapolitan and Calabrian are very similar, while the dialects of Puglia baffle most other Southerners.  One unique feature of ""The Sopranos"" is the predominantly Neapolitan heritage of the crime family.  The Mafia itself was born in Sicily, and oftentimes Sicilian gangsters saw their Neapolitan counterparts as ""lesser wiseguys"", so to speak.  In fact, the novel version of ""The Godfather"" touches on this a bit.  Also, there's an old quote from a Sicilian-American mobster poking fun at Al Capone, saying that his ""Neapolitan ass"" ran off to Chicago because he couldn't hack it in New York.  Now, let me share with you all some common features of the Southern dialects:   The 'c' is pronounced as a soft 'g'. A single 'd' can sometimes turn into a single 'r', depending on the syllable. The single 't' comes across as a soft 'd'. The final vowel of a word is often dropped or ""swallowed"" in casual, everyday speech (sometimes attributed to Spanish rule over parts of Southern Italy). The ""gl"" sound is softened to resemble the English 'y', like in sfoo-ya-dell (sfogliatella).  By the way, in Standard Italian, the ""gl"" sounds like the ""ill"" cluster in the British pronunciation of ""m-ILL-ionaire"". The 'o' sounds closer to the 'u' of Standard Italian.   Being a second-generation Italian-American from Naples, I often have to explain this to Americans who begin to pickup some of the Italian language or culture and then suddenly come to the conclusion that all of us ""Brooklyn Italians"" are ""wrong"".  Like many things in life, it's not wrong.  Instead, it's different.  That being said, in Italy today, dialects are not an acceptable form of speech in school, the professional workplace, or in government.  However, they're still alive and well in the home, on the street, amongst fishermen, and in almost all other areas of life, especially music.  Naples, in particular, has the most popular musical tradition in all of Italy, hands down (just think ""`O Sole Mio"").  In order for Neapolitan music to truly be Neapolitan, it must be sung as such.  When Andrea Bocelli beautifully belts out a Neapolitan tune, it sounds great, but all of us from the South cringe a little at his pronunciations.  The same can be said for Pavarotti, although he tried a lot harder than Bocelli to be accurate.  I'd also like to add that Furio Giunta speaks almost exclusively in Neapolitan dialect throughout the show, including the conversation he has with that old man at his father's funeral back in Italy about his secret love for Carmela.  So, if you were to go to Southern Italy today and use these pronunciations, they wouldn't put their nose down at you.  Instead, they'd be amused that you're a foreigner who somehow learned their local pronunciation rather than the ""proper"" one.  By the way, check out the film ""Gomorrah"" and listen as every single person, aside from those on their business trips to the North and a few other minor exceptions, speaks in the Neapolitan dialect.  In fact, you can even hear someone say ""mooz-a-dell""!  Okay, I'm done now... haha.  If anyone has any questions, I'm more than happy to answer.  Edit:  One thing I forgot to add was that the Neapolitan heritage of the Sopranos crew was intended to parallel the inferiority of their status as ""that pygmy thing over in Jersey"".  Edit 2: I also forgot to mention that the Italian hitmen brought over to the US also spoke exclusively in the Neapolitan dialect, the only exception being when they were asked if they spoke English by Corke (Chris' junkie friend) and responded, ""Natta samma too much."""

thesopranos,3ak47h,UniversalPolymath,-1,Sun Jun 21 02:05:13 2015 UTC,"It's meant to simply add realism to the universe of the series.   And I'm with you there on the Cokes, the Cadillacs, etc.  But no TV manufacturer has a white label on the front of their TV with their brand in 2"" high black letters.  In fact there's one scene at Junior's place where it cuts back and forth and some times the label is there, other times it's not, and the real label was just a small metallic badge on the front of the TV.    It's a nit-pick, to be sure.  This show really holds up extraordinarily well to re-watching, and I'm loving the HD transfers for the most part.  If it weren't for all the standard-def televisions and corded telephones, you'd hardly guess this was a show who had a full three seasons under it's belt before 9/11 even happened.

I understand that, product placement is nothing new, but what's irritating me are the artificial labels affixed to TV's that either aren't philips or whose logos weren't large enough, it's crazy.    Were the original masters this bad, or was this something they digitally added in post for the HD remasters?  I don't remember noticing it the first time around.    Edit - Based on this avsforum post from 2001, this was definitely in the originals.  Crazy that I managed to somehow not notice it the first time around.  Granted, the first time I saw it was on a 25"" SDTV in college, and now I own a 65"" 1080p HDTV, so maybe that's it.  Who knows, maybe I'm just not very perceptive."

He had such renewed hope in Christopher (who he saw as a son) and now he realizes it was all for nothing.   This is in total contrast to ""The Ride"" where Tony and Christopher drink wine and tell each other how much they love each other.

I felt like I knew him, even though I had spent hundreds of hours with just a character he played, not the great man himself. Yet there's something beautiful he imparted even through such an often evil character, which made him connect on a deep level with millions. Maybe it's the inherent sadness and the boyish innocence apparent in his eyes, as Chase once pointed out. Consciously or not, you sense the disparity between that flicker of sadness and joy and pure human-ness in those eyes and the brutally inhuman world he's forced to move in, and it breaks your heart.

thesopranos,3afl68,woopthat,17,Fri Jun 19 18:59:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's for the simple fact that most people come away remembering only the actual Pine Barrens story. Your average fan probably couldn't tell you this is the same episode with Jackie, Jr. spelling ""ass"" in Scrabble.   And to be fair the Paulie/Chrissy story is the ""A story"" from this episode so it does edge out Tony/Gloria a little bit. Even Tony's story eventually converges and becomes about him rescuing his hapless employees."

But even the Paulie/Chrissy story takes places across four different sets, one of which is a big expansive wooded area. The ""bottled"" part of the episode isn't even bottled.  Maybe people are just looking get off on identifying a bottle episode and jump at this one?"
thesopranos,3afl68,nofuckinpodcast,6,Fri Jun 19 19:29:55 2015 UTC,"Haha possibly. That word has kind of been bastardized in the past few years as TV became more popular.  One other thing that might make people think that is that the story itself is self-contained, which might cause some of the confusion. While talk of the Russian comes up every so often, for the most part everything about that story is in that episode and that episode alone."

There was a lot of friction between Paulie and Chrissy before this and I think they got a lot closer during and after this episode.  Also, Meadow finally realized that Jackie is a skeeze and that was a pretty big deal.  I would never compare this episode to some garbage episode like ""Fly"", and haven't heard anyone else do so. ""Fly"" fucking sucked, it was the most useless episode in the whole series."

thesopranos,3ah0n3,Mordred7,16,Sat Jun 20 02:35:02 2015 UTC,You're asking a group of people who love The Sopranos so much we engage in discussion about it on the reg. Most of us have probably watched it more than once.  So yes.
thesopranos,3ah0n3,multimania,11,Sat Jun 20 16:28:22 2015 UTC,Stuff is happening. Just let it breathe.
thesopranos,3ah0n3,chicanos909,11,Sat Jun 20 04:40:08 2015 UTC,"To be honest, if you don't like it after two season then the show may not be for you. Nothing outrageously exciting will happen in s3 or s4 and there will be no massive cliffhangers or whatever when compared to s1 or s2. It's not that kind of show.   The Sopranos is a journey, and if you aren't into it after two seasons and don't like the pace or even don't love some of the characters, I don't think keep watching it will make you feel any different."
thesopranos,3ah0n3,Poopieheadsavant,5,Sat Jun 20 05:41:09 2015 UTC,"The show at it's core is actually very episodic despite being categorized as a serial drama. That isn't to say there aren't any recurring plot lines(there is at least one main recurring arc for every season), it's just presented differently compared to something like Breaking Bad where the main plot is always at the forefront and the main driving force.   The Sopranos, first and foremost is about Tony, what his life looks like. That naturally makes it so that the series can dive into all different kinds of direction. It's why you get one episode with Tony dealing with the Black Cop, and another episode where he's traveling to Italy. Two different episodes that basically have no business with one another other than to make us discover things about Tony from two very different events of his life.   Compare this to a show like Breaking Bad where the premise of the show doesn't allow for as much divergence. That show is about Walt actively becoming a druglord/getting into the drug business, so the plots will largely be contained to that area. It's why there isn't an episode in Breaking Bad where there's not something drug related/actively moving to plot foward. Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones are basically as serial as a drama can get. Any irrelevant plots/aspects of the characters life that doesn't tie to past episodes or is related to the main premise is not presented or not nearly as much. It feels more 'focused' in that sense. The Sopranos (and Mad Men for that manner) goes against this as their premises are more broad and largely about the general life of their respected characters( Tony / Don Draper). While Breaking Bad isn't about 'Walt's life' it's 'Walt's life in the context of his drug dealings and how it affects his family"" it's just more narrow in that sense.  This is the reason you're probably feeling like ""nothing is happening"". This series has always been about discovering who Tony is and a lot of episodes are only connected by the fact that Tony is in it and they may not necessarily relate to each other.  With that being said there actually are recurring plots in the series, at least one main in each respective season. In  season 1, it's Tony's deteriorating relationship between his Uncle/Mom that ultimately leads his attempted assassination attempt, which was set up from the very first episode BTW. And in the second season it was his conflict with Richie Aprile (along with Pussy's sideplot of being a rat).  The thing is that, even with these recurring arcs, they aren't in the forefront of every episode, and frankly it most episodes it's actually just absent. That's just the nature of the series. A show like Breaking Bad goes about it differently and has Walts' cat n mouse game with Gus at the forefront of every episode. That's the main difference.  Ultimately, this may not be a popular suggestion but, if you don't enjoy the first 2 seasons because you feel like ""nothing is happening"", I don't really see you enjoying the future seasons because it's largely the same style of storytelling. There could be some individualistic elements and aspects of the show that you may end up falling in love with(like I did) but ultimately the show doesn't change it's formula(or lack thereof).  Edit: Reworded some of the sentences and phrasing so it conveys my point a bit clearer."
thesopranos,3ah0n3,YoYoSun,3,Sat Jun 20 06:09:14 2015 UTC,"You should, because there are another four seasons worth of Oh's and Ho's that you haven't yet seen.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRkE_Gv6ALM"
thesopranos,3ah0n3,Foothill_r34,6,Sat Jun 20 13:24:02 2015 UTC,"I'm of the opinion that the show only gets better. Season four was a bit of a turning point for the series where it began to take on a different pace and tone, and then it just kept topping itself each year after that (with the final season being my favorite stretch of episodes of any series, period).  Alright, that said, it depends on what you're looking for out of the show or where your interests in it lie. If you feel like nothing's really happened in the first two seasons, I can tell you right now you're probably going to feel like even less is happening as the series go on. I think you might wanna consider filing this one away as ""not for you""."
thesopranos,3ah0n3,UniversalPolymath,2,Sat Jun 20 04:31:15 2015 UTC,I've learned that every series generally take 2 seasons for it to take form. I gave it 2 and was glad I stuck with it.
thesopranos,3ah0n3,TonyBelfort,2,Sat Jun 20 16:55:06 2015 UTC,"I think the first two seasons are the weakest (though S2 is pretty fucking great and it's mostly S1 I have problems with) -- from 3 onward it's just pure fucking brilliance basically. It gets darker and more subtle and more ""artistic,"" for lack of a better word, if that sounds appealing to you. As noted by others, it's not the kind of show where it's great because crazy shit happens every week or even most weeks; it's a character-based drama that happens to be set in the mob world where sometimes people do get killed or beat, but it's not interested in the killings and beatings as an end unto themselves. If you're not interested or invested in the characters then you probably won't get much out of it. But, seeing as you've come this far and you do like it, absolutely keep on going. Maybe give it to the end of Season 4 or some of 5 and see how you feel then.  Honestly, I felt pretty similarly to you the first time I watched the show. I liked it, but I just wanted it to be The Wire (which I was obsessed with at the time) so badly that I couldn't see its own strengths. But a couple years later I rewatched it and saw what I was missing, big time. For many people, it's a show that grows on you. So give it time, and give it a chance, as the first two seasons (though often fantastic) are hardly indicative of what the whole series has to offer."
thesopranos,3ah0n3,somerton,0,Sun Jun 21 23:01:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks the comment. Yeah I just finished the Wire not too long ago and I this show was mentioned as another good one. The Wire spoiled me man, there was something awesome happening every episode. I'll probably end up finishing this show."
thesopranos,3ah0n3,thisishardcore_,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:36:06 2015 UTC,"I'm up to Season 4 and for me the show gets more compelling with each season. For me, the show truly became amazing in the third one though.  Don't get me wrong, I thought the first two were really great but like you say there's a lot of standalone episodes in it, whereas I prefer the show when the episodes are part of the big storylines.  Just wait until you meet Ralphie. One of the best characters and strangely I feel more empathetic towards him than most of the other people on the show (despite that thing he does in S3E6). Maybe it's because it seems like he's portrayed as something of an underdog because he just doesn't quite fit in with Tony and the others."

That episode is generally the litmus test for whether someone is going to be a fan or not. I generally recommend people watch till that point and decide based on that.  Season 3 has some incredibly highly regarded standout episodes though. Sopranos has an incredibly strong reputation, so if you want to know for sure then push ahead a little more. But it seems like it might not totally be your kind of show, which is fine.  Season 4 includes what I consider to be the best episode of any show in it, so there's that. But 4 seasons is a crazy amount to watch for a show you're not super into."

As for in between the seasons, Janice's wedding definitely would've been notable."
thesopranos,3a9ylz,thatsnotwhatimsaying,15,Thu Jun 18 13:21:19 2015 UTC,"My guess is the truth is Artie wore his emotions on his sleeve and Tony was better at hiding it. So Artie was ""the worst"" because he'd be more likely to tell a teacher to fuck off whereas Tony knew to be on good behavior around anyone who could get him in trouble. That, plus he could probably manipulate his way out of a lot of things. Adults are often wrong about who the real ""bad kid"" is.   Charmaine probably was a positive influence but even without her, let's face it, Artie was never cut out to run with Tony's crew."

Its possible to do a multi-thread, multi-main character series well -- hell, they literally make the main cast be the backbone but every season they re-populate with great characters who have main-character like roles. Unfortunately the combo of the source books getting worse -- its clear Martin meant to write between 1 and 3 books and its been like 3 books of filler now -- and the show runners being not particularly good at what they do and you have what they do now, a progressively worse show that genuinely confused good writing with shock effect. GOT is basically Lost now, just stumbling towards a resolution they have no idea how to implement, one dumb, 'shock moment' at a time."

What if the last few seasons are absolutely terrible?  Anyway, a lot of this is the recency bias and the simple fact that many GoT fans are probably a little younger and don't understand the context of The Sopranos. And also, let's face it: a huge draw to GoT is all the death, blood and gore. Notice how any time there's a big battle scene, the next day people are already calling that their best episode yet. GoT is exciting for many. For me, that kind of stuff only goes so far.   Still, I have to agree with some others in here that maybe you're being a little bit harsh. It's a fun show. It doesn't have as much to say as The Sopranos, but it's entertaining."

thesopranos,3a738l,edgorm82,2,Thu Jun 18 00:20:08 2015 UTC,"I can barely put them on the same plane to be compared. GoT is the kind of show that has so many storylines and characters to cover that every episode appears to have the same amount of 'intensity.' In other words, I have a hard time putting one episode of Game of Thrones over another. That being said, I'm almost always satisfied with GoT at the end of every episode. (I also kinda felt this way about Breaking Bad: consistently good, but flat-lined intensity/satisfaction.)  When it comes to Sopranos (and Mad Men), it's easier to differentiate between the episodes that are kinda standard, and the episodes that are SO FUCKING AMAZING that they leave you thinking, possibly prompting you to revisit them as singular elements. I'm hard-pressed to find the GoT equivalent to ""Pine Barrens"" or ""The Suitcase,"" because that's not how that show operates.  I think these two formats of show appeal to different types of people. For the GoT/Breaking Bad crowd, it may be more about the advancement of plotlines and action sequences. For the Sopranos/Mad Men bunch, it seems to be more about subtleties, dialogue and character interactions. I identify much more with the latter, and I sometimes catch people in the former telling me that the Sopranos and Mad Men are 'boring.' Different types I guess..."

thesopranos,3a738l,johnwithcheese,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:18:44 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it - could Game of Thrones make a seasons like The Sopranos did in season four? Obviously, each season has so much going on, but four is always brought up for how character driven it is and how little of an influence violence has on the plot.  With Game of Thrones, think about EVERY water cooler discussion and thread topic after each episode. What is it about? Who died that week. That's the hook of the show - shocking the viewer with who is murdered and how. The characters are not compelling enough to carry the show themselves, it needs the violence and sex to keep people watching.  It's a very empty show."
thesopranos,3a738l,DermotBologna,4,Wed Jun 17 20:59:55 2015 UTC,that's actually just entirely wrong.

thesopranos,3a738l,bigPUNnbigFUN,3,Thu Jun 18 00:03:26 2015 UTC,"The show has to stand on it's own though. How good the books are doesn't change how good the series is in any way in my opinion.   I think GoT is good and have watched all five seasons of it (except the last few episodes). But I think It's an entirely different beast from The Sopranos.   Rewatchability is one thing. I'm currently rewatching The Sopranos for the third time because of the brilliant writing and acting, lifelike characters (for one thing all lead characters in The Sopranos have insecurities and sometimes outright pathetic sides, what's pathetic about Jon Snow, Ned Stark, Tywin Lannister or Daenerys Targaryen?) subtle storytelling, symbolism etc. The attraction for me with GoT is mainly excitement. Intrigues, who dies, battles and duels and so on. I don't think I will ever rewatch entire GoT but I'm sure there's a lot of people who will."
thesopranos,3a738l,NowNowMyGoodMan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:29:41 2015 UTC,"Sure, it stands on its own and should. I'm just saying that you would have to try really hard to make an empty vessel out of a show if it's based on such an expansive type of source. For me, GOT is rewatchable, but I can see how it wouldn't be to some. And I do agree, they're two totally different beasts. But there are some things, like content and the use of violence, that I think can be compared to each other :).   If you want the insight to the characters in GOT, you'd probably have to read the books. Jon Snow's pathetic side lies in his constant doubting, his almost sickening drive to ""be a Stark"" all the time. Ned's constant want to be ""honorable"", when a slightly dishonorable move might have enabled him to keep his head. Tywin Lannister's sad denial of his children's relations.. Stuff like that doesn't really come out in the show to its full extent, it's undoubtedly in there, but it's more under the surface, whereas the books can really delve into that because they're always in those person's heads."
thesopranos,3a738l,bigPUNnbigFUN,2,Thu Jun 18 16:50:42 2015 UTC,"If you want the insight to the characters in GOT, you'd probably have to read the books.   But doesn't this statement support my argument about the series? And as you describe it Ned Starks weakness is also his greatest strength. The same goes for Jon Snow or Tywin. They all have one very dominant personality trait which make their behavior predictable. In The Sopranos characters have so many conflicting sides which make them come alive in another way. One reason for the difference may be the shear amount of major characters in GoT. The format doesn't allow enough time to really expand on them and if they tried to the result might be confusing to the viewer."
thesopranos,3a738l,NowNowMyGoodMan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:33:03 2015 UTC,"Well no, it doesn't. It just says that the series has less of something of which the books have more. This doesn't mean the series is bad or that it relies entirely on the things you mentioned. Well, I'm not sure if you've seen the entire season by now, but I can tell you that the characters in GOT are not entirely predictable. As you know, Ned wanted to confess, something he wouldn't do if he was predictable. There's also something Jon Snow does that goes entirely against his trying-to-be-a-Stark. I won't elaborate because I don't know when this happens in the last season and how far you've come. So saying they're predictable doesn't entirely hold up.. I can see your point, and I'd like to say that I hold The Sopranos on a waaaay higher level than I do GOT. I think if we'd meet each other halfway, we'd both agree. The series isn't entirely void of insight, dynamic or unpredictable characters, while it could also use a bit more of that.   I'm probably biased because I have read the books and thus ""know"" more about the characters. That's probably hindering me in fully discussing this with people who have only watched the show, as I tend to rush over it because I have context from the books, so I have the imagined extra info that's not readily available in the show."
thesopranos,3a738l,bigPUNnbigFUN,2,Fri Jun 19 12:55:22 2015 UTC,"I agree of course. I'm only making the argument because I'm comparing the show with The Sopranos.

You can't just say ""you're wrong"" without explaining why to a person and expect them to suddenly go, ""Oh! I AM wrong!"" That is idiotic.    but I love the books. And calling it an empty show, seeing as how it's based on those books, is just downright idiotic   OP is talking about the adapted television series, not the books.

The political intrigue is on par with the best epic tales of our times. Maybe you don't ""get"" that out of the show, but it's in there. And it's not the show's fault that you can't see that. How is the violence employed differently in GOT than it is in The Sopranos? Character insight, motivation, intrigue and evolution. I'm fine with people not liking the show, hell I'm not crazy about it myself, but I do expect well thought out arguments for it - like you expected from me - and not some mumbo jumbo you read on some opinionated online blog one of your friends has that doesn't go past the surface of things and doesn't know half of the things the story references in its dynamic and historical context."

Too much violence without it having ""value""? Nudity and therefore probably misogyny? Please. You think people didn't used to watch The Sop's for the violence and probably exclusively so?

And just because you don't like the show and thus conclude that its watchers are exclusively the second type, does not mean that in its content it's different from another show."
thesopranos,3a738l,bigPUNnbigFUN,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:45:07 2015 UTC,"You seem to be missing my point. I am sure lots of people watched The Sopranos for just the violence and sex, (that is why Season 4 has such a low rating in imdb), but The Sopranos is capable of telling engaging stories without having to rely on violence and sex, unlike Game of Thrones. Do you understand?  You might not be approaching GoT with an objective viewpoint because you're clouded by your love for the books. I am not alone as a viewer who has never read the books to feel as there is just little to no depth to the story and characters. What are the themes of The Sopranos? What are the themes of Game of Thrones? One is easier to answer than the other.  You said in another comment the violence in Thrones is ""character-evolving"" and used as an ""insight-lending device."" I stopped watching two episodes into this seasons because it was a bore, and I only watched the rest of the series once, but I struggle to come up with an example where the violence played a necessary role, (think the Melfi rape in Season 3.) I also struggle to think of any character evolution and/or insight-lending devices that occurred that did not involve violence. Do you have examples?"
thesopranos,3a738l,DermotBologna,2,Thu Jun 18 21:03:15 2015 UTC,"It's weird, I actually find Tony's interactions with his family and other characters much more interesting than the violence and gang-related stuff.  The show is at it's best, not when Tony and Paulie and the others are planning a heist, or discussing money, but when tensions are running between Tony and someone else, and not necessarily tensions that result in someone being killed either."
thesopranos,3a738l,thisishardcore_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:39:50 2015 UTC,"Well I could give some.. Viserys' death strengthened Dany in her resolve (at least it did at the time) to rule as Mother of Dragons, with strength, justice and a firm hand. Theon's torture and subsequent breaking served as a reminder by George that no one person is fully good, nor fully bad, and are always driven by personal reasons to ends that might not have been foreseen. In the last few episodes, something Stannis does is clearly seen as a reason for his men to abandon him, where if he hadn't done it things might've turned out totally different. These are things that drive the plot. There's also for example the Red Wedding, at which the peaceful Catelyn Stark sees her child murdered and is all of a sudden willing to murder an innocent child as well. I could expand on this but the show has done some things different from the books so it wouldn't be entirely fair. Arya is entirely changed as a character by the violence inflicted on her family, and it determines the rest of her storyline pretty much exclusively.   I would also argue that Melfi's rape is actually pretty much not that meaningful or purposeful. Except for her character, what does it really matter in the grand scheme of things? Okay, it gives her an inner struggle of being able to link into the violent world of Tony, but since she doesn't, how is that really important?  But wait, I don't understand your question now that I'm rereading it.   ""but I struggle to come up with an example where the violence played a necessary role""  ""I also struggle to think of any character evolution and/or insight-lending devices that occurred that did not involve violence.""  Wait.. Did we jump series in the middle there or.. ? Sorry, honestly don't know what you're asking now."

It is ironic that this season was more about political games and re-deals, than the other ones. I have heard more than enough people claim they loved this. So your ""engaging"" story-telling you're looking for, and your lack of finding it, may say more about what draws you into a story than about the story itself. It's a sort of dead-end discussion really, you saying they can only tell engaging stories with violence and sex, and then dropping off when they do exactly the opposite of that. It's the same thing with S04 of Sopranos. You and I (I'm going out on a limb here) found this season to be engaging. The ratings show something else. So what does that say about ""engaging""? Subjective.  edit: by which I mean to say that if you don't think it's engaging, it's terribly short-sighted to expand this to everybody watching the show. It's an attempt to go from subjective to objective, and that's never a good idea because it will inherently fall short of qualifications.  If we come back to my first point, which is really the only one I wanted to make, it's that this series is not empty. I hate such overstatements and hyperboles. That's also what I meant with the blog-comparison I drew. I said this in another discussion in this same thread:   ""I think if we'd meet each other halfway, we'd both agree. The series isn't entirely void of insight, dynamic or unpredictable characters, while it could also use a bit more of that. I'm probably biased because I have read the books and thus ""know"" more about the characters. That's probably hindering me in fully discussing this with people who have only watched the show, as I tend to rush over it because I have context from the books, so I have the imagined extra info that's not readily available in the show.""  So there, I think this applies here as well."
thesopranos,3a738l,bigPUNnbigFUN,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:18:07 2015 UTC,I definitely agree. The acting is awful in GoT outside of maybe 3 of them. The writing is also not very good compared to Sopranos and it relies on shock value/violence/sex to keep the views and water-cooler talk up. I will say GoT has some badass action scenes and the story is much more interesting than Sopranos

What pisses me off the most however is when people say Breaking Bad is better than The Sopranos, without ever having watched The Sopranos. Yeah, Breaking Bad is a good watch but wouldn't exist without The Sopranos which is a much better show with considerably better acting. Compare Carmela to Skyler for instance. Or Christopher to Jesse. They just don't stand up."
thesopranos,3a738l,CuntAssFUCK,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:24:32 2015 UTC,"I started watching The Sopranos after Breaking Bad and it became apparent just how much Vince Gilligan owes to this show. Breaking Bad is still great and it's the show that turned me onto TV drama, but having watched The Wire and The Sopranos since it struck me as a bit one dimensional on my rewatch.  It's still hugely entertaining, and I think more than anything that's why it became so huge. It didn't even become popular until around Seasons 3 or 4 which was when the show started becoming more action driven."

It's set in a universe where magic is real and dragons fly the sky, GRRM made his own world with different races and geneologys that span thousands of years and a history to match that...

Just thought that was extremely random. Juniors eyes when he proclaims his disgust at Ritchie for suggesting Tony getting clipped. Ritchie pointing out Uncle Juniors hypocrisy toward him because Tony was meant to be clipped by Junior a year prior. Junior tells Rich that the Soprano he should ultimately be worried about is Janice because she stole from him as a ten year old. This was one of the greatest foreshadowings as Janice went on to kill Ritchie.    You can see it on youtube, Im on mobile so i dont feel like linking it."

Which is part of what makes it so interesting -- that scene would be so much less powerful than it is if it simply took place at Vesuvio.  Throughout the show you see a few, but not many, all-Amercan type diners similar to Holstens. For example, the New Hampshire joint where Vito has his first taste of Johnny Cakes... the diner that pops up a few times in S5 when Tony meets up with Massarone... the roadside diner where Tony surprises Melfi in the S2 premiere... the ultra-modern dive in S4E7 where Tony discovers the HUD scheme with Cousin Brian and Ralph, all hungover... the cool little place in S3E8 that we only see once (I think) where Ralph brags to Vito and Eugene about how much better than Tony he is... the place where Chris is coming out of in S2 when he gets shot by Tweedledee and Tweedledum... the atmospheric diner in Kaisha where Chris and Juliana meet.... wait, nevermind, there's actually a good amount of diners in the series I guess. The thing is just that they're largely used in short throwaway scenes or for the characters to grab a quick bite, and Italian places like Vesuvio are mostly prized over those all-American joints for dining and business purposes."

thesopranos,39ts40,drootire,2,Tue Jun 16 02:57:03 2015 UTC,I think because of the omission they could go in that direction with Meadow. I don't consider it so if they deleted it. Very interesting though! Thanks for doing the digging! I'll have to watch the deleted scenes now.

thesopranos,39anc0,UniversalPolymath,6,Wed Jun 10 13:31:46 2015 UTC,"I have never been more excited, before or since, for a television event as I was for Made in America. My Sopranos obsession had leveled off at “fever pitch” for some time by that point, but The Blue Comet especially made the week leading up to the finale feel almost unbearably long. I lived on The Chase Lounge and TWOP forums soaking up every single bit of excited speculation I could, but nothing prepared me for what David Chase actually pulled off.  To be sure, there were plenty of folks who absolutely hated the final scene in particular (and it's cast a shadow over people's perception of the whole episode, and even more ridiculously, the whole series for some others), and no doubt always will. But I think the huge range of reactions - and the sheer number of words that have been written trying to unlock its meaning, a number I couldn’t even begin to calculate - only points to what an incredibly bold, challenging piece of artwork those last few minutes truly represented. Love it or hate it, and putting all bickering over its meaning aside (please), there’s no denying its impact.  So here’s to a fascinating piece of work that I have no doubt will continue to be hotly debated in another eight years - and to the incredible episode that preceded it, which will unfortunately always be eclipsed by a black screen."
thesopranos,39anc0,nofuckinpodcast,6,Wed Jun 10 13:36:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah honestly let's not forget the excellent, classic Sopranos episode that made up the first 55 minutes of ""Made in America."" It's damn near perfect."
thesopranos,39anc0,MadBigMadBoatMan,3,Wed Jun 10 13:43:49 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, and I admit to shamelessly contributing to that with the bulk of my post here. But it is (nearly) perfectly constructed from beginning to end - wonderfully paced and full of odd, disorienting edits and beautifully composed images. It just felt like a very different episode, no doubt in part because it was the finale, but also in large part because Chase himself was at the helm. Left me really wishing he had decided to direct more episodes of the series, because the ""unadulterated Chase experience"" represented only here and in the pilot really was something to behold."
thesopranos,39anc0,YoungJolie,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:09:52 2015 UTC,"I guess I can see why hating the ending puts the whole series in a new light. The last two episodes of Breaking Bad did that for me, it took away the magic, and thus exposed the series to critical asessment. Had they ended on the third-to-last episode, I suppose I'd still remember it as one of the best shows ever.  The Sopranos, on the other hand, ended perfectly. I subsribe to the ""Tony was clipped"" theory, so I can't think of a better ending."
thesopranos,39anc0,porkrines,2,Sat Jun 13 05:16:45 2015 UTC,"So haunting, because once you realise it was from Tony's POV and understand his fate, your mind can picture the scene afterwards. The ending preserved his dignity as the boss, we didn't need to see what came after that - he gives the audience credit for being able to imagine the rest.  I keep rewatching the last scene, the Journey song is imprinted in my soul forever now from that scene."
thesopranos,39anc0,sryguys,3,Sun Jun 21 18:25:41 2015 UTC,"I honestly still get chills thinking about the scene, and teary eyed. That Journey song will also forever remind me of that scene. You know the funny thing? I remember before I got into the Sopranos, I looked up ""the ending scene"" because I was too lazy to watch the series and thought I could learn a lot about the show in the very last scene (lol) and I was totally confused about what happened. I looked up the ending because people mentioned Chase's ""weird cut to black endings"". Yes, ending(s). So I figured it was a weird cinematographic thing Chase did for ALL the episodes ending, not just the series finale. Even after binge watching the show and seeing the ending, I still wasn't able to piece it together. I thought that the random cut to black signified that ""that's it... life goes on"". But after reading the 4 page analysis on wordpress about the ending, it's just impossible to argue that Tony wasn't killed in that scene."
thesopranos,39anc0,youthanasias,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:48:59 2015 UTC,Nobody knows what really happened. Chase claims Tony is alive yet there are some amazing interpretations of that final scene out there like you mentioned (though I do tend to believe he is dead).

I've re-watched that last 5 minutes so many times today, I'm sure I will never forget this scene.  First watch I didn't get it at all, seeing that dude coming in I was expecting Tony getting hit in a traditional way... Now the second watch definitely shocked me, it is a brilliant scene.

thesopranos,39anc0,Zebracak3s,7,Wed Jun 10 22:26:20 2015 UTC,"I don't choose to believe the more literal interpretation of the black being Tony's POV.   I think the black symbolizes Tony's unknown fate, he will either end up dead right then and there in the diner, shot by Members Only guy, or next week, or years later, or end up rotting away like Junior with nobody giving a shit and his own memories fading. Those are the only ways out for a guy like Tony, and the suspense built by Meadow tediously parking her car etc., represents the way Tony lives the rest of his life, wondering when the bullet might come."

Since then I've come to think that it's an absolutely Integral part of the show as a whole. Its tough not to think about the brilliance and the amiguity of Holstens when some of the shows great themes (death, morality, ""who am I? Where am I going?"") are playing out in the series.  I've introduced the Sopranos to a few people and I've noticed that its something that can take a while to fully appreciate, especially Made in America. Some of the folks I've shown the show to share that same frustration I had about the final scene, but usually come around to really appreciating it after a while.  The entire episode has such an odd feeling throughout, almost like everything is suspended in air and you're not sure where it's gonna land. Sils comatose, the future of bobby children is uncertain at best, and we're left wondering if the same fate that befell uncle junior will get Tony as he leaves the state mental facility.  It's such a rewarding re watch as well. I don't really subscribe to the ""Tony's dead vs Tony lives"" conspiracy stuff but on my most recent rewatch I noticed the same Vanilla Fudge song that plays as Tony wakes up is playing right when Phil gets shot in the head! Stuff that like that makes you continue thinking about the show and its intent long after you stop watching, and that's the beauty of the entire series. it's not just Mob drama.  I liked Breaking bad and I enjoyed the ending, but what Daid Chase did with Made in America is genius, and that's why everybody still talks about it and loves it or hates it or uses it as a standard on which to judge all other finales. Life's short. You're not going to find much certainty in this world. Maybe you go about in pity for yourself, maybe a great wind carries you across the sky. Shut the fuck up about it and have some onion rings."
thesopranos,39amic,GlutenFreeYoga69,4,Wed Jun 10 15:54:13 2015 UTC,"Nice. I really like your summary at the end there. That's pretty much the short version of how I feel about the end. Death is always hanging over your head, no matter who you are. We all have some version of a ""Man in Members Only"" jacket watching us from afar.   The moments get shorter, the man gets closer, and all you can do is appreciate what you have and remember the good times."
thesopranos,39amic,abcdthc,2,Wed Jun 10 17:17:13 2015 UTC,"Tony is dead though, what conspiracy?  Chase basicly spelled it out for us. (in the show and in interviews)"
thesopranos,39amic,TonyBelfort,2,Mon Jun 15 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"The fact that people are still debating this/referring to it as a conspiracy/trying to figure it out is absolutely infuriating...TONY IS DEAD, he got his head blown off in front of his family."
thesopranos,39amic,offthewagontheboat,7,Sat Jun 20 22:37:41 2015 UTC,"I was with my friends at my apartment. We had a weekly Sunday night meeting that involved watching HBO and eating wings. Initially, I don't think I could process what had just transpired. It probably took me a year or so to fully grasp and be able to start speculating on what occurred and it took several more years to realize the impact the show was going to have on television. The Sopranos was like our generation's 9/11: it changed everything. Would I do it again? I've probably seen the last episode as many times as I've seen the first episode at this point, so yeah, I would do it again. How 'bout you?"
thesopranos,39amic,UniversalPolymath,3,Wed Jun 10 14:05:42 2015 UTC,Hahaha. Love this. And my experience sounds pretty similar. And now I want wings...
thesopranos,39amic,MadBigMadBoatMan,5,Wed Jun 10 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"Dammit! Beat me by eight minutes.  My dad, being insane (in a way I perfectly understand), insisted upon watching every episode alone. Every single week, between eight and nine in my house, no one was allowed anywhere near the living room. He silenced the phones, turned off all the lights anywhere near said living room, and everyone else in the house knew to stay the fuck away. I like watching things communally, but for my dad it was a really personal thing that he wanted to experience by himself. So out of this necessity, I didn't get to watch the episode until an hour later than most people. The internet was already blowing up by the time I was getting into it.   My thoughts on the episode have evolved greatly over time, which I think speaks to how special an hour it is. Plenty of episodes of other shows, particularly series finales, just end up sitting there for me. I form an opinion of them in the first few minutes after the credits roll and that's more or less where it stays. Made in America made me think (and think and think) and reflect, and challenged my entire perception of exactly what I look for in a ""satisfying"" conclusion to a story. That's great fucking television."
thesopranos,39amic,dlcjr1775,3,Wed Jun 10 14:24:34 2015 UTC,"Haha, it's not a competition, but...I WIN.  I kid, I kid. My thoughts on the ending have really evolved over time, too. I've posted this before but I remember really and truly thinking that ""Members Only"" guy was going to walk up to Tony and ask, ""Don't I know you from TV?"" I thought that maybe Chase would make a comment on the ""celebrity"" of guys like Tony and the audience's affection/obsession with him. I still like this idea sometimes and kind of wish it happened.  But yeah, my ideas change a lot. For a while, I really liked thinking of that final scene almost as a painting: ""Members Only"" leering on one side, Carlo and the FBI on the other, and Tony in the middle having a peaceful dinner with his family.   There's also an interesting comment on escapism in there (...maybe? See? It's so hard!). This was of course after 9/11 and at the height of the Iraq war and ""terror levels"" and all that paranoia. All that horrible stuff AJ is obsessed with really is out there in the world. But what do we do? We eat. We join communities (the boy scouts). We look for love (the young couple cuddling in their booth). We eat comfort food (onion rings). And we spend time with our family.  Made in America, indeed."

thesopranos,39amic,UniversalPolymath,2,Wed Jun 10 17:29:38 2015 UTC,I saw it a year ago. I watched it alone. I thought my laptop screen stopped working or my graphics card fucked up. At first I hated it. Then I started to warm up to it over the next couple of days due to the ambiguity. I thought he lived and was just paranoid. I looked up numerous articles and was convinced he died. Then I switched back after a couple months to thinking he lived. I still believe that. I've watched the episode 3-4 times and I love it. There are scenes that are parallel to the first season. The ambiguity of all the characters is great. Our window to this world was gone. I'm completely satisfied with the ending. I would do it again. It's a great episode on its own. The episode is so much fun that it flies by. Once holstens is about to come up then I get upset that there isn't more of it and savor every moment.

Perhaps ""safing out"" aren't the words I'd have used today :)"
thesopranos,39ark7,avoritz,11,Wed Jun 10 14:05:30 2015 UTC,"I thought Rosalie's breakdown as they lowered Jackie Jr's coffin into he ground was just absolutely heart wrenching. I've seen that kind of anguished grief before and it was pretty horrifying to see it depicted like that, because it made me remember the funeral where I saw the same thing, even if I thought Jackie Jr was a little shit whose death left the world a better place.   In addition to wakes, they spend so much time in the hospital! It was only the second time I watched ""Whoever Did This,"" as they all sit in the waiting room and hold Ralphie back from attacking the child (!!!!) who shot his son with an arrow that I realized just how much their lives are colored by frequent traumatic tragedies. Like, going to the hospital for horribly injured friends and families is just not normal for most people in America, but it is for them. Chilling."
thesopranos,39ark7,gm6464,3,Wed Jun 10 14:32:23 2015 UTC,The hospital is a great observation to! Very chilling.
thesopranos,39ark7,UniversalPolymath,8,Wed Jun 10 15:09:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't describe it exactly like going to a ""friend's"" wake, but more so than any other in the series, Kennedy and Heidi stirred up a whole lot of feelings in me about real-life deaths I've encountered (and unfortunately, I've had more than my share of those instances to draw from).  Kennedy & Heidi is my go-to answer to the ""favorite episode"" question, and it's because it just perfectly captured the shock and disorienting feeling of a sudden death better than any other show I've ever seen. Like Tony once said of the painting of a ""rotted-out"" tree in Melfi's office, ""it's got [that feeling] built right into it"".   A lesser show would've treated the death of such a major character with over-sentimentality and cloying dramatics. It would've had ""Very Special Episode"" written all over it. It would've been sad. But Kennedy & Heidi just left me numb, which is exactly what it's always felt like in real-life (and I speak only for myself in that regard, understanding that my connection to this episode, and the way I choose to interpret it, needn't be universal). It's not a feeling of sorrow or of fuzzy feelings about the past, at least not at first; rather, it's the absence of all feeling - the complete and utter exhaustion as you and your family go through all the familiar rituals of laying a loved one to rest.  You sit around as a family, not sure what to do with yourselves. You exchange empty platitudes full of false silver linings (Chris' mother: ""Isn't God wonderful that way?""). You stand around at the wake having superficial, half-empty interactions with people that don't quite feel real in any meaningful way. Invariably, someone will complement the ""beautiful"" job the funeral home did on the deceased. You exchange awkward hugs with your friends. You feel discomfort to be in the presence of anyone who dares to show any real, unadulterated outbursts of emotion; you might even be irrationally annoyed that they'd allow themselves to disrupt the delicate sense of repressed decorum everyone else is trying so hard to maintain.  And throughout all this, life keeps going in the way it's always business-as-usual, except something in the days following a major death just feels a little off. Can't quite put your finger on it.  Every one of these feels terribly familiar and completely true to life, and it's all there in Kennedy & Heidi. It's just the most beautifully well-observed meditation on a family experiencing death I've ever encountered."
thesopranos,39ark7,gm6464,3,Wed Jun 10 14:59:10 2015 UTC,"I think in a similar fashion the numb repetition of ""at least she didn't suffer"" (concluding with the outright hilarious statement from Ginny Sacrimoni, ""I heard she didn't suffer, for that we can all be grateful"" during Janice's painful eulogizing) and ""it's a tragedy, what are you gonna do?"" felt very real to me. We have the ""questionable gift of knowing we're going to die,"" but human beings are just not good at dealing with death. It's too painful to plumb our souls for genuine insight, so we parrot these platitudes even for people who were full of warmth and kindness."
thesopranos,39ark7,itisisntit123,2,Wed Jun 10 15:07:09 2015 UTC,"I think every wake/funeral besides Jackie Sr's was met by most of the wise guys with complete apathy.

What drew me into the show (and what made it unique) was the psychology aspect. Those therapy scenes separate The Sopranos from the rest of the mob genre and they are what make it so profound. While I have no doubt Chase could find and write a great story about this era, it simply wouldn't be the show we know and love. I'm much more excited for him to finish this Ribbon of Dreams thing for HBO.   Plus, let's face it. Gandolfini is the reason we all watched. Something would feel off about the whole thing."

I'm not sure international audiences would get all these jokes, although some of the british actors that was on the show said it was no problem to get the jokes.

thesopranos,39537w,45flight2,19,Tue Jun 9 14:32:26 2015 UTC,"I think that stilted quality was very intentional, though -- it's the pretentious, pseudo-profound speak of so many ""well-cultured"" professionals. Chase both respects and satirizes these kinds of people. Mostly the latter, perhaps. Though I don't think Melfi is treated by the show as anything other than a decent person, flawed like us all but not nearly as flawed as most of the cast. Maybe if we only saw her artificial, intellectual facade it would grate, but I love that we get those scenes where Melfi tears into Richard or gets too-drunk at a restaurant and harasses a smoker, etc.  All in all, I think Bracco did a great job in making what could have been a didactic mouthpiece-character into a three-dimensional human being. That's what makes the rape scene so especially horrific, because we've come to care for her as a person. I also think her odd speech patterns that you speak of ring extremely true for how many therapists really do speak."

The role of Melfi was massively important to the greatness of the show.  Her character and role is the vehicle that lets us walk through Tony's internal thoughts/motivations.  If Bracco, or whoever got that role, was bad I don't think the show would've been as great and revolutionary.  I do know what you're talking about, but I thought she was great."
thesopranos,39537w,gypsybear,4,Tue Jun 9 18:31:10 2015 UTC,"You know by the movie Goodfellas that Lorraine Bracco is a hell of an actress. Melfi is never intentionally muted in a way. She still has unique emotions, like in S1 she laughs at Tony's jokes, in S3 she has to go through an awful rape and subsequent trauma. She's just playing a lot more subtle than most of the other actors."
thesopranos,39537w,SteveBuscemisCunt,2,Tue Jun 9 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"To me, she sounded like a blue collar worker trying unconvincny to sound educsted.  Its interesting to note that she was originally approached to play Carmella, because of her role in Goodfellas and her ethnic-american speech patterns.  Luckily she turned this role down, but I am simply left unconvinced by her acting as Melfi.  But I seem to be in the minority, but I too, like some of you, skip through the therspy scenes but I do at times switch backbon when she plays the person, as opposed to the thrapist."
thesopranos,39537w,thisishardcore_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:04:55 2015 UTC,I always thought there was something weird about the way she spoke.
thesopranos,39537w,YoungJolie,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:46:15 2015 UTC,"I think she is restrained and measured, he's her most challenging patient. She's uncertain and at times seems wooden because she has her guard up. He is new territory for her. She speaks the way you would if you were selecting your words verrrry carefully. The scenes where she's scared of him are believable. She remains the utmost professional. I loved her character and how she played it, personally.  I reckon her accent has to do with her Italian working class background and eduction, so that's why she sounds that way (I'm not American, but this is my reading of her accent)."
thesopranos,39537w,itisisntit123,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:33:17 2015 UTC,"I think Melfi was played amazingly.  The weakness with that character lay with her irrelevance as the show progressed.  The panic attacks become much less of an importance to the plot once Tony wasn't endanger of being clipped for seeing a psychiatrist, and they essentially subsidied toward the end of the show.  Does Tony have another one after meeting Noah?  Considering Tony's reluctance to actually work on his issues, after the whole ""you are depressed and identityless because your parents sucked"" theme was beaten to a pulp, there really wasn't much left for the Melfi character, and after the rape, they really stopped diving into her at all which soldified her irrelevance as a character.  That's not to say I didn't enjoy some of the later scenes between her and Tony, but the whole ""omg Tony is a sociopath I need to stop enabling him"" thing in the last episode was insanely contrived.  Any psychiatrist should know that someone with panic attacks simply can't be a sociopath because sociopaths have extremely high thresholds for anxiety, and even so, she already stated she could very well be enabling him like 2 seasons into the show and took him back only because she felt a thrill treating him.  I think that was simply just Chase's lack of understand of what a sociopath truly is defined as, as he referes to Tony's ""sociopathy"" a few times in interviews."
thesopranos,39537w,somerton,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:03:11 2015 UTC,"He had a panic attack during therapy in Season 5, Unidentified Black Males, which was a pretty important scene. I agree that, say, post-S4 the therapy scenes weren't quite as interesting as they were earlier (with some exceptions for sure), but I still think they're totally essential. Without them we don't get such a full picture of Tony's psychology."
thesopranos,39537w,jersey_wiseguy,-1,Sat Jun 13 04:57:13 2015 UTC,Now when i watch the show i skip the dr melfi parts. I just find them kinda boring. But she's a terrific actress.

thesopranos,39537w,YoungJolie,2,Tue Jun 9 21:33:31 2015 UTC,I honestly don't understand why you'd even watch the show if you're not into the therapy stuff.
thesopranos,38yjj3,Low_Fives,13,Sun Jun 7 22:53:59 2015 UTC,"Right on! I think you'll find a lot of people here who felt the same watching it their first time. That's why we're still here discussing it eight years after the fact.  I started the series on the night if the fifth season premiere. I was fifteen at the time. My dad had already been a crazy obsessive fan, and after having to listen to his excitement about the new season starting for weeks, I decided it was finally time to give it a try.   And that's all I did for the next month. Instantly hooked, was all caught up by the time the fourth episode of season five aired live.   I've rewatched the series more times than I can count since then. I will never get tired of spending time with those characters - and you're right, they're so well-defined and developed, they really do feel like real people that are just part of your life. That may or may not sound psychotic, but goddammit if it's not the truth. I've never felt so invested in and connected to a piece of film either.  You might also find it to be infinitely watchable with time. And there will be lots you pick up next time that you hadn't before. My appreciation for how well-crafted a series it is has only grown with time."

Your love and knowledge of the show definitely shows through, though, which just made it a really entertaining listen.  I wish I had friends to sit around and have a version of this podcast with. I was lucky enough to nab a girlfriend who also thinks The Sopranos is the best thing ever, and I've talked her into watching it through with me a few times, but even she gets tired of how endlessly I could go on about it. You definitely nailed the ""feeling that the listener could jump in at any time"" thing, cause I already find myself wishing I could do that.  You guys were also funny as fuck. And I think once you settle in, the discussion will get a bit tighter, and I'm definitely looking forward to you delving into the later episodes.

Idk what episode this is from but I wonder if this is supposed to foreshadow Furio's departure from the group. The way he's standing apart from them, then explains differences in Italy, whereas Paulie might assume think that all Italians are friendly with each other. It seems like Furio sees the world differently than they do."

Those episodes are some of my favorites and I look forward to watching them on on my watch-throughs.
thesopranos,38l5jn,dxgxnxratx315,2,Fri Jun 5 03:30:59 2015 UTC,"Likewise. I find them packed with meaning and imagery. You can tell Chase was somewhat inspired by Jungian psychology and even various spiritual traditions with his use of dreams and quotes like these: ""Sometimes I go about in pity for myself, and all the while, a great wind carries me across the sky..."""

thesopranos,38k1pn,UniversalPolymath,3,Thu Jun 4 21:01:49 2015 UTC,"Love Todd's work, but for me it goes Sepinwall, Matt Zoller Seitz, and then Todd. A few other good ones out there too that I'm forgetting at the moment.   You know what's cool? Not only did The Sopranos change television itself, it also changed television critique. How incredible is that?"
thesopranos,38k1pn,nofuckinpodcast,4,Thu Jun 4 22:11:56 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I have a soft spot for Todd. I also noticed more than a few comments during his rewatch from a few people who identified themselves as loyal readers despite never having really watched the show. How anyone could do that, I have no fucking idea, but it does speak to how personal and independently thought-provoking his writing could be.  Good call on Matt Zoller Seitz as well, though - and he's someone Todd clearly respects (and has referenced) in his writing as well.  Also spot on about the evolving nature of television critique. By now, jumping online for in-depth analysis is the standard companion for all of the ""prestige"" series (and more than a few others as well), but back when The Sopranos was just stretching its legs, no one had any idea a ""mere"" TV show could give us so much to talk about.  Edit: On a completely different note, just noticed your username and really looking forward to the podcast! I hope it takes off."
thesopranos,38k1pn,UniversalPolymath,3,Thu Jun 4 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"Todd really does some excellent work. I guess because I read Seitz first I'm partial to him, but all three have different strengths.   The only other show I can think of that had a big weekly discussion was The X-Files. Those early 90's message boards were practically made for that show. After that and The Sopranos, I'd say it was Lost that really brought it all home.   Kind of unrelated but do you read John Teti on AV Club? If you're a Six Feet Under fan, his write-ups are terrific.   Thanks for the support on the podcast! We hope so too. iTunes rejected us based on the title, which was kind of expected but we hoped to sneak by. We're working on a way to get it out to everyone this weekend and work things out so it's up on iTunes and everywhere else next week!"
thesopranos,38k1pn,nofuckinpodcast,7,Fri Jun 5 00:38:46 2015 UTC,God I remember running to my computer Monday mornings to read his blog when the show was airing. Pre-Hitfix even. So awesome to see him bringing this back. This show needs to be back in the pop culture forefront.

thesopranos,38hxi0,Oojamaflipmadoodah,10,Thu Jun 4 09:37:28 2015 UTC,"Oh man..years ago there was a period where I rewatched the whole series back to back for months with no breaks in between. It was prob the best time I ever watched it too. I would go to school, work, come home take a nap wake up to my father putting down a full plate of food of some of my favorite dishes and while I ate I would watch the Sopranos. This lasted a year...maybe two? Thats def the best memory I have watching the whole series...also not to mention this is when I had surround sound. ;)....Now I no longer have it :/ but thats okay, I live in a apartment complex so I wouldn't be able to use the sound anyway.  I've watched it so much that I knew every dialogue in every scene every season...Its been almost a year since I watched the sopranos and I'm trying my absolute best to not think about the sopranos cause I wanna give myself a long break so when I rewatch  it again I want it to be fresh again...Also small side note I'm kinda waiting to find a special girl to introduce to the Sopranos and make special dinners every time we watch it, have a big screen tv with surround sound. If she's already watched the series than thats fine. For me it seems like it would be more special to introduce someone to the show cause you also get to watch the show thru them who's seeing it for the first time and I love seeing peoples reactions on first viewings.  So thats my goal right now...wait to find a beautiful girlfriend an have a nice set up an make it a big event...So it could be a few years till I watch the sopranos again...or maybe not? Who knows."
thesopranos,38hxi0,avoritz,11,Thu Jun 4 09:56:46 2015 UTC,"I went through this period too, where I was watching it back-to-back for awhile. Some of those rewatches were with friends (and yeah, one was a ""special girl"") who hadn't seen it, which is a fantastic treat. I'll never get to experience the series anywhere near ""fresh"" ever again (about as far from it as possible, actually, just for how well I know every scene), but it is fun to vicariously experience it anew through others.  Then I moved to El Paso, Texas with a friend and introduced the show to her non-English speaking grandfather. He got super into it and we binged the hell out of the whole series, this time in Spanish. I understand just enough Spanish (which is not much at all) to still know when they butchered or terribly oversimplified some of the translations, and was able to tell them what the line was really supposed to be. Her grandfather got super into it, and with my girlfriend translating, we had amazingly in-depth conversations about Tony's upbringing and psychology (which was his favorite aspect of the show). Really helped me bond with someone I didn't have much else in common with. Great memories.  Now, I just throw random episodes on as background noise, most nights of the week. Haven't done an intentional episode-by-episode watch in awhile, but it's nice to just drop in wherever."

This country is still hilariously and pathetically racist and insecure. They blatantly show me that they feel QUICKLY threatened and jealous if I so much as wear a Sopranos t-shirt or an Italian pride t-shirt.

It manages to be sweet and dark and funny and unconventional all at once. The final scene in ""So Did The Fat Lady"" (Season 4) went viral because it dealt with female obesity with such honesty and humor.  But what really blew me away about that scene is that it runs from the commercial break to the end-credits WITHOUT A SINGLE CUT.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFdWcNJ17YY  The staging, the camerawork, the ability of the actors to stay in the moment here are all brilliant.  You'll rarely find 8-minute long, uninterrupted shots as good as this even in movies nowadays, so its absolutely jaw-dropping to find this on a basic cable TV show."

thesopranos,38cxie,nofknziti,2,Wed Jun 3 15:43:39 2015 UTC,I take it louie didn't have much creative freedom at the time...How did he get the freedom for Louie? From just his stand up acts becoming popular?

Season 5 has been amazing so far, every episode better than the last."

They both immerse their shows in surreal, build and buck continuity on whims, and describe people as not fundamentally bad but capable and willing of horror. Louis seems to believe that selfishness is not the end, whereas Chase condemns even the hero of his show (Melfi). Maybe my new favorite show, I will wait until Louie is done.

Before he flips there are a lot of people with way more interest to flip. Starting first with Bobby. The freindly quiet mob guy with 2 children. Totally dominated by Tonys sister who has proven before her inloyalty to her brother. If he would do the time Jeannice will not accept that and make him flip.  Next on the List: Silvio. When he got in full controll of the Jersey mob he started showing nerfs. Really hard. I dont think he will keep his mouth shut over all that pressure. Also kids and wife.  While Paulie is a psycopath we wouldnt rat on Tony to the law. Rat on Tony to New York is another thing tho. Hes the oldschool soldier mafiosi u can think of. He has proven to have no moral but defenetly loyalty especially when it comes to Tony. Without a doubt he would die for his boss.  Furio is back in Italy so he has that thing going for him.  All those others beeing dead makes it to hard for my simple mind. Id prbly go with Ralphy over Toni B over Richie. With Richie (as an og, just remmeber one of his first apearings when he talked to Chris) beeing the last one to flip of them."

But then again so much of that was about Tony and Carmella's relationship, so a lot of it maybe would have stayed the same.   One thing that for sure would not have made it is the FBI anti-terrorism angle, and that would have knocked down a whole bunch of story dominoes down the line. The Feds might have spent more time searching for Ade. Chris would never meet the two middle eastern gun guys. Tony wouldn't have an ""in"" with Agent Harris. If the Phil stuff all stays the same Tony never finds him, and on and on."

thesopranos,385fn0,I_AM_A_GUY_AMA,9,Tue Jun 2 03:35:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's probably the most glaringly ""bad"" thing about the entire series, not just because of how fake and dumb the CGI looks but also how obvious it is that we're merely watching a bunch of Livia dialogue from past episodes stitched together, thus not making all that much sense in the context of her conversation with Tony (though I guess that fits her character, you could say, as she was always repeating herself).  Also, the way they have another woman as a live ""stand-in"" and then paste Livia's face onto her looks really weird and almost uncanny and creepy, just the disparity between the face and the big hands waving the hanky and the body, it's like a digital Frankenstein or something. Very jarring scene, but it still can't take away from the greatness of the rest of the episode.  Personally I understand the the cast and crew's desire for one last Livia scene after Marchand's death, but I think it would have been much more powerful and haunting for Tony, after not talking to her for a while, to just get that sudden phone call out of the blue, and maybe even regret not visiting her more recently."
thesopranos,385fn0,somerton,6,Tue Jun 2 04:19:59 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, are you serious? I hadn't known they did another scene after her death. I knew she passed and the show hadn't really planned for it, but I always figured it was just like you say in your last paragraph, they inform about the death of the character via phone call after the death of the actress made more scene impossible. Now I'll have to do another full rewatch so I can look out for that CGI scene. I can't remember anything standing out to me as particularly weird/fake."
thesopranos,385fn0,matrixagent,5,Tue Jun 2 07:53:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think if you don't know about it beforehand you might just accept it as Livia. I know a few people who didn't notice it on first watch. I was well aware of the circumstances and the infamy of the scene before I saw it, though, so I couldn't help but cringe at how awkward it looked."
thesopranos,385fn0,somerton,3,Tue Jun 2 09:19:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't know about her passing when I first saw the infamous scene (which had a $250,000 price tag that was brought down to $125,000 if I remember correctly) and didn't notice anything out of the ordinary either. Since Tony's mother's death seemed out of the blue I checked Wikipedia to see if Nancy Marchand had died. I watched that scene again and this time it looked horrible. The visual effects are okayish for the time, but her answers are so nonsensical that the conversation between her and Tony is almost grotesque. It made me realize how little I must be concentrated when I do a TV marathon (I watched the 5 first seasons in 25 days)."

Then two episodes later, when Tony wakes up in his hotel after the nightmare of the woman on the stairs, he looks at the clock and it says 9:07.

thesopranos,382ur2,somerton,15,Mon Jun 1 13:29:51 2015 UTC,"Great post, and this speaks to me perfectly.   The tonal shift between season three and four wasn't just apparent in retrospectively; it was immediately apparent that with its fourth year, The Sopranos was about to become a very different show. Interestingly, David Chase cites the events of 9/11 as a large contributor to this shift. From the opening lines of ""World Destruction"" to set the season off, that source of influence is made clear.  I loved it as well. By season four, just hanging out with Tony and the crew was a treat I savored every week. The characters were so well-defined and endlessly captivating me, they could've been doing anything (or nothing, as it were), and I would've gladly been right there with them.  Lots of people constantly chase the instant gratification of the mafia violence and hijinks without paying respect to the fact that those big, explosive moments only land so hard coupled with a genuine investment in the characters as ""real people"" that comes with the more quiet periods in between. And while many fans viewed season five as a vast improvement over four and a ""return to form"" of sorts - and indeed, there was a bit more action throughout - I don't think it would've been half as successful without the necessary deepening of our understanding of this cast of characters that was afforded to us by the slow-burn of that middle-season.  The only explanation for my continued obsession with this show - the fact that I'm sitting on this subreddit eight years after the fact still completely fascinated by it - comes down to the beautiful, haunting and leisurely-paced character study the show morphed into in its latter half. This show has stuck with me because I know these characters better than any other cast of fictional personalities I've ever spent time with. The show only got better and better, and took on a deeper and deeper meaning for me personally, and that all started with the incredible fourth season."
thesopranos,382ur2,UniversalPolymath,7,Mon Jun 1 15:31:59 2015 UTC,"Well said. I forgot to mention it at all, but indeed 9/11 may be the single biggest factor in the change in tone and pacing from S4 onward. Because even the more fast-paced, action-packed S5 carries a  certain darkness to it that just wasn't present in the first three seasons. (I also have to say that, as much as I love S5, at times it feels a little bit too focused on mob machinations over character study; but this is a very minor gripe)."
thesopranos,382ur2,nofuckinpodcast,8,Mon Jun 1 22:24:02 2015 UTC,"Yup. I always joke that the first couple seasons are just a bunch of shenanigans before things get real in season four. Every frame is darker, slower, moodier. The dreams are haunting (the end of ""Calling All Cars"" creeps me out and inspires me to this day).   Seasons 1-3 really encapsulate the feeling of the 90's. Season 4 and on, the party is over. We reaped what we sowed. Tony and his gang went from being an almost satirical look at the rich fat cats of the 90's to the almost evil corporate and political entities to emerge post 9/11. The show's commentary on the US is much more biting than ever.  That being said, it's still funnier than half the shitty sitcoms out there."
thesopranos,382ur2,nofuckinpodcast,7,Mon Jun 1 23:02:35 2015 UTC,"Totally agreed. There's not just a lightness of tone and increased wackiness of humor but also a kind of energetic feel to the first 3 seasons which basically turns deflated and resigned and apocalyptic come S4. The guy who did those great AV Club write-ups for the Sopranos (Todd, I forget how to spell his last name) once rightly wrote that the series neatly divides into two parts, 1-3 and 4-6. What's interesting, too, is how the S3 finale, Army of One, almost seems to anticipate this change. I just get this sense from that episode, partly because of the dark atmosphere around Jackie Jr's death, that ""the best is over,"" or the decline is already starting; the way the ending cuts from Junior singing sentimental schmaltz at Vesuvio to the end credits with their harrowingly bleak Aphex Twin drone is very foreboding and powerful.  And in terms of how big an impact 9/11 had on the show, even in 2007 with Made in America Chase was still referencing it and the war on terror constantly (e.g. the snowfall and frighteningly low-flying planes in the scene at the airport seem to visually suggest the WTC attacks)."
thesopranos,382ur2,nofuckinpodcast,3,Tue Jun 2 00:59:27 2015 UTC,"All great points. I wonder now just thinking about it if the show was priming to get a lot darker anyway, almost following the classic ""rise and fall"" structure.   But you're right. 9/11 does really inform the ending. And from what I remember Chase didn't think up that ending until the long break between four and five.  ETA: Ya know, in a lot of ways I wonder of 9/11 confirmed a lot of what Chase already felt about the world."
thesopranos,382ur2,SopranosAutopsy,2,Tue Jun 2 01:05:27 2015 UTC,"I suspect that it was going to get darker, yeah, but 9/11 just put it into overdrive.  I thought that Chase thought of the ending between 5 and 6A? Maybe I'm remembering wrong though. Not to get into that discussion, but all the real clues or foreshadowing w/r/t Tony's possible death seems to be in the sixth season, starting of course with Members Only. Whenever I read people try to analyze ""clues"" about Holsten's from before S6, or especially like from the first few seasons, I just laugh. I don't think the writers really knew where it was all going to end up in S2 or 3 or even 4, though by 5 they probably had a sharper picture."
thesopranos,382ur2,SopranosAutopsy,3,Tue Jun 2 01:11:36 2015 UTC,"Ha! I'm the same way. I'm not about to tell anyone how to interpret the show, but if you're looking at something someone wore in season two as ""evidence"" (ugh, hate having to even use that word), I can't help but roll my eyes. I don't think Chase and co. thought much beyond the season they were working on until later in the series when HBO suggest they end it."

thesopranos,382ur2,SopranosAutopsy,3,Mon Jun 1 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Some of my thoughts here were actually partly inspired by a recent reading of your Mergers and Acqusitions write-up, namely the emphasis on Tony's boredom and the comparison to House Arrest.  And I've just read your analysis of Whoever Did This and, wow, lots of great insights. Not to go off-topic, but one thing I realized for the first time while reading it is that the first two onscreen deaths in S4 -- Det. Haydu and Ralph -- are both committed out of a desire for revenge which may be misplaced, as both victims die pleading their innocence and it remains ambiguous as to whether Haydu killed Dickie or Ralph killed Pie. (Note: is the only other onscreen death in S4 that of the two black hitmen in Whitecaps? This feeds into my point about S4 feeling more likelife, as it's been oft-commented that [paraphrasing here] there are more mob killings on The Sopranos than there have been in several decades in real life)."
thesopranos,382ur2,nofuckinpodcast,3,Mon Jun 1 22:15:26 2015 UTC,"There was also the suffocation of senior citizen/malignant cunt Minn Matrone by Paulie.

thesopranos,382ur2,Foothill_r34,2,Mon Jun 1 22:59:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, good call. I think that's everyone, though, which is kind of crazy -- to think that there are only five onscreen deaths in the entire season! No wonder it was so disliked by the ""whack-happy"" crowd.  I forgot to add, about Whoever Did This, that I've always wondered about the reality of the scene where Junior asks the neighbor for ice cream. It seems so odd, coming after 20+ minutes focusing on just Tony and Chris. IIRC, the scene is bookended by shots of Tony asleep and then waking up at the Bing, and I think that this placement deliberately suggests it may even be a dream..."

thesopranos,37zy3f,acorsicanpimp,7,Sun May 31 20:43:34 2015 UTC,"I'm on the side of theory one. I think if David Chase wanted us to all believe Tony was killed or not, there would be a little bit less ambiguity. The key is that we experience the paranoia Tony will always feel (edit: paranoia is a bad word to use here - I would say caution is better - Tony must always be careful) and in the end try to hold onto the good moments as best we can, where we can just sit, enjoy our family and some food, and not stop believing (edit: this is key more than the above section imo). It's not that there isn't resolution, it's that the resolution doesn't resolve around Tony's death and instead revolves around the emotions he's feeling about the life he leads and normalizing that against a normal suburb family life. In that respect, I regard it as one of TV's greatest finales."
thesopranos,37zy3f,paradoxasauruser,5,Sun May 31 23:20:12 2015 UTC,"I think what Chase is trying to convey is something deeper than the paranoia Tony will always feel. It's that life is short and precious in general for each and everyone of us, and what is most important in our lives and often taken for granted are the little moments of warmth and the connections we make with one another. To me its clear what he meant to create in the last scene was the feeling of the possibility of death coming at any time. A lot of clues point to a moment, not that moment, when death may come; the idea that it's always imminent as a possibility. Since it's the end of the show, that feeling of the possibility looming is created then and there. When Chase says ""it's all there"" he's referring to  all the different possible ways tony might die, (the black guys, since hits were often outsourced to unlikely culprits to allow for plausible deniability, the guy in the members only jacket etc;) It is really a 'Schroedinger's Tony Soprano' situation, with all the different scenarios in a ""superposition,"" and Chase says as much in ""Supper with the Sopranos.""  Schroedinger's cat is explicitly discussed in ""Fleshy Part of the Thigh"" as well...just the idea of death and life always co-existing, and bound up with one another.   All this had been said repeatedly and I'm sure I won't change anyone's mind here, but I have to reiterate: It really doesn't fucking matter if Tony Soprano dies in that diner or some other time; hell die at some point. We all will.  ETA: I really don't think Tony is in a paranoid state in that scene. He's actually, if not blissfully, numbly unaware of any danger and just looking forward to some onion rings. But it's easy for us as viewers to project that onto him, since the feeling of the possibility of his death is created for our sake."
thesopranos,37zy3f,nofknziti,2,Mon Jun 1 00:53:53 2015 UTC,I agree. You said it better than I did.
thesopranos,37zy3f,paradoxasauruser,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:58:16 2015 UTC,David Chase analyzed the final scenes on the DGA site and said that Tony was paranoid and noticed Members Only guy.
thesopranos,37zy3f,jersey_wiseguy,0,Mon Jun 1 20:56:23 2015 UTC,"Anybody who thinks the scene is constructed to show Tony's paranoid state of mind or fear hasn't really seen the scene or is a complete idiot.  Chase's editing of the scene creates tension and anxiety in the viewer because we all expect something big to happen because its the last scene.  So Chase shows other patrons in the diner as well as creates suspense with Meadow's parallel parking and the Members Only Jacket Guy.  As for Tony, he's looking down at his menu in almost every shot.  he looks at the songs of the jukebox and smiles when he sees his family.  It is seriously one of the most mundane Soprano family moments we have ever seen with Tony about as relaxed and happy as we ever see him.  NOTHING in the Tony's face, actions, or words show a ""paranoid"" state of mind.  He's relaxed and never sees MOJ looking at him and only notices him when he walks by."
thesopranos,37zy3f,JohnBoy347,2,Mon Jun 1 00:47:50 2015 UTC,"perhaps paranoia isn't the right word... I would say ""caution,"" maybe? Chase talks about how Tony subliminally sizes up the patrons as the come in, assessing possible threats - that's what I mean, that he always naturally has to watch his back."
thesopranos,37zy3f,paradoxasauruser,-5,Mon Jun 1 00:57:55 2015 UTC,"I think if David Chase wanted us to all believe Tony was killed or not, there would be a little bit less ambiguity.   What? There are hours of footage that you need to address, you can't make a convoluted statement and expect to prove something.    The key is that we experience the paranoia Tony will always feel and in the end try to hold onto the good moments as best we can, where we can just sit, enjoy our family and some food, and not stop believing.    No, the key is to address what I estimate to be about 100 separate points that undeniably prove Tony is dead, and figuring this out is the point of the show that had the deepest symbolism of any show ever.   It's not that there isn't resolution, it's that the resolution doesn't resolve around Tony's death   No and no   and instead revolves around the emotions he's feeling about the life he leads and normalizing that against a normal suburb family life.   That's one theme on the show but he doesn't feel anything after the Members Only jacket hitman shoots him.   In that respect, I regard it as one of TV's greatest finales.   I don't agree with your chosen respect  since it is indefensible, and it is the greatest finale of any show due to how much you can point to to prove it and how much you can point to to prove it."
thesopranos,37zy3f,paradoxasauruser,3,Sun May 31 23:25:15 2015 UTC,"What? There are hours of footage that you need to address, you can't make a convoluted statement and expect to prove something.   I'm not sure I understand what you mean. The hours of footage being the entire show? I simply meant that I don't believe Chase would hide a death in the final scene so intensely that fans literally couldn't agree on whether or not said death occurred. The Sopranos has never been that type of show.   No, the key is to address what I estimate to be about 100 separate points that undeniably prove Tony is dead, and figuring this out is the point of the show that had the deepest symbolism of any show ever.   ... what are these 100 separate points? I don't see them in the article or your comments, so I'm not sure I'm following you.   No and no   Alright.   That's one theme on the show but he doesn't feel anything after the Members Only jacket hitman shoots him.   Or we stop perceiving his feelings because the show ends.   I don't agree with your chosen respect since it is indefensible, and it is the greatest finale of any show due to how much you can point to to prove it and how much you can point to to prove it.   Again, the article you linked literally mentions my interpretation, as do Chase's notes on the scene. I certainly don't believe my interpretation HAS to be the correct one (death of the author and all that) - but it's what I believe and I certainly find it defensible.  I'm not saying Tony died or didn't die - I just don't think Chase meant for us to ""know"" because that wasn't what the show was all about."
thesopranos,37zy3f,paradoxasauruser,-4,Mon Jun 1 00:46:19 2015 UTC,As usual you want to ignore what I say and what Chase says and refer to something else out of context. You have absolutely no ability to refute this: http://masterofsopranos.wordpress.com/the-sopranos-definitive-explanation-of-the-end/  Your belief is horseshit compared to mountains of evidence.
thesopranos,37zy3f,JohnBoy347,2,Mon Jun 1 02:02:07 2015 UTC,"Dude, I literally just linked something that David Chase said and it's absolutely not out of context. Thanks for that link, but it's the first instance of your ""mountains of evidence."" please stop being so combative, it's incredibly off-putting to having what should be a civil, enjoyable conversation."
thesopranos,37zy3f,paradoxasauruser,-4,Mon Jun 1 02:13:34 2015 UTC,"It's neither civil nor enjoyable when you drag your feet, refuse to listen to reason, ignore context, and ignore the contents of the show, then you ignore the link I just provided you that I said you can't refute and that you didn't."
thesopranos,37zy3f,JohnBoy347,-2,Mon Jun 1 02:35:18 2015 UTC,"The most hysterical thing is he cites the Chase dga article where again Chase basically admits that Tony died:  ""I said to Gandolfini, the bell rings and you look up. That last shot of Tony ends on 'don't stop,' it's mid-song. I'm not going to go into [if that's Tony's POV]. I thought the possibility would go through a lot of people's minds or maybe everybody's mind that he was killed.""  So why would Chase carefully construct the scene so that ""EVERBODY"" would think Tony was killed if it wasn't in fact Chase's intention to kill Tony?   Why would Chase esentially ADMIT his intention if we're to conclude that Tony lives?  That would make Chase either a complete idiot or a complete sadist.  Seriously, the denial here by some is frightening,"
thesopranos,37zy3f,paradoxasauruser,-4,Mon Jun 1 02:50:55 2015 UTC,"It's a weird cultural thing where everyone's opinion has merit no matter how dogshit it is, where people have no conviction and can't determine things for themselves, where people continually straddle the fence, and they think that's the enlightened path."
thesopranos,37zy3f,Michaelm2434,4,Mon Jun 1 03:49:35 2015 UTC,"i went against my better judgment and decided to comment one more time even though you two have made what should be an enjoyable discussion full of personal attacks and weird animosity... this is from the penultimate and final paragraph from the link I provided, which you didn't even address.  In Chase's words:   I thought the possibility would go through a lot of people's minds or maybe everybody's mind that he was killed. He might have gotten shot three years ago in that situation. But he didn't. Whether this is the end here, or not, it's going to come at some point for the rest of us. Hopefully we're not going to get shot by some rival gang mob or anything like that. I'm not saying that [happened].   ...   I never considered the black a shot. I just thought what we see is black. The ceiling I was going for at that point, the biggest feeling I was going for, honestly, was don't stop believing. It was very simple and much more on the nose than people think. That's what I wanted people to believe. That life ends and death comes, but don't stop believing. There are attachments we make in life, even though it's all going to come to an end, that are worth so much, and we're so lucky to have been able to experience them. Life is short. Either it ends here for Tony or some other time. But in spite of that, it's really worth it. So don't stop believing.   (emphasis mine.) so there it is. maybe Tony died, maybe Tony didn't die, but Chase literally says that's not the point and people that read too much into it are probably seeing things that he didn't intend to be interpreted that way. i'm all for death of the author, though so, sure, that Tony died is a valid interpretation, but in this case I'm more satisfied and convinced by Chase's statement. at this point, i'm probably gonna abandon the thread, because i'm not a huge fan of being told my ideas are horseshit shockingly so yeah"

thesopranos,37zy3f,UniversalPolymath,-1,Mon Jun 1 14:36:13 2015 UTC,"No, what you're reading only proves my point.  Chase at BEST says Tony checks out MOJ guy on a ""subconscious"" level which he says ""we all do"".  Then you lie and say Chase says Tony is sizing up the other patrons when HE NEVER SAYS anything like that.  Chase says he has MOJ enter with AJ so that ""Tony's focus is on his son instead of the man who may do him harm"".   Now please use your brain a little here; why would Chase do that?  Because he has to set up how MOJ can kill Tony.  Tony never sees him until he walks past him to the bathroom.  Tony is too relaxed and misses the big threat in the room.  That explains how Tony gets killed."

thesopranos,37zy3f,paradoxasauruser,3,Mon Jun 1 13:18:53 2015 UTC,"You are completely misunderstanding the ending and the point of the show itself.   From David Chase's publicist:  ""As David Chase has said numerous times on the record, ‘Whether Tony Soprano is alive or dead is not the point.' To continue to search for this answer is fruitless. The final scene of The Sopranos raises a spiritual question that has no right or wrong answer.""  ""Though you wouldn't know it from watching Hollywood movies, endings are by nature mysterious. There is the instability of loss in an ending as well as the satisfying sense of completion. American television before Chase, with the exception of David Lynch's Twin Peaks, one of Chase's avowed key inspirations for the art of The Sopranos, built a craft that dispenses with the destabilizing aspects of an ending. The true art of closure will not tolerate such a boring decision. Moreover, the art of closure forbids merely telling the audience in words that there is loss, since words can create the illusion of safety and control. Chase's art seeks a silent level of knowing more profound than words. He believes we already know if we open up to that deeper part of us.""  From Steven Van Zandt:  'I'll tell you exactly what happened. The director said cut, the actors went home. That's what happened.' It's a TV show. It's a fucking TV show, okay?"

thesopranos,37zy3f,UniversalPolymath,4,Mon Jun 1 14:36:33 2015 UTC,"I fully agree with Chase when he says that it doesn't matter. There's no answer to be explicitly stated because the overly-simple question everyone's focused on is beside the point.  Tony lives through dinner or Tony gets shot in the back of the head at Holsten's. If it's the former, he'll never change. He'll always be the same person, and he will be destined to die, at one time or another, under the same circumstances as the latter. Life is short, and especially for someone in Tony's position, the specter of death is always right there. Focusing on the exact ""when"" it happens does not matter.  It's quite clear, more so than ever after the recent write-up Chase did for the Directors Guild, that the final scene was designed to be highly suggestive of Tony's death. It's presented as a possibility for the audience to ponder. People who interpret the ending as a first-person portrayal of death are not wrong for interpreting it that way. It's one interpretation of the literal events of the ending among many.  But where Chase parts ways with his fans - who just want to cherry-pick quotes and cover their ears with their hands every time he tries to earnestly explain why it's an ultimately meaningless question - is that no literal reading of the ending actually gets to the point of it. That the final scene speaks to larger themes and philosophical notions.   Recent quote from Chase's publicist:   ""As David Chase has said numerous times on the record, ‘Whether Tony Soprano is alive or dead is not the point.' To continue to search for this answer is fruitless. The final scene of The Sopranos raises a spiritual question that has no right or wrong answer.""   You want to talk about the artist's intentions? Try having one fucking conversation about the ending that isn't reduced entirely to whether or not Tony's brains were splattered all over a bowl of onion rings."

thesopranos,37zy3f,dufflecoat,2,Mon Jun 1 04:56:45 2015 UTC,"Christ, it's like talking to a wall. A very stubborn wall that has trouble with the English language.  As big of a waste of time I already know this is, can you explain how you determined that you have posted ""literally the only Chase comment that matters"", when it's one of his very earliest comments on the ending and he's said far more since then? Can you explain why Chase would bother saying all the other things cited in this thread - none of which contradicts the death interpretation of the ending, by the way, but just speaks to the inherent ambiguity and infinite interpretability of it, as well as Chase's larger beliefs about what it means - if none of those things mattered? Why would Chase say a bunch of stuff that didn't matter?   Thing is, I've read a lot about this. I try to take into account everything Chase has said about his intentions, unpack the more ambiguous statements and try to draw the best conclusions. At the moment, my best conclusion is that David Chase would probably think you're a dumbass."
thesopranos,37zy3f,10122012,-5,Mon Jun 1 13:39:14 2015 UTC,"You haven't read enough, and again, you're unable to do anything but make up horseshit and refer to one David Chase interview out of context, when I say he said it's all there, and I told you to now try to understand what symbolism is, which you have no idea how to do. You can't address anything from the show, you can only circlejerk about one Chase line that disregards everything I've said.

thesopranos,37zy3f,10122012,2,Mon Jun 1 14:31:32 2015 UTC,"The silliest thing about this is you know absolutely nothing about how I personally interpret the literal events of the ending. To make it perfectly clear, I've always subscribed to the theory that Tony was killed at Holsten's, for many of the reasons cited in Master of Sopranos (interestingly, several of those things were confirmed by Chase in the aforementioned DGA article, including the POV pattern with the bell and significance of having AJ and MOG enter simultaneously).  That does not preclude me from saying the ending is ""infinite interpretable"" - that is, it clearly revels in ambiguity and invites various discussion - nor does it preclude me from saying, with agreement to David Chase, that it doesn't fucking matter if Tony was actually shot or not.  Not to mention, the infamous ""It's all there"" quote is also very ambiguous. Far more ambiguous, I'd argue, than the bulk of other comments cited throughout this thread. Why you've latched on to one cryptic quote made shortly after the finale years ago as THE definitive linchpin in your entire argument, while ignoring everything he's said since, is beyond me. We can have a whole conversation about the extent to which David Chase's - or any artist's - comments matter to the ""actual"" meaning of the piece of artwork, but either everything he says matters or none of it does. You can't throw a tantrum at what you perceive as everyone ignoring the creator's own words by doing the same thing elsewhere."

thesopranos,37tpy9,multimania,7,Sat May 30 08:44:52 2015 UTC,"I always thought the show was a criticism of psychology. All of the psychologists/psychiatrists were either enablers or incapable of helping their patients.    Melfi fed Tony bullshit about how he wasn't to blame for his behavior. Melfi's psychiatrist was afraid of Melfi and never stood up to her directly. The only time Melfi is told that she's being an idiot is at the dinner party and she immediately lashes out at her doctor. Meadow's doctor tells Meadow to drop school and go backpacking through Europe (who the fuck would tell a struggling college student to run away from their problems?) Melfi's family psychiatrist seems unable to grasp the real problems of the family. He never challenged Melfi or the Father instead he just placates them and cracks jokes. AJ's doctor is the most competent by far and yet she is still unable to solve AJ's problems or help him in the slightest (he still goes on and tries to kill himself).   All in all I think the show was trying to point out that psychiatry is a lot of guesswork and may or may not help. The first episode Melfi gives Tony medicine and Tony says he's already feeling better and Melfi tells him that its a placebo effect.   Edit: didn't read the submission text, but I'm not gonna change this cause it took forever to type on my phone."

I thought it wasn't a bad idea for her to sod off to Europe for a couple of weeks. It would have done her a lot of good to properly lead the life of a struggling college student, not that of a college student whose parents can throw $50,000 donations around, and intimidate influential people into writing recommendation letters. Like Tony said, something about not being able to work in France without a permit... an issue like that would simply have never been a problem for Meadow in the States, who had been accustomed to getting whatever she wanted, either with or without her knowledge. Her parents stepped in for her to smooth out the road ahead whenever the situation called for it. So spending time in Europe alone and away from that vast support network would have done her a lot of good. It would have knocked some gratitude and humility into her, for starters.  50 grand! It still rankles me. You know what I could do with that money? Wipe out all my current student debt. Instead it gets spunked on a fucking plaque hung on the wall of a student centre. Meadow came from a life of extreme privilege. Spending time away from that privilege, as an everyday, white sock wearing prole just like me (and presumably, you), would have done her a world of good."
thesopranos,37tpy9,my_first_rodeo,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think the problem with Meadow was she was spoiled. She was still a hard worker in school and a decent older sibling to AJ. Obviously I'm not a medical professional, but I always figured Meadow's problems with slacking off going into her sophomore year were caused by a number of issues that she was unprepared for.   Her crappy roommate Her first halfrican boyfriend who used her and then dumped her when she was more of a nuisance than she was worth. Her second boyfriend (Jacky Jr.) Who used her, cheated on her, and then was shot under suspicious circumstances. Her finally figuring out that her Dad was a mob boss.   Meadow went through a lot for a freshman in college. She finally figured out though that doing nothing wasn't solving her problems. She got back on the horse and pursued something she was passionate about. Of all the characters Meadow seemed like the one that figured out a way of handling her problems."

I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist, and I work in a hospital, so I know about it from both sides. In South Africa, psychiatrists conduct formal assessments, make diagnoses and write prescriptions. Patients typically have an appointment with their psychiatrist once every 3 months for about 30 minutes (or when a prescription needs to be filled). I realise I used the wrong word based on Melfi's formal job title, but in South Africa I'd call her a clinical psychologist."
thesopranos,37tpy9,Foothill_r34,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:10:10 2015 UTC,"Psychology Nerd.  I love the psychology in the non psychology scenes about daily life.  I also love the psychology of the Dr. Melfi scenes.  Yet I think Dr. Melfi does a horrible job with the actual psychology treatment with her current patient.  Personally I think what Dr. Melfi does is a great psychologist for most people, but what she did was close but not actually malpractice with Tony Soprano.  I am not referring to her dropping Tony in Season 6.        I am instead refering to her realizing and explaining to Tony Soprano what alexthymia is wikipedia.  Alexithymia is the inability to process and resolve feelings, this person is not a sociopath, but when there feelings are over aroused they can not use their rational mind to deconstruct these feelings to further their instincts in a reflective way.  Thus when the feelings are extremely intense they turn to impulsive and compulsive behaviors.  She introduces the term in Season 2 Episode 11 House Arrest where Dr. Melfi and Soprano talk about the pursuit of happiness and she compares Tony to his face to a shark, for he needs to be busy and keep his mind off feelings for he can't process feelings.           So what does Dr. Melfi do for therapy, she purposefully tries to get him emotionally aroused hoping he will come to a breakthrough with therapy.  She does this for 5 years.  Later in season 3 she talks with her ex-husband and her husband who is also a psych tells her according to Melfi herself, Soprano is alexithymia so why are you treating him with Talk Therapy which has little treatment potential for such people for all it does is overaroused them again and since they do not have effective coping mechanisms they turn to impulsive behaviors such as drug abuse (sopranos takes his prozac impulsively), overeating, anxiety, hyperarousal and panic attacks, hypersexuality, and internalized sensory symptoms such as high blood pressure, migraines, physical pain, inflammatory bowel, etc.  When you get such people hyperaroused these problems increase not decrease, they become more impulsive, they do more self destructive acts not less.  Tony Soprano needs treatment but it is obvious that the treatment that Dr. Melfi provides can not be used by Tony Soprano for he does not have the mindfulness to think when he is emotionally aroused.  Instead he needs something like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, a form of which is Anger Management Janice later gets where you teach him skills when he is not aroused and teach them so well they become habits.  Thus when the amalgada is hyperarousal the natural thing for the amygdala does is retrieve habits (compulsions) and impulses and thus he is more likely to be able to use the habits to de-escalate his arousal and calm down.  Yet we never see Melfi do this in a constructive manner, instead its all talk therapy about the events of the day or his emotions.  Dr. Melfi is like playing gun shot noises to a PTSD patient without first teaching him the skills to calm down when a PTSD patient hears loud noises.  Dr. Melfi knows what she needs to do but still does not do it.  Dr. Melfi knows she is making no progress with talk therapy and that the science actually suggests him going to a behavorist yet she continues to treat him with an ineffective treatment that she knew was not going to work only 1 year in.  Tony is not going to make his own ""emotional breakthrough"" for he is ""oblivious"" to emotional mindfulness during the times he is emotional, thus you have to teach him proactive skills to use in his daily life where he does not need to be emotional mindfulness to come to the correct decision.  You can't teach a blind man to see, instead you teach him compensatory skills that work towards his strengths and not expect him to overcome his disability with willpower, or repeating the same failure over and over again.   Thus you give a blind man a cane, and teach him other ways to interact with the world without sight.  It is like expecting a person to have good handwritting skills when they are incapable of holding a pencil with a tripod grasp (thumb, index finger, middle finger form a triangle with pencil in between, picture).  Cursive handwriting does not work when you hold a pencil like a knife or spear with a palamar grasp, where 4 fingers and a thumb are holding the pencil like you would hold a 12 oz can of soda, it just does not work.  Instead teach the person to communicate with verbal communication or with typing and stop expecting more cursive lessons to work.          Sorry rant over, maybe it is due to my personal history or with my background of my mom being an OT who works with people who have fine motor and coordination deficits.  Some things can be taught, and some things can not be.  When you can't teach something you figure out a way to reorganize your life so you do not need the skill that you are deficit with.  This is the exact purpose of a cognitive behavioral psychologist, an occupational therapist of the mind."

The core characteristics of alexithymia are marked dysfunction in emotional awareness, social attachment, and interpersonal relating.  Furthermore, individuals suffering from alexithymia also have difficulty in distinguishing and appreciating the emotions of others, which is thought to lead to unempathic and ineffective emotional responding.  Alexithymia is prevalent in approximately 10% of the general population and is known to be comorbid with a number of psychiatric conditions.

My background is in speech-language therapy so your mom and I probably share a lot of the same knowledge and skills. In some ways I think Dr Melfi has too much of her own psychology to deal with to be an adequate therapist for Tony (I would even describe it as malpractice). All psychologists/psychiatrists should be and are required to seek psychological treatment, but Dr Melfi gets no psychological guidance from Elliot who is self-serving and unethical."

Laying back and doing nothing while at the same time feeling incredibly entitled. Being elitist after learning new things in school.

You really seem to want to get into a semantic argument over how a straight woman couldn't accurately judge the hotness of Charmaine Bucco. I guess that's your thing."

thesopranos,37lj0p,Calikola,8,Fri May 29 15:16:34 2015 UTC,I always enjoyed the fact that Charmaine never took a dime from Tony (unless it was for legitimate business like catering Livia's funeral) and was always able to stick it to him verbally.
thesopranos,37lj0p,acorsicanpimp,-2,Thu May 28 15:10:48 2015 UTC,You and her are still being hypocrites to think that Charmaine isn't being paid in blood money. Charmaine is just stupid for drawing this false dichotomy and not making more off Tony.
thesopranos,37lj0p,nofuckinpodcast,28,Thu May 28 17:05:26 2015 UTC,"Let me see if I can /r/changeyourview here. Charmaine has one of, if not the best insult in the whole series.  Wayyy back in season one, when Carmella asked Charmaine to cater her charity event, Carm and Charm (spinoff, anyone?) are talking after the event. Tension has been building between them all episode long. Carmella has been condescending about Charmaine's life, and Charmaine feels like she's been treated like staff. She's been walking around her friend's fancy home with her fancy friends, facing constant reminders about the differences in their social classes and the choices they've each made in their lives.  By episode's end, Charmaine has had it, and while Carmella continues to condescend, Charmaine's figured out the perfect comeback. She says that when Tony and Carmella split up for a summer, Tony called Charmaine for a booty call and she went for it. But, she says, it wasn't for me, and she liked what Artie had to offer better.  I feel stupid for how many viewings it took before I got what she actually meant. She slept with Tony, but it ""wasn't for her"" and she prefers what she has now.  Charmaine basically says, to Carmella's face, that Artie is a better lay than Tony.   Carmella can have the money and the house and the status. Charmaine's getting hers, just fine."
thesopranos,37lj0p,Calikola,20,Fri May 29 15:17:56 2015 UTC,"My favorite directing choice in that episode is when Charmaine observes Carmella summoning her housekeeper to clean a china cabinet. She waves her over in a very authoritative way and bitches about how the cabinet wasn't cleaned to her specifications.   Later on in that episode, Carmella summons Charmaine the exact same way, and you can tell by Charmaine's horrified reaction that she has picked up on it. Carmella says they're friends, but really, she views Charmaine and Artie as being beneath her. They are ""the help."""

thesopranos,37ksj1,UndeadDinosaur,4,Thu May 28 22:45:56 2015 UTC,"Little Carmine probably gave the order to Butchie with Paulie's consent. There are a few hints in the final few episodes   Butchie originally planned the three hits on the Soprano crew in a barber's shop (where Paulie is specifically mentioned as not a target.) Then in Made in America Paulie walks into Satriale's with a box of barber scissors (the 30 pieces of silver) In the final sit-down Butchie keeps looking towards Carmine before making a decision (as he is the new heir-apparent of the Lupertazzi crime family) Little Carmine looks sad and says ""It didn't have to be this way"" Paulie shakes Butchie's hand behind Tony's back When Paulie calls Tony to tell him Carlo is missing, he says they were supposed to see Butchie ""to run down a few items."" Little Carmine had been ""crying the blues"" over Tony's feud with Phil because it was hurting his income When Butchie bumps into Tony at the hospital he says ""We gotta stop meeting like this!"" Paulie is wrecked with guilt over something important in the final episode  Paulie has a dream where he sees Pussy's ghost and he asks him ""When my time comes, will I stand up?"" This is in the same episode where Tony begins to doubt Paulie's true loyalty after realizing he used to give Soprano secrets to Johnny Sack (i.e. New York) Mikey Palmice's ghost telling Paulie and Tony 3 o'clock   These in aggregate make me believe that it was the new boss Carmine Lupertazzi's decision to whack Tony. He couldn't continue business with Tony after the graphic way that Phil was executed in front of his family - his capos and soldiers would never stand for it. So Carmine gave the nod to Butchie to finish the original plan of decapitating the Sopranos and doing business with what is left. And while I don't believe Paulie was involved with the planning of the hit, he was informed about it. As Tony's under-boss, Paulie would presumably be the new head of the family - but he would have been a puppet of New York who betrayed his friends and would die alone not long after.  Carmine ordered the hit, Butchie executed it and Paulie knew about it."
thesopranos,37ksj1,UndeadDinosaur,1 point,Fri May 29 18:00:07 2015 UTC,"Holy baloney, that's interesting. Do you think Carlos was in on this, as he was supposed to go with Paulie to see Butch?  Not sure what Butch' remark to Tony in the hospital would have to do with it, or the three o'clock, but perhaps I'm missing something here?"
thesopranos,37ksj1,UndeadDinosaur,3,Fri May 29 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"In Blue Comet when Silvio strangles Burt Gervasi, he tells Tony that Phil's guys tried to start an insurrection in the Soprano family by going after the middle-management. So New York could have spoke to Carlo, Paulie, Albert(?) and even Patsi - whose loyalties were not as certain as Silvio's. So that incident confirms that Phil's were talking to people in the Soprano crew. Like Tony says most of his friends are jackals.  Carlo was probably the person that told Phil about Vito being gay. When Finn is brought into Satriale's and tells everyone that he saw Vito blowing that security guard, Tony swears everyone to secrecy. Then in the very next scene Phil is going over to his cousin's house and he knows the exact story that Finn had told and says ""the witness has no reason to lie."" It could have just been Paulie flapping his gums (he's a gossip and homophobic) but Carlo had the most to gain from telling Phil because Carlo ends up taking over Vito's construction business. He's also the most militant about Vito being killed and praises Phil whacking him because ""at least its not all talk with him."" So yes definitely, Carlo could have been involved but the Feds picked him up before he could do anything.  The Butchie in the hospital thing was just an ominous threat he made to Tony. And Tony looks a bit uneasy after hearing it.  The 3 o'clock thing is confusing. It could mean the actual 3 o'clock angle that Tony was shot at, it could be Jesus telling Peter(Paul) he would deny him three times before 3am or it could mean nothing. I tend to think in the vision that David Chase set for the show that the supernatural and religious exist in their universe. So Christopher really is in Hell, the psychic was real, Paulie did see the Virgin Mary and ghosts haunt their killers in the show.  The Sopranos is a pretty Catholic show in that regard."
thesopranos,37ksj1,Topher_Wayne,1 point,Fri May 29 21:35:23 2015 UTC,"I had to rewatch a couple of scenes after I read this. The shot where they walk away from the sitdown in Made in America, Tony is walking away, but turns around quickly to get a glance of Paulie and Butch shaking hands, a bit like when he turns around to see the water bottles.  And then the mention of Pauile not being a target... we know how thought-through every line in this show is, so they're not putting it in there for nothing.  But then the same goes for allt he stuff with Patsy and the Jasons...damn, I'm genuinely confused now, but that was actually one of the far fetched hopes I had for this thread. Thanks for the new insights!"
thesopranos,37ksj1,ShaolinMaster,1 point,Sat May 30 04:53:46 2015 UTC,"I think the stuff with the two Jasons getting picked up for ecstasy was just to show that there would be no escape for Tony Soprano. That even if he wasn't killed (which I am certain he was), it doesn't matter because the Feds would soon be after him as Carlo was going to testify against the Sopranos to save his son.  So either death or prison awaited Tony - there would be no happy ending for him."
thesopranos,37ksj1,ShaolinMaster,2,Sat May 30 13:51:13 2015 UTC,"My guess is the hit wasn't so much revenge for NY or Phil or whatever, but the Soprano crew was decimated & all that was left was the snakes head (Tony) so they decapitate, like they said on the show. I think the 5 families got together & sanctioned the hit on Tony & split up the Soprano territory amongst themselves, because like it was said on the show, The Soprano Family was small, ""5 fuckin families & then that pygmy thing over in Jersey."" & ""The Sopranos are nothing more than a glorified crew.""   I think the mafia as a whole was tired of the Soprano bullshit, seeing that the leadership is pretty much killed, they whacked Tony & split up what was left & anyone left, like the lower level soldiers, maybe they go on the lam, or get absorbed into New York or something. Anyway this is my thought on how Tony was killed."
thesopranos,37ksj1,morosco,3,Sat May 30 12:32:06 2015 UTC,"From David Chase's publicist:   ""As David Chase has said numerous times on the record, ‘Whether Tony Soprano is alive or dead is not the point.' To continue to search for this answer is fruitless. The final scene of The Sopranos raises a spiritual question that has no right or wrong answer.""  ""Though you wouldn't know it from watching Hollywood movies, endings are by nature mysterious. There is the instability of loss in an ending as well as the satisfying sense of completion. American television before Chase, with the exception of David Lynch's Twin Peaks, one of Chase's avowed key inspirations for the art of The Sopranos, built a craft that dispenses with the destabilizing aspects of an ending. The true art of closure will not tolerate such a boring decision. Moreover, the art of closure forbids merely telling the audience in words that there is loss, since words can create the illusion of safety and control. Chase's art seeks a silent level of knowing more profound than words. He believes we already know if we open up to that deeper part of us.""   From Steven Van Zandt:   'I'll tell you exactly what happened. The director said cut, the actors went home. That's what happened.' It's a TV show. It's a fucking TV show, okay?"

thesopranos,37ksj1,acorsicanpimp,7,Thu May 28 13:05:10 2015 UTC,"But was there a hit?  Edit: Ok, to be fair and answer the question: If there was a hit, it would've been New York. Butch would've ended the war to get Tony/Jersey to think everything was safe and then they would hit him when his guard was down and deal with whoever was left on the streets (like Paulie). This way they remove the shrewd Tony out of the picture and have the less smart Paulie take charge. They would be more able to control Paulie because he's weaker and the Jersey family is weaker.  This actually happened in Philadelphia with Angelo Bruno and Nicky Scarfo."
thesopranos,37ksj1,JohnBoy347,1 point,Thu May 28 13:12:05 2015 UTC,"I think those quotes have some relevance because this whole discussion either assumes that Chase has some idea about who killed Tony, or we're just pretending this world is real and we're having theoretical discussions about what these fictional characters did off-screen.   The way Chase talks about it, I'm not sure he ""knows"" or cares who ordered a hit on Tony.   Because ""that's not the point.""

What's the point is whether anything happens after you die, which is why this question was asked so many times throughout the show and was tapdanced on with the Bobby boat talk.

thesopranos,37ggs2,acorsicanpimp,2,Thu May 28 00:13:06 2015 UTC,"This couldn't be further from the truth, Tony died, AJ and Carmela are questionable, and you have no idea how to recognize symbolism in a tv show even when David Chase beats you over the head with themes more than anyone I've seen before:  1) Member's Only is the first episode of s6, Jean wears a Member's Only jacket and shoots someone in a restaurant in the side of the head   2) In the last episode of s6 the camera four times shows an unnamed man wearing a Member's Only jacket and looking suspiciously at Tony before he goes to the bathroom and exits to the side of Tony and shoots his head  3) Tony multiple times throughout the show and in the last episode says that family members don't get touched - just (mafia) members only  4) The chosen hitman of Tony resembles his dad, symbolizing the cycle of life and the episode is titled Made in the USA which means a) becoming a made man in the family and b) it's how Johnny Boy and Tony made themselves in the USA and c) how Tony made his name by taking down a big name and how this hitman will make a name for himself by taking down a big name. (and d) the point of the shot of the trucker with the USA hat, to literally shove the connection in your face)  5) Think that orange cat meant nothing too? It stares at the dead and the next to die, which is why it stared at Pauly after he reluctantly took the captain position of a crew where the leader always died, and why there is an orange cat painting, commissioned by Chase for the finale of the show, staring at Tony in the last scene.  6) Then the multiple last supper images from supper being the name for dinner at Junior's ward, the quick shot of Tony appearing to be at the center of a last supper table after he enters the restaurant, and the onion ring communion with AJ and Carmela.   For starters - there are about 50 more reasons like bells and Bobby's boat talk with Bobby about not hearing it coming, Rihannon's name, Parice, and more.   But you don't seem to understand symbolism very well so this may be beyond you."
thesopranos,37ggs2,T12ISC,1 point,Wed May 27 23:04:09 2015 UTC,"The combination of self righteousness and simple-minded assumption making in this post is too inflammatory for me not to counter it. It's like you've managed to brainwash yourself because you think you're so smart. Let me explain why I don't think you are.  1) The members only jacket connection is interesting, but those are very, very common jackets. It would be like a connection of ray bans; just because an episode is called ray bans and then a character is later wearing ray bans doesn't mean there's a connection. 2) The camera shows the guy to give the scene some tension and I guess, to confuse some people after the show is over. He's just looking around. No, he didn't shoot Tony in the head, he went to the bathroom, you can actually see him go into the bathroom. Obviously if he shot somebody, there would be no debate here. 4) It looks like you accidentally misused the word literally here in an attempt to add emphasis to your otherwise limp observation, which makes me wary of your ability to form good reasoning. 5) Everybody dies, this is a big theme in Sopranos. This could just as easily be interpreted as a hint that Paulie will continue to cross Tony to the point where Tony kills him in a manner similar to how he killed Chris. 6) Tony and Jesus have absolutely nothing in common, aside from charisma. If Jesus died for mans sins, Tony would be dying for his own sins, if anything, opposite of Jesus. ""Onion ring communion""? That's funny, but really out there.   None of your points are convincing at all. Believe what you want to believe, but quit acting like you have it all figured out.  edit: I almost forgot, don't you think if somebody wanted to kill Tony Soprano, they wouldn't be fucking around for 5 minutes without a mask in a crowded restaurant beforehand while he's surrounded by family? Take a step back and rethink this."
thesopranos,37ggs2,acorsicanpimp,-1,Tue Jun 23 16:21:04 2015 UTC,LOL so if you read Shakespeare there's no way to determine symbolism within without digging him up and reincarnating him? Why don't you try to address my points rather than plug your ears and say nya nya nya-nya nyaaaa?
thesopranos,37ggs2,acorsicanpimp,2,Wed May 27 23:29:18 2015 UTC,"Does David Chase need to confirm every bit of symbolism on the show? Or is it possible that you can watch a scene and detect obvious, repeated across episodes themes?"

thesopranos,37ggs2,JohnBoy347,0,Thu May 28 00:03:14 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there will always be unthinking, in denial, and irrational trolls who'll still argue that Tony may not be dead despite the very clear words from Chase you just quoted.  It's psychologically fascinating the way people deny the obvious because they didn't explicitly see it.  Why can't some people accept that a fictional character met his demise?  Do they love Tony that much?"

thesopranos,37ggs2,looningabout,0,Fri May 29 04:26:44 2015 UTC,"Ok, I guess I don't understand how you can watch the Sopranos and conclude that there's no foreshadowing and that the show's style is to be ambiguous.  Just for one example, things come to be understood through Tony's therapy.  His fainting when seeing cold cuts?  Because his Mom would get turned on when Johnny would bring extortion meat home that Tony witnessed him stealing and cutting the butcher's finger off.  No ambiguity there.  Or take the ""Test Dream"" sequence that foreshadows Tony B. shooting Phil.

thesopranos,37ggs2,looningabout,6,Wed May 27 22:59:51 2015 UTC,"First, I never said the Sopranos didn't use ambiguity, I disagreed with your premise that the style of the show and Tony's fate, was ambiguous and don''t use foreshadowing.  You asked for evidence which I gave two examples and a link with very thorough breakdown of the ending which you obviously didn't read.  Instead, you linked me to wikipedia but I don't think read the definitions yourself so I'll put them here.  ""Foreshadowing or guessing ahead is a literary device by which an author hints what is to come.""  I referenced the ""Test Dream"", which, in a dream sequence, depicts Tony B. shooting Phil.  Later, Tony wakes from the dream, Christopher comes to tell him that Tony B. shot Phil and his brother Billy.  The dream foreshadowed the attack on Phil and Bill.  Another example of foreshadowing that relates to Tony's fate and the final scene starts in ""Sopranos Home Movies"".  Tony and Bobby are discussing how lives of connected guys usually ends in getting clipped or in jail.  In regards to getting shot, Bobby says, ""you probably don't even hear it when it happens, right?"".  In the next episode, ""Stage 5"", Silvio is at the table when Gerry Torciano gets shot.  Silvio and the audience neither see, nor hear, the gunmen and the shot, until Gerry is already bleeding out.  Sil later tells Tony, ""the fuckin' scary thing was, I didn't know what happened until after the shot was fired,'.  These examples foreshadow the instant black of Tony's death in the final scene, never hearing or seeing the shot or the gunman.  Here's an excerpt from the mastersofsopranos link I posted (which you should read), with commentary from Chase:  Chase in an interview with Brett Martin for the HBO Sopranos final edition book confirmed the significance of the Torciano scene:  Question: Are they wasting their time? Is there a puzzle to be solved? [to the end]  Chase: There are no esoteric clues in there. No Da Vinci Code. Everything that pertains to that episode was in that episode. And it was in the episode before that and the one before that and seasons before this one and so on. There had been indications of what the end is like. Remember when Jerry Torciano was killed? Silvio was not aware that the gun had been fired until after Jerry was on his way down to the floor. That’s the way things happen: It’s already going on by the time you even notice it.  Question: Are you saying…?  Chase: I’m not saying anything. I’m not trying to be coy. It’s just that I think that to explain it would diminish it.  Furthermore, from an “Air America” radio interview of David Chase conducted by Richard Belzer on April 14, 2008:  Richard Belzer: I was working with Steve Schirripa [Bacala] recently. We were judging “Last Coming Standing” for NBC and we were talking about a lot of things and he was saying he heard all of these theories for the show that had nothing to do with your intention and wasn’t anything the actors thought. Like little hints along the way, like a word, like when Tony and Steve are on the boat at the lake and they say “‘you never know its gonna happen” or “you never know its gonna hit you”  David Chase: That was part of the ending.  Richard Belzer: Oh, it was? see, what do I know? Were there other things in previous episodes that were hints towards it?  David Chase: There was that and there was a shooting in which Silvio was a witness. Well he wasn’t a witness, he was eating dinner with a couple of hookers and with some other guy who got hit and there was some visual stuff that went on there which sort of amplified Tony’s remark to Bacala about you know “you don’t know its happened” or “you won’t know it happened when it hits you”. That’s about it.  The “never hear it concept” is expressed by Chase throughout the final episode. Phil is killed in almost the exact same way as Tony. Phil is shot in the side of the head and presumably “never heard it coming.” Tony’s vulnerability from behind (MOG shoots Tony from behind) to set up Tony “never hearing it happen” is consistently foreshadowed in “Made in America.” Chase does this in two separate scenes. The first scene is the sit-down with New York where NY boss “George” is the mediator. George asks Tony if he wants water which is behind Tony. In response, Tony does a fast “spin around” to see what is behind him as if he is vulnerable. In the very beginning of the Tony-Junior scene, Tony is staring at Junior. An orderly behind Tony (behind his right shoulder, where MOG would be) asks Tony twice to move out of his way and raises his voice (Tony “never heard” him). Finally, Tony looks behind him and seems to be surprised to see the orderly. Furthermore, at the family’s safe house, Carmela asks Tony if he is being careful; Tony looks away and never gives Carmela an answer. In the previous episode “Blue Comet,” Tony tells Silvio to have “eyes behind the back of your head” when he is referring to Phil’s possible retaliation against Tony’s crew. Unfortunately, Tony does not take his own advice at Holsten’s."

It is specifically left for the viewer to have to go back and re watch and critically analyze what they think happened  Good example as to why he is dead.  Members only ends with a fade to black as he loses consciousness slowly after being shot.

This is why Chase will never explicitly state that Tony's dead. He's hinted strongly on several occasions. What else do you need? Agreed, some of the clues supporting the theory may be of questionable clarity, but others are smash-in-your-face, like the flashback at the end of Blue Comet.

Your interpenetration of the ending is one of death, and mine is one of a life lived in uncertainty.

She mentioned that she paid off her student loans with her first paycheck from the show.  Before that and Oz she was waiting tables in Manhattan.  Gandolfini was very selective of roles and usually chose supporting characters to play, so his success outside of Sopranos was limited by his interests.  He also did a couple of documentaries on Iraq war veterans.  Financially, he was pretty much one of the richest in the business considering that he made $1,000,000 an episode at one point.  People like Buscemi were already widely established before Sopranos and probably got the roles they did on the show for that reason.

Conversely, Richie was released from prison and hard to start from scratch again, so he was resentful of Beansie's success.  I forget whether Richie went away for selling heroin or not, but if he did, he may have resented the fact that he did time for it, while Beansie didn't and ended up quite successful.

Richie felt that he took care of Beans and gave him the opportunity to become a successful businessman, and that Beansie should return the favor when he got out of prison. Beans used to be part of Richies crew but never went to visit him in prison, which made probably the extortion easier. Beans was a civilian so Richie was arguably right in extorting him (in Mafia terms) - even though Beans was connected.   Running him over with the car was another story, which is why Tony made him pay for the ramp and so on. Had Richie not been a legend, he would probably had bigger problems."

He knows all about the mob and how dangerous someone like Richie can be. Therefore, it's more than likely that Beansie wasn't in debt to Richie otherwise he was going to have to pay it.    Why does Beansie deny the debt?   Either Beansie didn't owe Richie or felt as if he didn't owe Richie anything. As mentioned earlier, Beansie isn't an everyday store owner, he knows what's going on with Richie so he's not going to want to be push any of his buttons. Also, Beansie probably knew that he would have Tony's backing in the situation.   Why does Tony accuse Richie of shaking Beansie down?   Tony doesn't like Richie. It's that simple. Tony is against Janice and Richie's relationship, Tony is unwilling to back Richie in almost any situation, Tony's behaviour and overall attitude towards Richie, especially in the card's game."

thesopranos,37544x,bucknasty219,12,Sun May 24 23:57:52 2015 UTC,I don't think it is due to location.  The Sopranos are based on the Decavalcante family in Jersey.  They are supported I believe by the Gambino's (I may be wrong) which is who I think the Lupertazzi's are based on.

Ralph becoming ""good"" (relatively speaking) just before dying is definitely a big part of his arc, and it's clear from the rest of the series that Tony can't stand it when others improve themselves (e.g. Janice's anger management, Tony B going straight, Chris's sobriety, etc.)  I'd say Tony killed Ralph mostly just out of pure rage over thinking Ralph killed the horse, though at the end as Tony was banging Ralph's head to a pulp he may have been thinking of Tracy, too (hence the infamously opaque line ""she was a beautiful, innocent creature!"" which could apply to either her or the horse, or both)."

FFS, Paulie went to steal the life savings of an old woman and smothered her in the process--do you think Tony would care much about that?  They treated each other like shit too, there was no real closeness there.  As for his treating women like garbage, do we really have to go over the ways that Tony, Sil, and Christopher likewise used and abused women? How was Ralph much different? Can you really state for sure that none of them wouldn't have killed one of the women they were screwing if she got pregnant?

There are very few instances where he shows remorse or guilt. Being happy that he didn't kill Meadow's soccer coach, or when he gets a pang of guilt flashing back to his murder of Bevilaqua when he hears the kid say ""Mommy"" at the mall. These flashes are very few and far between.  When Tony is crying in therapy about the death of Pie-O-My, and Melfi says, ""You've caused a great deal of suffering yourself,"" Tony has no flood of feelings, does not open up about the heinous things he does and enables.

thesopranos,36ttd3,UniversalPolymath,2,Fri May 22 22:27:37 2015 UTC,I was too lazy to do it but i wanted to post that HA!
thesopranos,36ttd3,chaspooley,5,Sat May 23 00:05:49 2015 UTC,Weiners episodes were also great.
thesopranos,36ttd3,Jon_targaryen1,7,Fri May 22 04:35:24 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I love Mad Men, but I think the Sopranos episodes that Weiner wrote by himself are some of the weaker ones of the show. Stuff like Rat Pack, Sentimental Education, Luxury Lounge, Moe n' Joe, Chasing It... especially Luxury Lounge and Moe n' Joe which make 6A seem a lot weaker than it really is. I'd say that all of those episodes are definitely the weakest of their respective seasons. They're not bad, but they have a kind of lack of subtlety which The Sopranos, at its best, largely avoided. Even Weiner's one solo gem, Mayham, is mostly great for the coma/Tony stuff but has that same overly broad quality when we go to, say, Vito and Silvio. Oddly, though, the ones Weiner co-wrote with either Terence Winter or David Chase were some of the best episodes ever: Kennedy and Heidi, The Blue Comet, The Test Dream, Unidentified Black Males, Soprano Home Movies, Kaisha (okay maybe that's not one of the very best but it's underrated). Perhaps his influence on the Sopranos was best in smaller quantities, or when reined in by Chase, I dunno.  I think Winter was definitely the best all-around writer, not counting Chase who had his influence all over every episode to some degree. Burgess & Green were also great, and Frank Renzulli penned some of the strongest earlier episodes. I think Michael Imperioli's underrated, as his only misfire is Christopher but the rest are gems. Todd A. Kessler and Lawrence Konner did good jobs with the few episodes they got. You can tell who the worst writers were by looking at a lot of Season 1 credits, the people who only wrote one ep and were obviously fired; Chase cleaned house after S1 because he thought too many writers just didn't ""get"" what he was going for, e.g. what he called the ""East Coast bullying"" style of dialogue."
thesopranos,36ttd3,somerton,2,Fri May 22 09:05:45 2015 UTC,Every episode you just named... some of my favorites... ESPECIALLY CHASING IT... one of the best  Weiner Rules.. they all rule actually
thesopranos,36ttd3,chaspooley,2,Fri May 22 19:18:58 2015 UTC,"I will say that I've always thought Chasing It is definitely underrated -- it's just that the rest of 6B is so strong that it sticks out as flawed. Mainly, I think, because the Vito Jr. plot is so weak (that shower scene! ugh... though the last scene where he's taken away out of bed to Idaho or wherever is pretty devastating). The Tony/gambling/Hesh stuff is classic, though; if the whole episode were focused on that, it wouldn't be far from the level of the rest of the season.  I also like the Carm stuff in Sentimental Education, as it's so unique within the show (the only time we see her actually have a real relationship with another man). But the Tony B plot, while entertaining, just strikes me as a bit too ""easy"" in how it gets him back in the game. Plus that episode has one of the weirdest transitions to end credits, hard to explain but it's just odd.  And again, there's some strong stuff with Vito actually in Moe n' Joe, but the handling of Johnny Sack's plot seems way too rushed to me and the Janice-Tony scenes just feel like re-heated Cold Cuts (no pun intended). I could go thru all those episodes and find some great stuff worth mentioning (e.g. Massarone and the painting in Rat Pack), I just find them relatively weak on the whole."
thesopranos,36ttd3,somerton,1 point,Fri May 22 23:56:40 2015 UTC,"Again... gonna disagree with you on the whole bruda..... I think the Vito Jr story is AMAZING in chasing it.... I actually drew a pic of them from the ice cream shop.... That is an amazing scene bro.... Every line is fucking steeped with hypocrisy and terribleness  ""Have you ever though about your mother, everything she's been through, how YOUR upsetting her.""  What a way to present it when it is clearly Phil who put the family in that situation.  Also Tony's convo with Vito makes him SEEM human and fatherly, tho we know he is a piece of shit who ends up BLOWING the money gambling, then having the kid stolen in the night.  All these things just show me how fucking maniacal and terrible the characters are.  Also just a hilarious scene. ""I didn't come here to buy you a couple sundays....its a silo... i don't give a fuck what it is.""  and ""Puerto Rican Whore""  HA  Also i like sentimental education because Tony B is learning that he cannot function outside the mafia... kinda like going to school also and all that...  does that one end with Tony B hitting Peeps?  or am i twisted...  anyway excellent pun tho ha reheated COLD Cuts.... great thing to point out about Carms relationship tho... in her and tony we always see her as sympathetic.. granted we see that in her new relationship but we also see her manipulative and shitty side.. great catch there man  Always good to get someone who is willing to chat about this show extensively,, it really is so rich  ""DID IT EVER OCCUR TO OU THAT I MIGHT KNOW WHAT IM DOING!"""

thesopranos,36ttd3,SevenwithaT,2,Tue May 26 06:26:38 2015 UTC,So how come The Sopranos has so many different writers?  Does it lose any direction in story because of this?
thesopranos,36ttd3,JamesGumb,2,Fri May 22 03:16:03 2015 UTC,Interesting.  Sometimes I'm watching the show and there are some details and themes in here and there that completely baffle and impress me.  So I think to myself how is it possible that this writer is so intelligent in so many fields?  It almost seemed superhuman to me.  I guess now that you say this has been a team effort there's no one person you can credit.
thesopranos,36ttd3,JamesGumb,5,Fri May 22 04:20:40 2015 UTC,Lots of shows change their staff over time. As long as the showrunner stays on--and David Chase was a master--things should stay consistent.
thesopranos,36ttd3,A_Lie_Agreed_Upon,4,Fri May 22 04:39:12 2015 UTC,"Basically, show runners like David Chase and Matthew Weiner wrote every single episode when all is said and done. It becomes a question of how much. Weiner said that if more than 75% of a script is his work after rewriting another writer,  he then puts his name on it. So chances are, that written by Terrence winter is about 50 his draft, 50 Chase."

All the sudden you watch an NFL game and Eli Manning is crying about domestic abuse.  Silly political Correctness, makes everyone seem fucking stupid and immature.  Its fucking Game of Thrones people!  Fictionalized television about magic... Don't get me wrong.. rape is a terrible thing to do NO QUESTION!... worse than killing? genocide?  all of these things have been done more times than once in GoT and it hasnt been a problem before now.  Also employee of the month probably shits on any Game of Thrones episode to date... so theres that"
thesopranos,36m92t,Calikola,3,Wed May 20 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"I completely agree about the Melfi scene, and I watched it for the first time less than a year ago. If anything, I find it less outrageous (but even more difficult to watch) because of how real it was--that shit happens in our fucked up world. Now, of course GoT is fantasy, and it's also loosely based on a historical time period where stuff like that happened a lot, I'm sure.   But my problem with the Sansa scene is that the viewer was basically turned into Reek (Theon), forced to watch the horrific act for no reason other than perverse pleasure. I did not appreciate it, it felt like a sucker punch. I don't see how it advanced the plot or provided characterization for Ramsay or Sansa.  The Melfi scene created one of the most interesting tests of character for her: whether she would betray her role as a moral person for her own purposes. No doubt vengeance would have been sweet and complete had Tony gotten involved. It really was a remarkable plot point. I felt the opposite about this GoT scene."
thesopranos,36m92t,forsbergisgod,2,Wed May 20 19:01:24 2015 UTC,"My issue with the Sansa scene is not necessarily that it was a deviation from the books, but a deviation that only served to put her back in a similar position she has been in before. She's a victim, again. She's being used as a plaything by a powerful man, again. The only difference is that this time, instead of being threatened with rape, she was actually raped. It's just disappointing to see Sansa become a victim again when she seemed like she was finally heading down a path where she would be empowered."
thesopranos,36m92t,MonkeyCha0s,1 point,Tue May 26 16:58:01 2015 UTC,IMO the scene was about Reek becoming Theon again. He still has brotherly feelings for Sansa and it showed in his emotion. Theon will kill Ramsay thereby completing his redemptive arc.

thesopranos,36m92t,mokoko__,-1,Thu May 21 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"Because there was a 'moral' to the story in 'Employee of the month', where as the scene in 'GoT' was horribly ripped out of context from the book and disgustingly shoved in to the episode for shock value without any reason for it to actually be there, D&D have been doing this since season 4 and it's destroying the show, compromising quality for shock value and gore and more 'controversy', i hope this bites them in the arse soon, and by the looks of how terrible season 5 has been so far I could actually see that happening.   EDIT: DAMN, didn't watch last weeks episode, thought you were speaking about the Cersi-Jamie rape scene, but by the looks of it this one was just as pointless and not story driven, and it looks like it really is biting them in the arse HAHA (nelson voice)"
thesopranos,36m92t,DarylsCrossbow,-4,Wed May 20 12:51:06 2015 UTC,The GoT controversy was about whether it was consensual or not (scene was kinda ambiguous). Also it was incest. The Melfi one is just a normal rape and there's no 2 opinions about it. Hence no controversy

It's about our subconscious and what's bubbling beneath the surface. A lot of these ghosts are ghosts of the mind. It's the person observing who gives them meaning.

Sometimes things just didn't have overblown shocking resolves because that's how real life is. the cat, the Russian, the ambiguity over the cop Christopher shot, sometimes things don't get answered, ever.

As for Paulie being coo-coo about it, he is just paranoid and into superstitions.  Its very comical if you think about it.  3 o'clock would be the military style way of describing the location at which the man in jacket would have exited the bathroom to kill T.

Things happen during the process of creating stories that just work because of the Artists mind being so wrapped up in the themes they are writing about.

thesopranos,366tsc,mrperlstein,15,Sat May 16 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"I dunno, though. Chris first says ""Do you remember Dickie Moltisanti?"" Haydu says no and then says, ""was he a friend of yours?"" Haydu's seemingly unprompted use of past tense could be a tell, but he also could have guessed this person was dead because Chris said ""do you remember him"" and not ""do you know him."" Chris then definitively implies Dickie is dead: ""he was my father"" and so on. From there on it's impossible to know. I'm in the camp of this being another one of those ambiguities, like did Ralph kill the horse or not. I don't think Haydu saying ""I'm sorry!"" right before he's killed is necessarily damning, either, as I think most people with a guy about to shoot them would say about anything they thought might assuage the situation.  One thing that seems suspicious to me about Haydu, though, is the odd look in his eyes before he says that no, he didn't know Dickie. But I don't know if that means he's lying or he's just trying to think for a second or what.  Anyway, the whole scene gives off a certain air of futility. This guy might have killed Dickie, he might have not, but it's too late now and Chris has to kill him anyway. There's no real sense of satisfaction for Chris or for us. Even the guy's wallet only holds a single twenty. It's not exactly a triumphant moment. Some crappy Magnum PI rerun is on the TV and the house is bare and barely furnished; Chris lamely shoots the fish-head at the end as if to try to wring some joy and excitement out of it, but you can tell it's all very disappointing. When Haydu says that whoever told Chris he killed Dickie is lying and setting him up, it's as if it makes him even angrier because on some level he knows it's probably true. All of this stuff adds to the pervasive sense of discontent, malaise and general post-9/11 gloominess that so much of Season 4 is mired in.

But you might be right that the series became less interested in providing concrete answers and plot resolutions as it went on.  Perhaps the earliest instance of the show's ambiguous storytelling (and maybe the most significant example) is the question of just how consciously culpable Livia was for the attempt on Tony's life in season one. Whether she was consciously playing Junior with full knowledge of the implications of their conversations or she was just a naïve ""babbling idiot"" with genuine early signs of dementia - the show allows it to play both ways.  I also like all the unanswered spiritual mysteries of the show. The psychic who seemed to know more about Paulie's past than simple cold reading would've allowed him to (""Poison Ivy?""); the ghost of Pussy and the vision of the Virgin Mary; what exactly Tony did experience while in his coma. Who posted the Ojibwe saying in his room that rattles around in the back of his mind for the rest of the series? That stuff is fascinating to me."

I think with the Russian they were intending on resolving what happened to him, and there was supposed to be a war with the Russians but somehow that storyline changed.

thesopranos,363kuj,bucknasty219,1 point,Sat May 16 02:10:34 2015 UTC,"I think bad acting fucked things up a bit. Tony looked a lot like AJ in some of the flashbacks. Young Tony wasn't brilliant. He regretted that panic attack with blundetto, you see his dad yelling at him over Satriale's. Paulie says he was a little shaky on his first hit. Young Tony wasn't the badass, he grew into it.   Tony held some animosity towards older guys (Feech, Richie, Blundetto). That one episode they dropped the line that Tony doesn't fundamentally respect the elderly. I don't think Tony was much different than AJ growing up. I think they tried going that route too, AJ's clubbing in NY, AJ and his buds and that black guy, I just don't think AJ sold it well acting wise. I definately think that the subscript was their though, and the writers at least considered AJ growing up to be like his old man, and Tony not being that hot when he was a kid."
thesopranos,363kuj,lefty88,3,Sat May 16 03:46:00 2015 UTC,"Your comparison doesn't make any sense.  When Tony was getting yelled at because of what happened at Satriale's he witnessed someones finger being chopped off and didn't even flinch at around the age of 12 I imagine, meanwhile AJ gets dragged out of bed and starts crying. Tony robs a card game, not just any but one full of made guys and not just any made guys but Feech La Manna's, meanwhile AJ goes to a nursing home with a knife and nearly breaks down in fear and then runs off, not achieving anything, but getting into just as much trouble were it not for Tony.  It couldn't be any clearer what the writers were doing with AJs character.  I agree that the season where AJ was doing all that American Football stuff etc the writers will have been thinking about going down that road, but the actors physical build and appearance changed that pretty quickly."
thesopranos,363kuj,MicOxlong,-1,Sat May 16 11:56:18 2015 UTC,I got that impression..i just wish we could see the end results. I guess in my mind AJ will become a much bigger guy an will finally grow some balls and maybe not become like tony exactly but maybe a season 3 Christopher.
thesopranos,363kuj,avoritz,1 point,Sat May 16 05:39:46 2015 UTC,"No way is AJ turning into Tony, more like his complete opposite, you can tell that the character's nature is nothing like Tony's, he hasn't got that 'evil' ,for lack of a better word, inside him. By the time Tony was 20 he had already robbed a card game, AJ couldn't even stab his Uncle because he pissed himself, not only that but going there in the first place to do that was as dumb as it gets, young Tony had more brains than that and a lot more balls, Tony even says this in the same episode, not in these exact words, and then AJ begins to cry lmao, c'mon.  If anything AJ idolises his father and what he does, and wants to be like him, which son wouldn't? But by doing what he does through out the series he proves he's not built like that, mentally or physically. Now saying because he felt a rush from a car exploding (who wouldn't?) is him turning into Tony, looking for the same crazy thrills is a far stretch, it's basic human nature. AJ was meant to be seen as a pussy who can't do shit for himself plain and simple, if anything the last episode showed us that he wasn't completely doomed, being able to come out of depression and go into a bright looking future, even if it was only because his parents were throwing money at him."

Also to add to your second point, Patsy wasn't a boss, therefore didn't have the same responsibilities, another factor as to why Patrick may have been much better off than AJ etc."

thesopranos,361rsm,purplefire9,2,Fri May 15 12:32:21 2015 UTC,"With regards to how AJ and Jackie Jr. are portrayed, I think Todd VanDerWerff's writeup from second episode of Season 1 hits it:   There are, more or less, six generations portrayed in The Sopranos. There's the golden age, which is now long gone and perhaps over-romanticized, best established by Johnny Boy Soprano, whose shadow looms over the rest of the characters like few already dead characters ever have on TV. There's the actual living remnants of the golden age, exemplified by Junior and Livia, older people who constantly feel under-appreciated, regardless of whether those feelings are founded or not. There are the remnants of the long slouch toward the current situation, exemplified by people like Paulie (who gets his first ""Did you hear what I said?"" of the series in this episode, a gag that is never not funny). There's the current generation, young boomers who are trying to cope with their parents' legacy, exemplified by Tony. There's the next generation under them, Generation X, if you will, full of people who seem to the older folks to have little respect for the way things have always worked, exemplified by Christopher and Brendan. And there's the youngest generation, the Millennials, who have had everything handed to them on a platter and yet whine about everything (at least in Chase's view of the world), exemplified, of course, by Tony's kids."

This is totally weird, but the first time I saw that scene, I thought the Member's Only Guy was going to walk up to Tony and ask, ""Don't I know you from TV?"" I really thought it was going to be some kind of comment on the celebrity of guys like Tony and how we as the audience obsess about him while pretending to be repulsed by what he does.

It's very reminiscent of the conversation between Tony and the Physicist he meets in the hospital in 6a, and it makes me wonder if in some way this was Chase's intention from the ending, it was almost like an epiphany and I gladly admit that The Sopranos has played a big part in my growth as a human being."

Even though he is the senior captain I think Christopher would be more of an underboss than Paulie. Tony even says in S4 that he plans on giving his orders through him and only through him -- the definition of underboss.
thesopranos,35i2mp,Michaelm2434,1 point,Tue May 12 00:11:17 2015 UTC,I believe Tony intended on having Chris become the underboss and eventual boss but their relationship greatly deteriorated during seasons 4 and 5 so he scrapped that plan and went with Bobby instead.
thesopranos,35i2mp,Jon_targaryen1,1 point,Tue May 12 00:53:08 2015 UTC,"i was going to say the same thing. The plan was for Chris and he was the only one that he could trust. Despite the tree naming Bobby and Paulie as underboss, i still think that they were hardly so. Think about when Johnny Sack was underboss. Bobby and Paulie were nowhere near that position because Tony was fine controlling everything himself, and because christopher was the only one he trusted."

thesopranos,35gmhq,nofknziti,4,Sun May 10 04:35:44 2015 UTC,"Black Mirror - British miniseries of standalone episodes a bit it the vein of The Twilight Zone, only about modern angst, technology, power subversion and stuff like that. Six episodes and a holiday special starring John Hamm out so far, and a season 3 in the works. A must see.   The whole ""golden age"" thing is a concept that primarily relates to american television i think. The BBC has made great stuff all along.   Breaking Bad - Amazing on first watch, minus the last 2 episodes, which kinda ruined the whole thing for me. But then, it was always a pageturner, not a big show for rewatching, in my opinion. Walt is cool, though.  The Wire, Fantastic TV and ambitious storytelling. However, in a rich tale like that you're bound to end up with favorites, and in time, the rest starts to pale. For me season 2 with the unions and the Greek was so high up there that the rest got unfairly downrated in my sub and real conscious.  Boardwalk Empire. I fell in love with this one, and it's the first and so far only show I've watched every episode on broadcast night. I feel it picked up notably in the latter part of season 2, and ended brilliantly. The supporting players are the real treat, Rothstein the snake, Luciano the hothead, Capone, Lansky, what an ensemble!  The Shield. Now, I had a lot of trouble with this show, but at the time I had nothing better to watch (to do something useful with my life is out of the question!) so I got sucked into the thriller. This is isn't Premier League, and Vic Mackey is a bitter pill to swallow, but there's a lot of action, cliffhangers, lies and betrayals and stuff. Proceed at own risk.  SOA?  I'm not even gonna touch that one..  I like Better Call Saul, actually, it's a nice little slow riding show with lots of promise. They're clearly planning long term, and I'm curious as to how close they'll move the universe to the one we all know so well now.  Trailer Park Boys - I just absolutely love it and don't know what else I can say. I think most people will be able to decide if this is the show for them withing minutes after opening titles.  Try the biritish House of Cards. It's coloured by it's era (more 80s than 90s), but Richardson is a slippery fuck, well worth watching.  First two seasons of the british version of Life on Mars was kinda cool. John Simm has been in a lot of great BBC series."

It can be tough to pick up on stuff bc it just sorta throws you into it w/o an explanation of the complex relationships, motivations, etc.  Also, the dialogue can be a bit tough to follow at first.  But it's such a great, well done show.  It's like The Sopranos in that you can pick up new stuff each time you watch it.  And it's more and more impressive after each viewing because you have a better understanding of the big picture themes and how well each thing is connected into it.  I've probably watch the whole series 10+ times, but the first time I watched it I found it useful to read the episode wiki after viewing it to help put some of the things together that are hard to pickup on initially."

thesopranos,358lyc,ps_,13,Fri May 8 00:39:40 2015 UTC,"Here's a bit of a lengthy excerpt from Brett Martin's book Difficult Men: Behind the Scenes of a Creative Revolution: From The Sopranos and The Wire to Mad Men and Breaking Bad (which, by the way, if you're a fan of any or all of those shows, is a really interesting read):   “I wanted out,” said Robin Green of that Sunday meeting in Chase’s office. “But I would never have said that. He wanted us to say yes.”  By this time, the relationship between Chase and Green had long since begun to sour. the two had worked together, on and off, since Almost Grown. Now, with Renzulli long gone, she and Burgess were the only writers left from the original Sopranos staff. Long ago, she and Chase had bonded over stories about their mothers. Coming into season five, Green noticed that Chase had moved her chair around the writers’ room conference table. “It was so he didn’t have to look at me,” she said.  As Chase told it, the problem began and ended with the pair’s writing output. “From the beginning, there was something about The Sopranos they didn’t get. They either could not, or didn’t want to, understand the through-the-looking-glass quality of the wiseguy mentality. I sat there in a room while Robin argued with Terry all afternoon about whether Tony would have to kill Tony Blundetto.” The result, he said, was that he ended up doing more rewriting. “And the strange thing was that, as time went on, I was having to rewrite them more. They had like a reverse learning curve.”  Still, the relationship was obviously charged with long-standing emotions. “She became more and more truculent and obnoxious in the room,” Chase said. “What she was good at was asking, ‘Why? Why would that happen? Why?’”  “David’s a guy who …you kind of hold your breath around him. There’s a physical feeling of discomfort,” Green said.  Things only got worse in the first half of season six, when Green and Burgess worked on a script - about Tony, convalescing from his gunshot wound, trying to relocate to a better floor of the hospital - that ended up getting killed outright, the only time that had happened. Finally, Burgess came up from covering set one day to find Green in Chase’s office, getting fired (“Nobody ever wants to fire Mitch,” Green said, patting her husband’s hand.)  “He had a list of infractions, some of them going back twenty years,” she remembered. “He could cite the time when I drank too much at a party and interrupted a conversation he was having.”  Chase agreed to give them one more chance to finish a draft of the script they were working on, but the writing was on the wall. Two weeks later, neither argued when Chase told them the arrangement was over. Burgess placed his pencil down on Chase’s desk. “Well, shit, David, if you don’t think the work is any good, then fuck it,” he said.  The conflict didn’t end there. Chase was furious when a story in the WGA’s magazine, Written By, seemed to suggest that Burgess and Green had quit because they disapproved of the show’s direction, rather than been fired - even more so when their next series, a traditional CBS cop show called Blue Bloods, was initially marketed as being “from the executive producers of The Sopranos.” (The writers said that neither incident was under their control.)  For Green, the hurt feelings lingered. “I think about it all the time,” she said. But not to the exclusion of remembering what it had meant to be in that particular room at that particular moment in television history.  “I have every reason to say horrible things about David,” she said. “And yet, when I think back, I had more fun than I’ve ever had in my life writing for The Sopranos. What happened on that show, how it changed our lives, the excitement of it, the fun of the first season, where we didn’t know it was going to happen …it was the most fun I’ve ever had in my life.”   The TL;DR version is that despite their seniority, the writing team didn't quite ""get"" the show, particularly as it progressed. And also, David Chase is kind of a ""difficult man""."

It seems like Chase was a difficult guy to work for but I suppose he earned that right and what he created speaks for itself.  Writing room politics fascinate me though, especially on this show. I had a look through the Burgess and Green episodes and they wrote some absolutely amazing stuff.   But I also noticed that around the time that Weiner joined the staff, the show went in a direction and delved into themes that had been present from season 3 but not explored to the extent that they later did (and the final stretch just went all out with it).  I wonder whether Weiner just ""got"" the show better than Green and Burgess, at least in Chase's opinion? Its just a feeling but it is sort of reinforced by what they did after The Sopranos; we all know which is the spiritual successor to The Sopranos out of Mad Men and Blue Bloods."

All throughout I was just urging her to tell Tony, and was left feeling a bit disappointed when she said ""no"" at the very end. But that's an example of the clever writing of this show, the way it builds and builds itself up only to end on an anti-climax. I don't think us, the viewers, are supposed to be left feeling satisfied by the events of episodes. One major theme of the show, I've found, is futility.  Not just the rape, but also Janice being put in hospital after being beaten up by the Russians also left a mark on me. I know she's not the most popular of characters, but that was pretty fucked up, even if she did kind of bring it on herself."

Or if she did, it was mostly in a subconscious kind of way, which didn't literally spell out to her ""Adrianna was murdered by Silvio, on order from your husband via Christopher."" If she knew that, the fallout would be devastating and fascinating to watch.  On a similar note, what if Adriana really did end up telling all the mob wives at movie night the truth about herself? Confessing to Christopher was an astonishing and brutal scene, but it's pretty common in mob media for that kind of scene to happen: the mob wife reveals treachery or some mistake to her hair-triggered husband, and he goes crazy. But rarely do you see a mob wife confessing to other mob wives (all relatively decent people -- not Christopher, I mean) that she was forced to cooperate with the FBI. Now that would have been an interesting scene. Would they have sympathy and keep some kind of secret or would they just take her to Tony? I guess judging from the show it's unlikely they'd just keep quiet and give her a pass. It would be interesting to see these often charming, attractive, seemingly ""innocent"" mob wives suddenly show their true criminal side.  I would have also been interested to see a little more reaction to Ralphie's death/disappearance. I guess I just loved that episode/plot so much, and the idea hinted at by one of the Barese guys about how Tony could be dangerous if he'd whack a big made guy like Ralph over a horse -- maybe it could've developed into a mass-protest against Tony or something. I guess we saw that a little the next season with the Tony B situation, though.  Speaking of Tony B, I am curious what would have happened if he lived -- maybe if he didn't kill Billy and so it wasn't so necessary for the plot for him to die. With Richie and Ralphie, I'm pretty much fine with the way they went out, especially the latter.  I'm curious how the endgame would have played out if Tony's easygoing, post-coma self had continued well into 6B, instead of basically being snuffed out between Johnny Cakes and The Ride (or definitely Soprano Home Movies).  It would have been cool to see even more symbolism/dreams regarding that eerie Colonial-style house that pops up in the end of Calling All Cars, where Tony B dies in All Due Respect, the ghostly coma-mansion in Mayham, and (arguably) Hesh's house at the end of Chasing It and the similar-looking building on the wall of Holsten's behind Tony."

Janice would see an FBI informant right on the periphery of Tony's inner circle as a direct threat to her livelihood. Ro is just old school and would definitely not tolerate that type of betrayal. I don't think that Gabriella would stay quiet either.  Carmella's reaction would be very interesting though."

I know the whole mother-son thing drove the first season or two of the show, but I liked it better when it wasn't so prominent, or when later on Tony was just haunted by ghosts of Livia (Gloria et al) instead of Livia herself. And the possibility of a big courtroom storyline with Livia just sounds... meh."

thesopranos,34krcv,Tricaliotis,5,Mon May 4 15:01:17 2015 UTC,"I think it would have been interesting if the short-lived ""AJ being a gangster"" plot (i.e. where he helps the two Jasons burn that kid's toes) had been introduced a year or two earlier, and AJ got to the point of being really involved in the mob life or just crime the way his father was. Maybe he would have a breakdown from the moral dissonance it caused, similar to what happened after the Somali bicylcist was assaulted. Or maybe he would end up being even more hardhearted than Tony. I like his plot the way it is, but I can't deny it could've been even more interesting -- they didn't give AJ a whole lot to do until Season 6B, really.  Perhaps, though, the reason why the writers didn't have AJ get too far into crime was because they didn't think Iler would be convincing in that role. If they had another child actor who turned out to grow up with a more gangster-like physique, I think AJ would have been a more dynamic, dangerous character potentially."
thesopranos,34krcv,somerton,2,Sat May 2 01:43:36 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing they wanted to have Tony's parenting applying to a son who wouldn't end up in the life.  The whole breakdown he had could be attributed to a lack of identity because his home life was contradictory; he was bought up on morals and values that his parents (especially Tony) never followed.  Still, I agree.  It would have been interesting to see what they could have otherwise done with AJ, though considering that his dad was a mob boss and he was going into the club scene in New York, one could assume that he would have ended up a mob associate of some sort."
thesopranos,34krcv,NeroFiddles,5,Sat May 2 02:05:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, such a great question.  I really liked your takes, especially a feud with the Russians.  Here's what I think could have been cool, let me know what you think:  Picture Tony grooming a new protege after he realizes that Christopher never really seemed to progress to where Tony wanted him to.  So he starts taking an interest in a Benny-type (or even a Jackie Jr type of character but obviously not Jackie Jr).  This new protege starts rising, Tony is proud, others are jealous, especially Christopher.  The new protege gets made, is a fast-rising star.  But he starts to Tony Montana, and the power gets to his own head.  Now Tony doesn't know whether he has a superstar or an enemy in the works.  Protege inevitably lets the power get to his head, thinks he doesn't need to listen to T anymore.  Then we have a new Antagonist for a series.  This would have had to have happened before Phil Leotardo, but after Tony was more established (post Season 1).  Somewhere in the middle.  What do you all think?"

They finally hit on an idea everyone would be happy with: Tony and Christopher pay a visit to the local Russian mob boss, where they find Valery sweeping the floor, not recognizing Christopher thanks to a traumatic brain injury suffered when Chris and Paulie were shooting at him. (It would be explained that a local Boy Scout troop found him with part of his skull missing, and saved his life.)

He doesn't comfort her when she's crying over Bob Wegler, demands that the ""man of the house"" be at his party even though that man hurt his daughter so many times over the years and they are going through a separation, and helps himself to the supplies at the spec house when Carmela has the nerve to spend her time at her comatose husband's bedside instead of sorting things out with the building inspector. Maybe she was physically drawn to Tony because he is Hugh's opposite, but I think Tony and Hugh have some similarities in how they treat Carmela."
thesopranos,34c8tc,yayoyesyou,14,Thu Apr 30 01:36:48 2015 UTC,"I've also wondered about Carmela's choice of husband and how it relates to her father   I think it may be more a play on regular relationships and making the family seem real, it's not super complex.  For a life example, I'm a piece of shit. I bring in good money, I'm nice to a lot of people, but I'm a drunk and got an anger issue. Everyones got problems though, so my exes parents love me. They love me because to them I'm reliable, ex-military, good job, hard working, etc. They never had to fucking live with me. This is normal, in relationships. Whenever you see your spouses parents your on damn good behavior.  Tony was an awesome dude infront of Hugh. Hugh sees Tony as a normal dude. Hugh never had to sit there at 3 am and wonder why his spouse isn't home yet. He doesn't get the pain his daughter is in sometimes.   Hugh loves Tony because he doesn't know shit about him, but he knows bad shit about his daughter. He knows his daughter can be pretentious and entitled (frankly Carm is). He knows his daughter never worked like him and Tony did. So Hugh doesn't know anything bad about Tony, but knows everything his daughter did in her teens and early adulthood. Hugh only understands what's bad about his daughter, he's never seen Tony night in night out. Everyone has a bit of a bias towards those we spend the most time with, and it's not a good bias. I think the show shows it well here."
thesopranos,34c8tc,lefty88,2,Thu Apr 30 07:32:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely. He sees that Tony supports his daughter and their kids, very well I might add, so by the standards that old men generally view a man's value... supporting a family or not, how much you make, and whether you hit his daughter (which there's a shit ton of domestic violence but DV to the old generation is hitting... not emotional or financial, and Tony doesn't do that)... Tony scores high. That's all it comes to."
thesopranos,34c8tc,nidex,2,Thu Apr 30 22:04:50 2015 UTC,"Tony was an awesome dude in front of Hugh. Hugh sees Tony as a normal dude. Hugh never had to sit there at 3 am and wonder why his spouse isn't home yet. He doesn't get the pain his daughter is in sometimes.   Hugh loves Tony because he doesn't know shit about him   Keep in mind that Hugh isn't just some ordinary guy. He might not be in the mob but he's very close to made guys. Junior said that he and Hugh go back to ""when Moses wore short pants"". Also, Hugh's nephew was Dickie Moltisanti (made guy and father of Christopher). People Hugh's age didn't often regard the mob as evil, but heroes of the neighborhood."
thesopranos,34c8tc,armtamz,5,Thu May 7 13:19:21 2015 UTC,"You might be on to something.  And the really interesting thing to add onto that is that her dad absolutely loves Tony, which is a great example of life nullifying or obfuscating whatever involuntary psychological drive that was guiding her."
thesopranos,34c8tc,foggy22,-8,Thu Apr 30 01:10:02 2015 UTC,I don't think that Hugh liking Tony a lot changes the fact of the original question. You clearly missed the point.
thesopranos,34c8tc,foggy22,3,Thu Apr 30 01:12:23 2015 UTC,"My post was building on the premise.  My point is, if she chose a mate  who is the opposite of her dad because she hates her dad, it's ironic that her dad loves the man she chose."
thesopranos,34c8tc,yayoyesyou,-7,Thu Apr 30 01:22:51 2015 UTC,"Hugh just likes Tony because he prepares NY-style sausages when BBQing, it's not like he loves him as a son-in-law."
thesopranos,34c8tc,yayoyesyou,4,Thu Apr 30 01:53:42 2015 UTC,I think Hugh does love Tony like a son in law. When he found out Tony wasn't coming to the party he seemed genuinely upset. I think he loves being connected to Tony and having a man's man in the family who can throw a few building contracts his way once in a while.
thesopranos,34c8tc,boogersonsteve,-2,Thu Apr 30 03:06:22 2015 UTC,"Hugh seemed upset because no BBQ with Tony would have been a bummer. I agree he liked Tony, but in a very superficial way.   And then Tony showed up singing that magnificent sausage-inspired rendering of ""Happy Birthday"" and that made Hugh's day."
thesopranos,34c8tc,Skorpazoid,3,Thu Apr 30 03:10:50 2015 UTC,"He was upset enough to want to cancel his 75th birthday party if Tony didn't show, which suggests to me a strong connection based on more than Tony's bbq skills. I think he loves Tony, or at least what Tony can do for him. And he probably wanted to show off his mob boss son in law to his friends."
thesopranos,34c8tc,FieldsOfUnJustice,-4,Thu Apr 30 03:25:27 2015 UTC,"... something that Carmela's mother, on the other hand, detested. I really disliked the old hag btw, especially when she felt so embarrased in front of her snotty diplomat friends in that same scene.  Also, I'm really worried about your downvotes. I already cut my veins because of them & I'm writing this and subsequent responses from Hell. Tony Blundetto says hello."
thesopranos,34c8tc,FieldsOfUnJustice,2,Thu Apr 30 03:28:15 2015 UTC,"it really seems as if you've made a disagreement where there was none. dude was expanding on your point, nobody is saying you are wrong."
thesopranos,34atsl,harmonicamike,18,Wed Apr 29 17:54:17 2015 UTC,"Great observations, and I think it speaks to tendencies we're all capable of. We all want to maintain meaning in life - and with someone like Paulie, who's sense of identity and meaning is so wrapped up in his heritage, a trip to Italy should've been incredibly affirming for him. And when reality doesn't quite square with the idealistic visions we carry around, we'll work hard to maintain the illusion. We'll force ourselves to like things we probably don't deep down; we'll suppress the unfavorable aspects and talk up what good we can find, because walking around with rose-tinted glasses is a lot easier than confronting true disappointment and reassessing what matters to us.  Like I said, it's something we all do. It could happen with friends that you don't really like, but it's easier to keep them around. Or when you go to see a movie you were really looking forward to, and even if it disappoints you, you'll still try to maintain your excitement over it. Shit like that."
thesopranos,34atsl,UniversalPolymath,2,Wed Apr 29 19:48:33 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, spot on all around.   I guess you can never go home again. The movie you've been looking forward to, and the disappointment is a real downer, so you put on a mask. I can't imagine your entire identity being shaken like that, and you have to just put on a smile and pretend. I get the feeling that the delusion is so set that he doesn't realize he's kidding himself."
thesopranos,34atsl,sithknight1,12,Wed Apr 29 22:52:35 2015 UTC,"That was a spot on analysis. This is why I love reddit. Where people obsess about the same things I obsess and even years after the show ended, someone still can dissect a scene of my favorite show like this, and make me think about things I never noticed before."
thesopranos,34atsl,sithknight1,16,Thu Apr 30 00:40:40 2015 UTC,"I just discovered this subreddit a few weeks ago, and I have to say, I am seriously impressed by the topics STILL being brought up on a daily basis - 8 years after the season finale, and sometimes 16 years after a certain episode.  I don't see this in Breaking Bad or Mad Men or any of the other amazing shows. There, it's discussion during the season, and then ""Look at this cake I made with meth candy!"" or ""Remember the Janitor that cleaned up Walt's vomit after chemo? I saw him at the bus station today!""  Seriously, this site rocks, and keep it up."

thesopranos,34atsl,ehehe,5,Thu Apr 30 02:38:46 2015 UTC,I had to unsub from the BB subreddit for that very reason. Nobody was interested in analysis and worse would make fun of those who were. How else can you enjoy a work of art besides peeling back the layers to see how the artists made the piece? Its not like there will ever be new episodes....
thesopranos,34atsl,thisishardcore_,7,Thu Apr 30 03:06:51 2015 UTC,"Sopranos deals in theme and the human psyche, while BB is really just a gradual unveiling of a unique and grand plot. Don't misunderstand me, I liked both shows, but Breaking Bad's examination of character was MUCH more superficial and linear (Walt will go to greater lengths than a few episodes ago)  and leaves the viewer asking ""what plot event will happen next?""   Sopranos deals primarily in exploring how we experience significant things in life (death, finding purpose, assigning meaning to things, why we care for others.) After each episode, the viewer is left thinking about why characters felt the way they did, and why they've done similar things for similar reasons before... Whereas with BB, all the characters have pretty much one motivation, and all the viewer is curious about is what unexpected event may happen next. After the shows have ended, the one that makes you reflect about your own life has staying power. The one that initially kept you curious about the plot loses its thoughtfulness once the story is complete."
thesopranos,34atsl,thisishardcore_,6,Fri May 1 09:01:30 2015 UTC,"Breaking Bad was my gateway to US television drama, and when I watched it for the first time, I was thinking ""this is so cleverly written! Vince Gilligan is so intelligent!""  However, it turned me onto HBO shows like The Wire, Game Of Thrones and, of course, The Sopranos (not finished it yet though!), and those are all so much more subtle and layered compared to Breaking Bad. I realised this even more when I rewatched Breaking Bad and the big shocking moments just didn't feel the same. Shows like The Sopranos, I can tell, have more replay value because there's bound to be loads of stuff the viewer didn't pick up on the first time around. There was nothing on my second viewing of Breaking Bad that I wasn't already aware of during my first.  Breaking Bad is like that band you become passionate about when you're about 12 or 13 and starting to get into music. You'll always love them, and they'll always have a place in your heart, but you just move onto better acts."
thesopranos,34atsl,ROBFIA,2,Sat May 2 13:15:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, the only way to get loads of upvotes on the Breaking Bad subreddit is to either post a Photoshopped poster of another film with Walt and Jesse superimposed on it, or post a drawing of Heisenberg, or simply comment on how hot Skyler/Marie/Lydia is.  That's why I like reading this subreddit and the one for The Wire. Because neither have much circlejerk-y stuff going on and the posts are actually interesting to read. When I go on a TV show's subreddit, I want to read and discuss theories about a show. I don't want to read about how someone briefly spoke to Dean Norris in a supermarket for about a minute before taking a picture of them together."

thesopranos,34atsl,itisisntit123,8,Sun May 3 02:09:42 2015 UTC,"I think it may be common among Italian Americans. We identify in our background and traditions but we are not like Italians in Italy at all, which many who haven't visited may fail to realize. To Italians, we're just Americans, and we're not going to be treated special because our grandmothers came from Italy 50 years ago.  Also, they visited Napoli, which is in itself the biggest disappointment in Italy."
thesopranos,34atsl,whats_the_deal22,14,Wed Apr 29 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"I remember Furio coming back from his father's funeral in Naples, the car ride back home, he's looking at used car lots, power lines, burger kings, forests of tiny american flags, and you can just tell he's miserable. He just came back from Naples for God's sakes. Fruit trees and villas and amazing food and HOME! Now strip malls and tattoo parlors. What a transition."
thesopranos,34atsl,garden-of-sound,4,Wed Apr 29 22:43:13 2015 UTC,Well he also mentioned earlier to Carmella that he didn't feel like he belonged in Italy either.

I had that exact car ride.   Nothing really compares to the beauty and simplicity in Italy. Of all places to come back to, Jersey is the least aesthetically pleasing."
thesopranos,34atsl,BrainOfG,6,Thu Apr 30 13:30:46 2015 UTC,Very true; the Detroit of Italy.
thesopranos,34atsl,mikey420,2,Wed Apr 29 20:42:34 2015 UTC,"This is why I love this show, always making a point about a statement and how that statement is flaw by the character's actions. They are proud of their roots, they don't waste any chance to make it clear, however they are ignorants on the matter, they don't really know history nor art, the whole idealized Italy comes from social hype promoted by themselves, they are not interested on know the real Italy, in this case Paulie is looking for confirmation bias all over. This is funny to watch, reminds me of Christopher and his ""talent"" for writting and later on the show spot how he really knows nothing about it."
thesopranos,34atsl,itisisntit123,2,Thu Apr 30 13:12:36 2015 UTC,"The episode comes back to me quite often do I appreciate your thoughts here. The show to me always captured the American immigrant experience so well especially of the 2nd and 3rd generations we see so much of with the main characters.  This episode - especially with Paulie - takes that and tilts it in a different direction.    There are so many little moments in this episode.  Tony talking about the crickets in Don Ciccio's villa, the use of Con te Partiro throughout, Major-a-Deegan-Expressaway, the hysterical ""fucking nosy! Eat your managot!"" There's so much good stuff there but the Paulie stuff is just so tonaly perfect and true to his character."
thesopranos,34atsl,mikey420,2,Mon May 4 00:20:29 2015 UTC,Paulie holds himself to this stereotypical image of Italy but in reality he is nothing but a stereotype himself.
thesopranos,34atsl,itisisntit123,-1,Mon May 4 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"like most sociopaths he's a bit of a hypocrite?  wants what he can't have?  i love him to death still though, him and Sil are probably my favorite characters"
thesopranos,34bqfu,MotorboatingSofaB,21,Wed Apr 29 21:46:52 2015 UTC,New York would have probably put their own guy in charge of Jersey operations.
thesopranos,34bqfu,Mixographer,8,Wed Apr 29 22:21:39 2015 UTC,"From what I've gathered, the DeCavalcante family, which the Dimeo family is loosely based on, is today more or less the NJ office of the Gambino family (inspiration for the Lupertazzi family), and we know that real life events have inspired events on the show (boss in prison, acting boss gets cancer etc), so that could be something Chase had in mind. But who knows?"
thesopranos,34bqfu,MadBigMadBoatMan,9,Thu Apr 30 14:01:35 2015 UTC,Jersey probably would've dissolved.
thesopranos,34bqfu,Charlescampion,3,Wed Apr 29 22:56:09 2015 UTC,"You're probably right.  Once Tony dies, those ""long standing ties"" with New York would just go away.  Nobody else on Tony's crew had those ties.  Pauly, maybe.  Nobody in NY ever saw Paulie as a big dog though."
thesopranos,34bqfu,Ltsmash99,5,Thu Apr 30 00:16:22 2015 UTC,"As far as I remember Albert ""the parakeet"" Barese wasn't harmed during the final war against NY. He was young, had some sort of muscle and family reputation through his older cousin Larry, and was clever enough not to expose his own crew that much in front of the CN and public scrutiny.  I don't quite recall what happened to him at the end of the series (I'm on season 6 part 1 again after a lot of years I hadn't rewatch the series) but I guess he would have been an option if NY hadn't take complete control of NJ at the end (keep in mind that NY was badly damaged from the war as well with Johnny Sack and Phil Leotardo both dead)"
thesopranos,34bqfu,quidpronihilo,2,Thu Apr 30 00:21:55 2015 UTC,"The parakeet flew the coop in season five, last seen in The Rat Pack."
thesopranos,34bqfu,boblordofevil,3,Thu Apr 30 00:46:32 2015 UTC,"I don't recall him becoming a rat, he just simply vanished from the show and no mention from the Barese crew is made afterwards, strange."

thesopranos,34bqfu,boblordofevil,2,Thu Apr 30 05:09:18 2015 UTC,They would just get absorbed by New York
thesopranos,34bqfu,_Woodrow_,2,Thu Apr 30 16:20:05 2015 UTC,"If say, Tony died after he was shot by Uncle Junior, probably either Sil or Bobby.  Sil was a competent leader but couldn't handle the stress and Bobby seemed to be coming into his own by then, though I don't think he was as close to Tony at that point as afterwards and wasn't even an official captain at that point (he was acting captain of Junior's crew) so he probably wouldn't have been in line to lead the family.  Obviously, Chris was always the one officially groomed for the position but considering his drug addiction, hot-headedness, and being promoted real fast that the behest of others who thought they deserved better, I don't think he would have lasted long.  Sil or Patsy would have probably gotten him clipped.  A third choice could have been Vito since he was the best earner in the family at the time and had ties to New York through Phil.  But he was resented by a lot of upper management and, if that didn't do him in, his homosexuality would have come out eventually and caused his death.  If this was after the final episode, probably Paulie, but I don't think he would have lasted long.  The family as it was was pretty much dead.  All of the capos besides Paulie were either dead or in prison, the underboss was dead, and the consigliere was in a coma.  So I suppose, if Paulie was made boss, Patsy would be promoted to captain along with maybe Benny.  He probably make Little Paulie and groom him for underboss or something like that because he was pretty much the only guy close to Paulie in the whole group of available people."
thesopranos,34bqfu,itisisntit123,1 point,Fri May 1 04:05:09 2015 UTC,"Didn´t Tony tell Janice he would cut Bobby out of the business, for implying Tony had a responsibility for Juniors finances?"
thesopranos,34bqfu,MadBigMadBoatMan,1 point,Fri May 1 07:24:58 2015 UTC,"When?  I remember him talking about cutting Bobby off the episode he was murdered but I think it was just him being an asshole to Janice.  I don't think Bobby got moved up to official captain until after the episode at the vacation house, so I don't think he had standing to take over the family while Tony was in a coma.  He would have definitely been given the reigns after the vacation house episode now because Bobby was being groomed for the #2 spot in place of Christopher as Tony started to resent Christopher more and more after his film premiere."
thesopranos,34bqfu,itisisntit123,3,Fri May 1 22:57:55 2015 UTC,"They'd put in Paulie because he's waited a long time to take the reins, he's open to talking, and maintains status quo."
thesopranos,34bqfu,boblordofevil,6,Thu Apr 30 00:48:16 2015 UTC,Don't think so. One way he got by all these years was by not being in the lime light. he wouldn't want the job.
thesopranos,34bqfu,shivalingum,3,Thu Apr 30 04:38:53 2015 UTC,"Well, he seems to want it enough to betray Tony in season four."
thesopranos,34bqfu,boblordofevil,3,Thu Apr 30 05:08:10 2015 UTC,"Mhm, it's been a while when I watched this show so I dont really remember that. When I saw the question the first person that came to my mind also was Paulie, but then the scene where he was explaining why he survived all the former shootings came to my mind.   Just reading over some of the comments I do think that a NY affiliate would probably go down to take over."
thesopranos,34bqfu,shivalingum,3,Thu Apr 30 05:10:51 2015 UTC,"I dont really remember that   Paulie was selling out the Dimeo family to Johnny Sack because he felt undervalued and there came a point when Johnny talked about having to remove Tony and put someone else in his place (this was over the housing scams that Tony etc were running, and they were not splitting with NY). Paulie got the notion that he would be ""the guy"" if that should happen. Johnny was completely playing Paulie, but Paulie showed what a weak person he truly is with his involvement."
thesopranos,34bqfu,Seventh7Sun,2,Thu Apr 30 15:52:46 2015 UTC,They might but that would go bad. NJ people would be ready for the mattresses and an outsider trying to run things could lead to more war.

thesopranos,3484qm,avoritz,3,Wed Apr 29 09:06:29 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a great scene, but it definitely didn't match the tone of the rest of the series.  The music; he usually chose music he felt Tony's generation would have listened to in their youth.  So while it wasn't one of the usual rock ballads, it could have been something he was exposed to from his mother/father.  I think it might have also been a nod to Scorsese who, among being one of the directors who brought non-scored soundtracks to the mainstream audience, used a lot of '40s and '50s music in his mob flicks."
thesopranos,3484qm,itisisntit123,2,Fri May 1 04:13:17 2015 UTC,Interesting. That makes sense that it was one of those 'pilot errors' (shit pun intended) that get corrected in the series proper.

Of course this is also counterbalanced by his great physical degradation: the heavy breathing, the endless food/weight gain, the smoking and drinking and occasional drugs (I wonder how often Tony did cocaine? Irregular Around the Margins is the only time we see him do it, but he seems pretty nonchalant and familiar with it. Obviously he's a fictional character, but theoretically speaking I'm curious).

thesopranos,347zve,somerton,13,Wed Apr 29 04:30:45 2015 UTC,"I think this has already been discussed in this reddit, but good observation nonetheless. The guy won a lot of weight (too much gabbagool!) and some redditors suggest that James Gandolfini basically let Tony Soprano evolve on his own, even risking his own physical health (R.I.P.), Think of all the food, cigar-smoking (notice Tony's cigar consumption increases a lot throughout the series) and booze he started to consume, in order to let Tony evolve ""physically"" as a character.  So Tony, as it has been discussed here, basically became a parody of himself, a cartoonish, semi-grotesque version of his original personality, even though he really tried to redeem himself, i.e. being faithful to Carmela after some profound death-life borderline experiences (no spoilers here!)  So yeah, good observation. It's funny that you mention that he almost seems like he lost ""brightness"". He was still a very intelligent strategist, but his soul was getting dimmer and dimmer out of greed in the final seasons."

thesopranos,347o92,footballisnotsoccer,3,Wed Apr 29 12:04:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Tony spends the whole series demonizing his mother, while pretending his father was some sort of hero. Let's be honest, Livia was an absolute horror of a mother, but Tony seems to ignore the fact that Johnny Boy Soprano wasn't a great guy. He let Tony get emotionally abused by Livia. He cheated on Livia and was MIA when Livia miscarried the change-of-life baby. He put Tony in the terrible position of lying to Livia about his whereabouts while she miscarried. He gave away Tony's dog to Fran and her son and lied about it.   This episode was the first time Tony was confronted with the fact that his father was a huge piece of shit too, and isn't the kind of person that Tony should be modeling his behavior after. Tony goes from being impressed by Fran and being bizarrely proud of his father having such a classy goomah, to realizing that Fran was just looking for handout and Johnny helped contribute to the shittiness of Tony's childhood."

If you recall, in the episode, Tony says to Dr. Melfi that it was weird for him to be at the grave of his mother with his father's mistress. I got the impression also, that there was some idea of him being attracted to her but then also repulsed by her. The same way that he loved his mother but hated her as well."

He has proven himself capable of bending or flat out breaking silent codes of the Mafia.  Tony justifies his atrocities and betrayals by any means necessary for himself, his family/associates; and doesn't acknowledge their existence to most of the world.  Emotional highs achieved through sex, gambling, drugs, and violent crime give him fleeting gratification.  Most of the time he is time he is sad, tired, and dissatisfied with himself and others.  To pull out of his funk, perpetuates the cycle.  In the time after his realization in the desert, Tony can't remember much beyond a metaphor about a bus and mothers.  Real change for peace, happiness, and sometimes health requires mindfulness, concentration, and application of thought.    TLDR: I figure whatever Tony realized in the desert was not in the spirit of self-rectification.  He was seeking vindication for killing Chris while reveling in his good fortune and wealth."

If he had gotten his wish and turned the Pilot into a film, there'd be no continuity issue. But Chris Albrecht and HBO made him go forward and turn it into a TV show, so fuck fuck fuck, I guess I have to stretch this thing. So he changes this major detail between episode one and two and NOBODY NOTICES. Which, I guess for Chase, is typical of TV watchers.  He does this numerous times as the show progresses, using retroactive continuity to undermine serious narrative threads. This ties into themes of alternate realities and one of the most pertinent theme of the series, ambiguity and lack of clear definition. I will likely be downvoted to oblivion for this, but I think it is clear David Chase enjoyed subverting his text almost as much as he loved developing intricate plots."

Season Four- Christopher now never knew his father, once a sage who gave advice and prophetic dream warnings, now dead carrying a crib home for Chris to sleep in (ok tv trays).  Season Five- Vito (who was once Gino) is now secretly gay, Barbara recast, Tony B introduced as very important.  Season Six- Vito and Phil are now cousins, Walden introduced as a regular (minimal retroactive continuity, but also the strongest arguments for alternate realities).  Missing many, I am sure."
thesopranos,340eeo,boblordofevil,3,Wed Apr 29 18:16:11 2015 UTC,"Some of these aren't necessarily continuity issues.  I don't recall Livia ever being friends with Carmela's parents, and Livia's house was on the market but then taken off the market by Tony after her ""stroke.""  Ralph was in Florida before his arrival, though they could have done a much better job introducing him.  Vito was in the closet for most of his role.  You only saw him around strippers/hookers when the others guys were there which could have been a put on to save face.  Walden could have made it into Tony's inner circle during the break between seasons.  Tony B was in prison beforehand, though considering his importance to Tony, you could argue that he should have been mentioned in passing before his introduction.  I also don't recall Chris ever mentioning explicitly that he knew his father before season 4.  I upvoted your post though because it made me think."
thesopranos,340eeo,itisisntit123,2,Fri May 1 23:10:08 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your skepticism. Allow me to illuminate.  CARMELA'S PARENTS  Seasone One, Episode Two TONY(to Meadow): What time's your grandma(Livia) gettin' here?  CARMELA: She had to drive fanny to the doctors. Then she is picking up my mother and father, and they're comin' here.  Season Two, Episode One CARMELA: You said you were happy janice was home. And my parents are coming. TONY: Oh, really? What, now that the dragon lady's gone, they'll step foot in our house?  CARMELA: She said some horrible things to them over the years.  THE HOUSE Season One, Episode Eleven TONY: I wanted to tell her her house went into escrow. TONY(later): No, just, uh, tell her her house sold, and they accepted the counteroffer.  LIVIA: Well, he sold our house. JUNIOR: Don't people have names anymore? Who's ""he""?  LIVIA: Anthony. He sold my house-- the home that my husband and i made!  JUNIOR: What else were they gonna do with it?  LIVIA: You too? Hey! I suppose he would've found it harder to have his meetings at my house than in this nursing home.  Season Two, Episode One JANICE: Then I'll take her home to Seattle. Maybe, stay at her house here temporarily. TONY: Oh, I doubt that. I just put her house on the market.  Quick note on Vito, in Whitecaps, he was making inappropriate phone calls to Adrianna. Not a total dissonance for a character who was once another character, that went from gambler and construction worker to captain in four seasons.  Walden appears mid season six part two, around the time Christopher dies. He just shows up in Tony's bedroom in Kennedy and Heidi.  Some of my favorite dialogue...  Season Five, Episode Two JANICE: And guys, this is your Uncle Tony Blundetto. TONY B: Hey, there. BOBBY JR: How come we never met you before?  TONY B: I've been away on business. BOBBY JR: I've never even heard of you.  This is a great example of the show poking fun at itself.  And now the big one: CHRISTOPHER'S DAD Season One, Episode Ten CHRISTOPHER: Original gangster, not him, fuckin' lawn jockey. And he's got the fly Hamptons house, Alec Baldwin comes over, Whitney Houston-- what do I got? I sit in the fucking pork store, for christ sake. But the moolies, they got it goin' on, and they're on tv. ADRIANNA: They don't take no shit. CHRISTOPHER: Soprano crew, it's always ""secret this, omertathat."" Fuckin' gets on my nerves. Junior, with his moldy old sweaters, and he's a fuckin' boss. ADRIANNA: And you were just feeling so good about yourself. CHRISTOPHER: Our thing once ruled the music business.Did you know that?  ADRIANNA: No. CHRISTOPHER: We bankrolled acts. Blacks, everybody. Paid the deejays or busted heads to get em' played on the air. ADRIANNA: There was some great Italian singers. CHRISTOPHER: Fuckin' a. Frankie valli. Dion. The Rascals. That whole Philly thing. My dad used to talk about those guys.  Talk about a clear example of Chris learning from his father! His citing the mafia's influence on the music industry infers that his father was the one who taught him. There's one more major reference to Chris's dad, but I'll let you find that for yourself.  Here's the contradiction.  Season Four, Episode One TONY: See over there? Guy in there killed your father. CHRISTOPHER: What the fuck are you talking about?  TONY: Barry Haydu. Detective Lieutenant in the Clifton Police Force. Retired today. That's his retirement party. CHRISTOPHER: Everybody always told me it was a fucking cop. I thought he was dead. My mother can't even talk about it. TONY: Did the hit for Jilly Ruffalo. Him and your old man were in the can together. Jilly stabbed your old man's cellmate to death. So, when your old man got paroled, he tracked down Jilly. Took out his eye so bad, he couldn't even put a glass one in. Loyal, your old man. CHRISTOPHER: That's what I heard. Some guy's eye. They hit my dad right outside my house, right? - He was bringing home a crib for me?  TONY: Yeah. Well, no He was outside the house, but he wasn't carrying a crib. He had a bunch of TV trays. Could've been a crib just as easily."
thesopranos,340eeo,boblordofevil,1 point,Sat May 2 00:09:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insights, though asking what time the grandmother was getting there doesn't mean they liked the grandmother.  Chris saying that his dad used to talk about that all the time doesn't mean he knew his dad.  Tony told Chris a lot of stories about his dad.  He could have heard about those things second hand from Tony.  The other stuff, you're absolutely right.  Also lol @ ""allow me to illuminate.""  One of the bigger continuity issues was that Adriana was apparently niece of Richie which means she was Jackie Jr's cousin, and yet he was starring her up at Visuvios."
thesopranos,340eeo,itisisntit123,2,Sat May 2 00:25:20 2015 UTC,Oh I forgot my favorite retcon; the Orwellian removal of Faruiza Balk in the character of 'Danielle.' You can't even find a picture of Balk in the role.
thesopranos,340eeo,boblordofevil,3,Wed Apr 29 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"Strict continuity didn't used to be a big thing in television. Old shows used to write out long-lasting characters and ignore their existence in the future (Chuck Cunningham). They used to completely re-cast important characters in the middle of a show's run (Aunt Viv on Fresh Prince, Becky on Roseanne). They'd have a character show up in one episode that we'd never heard of before, but he or she is all of a sudden very important to the show's universe or plot (numerous Star Trek characters), and next episode he goes back to never being heard of again.   So yeah, while The Sopranos broke new ground in TV for its continuity (constantly referencing the pilot episode, for instance), it wasn't very strict about relying on what happened in the past. Before David Chase was creator of The Sopranos, he was a long-standing member of the old guard of television (he was in his 50s by the time he created The Sopranos), and while he had his issues with the television industry, he was at first working within a system that had been around for a while. Then, once he had the show and was given free reign to make the first season, he set about undermining and deconstructing the existing system of producing television. It was probably just easier to market and sell a pilot episode about a mob boss dealing with his two ""families"" that give him constant agita than a show about a mid-level mobster that rises to the level of boss over the course of a season."
thesopranos,340eeo,rocketsauce2112,3,Mon Apr 27 21:51:47 2015 UTC,"I think continuity tried to be bridged by making Tony basically the acting boss to the acting boss (since Jackie was too ill to run things at this point) because he was the most powerful capo in the family, but yeah, I think he was boss in episode one.    There was some other continuity issues too, like Sil showing up at Satriale's and being surprised that Tony and the gang were hanging out there (seeing as this is supposed to be one of the main hangouts for the Soprano crew years before, as evidenced by the Christmas flashback), and Sil not really knowing who Artie was even though both Sil and Artie were close childhood friends of Tony.  They also used a lot of voice over work which was very Scorsese-esc, and that was a thematic element that was never used again after the pilot."
thesopranos,340eeo,itisisntit123,2,Wed Apr 29 00:43:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if it was in the pilot but Tony said he was already a bigger success than his Dad.  But the real leader was one of the DiMeo family members, they said in one of the later seasons he was locked up for life, and Jackie was the acting boss."
thesopranos,340eeo,Lanlodger,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:35:17 2015 UTC,"Though that may imply he was a bigger success because he was boss, it could also imply that he was a bigger success because:  He got made very young, he became a captain fairly young, he was the most powerful captain in the family by the mid-90s, and he made a ton more money than his father ever did (which is why he lives in a mansion while still a captain)."
thesopranos,340eeo,itisisntit123,2,Fri May 1 23:12:46 2015 UTC,"From my understanding The real boss is in jail, jackie is acting boss but is ill so Tone is acting boss...  Is the REAL boss ever mentioned in the show, whats his name? Why was he in jail, did he still try to do business from the can, did he die? did Tony ever officially become boss? If so what season and episode? Or was he always acting boss till the very end?"

thesopranos,340eeo,dxgxnxratx315,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:00:48 2015 UTC,"The boss of the family was identified pretty much by name only as Ercole DiMeo, but the series didn't really offer any details about his life. As the long-time boss of the family, I'm sure his conviction was based on numerous RICO predicates, rather than any one thing in particular.  As far as at what point Tony became the ""official"" boss of the family, rather than just the second (or third, if you count Junior) acting boss, I have no idea how that works."
thesopranos,340eeo,UniversalPolymath,2,Mon Apr 27 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"No, he wasn't the official boss. Jackie was sick at the time and Tony was essentially the acting boss, even though he was just a capo. Everyone around him knew that Tony was the boss but he was never truly the actual boss at the time. He eventually becomes the underboss when they make Junior out to be the ""boss"" in title only to divert attention away from Tony. However this incenses Junior to the point of conspiring with Livia to whack Tony."
thesopranos,340eeo,BrainOfG,1 point,Mon Apr 27 12:24:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think Tony was ever an underboss.  Joseph Sasso was underboss up until he got arrested by the FBI along with Junior.  After that, Tony became street boss because he was next in line after Sasso and Mikey P (who had been murdered by that point).  So Tony was still technically a captain until that point but because he had the backing of every other captain in the family, Junior was an unsuspecting figurehead as was his underboss."
thesopranos,340eeo,itisisntit123,0,Fri May 1 23:15:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. He's the boss of the family in the first episode nominally and functionally, after the first episode they retcon it to where he is only functionally the boss."
thesopranos,33yphv,jersey_wiseguy,11,Sun Apr 26 22:11:15 2015 UTC,"This episode is one of my favorite more underrated ones, and I actually really enjoy the AJ storyline. As per usual with AJ, the writers really nail what it's like to be that age, the stupid things you say and do and just how awkward it all is. Great Paul Dano cameo also, as the wannabe-ladies man: ""You gotta poke the perimeter, tap on the gate til she's out of her fuckin mind, begging. Then you own that shit."" And I love how AJ goes all the way to the Bronx to ask Meadow if he can have sex in her room. The fuck did he expect?  I think Michael Imperioli gets a bad rap as a writer, maybe; between this episode, Marco Polo, and the amazing From Here to Eternity, he's written some classics (The Telltale Moozadell is very good, too). All these episodes very much blend in in Sopranos-world, and it feels like he knows the characters well. It's only the infamous episode Christopher which is a failure and feels out-of-character (and that was co-written with someone else, IIRC, which may have been part of the problem)."
thesopranos,33yphv,somerton,3,Sun Apr 26 23:09:03 2015 UTC,"Imperioli's interesting. He's definitely written some good ones. From Where to Eternity is a season two highlight, and Marco Polo's really solid as well.   But in addition to Christopher being every bit as weak as it's made out to be - and there's no co-writing credit on that one, by the way - I really hate the scene that lent itself to the title of The Telltale Moozadell. That scene where the cops go to interrogate a couple of over-the-top pizza shop owners (""My pizza never-a hurt nobody"" - ugh) was so silly and out of place.  Ultimately though, these complaints fall on Chase as well, who had a hand in every script."
thesopranos,33yphv,UniversalPolymath,3,Mon Apr 27 05:10:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that pizza scene is a bit tonally uncharacteristic of the show, but I kind of like it. I think the whole source of the humor is just in having these Dragnet-type cops being forced into such an absurd situation. The rest of the episode is quite good, too, if not one of the best of the season."
thesopranos,33yphv,somerton,2,Mon Apr 27 07:13:18 2015 UTC,"i think that pizza scene is parodying a movie scene, but i cant remember which movie."

thesopranos,33x9f9,Calikola,14,Fri May 1 13:21:24 2015 UTC,One of my favorite scenes showing Tony's sadism and inability to let people rise above him... He knew Janice was improving and he hated that.
thesopranos,33x9f9,paradoxasauruser,12,Sun Apr 26 18:30:00 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite scenes, for several reasons. Tony just wants to antagonize Janet and assert is dominance in the family. Then, he tries to justify why he's upset like saying ""I'm the boys uncle"", when in reality he could care less. He threw her under the bus and made sure Bobby knew her shortfalls.   He leaves and that song ""I'm not like everyone else"" and him waking down a typical suburban street gives me chills to this day. And, in classic Chase style the blowing roadies line is hysterical."

There was no reason for Tony to go at Janice like that, and to reveal that information in front of Bobby's kids. While Janice was the bane of Tony's existence, I think he liked having her around because he could feel superior to her. In this scene, he didn't like that she was trying to be a better person. He wanted to prove that he could bring her back down to his level."

I love how Tony gets his revenge on her here. Us Italians...we never fuckin forget...even if its our own family....we will never fuckin forget!  How come nobody here has anything to say for that lost child she made and never really even cared about. Tony speaks up about what a disgrace and a shame all the things she does...has done...and keeps on getting away with are!!!  This is one of my favorite scenes!       The cunts character in this show is and always was that of ""The Predator in the home"" and the whole point of the character (and the many scenarios presented in this show)  is to show that predators and abusers can be woman too!!!!! As a matter of fact now a days...most of the predators and abusers ARE WOMEN!!!!"
thesopranos,33x9f9,Calikola,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:09:44 2015 UTC,"You're insane if you think Tony gave a single shit about Harpo. For all his bluster about being the boy's uncle, did he ever do anything to find Harpo? To get him off the streets? He forgot about Harpo the second he walked out of that house, and only ever brought him up when he wanted to stick it to Janice. Tony gave just as much of a shit about Harpo as Janice did- probably less actually.   This scene was all about Tony being resentful of the fact that Janice was making progress in anger management, and wanting to bring her back down to his level. There is a major theme in the series of Tony enjoying taking shots at Janice and Bobby. It all goes back to Tony having unresolved anger towards Janice for taking off and leaving the family when she became an adult, and leaving Tony and Barbara to deal with Livia.   Don't get me wrong, Janice is a despicable person, but Tony is no better. He's not some hero in this scene. Both he and Janice are just like Livia- they love to surround themselves in misery and comfort themselves with other's failings."

Sometimes very raw and personal ways between family menbers who actually LIVED THROUGHOUT the fuckin crazy 1960's and 70's and 80's.  Women can be very abusive too in familys. Psychologically abusive and verbally abusive and maniacal! So Why should Janice keep her happiness? Why shouldent Tony get even and push the butten that will get her going like she undoubtedly did to him growing up? Thats what the scene shows and IDK about anyone else but I know I root for Tony.

The world of The Sopranos is a deeply deterministic world where the die has been cast for all of the characters long before they were ever even aware of the one-way roads they found themselves on. In short, Tony Soprano had no choice but to be Tony Soprano.  But Breaking Bad presents a universe where all of the characters exhibit a wide range of free choice, and those choices have huge consequences. Those choices allow for a huge range of change and development for each of the major players. Some characters grow far worse, and some kind of actually redeem themselves for the better. But what is consistent throughout is the feeling that Walter White could've always chosen a different path than the one he takes, but he makes a conscious decision to march toward total and utter moral depravity anyway. Walt had every opportunity before him, but Tony never had a chance."

thesopranos,33sv9m,315MhmmFruitBarrels,10,Sat Apr 25 08:00:14 2015 UTC,It was FBI not DEA wasn't it?
thesopranos,33sv9m,MicOxlong,9,Sat Apr 25 13:14:05 2015 UTC,Agent harris knew that the new jersey mob never could be completely eradicated. Better to stick with the devil you know.

thesopranos,33sv9m,resoooo,4,Sat Apr 25 09:36:54 2015 UTC,"It all started with his very first scene.  He calmly explained to Tony what was going on and showed respect for his family.  His reaction to Grasso when he breaks the dish after being in the fridge probably helped, too.  They don't find anything in the house, so, in the moment he sees a family and not a crime boss.  He even says ""We'll be out of here in a few minutes"" in an almost apologetic tone.  He knows no matter what he does, there's no end to the crime, so he picks the one person he respects the most.  No matter how much Tony hates authority and the idea of going to jail, he respects him because he knows that the guy is doing his job and it's not personal."
thesopranos,33sv9m,MagicRat87,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:05:56 2015 UTC,I also think it's a personal thing. They share a mutual respect. Agent Harris also says in one scene in Satriales that he doesn't like Phil Leotardo since he tried to setup a rape and beating of a female colleague when he was a rookie. Tony also seems appalled when he says it.

Shieeeet he was willing to write a letter to the judge that would significantly drop his sentence if he got those two terrorist Chris knew. Mid life crisis him cheating on his wife (Harris) . Why not? He probably helped him not caring if he got caught or not. Aiding in pre meditated murder, which he gave phils location is a huge line to cross as an FBI agent.

He says something about Chris getting a bit Napoleon like, to which Tony says 'good'.  Silvio has been there since the old days, and at some level still sees Tony as a kid.

Whereas in season 1, the driving conflict is the tension between Uncle June and Tony over who will succeed Jackie Aprile. In season 4, the show becomes a mix between covering some brief but major incidents and 'open and shut' conflicts. The events of season 4 are important for the future however lack the dynamic flow and building tension which makes the series great.  That being said...I love season 4."

The season swims around in the 'mundane' aspects of these characters' lives, less concerned with big Mafia-related conflicts, and is more interested in interpersonal conflict, or just simply follwing the everyday ins-and-outs of these people.

Lots of shows, for whatever reason, seem to get more reflective, introspective, and possibly more meandering in their fourth year. As a result, these seasons are often the most divisive of the series. For example: The Wire, Six Feet Under, Louie, Breaking Bad, Girls, etc. Hell, even Weeds fits the bill. I haven't yet seen shows like Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire, The Shield and the rest so I can't comment on them but I wonder if anyone else knows what I mean or can back me up here?  I also have noticed that S3 of a lot of shows tends to be the most loose and free-flowing, with less of a solid, discernible narrative center and yet tons of action/plot throughout, almost too much. Breaking Bad and The Sopranos are perfect examples of this, plus Deadwood, The Wire, Six Feet Under, etc. I dunno, I just find this stuff interesting."

The cool thing about GoT is that the intro changes as the story changes. Different towns show different things based on what's happening.  Or maybe I'm just biased. Who knows."
thesopranos,33mz5j,Bkwordguy,2,Fri Apr 24 15:21:59 2015 UTC,"The intros to both Sopranos and GoT serve the same purpose: They introduce you to the character's world. You see all the aspects of northern New Jersey in the early 21st century: The edge of NYC, Newark's urban blight, suburbia, and the more wooded area of North Caldwell (where the family lives).  It's more claustrophobic in scope than GoT, but that's one of the show's key themes. Many of the characters feel trapped by their life choices, their environment, their bad luck, or all three."

How'd you like season one?"
thesopranos,33mz5j,Todd_Solondz,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:36:08 2015 UTC,"Season 1 was pretty good. I think we're hooked enough to finish out the series.  I love the character of Tony. He's a big hard ass, but in the psychiatrist scenes, you seen deeper into him.  His wife is portrayed wonderfully.  She has just enough of a Skyler White (Breaking Bad wife) in her in a sense that she's stuck in a dangerous world, but balances out with scenes where she's a caring mom/wife where she stands behind her family and husbands decisions full heartedly.  Tony's children don't have much development. His daughter has more than his son. The daughter has the potential to be interesting character. The son is mostly just...there.  My wife and I both can't stand Tony's mom.  Not in a sense of ""omg she's trying to kill her son and might faking the memory loss what a bitch"".  More of ""omg this character is so annoying! She complains so much and I hate her voice!"" if that makes sense.  Uncle Junior isn't a very interesting character, but is portrayed very well nonetheless.  We both really like the psychiatrist.  She was kind of annoying at first, but she grew on us.  I really like Christopher, the younger guy.  He seems to have a genuine heart and really wants to help those around him.  Pussy is interesting, but now well developed.   I also really like Paulie.  Out of all the ""miscellaneous gang member"", he's my favorite after Christopher.  The priest annoys us.  He could have been an interesting character, but the pervy quality was a little too on the nose.  Overall, it seems like a really good series.  It feels more like a documentary than a TV show. Like you're a fly on the wall observing a real life story. It doesn't feel like a TV show, but then again, that's what HBO does best.   My biggest complaint about the series: holy crap why is the intro almost 2 minutes long.  Jesus."

Furthermore, if your mother had the same motives that she does, how would that make you feel about yourself?  Her character is really there to inform Tony's character."

thesopranos,33mz5j,shawn_rules,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:21:51 2015 UTC,Season 4 is where everything in the show starts to go from constant action to a more story driven approach (not like the story was bad in 1-3).

The season 4 finale is the best episode of this show or any other, and it's the lowest rated one of all. I'm guessing it used to be highest and people came down on it for whatever reason.  Season 4 is great. Better than 3 IMO and I loved season 3."

thesopranos,33iie9,JamesGumb,3,Wed Apr 22 23:17:52 2015 UTC,who was he and what did he do in the 70s?
thesopranos,33iie9,itisisntit123,17,Thu Apr 23 00:04:46 2015 UTC,"The actor who played Paulie.  Before he became an actor he was an associate of the mafia who shook down various clubs, sold drugs, and had a long rap sheet.  He's rumored to have killed or ordered people killed people and was apparently being considered for his button.  Anyway, he was arrested for shaking down the owner of a gay club.  The sentencing transcript is online; you can probably find it in Google.  He apparently also followed some undercover cops who were tailing him and his guys and scared the shit out of them.  It's in the transcript.  Anyway, he was sent to prison sometime in the '70s I think and gave up the life, saw an ex-convict acting troop and decided to take up acting when he got out of prison.  His brother is, on the other hand, a pretty prominent catholic priest.  EDIT: here's the sentencing transcript if you're interested: http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/sirico-sentencing-transcript"

Paulie tries to defuse the situation by saying that Chrissy must have known he wouldn't hurt Tony after he shot up his car, but Christopher interprets this the wrong way and assumes Paulie's just trying to make fun of him.   You can see a brief moment of hurt and confusion on Paulie's face when Chrissy lashes out at him. Its one of his few redeeming moments on the show."

thesopranos,33fy4y,nofuckinpodcast,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:51:43 2015 UTC,"I think the phrase means a person failing to realise how good they have it. This phrase fits Tony well: he's got a good house, lots of money, a loving (even if dysfunctional) family. Most of his.issues are self created."

thesopranos,33dw6u,UniversalPolymath,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:32:02 2015 UTC,Im pretty sure those are her parents. She does refer to one of them as Dad and I kind of doubt if they were her exes parents she would be calling him Dad while they were divorced.

thesopranos,33er5d,maxkmiller,9,Tue Apr 21 22:47:50 2015 UTC,"The opinions of the characters on the show are obviosly not identital to that of its creators. They are fictional characters, not mouthpieces for the writers' opinions(although this happens too often on other shows.) I could be wrong, but the closest any character probably gets to expressing Chase's opinions in this episode, is at the end, when Tony vents his disgust with those who lean too heavily on a sense of collective identity."
thesopranos,33er5d,nofknziti,6,Tue Apr 21 23:37:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Remember how most of the Mafiosos in the show are also blatantly racist?  That doesn't mean Chase is racist in the least.  Remember that some Italian Americans had an issue with the show too because it revolved around the Mafia...they argued it painted Italian Americans in a bad light.  So it's really six-of-one, half-dozen-of-the-other.  I've also never heard the episode being referred to as ""the worst of the series,"" but if it was, it was probably because it was by in large a boring, filler episode."
thesopranos,33er5d,itisisntit123,2,Wed Apr 22 00:00:28 2015 UTC,"I would go so far as to say Chase is a actively anti racist. Consistently,  he fills the world with doctors, police officers, sales people,  and concierges with a range of ethnicities and religious backgrounds. While the gangsters may flaunt racist points of view, the world they live in is diversified."
thesopranos,33er5d,boblordofevil,0,Wed Apr 22 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"That's why I concluded by saying I hope the audience understands that this episode doesn't reflect the opinions of the writers themselves, but rather the stereotypes that exist in America.  As for the ""worst of the series"" comment, I considered the rating from this site, and from this article, which claims that Christopher is ""the worst episode by SEVERAL DEGREES.""  I have to agree, only because the Native American storyline ends up completely inconsequential and the characters never mention it again. Pointless."

There's no reason for it to be brought up again."
thesopranos,33er5d,smallteam,3,Wed Apr 22 21:32:29 2015 UTC,"I actually liked this episode; while it was self-contained and didn't move the story arc forward, it did help flesh out those undercurrents of racism in our culture.     And for younger (under 40) viewers, ""that prominent Native American actor Iron Eyes Cody... of Italian descent"" played a Native American in many Hollywood films, but was certainly most famous for being in a widely-remembered ""Keep America Beautiful"" anti-pollution public service announcement (PSA) that debuted on the first Earth Day in 1971.  Watch it here     EDIT: OP, for what it's worth, I thought your analysis of this episode was spot-on."
thesopranos,33er5d,nofknziti,3,Fri Apr 24 15:46:51 2015 UTC,"I hope audiences can view this episode as an exposition of these stereotypes, rather than a show supporting racism and prejudice.   My bad, I totally missed this. I guess I misread the meaning of this line from earlier in your paper but I should have been more charitable:   In a line that seems to sum up the whole show’s prejudiced and stereotypical sentiments toward NAs, one man says, “I wouldn’t mind sitting on my ass all day, smoking mushrooms and collecting government checks.”"

Your final paragraph analysis is the EXACT OPPOSITE of the message presented in the piece.  Take a page outta Tony's final speech at the end of the episode and have some self pride.why let a few things that a SELECT number of people in a race do affect the entirety of your perception on that race?.. the comment of the piece was that people take their sensitivities to perceived racism and predjudices too far, only furthering the hate and misinformation.  I believe the entire message of this episode was lost on you buddy, also, this is one of my favorite episodes from season 4.... most DEF I must say!   I think you gotta watch this episode, and often the entire show, as a way to see how these prejudices and hateful feelings and ideas are misplaced and foolish... and that by taking it too seriously and to heart, you only continue the conversation and lend credence to the idiocracy.  And I think this episode specifically served the show in putting a down to earth and comical spin on silly stereotypes.  ""They said it's like finding out James Caan wasn't italian"""

Personally, I think Chase really didn't know how to end their relationship in a better way.  The therapy thing really was, IMO, long in the tooth by the 6th season.  Besides him discussing his son's depression and suicide attempt with her, there wasn't really much they could do with it and they pretty much played the Melfi storyline out as it was.  I do remember hearing that there was some unfinished/cut scene from the final episode that had Melfi and her psychiatrist in a session after she cut Tony off.  I think including even that would have been nice, but the final episode was really about Tony concluding our relationships with a bunch of characters (Janice post-Bobby, Sil in a coma, Junior in a severely debilitated state) so Chase might have felt it didn't have a place in the episode."

thesopranos,33ayyi,Sauceykat,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:09:23 2015 UTC,No problem.  Both characters were basically the same typecast (young idiot associate that gets wacked for being an idiot) so they're easy to confuse.
thesopranos,33ayyi,itisisntit123,7,Wed Apr 22 00:17:07 2015 UTC,"He kills Bevilacqua because he severely injured Christopher.  It's a revenge killing, not a thrill killing.  A thrill killing is when someone kills someone else purely for the pleasure of it, with is psychopathic, serial killer behavior.  Later he has a flashback or dream where Matthew screams out ""Mommy!"" signifying some sort of guilt.    And how do you know the bookie didn't want to be in the game or was weak?  All we know about the bookie is that Tony was ordered to kill the guy when he was in his early 20s and ""made his bones."""
thesopranos,33ayyi,itisisntit123,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:45:49 2015 UTC,"Technically, I think Matthew Bevilaqua is driving while his partner Sean shoots Christopher - when Bevilaqua starts shooting, none of the bullets hit Chris (as far as I can make out). Not a huge difference in this context though. Although I don't really agree with the OP's hypothesis, I think it is valid that the wiseguy code is broken over and over again in the show. It's the dissonance between the 'code' and the life he really leads that makes Tony who he is."
thesopranos,33ayyi,dufflecoat,1 point,Sun May 10 02:56:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, Tony breaks the wise-guy code a lot but it's not broken here.  Anybody who attempts to or is able to assassinate a made guy gets killed in retaliation.  Murdering Bevilaqua may not be justified in the context of normal individuals, but in Tony's world, it's more than justified.  I didn't really understand why Tony wanted to let Ralphie give Jackie Jr. a pass after the botched robbery.  He didn't care when Jackie Jr. was eventually murdered and I don't see why he would want to appease Ralphie, who he hated, over everyone else in his inner circle who wanted revenge."
thesopranos,33ayyi,itisisntit123,2,Wed May 13 18:57:51 2015 UTC,"Tony is playing a game with Ralphie, I think. If Ralphie's the one who gives Jackie Jr. a pass, Tony knows that the rest of his crew will be outraged, which suits Tony anyway. And if Ralphie's the one who shows leadership and orders the killing, Tony can feel (in his own mind) blameless over the murder of his daughter's friend/Rosalie's kid/a former boss's son. Tony puts Ralphie on the spot to torment him because he absolutely loathes the guy.  It's interesting that Jackie, the pawn in this situation, is learning to play chess right before he's shot."

Red herring?  Personally I think it was random, Members Only guy escaped from a mental hospital, randomly walked into Holstens, randomly finds a gun in the restroom and randomly shoots Tony when missing his shot  at the jukebox he thought was the true source of the voices inside his head.

Tony's great at recognising his mistakes - just after he makes them.  To that end though it did end up serving Melfi's described purpose since Meadow basically had to tell her friend that his dad made his own bed and this is how life works.

Obviously Adriana getting whacked was so powerful, and unexpected in that most people let what they didn't want to happen cloud their vision of what was clearly the only way things could go. I will say, it shocked me as well, I really thought that there was a chance they'd live or die together.  I also love the Tony and Carmella dinner scene early on in the episode. Reconciling their relationship, yet the dialogue between them sounds more like one of Tony's sit-downs, just negotiating and bargaining. This coming right after the episode that ends with them talking on the phone and looking at the sunrise.  Amazing, episode, amazing show. You've still got absolute gold ahead, the second half of season 6 is just constant standout episodes. Cherish it, who knows if there will ever be a show like it again?"

thesopranos,32zbeo,capedconkerer,2,Sat Apr 18 04:07:00 2015 UTC,Paulie harbors a lot of resentment for Pussy. He brings it up a lot like when Tony is in the hospital.
thesopranos,32zbeo,bucknasty219,3,Sun Apr 19 02:38:32 2015 UTC,"either Paulie or Tony I'd say, Sil for the most part is a level headed guy to fire off unnecessarily"
thesopranos,32zbeo,capedconkerer,2,Sat Apr 18 01:03:15 2015 UTC,"Not when it comes to government rats, though. Sil has no mercy."
thesopranos,32yomg,Plastastic,12,Fri Apr 17 20:31:47 2015 UTC,I think there was a 50/50 chance Tony went over there with that thought in his mind. Ralph's remarks were like adding insult to injury and served as the catalyst in Tony's decision to kill Ralph. Ralph's nonchalant (to say the least) attitude towards Pie O' My along with his comments about Tony's personal eating habits set him off.
thesopranos,32yomg,VirgilSollozzo,5,Fri Apr 17 20:46:03 2015 UTC,"Ralph's such an idiot, his mouth was going to get him killed sooner or later.   When I watched the series for the first time this was pretty much the part where I lost my remaining sympathies for Tony, even though Ralph was a scumbag who had it coming."
thesopranos,32yomg,BonzosLiver,4,Fri Apr 17 20:48:55 2015 UTC,"Just curious, why did him killing Ralph make you lose your sympathies? Fuck Ralph. I applauded Tony for killing him."
thesopranos,32yomg,resoooo,2,Sat Apr 18 14:30:12 2015 UTC,"Because it once again highlights how much of a hypocrite Tony is, he goes off against Paulie for wanting to kill Tony saying ""You can quote the rules so you can fucking obey 'em!"" only for Tony to kill him later on."
thesopranos,32yomg,Machinax,3,Sat Apr 18 15:57:00 2015 UTC,Whats really weird to me is how i never rooted against Tony even though hes such an asshole. I always loved him.

thesopranos,32yomg,Bkwordguy,3,Tue Apr 21 07:09:29 2015 UTC,"Tony tells Ralph he's banging Valentina....suddenly Pie oh My is dead...then Ralph.   I think Tony telling him about Valentina, while his son was still in the hospital, was the last straw for Ralph and set him over the edge."
thesopranos,32yomg,Machinax,3,Fri Apr 17 23:55:30 2015 UTC,"I think that's what Tony figured, and he killed Ralph partly over the horse, partly over Tracee, and partly over his guilt at taking his goomah."
thesopranos,32yomg,illegal_deagle,0,Sat Apr 18 07:29:59 2015 UTC,I can't imagine Tony would feel guilt over taking anyone's goomah.
thesopranos,32yomg,Tricaliotis,3,Tue Apr 21 07:10:27 2015 UTC,"No, Tony was feeling genuine sympathy about Ralph's kid being gravely injured. But his emotions were very raw. Remember that there are only two things that Tony has compassion about: children and animals. This killing was just as much about Tracee as it was about Ralph's son, and he conflated the two with the death of Pie (he often conflates women with horses) and snapped at the moment of the perfect storm of all these."
thesopranos,32yomg,Guibou24,3,Fri Apr 17 23:44:36 2015 UTC,"If he was anning to kill him, he would have planned it better.   It was impulse and made him look stupid in front of Christopher.  If it was planned, it wod have been done cleanly without exposing Tony to such huge risks."
thesopranos,32yomg,Hot_Rats,7,Sat Apr 18 00:41:49 2015 UTC,I don't think so. He drove to Ralph with the intention to give him a hard time but Ralphie is a guy who don't care a lot with authority so he gives Tony his impressions and Tony decide to finish him. I think mafioso act with pulse a lot and in the Sopranos it's even worse IMO it seems like they don't care if the police will find out who kill who...
thesopranos,32yomg,Guibou24,3,Fri Apr 17 20:56:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. I don't think he had any intention of killing him initially. Definitely wasn't happy with him but I think this situation was a perfect example of Tony acting on a complete impulse. Not that Ralph didn't have it coming, I just don't think Tony premeditated it. Makes the scene so much better, at least in my opinion, and sets up the whole idea of Tony not being able to control his emotions/actions."
thesopranos,32yomg,avoritz,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:44:01 2015 UTC,yeah it's where the struggle start for Tony. After that he become a disaster for him and his 2 families and it's even worst in season 5 & 6

thesopranos,32y7fs,SuperTallCraig,7,Fri Apr 17 19:03:21 2015 UTC,"Open endings can be very polarizing in fan communities, and nowhere is that truer than with the Sopranos. People who believe they know the definitive answer to the ending are often quite hostile towards other interpretations. You will find few factions more militant than the ""Tony gets whacked"" truthers."
thesopranos,32y7fs,boogersonsteve,-2,Fri Apr 17 20:16:30 2015 UTC,It's not even that though. I'm open for any sort of interpretation you can think up if you can provide convincing evidence. What sort of evidence did OP propose that gives this one any credence at all?
thesopranos,32y7fs,pinata_penis_pump2,5,Fri Apr 17 22:58:27 2015 UTC,Because lots of people adamantly refuse to acknowledge that the ending is open for interpretation.  It's quite ridiculous that despite no concrete evidence for Tony dying people will make it their life goal to criticize people that believe otherwise.
thesopranos,32y7fs,cos_dashit,3,Fri Apr 17 20:27:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, the point of not just the final scene, but the whole show, is that it is ambiguous and open for interpretation. Tony both gets whacked, and doesn't get whacked! Both endings happen, in infinite, alternate Sopranoverses. Nothing is definite except for what we saw on the screen. Some people can't handle that because people don't like uncertainty.  The best works of fiction inspire interpretations the author never even imagined. People project their own meanings onto it with stuff that goes on in their own lives. I know I did with Sopranos.  OP, good for you for considering other theories and I think yours is cool."
thesopranos,32y7fs,boogersonsteve,-1,Fri Apr 17 21:04:28 2015 UTC,"Well it's sort of a ridiculous theory to begin with, but besides that, you provided almost no evidence to support it."
thesopranos,32y7fs,Dtapped,-4,Fri Apr 17 21:05:23 2015 UTC,"Ridiculous. Nothing short of mental masturbation really.  I appreciate that you're trying to pump new blood into a well worn topic, but the theory you're presenting is so left field you'd need to be smoking rocks to genuinely entertain it.   Tony was whacked as far as I'm concerned. And I'll be sticking with it, no matter what new info emerges (e.g the recent comments by Chase). The series wraps with much more closure that way."

thesopranos,32zspy,AirJordanFan93,2,Sat Apr 18 14:09:23 2015 UTC,I actually loved it. 6B was fantastic and I really enjoyed the dreams sequence of 6A!.
thesopranos,32zspy,Mandraker,2,Mon Apr 20 23:57:21 2015 UTC,"I loved it! The reason I love The Sopranos so much is because of my interest in psychology and the human mind.

The only thing that matters in the entire breakdown of the scene is his comment about Don't Stop Believin. That for me encompasses entirely what the Sopranos is about, why it's such a fantastic show. Life, death, family, violence, love and murder, all the moments  of life across six seasons, what it all comes down to are the good moments, the happy moments. The Sopranos never really was a crime drama, it was always more about people than what they did for a living. In the end, maybe Tony lives, maybe he dies, it doesn't matter, because either way he's surrounded by his family, and that makes it worth it, in life and death, love and sorrow."
thesopranos,32tsb1,Al_Scarface_Capone,6,Thu Apr 16 20:59:38 2015 UTC,"They'll never talk about any other aspect of the show, it seems."
thesopranos,32tsb1,PigeonT,9,Fri Apr 17 00:55:35 2015 UTC,"I'm glad Chase has always kept it vague and left it up to the viewer to decide what they think happened.  Personally I think, yeah, Tony was killed. He and Phil's little feud had caused so many problems that New York decided to use Tony to get rid of Phil and then went with their original ""decapitate and do business with what's left"" plan. It's also likely that they had to kill Tony in order to keep peace in their own ranks since Tony had Phil shot in front of his family.  But, there's also part of me that wants to believe that, even after all he's done, Tony still could've just enjoyed a nice dinner with his family and life went on as usual."
thesopranos,32tsb1,jaggular,18,Thu Apr 16 18:02:17 2015 UTC,"This may sound out of left field, and it's just my interpretation, but I personally think Chase was trying to make the point that, whether he gets shot in the diner or not, Tony's been ""dead"" from the very first scene of The Sopranos (metaphorically speaking).  Nobody escapes ""The Sopranos"", and the threat of death lingers over all involved."
thesopranos,32tsb1,mccruthers,5,Thu Apr 16 19:10:57 2015 UTC,I like that reading.
thesopranos,32tsb1,Nitsua87,11,Thu Apr 16 20:44:35 2015 UTC,"I personally love the ending eight years after it first aired, for many of the reasons you described. Even if Tony leaves that diner alive, the Member's Only guy is a reminder to Tony and the viewer that death will always surround him. He's never safe."
thesopranos,32tsb1,UniversalPolymath,5,Thu Apr 16 18:59:09 2015 UTC,"I used to be far more wrapped up in the debate over whether Tony was killed at Holsten's or not, particularly in the year (give or take two or three - Christ, time flies) after it first aired. I always maintained that it was intentionally ambiguous, and never tried to shout anyone else down for their own interpretation, but Tony being murdered by MOG always made the most sense to me. So I went with it.  As time has gone on, I think I've come closer to understanding what Chase was trying to do, particularly after these most recent couple of statements. I'm glad Chase is opening up about what it all means, but I'm also really glad he still absolutely refuses to give a definitive answer to a mystery that was never intended to have one, regardless of how many fans still demand it.   I really wish this latest article could neutralize the argument once and for all - even in the absence of flatly answering the question ""Did Tony die?"" with a simple yes or a no - by truly communicating how pointless a question it always was to begin with. But to quote Silvio, ""It'll never fuckin' happen."""
thesopranos,32tsb1,CC2560,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:47:47 2015 UTC,"I've come to understand it this way: We could just as well ask ""Did Paulie have a heart attack and die the next day?"" and it would be much like asking if Tony got shot in the diner. The show is over and you're asking about an event that may or may not have happened outside the span of the show's canon.   Now within the canon, I choose to believe that the guy in the bathroom had a gun and was walking out with it aimed at Tony offscreen just as Tony was look up at Meadow walking in. But after reading this explanation from Chase, I'm finally able to understand why he says it doesn't matter. That final scene was the end of Tony's story. If an even that happened a split second after the final shot had to be included, it would have.   The callback to the end of season one, talking about making the most of the ""good times"" is what it's all about. The Sopranos is ultimately about life of quiet desperation that we live in modern American society. Though you wouldn't expect it, even a mob boss like Tony lives in quiet desperation. Desperation for those little moments that make life worth it."

How could you not think that they didn't CHOOSE the person in that picture.  They knew they were choosing someone that looked the way they wanted it to look.  i remember reading in the story notes scans I have in a book that David Chase was so Obsessive about little quirks of the show, down to the specific Philippine Delivery Guy in Season 2.

thesopranos,32med7,syzygyly,4,Wed Apr 15 00:14:57 2015 UTC,I would lose my shit if it turns out Cookie Monster is David Chase.
thesopranos,32med7,nofuckinpodcast,2,Wed Apr 15 04:29:23 2015 UTC,"Am I missing something?  Cookie Monster says the scene was about paranoia.  Chase says Tony doesn't even notice the Members Only guy because he walks in with a AJ.  Chase then says Tony was In a happy moment with his family in a colorful diner with booths and candy.  He says the tension is more about what WE bring to it becuase we know Tony has enemies.  Chase says the ending is about ""life ends and death comes"".  Am I misreading Cookie Monsters ""paranoia"" interpretation?  Are you referring to a different post of his?"
thesopranos,32med7,JohnBoy347,4,Wed Apr 15 04:42:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The Cookie Monster interpretation is just the same old ""Tony's going to have to look over his shoulder for the rest of his life"" schtick, which I never got out of the scene at all. Tony is completely content and at ease in Holsten's. All that paranoia and suspicion is solely on the part of the viewer, because we're the ones who can see the whole troubling picture. Tony is oblivious.  Anyway, I think this quote says it all, really:  ""Meadow is filled with nothing but very, very deep emotions about parking her car. But possibly a minute later, her head will be filled with emotions she could never even imagine. We all take this stuff so seriously—losing our keys, parking our car, a winter cold, a summer cold, an allergy—whatever it is. And this stuff fills our mind from second to second, moment to moment. And the big moment is always out there waiting."""
thesopranos,32med7,somerton,2,Wed Apr 15 07:27:59 2015 UTC,"I didn't post the Cookie Monster comment, but I think it's that Chase goes on at length about making specific choices to create tension, e.g., being able to cut to an exterior shot to allow it to build. Yes, he expected us to bring tension ourselves, but he blocked the scene and edited the scene to heighten it further. If he chose to shoot it in any other way it might not have been tense at all, our own feelings about it or not.   ETA: Would also say that what Cookie Monster has right is that it is kind of about Tony's life in general. Again, Chase does mention it could have happened another time, this is the life Tony leads."
thesopranos,32med7,nofuckinpodcast,3,Wed Apr 15 04:48:11 2015 UTC,"Chase says specifically that Tony notices MO guy because of who he is:   ...yet there is a slight ill at ease feeling which we bring to it because we know who he is and what he's done. And he can never be sure that any enemy is completely gone. He always has to have eyes behind his head.   later   I would say that Tony checked the guy out at some level. I mean any middle-aged male that would get that close to him, I'm sure he would do some summary surveillance of. It may be very quick; his instincts are very sharp. He doesn't feel threatened by him but I'm sure he clocks that that guy's in the bathroom, and that that guy should come out. It's more like 'I want to see that guy come out.' This is all on a subconscious level, I'm sure."
thesopranos,32med7,syzygyly,0,Wed Apr 15 13:09:48 2015 UTC,"No he doesn't. In the scene, Tony finally looks at him when he walks to the bathroom.  Chase said he may notice the guy on a ""subconscious"" level.  That's not exactly sounding like he directed the scene to show Tony is paranoid.  Tony is happy in the scene and Chase points out that the bell is a ""meditation bell"" that puts him in the here and now for his ""magic moment"" with his family.  Sorry, but the ""Cookie Monster"" interpretation is incredibly weak.   I shouldn't feel so proud though to discredit someone who talks like a fictional children's character."
thesopranos,32med7,JohnBoy347,4,Wed Apr 15 13:52:35 2015 UTC,"Listen, it isn't about ""discrediting"" anyone, or about being right or wrong or any of that. It actually doesn't matter what Chase has to say if you subscribe to the Death of the Author theory. David Chase won't always be here to walk people through shot for shot, so we need to allow for the audience to come to their own conclusions. There will always be a difference in opinion, there will always be more than one way to look at something. It's something we all have to accept. While you certainly couldn't argue something outrageous like, ""Tony got abducted by aliens,"" if you want to argue Tony is alive, dead, or both, you're allowed to do so.   This community doesn't need to be trying to prove anyone right or wrong. We should be thinking about what that scene means to all of us and how it makes us feel. I think regardless of what Chase says here, he's an artist, the show is art, and art is always open to new interpretation. We have to embrace and celebrate that.   Edit: Formatting."

thesopranos,32med7,irs320,14,Wed Apr 15 06:19:21 2015 UTC,"As I was reading that, I really had a hard time believing those were Chase's own words, just for how candid and thorough an account it was, coming from someone who usually explains his work as briefly as he can. This is as clear as he's ever been on the finale. Fuck, what an awesome read. So great that eight years after the fact, new stories can still come out that get me all hyped.  Interesting that the technical analysis done by Master of Sopranos seems to be largely spot-on. The 2001 POV pattern, the rhythm the scene falls into around the bell ringing, the intentionality of AJ and MOG coming in together serving as a distraction for Tony. All impressively on-point. I don't know if Master of Sopranos is still doing updates, but he's gonna love the hell out of this article.  Where he and Chase part ways (and where Chase parts ways with lots of fans, actually) remains on the significance of the very cut-and-dry literal question of Tony's death. Everything Chase says here points toward a very intentional effort to suggest the possibility of death, and that seems to be as far as he's willing to go. Yeah, Tony definitely might have died right there. Yeah, Meadow might've walked into the restaurant where ""her head will be filled with emotions she could never even imagine"". What does it matter, either way?"
thesopranos,32med7,UniversalPolymath,3,Wed Apr 15 03:56:29 2015 UTC,"Seriously, Master of Sopranos must feel completely validated.  I actually still think the latter is a better read.  As far as it not being a literal interpretation, I think Chase is just paying lip service to those who want to believe Tony's alive.  His most telling quote here is ""Life ends and death comes but don't stop believing"".   That says it all about Chase's intention.  He also says he ""won't get into whether the final shot is Tony's POV"" but then says he thought many would think Tony died and then corrects himself further by saying he thought ""Everyone""'would think Tony died.  I think these statements shows what his intentions clearly were for the final scene and what he wanted the fans to interpret. Otherwise, I agree.  Great read."
thesopranos,32med7,JohnBoy347,3,Wed Apr 15 04:05:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think ""Don't Stop Believing"" is so much a message to fans there. I believe Chase when he says it's more on the nose than that: This is all coming to an end very quickly but there are short moments you can grab hold of that really make it worth it. You can always ""remember the good times."""
thesopranos,32med7,nofuckinpodcast,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:22:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe. But there are plenty of other quotes from Chase on that Master of Sopranos site where he clearly isn't talking in hypothericals regarding Tony dying.  He's says something like (and I'm paraphrasing) ""I wanted to show how precious life is so the only way I thought I could do that was to rip it away"" and that he ""tore it away from Tony and from us"".   It sounds like Chase surely believes Tony died right then and there but he's leaving room for others to interpret it their own way."
thesopranos,32med7,JohnBoy347,2,Wed Apr 15 04:31:53 2015 UTC,He's also said that he didn't want retribution cause people at the time we're getting away with machination and such. The world isn't good in which a horrible man like Tony should die.
thesopranos,32med7,jersey_wiseguy,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:35:02 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily disagreeing on that, but I don't think he's paying lip service to anyone because why even do that? I think the song ties more into the scene rather than being a message to fans."
thesopranos,32med7,nofuckinpodcast,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:38:18 2015 UTC,Agreed - if it weren't DGA or some absolutely credible source posting this I would be very skeptical.
thesopranos,32med7,syzygyly,3,Wed Apr 15 13:11:07 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, and a lot to process. I've long felt the ending was more about time slipping by than anything else (actually brought it up a few times here recently). More than anything else in that last batch of episodes we hear several references to ""chances passing by"" and moments floating past just out of reach. I really like shortening the length of shots over the episode to illustrate this.   ETA (might do this a few times):   I still look at that final scene as visual metaphor in a lot of ways. It's trying to make a point rather than settle plot. ""He could have been shot three years ago"" or he could have died that night, but no matter what, life is always slipping away and all we can do is remember the good times.   ETA:  Also like that the ending is yet another comment from Chase on television. He knew the audience was expecting something, because TV has conditioned us to feel that way, and he totally used it against us."
thesopranos,32med7,nofuckinpodcast,4,Wed Apr 15 04:21:09 2015 UTC,Came here expecting people to proclaim this article as further definitive proof of Tony's murder (of which there is none). Was not disappointed.

thesopranos,32med7,syzygyly,0,Wed Apr 15 16:54:16 2015 UTC,"So Chase basically supports the ""Master of Sopranos"" interpretation."
thesopranos,32med7,JohnBoy347,4,Wed Apr 15 02:47:55 2015 UTC,"Haven't read MoS in awhile but I think it definitively claims that Tony dies and this article doesn't support that at all.   He might have gotten shot three years ago in that situation. But he didn't. Whether this is the end here, or not, it's going to come at some point for the rest of us. Hopefully we're not going to get shot by some rival gang mob or anything like that. I'm not saying that [happened]. But obviously he stood more of a chance of getting shot by a rival gang mob than you or I do because he put himself in that situation. All I know is the end is coming for all of us."
thesopranos,32med7,JohnBoy347,2,Wed Apr 15 13:14:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  Chase makes it point again that he won't specifically state whether Tony died.  He never will but all of his comments are a bunch of verbal gymnastics to NOT actually say that Tony died.  To wit:  ""I said to Gandolfini, the bell rings and you look up. That last shot of Tony ends on 'don't stop,' it's mid-song. I'm not going to go into [if that's Tony's POV]. I thought the possibility would go through a lot of people's minds or maybe everybody's mind that he was killed. ""  ""that's what I wanted people to believe.  That life ends and death comes but don't stop believing""  He's leaving another interpretation open for the children who either don't want to believe he's dead or who can't deduce something for themselves."
thesopranos,32med7,SopranosAutopsy,7,Wed Apr 15 14:00:21 2015 UTC,"It was an open ending. Chase's refusal to make a comment aren't ""verbal gymnastics"" to keep the plebes from catching wind of the real ending that needs to be solved by the literari, it's indicative of that ending's openness.   He won't comment on what happened to Tony after the cut-to-black because nothing happened to Tony after the cut-to-black. And by that I don't mean to say he definitively was not shot, but rather that when the show cut to black, Tony's story ended. The book is closed. Whether you want to believe Tony was shot or not is entirely up to you, but that is something that you are projecting onto your own conception of the character.   The last thing that happens in the story of Tony Soprano is him sitting in a restaurant, glancing up. We are left to interpret that glance however we will."
thesopranos,32med7,JohnBoy347,0,Wed Apr 15 17:54:59 2015 UTC,"You're hysterical.  the last thing isn't Tony glancing up, it's a 10 second black screen exactly where Tony's POV should be. I guess you didn't read this:  Richard Belzer: I was working with Steve Schirripa [Bacala] recently. We were judging “Last Coming Standing” for NBC and we were talking about a lot of things and he was saying he heard all of these theories for the show that had nothing to do with your intention and wasn’t anything the actors thought. Like little hints along the way, like a word, like when Tony and Steve are on the boat at the lake and they say “‘you never know its gonna happen” or “you never know its gonna hit you”  David Chase: That was part of the ending.  Richard Belzer: Oh, it was? see, what do I know? Were there other things in previous episodes that were hints towards it?  David Chase: There was that and there was a shooting in which Silvio was a witness. Well he wasn’t a witness, he was eating dinner with a couple of hookers and with some other guy who got hit and there was some visual stuff that went on there which sort of amplified Tony’s remark to Bacala about you know “you don’t know its happened” or “you won’t know it happened when it hits you”. That’s about it.  Richard Belzer: that's what John Kennedy said"
thesopranos,32med7,SopranosAutopsy,3,Thu Apr 16 00:17:28 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with anything said in that passage. It was a part of the ending. I believe that Chase wanted us to entertain the possibility that Tony was killed, or else the camera wouldn't have lingered so purposely on Members Only Man.

thesopranos,32nmcm,avoritz,4,Wed Apr 15 05:53:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think the film's a failure at all (except possibly the final scene), and it's my impression that most people who dig Chase's style enjoyed it too. Of course it didn't strike a chord with a wider audience, but that's to be expected with a film like this. Here's what I wrote a few months ago in another thread on here:  I like it very much -- not a masterpiece or anything, but one of the better films of the last few years. It's fully a product of Chase's worldview and aesthetic sensibilities, giving it a unique flavor that helps it overcome the inherently generic subject matter and 60s setting. Those who just like Sopranos for the mob stuff probably won't care for it, but if you appreciate Sopranos for the depth of the writing and the realistic way the show captures life with all its mundanity and disappointments, the way people actually speak and act, etc. then you should enjoy the film. It has the same kind of willfully subversive, deeply pessimistic (but cautiously optimistic) tone that Sopranos had. It also has the same type of dark and absurd humor. You can just tell they're both coming from the same distinctive artistic voice. The film even has its own controversially oblique and unconventional ending, though I don't think it works nearly as well as the Sopranos ending, which is perfection. I'm very interested to see more movies from Chase, he's quite a talent and has a lot to say about life."

thesopranos,32l2bz,syzygyly,2,Tue Apr 14 21:07:23 2015 UTC,"True. But to get serious for a sec (this post was meant to be lighthearted), Tony's duck obsession doesn't last long. When he's looking out at the pool in (I believe) episode 3, he turns to Meadow and says something like, ""Those ducks were really something, weren't they?"" to which she replies that he always complained about how they were ruining the pool when they were there.  Like a lot of things on this show, people only appreciate something when it's gone -- this is probably the reason we drop in on Tony when the ducks are leaving, actually. So Tony can wax poetic in therapy about how much he loved the ducks but it's also possible that these feelings are as surface-level as his feelings about everything else.   Aaaaaand now we're having a serious conversation on the internet about a fictional family of ducks."
thesopranos,32l2bz,reggieLedoux26,3,Tue Apr 14 21:28:51 2015 UTC,His love for those ducks lasted long after they were gone though. I think it was S4 when he was still buying sacks of duck food in the hope that they would come back someday. That was where he hid the money that Carmela stole from the bird-feeder. It was that duck food that even attracted the black bear to their house too.  I think Tony's love for animals is one of the genuinely honest aspects of his personality.
thesopranos,32l2bz,315MhmmFruitBarrels,3,Tue Apr 14 21:58:41 2015 UTC,That jerk Yochelson says that's just an act.
thesopranos,32l2bz,itisisntit123,2,Wed Apr 15 02:06:44 2015 UTC,Very true.
thesopranos,32l2bz,thatsnotwhatimsaying,2,Tue Apr 14 22:06:14 2015 UTC,"He does fix the flooring inside the house by the back door by himself in one episode - Carmela says something like ""look at you"" in appreciation. So it is possible he built the ramp himself."
thesopranos,32l2bz,Bkwordguy,2,Tue Apr 14 20:54:29 2015 UTC,"Totally! But then again the fact that she comments on it might mean it's a rare occasion.   For me, I find the scenario hilarious no matter what. It's either a high ranking member of the mob spending his Saturday building a ramp in his pool, or it's his low-level nephew probably trying to figure out some way to steal lumber from the hardware store."
thesopranos,32k5b1,Tricaliotis,6,Tue Apr 14 13:14:34 2015 UTC,"Tony loved a great deal of people, but very rarely was it unconditional. I think the person for whom he had the purest love was Meadow.  I think his love for Artie was all tied in to nostalgia and some small amount of loyalty. But that it was also just as conditional as it was for almost everybody else in his life, though."
thesopranos,32k5b1,Chilli__P,4,Tue Apr 14 14:35:07 2015 UTC,"Tough to say. I go back and forth on whether Tony is a true sociopath (though he more than likely is). Personally, I feel like the show added enough nuance to the character that you can genuinely be on the fence about it. He of course possesses the tendencies, and he's of course narcissistic, but there are moments he does seem to care about others. It's his big character struggle.   (We also have to remember that Melfi's character arc is at work here too -- her realizing that she was more of an enabler than a helper. It doesn't totally mean that Kupferberg is 100% correct.)  The show dealt in grey areas and ambiguity and that extends out to Tony's personality, too. So, in that vain, I do think he really cared about Artie. But, his narcissism and anti-social behavior often meant he thought of himself first, and a lot of his dealings with Artie are self-serving. He either wants to assuage his guilt for what he's done to Artie or feel better about himself. With Artie, he can step out of the mob world and wonder, ""Am I a toxic person?""  But, inevitably, that mob world is too comfortable and alluring for him to really want to hear that answer."
thesopranos,32k5b1,nofuckinpodcast,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:04:11 2015 UTC,"Love this answer to the OP question.  Tony doesn't LOVE anyone, they are all just validations that come back to him. He cares about his image and how he is perceived in relation to his relationships.  He has to be good to people in order to appear kind and upstanding, yet all his relationships are built on lies and manipulation.  Can't think of any relationship he has that isn't all about him in one way or another."
thesopranos,32k5b1,chaspooley,6,Thu Apr 16 05:18:55 2015 UTC,psychopath =/= sociopath. Tony is a sociopath.
thesopranos,32k5b1,boogersonsteve,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:28:06 2015 UTC,"He wasn't, but his mother was.  Tony learned that sociopathic behavior had its advantages."
thesopranos,32k5b1,ablack9000,-8,Mon Apr 20 02:47:13 2015 UTC,Nah it's the same shit
thesopranos,32k5b1,profzar,5,Tue Apr 14 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"See, it's not though"
thesopranos,32k5b1,boogersonsteve,2,Tue Apr 14 19:00:14 2015 UTC,Can you explain the difference?
thesopranos,32k5b1,enricopollazzo,4,Tue Apr 14 23:19:12 2015 UTC,"Basically, psychopaths are thought to be innately anti-social while sociopaths mostly learn anti-social behavior from a parent or mentor early in their lives. Psychopaths are unable to understand social norms and have trouble fitting in to normal society; sociopaths are adept at studying and maintaining the illusion of normal relationships."
thesopranos,32k5b1,boogersonsteve,3,Wed Apr 15 00:36:03 2015 UTC,"I asked a friend of mine about this a year ago.  He studying to become a clinical psychologist.  He says that psychologists nowadays consider both psychopath and sociopath as the same type of personality disorder.  Criminologists, however, may still distinguish the two.  He also stated that there's no way Tony could have been a psychopath/sociopath because of his panic attacks.  Psychopaths, among their other traits, have an extreme threshold for anxiety.  There's also no way a psychopath/sociopath would ever put himself in therapy, let alone stick around in it.  You could argue that Tony wanted to use the therapy to improve his criminal skills but that doesn't happen at all during the series.  The study referred to in the final episode is done on people diagnosed with ASPD while in prison, so their therapy sessions are probably not voluntary.  They use it to learn to mimic empathy better.  Tony doesn't really take anything from therapy other than a larger disdain from his mother.  Personally, I don't think Tony was a true sociopath/psychopath.  He decided to call the cops on the pedophile coach in the first season after much deliberation and then feels proud about himself for not hurting someone (which he displays in an intoxicated with Carmela).  He felt a lot of guilt about killing off Pussy despite never discussing it outright (his dreams, his flashbacks, the talking fish, etc).  He is also extremely shaken by AJ's suicide attempt and blames his own ""putrid genes"" for AJ's depression.  I would argue he had a lot of anti-social tendencies but he wasn't completely void of a conscience; he had diminished empathy but not completely diminished.  Now Ralphie was pretty much a textbook sociopath.  He didn't have ANY conscience at all and the only time he displays signs of pain is when his son gets shot by the arrow.  However, he instead uses the event to try to ""remake himself,"" which was questionable considering his past behavior."
thesopranos,32k5b1,itisisntit123,2,Wed Apr 15 01:03:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed that Tony was not a sociopath. He is incredibly selfish, but he also displays many instances of empathy in my opinion. The problem is that he has to suppress his empathy for work purposes."
thesopranos,32k5b1,cos_dashit,1 point,Thu Apr 16 12:13:02 2015 UTC,"I agree, I don't think Tony was, but his mother was.  Tony learned the advantages of sociopathic behavior.  At times, he may even wished he was."
thesopranos,32k5b1,ablack9000,2,Mon Apr 20 02:45:46 2015 UTC,"Psych major here. Every teacher I've ever had say that psycho/sociopath is a lay mans term for someone incapable of empathy. It's a spectrum disorder, so the causes/behaviors of them can be widely varied."
thesopranos,32k5b1,kangorr,0,Wed Apr 15 21:54:05 2015 UTC,I'm almost 100% certain the difference is explained in an episode. Pay attention.

He gives Artie a huge loan and then absolves him of his loan, and also blows up his restaurant so his reputation wouldn't be ruined by someone getting shot and killed in the place.  Despite it being twisted logic, it showed he cared.  On the other hand, Artie's place was a perfect mob hangout and was used for a lot of the big dinners where all the capos would meet and discuss business, so Tony might have wanted to keep Artie in his pocket for those reasons."
thesopranos,32k5b1,itisisntit123,1 point,Wed Apr 15 02:28:16 2015 UTC,i almost downvoted because i disagree but that would be an incredibly shitty thing to do lol.. so i up voted  the point you bring up is awfully interesting tho about sociopaths not engaging in psych voluntarily... very interesting...
thesopranos,32k5b1,chaspooley,0,Thu Apr 16 05:21:09 2015 UTC,Yes he did.
