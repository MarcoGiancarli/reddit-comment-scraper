moped,3e4r1a,lackofcoherence,2,Wed Jul 22 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"It wasn't really motivation so much as my Sachs G3 was stolen from me (don't worry I got it back 9 months later) and about 3 months into it being gone I saw the DKW on Craigslist.  I went and window shopped and met the guy who had it listed but couldn't afford the money he was wanting for it. Walked away and it was still for sale a couple weeks later. My mom wanted to see it in person and convinced me to take her to see it again and maybe try and haggle with the guy... I told the guy my story about my bike being gone and asked if he could afford to give it up for less than 1/2 of what he was asking and he told me I could have it for $400.  Basically she fell into my lap and so I just committed to making it happen.  I love the 50s and mid century modern design... A lot of the furniture in my house I found at antique stores and flea markets and is from this era, my record player console is from 1961.... So she fits right in to my current style :D"

moped,3e5kum,Goofnarg,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:14:23 2015 UTC,The fuel to air ratio can be changed by switching out the jets in the carb
moped,3e5kum,POSITIVE_COMMENTS,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:09:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah sounds like an air leak and potentially a jetting issue too. An air leak will throw off the fuel air ratio and make the bike stall and run hot. When you do the carb cleaner trick make sure to spray around intake and exhaust port, and between where the cylinder meets the head and where it meets the bottom end. Make sure all your engine studs are torqued to spec (can find service manuals all over the Internet). If it's still a mystery then get/cut some new gaskets and rebuild the top end. Treatland.tv has complete garelli gasket sets that will work for you"
moped,3e5kum,tekstrom11,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:47:59 2015 UTC,Awesome! The thing is it stalls when I spray the carb but the carb only really has one or two gaskets and they are all working fine so I'm a bit lost still.

moped,3dxms6,tuttlecr,2,Mon Jul 20 11:21:08 2015 UTC,"Did it just die or was there any other noise as it was dying? If the revs shot up and then it immediately died, you probably just have a large airleak that just opened up and did not soft seize it. To check for damage (i.e. the piston smearing) you can just take the head off and look at the walls of the cylinder. If there are streaks, pull the whole top end off and examine the piston as well as you can smear piston material over the ring which will keep it from working properly. At that point you will know if you need to replace the piston, ring, cylinder, a combination of the three, or nothing at all in the top end other than the gaskets."
moped,3dxms6,paraarm,2,Mon Jul 20 14:32:47 2015 UTC,"Start with fueling. That sounds like a fueling problem.  You may have suddenly gotten an air leak somewhere which might have cause the mixture to lean out and throttle the bike up.

Save that for a later step tho.  step 1, get the owner and service manuals. you'll need to do every single maintenance item they recommend, and then some.  rebuild your carb. anything that isn't metal likely needs to be replaced, sometimes places sell rebuild kits w/ new float, gaskets, etc all packaged together. Get a new spark plug and wire, and forget those crappy treats ones, just buy a 1 ft section of wire, the NGK boot, and NGK plug from amazon or wherever, gap the spark plug correctly. Get a new fuel line, inline fuel filter, and clamps for the line. Check the condition of the tires, brakes, and all cables. Drain and replace all fuel in the thing, no telling. Also, get all new gaskets and some copper spray a gasket. Pull the head and check the condition of the piston and ring, and clean off and heavy deposits. Oh and clean your air filter, not sure how yours is, but I've soaked mine in gasoline to clean it.  If your piston, ring, and cylinder are trashed, you will need to hone the cylinder to make it larger, then buy a new piston and ring to fit the larger cylinder. You can hone the cylinder yourself w/ an attachment. When you put in the new ring, CHECK YOUR RING GAP. Don't be dumb like me, I just bought a kit w/ my trashed cylinder, I could have gotten away w/ $25 for a new piston and ring only, not the $90 kit I bought (however, now I'm enjoying my modest upgrades, it just took a while to fix everything).  Whatever you do, do not buy a single after market part until your moped is running 25mph on flats. I made the mistake of immediately upgrading the carb and pipe and lots of other stuff before I found the busted piston, so don't be dumb like me, all stock!!"

moped,3dvpjl,robotmoss,6,Sun Jul 19 22:42:21 2015 UTC,"It's 100 percent fine to run in your moped, but likely a waste of money. Octane refers to the ability of the gas to resist pre-spark detonation due to compression. This is important in high-revving 2 strokes, and high compression 4 strokes. Unless your moped is a real hotrod, lowest octane at the pump is fine."
moped,3dvpjl,hundreds_of_trouts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:43:40 2015 UTC,I was more talking about a kitted bike. I'm running a DMP kit with ritto crank and mlm pipe... It's points ignition at the moment.. Hitting mid 40s was thinking I could get a little more power with the higher octane fuel but you explanation makes me think it wouldn't do much.
moped,3dvpjl,hundreds_of_trouts,3,Mon Jul 20 00:33:17 2015 UTC,"That's right - it wouldn't do anything bad, but nothing especially useful either. That said, some 2strokes run well on higher octane gas because when they are in the powerband they are essentially being supercharged by the sounds waves from the expansion chamber. I would say try it out - if you notice even a little bit of difference (you would probably only notice a difference at wide open throttle) there is a chance the motor is pinging (detonating prior to the spark) once in a while on the low octane gas and decreasing power output over time. Higher octane might ensure you get maximum power per stroke.  Do you know the comp ratio on that motor? Is that crank a stroker-type crank?"

moped,3dvpjl,shitterplug,0,Mon Jul 20 00:55:40 2015 UTC,"I could get a little more power with the higher octane fuel   I believe you can do things w/ timing if you use super high octane fuel, depends how you want to tune."
moped,3dvpjl,triplefreshpandabear,3,Mon Jul 20 01:05:52 2015 UTC,"High octane fuel actually has lower energy potential than something like 87. All octanes do is inhibit detonation and preignition. They basically dilute the fuel. Unless you have a high compression engine, there's no point in running it. Most 4 stroke scooters are absolutely fine running 87 because they generally have an 8:1 compression ratio."
moped,3dvpjl,lackofcoherence,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:19:29 2015 UTC,"It's not diluted, it has a higher percentage of octane (an 8 carbon hydrocarbon molecule), or it is equivalent to having that percentage of octane, octane is just a type of gas molecule that resists burning just the right amount"
moped,3dvpjl,hypnotikrobot,2,Mon Jul 20 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"High octane=anti-ping. Depends how you tune and if your engine is knocking. I doubt you need 100+ octane, maybe a super kit racing bike, but I don't know about those kind of things."
moped,3dvpjl,BlorfMonger,2,Mon Jul 20 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"Here's a tip, if your bike runs fine on low octane fuel, then you don't need high octane fuel. If you bike suffers predetonation then a higher octane may help to improve it."

I never wanted to drive a Tomos Automatic. Their APN line is far supperior, built like a tank for Yugoslavian hills. People didn't have cars here in the 60's and 70's, so they made the Colibri and later APN models for people to become mobile. Great mopeds, which can easely be made to go 65mph.

These will take a lot more work, so unless you're wanting to be a part time mechanic, might do better to get a scooter like a Honda Helix or something.  You CAN find mopeds for $500 that don't need much work, but you'll need to go through it. If you can find one for $500 that fires right up, goes 25mph, and idles nicely, that's a good deal. If it won't idle, goes real slow, etc. you might pay less.  You'll probably need to learn to do your own work, I had the same idea as you months back and I didn't realize how much stuff I'd have to learn to get it going. Mine needed new tires, new chain, some carb parts were missing, petcock was leaking, and it needed new piston and cylinder boring. All of that takes a bit of time and $$$, but not too bad if you know what you're doing. If you're like me and don't know what you're doing, it ends up costing you like $500+ in parts and way too many hours. I bought a new carb and exhaust right off the bat, then I ended up buying a bunch of stuff I probably didn't need, but I'm a dummy and don't know how to do anything but hand over my credit card and install parts incorrectly.  A lot of people talk about getting these going for cheap, and that's possible, but it depends on your skill level. I'm near skill level 0, so if you're like me, it's more like a semi long term project."
moped,3dnbt9,lackofcoherence,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:56:17 2015 UTC,"I've done a lot of work on vintage Volkswagens, so I'm familiar with what it takes to keep aircooled vehicles going.  I'm definitely not harboring any idealistic dreams of never having to do any work. I know it'll require maintenance and upkeep and constant tweaking. It is something I'm thinking about a lot.  But that's why I'm wondering if the extra expense might be worth it. When buying vintage vehicles I've done everything from engine swaps, replacing fuel lines and fuel pumps, alternators and generators, serviced transmissions, cleaned fuel tanks, etc.   I don't want to start from scratch again because I definitely don't want to dump a ton of money in parts and maintenance from the beginning. I'd rather start with a reliable moped first and then replace parts as they fail over time (hopefully).  Do you think the prices are reasonable for overhauled mopeds? Also, I imagine it'd probably be smart to stay clear of the Batavus, from everything I've read on MopedArmy and this subreddit."
moped,3dnbt9,lackofcoherence,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:11:19 2015 UTC,"$900 might be a lot if it's totally stock, you can probably get a better deal for a running ped on craigslist for like $500. If you're patient, you can find one that's running nicely for like $500 for a Puch Maxi.   $2400 seems like a ton, unless it's been totally rebuilt and has racing carb, pipe, crank, and kit.  A lot of the ones on craigslist don't need much work, if it's in decent shape you should be able to do everything in short order. You might need a carb rebuild kit, new fuel line, spark plug, set the timing, adn you'll be good to go."

moped,3dnbt9,lackofcoherence,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:25:04 2015 UTC,"Denver and surrounding areas   How far out are you looking? Might use search tempest. It's worth a drive, I think I did a 180 mi round trip for mine, but I'd be willing to go even more for a decent deal.  I think it's good to get one that's been maintained and worked on, you'll be saving $$$ on not having to buy much to get it going. That way you can save up for projects here and there, while riding it all along.   I was inexperienced, plus the one I got hadn't been maintained at all. I probably spent too much, but I learned a lot and I'm making minor upgrades as I go (12mm to 15mm carb, expansion pipe, clamps instead of wedge bars, etc."
moped,3dnbt9,lackofcoherence,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:02:34 2015 UTC,"I'm OK with driving within 200 miles (maybe more) and driving it back. I called Moto Ocho about an hour ago and the red one is being sold and the Batavus is the only one left. If it were a Sachs G3 or Puch Magnum I'd jump on it. But anyway, looks like I'll have to buy one from a private seller.  And don't feel bad -- it happens to anyone that starts out with vintage vehicles. The good thing is that you learned and put in the hard work and now can help other people like myself who have questions!  Also, if it makes you feel any better, I bought a 1975 VW Bus for $2,400. I invested around $12,000 over 5 years before I sold it last year, and you can bet I didn't make much of that back. It is what it is."
moped,3dnbt9,cluecheck,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:20:04 2015 UTC,"If I were to do it all over again, I'd probably have done things a tad bit different. For one, I'd probably get it running stock before buying anything, no carb, no pipe, nada. I wish I'd FIRST taken everything apart to check out the condition BEFORE I went and bought a bunch of stuff. I kind got all shop happy and started buying before I needed to.  All I really needed to buy was a carb rebuild kit, tires, drive and pedal chain, new spark plug and wire, and new fuel line. I found that my piston and cylinder were trashed, so I could have just gotten the old cylinder fixed up and bought a new piston, instead I bought a new kit for $89. Guess you could say this was an upgrade, it's a high compression head, but still, not really necessary.  I bought a promo circuit pipe and 15mm carb up front, which isn't the worst idea, but I probably should have been spending my time and money on just getting it running nice first.  Once it was all stock and running, then I could have done one thing at a time. Instead, I'm always out there w/ like 10 things to do. Right now I need to put my clutch back in, clean out the broken off rope I jammed in the head (don't ask), change the jet, change some cone nuts, install new gears....not hard stuff, but lots of jobs. I could have made it easier on myself my just tackling one project at a time, and doing it in a smarter way."

The bat is crazy expensive because it's a sought after bike that is hard to find the wild.  If you want the less common version of the bat, find a Peugeot 103.  They both share the same french engine.   If you want something more reliable for travel find a honda scooter (elite, c70, ct90, etc), symba (the knock of the honda c70 passport but the same bike).  if you are sold on a moped, look for puch/tomos, honda hobbits (my fav, cheapest to make fast and pretty damn reliable and borderline scooter tech), motobecanes and peugeots are fun but wouldn't recommend diving into those first hand  also, maybe try to track down blk blk the gang in denver or hit up mopedarmy site for a WTB moped if they have some laying around they would get rid of.

Pull all that out, take the new one,  make sure you have some slack, put the knarp through the little tube and attach the slide plate.

You slip the cable through the hole where the outer cable slips in, and that little hole underneath the housing is supposed to have a screw to secure the cable. So, ultimately you have a knarpless throttle assembly.  Hope it's not stripped! -otherwise you will need a new one! Take it off to a hardware store with a good metric supply and see if you can get a screw for it. Then cut the big knarp off and slide it in.  Be careful with the cable cause if you fray it, it won't go through  the hole.   You have the more desired type of throttle depending if that hole is stripped, easier to make cables for since double knarped cables never fit correctly anyway. Easier to adjust these to spec.  Get one of these from harbor freight http://www.harborfreight.com/10-inch-heavy-duty-end-nipper-38496.html to cut the cable clean."

But if it starts and you can ride for a bit before it dies, and then it'll start up again after it's cooled down then I'd guess an air leak that's only showing up when everything is hot.

It seems like it is running much better right now. I cleaned the carb and air filter completely this morning the power is back for sure that I am used to. I will probably clean out the tank though when I can this weekend.  I think you are right about the air leak maybe though because if I ride it for a long time and it heats up it has trouble starting again. I might just get a new gasket set or material and redo them all. The bike is old and I'm sure could use it.

I only had a parts manual in German, so relied on Google translate in German websites to communicate with people outside of the United States to find parts that I needed. Waiting a month or more to get a part, only to find that I had somehow been sent the wrong thing, or somehow missed translated didn't receive the wrong part was very frustrating.  When my favorite things about the bike is actually who it came from. I purchased the moped at an estate sale after the death of a woman, who had no family to leave her Estate too. Along with the bike, as I said before I received the parts manual, which happen to have the original title tucked inside. The title was from Florida, and had written on it her husbands name, Paul D Wilson. I decided to look him up, and ended up finding him in both the Smithsonian Air and space Museum archives, as well as many articles in magazines online related to aviation.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas-Morse_S-4  He was one of the three original test pilots for the Thomas Moore's aviation company in the 1910s. He tested many planes particularly biplanes, that were later used with the Navy and Air Force. Through his travels, he somehow began buying lots of European bikes. He had a collection by the time that he died, and my 1957 DKW Hummel was one in his collection. Unfortunately I have not been able to find a picture of him with the bike, there aren't a lot of photos of him, I only have one.  My 1957 DKW Hummel is a 50cc, three speed manual transmission.

I'm a pilot, I have two mopeds (only one running atm) and a motorcycle, I find that aviation and 2 wheeled vehicles attract the same type of people, people who like mechanical things, things that require a competent operator to work successfully, and who like the feelings of freedom you only get from fun little machines like these. Sounds like he was a man who really lived, thanks for doing the research, this is really interesting and I'm sure Mr Wilson would be happy knowing his machine is being taken care of and used well"

moped,3de9et,Durfthesmurf,2,Wed Jul 15 16:19:11 2015 UTC,"I have a moped, two scooters, and 2 bicycles. The moped is more of a long-term fixer upper, whereas the scooter is more reliable. I'd say keep both, but expect the moped to take much more work.  I have a Vespa P200E, and the parts and design are more solid than on the moped. You CAN make the moped more reliable, but I think it's just way more work. With a scooter, I can still get all original Vespa parts from a Vespa dealership, so that's a plus. With mopeds, you're having to get these aftermarket parts w/ questionable finishes, they may not fit, etc. It also seems like a hack job w/ a lot of the moped stuff, whereas I can order Vespa parts by number, and my local dealership has all parts in stock for Vespas as old as 1960s.   For example, for the clutch on a Vespa, you simply order a kit and rebuild it. For a moped, it's like some kind of freaking black magic to choose the right type of springs, you have to weigh the parts and somehow by magic figure out how to make it work. It's kinda nuts to me, there are just too many options and it's overwhelming not being a mechanic myself. I think that's part of the moped fun, but that's why it's more a long-term thing."
moped,3de9et,lackofcoherence,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:04:17 2015 UTC,"Just recently gave up my bike for a scooter, here's my two cents.  I wanted a two wheeled rider than I could depend on to commute to work every day.  I wanted to log many more hours riding than fixing.  I looked into mopeds but the advice on Reddit seemed to say, If you don't have time and passion to constantly fuck with your moped, don't get one.  I looked at getting a motorcycle and new ones cost a lot while the vintage ones I absolutely love have problems, parts shortages, and again need a lot of attention.    I got a 150cc Vespa used for 1300 and I regret nothing.  I bled the brakes myself, it was super easy.  It's a 2005 so the parts are everywhere.  It tops out around 55mph which is plenty fast for the city. Plenty of storage space under the seat and on the milk crate in the back. It starts every time too, has electric and kick.  It takes gas, I don't have to mix it with oil.  Easy peezy.   I think I made the right decision for my budget and my needs.  The scooter was the perfect center of a Venn diagram of reliability, price, maintenance, and many other things.  But everyone's budget and needs are different."

I own a honda rebel now, and that does not have neither the power nor the smooth handling the helix had. I took the helix on the freeway with zero problems. highly recommended.  That is WAY too much for a cheap 50cc scooter.  That ebing said, I also owned a 150cc chinese scooter. I never had a problem with the engine, other than the starter dying, because I changed the oil often and ran a high quality oil, however everything else on it fell apart. plastic cracked, little windows showing the brake fluid cracked and dribbled fluid everywhere, etc.  I would pick up a beater for $200-$300 to fart around on, but no way would i pay $640 for one.

These are easy to fix up, you just need to go through the fuel system, fix the clutch, spark plug, etc. You can get bangin good deals on these.

For brands it's the same as on the sidebar- Tomos makes very reliable bikes that work great as commuters. For anyone, especially a big guy, I would suggest getting some upgrades to better keep up with traffic. A pipe and carb will get you comfortably riding the average city street at pace with cars and if that's not enough a kit will get you riding over the bridges. The latter can take a tole on reliability and requires a little more mechanical know-how- so I'd start with a pipe and work your way up."

moped,3d8e4d,lackofcoherence,-1,Tue Jul 14 09:21:47 2015 UTC,"Lots of people get mopeds for way cheap and they run well. Sidebar has recommended brands. I got a Puch, but I've not done anything mechanical before, so it's been a money pit for me. If you're mechanically inclined, you can do it for less. Also to get it up to 40mph, which is needed for commuting, you will need some modifications. If you have $1000+ to spend, you could fix up an old puch, or you could just get a cheap used and running scooter or motorcycle. After my experience, I'd say mopeds are mostly weekend fun toys, unless you really put in the time to fix up everything on the moped. It's a long term project for people who like to tool and figure stuff out."
moped,3d8e4d,robotmoss,2,Tue Jul 14 09:36:08 2015 UTC,"Also not true in my opinion. I spent 200 bucks and my e50 goes 40-43mph on a flat. It's all about widening the ports, carb/ intake, gearing and pipe. Not that hard if you can read a port map. Granted it took me 4 years now of playing mopeds to get this far... I wish I was better too, if I could play derbi or hobbit I would build a 60mph ripper and yes then it would get pretty expensive.   Another note to think about is most of the older bikes were hand built so sometimes you just get a tomos that will do 40 stock for some odd reason. Sometimes you'll get the exact same bike that does 25... All depends. Playing mopeds is a great hobby for people who work on them and for commuters yes it can be a money pit."

moped,3d5i44,drsfmd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:29:28 2015 UTC,Yes it is different that is the old one that would not fit.  The current one still has the same problem and its mainly the design of the tank that causes it.
moped,3d564p,acidnine420,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:41:36 2015 UTC,Gas doesn't get old. Especially in that time.
moped,3d564p,alcalinebattery,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:16:58 2015 UTC,"Since the tank has an inline filter, there is always about 1/4 of an inch in the tank, even though the tank acts empty.

moped,3d564p,thejobbitt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:59:27 2015 UTC,"Fuel filter is an inline filter, so I only see problems when my tank gets low (an empty tank usually still has 1/4"" of fuel floating around).  The oddest part is that at EXACTLY 25mph this happens, no matter what jet I put in there.  I had took the intake assembly and reeds out to make sure they all looked good (there was an airleak at one point in this spot), so that was lined with permatex red and hasn't leaked since."

moped,3d5oi4,triplefreshpandabear,2,Mon Jul 13 20:18:38 2015 UTC,"I used to teach teenage boys mechanics at a summer camp and I told them the four strokes (although the same principle applies to two strokes) of an engine in a way that teenage boys will remember, the engine needs to suck, squeeze, bang and blow, and if it isn't doing one of those things, there's the problem, you're getting the squeeze (compression) getting the bang (spark) and the blow (air through the engine, so that leaves the suck, now it needs to suck air and fuel, you can assume it's getting air since it's turning, spray some carb cleaner in and then turn it over, if it fires a bit then sputters out when the carb spray is used up, then you can assume it's not getting fuel cause when you gave it outside fuel it worked, but isn't working otherwise. This is the most common problem when engines sit, because any fuel left in them lacquers and gums up the small ports and jets, a good cleaning should be all it needs"
moped,3d5oi4,triplefreshpandabear,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:28:07 2015 UTC,I learned engines as a teenager on 4 strokes as well. You already sound like a better teacher than mine though.   I'd been assuming that fuel flow isn't a problem because the plug comes out wet after turning it over a few times. A cleaning still sounds like a good plan.

Yes, really, that simple.   As a solution, I took out the switch and replaced the spring in the rocker with a spring from a ballpoint pen that provided a little bit of a stronger force. That fixed it right up and the rocker was good as new."

moped,3d39g9,l8terboss,2,Mon Jul 13 16:23:59 2015 UTC,is the gas tank rusted inside at all? I'd take the petcock off and clean that as well for sure to start along with the fuel line coming from it. Also do you premix or use an oil injector?  For parts mopedjunkyard has quite a few of the stranger things that are hard to find replacements for and treatland has a ton of stuff that will work with an a3 that is more typical parts.

moped,3d2v1y,crackercrumb,2,Mon Jul 13 03:34:26 2015 UTC,"Well it's getting spark now. I had to pull the points arm off the little swivel post thing and clean that up, sanded it a little with some fine grit sand paper, was 600 I think, and put it back together and now it springs back like its supposed to an now I'm getting spark to the plug. I believe I got the timing set right, as best as I could without proper tools atleast, but still no start. I cleaned the carb a couple weeks ago and cleaned out the gas line as well. Fuel does come out of the line when I disconnect it from the carb. I believe its getting fuel to the cylinder but I'm not 100%. Any ideas?"
moped,3d2v1y,BurkeyTurger,2,Mon Jul 13 15:39:27 2015 UTC,"OK, got it running. Ended up the jet in the carb was clogged. Thought I had cleared it out before but I guess I didn't. But it runs now. I did notice a problem. When it's idling an not on the gas, when I hit the breaks to turn the brake light on it kills the motor. Is the stater not putting out enough power or something?"
moped,3d2v1y,metroidpwner,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:29:42 2015 UTC,Are you certain it is the brake light that is killing the motor? I have a 2000 Targa LX and had to play with the idle screw for a while for it not to die when I came to a stop (it would idle fine upon first start). Also yeah carb jets can be sneaky :)
moped,3d2v1y,ninjasays,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:15:24 2015 UTC,That's one of the things I was going to mess with tomorrow. It would seem to idle fine then it would die when I pulled the brake lever. I'll tinker with it more. Need to adjust the timing as well I think since it bogs down when I give it some gas before it picks up.

moped,3cz5ty,romanista,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:13:25 2015 UTC,"Stock motorcycle is WAY more reliable than any kitted moped.    I did a spring tune-up on the motorcycle and haven't touched it since.  But I was working on the moped on a weekly basis for the same amount of riding.  Mopeds were meant to do 20-30 mph.  Doing 50+ mph was pushing the limit of the engine case and other components when it was reaching 10,000+ RPMs."
moped,3cz5ty,alexthebeast,2,Mon Jul 13 00:22:45 2015 UTC,"yup, I'm kinda regretting the moped at this point. I bought it 9 months ago, because I didn't need an endorsement, insurance, or anything else. Since then, I got my endorsement.   I think the moped is basically a hobby money pit. Just getting it up and running has been crazy, and once it's done, mine will likely go like 30mph.  Lesson learned, I'll be trying to sell the moped and get a motorcycle. Funny thing, I'll probably just have to take the motorcycle to a shop, I don't know how much I can really tool on that thing.  I think tooling is a waste unless you're fairly well off to afford all the tools, and you have a garage to work in. I'm broke, live in an apartment in the city, and I owned 0 tools before buying the moped. I got the moped in an attempt to save money. I thought it would just be a carb clean, and I could slowly work on other things as I wanted. I thought it would be a cheap, reliable commuter. Turns out, I was dead wrong, and I should have gone w/ a cheap scooter or a motorcycle.   Mopeds are cool for weekends, pure hobby, not for commuting. I wish I'd figured that out before I dumped so many hours and hundreds of dollars into it."

moped,3cz59q,Helpless_Indulgent,2,Sun Jul 12 02:38:49 2015 UTC,I would go with stock.  One of the main drawbacks to Grandes are the carbs.  More than likely it is only the stock carb (I think 13mm) and all the extra work won't amount to as much without the carb being bigger.  The main reason for that is the limited space in the frame.   I vote stock.  But I would think that it should be more than $200 cheaper.
moped,3cz59q,Buck_ABM,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:48:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback.  I wish I could see the list of mods again without alerting him that the ad is expired.  I think it mentioned an upgraded carb.  I think it was 13.13 or something.  Does that make sense?

moped,3cz59q,Drinksmith,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:19:16 2015 UTC,A 13:13 is the biggest carb you can put on any vespa without getting upgraded cases.  A stock grande carb is a 12:10 if I recall correctly.
moped,3cz59q,Buck_ABM,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:37:03 2015 UTC,"Mine had a 13.13... If it had any mods, that would have been the only one.  Some states, like Ohio, limited the HP (in order to keep them ""slow enough"") by decreasing the carb size, or inserted cylinder intake sleeves.   Either way... For a kitted and piped bike, a 13.13 carb is the weakest point on the bike. I still stand with buying the stock Grande instead."

moped,3czhf2,lackofcoherence,2,Sun Jul 12 04:47:54 2015 UTC,"Fasteners will not make a difference if you are threading them into aluminum. The torque spec for aluminum is 7lb or under. You should use the hardest cylinder studs you can find. You can usually get 8.8 but if you can 10.9 would be the best. Zink coated is fine for anything on a moped. If you want it not to rust you can go with stainless but its  over kill on a moped if you ask me. There are some places that will need thrust washers in the engine, those you have to replace with the same. (thrush washer = very hardened washer) I usually use some high temp thread locker on the bottoms of the cylinder studs and tighten until just beyond snug. Sounds like you will have to drill and tap and then go over sized stud or helicoil."

I have a moped too, I'm going to try this on the Puch Newport next. The same ideas still apply. I've just watched so many stupid videos and read too many stupid ideas.  I think the discussion on moped army is way too in depth, and it leaves you with way too many options. Some of their options are just dumb, like coating the inside of the tank. No freaking new car or motorcycle has a lined tank, so why line an old one?  http://www.mopedarmy.com/wiki/Removing_rust_from_a_gas_tank  I think an initial scrubbing, then a naval jelly soak, then a vinegar soak is easy and it works great. Plus it's not some stupid week long process.  Obviously one issue is scrubbing, so instead of a toilet brush you'll need a pipe cleaner of some kind."

moped,3cjx4e,countvoncastro,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:37:23 2015 UTC,"This tank started out as super nasty with a bunch of red pepper flakes, and super thick rust everywhere. I first started by scrubbing w/ a toilet brush using lemon and salt over and over until it came out mostly clean. Then I scrubbed in a bottle of naval jelly. Finally I did an apple cider vinegar soak overnight.  I didn't have enough vinegar (obviously), so I'll repeat my entire process again, but of course topping off w/ vinegar, and finishing off w/ a bottle of rubbing alcohol to stop the flash rust.  I'd say forget all the expensive chemicals, the tank liners, and the nuts/bolts inside the tank. It seems like a little scrubbing, mixing with several rounds of soaking can get your tank completely clean.   Vinegar is like $5/gal and naval jelly is $6/bottle. I'm probably in for about $30-$40 for the tank cleaning. Mine was extremely nasty, so if you have less rust you may not need to go so much."
moped,3cjx4e,countvoncastro,2,Wed Jul 8 14:23:25 2015 UTC,"Never ever use nuts and bolts because it leaves scratches in the tank that will re rust and cause pin holes.  Also tank liners suck and ruin you motor. I've actively ignored craigslist posts that say ""coated the tank"" because it's usually done incorrectly and after time the compound wears away and adds to carbon build up/ complete fuckery in the top end/ exhaust ports."
moped,3cjx4e,robotmoss,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:08:01 2015 UTC,"agreed, I think the soak to get bare metal is the way to go. Doing multiple soaks is all that's needed for heavy rust, followed w/ WD40 or rubbing alcohol to stop the flash rust.  Navel jelly is pretty great, it got a ton of the really heavy rust off that my scrubbing couldn't do.  Liners make no sense to me, once you get the rust out, and keep it filled w/ gas, it shouldn't rust more."

My tac lead only has one red wire and I've tried varying the number of wraps, adding a resister 1 kohm-500 kohm, adding a choke, and wiring directly to the the coil. The rpm readings would jump 200-1000 and were more sporadic at higher rpm. Maybe my points need servicing."

moped,3cdea5,jpah333,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:14:16 2015 UTC,Could be a number of things. May be soft seizing. Check the plug and if it's white and dry disconnect the oil injector (they're failure prone on many Tomos' with auto oil injection) and plug up the hole on the carb inlet and start mixing oil in with your gas. Hopefully you haven't damaged the cylinder and piston to the point where they need to be replaced.   If it's not soft seizing my next guess is that it may be the jet in the carb getting clogged up. Clean it and see how it runs.   If it was a points system id say it's a condenser but there weren't Targa LX's that came with points.

It looks as if you're bike uses a chinese made honda-derived 4 stroke engine. This engine type is very common in a lot of chinese made bikes and bikes with underbone frames. There are plenty of parts available, and there is a lot of information available on the internet as well.  I do not know a lot about troubleshooting these 4 stroke engines, but your best bet would be to take the carb apart to clean it and make sure your throttle assembly is in there properly. Try to figure out if you are running the correct jet size, it sounds like you may need to downjet.   If that doesn't work I wouldn't want to spend too much money on trying to fix it.

moped,3c5aqn,GideonWyeth,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:38:22 2015 UTC,"Good tip. I'll order new hex clutch cover screws and new drain bolt. I'll put on a new clutch cover gasket too. If that doesn't work I'll try the chalk idea. I'm guessing it's something I'm going to replace, I haven't opens the clutch cover since buying it, and everything else has been in terrible condition, so I expect the same here."
moped,3c5aqn,GideonWyeth,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:52:32 2015 UTC,"honestly i wouldn't waste your time with the gasket you'll find online because they're quite thin, if you can go to your local autozone/advance and get the water pump gasket material (blue) it's thicker so you'll have to tighten the clutch cable a little but it does a better job at preventing wicking of fluid than the standard paper gasket.  the pain in the butt will be cutting it because it is thick but it usually lasts longer in my experience and can be re-used in a pinch instead of having to cut a new one every time.  there's no real reason to replace the screws themselves but the crush gasket ring on the drain plug is just copper and seals like garbage, i went to Ace Hardware and got a rubber o-ring that fit snugly around the screw and tightened it down and it seemed to work.  same for the drain plug, unless the threads are stripped id say just get an o-ring, no reason to replace the screw itself.    this is just my advice based on my experience though, not knowing the condition of your hardware i could be wrong and it could warrant replacement but this is just my personal experience and I hope it helps."
moped,3c5aqn,GideonWyeth,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:09:42 2015 UTC,"thanks for the tip. I've thought about replacing all gaskets with custom made ones, I just don't trust the paper garbage that they sell. I recently pulled off the exhaust gasket, I'd sprayed it real heavy w/ copper spray a gasket, they stuff still burned up. I'd really only turned the moped on a couple times to test it out, I'm really confused how this happened. I just got a set for the 50cc treats party pack head, the gasket doesn't really match up with the cylinder so well.   I'm just nervous about my screws, some much of the stuff on the moped is trashed, I'd feel a lot better getting something new. I've had to replace busted cone nuts, rusted and stripped cylinder nuts, and man I'd hate to strip that freaking drain bolt, I'd be kicking myself forever for going cheap.   you'll have to tighten the clutch cable a little   why would I have to do that? What does the clutch cable have to do w/ the clutch cover gasket? I need a new knarp anyway, the clutch cable is too long."
moped,3c5aqn,robotmoss,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:56:08 2015 UTC,"The clutch cable thing is because the way the starter clutch engages is by rotating a flat sided pin, with the gap between the engine case and the clutch cover increased even though very slightly, it means the pin has to rotate more before the radius of it will hit the plate.   When replacing gaskets I know this part may seem ridiculous to mention but i say it anyway because I have witnessed it been done, do NOT put any kind of material between the case halves, only use a sealant, the case halves are machine to meet exactly and any added material between them makes the bearing surfaces oblonged meaning the bearing will have play and bang around.  My recommendation which is widely agreed upon is yamabond, you should be able to get it at any power-sports or Yamaha dealer locally or of course online. It seals much more strongly and with better coverage than rtv and holds up to chemicals much more durably. Always use a thicker gasket material for the base gasket between the cylinder and case because you have two case halves meeting perpendicularly to the cylinder and the odds a gasket as thin as paper is going to account for any alight imperfection is slim.  Now my bad advice, in a pinch I've used folded over aluminum foil for an exhaust gasket, rtv doesn't hold up well right on a manifold for long and fiberous material will catch fire, moat gaskets you'll notice are crushable metal-fiber combinations but I have yet to see that material in stores so I use folded foil since it can be compresses and can take the heat.  However it's not ideal for long term because its thin and flimsy and eventually pressure will force gasses between the layers and the material will eventually degrade/blow away."

I've tried for hours all kinds of ways to grab the nut to get it off, but it's just spinning and not moving at all...."
moped,3bydmt,acidnine420,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:04:02 2015 UTC,"If it's spinning freely and still not coming out, a bolt extractor kit will only work if you can grip the bolt head and drill at the same time.  (Most kits are designed for stripped or broken heads, not threads)  You will need to find a vise grip that can reach it, lock onto it, and be able to turn and pull.  Worst case scenario is that it will need to be able to hold the bolt head with enough clearance to allow you to drill straight into the head and partially into the bolt itself. Using a left hand thread extractor it should bite well enough to allow you to pull harder to break or strip the final thread or two that is holding the bolt in place.  Because that's what's happening.  All other threads failed but one or one and a half, just enough to hold it in, but not be able to advance or retreat through the hole.  So you'll need enough force to make that last one fail.  You could also end up with a surprise where that single thread is, the bolt might be snapped just under it.  Then you'll still need the bolt extractor to get that out.  Good luck!  Keep us posted!"

I'm not personally familiar with Hobbits, but I understand that they are very similar to Vespas/TFRs. Putting a new belt on my first TFR made a very noticeable difference for me.  Are there any other differences or symptoms you're noticing aside from the top speed?"
moped,3bryef,rawrchitect,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:55:42 2015 UTC,Well i have gained weight lol but its my girlfriends moped.  She ways 100 pounds wet. I weigh 165 but we both get the same top speed its like it just hits a wall. Sometimes downhill you can feel it pull a little bit but other than that it just flat lines at 21.  I do know the belt is looser then it should be its an older belt so changing that could help out.  And i should try to clean the exhaust too its just that when i got it it was doing 30 then it sat for awhile i just didnt think it would build up that much without riding it. Thanks alot!
moped,3bryef,eobanb,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:07:41 2015 UTC,Is it fully variating?
moped,3bryef,theforerunner343,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:07:53 2015 UTC,I do believe it is. It pushes the belt to the top
moped,3bryef,TheMellowestyellow,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:02:09 2015 UTC,How does it act when you ride it?  Are you feeling overall loss of power or just towards to top?  Does it make any odd or different sounds? What do you notice between how it runs now and how it ran before?
moped,3bryef,BlinginLike3p0,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:51:21 2015 UTC,The moped is smooth all the way to 21. It accelerates very well fastest one to 20 i got. The the only wierd sound is just the belt slapping aginst the case. And the only noticeable difference is the speed. Thanks!

Of course he won't tell you if he seized the engine. I'd say $300 is fair, that would cover the cost of a kit, carb rebuild parts, fuel line, spark plug and boot, and new cables.

Ride like everybody is out to kill you.  7: Make sure theres no rust. See if it starts. If it doesnt start, dont pay more then $300 for it.   8: Backpack? Milk crate on the rack? Not many options there."
moped,3bpw45,TheMellowestyellow,2,Wed Jul 1 06:29:54 2015 UTC,"Depends on the moped. My Hobbit's official weight limit is 180 lbs (although I'm sure it could probably handle more weight). My newer Tomos has a limit of around 300 lbs. cc is cubic centimeters, the volume of the cylinder. Depends on how hard it's raining. If it's drizzling, my full-face helmet keeps rain off any part of my head and if I've thought to wear my raincoat and rain pants I stay quite dry. Mopeds that do best in rain are ones with CDI, all the stock sidecovers and fenders, and new tires. Look up your state/province/country's laws I have a few different locks that I use depending on which moped I'm riding and where I'm going. Sometimes a U-lock can work well if you can get it around the moped frame; other times a big thick chain lock is best. There's plenty of other options too, like a keyed ignition, fork lock, hidden killswitch, etc. Full-face helmet. Ride defensively. Make sure your brakes work well. Use street tires. See the sidebar I have a Wald 582 folding basket on one of my mopeds (fits a canvas bag of groceries quite well), and a small wooden crate on the back of another (fits two six-packs great). Bungee cords also help. I think enclosed trunks look kind of dumb, at least on mopeds."
moped,3bpw45,eobanb,2,Wed Jul 1 14:35:40 2015 UTC,"Look up state laws. My state requires plates and helmet, no insurance required. I have the big kryptonite chain, I lock it to a pole in the middle of a major city. It is probably good advice to get liability insurance even though the state may not require it. Also, keep your moped covered with a Nelson rigg cover so people can't see it (but they can see my fat chain lock).  Wear a rain jacket and be sure you have good tires. I've ridden in rain a lot, it's no big deal. I'm a year round rider, you just need the right gear and practice.  For safety, always wear full face helmet, must be DOT approved. Disc brakes, good brake cables, good tires, and good gear. Also, you can die going 30mph, so best to wear all the gear, even though most people don't.  You might want to take the MSF course like I did. I ride bigger cc things too, but the safety stuff still applies. If you can get up to 40mph, you are def at risk for major injury or death.   I don't think people talk about safety enough. If you're getting a used moped, change the tires, brake lines, and brake shoes. Take time to adjust the brakes properly. I'm thinking about upgrading to disc brakes from drum brakes for safety reasons."

moped,3bg35n,lackofcoherence,2,Mon Jun 29 04:26:34 2015 UTC,"Yup. $500 on moped, $100 on carb, $100 on exhaust, tires and tubes, chain, chain puller, timing tool, new bars, brake pads, cable set, triple tree top, new switches, air filter, fuel line and filter, petcock. Over $600 in parts, then I spent hundreds in tools. I could have done some things cheaper, kept stock pipe, somehow fixed the wedge nut, set timing with screwdriver only. I'm choosing to upgrade and buy tools, def not all necessary. But yeah, price a chain and chain breaker, or check what it costs to mount a tire, you'll see how things add up. I'm also including shipping and tax, I had to spend $40 on a rental van to pick up the moped. It's going to be worth it though, it's starting to look nice and I'm feeling more comfortable tooling on this, as I've started to learn most of the thing.   Costs will go up still, I need a new kit since the cylinder and piston are damaged. I'm going to buy a higher series of jets. I need a new rear swing arm to fit wider tires. I need to grind down or buy a new front fender. I'd like to replace the points. I want to pull the clutch and see what needs replacing. My project this winter will be a race crank, new bearings. Next year I'll slap on a 70cc kit, maybe another pipe. Then I might get a bigger carb.

moped,3bgjbp,IronicFrenchMustache,2,Mon Jun 29 01:08:34 2015 UTC,"That's what I hoped too, but it hasn't turned out like that. I bought my Puch Newport about 8 months back for $500, in running condition. I watched the guy ride it up the road, he was going real slow though.  Here's what I've found so far:   half the parts were missing in the carb. I decided to buy a new 15mm Bing rather than buy the parts to fix the old 12mm Bing The wedge nut for the handlebars were stripped. Instead of trying to get a new wedge, I opted to buy a new triple tree top and bars. This was a welcome upgrade anyway. Switches were no good. They had rusted out, so I had to buy a couple on ebay, about $25 each switch. The petcock was leaking. Had to replace that I regreased the bearings yesterday, the back wheel though was bad. The cone nuts were ground down and the cup built into the wheel was ground down. I put in new bearings and grease, but it's still no good. I'll probably just buy new cone nuts for now and get new wheels later. Tires were dry rotted, so I got new ones. I thought they'd just slip right on, but they don't fit on the front fender or rear swing arm. I'll probably have to grind down the front fender a bit, and maybe get a new swingarm to fit wider tires. I put a new chain on too short, so the wheel is already a bit forward (it's about as far forward as it can go). I'll probably have to buy another chain, but I might wait until it's absolutely necessary, like with new gears or swingarm.   You might get lucky and just need a carb clean, or you could be like me and continue to find problems every time you work on it. I've bought over $600 in parts (several upgrades though), and I'm still not riding.  I'm being patient, eventually I'll have gotten enough down that I can ride, then I can upgrade some more in the winter."

I think doing this again, I'd say if something is running, but in nasty looking shape, don't pay more than like $200. You could just be buying the frame...  However, lots of people end up replacing everything anyway, so having to trash the handlebars, wheels, carb, and exhaust isn't really a big deal. Buying performance parts is kind of why there's interest in mopeds.   I guess if you're wanting something purely for cheap transport, I'd get a Chinese/GY6 scooter. I've learned a lot working through this moped, and it's been an excellent experience. I'm now rebuilding a couple of old Vespas, and the experience is much easier. Mopeds are a great way to learn about small engines. Plus, it's really rewarding to work on this thing. It looks cool too, got a nice gold chain, black drop bars, new air filter, new tires -- it's looking good!  I'm thinking too, I'm catching up on 30 years of deferred maintenance, so once I get through all of this, I should have years of minimal work."

moped,3bgjbp,d3k4y,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:17:30 2015 UTC,"It seems like a moped in good running order that's had all broken things fixed is worth more like $1000, at least that's what I see on craigslist."
moped,3bhdk0,warghuul,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:04:12 2015 UTC,"A variator is a type of CVT. It uses a belt and pulleys that can change effective diameter by squeezing together the two halves and causing the belt to ride higher or lower, in order to change the drive ratio.  Non-variated mopeds lack this mechanism, so they either have a single-speed transmission or discrete gears. A Kinetic TFR would be single-speed unless someone has swapped on a Vespa variator."
moped,3bhdk0,eobanb,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:08:14 2015 UTC,Hold off until you have the bike before you start buying parts for it.  If I remember correctly the Kinetic Crank may have a different taper to it than the Vespa one so a normal Vespa clutch may not fit unless you swap your crank.

moped,3bbl0b,fractuss,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:02:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on the show, but most shows will have a class for motorcycles and/or a ""special interest"" class for vehicles that don't fit neatly into any other class (race cars, military, police, kit cars, etc.).

moped,3bcnyd,killpony,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:28:12 2015 UTC,I guess first decide what kind of build this is going to be. Stock? Near-stock? Performance? Ludicrous 60 mph build? How much money are you willing to spend?
moped,3bcnyd,eobanb,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:34:17 2015 UTC,"I've got a pretty good handle on that already. I'm going with a low/mid daily blaster with enough top speed (45-50) to get me over city bridges with traffic. I intent to replace almost everything but the wheels, case and clutch (though I will upgrade springs at shoes) with fabrication on the tank, frame and seat/ any bits that I need to make fit. I'm not sure on cost exactly because I know I have a ton of work on all the bits but I'd like to keep the kit/carb/pipe combo around 450 -500. My main thing is how do I make sure my pipe and carb are correctly sized for my kit?"
moped,3bcnyd,eobanb,2,Mon Jun 29 00:10:02 2015 UTC,"Well, in my experience you can do a lot of different combinations of parts and still make it work OK.  For a Minarelli V1 it's hard to go wrong with Polini's 47mm kit; it bolts right up with no case modification needed. A friend of mine ran his with a 14.12 Dellorto SHA for some reason, and it did fine. To me that went to show you can run a very small carb on a huge kit and it's really not a big deal.  I'd say if you got an 80cc Polini and ran it with a 16 SHA, that would be simple to tune and rip pretty hard. Maybe not quite as hard as a TM24 or whatever, but 45 mph will be absolutely no problem, and you can put the money you save not buying an expensive intake and carb on a nice pipe, which brings me to...  ...the MLM People's sidebleed is a great choice for most setups; it's much less expensive than most of MLM's other pipes but still an excellent exhaust. I have a Honda version on my Hobbit and there's basically nothing I dislike about it‚Äîbolts right up, high-quality construction, solid performance.  $172 for the Polini kit and $190 for the MLM sidebleed totals $362; staying in a $500 budget leaves you with $138 for a 16 SHA, jets, air filter, and intake.  Hope that helps. I look forward to your updates!"
moped,3bcnyd,eobanb,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:00:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice!-the 80cc polini was what I was thinking but Dang that is a mother of a pipe. I might start with an estoril or some other not quite so expensive/sexy thing- realizing I need to to replace a few more parts than I bargained for. One day...

It's basically impossible to change a tire with anything less, and trying to will just tear up your rim edges and probably pop your tube.   to put the new tires on, definitely try the zip tie trick, again it makes your life 1000x easier.

I think it is the carb just getting clogged up, I will look into swapping it for something better it does seem very simple but it is fairly easy to work on at least. I'll do a full clean this weekend when I have time. I also noticed today the tank has some rust in it so cleaning that out and the petcock might help too. It runs great once it is going and will start first or second kick usually when I first start it, I don't feel a lack of power or anything it only gives out once I get wherever I'm going and try to get it started again to go back and I'll have to pop the jet out before it will go. To get it to idle I had to adjust the jet fairly loose but it does idle now. I'll take a look at the points and condenser too it is just strange it will work first kick if I haven't ridden it yet for the day. Thank you guys for the replies though"

If it is, you need to get rid of all the bends/kinks in the cable.

moped,3au2hd,paraarm,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:20:23 2015 UTC,"No, the oil in the gas will keep the slide lubed. You should put a couple drops in the cable though."
moped,3au2hd,paraarm,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:39:38 2015 UTC,"Would that make a big difference? I mean, this thing is really stuck. When I roll on the the throttle, it barely moves back. It seems like there is some major friction in the system, but everything seems ok to me. I've taken the cable on and off a couple of times, took the carb apart a couple of times, and I'm just not seeing the issue here.  How well does a throttle cable snap back on a moped? I know on a motorcycle it's instant, but I'm not sure if I should expect the same thing here.   I thought cables came lubed up though? When you say put a few drops, I thought the standard was to use aerosol lube, and you need one of those lube ports or tools to do it."
moped,3au2hd,paraarm,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:59:35 2015 UTC,"Throttle recoil is a result of the spring above the slide and/or the throttle control itself. The Magnum, for example, has a higher end magura throttle that will spring back itself. If you have taken the cable off and it is still hard to slide through the cable, oil it. With oil, not whatever aerosol you are wasting time with. Some cables even come with a port to open and drop oil into. If that doesn't fix it, replace the cable and its sheath. It is a moped, get used to replacing parts or not riding it."

Not sure why you say aerosol is a waste, but yeah just plain oil can work too. I thought about giving the cable a nice soak in a bath of oil. I'll try to lube up the magura plastic, and maybe throw some oil in the metal bendy thing that goes to the carb.  I'll try oil, then I'll replace the plastic throttle thing. Too bad though, I just put on new grips.  Don't be a dick, I'm well aware I need to replace everything. Thus far I've replace the pipe, carb, fuel line, fuel filter, all cables, brake shoes, tires and tubes, handlebars, triple tree top, and spark plug and wire. I'm just working my way down the list.

moped,3anpt9,nowj,2,Mon Jun 22 18:31:51 2015 UTC,"That's a very different setup than a stock Garelli.  Some amount of blowback is pretty normal on a VM20 (and matching intake presumably), especially on a piston port cylinder. 20mm is gigantic compared to a stock carburetor.  A decent foam filter will help prevent you from losing as much fuel from blowback.  150 psi is on the high side, although still in the relatively normal range. If you have a high-compression head that would explain why your compression is on the high side.  You could put on a different cylinder head if you wanted to lower the compression a bit and make your moped a bit easier to start. You could probably get one with a decompression valve to make it even easier."

moped,3am2hs,tuttlecr,3,Sun Jun 21 15:40:37 2015 UTC,Sounds a little overfilled to me. A lot of people add a little more then what it calls for so they can have first gear hold out a little longer so second will come in on the pipe better. If your fluid is at the right level and you are using the standard type F then I would say check your clutches for excessive wear.
moped,3am2hs,sweatlizard,2,Sun Jun 21 16:40:22 2015 UTC,I'll try again and measure the exact amount rather than then the fill bolt and report back. Could be a little over full. Praying the clutch isn't worn out because I'm a bit new to all this.   Thanks for the tip.

moped,3aj3pl,acidnine420,3,Sat Jun 20 21:41:30 2015 UTC,"Performance is great, way better than stock.  Upgrading everything improves the performance across the whole speed range, but it does kick you in the pants when the pipe comes in above 20mph.  The acceleration does lag a little between when the clutch locks and when the pipe comes in, so I'll probably install the blue Malossis this winter.  Top speed so far is about 35, but I'm still sneaking up on the jetting from the rich side, so there may be a few more mph in it. Intake works great, only downside is that it doesn't seem to generate enough vacuum to operate the automatic petcock so you have to remember to turn it to the PRIME position before starting it, but it's not that big of a deal.  The other thing is that the intake is awesomely loud. Once you're rolling, it'll happily do 25 at 1/4 throttle and just makes a quiet buzz, but mash the throttle and WAAAAAAHHHH!  Glorious."
moped,3aj3pl,xxmickeymoorexx,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:33:50 2015 UTC,"35?  I would have expected more, you might just be too rich on your jets still.  Also a vacuum petcock is probably not the best solution, it's great that you can bypass it with a prime option."

The one thing I didn't do to the motor was make a rev plate, so I'll put that on the list for this winter.  The 60cc kit has bigger ports than stock, but the same shitty placement, so a rev plate should help.

moped,3aj3pl,ntmera,2,Sun Jun 21 00:45:36 2015 UTC,"Way lower melting temperature, 750F versus 1200F.  I can melt zinc in a stainless bowl or steel can on a $9 hot plate.  Aluminum would need a dedicated furnace.  Obviously, lower melting temp works against you on a cylinder or head where you need higher temp resistance, but it was ok for the intake.

Sometimes a moped will show its true colors after it reaches maximum temp.   If everything on the bike works it's at least worth $400. Make sure there's no funny business going on and the owner can give you a receipt of some kind (needed if you intend to get plates in Ohio). Take a can of penetrating oil spray with you (WD40, PBBLASTER). While the bike is idling, if the owner will let you, spray around the gaskets/seams. If you notice any changes in RPM caused by that you know it's got air leaks and will need new gaskets/sealer.  It could be worth $600, its a popular bike with some desirable features (top tank).

moped,39rg6q,eobanb,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:47:57 2015 UTC,"Exhaust:  On an A55 the exhaust is probably the biggest restriction on speed, so even a Biturbo does surprisingly well. An exhaust being 4 or 40 years old doesn't really matter unless it's clogged or rusted out, neither of which is probably the case for yours. The Biturbo is also more of a top-end pipe, so if you're aiming for higher top speed, I'd just keep it for now.  Kit:  Obviously a 70cc kit will get you a lot more speed, but it also takes way more tinkering and more money. For now, I'd skip the kit; hitting mid-40s on an A55 with a stock cylinder isn't too difficult.  Instead:  I'd say the next-biggest restriction on speed (after the exhaust) on an A55 is gearing. The A55 is geared pretty low, so a re-gear will easily get you higher top speed, at the cost of some acceleration off the line, but with no other changes to your setup needed and no decrease in reliability. A mild re-gear will probably put you at about 40 mph; if you live in a really flat area, you could go with pretty tall gearing and go 45.  To compensate somewhat for your slower acceleration after re-gearing, you can also over-fill your transmission oil a bit, maybe start with an extra 50 mL of fluid and see where that gets you (if it does something undesirable, like revving to the moon and hardly even engaging off the line, or not shifting into second gear, you've probably put too much in)."
moped,39rg6q,eobanb,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:40:48 2015 UTC,What do you recommend for gearing? I think I'm currently running 26 on the front and 22 on rear
moped,39rg6q,eobanb,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:03:16 2015 UTC,"Find out for sure. A55 stock gearing is 26x28, so if it's never been changed, that's what it should be.  If indeed you're already running 26x22 and maxing at 36 mph, you're hitting right around 7000 rpm. With a 28t on the front, at 7000 rpm you'll go 39 mph.  I think with a Uni filter and Biturbo you should be hitting more like 8000 rpm though, and with 28x22 you would be going 44 mph. Is your PHVA properly jetted? You're running premix now? How much do you weigh?"
moped,39rg6q,eobanb,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:21:28 2015 UTC,I weight about 150 pounds. I don't mix the oil and gas because it is injected in to the gas automatically. I believe it's properly jetted as well. The end of my exhaust  is starting to come off as well and is blackish at the tip. Is that a bad sign?
moped,39rg6q,eobanb,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:33:08 2015 UTC,"So first of all, I think it's time for you to pull the oil injection and run premix. Yeah, you can get away with running it with just a Biturbo, but this is really the point of no return; if you want to keep doing performance upgrades, understand that the oil injection is just not tuned for that, and if it does fail in some way (i.e. not delivering enough oil for your rpm, or just stop working altogether) it'll do it with no warning whatsoever. Time to pull it.  I guess if you have $200 to spend I would probably get an MLM A55 People's Sidebleed before getting any sort of kit. I have the Hobbit equivalent and it's such a well-built pipe. Truly thoughtfully designed. Will it give you more speed? Mine's probably 1-2 mph faster than my Proma Circuit, but the real value is that it'll last.  I've never stacked up an MLM directly with a Tecnigas Next (I've had both pipes but not on the same moped). Honestly they're probably similar.  Sometimes switching out the idle jet and/or emulsion tube on your carb can help if you've also upjetted; I've done this on a friend's stock A55 with a modified airbox + Biturbo, which is basically the same setup you have. It's got stock gearing and runs about 38 mph, so I've no doubt with even modestly taller gearing it'll do low 40s no problem.  Some may disagree but I really do think the A55 is a great moped engine. Just be willing to pull the premix, find out for sure what your gearing is, and go from there."

moped,39rg6q,eobanb,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:41:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think the clearance makes that gearing physically possible without a lot more work, plus you'd probably lose too much acceleration"

moped,39rg6q,agent519,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:23:08 2015 UTC,"Tomos mopeds use a 415-type chain so you need a motorcycle chain tool (a bicycle chain tool might work but you'll have more trouble). It also helps to have a tool to help you remove and put on the master link.  Beware that once you remove links with a chain tool, you can't put them back in; to make your chain longer again you'll need a new chain."

moped,39jqgn,fake_belmondo,2,Fri Jun 12 05:20:24 2015 UTC,"If the oil pump is leaking it may also not be metering the correct amount of oil to your motor. If you really want to keep using it, you should verify it's delivering the right amount. The procedure for this is to connect a tachometer, run your engine on premix at a specified RPM for a certain period of time, and have the oil line coming off the pump drip into a graduated cylinder. Then you can measure how much oil the pump is moving.  You'll have to refer to the QT50 shop manual for the correct amount of oil/RPM/time.  If you don't want to do this, or your oil pump is pumping too much or too little oil, I'd say switch to premix.  As for your poor fuel economy (assuming that's not related to the oil pump), perhaps your exhaust is clogged? Are your tires at the optimum pressure? When's the last time you changed the gear oil?"

So if you're running a 62 jet now, go with around 72 jet first. If that ends up being too rich, then bump it down to maybe a 68 and keep doing some trial and error until you get it right."
moped,39bom4,eobanb,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:20:33 2015 UTC,I believe that stock is 68.  Would I be able to use my old jet if I wanted to try it out?  It comes with an 82 which I think might be a little too much.
moped,39bom4,eobanb,2,Wed Jun 10 19:31:05 2015 UTC,"Jets are interchangeable, but I really doubt the stock jet on your 12mm Bing is a 68. It may very well have a 68 now (if it has a new exhaust or ported cylinder or some other performance modification), but it probably originally came with a jet somewhere in the 48-58 range.  Here's a table of Bing carbs and their stock jets."
moped,39bom4,eobanb,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:20:18 2015 UTC,"you are probably correct.  Is there any way to know then what jet I should buy if I have it all stock, but upgrade from 12 mm to 15 mm carb?  Or should I not even bother and just buy another 12 mm?  The 12 did run a little rich and sometimes you would see gas dripping from the pipe after a long ride.  EDIT: the link you posted actually says the free spirit is 68 stock...  I acctually think mine might be the restriced 1.5 hp and no the 2 hp model though.  1/14/163  Stock on Sears Free Spirit 2 HP, main jet 68"
moped,39bom4,eobanb,2,Thu Jun 11 05:14:35 2015 UTC,"Really no reason to keep speculating. Just look at your carb, read the number on the side ('1/...'), look at your jet, read the number; then you know what you have, and will have an idea of where to go from there.  I already told you that if you're moving from a stock 12 Bing to a 15 Bing, that warrants moving roughly ten jet sizes up. So take from that what you will (if it's already a little rich, maybe only about 6 sizes up?) and be willing to do a bit of trial and error. Jets are just a couple dollars so buy a small range. Every moped is a little bit different.  As for whether you should get a 12 or 15 Bing, I'd probably get a 15. They're so close to stock people never really have issues with them and they provide a modest performance improvement with no real compromise in reliability, assuming you've jetted correctly."

There are a decent number of kits out there, pipes too. There are two vendors that make upgear sets for the transmission.  You can have a CDI and 12 volt lighting thanks to Kinetic parts.

moped,383w2c,romanista,2,Tue Jun 2 02:40:49 2015 UTC,"So I went to check out the two bikes.  The Nagrini was essentially new, the Magnum had a bit of damage on the seat as well as a rotting out gas tank and (3000+ miles).  I got the nagrini because I figured I would never have the opportunity to get a moped of that quality and pristine-ness again (37 miles) , while the Magnum of a higher quality will be available at some point in the future.  I also live in a pretty dicey area, and the Magnum was too big for me to store comfortably in my house. (Or anywhere else for that matter.)  I would be seriously afraid that it would be stolen if I left it out.    Thanks for the opinions guys and while I heavily considered the Magnum I know that if I want one at some point im sure the opportunity will come again."

moped,383w2c,eobanb,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:45:16 2015 UTC,"Hm, you've asked a lot of questions....where to start.  In terms of price, $825 is an OK price if you're in a bigger city on the east or west coast. If you're somewhere else (midwest, south) it's maybe on the high side, although I've certainly seen Magnums go for more than $825 in the midwest too.  Negrini Harvard‚Äîby 'optional' Morini I assume you mean an MO2. The Harvard model is a pretty unremarkable but good quality step-through tube frame model. Negrini (and Morini) are Italian.  Puch Magnum‚Äîthis one's probably worth more simply because top tanks, and Magnums in particular, are pretty desirable. Puch is Austrian, parts are generally a bit easier to find, some people don't like ZA50s because they can be a bit harder to tinker with than an E50 and if you do a lot of performance mods they can be a bit delicate.  I think personally I'd go with the Magnum. If it starts up in one or two kicks and it does a solid 28-30 mph then there probably aren't any 'red flags'.  Find out if your state requires a title in order to register/insure."

And puch bikes are well known for their reliability, ask about storage and use, where they got it from what they've done, check the tank for rust inside, and signs of abuse, should start easy, if they don't start, probably best not to get them, definitely not at that price, paperwork depends on your state, where I am all you need is a bill of sale, some places need a title too so check with you dmv or rmv on that, and don't be afraid to  walk away if neither bike seems right"
moped,383w2c,juttep1,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:17:04 2015 UTC,"The Magnum is so much better than the Negrini. Also super sought after. It'll always maintain its value.

moped,383w2c,shitterplug,0,Tue Jun 2 00:27:15 2015 UTC,What? No. People don't actually care about mileage on mopeds. But if you do But the za50 make sure you change your shift pucks

moped,383w2c,juttep1,0,Wed Jun 3 02:38:24 2015 UTC,"Lol. Seriously dude? Tell me a Magnum with 300 miles is worth the same as one with 4000. That's the difference between an $800 bike and a $1200 bike. The Negrini fanboys are an intense group, and they like their minty bikes. He's wanting a starter bike, so he wants one he can actual build and work on, not fuck up a low mileage bike with a slow ass Morini. Why ZA50? An E50 can be just as fast, but twice as reliable. Even after you swap out the pucks. E50 master race. You have a fucking Columbia. Gotta love that 505a. Go back to MA."

So...if that's the only reason e wants it he should just get a motorcycle.   C. Chill out. I was just saying if he got the za50 to check the pucks, not a statement about which is better. Just that he should if he gets it.   D. I WILL tell you that both of those magnums would be worth the same money to me and a lot of other people unless it's a.

There are also a lot of differences‚Äîcylinder and head are the same piece, there's a decomp, rear coaster brake, there are four different variations of the 505 for different top speeds (the Balboa might be the 'C' version, which is pretty good), and since there were a lot of different Sachs-engined mopeds you're not guaranteed to have an aftermarket exhaust fit perfectly out of the box without some messing around.

Also, plug chops are a waste of time and money. A temp gauge and the seat of your pants are a way better route for tuning as plug chops require you to hold the throttle open at the same position for the same distance and cut ignition followed by actually cutting your plugs threads off so you can see the very base of the insulator.

moped,37csya,d3k4y,0,Wed May 27 03:31:24 2015 UTC,"Nice. I'll trade you a #78 Dellorto Jet for that cat, but not a penny more. I'm not gonna molest the cat or anything. Well, not for sure. The cat may get molested. Er, just assume the cat will be molested."
moped,37e0bb,smhno,1 point,Tue May 26 23:00:13 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters, what's wrong with it?"
moped,37e0bb,juttep1,1 point,Wed May 27 04:49:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure - at this point when you try to start it, the engine attempts to turn over, but can't. It ran when I bought it, then stopped suddenly. After cleaning the tank, it ran again for a bit...until it didn't. After replacing the points it worked again for a ride or two, and then stopped again. Idling's never been easy for it either. I've been told that the solution might be a new carburetor? All in all I don't have a clear diagnosis on what exactly is wrong, unfortunately."
moped,37e0bb,eobanb,1 point,Wed May 27 10:25:59 2015 UTC,"Wait, let's be clear here. If the engine 'can't turn over', as you say, that is an entirely different kind of problem from 'turns over but won't start'. The former issue could be something like a seized piston or starter clutch problem; the latter could be something simple like a fouled plug or dirty jet.  Which is it?"
moped,37e0bb,d3k4y,1 point,Wed May 27 13:14:17 2015 UTC,"More like ""turns over but won't start."" I know you can't possibly diagnose a moped you aren't seeing in person, but based on your experience/knowledge, does this sound like a minor issue or a major overhaul sort of situation?"
moped,37e0bb,d3k4y,1 point,Fri May 29 18:20:11 2015 UTC,"The dude who fixed it did all that, but never replaced the condensor? Dude, if the obvious shit don't work, it's almost always the condensor.  When you have a bad condensor, sometimes it won't start, sometimes they will. For the ones that do start, they will either sputter really bad, almost like the the engine fires every third stroke, or they will run fine for 5 minutes until it starts warming up and get shittier until it dies.  Any of that sound familiar?"
moped,37d0xn,animositysteve,1 point,Tue May 26 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"Kicks over while pedaling and opening the throttle all the way, but dies immediately on releasing the clutch   I can't tell what this means. Does ignition actually occur or are you just referring to the engine turning from your pedalling?  Is fuel getting to the cylinder?"
moped,37d0xn,eobanb,1 point,Tue May 26 19:45:42 2015 UTC,ignition occurs... occasionally. About once every 5 tries it will continue to run after I stop pedaling but will die immediately when I release the clutch. fuel was getting to the cylinder before but I will admit I haven't checked it again since I put on the new carb.
moped,37d0xn,romanista,1 point,Tue May 26 19:57:22 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it might be a timing issue, double check to make sure your timing is correct.  Once you absolutely know that your timing is correct, then move onto carb issues. SHA's can be a little finicky to idle correctly, they absolutely need to have the air filter connected otherwise they won't idle. You might not have the correct jetting either"
moped,37d0xn,d3k4y,1 point,Wed May 27 03:06:55 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the condensor is going bad. That seems to be the case. You also probably want to try a new plug just to be safe. I've seen plugs spark, but it wouldn't start. New plug and it starts right up. If the condensor is bad, you will probably still get spark but it wont run or run like shit/die right away."
moped,37d0xn,triplefreshpandabear,1 point,Wed May 27 20:30:40 2015 UTC,"Check for spark with a spark tester, if it's bad then there's your problem, and if it's getting a spark (a good one) then try (carefully) spraying fuel in the carb then starting it, if it fires over a couple of times before the fuel spray runs out then you have a fuel issue those will be your two most common areas to focus on when there's problems, be careful when doing anything with gas and spark that you don't  blow anything up, until you do a some diagnostics it's hard to narrow down what's the cause of ""it won't  start"" but once you do it'll give you some direction"

moped,379thd,dwalk51,1 point,Tue May 26 12:50:36 2015 UTC,NICE! I would have thought the MLM pipe might have given it away :D But I did think the B/W would add a nice old timey feel to it :)

moped,37ar5c,parsnips,3,Tue May 26 06:17:38 2015 UTC,"If your looking to get into mopeds, youve gotta be at least a little bit mechanically inclined. The best way is to fix it yourself! However, most recommend a Puch, Tomos or Honda for a first moped."
moped,37ar5c,TheMellowestyellow,2,Tue May 26 08:53:45 2015 UTC,"Remember that in Chicago, you need plates and a city tag, and to get those you NEED a title.  Getting a bill of sale will do nothing for you.  The DMV will assume it is stolen without a title."
moped,37ar5c,mip10110100,3,Tue May 26 17:16:00 2015 UTC,False.   You can use a bill of sale from IN to get a fresh title in IL. there are many tricks to get a title.
moped,37ar5c,bacoon,1 point,Tue May 26 19:16:33 2015 UTC,"I looked at doing this for Missouri to IL, and consulted a lawyer friend on it, he highly recommend not putting a bill of sale in another state so that you can reclaim a title, 1. because it looks sketchy as hell, and 2. because if there is a title on the moped and it was ever stolen/title wasn't transferred to a new owner it's fraud.    I'd say do it cautiously if you do it, and be sure to trust the person you're getting the moped from, because Chicago cops will run VINs and can come down hard on moped riders."
moped,37ar5c,mip10110100,1 point,Tue May 26 19:30:38 2015 UTC,"Just keep looking. In bigger cities, at the start of summer, prices are bound to be high.  If you're willing to make a day trip out of your moped retrieval (i.e. to northwest Indiana, southeast Wisconsin, etc) and you have the patience to wait a month or two, you're bound to find a good deal."
moped,37ar5c,eobanb,1 point,Tue May 26 16:04:41 2015 UTC,"Even during the winter Chicago's prices have been insane.  A boutique moped shop opened a while ago, and people trying to sell beat up mopeds are seeing that guy's really high prices for perfectly restored mopeds, and set theirs too high.  (Then they sell)"
moped,37ar5c,mip10110100,1 point,Tue May 26 17:13:53 2015 UTC,thanks for the advice
moped,37ar5c,hypnotikrobot,1 point,Sat May 30 07:59:01 2015 UTC,Chicago prices are higher than most places but deals can be found. That motobecane is not a bad deal and I know the seller has it listed high. You can find more/better deals on the Chicago moped facebook group. https://m.facebook.com/groups/117974117608?ref=bookmark  If you want a moped youre going to need to learn how to keep it running. Or you can just take it to that hip moped shop.  Never seen those youtube videos but Im guessing thats the guy in Waukegan who always has 7 Maxis listed for $900 to $1000 on Craigslist.

moped,3777m5,BlorfMonger,1 point,Mon May 25 13:14:30 2015 UTC,That's pretty bad...perhaps caused by over-tightening the chain.
moped,3777m5,eobanb,1 point,Mon May 25 13:21:41 2015 UTC,Sachs 505 1/d engine I am rebuilding. I like to think its because the 1d had so much power! But more likely its just been ridden to shit.
moped,378yl1,DasWudChuck,1 point,Mon May 25 21:08:52 2015 UTC,It could be your jetting (sounds lean to me) but maybe you need to tune the rest of the PHBG a bit more (like the needle height). Also make sure you have an AU-type atomiser and your mixture screw is set about right (to richen it turn it outwards).  The PHBG is a great carb but it is relatively difficult to tune.
moped,378yl1,eobanb,1 point,Tue May 26 16:03:14 2015 UTC,"PHBG is definitely a bit more complex than I was expecting. Based on Dellortos manual the needle height seems okay, and after further reading it seems it may be four stroking at WOT. Going to downjet and see where that leads me. Will report back."
moped,378yl1,PUCH_COBRO,1 point,Wed May 27 00:25:41 2015 UTC,are you using the stock jet that came in the carb? Those are sized for the kit you buy.
moped,378yl1,juttep1,1 point,Tue May 26 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"No, stock jet was an 82. Ill put that back in and give it a try. Thanks!"
moped,378yl1,asaoppenheimer,1 point,Wed May 27 00:08:42 2015 UTC,Do a plug chop. Google it. Also don't down jet until you do so. Also get a head temp gauge.
