Getting rid of him and adding Rob Lowe and Adam Scott gave the series a big shot in the arm in terms of consistant funny episodes.

Its my place to relax.  I live alone and I dont worry about coming off looking perfect there.   So this may explain Knope.

Compared to how it was when i had cable, and when i watch it at other's houses, Hulu's commercials are barely a blip.  Usuall there 3 breaks per show with 1 or 2 commercials per break.

Everyone seems to hate season 1, but episodes like canvassing where they met the pedophile were absolutely hilarious. The same thing happened with 'The Office' where it started out as a show where you felt like you were in it and what was happening could actually happen in your life, and it got very dark at times, but as it went on it got more and more like a feel-good sitcom that you'd see on like ABC family."

PandR,3ctkmg,boardmonkey,6,Fri Jul 10 21:14:46 2015 UTC,My wife and I always talk about a Jean-Ralphio and Craig Middlebrooks spinoff.    This scene proves how awesome it could be.  Edit: Adjusted the start time of the clip by 1 second so it didn't start with a scream.
PandR,3ctkmg,cazza1993,8,Fri Jul 10 22:07:51 2015 UTC,"""Excuse me! Who even are you?""  It's weird how much I grew to like Craig on rewatches, because when he first came on I couldn't stand him. But at some point, I came to love him and now all of his scenes seem hysterical to me."

PandR,3ctkmg,feman0n,2,Sat Jul 11 09:28:03 2015 UTC,Favourite Jean Ralphio bit is the snake juice episode in season 3(?) where Tom convinces Ron to drink it and he promises if he doesn't like it Jean Ralphio will cut his hair. Ron says he will take that bet and JR fearfully whispers something like 'there's a lot riding on this'.   Killed me. After that episode I was hooked for good.

PandR,3ctkmg,Half_The_Battle,-7,Sat Jul 11 09:25:10 2015 UTC,"Man, I thought there was no character I hated more than Jean-Ralphio.  Then I saw Jeremy Jam and Mona Lisa.  I thought all 3 were over used, but I would much rather have had Jean-Ralphio be a main character than have to deal with the other 2 as much as we did.  Edit: Watching my Karma jump from -2 to 1 over and over was certainly interesting.  I didn't realize how polarizing my dislike for these characters would be."

PandR,3ctkmg,spinblackcircles,7,Fri Jul 10 20:45:55 2015 UTC,As I watched I liked him slightly more.  I wouldn't have minded if it was just him.  But I absolutely hated Mona Lisa and could not stand scenes with her.
PandR,3ctkmg,Half_The_Battle,3,Fri Jul 10 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I also hated Jean-Ralphio. It's because I can't stand people who behave like that in real life. Jean-Ralphio is a flanderization of that behavior, which makes it worse."
PandR,3ctkmg,spinblackcircles,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:47:02 2015 UTC,I don't even know how you enjoyed the last 3 seasons hating 3 of the funniest characters on the show.  And I say funniest in the sense that obviously the writers thought they were funny because they had a whole lot of screen time.

PandR,3coq5v,theinternethero,3,Fri Jul 10 01:14:33 2015 UTC,"I love it. I get to work outdoors and there is a broad spectrum of jobs you can go after with envs. Just in college, ENVS got me to go to Costa Rica, California, Africa, Yellowstone, and now I'm working in the high plains. One 'downside' is temporary work (which I think is a benefit, because you get to travel the country).  Basically most entry level jobs are 3-5 months long, then you'll be moving again to wherever will have you.   Course work was interesting, but not SUPER in depth into anything.. kinda.. it's hard to describe.  Since Envs is an 'interdisciplinary' science, it basically cobbles together a bunch of other hard sciences (chem, physics, bio, ecology, etc) and a few social sciences (ethics, sociology etc). So I can't really say I'm much of an expert on any topic, but I know a little about a lot  But, envs has a lot of policy work that I didn't care for, I'm more interested in wildlife/wilderness management kind of stuff, so looking back I would have done conservation biology to be more relevant to my interests.   What kind of stuff are you into, like what got you interested in envs?"
PandR,3coq5v,the_foxy_cow,2,Fri Jul 10 01:46:16 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the broad scope of it, but specifically water issues. I'm currently majoring in political science so I figured it could go hand in hand with policy making. I've taken an AP course in high school and another course my first year in college. I still have enough credits to allow me to slide a double major in there, I think. What really hooked me is the labs. They're so much fun!"

PandR,3ceagw,cpbdogs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:57:17 2015 UTC,April is great. A chunk of that is because I sold the show to my mom by basically saying that April is a tv version of my sister.   She is mature and responsible but she was never going to be enthusiastic and sunny like Leslie. It took Leslie (and April too) a long time to recognize that and that competency and enthusiasm don't always go hand in hand.

Editing of the 16:9 photo done courtesy of /u/Pan_Goat from /r/PhotoshopRequest  For the OP, I took a screenshot of the iPad from Live Ammo (s04e19) where Tom's face follows the girl with the puppy. This was a much higher quality image than the presentation. If there's a better episode to screenshot, let me know and I'll get it done. Since the iPad was at an angle, he was a little squished, so I stretched him out 18% (I figured it was 10 degrees off from the preferred 180 degree plane so 18% of 180 should make up for the lost 10 degrees) so it may not look true 720p.  I think Netflix only streams the show up to 720p so sorry if you need a higher resolution. Maybe if Hulu Plus allows 1080p and somebody could screenshot that for me?"

PandR,3c7blo,iamriptide,26,Sun Jul 5 17:18:02 2015 UTC,"I think both. Or really just any outspoken anti-gay activist who is actually gay. Physically he's Haggard but the fact that he's the anti-gay but flamboyant husband of a cold, anti-gay political leader is definitely more Bachmann"
PandR,3c7blo,blackmarketcarwash,4,Sun Jul 5 17:42:35 2015 UTC,hmmmmm http://www.gayco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Marcus-Bachmann_0.jpg
PandR,3c7blo,JonasBrosSuck,2,Sun Jul 5 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe nomenclaturally, but the resemblance is definitely closer to Haggard."
PandR,3c7blo,sudojay,5,Sun Jul 5 17:27:24 2015 UTC,Bachmann's husband is involved in therapy to turn gays straight. I'm positive he's the reference.
PandR,3c7blo,saltytrey,10,Sun Jul 5 18:38:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much. Closeted gay, self-righteous, member of the Christian Right, imposing his version of morality."

PandR,3ca79d,LovingThatPlaid,2,Tue Jul 7 02:30:59 2015 UTC,Hulu also has the last 10 episodes for free with commercials (but there are 13 so you'd have to find the first few somewhere online). This is mostly for other people's reference since you already have a source
PandR,3ca79d,matt_be,2,Tue Jul 7 21:30:19 2015 UTC,I saw something saying that Netflix would probably be getting it around September at the latest. Let's hope that is true
PandR,3ca79d,hypoboxer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:32:24 2015 UTC,NBC.com has all 13 for free with commercials if you are willing to log in with your TV service provider.

PandR,3c43da,ep29,9,Sat Jul 4 17:44:26 2015 UTC,"Never got a Christian vibe from ron, personally."
PandR,3c43da,TheVetrinarian,3,Sat Jul 4 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"According to this infographic, 28% of Libertarians are unaffiliated or refused to answer.  About 70% are Christian of some variety, which very generally holds with the national trend.  If asked on a survey or something, Ron would almost certainly have checked/said ""None of your damned business.""  Almost all the characters were kept devoid of specific religious/cultural references because these kinds of things can be pretty divisive; why risk losing some of the viewership?  Privately, who knows, but he strikes me as a slightly right-leaning libertarian, so if someone held a gun to my head and made me bet I'd bet some variety of Christian.  In the end this kind of goes back to what was said by the Sesame street folks about all the Bert/Ernie gay controversy.  ""They're not gay.  They're puppets.""  Ron's fictional."
PandR,3c43da,Deradius,4,Sat Jul 4 19:03:42 2015 UTC,these kinds of things can be pretty divisive; why risk losing some of the viewership?     They took a pretty strong stance on gay marriage.
