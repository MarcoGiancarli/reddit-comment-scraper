SarahChalke,36rs62,Viper_H,8,Fri May 22 09:19:43 2015 UTC,It's clear at 25 or 30fps if you're looking out for it. I slowed it down so you can see her rock hard stomach longer. I like stomachs and hips a lot.

SarahChalke,36rs62,Mywifefoundmymain,10,Fri May 22 09:22:13 2015 UTC,Just for you. :)  I am testing adding a watermark to promote the subreddit. Good idea or no?  I am leaning towards no.
SarahChalke,36rs62,Mywifefoundmymain,3,Fri May 22 09:32:24 2015 UTC,"Ok I'm going to be 100% honest.   I like the idea of the watermark, they can do great things.   The one on this clip however I feel is a detractor. I think it seems out of place and can be difficult to read (it's a contrasting colors issue)  Perhaps move it to the bottom right (seems more natural and your eye isn't ""pulled"" to the top left) reduce font size a hair and mess with the alpha channel to make it pop a bit more.   However I love Sarah chalk, please keep giving me fap bank material."

SarahChalke,2rytme,SolipsistAtheist,5,Sat Jan 10 16:26:07 2015 UTC,"Umm. 5 or 10 years ago they were fairly popular. Porn dvds that used popular porn stars to do a pov film, but they used the dvd menu feature so you could change what the girl was doing to ""you""  So it would start out with her at the title screen dancing around and talking sexy, then you could pick foreplay or sex and what position or toy. And if she was naughty or nice. Kind of a fun novelty. Oh and there was a button to make her cum and it would be in whatever position she was in. Clever I guess.   This just reminds me of the title sequence of said dvds. You can find isos on your favorite p2p site, I wouldn't recommend the streaming video sites, as those just have rips of scenes, and so are not interactive. Iirc the two main series were ""my plaything"" and ""virtual sex with _____"". No clue if they still make them."

SarahChalke,2oxjsm,mnvik28,6,Thu Dec 11 02:30:23 2014 UTC,This is not HTML5 or HQ.  If you'd like I could remake it in HQ for Gfycat?
SarahChalke,2oxjsm,remlap,6,Thu Dec 11 11:29:17 2014 UTC,I have never made a gif so I just Google searched a website that could make them off of a youtube video.

SarahChalke,2mpug4,jonsonsama,1 point,Wed Nov 19 23:49:29 2014 UTC,Last few seasons she replaced the original Becky and they dumbed down the character. She was awful in it sadly.
