summonerswar,3e2ntw,KonigSteve,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:49 2015 UTC,"Yep, their damage ratios are stupidly low. Their innate multipliers/circumstances barely make them equal to an average damage dealer. As such, they fail in damage most the time, and are only even with others occasionally."

summonerswar,3e2ntw,WTFShae,4,Tue Jul 21 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"Pretty accurate list, my only contention would be Jean being rated above Hwa."
summonerswar,3e2ntw,Glorounet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:12:22 2015 UTC,Hwa is situationally useful in PvE and still requires godly runes and/or luck to be effective as a Lushen counter while on AD after the turn stealing bug was resolved and even then Chloe or Bernard/Megan comps will generally negate her most important first turn.  Jean on the other hand is consistently one of the highest damage dealing monsters in the game for both PvE and PvP. The ranking seems justified considering Jean goes everywhere and Hwa is just sometimes broken.

summonerswar,3e2ntw,Train_Ride_Home,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:01 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I don't see a reviver in there. That means your runs are going to have to be semi-automatic. Baretta, Vero, Chloe, Bella, Sig? You will have to change focus from tower to tower to let the DoTs kill them. And if midboss Zaiross kills any of your team, it might be hard to beat the boss."

summonerswar,3e2ntw,takesen_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"Briand is actually a core piece in a DB10 comp because he draws aggro from Zaiross and works REALLY well with Bella. I'm running Sig, Vero, Bella, Kona, Briand for 95% DB10 team comp that goes LRDrag. If he isn't 6* already, he should be your next 6 star."

summonerswar,3e2ntw,thegoldenboy1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:42 2015 UTC,Depends on how fast your Veromos and Chloe are. My Kona is at 5* and does so much work with shoddy runes. Baretta should be fine. I feel like Hwa is only used in conjunction with Verde for faster DB10 teamcomps.

summonerswar,3e2ntw,iminstudio,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:06 2015 UTC,"I love my Atenai. I use her in my DB10 team and she does great. I have her Accuracy and CR% up high so she continuously applies a 3 turn DOT with her first skill. DB10 is notorious for keying in on one of your monsters, the first attack often times applies a def debuff and then they receive a couple other attacks. Her Share Life skill is great for this, it takes an almost dead monster and fully recovers them.   I have her setup on Despair/Revenge. So, when she processes revenge it is with her first skill and she usually applies a 3 turn DOT.  Then on the waves before the Dragon she does a good job of stunning with her second skill."

summonerswar,3e2ntw,srirachastephen,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:57 2015 UTC,I think Luer is too low and water succubus is too high. Also Jean shouldn't be above hwa or tyron
summonerswar,3e2ntw,Taichikins,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:20:33 2015 UTC,He is at end game arena. Jean hits for 40k+. Neither of the other two can come close to that.
summonerswar,3e2ntw,srirachastephen,3,Tue Jul 21 19:28:25 2015 UTC,"I love how there's not a whole lot of any newer mons...like no barbs, pirates, mermaids, etc"
summonerswar,3e2ntw,Taichikins,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:50 2015 UTC,hands up whos best monster on that list is baretta... sigh
summonerswar,3e2ntw,iminstudio,2,Tue Jul 21 20:31:54 2015 UTC,"good list though I was surprised draco was not included but then I read the notes how its only monsters he used. Agree with most of the rankings. some thoughts:   Verde has definitely gone up in my eyes in consideration of the meta formed post-veromos and guild wars, and he was already one of the best nat 4s in the game. I've changed my mindset from thinking swift is the best set as violent is just SICK on verde. The argument can be made that violent is the best set on any monster but certain monsters such as Chasun are defined with violent in mind, and I'll sacrifice 25% speed bonus for potentially full atb for the whole team. Fuco and Hwahee. I've tried to have an open mind about them but still can't see what the fuss is about, especially Fuco. He's never been the reason I've lost to an AD.  Shimitae is imo overvalued for his leader skill in consideration of his element and squishiness  in the current meta. He is a free target on AD and takes up a valuable slot; his 3rd skill while doing decent damage doesn't bring enough to the table. If we are talking strictly AO, I'd much rather build Izaria vs. tanky fire lineups."
summonerswar,3e2ntw,evantide2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:04:00 2015 UTC,I wish I could actually find a use for my Chloe since I got her from summon stones. She has been useless in arena and just a few uses in ToA so far.  Nice to see I only like half of the S and A ranks I guess.
summonerswar,3e2ntw,Taichikins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"Why is Acasis placed lower than Woochi Orochi and Shimitae?   I get subjective, so this is purely a question out of curiosity."
summonerswar,3e2ntw,evantide2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:59 2015 UTC,"Because Acasis kind of falls off after GB10, and she isn't even that good at GB10. Woochi has use in ToA hard. Orochi is used in speed GB10 comps and carries almost all PvE content where elemental disadvantage isn't a problem. And Shimitae is a good single target DD with a speed lead for Arena. Acasis is a mediocre support at best."
summonerswar,3e2ntw,Taichikins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:20 2015 UTC,"Acasis is great for both GB10 and ToA, so not sure where you're getting that.   Woochi has use in ToA...literally nothing else (other monsters do his job better outside of ToA). Orochi is used in GB10 speed runs...that's it, maybe water hall too....but lol, don't even need any special monsters for that.   Shimitae has 1 good nuke and speed lead for arena, that's literally it.   There's bias and subjectivity, and then there's flat out wrong.   Saying Acasis isn't even that good for GB10 is flat out wrong."
summonerswar,3e2ntw,QkumberSW,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"This is coming from someone who got Acasis early in the game before building a team for GB10. I started my GB10 runs with Vero/Acasis/Bella/Bernard/Shannon comp and found that the runs were too slow for me. Now that I have replaced Acasis with Orochi, I find it really difficult to really find use for Acasis anywhere else. You say that she has use in ToA, but in between Baretta, Verde, Vero, Sig, and Bella, I find it really difficult to place Acasis in any ToA comp that I can't use Lushen, Briand, Ahman, or Orochi instead. She just falls off so badly that I've been planning on putting her in storage after deruning her next month. You're right. She's not ""not good"" for GB10. But there are better alternatives."
summonerswar,3e2ntw,TTempus,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:23:16 2015 UTC,"For your GB10 team, the issue is you replaced Acasis instead of Vero. Violent Acasis in that team would be much faster than Vero. (Also note that she gets free 33% speed as well)   Baretta, Verde, Vero, Sig, Bella won't be surviving higher end ToA floors, where Acasis would be doing a lot more justice with her shield, 2 turn aoe stun, and dots.   The only issue with my pros is that it requires two different builds for her. Granted despair works for both GB10 and ToA, in your specific case, violent Vero would definitely outshine Despair Acasis for DB10.   Acasis is also a great counter to heavy crit comps in arena and guild wars.   The way I see it, she may not be better than each individual role as opposed to the other 3, but she's more diverse being that she fits in all, which I can't support her being placed lower than them."
summonerswar,3e2ntw,jvLin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:25 2015 UTC,i feel like the majority of end game users do not use acasis anymore and would fodder him if a 7* unit was possible.  I've used HER for a few floors on TOA hard but that's about it.

summonerswar,3e2ntw,eyeslegs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"I mean, I only have like two good sets of supporty Violent runes and could not justify spending a set on someone I was only going to use for GB10 where as Vero is used practically everywhere. And I completed ToA last season with that comp with Shannon instead of Sig... So...  You do make some great points. But I'm not the author of the above post. I'm just linking what he posted. And the only monster I'd replace Acasis with in the tier list is Woochi. Maybe we should just agree to disagree here."
summonerswar,3e2ntw,jvLin,0,Tue Jul 21 15:36:41 2015 UTC,"Baretta, Verde, Vero, Sig, Bella should be able to clear all of ToA normal and get decently far in hard (60ish+). I know because this is basically the same team I run. Even if I had Acasis, she doesn't scale well enough into the late game to justify runing her for anything other than GB10."
summonerswar,3e2ntw,Zenkrye,3,Tue Jul 21 16:03:37 2015 UTC,I use Acasis for ToA 50-80 hard. She works.
summonerswar,3e2ntw,alexen102,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:21 2015 UTC,Meh whatever works for your then I guess. Imo I rather sub her out for someone with more cc as I find ToA Hard 60+ too cc centric to rely on a 2 turn aoe that relies only on the RNG of despair.

I've been clearing ToA 100 and ToA hard up to floor 50 min for a while now.  Acasis has 1 use and 1 use only at end-game: Anti-crit Buff. That's it.

I don`t see shimitae or orochi doing that, not even close.  BTW - I used my acasis on last toa hard up to 93 iiirc then she wasnt needed anymore.   Give the sylphid some love! She will return it"
summonerswar,3e2ntw,edelysa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:16 2015 UTC,"Usually when they make lists, they are prioritizing arena. Acasis is useless to say the least in arena/guild wars.

summonerswar,3e2ntw,3ahb4uk,2,Tue Jul 21 21:23:51 2015 UTC,Lol.. I put verde super high on my tier list and people were bitching that he was too high. Some random Korean person does it and all of a sudden Verde is god. This subreddit is so hard to please.
summonerswar,3e2ntw,chasnette,0,Tue Jul 21 17:37:44 2015 UTC,Oh you're the person working on this list!   I think the subreddit just puts Korean opinions on a pedestal because Com2Us is Korean. They actually discussed your tier list on the Korean cafe here.
summonerswar,3e2ntw,zzer02,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:30 2015 UTC,"oh wow, neat! Thanks for sharing. I need to update my tier list because I haven't had the time recently. The meta changes quite often and they add monsters too frequently for me to keep up."
summonerswar,3e2ntw,chasnette,2,Tue Jul 21 20:26:58 2015 UTC,"lol I remember that. I think I said he was a tad high, though this was when you first did the lists (way before veromos era and guild wars). I do think he is somewhere in the S-tier now in consideration of the new meta, guild wars, arena (Verde helps a lot vs. veromos, chasuns or any team where the atb can help you make use of debuffs), etc. Final note, violent runes are crazy on verde (free turn potentially with every proc)"

There were only maybe 1 or 2 stages in the upper levels that I subbed out this team (using Acasis instead of Theo for more sustain). Having a Chasun on top of this should definitely make ToA clearable.     Getting them to 6* and having decent-to-excellent runes is really the key. If you're struggling with ToA having the monsters you do it's one of those 2 things you're lacking. Time to punch a giant and/or dragon over and over andoverandover"

summonerswar,3e2ntw,flamenight13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:32 2015 UTC,Verde absolutely outclasses Chloe in PvE (and everyone else for that matter; he's the God of PvE for a reason) while Chloe is more PvP-oriented. Assuming this isn't a tier list specifically for arena I'd say putting Verde slightly above Chloe isn't completely wrong though it definitely isn't the popular opinion.
summonerswar,3e2ntw,Kenn_Patelli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:12 2015 UTC,"but one can argue that if your team is still below average , a chloe will actually benefits more to lower-level player rather than a verd will help them.   anyway i think you're right. i kinda think it from pvp pov alone xD sorry for that"

Verde, imo is absolutely the best nat4 in the game atm. With good enough runes (violent/revenge, high speed + max cr) you can pretty much give your team violent procs, since 1 violent proc is already 80% atb. Not that Chloe is BAD persay, just that verdehile is also a god in TOA and for speed runs in HOH + db10"

summonerswar,3e1hb0,lolzzulet,16,Tue Jul 21 20:43:31 2015 UTC,"As someone who has logged well over a 1000 DB10 run, I have to disagree farming DB10 and GB10 is completely feel completely and utterly hopeless.  In my findings I've calculated that I find useable 5/6* runes about 4.5% of the time in 800 runs that's 36 runes that are either 2/4/6 %'s or 1/3/5 with 2+ good sub stats.   Out of those 36 runes in 800; after upgrades  60% of them are no more optimal or useable because of how the stats upgraded. That leaves me with 14.4 ~ 15 useable runes in 800 DB10 at 5 minutes a run that's 66.66 ~ 67 hours of farming DB10 for 15 runes.  I don't care about the summoning rates; or the powering up to 15+ but it's tough not to get burned out when 95% of end-game is farming DB10 and the other 5% is spread between GW/Arena and TOA."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,Pudii_Pudii,3,Tue Jul 21 12:25:36 2015 UTC,"Seconded.  The grind to find usable runes is absolutely soul crushing...above and beyond any other tedious aspect this game might contain. Oh, and let's not forget rune type. I know broken sets are a completely viable way of runing monsters but it sucks to get an amazing Nemesis rune, for example, when you need Revenge runes...lol."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,Enigmatik_1,4,Tue Jul 21 13:00:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, farming DB10 has definitely made me a believer in buying runes from the shop. I don't care how overpriced or the means I have to go about getting them.  I dropped 200 crystals yesterday to buy a violent HP slot 6 rune. My guild mates were nagging saying it wasn't worth it but 200 crystals = 6 refills = 474 energy = 59 runs @ my current statistics I'd be on track to find 2~3 good runes before upgrades.  Someday people will understand in games like these always take what is guaranteed over the chance at something because there aren't many guaranteed things in this game."

summonerswar,3e1hb0,dbchristenson,0,Tue Jul 21 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"I agree. Ultimately I ended up writing a bot program through mobizen that runs DB10 and levels my fodder for me while I sleep. Otherwise I don't know if I would still be playing. It's fun to wake up every morning and check the 50 or so runes I got during the night. This way I only play the fun parts and not have to ever worry about the monotonous grind. My progression now just happens passively and has kept me playing and spending money for refills (eats up your crystals like crazy when it's running every night).  That said, even while doing this I get maybe one useable rune a week."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,iruul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:23 2015 UTC,"I mean that that point is it even fun anymore? I've been back and forth with this game, someday it feels like a chore while other day it feels like the best mobile RPG I've ever played.  Don't get me wrong I love this game and the concepts and strategies that it brings. ToA Hard is a fun challenge, Boss stages of ToA normal are fun and exciting, High-end arena isn't half bad but the setup is what puts a lot of people off of it all.  67 hours of farming DB10 is roughly 30 days of play for me; while I play constantly throughout the day I think I manage around 40 DB10 runs. 30 days of setting up before I can take on the ToA Normal/hard, GW, etc.  Com2us needs to shorten the length of DB10 make it 3 stages instead of 5. Crystals > Mini Boss > Dragon; realisitically no one fails DB10 on stage 1 or 2 and if you can get past stage 3 with no units loss then you can get past stage 4 in a similar fashion."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,Pudii_Pudii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:39 2015 UTC,"Depends on the person. You complain about having to do DB10, but then you don't think it's fun if you didn't have to do it. The only thing you are physically doing during dungeons is being there to press reply. There is nothing interesting about it and takes no skill. There would literally be no difference if it auto replayed after each run.  I didn't mind this at first, but after 100s of runs it just starts becoming an annoying chore. By autoing it with a bot, I stay engaged by only doing the fun parts, and com2us gets more of my money. Wins on both sides."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,iruul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:14 2015 UTC,"How did you write this bot, if you don't mind me asking? I'm not asking because I want to do the same thing (too scared of a ban, no matter how small the chance).. more because of my curiosity.  My first thought was you used a mouse recorder, but that wouldn't work overnight. Your bot would need to know when to refill and I think the ""Get"" button is in different spots for runes and other drops.  I'm assuming you coded your own program?"
summonerswar,3e1hb0,dpelego,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:20 2015 UTC,"It's a mouseclicker program written in java. I didn't write the original program, but it is basically an interface to write your own bot with an easy to use GUI. It basically controls your mouse and clicks on things through mobizen, so it is impossible to detect because it is indistinguishable from clicks you make normally. You can set it to do anything you want by having it recognize images. So you can have it go If ""img of not enough energy"" = true, then refill, etc. It can know where to click for every kind of drops, can auto sell runes based on grade, type, etc, and can even record what dropped into an excel sheet so you know what happened while it was running and for statistical analysis of drop rates.  I actually posted a tutorial guide on how to use it to make your own script not too long ago. It's really easy."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,iruul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:39 2015 UTC,That sounds amazing.  So...I can't be the only one interested in this program.  How did you do it?  Are you using one of the high-end game automation tools the botting community uses or something you put together?
summonerswar,3e1hb0,uninspiredalias,-2,Tue Jul 21 20:16:58 2015 UTC,"You realize that 1000 DB10 runs is only about 2-3 days worth for most guardian players, right."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,Exuritas,7,Tue Jul 21 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"Even at 4 minutes a run 1000 runs is 4000 minutes = 67 hours. 67 hours of game play over 3 days is around 22 hours of play a day.   No one plays that much, I promise you. The average player might play on and off for a total of a 10 hours a day and even that is stretching it as they have other things in their day to worry. That's not even counting the time for dailies, wings and loading screens.  Maybe there are so diehard teens out there logging 100+ DB10 runs a day and playing 22 hours a day but most people have other obligations in life, work, family, friends, etc."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,Pudii_Pudii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:26:31 2015 UTC,"yea, they really need to streamline the uk scroll summoning, it is extremely tedious."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,nemsae,0,Tue Jul 21 06:23:33 2015 UTC,My idea is to be able to feed scrolls directly to monsters for level ups using a slider than can select as many scrolls as you want.
summonerswar,3e1hb0,iruul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:51 2015 UTC,"I think they could make it so you could spend 20 US or so to get a guaranteed 2* . It would be a low tier ""Legendary"" like scroll and, since, you already spend 20 US to get a 2* from power-ups anyways, so you're actually giving up the chance to get more than one 2* in those scrolls.  For me it would be a win-win situation."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,Timodar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:04:22 2015 UTC,"Personally I find at least one 2* monster at least per 10 scrolls, often even more. I'd probably not take this offer at all."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,Cronko_Wesh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:34 2015 UTC,"It's a compromise, as it should be, imho. Like spending 50k mana to get a high essence from 10 mid.  You don't have to do it, but I guess a lot of people with 3k+ US would not even consider using simple US ever again if that option was available. Simply because it would be much less time consuming (consider all the boredom of finding 21 1* and then foddering 19 to max lvl the 1* and another one to evolve it)."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,Timodar,6,Tue Jul 21 17:33:02 2015 UTC,Yeah the odds are like 24-26%...so I usually find a couple every 10.  Rarely I've seen runs of up to 20 with no 2s...but I've also seen 4-6 2s in a row.
summonerswar,3e1hb0,uninspiredalias,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:07 2015 UTC,"We need the ""summon 10x Unknown scrolls"" button..."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,ShroomiaCo,2,Tue Jul 21 09:05:16 2015 UTC,I like OPs solution more cause we can get what we want and get rid of scrolls faster. It should also cost a ton of mana since power ups and time...
summonerswar,3e1hb0,Ficetool,7,Tue Jul 21 09:10:38 2015 UTC,"Yes but considering all the rng factors, the 10x button is more realistic."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,ChaosLordR,3,Tue Jul 21 19:16:28 2015 UTC,NEver seeing a nat 5 is something you like? Getting your process barred by something you cannot control? okay  there is kind of huge difference between NEVER and rarely
summonerswar,3e1hb0,reket,2,Tue Jul 21 08:33:13 2015 UTC,"I would say I became a dedicated player late January/early February (went on hiatus months before), but I because of that, I had a stock of MSes I never opened from pre-hiatus times. Never bought a premium pack. F2P. I bought every shop scroll I saw. Finished ToA the first time during the first Lyrith rotation, so I had 3 Legendarys from ToA.  Never summoned a nat 5*.  The only nat 5*s I have are Sigmarus, Veromos, Tesarion (not built), Akhamamir (not built), and soon-to-be-fused, Katarina. I wouldn't say it's unlikely a dedicated player never gets a nat 5* from summon. I will probably be one of those guys eventually to cross the 1 year mark with no summoned nat 5*s."

Sigmarus, which is fuseable, is so much better and stronger. Water monkey does not have def break and thus is rendered too weak as a dmg dealer compared to its brothers. Now what am I to do with a nat 5, that I get once in lets say half a year, and that is shit and does not really help me?   If all nat 5s were equally good and useful i would accept your argument. But the way it is now is just shit"

Still havent gotten my second but around 13 months I started getting some of the good nat 4s. No idea how/why I kept playing that first year.I guess the first year was all shannard and the light trio
summonerswar,3e1hb0,fixati,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:56 2015 UTC,"I also play since then. I don't even own one of the ""good"" nat 4 Units while you already have a nat 5...

But it's no longer cool if you're on the side of the people who have only the things everyone has..  Edit: Meanwhile I see lvl 29 Players with Vanessa, Eladriel, Chandra and Chloe AD all lvl 40..."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,Kap_Jeffer,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, most of the f2p people I know who have been playing on a consistent basis daily usually have one nat 5. I myself have been playing for nearly a year as f2p and have also gotten my share of nat 5s. But even with what I pulled, it's not something that I can immediately make use of. For example it takes time to bring out the potential of my nat 5s, and most of them require violent. I guess what i'm trying to say is that in sw, despite the ""bad"" rates, there are many projects one can work on. Having a good monster is good, but it takes time to bring out its potential (runes, buildings, etc. Although some monsters are easier to build) In my opinion I think this sets the game at a healthy pace, given the rather unique...monster balancing in the game. Of course at the end of the day it does come down to luck."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,iPodbiak,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:29 2015 UTC,"I dunno, when I get 50 US, I mass summon these scrolls so it doesn't go at 100s or 1000s"

summonerswar,3e1hb0,shadedclan,3,Tue Jul 21 15:13:16 2015 UTC,Asian countries are far more accepting of being able to pay for power and power gaps between different 'tiers' of players too.

His summomner war is develop by Plaid Hat and Playdek and your summoner war is develop by com2us which HQ at korea. Summary is RageBlade doesnt get his shit right and might need to do some homework. lol
summonerswar,3e1hb0,justachinaman,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:55:57 2015 UTC,Actually checked it out. The one developed by Plaid Hat is Summoner Wars and the one we play is Summoners War. Lol that s can sure make a difference
summonerswar,3e1hb0,fat_elevator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:02:36 2015 UTC,"Taken from wiki: Summoner Wars is a game developed by Plaid Hat and Playdek, Inc. The iOS version was released on July 4, 2012. Just like 3 months back, Summoner war is celebrating 1year anniversary. According to math. 2015 jul - 3 month = 2015 april - 1yr = 2014 April. 2014 April release date doesnt tally with 2012 July hence this summoner war is not the summoner war.

summonerswar,3e1hb0,uninspiredalias,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:07:37 2015 UTC,I wish there was a way to grind for monsters you want and that could be the end-game. I played this game and assumed every monster was (reasonably) obtainable. How wrong I was.
summonerswar,3e1hb0,leonden,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:09:29 2015 UTC,"Well, on the bright side - since I have started playing (last october) they've added Veromos (and his nat4 components), the Ifrits and now the water MK.  These are absolutely amazing boons to F2P players.    Also, even the wind ifrit which gets shit on by all the good players - even he has been an awesome addition to my team and helped me progress from TOA 50->80 as well as becoming my new farmer (he's really close to Aiden hell, just needs some 6* runes).  You can absolutely run a farmable (to the degree that those obnoxious RNG gated 3* fusion mats are farmable) team all the way to end game (at least through GB10/DB10, TOA and TOA Hard 50+) and do all the content except high end arena.  The thing is, by the time you are at that point, you will probably have opened at least 300 scrolls, netting a couple usable nat4s that may allow you to push farther into high end arena.  Still, even there the key seems to be sick runes...so P2W people who pay for refills all day will have you beat, but that is what it is...  Me, even though everyone says dump all your crystals into refills, I dump 80% of them into the 750 packs anyway.  I have most of the fire/water/wind 4s that I want, aside from a good rezzer like Platy or Briand, but I just refused a Mikene for DB10 until one of them shows up.    That being said, I agree and wish there was a way to get the monsters you actually WANT.  At this point, I can't see how it would hurt the meta as the P2W people at the top have a fuckton of nat5 units anyway.  Maybe each player can earn a nat5 of their choice every 2 months?  Something time and not money gated?  Whatever, it would be nice."
summonerswar,3e1hb0,ambotsadako,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:32:20 2015 UTC,i wish they could do something like combine unknown scrolls to increase the chance on getting a 2* or 3* something like if you use 100 US and 30.000 mana at once your chance to get a 2 star is about 70% 3* about 7% and 1* the last 23%
summonerswar,3e1hb0,Fritztrocity1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:25:55 2015 UTC,what i'd like for them to include is the option to open 1 or 10 scrolls in one go just like in kritika but that's just me.
summonerswar,3e1hb0,Duartvas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:37 2015 UTC,I absolutely HATE getting lows in B10's and Unkown Scrolls 3 times in a row in Giants B10. What the hells the point of farming B10 if all I get is 1 star food?! Unkown drops should be significantly lower than what they are. Such a low blow you worked hard and built a team to do the hardest dungeon and your most common reward are unkown scrolls.

Also, getting tons of low essences in high tier halls, like you said, is bull*.  We should have a lot more fusions available and endgame should be a lot more around those.  I am getting tired of so much rng influence in the so called endgame (yes violent, I am looking at you also)."

Would be really cool if each time you hit the gamble upgrade button it would reduce the cost of the guaranteed upgrade by that amount.

summonerswar,3e1hb0,iPulzzz,4,Tue Jul 21 18:58:48 2015 UTC,"If the % of getting a usable rune is so low, they could at least make the upgrade rates better. Or make the % of getting said rune higher (by reworking tables by lowering U.Scroll drop rates).  Grinding to 6* isn't really an issue for most players entering end-game (toa 100, db10, giants 10, etc) as the main focus is rune-farming, mana management, and potentially game-changing monsters. Not to mention, 4* rainbowmon every week and increased 2x xp rewards from com2us make 6* stuff easier. Summoning unknown scrolls and micromanaging 1* monsters is annoying though.   finally, the ""im ok with never getting a nat5"" thought only lasts so long."

My main team is Baretta/Shannon/Ahman/Briand/Veromos.    I switch when i can on intermediate floors to something like Baretta/Spectra/Bernard/Veromos/Thrain. Much faster. I auto-ed almost everything up to 70, now i have to manual and it's incredibly boring so i do like one floor a day.    Edit : Of course i dont have Verde either."

summonerswar,3e313d,OmniaCausaFiunt,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:59 2015 UTC,"Yup, Baretta is really important for virtually everything in toa hard. He makes intermediate floors much faster and as such, less likely to fail. And he helps you a ton on boss stages by doing great damage to minions and having one of the rare forms of controls that work on bosses, via his second skill.     Veromos is also a MVP for me, 3 turns 60% chance stun is insane, and he has great utility via his passive and dots. Much more random than using a Tyron, but no elemental disadvantage, greater damage and utility, and much shorter cooldown on his stun..."

Make him as fast as possible - his role is to be an annoying stunner/continuous damage spammer whilst having survivability whilst the rest of your team takes advantage of the leader skill.   IMO he's too squishy as an endgame damage dealer and there are much better options our there.  Example team:  Garo (lead), Perna, bella, chloe."

I tested him in arena and guild war and according to my observation, his 3rd skill got resisted a lot (especially to Chloe, Chasun, archangels, briand...all high resistance-built monsters). It'd be a bad idea if you bring him vs Chloe or any immunity buffer since he fails to remove immunity, he fails to land debuff as well.  He shines in GW battles more than in Arena due to less enemy = more chance to land debuff on expecting target. But I haven't found a team that can synergize well with him."

Bella is your answer. Bella can be used anywhere and most importantly will be a crucial part of you DB10 team.

summonerswar,3dzdyy,SlothSleuth,18,Mon Jul 20 19:39:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for doing that. That's really close to my data (850 scrolls across 3 accounts). I really wish they'd remove the option of getting awakened nat2/3/4s...I think that would remove at least a little salt.  I think I saw somewhere that legendary scrolls aren't supposed to have awakened nat3s at least...but I think they can get awakened nat4s?
summonerswar,3dzdyy,uninspiredalias,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:41:22 2015 UTC,I agree.  The awakened monsters is such a burn most of the time.  I'm still salty after the 5 star awakened Atenai I got.

summonerswar,3dzdyy,leoplusma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:09:50 2015 UTC,It's statistics like this that make wonder why everyone claims the legendary pieces in the GW shop aren't worth it. Legendary scrolls from the GW shop provide only natural 4 or 5 star monsters.  Statistically in 16 elemental scrolls (4000 GP = cost of legendary scroll) you should get at most  1.56 ~ 2 4 stars monsters versus 1 guaranteed with the legendary scroll.  Going by his rates legendary scrolls (Assuming the two stay the same between MS and Leg Scroll) you have approximately a  = ((9.81 / (9.81 + .56)) = 94.60% chance of getting a 4 star monster and a (100 - 94.60) = 5.4% chance of pulling a 5 star monster.
summonerswar,3dzdyy,Pudii_Pudii,2,Tue Jul 21 00:58:43 2015 UTC,gw legendary doesn't give awakened 3/4*? Do you have a source for that?

summonerswar,3e1cwb,Sick0h,13,Tue Jul 21 05:09:04 2015 UTC,"Every aspect of this game is basically a funnel towards paying from what I've tested.   Rune failure rate increases as tier increases. Rune cost increases as tier increases. Costs are significantly more than income. The ""Wish"" fountain is clearly rigged to tiers of outcomes rather than actual RNG. Summoning is a joke.  Rune drop rates follow almost the same pitiful RNG %'s as summoning.   I think the biggest difference between this profit engine and say, Clash of Clans, is the price point. The price points in this game are batshit insane. In CoC you are looking at an initial investment of roughly $12,000 USD to take your base to maximum levels. That's still crazy, there is nothing that even remotely explains why a game needs paywalls in the thousands of dollars. We, and the industry, like to use ""but it saves time"" on a game that evidently needed to take 5 years to reach endgame when all the content it has is a couple dozen 5 minute levels or pvp.  $12,000 USD is the equivalent of 5 statistically expected 5* units going on the above calculations, which are fairly accurate as I've done the math too and got similar results. Just 5. You can't even ""catch them all"".  In what universe did it start being totally normal for us when tiny cosmetic pieces of games started being sold to us for this amount? Every time we buy in, we are telling this company and any other company paying attention... and for $2100 units you better believe they are paying very close attention, we are telling them that hey, this is totally fine. This is what we want.  We are going to get more of this shit shoveled into our collective mouths, because we bought in. I wish I hadn't, it pains me that I've wasted what I've wasted on this game. Disposable income sure, but there is nothing good about spending it that irresponsibly. In buying in, I've basically encouraged this trend and that affects more than just me, it affects the hobby that I love in a way that I feel is more and more negative each time they release another profit engine dressed as a game."
summonerswar,3e1cwb,stir_the_dust,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:10:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you say. However ...   Costs are significantly more than income.   I'm not sure this is true, at least not once you get into late game. The rate at which good runes drop (or come up to buy) is so low that I usually have more than enough to 15 the rare good drop immediately after I get it.   Dragon drops such shit most of the time that the money from selling runes keeps you pretty stocked."
summonerswar,3e1cwb,codeGrit,0,Tue Jul 21 13:36:36 2015 UTC,"Err, 5 years? Sorry dude, try 1 year max if you're slow as hell and inefficient like I am.  You can get through a lot of content in this game with purely the farmable mobs and just straight 6* runes (Not caring about subs)."
summonerswar,3e1cwb,evantide2,4,Tue Jul 21 17:14:02 2015 UTC,"He was actually talking about Clash of Clans for 5 years. It was pretty much proven that if you played everyday making X amount from raids /  battle that it would take you 5 years of playing Clash of Clans to max out your entire base, units and other upgrades.  This game can be ""beaten"" in under 5 months if you know exactly what you're doing. I'm at end-game and I think if I started over I could beat GB10/DB10/ToA100 and C1 in Arena in under 6 months regardless of what units I pull.   It's been proven that all PVE content can be beaten with farmables."

summonerswar,3e1cwb,Pudii_Pudii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:30 2015 UTC,first one. Just had a lot of good advice from the DAT :)
summonerswar,3e1cwb,NYGfan54,8,Tue Jul 21 20:14:33 2015 UTC,"It's only .5% for a 5* I believe, not for a nat5, for a nat5 you're looking at more like .2% going by the numbers I've seen from larger studies. Which makes the math even more depressing.  Minor nitpicking aside, thank you for putting this together - it really does a great job of showing how abysmal the odds are. Only gets worse when you realize that even if you win the lottery for a nat5... most of them range from shit to average. Chances of getting a Perna or Ritesh are... pretty bad."
summonerswar,3e1cwb,Aryuto,3,Tue Jul 21 05:28:17 2015 UTC,"Both good points, focused on the basic math and forgot about the fake 5's. Depressing indeed."
summonerswar,3e1cwb,gamingfitness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:32:02 2015 UTC,There are not different rates for a 5* or a nat 5. If you roll a 5 it picks from a pool of awakened/unawakened.
summonerswar,3e1cwb,new_messages,3,Tue Jul 21 06:35:19 2015 UTC,"Doesn't really makes sense, though. At least 4/5ths of every ""player summoned 5*"" announcement not including ifrits is about nat 5s. I estimate a similar rate with fake 4s and even 3s from what I summon.  Honestly, the thought that you are more likely to pull a fake nat 5 seems like a huge misconception with no actual numbers taken into consideration."
summonerswar,3e1cwb,OmniaCausaFiunt,2,Tue Jul 21 11:26:33 2015 UTC,have played for over a year now. have pulled two awakened nat 4s and zero nat 5s.
summonerswar,3e1cwb,new_messages,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:50 2015 UTC,"That's far from a significant sample size, though. My first two summons in this game were nat 4s, so at the same sample size as your ""summoned 5 stars"" statistic, I had a 100% nat 4 rate.  At 10 5 star summons we should be kinda able to get a rough idea of where the numbers are, though for reliable statistics we should look at many more summons. This is easily doable by looking at the chat and noting down the messages that appear. While I have not taken notes, and therefore cant make precise calculations, I guarantee that awakened 4 star summons are rare compared to nat 5 summons."

While I have not taken notes, and therefore cant make precise calculations, I guarantee that awakened 4 star summons are rare compared to nat 5 summons   seems like you're contradicting yourself. you're doing the same thing as those who believe awakened 5* have equal or higher summon rates.. except you are for the opposite argument. selective bias can skew things a lot, ppl tend to remember the awesome 5* summons more than the troll 5* summons."
summonerswar,3e1cwb,new_messages,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:27 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but I did try to keep track of it mentally for a while. Plus, it's not like it's hard to reobserve this whenever you want. Just go to any populous channel and watch the chat for a few minutes.  EDIT: on second thought, dont do that. it takes more than a few minutes to get a few dozen nat 5 summon messages. that said, it's not quite the same thing. While it is true that memory based arguments can be manipulated by bias, I have yet to see one person who claims that the fake 5 rate is higher than the nat 5 rate use the oberved summons in chat as an argument. Instead, they either rely on their own limited numbers, or claim that each awakened nat 4 monster has the same summon rate as a nat 5 and since the nat 4 summon pool is higher they get summoned more often (this argument makes sense on paper, at least).  I wont be online for too long today, but I will try to keep track of every summon I see during my next session. Will post results here."
summonerswar,3e1cwb,trollinnoobs,0,Tue Jul 21 18:50:22 2015 UTC,small sample size but I have pulled 14 nat 5s and 1 awakened nat 4(dark bomber -.-)
summonerswar,3e1cwb,Aryuto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:36:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand. There is (assuming the numbers we're talking are correct) a .5% chance for a 5 star. Out of that .5%, .2% is nat5, and .3% is non-nat5. In other words, 40% of a 5* pull being a nat5, 60% of it being an awakened 4.  Is my understanding wrong?"
summonerswar,3e1cwb,gamingfitness,0,Tue Jul 21 06:59:26 2015 UTC,yes. there's an equal chance of pulling a nat 5 or awakened 5.
summonerswar,3e1cwb,Aryuto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:02:40 2015 UTC,What do you say that based on?

summonerswar,3e1cwb,TheGreatBrendon,2,Tue Jul 21 08:51:16 2015 UTC,"Basically if you want to spend ""wisely and efficiently"" you buy things that will guarantee you further your progress.  Like spending on mana stones or crystals that will let you refill or whatever so you can 6* monsters, get runes, etc, faster.  Buying scrolls is VERY high risk but in the chance that you're feeling lucky then it can be very beneficial."

summonerswar,3e1cwb,drunken_monologues,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:30:04 2015 UTC,"Something you should consider is that you shouldn't buy premium packs any way, your money is way better spent on energy refills and shop refreshes (you'll get more MS + runes + mana + xp this way).

summonerswar,3e1cwb,schwaka0,3,Tue Jul 21 10:19:31 2015 UTC,The issue with wish is it's rigged to give you very little. The sample size is very small but if it was truly random you would have similar numbers for everything instead of 1/3 5k mana. How many times has it slowed and looked like it was going to stop on something decent only to move to 5k mana? >.>
summonerswar,3e1cwb,C-LAR,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"odds are long, but it's a good thing that you can be competitive with just nat 2s, 3s, with a few 4s."
summonerswar,3e1cwb,DrunkenScarecrow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:14:18 2015 UTC,if you are going for the number of scrolls for a guaranteed 5* you are right.   the awakened 4*   but what would be more interesting is the average number of mystical scroll you need for a 4* or 5* you would have to take into account the probabillity for multiple 5* pulls in row normalize them on their amount and build the average. why? well because no normal person would have 1000ms
summonerswar,3e1cwb,Pudii_Pudii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:46:43 2015 UTC,"It's been known for a long time that the rates were horrible and that spending money on summoning was pretty much throwing your money away literally.  There is a reason that all guides, videos and end-game players strongly recommend spending your $$ on refills and 2x cards because those are the only things guaranteed in this game.   You buy that 3k crystal pack and use it only for refills and 2x cards; you only summon when you get  scrolls from DB10/GB10/ToA/GW/Elementals and watch how much farther you'll get for less. You can sustain yourself off those 3,000 crystals for months; honestly forever if you keep up with your dailies, arena and weekly events.  It's no surprise that com2us is here to make money they're damn good at it too; but you don't have to boycott in app-purchases just fight temptation and spend wisely. I've spent $135 on this game in 9 months; 1 3k crystal pack early on and the beginner pack. I play everyday and I have yet to drop under 2k crystals.  Going by the rates founds/revealed legendary scrolls (Assuming the two rates stay the same between MS and Leg Scroll) you have approximately a = ((9.81 / (9.81 + .56)) = 94.60% chance of getting a 4 star monster and a (100 - 94.60) = 5.4% chance of pulling a 5 star monster.   Legendary scrolls from Guild Shop have been confirmed on Com2Us's stream to yield only natural 4/5* monsters and that any awakened summoning should be reported to them immediately."

summonerswar,3e1cwb,DrSeuss19,0,Tue Jul 21 05:28:03 2015 UTC,"You are just as likely to open 1057 mystical scrolls and not get a nat 5 as you are to get one from a single mystical scroll.   that's not how statistics works... yes EACH MS has the same chance, but the chance of getting a 5* from 1057 MS isn't anywhere near the same as the chance of getting it from 1 MS  e.g.  if you flip a coin 1x time you have a 50% chance of getting heads  if you flip the same coin 10x times, your chances of getting a heads isn't 50%. Your chances of getting a heads in this case is 1-(0.50)10 = 99.9023437%  also, you're wrong, it's 1% of getting a nat5, not 0.5%  so, while your chance of getting a nat5 is 1%. In 1057 mystic scrolls, your chance of getting a nat5 is 1-(0.01)1057 = 99.99% chance of getting a nat5  in the example you used 200 MS. Your chance of getting a nat5 is actually 1-(0.99)200 = 86.602% that you will (23.4% you won't)"
summonerswar,3e1cwb,Fortdeus,2,Tue Jul 21 15:47:41 2015 UTC,"Com2us said nat 5 rate is below 1%, not exactly 1%. All of the gathered data points to the rate being 0.5%. The first sentence you quoted then becomes true at that rate, because after 1057 ms you have a 0.5% have of not having a nat 5 just like you have a 0.5% chance of pulling a nat 5 from a single mystical scroll."
summonerswar,3e1cwb,chunwa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:45 2015 UTC,"You're wrong. It isn't 1%. It is below 1%. There have been multiple ""studies"" done and the rate is between .2-.5% for at natural 5*."

When you do this, often times you'll find ""glory-farming partners"" who will attack you back every time. I used to have 3~5 people who I could constantly expend my wings on :P"
summonerswar,3e3yur,Laringar,2,Tue Jul 21 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"I'm doing the same. I usually set a single mon on defense during the week, to keep me close to 1200, then put a real defense and push to 1400 on Sunday before reset. Much easier to get wins when your rating is lower."
summonerswar,3e3yur,schyan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:05 2015 UTC,yup! I now hover just above 1200 where I can auto farm the whole list over and over. Not quite able to reliably farm in Conq3 so I'm happy with what I'm doing atm

summonerswar,3e3yg7,Swarsie,0,Tue Jul 21 19:53:08 2015 UTC,"I dont know if it's 100% yet. I recently made Bella 6* since she was the one dying first and it didnt fail anymore, so I dont think shannon needs to be 6 star, but i haven't ran it that many times."

So my setup was: Theomars (Leader), Verdehile, Aschubel (Dark Sylph), Belladeon and Bernard. Super speedy team with great CC & ATK bar reset basically. Just CC the monsters on the sides and go straight for the boss, thats what i did.  Edit: Use a Healblocker like Briand for floor 90. The team i used was Theomars, Belladeon, Verdehile, Briand and Aschubel. I CC the MKs and Yetis and go straight to nuking down the boss."

summonerswar,3e3ue6,bakaTSUz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:47 2015 UTC,I think she is hot and love the animations.  Totally worth it to 6* her.  Mine is only 4* with Despair / Nemesis and she can solo Famion 1 Normal.  None of my runes are up to +9 on her.    I also have Soha at 6* for farming but I think she will be a faster farmer so I am working her up.

summonerswar,3e3tvd,Dhaes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:21 2015 UTC,I am debating the same thing for my 2nd bomber.  I am leaning towards Taurus though just because i want more damage!
summonerswar,3e3tvd,iminstudio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:58 2015 UTC,Jojo has higher Base hp also! And with the fire meta:/ Susano put plenty of speed and damage sorted. Kahli these days since she buffs the whole team now!
summonerswar,3e3tvd,glennerz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:37 2015 UTC,"I am in the same shoe as you are ! Instead of farming in Hydeni Hell, i use my Lushen in Mt Runar Normal. I am also contemplating which bomber to build, I think I'll go with Malaka and Jojo and will use Taurus to skill up my Malaka. Faimon Hell I use Soha, Rage Blade - Kahli since he's easier to skill up and he provides team buff."
summonerswar,3e3tvd,Arbitel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:13 2015 UTC,"The thing with Jojo is that his bomb skill receives another 50% accuracy, so you only need 35% accuracy on him AND Malaka, since you can use Malaka's lead skill to boost his accuracy to the REQUIRED 85%. This will allow you to maximize your att% and spd stats for your bomber team. If you used Taurus, you'd have to put 85% accuracy on one of them, since you can't use both lead skills. TLDR; Jojo  Lapis is a much faster farmer than Soha, but Soha has arena applications, but then Soha will need accuracy, making her an even slower farmer. However if you're putting Vamp runes on them, then Soha won't that great in arena. TLDR: Lapis is a better farmer.  Jean requries many things to deal high damage, he needs someone to att buff him, someone to break the enemy's defense, and he needs to be above 50% hp. So while Jean usually requires 2 monsters (Galleon excluded), Kahli can do all of this on her own (att+/spd buff and ignores def), and can still 1 shot things at 0.01% HP. She even buffs the team. Freeing up these extra slots allows you to bring other crucial elements to the fight in the form of tanks, heals, extra damage, immunity, CC - you name it. For these reasons I feel that Kahli is far superior. TLDR: Kahli"
summonerswar,3e3tvd,Kayjeebee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:39 2015 UTC,"Taurus has more raw bomb damage, but Jojo has more hp, and imo a more useful overal kit.  Of the 3, Soha has the lowest rune requirements to do Faimon hell, but with max runes Lapis is probably the fastest.  No ideas for last question."

I use susano, because I got 2 of him early on, and was able to max skill one (though it's not needed) off the light ninja HoH.  Takes 1-1:30 a run, never lost a run yet, Vamp/blade atk/crtD/atk.

I mean hwa is quite squishy but you can build her tank for the atb reduce and her and Verde r the dream team! Depends also on what runes you have and whether you have the fodder to 5 then 6* hwa!

summonerswar,3e2o2g,zzer02,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:27 2015 UTC,I'm a huge fan of using broken sets and would buy that rune in a heartbeat. 2-3 Spd/CrD rolls and it'd be perfect on Theomars. If you have a speed based damage dealer you could use this rune on right now I'd say using crystals to purchase it would be worth it.
summonerswar,3e2o2g,vajikarp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:46 2015 UTC,I need this for my Soha so bad  I would suggest buying if you plan on having a Vamp farmer in the future
summonerswar,3e2o2g,Fritztrocity1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:00 2015 UTC,"I would have bought it, but that is because I need to build my Leo into a Yoleo with atk crit d atk. That six star attack would be perfect for him plus I have the mana to buy it so I would have, but if you don't have a monster with vamp build then its a waste.

summonerswar,3e0rdl,trollinnoobs,2,Tue Jul 21 03:37:20 2015 UTC,"That's a semi-fair point.  I play on an iphone 4s, and yes I would be grateful for suggestions on how to avoid this.  However, I've read what I can find.  I go to an empty channel.  I use reduced quality.  If the best solution is to restart the whole game or even my entire phone just before doing a guild battle, that's ridiculous.  I can't remember the last time another app crashed on my phone, including clash of clans.  SW crashes daily for tons of us, and it isn't our fault for failing to do the right voodoo before every fight.  This is my helpful information for com2us: this game crashes WAY too often for me to put any money into it, and it's your fault not mine.  And here are my good suggestions: take these widespread bugs seriously, collect crash data (correct me if they already do--I don't think they do), and fix your terrible coding.  Something you could do TODAY, before doing difficult debugging: stop charging me energy and swords for fights that you know didn't even happen."

summonerswar,3e3gqz,KimchiSupreme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I might also add that you should get Ahman and Darion both great units. Also awaken and level up your Bernard (wind Griffin). First priority should be Lapis though. Nevertheless she is helpful only for farming purposes and ToA (somewhat). Then it's your Bella. Once you get evolve and at least 5 star Bella you should start trying B6-B8. Once you have better runes you can upgade to B10 and your team will be Kona (eventually you will replace kona with vero), Bella, Bernard, Shannon and Ahman. Ahman can be replaced with with the awakened wind Yeti if you can't have 100% crit rate on him.   That should be your plan for GB10  Also check this channel out. I found it pretty helpful when I was starting. In particular watch the Guide to Guardian Series.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp76b_m_wL_Mb5SFuDQlUsg"

If you run Sieq with that group (maybe thrown in Raoq for good measure) you should be able to pack a good punch.   You will also probably want to awaken and level up Rina (water epikon priest), but that's not going to help the 'too-tanky' feel of your squad.

Basically, pray you pull chloe and work on getting vero as fast as possible in the mean time.  When I'm in a rush I just skim the list for teams without a chloe to double lushen.  A fast vero is good for cleanses and maxed skilled can throw off double lushen team with stuns.   I'd probably be running Vero (L), Eshir, Bella (tanky as possible), Darion with you line up. Still no chloe but if you make tanky enough to withstand double lushen, you'll have a pretty decent team b/c of all the armor break."

summonerswar,3e30pg,Kenn_Patelli,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:02 2015 UTC,"you have a chasun so I wouldn't waste the slot for Shannon. go vero (I recommend speeding him up though), Bernard, chasun, bella, darion.  you'll have a couple sources of attack break which will weaken the giant. chasun heals and bella heals will be plenty. you win"
summonerswar,3e30pg,Kenn_Patelli,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:51 2015 UTC,oh yeah I didn't look at your acc #s and stuff. none of your stuff will land reliably. fix that.
summonerswar,3e30pg,dtm292,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:49:56 2015 UTC,Been trying a few combinations and since I dont have the runes with substats for accuracy I tried running Ritesh and lead 55% leader ac bonus and the team has auto'd 5 times in a row now. Thansk for that

I don't remember having this problem in last TOA. I breezed through 90+s. I think they buffed the floors? :("
summonerswar,3e30in,inzaij,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:07 2015 UTC,"Actually the floors where really easy this time around.   I'd recommend using Veromos, Bella, Verdehile, Baretta and maybe Chloe or Bearman."
