SciFiScroll,3e3p10,osakanone,-3,Wed Jul 22 01:51:58 2015 UTC,"Its more about the fact I find American television painfully difficult to watch. Your idea of what constitutes normal life, a home or a family is something I've never ever seen and not something I can identify with and your value systems confuse me.  People on American television are always so outraged when they don't get their way and they handle scenarios so poorly as if they're dumbed down as to not undermine the story itself by solving the problems they're faced with.  The original version is probably much better; almost all American adaptations of any television show from any other country completely miss the boat on the entire purpose of what that show was meant to be."

The cast is all Brits practically.    Humans (styled as HUMâˆ€NS) is a British-American science fiction television series, debuted in June 2015 on Channel 4 and AMC.[1] Written by the British team Sam Vincent and Jonathan Brackley, based on the award-winning Swedish science fiction drama Real Humans, the series explores the emotional impact of the blurring of the lines between humans and machines.

I'm frustrated that star wars tries to take over everything.  TL:DR - it's a bad video that you think is good because of ""starwars is always good""-colored glasses.  Because you linked to an article that had a youtube video imbedded in it, rather than the video itself.  Because the very beginning is annoyingly flashy, and doesn't even match up with the vehicle ignition noises.  Because Mad Max was perfectly fine on it's own, didn't need any star wars to make it better.  Because the music is really horrible for the scenes it is played over.  Because not everything needs to be turned into fucking star wars. There are other fandoms, universes, and not all of them are improved by laser swords, god damn it.  Because the Millennium Falcon is one particular ship owned by one scruffy guy who hangs out in back woods hick bars. It doesn't need to be everywhere anything PLOT happens just because star wars fanboys get a boner for it. Even if it did become famous, it is only one ship. There are more light freighters in the star wars universe than people in america - let some other fucking design exist.  Because a lot of people like the idea of SWVII-IX, but doubt that it is automatically a good movie worth watching, especially considering JJ Abrams tendency to have BS CGI effects take the place of good practical effects (and the effect that had on the prequels)  Because they used the overused ""what a lovely day"" clip, which doesn't mean fucking anything without context."
SciFiScroll,3dufp9,entertainman,2,Mon Jul 20 16:52:07 2015 UTC,Isn't the music from the mad max trailer itself?  Same with your last point.  This is just the trailer for the movie with Star Wars rotoscoped in.
SciFiScroll,3dufp9,superkp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:07:03 2015 UTC,"Edit: also the Mad Max trailer was ordered differently. Had better pacing.  Honestly, the ""what a lovely day"" in the trailer was pretty bad, too.  It only means something in the context of ""If I die now, I will be riding in Valhalla for all eternity"" - without that context it feels (to me) like a 13-year-old on facebook posting ""AHSTA-LA-VISTA"" when he leaves for summer camp, having never seen Terminator.  The music in the trailer was very fast-paced-mad-max-if-we-don't-act-we-are-going-to-die-right-fucking-now, rather than ""duel of the fates"" from star wars."

Just sufficiently capable of self-replication utilising nearby raw materials (whether or not this is pure sci-fi is more debatable) to cause massive damage. The notion of Grey Goo comes to mind.  ""Hey, check this out. We built some nanobots that can be let loose on a landfill site and they'll multiply and eat all the rubbish and... what do you mean 'how do they know the difference'? I guess... Ah. Ah, ok. Well, it was a nice planet while it lasted""  (I have no idea how feasible a miniature robot which can assimilate any nearby material and build a copy of itself is. Seems pretty far-reaching, but who knows in 100-1000 years time)  The idea of ""Smart robots"" suddenly becoming self-aware and pressing the nuclear self-destruct button seems far less likely. We'd have had to have had a chain of decisions of such massive incompetence that I'd doubt that even the most idiotic world governments would be able to sustain them in order to reach that state where we have world-altering decisions placed solely in the hands of robots with no ""off"" switch.  Similarly for e.g. power grids, transportation etc. becoming computerised. There's still going to be a human at the head of all of this, with over-rides in place. Even in situations where nuclear reactor computers get hacked, it doesn't result in a meltdown, more of a ""Oops. Don't think we should let that happen again...""  But perhaps one day we will have such sufficient automation that such a chain of poor decisions does become more feasible, and we find ourselves in a situation where an AI could e.g. shut down a power grid or bring transportation to a halt.  I think the danger is human stupidity rather than artificial intelligence."

The honest zero bullshit state of AI is that we have not made progress in over forty years. We have not even defined a vocabulary with which to discuss the problem domain. That's how limited we are in this problem: we can't even properly DISCUSS it yet.  As far as the most important hurdle is concerned: We have no clear indication of whether or not ""consciousness"" (the whole scary point of all this AI nonsense in headlines) is algorithmic, and therefore constructable with conventional circuits. It may very well be consciousness requires a non algorithmic computational model -- something beyond or current theoretical understanding in physics and therefore WAY beyond  our ability to produce.  People who fear conscious machines are literally living in a fantasy world that does not exist in objective reality at this time. It's sensationalist nonsense used to sell entertainment.  We can have a separate discussion of the problems involved with automation, but we need to start separation: These systems are not smart, they are not intelligent, they have no reason whatsoever to be using the term ""artificial intelligence"". Frankly on the part of computer scientists in the field it's on the level of intellectual dishonesty in my opinion: Those scientists don't want to make the distinction because ""A.I."" research sounds distinguished -- however, the work done does NOT support the use of the title.  Most things called ""artificial intelligence"" are nothing more than pieces of computer code which mimic various biological systems (often systems having absolutely nothing to do with intelligence)."

SciFiScroll,3ddek5,Blergblum,2,Wed Jul 15 16:16:23 2015 UTC,"""No one ever sees them.""  Great, so it's Lost 2.0."
SciFiScroll,3ddek5,Hellknightx,2,Wed Jul 15 20:09:58 2015 UTC,"Horray, they took the worst parts of Lost and The Dome and smashed them together."
SciFiScroll,3dekqx,StarFuryG7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:39:48 2015 UTC,I guess old Ned really did lose his head.
SciFiScroll,3dbs75,StarFuryG7,2,Wed Jul 15 01:18:36 2015 UTC,Seems to have the appropriate amount of cheese. Definitely on my must-watch list.
SciFiScroll,3dbs75,JusticeBurrito,2,Wed Jul 15 13:54:27 2015 UTC,Seems to have the appropriate amount of cheese.    I liked that they didn't avoid the age factor and actually tackled it head on by  showing him in a girdle at the beginning of the Trailer and making a joke out of it. Then later he remarks about having to do a little cardio because of how fast his heart was racing. They turned a downside in this youth-obsessed culture into a positive by making it funny. And Campbell is also great at knowing just how to play it too.
SciFiScroll,3dbs75,Felixader,2,Wed Jul 15 22:12:59 2015 UTC,Now i have. Halo shoat. I mean. Hula Shait. Goddmanit. I mean Hormpfhcough. Yeh. That was what i meant.

SciFiScroll,3dbbcl,Gary007Seven,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:07:29 2015 UTC,This is one of my favourite movies of all time.
SciFiScroll,3dbbcl,Silverlight42,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:27:56 2015 UTC,That movie was so under rated. preteen me just loved this movie from beginning to end.
SciFiScroll,3dbbcl,Ontopourmama,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:03:28 2015 UTC,I was a little underwhelmed when I re-watched it for the first time a year or so ago. I was too young when it first came out to be nostalgic about it but I remembered bits and pieces of it and I remembered it as a little grander than it was. I really wouldn't mind the same premise on a larger scale.
SciFiScroll,3dbcr2,Gary007Seven,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:18:26 2015 UTC,"Why in the world did they make a video about VFX improvements, but use crappy quality versions of clips from GoT to make their point?"
SciFiScroll,3d6zbm,StarFuryG7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:33:35 2015 UTC,Haven't watched any of this show yet. Is it actually sci-fi? Horror? Any good?
SciFiScroll,3d6zbm,JusticeBurrito,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:51:32 2015 UTC,"The premise isn't meant to be taken very seriously at all, at least not beyond their presenting it to you and you either buy it and stick with it or you don't. They don't go overboard trying to sell it to their audience, but they're just two episodes in so far, so it couldn't hurt to give the first one a look On Demand or online and decide for yourself."
SciFiScroll,3d6zbm,JusticeBurrito,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:08:11 2015 UTC,Thanks. Lot of summer shows on the DVR right now but I'll probably take a look when I have some time.
SciFiScroll,3d5xyp,StarFuryG7,5,Mon Jul 13 19:55:56 2015 UTC,"They mention pretty much everyone that has something to do with the show, but they don't give name service to Malcom McDowell who is shown in one of the 4 photos?"
SciFiScroll,3d5xyp,redSwitchDown,2,Tue Jul 14 01:01:35 2015 UTC,"That's Anthony Hopkins, though his hair is very McDowell in that shot."
SciFiScroll,3d5xyp,kaeldragor,2,Tue Jul 14 19:44:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, you're completely right. He looks Insanely like McDowell there. Thanks for the correction."
SciFiScroll,3d5xyp,redSwitchDown,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:12:15 2015 UTC,"You bet - when I first saw the image, I thought it was McDowell as well -- maybe that was the inspiration for the character."

SciFiScroll,3d30cs,Gary007Seven,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:59:22 2015 UTC,I tried so hard to get into that show. I liked the concept and the two main actors were great but the writing is shit and most of the rest of the actors range from mediocre to terrible.
SciFiScroll,3d30cs,GiveAlexAUsername,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:16:09 2015 UTC,"How many episodes did you watch, and from which season?"
SciFiScroll,3d30cs,GiveAlexAUsername,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:08:07 2015 UTC,"most of season one, probably averaged about 4 episodes from both season 2 and 3."
