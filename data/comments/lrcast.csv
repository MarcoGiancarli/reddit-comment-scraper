lrcast,3e5xgf,o_hai_mark,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:12:53 2015 UTC,"I question the use of cards like Bonded Construct, Ram Roller, and Aether Grid. I think maybe the inclusion of two of the biggest bombs in the format (Nalaars, and Hangerback Walker) covered up for some sketchy deck building.   You went all in on artifacts, but I'm not sure if that if that strategy is strong enough without artifact-aligned bombs. At least you got to live the dream!"
lrcast,3e5w3l,icetray,4,Wed Jul 22 04:59:17 2015 UTC,"1 mana 2/1's does not a control deck make. Also that 6 drop aven seems mediocre, and I'm not sold on the equipment. Otherwise seems like a good deck."
lrcast,3e5w3l,benikens,7,Wed Jul 22 11:25:19 2015 UTC,"Playing devils advocate here I would actually disagree about construct. In this format playing a 1 mana answer that trades for every early renown threat is serviceable for a control deck. If I were ever to play bonded construct, it's much more likely I would play it in a control deck that needed to trade early & help get to my mid-game than an aggressive deck where there are many much better creature options. With that said, I'm still hoping I don't have to run them in any deck."
lrcast,3e5w3l,Telemokos,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:06:11 2015 UTC,"You do make a good point, and I suppose OP's deck is a bit of a clunker on the curve so I can see that consideration."
lrcast,3e5w3l,benikens,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:17:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, [[Aven Battle Priest]] was definitely mediocre. I kept him in because I was thin on creatures and wasn't sure how low I could go safely.   [[Sigil of Valor]] seemed to work well. It's cheap, and was a nice complement to [[Whirler Rouge]]. There were times though where it wasn't worth having a creature attack alone, so I don't have a strong opinion on it yet."
lrcast,3e5w3l,Adjace-esque,2,Wed Jul 22 13:16:43 2015 UTC,The problem with Sigil is that it does stone nothing when you're behind. It doesn't really do enough on offense to justify running a card that only functions when you can afford to attack.
lrcast,3e5w3l,Adjace-esque,2,Wed Jul 22 13:55:59 2015 UTC,"This isn't a control deck. I guess it's an evasion deck. I was going to suggest tempo but your early drops are not great offensively. I question the use of Bonded Construct and Maritime Guard except as sideboard cards against Aggro decks, and Sigil of Valor feels especially out of place in a deck with 12 creatures and that you thought was a Control deck.   This deck looks like 1-2 quality to me. No bombs, some subpar commons, and the curve seems a bit heavy."
lrcast,3e5w3l,Adjace-esque,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:35:02 2015 UTC,"Good feedback, thank you. I've never quite been sure how to define control vs tempo. From deck lists I've read, there seems to be a fine line even between control and midrange at times.  One of my reasons for posting is that it was a pretty small draft with only 6 players. I was curious how strong this would seem in a larger field. 1-2 doesn't entirely surprise me. 6 players also meant fewer packs to pick from and I switched into this late which lead to some of the creature choices that made the final cut. From what I saw and heard, there weren't any real true bombs in the pool.   A couple people have mentioned that the curve seems heavy, and I'm curious as to how this is determined. Is it simply the two 6 drops? Everything else is pretty much 3 and 4 drops. Maybe that's ""heavy"" as well?"
lrcast,3e2rya,WhereIsShellBeach,19,Tue Jul 21 14:50:25 2015 UTC,"I would take Fiery Impulse. It is the least committing and with so much other good black and white in the pack, you're likely to keep the drafters to your left out of red for pack 2. Plus there's the outside chance that the  sergeant wheels."
lrcast,3e2rya,famouspotatoes,4,Tue Jul 21 15:04:12 2015 UTC,"This was my thought process as well, although I was considering Reave Soul. That said, I think Red is a deeper color than black in this format, and is able to support more players. Plus, you'll potentially still have nearly 2 full packs (Packs 1 and 3) to filter red before the people to your left. I'd be willing to take a hit on getting red during pack 2 for a tradeoff like that. Plus, I could just hit red hard in pack one to try to force them into other colors if the opportunity arises."
lrcast,3e2rya,Variable303,8,Tue Jul 21 15:13:16 2015 UTC,"I'd take Unholy Hunger before Reave Soul. Being instant speed and unconditional is a big deal.  I would worry about sending signals in general, and I certainly wouldn't worry about it here, since I can make a reasonable case for War Oracle, Fiery Impuse, Unholy Hunger, or Celestial Flare being the first pick (and ergo the second whatever you pick). You're not going to be able to be ""sure"" (insofar as you ever are) what color your putting the person to your left in."
lrcast,3e2rya,cferejohn,4,Tue Jul 21 15:53:43 2015 UTC,"True, but I feel like for me to take Unholy Hunger, I'd want black to be my primary color. In P1P1, I don't like committing that hard. At least with Reave Soul, I can play it in my secondary color (or God forbid a 3rd splash if I get hosed). Plus, the speed of this format makes me value early removal a bit higher, especially with so many good early renown creatures."
lrcast,3e2rya,Variable303,6,Tue Jul 21 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"Unholy Hunger is a card you are playing on turn 5 at the absolute earliest - you can pretty comfortably support it with 8 swamps. Reave Soul is a card that gets a lot worse if you can't play it on turn 2/3, meaning I'd probably want...8 Swamps. I just don't see either of them as being more committing to the other. I am almost never going to splash in this format, and I can 100% guarantee I'm never splashing Reave Soul.  My (brief) experienced hasn't shown me a format so fast that I feel like I can't play 5 mana instant speed removal."
lrcast,3e2rya,cferejohn,4,Tue Jul 21 16:03:56 2015 UTC,"That's actually really interesting that you would value unconditional removal over efficient removal in this set. In playing this format (I think I've done 4 paper drafts at this point), I have found reave soul to be excellent and fiery impulse to be somewhat lackluster (Just generally, it's not my main point). With regards to reave soul vs unholy hunger, I think it is more correct to take reave soul before unholy hunger. Reave Soul hits a large amount of relevant creatures after they've been renowned, but before you've been beaten to a bloody pulp. I like both cards and I think it's reasonable to play 7 swamps with reave soul, but it certainly gets better in the 8-10 range. While Reave Soul isn't the card that you would be splashing ideally, I would still consider it my interaction-light decks."
lrcast,3e2rya,wetwilly92,2,Tue Jul 21 17:19:42 2015 UTC,"This was basically my line of thinking when I said that. I don't really think the value of Reave Soul drops off that dramatically after turns 2 and 3, as there are still a ton of major mid-game threats with 2 or 3 power. Really though, Renown creatures are a huge threat early on, since not dealing with them early makes it difficult to catch up. And yes, I also feel that 7 swamps is fine for Reave Soul."
lrcast,3e2rya,Variable303,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:20 2015 UTC,"You make a solid case. I'll have to keep that in mind for the future. That said, my experience with the set so far has been that it's pretty darn fast. Not Zendikar fast, but I've already played with/against some red/white decks that curve out and end things quite fast."
lrcast,3e2rya,Variable303,2,Tue Jul 21 16:14:20 2015 UTC,"I'd take Unholy Hunger before Reave Soul. Being instant speed and unconditional is a big deal.   In this format, I'd actually take Reave Soul first.  A massive amount of creatures in Origins are 3 attack or lower, and 5 mana is a lot to spend in a format as fast as this.  If you can't hold off an aggro deck's advance, it won't matter what you can kill on turn 5."
lrcast,3e2rya,Greyfeld,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:27:14 2015 UTC,I think a big thing in reave souls favour early is that I'd rather have multiples of it rather than multiples of a 5 mana removal spell even if the latter is unconditional
lrcast,3e2rya,tmurdock,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:25:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I had 3 of those 5-mana removal spells in my last FNM draft, and I would have traded away two of them for Reave Souls."
lrcast,3e2rya,Greyfeld,2,Wed Jul 22 05:40:12 2015 UTC,Thanks! That's interesting. I think my skill level still hasn't got to the point of thinking about keeping others out of a color with my picks. Is the Impulse unarguably better than the Abbot? Would picking the Abbot have the equal effect of keeping others out of red?
lrcast,3e2rya,AMathmagician,3,Tue Jul 21 15:10:33 2015 UTC,"The Abbot is a fine card in the red decks, but it doesn't really make me want to go red.

lrcast,3e2rya,5-s,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:19:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. I find that when I read draft reports, often really off picks are due to people caring too much what they're passing pack 1. It's only a minor consideration."

lrcast,3e2rya,IzDaisho,6,Tue Jul 21 15:13:53 2015 UTC,"Removal in limited is extremely important, and Impulse is one of the best removal spells around because it's instant and it's cheap. Its inexpensive cost lets you develop board presence because you don't have to reserve your whole turn just to use it. Plus, with so many creature enchantments in this format, the possibility of getting a 2-for-1 with Impulse is fairly high."

lrcast,3e2rya,MaskedThespian,8,Tue Jul 21 15:24:37 2015 UTC,"I see a significant portion of the comments focusing on the other cards in the pack. I strongly disagree for three basic reasons.   1) You don't know what your neighbor will pick  2) You don't know what else is going into be in the pack  3) Having your neighbor to your left be in your color is not that bad  1) I'm not saying it's worth 0 consideration but in a pack like this you really can't predict how the draft is going to go. Your neighbor will second pick the best card in White, Black or Red if they first picked a card in any of those colors. It's even possible the green player could take Wild Instincts. Blue player will probably take the ""best card"" but judging by the disagreement in this thread, their valuation is just as likely to be different than yours as it is to be the same.  2) You really can't tell what is going to come throughout the rest of pack 1. Information in a P1P1 is such a small piece of the puzzle that is the full draft. If you can cut the strong cards from a color for the rest of the pack your neighbor will abandon the card they second picked as a false signal. It is also quite likely that you end up elsewhere. After all, your neighbor to your right can easily just be cutting your color.  3) Finally, being cut in P2 is really not that bad. You get your first pick and some players are still settling into a second color. You're far less likely to get the 5th pick bomb in P2 than you are in P3, because someone can just switch colors and move into it. It is true that you won't table much because the late cards will go to your neighbor, but that's only one pack. You also can spend most of the pack supplementing your second color and then be getting the good options for your main color in P3.  I think Fiery Impulse is probably the best card and I'll take it but whatever else is in the pack barely impacts my decision.  Do others agree with what I'm saying at all? Or see it from a completely different perspective? I see so much consideration about what you're passing in a P1P1 but I think it matters so little."
lrcast,3e2rya,LancesAKing,4,Tue Jul 21 17:37:17 2015 UTC,"People overrate the value of ""sending signals."" It's not completely irrelevant, but it should be one of the lowest things on your priority list. Higher priorities include (1) reading signals that are being sent to you, and (2) picking the strongest card."
lrcast,3e2rya,IzDaisho,13,Tue Jul 21 20:10:13 2015 UTC,"Abbott.   Excellent card.  Super relevant body esp for the cost, draws a card much of the time especially when you draw it turn 7.  2 drops that are good early (probably t3 so you can play a land) and good late are excellent.   Also Chapin says it's the most powerful card in the set in constructed so I expect it to be good for money.  (Phantom drafting notwithstanding)"
lrcast,3e2rya,pahamack,5,Tue Jul 21 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"I don't love red in this set, and I think it's overvalued at the moment-- red based removal is great early game, but being base red generally leads to a pretty linear deck (or rather it only shines in a narrow set of decks-- aggressive red based decks can be good, but I don't want to start a draft out assuming I end up in one-- you may end up splashing for red, or red can be your off colour, I'm not saying red is bad by any means). Fiery impulse is a great card, but there are two other great red cards in the pack, and by picking red, you might end up cutting yourself out of it in pack 2.    Assuming we aren't taking impulse, this leaves us Unholy Hunger, Celestial Flare, Reave Soul, and Wild instincts. I like Celestial Flare the least, followed by Wild Instincts. I can't decide which of hunger or reave I like better, but I would take one of the two here.   That all said, this pack is not possible, and you would never open this combination of cards in a real pack because of the way print runs work, so this is all a moot point."
lrcast,3e2rya,TheJediCounsel,3,Tue Jul 21 19:23:16 2015 UTC,"It seems like I'm going against the grain here, but I would probably have taken either Unholy Hunger or Wild Instincts.  There are a lot of good Red and White cards in this pack and I'd be somewhat worried about fighting it out for either or both of these colours with the player/s on my left.  On the other hand, there's only one Blue card (but it's not P1P1 material), one Green card (which is Green's best removal spell in the set, in my opinion), and two average Black cards, one good piece of Black removal, and a Black Instant-speed unconditional removal.  If I took the Wild Instincts then I'd do my absolute best to cut Green hard in future picks in this pack.  If I took the Unholy Hunger then I'd probably look to favour Black in the future but it wouldn't otherwise significantly affect my draft strategy.  So, other people of LR, where have I gone wrong in my analysis of this situation (aka why is my answer so different from that of most other people here)?"
lrcast,3e2rya,cferejohn,5,Tue Jul 21 16:16:37 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, most people are saying they would take fiery impulse because it is the best card in the pack. You are saying you would take the green or black removal in order to cut the color. Essentially, you're offering the best cards to your opponents in exchange for keeping them out of your color, which you can't be sure you'd succeed in.   I think this is wrong because a bird in hand is worth 2 in the bush. Why give away great cards in the hopes of being given great cards?  Maybe the packs to your right are bomb white and blue so they pass you all this great red stuff, and you cut red off from everyone to your left. There is also the chance that green on black gets cut, whichever you chose.  Then, you gave up a great card to secure a color that was never open, and now your deck sucks.   For the first few picks, just grab the best cards, not the lest common colors. Then when you see signals, even if you're not in the same colors, you hate drafted something that could have been used against you."
lrcast,3e2rya,TheJediCounsel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:45:25 2015 UTC,"I posted my thoughts on this issue slightly above this so I'll just refer you to that.

lrcast,3e2rya,samiamthelaw,4,Tue Jul 21 19:14:09 2015 UTC,Interesting. I haven't played origins yet (I have a cube problem) but my instinct was that the most powerful card in the pack is woracle. Lifelink is such a swingy ability.  If that thing gets renowned it's going to be a really bad time for your opponent.  But I suppose shock/bolt is really good.
lrcast,3e2rya,NotABadassOverHere,3,Tue Jul 21 16:23:35 2015 UTC,"It might be kind of dumb to say this, but maybe take the abbot because it's so powerful and monetarily valuable if that means anything to you? On pure power level I'd probably go with Fiery Impulse. Given, both of these are kind of risky and assume that the person on your left won't slam whichever other red card you pick as a signal, also noticing the Akroan Sargent.  The black removal is also worth considering, both are pretty good. And Waracle is kind of house as well."
lrcast,3e2rya,shamonic,2,Tue Jul 21 16:52:35 2015 UTC,It's worth ~$3.50 (TCG mid) right now. I don't usually go out of my way for paper cards at that cost just because they are kind of difficult to actually convert to value.

I love the abbot."
lrcast,3e2rya,IzDaisho,7,Tue Jul 21 18:18:50 2015 UTC,"I like War Oracle here. As a bonus, I think you'll get Enshrouding Mist back for pick 9."
lrcast,3e2rya,Cies88,3,Tue Jul 21 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"This is my pick, too. I think that the power level is very close and you are nearly guaranteed to get one of the two remaining white cards in the pack (either I'd be happy with).  War Oracle all the way."
lrcast,3e2rya,AMathmagician,5,Wed Jul 22 00:20:52 2015 UTC,"I'd take War oracle and put the drafters to my left in Red.  If I take the Fiery Impulse, I'm likely to not wheel either of the other Red cards, and maybe only end up with Bonded Constuct.  White I'm still fairly likely to wheel either of the other cards, and in this draft format, I'm willing to commit to white pretty early and shut the drafters to my left off of it."
lrcast,3e2rya,Cies88,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:18 2015 UTC,"I haven't played this set yet, but I was going to say unholy hunger. After reading everyone else say fiery impulse, I considered why one might be better then the other. Unholy hunger gets anything and probably 2 life, but it's double black and you can't play it until the late game. Fiery impulse won't hit big things, but it can destroy a renowned creature before it had the chance to turn on. That may be the more important factor in this set: early removal to stop the aggro.  Since it's just a single red you can splash it if you need it and there are evolving wild in this set, so it looks like that would be the better card to take"
lrcast,3e2rya,Greyfeld,2,Tue Jul 21 16:13:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's quite important to note that one of the biggest reasons Fiery Impulse is so good is that it trades up. It's a one mana spell that usually kills a 2 or a 3 casting cost creatures. Hunger is a 5 mana spell that on average will kill a 3-4 casting cost creature.   Just thinking of how it will play out in games is pretty valuable. If you're on the draw you can kill their two drop at the end of their turn two, untap and play a two drop. Now you have the first creature on board. In a format where Renown is extremely present that means your opponent will be forced to block you when they're tapped out. That is a huge advantage.  Another common scenario is that on turn 3 you'll be able to kill their creature, get in with your two drop and still play a two drop. Now you're way ahead on board (especially if you were able to get in with a renown creature).  Finally, it gives you flexibility in double blocking without forcing you to significantly stunt development. If you have two 1/3s and your opponent is attacking with a 2/2 you can double block. You know your opponent is going to have a trick but since you have the trump in Fiery Impulse you can block and bait out the trick, getting a two for one.   And all of the above is under the assumption that you can't achieve spell mastery. When you can, Fiery Impulse is now also killing four drops. The idea that I can play a 3 drop and kill their four drop in the same turn on turn four, is just a mind-boggling amount of tempo advantage that I can't really handle it."
lrcast,3e2rya,bitterrootmtg,2,Tue Jul 21 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"What an amazing pack, i would want to take flare to get into white but the double white is kinda meh for first pick, i would also consider abbot or fiery impulse, probably leaning flare at the moment but theres like 5 first pickable cards there"

Last week I said Fiery Impulse. It's less color committing, high quality removal is rare, and you need to kill early renown creatures.

lrcast,3e2rya,cferejohn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:56:45 2015 UTC,"Oracle. I'm not gonna fight people for red, and passing Flare isn't terrible since the card is pretty good, but by no means better than the b/r removal going left.  Impulse is good, but I like starting with a strong impact creature here, which, btw, can't be killed by Impulse until later (at which point the Oracle is probably renowned and out of Impulse range). Oracle is one of the best creatures a base white aggro deck can curve into and it's even solid if you draw it late, probably at least trading and giving you 3 life if you're behind.  I also agree with the person who said you can probably pick up the Mist on the wheel."
lrcast,3e2rya,AMathmagician,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:04:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with those who said that Impulse is one of the first cards you should be considering, but I'm still not convinced that I would take it over Abbot.  While it's great in the early game, I've found Spellmastery to be a little difficult turning on in your average draft deck (usually end up with 4-6 instants/sorceries, tops), and 2 damage stops being relevant after turn 4-ish, usually.  Whereas the Abbot actually gets better the later you get into the game."
lrcast,3e2rya,IzDaisho,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:07:12 2015 UTC,"Because of common runs, this pack would probably not happen in a real booster draft (It's just too good). But I think the question of what to pick here is something we'll know better in the future when we have a better picture of the format.  Right now, I'm probably just taking the abbot. Taking a rare is a better signal (a good drafter won't assume anything from a pack with just the rare missing), and it's close enough that signalling + rare drafting is a tiebreaker with all the other good cards. Otherwise, I might take Fiery Impulse."
lrcast,3e2rya,AMathmagician,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:43:47 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say Fiery Impulse. I think after that I would go with the Akroan Sergeant, but it's not as clear of a choice."
lrcast,3e2rya,IzDaisho,5,Tue Jul 21 15:13:06 2015 UTC,Why the Sergeant? I think it's like the 5th or so best card in the pack (and the 3rd best red card).
lrcast,3e4xr3,Demolishing,2,Wed Jul 22 00:04:10 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, and I agree that Renown is a big factor in making that way.   I think cards like Yoked Ox and Guardian of Meletis are going to be better than people initially thought since they can slow down the Renown train."
lrcast,3e4xr3,Nizzahon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"Usually LSV and Marshall don't go above average on vanilla 0/x type cards, but I think stuff like the ox and guardians of meletis are strong. the 2G spider that's 1/4 with reach is good too becuase it fights being chipped away at through thopters."
lrcast,3e4xr3,CelestialBeekeeper,2,Wed Jul 22 00:38:02 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on the spider, but I'm not sure about the Ox, or especially the Guardians.  Most of the aggressive renown creatures have low toughness and can trade with the average two-drop, so I'm not sure why the Ox or Guardians would be much better than them. Like, I can imagine a scenario where I might include the Ox if I was light on creatures, but other than that I'm not sure what the real upside is."
lrcast,3e4xr3,LarpingWombat,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:07:14 2015 UTC,"It is still early, but I tend to agree. The spider is great because it is a solid blocker that handles thopters. The Ox is ok, not sure how to feel about this card. There are very few creatures that I wouldnt put in before it, but having that 1 mana wall is nice if you need to slow things down (maybe u/w control?)."
lrcast,3e4xr3,shinianx,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:55:23 2015 UTC,"There are very few creatures that I wouldnt put in before it,   agreed. but i'll sideboard it in if i see my opponent has enough renown creatures. That guy wasn't getting sided in unless against aggro decks inthe past"
lrcast,3e4xr3,kccmtg,2,Wed Jul 22 01:57:48 2015 UTC,"Just from what I saw during the prerelease, I am going to prioritize two drops wherever possible. It feels a little like old Zendikar in that an early stumble can be difficult to recover from, but it's thankfully not nearly so skewed. The Renown creatures are problematic if you can't interact with them until turn 4, and most of the removal isn't efficient enough to rely on without falling behind on board state."
lrcast,3e4xr3,LarpingWombat,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:38:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I ran a deck with 3 Topan Freeblade, Consul's Lieutenant, and Fetid Imp in the 2 drop slot at the prerelease and felt like I was 3 turns ahead any time my opponent didn't have a 2 drop."
lrcast,3e4xr3,Greyfeld,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:05:44 2015 UTC,"This is entirely unsubstantiated, but I thought the 4 drop slot was over populated with great cards in DDF and it seems like Origins has even more good 4 drops. This makes it easy to skew a deck to be slower than you really want it, an easy trap to fall in to. Or, maybe this is just one of my personal weaknesses (I love me some 4 drops)."
lrcast,3e4xr3,mtg_liebestod,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:56:40 2015 UTC,I've noticed that red has a glut of great 3-drops.  It's a slot you have to be careful about overdrafting if you're going RW.
lrcast,3e4xr3,CelestialBeekeeper,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:59:30 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I agree. Red has 0 3-drop burn spells iirc. For good creatures you have... Akroan Sergeant and Boggart Brute at common?
lrcast,3e4zca,Rookyboy,5,Wed Jul 22 00:17:26 2015 UTC,"It isn't a bad idea to play for a while in the Swiss drafts, where if you lose in the first round it isn't the end of the world (you can get out 2-1, in fact).  That's one way to deal with variance, because sometimes even if you draft an incredible deck, you can lose in the first round. It also gives you more play experience in Limited, and allows you to see your opponents play certain cards and card combinations you might not have thought of otherwise.   That said, improving in Limited does take time, and sometimes certain formats just aren't the right one for your particular play style.  You will continue to improve though!"
lrcast,3e4zca,Nizzahon,5,Wed Jul 22 00:32:50 2015 UTC,I'll second the recommendation to play in the swiss drafts over 8/4s until you improve. You'll learn a lot playing those two extra rounds.
lrcast,3e4zca,johnts03,4,Wed Jul 22 01:17:52 2015 UTC,"I third these folks. Stick to Swiss for now/for awhile. If you're new to mtg you definitely need time to improve your game. Also, don't rage drop if r1 doesn't go well. Play all the matches. That's the best way to learn.   Ratings aren't everything by any stretch. However, I think Brian Wong (most recent former LR co-host) once mentioned you should probably consider sticking to Swiss or 6-2-2-2 unless your rating is consistently around 1750. (By the way, I'm definitely below that number... So I stick to Swiss and have for years. There's no shame in it.)"
lrcast,3e4zca,MrHalobender,3,Wed Jul 22 01:35:15 2015 UTC,"I'm consistently above 1750 - and hate hate hate 8-4's. Just my personal situation, but with the limited number of nights I can play Magic, the last thing I want is to go 0-1 and then wait for next week."
lrcast,3e4zca,cricketHunter,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:20:53 2015 UTC,"Yet another recommendation for playing in Swiss. Before starting to listen to LR, I played almost exclusively in 4-3-2-2's and maintained a rating between 1650 - 1700. My weakness was more in game play than in drafting. I switched to Swiss just before DTK, started noticing tighter game play, began going 2-1 or 3-0 on a regular basis, and ended up with a rating just over 1800."
lrcast,3e4zca,kccmtg,3,Wed Jul 22 12:50:33 2015 UTC,You should definitely be playing Swiss. I strongly suspect that you have a lot more leaks in your play than in your drafting and those are hard to tighten up without just playing a lot and Swiss lets you do that.
lrcast,3e4zca,cferejohn,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:45:15 2015 UTC,"I would say the most important thing is to rewatch your matches and be objective about the results. Try to look for misplays instead of what you did correctly. Hopefully you'll find more than you would expect. From there you have to identify the source of the misplays and correct it.  Are you playing too quickly?  Do you not have a plan?  Are you misassessing your role?  Are you undervaluing certain cards in the context of the game?  Are you failing to play around your opponent's cards?  There are a myriad of ways a game can go wrong. Don't worry about them, just be more conscious about it :)"
lrcast,3e4zca,IzDaisho,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:46:15 2015 UTC,"There is a variance and luck factor in limited, but my belief is that its greatly overstated. Tight play, good drafting, and excellent deck building can overcome nearly any bomb rare. It's something that takes time and dedicated practice, though. Ask yourself what went wrong with the draft, deck, or game play and what you could have done differently. Is there a sideboard card that you passed up during the draft? Should you have run an additional creature or spell in your main deck? Did you have answers in your sideboard and put them in between games without disrupting your deck's game plan? Is there a line of play that would have improved your chances during the game?  Long story short, without deliberately asking yourself what went wrong and focusing on improving, your skills will improve with practice, but at a pretty slow rate. If you can start to determine what your weaknesses are, you can focus on shoring up those weaknesses and will improve much more quickly."
lrcast,3e2xg0,chord_O_Calls,12,Tue Jul 21 15:31:29 2015 UTC,Sol Ring is the highest possible pick in Holiday Cube P1P1. Generates more mana than a mox and goes in any deck.
lrcast,3e2xg0,bitterrootmtg,2,Tue Jul 21 15:51:07 2015 UTC,"To be fair any mox goes in any deck. I agree that Sol Ring is the correct pick, but it's worth noting that the mox can be better later in the draft."
lrcast,3e2xg0,roarmalf,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:03:56 2015 UTC,"It's pretty rare that I'm taking a Mox over a Sol Ring at any point in the draft, but there are situations where it could happen. Generally you'd need to the mox to be on-color and your deck would need to have demanding colored mana requirements."
lrcast,3e2xg0,bitterrootmtg,5,Wed Jul 22 13:52:44 2015 UTC,I think Sol Ring is pretty clearly more powerful.
lrcast,3e2xg0,SirChuffly,4,Tue Jul 21 15:41:17 2015 UTC,The only thing comparable to sol ring is Ancestral Recall. I'd give sol ring the edge though
lrcast,3e2xg0,pahamack,3,Tue Jul 21 16:16:29 2015 UTC,"Black Lotus might also be comparable, but Sol Ring wins P1P1."
lrcast,3e2xg0,bitterrootmtg,3,Tue Jul 21 16:24:18 2015 UTC,"Lotus is arguably superior for some archtypes, but sol ring is close in those and clearly superior in most others."
lrcast,3e2xg0,deathdonut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:58 2015 UTC,"I think Sol Ring is clearly number 1, but do you prefer Ancestral Recall to Library of Alexandria?  The Library is weaker as a top deck, but takes a land slot, and takes over games if you have it in your opening hand."
lrcast,3e2xg0,costofanarchy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:10:56 2015 UTC,"Library, Bazaar, and Maze are all lands, but they don't take a land slot. Lands that don't generate mana shouldn't be displacing lands that do or else you'll find yourself stranded without enough mana.  Edit: nevermind, I'm dumb"
lrcast,3e2xg0,Manbeardo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:52:46 2015 UTC,"I agree about Bazaar and Maze, but Library taps for 1 colorless, so shouldn't really be in this list."

lrcast,3e2xg0,Manbeardo,3,Wed Jul 22 07:06:21 2015 UTC,Slam dunk Sol Ring.
lrcast,3e2xg0,procumbo,3,Tue Jul 21 17:04:32 2015 UTC,Sol Ring is probably the best magic card in cube.
lrcast,3e2xg0,beepbloopbloop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:03 2015 UTC,"I could see an argument of a mox if it's pack 3 and you're mono that color (red or white). But honestly, even then, when the mox is at it's best, it's probably unlikely that you'll have so many R or W symbols in your CC that the colored mana actually matters."
lrcast,3e2xg0,priceQQ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:39 2015 UTC,"For very low curve decks, you might want the colored mana.  If most your spells are one or two drops, then Sol Ring and off color moxen aren't as relevant.  Even then, Sol Ring and two mountains can cast two 1R cards on turn two."
lrcast,3e2xg0,costofanarchy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:14:18 2015 UTC,"Sol Ring is just the best.  The only Mox that I could theoretically see going above Sol Ring is Mox Ruby if you want to force Mono Red Aggro. Sol Ring is fine in that deck, but it uses so much colored mana that Mox Ruby is better in some builds.  It's not even clear that Mox Ruby is better in more than about 20% of mono red decks though."
lrcast,3e2xg0,oraymw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:58:39 2015 UTC,In a good mono red deck I would rather have the mox ruby 9/10 times.
lrcast,3e2xg0,roarmalf,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:09:17 2015 UTC,Sol Ring definitely.
lrcast,3e2xg0,FinalCactus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"Sol Ring is right. Sol Ring leads to turn 2 four drops, which in cube, are generally better than turn 1 two drops."
lrcast,3e2xg0,BonSequitur,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:46:55 2015 UTC,the real question is black lotus or sol ring
lrcast,3e2xg0,fike-the-bear,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:10:29 2015 UTC,No. Sol ring over lotus p1p1 always.
lrcast,3e2xg0,tyl110,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:01:45 2015 UTC,Time Vault is pretty much the only card I would pick of Sol Ring in any possible cube.
lrcast,3e2xg0,SleepingSheeperson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"And even then, it depends on how well supported Time Vault is in the cube.  I don't run Time Vault in my own (proxy) power cube because it's one of those cards that's only useful in a combo."
lrcast,3e2xg0,costofanarchy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:15:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but pack 1, pick 1, if I see Time Vault and Sol Ring, I'll be torn.  Sure Sol Ring is the better card on its own, but if you get Time Vault early, you can pick combo enablers way higher than everyone else.  Usually there isn't much of a reason to first-pick key or Tezz or even solid tutors if you don't have the Vault.  Sol Ring is a card that singlehandedly makes fair decks unfair.  Time Vault means you are unfair right from the beginning.  It's a little bit more of an all-in strategy, but it can pay off."
lrcast,3e2xg0,SleepingSheeperson,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:24:28 2015 UTC,and Ral Zarek regularly wheels. Time Vault is very hard to pass p1p1
lrcast,3e2xg0,roarmalf,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:07:37 2015 UTC,"In the previous Holiday Cube, LSV had a draft on stream where he opened Sol Ring, Lotus, and Time Vault P1P1. He went for the Time Vault, I believe. But it's pretty close, and Sol Ring should win out in a cube with less Time Vault support."
lrcast,3e2xg0,bitterrootmtg,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:55:34 2015 UTC,"Time Vault, of course, is no longer in the MTGO cube for exactly that reason - card was just too stupid."

lrcast,3e4n80,5-s,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:36:36 2015 UTC,"As far as your lands were concerned, they were probably fine - maybe 8 and 8, but your only WW cards were Celestial Flare and War Oracle. Your deck actually looks similar to mine, except I was a white seed and had Archangel of Tithes instead of Erebos's Titan. My only BB card was Languish and I went with a 10 Plain, 7 Swamp split."
lrcast,3e3krp,tntey,4,Tue Jul 21 18:12:33 2015 UTC,"Cube is a very difficult and complex format to draft if you're going in without knowledge of the older cards and their interactions. Things that will help you in this department:   Listen to the cube episodes of LR. Watch pros draft the cube. LSV has a number of good videos out there on twitch, CFB, and youtube. Watch/play Vintage and Legacy. Holiday cube play and deckbuilding resembles these formats to a large extent.   In terms of tips and best cards:   Outside of P9 and Sol Ring, the some of the best cards include: Mana Crypt, Mana Vault, Grim Monolith, Channel, Library of Alexandria, Mishra's Workshop, Demonic Tutor, Upheaval, Treasure Cruise, Jace the Mindsculptor, Snapcaster Mage, Mana Drain, Mind Twist, Yawgmoth's Will (in some decks), and Skullclamp (in some decks). This is off the top of my head; I'm sure I'm missing a few big ones.  Draft either a focused combo strategy that can ""go off"" and win quickly or draft a highly disruptive deck that is capable of stopping a focused combo deck from going off. The latter can be an aggro deck or a control deck, the important part is that it has the tools to disrupt the opponent quickly and consistently.  The mono-red burn deck seems like it doesn't fit into this ""combo or disrupt"" framework because it's an aggro deck that plays little to no disruption. That's because the mono-red deck is really more like a combo deck. It's trying to win very fast without interacting with the opponent. Moral of the story: mono-red decks need to have extremely low curves if they want to win. You can ""waste"" more picks in cube because there are more playables. This means you can afford to prioritize: (1) speculative picks, (2) mana fixing, and (3) sideboard cards."
lrcast,3e3krp,bitterrootmtg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:48:55 2015 UTC,"Are Channel, Mishra's Workshop, and Treasure Cruise that good in this format?  I know cube designers often opt to leave the first two out, because they're good when they work, but often don't do enough (Channel is fine with Eldrazi).  Also a card like Treasure Cruise, while still strong, isn't as strong as it is in constructed, because graveyards don't fill up as fast (now if you're playing a deck with a lot of cantrips and cheap spells, it probably goes up in value); it's similar to why Tarmogoyf is less than stellar in cube.  That said, I could be wrong, because the Holiday Cube is skewed toward high variance combos rather than solid cards that will be in demand for a lot of different deck types.  In my cube, a few other strong cards are Umezawa's Jitte, Mana Drain, Recurring Nightmare, Balance, Sword of Fire and Ice, and Tinker.  Is ""monofair.dec"" still valid in this format (this is an equipment heavy green/white creature-based ""fair"" deck that Brian Wong is a fan of)?"
lrcast,3e3krp,costofanarchy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:35:10 2015 UTC,"All three of those cards are good in broken decks, and broken decks are the best decks in the format, by and large. The first two are made better by the prevalence of signets. And there are so many ""oops, I win"" combos with Channel, from the obvious Eldrazi ones to the applications of the card in a storm or ramp type of deck.  I don't think monofair.dec is very good in powered cube. You need a ton of hate bears and disruption to make it viable. Jitte is about a ""C"" in this cube, and the other equipment (besides Skullclamp) is all pretty bad. Suiting up a creature and attacking for value on turn 3 or later is too clunky in the fast-paced environment of the powered cube. I do think this sort of deck is good in Legacy Cube though.  I agree that Balance and Tinker should be on my list of great cards."
lrcast,3e3krp,bitterrootmtg,2,Wed Jul 22 13:50:35 2015 UTC,"Listen to the cube episodes. This is probably the hardest format ever created, so don't expect to learn it all so quickly."
lrcast,3e3krp,priceQQ,2,Tue Jul 21 18:37:02 2015 UTC,a good start is to listen to ep 213 and the signoff of ep 214
lrcast,3e3krp,pahamack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:24 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm mistaken, you've only got today to play holiday cube - it goes away during tomorrow's downtime. With that being said, I think the easiest strategies to pick up quickly are mono red and G/W hate bears.  The best cards tend to be ones that let you cheat on mana - bitteroomtg has a pretty good list going. Like he mentioned, mono red is a combo deck where the combo is the fewest cards possible that equal 20 damage. Think 1 and 2 drop creatures and as much burn as you can pack. G/W relies on disrupting your opponent via cards like [[Gaddock Teeg]], [[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben]], [[Leonin Arbiter]] and so forth. Again, low curve is key. Ideally, you get ahead on board, make it hard to interact, and cast [[Armageddon]] or [[Ravages of War]]. If you can manage it, a black splash works nicely for discard and Nether Void.   The other tip is to have unconditional removal available, no matter what you're playing. [[Maelstrom Pulse]] is better than [[Abrupt Decay]]. White actually has the best removal with [[Swords to Plowshares]], [[Oblivion Ring]], [[Path to Exile]], and [[Banishing Light]]. Remember that your opponents are going to try and cast [[Emrakul, the Aeons Torn]] and [[Blightsteel Colossus]] as early as possible."
lrcast,3e3krp,kccmtg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:51 2015 UTC,"To add to all the other tips here, keep an eye out for two card combos in your colors.  Otherwise average or even underpowered decks can win games with busted two card combos.  There's also a lot in the cube, like Kiki-Jiki/Pestermite, Tinker/Blightsteel Colossus, Strip Mine/Crucible of Worlds, Metalworker/Staff of Domination, Channel/Emrakul, to name a few.  These combos make sure you have outs to win in every game, and if you pick one up early in the draft, you can even build around them.  Finally, there are lots of tutors in the cube, so even if you only have one two card combo buried in you deck, you can sometimes find one piece of it and tutor for the other. Two card combo honorable mentions: Karakas/Venser Shaper Savant:  this one is super expensive, and not that great, but casting Venser every turn to blank your opponents big threats feels so good.  The problem is eventually they hit the mana to cast their spell twice, or they have other outs to win. Soulfire Grandmaster/Time Walk: It's just like Time Vault/Voltaic Key!  Except it requires six mana...  And is easy to disrupt...  And you can't tinker for one half...  But other than that, they're totally alike!"
lrcast,3e3krp,Carribi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:10:22 2015 UTC,"I would say if I had to give advice in under 50 words.  Don't try to be fair, do something busted.

That's the overall theme of holiday cube. ""Fair"" decks are pretty garbage and if you're not doing something broken your hope is to tear apart your opponents plan with counter spells or hand disruption.

lrcast,3e1cdv,darrenoc,2,Tue Jul 21 09:50:19 2015 UTC,"I disagree. You just can't afford the tempo loss. Your card quality is so much worse than your opponent's. You need to start melting face as soon as you can.   Library requires you to skip a 1 drop and draw a card instead. You should never do that. Heck, bolting to the face is a much worse opener than t1 stromkirk noble yet I'd rather do that than draw a card with a red deck."
lrcast,3e1cdv,pahamack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:01:56 2015 UTC,"Library is excellent in monored. It's good for the same reason running 14-15 lands is good. It's good for the same reason Strip Mine is good. It's good for the same reason Wheel of Fortune is good.   The reason is simple: all your cards are cheap, and you quickly end up with extra mana that you wish you could turn into cards. Library lets you do that. Yes, you take a tempo hit, but you're drawing an extra card a turn for the whole game, and your deck has the ability to quickly vomit all this card advantage directly at your opponent.  And you know you're not required to use Library's second ability, right? You can just tap it for mana if, god forbid, the need arises."
lrcast,3e1cdv,bitterrootmtg,2,Tue Jul 21 19:59:43 2015 UTC,"You do realize there's a way to get immediate card advantage in return for a tempo loss right? It's called being on the draw, something you would never do.  Now, you may say, the difference is that library gets you more than one card.  Well yeah, if you're planning on playing no more than 1 spell a turn. The entire point of a low curve aggro deck is to deploy more than 1 spell a turn ASAP. As soon as you play 2 spells and a land in one turn your library turns off.  Turn 1 library will always be the wrong play in mono red, just as choosing to draw first is the wrong play in mono red.   Now you may say, but it's just a land! It costs nothing to put it into your deck!  There's a reason why monored is the best burn heavy deck. That deck is insanely colour intensive. Not only do you have colour heavy level up creatures like Kargan Dragonlord and Figure of destiny, but often your play with, say, three mana sources out is to play a double red 2 drop like Eidolon and then bolting your opponent's face.  But yes, I would play strip mine and wasteland because those lands are tempo gainers, not tempo losers like library. My deck has a lower curve than my opponent, and as such I can take advantage of stunting both of our mana development more than he can. This is the perfect example of a deck where tempo > card advantage. I love playing chrome mox in this deck."

Red's strength is in its dominance of the early game, and if you spend that time drawing cards instead of committing to the board, your five random beaters will look very silly staring down a [[Wurmcoil Engine]]. On the other hand, if you are all burn spells, then drawing twelve cards in a game will probably be enough to win, so keep that in mind.""  There's just no such cube deck that's ""all burn spells"", and 12 turns to win? Ha! That's not happening."

That includes any kind of aggro deck as well as some of the ramp or stax-ish decks that want to play an early planeswalker or similar engine card to take over the game. Tangle Wire just shuts the door."

Blade splicer is filler and early interaction is very important in cube.  p1p6 I would have taken godless shrine.If you wanted a removal spell, day of judgement is probably better than fiend hunter.  I can see you're trying to get creatures to combo with opposition. I want a card that makes a lot of creatures to even consider it. Something like an Elspeth or the 4/7 artifact with the tokens. Or deranged hermit.  p1p7 I guess you're taking an outside chance to be splinter twin? I think pack rat is the pick here. It is ridiculously powerful and I would take this on the off chance I may be reanimator or esper. Combos somewhat with opposition.  p1p8 Inquisition of Kozilek. I really value early interaction in this cube and I think this is a black signal.  p1p9 Woof, that's a late fireblast. I think it's too late to go into it here but, damn, the monored player in the table is going to get everything.  p1p10 I'd rather take the gb land on the off chance i want to splash something. I'm not fond of mental misstep.  p1p11 I have no idea why people pick land tax. I'd rather take the fetchland here. just in case.  p2p1 Elspeth to combo with your opposition??? I think 6 mana elspeth is severely underrated. It's one of the few ways to kill cheated in eldrazi, things like progenitus, and doubles as a win condition and is a lock with your opposition! I love Consecrated Sphinx too but the synergy with Opposition is just way too good. It's not that easy to get token makers that also serve as a control finisher role.  Anyway Im gonna stop here because the different picks  would make the signalling all different. I think the problem is you're taking fair, non-archetype definining cards like Fiend hunter and Blade Splicer way too early. I think in cube it's better to take either early game plays to keep up with your opponent, enablers like lands, or actual bombs. Midrange creatures like Blade Splicer are just a dime a dozen and not worth early picks."

In the final build I like Man-o-War in the main deck for sure (good value card and plenty of synergy in your deck between bouncing and opposition) over whatever you think is your worst non-creature (my vote is Land Tax but I'm sure some people would disagree with that).

This may fix the value of prizes being extremely volatile and sometimes making things like 2 man queues having prizes for first barely equal to the price of entry...  But non-tradeable?  That feels painful to me.  We'll see how this goes, but the increase of daily prices from $6 to $12 is making me wince.  It looks like the EV is better at higher winning percentages, but at close to 50% it actually starts becoming worse - and the $12 entry makes me less likely to try things out."

lrcast,3dywzl,Adjace-esque,20,Wed Jul 22 09:29:58 2015 UTC,"I think this is bad news for Limited grinders. Fewer packs being paid out in Constructed means fewer packs getting traded to bots. Fewer packs floating around the economy will drive up their price on the secondary market.   I don't want to get all conspiracy-theory about this, but it seems like a round-about way for WotC to try to sell more packs at full retail by putting fewer of them into circulations as prizes. You'll have fewer Constructed specialists unloading their packs to Limited specialists below retail.   As a Limited only player, it's literally nothing but downside to me."
lrcast,3dywzl,bearrosaurus,17,Mon Jul 20 18:41:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think you thought this through. More expensive packs are better for limited grinders because it makes the Event Ticket part of the entry fee less pronounced.  $4 packs means you get $32 for winning an 8-4 at an entry fee of $14. You get 229% back.  $2 packs means $16 for winning, entry fee of $8. You only get 200% here.  Don't get me wrong, my first impression of the new system is not positive (two currencies in addition to boosters? bleh). But let's try to stay rational."

lrcast,3dywzl,Locke_Daemonfire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:06 2015 UTC,"I think most of the people who go infinite dip into their packs before selling chase rares, especially when pack prices are high.  Even if you don't plan to play Constructed at all (I don't either), singles are more likely to retain value when the set falls out of the popular draft rotation.    I know that most of us aren't infinite, but I assume most of us would like to be.  I don't personally mind too much if the stakes get a little higher because it's just added motivation to try to reach that goal."
lrcast,3dywzl,Adjace-esque,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:43 2015 UTC,"I guess we're just operating on very different axes. I rarely find myself with more than 6-8 packs on hand, and I prefer to unload my rares ASAP (unless they've been climbing in value steadily) because I don't follow Constructed and I don't want to have to monitor my collection like a stock portfolio.   ""Oh shoot, that deck everyone was excited about did terribly at the GP and now a bunch of rares dropped from $10 to $2 when I wasn't looking.""   To each his own. I'd prefer a low stakes game, because I find more value in the draft experience itself vs. the challenge of going infinite."
lrcast,3dywzl,FinalCactus,3,Tue Jul 21 16:01:16 2015 UTC,"I think you need to look at it from a wider perspective. This will increase booster prices, this is known.

It's pretty easy to see, since more people spend more than they win, that this is bad for more people than it is good."
lrcast,3dywzl,Adjace-esque,3,Mon Jul 20 20:39:40 2015 UTC,"It's not irrational. I don't sell packs (except in extreme circumstances). They're just different entry tickets to me. If I win entry tickets in the form of packs -- great! But I don't care what I can sell them for, because I'm not selling. I'm only buying and consuming, meaning I want the cost to be low.   Your point would hold up if I equally enjoyed drafting vs. selling my packs for market value, but that's not the case. I much prefer the experience of drafting.   It's like if the price of milk goes up, and you argue ""You should be happy! That gallon of milk in your fridge is now worth more than it was worth yesterday!""

lrcast,3dywzl,Adjace-esque,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:42:54 2015 UTC,What utility am I gaining from selling packs? Packs aren't going to go above 4 dollars since that's the rate at which they are available on an unlimited basis from the store. Why would I sell something for <$4 that I can only buy for $4?   I only play Limited. There's nothing else I'm going to do with tickets. Maybe that's what you're missing?
lrcast,3dywzl,Locke_Daemonfire,3,Mon Jul 20 19:44:54 2015 UTC,"You should never buy packs for $4, you can get them from bots for just a little more than you can sell them for.  Generally I sell packs for two main reasons.  One is that I think pack prices will go down.  This is particularly true when the set is just released, and packs can be sold for near MSRP.  The other is when I just have a surplus of packs and need some event tickets.  If you play only like swiss drafts, this doesn't really happen.  But in more top-heavy draft queues or the somewhat larger limited events such as dailies, it's quite common to have a good run and have more packs than necessary for awhile."
lrcast,3dywzl,jadoth,2,Mon Jul 20 20:18:28 2015 UTC,"Also every time the limmited format changes you have to sell out of your packs and buy into the new ones either from bots or by entering ticket only sealed events. Low pack price are good for someone who does not carry a lot and is putting in money to draft all the time, but it failed s bad for people who either invested a lot at once or built up a lot of winnings and are trying to draft as long as possible of their current bankroll."
lrcast,3dywzl,dolpherx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:38:17 2015 UTC,"I do not really think this affects limited players as much. As even though the entry increases in terms of pack prices, the prizes also increases.  It only affects the players that play both constructed and limited as constructed is now more expensive to play in and the rewards is not up to par, at least compared to limited."
lrcast,3dywzl,Locke_Daemonfire,6,Mon Jul 20 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"Well, the Limited queues still spit out the same number of packs, so prize values go up too if prices increase. I don't think it'll be nearly as bad for us as it could be for Constructed players.  Particularly for the ones who don't play Limited and thus can't convert points into tickets very easily."
lrcast,3dywzl,pahamack,4,Mon Jul 20 19:32:45 2015 UTC,"High pack prices is a good thing for limited players.   If you win a lot, the packs were so cheap that you were essentially losing money when you 2-1 an 8-4 because FRF was so cheap.   Even if you don't sell packs, you probably do sell singles, and those prices will go up as well  Not saying I like this solution. In fact, it seems pretty horrible. Why would they introduce a new currency that's essentially just a rebranded phantom point? How many currencies will we eventually have?  This is clearly an attempt to fix the MTGO economy, just like offering phantom point only prizes for cube. Oh well, at least they're trying something.  EDIT: holy crap I just realized theyre converting our phantom points into these new play points.  Woot! I was just complaining about my phantom points being useless! I can draft with thesE!"
lrcast,3dywzl,Carribi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:31:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said, up to the currency bit.  All they are doing is essentially making change for phantom points so that they can play with smaller increments.  Having 5 play points looks a lot cleaner than having half a phantom point, even though they're worth exactly the same. I think your point on singles prices is very important.  Chase singes from the new sets will always be worth more than boosters, but recently they haven't been worth nearly as much.  I snapped up a fulminator Mage in one of my last MMA drafts without realizing that it was no longer worth more than the pack.  Inflating the price of singles will make it so much easier for us draft junkies, and I think that will easily offset the increase in cost."
lrcast,3dywzl,Adjace-esque,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:04:58 2015 UTC,"It's way too early to tell if the price of singles going up will balance the price of packs going up. It could go either way. It's baseless to say these two effects will ""easily offset."" No one knows that yet. There's more to singles prices than simple supply and demand."
lrcast,3dywzl,pahamack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:00:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it will work but this is obviously the purpose. They're shrinking the pack supply with this change, there's going to be a lot less packs being sold to bots. The theory seems sound.  Sure, power users will still be able to go infinite but it's not like they can play an infinite amount of games. Since the play tickets aren't transferable their effect on the economy will be limited. A person with thousands of play tickets will only be able to use them as time permits him to play games. Previously, the constructed  gurus of the world would just flood markets by selling all their packs for tix. Now they can't, and more importantly, don't have to do that anymore. People just want to play and this is facilitating that.  As limited players this is great news. If prices go up it will be much easier to keep the train rolling, and the greatest part is that all the play points I've been accruing through cube will now translate into Magic Origins 8-4s! This is quite possibly the magic change I'm most excited for this year!"
lrcast,3dywzl,eudaimonean,2,Tue Jul 21 04:31:50 2015 UTC,Singles will not go up sufficiently to cover the increase in pack price. The root cause of the recent tank in singles prices and of the general malaise in the MTGO economy in general was the increase in set redemption cost. This doesn't address that.   Keep in mind demand for digital singles is driven by constructed players (ie dailies grinders) anyway. It's very possible that this change could end up both decreasing pack EV and increasing pack ticket price.
lrcast,3dywzl,Carribi,2,Tue Jul 21 06:07:30 2015 UTC,"You may be right about the set redemption cost in theory, but that isn't proven fact.  Market value is driven by many things, and no one factor will single-handedly change a price in the majority of situations.  I think you may be underrating the effect of the large supply of singles compared to their demand. Not sure what your second point is.  I realize that dailies grinders are among the top of the target market for singles, but a decreased supply of singles is hardly likely to result in a downward trend in prices.  Economics largely don't work that way."
lrcast,3dywzl,eudaimonean,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:30:10 2015 UTC,"a decreased supply of singles is hardly likely to result in a downward trend in prices.   You're conflating the supply of singles with the supply of packs. They're two very different things online.  Where would a decreased supply of singles come from? Pack-ripping is a rounding error online. The only way singles enter the market online is through draft/sealed. The price of a booster has an influence on the supply of singles only insofar as it affects the number of draft/sealed events firing. So if you expect the price of singles to rise due to a supply-side issue (ie fewer singles entering the system), that's synonymous with saying that we expect the number of drafts/sealed to be fewer than before, which is merely another way of restating my original proposition that the net cost of drafting is going up, ie, the cost of singles is not going to rise commensurate to the cost of packs.  This is why a supply-side analysis is inappropriate in this case. The supply of unopened boosters of a currently drafted set is simply irrelevant to the EV of the singles within, as the supply of singles is actually only a function of the rate at which drafts fire. The demand-side - the cost of redemption - is the actual independent variable here."

Meanwhile, I think it's awesome. I hated avoiding 1v1 queues to grind Modern because Dragons packs were worth barely more than the 2-ticket entry fee (last time I checked you needed an 80%+ MWP to break even). This new system will allow me to turn the winnings into some amount of free drafts, which is great."
lrcast,3dywzl,zvazda,10,Mon Jul 20 18:45:05 2015 UTC,"Most of us are up in arms because we're the ones buying your packs for 2 tickets so we can draft on the cheap.

lrcast,3dywzl,Greyfeld,4,Mon Jul 20 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"FWIW, the ability to go infinite was completely nerfed when the pack prizes dropped so low (I believe Brain Wong has complained about that in other forum posts.) If those packs stabilize again, then you'll be able to amass large amounts of product from limited DEs and 84s and ""go infinite"" again.  Also, if single card prices rise again, it will help your draft price not rise a ton from this change.  Yeah, if you're the person buying the packs it's bad for you, but I always felt like I was cheating the system when I was buying packs for 2 tickets."

But if you truly want to go infinite in limited you need to build up a big enough pack capital that you can cash them out for tickets when you're done drafting each format and then you have enough of a BR to lose a few drafts without losing your online capital.  In order for this to happen, pack prices have to be relatively stable."
lrcast,3dywzl,zvazda,2,Tue Jul 21 13:02:50 2015 UTC,"Mostly I play Limited. This will likely increase the cost of Limited by some amount, but that amount remains to be seen, and my guess is it will be negligible.  Also, with less packs in the economy, the other effect is less singles. Prices of singles will also increase, which will also potentially decrease the total price of Limited.  I wonder what would happen if these Play Points were introduced as prizes to Limited queues.  Also, as /u/zvazda chimed in with out of nowhere-- selling packs for entry fees will yield more total tickets, with more expensive packs. Additionally, packs may not as rapidly depreciate in value, which is useful to those who may take breaks. It's entirely possible this thing will just even out in the end, with positive benefits for Constructed players."
lrcast,3dywzl,carpeamentum,4,Mon Jul 20 19:03:08 2015 UTC,I'm not sold on the idea that prices of singles will increase. That is assuming a meaningful % of the prizes won in Constructed events were just opened instead of sold or used as Limited event entry. Obviously I don't have any data but I feel like the majority of grinders know that busting a pack is a huge waste of money.   We'll see I guess. But I think we'll see pack prices creeping up a bit. No it's not catastrophic but it's definitely WotC putting restrictions on the secondary market by paying out non-tradeable stuff.
lrcast,3dywzl,zvazda,2,Mon Jul 20 19:08:38 2015 UTC,"I thought the idea was that if there wasn't a high incentive to play constructed queues, then there is less demand for cards, so singles prices are lower?"

But if you do daily events, while this is a short term improvement, it is a long term decline.   The reason that wizards is making the change is as a response to the communities complaints about how the EV of the constructed events are very poor compared to what they were a year ago. While this change improves the EV for those that want to grind events compared to today's EV, it is still not comparable to EV from a year or so ago, where the EV was higher and also more liquid as the prizes were in packs instead of play points that are not tradeable."

No idea if this is 100% accurate, looks like the math is up in the air right now, and my own knowledge of MTGO is very limited.  Also, phantom points are merged into these new untradable points."
lrcast,3dywzl,theothersamb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:09 2015 UTC,"Phantom Points become Play Points at a 6:1 ratio. (6 Play points for each phantom point) Phantom Points no longer exist.  Play points are won through constructed queues and daily events only. (Not drafts, and not scheduled events like PTQs)  Play points can be used as entry into all events at a ratio of 10 play points for every event ticket the event costs. (Including drafts and PTQs)  Price for Daily Events is increased from 8 to 12 event tickets.  Prize structures for events that pay play points have changed to accommodate. (Obviously.)  Phantom Points become Play Points in the very near future (next week or so). Play Points entry options go into effect after the August 12th downtime.  General consensus is ""We'll see how this plays out"" with the expected amount of people saying they hate the change.  Hope this TL;DRs this for you easily enough."

Never scoop.
lrcast,3dyvtn,pahamack,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:57:09 2015 UTC,".....and this is why people should be jumping the cube queues, especially now that the phantom tix are going to be transformed into the new tix that can be used for drafting regular drafts. This could be an opening to make a nest egg for going infinite. Stromkirk Noble is a pretty good sign that your opponent is playing a red aggressive deck with burn and haste creatures. It probably telegraphs that burn is the primary plan. If the thinking is that red can't take care of Iona, then just leave her back to block.  The quality of opponent in regular 8-4s is just so much higher. I think a lot of people who aren't MTGO grinders are taking this opportunity to play some sweet cube.  Yesterday I had a 6 card opener that had one basic land,2 business spells, mana crypt, fastbond, and a signet. My opponent takes fastbond after thoughtseizing me t1, and my mind was blown. I thought I lost that game right there and then on turn 1. It was literally the worst card in my hand. I went on to cast a topdecked ancestral off simic signet and have a crapload of mana available on turn 3, and locked him out with strip/crucible."
lrcast,3dzgb1,Variable303,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:56 2015 UTC,"[[Valeron Wardens]] did a ton of work for me at the pre-release.  I had a R/G deck with 9 renown guys, two of which were the Wardens.  I also had a couple of [[Subterranean Scout]]s, which is really good at getting most of the renown guys through the first time.  I even had one game where I got down both Wardens at the same time and drew something like eight extra cards total.  Also, the curve of T3 Wardens into T4 Wild Instincts, kill your blocker, hit you for three, trigger renown and draw a card is filthy."

lrcast,3dzgb1,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:31 2015 UTC,I wouldn't necessarily consider Valeron Wardens to be a surprise performer. I think most people saw the potential of a 3 mana 1/3 that could potentially turn into a 3/5 and draw you cards. I definitely think Subterranean Scouts is better in this format than it might be in others due to the ability to get renowned creatures through.
lrcast,3dzgb1,johnts03,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:00:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not usually too big on creature enchantments, but Grasp of the Hieromancer ended up being really great for me in multiple games. I played somewhat aggressive W/R and W/B and this helped me maintain pressure. Worked really well with menace and it doesn't hurt that it triggers Blessed Spirits.   Necromantic Summons is another card that I passed on a few times, but I got absolutely wrecked by it on a couple different occasions. That said, I'm still not quite sold yet...  Likewise, Shadows of the Past seemed to work really well for my opponents (got killed by it a couple times). For some reason, I thought you had to pay mana to trigger the scry ability at first, but the fact that it requires nothing makes me want to try this out in the future.   I thought Somberwald Alpha was fine coming into the prerelease, but since playing with/against it, I'm definitely higher on it than I was before. It just messes up combat so easily.   The one card that I was really high on that didn't really live up to expectations was Whirler Rogue. That may be because I never really drafted a thopter-focused deck. I mean, it performed fine, but I never really felt all that powerful casting it. Another reason why I might feel this way is because it seemed like I already had a lot of creatures with flying. Don't get me wrong, I'll still take this fairly high, but maybe my initial expectations were too high. I guess I feel like for this to really REALLY shine, it needs to synergize with other cards."
lrcast,3dzgb1,johnts03,2,Mon Jul 20 20:33:45 2015 UTC,"I played Necromatinc Summons in a BR deck that was light on bombs but did have [Enthralling Victor]], [[Act of Treason]], [[Nantuko Husk]] and [[Blazing Hellhound]]. Being able to steal one of their creatures (especially one of their bombs), hit them with it, sack it Nantuko Husk, then bring it back with Necromantic Summons (potentially with +2/+2) was pretty great. Other than Act of Treason, all of these are relatively solid cards on their own and having multiple Nantuko Husks makes this even easier to pull off.   In a more general sense, I think a deck that lacks a bomb but has a few pieces of (relatively) unconditional removal like [[Unholy Hunger]] or [[Cruel Revival]] can make good use of Necromantic Summons by killing the opponent's bomb and stealing it from the graveyard.   Regarding Whirler Rogue, I also drafted a UW deck with a fair number of fliers and thopter generators, including [[Thunderclap Wyvern]], as well as a couple of [[Seperatist Voidmages]]. I'll agree that the second ability wasn't always relevant due to the large number of fliers I had, but being able to potentially get 2 2/2 flies (with the pump from the wyvern) is solid value. Also, there were a handful of games where I couldn't attack through the air reliably and being able to tap two thopters to get in for 4 unblockable damage with my [[Watercourser]] won me the game."

Summit prowler was already good. I will be picking this quite highly in G, even with the pretty fierce competition in the set at the 4 slot.   I found Whirler Rogue great as well-- it can make your outclassed watercourser four unblockable damage per turn during a stall or to win, provide 3 turns of chumping when you're behind, and massively develops your board on four."

I could also think you have 1 too many lands. Between your signets, other artifacts and mana elves I feel like you may have gotten flooded a bit? But maybe not.  You also seem slightly threat light so the nissa would be good. I would also main deck maelstrom pulse over decay. Most decks are going to try and put out something big and I feel like you're slightly light on catch all answers. The decay hit aggro decks better but those aren't too common in this cube and decaying a signet or something seems meh"
lrcast,3dybdg,acebob58,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips. I debated for a long time how much lands I needed. I flooded a touch in a couple games, but on the flip side I always had all 3 colors by turn 3 in every game but one.

I'd really like Brainstorm too since there are a few shuffle effects and it seems pretty good.

Occasionally it will be right to untap some forests, but usually she's there to apply heavy pressure.  Tezz 5 doesn't do much in your deck. Gets you from 5 to 6 and 7, but a land would get you to 6 just as well and the pipe dream of just slamming a Wurmcoil or Battlesphere into play isn't really insane enough to warrant the difficulty of it."

The set though looks more interesting having drafted once than it did just going by previews. I think there is some real depth here waiting to be discovered, and I'm not expecting the next two months to be a chore, draft-wise.  I'd have to nominate Maritime Guard as a card that I would rate higher than I did before. It is great for holding off 2-drop Renown creatures who just want to get in for that crucial combat damage. Separatist Voidmage is another that impressed me."
lrcast,3dxmif,LarpingWombat,2,Mon Jul 20 11:20:48 2015 UTC,"It looks like your deck was just too slow and your 4 drop slot was overdrafted. I had a similar issue in my prerelease sealed event when trying to build my U/R deck: too many great 4 drops and not enough good 2 or 3 drops. If you have the removal to get you to the mid and late game, then you can do ok with a 4 drop skewed deck, but you didnt have that."
lrcast,3dxmif,ErasmusFenris,2,Mon Jul 20 12:11:13 2015 UTC,"I have not drafted yet so I really don't know, but looking at the cards green seems to be the worst to pair with blue. Green goes well when boosting other creature cards and doesn't have good straight up removal. Blue has bounce and claustrophobia and green has fight and growth but what both need is a secondary color with straight up removal like red's burn. My inclination is to think that blue pairs best with black or red in this set for those reasons. I'm new-ish and that is just my take on the format without actually having played it"
lrcast,3dxmif,protectedneck,2,Mon Jul 20 14:52:00 2015 UTC,"I think your deck would have been improved by not running the Bonded Constructs or Maritime Guard. Those are really suboptimal. I understand you want artifacts to enable the spy network, but these are just not what you want."

It seems really hard to break but apparently it's pretty amazing in a deck where you know you can make loads of mana, such as a green deck.   In this game I locked my opponent out just having a bitterblossom in play. I actually used channel as, essentially, a lotus petal on turn 3 just to get it into the field because my opponent had used his previous 2 turns casting vamp tutor into demonic tutor after a t1 putrid imp, signalling that animate dead or similar was coming out next turn.  By the time he had 5 mana to cast animate dead i had so many fairie rogues out to block, and he can't draw with griselbrand because nether void limits him to one spell a turn anyway.  Now I'm wondering how else to break this card, other than in a green deck. It's probably good in artifact ramp as well."

lrcast,3dwyx7,SinibusUSG,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:35:03 2015 UTC,"I mean, the classic way to break Nether Void is to be aggressive. Between Garruk and Freyalise you ended up with a bunch of stuff on board, but T2 - Bitterblossom into T4 - Nether Void can often be nearly enough to win on its own. God help your opponent if you also have the ability to add more pressure with low-cost aggressive creatures.  The reason it gets passed, I'd imagine, is because people tend to draft aggro strategies less in Holiday Cube, and especially not black aggro, since that was mostly cut from this iteration. Nether Void is a deck without much of an on-color home."

lrcast,3dwyx7,ArsIgnis,3,Mon Jul 20 13:55:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the stronger a format is, the less ""quadrant theory"" applies. This is especially true of powered cube. You know what else sucks from behind? Fireblast. Sulfuric Vortex. Shrine of Burning Rage. Armageddon. Mana Drain.  These are all first pickable cards because stronger formats follow different rules than regular draft. If you fall behind even a little bit the cards are so strong that you will probably lose, getting locked out of the game. As such cards that get you ahead (fast mana, for example), in the developing stage are the best first picks, and cards that keep you ahead by generating value are also great (planeswalkers are a great example of this). Planeswalkers aren't very good when you are very behind, for example, on a flooded board, because they're just gonna die, but they're very good in cube.  Why would you play this card in a storm deck? You want to cast lots of spells in a turn. Why would you tax yourself for every spell?"

lrcast,3dwdl8,GarrukDraftwinner,9,Mon Jul 20 02:15:05 2015 UTC,"I played against two of them yesterday and I found them to be more of a nuisance than anything.  The problem with Willbreaker being a card that requires a lot of setup is that it asks you to do things that aren't good on their own to get value out of a card that also isn't very good.   To begin with, the kind of cards you want to target your opponents' creatures with are removal spells, which don't really work well with Willbreaker. Assuming you're not cutting removal, most of the time you have to either target with cards that have otherwise underwhelming effects (like Send to Sleep), spend an entire turn's worth of mana (like Rogue's Passage), or grant a benefit (like Stratus Walk).   The cards with underwhelming effects aren't very good to begin with, so putting those in your deck to combo with Willbreaker is playing two bad cards to make one good one. The other ways to target aren't very good because they set you very far behind when Willbreaker leaves the battlefield. Either you're down a card, you're down a turn, you've given your opponent a creature back better than it was when you got it, or some combination of those.  If you take a turn to cast Willbreaker, then take the next turn to spend a card to steal a creature, and your opponent untaps and kills or bounces Willbreaker, that's a huge setback. If your opponent doesn't do that, it's still dangerous to attack, because if your opponent can get rid of Willbreaker at instant speed you can pretty much get your board destroyed and give your opponent back enough creatures to win.  And then, if you end up having a Willbreaker with no targeting effects, or a bunch of mediocre spells that target and no Willbreaker, you're in a terrible position.  Sure, if you have the right cards, are in a position where you can spend several turns to get the combo going, and your opponent has no removal you'll probably win, but that's true of most cards. On the other hand look at the flip side of things: When my opponents cast Willbreaker and I was winning, by the time they could get value out of it I was already too far ahead. And when my opponents cast Willbreaker and I had a removal spell, I just let them throw away some cards/turns trying to durdle around with it, then killed it.  I mean, I love effects that steal things, but this guy is hardly a Roil Elemental."
lrcast,3dwdl8,CelestialBeekeeper,8,Mon Jul 20 03:30:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think people realize how many incidental ways there are to target your opponents' creatures in this set. It's kind of crazy, actually. Eyeblight Assassin, Yeva's Forcemage, Rogue's Passage, playable auras, Whirler Rogue, Akroan Jailer, Alchemist's Vial, Anointer of Champions, Bounding Krasis, Disciple of the Ring, any combat trick, Heavy infantry, planeswalker activations, Kytheon's Irregulars, Nivix Barrier, Sentinel of the Eternal Watch, Reclusive Artificer, Subterranean Scout.  All of those cards are playable without horribly skewing your deck towards playing willbreaker, and I think that if you can get a critical mass of effects like these it's worth playing.   Worth playing in every deck? Hell no. First picking over fiery impulse/Sentinel of the Eternal Watch? Fuck that. But some blue decks really don't mind having this card. It can be good."
lrcast,3dwdl8,ScaldingHotSoup,4,Mon Jul 20 05:19:52 2015 UTC,"Playing bad cards like Akroan Jailer, Alchemist's Vial, and Nixiv Barrier or 1-for-2s like combat tricks or auras to enable your Willbreaker is a recipe for the disaster and exactly what Marshall and LSV want listeners to avoid.  Sure, they are decent to good cards that enable Willbreaker, but they aren't that common and it takes a critical mass before Willbreaker is even playable. The deck building set up cost is so high that in most cases Willbreaker is sipmly prohibitive.   If you can pick it up late and already have decent to good cards that work with it, sure. Pick it up and run with it. However, Willbreaker isn't worth warping your deck around.  I don't think it is an F, but I am going to assume that is more of a cautionary tail than anything else. I'd view Willbreaker as a D level build around."
lrcast,3dwdl8,dumac,3,Mon Jul 20 06:11:54 2015 UTC,"None of the cards you've listed are bad are universally bad. Nivix Barrier is actually quite good in certain blue decks. Alchemist's Vial is perfectly acceptable in a renown deck. Akroan Jailer is also excellent in certain white decks. Combat tricks are actually an incredibly important part of this set since there isn't nearly as much instant speed removal as normal. Auras (particularly infernal scarring) are not always 1 for 2s and can provide some great pressure in some cases.  I'm not trying to say that Willbender IS good. I'm saying it CAN be good. I'm also not saying that it's worth building a deck around. We're on the same page, in general. I just think that in a deck that already has those cards (say a blue/white deck), it can be quite good."
lrcast,3dwdl8,ScaldingHotSoup,-4,Mon Jul 20 06:20:52 2015 UTC,"Akroan Jailer is a horrible, unplayable card. I can't imagine winning a game in this format where I'm paying 2W every turn to tap down an opposing creature, after having spent a card for the ""privilege"" of getting to do that."
lrcast,3dwdl8,BonSequitur,2,Mon Jul 20 12:04:47 2015 UTC,Except you don't use it every turn. You use it in tandem with sentinel of the eternal watch to get your evasive threats in for damage. Saying it is unplayable is incredibly narrow-minded. I saw it mainboard in multiple top 8 sealed decks and at least one of the draft decks as well.
lrcast,3dwdl8,ScaldingHotSoup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:40:54 2015 UTC,"Unless you're talking about a few hundred prereleases, I think small sample size can be at play. Did you check how many losing decks had Jailer? Or how many games had Jailer on the board on the critical turn? Did the winning Jailer decks all tend to play the same other cards, implying there's a narrow archetype role it plays? What decks lost to the Jailer deck, was there a pattern? What decks beat the Jailer decks, was that a pattern? These are all important considerations, ""a deck with this card won"" is irrelevant without all of those variables and a large sample set.  ""Unplayable"" cards usually work really well in particular board states. The rating is not there because they can't perform, it's there because the opinion of the rater is those board states are either unlikely or impossible for you to engineer. I think it's better to give them a percentage of unplayable, like build-around-me cards. A ""20% unplayable"" card would be one you can pick high, but have to warp your deck around, where an ""80% unplayable"" would be a card you pick up late after assembling a great deck that happens to want it. I think Jailer is 80% unplayable.   Jailer's great in a very dedicated fast-damage deck. You're taking a major resource hit every time you tap a blocker down, but you're expecting to be hitting for 6+ damage every time and aiming to finish with a surprise Kytheon's Tactics. You want creatures like Blessed Spirits and Stalwart Aven, because you're anticipating they'll at most get one flying blocker out before you're ready to start swinging for 8+ damage per turn. Grasp of the Hieromancer is a menace in this kind of deck, and Heavy Infantry is also a superstar. This is a solid plan, has lots of support, and by the middle of pack 2 I can see decks that make strong arguments for windmilling an Akroan Jailer.  But if you're missing much of that, things can go wrong in a hurry. Turn 5, if you're starting your assault, you get to play a 2-drop. What if they drop something significant like an Embermaw Hellion or Deep-Sea Terror? You can tap that down, but next turn you get at best 3 mana to play a creature/spell and they get another 5-6 mana worth of creatures. They play a Ghirapur Gearcrafter and Boggart Brute. How do you win this game, short of producing a Languish? Now think about some cards out there that blank you: Seismic Elemental, Conclave Naturalists, Eyeblight Assassin... these are cards people will always have and unless you have the perfect Jailer deck they start to outvalue you the moment you start tapping.   I would wager that the decks where Jailer is really good can win without it, but they're happy to have it. It's arguable Anointer of Champions is just as useful, but there's definitely some cards in the 3-mana range that are worse to have than Jailer (and I think the ability cost on Jailer is more important than CMC.) I would wager that decks with Jailer that do not have those would be better served with a high-impact cheap effect like Suppression Bonds or Celestial Flare. It slows down your board development, which seems very counter to what most of the go-wide explosive damage decks want to do."

lrcast,3dwdl8,Airplace,2,Mon Jul 20 22:32:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure one great success with it makes it not an F. But I certainly think it's rating depends on how much removal you face, and I could see pods where people open more bombs then removal this card being powerful.   That being said, I prefer consistency then variance."
lrcast,3dwdl8,Searff,2,Mon Jul 20 11:28:33 2015 UTC,"Doesn't throwing knife target at every attack step? You can probably run it. It is already a good equipment on its own and repeated target. There are also various other cards at common and uncommon that are playable on its own that have been listed throughout this thread. This card if the opponent has no removal, is amazing. The counter argument that it dies to removal is the same for every other creature. If you are playing unplayable cards to make this card good, then that is bad, but if you are playing playable cards already on their own like the knife, this card is good.  On another note, Alchemist's Vial is a very good card I think that many people have underrated. Two drops are quite scarce in this set I feel, so having more 2 drops which is for free anyways since it gives you back a card is very good. Additionally this card is very good for renown creatures at early parts of the game. Late in the game this is often used to do the killing blow."
lrcast,3dwdl8,dolpherx,0,Mon Jul 20 17:53:07 2015 UTC,"Doesn't throwing knife target at every attack step?   No, it only targets when you use its ability, which means you have to sac it."

lrcast,3dwdl8,CelestialBeekeeper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:09:54 2015 UTC,"Something to add to my previous response. This is similar to Arcbound ravager and spellskite interaction in modern. Archbound ravager's modular ability is the following ""When it dies, you may put its +1/+1 counters on target artifact creature.""  This ability will trigger when arcbound dies where as part of the triggered ability, you have to target a creature. An opponent with spellskite can then respond to redirect the ability to the spellskite. Then the person controlling the arcbound as the ability resolves may choose to use the ability or not.  Throwing knife's ability is the same."
lrcast,3dwdl8,dolpherx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:20:51 2015 UTC,"However, you have to sac it as a cost to using its ability.  You can't target with its ability, then choose not to sac/use it afterward.

lrcast,3dwdl8,Greyfeld,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:34:06 2015 UTC,"The problem with Willbreaker is that while it can certainly be good there is a tremendous set up cost a 5 mana double blue spell that is also a card is there first since Willbreaker is a creature it can attack and block but if it dies you lose everything the first targeting is like an aura that can be killed with creature removal and the blow out you experience is only greater when more creatures have been taken, now some auras are playable and creatures of this type may also fall into this category and control magic is an insanely powerful effect but there are a multitude of ways to cause blow outs it in all 5 of the colors in this format and at instant speed in four of them. In addition to that it sort of feels win more to me, like your taking a creature is great when you're behind but to achieve that you need to be able to cast a 5 mana creature then target their best threat likely at instant speed because if you're losing their best threat is likely tapped from attacking you then dodge any kind of interaction."

I had an aggresive GW deck. Didn't see it game 1. Game 2 he got it down and stole my best 2 creatures. I had no removal that could touch it and the game was over. Game 3 he got it down too late to steal anything, and it was just a chump blocker the turn before he died.   The card won him a whole game, and probably got him most of the way to his 4-0 position before I showed up, but yeah, it's conditional, but I think the power is worth it. I'd put it at a solid B. Any card that the opponent had to just kill or loose the game deserves that."
lrcast,3dwdl8,taho_teg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:57:49 2015 UTC,"I have had massive success with Willbreaker, specifically in UG, and I think it's a phenomenal buildaround card. I'm first going to explain what I see in it, and then address some of the criticisms. I was actually planning on writing this post up tonight!  First of all, let's talk quadrants. Willbreaker is not super great when you are ahead - if you've got more creatures than your opponent, or better ones, then who cares. But when you're at parity or behind, Willbreaker is incredible. It routinely steals their best creature, and can occasionally steal two of them. It also steals at instant speed, allowing you to set up some very good combat blowouts for your opponent.    So what does it ask of you? Well, it seems like a lot, but it's not too bad. Run good spells that can target any creature on the board. Here's a non-exhaustive list of spells that I'm more than happy to run alongside Willbender, that can trigger its ability:    Bounding Krasis  Yeva's Forcemage  Send to Sleep  Nivix Barrier  Might of the Masses  Titanic Growth  Wild Instincts (sometimes)  Stratus Walk  Rogue's Passage    These cards are all totally acceptable tempo plays, that can set up some massive turns for you and some horrible ones for your opponent. And most importantly, they're all good cards you'd play anyway. Now obviously some of these plays are just dangerous. You don't want to lose Willbender after you've just Titanic Growth'd your opponent's creature, but here's the other point. You're in blue. Did you draft a Negate? Awesome. Negate stops every single targeted removal spell in Origins except for Gilt-Leaf Winnower. And if your opponent is planning on using that Negate to get tempo back, they are not going to have a super great time when it's countered and you bash with their own dudes.  I want to make sure I'm acknowleding here that Willbender can be an incredibly dangerous card to play, and it's susceptible to a lot of good removal cards in the format - the Winnower, Hunger (obviously), Reave Soul. But it also dodges some pretty good ones as well, like Weight of the Underworld and Swift Reckoning. I think there are two really important things to recognize when you are thinking about drafting Willbender:   1.) It asks very little if you if you're already in UG (or UW seems like it would be good as well). Are you drafting a decent tempo deck? Do you have some Forcemages or a Krasis or a Stratus Walk or two? Cool. You're set. Willbender does not require you to draft bad cards to build around it, and   2.) Your deck helps to protect it. Spending your turn to cast Willbender and then having it die is sad. Once it's set up you are very rarely committing your entire turn to it. Most of the good triggers for Willbender are 2 cmc and 3 cmc spells. If you play intelligently with it, you can avoid a lot of pain. And if you have a Negate or other countermagic, you can really go to town.   Finally, let's address some of the direct criticism of the card:    ""If it dies you lose everything""  Sure, but you don't want to take their whole board. It's not a combo card. It's too vulnerable. Take their best creature. Maybe force a block trade that turn. Saying that Willbender is bad because if it dies you lose everything is like saying that playing creatures is bad because if your opponent Wraths you lose everything. You play around removal with Willbender the same way you play around board wipes - if you overcommit to it you get punished, but if you use it as an extra tempo card you get rewarded.  ""In addition it sort of feels win more to me""  I think exactly the opposite - I don't cast Willbender if I'm ahead. I love to cast it at parity, and will cast it if I'm behind, though it's a little slow. The fact is that Willbender completely warps combat around it if you are representing untapped mana. There are so many good instant cards, or cards with flash, that you can use to trigger it that your opponent often can't risk running anything into combat with it unless they have removal for it.  ""It asks you to do things that are not good on their own""  Not at all. Pretty much every card I listed above is a C or better (except Send to Sleep and Nivix Barrier), so these are already cards you want to be playing. And none of them have to target your opponent's creatures - they are all cards that you are fine casting without Willbender. It's not like you have a hand full of dead stuff. I mean if you want to curve out with 2 drop into Forcemage into Voidmage and just bury your opponent under tempo, you don't even need to draw Willbender. But if you reach parity and you've got a stalled board, Willbender can absolutely shatter them.  ""If you are in a position where you can spend several turns to get the combo going...""  Willbender is a 2 turn, sometimes 3 turn combo. First turn, play Willbender. Second turn, play a combat trick (sometimes during your opponent's turn as well for the 3 turn version), take their best creature, extract value. This also has the (very powerful) advantage of leaving you shields down the turn you cast Willbender, but then having counterspell backup when you're ready to go off.    So what do you need to see to build around Willbender? You need 4-5 good target effects from among Krasis, Stratus Walk, Forcemage, Titanic Growth. If you're really hurting you can play Nivix Barrier, or even Send to Sleep (which can be an okay tempo card if you're racing, but really is not that good in almost all cases). Voidmage Separatist is also a great card to have around. It's a nonbo with Willbender, but it's good for the tempo deck you want, and if you want to go really deep on Willbender it lets you recur creature-based steal triggers. That's about it. If you draft a decent UG tempo deck and you see a Willbender, grab it. It's worked very well for me.   Some last honorable mentions:    Willbender + Nantuko Husk, or other sac effects, is good. Rogue's Passage and other repeatable triggers really shine here.  I've only drafted Willbender three times. Each time I've gone 3-0 with UG tempo. I feel like it's far and away the strongest shell for the card. But I think that UW gets an honorable mention for the very strong combo of T5 Willbender - T6 Sentinel, or drafting Kytheon's Irregulars, or Heavy Infantry, or Anointer of Champions, or Enshrouding Mist, or Grasp of the Hieromancer, or Mighty Leap...you get the picture. There are a lot of playable white cards that cooperate with Willbender, and I could see that deck being very powerful as well."

lrcast,3dwdl8,Airplace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:23:46 2015 UTC,"Read further down - it and Nivix are the two cards that score lower than a C, but Sleep gets an honorable mention for being able to take two creatures."
lrcast,3dwdl8,Gahagan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:36:51 2015 UTC,"Sure, later on you acknowledge that it isn't true.  But why would you have said it in the first place?  Anyway, you completely failed to address the problem with it dying to most removal.  If you cast willbreaker and even a single card to steal their creature, getting the willbreaker killed is a huge blowout.  When you trade 7 mana and 2 cards for a single card worth 1-5 mana, it's not a good thing.  And that's on top of the cost of putting send to sleep in your deck in the first place.  While I agree that willbreaker is probably better than LSV thought, I think the only time it's worth it is if you have lots of otherwise good cards that trigger it (and especially ETB effects).  Also, playing willbreaker because it works well with sentinel or kytheon's irregulars seems like the very definition of win more."
lrcast,3dwdl8,Airplace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:43:06 2015 UTC,"The ""value"" of Willbreaker is that it gets rid of their creature, and gives you a creature. But at the same time, you spend a card to take their creature, and you only get it after you spent 5 mana, a card and a turn playing a 2/3. Is that really better than playing an on-curve 5-drop and using your combat trick or tempo play to get rid of a creature the old-fashioned way?  If I'm in U/G I can't see a situation where I'd want Willbreaker over, say for example, Rhox Maulers.  The turn Rhox Maulers comes down it can block, when I'm attacking it doesn't need any targeting cards to demand an answer, as soon as it can attack it starts eating their board or it gets huge (often both), if I have combat tricks or targeting effects it just gets better, it's harder to kill, and if my opponent has an answer, they never get anything back.  It's hard to say a creature is a good build-around when building around it still doesn't make it as good as a good common."

lrcast,3dvqvo,5DAwakening,7,Sun Jul 19 22:54:19 2015 UTC,"I just top 8'd a PPTQ in the NYC area - while I scrubbed out in the first round of top 8 draft, I can give my general impressions here:  In terms of color power, I think it's something like:  White >>> Green = Black = Red >> Blue  This could be biased by the (admittedly limited) 4 paper drafts I've done with the set and 2 sealed events I've done, but overall this feels correct. Note that as usual the open color combination is probably the correct one to be in, but it seems clear that white is insane and blue feels underpowered.   White has probably the best uncommon in the set with Sentinel of the Eternal Watch. The card is a stone-cold bomb. If you see it second pick it's a signal (that good). I have seen more games won with this card than any other card in sealed. It seems just as bonkers in draft as well. White has two good common/uncommon pieces of removal and some of the best aggressive renown creatures. White wants to prioritize cards that allow tempo plays and seems to pair well with any of the colors (red for burn and subterranean scout, Green for renown synergy and gigantic dudes, black for A+ removal and aura synergy, blue for bounce spells and fliers). White also seems to be deep enough that multiple people can successfully draft it at any given table. I have seen drafts happen with 3-4 GOOD white decks. It's crazy. Your mileage might vary, but this seems to be the consensus in my area.  Surprisingly good card(s): Stalwart Aven and Amprin Tactician. I wasn't TOO high on either of these cards but they do work. You know it's a deep color when a hill giant with decent upside is underrated. Note that this section for each color is more of a ""what surprised me?"" and YOUR surprisingly good cards may be different.  Blue seems to have too many counterspells and not enough dudes. When blue works, it works in a tempo shell with evasive threats, ground blockers, and bounce. The problem is that without all three of those things the deck falls apart. The blue removal spell (claustrophobia) requires double blue (and thus a heavy investment) and the format is fast enough that relying on countermagic is a great way to get run over by aggressive decks in white and red (of which there are plenty). Blue has the awkward situation of wanting to be a support color AND a main color at the same time. While it's far from unplayable, I haven't yet been impressed. Again, your mileage may vary and I'm all ears for hearing how to make the color work better.  Surprisingly good card(s): Anything with flash. Nivix Barrier and Thunderclap Wyvern do work and synergize nicely with counterspells. I think Maritime Guard is also surprisingly decent to get some early board presence. Separatist Voidmage is excellent as well.  Black has the best unconditional removal in the two (!) excellent instant speed 5 mana kill spells. These are the best answers to Sentinel of the Eternal Watch in the format (honorable mention to Wild Instincts in green) and overall are really nice to have. Reave Soul is a contender for top 5 commons in the set, and Eyeblight massacre is worth a mention as a card to be aware of as well. Generally speaking, black's common/uncommon creatures aren't super exciting. It has some of the best evasive/value rares in the set, however, and that paired with removal makes black an excellent support color or main color in a controlling build. I definitely don't get the aggro vibe from black that we've been seeing recently, but it feels like it can successfully complement an aggressive build so long as it is not the primary color. There was a strong, grindy mono black deck that made the finals of the top 8.  Surprisingly good card(s): In black/red, Fleshbag marauder. Wow this is good. Black red can reliably keep the board clear, and that's where this card shines. Otherwise: Infernal Scarring. There isn't a TON of instant speed removal, so it's hard to get burned with this card. Generally it at least draws a card, and it's not hard to get more value out of it from there.  Red has an aggressive suite of creatures (as to be expected) and solid removal. Fiery impulse is one of the best commons in the set and there are some great value creatures like Ghirapur Gearcrafter and Thopter Engineer. The artifact subtheme is interesting but I haven't seen it come together very often. The big issue for red is the lack of ways to do well in the midgame. There isn't really a trumpet blast analogue in this set and instead the most powerful red creatures need to hit once (to get renown) before they truly get scary. The deck wants to be fast, and needs early disruption to do well. Red's color pair mantras include ""don't let them get to the midgame"" with white, ""kill their plays"" with black, ""curve out and stomp"" with green, and ""tempo/synergy"" with blue. In red/white and red/blue, cards like act of treason and enthralling victor get WAY better. Overall I've always been happy to play red, but it feels awful when red decks stumble.  Surprisingly good card(s): I've been relatively happy with Prickleboar. Few cards block it well, which is exactly the sort of card red wants. I'm not sure it's equivalent to rhox mauler, but it seems better than I've seen people give it credit for.   Green easily has the best midrange game (again to be expected). Most of the green creatures at common/uncommon are playable, and some (rhox mauler, the 6/6 reach vigilance spider, the 2/3 deathtouch renown guy, and the 1/4 spider dude) are excellent. Green is lacking in removal, but Wild Instincts is nice and most green decks will be paired with a color that provides decent removal. I have not yet seen a good green/blue deck, but I have seen decks for all the other color combinations do well. As a note, the deck that beat me in the top 8 draft was a mono-green ramp deck with multiple zendikar's roil, nissa's expedition, and fatties to ramp into. Keep an eye out for the pieces because that deck seemed insane.   Surprisingly good card(s): Hitchclaw Recluse. It. blocks. everything. It blocks everything! (okay, not everything). But still. Most decks I'd be happy with 2 or 3. Also Joraga Invocation is the nuts.  My nomination for best P1P1 is Hangarback Walker. The card is nuts at any stage of the game and fits into literally any deck in the format. Take this card.  I might continue this post later, but I really need to sleep. Please let me know if you want to get more specific opinions."
lrcast,3dvqvo,ScaldingHotSoup,2,Mon Jul 20 05:56:09 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the T8.  I agree with Blue being lackluster. It's great as a secondary colour or maybe primary if you open some crazy Rares. The flyers are nice but come out a bit slow. Perhaps my inexperience with the format was also a factor as, in retrospect, I was underrating Maritime Guard.  I like Fleshbag Marauder but every time I drew it, it was feel-bads time (opponents had Visionaries, Thopters, etc.). It's obviously not a bad card since they are just two examples, but I couldn't help but laugh each time."
lrcast,3dvqvo,d00n,2,Mon Jul 20 14:37:53 2015 UTC,"Marauder is best when you're an aggro deck, because they trade off their chump blockers early to cut down on the damage they're taking, then you can slam it down and force them to sac a big threat."
lrcast,3dvqvo,Greyfeld,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:21:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't find Blue to be underpowered. It's not absurd, but if it's the last colour it's a close last and not a colour you'd deliberately avoid in drafts.  Usual caveat about low sample sizes applies - I've drafted this format exactly once - but I was in blue/black, I went 2-1, and I lost to someone in blue/white. So it definitely felt like blue was deep enough to support a couple of drafters. I think people are overlooking blue cards either because they're worse versions of cards that were already quite good (Calculated Dismissal, Clash of Wills), because of the history of Blue's cards (Screeching Skaab and Disperse being better in this format than they were previously), and because a lot of Blue's power is coming in at uncommon."

lrcast,3dvqvo,nanaki5282,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:44:23 2015 UTC,"The blue removal spell (claustrophobia) requires double blue (and thus a heavy investment) and the format is fast enough that relying on countermagic is a great way to get run over by aggressive decks in white and red (of which there are plenty).   Just something I'd like to note, I played against a UG deck on Saturday with my very solid RW aggro deck (tons of great first strikers, Throwing Knife, [[Call of the Full Moon]] for early aggro, a fistful of removal to get through blockers, my only real problem was only having 4 2-drops), and he thoroughly trounced me.  In one game, I didn't get my 2-drops in hand, so I got my first creature out on turn 3.  He dropped three voidmages in a row, stalling out my board, then Claustrophobia'd me right before dropping a [[Skysnare Spider]], which I couldn't deal with or attack around.  The second game, he threw down [[Clash of Wills]] against my turn 2, [[Calculated Dismissal]] against my turn three, then Claustrophobia'd the last creature I had in my hand before curving straight into Skysnare Spider again.  Admittedly, his deck was pretty stacked because the only other blue drafter at our table was a kid who didn't know what he was doing.  But that combination of bounce and counterspells completely stonewalled my early aggro plan on both games.  It was ridiculous."

lrcast,3dvqvo,ScaldingHotSoup,4,Mon Jul 20 23:25:02 2015 UTC,"People are saying renown is kicking butt, and all I'm doing is picking removal and Separatist Voidmage. Seems to be doing well for me so far (except against Pia and Kiran Nalaar. God, I hope someone burns them alive.)  It's important to have a plan to close games. It's pretty easy to lock up the ground if you give your opponent enough time, and even things like stalwart aven stall the air game. Joraga Invocation, War Horn, Chief of the Foundry, Thunderclap Wyvern, etc. stuff that can give you an edge in combat should be in your deck."
lrcast,3dvqvo,bearrosaurus,3,Mon Jul 20 01:21:44 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a lower curve set, imo.  Getting something out on T2 is crucial depending on your T3 strategy.  Getting a good Renown through on T3 can really set you up for a win.      Removal vs Bounce There isn't a ton of removal and most of it isn't cheap, even the burn, coming in at 3-5cmc depending on the effect.  Meanwhile there are a bunch of stray bounce, tap, or ""unblockable"" effects that are either direct spells or ETB effects.  These effects are pretty strong in a format of limited removal options.  So is it the best way, probably so as many of these effects are on creatures so you get the effect and then a body that stays in play.  My example here is the common Heavy Assault.  he's a solid 3/4 body that taps a creature when he comes into play allowing you the potential to get through with your T3/T4 drop for some damage/renown/etc and then leaving a hard to deal with body behind.  Many creatures in this set are weak on both power and toughness with a lot being 2/x or x/2 (especially pre-renown) so look try to draft around that.  For instance, they aren't high pics by any mean but I've seen cards like Yoked Ox and Guardians of Meletis really gum up the ground as 0/4 and 0/6 are really tough to get past (remember, removal is expensive and somewhat rare and what burn there is rarely does 4-6 dmg). 2/4 is a solid creature, for example, I was not a fan of Returned Centaur the last time around but this time he's much harder to deal with and there are a few graveyard synergies he'll work with (there is a BU mill deck using Centaurs and Sphinx's Tutelage that is effective in Limited)  Anything that gets you multiple creatures is good and there are quite a few in this set, mostly around thopters.  Being able to 1for1 your opponent and still have a body in play is going to be great because there isn't a lot of card advantage/draw in this set (I LOVE Sword of the Animist)"
lrcast,3dvqvo,AndrewWaldron,3,Sun Jul 19 23:29:49 2015 UTC,"This is based on a few pre-releases and a draft, so it's only very early comments and might well be wrong. Still... a few answers.  What are the best color combos?  I do think White is probably the most powerful colour. It pairs neatly with red for Boros Aggro, or Green for a slightly more midrange deck with powerful creatures all through the curve.   Blue Red Thopters is definitely a thing if you can get the cards. Green Black Elves / Value is also very strong, as is White Black Enchantments.   Those are the standouts, but I'm pretty happy that it's a well balanced set and I doubt any colour combination is unplayable, or extremely overpowered.  How fast is the format?  It's quick. Renown means that you need early drops to block, and things can get out of hand fast. I've not seen too many board stalls, even when playing sealed.  That said it's not Zendikar-quick. It is possible to play control and try to slow things down, and to do well in that. There's some big fat payoffs for getting to the lategame, and cards to get you there.  How highly do I need to take removal?  Highly, like always! It's actually very sparse in this format it feels, so pick it highly and relish what you can get. It's almost all good.  Is bounce really the best way of dealing with creatures as LSV seemed to be thinking?  The best? Absolutely not, and I don't think LSV was saying it is! It's useful, though; it resets renown creatures so that when they come back down, they can't attack. It gets people playing enchantments or combat tricks, both of which exist in this set."

At my prerelease, with 53 players, W/B split with R/G for 1st. R/G took 3rd and 4th.  The format seems to be fast - 2 drops were very important in sealed matches, so draft is going to be just as fast, if not faster.  There seem to be a few power uncommons, like [[Elite Scaleguard]] in FRF. [[Sentinel of the Eternal Watch]] is a house. [[Joraga Invocation]] ends games, either the turn it is cast or immediately after.  Watch out for sacrifice outlets from B/R decks - the Act of Treason deck may very well have the pieces it needs to be great.  You always need to take removal highly.  Bounce can be useful, but I'd still take [[Claustrophobia]] over [[Disperse]]."

lrcast,3dv9gy,daveclarkeart,-3,Sun Jul 19 21:28:33 2015 UTC,"Ghost just some quick basics that really helped me are as follows:  A) Save instants as long as possible, especially kill spells until you can craft a possible two for one and the best way to do that is...  B) Pretty much never attack unless they are tapped out and you've considered all multi-blocks. I've learned that attacking is rarely the right idea unless you are clearly the beat down and they are clearly control. If you are control, mid-range or not the beat down, play conservative and let them attack you into a two for one.  C) Another great way of getting two for ones is attacking them with creatures that will die to a double block WHEN THEY ARE TAPPED OUT. I can't emphasize that enough, unless they are sitting on one mana and you can't think of any instant that can be cast there don't attack because YOU will end up getting two for oned or at best two for two'd losing a super creature and removal which is nearly getting two for one'd yourself.  D) Memorize ALL the instants (include flash effects obvs) in the format and ask yourself, why would my opponent do X? Usually if you think for a bit you can realize oh they have R W and 2 of any color and they attacked into my board? They have warflare or whatever. You can usually figure it out. You don't need to really consider mythics or rares UNLESS you've seen them and then you can know they probably have it. Trying to figure out if they are bluffing isn't worth it, if you figure out a card that matches their open mana, assume they have it and avoid the blowout.  Those are just some pretty straightforward tips that helped me a lot. Of course I can't seem to crack 3 match wins recently, but I did run hot for a couple of weeks and got 9 pro-tour points once cycle ago I'm basically stuck near 1700 rating for what that's worth, I've gotten as high as 1776 and as low as 1666. Good luck! Play online if you are able to and just crank out games. Listen to the going infinite online show (just search for lrcast going infinite) and follow brian's tips on cutting down your costs and you can do WAYYYY more drafts online than at your local card store."
lrcast,3dv9gy,chord_O_Calls,9,Sun Jul 19 23:02:44 2015 UTC,The hell? Attacking is great in limited. If you trade a creature for a combat trick that's often just fine. It's a card for a card. I love it when my opponents are scared to attack and I have stone nothing.
lrcast,3dv9gy,kccmtg,6,Mon Jul 20 00:04:37 2015 UTC,"I also disagree with the 'never attack unless they are tapped out' and the 'never attack into open mana comments'.  If they do use a trick to kill your guy thats still a 1-for-1 trade. Theyre going to use them eventually, attacking early can be a way to draw out those tricks so your bomb creatures dont have to deal with them."
lrcast,3dv9gy,DeftMunky,4,Mon Jul 20 02:13:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't emphasize the ""NEVER"" attack into open mana thing. Yes there is always the potential for getting blown out but sometimes you have to go for it.   I also sort of disagree with the whole never attack unless they are tapped out. Unless your deck is very controlling you have to be able to at least put some initial pressure on your opponent or else eventually they'll be at 20 while you're at 8 and can never attack. If you are trading damage (assuming neither of you is clearly the beatdown) they take on huge risk by alpha striking as you can just kill them on the back swing if you have anything to disrupt them"
lrcast,3dv9gy,DeftMunky,2,Sun Jul 19 23:42:43 2015 UTC,"As others have said, you need more reps. Keep playing as much as possible. Download MTGO, do a draft, and save your deck and play it against other people when the draft is over as a freeform deck.  Also, remember that the ratings aren't everything. Sounds like your opponent had a synergistic deck where the cards worked well together. Any time you're playing Origins against B/R, look out when your opponent has a sacrifice outlet online (Nantuko Husk) because Act of Treason or Enthralling Victor may be stealing your stuff soon.  Also, watch videos on CFB or Twitch. Listening to very good Magic players describe their thought process while drafting and playing teaches you a lot."

Not really feeling MTGO over the last year or so. It doesn't run well on my PC, and I'm having more fun playing other online games. I've also found it disappointing that while MTGO has started distancing itself from paper Magic, they haven't used the opportunity to alter pay/play structures. The economy is a mess, and it feels very antiquated that you have to manage your collection to play limited. Also, where are leagues? In Hearthstone, I just have to log on and play well. No 3 hour time commitments, no selling singles, no monitoring pack prices like a hawk just to eek out a meager profit.  While I still prefer the actual game that Magic provides, everything else is just so outdated with how online gaming works these days.

For what it's worth, I just mentioned ""thoughts on format"" because that's what the slot normally is, but I think an alternative subject would fit as well. Yes, it's early and people want to hear about the new thing, but normally we're just getting some ([understandably] incomplete impressions from Marshall and a coverage guest).

Video is pretty straightforward to record on HS due to being able to capture the window/program vs having to screen region crap in mtgo.

I don't want to lose on the spot to the guy who plays an early drop renowned creature just because I couldn't block and offer the trade. Plus there's a good amount of first strike in this set. It's very possible you can screw yourself that way. Dragon Fodder also has better synergy with Fiery Conclusion.   I would much rather have the blue pile than the black pile. Whirler Rogue is insanely powerful and the Voidmages constantly overperform. Yes, Nantuko Husk is powerful, but I think being able to have evasion is a little more important, especially because you have good equipment to go with it."

Neither are awesome but the two drops ended up being not as important as i'd thought they might be.  Agree on whirler, totally nuts. and the voidmages worked well with the thopter generators as well.  act/sac is still insane when someone is trying to win off a bomb and the blue didn't have all that much to combat that other than bone to ash.  both decks worked well, probably should have started the blue though."

I would really be tempted to play a bit good stuff on the draw and
lrcast,3ds51z,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:55:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe neither. I'd need to see the rest of the pool, but I'm not sure including Mage-Ring Bully is correct, and you certainly don't want the two Act of Treason.

Firefiend Elemental subbed in for bully, eyeblight assassin and chandra's fury got put in vs other token strategies.

lrcast,3ds51z,gimmepizzaslow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:20:39 2015 UTC,"Did you only open five packs or something?  Mage-Ring Responder is an absolute bomb. That would go in my sealed deck regardless of what colours I was running. It's especially backbreaking when coupled with Sword of the Animist, because you can play it ahead of curve.  If those seven green cards are all you have, I think we can immediately dismiss green as an option.  White-red would give you the best removal package with Suppression Bonds, Celestial Flare, Fiery Impulse and 2x Lightning Javelin. But if that's really all of your white cards, you only have two white creatures.... which is problematic.  If this is the whole pool, I'd go with the UR option, but add in Mage-Ring Responder and Firefiend Elemental, and take out Mage-Ring Bully and Fiery Conclusion."
lrcast,3ds51z,keattsd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:48:47 2015 UTC,"yeah the white/green was pretty shallow.  there were a couple of cards not shown, white six drop 3/3 flier was the only other white creature.  after playing it all out I might take out one of the javelin.  deals with far less in this format then I'd like and the sorcery speed is pretty restrictive at 4 mana."

Having a counterspell is nicer than it is in draft because your opponent is virtually guaranteed to have bombs.  Your red/black does ""combo"" quite nicely, but neither Nantuko Husk nor Act of Treason are impressive on their own, and Touch of Moonglove is not good."
lrcast,3ds51z,chimpfunkz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"This is a tough split. I'd lean towards starting black, which is less powerful overall, but quicker. That said, I'd probably spend most games swapping to blue on game 2 (especially if you were on the draw)."
lrcast,3dsrha,CelestialBeekeeper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:36:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is a deck I think would be fun to draft. Did Blightcaster also make an appearance?  Seems like in the right deck he is a value engine."

The problem with Blightcaster this time around is Origins lacks fast, effective enchantments the way Theros did.  Theros had a lot of 1cmc/2cmc Enchantments (from Auras to Creatures to normal Enchantments, there were 8 options 2cmc or less in BW) that powered Blightcaster super hard.  Origins is really lacking in those areas this time around.  You can still pull it off in Standard just not so well in Limit.  But I so badly want it to be a thing! Edit: Oops, I meant M14 for Blightcaster.  M14+Theros, back when they were both Standard."

lrcast,3dsrha,HayZues1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:41:49 2015 UTC,"My prerelease pool was W/B, running 4 enchantments.

The color combo seemed pretty strong, though - unconditional removal with Suppression Bonds and Unholy Hunger, couple with efficient guys and renown did good work."
lrcast,3dsv87,wmcduff,7,Sun Jul 19 03:17:40 2015 UTC,"Spread out the colors. If you take a very strong card of one color, then you avoid that color after that. Especially safe if it requires multiple of that color to cast. Avoid reasonable colorless cards that go into any deck.   It can also be fun to try and draft as few win conditions as possible."
lrcast,3dsv87,brian_lr,5,Sun Jul 19 14:48:03 2015 UTC,The problem is that the creatures are on color.  Plus the lizard isn't terrible when you have 8 plus mana in backdraft.
lrcast,3dsv87,corran__horn,4,Sun Jul 19 05:47:56 2015 UTC,"I still don't get the point of backdrafting. To me it's the limited equivalent of playing Scrambleverse in Commander--something that sounds like a fun kooky idea, but is miserable to actually play out."
lrcast,3dsv87,CelestialBeekeeper,2,Sun Jul 19 04:26:02 2015 UTC,"Eh, there's a limit to how bad you can make things. There's still bombs, removal, and solid cards that have to be drafted. The deck maker can still make a good deck...it's just about at the level of a bad sealed pool, but everyone's at about the same level."
lrcast,3dsv87,zorkmead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:56:41 2015 UTC,I've found it to be another useful tool for thinking about the set. The change of perspective is instructive.

lrcast,3dsv87,bertolotti,2,Sun Jul 19 21:48:44 2015 UTC,"hey i've done a few backdrafts in cocka too, i found them quite hilarious. Note that passing a winning pool shouldn't be something that makes you proud since you're still playing the rounds to win yourself.   I'd agree that the key would be to spread out as much and as evenly as possible amongst the 5 colors, but most importantly picking up the minimum amount of bodies. I got passed a pool with 4 or 5, mostly 1/1s, and the chance to build something remotely competitive with that is just abysmal.  edit: also, since the basic archetype is 5 color whatever, pick your cards as mana-intensive as possible (having two or three colored mana symbols in a card is generally preferred).  edit 2: as u might've noticed, origins really is a balanced and quite powerful set, making it harder to backdraft. a thread in r/magicTCG pointed that the worst limited card in the set was demolish, which really isn't that shabby. Throw some older sets in the mix next time (grab bag backdraft maybe?) and you'll see what a pile of true durdle looks like."

lrcast,3dset7,OmgObamaCare,2,Sun Jul 19 18:05:33 2015 UTC,"To be honest with you, I started feeling the same somewhere in the middle of DTK.  I remember 0-3ing a draft when I lost to Atarka, flood/screw, and hexproof Silumgar in that order.  I was also quite discouraged, as this seemed to be a trend for me.  The two things that I have learned since then, are that variance happens (and it sucks), and that I needed to focus more.  Variance is obvious:  sometimes you are going to lose to Atarka no matter what you do.  That sucks. The focus part was more tricky for me.  Ultimately, I watched myself closely over the next few weeks of drafting, and I caught myself playing on autopilot.  I wasn't making focused choices in the draft portion, and I would make poor mulligan and in-game decisions without even realizing it.  The way I have tried to deal with it is to slow down, and try to think through alternatives before making a decision.  I found that if I stopped myself from playing on autopilot, I could take a step back and really asses the situation to make a better decision.  I also sat down and really intently watched some ChannelFireball videos, looking for decision making processes, and what the pro was thinking about when he made a choice, rather than looking at the cards he picked and the plays he made. All this applies to me; I don't know if it can help you.  I really hope it can though, because I totally understand the spot that you're in, and it frustrated me to no end.

lrcast,3dqi95,ScaldingHotSoup,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:48:59 2015 UTC,"Not that amazing. But consider the scenario where you do 1 damage, cast a red spell and do another one damage.   2 damage might not seem much but it lets you attack 2/2 into a 3/3 or 4/4 as well as complicating combat math with any mana open.   Yes she is definitely better in mainly red but if u get her you would maybe draft accordingly as red instants become much better.   If you can somehow flip her she is great but even in fireslinger mode she can be a shock or 2 during a game and that's decent card advantage.   Late game not as good because your hand will probably be empty but in many circumstances she can help with pushing through that extra damage against renown creatures."
lrcast,3dqi95,fremeer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:55:34 2015 UTC,Unfortunately you can't ping creatures - only players.
lrcast,3dqi95,Carribi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:13:32 2015 UTC,Aww Man talk about reading a card and being completely wrong about it. Yeah it's pretty average. But unblockable 1 damage a turn isn't the worst clock ever. Just not very good
lrcast,3dqi95,fremeer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:22:04 2015 UTC,"She is a 2/2 for 3 that presents a threat that has to be answered. That in itself makes it a B. The ratings are based on individual cards not compared to other cards.   If you play Chandra right she will deal 2-5 damage easily. At the very worst she will eat a removal spell so your bigger threats go unanswered. At the very best, swing with her, Titan Strength so she kills a creature/deals 5 to Opponent, tap to deal 1, then flip to deal 2, dealing 7 turn 4 with just a Titan's Strength for help."
lrcast,3dqi95,zazathebassist,2,Sat Jul 18 14:48:20 2015 UTC,"She is a 2/2 for 3 that presents a threat that has to be answered.   She does? All you need to do is have something capable of blocking her. Otherwise opponent needs to cast 2 red spells to get this to flip, and that's happening, what turn 8? Turn 9?  I'm with OP here - this card seems mediocre. The best case scenario if pretty good, but I don't see it being very good on average. I definitely think Lilianna is much better, just based on her creature stats and the fact that she gets to turn your next chump blocker into an actual creature."
lrcast,3dqi95,cferejohn,2,Sat Jul 18 15:52:30 2015 UTC,She's good in an aggro shell where your main goal is as much damage as possible. She gets in a few extra points that otherwise wouldn't go through. She won't singlehandedly win games but she definitely deserves both an early pick and a slot in any Aggressive red deck.
lrcast,3dqi95,zazathebassist,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:58:02 2015 UTC,I don't see how she ends up doing more damage than the 4 mana 3/2 haste reknown guy on average.
lrcast,3dqi95,cferejohn,0,Sat Jul 18 16:28:41 2015 UTC,"All the Chandra player needs is a trick. This is a setup cost, but the good cases don't sound too improbable:   She attacks. You block with a 2/2. ""Aha!"" you think, ""Gotcha!"" Chandra player plays Titan's Strength. She's a Planeswalker. She attacks. You block with a 3/2. ""Aha!"" you think, ""Gotcha!"" Fiery Impulse kills your blocker, she taps, she's a planeswalker.   Chandra's bad if you don't have spells in your hand. Chandra's bad if your opponent has multiple large blockers, or can cast removal. But in a good red deck, it's easy to imagine ways to have her survive many probable board states and come back a planeswalker. When she doesn't, your opponent generally has to spend resources that they'd probably rather spend differently. If your opponent spends a card killing her, that's a card they didn't spend killing something else, and it's hard to find a 3-drop that is such a tempting place to point one's limited deck resources."
lrcast,3dqi95,Slypenslyde,3,Sat Jul 18 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"That second scenario doesn't work. Since the blocker is dead, and Chandra does not have trample, she assigns no damage."
lrcast,3dqi95,Sceptilesolar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:08:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  you would need to attack and shoot their blocker before blocking."
lrcast,3dqi95,nottomf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:19:09 2015 UTC,You're talking about a scenario where you drop her on turn 3 (and therefore the blockers she has to face are both few and small). If you pull her on turn 7 there are very few limited board states she's getting through.  I might be way off here - I just don't see how she's better than Liliana though.
lrcast,3dqi95,cferejohn,3,Sat Jul 18 19:26:46 2015 UTC,"Well, she's actually not a threat that has to be answered. Like I said, she's usually just been an overcosted Goblin Fireslinger. Titan's Strength does pair well with her, but that's assuming she goes unblocked. As a 2/2, she's a snap-block with almost any board.   Have you played with the card?"
lrcast,3dqi95,Ak_keith,7,Sat Jul 18 15:22:16 2015 UTC,"If you used titans strength  and they blocked,wouldn't that be enough to flip? It? Chandra says ""if Chandra has dealt 3 or more damage this turn..."" Doesn't say it has to be to a player."

I also would have gone this way: +stratus walk +charging griffin -yoked ox -nivix or the artifiact wall. Maybe side the walls or ox in against aggro."
lrcast,3dr1c1,iPadreDoom,3,Sat Jul 18 17:22:58 2015 UTC,"the reason i didn't play the valor in BW was because i was so top heavy already, and didn't need the valor to win, so wanted the auramancer as a 3 drop that could also get back 2x weight of the underworld and occasionally a suspensionfield.   stratus walk and charging griffin are alot better when you are on the offensive, and considering my top end power, i figured i was better off trying to survive instead of being proactive. charging griffin is very mediocre if you aren't beating down, and stratus walk isn't amazing unless they are mainly attacking with fliers.  i think aggro was the weakness hence playing the yoked ox and guardians. I don't think they are good cards, and would have instantly played any 2/2's for 2 over them, i just couldn't get hold of them in the draft."

In other games though, if I had any real board presence, the sentinel was just a powerhouse, I'd just tap their biggest thing and  eat them.

I had 2-3 (depending on sideboard) Unholy Hungers and a Cruel Revival.  It all depends on the type of removal you're playing against.

lrcast,3dpvq2,cagedknight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:17:35 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts: What if your pack has Archangel of Tithes in it as well? Which do you P1P1? If you're having to pick between those two cards in a pack, you're sending a strong signal to your left no matter which card you choose. Either way you're probably going to send the guy to your left in to white to begin with. It'll be worse if any more strong/heavy white packs come your way in the next 5-6 packs. You really risk being cut off of white from the left in the second pack in that situation.  That said, the Sentinel is more splashable. With the Archangel you're basically screwed if you do get cut off from white. So I don't know. P1P1 in a pack with Sentinel + Archangel, maybe you pick Sentinel just to hedge your bets, but I'd really start looking for a second color early on."

lrcast,3dpoea,LouTheMeXiKaN,5,Sat Jul 18 06:10:50 2015 UTC,"It definitely seems like a fast format. It's still possible to draft a control deck (Ie, it's not a Zendikar-style Aggro Hell where there is at best one controlling deck in the format), but durdling is hard. I would probably prioritise Reave Soul over the other black removal in this format, for instance.  The fact that a lot of the best creatures, even at three mana, start at 1 or 2 power and grow later makes cards like Screeching Skaab or Maritime Guard somewhat better than they would be.  Eyeblight Massacre, however, seems very much like a sideboard card unless you have the deck where everything is an elf or 4+ toughness. I had it in my maindeck last night and it wasn't even good against the more aggressive decks. The fact that a lot of the top commons in two of the colours are elves really pushes it down in value, plust the unusual number of 3+ toughness creatures around.  Creatures in this format tend to cluster around 3/2-ish, which means a 3/4 is king of a lot of battlefields.  Jhessian Thief is absurd on the play. It just punishes stumbles extremely hard, and if you can follow it up with a Claustrophobia, it gets very good. Even if they have two blockers out, they very probably have to let you draw a card or just chump. However, in the creature-heavy decks without a lot of ways of interacting across the board, it gets a lot worse.  Blue and Black have access to a ton of value. Deadbridge Shaman, Aspiring Aeronaut, Whirler Rogue, Tower Geist, Separatist Voidmage, Eyeblight Assassin, Undead Servant (if you have 4+ of them), culminating with Possessed Skaab. Green has some amount of value cards as well, and even red does too. Overall, this format feels more heavy on value cards than usual, so the rewards for slowing down the game a little and playing a controlling deck are there. But you can easily end up without having time to make use of all that value if you don't have enough cheap interaction. Separatist Voidmage is still very good (all this time of playing Man-o'-War in cubes has dulled our sense of how good that card is in real limited), and it's particularly absurd if you're hitting with Jhessian Rogue or recurring him to cast again.  Shadows of the Past is a real card, but you need to be playing a controlling deck."
lrcast,3dpoea,BonSequitur,2,Sat Jul 18 09:51:22 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen (obviously not much yet, 5 pre-releases last weekend, 2 drafts yesterday, and one sealed PPTQ today) all of the archetypes are viable.  I 3-0'ed one draft with straight UB control, and 1-2'ed with a decent monored with Chandra's ignition splash Lili and Languish, and of course I watched as many matches as I could from both pods in each draft, and all day at the pptq and pre-releases.  The sample size is small, but I've seen (and played) elves, RW aggro, RG monsters, straight control, thopters, WG renown, WB enchantments, plus more, and all can do really well.  I think the plan is the same, read the table and draft your seat, there is no ""one best deck or archetype"".  One thing I've noted is white was extremely over-represented in the sealed pptq, especially at the top tables, and it's very over-drafted right now.  Twice I've picked 2-3 great white cards early in pack one and needed to abandon it quickly.  Thopters reminds me of exploit last set, it's hard to get all the pieces because everyone's in the market for the best cards, the only one you don't fight over is a pack three spy network.  I've been keeping an eye on the gold cards that come around a bit late as a signal for what's really open, since they're all really good at what they do.  One thing I'm noting is mana issues, over and over it's ""one more X and I would've cast my hand to stabilize and win the game"".  Evolving Wilds are like gold, and some of the best spells have double mana costs, I was a bit greedy in my worst performance (1-2 draft) and it showed.  I think this isn't even really straight two color, it's more main color and splash, or at least my best decks have only had double symbols in one color not both.  I'm writing this down now in part to look back in a few weeks to see how wrong I am so far. :)"

In my 3-4, I was green splash red, and played inferior cards from green in order to make the deck less susceptible to mana."
lrcast,3dpoea,Greyfeld,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:43:11 2015 UTC,"I ran up against 4 decks that ran blue as one of their colors.  UW, UW, UWB, UR.  Fliers are as strong as ever, and if you don't have some way to deal with them, you're going to get your face beat in.  Also, ALWAYS have something in your sideboard to deal with thopters.  Running into a single UR thopter deck can ruin your night if you don't have some way to efficiently remove them from the board.  These decks go wide, rather than tall, so have some way to deal with that.  Course, they also don't start getting off the ground until turns 3-4, so if your deck is faster than theirs', you might not need to bother with removal, as they have to hold back and chump block to stay alive.  Black's 5 mana removal spells are decent, but don't bog your deck down with them.  I had 3 in my deck tonight, and I never felt like I had enough quality targets for them all.  [[Read the Bones]] is awesome.  [[Dark Dabbling]] was better than I thought it would be.  Since it replaces itself, it never felt like I was losing much if I had to play it just to regenerate one creature.  I think you play it a lot of the times you'd play Butcher's Glee from the last set.  Just make sure to side it out against any deck that you don't expect to do a lot of trading against, otherwise it just rots in your hand.  Edit: Jhessian Thief disappointed me a bit.  Sure I got a few cards off of her, but unless I was ahead on the board, she was pretty much a dead card.  Sitting on the board as a 1/3 and not being able to attack in because she'll die for free is just painful.  If you have a way to make her unblockable, that's a different story, but as just a regular 3-drop, she doesn't really do much unless you're already ahead on the board."

lrcast,3dpuwo,dannysims,3,Sat Jul 18 07:43:31 2015 UTC,"From my early impressions with drafting the set, I feel like you draft origins differently than some other sets. In packs where there is one of the few expensive but good removal like Unholy Hunger or Suppression Bonds, a lot of times it seems better to take a high quality creature. In most sets I would take the removal over it, and here there's a lot of trading that functions as the removal. It's still early obviously and a lot of people are experimenting."
lrcast,3dpuwo,escplan9,2,Sat Jul 18 07:56:03 2015 UTC,"I think it is probably more context than anything else. It's one thing to eyeball a card and say it's worth its mana cost, but where does it fit in the format? What cards improve or weaken it? What decks really want it? These answers come with a bit more experience."
lrcast,3dpuwo,davekayaus,2,Sat Jul 18 09:17:11 2015 UTC,"Draft formats always take a while to ""figure out,"" and even evaluating cards from a base level takes practice.  I remember when Khans came out last year there was a lot of disagreement on how you should build your limited decks for a while.  Being good at limited doesn't mean always winning right off the bat. Occasionally it will, and when you build the perfect winning deck on your first draft you'll feel super smart. But at this point in the format it's less important to know how to build your deck, and more important to pay attention to what works and what doesn't in your games. At that point you'll have actual results, which is always better than speculation.  There's a reason the pros playtest heavily before each pro tour. Even if you're a great Magic player with lots of experience, you need to actually play a format to thoroughly understand it.  The set was just released yesterday. Play, have fun, and pay attention to your losses, but don't worry if you're not consistently going 3-0 right off the bat."
lrcast,3dpuwo,CelestialBeekeeper,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:53:22 2015 UTC,"Pre-release is always a high variance situation. lots of people playing with the new cards, trying things out.  I think the biggest thing that makes it feel as though you are starting over is that you don't know what to expect. Evaluating cards well relies at least partly on knowing what your opponent is going to play and seeing what is good against that plan, but at this early stage in the format players haven't really settled into familiar archetypes yet."
lrcast,3dpuwo,InvisibleMusic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:40:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think we are far enough into the new set yet to be able to tell what the winning strategies are. Some claim it's a aggressive environment, some claim removal is bad. My personal experience is that it's a very grindy environment as long as you can stall the first 2-3 turns against renown creatures (Scryfish and Ox?). Until a ""meta"" develops and you find consistent strategies to draft, you can't expect to get consistent results."

lrcast,3dpuwo,Xelnastoss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:20 2015 UTC,"I think you'll eventually get better at initial drafting. The first month of drafting is usually the easiest for mcuat least in paper), where I feel like I can't possibly lose. Focus on fundamentals like reading signals and having a good curve, and don't fall for traps. Don't bother with overly synergistic decks until the format is more clear."

I insert every pick into its respective spot in the pile, and look through it frequently. In the first pack, when colours are still getting sorted out, I'll sometimes sort first by colour, then by cmc. It sounds finicky, but there's plenty of time, and I'm usually one of the faster people to pick in the drafts I play in, so I guess I'm used to it.   This helps a lot in mentally organizing picks and remembering them in drafts where you can't look. At competitive or higher REL (you don't get to look at your picks except between packs) sorting in this way has helped me memorize my picks-- I imagine 'this card goes between these two cards in my imaginary stack', and then between packs I'll actually organize this way, reinforcing in my mind my previous picks."

Which means no risk of passing the wrong pile, since I just don't handle it at all when drafting.  It's hard to juggle everything going on in a draft in your head, and it's an acquired skill for sure, but I find it helpful from pack 2 onward to focus more on needs than on what is already in my pile. So I take inventory of what I'm lacking - early plays, finishers, removal, curve fillers, and so on - when I go over my first and second pack picks.  Learning to sort cards fast in your hand is also a helpful skill to have."

This is a deck that can draw two lands that come into play tapped over the course of a game and be fine.  Guardians of Meletis may have been correct, but I don't think trading a three drop for the sixth four drop would have been in the maindeck. If anything, the 23rd card is just Eyeblight Massacre, which performed far below expectations for me."
lrcast,3dp7eo,cferejohn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:37:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true - you don't want another 4 drop. Actually the Maritime Guards might not actually be bad here seeing as they survive it.  How good was having 4 Undead Servants? Were you getting one out with some tokens every game or was it still occasional? Also how was Shadows of the Past? I was pretty impressed with it in my prerelease pool."
lrcast,3dp7eo,cferejohn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:39:57 2015 UTC,"Probably would not be impressed with 3 Undead Servants in the deck,  but 4 was actually pretty brutal, and it may have been correct to play Macabre Waltz just to get extra value out of them. The first Undead Servant matches up decently against the format's ground creatures, the second is significantly above curve (As a 3/2 with a 2/2 attached), and the third is just ridiculous (As about half a Grave Titan).  Shadows of the Past was impressive, too. I didn't get to use it much as a finisher, but in the 18-land UB deck, it just led to games where I drew many more real cards than my opponent.  It definitely requires a grindy control deck, though; if you plan on a shorter game, it won't be over replacement level in value.  UB seems like a strong archetype - you just have access to so many value creatures (In fact, you want to do your best to play nothing but value creatures at least from the three drop slot onward). Possessed Skaab is only a notch above a Gravedigger if you're getting back a medium removal spell or a normal creature, but it's stupid if you're getting back a Tower Geist, a Deadbridge Shaman, or your third Undead Servant. The dream, of course, is to get back a Possessed Skaab with another Possessed Skaab."

The level at which Brian plays magic is something that I could theoretically aspire to (although realistically I'll never get there).  The way that Efro and LSV play magic though - I can never, ever do that.  It's like listening to a podcast about how to improve your local league basketball performance hosted by Michael Jordan.

I really only visit here during new releases ever since LSV took over.   In a vacuum, LR is a great show and LSV is a great host for what the show is, but coming from the Brian era I fell like the switching of hosts was a downgrade.  I didn't like LSV's reviews before the switch either, it's not like this show was what made me dislike him. That's seems to be the case with some, they dislike him because they think he's supposed to be a perfect replacement for Brian. I personally just don't like his philosophy and attitude he uses in his shows/articles, and I think Brian is more fun.

It's likely that both things are happening.  Don't get me wrong; I still miss the last two co-hosts (and I think Brian was the best thing about the show while he was on it -- our views just line up so well and I'm really sad that he needed the time back; but I really respect him for figuring that out and doing it), but I really think that Luis is becoming a very capable and excellent co-host for the show.

In fact, I think it shows a lot of caring that you can say things like that and have everybody just think it's hilarious.  On LSV being more of an ""unreachable pro"": I really never saw LR as a home for anything other than people who want to get better at Magic, and I personally will never really be able to understand people who put some sort of ""I'm casual"" barrier between themselves and improving.

lrcast,3dlc9t,benikens,2,Sat Jul 18 20:35:10 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I just wanted to add my thoughts since LSV joined. Nothing is inteded to say one of the host is better or worse or a bad person (NOT AT ALL).   TL;DR: In the beginning I thought i was not the target group of LSV and Channel Fireball. Now I enjoy listening to LSV's side of things much more. Trolling is only fun when countertrolled.   I was new to LRCast when there were different guests every show.   When LSV became regular co-host - I didn't like it/him for several reasons. I somewhat felt like LRCast was this littly community of ""serious casuals"", meaning, yes we play but don't have tons of time to dedicate to the game.   LSV is a pro and from Channel Fireball. He is undoubtedly a very good Magic-Player but probably not the person a small community of serious casuals can refer to. He literally plays in another league.   Also it is mainly limited resources - a format that has a small amount of cards and mechanics compared to Modern or Legacy. So referring to cards from a Set from 2002 or something doesn't help me much to understand things.   Sometimes I also got the feeling that LSV insisted on his point why a card is B+ or something for ""pro reasons"". I can't describe that in antoher way. YES, i wish I understood why this is B+-Card but my skill is just not sufficient. It almost felt that intentionally or not he kept necessary information to understand the power of the card.   Marshall on the other side is this calm and without meaning to be disrispectful - more on limited focused player. When he says ""in limited...."" then this advise is important to me.   The Trolling/Punning parts: Yes, I do like them a lot - when I get them and it makes me like LSV so much more, especially his stories where things went wrong or he misjudged situations or cards. WHY? Well exactly because it shows that he is not this untouchable pro-player who shares some breadcrums with the peasants ... (well that sounded far more dramatic than it should have).   Trolling is more fun though, when it comes naturally from both sides. And Marshall had SUCH a great opportunity this time with the ""Dork-Bear"" but he just said - Straight F, which I totally agree. Again - this is why i listen to the podcast - to get information - but the trolling part IS FUN and more enjoyable especially when listening for 5+ hours.   Keep up the great work.   I WISH that it stays the way it is right now. Marshall and LSV offer two different views and don't agree on everything."
lrcast,3dlc9t,MasterOfTheWay,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:35:50 2015 UTC,"I like LSV. Not as much as Brian Wong, but I don't have any rational reasons why. Wong was my first co-host, and it's doubtful anyone's going to surpass him for nostalgia reasons.  The jokes at Marshall's expense are, in my opinion, the best part of LSV's humor. It lends an element to the show I like, and I feel like Wong and Marshall did similar things often. I don't like the extent of hyperbolic sarcasm LSV uses, particularly in set reviews. By this I mean answering Marshall's ""What do you give it?"" with ""Oh, this is an A+, you want 6 in your deck!"", waiting for chuckles, then ""No, yeah, it's an F."" or vice versa. It's   I understand why he does it, if I sat down to do a 5-hour podcast I'd be desperate for some entertainment too. But I much prefer jokes on the order of calling Ojutai's Summons ""two tickets to the flying blue monk show"" to ""This card does EVERYTHING"" in reference to a 1/1 for 1. (I always say the joke when I play Ojutai's Summons. I'm sure my FNM buddies are tired of it. I don't care.)  I don't know how to make that constructive, I think if LSV tried to be all-serious I'd find him too professional. LRCast isn't really supposed to be a ""no joke zone"" but I do lean on it for advice. When a significant portion of the discussion of a card includes hyperbolic opposite-opinion jokes, I have to listen a lot harder to get useful information out of the review. I think I'd enjoy it better if for obvious F cards, the discussion would be ""This card is bad, it's an F, don't play it, next."""

lrcast,3dn5z8,gregariousbarbarian,2,Fri Jul 17 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"Scab-Clan Berserker would be my 5th pick out of this pick. I really like Swift Reckoning, it's one of the top removal spells in the set, and removal is pretty light in this set.  If that was gone, I would be on Whirler Rouge. 3 bodies is just value, and taking it early in the draft means I can try to find some other artifact payoff cards.  Then I take the angel. Obviously a great card, I can see the value in taking it over the rouge. And my 4th pick is the flying deathtoucher. That dude is strong, shuts down all thopters, trades with anything, and blocks anything.  I think Scab is a mark below all those cards. If you top-deck him, you're sad. If you play him on the draw, you're sad. He's not a bad card if you're already in red, but I view him more as a filler card than someone I want to take early."
lrcast,3dn5z8,pjkenk2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:10:02 2015 UTC,I basically agree with your pick order here. [[Fetid Imp]] is one of the best early defensive creatures for a more controlling type deck.

lrcast,3dn5z8,MTGCardFetcher,2,Fri Jul 17 19:13:23 2015 UTC,"I'm on Whirler Rogue out of this pack right now.  Swift Reckoning is removal and is cheap removal but I think on the scale between Assassinate and Doom Blade it's only around a 6. Your opponent needs to be attacking you and unless you have Spell Mastery (not incredibly easy to achieve in a 6-8 spell deck), you're going to have to take a hit. Obviously the upside is there and the card can be incredible but there are alot of situations where this is just going to be assassinate. I am obviously still open to updating my opinion but after one prerelease that's how I felt.  Haven't played with the rogue but haven't heard anything to contradict my original opinion of it which is basically that it's pretty much just insane.   Comparing it to anywhere from solid to amazing limited cards really helps illustrate how powerful the card is.  Shaman of the Spring was a 2/2 that draws a card (a solid playable in any green deck). Whirler Rogue is a 2/2 that has an extremely relevant ability and the card that you draw is 0 mana put 2 1/1s into play completely blowing the card away.  Talrand's Invocation gives you 2 2/2 fliers. That card was great with the same mana cost. Instead of the keyword flying on one of our 2/2s (2 1/1 fliers basically equal 1 2/2 flyer) we get the ability to make any creature unblockable. How much more upside is unclear but it would be tough to argue for Invocation (though it is important to note that Archeomancer was one of the reasons why Invocation was so good. 4 2/2s is way better than 2...).  Lingering Souls, one of the best cards in its format or even most formats, is one more mana and requires a second color to get 4 1/1s. Whirler Rogue is a mana less but you downgrade two 1/1 fliers into a 2/2 with an ability. Between the ability to still push damage through when the air is stalled and that artifacts matter, it's pretty unclear which card is better.  So overall I think Whirler Rogue is just one of the most rawly powerful cards in the set while Swift Reckoning is a solid, sometimes clunky removal spell. I'm slamming the powerful card.  4/4 Flyer is good too. Don't think it has the upside of Whirler. The Berserker and Imp are fine cards but I can't imagine either being even close to the top 3."
lrcast,3dn5z8,IzDaisho,2,Fri Jul 17 18:05:37 2015 UTC,"Drafting on Cockatrice/Drafts.in, so sorry for the cropped commons (Thornbow Archer, Fetid Imp, Infernal Scarring, Dark Dabbling, Negate). I think the choice is pretty clearly between the uncommons and Scab-Clan Berserker.   I ended up choosing Swift Reckoning because of its low cost, splashability, and its likelihood of aligning with any gameplan my final deck may have. Whirler, Patron, and Scab are good but the double mana symbols in each means I would have to commit to that color pretty early in the draft and I don't think any of them are such stone cold bombs that it's really worth it."
lrcast,3dn5z8,quixotic_unicorn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:05:12 2015 UTC,I agree.  Swift Reckoning is arguably the best removal spell in the set and once Spell Mastery is online the blowouts are real.  Whirler Rogue is wonderful but pulls you into a blue a little more than I would like.  Scab-Clan is just meh as a P1P1 with three solid uncommons and Fetid Imp next to it.

lrcast,3dn5z8,Greyfeld,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:42:21 2015 UTC,"I think I'm on the Berserker right now, but that's because I'm more interested in exploring the format than anything else.  I think building a heavy red Aggro deck would be fairly easy and pretty powerful, and the Berserker is very good in that deck. Day two at GP Dallas?  I'm probably on Swift Reckoning or the Angel.  I think white is the best color in the format, and both of those cards are going to be great in an aggressive or a controlling white deck.  I think Angel edges just ahead as white has two common removal spells that I am comfortable playing, and an Air Elemental that sometimes grows my Renown guys is just a beating."
lrcast,3dn5z8,escplan9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:17:47 2015 UTC,"It's between Whirler Rogue and Swift Reckoning, but I think you take Reckoning because of the dearth of quality removal in the set.  The angel is fantastic, but it's basically a 4/4 flyer for 5 (the upside doesn't happen as often as you'd think), which is good, but the other two cards just bring so much more to the table, quality-wise."
lrcast,3dn5z8,johnts03,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:15:08 2015 UTC,"Swift reckoning for me. One of the top removals in the set at only 2 mana, with relatively easy to activate Spell Mastery to make it even better. And it's easily splashable if white doesn't become the main color. I would pick Whirler then Patron over Berserker as well. Berserker is much better in constructed than limited where it's usually just a good filler card."
lrcast,3dn5z8,Sceptilesolar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:37:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think any of the commons are first-pick material, and Scab-Clan Berserker is one of the weaker playable rares. Whirler Rogue is very strong since you get 4/4 of p/t for 4 mana with a very useful ability that you can activate right away. In the end, I think I'd go with Swift Reckoning since the single colored symbol makes it less committal this early, and it's one of the better removal spells in the set (especially for it's cost)."
lrcast,3dn5z8,TheJediCounsel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:10:03 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning Whirler Rogue. It is committing to blue more than Swift Reckoning is, but I also consider it a fair bit better. Swift Reckoning is very good for sure, but I wonder if it's a little overrated."

I think I would probably take the Rogue.  As much as I like premium removal like Swift Reckoning, Whirler Rogue is just nuts and can win games on its own."
lrcast,3dkr40,Nisoh_,14,Fri Jul 17 01:46:01 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is my first attempt at creating spike-oriented/technical content (so if you have feedback, please include it), and I hope it isn't too hard to follow.  I got interested in print runs due to discussion about them in Dragons of Tarkir, and I was surprised to find some patterns standing out in Magic Origins. The patterns are summed up in these slides in case you can't watch the video:  http://imgur.com/a/3tphD  And creating a complete print run would require a lot more boosters and more time, but it would be useful to nail down exactly where Fiery Impulse ends up. With a couple more weeks it should be doable, but until then, good luck on Magic Origins drafting."
lrcast,3dkr40,MrMarlon,4,Fri Jul 17 02:02:27 2015 UTC,I don't get it. What does this all mean?
lrcast,3dkr40,Adjace-esque,5,Fri Jul 17 10:49:43 2015 UTC,"WotC wants 10 commons in each booster but   the commons all have to be different each color must be represented not too many removal spells   So Wotc developed this system for putting commons into booster packs:  Your booster gets 4 commons from Card Hopper A. The series of cards in this hopper are Black-Red-White-Black-Red-White-Black... and these cards will end up in the front of your booster.  Then the booster goes to get 2 (sometimes 4) cards from Card Hopper B, which contains a series of Blue-Green-Blue-Green commons. Between the commons from A and B, we know a card of each color is in the pack.  For the last 4 (or 2) commons in the back, the booster gets them from Card Hopper C2. Removal spells only appear in C2 (and its sister C1), and removal spells are never adjacent to each other in C2. Thus, you can only have a maximum of 2 removal spells at common in your pack*.  The series of cards in Card Hopper A (and the other hoppers) is a sequence of ~60 commons that repeats itself. This sequence is called Common Print Run A. As an example from the bits and pieces I've scrapped together, I can tell you Chandra's Fury is always preceded by Dark Dabbling or Eyeblight Assassin. So if I see fury without a black card, I know Eyeblight was taken.  The entire system is a bit more complicated. Sometimes a pack takes 2-3 cards from Card Hopper A, in which case it gets cards from C1 instead of C2 (which, like the other runs, are completely separate. Commons in C1 do not appear in C2). Also, things get messy if a foil is in the pack.  I hope that explanation helps. Obviously, this is really technical stuff that no mtg player needs to know, I just like talking about it.  * Except for Celestial Flare, which apparently isn't counted as removal and appears in Run A."
lrcast,3dkr40,joosh82,4,Fri Jul 17 23:17:33 2015 UTC,"I liked it. You went into more depth than most people who analyze print runs. Usually they just view it as a puzzle and once they determine the runs they feel like they're ""done."" As you said, it's not worth the mental effort to memorize print runs so the value is in analyzing them for strategic suggestions. Great job, I enjoyed it!"
lrcast,3dkr40,inatube,9,Fri Jul 17 13:53:09 2015 UTC,Of two things I am certain:  I won't remember any of this during a draft  I will play against people who have this stuff memorized and treat it as gospel

lrcast,3dkr40,Monosound,2,Fri Jul 17 04:21:29 2015 UTC,"This is cool and interesting but I'm failing to see how this has any practical application beyond increasing the authenticity of draft sims (from what I've seen most are pretty horrendous as far as closely mirroring an actual Magic pack).   Here's my take-home from this: there is no way I will be able to memorize the print runs or even begin to use this to make a guess about what was taken out of my pack, so I might as well shuffle the cards in my pack to make it more difficult for someone else to extract that tiny bit of information from the pack. I guess if they knew this info well enough they could just reconstruct the pack, but at that point why not just put that extra effort into something else that's more likely to gain you value in the draft?"
lrcast,3dkr40,sh58,2,Fri Jul 17 15:06:33 2015 UTC,"I think as you get more drafts in you will be able to track little patterns. I think most of us do this already (maybe not consciously). For instance, you can see a Guardians of Meletis and a Claustrophobia, and then start looking for Leaf Gilder or Fiery Impulse. If neither are there you can assume someone down the line has them and if red and green have felt like they are being cut you can move in on blue. Its not much, but all this data helps.  As you do more drafts these little things will start to add up and just become muscle memory."
lrcast,3dkjlw,atty70,5,Fri Jul 17 00:39:15 2015 UTC,"Well, you were weak in removal, but you passed over a Whisk for a Write into Being, and a Reach of Shadows (and Orc Sureshot) for a Sultai Emissary.  You also passed up the opportunity for 2 pieces of mana fixing that would have let you splash for the red removal you picked up in pack 1 (BR/UR dual lands).  You also took a Lotus Path Djinn over a Noxious Dragon.  Most of your picks in the first two packs were fine (I'd have taken the Sarkhan's Rage over Reduce in Stature p2p4, with an eye toward splashing red, because I think Reduce is just a horrible piece of removal, and I think Youthful Scholar over Ojutai's Summons is the wrong pick, but those are really my only complaints), but you're just all over the place in pack 3, and I've no idea what was going through your head.  Edit: I almost forgot to mention your bizarre pick of Aven Surveyor over Sage-Eye Avengers in P3P1.  Surveyor is a decent card, but it doesn't hold a candle to Avengers, and it's only 1 less mana for far less power on the board."
lrcast,3dkjlw,Greyfeld,2,Fri Jul 17 03:18:06 2015 UTC,"I came here to say the same thing. The picks in the first two packs looked mostly good, then in pack three is when it goes off the rails."
lrcast,3dkjlw,rigatti,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:34:53 2015 UTC,Also didn't have much to say until I saw the Sage-Eye Avengers getting passed. Card is nuts. Definitely some questionable picks in pack 3 - Write into Being over Whisk Away (or Sibsig Muckdraggers) and Sultai Emissary over Reach of Shadows (or Orc Sureshot) being the ones that stand out.
lrcast,3dkjlw,kccmtg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:56:30 2015 UTC,The card evaluations in this Pack 3...  Fate Reforged was known for its busted rares.  Sage-eye  Avengers is one of them.  Bounce a thing every turn is a lot better than bounce a thing on ETB.  There's a lot of times that there is literally no way for an opponent to come back from an attacking sage-eye.
lrcast,3dkjlw,sylverfyre,3,Fri Jul 17 14:17:21 2015 UTC,"Also, I think Soulflayer over Mistfire Adept is questionable. Soulflayer ends up being a worse Angler most of the time, and you still would have had chances to pick up an Angler if it came around."
lrcast,3dkjlw,rigatti,2,Fri Jul 17 03:40:26 2015 UTC,"I think a 2-mana 4/4 is good enough, even if you don't get any other additional abilities with it.  Plus, he has enough flying creatures that he probably delves it with flying at the very least."

Aven - Yep Tail Slash - Yep Silly Sorcerer - Seems like this is where you took the signal to go into blue.  Good read. Interceptor - This card has gone down in my evaluation, but it's still the best card in the pack. Palace Familiar  Gurmag Drowner - daaaang blue is open.   Okay, makes sense how you ended up in blue after P1P1 Roar, but where's the black signal?  We only got a single Vulturous Aven P1P2 and a Mind Rot?   P2P1 - Scholar over Summons - I'm fine with this, though some others have expressed concern here.  We're definitely an exploit deck, and he can do work without being exploited too. P2P2 - Defeat over a really terrible pack - Not a good removal spell, but there really isn't anything here. P2P3 - Interceptor over Attendant - Unsure about this, but it's probably fine. P2P4 - Reduce over Drowner - There is an Ire Shaman and Sarkhan's Rage here.  Are you sure we should be in Blue Black?  Black hasnt given us any good cards since P1P2.  I'm wondering if blue-red ""exploit anyway"" might have been the option.  We already have 2 good red removal spells.  At this point I'm kinda ""stopping the tape"" - why are avoiding red so hard?   Later in pack 2 we see Atarka Efreet, Dragon Fodder (which makes the exploit cards still work pretty effectively), Rending Volley (B level sideboard card when you bring it in)  Pack 3 we see even a 14th pick cunning strike if we want it.  I'm not convinced you wanted to be in black.  No premium black removal showed up at any point except for the Reach of Shadows.  We had a Pick 3 red removal spell and saw a second pack pick 4 red bomb + top red common followed by pick 5 high quality red common.    It may seem odd to switch colors at P2P4, but at this point we have only 3 black cards vs 2 red cards:  Black (playable - I'm not counting the 13th pick Virulent Plague) cards at p2P4   Vulturous Aven Mind Rot Defeat (Basically the only ""important"" cards this kills is Ukud Cobra and facedown Atarka Efreet.)   Red cards at P2P4:    Draconic Roar Tail Slash   When we are passed a 4th pick with both Ire Shaman and Sarkhan's rage.  Blue Red is a weird color combo, but it was by far the most open.  And our exploit dudes would still work since we have stuff like Palace Familiar, Youthful Scholar, and access to Dragon Fodder and Jeskai Sages."
lrcast,3dkjlw,sylverfyre,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:31:50 2015 UTC,"I actually thought the two Butcher's Glees were a sign that maybe only one or two people were drafting black.  But then, I really like that card, it's always performed really well for me.  I think it's one of the best combat tricks in the set.  But yeah, I think it's crazy that he didn't even consider splashing for red, at the very least.  Reduce is a horrible removal spell, and even if you don't end up running Sarkhan's Rage, you're not missing much by skipping over a Reduce.  Plus, there is a royal crapton of potential fixing in any given Fate pack."
lrcast,3dkjlw,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:00:06 2015 UTC,"The second glee had not shown up at what I consider the ""decision point"" - it was Pack 2 pick 5.  If we aren't taking a red card at P2P4, we're not going into red.  It's the decision point because it's where we're seeing two B tier cards way later than expected.  The first glee was p1P5.  That isn't crazy late for a combat trick in a very deep color.  It's important to realize that while Glee is a decent combat trick, it's still just a combat trick.  Combat tricks are not premium removal, and seeing one still in the pack at pick5 is not something I'd ever call a signal.  I'm surprised it's always performed really well for you, any instant speed removal hits you with a 2-for-1 and leaves you in a bind because you're often relying on the lifegain.  Secondly, I wouldn't consider ""exactly one fixing card in every pack no more no less"" a royal crapton of fixing.  Only 3 out of 10 lands address your problem, and you don't even tend to see 10 lands before they're all picked away (I guess UR land is probably more likely to go around the table further, though.)"
lrcast,3dkjlw,sylverfyre,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:40:28 2015 UTC,"You can get hung up on the semantics of my choice of words, or you can just agree with me that Fate has far more chances of having fixing for the colors he'd want than the DTK packs."
lrcast,3dkjlw,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:43:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not getting hung up on your semantics.  my point is I'd be timid about relying getting on fixing in FRF because there is no guarantee you'll even see a relevant land, let alone see the land at a time that you aren't busy taking an important card."
lrcast,3dkjlw,sylverfyre,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:59:28 2015 UTC,"Normally I'd agree, but Reduce in Stature just isn't strong enough for me to care about picking it up over a potentially playable splash.  Hell, I'd run 2 mountains and splash Sarkhan's Rage by itself over running a Reduce."
lrcast,3dkjlw,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:10:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree there.  But we've even got more good red cards than good black cards and once we take a red card P2P4 theres no way you're convincing me that Butcher's Glee wins out over Atarka Efreet.  Atarka Efreet is sweet!"
lrcast,3dkjlw,sylverfyre,0,Fri Jul 17 16:42:49 2015 UTC,"Atarka Efreet is good, but if you have enough 3-drops already (much less enough morph cards), you can't just snap-pick it."
lrcast,3dkjlw,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:45:55 2015 UTC,"It's not just a 3 drop, it's Atarka Efreet.  It's one of the best common creatures in the format."
lrcast,3dkjlw,sylverfyre,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"Putting aside the fact that that's highly debatable, taking another 3-drop when you've already got a glut of them, over a piece of removal when you have almost no removal, is universally a bad pick.  Atarka is a great card, but I'm not going to take it over one of the best combat tricks in the set when I have almost zero removal and four 3-drops, all of which are also morphs."
lrcast,3dkjlw,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:47:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I think you are right as I had in my mind that black blue was the stronger archetype but red probably was more open and I remember on one pick I even thought of going red blue

lrcast,3dixz2,mrcjtm,9,Thu Jul 16 17:22:09 2015 UTC,After playing with/against this card I'm a little higher on it than Marshall and Luis. On average I think this is better than a straight wrath: you keep your best creature/they keep their worst creature is very good. I have this in the A range.
lrcast,3dixz2,procumbo,2,Thu Jul 16 19:36:38 2015 UTC,"It was very much an A for me at the prerelease.   Twice it saved me from a mull, once down to 4 on the draw. My opponent confidently barfed out his hand. I hit my land drops, played a castellan, next turn tragix arrogance and swing left him with a tapped thopter and me with a 4/5 vigilance, and 10 life. He never got close after that.  I would not have 4-0'd my prerelease without this card.  Of course, I didn't really play any real control decks either."
lrcast,3dixz2,dougtulane,6,Thu Jul 16 22:47:38 2015 UTC,This card was bonkers in our two-headed giant prerelease event this weekend. I want to point out one more situation. If you control an Aura that is enchanating one of their creatures (i.e. Claustrophobia) you can choose your aura and their creature that it's attached to. All of their other creatures will die effectively leaving them with nothing.
lrcast,3dixz2,timothydog76,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:44:14 2015 UTC,Oh man I hadn't even realized that part.
lrcast,3dixz2,sylverfyre,2,Fri Jul 17 03:40:35 2015 UTC,Often in white too you may have a creature under a removal enchantment.  This can make it wrath plus because you will have removed all of their creatures.  I found that there was no where near the amount of set up cost that they seemed to think the card had.  Usually if it was bad for you you were already winning so that is good.
lrcast,3dixz2,rob_bot13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:05:54 2015 UTC,"Well unlike normal wraths, this doesn't do anything if your opponent only has one creature -- sure, that's not super common, but there are times you just need to wrath to kill one troublesome creature. It happened to me a couple times and felt a little awkward.  Still, just nit-picking, I think the card is great."
lrcast,3dixz2,rob_bot13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:11:00 2015 UTC,"I think it is easy to engineer that not being the case, however I agree that it is definitely not just a wrath of god.

lrcast,3dlbu1,5DAwakening,7,Fri Jul 17 05:00:47 2015 UTC,"I mean, mulling to 4 isn't often the right play. But if your hand of 5 is 5 spells, you should be going to 4 in a heartbeat.  One thing I started doing awhile back is, every time I draw my hand, I draw that many cards minus two, just to see what a 5 card hand would look like. I ask myself, 'would I keep this hand on a mull to 5?' Then I draw the 6th and ask the same question, and then the 7th and if I still haven't decided to keep I decide then.  I originally started doing this just as a personal 'keep-or-mull' exercise; to identify what's missing out of a hand, what my last card would have to be in order to tip the choice from a mull to a keep, that sort of thing. What I ended up realizing after doing this for awhile is that there were a fairly large number of 5 card hands and especially 6 card hands where I said, yeah, I'd be perfectly fine keeping this on the mull to 5 or 6. It really helped me see that, yeah there's a chance of getting screwed on the mulligan and getting no lands/6 lands, but the chances of getting a perfectly playable 5 or 6 were way higher than I thought they'd be."
lrcast,3dlbu1,rakkamar,5,Fri Jul 17 06:35:40 2015 UTC,"The mulligan rules will NOT take effect unless wotc decides to change the rules for good. It is only being tested at the pro tour, and I haven't seen anything that changes that yet."
lrcast,3dlbu1,5-s,2,Fri Jul 17 13:32:42 2015 UTC,My groups has been using it when we draft. I've gotta say I hope they keep it - you just feel a lot better mulling crappy 7s and at least a little better mulling crappy 6s. I don't think there's any doubt it's better for limited - I expect the concern is that it will have a larger effect on constructed formats (and I can certainly understand not wanting to have 2 different mulligan rules for different formats).
lrcast,3dlbu1,cferejohn,2,Fri Jul 17 19:12:29 2015 UTC,"As far as mulligans, if I'm having trouble with a decision, I take the card that's currently worst in my hand (the 8 drop or the off-color card for the lands in my hand) and see whether I'd keep that hand. I usually feel like if I have a solid X taking out the worst card, I can't expect a random X to be better than that."
lrcast,3dlbu1,hascow,2,Fri Jul 17 16:45:14 2015 UTC,"That's a great way to look at it. I've heard people say when they draw a hand with one useless card, they get a ""free mulligan"", because they're already down a card. But they forget that it works both ways: if your hand minus the one useless card is already keepable, you're probably better off keeping your ""pre-mulliganed"" hand. It's a keepable 6 (or 5, or whatever you're down to), plus you get to ""draw"" that useless card for free any time it becomes useful during the game."
lrcast,3dlbu1,peeja,2,Sun Jul 19 15:27:11 2015 UTC,"When I hit a losing streak, the best thing I find is to stop jumping on to queues and try to figure out if there's something I'm missing. Sometimes it's just variance, but you know when you're drafting great decks and they're just not getting there, or when you're consistently drafting mediocre decks.  This has happened to me on the last 2 draft formats, (DTK and Cube. I gave MM2 a miss.) where I was totally crap at the start of the format, something like winning 1 in 8, bleeding tix out of my account, and then something clicked, and I just couldn't stop winning, improving my win rate to something like every other draft, or close to that.  In DTK it was realizing the importance of metagaming and how easy it is to fall into what I call ""the red trap"". Red was just so easy to fall into, and it isn't good when more than half the pod is fighting over it.  In cube it was realizing the importance of early interaction, plus sticking to your guns. Early interaction is almost broken sometimes in cube, because all the artifact mana is making people's mana to business ratio in their decks and opening hands really wonky. People keep hands that just accelerate into an amazing threat, and if you take their threat with a thoughtseize or counter it with spell pierce suddenly their entire plan crumbles.  Sticking to your guns is important because you're eventually gonna get powerful cards, the whole cube is powerful cards. However the print runs are weird because it's cube, I don't even know if there are print runs. It's not like regular sets where if you don't see cards of a certain colour in, say, 2 packs in a row, you're probably getting cut off. If your first 2 picks are insane reasons to stay in a colour in cube, you're probably better off sticking to it if you can. I'm still willing to pivot, but I have one eye towards going back to my original colour, or picking up fixing so I can go 3/4 colours.  Anyway, the point is, if you find your decks mediocre, it's good to take stock and try to find out what you're doing wrong. Watch other people draft the set, talk to people, get their opinions. You're probably missing something.  I find that in most formats I do well in, I have strong convictions of what to do/draft, something where I think I know a secret/key to the format that other people don't do/follow, and I test this to see if it's correct, backed up by lots of results. Personally, I draft a lot (I drafted DTK about 270 times), that's a lot in terms of sample size, to see what works and what doesn't."
lrcast,3dlbu1,pahamack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:05:57 2015 UTC,Do you have any other tips regarding DTK and also KTK FRF drafts? I could use some help with both of these. I've given up on Theros drafts because I realize I don't like that format as much as KTK FRF.
lrcast,3djpoh,sh58,9,Thu Jul 16 20:42:07 2015 UTC,"I like Fiery Impulse here, but it does seem like a close pick.  Impulse has a number of things going for it, though:   Single colored mana requirement Efficient removal is harder to pick up than efficient creatures Low mana cost; helps with curve considerations Prevents blowouts from early renown creatures"
lrcast,3djpoh,bitterrootmtg,6,Thu Jul 16 21:05:51 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning Spider, but I could definitely see Fiery Impulse being better."

Skysnare Spider is the other possible pick here, but I'm still leery of letting prime removal pass me by, especially on the p1p1.

lrcast,3djpoh,Greyfeld,4,Thu Jul 16 22:14:00 2015 UTC,"I'm probably taking fiery impulse, as it is one of the few ways to survive a quick renown start.

lrcast,3djpoh,Suedars,2,Fri Jul 17 04:14:57 2015 UTC,"I think we're looking at Impulse over Spider. War Oracle is strong, but Spider or Impulse are both better when you're behind, providing you have the mana to cast the spider. I don't think we know enough about the format to just auto pick white cards yet (and that's a probably a bad strategy regardless of what we know about the format), so the argument that War Oracle is better because of the color probably doesn't mean much."
lrcast,3djpoh,kccmtg,2,Fri Jul 17 13:01:19 2015 UTC,"I love War Oracle but its nowhere near the power of Spider or Impulse, I'd take the Spider here, wouldnt really hesitate."
lrcast,3djpoh,BishopBarkley,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:35:47 2015 UTC,Is the rare that bad?  Seems spot on for a aggro deck
lrcast,3djpoh,jediwizard22,5,Fri Jul 17 03:36:20 2015 UTC,"But committing to aggro with heavy black P1P1 can be limiting.  If Black isn't open, you can pigeon hole yourself into a mediocre aggro deck.  You'd need a deck that wants a lot of swamps and is attacking early and often for the Despoiler of Souls to be good.  The key to a successful draft is reading the signals of what you're getting passed and building the best deck for your seat.  The spider and impulse are both enough stronger than the rare as well as leaving you open to a number of different decks that they're better first picks than the Despoiler.  Now, if this is pack 3 and you're already heavy black, then it might be despoiler time."
lrcast,3djvu6,Adjace-esque,4,Thu Jul 16 21:27:51 2015 UTC,"As someone who runs the stats on individual card win% based on MTGO replays (see mtggoldfish) I find the official WotC proclamations regarding statistics very very strange. They often do not in any way align with ""conventional wisdom"", and while this is absolutely not preclusive in regards to ""truthfulness"" (in many cases statistical concepts are very poorly understood experientially) it is a red flag to me that perhaps a particular metric is not correlating well to colloquial usage (example: average turns played vs format ""speed"").  If you ever watched the PT coverage when they do the ""stats"" you'll know what im talking about. The raw data has all sorts of anomalies related to the conditional playability of cards, so i would suggest that without a statistical definition of what ""the most frequently found Red uncommon from Fate Reforged among ""winning"" Atarka decks"" is it has little value.  Just like im clear to point out on goldfish; a cards win% when played is not equivalent to the cards objective strength. It is exactly what it is. Without clear definition and publicly available source data, statistics are largely meaningless."
lrcast,3djvu6,mtgratingtester,2,Fri Jul 17 13:21:57 2015 UTC,"I think the moral of the story is that you need to think critically about statistics. If you place a statistic in its proper context is can give you useful information, but you can't just look at a number and say ""this card is better than that card."" Magic is more complex than that."
lrcast,3djvu6,bitterrootmtg,2,Fri Jul 17 15:11:10 2015 UTC,We are in the infancy of Magic statistics. Just like batting average held sway for decades before being supplanted (or a least relegated) we are yet to define the metrics that truly reflect performance in Magic and not just broadly approximate it.
lrcast,3djvu6,mtgratingtester,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:33:13 2015 UTC,"On the card win% point:  this really cannot be overstated.  Magmatic Chasm has an absurdly high card win%, as has been cited on the cast multiple times.  That doesn't make it an amazing card; that just means it either wins you the game, or never gets cast."
lrcast,3djvu6,Carribi,2,Fri Jul 17 16:56:29 2015 UTC,That is because that data is obtained by scraping replays and thus only sees cards cast. Data from wotc themself should have no such limitation and be able to see everything.
lrcast,3djvu6,jadoth,8,Sat Jul 18 01:34:21 2015 UTC,"Yeti is more ""frequently found"" (i.e. more copies are played) among winning Atarka decks than Pyrotechnics. That doesn't mean Yeti is better than Pyro, it means that every red deck wants Pyro whereas only RG or RU decks want Yeti. So Yetis will be concentrated among those color pairs and Pyro will be spread out across all decks that play red mana. The same reasoning answers your question about Abzan Kin-Guard and Temur Sabertooth. Hungering Yeti is way better than a D+. A vanilla 4/4 for 5 mana is in the C to C+ range already. Flash basically gives it ""destroy target attacking creature"" since you can flash it in as a surprise blocker. A 4/4 for 5 that generates card advantage is excellent. Yeti is at least a B (when paired with green or blue). But Pyrotechnics is certainly better; it's in the A range."
lrcast,3djvu6,bitterrootmtg,2,Thu Jul 16 21:50:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I think OP is high. Temur was never the strongest archetype but yeti certainly shines. There and is playable even just as a vanilla 4/4. The manifest + 2 counters card is comparably vanilla and I played it often. Both have upsides but only one destroys attackers sometimes.
lrcast,3djvu6,steve032,3,Thu Jul 16 23:04:00 2015 UTC,"It's... fine.  It's not great, and it's nowhere near pyrotechnics.  But it will probably make your deck and do its job, and unlike Pyrotechnics, it will still be in the pack 7th pick."

lrcast,3djvu6,czarandy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:09:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe the winning RG decks are taking the cheaper cards in DTK and hoping to pick up curve-topping Yetis in the last pack? (This is pure speculation, but it's plausible.)"
lrcast,3djvu6,bitterrootmtg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:28:07 2015 UTC,A vanilla 4/4 for 5 mana is in the C to C+ range already   What? No it's not. C- is as high as I would even consider. If you have a 5 mana card it better do more than that.
lrcast,3djvu6,beepbloopbloop,2,Thu Jul 16 23:54:53 2015 UTC,"I don't care to nitpick about the exact grades. The grades matter less than the discussion about the card. The point is that Yetis is a highly playable card in the RG deck, which explains why winning RG decks often play it."
lrcast,3djvu6,bitterrootmtg,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:36:03 2015 UTC,"My problem with your explanation is that the phrase ""winning"" is meaningless in context. If the finding is that Hungering Yeti is found more often in Red-Green decks than other Red-X decks because it has synergy in that pair, that is likely true of both winning and losing Red-Green decks. Adding the phrase winning implies a value judgment.   If Hungering Yeti is a B, then why have I never seen it cast in DDF? B's don't sit in sideboards, and I'm sure no one's hate drafting it.   Even if the statistic is that 90% of the played Hungering Yetis are found in Atarka decks, I still think Pyrotechnics are more frequently found in Atarka decks than Hungering Yetis. They're just also found in other Red decks.   The wording of the factoid makes no sense. It's a useless statistic AND phrased as meaningful...double whammy."
lrcast,3djvu6,MooMooMan69,3,Fri Jul 17 01:55:28 2015 UTC,"Hes saying everyone takes pyrotechnics.  Hell sometimes ill take a pyro over nothing exciting, even if im not red and have some fixing.  So out of 10 winning r/g decks  maybe one has a pyro.  But maybe 4 of them have yetis, cause no one else wants them.  If these were actual #s  then yeti would apprar higher then pyro on the list.  But not cause its better."
lrcast,3djvu6,bitterrootmtg,2,Fri Jul 17 12:55:13 2015 UTC,"Unless WotC is lying (which I highly doubt), then it is a factually true statement that Hungering Yeti is the most frequently found Red uncommon from Fate Reforged among winning RG decks. It may or may not also be true that Hungering Yeti is the most frequently found Red uncommon from Fate Reforged among losing RG decks. Those two statements could both be true; there's nothing contradictory or misleading about that.  There is no subjective ""value judgement"" going on here. WotC took all the winning RG decks and then counted up how many copies of each uncommon were played, and Hungering Yeti had the highest number. The ""value judgement"" comes from the reader trying to interpret more from the statistic than is actually being said. Wizards never said Hungering Yetis is the best uncommon in RG or that playing it will make your deck more likely to win. They simply reported raw data, and it's the job of the reader to think critically about that data.   I also stand by my statement that Hungering Yeti is better than a D+, and probably in the B range in an RG deck. In the FRF set review the hosts gave Yeti a C+. That rating was based on FRF/KTK limited; in a straight RG deck where it reliably has flash it's going to be a little better. Also, on the most recent show, the hosts made a point of comparing Hixus, Prison Warden to Hungering Yeti and remarked that Yeti was a solid card in FRF limited. Hixus is clearly a little better than Yeti, but it got a very high grade: A-."
lrcast,3djvu6,sylverfyre,2,Fri Jul 17 15:04:12 2015 UTC,"Well let's see.  The hungering yeti is more likely to go around the table until it hits the RG player, because UR is a very unpopular color combo.  Therefore, it's more likely to be in their pile of draft cards.  It's a... decent card.  It's not amazing, but you'd probably always play it in an RG deck because a huge flash dude is playable, but more notably, especially consider that Fate Reforged packs don't otherwise contain a lot of cards that you want in RG.   The statistic isn't considering that you took the thing 8th pick and only ended up putting it in because it edged out [[Feral Krushok]].  The few copies of pyrotechnics that are opened are going to be snapped up by the first person who can even splash them.  It's not surprising that not many make it to the RG player.  That's part of the fallacy of these ""most frequent uncommon in winning decks of this archetype"" statistic - uncommons that are highly contested get divided between many decks.  It's exactly because this uncommon isn't highly contested (and is essentially only above D-level in one deck, where it moves to a C+ or so) that it's the most often played uncommon in RG decks."
lrcast,3djf3v,lastchancexi,2,Thu Jul 16 19:24:59 2015 UTC,"You can add all of the planeswalkers, at least for now. They may not play better, but you're probably not passing them unless the prices drop drastically."
lrcast,3djf3v,kccmtg,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:56:01 2015 UTC,"I think he was just listing rares, not mythics.  Although, he did miss [[Gaea's Revenge]], which seems just a head above Sentinel, despite its mana cost."
lrcast,3djf3v,Greyfeld,2,Thu Jul 16 20:22:00 2015 UTC,"No, I was trying to list everything. He's probably right on the planeswalkers, and I think Sentinel is better than Gaea's Revenge, just does more on a stalled board and when you're behind (while costing less)."
lrcast,3djf3v,Greyfeld,3,Thu Jul 16 20:40:45 2015 UTC,"I think Gaea's Revenge is a snap pick over Sentinel.  How difficult it is to remove makes it extremely hard for the opponent to deal with, it has enough stats to make a good blocker or attacker, and the fact that it has haste means that it can snatch wins out of thin air.  And since you're in green, you're in the perfect color to pick up ramp, so the extra mana isn't nearly as much of a hindrance.  Edit: THen again, I may be overvaluing the card because it turned out nuts in sealed.  Draft is liable to be a bit faster, making it far less likely that a 7-drop will pan out."
lrcast,3djf3v,dumac,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:43:09 2015 UTC,"I decided to add it as a question mark. No reason not to include it, I just think it's expensive and doesn't do enough when you're behind, and it's worse in a normal parity situation where the board is gummed up.. Still a very good card, but not as good as Sentinel."
lrcast,3djf3v,sylverfyre,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:52:15 2015 UTC,"Gaea's revenge is only a single mana more than sentinel watch  but comes with psuedo hexproof and is a good blocker as well.  Sentinel can get bounced/killed when you pass the turn back, allowing the opponent to alpha strike and kill you. This is unlikely to happen with gaea's revenge."
lrcast,3djf3v,dolpherx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:54:14 2015 UTC,"There aren't actually THAT many kill spells that deal with Sentinel.  Just the black ones, and the green fight card.  Even Swift Reckoning can't handle her because she never taps."
lrcast,3djf3v,cferejohn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:04:34 2015 UTC,"Gaea's Revenge is definitely better than sentinel. If they were in the same pack, you would take the gaea's revenge, and the next person would take the sentinel. If you ever go against that person, gaea's revenge beats sentinel if they are both on the battlefield."
lrcast,3djf3v,blindfremen,2,Thu Jul 16 20:48:49 2015 UTC,"Well sure, but ""which card is better head to head"" isn't really a very good metric. Sentinel is a mana cheaper and is going to be better against some boards (but then again worse against others)."
lrcast,3djf3v,dolpherx,0,Thu Jul 16 21:46:28 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't, since the Sentinel taps it every turn after the first swing.  Well fuck me, misread the card lol"

lrcast,3djf3v,MTGCardFetcher,2,Thu Jul 16 20:22:25 2015 UTC,"I'll give my own thoughts on the ? cards.  [[Graveblade Marauder]] - I actually think Sentinel is better.  I feel that Vigilance just edges out the Marauder, since she can serve as both a blocker and attacker at the same time.  [[Priest of the Blood Rite]] - I think the mana cost and evasion just barely gives this the edge over Sentinel.  While Priest is more susceptible to tap-downs and bounces, I like that it can come out a turn earlier, and that the majority of its power is tied up in a creature with flying.  That said, I think it's extremely close.  It'll really depend on strongly blue is drafted.  [[Molten Vortex]] - As good as this card is, I gotten give it to Sentinel.  This is a card that doesn't really shine until you're 10+ turns into the game, and I just don't see most red decks wanting to drag out their games for that long.  It can do some work, but it's not a card I'd want to pick up early in the draft.  [[Outland Colossus]] - Even though it's just a big, dumb creature, I think it's such a huge big, dumb creature that it overshadows Sentinel.  Sentinel stalls out the game, but Colossus just requires an answer right now.  It can block better and beat better, and it costs a mana less to cast.  It doesn't have quite the same amount of stall utility, but it's a lot more dangerous for your opponent to leave it alive on the field.  [[Woodland Bellower]] - I think I'd p1p1 this over Sentinel.  Later in the draft, it'd depend on how many good 2-3 drops I have in my deck.  Adding the extra body to the board is pretty big, which makes it great in all stages of the game, just like Sentinel.  But it has the benefit of splitting its power between two bodies, which makes it more difficult for the opponent to deal with efficiently.  [[Soulblade Djinn]] - This is a toss-up.  Not because Sentinel is necessarily better, but because the Djinn requires more build-around to be good.  Unlike last set, we don't have Rebound and quality, cheap removal spells to fuel these super-prowess effects.  However, having flying and 4 attack makes it quite the beater.  I'd probably take Djinn over Sentinel p1p1, but I'd be nervous about it.  [[Hixus]] - I think Hixus is just flat-out better than Sentinel.  Hixus' floor is keeping mana open for a combat trick and flashing him in at the end of your opponent's turn when it turns out you didn't need the trick.  His ceiling is up in the friggin' clouds.  Sentinel is always pretty much equally good at any point of the game, but Hixus ranges from good to god damned amazing.  [[Tragic Arrogance]] - Though I'd love to just take both of them, if I had to make a choice, I'd go with Tragic Arrogance.  It fits better in a control-y deck, obviously, but a sweeper for 5 is pretty damned good, and it's not really an effect you can easily replace.  [[Hangarback Walker]] - I actually answered this question in a p1p1 thread the other day, and I'll stick to my guns here: Hangerback is better than Sentinel.  Aside from being colorless (which means you can p1p1 it and still be wide open on colors), you can play it on any turn of the game, and it's still a fantastic card.  It doesn't offer the same stall ability as Sentinel, but it's extremely resilient, and can pump itself to edge you ahead when you're at parity.  It's just so, so good."

lrcast,3djf3v,Greyfeld,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:18:35 2015 UTC,I think I would choose sentinel over all of the above you mentioned except for Tragic Arrogance and Hangarback Walker due to Sentinel beating up most of the cards above 1v1 and also more relevant in other scenarios.
lrcast,3djf3v,dolpherx,3,Thu Jul 16 20:57:09 2015 UTC,I think it's extremely limiting to take a pick based on which one would win in combat.
lrcast,3djf3v,Greyfeld,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:19:03 2015 UTC,"Lol well its not just that, I also said ""more relevant in other scenarios"" lol. This is because Sentinel is good on offense and on defense. It basically ""removes"" your opponent's biggest bomb. She is good in a higher number of scenarios than a lot of the cards above. Sentinel does not require anything of you, there is no set up involved, it is splashable, very versatile. On the other hand most of the cards listed above are more narrow, some of them do not get you back into the game when you are behind."
lrcast,3djf3v,dolpherx,2,Thu Jul 16 21:32:51 2015 UTC,"The difference, I think, is that Sentinel's floor and ceiling are pretty close together.  On the other hand, a lot of the other cards' floors are around the same area, but their ceilings are a lot higher.  Banking on the ceiling of that variance is what makes a lot of drafts go 3-0, rather than just capping out at 2-1."
lrcast,3djf3v,dumac,2,Thu Jul 16 21:46:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm the list above, I can actually list them out, I was a bit lazy lol just now, but now we have a discussion.  Graveblade Marauder - Sentinel is better than this guy. Graveblade requires set up, sentinel does not.   Hangarback Walker - This is better than the sentinel due to high versatility. This card can be played on turn 2, and any turn in the game. It can also be played in any deck. And if it dies, you get value. Hard to beat this card.  Hixus - This card is good, but does require more set up than sentinel. Without its ability, it is a 4/4 flash creature, which is great but not amazing. Its ability would require you to actually get hit, so its not amazing in all scenarios as if you cant afford to take the damage, its not that great. Sentinel on the other hand, in the same scenario, would be better. Hixus will remove the best creature that hit you, but sentinel does something similar basically ""removing"" that creature, but it does not require you to take the hit. The upside of hixus is off course in its flash ability as it has versatility to use as a combat trick for double blocking, but when you use that, you do not use its exile ability.  Molten Vortex - This requires you to have lands and game go long, not something that I would want to bank on in red.  Outland Colossus - This is big and scary, but also gets bricked against all the deathtouchers that are common in the set in black and green. If they do not, outland colossus removes their weakest creature once per turn. I would still favor sentinel though as sentinel removes their BEST creature even though its not permanent.  Priest of the blood rite - there is a lot of bounce and enchantments to trap the demon that the 2 life tick can become a significant downside. True if there are no answers, this clocks the opponent way faster, but this card is beatable. I prefer to take sentinel as it is more useful when behind, ahead, and parity. Priest is not really good when you are behind in terms of life points.  Soulblade Djinn - I am not sure which is stronger. The soulblade djinn I think is stronger in drafts where you can build around it. In sealed I think I will always favor the sentinel. In drafts though I think as a first pick, I would choose sentinel over soulblade as it requires less and is splashable. The soulblade is also not good when you are behind, whereas the sentinel is. BUt the upside of the soulblade is definitely higher.  Tragic Arrogance - This card is better. Conditional wraths is so good.  Woodland Bellower - I prefer the sentinel as it requires less. I am not sure what card that I can search for with the woodland bellower that would make it amazing. When you have the mana to cast the bellower, I highly doubt in limited your 3 drop is going to be break the board. This card I think is more relevant in constructed, but in limited, not as powerful due to limited options of 3 drops. Sentinel wins again."
lrcast,3djf3v,Greyfeld,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:51:12 2015 UTC,"Graveblade requires set up, sentinel does not.   Graveblade doesn't require any set up. It is a 1/4 death touch that locks down the ground and gets you into the long game, so that you can cast cards like sentinel later. They play different roles, and I'm inclined to think the cheaper, more versatile card may be the pick.   Hixus will remove the best creature that hit you, but sentinel does something similar basically ""removing"" that creature, but it does not require you to take the hit.   Hixus removes ALL creatures that hit you. Hixus can often be a 2 for 1, and will sometimes be a 3 or more for 1.    Priest of the blood rite - there is a lot of bounce and enchantments to trap the demon that the 2 life tick can become a significant downside. True if there are no answers, this clocks the opponent way faster, but this card is beatable. I prefer to take sentinel as it is more useful when behind, ahead, and parity. Priest is not really good when you are behind in terms of life points.   Sentinel is beatable. All it takes is a removal spell. Priest gives you two bodies. The life tick isn't that big of a downside, as you can always just send the priest in for 2 damage or safe it to block. The only scenario where the life tick really hurts you is if they pacify/narcolepsy it (then they spent a card on your 2/2) or if they have all fliers and you are in a race.    Woodland Bellower - I prefer the sentinel as it requires less. I am not sure what card that I can search for with the woodland bellower that would make it amazing.   I don't think 'having a creature that costs 3 or less' is much of a requirement. Bellower gives you 2 bodies, which is again resistant to removal. You can grab all sorts of useful creatures at all rarities, and even the pretty low case of a 2/3 is very useful."
lrcast,3djf3v,dolpherx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:53:28 2015 UTC,"Sentinel vs Priest of the Blood Rite: Sentinel is better against Disperse, Claustrophobia, Suppression Bonds. You are going to see a lot of these cards. And the 2/2 body that deals 2 life to you every upkeep is rarely going to be a card because they can either stall it out or race it...   Part of what makes Sentinel so good is that only Unholy Hunger and Wild Instincts (at Common) get rid of it."

Graveblade Marauder? :P  On a more serious note, there are a number of 3-drops that would be fantastic to tutor up.  Putting aside that you can hit all the planeswalkers with it, there are a number of EtB cards in the <=3 range (Acolyte of the Inferno, Eyeblight Assassin, Bounding Krasis, Fleshbag Marauder, Ghirapur Gearcrafter, etc etc), plus a handful of creatures that are just good on their own.

lrcast,3di71k,priceQQ,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:01:16 2015 UTC,"oh, interesting!  I didn't see the fastbond!"
lrcast,3di71k,pahamack,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:30:22 2015 UTC,It is an awesome combo because it doesn't cost that much for a 3 card combo and all the cards are much better by themselves than most combo pieces in the cube (Zuran orb has won me games before independent of the other parts).  Usually I go into it with an early fastbond because people tend to value that card way lower than I do (it leads to faster combos which I like)
lrcast,3djd5p,pahamack,9,Thu Jul 16 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"If you can average going 2-1 in swiss (which isn't too hard imo), then holiday cube is free.  Holiday cube is the cheapest draft format."
lrcast,3djd5p,guyincorporated,3,Thu Jul 16 22:23:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on your exact skill level, but yeah. I think for most LR-level players, it's cheaper than normal drafting."

lrcast,3djd5p,UnsealedMTG,3,Fri Jul 17 18:09:09 2015 UTC,"So... How is cube ""insanely expensive"" to you?  Isn't it just free forever?"
lrcast,3djd5p,UnsealedMTG,2,Fri Jul 17 18:24:49 2015 UTC,"I had to start with something to get those tix, selling things of real, transferable value (DTK cards mostly). In a week those phantom tix go back to becoming worthless, when they take away cube, and since they're not transferrable I can't parlay those into origins drafts or whatever.  In the end it's like I bought a lot of monopoly money with real money. Yes, it's a LOT of monopoly money, but it's not worth anything."
lrcast,3djd5p,CelestialBeekeeper,3,Fri Jul 17 22:34:53 2015 UTC,"What you are saying is that $10 for unlimited cube drafts for whenever cube is available (5-6x a year), plus whatever other phantom drafts are available (which have been available continuously for the last few months with MM15 and MD5 drafts preceding cube) plus phantom sealed all the time is ""insanely expensive.""  Given that many people probably pay, on average, $3-5 or more per draft for normal drafting, I just don't see it. It sounds more like you are bothered that you aren't making money cube drafting. Which is fine, I suppose, but I don't consider video games that don't pay me to pay them ""insanely expensive""."
lrcast,3djd5p,Gbps,3,Fri Jul 17 22:55:17 2015 UTC,"Well when you put it that way.   I guess I'm used to the insanely privileged position of expecting to make money drafting.  Still though, the possibility of this is why I play this game when it is so hard to do, plus, for most video games, you pay the sticker price once and you can play whenever you want. Of course, the gameplay is great too, but that competitive aspect of playing for real value is great. Makes you feel that everyone is trying to eke out every last percentage to win.  My total expenditures for MTGO are certainly beyond any videogame I've ever bought."
lrcast,3djd5p,fike-the-bear,6,Fri Jul 17 23:38:30 2015 UTC,"Playing Swiss in Holiday Cube lets you make back your entry fee going 2-1, and come out ahead if you go 3-0. On average, after the first $10 it's pretty much free.  I don't see how playing a format that only pays out in Phantom points is any better that playing a format that only pays out in packs. In both, all you're doing is hoping to win so you can put your winnings towards playing future games.    This essentially makes cube drafting pay per play   All drafting is pay per play."

lrcast,3djd5p,cferejohn,2,Fri Jul 17 05:20:28 2015 UTC,"Of course I would prefer if it only cost $2, but as other have said, so long as you maintain 2-1, it's essentially free."
lrcast,3djd5p,piratehunter_mtg,2,Fri Jul 17 08:18:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's way less than you think.  Yes, it's $10 for the first draft, but then each one after it is very cheap.  I go off the rails all the time and trainwreck a lot because I'm focusing on having fun instead of winning.  If you have a precisely 50% win rate in holiday cube swiss, the EV is 11.5 phantom points which means you're paying about $3.20 per draft."
lrcast,3djd5p,fike-the-bear,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"I prefer to gain value when I draft and that is impossible with Holiday Cube because the phantom tix aren't transferable.   I'm winning an insane amount of these queues, but those tix go back to being worthless in less than a week. If I could parlay them into Origins drafts, that's a totally different proposition.   Winning a lot of cube drafts has essentially shrunk my collection. I had to pay to get into the first ones, and I did a lot of losing while finding my feet in the format at first. I can't regain that value, the exchange from tix to phantom points is one way."

From what I understand allowing phantom tickets to be turned into ""real"" value can run them afoul of gambling laws in some places.

lrcast,3djd5p,piratehunter_mtg,2,Sat Jul 18 06:24:44 2015 UTC,Play holday cube on xmage for free year round.  Holiday cube drafts fire less frequently. Every 30 to 45 mins. More often on weekends.

I think mostly because Marshall is contracted by wizards, so he kinda has to keep his endorsements squeaky clean. There was barely a mention of ""other"" tools in the CR_cast with efro, when in reality using xmage to test for the protour is a great idea. the cards come out as they are spoiled, rather than as a full set. so you can really get going.  I started on xmage doing just the booster drafts. but since I've fallen in love with holiday cube. The other thing is that people who join the cube queues on xmage will almost always play the full 3 rounds. whereas booster drafts a lot of times people draft a deck and don't feel the need to play the games out, so you'll expect to get 2 rounds.   Either way I'd suggest doing elimination the drafts fire and finish much quicker, the competition is tougher, but not by a lot."

lrcast,3di3ha,mrcjtm,7,Thu Jul 16 13:26:01 2015 UTC,"The person who controlled Liliana at the time she flipped would get the Zombie, but Liliana's owner would get the Planeswalker."
lrcast,3di3ha,h0m3r,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:01:48 2015 UTC,"You're right, that is unclear.  If it runs similar to the Exploit rules, then the token might come under control of the controller of the planeswalker after it's flipped (exploit + [[Illusionary Gains]] taught me that the exploit trigger benefits the person who gains control of the creature, not the caster of the creature, which is a similar situation in this case).  Thing is, the clause says ""you"" put the token into play, not specifically the owner or controller.  But the clause is listed after the planeswalker transforms, at which point it would already be back under the original owner's control.  I think it depends on when, exactly, the 2/2 token clause goes on the stack.  If it goes on the stack when Lilliana is exiled, then it goes to the player who stole her, while if it goes on the stack when she comes into play, transformed, it goes to the owner.  Because the clause's activator will depend entirely on who owned the creature when it went on the stack.  I think it might be the latter, though, because there's an ""if you do"" clause at the beginning of the trigger."
lrcast,3di3ha,Greyfeld,3,Thu Jul 16 17:10:01 2015 UTC,"The reason your opponents gets the exploit trigger is that they control the creature at the time the trigger goes on the stack (ie when you sac your creature). In this case you control the Liliana at the time the trigger happens, therefore I think you get the token even though you do give Liliana planeswalker back to your opponent. The ability that generates the zombie is on the creature side, which you did control, not the planeswalker side. In other words the ""you"" refers to the controller of the trigger, not the owner of the card."
lrcast,3di3ha,taumxd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:37:57 2015 UTC,"you control the Liliana at the time the trigger happens   This is the part that's up for debate.  The way I'm reading it, the zombie token trigger goes on the stack after Liliana has transformed.  However, the zombie token effect and the transformation effect could just as easily all be one really long-winded trigger, which would mean the original controller would get the token, rather than the owner.  Edit: Actually, the more I think about it, the more I'm thinking that it's just one really long trigger.  It all reads as one long ability, so that's probably how it works."
lrcast,3di3ha,Greyfeld,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:57:34 2015 UTC,"If it were two separate abilities it would need to start with the word ""When"".

lrcast,3di3ha,Greyfeld,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:10:38 2015 UTC,"Good point, I guess it depends what the ""if you do"" clause is relating to. I think the player who controlled face-up Liliana is technically the player who exiled her and returned her to the battlefield transformed under her owner's control -- so I think the ""you"" is pointing at the player who controlled Liliana before she transforms, not the player who controls her after she transforms.  But I could be wrong."
lrcast,3di3ha,derskusmacher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:31:25 2015 UTC,"Right, but if you look at Exploit from Dragons, it's a very similar setup.  Basically, you get to choose whether or not to sacrifice a creature after your exploit creature comes into play, and if you do, you put the exploit trigger on the stack (the ""if you do"" clause isn't explicitly stated in the rulebook, but it's obviously implied).  In the case if Illusory Gains, the choice to exploit goes on the stack before the Illusory Gains trigger does, stealing the creature before you can choose to exploit one of your own.  If you still choose to exploit a creature, your opponent gains the effect of the exploit trigger, because they own the creature that is creating the effect.  Similarly, it sounds to me as if the switch in control over Lilliana would change who gets the token back to the original owner, because the generation of the token is predicated either on who owns Lilliana when the trigger goes on the stack, or when it resolves, which would be the permanent's owner in either case.  This is just my assumption, anyway, I could be completely wrong."
lrcast,3di3ha,derskusmacher,-2,Thu Jul 16 17:58:06 2015 UTC,I don't think you will get the chance to use any of the planeswalker abilities after she flips as she goes back to her owner's control after the transformation.

For those who care, the “Guidelines for Alphabetical Arrangement of Letters and Sorting of Numerals and Other Symbols” states commas and apostrophes should be disregarded for arrangement purposes.  Thus the next characters to be sorted after ‘Chandra’ are space vs. ‘s’.  Spaces sort before letters, therefore Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh is technically first in alphabetical order.  Incidentally, this is also how Wizards sorts them.  tl;dr: When sorting alphabetically, you typically ignore punctuation, and Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh should come first."

lrcast,3dhbdl,Carribi,9,Thu Jul 16 14:24:38 2015 UTC,"Chandra's Ignition is a ridiculous bomb and i can't believe Marshall rated it so low.  If you have a 4+ power creature and cast this, most often you are wiping the board of everything else, doing 4 to your opponent, then attacking with the sole remaining creature on the board for another 4+.  8 damage to your opponent and wipe the board except for my creature?  Yes, i will take that.  Heck even using it on a 3/3 is still value city, and since you clearly know about it, you can play around it.  And red has a decent amount of high power dudes - like cobblebrute 5/2 for 4 mana at common, or Prickleboar which is 5/3 on your turn.  The setup cost is just playing a normal game of magic, playing creatures.  The amount of tricks which stop this are pretty low (instant speed removal and counterspells) and you can typically wait to play until your opponent has tapped low anyway - you dont have to slam it on turn 5.  This is not a C- card, and if i was in red i would never pass this."

lrcast,3dhbdl,nerlix,5,Thu Jul 16 17:09:45 2015 UTC,"There just aren't enough ways of interacting with Chandra's ignition. Black 5 mana kill spells, disperse, fiery impulse if the target is small enough.   It's pretty safe just slamming this down.   It won me many games at the prerelease including games I couldn't have possibly won with other cards. It's a card that can take you from behind to ahead. I crafted a few board States to devastate my opponents at the pre release. The best was a cobblebrute killing my thopter and about 4 of his creatures, hitting him for 5 with the spell, clearing the board so I can hit him for 5 also."

They are equally conditional .. just different conditions.  My guess is that come sunset show this will be the card Marshall was furthest off on and i wouldnt be surprised if LSV moves it up a full grade too.   EDIT: I am a little surprised that no-one is discussing it as constructed playable. Lets stretch the bounds of imagination and look at it in the conifer strider deck as the fringe of standard. The power level is definitely there, the cost is not prohibitive, WR heroic finisher? GR outland colossus? .. even in the sideboard i could see this getting play in 6 months time.

lrcast,3dhbdl,hfxRos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:05:01 2015 UTC,"well, there are other things happening too. if your opponent figures out that you have the card in your hand, and they are playing around it, then you are also down a card effectively. and in the case of disperse, it's only two mana, so they may be able to continue to develop their board."
lrcast,3dhbdl,priceQQ,2,Fri Jul 17 14:42:11 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to decide on an aggregate rating. When it's good, it's REALLY good, at or around the A level. When it's average, it's still pretty good, but there are a lot of scenarios where your opponent can recover. There's really no ""bad"" situation, other than cases where almost any card is bad. But there's a very real danger of a major mana investment being ruined by removal, and this card makes Disperse and Turn to Frog far more valuable than they otherwise would be. There's some interactions that should make you frown: an opponent with Revenant or Deep-Sea Terror is not completely upset when you send 4 creatures to their yard, and a Necromantic Summons in the aftermath is really good value.  I feel like it's an A in the right deck 50% of the time, B or better almost any time it resolves, but you have to be very careful to play around removal and Disperse. It is easiest to make it pay off in a slower deck, and it feels like it interacts well with RB. I don't know if that deck likes being slow in this format or not. It's probably a skill-tester, too. Sometimes it'll be right to play on a 3/3, other times you'll want to wait for your bigger creatures. Knowing when to do which will be a big deal.  C- seems pretty harsh, but if you expect almost every opponent to be holding a Disperse or Negate (which they definitely will game 2) and you consider that a lot of good decks can recover from a board clear, I could see not treating it as a bomb."

While there is a real drawback, I've seen this card do a lot of work in sealed. Warping your deck around this won't be good, but imagine playing a trick on a opponent's creature when he attacks. Block and trade and you just killed two creatures. Even just getting a blocker out of the way works great in a tempo deck.  It will not break the format, but I'd give it a nice c+."

Helpful hint, ""lethal damage"" doesn't actually check to see if it would kill the creature.

I played a WB enchantment deck on the pre-release with two [[Weight of the Underworld]], a [[Suppression Bonds]], an [[Infernal Scarring]], a [[Shadows of the Past]], and a [[Blightcaster]], and Sigil was by far the least useful card in the deck.    Over the course of 4 rounds, I never got more than 1 angel on the field in any given game.  I had way too many times when I played the card after I'd already emptied my hand of enchantments, because I had to use them as removal in the earlier parts of the game.  And dropping it on turn 5 felt really bad, because I was just not doing anything on the board, then hoping that I drew into my other enchantments.  It might get better with a couple [[Totem-Guide Hartebeest]], but at that point, your deck is extremely high curve, and you're probably just going to get blown out by your average midrange deck that can curve out and threaten lethal before your combo gets off the ground.  Honestly, I feel like Sigil is a strictly worse [[Skywise Teachings]].  Teachings came out at 1 less mana and synergized with Rebound really well.  You get bigger creatures with Sigil, but it just takes so much more effort to get it rolling.    And on top of that, the enchantments you want to draft are the strong removal-based enchantments that everybody else wants to draft, anyway, so it's not like you're going to be just wheeling cards that nobody else wants.  Edit: I want to point out that you guys failed to mention the biggest up-side of Sword of the Animist: Every time you pull a land card with it, you're thinning out your deck and improving the chances of drawing gas.  It effectively improves your late game by reducing the chances of flooding out."

I'd had Nantuko Husk on the field and he'd Claustraphobia'd one of my creatures.  I was leaving it there so I could pump my husk for free if he ever blocked it, but had he played Tragic Arrogance, I would have been able to sac the enchanted creature to my Husk to keep him from picking that creature to stay on the board.  So keep in mind: if they have a way to sac creatures, they can force your hand on what you can/can't make them keep on the board."

lrcast,3dhbdl,Baxter0402,3,Thu Jul 16 14:06:46 2015 UTC,"They said Liliana's planeswalker side was pretty disappointing compared to Chandra's, so even if she does flip more easily you're getting less for it."

I had Lilli at the prerelease and while she looks like the best on paper, when I flipped her I often had cards in hand while my opponent was hellbent, making +1ing terrible, and minusinging to raise dead a 3-drop not incredible."
lrcast,3dhbdl,RPBiohazard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:09:31 2015 UTC,"The thing I like best about Liliana is that people will contort their play to not have her flip.  You can chump attack with 2/2s and they'll not block, since you'll just get the 2/2 back and get a planeswalker to boot.  I think it's just a matter of time until people figure out that you should just let her flip, but until then you can get an advantage."

It's 7 mana sorcery speed scry5, that draws 2 or 3 on average? 7 mana is a lot, and when you whiff with this card you whiff hard. I played this card on my Saturday prerelease, and I can tell you I didn't think it was horrible, but I would have happily replaced it if I had something else. I don't think it's close to B range, probably closer to C-, or D. All of that said, I did get to live the (very lucky) dream of scrying 5, seeing only the 1/4 reach spider, scrying all to the bottom and revealing outland colossus. I honestly think this is best case scenario, and while it won me that game, this is out of the norm."
lrcast,3dhbdl,AestheticDeficiency,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:28:51 2015 UTC,I think in the cases where you really miss hard with the card you'll be glad to have just been able to scry 5 cards to the bottom..

lrcast,3dhbdl,Greyfeld,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:28:55 2015 UTC,"Scry's deceptively powerful. Scry 5 basically means you never have to draw a land again, unless your next 5 top decks were going to be land, in which case you're still gaining massive advantage by bottoming the lot.  You've basically got to turn off the randomness of your deck for a few turns.  You also get to draw your cards in the ideal order for using your mana effectively, which is how you win at Magic.  And finally, that's the worst case scenario. The best is you top deck Skysnare Spider and your opponent drowns in your card advantage."

I understand not playing the 2/1 two drops in sealed, as they're garbage top decks, but I tend to think they might be important in this format to trade with renown creatures early. I am surprised you didn't include Watercourser though, that guy's sweet."
lrcast,3dii8b,R_O_L_E_S,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:58:32 2015 UTC,"Angel's Tomb was mainly for the synergies with things like Thopter Spy Network, Whirler Rogue and Disperse that should help me continue to put out creatures regularly. Ramroller I went back and forth on but it is relatively powerful in this deck both early and late. Obviously it will struggle when if I am already behind.  I haven't had a chance to play any of the Origins cards yet so I may be way off but Watercourser seems just meh to me. I've never been a fan of these kinds of cards but if I see him in limited I'll give him a try and see if he impresses me."

lrcast,3dii8b,R_O_L_E_S,2,Thu Jul 16 17:59:43 2015 UTC,Blue/Red look like your deepest colors and it seems like you have a lot of the moving parts for a decent thopter deck.  Real shame to live Missa Nissa sitting on the sidelines with the mana-gorger... maybe splash green if your 22nd and 23rd cards start getting a bit too jenky
lrcast,3dii8b,kccmtg,2,Thu Jul 16 16:05:21 2015 UTC,"After a quick glance, I think it's definitely UR. You've got a lot of the good thopter makers and some of the good thopter payoff (thopter spy network, artifact lord, sigil). I think it's probably right to run Willbreaker buf I'm not positive. Even just one trigger with it is great value and you have some okay ways to trigger it."
lrcast,3dii8b,Unique_Identifier,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:05:47 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is actually a pretty tough pool. Your green is amazing, but there are only 7 cards. The only color that seems deep enough to pair it with is red, which has a lot of decent cards but not anything truly broken.  White has Tragic Arrogance and double Celestial Flare with some decent filler, but nothing too aggressive. Black has some decent cards but nothing that actively wants me to play it.  Blue paired with red might be the best option - triple Gearcrafter, Thopter Spy Network and Whirler Rogue give you enough artifact synergies to play Chief of the Foundry and maybe Ramroller while providing Fiery Impluse, Claustrophobia, and Lightning Javelin as removal. Early ways to interact are going to be the biggest problem, so you might need to play sub-par 2 drops like Subterranean Scout and Screeching Skaab as a way to interact with the fast renown decks. Willbreaker is probably a trap, as there won't be many ways to actually use his ability without taking care of the creature in some way - the only options I see are Subterranean Scout, Whirler Rogue, and Rogue's Passage without using a burn spell on a larger creature."
lrcast,3dii8b,SirChuffly,2,Thu Jul 16 16:11:42 2015 UTC,I was very happy to see Nissa when I glanced over my cards but like you said green was just nowhere near deep enough and was the first colour I ended up cutting. I did consider white but in the end U/R just seemed the best option.
lrcast,3dii8b,Senzuran,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:38:35 2015 UTC,"I'd build an aggressively oriented U/R artifacts deck, specifically the following:  2x Subterranean Scout 3x Ghirapur Gearcrafter 1x Angel's Tomb 1x Acolyte of the Inferno 1x Boggart Brute 1x Chief of the Foundry 1x Whirler Rogue 1x Skyraker Giant 1x Willbreaker 1x Prickleboar 1x Seismic Elemental 1x Ringwarden Owl  1x Fiery Impulse 1x Titan's Strength 1x Disperse 1x Artificer's Epiphany 1x Claustrophobia 1x Lightning Javelin 1x Thopter Spy Network  1x Evolving Wilds 1x Rogue's Passage 8x Mountain 8x Island  This pool is a little unusual in that you have multiple build around rares (Spy Network and Willbreaker) and a build that not only supports them but is quite strong without them, meaning you're not all in on one or two cards. Willbreaker may prove to be too clunky but at this point in the format and with several good ways to trigger it, I'd err on the side of playing sweet cards."

It's also a 3/3 with haste, so it really has a high chance of ending games.  I would probably also maindeck the Ancient Grudge in cube.  There's so many busted artifacts and decks of all types will be running Moxes and Signets.  The artifact theme is extremely strong, so it's a little like running it maindeck if you were in Mirrodin."

In 4-booster, you make a minimum 30-card deck. You'll want 12-13 lands and around 12 creatures at least. I think I usually run 13 lands. The other thing to remember is that your bombs will come up more frequently because of the smaller deck, but so will your opponents'. Removal and especially unconditional removal is very important."

I was under the impression that the format was bomb-centric too (more akin to Booster Pack Wars, or minimaster if you know it) but for what you're telling me having a high number of creatures instead of low-impact spells is key (so i guess no room for otherwise fine cards like Anticipate). For the ones who have played it, is splashing a 3rd color viable, or is better to be strict in 2 colors, maybe filling the gap with megamorph creatures?"

I am not arguing that people with a vote should vote for Saito this year.  I am saying that those with a vote should use this opportunity to carefully consider whether they would ever vote for Saito. Hypothetically lets say he wins the next 5 protours in a row, and most people would agree he is now playing clean. Would you vote for him? ever?  While I am not an advocate of universal moral redemption, i do believe that it should be stretched as far as is tolerable. I think the limit of forgiveness is one of the most interesting questions we ask ourselves both individually and as a society.  My personal view is that such low stakes (relative to broader social impact), high yield (relative to individual impact) constructs such as the Magic HoF are the best possible vehicles to socially recognize the value of individual redemption.  As one last point, I would refer people to Ben Stark's latest article on CFB. I think he captures a lot of the complexity that accompanies the privilege of being afforded a vote in the HoF."

I am nobody. Ben Stark, member of the HoF, someone i personally hold a deep respect for, is willing to entertain the possibility that he may contribute to Saito one day joining the HoF, welcoming him as a peer to the highest accolade we offer.  I feel that now we as a community, also have a vote, the least we can do is to genuinely consider (and debate) what we want the HoF to reflect.   There are many people that will not vote for Efro because of their experiences of his behavior 5 years ago. My personal values do not preclude an individual for prior transgressions up to a point (having spent a lot of time thinking about it, i have a painfully specific definition of this, but ultimately i would much rather work off a communal ""gut feel"" for these things).   I'm not saying you are wrong to advocate not voting for Saito this year, but things going as they are, Saito is going to be part of our community for many, many years to come.

That part stands out to me, you have to be very competitive to get to play for the top spots in pro tours and Willy declining a spot in the best team in the world (which carries an enormous advantage with it) to help other players from Brazil shows that he values helping the Brazilian community over everything else in magic.

Would you rather have 50% of a Scaab or 70% of a Leaf Glider (numbers made up, but I think that makes the point)."
lrcast,3dg1xx,Greyfeld,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:46:53 2015 UTC,"I'd still rather take the Skaab.  I don't think Leaf Glider is strong enough that I really care if I miss out on its ability.  The only exception to that would be is if I end up in some sort of green ramp deck, but that's not something you can really bank on with the first pick of the draft."
lrcast,3dg1xx,cferejohn,2,Thu Jul 16 16:45:37 2015 UTC,Sure. If they were both one color I'd take the Skaab easy. I do think Leaf Glider is better than you are giving it credit for though.
lrcast,3dg1xx,Greyfeld,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"Leaf Glider is a ramp card, pure and simple.  You won't be attacking with it for at least the first couple turns, which means it's not an aggro card.  In the late game, it's a 2/1 for 2, which is not a good topdeck.  Unless you specifically need ramp for some reason (like your deck is exceptionally top-heavy), or you've managed to just put together the balls-to-the-wall GB elf deck, it's just not a very exciting card.  The only part of the game it's good is in development, that's it.  I'm not saying that the card is bad, I'm just saying it's no better than a C+.  Skaab is a solid B.  Honestly, it's not that much better than [[Whisperer of the Wilds]], and the only reason it's even marginally better is that it trades for other 2-drops when you no longer need the extra mana.  Leaf Glider, in all its solidness, is something you want to pick up after you're a pack or two in and you've determined that the ramp will be useful.  Skaab is a card you can first-pick and it'll give you a reason to seriously consider going UB (or at least going one of those colors and plashing for the other)."
lrcast,3dg1xx,cferejohn,2,Thu Jul 16 17:20:02 2015 UTC,"Leaf Glider is a ramp card, pure and simple. You won't be attacking with it for at least the first couple turns, which means it's not an aggro card.   If you are curving out so well that you aren't attacking with it, great. It is pretty frequent in limited that my curve doesn't exactly play out perfectly so I'll often not need the extra mana and get to swing. Yeah, I agree with C+.  First picking the Skaab is fine as long as you bear in mind that if you are drafting correctly you probably won't play it the majority of the time. There are pretty few ways to splash in this format and splashing for a card that provides incremental advantage (rather than ""boom oops I win"") isn't usually a great idea. If either blue or black is cut, you almost certainly aren't playing this card."
lrcast,3dg1xx,Greyfeld,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:35:33 2015 UTC,"I think the splash depends on how good the rest of your deck is, and whether you have a critical mass of cards that would be worth recurring.  I also might not splash for it if it's the only card in the color I'm going to splash, but if I end up with another 1-2 cards in that splash color that would just make my deck fantastic, then it'll be worth splashing for.  I mean, if I end up BG, but I managed to fall into a Jace or Jhessian Thief or Mizzium Meddler in an otherwise dead pack, then it's a great splash.  I just feel like going P1P1 on a card with higher floor and ceiling, that you may not end up playing, is worth more than P1P1 a card that is more likely to see play, but is pretty easily replaceable by any one of your potential other 40+ picks.  Edit: Changed my blue example cards.  Claustrophobia is double blue, and splashing a double-color card is never a good idea."

It gets you a small 3 mana body and an extra card, but often when you are behind you won't have the time to cast all the cards in yoru hand anyway.  I would go with Leaf Glider over the Scaab, mainly because of the color requirements. I REALLY don't want to pick a two color card first in this format, as it doesn't seem like a format you want to splash in and picking a 2 color card only has a little bit more than a 10% chance to make it in my deck probably."

Pack 3: Whirler Rogue Not close - card is nuts. If that wasn't there It's probably Leaf Glider, but Possessed Scab is really good, even if it is 2 colors.  Pick 4: Soulblade Djinn. Jhessian Thief is a little ways back, followed by Rhox Maulers and Suppression Bonds.  Pick 5: Gilt-Leaf Winnower - Yeah, it will miss sometimes, but even the raw stats won't kill you.

lrcast,3dga5d,DMC3628,11,Thu Jul 16 01:10:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like Renown is being misunderstood. You generally don't build a Renown deck so much as you build a midrange deck with creatures that have Renown on them. You do this because most creatures with Renown are reasonably costed to begin with, and Renown simply provides the bonus that puts them over the top.  This is also why a Renown deck isn't generally going to be available.  Sure, player A may have a few more cards to help his guys get through--Subterranean Scouts or Whirler Rogue or Separatist Voidmage, for instance--but player B who is just playing W/G Goodstuff will still want Topan Freeblade or Consul's Lieutenant because, well, they're good stuff.   Really if there's anything you do different it's to draft those enablers slightly higher once you have a good deal of creatures with Renown in your deck, and maybe throw in that 1/3 that draws cards. But even those enablers are just good cards that go in all decks. There's just nothing particularly special about Renown that makes it different from a normal aggressive creature deck. The upside of getting that first hit in is significant enough to make the cards powerful and dangerous, but not enough to make it worthwhile to throw two cards (Mighty Leap or that enchantment that taps things when you attack) into making a slightly bigger creature"
lrcast,3dga5d,SinibusUSG,3,Thu Jul 16 02:49:45 2015 UTC,"Well, Ampryn Tactician clearly is a good card, so I don't know what you're on about there. Also, a surprising amount of your advice seems predicated on opening one of the best rares in the set, and other than that a lot of this is the same as any Limited aggro deck."
lrcast,3dga5d,Sceptilesolar,2,Thu Jul 16 01:48:36 2015 UTC,"Ampryn Tactician   I dunno, I think I'd list it an average card.  It's overcosted for its stats, its ability only activates for a single turn, and only becomes relevant if you're ahead or at parity.  It's a bad/mediocre card if you're behind on the board, and doesn't do much during the development stages of the game.  It's clearly best when your opponent has a slow start, but I'd place that squarely under the ""ahead"" quadrant.  Personally, I'd rather run something like [[War Oracle]], [[Pharika's Disciple]], or [[Somberwald Alpha]] in the 4-slot.  Hell, I might even prefer [[Llanowar Empath]] or [[Charging Griffin]], depending on how the rest of my deck looks."
lrcast,3dga5d,Greyfeld,3,Thu Jul 16 01:59:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but listing a bunch of other 4 drops doesn't make it worse, especially when a couple are uncommons or not in the same color and thus don't actually compete with the Tactician directly. Charging Griffin is the only actual competition here.  And I'm not calling it great or anything, I'm just protesting on him lumping it in as a bad combat trick. The card is clearly a solid creature."
lrcast,3dga5d,Sceptilesolar,-1,Thu Jul 16 03:17:00 2015 UTC,"We're talking about a Renown deck, which is WG.  All those cards I listed are on-color.  And that's putting aside the possibility that a specific 3-drop or 5-drop is just clearly better than running Tactician."
lrcast,3dga5d,Greyfeld,4,Thu Jul 16 03:40:12 2015 UTC,"Well, Renown clearly isn't just WG. OP said it was, but I don't know why he would when red has just as many good renown creatures.  I don't see why you would ever be averse to running Tactician in an aggressive deck with renowned creatures. The possibility that you can play an on curve 4 drop that simultaneously lets your early creatures punch through blockers when you need them to just makes it worth it."
lrcast,3dga5d,Sceptilesolar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:46:14 2015 UTC,"Well, Renown clearly isn't just WG. OP said it was, but I don't know why he would when red has just as many good renown creatures.   There are 4 playable red renown cards vs green's 7.  Chances are more likely than not, if you're making a ""renown"" deck, it's going to be WG.  WR is liable to just be straight aggro.  Not that there's really much of a benefit to specifically drafting Renown cards, aside from their standalone power.  But the entire discussion centered around the typical GW Renown deck, which is why my entire reply was predicated on that discussion.  Trying to pick apart my stance by changing the entire framing of the question doesn't actually disprove anything I've said."
lrcast,3dga5d,Greyfeld,2,Thu Jul 16 03:52:52 2015 UTC,"I agree that you are slightly more likely to have a heavier renowned deck in WG, but restricting the discussion to that still seems odd and not really in line with how the format actually plays out. Anyway. I did not change the framing of the question, I just objected to GW as an aside. If we assume that we're only talking about the GW flavor, that doesn't disprove anything I've said either. The main point here is that a 4 mana 3/3 that can push your guys through when you need it is solid."

Often, you're going to either sitting with the card rotting in your hand until you can set up the perfect board state to play it, or playing it just to get another body on the board.  It's not the worst card, for sure, but it's still very ""meh.""  I agree with the crew's C rating (I'd personally give it a C-, but that's just my opinion)."

lrcast,3dedkr,escplan9,3,Wed Jul 15 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"The question is what will be the card we all end up with hundreds of because nobody takes it.  To a casual player, mana curve is a thing. 1/1 for 1 with an upside is a good 1 drop, especially when you don't play enough limited to know that 1 drops aren't a thing you need to worry about in draft. I know not to play it. You know not to play it. That guy who usually ran a banner in 3x khans for ramp is going to play this, mark my words.

She proceeded to do up a spreadsheet to help do the calculations for such a situation that factored in the cost to draft,  the value of the card and the prizing.   Basically,  the replacement value of the pick you gave up would have to be pretty astronomical to make it worth it to draft the 'correct'  card over a card that is worth  more than a few bucks.  For me, it's about $3-5"
lrcast,3ddkbv,mightythrog,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:28:53 2015 UTC,"I'd say that that is a pretty extreme example. I don't think I could have resisted the Delta then to be honest, even though it significantly hinders my chance to win."
lrcast,3ddkbv,Rathji,2,Thu Jul 16 15:36:13 2015 UTC,"It doesn't though. Let me explain. This is on my phone,  so it might be overly brief.   Let's assume a card exists where if you get it,  you win. Citadel Siege is a pretty good example of a such a card,  but we know that this 'sure-win' card doesn't exist.   The odds of you drawing that card in any particular game is at most  6.25% if you draw 15 cards (7 for starting hand and 8 turns average,  which is probably high, but if you don't draw it before then it likely won't make an impact anyway.)   Then,  even assuming it truly it is 'sure-win' you need to figure that it won't actually earn you a win every time it gets out because you would have won anyway,  regardless of what card is in that slot.  If we were not using the example of a 'sure win'  card then we would also need to consider 1) it might not be enough to push you from losing to winning. 2) The value of the card you would have replaced it with  is likely not zero, even if you had no other playables,  you could always run a land. It's hard to put a number on this,  but we know it isn't zero. For our example we assume that every time we get it in our hand,  we win. We know that is not true,  but it simplifies the math.  So,  playing 6-9 games your cumulative odds of drawing and playing the 'sure-win' card is  about 40-50% in total (from memory,  someone can prove me wrong if they like, but I think that is right). Again,  let's assume the high end and you have a 50% chance of drawing that card, which is good,  because it also makes the math easier. That means,  the card gives you an additional +0.5 wins per draft. Lets also assume that this game win will also give us a match win,  assuming that with an average opponent and an average deck,  you win 50% of the other games.   At 2 packs per win,  that means the value of that pick towards your final winnings is 1 pack. Therefore,  if the card you pick over the 'sure win card', is worth more than a pack,  you made the right choice.   Now,  factor in that this 'sure win'  card doesn't exist and the value above replacement isn't ever 100%, you should consider this model as the extreme best case scenario, and approximate accordingly give your prize support and the card in question.  edit: some formatting etc"
lrcast,3ddkbv,mightythrog,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"Personally, it has to be a VERY good card to pass up a card worth even £3-5. I don't generally have a ton of money to spend on Magic so anytime I can cut the cost of a draft down is a huge bonus. If I can get it to work out evening out then that is living the dream.  That said, it does obviously depend on the card in question. If my rare in a pack is something like a Llanowar Wastes then there needs to be something very strong in that pack to stop me taking it and probably something uncommon. Fiery Impulse is a very good limited card for example and first pickable in many cases but it is also a common so I have a good chance to see it again later and in that case I'll take the valuable card. However, if we're talking Whirler Rogue or Thopter Engineer then I would strongly consider them because I don't know if I'll see them again."
lrcast,3de9en,SmithNumber6,3,Wed Jul 15 16:19:09 2015 UTC,"As a starting point, I'd look into buylists, eBay, and PucaTrade.  Online stores like Channel Fireball, Star City Games, and Card Kingdom offer you cash or store credit for your cards (generally giving you a bonus if you choose store credit).  The main advantage is that you don't have to do much work; you just look at how much they offer for your cards, contact the store, and mail them.  The down side is that they will pay you less than what the cards retail for (naturally, since they need to turn a profit selling singles).    I'd presume that you're familiar with how eBay works; you auction off your cards and ship them to whoever purchases them.  You'll generally get more money than if you buylist them (but not as much as retail prices).  You'll have to do research to figure out how much you can expect to get for your cards and how much to set the price (if you're doing a buy-it-now option) and compare this to how much you can get from buylisting.  PucaTrade is a relatively new site that allows you to send people cards in exchange for ""points,"" which you can then turn around and exchange for other cards.  I haven't tried it personally, but some of my friends have had success in flipping cards they've opened for ones they need.  This seems best if you just want to trade for more singles on an even basis, but seems to have the highest setup cost of the options I've listed."
lrcast,3de9en,steric_hindrance,5,Wed Jul 15 17:51:25 2015 UTC,Pucatrade is awesome and I fully recommend it to anyone who hasn't already signed up. I've already sent half the rares I opened at my pre-release that way. However it isn't great for trading away promo cards because one of the drawbacks of the free tier of membership is that you cannot receive foils. That rules out 90% of potential trading partners and can make it difficult to find anyone who wants them.  eBay is fine for stuff like this but be aware that by the time eBay and paypal fees have been taken off you won't get as much as the headline price. Something to bear in mind when comparing to the store credit you'd get from e.g. Card Kingdom which is also much less hassle.

And I'm not even super active with trades. I check every couple days if I can send out bigger money cards, then go through the options to see if I can add on cheaper ones with the same postage. Then I wait forever to get my cards and why aren't they here now! I'm impatient."

lrcast,3decl5,Rvant,2,Wed Jul 15 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"Decks aren't necessarily slower or faster, but they are much more powerful. Fast decks get faster and slow decks get slower.  Find the best archetypes in the format that don't share a lot of cards/colors, and hopefully your pool will line up well with them.  Balance decks, although obviously if one archetype is way better than the others and you can build it, definitely do.  You'd rather have the strongest player play the weakest deck, but I don't think most people judge by matching player strength to deck strength. Instead, you match players to decks by preference; what do they want to play?  A WG or WR Renown deck is going to exist in just about every pool. Some kind of blue-black or green-black control deck. Maybe an artifact synergies deck. I imagine those are the most common.  Lastly, one of the biggest challenge in team sealed is deck construction. Try and practice if you can, as the amount of time you'll get is limited; as a result, unlike normal Sealed, Team Sealed pools are usually not built optimally. If everyone can split responsibilities and work well together at a team, you'll have a big advantage."

lrcast,3dd1dx,Skythz,5,Wed Jul 15 08:54:56 2015 UTC,"Phoenix is a fine first pick.   P1P7 - I would take Jeskai Sage over Whisk Away. P1P10 - why the green card? I'd take Temur Battle Rage here. P1P14 - Refocus is better than Boom Keg.    P2P1 - Utter End is a good card, no doubt, but at this point you're in red, black and blue already. I'd be tempted to take Opulent Palace and start making sure I can actually cast things. P2P2 - Empty the Pits is pretty bad. Especially because it has BBBB in the casting cost and you're in four colours. Debilitating Injury on the other hand is much more realistically castable, and one of the best early plays in the format. P2P3 - Shambling Attendants is OK, but you can pick up these big delve guys later if you want them. Mystic of the Hidden Way makes more sense here. It's a great evasive beater and in a 3+ colour deck being able to cast it face down will help smooth your curve. P2P4 - not a great pack for you. Unyielding Krumar is meh. Quite replaceable. I'd probably take Master the Way. P2P5 - Weave Fate isn't great and they tend to go quite late. You'd rather have Treasure Cruise or Bitter Revelation for your card draw. Witness of the Ages seems like a solid pick here. P2P7 - Rite is bottom-tier removal. I'd take the Whirlwind Adept. P2P9 - I'd take the second Flock. You already have a few 2-drops and this one's distinctly mediocre.    P3P1 - taking Alabaster Kirin over Abzan Battle Priest seems insane. Kirin is good, but the Priest is REALLY good. Even so, I'm not sure you want to be moving so hard into White. I'd take Bitter Revelation. P3P2 - you don't need another random 2-drop, but you do need fixing. Take the Swiftwater Cliffs.  If you've decided not to play red and are moving into white instead, Ainok Bond-Kin would be a lot better for your deck than Mardu Skullhunter (especially if you had the Battle Priest) P3P3 - Mystic is a good choice, but Cruise is also worth considering here. P3P5 - you have a lot of 2-drops now. I would absolutely take Debilitating Injury over Skullhunter. P3P7 - so... you are playing red? This is a fine card, but you need to think about what you can actually cast. You don't have the fixing to go four colours, and you're unlikely to see much more. If I had moved into white by this point I'd take War Behemoth and be happy to get it.  Smite the Monstrous would be fine too, but I think you need more 3-drops. P3P9 - Dragon Throne of Tarkir is really bad. Remember earlier when I said Unyielding Krumar was meh? This is the point you'd expect to see them. You don't really need to take them earlier, but it's be a fine choice here.  Rush of Battle might be fine too, seeing as you took a ton of 2-drops... P3P10 - bad pack, but at least take Shatter for your sideboard instead of a basic mountain. I assume it was foil, but if you really want foil basics just buy them. P3P11 - I'd rather take the banner here. I think you need the fixing. It isn't a good card, but it helps fix a problem in your deck. P3P12 - hey look, another Unyielding Krumar! It'd be a better choice than hatedrafting the death frenzy, and so would hatedrafting the Archer's Parapet. P3P13 - take the parapet here. Quiet Contemplation doesn't belong in your deck and isn't worth hatedrafting. Potentially denying somebody a good defensive 2-drop is a better use of this pick.    On the whole, you seem a little greedy with the number of colours you're trying to play off minimal fixing. Dual lands and tri-lands are super important to playing three colours or more.   EDIT: I meant Unyielding Krumar, not Krumar Bond-Kin."
lrcast,3dd1dx,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:17:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comments.  I was going under the impression that red was drying up, so I went blue instead of red.  The white, was just a splash (Basically for Utter end).  I didn't grab the outlast cards because I was just splashing so an activated ability in that color wasn't ideal.  Granted, if I could cast the card, I could use the ability so likely would have been a better choice.    Some of them were just 'rare' drafting (The Empty the pits, the Dragon Throne, the foil mountain, Boom Keg, and the Death Frenzy).  I thought the ticket value was higher than the incremental advantage any other card would give me.  Why is the Jeskai sage better than whisk away?  Without exploit, I don't think it's as useful."
lrcast,3dd1dx,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,2,Wed Jul 15 11:44:59 2015 UTC,"White just being a splash shouldn't cause you to take Kirin over Abzan Battle Priest. If you can cast it, you can pay for the ability. If you don't want to be too heavily in white, take the Bitter Revelation.   Some of them were just 'rare' drafting (The Empty the pits, the Dragon Throne, the foil mountain, Boom Keg, and the Death Frenzy).   Those cards are worth nothing. Only empty the pits has any value, and it's only 1 ticket or so.   Why is the Jeskai sage better than whisk away?   Whisk Away is a fine card in a tempo deck. Jeskai Sage is a decent 2-drop in any blue deck. Exploit synergises very well with it, but a 2-mana creature that can chump-block something or even threaten to trade, and then draws you a card when it dies is pretty good anyway."

""I took the dragon fodder over the twin bolt.""  No, you took the draconic roar over the twin bolt.  The entire discussion of creatures vs removal afterward was irrelevant.  Edit: Huge mistake taking the phoenix over the other two cards.  Emissary shores up your 2-drops (on top of synergizing with exploit), and Angler synergizes with your Executioners.  Also, I feel that Reach of Shadows was a better pick over Pyro, since the former is an instant, and you have more than enough small-creature spot removal."

lrcast,3daz8u,GrimR3eaper99,3,Tue Jul 14 21:38:38 2015 UTC,"There was a recent episode of LR on sealed - it is probably worth a listen.   In terms of the kinds of decks you see, in general sealed is a little slower and you will very rarely see a super synergistic deck. This means you can afford to be a little greedier with mana bases and splashing for bombs, but it is easy to take this too far.  Also in sealed you tend to have access to a vast array of sideboard options, including siding into another color/deck altogether (if playing in person you'll want to be ready to do this).   In terms of how to draft, the 50,000 foot view is to try to get into open colors. If you're being passed a bunch of good white cards, go into white, even if you didn't pick any white cards in your first couple picks. Of course you may have picked really strong cards in other colors and maybe those colors are ""open enough"" to make the bombs worthwhile. It is a complex series of cascading decisions.  In terms of getting better:   Listen to LR. Watch streamers or YouTubers draft - Marshall posts on ChannelFireball's Youtube and Noah Sandler on MtgoAcademy is also an excellent player."
lrcast,3daz8u,cferejohn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:30:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a newer player and have been listening my way through the ""Useful shows to hear"" list - but most of those are Draft focused - is there a ""highlights of Sealed episodes"" list somewhere that you know about?  (My local shop tends to prefer Sealed to Draft)"
lrcast,3daz8u,elk12429,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:49:59 2015 UTC,"They do focus more on draft than sealed, but they've done 2 or 3 episodes that focused on sealed specifically - a browse through episode titles should find them I think. A lot of the advice is applicable to both (other than things that are specifically about drafting)."
lrcast,3daz8u,cferejohn,3,Wed Jul 15 17:52:25 2015 UTC,"I think the most important difference is that curving out is less important in sealed, and both bombs and cards that can answer them are more important.   What I'll generally do in sealed is separate the good cards (the one that give me a reason to play that color) from everything else. Just by doing that, there will usually be a couple of colors that don't make the cut. Then with the colors I might be able to play, I lay out all the cards I want to play, look at the cards that are playable but not exciting, and go over the different possibilities in my mind and see what will give me the best balance of power and consistency.  I know that sounds kind of like saying ""just build the deck"" but that's pretty much what it is.  The best thing you can do, though, is play sealed. It's pretty different from draft, and the more you actually play it, the more you can get a feel for what the format plays like."
lrcast,3daz8u,CelestialBeekeeper,3,Wed Jul 15 03:17:44 2015 UTC,"Other point to keep in mind is when drafting, ever card you end up with is one you chose (except for the last card of a pack of course).  Granted, you may have a lot of bad choice options over the 45 picks of a draft, but it should always be possible to come up with at least 23 playables to make a deck out of, especially since you are picking and constructing as you go.  You can keep your curve in mind, and your colors, and removal, and what you've been passing/are getting passed.  It's an active process.    Sealed is a different beast - you can a totally random cardpool and have to cobble together the best deck you can from whatever you open - it's a reactive deck building process.  Yes, sometimes you open great pools where the good decks are obvious, but more often you have to figure out what gives you the best chance even if it involves some risk.  It's also not uncommon to have 2 or even 3 different deck middle of the road options avaible from a single sealed pool; so how to you choose what to run as your main?  I love both limited formats, but it's generally thought that Draft is more skill intensive and less luck based b/c you make so many more choices throughout, but i think often sealed is more skill intensive when it comes to deck building.  Beyond that, also a good video to watch was a Sealed seminar LSV and Ben Stark did for CFB before GP Oakland in 2013. www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjl-7p9gC1w i believe is the link."
lrcast,3daz8u,nerlix,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:56:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the ""sealed is way more luck dependent on draft"" thing is pretty overblown. Sure you can get lucky/unlucky and open a great/terrible pool, but you can also get unlucky with a terrible draft seat where it appears that a color is open but then it suddenly dries up, or where you get into the right colors but pack 3 is terrible, or where you see 1 removal spell the entire draft, etc.  It's a lot easier to find what appear to be the crucial decision points in draft (""I should have taken X over Y on pick Z""), so it feels more skillful; the mistakes that are made when building a sealed pool (and especially when sideboarding (or failing to) between matches) are a lot more subtle and open ended, so it is a lot easier to say ""well, pool was crap, nothing I could do""."
lrcast,3daz8u,cferejohn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:57:53 2015 UTC,"so basically you sort the colours at the beginning, use your knowledge of the format to determine which cards are good and bad. Look at the colours you have and see what the main colour would be (colour with the best cards) then splash the other one?"
lrcast,3daz8u,nerlix,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:35:39 2015 UTC,"Mostly.  Removal is actually higher priority in sealed b/c tt is often worth it to splash a minor 3rd color for bombs (if you can utilize any color fixing -note: there isn't much in Origins).  It's also important to still have a curve so you dont get overrun by an low to the ground deck, but sealed is normally slower than draft b/c you cant  focus on deck synergy as much. And dont be afraid to sideboard heavily once you know what your opponents plan is, even sometimes switching out entire colors if it helps.  As an example, in the prerelease i was BG elves, but in some matches sided to BW so i could play about 5 white fliers (3 aven flock, the 4/4 angel, and griffin) vs a heavy blue fliers deck.  My green only had 2 creatures with reach."

There are going to be lots of broken opening hands in cube, and oftentimes a first turn discard spell is the difference between winning on the spot and losing on the spot.  This deck (3-0, 6 wins 0 losses) has lots of t1 plays but I always chose to make my opponent discard when I had that play available, and it was always right. This play over something more proactive, like, say, play mother of runes t1. My favorite play was taking a mana crypt (on the draw too, he didn't cast it as he didn't want to take unnecessary damage), stopping a t2 Koth which surely would've killed me, and instead, I just won easily because his hand was full of uncastables.  I also stopped a t3 Natural Order in match 2.  1 mana discard spells are waaaaay undervalued IMO. There's a reason why these cards are staples in every format they're legal in."

lrcast,3dbfka,bitterrootmtg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:32:33 2015 UTC,"It's a dicey archetype because you're often looking to wheel your most important cards like Mind's Desire, Brain Freeze, and Tendrils of Agony.   I would say the most important cards to pick up early (aside from obvious ones like power 9) are cantrips (ponder, preordain)  and fast mana (dark ritual, seethign song, mana vault).   There's also the green version of storm which uses a mana enabler (Channel, Fastbond, Heartbeat of Spring, and/or Mirari's Wake) combined with land untappers and wheel effects (Time Spiral, Frantic Search, Turnabout, Memory Jar, Timetwister, Wheel of Fortune)."
lrcast,3dbfka,punninglinguist,2,Wed Jul 15 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"To add to that, you want to wheel the storm cards because you can switch into another archetype with the signets and fast mana if you see someone else in storm. The tutors are also very good in other combo archetypes and they allow you to play only one card with storm.

Every time I've won a draft/sealed it's because I knew my deck and knew my outs. most of my losses these days come from the ""I just can't even, whatever, this creature's best to cast right now."" nights where my brain is just on auto-pilot.

Unlike other cards you draft, double-faced cards are visible to the other drafters. You can't try and hide it. You can put it on your pile of drafted cards front-face or back-face up. External whoops of delight are discouraged, but giggling to yourself internally is cool."
lrcast,3d9l8j,Asturiel,4,Tue Jul 14 16:05:23 2015 UTC,"Even if it's not P1P1, you're not allowed to hide your pick. Picking a double faced card is public information, no matter when you pull it."

Their protocol for DFCs was that when you opened your pack, you help up the DFC for the whole table to see. I open my pack and proceed to hold up my sweet new [[Huntmaster of the Fells]]! There are chuckles around the table, because everyone knows what I'm taking, right?  So I take a look at the rest of the pack, make my pick, and pass the leftovers...that include the Huntmaster. Everyone sees it, and there are a few puzzled looks, but slowly the looks of realization wash over their faces as they realize I must have taken a [[Sorin, Lord of Innistrad]]!  I liked the spot this put me in draft-wise. It meant that my neighbor would certainly take the Huntmaster and go RG, and was clearly going to try and force BW and everyone knew it and stayed out of my way for the draft.  I ended up getting mana screwed one way or another in the match that would have put me in the top 8, but despite not having much success, this is still one of my crazier Magic stories."

lrcast,3d8s7i,JPplaneswalker,8,Tue Jul 14 11:48:54 2015 UTC,"Renown is not linear, renown creatures don't get more powerful just by the virtue of other renown creatures existing in the deck. The creatures with renown just happen to be some of the best creatures in their colors, so the decks in those colors want a lot of them. Renown also isn't really build-around-me mechanic, although there are cards that work well with some of the renown creatures (like the red make-a-thing-unblockable guy).  There will be some renown-based archetypes, but those will work as usual - if the archetype is overdrafted, each of the decks gets weaker."
lrcast,3d8s7i,klaxxxon,2,Tue Jul 14 12:16:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly,  I can't think of any white deck that wouldn't want topan freeblade or Stalwart Aven, regardless of what their strategy is going to be.  But those cards are perfectly fine even if they are the only renown cards you end up taking at all.  I still haven't quite figured the mechanic out yet.  Evasion is where it is at obviously, as if you can get through unblocked it will help trigger renown.  Combat tricks are nice, but it works in such a way that is counter intuitive to other sets... sometimes playing your ""combat trick"" is better before combat in Origins.  For example, mightly leap may be a much better card then I was originally giving it credit for.  If you are stuck in a stalemate setting, you can use it precombat to get over and grow your guy and be a bit more threatening on your next turn.  Then again, in a deck that has more vanilla creatures and less renown, I feel like the value of the card goes down at least a little bit.  It also means cards like the elf that give +2 +2 to a creature when he enters is also better than I thought, A turn two renown creature followed by this means they will often have to either make a horrible 0 for 1 trade or let your topan freblade trigger renown.  Looking through the set there are a lot of cards I feel I need to just try out in draft and see how they do."
lrcast,3d8s7i,Rakyn87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:21:07 2015 UTC,"Playing your tricks pre-combat still isn't good. All it does is give your opponent more information. If they let your guy through once you give it +2/+2 instead of chumping, that just means that they've decided that it's better for them to let your guy get renowned than it is for them to chump (maybe they have a Claustrophobia in hand). In this case, ambushing them with your trick is better for you, because they're much more likely to make the worse play of blocking.  This does change if you have something in your hand they don't know about that specifically rewards your guy getting through, but otherwise casting pumps up front is only good if you're counting on your opponent to make a mistake."
lrcast,3d8s7i,Suedars,2,Tue Jul 14 13:30:49 2015 UTC,"Well, Mighty Leap is a bit of an exception as it might take the decision out of the opponent's hands, but I'd still save it for combat in all but the most specific circumstances. The ability to ""remove"" an opponent's creature with a trick is much more valuable than the reknown counter in most circumstances."
lrcast,3d8s7i,cferejohn,2,Tue Jul 14 13:51:19 2015 UTC,"The biggest exception I can think of is Valeron Wardens, because you also get the card back. It's also conceivable that 2 counters and 4 points of damage is worth it for something like Citadel Castellan, but I agree in general - you're going to use Mighty Leap as a trick (or to do lethal) the vast majority of the time, just like in sets without renown."
lrcast,3d8s7i,WanderingWinder,2,Tue Jul 14 14:04:35 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more like in a situation where I had a Topan Freeblade and you had a 2/2 bear.  If I attack and then Might leap, i don't get the renown trigger because you took that trade in a heartbeat.  However, if I mighty leap and go over the bear and trigger renown, I am left with a 3/3 vigilance and you are left with a 2/2 bear that can no longer trade.  This will not ALWAYS be the right play, but it is wrong to think that it will never be correct."
lrcast,3d8s7i,Rakyn87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Mighty Leap is different because it gives evasion, but for most combat tricks (Titanic Growth) you generally don't want to cast it pre-combat, even with renown."
lrcast,3d8s7i,Suedars,3,Tue Jul 14 20:00:13 2015 UTC,"First, there isn't really a ""renown deck"" since there is very little renown synergy. Renown creatures are just good creatures; they go in any normal limited deck. There is not much payoff for trying to build around renown.  Second, draft is self-correcting. If it turns out that white, green, and red are busted because of renown (or if everyone at your shop thinks these colors are busted), then these colors will be overdrafted while blue and black will be open. If this happens, you can get a better deck by drafting the open colors and by drafting cards that stop ""OP"" renown creatures by killing or blocking them.  My guess is that renown creatures are quite good but not busted to the point that they will warp the colors that people draft. But if the people at your local shop think otherwise, feel free to cut UB and kick their butts."

lrcast,3d8j5c,RiilWonabii,7,Tue Jul 14 09:51:10 2015 UTC,"Here is a quick and dirty set of heuristics I use.  Before the pack is passed to me:  What are the priorities for my deck (i.e. What do I need)?  Do I need more creatures?   Do I need to fill out the bottom or top of my curve?   Am I super-light on removal?   Would I take a clunky removal spell over an above-average creature?   Am I looking for a card that combos well with another card (e.g. Act of Treason and Nantuko Husk)?  Actually looking at the pack:  If the choice is clear (there's an on-color bomb or there's really only one good card for you), then no analysis of what to pick is needed.  If the choice is between 2-3 viable picks (in order of importance):  Should I take a card not in one of my main colors?   Is the good card likely in an open color?  Am I going to get paid off by pivoting into this color?   If I'm moving into a new color, how well does it pair with my current color or colors?  If two picks are comparable in power:  I default to removal before creatures, and creatures before non-creature, non-removal, again assuming power level is comparable.   But this is refined by what I've already drafted and what my deck needs.  If my mana base is poor, prioritize fixing and/or take cards in one of my majority colors.  Which card is best for my deck (i.e. fills a currently underrepresented need)?  Tiebreakers for close picks:  If early, I default to the one which keeps me in a single color or the one that is easier to cast.  If power level is comparable, take the cheaper spell.  Even if a card is more powerful, but I think there's a good chance to wheel it, and it's not crucial, I'll take the less powerful card.  If there is no good pick for my deck:  Do I want to hate draft the best card?   Have I been sending this color downstream and do I care about trying to cement the person next to me in that color? (This matters more in pack 1.   In pack 3, just hate draft away.)  After taking my pick:  What am I shipping downstream?   Have I passed powerful cards in this color (i.e. is this part of a pattern)?   What am I communicating downstream by what I'm passing?"
lrcast,3d8j5c,derelict5432,2,Tue Jul 14 13:14:04 2015 UTC,"Even if a card is more powerful, but I think there's a good chance to wheel it, and it's not crucial, I'll take the less powerful card.   This seems backwards to me, unless I'm misunderstanding the scenario. I'd generally assume that the lower power level card is more likely to wheel than the high power level. Wouldn't you almost always be better off by picking the higher power level card first? Or are you talking about a situation where the powerful card is, for example, multicolored or a build-around card that not a lot of other decks want?"
lrcast,3d8j5c,neofederalist,5,Tue Jul 14 15:26:48 2015 UTC,"I think this shows up more in Cube or Modern Masters than in a regular draft format. Let's say you're solidly in affinity in MM15 and you see a Myr Enforcer and a Sunlance in the pack. Enforcer is more powerful for your deck, but if affinity is open it might wheel, whereas Sunlance almost definitely won't wheel. So you might take the ""weaker"" card for your deck and try to wheel the stronger one."
lrcast,3d8j5c,bitterrootmtg,4,Tue Jul 14 15:56:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, I probably worded it awkwardly, but this is exactly what I meant. A good example from DTK/DTK/FRF might be taking something like a Soul Summons over Harsh Sustenance in pack 3, even though you're BW. I usually tried to wheel Sustenance and was paid off the vast majority of the time."
lrcast,3d8j5c,derelict5432,0,Tue Jul 14 16:41:33 2015 UTC,"I think he's referring more to a place where the more powerful card might, say, unbalance your manabase or your curve.  Like back in DTK/FRF, if I got a pack with [Reach of Shadows] and [Douse in Gloom], but I already had, say, two [Enduring Victory], I'm probably going to take the Douse, because I'm probably not going to play three 5-cost removal spells."
lrcast,3d8j5c,Greyfeld,3,Tue Jul 14 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"I think this is a very good question, and one that I'd like to hear LSV and Marshal answer as well. Personally my process goes something like:  Find the strongest card. If one stands out, and it's in a color that I'm in, or if I'm still open, take it.  If there are 2 or 3 cards that are close in power level such that it's not obvious which is the strongest card, I take a moment and consider the archetypes that the cards fit in, and usually let that guide my decision. Assess the overall strength of the pack. In early picks, this helps you get an idea about what you might wheel, which will give you a good idea of what's open. In later picks, this amounts to you reading what colors are open for you, and helps you get an idea of if you should move into a color. If a pick isn't clear, and you're stuck with a choice between 2-3 medium power cards, consider what your deck already looks like, and which one better fits your current gameplan. This is more helpful later in the draft. For example, if you're drafting Khans, and you're in pack 3 and have the makings of a Jeskai deck and you've already got a ton of prowess creatures, you should probably take the combat trick over the random dude."
lrcast,3d8j5c,neofederalist,2,Tue Jul 14 13:23:02 2015 UTC,"This is interesting to think about. I don't think I have a full routine, but I would suggest that, during the early picks, one should pay attention to the rare first, especially P1P1. With later picks, but not too much later, you can often guess what your opponent took if a common or uncommon is missing and a decent rare is still in the pack."
lrcast,3d8j5c,hawkshaw1024,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:52:03 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on that, but what about keeping track of what you are passing. The amount of removal or other key cards going past?"
lrcast,3d8j5c,hawkshaw1024,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:53:39 2015 UTC,"That's probably good practice. I've heard it said that you shouldn't worry too much about what you're sending downstream, but if you do something like pass back-to-back Epic Confrontations, you may not want to move into Green afterwards. It's probably more important in archetype-heavy draft formats."

lrcast,3d8j5c,brazthemad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:14:10 2015 UTC,"One thing to do is to look at the cards in later picks (p1p3 or so) and try to imagine what was better than what remains. So if two commons are missing, you can safely assume that they were better than the rare and uncommons. With good knowledge of the set, you can then make some good guesses as to what those cards might be, which could give you some insight into what your neighbors are drafting."
lrcast,3d8j5c,Greyfeld,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:58:37 2015 UTC,"The first things I look for when I get a new pack are bombs, then removal.  An obvious bomb gets pulled before anything else, although I like to take a good, long look at what top-tier cards I'm sending down the line so I can determine what colors I might be putting people in, down the line.  For the first pack, I grab the most obviously powerful cards, only hedging on a specific color if two or more cards are the same power, and one of them is a color/archetype that I've already pulled.  In later packs, I do my best to stay on color, unless there's an especially powerful bomb I open that I feel I can easily splash for.  If the only cards in the pack in my colors are cards I'm 90% sure will never make it into my deck, or are so mediocre as to be completely replaceable, I'll take the opportunity to cut an obviously stronger card in another color.  Sometimes, I'll cut a card that hoses my deck, even if there's a playable for me in the pack, but that's usually only if A) the other card completely screws me if I play against it, or B) the playable is kinda average filler."

What colours are open, if it's early, what colours are most powerful so far?  And then, what's the key power/toughness for the format? 3x Khans having a 3 toughness creature was key. Origins 4 seems to be the magic number but I haven't had more than 3 sealed games to test that. I just find it's usually something that everyone over looks, they want the 2/2 with an awesome upside because it's the ""best"" card in the pack.

Tried to get a bit of a token theme going but really only happened when Hero of Bladehold was out and he beasts even by himself.  Felt I had a lot of removal for aggro but liked how I had answers to huge cheated creatures or ramped planeswalkers.

Baneslayer is just such an enormous trump, especially in a creature deck. It can come down after a sweeper or after depleting the opponent's removal and win the game, and as ever, I think threats that can win the game by themselves are very invaluable in cube.

You have douse in gloom highlighter, but I think that's quite substantially weaker.  2 - I'd build it pretty much exactly as you have it. 17 lands is honestly fine, even a little topheavy as you are, and I think 1 scribe / 1 anticipate is an ideal compromise. It'd be one of those you cut for the 18th land, but they can both get you land anyway and have more potential upside.  3 - I wouldn't run black with no splash lands.

More importantly though, how did you end up blue when your blue is mostly mediocre and your three white cards are insanely good?  Cube isn't really my wheelhouse, but I'm sure you shouldn't be three colors without fixing. Tinker I'm not sure about. Is it worth sac-ing a signet and spending a card to get shackles? Maybe not. Mental misstap seems sketch too."
lrcast,3d80u8,rubberducky22,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:25:52 2015 UTC,"I first picked the Exemplars and saw nothing else that pack, I picked pacifism I think 5th in pack 2 over something mediocre, but there was no other white around. I picked youthful scholar and Palace familiar and stuck with blue as it paired so well with the black."
lrcast,3d80u8,Greyfeld,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:37:36 2015 UTC,"With pacifism and Monastery Mentor in your sideboard, I think it would have been worth prioritizing fixing in the third pack so you could splash for those two cards.  Unfortunately, Exemplars isn't splashable, but those two cards are definitely worth the splash, and do a great job of rounding out your deck."
lrcast,3d80u8,cferejohn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:04:21 2015 UTC,"I'd take the Mistfire Adept in that first one. The biggest weakness I see in that deck is a lack of ways to actually finish games. If you end up in a slow matchup with someone who has some actual bombs you're going to be in trouble. With Updraft Elemental and double Hand of Silumgar, you should be all right against most aggro decks.  I think running the Updraft in the build is fine. I think you need to run both Ojutai Summons because of the lack of finishers. Anticipate doesn't seem great here (though it's never bad) just because you don't have any really exciting cards to dig to - you don't have many bad cards, but you don't really have any great ones either.  I'll be no help in cube draft so I'll let someone else (hopefully) field that one."
lrcast,3d80u8,Greyfeld,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:08:18 2015 UTC,"While I see what people are talking about with the Mistfire Adept, I can definitely understand your pick with the Douse.  Your removal suite is exceptionally weak at this point, and half your card draw is wrapped up in exploit (with no Jeskai Sages or Sultai Emissaries to make up for the disadvantage of having to nuke your own creatures off the board).  That said, Douse is just more early game removal.  It's what you want when you need something to fill out your early curve to get to the endgame.  Since your early drops are already well filled-out, I think Mistfire Adept is probably the right choice."

There is a lot of pseudo-evasion (first strike, menace, damage dealt to blockers) and rewards for getting through (renown) in the color pair that makes your creatures more relevant after they might otherwise stall out in previous sets.  Spot removal on the things your pseudo-evasive guys can't handle can make things very tough for your opponent.  Haven't gotten to draft much yet, but I fear a somewhat fast environment."

lrcast,3d60g9,AlphaRhobot,9,Mon Jul 13 20:13:11 2015 UTC,"I would take the walker. I feel like it's the better card overall. It's relevant on turns 2-6, it provides inevitability, it's more resilient to removal, and it's colorless."
lrcast,3d60g9,wetwilly92,2,Mon Jul 13 20:21:55 2015 UTC,"Is it really more resilient to removal?  If they hit it with Supression Bonds or Claustrophobia, it never dies and they just ignore it.  That's the most common removal spell out of 2 colors.  Sentinel can't just be Supressed or Claustrophobed.  She still taps down your stuff.  The only common removal spells that really handle it effectively are Unholy Hunger and Wild Instincts - the second of which requires you to have a 4/3 or better, and not get blown out in response.  Also not a big fan of how long hangarback takes to get going.  Sentinel impacts the board IMMEDIATELY, rather than being a 4 mana 2/2 the turn you play it.  It's great on turn 2, but pretty mediocre as a 4 drop or 6 drop unless you're not behind.  Both are certainly great, though.  I think I take the colored card because I want to be white anyway."

Sentinel impacts the board IMMEDIATELY, rather than being a 4 mana 2/2 the turn you play it. It's great on turn 2, but pretty mediocre as a 4 drop or 6 drop unless you're not behind.   I would disagree here, having a 2/2 or a 3/3 that splits into thopters is wonderful when you're behind. It's not as good as the sentinel if you're about to die, certainly and I think that's a large part of what the sentinel has going for it. The walker is a little bit weaker when you're behind, but a bit better at parity.   I mean, all of these comparisons are marginal, what really separates these two cards is ""do you want to commit to playing white in your deck when you don't have to"". For some drafters it's going to be 'yes', for me it happens to be 'not really'.  Like it's not a big enough gap in power level (I would personally evaluate both of these cards closely)."
lrcast,3d60g9,wetwilly92,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:46:00 2015 UTC,"The fact that you can stay open on your first pick is exactly why I chose Hangarback over Sentinel.  I even got to play with her during the pre-release, and she was amazing, but having a great playable that can go into any deck, no matter which color you end up in, is very, very good.  Not to mention that it plays well in both green ramp and UR artifacts."
lrcast,3d60g9,Greyfeld,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:14:27 2015 UTC,"I agree on taking the walker. I feel that the sentinel is only somewhat stronger, but you are only likely to end up running it about half the time if you don't force white.  I would rather take the slightly less powerful but completely flexible walker which allows me to stay open and take the best card in the next pack regardless of color."
lrcast,3d60g9,dumac,9,Tue Jul 14 01:42:31 2015 UTC,"Dont really think you would be wrong to take either, but if this is P1P1 the Hangarback gives you more flexibility since you can run it in any color deck.  If you pass the Sentinel you know the person you are passing to is going to be looking to take heavy white and white appears popular enough that several players are going to be fighting over it anyway.  Course, the Sentinel is easily splashable too...  Tough call.  I think i'd go with the Sentinel after watching it in action - the thopter decks i saw this weekend didn't have enough push to get there."

lrcast,3d60g9,nerlix,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:37:54 2015 UTC,"And red has more than enough spot removal to deal with those threats, plus whatever bounce/removal you get when you go blue.  It's not like you're just dealing with the board as a bubble."
lrcast,3d60g9,Greyfeld,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:47:04 2015 UTC,"Oh i understand that, im just pointing out that there's a lot of incidental thopter hate without people trying to warp their decks specifically to combat them.  Plus, i would be quite happy to have an opponent waste removal on my spiders, imps, giests, and avens rather that target my higher quality cards anyway. The thopters themselves don't appear to be great at racing b/c they are just 1/1s.  Eh, time will tell how easy/diffcult it turns out to be to be successful with RU thopters.dec with or without Hangarback"
lrcast,3d60g9,nerlix,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:43:54 2015 UTC,"These thopter decks often come with other synergies, usually artifact synergies of some sort.  It's usually not just a bunch of 1/1 pingers annoying you.  Chief of the Foundry makes the deck especially disgusting."
lrcast,3d60g9,Greyfeld,15,Tue Jul 14 21:11:51 2015 UTC,"The sentinel for sure.  Staying open has its value, but the power level on the sentinel is so much higher than the hangerback.    Im not totally convinced that the hangarback is a good card, but sentinel will turn around losing games, close out winning games, and break board stalls.  Man that card is too good for uncommon..."
lrcast,3d60g9,EthanolTrousers,10,Mon Jul 13 20:21:58 2015 UTC,"Hangerback has so many advantages in terms of a draft card. It goes in a control deck as a great defensive card. It is also amazing at early defense trading on turn 2 with a 2/1 and making a flyer. It goes in an aggro deck as an alternate win condition if your initial beatdown plan doesn't work. It's also great because you can easily slot in cheaper plays into your curve around the one mana installments. And of course it's great in any deck in between. Not only that but it fits into any curve perfectly. If you have a better 2 drop that's renown and needs to get in early, go for it! This will still be a great play on t4 or 6.  If you don't have a t3 play, upticking it is a reasonable use of a turn after playing on t1. Finally it's colorless so it really will be a one of the best cards in any deck that you will draft.  Sentinel is a 6 drop meaning you won't be able to play it in all decks. It also means it won't be available to you in a portion of games where you don't draw six lands. Fortunately, the card is so good that if you can even get it down on 6 after being in a losing position you are immediately transformed into a stalled board. The card is better in a control deck that can keep the board stable until six but is still good in an aggro deck. In my mind, the deckbuilding cost of having a high drop & a card in a specific color makes me more inclined to go with the walker.  That being said there is a short list of cards I would take over sentinel and wouldn't fault anyone for opting that way."
lrcast,3d60g9,IzDaisho,3,Mon Jul 13 22:00:10 2015 UTC,"Slightly off topic from Hangarback v Sentinel, but what would your deck have to look like for you to not play the Sentinel?  I hear people say not every deck wants a six drop, but I can't picture drafting an aggro deck so low to the ground that I wouldn't put the Sentinel in as a reach card for the potential late game.    Is it a question of how many 2s and 3s before you make the decision ""this deck doesn't want 6 drops""?"
lrcast,3d60g9,EthanolTrousers,6,Mon Jul 13 22:36:16 2015 UTC,"There are certainly hyper aggro decks whose curve stops at 4, but those are rare enough that they aren't worth discussing.  Sentinel will always make your white deck, but it still has deck building implications. Basically no deck wants more than a couple of six drops. In fact, your five drop + 6 drop number probably wants to be below 6 or 7 in most decks. That means that the next time we see a 6 drop that is good in our deck we can take it, but the one after? Starts to get dicey.   Essentially, cheaper cards will be more numerous in the deck so we are happier to start filling those out first.   Now that I think about it I am curious about the ratio of playable 5/6 drops to playable 2/3 drops and comparing that to the normal ratio of 2/3 drops we want to play. If there was 1 playable 6 drop in the format and all decks want a 6 drop (neither are really true, just a hypothetical), then we would always slam the six drop. I wonder if there is anyone doing this type of analysis and if it can be used to determine the value of each card.  Anyway, that was a tangent, but generally a deck doesn't need 6 drops but needs 2 drops to win. So taking sixes restricts your ability to take other powerful sixes later."
lrcast,3d60g9,IzDaisho,2,Mon Jul 13 23:07:04 2015 UTC,I think any person suggesting to cut a bomb even if it costs 6 mana from a limited deck doesn't fully understand deck building.  I find it hard to believe that a 17 land deck will ever have a 23rd card better than this card no matter how aggressive that player wants their deck to be. Most limited games result in a board stall. An evasive threat or bomb like Sentinel breaks the game wide open. Sentinel is a card you always run if you are white and would even splash for if you somehow get two land fixers.
lrcast,3d60g9,phasmy,2,Mon Jul 13 23:42:07 2015 UTC,"You're misunderstanding what people are saying. No one is saying that they wouldn't jam Sentinel into their decks other than in incredibly unlikely situations. What they are saying is that no matter how good a 6 drop is, it's still more replaceable in the grand scheme of things than a early creature is."

lrcast,3d60g9,5-s,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:20:51 2015 UTC,"I agree that there are decks that don't want most 6 drops, but I can't think of a recent format where I would't run this 6 drop in any given deck that could cast it. OK, maybe some degenerate triple-BNG nonsense.   Edit: Also, any deck that wouldn't want this probably doesn't want the Hangerback either."
lrcast,3d60g9,cferejohn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:28:26 2015 UTC,"I think if you draft this, you play it regardless of whether you're playing a deck that ""doesnt want 6 drops""  Even aggro decks want backup plans if they're this powerful.  It might be your only 6 drop, but it's worthwhile if you get one."
lrcast,3d60g9,sylverfyre,2,Tue Jul 14 03:55:35 2015 UTC,"You may be right about Sentinel being the correct pick, but you're dead wrong if you doubt Hangerback is a good card. It's worst is a solid playable in a 1/1 and its best is so much higher. Use quadrant theory, it's great in every stage of the game."
lrcast,3d60g9,OppoDump,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:55:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think color is the issue. I'd splash Sentinel anyways and in fact I think a base white deck is the least likely color to want it (WB possibly).  The issue is taking a 6 drop first pick when we could take a similarly-tiered card that's a variable 2-8 drop, guaranteed to be great in every strategy we run (and you should be convinced hangarback is a good card).  We can wheel one of these grindy black cards though, so that should be a point towards Sentinel."
lrcast,3d60g9,bearrosaurus,3,Mon Jul 13 22:32:49 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting pick that boils down to a simpler question: ""Is Sentinel of the Eternal Watch merely 'very good' or is it completely busted?""  P1P1 I think you take Hangarback Walker over just about every card that isn't busted. Chronomaton was awesome, and Walker is even better. It's good at every stage of the game, it fights removal, it keeps your colors open.  But, like others, I've seen a ton of power out of the Sentinel. It turns around games in a big way. Is the power level of Sentinel high enough to justify taking a more expensive and more color-committing card?   I don't know. I think we'll know in a week or two when we have more experience playing these cards. If I had to guess I'd say the power level is high enough on Sentinel to warrant taking it, but I'm not sure."
lrcast,3d60g9,bitterrootmtg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:19:25 2015 UTC,I think Sentinel might just be good enough to edge it out. Losing is the most important quadrant and Sentinel excels there with flying colors. Also the fact that it's easily splashable means it at least comes close to leaving you as open as a P1P1 Hangarback Walker
lrcast,3d60g9,gregariousbarbarian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:17:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think this set is as prone to splashing as the last was.  We still have Evolving Wilds, but the dual lands are all rares, and there aren't any other mana fixers in the set.  Upsetting your color base by inserting a handful of lands of a third color is generally a bad idea."
lrcast,3d60g9,Greyfeld,3,Tue Jul 14 16:23:53 2015 UTC,"Think I'd lean towards Hangarback? It's very good. So is the Sentinel for sure, but I think it's close enough that you should favor the colorless card."

lrcast,3d60g9,Nizzahon,3,Mon Jul 13 21:10:30 2015 UTC,Sentinel. Just stronger on it's own and white is a color you want to be in anyway.
lrcast,3d60g9,CptFizz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:21:33 2015 UTC,"I would take the sentinel. I haven't played this set yet and I thought about it for awhile, but taking the sentinel completes cuts white from your pack and discourages anyone to your left from moving in.  You're not married to your first pick so you are as open as you want to be. While the walker is probably good in the right deck, the sentinel is like a claustrophobia and creature in one.  So yea, I'd take the sentinel for that value."
lrcast,3d60g9,LancesAKing,3,Mon Jul 13 21:20:10 2015 UTC,It's much more important to read signals than it is to try to cut a color pack 1. The person to your right will be passing to you twice and you can't control what color he will move into pack 1.
lrcast,3d60g9,phasmy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:24:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but if this is a super close pick (and I think it is), the fact that you get to pass actual 0 white cards could be a tie breaker (though on that note I'm not sure what was used to sim this pack but I think real packs will always have at least 1 common of each color(?))."
lrcast,3d60g9,cferejohn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:20:58 2015 UTC,"Eh, even if there were other good white cards in this pack, the guy to the left isn't picking them.  He's taking the Walker."

Also even if I knew I was white I think i'd rather have hangarback: this set feels quite fast, chronomaton with insane upside is great, and I really want to limit my number of expensive spells in my deck."
lrcast,3d60g9,kuaggie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:07:18 2015 UTC,"Really close. I think I take the Hangerback because it's so good to drop at any point (well any even point) on your curve whereas a 6 drop is (duh) only good at 6.   If I knew I was going to drop the thing on 6 then yeah, I'd take the Sentinel (though it's not like a 3/3 you can permanently pump at instant speed and turns into 3 1/1 flyers when it dies is a terrible deal), but hangerback is (obviously) better on 2 or 4 and probably is better if you flood to 8 or 10 as well.  If I can coffeehouse a bit more, a point in Sentinel's favor is that neither Claustrophobia or Suppression Bonds turn off the ability, and those are two of the primary ways opponent might deal with a 4/6."
lrcast,3d60g9,cferejohn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:24:07 2015 UTC,I would take walker even if I was solidly white. I don't even think it's close P1/P1.

lrcast,3d3brc,taptapuntap,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:47:22 2015 UTC,"Favourite play of the weekend was my opponent with a big fatty and two thopters thinking he was playing around celestial flare with my 6 open mana, flash in Thunderclap Wyvern, eat both thopters by blocking 1 with the wyvern and the other with my now 2/2 thopter then killing the fatty after damage.  Second favourite celestial flare play was with a GB pool playing against BW and suiciding one of my two elvish visionaries to make sure that my 6/6 vigilant reach spider couldn't be flared by my opponent.  Least favourite play was actually sitting right beside Marshall (he was at my pre-release in Victoria BC) when somehow I forgot about the +1/+1 counter on my opponent's renowned first striker so I blocked with a 2/2 and 3/3 hoping to trade. Without that misplay I might have actually been able to meet up with Marshall in the final round."

Obviously I ended up playing blue. Fortunately I correctly guessed that Marshall and LSV would give tower geist a high grade and played 2 of them along with an awesome suite of removal spells and some moderately efficient fliers. I went 4-1, only losing to Gideon's Phalanx. Twice I dispersed my own tower geist in response to a removal spell and then replayed it. It felt great. :)"

I greatly enjoy limited and Prerelease gives me a good environment to play in it.  Did 2 prereleases, picked and played White both times with Red. Went 2-2 and 4-0 with 4x Dragon Fodder, 2x Hixis, Sentinel and Chandra's Ignition.   Brief story: Only huge play mistake was misunderstanding how Hixis worked and casting him after the damage step...I kind of thought my opponent would let me take it back since it wasn't competitive REL. When he later cast Chandra's Ignition targeting his guy, he clearly didn't realize it would wipe both our boards. I let him take it back...and he's a judge!  Level Up! I think the thing I've learned from listening was mostly about having a plan. My friend is a Pro level player and he says I play around too much and overthink, so I found it really helpful to have a plan instead of trying to think of everything.  Final thoughts? Molten Vortex is very strong and Chandra is not so much. Also: It's the remix to Ignition...hot and fresh out the kitchen #allnight"

My 'sick play' of the tournament was swift reckoning (with spell mastery) on my own tapped creature in response to my opponent casting a lethal ravaging blaze on that creature.

A friend, who I introduced to the game way back then, reintroduced me by doing some casual 4 man drafts. He linked me to the podcast and I've been listening to a lot of the older episodes.  I went with him to prerelease this weekend. I had every intention on going WX after listening to the set review but the LGS only had Green, Red and Blue boxes left by the time we showed up for the event. I went Green but ended up running a UB deck with a ton of Flyers and some nice control cards. After all was said and done I ended up going 3-0-1!

At one point I [[Fiery Impulse]]'ed a 4 toughness creature just to enable spell mastery.  I added two [[Alchemist's Vial]] because I remembered LSV mentioning that it might be a good option if there weren't many 2-drops.  He was right! They played very well as a curve filler in my deck which had no other 2 drops.  I might have overlooked this card had I not listened to the set review.

Add some 2/3 zombies and 1/4 spiders, graveyard recursion and off it went.  Got several 4 for 1's with Massacre, and even a 6 for 1 against a thopter UR deck.  One sided board wipes seem good.

Went green for my color, and dear lord was my green great (Foil Nissa anyone?). I ended up going UG tempo. Though my pool had a lot of good white renown synergies and great high end in white, it was seriously lacking in removal (i.e. my pool had virtually none). Recognized that my blue, while not as synergistic, had lots of decent evasive creature and some bounce for removal. Also saw that while my green was amazing, it was definitely not shaping up to be aggressive, which the GW would of wanted. While I was missing out on some really sweet GW synergies, I recognized the weaknesses deck was going to have and blue would better address them, and my deck was better off for it.  The deck was SUPER grindy (all but one of my rounds went to time) My only loss was to a guy with an amazing GB deck that was even grind-ier than mine (2X [[Graveblade Marauder]] getting recurred with Liliana are some TOUGH beats).

lrcast,3d3brc,scl52,2,Mon Jul 13 17:06:01 2015 UTC,"One small point: Toward the end of that discussion, Marshall noted that Celestial Flare took a knock because, if you suspect it, you can always just jam in with your big creature and a worthless durdle, so that you can sac the durdle if your opponent has Flare. But, precisely because of the end of combat step interaction that LSV noted, that actually doesn't usually work, b/c typically your opponent could block and kill your durdle, and then get your big guy at the end of combat step.

The thing you want to focus on in the set review is trying to listen to their discussion, and understand why they're giving each card the rating they do. The actual score isn't that important; what's important is understanding why they think a card is good or bad. Listen to a few set reviews and you'll start being able to predict their scores reasonably well, and more importantly start to realise why each card is where it is.  And yes, the draft format will be triple Origins :)"
lrcast,3d450z,SirChuffly,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:20:12 2015 UTC,I second this. The ratings in a vacuum don't matter as much as understanding the rationale behind the ratings.  One thing I did with this set was to look at the cards and try to rate them before reading or listening to any set reviews. Then I went back and compared my ratings with LSV and Marshall to see how close I was. I paid special attention to cards where there was a large discrepancy between their rating and my rating and tried to figure out why. I feel like this helped immensely at the prerelease because it helped reinforce everything that was discussed during the set review and it's something I plan to do with each set from now on. I don't want to have to be spoon-fed the information; my goal is to be able to evaluate the cards on my own and use other resources to supplement my own understanding and to help catch things I may have overlooked.
lrcast,3d450z,johnts03,3,Mon Jul 13 12:56:32 2015 UTC,"Hi!  Maybe I can give a little help here. Of course, listening to the set review is a really great first step towards mastering a set.  However, when a new a set comes out, I view it as an investment. Magic Origins prerelease came out this weekend and I'm goign to be spending the next 2.5 months drafting it. I'm going to spend the next 2.5 months playing Magic Origins sealed at premiere level events.  Because of this, I have no problem dedicating a large amount of time to prepping for the prerelease. Partly so I get a huge leg up on the competition, but also because I think it's fun :). Here's some things I do that I would suggest you do if you want to be serious about taking your game to the next level:   Rate every card before the Set Review show. - This makes you think about the card on your own. It makes you come to a decision, and it helps you think more critically during the set review show. (Oh, I gave this card a D, but LSV/Marsh gave it a B-. I guess I missed something here.) At first you'll have pretty disparate ratings, but eventually you'll find you're only off by half a letter grade on most of the cards. Get some friends to rate every card before the set review show with you. It sounds like your brother plays, so while you're cultivating your friend group, it seems like he'd be a really great resource to use. Throw your grades in an excel spreadsheet and then compare notes. See where you're ratings are different and then argue it out! I spend a ton of time chatting with /u/oraymw and /u/asturiel before the set review show even is released. Thanks google hangouts! I take the colors and order all of the commons (and doing the uncommons is a good practice as well). This is a really good tool for getting you to think critically about the commons, start to grok them in your head, and get a sense of how ""deep"" a color is. If you know what the best common and uncommon in each color is, it really simplifies the process of determining what colors to play when you open your sealed pool. After and at the prerelease talk it over with other people. Is there a ringer at your store? Did you lose to them R1? Ask them if they have any tips on your deck, and don't argue with them! Feel free to disagree, but disagree in your head (at least at the start). You can also post your deck to the reddit, but I would suggest easy-to-read pictures (or throw it into MTGO) rather than a wall of text.   These are the processes I use, I really hope they help you and let me know if something didn't make sense!"

lrcast,3d450z,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,2,Mon Jul 13 14:50:24 2015 UTC,"What he's saying is to try and find the best commons and uncommons in each color, and put them in order from best to only good.  LSV does this in his set review column on Channel Fireball, so you can check that for a good example. The reason you do this is to see a few things, first off, you want to see the overall power of a color.  Sometimes the best commons in one color are just worse the the average commons in another.  You also want to see what the best creatures and removal spells look like, so that you can look for them in your sealed pool, and so that you can play around your opponent having them. And don't forget:  limited is a lot harder than constructed.  Sealed especially.  It took me a long time to get good at draft, and I'm still only decent at sealed.  It takes awhile sometimes, but you'll get there!"

lrcast,3d450z,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:13:26 2015 UTC,"The easiest way is to count up all your mana symbols, then use roughly the same ratio between them for your lands. For example if you have 18 white symbols and 16 red, you might want to play 9 plains and 8 mountains. It does depend a little bit on when you need the mana though - in the same example if I had a card I wanted to play early that had RR in the casting cost, I might play 8 plains and 9 mountains instead."

lrcast,3d450z,neofederalist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:25:21 2015 UTC,"Draft will be 3x Origins.   It sounds like you're on the right track to better card evaluation. The next step is to think a little deeper about the cards where your rating vastly differs from Marshall & LSV's ratings. What did you overlook? Did you think about the card in all quadrants? Were you just considering the card's best case scenario, or thinking about what might happen in the worst and average case too?  Good card evaluation is only one aspect of becoming a better limited player. Making good plays is very important too. That mostly comes with practice, and sounds like you have someone to practice with - maybe play your prerelease deck against your brother's a few times and ask him to point out any mistakes you might be making.   And, as always, have a plan! Know what your deck is trying to do.  Spend some time at the beginning of each turn figuring out what you're going to do that turn and how your opponent's possible choices might affect that. Think about what your opponent's plan could be, and see if you can prevent them from doing it while also advancing your own plan.  I've found it very helpful to keep a Magic notebook. I write down bullet points of ideas from LR shows and articles I read, even discussions on this subreddit! I also keep it handy when watching coverage of pro events - writing down interesting lines of play or niche uses of cards."

Instead of trying to memorize scores, learn the concepts that Marshall and LSV are using to reach their scores. If you have time, go back and listen to some of the ""Useful Shows to Hear"" and make sure you understand the general concepts:  Avoiding BCSM  Don't be Rotty  Quadrant Theory  Have a Plan"
lrcast,3d450z,CelticStag,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:26:55 2015 UTC,"First of all, don't get discouraged. Magic is a hard game, and limited magic adds even more variables (drafting/deck building). I like to think of the LR podcast like having a coach or personal trainer. You're not going to immediately show drastic improvement in your gameplay just like you won't immediately drop 5 strokes after taking a few golf lessons.   Don't fret the specifics, but take in the large themes and try to understand the rationale behind what they're saying. It looks like you struggle at card evaluation, and one thing that Marshal and LSV do really well is explain what makes a card good and bad. Over time, you'll be able to apply the same principles on your own to different cards.   You said that you try to ""guess the rating of each card but I always get it wrong."" I think your word choice is actually very telling here. First of all, the card ""rating"" is not a hard number, and shouldn't be treated as such. Nothing exists in a vacuum, and once you make your first pick in a draft, the relative values of a card for your deck starts changing. Second of all, even though the LR guys are very good magic players, their ratings are not perfect. They do make mistakes (the sunset shows for every set talks a lot about which cards they overvalued or undervalued initially). So you shouldn't just be trying to be like them. What you should be doing is rather than guessing the rating is looking at the card, and creating your own rating for it. Then if your rating differs from LSV or Marshal's, listen to their explanation and see why that is the case. It's about honing your decision making and thought processes, not just arriving at the same result as the other guys."
lrcast,3d450z,CelticStag,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:53:36 2015 UTC,thank you to everyone!!. I understand that i need to practice more so i think i should just listen to it a couple times along with the other one's people suggest. i played black bluer at pre release and i didnt even watch the pre release. I think i should just keep on drafting but im really bad at picking lands. i had 12 blue cards and 11 black  with alot of double blues so i went 10 7. Do you have any tips on deck construction?? Again you guys have been very helpful!

lrcast,3d3z0b,cferejohn,2,Mon Jul 13 11:35:56 2015 UTC,"Flameshadow is powerful, but it's not very good here - making an extra 2/1 just isn't impactful enough. You might end up getting some extra thopters off of it, but I think I'd want a couple more creatures that put them into play."
lrcast,3d3z0b,5-s,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:22:50 2015 UTC,"Trying to get cute is exactly why decks like this can fail. You had a VERY good rw aggro deck, one that resembles a draft pool. Not sure why you need more lategame power with such a strong curve. This pool can easily x-0 or x-1 a prerelease."
lrcast,3d3z0b,cferejohn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:19:06 2015 UTC,"I ended up going X-2 but at least one match loss was due to a blatant error on my part, so that's on me. I don't really like playing aggro in Sealed if I don't have to - or if I have to, I at least want to run all fliers - but the more I think about it, the more I feel I'll just have to accept that, heh."
lrcast,3d3z0b,sylverfyre,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:11:10 2015 UTC,I'd want Chief of the Foundry in here with 4 ways to get thopters in play. I'd almost certainly run it over Chandra.
lrcast,3d3z0b,cferejohn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:20:51 2015 UTC,"Chandra is very very good in limited.  You flip her by casting 2 red spells and she just burns out your opponent.  Or, if you're not at parity, she can zap down some creatures.  Chief of the Foundry is also already in the suggested deck."
lrcast,3d3z0b,sylverfyre,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"So it's a 3 mana, double red 2/2 - bad. The ability on the creature is not very good since it doesn't hit creatures.  To flip her she has to do 3 damage which means either:   You have to cast a red spell and she's able to get in as a 2/2 on turn 4 or later - not likely unless opponent is stumbling on mana (in which case probably any given 3 drop is just about as good). The dream (other than 'opponent does nothing on turns 1-4') is that on 4 you have a red removal spell (of which there is precisely 1 at common) AND it removes their only blocker with 2 power or better. And all that assumes you can play her on 3. or you have to cast 2 red spells in a turn, which you're doing on what, turn 8? Or you're not curving out in early turns just so you can wait around to fire off two cheap red spells later? That seems horrendous in limited, and especially bad in an aggro deck.   Once she's flipped, sure, that's a pretty nice ability. You'll probably be able to take out a smaller creature and ping opponent a bit.   In a limited controlish deck would I pay 4 mana for that planeswalker straight up? Sure. But the fact that I have to jump through hoops to get there doesn't really make me optimistic it's going to be good other than in situations where literally any 3-drop creature would be just as good or better."
lrcast,3d3z0b,cferejohn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:42:56 2015 UTC,What are we adding if we cut chandra?  We're already playing the guy you suggested to cut her for.  I think fiery conclusion is the first thing I cut from this particular build anyway.
lrcast,3d3z0b,sylverfyre,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:51:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, whoops. I'm blind. I somehow managed to miss Chief in that list. Yeah, OK, I can see leaving Chandra is, but I do think she's not great (e.g. I'd take the 2/1 that makes a Thopter over her pretty much every time)."
lrcast,3d3z0b,rob_bot13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:00:58 2015 UTC,"I think I cut Fiery Conclusion for at least one of the Subterranean Scouts.  Conclusion isn't a very good removal spell and we aren't really hurting for removal, and the Scout is a decent body that also pushes through a renown dude."
lrcast,3d3z0b,rob_bot13,2,Tue Jul 14 17:39:30 2015 UTC,"OK so you are playing red because your pool is great there, so what is the best color to pair with it? I think it is white or green.  White gives you the celestial flares, supression bonds, and the topan free blades plus the 7 drop that makes soldiers, whereas green gives you zendikar incarnate plus joraga invocation wild instincts and might of the masses which plays really well with the token generation in red.  There is a lot of double white if that was the direction and ultimately that pushed me towards red green.  Here is the list I made:  1x Akroan Sergeant  1x Boggart brute  1x Chandra  1x dragon fodder  1x Fiery conclusion  1x Flame shadow conjuring (awesome combo with the token generators)  2x ghirapur gearcrafter  1x lightning javelin  1x mage ring bully  1x ravaging blaze  1x seismic elemental  1x thopter engineer  1x chief of the foundry  1x bonded construct  1x throwing knife  1x war horn  1x joraga invocation  1x zendikar incarnate  1x wild instincts  1x might of the masses  2x honored hierarch (these might need to be yeva's forcemages I have no feel for whether this card is good in the format)  1x foundry of the consuls  9x mountain  7x forest"
lrcast,3d3z0b,escplan9,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:50:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was basically R/G or R/W I was torn between. I'm not a fan of the Hierarch at all, and Forcemage has excellent synergy with Flameshadow, so if I'm running the latter I'm probably running the former. I feel this built has better late game (Zendikar Incarnate is real, as is Joraga Invocation) but a worse curve and a little too much cuteness (Flameshadow)."
lrcast,3d3z0b,sylverfyre,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:04:00 2015 UTC,"The curve shouldn't be too much worse and your mana is a lot better though. I had good experiences with Flameshadow conjuring this weekend as it works amazingly well with any of the dudes that generate tokens but is also fine with the chief of the foundry brute, and other beaters.  It is probably correct to run it.  As far as the hierarchs vs. forcemages, you are probably correct."
lrcast,3d3z0b,Sceptilesolar,2,Mon Jul 13 16:29:57 2015 UTC,"WRfor sure. Not following how you were lost here. You have 3 thopter generating creatures in red as well, so some of the decent artifacts like the Chief for sure, and maybe Guardian Automaton and Throwing Knife even. White you have Flares, Suppresion Bond, Topans, Gideon's Phalanx... not even close you play WR here"
lrcast,3d3z0b,Athio,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:51:32 2015 UTC,"This pool felt a little unfocussed to me. There's like parts of three different decent decks in there, but no really good ones. I had Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh in my seeded pack but she turned out to be exactly as bad as I expected her to be (what with her being an overcosted Goblin Fireslinger)."
lrcast,3d420c,SirChuffly,5,Mon Jul 13 10:25:17 2015 UTC,"I was actually overly impressed with all of them. In one prerelease, I played an Esper control deck with a Jace and a Kytheon. In another prerelease, I played UB control with Liliana. I played against a Nissa twice and I played against a Chandra once. My thoughts on the ones I had in my decks:  JACE: When I first read Jace, I thought he seemed VERY underpowered. Playing with him though, I actually found him surprisingly strong. A looter for 2-CMC is already great, he flips very easily (probably the easiest of all of them), and getting to flashback a removal spell or a Read the Bones puts your very far ahead. But I think the reason he plays better than I expected was that his -2/-0 ability actually did a lot more than I thought it would -- most of the creatures in this set seem to be relatively small, so I found that shrinking my opponent's biggest creature tended to take away any profitable attacks they may have had.  KYTHEON/GIDEON: Kytheon impressed me too -- mainly because of the indestructible ability. Undercity Troll (the green 2/2 for 2-CMC with Renown-1 and regenerate for 3-CMC) really impressed me for all the reasons LSV and Marshall talk about in the set review, and Kytheon as a 2/1 with a 3-mana indestructible activation feels really similar. He attacks really well with threat of activation, but he actually blocks really well too. Flipping him was a little tougher than I had hoped -- a lot of times you're forced to chump attack one of your creatures -- but the payoff is great. I think you probably want to pair Kytheon with thopter makers so you have expendable bodies? Once he flips, Gideon's ability to make one of your other creatures indestructible for a turn proved really useful, and obviously once you start beating with an indestructible 4/4 every turn, it becomes hard for the opponent to keep up with. I rarely used the lure ability, except once when I needed a blocker out of the way to make a lethal attack. Verdict: Gideon seems about as good as I expected, but the Kytheon side was better than I expected.  LILIANA: Of all of these, I think Liliana seemed to have the most raw power, but she was also kind of tough to flip. Without any Fleshbag Marauders in my pool, it became tough to purposefully have my creatures trade or die without losing too much value. But when I did get Liliana to flip, she completely took over the game. Paired with Deadbridge Shaman, I would often strip my opponent's entire hand within a couple turns. I went ultimate with Lili in one game, and it felt really unfair. I think she may be the strongest of all 5 walkers, as long as you can flip her consistently."
lrcast,3d420c,mrcjtm,2,Mon Jul 13 14:32:16 2015 UTC,"Nissa let me down a little hard. I was playing GR with 9 Forest and 6 mountains (please two non basic), and most of the time she went down, it would have been much nicer to be able to ramp an extra mountain instead of being constrained to forests. I know the flavor reasons behind this (she only learned to tap into all the different lands after becoming a planeswalker) but this was disappointing.  When she went down most people just killed her with reave soul. One opponent was silly enough to Suppression Bonds her, and when she flipped he kicked himself, but I found she never flipped before turn 7-9. There's an ok amount of ramp, but so little of that ramp puts the mana on the field. Nissa'a Pilgramage and Animist's awakening under performed just as much, and I avoided them as they just couldn't put the work in.   If Nissa flipped I typically made a 4/4 immediately, as few opponents would let her live much longer than that.   I saw a Jace under perform as well. Opponent was so far behind he kept using -2/-0 despite having 13 counters on Jace because the ultimate just wasn't worth it and he was doing everything he could to win combat.  Kytheon was okay, I faced him twice (different opponents). The first one beat me down hard, and then only because he curved out beautifully with kytheon on turn on and drew beautifully, and even then I was giving him a hard time towards the end. The second time I faced kytheon I was just on too good an offensive, and my opponent using languish, killing his kytheon just to try and stall me.  Didn't see any other planes walkers, but I hear Chandra stole the day, and I ended up trading my Nissa for a Chandra and a Demonic pact for a deck I'm thinking of building"
lrcast,3d420c,CelticStag,2,Mon Jul 13 11:29:14 2015 UTC,"Jace worked well for me, early game as card selection and then once he flipped as flashback for removal. I never got the chance to ultimate him, but I think it would end the game quite quickly in limited. His -2/0 is also good for combat as you mentioned, but unless he's actively a threat he doesn't need to be answered. Best in UB or UR for sure though."
lrcast,3d420c,cagedknight,2,Mon Jul 13 12:59:55 2015 UTC,"There were 11 planeswalkers opened in my prerelease, out of 53 players total. I didn't play with or against any, so can't comment directly, but, based on the tournament results, they didn't seem unbeatable. The highest ranking player with a planeswalker actually pulled 2 Nissas (one foil prerelease, one regular) and placed 3rd, winning on the back of multiple Joraga Invocations. No one else with a planeswalker placed in the top 8."
lrcast,3d420c,kccmtg,2,Mon Jul 13 12:12:18 2015 UTC,Well I think this speaks more to the absurdity of Joraga Invocation than anything else! Cheers for the input.

lrcast,3d420c,kccmtg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:31:54 2015 UTC,"It's just stupid, like Overrun. You either win out of nowhere or you kill everything on your opponent's board and win the next turn, provided you have a few creatures."
lrcast,3d420c,FinancialPanther1,2,Mon Jul 13 22:28:15 2015 UTC,"I had Nissa and Jace* in my GW deck and both were fine, not what you would expect from straight up walkers though. Nissa was great whenever she flipped, basically took over the game as long as she was on a fairly safe board, but this feels like an aggressive limited format and I rarely got to 7 lands. It felt great to have a free loot every turn with Jace but I didn't really want him to flip since the planeswalker is SO low impact, most of the time my opponents didn't really care to kill him.  *I probably shouldn't have splashed Jace in GW but I had an evolving wilds and a Yavimaya Coast in my pool and I was curious to see what he was like. I wouldn't have bothered if it was higher stakes than a prerelease."
lrcast,3d420c,Sceptilesolar,2,Mon Jul 13 12:23:43 2015 UTC,"I found Nissa exceptional. It seems like some people had less success with her, but she was easily the best card in my deck. Well, cards. Since my GU deck was already a bit slow and controlling, I built it around stabilizing early and winning with Nissa late. No ramp needed.  I saw Chandra and she was pretty good but not exceptional. She usually took a little work to flip and she's not incredibly high impact when she does unless you're already really low.  I only saw Liliana once and the deck was pretty sketchy. She seemed fine, hard to judge how good though.  I saw a lot of Kytheon. He was very good, but hard to use perfectly. My experience of him is a little skewed because I only saw him turn 1 or not at all. He's beatable, though. My opponent had a great curve of Kytheon into bear into Gearcrafter, flipped turn 4, and animated and hit me with everything turn 5. He then played a blocker post combat. So I Wild Hunger'd my 2/2, ate his blocker, and then ate Gideon and stabilized.  No Jaces seen. Very little blue overall."
lrcast,3d420c,mrcjtm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:00:22 2015 UTC,Blue was very underplayed IMO. There were so many auras and renown creatures floating around and so little removal that I found bounce to be really profitable. Voidmage and anchor to the aether overperformed for me.
lrcast,3d420c,flooey,2,Mon Jul 13 15:32:24 2015 UTC,"I thought they ranged quite wildly, based on seeing them in action and having a Chandra myself.  Liliana seemed great.  If you have a bunch of creatures with her, you can just swing with everything but her and one blocker.  Your opponent doesn't want to block anything, since it will flip her, and they don't want to attack, since you'll just block and flip her.  It really seems to put the opponent in a bad spot.  Nissa seemed pretty good.  More-restrictive Borderland Ranger is still fine, and if you manage to flip her you're really happy, but she does require the game to go pretty long in order to flip.  On the plus side, if you draw her late you don't have to do anything special, you just cast her and her ability allows you to flip her immediately.  Kytheon/Gideon I didn't see much of, but he seemed to fit solidly into a Wx aggressive strategy.  I never saw him survive to be flipped, though.  Chandra was fine, she generally deals a reasonable amount of damage and then trades for a card.  She gets a bit of the same treatment as Liliana, where she causes your opponent to avoid attacking since they don't want to enable her to flip, which is advantageous.  Her flipped side is just fine, not amazing.  Jace seemed okay.  Looting is great, but his flip side is only fine, causing you to actually not really want to flip him that badly, which is awkward.  Better in a deck with a whole lot of cheap removal, of course."
lrcast,3d420c,flooey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:22:19 2015 UTC,"On the plus side, if you draw her late you don't have to do anything special, you just cast her and her ability allows you to flip her immediately.   You do need to have a land sandbagged to do that, since it's a trigger that only occurs when a land ETBs. It's still nice upside that early game she gives you... not ramp, but an extra land in hand at least. And late she's easy to flip and start getting value from."

I opened a Nissa in another sealed but couldn't justify playing her. What was I ramping into? Rhox?  I played against an opp who had T1 Kytheon twice.

As a looter he was getting good value, but it felt like when he flipped he just turned into nothing very good. There's some gain in looting away a good spell then using the planeswalker version to flashback it, effectively, but it was so slow and clunky that I could mostly ignore it and not feel too disadvantaged.  Gideon did decent work, but was not that much scarier than a decent creature. I killed him once before he could flip (he's pretty prone to just dying, since 3 mana is so much to float..) but the game he did flip he was a moderate sized threat.   Didn't see the others, hence my curiosity!  I suspect that they're cool, and playable, but not actually -that- good on the level of genuine planeswalkers. In some cases not even first pickable?"
lrcast,3d4byt,MrMarlon,4,Mon Jul 13 12:28:30 2015 UTC,You should also take into account that you play agains players with same record as yours. It might not be the deck change that made you win last rounds.

lrcast,3d4byt,natstrap,2,Mon Jul 13 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"A huge part of deck building is how the much synergy your cards have together (this ties in with the ""Having a plan"" episode).  Good cards can get outclassed by strong deck synergy that works towards a specific goal. Perhaps you misjudged this during your deckbuilding process."
lrcast,3d4byt,Wilhelml,2,Mon Jul 13 12:49:48 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Barring curve considerations, card quality > synergy in normal sets (not cube, not modern masters). Good cards don't require anything else but to be cast and resolved. Synergy often requires the cards to be cast in some sort of order and not to be interfered with by things like removal.  Unless you're playing a bunch of highly rated 5 drops and no early plays, just put the best cards in your deck."
lrcast,3d4byt,pahamack,2,Mon Jul 13 16:29:57 2015 UTC,"card quality > synergy in normal sets    This is a much too general statement that seems to suggest that these two are mutually exclusive.   This is format dependent and also dependent on the power level of cards you're playing. In pauper-ish formats having cards that are above average (3.5) vs cards that are average (3.0) but have synergy together can easily (not always) be tipped in favor of synergies. In prince-ish formats it's much less likely, but still possible.   Huge, near unbeatable bombs like Citadel Siege etc. are a different story."
lrcast,3d4byt,Wilhelml,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:59:06 2015 UTC,"Not just that, but also just being in the open colour in draft and taking all the high quality cards. This was especially true in DTK. Lots of people, especially at the beginning of the format where way too enamoured with the synergistic UB deck, and it was possible to exploit that (pun intended) by just being in the open colour, usually green, and slamming all the late pick aerie bowmasters and atarka berserkers. Yes, they could overrun you with card advantage if their engine gets going, but they could also just draw one kind of card and you just kill them because your creatures are bigger/better.  Synergy is great when it comes together but if you had to choose, card quality is more reliable, hence the value of staying open. Lots of people, for example, said ""GB is unplayable"" in DTK, which is ridiculous. If it's open, it's playable, because, just forget synergy, take all the good cards!"
lrcast,3d4byt,pahamack,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:27:29 2015 UTC,I think I mostly misjudged how aggressive the format is and how much damage you or your opponent is able to get in with their 2-drop and Grasp of the Hieromancer before it finally gets removed.
lrcast,3d4byt,Sceptilesolar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:44:21 2015 UTC,"Well, just because your deck included good cards doesn't always make it a good deck, and it certainly doesn't guarantee it will be the best deck available."
lrcast,3d4byt,cagedknight,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:42:29 2015 UTC,"Well some of it is that they are evaluating cards in a vacuum before actually playing with them. The idea isn't that you simply dismiss the cards they say are bad, it's that you think about why they're ""bad"" and when you should include them in your deck despite that. Aggro Red white is (most likely) the deck that wants the grasp of the hieromancer effect because their creatures are generally smaller and they want to be able to get through to trigger their renown.  That said, it is still an aura, and you still do open yourself up to getting 2 for 1'd, however with grasp you're not actually giving up that much if they kill your guy in response, since you're usually putting it on a small guy anyways and it only costs 2. In sets with worse removal, auras are totally fine, though you still have to be careful with them. Origins does not seem like that kind of set, as the removal is good enough to punish you in my experience. Are they still worth the risk sometimes? Absolutely, but that's something that needs to be figured out on a case by case basis and as we play with the set more."
lrcast,3d4byt,bitterrootmtg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:52:44 2015 UTC,"First of all, as you recognize, this type of thinking is very results-oriented. Sometimes variance makes a bad deck outperform a good deck.  Second, building a powerful limited deck is not just about mashing a bunch of high-graded cards together. Other factors matter too: curve, synergies, color requirements.  Third, talking specifically about Grasp of the Hieromancer, this is a great example of a bad card that will win a lot of games. If you resolve Grasp and it goes unanswered, you're much more likely to win that game. If you play grasp and it gets answered right away, you're much more likely to lose. It's similar to deciding the game by coin flip. It's very possible that your wins were due to a few ""lucky flips,"" and that doesn't mean Grasp was correct to play."
lrcast,3d1snf,AEMarling,7,Sun Jul 12 20:48:22 2015 UTC,"This card is really, really good. I even got to cast Necromatic Summons on it with Spell Mastery to make it a 6/8 MUAHAHAHAH"
lrcast,3d1snf,brandenflames,12,Sun Jul 12 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"I am convinced the card is literally Citadel Siege. Seriously, Citadel Siege let you choose between making a really big guy or tapping down their best fit every turn. Sentinel gives you both of those. It is dumb."
lrcast,3d1snf,mowdownjoe,6,Sun Jul 12 22:00:16 2015 UTC,"It is a little easier to kill, but I agree. Not only that, it has vigilance so it can even block.  The fact that it's uncommon is kind of ridiculous."
lrcast,3d1snf,GateOfSteiner,3,Sun Jul 12 22:31:06 2015 UTC,"It's also a 6 drop rather than a 4 drop and doesn't run away with the game quite so utterly as 2 counters a turn. On the other hand, lower setup cost.  I think the biggest reason that it's not literally Citadel Siege is that you can actually interact with creatures more commonly in a deck. Citadel Siege was ridiculous because you couldn't answer the bloody thing very often, at least not pre-board... Most decks will want to be running removal.  Still a bomb level card though."
lrcast,3d1snf,SirChuffly,2,Mon Jul 13 10:17:30 2015 UTC,"It is definitely bomb level, but I think still perhaps it should've been a rare.  Agreed that creatures are generally easier to deal with, but in this set if she doesn't attack (or block) there's only 3 cards that can deal with her, the 2 black destroy spells and the green fight card, though that  last one also requires you to have a 4 power creature on board.  That's not very different than only having 2-3 cards in green/white to deal with the sieges. (Actually in KTK/FRF there were 4 cards that could deal with sieges and DTK/FRF there were 5). Claustrophobia and Suppression Bonds at least deal with her body, but then she is just a Citadel Siege.  Now, in combat it's a bit easier, but white also has access to enshrouding mist."
lrcast,3d1snf,tjtillman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:06:33 2015 UTC,"but then she is just a Citadel Siege   I agree with what you're saying; and she's pretty powerful. But she's only one half of a citadel siege with a body tacked on, and the typically weaker half. Obviously what you're saying is true but I think say she's the new Siege is overstating it just a little!"
lrcast,3d1snf,SirChuffly,2,Mon Jul 13 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"That's fair, she's not in fact the new siege.  That card could gave you options, often had effective haste, and could easily run away with games, almost too powerful.  This card is not that powerful, only get one option of the siege, but get a very significant body and ability attached.   I'm not suggesting this card is as overpowered and ridiculous as the original Citadel Siege.  I'm only suggesting that this card perhaps should have been a rare rather than uncommon."

lrcast,3d1snf,Cies88,5,Mon Jul 13 01:51:03 2015 UTC,Sentinel was a groan test for each opponent I played it against.
lrcast,3d1snf,comicalZombie,3,Sun Jul 12 22:32:10 2015 UTC,Sentinel was better than all of my rares... and I played 5 great rares.
lrcast,3d1snf,oraymw,2,Mon Jul 13 00:38:57 2015 UTC,"Well, the one match at the prerelease I unintentionally drew was solely because of that card. Even though I Claustrophobia'd it, it kept tapping down my one good flying blocker, and I was stuck chumping a Charging Griffin with thopters until we ran out of extra turns. So it's pretty fantastic.  I could have probably won that game with Nissa if I had drawn her sooner, rather than on the second to last turn, so it didn't actually outperform my bombs, but it pretty well matched them."

lrcast,3d1snf,mtg_liebestod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:38:20 2015 UTC,"It went 3-1. Loss came because I drew poorly against an aggro deck that was able to punish a slow start.  But yeah, I felt pretty comfortable in the long game. The deck also had Kytheon's Irregulars and one of those 6/6 vigilence spiders.  The match I mentioned was interesting because it was clearly the case where the opponent's deck was built to win in the long-run, but his curve-toppers just were slightly worse than mine, and losing a game where you have 3 Rhox Maulers and a giant spider still on the field is understandably frustrating."
lrcast,3d1snf,mrcjtm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:14:07 2015 UTC,"So you ran a deck with 4 six-drops? I'm surprised you went 3-1 -- I've found this to be a very fast format. As amazing as 3 Sentinels and 1 spider are, I think that's way too slow when you're facing tons of cheap renown creatures. After this weekend, I think in general I would shoot for 0-1 six-drops in draft, maybe 1-2 in sealed."
lrcast,3d1snf,mtg_liebestod,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:14:34 2015 UTC,"I played white in 6 prereleases. I originally tried lower-curve stuff but my removal was often shaky and I would just lose to Rhox Maulers or opponents that would out-value me. Against the fast opponent I lost to I think I took out the spider for an elvish visionary.  As Marshall said in the set review, though, Sentinels are particularly good if you're behind on board. So I could afford to give up some early game tempo if they weren't holding up their removal for the Sentinels."

I also mulliganed pretty aggressively to get a good curve (ditching hands with just 4-drops). I even won on a mull to 5. If I curved out there wasn't much the opponents could do.   My opponent in the finals asked why I wasn't running Gaea's Revenge. I tried to tell him that I need to have early drops to apply pressure, and a card that doesn't get cast most games is not good for my deck. I recognize it's pretty bomby, and I even started with it, but I think in my deck it was right to keep it out."

lrcast,3d0czl,HKShwa,13,Sun Jul 12 12:49:15 2015 UTC,I feel like renown is really going to warp the format. All those cards are just plain amazing. They cost them for their base stats and then they just become unbelievable when they get through. Blocking is going to be at a premium. I think you might find people blocking until they draw their card that lets them swing for the win (like that red falter guy).   That was my experience anyway.
lrcast,3d0czl,natstrap,3,Sun Jul 12 18:11:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I went up against other renown decks, my strategy was to trade off a lot early and buy time to drop my bigger threats."
lrcast,3d0czl,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,2,Sun Jul 12 21:04:44 2015 UTC,"On the upside, the decks that dont have renown have enough little dudes flying around (thopters?) to make blocking manageable.

lrcast,3d0czl,LarpingWombat,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:59:35 2015 UTC,I just lost a game where my opponent mulliganed to five and pulled off Valoran Wardens plus the guy that makes small creatures unblockable. The snowball effect is real.
lrcast,3d0czl,Talpostal,13,Sun Jul 12 21:52:19 2015 UTC,"I honestly hate the renown mechanic. It punishes people who fail to curve out, whether because they missed on mana, or had to mulligan.  In other words, it punishes people who are already not having fun."
lrcast,3d0czl,SmallFryHero,3,Sun Jul 12 18:20:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you don't have at least a three drop or a way to deal with an opposing two or three drop you are basically screwed."
lrcast,3d0czl,natstrap,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:09:05 2015 UTC,"That's going to be true for every attacking mechanic to be fair.  Encouraging combat is good. Makes tricks better than the D level they're usually resigned to. And having two drops be relevant will be a nice change of pace from the last year.  Bloodthirst was a similar mechanic (and some of the renown creatures have literally the same stats) and I believe most people looked on it positively, even though it made red a bit too powerful in M12."
lrcast,3d0czl,bearrosaurus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:50:42 2015 UTC,"I understand your gripes, and that might be how it plays out. For the moment I think it is just going to make getting a 2/3 drop blocker online early super important, if you're not renowning off yourself. It's a shockingly prevalent mechanic that did dominate a lot of games."
lrcast,3d0czl,SirChuffly,7,Mon Jul 13 10:19:28 2015 UTC,"I had a fairly small prerelease, so there weren't a lot of decks to see, but I did find the synergies to be particularly strong (especially Elves). It feels relatively easy to build a deck that builds on itself in interesting ways without needing specific combo pieces and without shoving you too deep into a predefined archetype. I can't wait to play it more."
lrcast,3d0czl,peeja,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:37:07 2015 UTC,"I played in two tournaments, playing R/W and W/U and felt the Elves decks had some traps. Specifically Elvish Visionary the 1G drop for 1/1 that draws a card and Thornbow Archer the one drop for B 1/2 that when it attacks your opponent loses a life. They didn't much and were easy to roll over."
lrcast,3d0czl,HalfBadger,6,Sun Jul 12 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"Visionary is still great; remember, it doesn't really cost you anything to use, while still being a 2 drop, benefits from pump spells or your elf synergies, etc. Unsurprisingly the 1 drop is nearly unplayable."
lrcast,3d0czl,Sceptilesolar,5,Sun Jul 12 18:28:48 2015 UTC,"For me, Visionary was an early cantrip that blocks Renown and occasionally kills bombs (with Titanic Growth). I also had the elf lord that helped synergize. I was happy to play two."

lrcast,3d0czl,priceQQ,5,Sun Jul 12 20:05:29 2015 UTC,"Sealed felt awful to me. Renown is just way too swingy and if your pool doesn't have a great early game there's almost nothing you can do against an opponent who does. Mostly because all of the removal is super expensive. When I am spending 4 mana and my whole turn to kill one of your Renown guys and you can just play 2 more the next turn it feels real bad.  Also Joraga Invocation is just the most brutal card. I had 2 games today where if that card had been literal Overrun I would have been able to make a couple favorable blocks and take some damage and get away relatively unscathed with a decent board position, but since all the creatures must be blocked, it just became a one sided board wipe instead and killed all chances I had.   Obviously I can't wait to draft the set, and it looks like it could be pretty fun, but I'm not that interested in playing sealed again."
lrcast,3d0czl,serialrobinson,3,Sun Jul 12 21:07:36 2015 UTC,"Agree with some of the others about renown: mechanics that punish slow starts reduce the number of good games and are among the most frustrating.  There are a lot of cool build-arounds, though which will be good enough (Sphinx's Tutelage) and which won't (Shadows of the Past) are yet to be seen.  Overall I'm optimistic, but if renown dominates the feel of the format I'm not gonna be super high on this set."

lrcast,3d0czl,stabletimeloop,2,Sun Jul 12 14:19:20 2015 UTC,"My local shop had a pretty big prerelease sealed event with somewhere around 40-50 people. We had 4 rounds so I only got to see 5 total decks (including mine). I was surprised that the format didnt seem to be as fast as I was expecting. I only played against one guy with a fast deck, and he just roflstomped my U/R deck. All the small creatures and trading really drew out my games. The smattering of big stuff makes for serious board affecting bomb dropping. Putting something only as big as a 4/4 just completely dominates the board until hard removal can be used. One of my opponents had 2(!!!!) of the Outland Colossus (renown 6 green giant) and I just straight lost to it both games.    I chose blue because I figured there were be an overabundance of W, G, and B, and I was correct. Every opponent I played had at least one, if not both, of those colors (two were G/B). I was pleasantly surprised with how blue performed, until I got steamrolled by the Colossus. My packs were a little weak in the blue removal though, only 1 Claustrophobia."

lrcast,3d0czl,CoBTyrannon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:59:15 2015 UTC,"Ok,  i have some time and can go more in detail.  In my first pool, i had 12 really good white cards and 8 good blue cards. The problem however was, i had zero cmc3 creatures and only 3 cmc2 creatures. Those were Top though! With cmc4 totally overloaded. Alternatively i could have played green, gree offered 3 cmc 3 creatures, but mediocre ones at best. Overall my green looked terrible compared to blue. It offered 8 good cards, that i had to fill with Ds and one F. Red had really bomby rares, but only offered 5 playables and was out. No splash because double Red costs. Black offered 3 cmc3 Spells as well, but shined with even more cmc4 spells to overload the slot. Black overall was worse than blue though, but offered 3 cmc3  creatures.  I ended up plying WU because i hoped 2 Claustrophopias and a Disperse can get me to cmc4 spells. Nonetheless, i could clearly see the problem in the pool and not fix it. A very frustrating thing to happen to you. It happened, that i went 1-3 with the deck. Losing every match 1-2 in a close series. Why? Because a T2 renowned guy went unanswered, or demanded a removal spell out of me, that i then missed, when i faced his bombs.  In Sealed 2, i had 2 strong colors(UR(chose white!) and 3 very weak ones.weak ones. Problem in this pool, was that i couldn't handle fliers with toughness bigger than 1. The deck got one Removal(Burn 3, scry 1), and no fliers except Thopters. I tried to do something with the other colors, GB or RB but i got stuck with 18/19 playables including Artifact creatures. Filling up from 20 is no problem, but playing 5 bad cards can't be good.  Result was, i got overrun by Biggies. Once i ran out of Bouncemages, my fate was sealed. I had a lot of CIPT get Thopter creatures and hoped to race them in the air while chumpblocking at the bottom, but once again i went 1-3 with the deck(0-2,2-0,1-2,1-2). All the games were extremely close, because Thopters are awesome, but the guys they come with are not :(. Btw, Alhammaret beat me in my first round. The sphinx is strong!  In my 3rd Sealed, i got a good White Red pool with two evolving wilds and 20 playables. I splashed a forest, for Rhox Mauler(lacked a curvetopper), and a Citadel Castellan(needed more 3 drops). The third card became Wild Instincts, because Removal is cool!  I went 2-2 with that deck. I was really happ with the deck as it turned out. I had no color issues at all, just happened to draw too many of my 17 lands. Without those 2 evolving Wilds however, i would have had the same problem i had withing the previous decks."

I had the spy network, whirler rogue, the haste to artifacts girl, jace, ignition, decent removal, and the dark horse all star, prowess owl!   It might be because I made such a fun deck that I enjoyed it so much, but I've never had this much fun with a core set. And as someone who likes the story behind the cards it was cool to have a core set with cards that actually were flavorful. Like after opening Jace I looked at his story about his memory constantly being wiped, and then the looting made so much sense.  He had to discard his knowledge until he had enough of a base to discover what the Sphinx was doing to him."

While curve is super important and can be punishing, I feel the combat-centric nature of the set provided a fair deal of interesting situations and opportunities to make some sweet plays. There's a lot of interesting stuff going on and I think there's going to be a lot of cool drafting action to go with it. Feeling positive about it!

I strongly lean towards drafting control decks and I've found having the right answer at the right time to be quite difficult in this format.  Cards that make thopters and the 2/3 drop renown creatures are just really tough to deal with, as they are cheaper &/or strain your removal.  On top of that there are a handful of insane bombs (as usual) that flat kill you if you don't have an answer in 1-2 turns- I've already lost 3 matches to that stupid 6/6 flying demon."
lrcast,3d0czl,IIkronosII,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:57:27 2015 UTC,Pre-release is usually not a good indicator of how the draft format will be.  However I agree that the power level seems very low.  My first pre-release game was borderline boring with both of us pinging away with 1 or 2 power creatures and removing any relevant creatures that hit the board.  I think drafting will be much better because of the potential synergies and build-arounds.
lrcast,3d0czl,mrcjtm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:27:16 2015 UTC,"I played a deck with 2 planeswalkers, 2 board wipes, counter magic, and card draw. Any limited format in which that's even remotely possible to build seems pretty cool to me."

Flips of Planeswalkers was irrelevant.   Pool 2: Red/Black Removal: Matches usually ended in both players bashing their brains out or trading cards/removal and then bashing their brains out.   Maybe (!) with Khans-Block and Modern Masters and lots of constructed play lately I am not used to this kind of Magic or missed a point but this set has a more ""gatecrashy""-look to me.   Or to put it in other words. If there are R/W nutdraws in a limited format I am not a great fan of it :)  What I liked is that 2 of the greatest bombs are commons, The Thopterdude (Whirler Rogue) and the INSANE 4/6 Sentinel of the Eternal Watch.

lrcast,3d2kan,Talpostal,3,Mon Jul 13 00:38:34 2015 UTC,"This Sealed Deck pool is passable! I Think Blue Red is a trap here, if you actually lay out the playable cards you will see it's quite bad, and you have about 5ish slots that need to filled with absolute jank.... I built it here.  The first other deck i tryed was Black White, which i was drawn to since those are the two simingly deepest colors and i saw a few synergies between the two. Again here it is.  However the list that i think is actually the best here is white red utilizing the thopters and parts of removal from red and the deepness that is our white playables. This List i think also has the most synergies, acess to a sideboard, and the most straight forward plan."

lrcast,3d2kan,escplan9,2,Mon Jul 13 16:50:34 2015 UTC,More important consideration for draft than sealed. It's really tough to have a good aggro sealed pool. You don't win off your two drops in sealed. You still have tons of turn three plays and a couple filler two drops
lrcast,3d2kan,Athio,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:32:44 2015 UTC,"That is fair, but we just can't really get around that in this sealed pool, that might be a reason to go white black if your looking for more controll over your list, also two read the bones is tempting."
lrcast,3d2kan,Reavana,2,Mon Jul 13 22:55:59 2015 UTC,"Not the greatest sealed pool, but my first overview of it would be to go UR Thropter Creature.   You have 5 cards that make them, throw in the construct, and then fill in the rest of the creatures.  You have a limited amount of removal, so I guess in sealed focus on your counterspells and a few of your red burn spells and go from there.  I looks like 12 red, 9 blue spells, and 2 artifacts.  I might even consider running an extra land and use the weak Magmatic Insight later in the game."
lrcast,3d2kan,Athio,2,Mon Jul 13 03:17:31 2015 UTC,The problem is that he only has about 12-14 playables between blue and red.
lrcast,3d2kan,cferejohn,2,Mon Jul 13 05:43:33 2015 UTC,It looks like UR thopters is your only real option. You definitely run the land you can sac for 2 of them. War Horn might even be reasonable here given the number of 1/1s you could end up with (also you can tap it for whirler rogue).

lrcast,3d30no,freudian_cigar,3,Mon Jul 13 03:01:46 2015 UTC,A 6 card hand with t2-t3 plays is better than a 7 card hand with no action. Never hesitate to mulligan a starting hand. I also think that with Origins it's very important to have a t2 play. If you allow your opponent to swing in with a renown creature uncontested you're already at a big disadvantge.
lrcast,3d30no,CptFizz,2,Mon Jul 13 10:10:03 2015 UTC,"I'd probably mulligan that against even another control deck.  You keep a handful of removal and a bomb with no early creatures against a control deck, and what happens? They roll out a couple of less aggressive creatures while you have nothing to cast. You don't want to waste your removal spells on those creatures because they're not that good, but they can still freely attack into you. Eventually you're significantly behind on life and you have to start using your removal spells on mediocre creatures to stop from dying. And then when you can finally play your bomb, they kill it, because they're a control deck and haven't had much to use their removal spells on. Then, if you're not dead yet, you've already spent your removal spells, and can't deal with their bomb, and you're stuck drawing 2 and 3 mana creatures that can't get you back ahead.  If I don't at least have a solid 2 or 3 mana creature, I'm not keeping that hand most of the time."
lrcast,3d30no,CelestialBeekeeper,2,Mon Jul 13 05:27:00 2015 UTC,"I think there's some logic in the idea that if you know what your opponent is playing, you mulligan accordingly. There's hands that are slow, but against another controlly midrange would be strong... But against aggro you ship.   That said the hand you mentioned sounds like a fairly certain mull to 6."

lrcast,3d1g04,peeja,4,Sun Jul 12 19:05:17 2015 UTC,"I definitely think this format seems much closer to the pauper side of things than the KoT block. Most of the power is at the uncommon/common level, and most of the rares don't seem to ridiculous.  I think it is product of the core set design, which tries to keep things relatively simple and of low, flat power."
lrcast,3d1g04,dumac,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:42:59 2015 UTC,I think this is aided by the flip planeswalkers all being a little tricky to get flipped when your deck isn't built a bit around them.  Often good planeswalkers are huge bombs in core sets.  These planeswalkers are good - bombs after you flip them but flipping them is non-trivial.
lrcast,3d1g04,sylverfyre,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:13:20 2015 UTC,It also helps that almost all of them die to a well timed removal spell.
lrcast,3d1g04,QuixoticMcGee,6,Mon Jul 13 03:37:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how much of the case that is, as good rares still have a hugely warping effect on the power level of decks. Keep in mind my only experience thus far has been in sealed, but I've seen the difference between decks with tonnes of rares and decks with few, and the difference certainly is there. But I can see an argument being made both ways.    In my pool the best deck I could make was grossly consistent, 7 2 drops, 7 three drops  (4 of which were bogart brutes, that guy is a house!), and 3 celestial flares, a fiery impulse and an Akron jailer as my removal. The rest of my deck was a knightly valour, 11 plains, 6 mountains and my 3 on colour rares: Archangel of Tithes, Pia and Kirin Nalaar and Tragic Arrogance. The deck went 4-0, losing only 1 game to the other deck I'm going to talk about.    I could curve out easily without any of my rares and win a game handily, supporting your theory that this is a pauper format. But a couple I would stall out with my opponent at 9 or 2, only to eventually win by top decking one of my honestly unfair rares. The only cards that ever came close to beating me were other honestly unfair rares.    In the final round I got to play 15 minutes of magic against my friend who I'd built my deck with at the start of the day. His deck was bonkers, with 6 on colour powereful rares. He had 2 hanger back walkers, a managourger hydra, evolutionary leap, chandra and exquisite fire craft. The rest of his deck wasn't too shabby either, with multiple elvish visionaries, a zendikar incarnate, a gearcrafter and fair but not bonkers amount of removal.    His deck was the only one to take a game off me all day, and I'm almost certain it was because I took turn 3 off to celestial flare his turn 2 hangerback (he played turn two hangerback every game against me) before it got too large for me to handle. And as such I didn't curve out like I did pretty much every other game.    All of our games were really close, but the third was the closest, eventually coming down him stalling me out with him at 2, forcing me to chump prickleboar every turn to not die, while he had evolutionary leap sitting there so he could be as arrogant as he well pleased. Then eventually me drawing Pia and Kirin while I only had 2 red sources. That forced him to attack with everything, putting me to one only for me to kill him the next turn with an exploding thoptor.    Rares defined our three games even if the consistently powerful commons had sorted out most of mine before they sealed the deal.    My conclusion is that this is not a pauper format, the rares are too powerful for that to be the case. But this is a format where an extremely consistent common/uncommon deck is likely able to beat the lots-of-great-and-a-few-bad-cards-to-make-it-work deck more than 50% of the time."
lrcast,3d1g04,calmingRespirator,3,Mon Jul 13 00:30:01 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with Respirator's outline here. Yes, the commons and uncommons are very capable, but the big rare bombs are completely board distorting. I think this is in large part because so many of the cards are on the small size (a plethora of 2/2 , 3/2, 2/3, and 1/1 cards laying around) and there just isnt the same quality of removal we saw in the last block.    In contrast, there were so many larger creatures and really good removal floating around in Dragons/Fate that when someone dropped a dragon or some other biggish creature on the board there was a good chance that you had one of your own in response or could kill it with removal in a turn or two. Despite those big guys coming down, you didnt feel the serious pressure to do something about it. In Origins, when that Skaab Goliath, Rhox Maulers, Skysnare Spider, Outland Colossus, Erebos's Titan, etc hit the board you have to deal with the threat in VERY short order or the game is just over. Your 1/1 thopters or 2/2 renown guy just wont cut it against any of the big bodies out there. If you dont have that one removal spell, or a big dude of your own, RIGHT NOW, you just lose. That really didnt feel the case in DDF."
lrcast,3d1g04,LarpingWombat,2,Mon Jul 13 02:38:02 2015 UTC,"I think that might also be why the Boggart Brutes were so good to me, multiple menacing creatures makes it a lot easier to be aggressive if the large distorting rares have a diminished effect in blocking your creatures. Sure you're going to need to trade into their guys as you attack, but needing 4 guys to block your two means you're definitely getting some damage in. In doing so hopefully shortening the length of the game and giving the opponent less of a chance to get those rares out."
lrcast,3d1g04,calmingRespirator,2,Mon Jul 13 02:53:49 2015 UTC,"At my 53 player prerelease, 3 of the top 4 decks were R/G playing Joraga Invocation. There were rares in them, but most games played out by creating an army, blocking renown creatures, and casting Joraga Invocation for the win.  There seem to be several uncommons capable of stealing or dominating games. In addition to Joraga Invocation, there are Skysnare Spider and Sentinel of the Eternal Watch, as well as Knightly Valor, which all dominate the board and provide defense as well as offense.  The other deck in the top 4 at my prerelease was mine, which was W/B curving out renown creatures into removal. I had good rares, but the cards that won me the most games were Topan Freeblade, Consul's Lieutenant, and Suppression Bonds.  Based on this small sample size, I'm definitely thinking that Origins is leaning more towards the pauper end of the spectrum."
lrcast,3d1g04,kccmtg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:31:31 2015 UTC,"I could see that. Of my two pre-release pools, both were RB. Both only lost 1 game.

I hadnt thought of the Whirler Rogue + Willbreaker combo, that would have been good. Edit: I was also looking at a very overcrowded 4 drop slot as I was building it out.    Otherwise, that U/B deck looks very similar to the one I put together. Thanks for the input.

lrcast,3d2ie7,CanORage,2,Mon Jul 13 00:22:04 2015 UTC,I've seen several contribute wins to LR. My question is: I just started listening a couple weeks ago; is there some specific older episodes that helped you more than others?
lrcast,3d2ie7,Nalidz,2,Mon Jul 13 02:13:54 2015 UTC,"There's a thread with a list in the title description (and more in the comments) of non-set-specific (or having parts that are non-set-specific) ""level-up"" episodes about concepts or general principles for limited magic. Check out the link on the right ""Useful shows to hear."" Most episodes do have some part about the current set, so for the older sets you'll want to skip past the part where they're talking about specific current set cards to the more generalized theory discussion.  Personally, to start with as a general sampling of the most important concepts, I'd recommend checking out 43, 65, 173, 184, 189, and 226. Some of the early episodes with Ryan  go over in nice detail the math behind splashing and mana sources needed to reasonably expect X colors by turn x (I think that was the Making A Splash episode). Bread Crumbs is a nice overview of card type prioritization, and the later ones listed above all have really valuable information on various topics. Of the LSV-era shows, I recommend the ""Have a Plan"" show the most (and the current set reviews).   I'd say once you hit those mentioned above, review the set review shows and articles until you feel pretty comfortable evaluating the cards of whatever set you're playing for limited. You don't want to be surprised by the cards, reading every single card and having to determine card evaluations on the fly during draft or sealed. You don't have to memorize them all, but it helps a ton if you have a pretty good feel for what's good and when before you sit at the table. Other than that, just try to learn the lessons that present themselves to you as they come and most importantly, have fun!  Good luck; you came to the right place!   *Also just a heads up, I think you meant ""attribute""  Edit: a couple extra tips for going back through old shows. Also one more: if you're listening to a Brian Wong or Jon Laux episode, I highly recommend listening from the ""Level-up"" part of the show on through the very end. Some of their sign-offs are absolutely hilarious!"

lrcast,3d0ynz,gsamson,2,Sun Jul 12 16:41:40 2015 UTC,I went 3-2 yesterday with it. I lost one of the 4 games I cast it in. Every other time it was with at least one other thopter ready to milk the card draw and make another.   Ultimately I think it's one of those cards that makes an otherwise cut rate archetype playable. The deck has a really really rough time beating the 4/3 reach red creature. Or God forbid the 6/6 vigilance spider.   Oh and watch out for the 4/4 rhino with renown and trample. Now I can lose to rhinos in standard and limited.
lrcast,3d0ynz,TheJediCounsel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:32:44 2015 UTC,"I played against a friend who had 2(!) of them, and yeah, as you say, when it was good it was completely oppressive, but when it was bad it was awful.   He enabled it with a couple random artifact creatures (the 3/3 for 4 that gains you life when it dies, Meteorite) as well as a couple of the red guys who make thopters. That seemed mostly good enough to get it on.  It definitely made me think that there's a draftable deck here, though I expect the competition for Thopter producers to be pretty stiff - people are excited about them and the worst of the creatures that come with Thopters (the blue common 1/2 flyer) is still pretty good even without thopter synergy."

lrcast,3czd01,escplan9,10,Sun Jul 12 03:59:14 2015 UTC,"In general, the week between prerelease and release is when many cards are at their peak, generally speaking. This is because the demand spikes but the supply is still very thin. This results in most cards being overvalued by a market desperate to get brewing.   However, a small subset of the cards will spike uphigher in the next few weeks as they turn up in new builds seen in Pro Tours and other early top level events. The trick is to know which cards have huge constructed potential before the crowd does, and outguessing the crowd is actually quite difficult for most people.  Personally, unless I pull a card I am already planning on jamming in a deck right away, I just dump every prerelease card I can ASAP--mostly via Pucatrade. Then, about ten days later, I can often pick up some of the same cards for far less if I decide I want them for constructed."

Vryn Wingmare comes to mind - it's about $2 now; I don't expect it will get much lower than that, but it's possible that after rotation there's a Tier 1 or 1.5 deck that wants it and it will bump up into the $5-8 range."

lrcast,3cyroz,altgothbro,4,Sun Jul 12 00:22:59 2015 UTC,"You can 2-1 with just about anything that's well put together. You can 3-0, for that matter.   Powered Cube gets a reputation for ""broken or bust"" gameplay, and you definitely do want to do powerful things. But no matter what broken draws your deck is capable of, sometimes it won't hit, and those decks fold faster than any other to a 2/1 with equipment.  If you draft a deck (as you seem to be doing), that deck is open, and you end up with a strong version of it as a result and proceed to play it well, you'll probably stand a good chance of at least breaking even. There's just not that many particularly underpowered archetypes ala B/R vampires in the last Legacy Cube."
lrcast,3cyroz,SinibusUSG,3,Sun Jul 12 01:19:47 2015 UTC,"My strategy in holiday cube has been to take a degenerate combo piece, a piece of power, or a disruption card first.  Then try to follow that as best I can.  The thing about cube is there are so many great cards, and the power level is so high that is doesn't hurt much at all to speculate very early on high payoff cards.  If you get there, then great.  If not, your deck should still be very reasonable."
lrcast,3cyroz,Cygnal37,2,Sun Jul 12 02:06:45 2015 UTC,"I have been having much more success with aggro strategies in this version of the cube; far more than any previous Holiday Cube. My experiences are just anecdotal, of course, but I wouldn't be surprised if the statistics end up showing that aggro is performing better in this cube than usual.  One reason is that combo has been slightly de-powered with the removal of Time Vault. Another is that aggro is underdrafted. Most people (understandably) have a bias toward blue and toward the flashy and value-y strategies."

lrcast,3cyuwf,Greyfeld,7,Sun Jul 12 00:55:33 2015 UTC,"I played two sealeds today.  Sealed 1 I played Red/Green after picking a Red box. I went 4-0 and didn't drop a game! The games were super fun, so I had a great time and feel very proud of myself for not getting ROTy. I think my deck was great and I even had some good sideboard cards. Rhox  Maulers and Prickleboars were all-stars, as were Akroan Sergeants and Somberwald Alphas. The deck was absolutely bonkers for the format, but in the fourteen packs I saw total, the best card I got was Harbinger of Tides. I'm happy to get it, as I have Modern Merfolk, but I would have liked to see any of the Planeswalkers and/or a Piledriver. Someone opened two Gideons in this sealed, actually, and there were tons of Planeswalkers around. I only faced down a Jace, though.  Here's the deck if anyone is interested:   Creatures  1 Subterranean Scout  2 Timberpack Wolf  2 Undercity Troll  1 Managorger Hydra  2 Akroan Sergeant  1 Ghirapur Gearcrafter  1 Yeva's Forcemage  1 Skyraker Giant  1 Firefiend Elemental  1 Somberwald Alpha  1 Llanowar Empath  2 Rhox Maulers  1 Prickleboar  Spells  1 Titan's Strength  2 Fiery Impulse  2 Dragon Fodder  1 Exquisite Firecraft  Lands  10 Mountain  7 Forest   I had a second Prickleboar and it was painful because I think it's good, but I cut one of the two to get down to 23. I never really had a reason to bring it in in a game 2. I did bring in Hitchlaw Recluse and Aerial Volley against a U/W flying deck with thopters and X/1s. I brought in Orchard Spirit against another R/G deck which had no air game.  Overall, I'm just very happy about how I played during these rounds. There was only one mistake I felt I made, but it wasn't significant and I had the win on the next turn regardless of which move was technically correct. Super happy to go undefeated.  In Sealed 2 I also ran R/G after picking a Green box. This sealed pool wasn't nearly as good, but I felt it was solid. I was starting to get very tired and I will admit that I made a major mistake because I was being too ROTy that cost me a match. The games were still good, though, and I went 3-1 and took third place.  I'm very appreciative of LR. I only recently started listening again and have been bouncing between LR and CR, but man did it help. I actually went to FNM last night and went 4-0 (dropping only one game) because I listened to LR/CR's advice. So, in short,  won two tournaments in a row and took third in a third. Super happy about my results even if my pulls were less than stellar.  But that wasn't even the best part. During Sealed 2, I got the chance to help out a small kid (maybe between age 8-10) fix his deck. He played match one and lost 0-2. There was a dinner break (LGS bought everyone pizza! Very nice of them.) and I wasn't partaking, so I took the time to fix his deck. He was playing a 50-card G/B/U deck that just was not good. It had Orbs of Warding in it and he wasn't playing his Kothophed... He had an Avaricious Dragon in his sideboard and I made him a sick B/R deck. He was super pumped when he went 2-0 in his next match. I actually ended up facing him in round 3 and the deck was very good. Even better than I expected, actually. I managed to beat him 2-0, but I fully admit that I got lucky and he played very well; I just happened to have the exact cards to deal with what he was doing, otherwise I would have easily lost both games. I think he won his next match, but I'm not sure, but he was playing with his dad after the tournament was over and he was still just as pumped about the deck.  I had a great weekend. Origins is great and tons of fun. LR is great is a huge part about why I did well this weekend.  Thanks for reading my ramblings."
lrcast,3cyuwf,xDragod,5,Sun Jul 12 03:40:52 2015 UTC,"R/W aggro was pretty nuts I felt like. Topan Freeblade was as good a two drop as you could want and generally any of the Renown creatures in white felt like good value. Red added a bit of burn to beat people on tempo while you had cards like Suppression bonds to take their big creatures out of the game. I often had the game well in hand by turn 4 or 5. Topan into Ghirapur Gearcrafter into Apryn Tactictian or Kytheon's tactics put people into a world of hurt. I chose white twice and only lost once with each deck to a better W/R deck. If an opponent stumbled for even a turn, R/W just closed the door fast. The first strikers or hasted guys just made games end.  I also got to play a Gideon into dragon fodder and flipped it on turn 3 once. That was really magical christmasland.  Other notable good cards in the deck were the Boggart Brute and Prickleboar. I stuck the throwing knife on Prickleboard and I could just grind down all of their creatures.   By the way, throwing knife felt pretty excellent all day long."

I picked Nissa but ended up with a UR Thopter deck that was kind of the nuts, though I had a pair of sketchy keeps in round one and ended up going 1–2. Thopter Spy Network was as ridiculous as people expected. Ghirapur Aether Grid was in as my ""Eh, what the hell"" card, but it was surprisingly good.

lrcast,3cyuwf,Aethien,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:42:59 2015 UTC,"Nothing terribly surprising except white was even more dominant than I thought it was.   I went 4-1 in my first prerelease with what I thought was a very mediocre white-red deck because it had none of the good white uncommons nor a good white rare but I did get Chandra and the red 4/5 trampler that makes all your other red sources deal 1 extra. 2-2 in my second prerelease with a slightly clunky black-red deck which had some unfortunate draws combined with sloppy play from me after a long day. Tons of removal but could really have used another bomb aside from yet another Chandra and the 6 mana 6/6 demon.  The most surprising thing I think was how many people just don't see how utterly unplayable Reclaim and the 1 mana 1/2 elf are. Also almost every new-ish player seemed to gravitate towards black/green, presumably in an attempt to make a poor elf deck. Edit: I even had someone reclaim their 1/2 elf against me, I'm not sure how he got a win to face me but it happened, I even had a Topan Freeblade right there on the table..."
lrcast,3cyuwf,brunothepig,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:36:03 2015 UTC,"I was hanging out with a couple of friends before the pre-release, we were heading there together so just killing time for a while first. In our discussion we mentioned how Elves looked like it might be fun in draft, but couldn't possibly work in Sealed right?  I ended up building G/B Elves. I didn't even set out to do it, I just pretty quickly decided on Black thanks to my masses of removal, decided my Green looked like my second best colour, laid it out and noticed I had about eight good creatures, who happened to be Elves. Also an Eyeblight Massacre. I was very impressed with what it did with a solid curve. Mystic into Forcemage into Shaman of the Pack, as an example, was an easy six damage. Coupled with Eyeblight Assassin's and Reave Souls, even Weight of the Underworld in a pinch, I was killing my opponent quite a bit quicker than you might expect from G/B.  I went 4-0, and now I'm really curious about that archetype in draft. It might have been just a case of Sealed being a little slower, so Elves felt faster by comparison. But I definitely think it's gonna be a scary thing in draft if you can get together the cards."

Before the match starts my opponent explains that its his first prerelease, that he would have been glad to win even one match and he can't explain how he is 4-0 too. This is always great because basically he tells me that if I beat him it doesn't matter and if he beats me I'm either a bad player or made some serious mistakes.  I'm playing a black-green deck and he turns out to be playing red-white. He wins the die roll but I can hold him off in the first match, managing to get rid of my Priest of the Blood Rite after Alpha-Striking with the team and saccing it to his Celestial Flare (for which he tipped his hand way too early).  Game two he came out much faster and I couldn't hold him off. In the end he burned me out with Exquisite Firecraft.  So Game 3, I start. First hand, 1 land. Second hand, no land. Double mulligan while my opponent snap-keeps. I go Swamp. My opponent Mountain into Bellows Lizard. Second Swamp, Fetid Imp, hoping this would keep the Lizard at bay. He casts a 2nd turn Infectious Bloodlust which no longer lets me block successfully and I go to 17. Turn Three I have another swamp and no plays, I am reduced to hoping he can't burn the Imp or play a combat trick. I successfully trade the imp for the Lizard and he doesn't search for another Bloodlust and instead follows up with an Akroan Segeant. I immediately put Weight of the Underworld on it to get rid of it. My opponent sighs.  I actually get a turn of Breathing Room and decide to cast a Leaf Guilder. Not to be outdone he casts Kytheon's Irregulars, because that is a fair card. I resolve a Yeva's Forcemage. I hoped to occupy my oponnents mana and do so not the way I want it to happen as he Act of Treasons the Forcemage and taps the Elf, allowing the Irregulars to become Renowned. I resolve a Conclave Naturalists, but it gets locked away Suppression Bonds. I get a Vastwood Gorger down. He follows up with a Patron of the Valiant which is yet another threat that is lethal in short order in addition to growing the Irregulars another size. I finally draw a removal spell in Wild Instincts, but I am forced to use it on the Angel as I am even worse equipped to deal with it at the moment.  So now I am at 8 life but I think I might be stable as long as my opponent doesn't just draw something too crazy (or keeps drawing plains). I might survive long enough to find my Unholy Hunger and get rid of the Irregulars. My opponent topdecks Mighty Leap and kills me instantly.  TL;DR: My deck yanked my chain for a while, pretending that I might win the match before the rug gets completely pulled out from under me."

You just think ""What is every color good at? Blue draws, green creatures are huge and resilient, red is aggressive and burny, etc."", then multiply your expectations by about a thousand.  And that's it! Cube is essentially the most ungodly powerful core set of all time. You want to be looking to pick up powerful interactive cards and 2-3 card wombo combos. Remember that in a normal core set a control deck might drop Serra Angel, in the cube they're probably gonna be dropping Grave Titan.   Personally I love drafting the ""mono-faircards.dek"", which is where you ignore all the broken blue spells that everyone is already fighting for and draft a nice, agressive-midrange white/green deck, staple a Sword Of Fire And Ice to your Isamaru, Hound Of Konda and watch Mr. ShowAndTell-Emrakul die before he gets to do anything fun. :D  Final protip: Draft lands!

Just looking at the spoiler though, W is probably one of the stronger colors due to its depth, with lots of C+ commons all across the curve. Blue's lack of depth worries me, though it does get a nice payoff in Claustrophobia being 1UU to cast. Red has a lot of nichey aggressive cards, which makes me think it's not going to be very flexible and might not play nice with other strategies, but that might not be an issue if most decks in the format want to be aggressive."

lrcast,3cvmrp,Drivvs,8,Sat Jul 11 03:48:03 2015 UTC,"IMO The stronger the format is, the less you should rely on quadrant theory when evaluating cards, specifically the ""all-important"" from behind quadrant.  You're just going to be relying a lot less on topdecks because the format is so strong and fast. The most important quadrant, then, is developing. The strongest cards are cards you want to see in your opening hand. This is why mana accel is picked so highly: not just moxen but also things like signets.   The best example of this is one mana discard spells. In DTK Duress is horrible. In cube, you rely on these to stop your opponent from executing a broken start. It also nabs planeswalkers which are very important in cube.   A first turn thoughtseize frequently stops hands that have one business spell and a bunch of mana accel. You could win by just taking a Jace while your opponent is left with a hand of sol ring, black lotus, and lands, with nothing to cast with all the mana.  With reanimator, I would take animate dead before griselbrand. The cube does not lack in reanimator targets, a lot of them will wheel. Does it matter if you're reanimating griselbrand or Iona? You're probably gonna win if you reanimate her on turn 2.  Iona frequently goes last.  In green I'd rather take elves or natural order before taking green fat. You'll see craterhoof going late, you don't even have to worry about getting it.  I guess, as a result of this cube philosophy, I would also say enablers/early interaction > win conditions.  Things that don't function as either an enabler, early interaction or a finisher are filler. A great example is something like polukranos. I'd rather take a 4 mana drop that functions as an enabler, like Garruk Wildspeaker, which also functions as ramp, as well as pumping out beasts (this is, btw, why it's the best Garruk)."
lrcast,3cvmrp,pahamack,2,Sat Jul 11 05:06:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that makes a lot of sense. To your point, in my first Cube draft (in which I swiftly 1-2'd) I drafted a pod deck, and in the last game I had what I thought was the nut draw. After getting my pod thoughtseized turn 1, I felt way behind casting value creatures almost on curve."
lrcast,3cvmrp,llamagoelz,2,Sat Jul 11 05:28:16 2015 UTC,"This picture came from my second experience with cube today. It went. . . much better than my first. Needless to say I'm addicted, but still a little intimidated as to how to approach it. Here I feel like the re-animator deck just plopped down in front of me, but anyone have advice for decent regular drafters just getting into cube?"

lrcast,3cv306,CelticStag,7,Sat Jul 11 00:43:16 2015 UTC,"My advice: don't even bother trying to metagame the prerelease.  Firstly, for most LGS', the competition isn't exactly the pro tour. There's gonna be a lot of new players who don't know how to build a sealed properly. Any colour you choose you already have a leg up.  Secondly, there's variance. You don't know what's going to be in 5 packs. I've gone to multiple prereleases where I couldn't even play my chosen colour because there weren't enough playables in that colour.  Personally, I'm picking red because I wanna play the thopters. If that's not available I'm just gonna ask what colour they have the most prerelease packs left and take that."
lrcast,3cv306,pahamack,2,Sat Jul 11 04:46:51 2015 UTC,"On the second point: this set of Prereleases will have 6 regular packs of Origins, plus a 7-card seeded pack of only cards of the chosen color (1 rare, 2 uncommons, 4 commons). This will increase the chance of having enough playables in the chosen color."
lrcast,3cv306,pikachufan2164,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:57:45 2015 UTC,"Listending to *pv and lsv on what color to pick has helped me get 1st place at 5 out of the last 6 midnight prereleases.

lrcast,3cv306,5-s,2,Sat Jul 11 09:42:06 2015 UTC,I don't pick a color for the prerelease. I even played Blue for M15. I've never regretted it.
lrcast,3cv306,CelestialBeekeeper,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:29:45 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest question is what your seed pack color will be.  The second color will be determined entirely by what you open, regardless of what you'd prefer.  And personally, I'm still waffling on what seed pack I'm going to take.  I think I'll grab white on my first deck, just because it's the strongest color, then decide on the next one I pick up based on how the first tourney played out."

I personally think it might be a bit higher than a 3 since it's easy to cast and easy to trigger, especially in green. That said, it doesn't immediately impact the board state.   Love your guys' reviews though!   Edit: Where would you place green in comparison with the other colors?"

Marshall says a B pushes you into a color, and you almost never cut it. Your scale says 2.0 is filler that sometimes gets cut. Is one a revised opinion?"
lrcast,3cu6f6,funnynoveltyaccount,2,Sat Jul 11 03:27:16 2015 UTC,"Green got a lot of strong uncommons this time around (reparations for the last two sets I suppose).  I think Yeva's Forcemage was pretty underrated in this review. Granted, it has to have another creature in play to be useful, but the ability to force a creature is very nifty.  Turn 2 bear into forcemage will let your bear attack through your opponent's 3 drop and deal 4. On a board stall, you can pump Skyraker Giant to a 6/5, then they have to eat 6 damage or double block.  Yeah, you have to be on the aggro to pull this off so it's not a 3.0 rating, but I'm probably taking forcemage over Hitchclaw Recluse 50% of the time."
lrcast,3cu6f6,bearrosaurus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:29:26 2015 UTC,It's interesting that PV ranked it the worst color - I actually really like it and think I'll be playing green tonight. Seems to pair pretty well with everything and Nissa might be the best/easiest to flip planeswalker.
lrcast,3cu6f6,Malarazz,5,Fri Jul 10 21:57:11 2015 UTC,It's actually the color with the most playable commons at 12.
lrcast,3cu6f6,bearrosaurus,3,Fri Jul 10 23:40:44 2015 UTC,"Green is pretty consistent at being consistent, but they lack ""sexy"" cards. Easy to fill out a general ""midrange"" deck without clear strategies. And sometimes Wotc completely neglects giving them a way to close games.  Origins green doesn't have a Wooly Loxodon or Nessian Asp, so I'm kind of down on it as well."
lrcast,3cu6f6,Malarazz,3,Sat Jul 11 00:36:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm skysnare spider? Rhox maulers, which isn't too hard to renown with all the combat tricks at common?  Don't get me wrong, I'm going white for the prerelease, but I'm not sure I can get behind that argument"
lrcast,3cu6f6,bearrosaurus,2,Sat Jul 11 00:53:06 2015 UTC,"Skysnare is one uncommon out of eighty. Can't count on it. I'd have Joraga Invocation as a better example of a finisher anyways.  I really like Rhox if you can manage to pull him out on turn 4, but I'd rather not have to spend a combat trick to turn him on. I could stick a mantle of webs on any random 5 drop and get the same thing anyways, without having to attack.  The point is to have a trump that doesn't need support that you can just topdeck. In 'Good ol' days' magic, green was bad but at least you could rely on Craw Wurm to take over the game. The color loses a lot of its appeal without the hegemony on big dudes."
lrcast,3cu6f6,Cygnal37,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:20:00 2015 UTC,"Lily seems a bit easier to me.  She asks you have 1 other creature, and some way for it to die.  In limited.... with creature combat.... seems like a done deal.  That said, her flip side is quite a bit weaker."
lrcast,3cu6f6,yavimaya_eldred,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:00:17 2015 UTC,"Her flip side is considerably weaker. Both players discarding isn't powerful in limited, and reanimating something is only really powerful if you have a good creature in the yard already. It can flip sooner, but it's not as strong at finishing the game."
lrcast,3cswnl,ScotMartin,3,Fri Jul 10 14:41:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the rating for Fiery Conclusion.  In most cases, it's just a better Collateral Damage, which was a great way to sac creatures that were going to die anyway.  Chump block, sac, kill something else, sac and nuke as a response to removal, etc etc.  Obviously this has a drawback, not being able to go to face, but my experience tells me that the damage is usually used to clear out creatures, anyway.  I'd put this card at a solid 2."
lrcast,3cswnl,Greyfeld,3,Fri Jul 10 15:51:04 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The extra mana and inability to hit players makes this worse than collateral damage for aggro decks.  I think unless you have several token producers or ways to steal creatures, this card will stay in the board."
lrcast,3cswnl,dumac,2,Fri Jul 10 17:44:44 2015 UTC,"But Collateral Damage was also pretty unplayable without AoT/Humble Defector synergy. Neither is ""good filler"" on their own."
lrcast,3cswnl,Malarazz,4,Fri Jul 10 15:55:52 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree.  I was never unhappy playing Collateral Damage as a 1-of, especially in creature-heavy aggro decks.  Creatures are going to die as a matter of course during a game, and using that death to nuke something else off the board is very useful.  And 5 is a lot more damage than 3.  We're effectively talking about the difference between clearing a chump blocker and clearing a wall.  The only other non-rare removal spell in red that can clear that much toughness will cost you 7 mana to cast."
lrcast,3cswnl,Greyfeld,3,Fri Jul 10 16:04:36 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. I was never unhappy playing Collateral Damage as a 1-of, especially in creature-heavy aggro decks.   CD has a very significant upside over FC in decks like those, in that it can target a player and burn them post-combat for those last few points of damage. FC can't do that."
lrcast,3cswnl,Malarazz,5,Fri Jul 10 16:07:10 2015 UTC,"We also had removal like Sarkhan's Rage, Bathe in Dragonfire, and Pyrotechnics in red to remove big creatures off the field.  That's not the case in this set.  Most of the red removal in Origins is 2-3 damage.  Ravaging Blaze, while a great card, requires dumping 6+ mana into it to remove large creatures, and everything else is a rare.  5 damage at instant speed for 2 mana is going to fill a fantastic slot in aggro decks."
lrcast,3cswnl,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:14:02 2015 UTC,"That's not what ""fantastic"" means. Setting aside that it can't hit players, it's a spell that still asks you to have a creature in play (notably one you don't care about). Most creatures in the format are fairly small to begin with, and any of the other burn spells can still tag team with a creature to kill a bigger dude while having the utility of being good at other points of the game."
lrcast,3cswnl,yavimaya_eldred,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:57:29 2015 UTC,"That's not what ""fantastic"" means.   ""Fantastic"" is a subjective quantity, and I'm not going to argue about my choice of verbiage."
lrcast,3cswnl,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:08:45 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree, although I will also say that 5 damage is not as much as it seems--there aren't actually all that many things that this kills that Collateral Damage would not have. I think all in all this will be slightly worse that Collateral Damage was, but I always thought that card was underrated."
lrcast,3cswnl,ThePensive,2,Fri Jul 10 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"I think the jump from 3 to 5 damage is significant enough to be worth the extra mana.  There are 22 targetable creatures with 4-5 health and 10 with 6+ health.  With no hardline removal, red is going to need all the help it can get when it comes to removing big creatures, short of just relying on black as a second color."
lrcast,3cswnl,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:31:28 2015 UTC,"It's going to be red's only way of getting rid of some bombs, that's for sure--11 of those 22 creatures with 4-5 toughness are rare or mythic."
lrcast,3cswnl,ThePensive,2,Fri Jul 10 21:37:43 2015 UTC,Just a thought - is the synergy between Dragon Fodder and spell mastery worth mentioning?
lrcast,3cswnl,crossbrainedfool,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:46:49 2015 UTC,"Probably, but it really depends more on your deck and whether it can make good use of it.  Hitting spell mastery on something like Exquisite Firecraft is pointless. Even Fiery Impulses is eh, sometimes you just want to shock a Boggart Brute and don't care about the extra point of burn."
lrcast,3cswnl,Malarazz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:17:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's not as much as something like how it affected prowess."
lrcast,3cswnl,Demolishing,0,Fri Jul 10 19:58:52 2015 UTC,"It's probably not worth much more than the synergy with Prowess.  That said, unlike Fate, Origins doesn't have a glut of spells-that-are-actually-minions to synergize with that sort of thing, so it's worth taking into consideration while drafting."
lrcast,3cul5h,Jethro_H,3,Fri Jul 10 22:14:42 2015 UTC,"birthing pod is great in the right deck. I've actually gotten Kiki jikki'd out of nowhere with pod... sac a 2 drop, get exarch, untap pod, sac a 4 drop, get kiki, win. This is the sort of thing why when playing cube it really helps to be aware of constructed decks and how they play out, because I believe Kiki pod used to be a competitive modern deck.  I start getting interested in pod when I have multiple value creatures plus mana dorks.  I'm more interested in that crazy manabase. It's quite the work of art. Also, I'm surprised this went 3-0. I've been cubing in the single elim and the decks I've been facing have been quite broken, and fast. This doesn't have anything to play on t1 unless you have mox emerald."
lrcast,3cul5h,pahamack,2,Fri Jul 10 23:28:20 2015 UTC,"Pod isn't unplayable, it's just very difficult to have a good Pod deck because so many things have to go right in the draft. To have a good Pod curve, you had to go into all five colours, you're playing a couple of cards that don't quite complement your strategy (the signets are good, but I'm sure if you could have had a Wall of Blossoms instead you would have one), and you have more fixing in your deck than most draft seats usually see, let alone are able to pick. So I'm wary of taking pod because I don't think the deck comes together very often, not because the card doesn't have the power level."
lrcast,3cul5h,BonSequitur,2,Sat Jul 11 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like the problem with pod isnt that you can't make a good pod deck, it's that if you see pod halfway through pack 2, its too late to make a deck that even takes good advantage of it.   Also, for most decks, you can just play survival instead and have a similar effect as pod without having to draft around building your casting cost chains.  If I could pick up pod in middle of pack 1, I'll probably try to build the pod deck.  later than that I'll probably pass because it becomes too late in the draft to build around it and you can't just jam it into any ol' deck."
lrcast,3cul5h,sylverfyre,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:31:38 2015 UTC,That's more of a nonbasic lands deck than a Birthing Pod deck. Looks pretty fun.

lrcast,3cssm9,Tackman_,2,Fri Jul 10 17:46:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree. I feel like if I have a choice between Patron of the Valiant and Sentinel of the Eternal Watch, I'd take the Sentinel. Between it and the Angel, they're both great at parity and when you're ahead, but when you're behind, the Sentinel just does so much more to help you stabilize. Know how many non-rare creatures can beat the Sentinel in a straight-up fight? 3*, and only Skaab Goliath out of those is very playable.  *4 if you count Rhox Maulers with Renowned active."
lrcast,3cssm9,neofederalist,2,Fri Jul 10 18:22:39 2015 UTC,"She's also very hard to kill. 6 toughness is out of range of every non-X burn spells, vigilance protects her from Swift Reckoning, and aura-based removal like Suppression Bonds and Claustrophobia are just not the way to go.  I can imagine many decks having no answer at all to this card. In which case the best option is to race, but good luck doing that while getting your best creature tapped down every turn while the opponent has a 4/6 that can both attack and block."
lrcast,3cssm9,Tackman_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:38:27 2015 UTC,"Seems like black is going to have the only reactive answer to that card, putting aside blue wasting cards on bouncing it over and over again.  Red can nuke it after a block, but it still ends up going 2-for-1."
lrcast,3cssm9,Greyfeld,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:50:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can definitely see the Sentinel making it into the list of top white uncommons.  It may well be a tie with the Patron of the Valiant and Consul's Lieutenant.  It was a card I considered, and probably should have made it into my honorable mentions.  It is definitely a powerful card."
lrcast,3ct7cl,Malarazz,9,Fri Jul 10 16:05:03 2015 UTC,"Against an aggressive strategy, for example, a 0/x will not stop somebody from wanting to swing at you. If they're swinging with even just two creatures, they're still getting damage in without really losing their board state. This gets even worse as they have more and more creatures. A 2/2 for example, could at least deter some attacks more than a 0/x would or even offer a trade if you need to."
lrcast,3ct7cl,Curious_McNugget,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:08:20 2015 UTC,"But isn't there something to be said about an 0/4 blocking a 3/3 forever, while a 2/2 can only block another 2/2 but not a 3/3? Therefore saving you 1 life per turn? True, there's something to be said about trading with 3/2s and 3/1s, but there aren't that many of those."
lrcast,3ct7cl,pahamack,6,Fri Jul 10 16:11:03 2015 UTC,"Sure, but a 2/2 can win the game on an empty board. If you match your opponent card for card, but he floods out in the late game and you draw a 2/2, you win. If you draw a 0/6, it does nothing.  If you want a blocker, you'd rather have a 1/4, even if it costs 2 more mana. If the opponent has, say, a 3/3 and a 2/1, he has no attacks unless he has a trick. With a 0/6, he just attacks with both.  Is a 0/6 unplayable? No. Do you actively want it? No."
lrcast,3ct7cl,krdonnie,2,Fri Jul 10 16:29:28 2015 UTC,"At that point, its just a really narrow Sorcery-speed removal spell, like Defeat, right?"

lrcast,3ct7cl,Curious_McNugget,2,Fri Jul 10 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"While a 0/4 can block a 3/3 forever, 2 2/2s can do the same job (offering double blocks on the 3/3) and also offer trades with smaller guys. And the amount of 3/2s and 3/1s and such depends on the format of course. I know in DTK/DTK/FRF there are a lot of aggressive x/1s where some decks defending against them would prefer to have a [[Sultai Skullkeeper]] to block and trade over say, a [[Sidisi's faithful]]. What's great with offering a trade is that it can very much just stop people from attacking (at best of course. At worst you get rid of an aggressor or a combat trick early on.) and you may not take any damage at all in some cases versus having 0/x on the field, where there is no penalty for attacking into you.  /u/pahamack has a good point too, 2/2s also do things when the opponent happens to have a board you can swing into."

Now does it make sense why they aren't particularly liked?  Against a dedicated aggressive deck, it is going to gain you a lot of life, so that helps its case for coming in from the sideboard.  However against an average midrange deck it's just going to get outclassed and you can't afford to trade cards for life the way you can afford to against aggro decks.  Even against aggro decks its mostly good because it buys you time to play cards that DO trade."

lrcast,3ct7cl,BonSequitur,3,Fri Jul 10 16:40:26 2015 UTC,"A creature that just blocks is almost like half a card. If you're ahead, it's doing nothing; this is a problem in that you want your cards to press the advantage when you're ahead to close the door on your opponent, and a 0 power creature can't do that. They interact poorly with evasive creatures on the opponent's side of the board, because they can't race them. They turn on opposing tricks in a major way, often without doing the same for you, since many tricks don't do enough on a creature with no power. They can't meaningfully double block, which means they become outclassed more completely than other cards. An 0/4 can't be cashed in for half an opponent's card in the late game in the way a 2/2 usually can.  All this aside, you CAN play them in a very controlling deck, probably out of the sideboard; in Origins specifically, the fact that Yoked Ox will often trade for an opponent's real card because it's blanking a Renown creature is pretty decent. That still just puts it in the fringe playable category. Also, cards like that play towards board stall and prolonging the game. So the place to play them is in an extremely controlling deck with a very strong late game that is short on early game plays."

Development: Provides a blocker INCASE things go bad  Ahead: 0 value contributed  Behind: Might save you for a turn or two, but it still dies to removal, and even if you do stabalize your game state, this creature now becomes a useless defender you don't need anymore.  Parity: Nothing really gained. Doesn't hurt the board, but doesn't help you break ahead.  Every card in your deck should work towards a goal, and if you're build a deck with ""I just want to survive"" in mind, you're not building a deck with ""I want to bash in"" or ""I want to burn aggressively"" or ""I want to control his board state"" in mind. Everything you have goes towards building a purely defensible board.   A few people have mentioned Monestary Flock and I think that was the key. If you REALLY needed to not die, it helped you out a lot, but if you needed a creature to swing and do work for you, you morphed it and have a good card. That option simply doesn't exist with 0/Xs"

Board stalls: You want a way to break the stall, but this card does straight nothing to help you do that. Additionally, it doesn't make the stall any harder to break for your opponent.  Winning: 0 power means these guys don't help you push through any damage, so these do nothing here.  Losing: There's something to be said about being able to block their guys here, but as others have said it doesn't stop them from attacking.  As it turns out, these cards aren't particularly useful in any stage of the game. The scenarios you've mentioned are kind of the best-case for these guys, and if your opponent is playing 3/3's it kind of raises the question of why you aren't playing your own 3/3's or 2/4's."

In some variation of blue control he's a house -- does a great job of locking up the board against aggro decks, and when your opponent doesn't play anything, you can morph him and beat down with a 2/2.    Many games I won by beating my opponent to death with a 2/2 face-down Monastery Flock.    But a Yoked Ox?  You can't ever play it face down.  It's a Monastery Flock without any of the flexibility that made me love that card, and as such, it's just far worse."
lrcast,3ct7cl,CelestialBeekeeper,2,Fri Jul 10 18:25:19 2015 UTC,"The problem with a vanilla 0/4 is that they never deal damage and they never kill anything. They don't stop your opponents from attacking or threaten to trade. They just stop damage. In that sense, they're kind of similar to cards that are pure lifegain--they don't help you win the game, they just make you lose more slowly.  I think I first got in in Theros block when Brian mentioned Returned Phalanx as an example of what a good blocker is. Even if it can't attack, it comes down early and will offer a legitimate threat to blockers for the rest of the game. It won't block forever but it'll only die if your opponent uses a kill spell on it or it trades up, which is better than being able to block all day because your opponet is actually down a meaningful card.  All vanilla 0/Xs do is gain you a little bit of time by preventing some damage. Which isn't very good when you consider it also buys your opponent the same amount of time, but doesn't leave your opponent down a card."

Yes, they go on the board, but as others have mentioned, they don't attack or offer trades, they just offer pretty mediocre to bad 'removal'. The only advantage over removal spells is that they can wear auras or hold swords so if your deck has a bunch of those I guess you run these without being embarrassed.   I honestly don't think they are straight unplayable but I don't think you should be treating them as creatures. And as soon as you go there, in my experience, you often just have too many noncreatures anyway (though this might be only in my experience - I like spells too much :P).

This is a good situation for Touch.  But if you had even a +2/+2 trick, you eat them both and don't die. Gaining toughness is critical for a combat trick, because it turns it from a 2-for-X into a 1-for-X more often than not.   Additionally if it's a situation where your creatures are going to trade, the touch is useless. The situation where they buff their creature, it's only going to get a 2-for-2 instead of a possible 2-for-1.   The situations where this is good, other tricks are better.

lrcast,3cqgl0,sylverfyre,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"Cone/Rolling Thunder do it by being 2-for-1s, while cut does it while being murderously efficient in a slow format.  Swords to Plowshares would also be an A (in a typical limited format, cube has a lot more noncreature threats and its still great but not an A)  IMO, it's a combination of being murderously efficient and having no restrictions.  Ultimate Price and Roast are high Bs (best uncommon in the set) but while they're great on efficiency, their targeting restrictions are very real restrictions in the format (not being able to deal with the scariest cards in the format is a real issue) which is the main thing keeping them off the A-grade."
lrcast,3cqgl0,bearrosaurus,14,Fri Jul 10 17:45:28 2015 UTC,"Whoa dude. Comparing Murderous Cut to Rite of the Serpent would be like sticking Abzan Falconer next to Chimney Imp.  In a format where both sides of the board would have multiple 6 drops, Abzan Falconer was not the big star. The star is the 1-mana removal spell that kills 6 drops. IIRC Brian and Marshall knew the format was going to be slow, and turn into battlecruiser magic with lots of expensive creatures (morphs that you invest 8 mana into). An efficient, unconditional removal spell is a godsend.  Also, over time I think the standards for efficient creatures have gone up and the standards for removal have dropped like a rock. Go back in time some years, and the conventional wisdom was to always take Sengir Vampire over Doom Blade, and Serra Angel over Pacifism. With the newer development of sets, we go the other way.  P.S. Valley Dasher test wasn't a thing."
lrcast,3cqgl0,MrCorvus,3,Thu Jul 9 23:52:47 2015 UTC,"So while I think that you're mostly correct, and bring up a super interesting point with the last paragraph, I'm more arguing that the effect the murderous cut provides, is an effect that we can usually find, whereas A-level creatures are rarely going to get passed to you. Put the cut next to something like a Sagu Mauler or a High Sentinels.  Should I be taking fiery impulse over skysnare spider or patron of the valiant? This feels incorrect."
lrcast,3cqgl0,Carribi,6,Fri Jul 10 00:11:32 2015 UTC,"Should I be taking Fiery Impulse[3] over Skysnare Spider[4] or Patron of the Valiant[5] ? This feels incorrect.     No, but I'd probably take Unholy Hunger over them, or up near them anyway. It's a bit expensive. Murderous Cut was cheap and unconditional. A shock is cheap, but not really comparable."
lrcast,3cqgl0,sylverfyre,6,Fri Jul 10 00:30:47 2015 UTC,"Fiery impulse is also not nearly the removal spell Murderous Cut is.  Murderous Cut kills literally everything, and can absolutely lead to blowouts.  It isn't heard to think of a scenario where you're getting a 2 for 1 with Cut.  If you double block my creature, I can Cut one of the blockers.  If you play an aura, I can kill your creature before it even resolves.  Fiery impulse is instant speed, but it is nowhere as powerful and flexible as Murderous Cut, and I daresay that the effect on Cut is not an effect that is replaceable.  I will take Cut over literally every common and uncommon in the set.  I'll take it over half of the rares.  I'll splash it.  And I'll be so glad I have it.  Cheap, unconditional, instant speed removal is virtually nonexistent below rare, so getting it on an uncommon is, as one said before me, an absolute godsend."
lrcast,3cqgl0,bearrosaurus,4,Fri Jul 10 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"The thing about the format is that Cut often costs a single mana, and there are so many things to do with your mana in the format.  A turn 6 cut often is Cut for B, AND pay 5 to flip my guy up.  That's huge.    Playing 2 cards when your opponent is only playing 1 card is one of the most powerful things you can do in magic.  Most cheap removal spells - even the premium ones - have restrictions.  For example, Ultimate Price can't kill the dragonlords, but it's still the best uncommon in the set.  Murderous Cut has no such restriction.  It cares not that your creature is black, 3color, multicolor, whatever.  It's dead.  And often for 1-2 mana unless you want to spend more to conserve delve fuel - you'll generally pay whatever is leftover after the other spell you're playing that turn."
lrcast,3cqgl0,MTGCardFetcher,5,Fri Jul 10 00:39:56 2015 UTC,"I like you for questioning the reverence of removal (which some people overrate quite a bit). I think context is important. It's a cop-out answer, but it comes down to game impact.  In M14, shock was practically unplayable. Never killed anything important. In GTC, we took Mugging over any 5+ spell (outside of [[unbeatable bombs]]). Heck, someone at the Pro Tour took it over Domri Rade p1p1. The games were too fast-paced.  At a glance, I think Skysnare and Patron will have greater game impact than Fiery Impulse will. However, if RW Renown becomes a terror, then the 1 mana removal spell that simultaneously hoses and enables that deck is going to be extremely important."

lrcast,3cqgl0,fremeer,6,Fri Jul 10 00:52:09 2015 UTC,"Murderous cut, is similarly powerful when you're behind...   I think this is the hole in your analysis. Murderous Cut is vastly better when you are behind. If you are behind, Abzan Falconer can often be nothing more than a Vanilla 2/3 - you can't start putting counters on it until the next turn and even then you might not have time if you are behind.  Abzan Falconer is a very good card, but ""losing"" is definitely it's weakest quadrant, where it frankly is not very good at all (which is fine - very few 3 mana creatures are)."
lrcast,3cqgl0,fremeer,7,Fri Jul 10 05:54:40 2015 UTC,Cut is unconditional removal that is actually pretty undercosted at most points of the game you would use it.  The falconer is great and provides a threat but what happens when you put out a bigger threat. Sure u can put counters on but that still leaves it open to bounce and kills spells. This leads to tempo loss.   Cut will always be a 1 for 1 with their biggest threat and nearly always cost less then their biggest threat.   Instant speed unconditional Removal is more important then creatures because it can lead to 2 for 1 and tempo advantage at best and at worst you are usually killing their best creature.
lrcast,3cqgl0,UncleMeat,2,Thu Jul 9 23:24:58 2015 UTC,"So you would agree that cut is an 'A' level card?   The falconer is great and provides a threat but what happens when you put out a bigger threat. Sure u can put counters on but that still leaves it open to bounce and kills spells. This leads to tempo loss.   This is completely fine, no? They're spending resources to do this, this is just what generally happens in games of limited magic. Trading tempo is a part of 'figuring out the game plan'.   Instant speed unconditional Removal is more important then creatures because it can lead to 2 for 1 and tempo advantage at best and at worst you are usually killing their best creature.   So I'm trying to argue that Murderous Cut is a B or a B+, because the effect is generally replaceable, whereas something like a really solid creature (think A- level creature) is just sitting here winning the game, forcing your opponent to dig for outs, and play to specific draws. An effect that is much less replaceable."
lrcast,3cqgl0,tvkelley,6,Thu Jul 9 23:39:59 2015 UTC,It's easier to find a creature that puts your opponent on a clock then good removal.   Put it this way. If your opponent just played a 6/7 elephant and you were on the draw would u rather the falconer or the cut.  The falconer is a fine question with few answers. But the cut answers everything. That's rare and it's cheap when delve is paid. You can play the falconer and the cut on the same turn late game if they play the elephant in one turn. That's a big tempo play. Or even hold the cut till they attack or try to play a combat trick
lrcast,3cqgl0,Slypenslyde,2,Thu Jul 9 23:56:34 2015 UTC,Yeah that's a fair argument. Thanks for your input!
lrcast,3cqgl0,sevenduckies,3,Fri Jul 10 00:01:50 2015 UTC,"The effect definitely isn't replaceable. What other instant speed unconditional removal was there in khans? Abzan Charm and Sultai Charm were close, but they were a ton harder to cast, cost more, and sometimes couldn't get the job done. I remember dozens of situations where the only card in the set that could blow me out was Murderous Cut. That's because it often was a one mana unconditional removal spell. Nowadays that tends to cost five. It was just so much better than other removal spells that it deserved the rating."
lrcast,3cqgl0,quixotic_unicorn,4,Fri Jul 10 02:40:06 2015 UTC,"I passed a murderous cut in one draft, but that was only because I took a foil murderous cut over it. :)  And honestly, I still remember it because it was very unusual to pass it.  I passed many falconers, not really past pick 3-4 in a pack but it's really just a dude that can be blocked or killed.  I know best case it wins games out of nowhere in the right deck, and it was clearly a premium card in the format, but cut is ""kill any dude for one mana"" which is why it's played in constructed and falconer is unplayable.    Also in context of that set, there was very little removal (-4/-4 for five in black, kill an attacker/blocker in white, a few other things), and this was at the top.  Falconer was probably the 30th best creature in the set? (I have no idea, I just know the list is long before you get to it.)  tldr; cut is premium removal (easy A), falconer is a very good creature (easy B, maybe B+?)."
lrcast,3cqgl0,Nizzahon,4,Thu Jul 9 23:40:34 2015 UTC,"It's not like there's only 1 A in a set, and you have to reject other cards in order to take that one A.  I like the Murderous Cut vs. Abzan Falconer comparison. In a vacuum, it's a very hard pick. Falconer is one of the best 3-drop creatures, and it's not likely you're going to get more like it. But Murderous Cut is one of the best removal spells, and is an answer to more things than Abzan Falconer. Be careful with the quadrants, I feel like they are ranked ""losing > parity > development > winning"".  The only phase of the game where Falconer is better than Murderous Cut is ""early development"", turns 1-4. Usually development stops at 5, and that's where Falconer isn't so exciting. Playing it on 5 is late, you want it on 3 and to be able to Outlast twice, though that means you won't be properly curving. So it's also best if your opponent isn't aggro. If you get there, you have a 4/5 flyer and can at least trade for a lot of common threats, though you'd better hope there's not a Pine Walker or Canyon Lurkers on the table. Murderous Cut isn't expected to be played at all until 5, and it answers the creatures that Falconer can't answer.  I feel like in every other quadrant, you were losing anyway in the situations where Falconer and Murderous Cut have equal value, and it's hard to imagine Falconer being better very often.   In all parity states, Murderous Cut threatens to either break the parity, or destroy their topdeck when they find it. Falconer can only help you if the opponent has a small board, no answers to evasion, no removal, and/or you can afford a few Outlast turns.  In all losing states, Murderous Cut takes care of the creature that is the biggest threat or prevents your opponent from further board development. Falconer is best if your opponent has small creatures. If their table is a lot of 3 or more power creatures, it's going to block one round of damage because you won't have time to Outlast. In all winning states, Murderous Cut helps you either slam the door harder by removing a blocker or gives you insurance against a topdeck creature that changes the game. Falconer makes the clock 2 damage faster with evasion, which isn't nothing, but doesn't do anything if the morph they played last turn flips up as something that halts your attack.   They're both good cards that impact the game. Choosing between the two is difficult, and depends on what your deck needs. If I'm light on creatures, and I already have a Throttle, I'd be hard pressed to pick between the two and would probably pick the Falconer. But if I had no other removal, I want the Murderous Cut. There's too many threats Falconer can't address.  There's no comparison to Rite of the Serpent, having it ready on-time is a lot harder. I haven't had many games where I couldn't cast Murderous Cut and a creature spell on the same turn, but it's harder to imagine doing so with Rite of the Serpent. It's sorcery speed, so I can't do tricks like waiting for them to cast a Become Immense or other expensive pump before killing their creature. It has Delve, so my opponent's never sure if I can cast it. It's just all-around fantastic, and it's hard to imagine any creature that's as versatile.  Unless the opponent has Sagu Mauler. Freakin' Hexproof."
lrcast,3cqgl0,Nizzahon,2,Fri Jul 10 13:31:09 2015 UTC,This is a great analytical breakdown. Thanks!
lrcast,3cqgl0,yavimaya_eldred,3,Fri Jul 10 16:38:31 2015 UTC,"Falconer is a very good creature, yes. I don't want to deny that. Landing a Falconer on a board where you already have some +1/+1 counters makes you feel awesome, and its worst case scenario (a 2/3 for 3) is still fine. However, in order to make it a real ""threat"" you need to do some other work - take a turn off to outlast, have a spell that provides counters, something like that. Whereas, the floor on Murderous Cut is higher - it will always kill a relevant creature.  Rite of the Serpent as a ""replacement"" for Murderous Cut is not even worth the argument, in my opinion. It's more expensive, sorcery-speed and harder to cast. I'd rather take the Murderous Cut knowing that I could end up with a creature almost as good as a Falconer than take the Falconer counting on getting a terrible replacement for Murderous Cut."
lrcast,3cqgl0,priceQQ,3,Thu Jul 9 23:37:42 2015 UTC,"I think you've generated some really great discussion in this thread, so I would like thank you for that.  I think the exemplary performance in every Quadrant is what knocks Cut a grade above a very solid, efficient creature Falconer (which I would argue is pretty poor when you're losing to a full board).  If used properly, it can single-handedly close out or turn around a game in your favor.  It even helps in development by hindering your opponent for minimal cost and possesses flexibility in its casting cost to maximize your resources.  In general, efficient, instant removal spells expose exceedingly more 2-for-1 scenarios while forcing you to give up very little to maximum it's value (using another resource through the Delve mechanic).  And it's absolute floor is removing a legitimate threat from your opponent usually at minimal cost to you.  Cards like Unholy Hunger, on the other hand, miss the efficiency grade boost (comes down after turn 5) and require more setup and opportunity cost (doing nothing for a turn with this in hand doesn't feel very good)."
lrcast,3cqgl0,sylverfyre,2,Fri Jul 10 16:38:26 2015 UTC,"I think something you're missing is that there are more creatures available that are lets say 70 or 80 percent of the best creatures you can draft, whereas there is a much more finite amount of removal, and an even more finite amount of premium removal. Because of that, prioritizing removal is pretty important.  Even if you have a deck filled with great creatures, if your opponent drops one of the bombs in the format you're just toast.  You need to have a way to deal with threats."
lrcast,3cqgl0,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"I think the key here is balancing between efficiency and condition when it comes to rating removal. Obviously if you have B- tier removal and a B+ level creature, you're going to take the creature everytime you do a P1P1. Prioritizing isn't general something I have issues with, it's more evaluating removal and when some removal is mediocre and other removal is clearly premium and coveted. My post is less ""Murderous cut vs. Falconer, P1P1"", and more ""How is it that spot removal can receive the coveted 'A' tier"" which is generally reserved for bombs, extremely value removal (Rolling thunder or Cone of Flame come to mind). If you look at it from my perspective, as someone who traditionally rates 5-mana instant speed removal as mediocre but necessary, it's easy to see how I could get to a B+ rating on Murderous Cut and once cut is at a B+ it's much much closer to the Abzan Falconer. Hope that makes sense!"
lrcast,3cqgl0,phasmy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:44:52 2015 UTC,"The thing is that murderous cut is pretty typically ""B - Destroy Target Creature"" in KTK-KTK-FRF.  You're right, 5 mana to remove a creature (Turn to Dust for example) is kind of a middling removal spell, but B or 1B to destroy a creature at instant speed (see: Ultimate Price as well) is definitely an A because it is so much better than those 5 mana removal spells you mentioned."

Bellower finds the same targets as Co-Co and provides similar card advantage, but it doesn't fit at all into a coco deck and is much more expensive and not instant speed.  For big green, genesis hydra, for the most part, is doing a similar job better.  Hydra can find anything you hit (like Xenagos walker, a legendary creature, or just something bigger than 3 mana) the effect can't be countered (on cast trigger) and just feels like theres too much overlap.  See the Unwritten has a lot of the same potential in ""big green"" as well.  Bellower wants to be in a big green deck but it's tutoring small things.  You don't want to wait til turn 5-6 to tutor up a courser (though maybe a replacement courser) and there aren't that many ""silver bullets"" that create great advantageous situations that make up for the mana spent on this guy."

lrcast,3coi54,pahamack,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:03:44 2015 UTC,Coldsnap was built on playing multiples of the same card (it's the only small set built to be drafted by itself). It's a ridiculous format.

If you happen to be the only person in green and get 6+ Timberpack Wolves you will have a very fun draft.  There is a whole cycle of cards that get better when you have more copies in your deck.
lrcast,3coi54,kuaggie,3,Thu Jul 9 16:46:39 2015 UTC,Hey at least you're not the guy first-picking basic lands in draft just so he can have enough lands in his deck to maybe have 1 in his opening hand :P

The more common example is a Mind Sculpt deck, where you have a decent shot of hitting 5x if you wheel two in pack 1. But again, that strategy is considered pretty weak."

lrcast,3cp7vv,Andy-J,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:39:02 2015 UTC,Really? Renowned is a very aggressive mechanic. You want to play creatures on curve and attack early and often while trying to force damage through with combat tricks. The exact opposite of control.  Perhaps you're thinking of tempo.
lrcast,3cp7vv,KillerPacifist1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:37:12 2015 UTC,"I never play 100 percent control, so yeah I guess I usually play tempo/midrange and just consider it control haha. I usually play aggressive Timmy styles so any control seems very slow to me."
lrcast,3cp7vv,Andy-J,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:49:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people often confuse tempo and control because they both have a lot of cards that interact with and disrupt their opponent, but they are fundamentally different in how they want to win and what type of cards they want to run.  For example, bounce spells are terrible in control decks but are often very good in tempo lists."

lrcast,3cp7vv,Xelnastoss,3,Thu Jul 9 21:48:34 2015 UTC,"Red because it appears to me to have the least variation in terms of card quality in its commons and uncommons, and aggro in sealed can just mow people over who build durdle machines. It also means less draws."

I'm not sure if Marshall and LSV or Brian stopped doing this a set review or two ago and I just didn't notice/forgot, but I do know that they used to do a little overview of the colours. Just a ""so that's the White cards, what do you think of the colour?"" and they could talk about how deep the colour was, whether it looked particularly slow or aggressive, etc.  This isn't some major complaint or anything, god knows I was almost checking out after five hours so I can't imagine how Marshall and LSV felt, but I did miss those little discussions. They were good bookends, and provided bit of a breather instead of diving right into the next colour.  Unrelated: I'm pretty impressed how quickly the video went up.

lrcast,3cnlbw,Suedars,6,Thu Jul 9 22:00:55 2015 UTC,"Noob Question:  Why do we evaluate cards in terms of general playability, instead of in terms of whether they function as they should in a deck that wants them?  For example, Marshall and LSV gave Mage Ring Bully a low rating basically because it is small, and must attack every turn. In my mind, the only deck you play that card in is one that WANTS small creatures swinging every turn, i.e. Some kind of red aggro. Prowess is tasty gravy. What am I missing?"
lrcast,3cnlbw,black_harkness,21,Thu Jul 9 14:28:36 2015 UTC,"We try and give as much context as possible. For this card specifically, it's fairly bad even in an aggressive deck, which is why it gets such a low grade."
lrcast,3cnlbw,LSV__,5,Thu Jul 9 16:05:49 2015 UTC,"While I haven't listened yet, I can say that they give the letter grades as a starting point and then discuss the card from there. Even in the deck that ""wants"" cards like this there will likely be games where you aren't the beat down and this card is a blank of you are losing or at parity. Although I haven't read much about this set I am willing to bet there is a better replacement than this for most if not all decks."
lrcast,3cnlbw,enterthereckoner,5,Thu Jul 9 14:41:01 2015 UTC,"Even in a deck that wants to be attacking every turn, a 2/2 with no abilities is likely better than a 2/2 prowess that must attack.  The ability to build up your board for an all-in final attack is very important, as is the ability to play defensively while you wait to draw Chandra's Fury for those final few points to the face."
lrcast,3cnlbw,scook0,0,Fri Jul 10 05:23:52 2015 UTC,I just think of it as a set it and forget it 2/2 turret that gets meaner when I play a noncreature spell.   I guess there could be better spells for two. I'd certainly rather have three lightning strikes than three of that guy...
lrcast,3cnlbw,black_harkness,3,Fri Jul 10 15:46:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but what if your opponent plays a 2/3 and you don't have the spell?"
lrcast,3cnlbw,beepbloopbloop,0,Sun Jul 12 14:44:25 2015 UTC,"Then my 2/2 was dead anyway. Aggressive decks lose to big butts...but, if I do have a strike, I blank his dude and swing for three instead of two."
lrcast,3cnlbw,black_harkness,3,Sun Jul 12 19:06:52 2015 UTC,"Having a 2/2 is HUGE even if your opponent has a 3/3. You can draw a trick later, double block, alpha strike, act of treason, falter, or more to make that 2/2 important later."

Turn.); eventually they're just going to put some dork in front of it and trade (best case for you) or they'll sit some 2/X>2 guy in its way and make you have the spell. The reason it gets evaluated the way it does is because it needs a lot of things to go right for it to work effectively, whereas other cards are just more consistent. A big part of competitive Magic is the buildup of small incremental advantages over time. If a weaker creature is on average better by even 1-4%, then over the course of many matches that percentage builds, and your overall performance is better. That's why the show tends to advocate for the more consistent approach versus the more explosive or flashy outcomes. Given the choice between a card with high variance (the Bully) or lower ceiling but more consistency (say an average 2/2), the latter is almost always preferred in a vacuum."
lrcast,3cnlbw,shinianx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:47:18 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't you say that a vacuum is never the case?

lrcast,3cnlbw,black_harkness,2,Wed Jul 15 20:11:57 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure; the inherent problem with card rankings is that they can't take into account what your actual pool looks like. Everything really sits on a sliding scale. There are indeed some decks that will really want a prowess 2/2 creature for two mana. The rankings just give you a way to gauge all the initial contents of a pack against each other, hence, in a 'vacuum'. They tend to get thrown out once you know what kind of deck your seat wants you to draft. That being said, the rating of a card is also useful in determining if a color is open, based on how late a high-ranking card reaches your seat. A Mage-Ring Bully is going to come around late almost every time because not many decks are going to want it."
lrcast,3cnlbw,shinianx,3,Thu Jul 16 00:45:21 2015 UTC,"If you compare that card to something even as mediocre as 2/1 for 2 and consider that each has downsides as well as their upsides. The bully has a much higher ceiling as well as a much lower floor. The piker is more flexible in that it can also attack early, though not as well but can also hang back and block if needed later. Both end up somewhere in the mediocre range since you don't always get what you want out of the bully and the piker is consistent though unexciting."

lrcast,3cnlbw,DollarBizz,2,Mon Jul 13 19:42:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, they were really divided on Shadows of the Past.   On the one hand I feel like it's something that should work as a build-around-me card, but the fact that you can't really take advantage of multiple creatures dying at the same time really blows.  I think I disagree with Marshall about this being complete garbage. I think you can safely play one in a black deck or any control deck splashing black and you have some form of inevitability.  Once you have it on the board, you're actively looking to trade creatures. It even hints at that in the second ability. Any way you can get into an attrition war helps you because you're going to be drawing more gas faster than your opponent and they have to attack into your creatures now. If you're behind on the board, you can feel a little bit better about chumping or double blocking with your creatures. If you're ahead, this can keep you ahead in case of a removal spell or it just gives you a backup plan.  Any other two drop in your deck will not have as much of an impact over the course of a game as this card, and once you've scryed 3-4 cards into your deck, you've gotten your mana's worth.   I'm starting to like this card. It's such a slow drip from of card advantage that it's going to win you the game before anyone notices."
lrcast,3cnlbw,taptapuntap,2,Fri Jul 10 16:36:10 2015 UTC,"My personal rating on Shadows of the Past varies wildly depending on whether I woke up on my left or right side in the morning, what I ate that morning, and if I have something stuck in my teeth.  It's a really hard card to figure out."
lrcast,3cnlbw,shinianx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:04:43 2015 UTC,"This feels a lot like a cost-shifted Caustic Tar. You get to play it much earlier, and it provides you tiny bits of advantage over the course of the game. Then, when you're both in topdeck mode, it gives you something to do if you blank on more land. It seems unlikely that you'd be able to pay its activation twice in a turn, but hey, I've hit ten or more lands before, so I suppose it's possible. I think the hosts have compared being able to Scry for 2 or more to be the equivalent of drawing a card, and this promises to allow for at least that. I wanted to say that this card belongs in a controllish build, but that might not be correct; maybe you really want this in a more aggressive build with tons of creatures, to ensure you're trading and getting value from the Scry trigger. That helps you dig for more gas as your army diminishes, and in the end, it helps you reach for those last few points of life your initial aggression was unable to finish off."
lrcast,3cnlbw,taptapuntap,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:38:00 2015 UTC,"Caustic Tar   That's an interesting comparison. I've never played Caustic Tar in limited, but on first glance it doesn't seem like something I want to include in my 6-drop slot.  I don't think [[Shadows of the Past]] fits in an aggressive strategy. You want to be able to play your 2/3/4 drop creatures on curve so you can establish your board. Read the Bones is the far better card if you're aggressive because you simply draw the extra cards/threats at a cost of two life.  I'm thinking if you're building a shadows deck you're going for cards like Fetid Imp/Pharika's Disciple for deathtouch, Fleshbag Marauder (for edicts), Nantuko Husk (sac outlets), Returned Centaurs to mill your deck and a couple of Macabre Waltz to get back the 1-2 bombs you've picked up if you've traded or milled them. You're going see so many more cards than your opponent over the course of a game."

lrcast,3cnlbw,shinianx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:20:42 2015 UTC,"In the format it was available in, Caustic Tar was sometimes an acceptable end-game card that was very hard to deal with. The risks are apparent, you're paying six mana to essentially do nothing until you untap (else you're waiting another turn so you can play it with seven lands out), but after that you were putting them on a very steep clock they couldn't really interact with.     But yes, I understand that an aggro deck wants to prioritize board development turns 1-4, and taking the second turn off to play Shadows of the Past hurts pretty badly. On the other hand, it's definitely not bad play on turn four if you can pair it up with another two drop, or on five with a three. In either case, casting it before combat means that anything that trades is going to help you dig to keep the pressure on. Time will tell if that's something the strategy wants or can even sustain. I do like the skeleton you outlined above though; there are a lot of cards that have inherent synergy with Shadows of the Past that it does seem like a viable build-around me card."
lrcast,3cnlbw,davekayaus,2,Wed Jul 15 18:07:46 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking Shadows of the Past is a C+ for me. I'll play it more often than not if I'm in black, and that Scry 1 adds up over time.   The second ability is gravy."

I listened to it (and then watched it) and I was able to construct a deck fairly well by just sorting through all my Fs and Ds and picking only decent stuff for the pre-release.   Sure I went 2-2, but for a guy who literally never gets a chance to play I consider that pretty decent!"
lrcast,3cnlbw,johnts03,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:13:36 2015 UTC,"I'm confused about the high rating of Zendikar's Roil. Compare it to Ojutai's Summons from DTK, which was strong but not insane. Summons is a 2/2 the turn you play it and a guaranteed one next turn, and they have flying. Best case, Roil also gets you two 2/2s in two turns (if you play it on turn 6 and then play a land), but without the flying, and this best case is far from guaranteed. Not sure that the possible upside of even more bears later makes up for it, for me."
lrcast,3cnlbw,Roogovelt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:13:43 2015 UTC,you think getting two 2/2s in 2 turns is best case?  Hmmm
lrcast,3cnlbw,Suedars,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:45:09 2015 UTC,"Zendikar's Roil is amazing later in the game when you're in topdeck mode because you have much fewer dead draws since every land you draw gives you a free 2/2. On a stalled board, it's not unusual to think you can get 3-4 creatures out of it. Protecting against one of the drawbacks of mana flood is a real upside."
lrcast,3cnlbw,Roogovelt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:48:32 2015 UTC,"I’m surprised to hear such low grades for Dark Dabbling. It says “draw a card” on it, so it’ll generally be card advantage. Your opponent thought you were trading in combat? Nope, pay three and win combat without using a card. Opponent thought they were killing your guy with a removal spell? Nope, free card for you.  You won’t get to take down huge creatures like you could with Necrobite, but you’re going to gain card advantage a fairly large percentage of the time you cast this.  I'm curious what other peoples' evaluation of Dark Dabbling is."
lrcast,3cnlbw,Suedars,6,Thu Jul 9 20:58:37 2015 UTC,"3 mana is a lot to play for a trick that doesn't boost your guy, is the issue."
lrcast,3cnlbw,Roogovelt,2,Thu Jul 9 22:01:26 2015 UTC,"It's very interesting to me that so many people feel that way. You're right that 3 mana is too much for that effect, but getting a card back is huge. I see this card and immediately think ""2-for-1,"" and I don't think it's unreasonable to think that'll be the outcome a lot of the time you cast this. LSV gives Dark Dabbling a 2 on his CFB review, but Hydrolash a 3. They seem very close to me, and I would guess it's easier to get a 2-for-1 off your Dark Dabbling than with Hydrolash.  Counterpoint: LSV is a much better Magic player than I am."
lrcast,3cnlbw,Greyfeld,2,Fri Jul 10 00:30:00 2015 UTC,"Hydroslash is a lot more flexible though and serves more functions since it can swing races, cycle and gain you some life, or enable an even bigger blowout than a 2 for 1. Dabbling on the other hand requires a much more specific set of circumstances to do anything."
lrcast,3cnlbw,Jack_Donaghy45,2,Fri Jul 10 03:26:38 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying -- and it's definitely true that Hydrolash will occasionally be even better than a 2-for-1. I don't think my evaluation is that much different than other folks' seems to be, but I'm not sure Hydrolash is more flexible than Dark Dabbling.   With Dabbling you're hoping to cast it (1) when you would otherwise be trading in combat, (2) in response to a removal spell, or (3) in response to a combat trick that would lead to you losing your creature. Any of those (relatively common) situations can lead to a 2-for-1.  With Hydrolash to get a 2-for-1 you're looking for combat situations that would be trades, but won't be if the opponents' creatures' power is reduced by 2. Sure, that happens, but I think that's a much more narrow application than Dabbling. With Hydrolash you get a cycling fog-ish effect as well, which is definitely valuable, but it seems harder to set up 2-for-1s.  I don't think that Hydrolash is bad (quite the opposite actually), or that Dark Dabbling is better than Hydrolash necessarily, just that Dabbling is closer to Hydrolash than Marshal and LSV seem to think."
lrcast,3cnlbw,dhet,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:26:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was surprised about that too.  I mean, I don't think the average usage of this card is all that far removed from the average usage of [Center Soul], which may be a mana cheaper, but also has a lower ceiling (IMO)."

lrcast,3cor24,procumbo,0,Thu Jul 9 15:42:28 2015 UTC,"In my very limited experience playing 2HG, I've noticed a good strategy is for both people to go the same color, since the color really only determines the color of 7 cards in any given pool. So then it makes sense to go the color that wants a critical mass of spells in that color to function well, and the color that says that the most for me is white. Then build one outrageously strong primarily white deck and the other deck has 4 colors worth of cards from two pools to choose from, which will function very well as a control deck."
lrcast,3cor24,Ghastall,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:29:45 2015 UTC,"Nah, this is the exact opposite of what you want. In these prerelease sealed, you get effectively 13 packs of playables. That is more than you get in team sealed. You will have such an overabundance of playables in one of the decks that you'll find yourself at 35 cards before starting to cut, its an insanely large sealed pool.   Basically, choose different colors, build one deck with answers, lategame and an ability to hold up counterspells for their bombs (which they will have awesomely plenty of). Flyer-only removal is the same as premium removal.   My pick for colors would be black and red, building a red-blue spells deck with burn and counters, and then either blackwhite enchantress or blackgreen beef depending on the pool.  Always keeping mana open enables you alot of play options than your opponents, and allows you to get the highest skill edge out of deck construction and play. Because you can both commit to the board and keep mana open in 2HG, you should do so."
lrcast,3cor24,Hainen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:04:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm mostly on the same page with Hainen here. I think doubling up one color will make you too deep in that color, forcing you to cut good playables while your other deck is thin. Like he said, they give you a ton of packs in this format.  You'll probably want to build two two-color decks, covering four colors total. That seems like it will give you the best balance of consistency and being able to play most of your best cards.  Also a good point on leaving mana open. One card to keep an eye on is Bone to Ash. Mediocre normally, but should be great in 2HG. I would play two in a blue deck. On the flip side, cards that are vulnerable to counterplay (e.g., Knightly Valor) are much worse in 2HG."
lrcast,3cor24,KillerPacifist1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:40:21 2015 UTC,"Something else to keep in mind is to build the two decks so that they play at relatively the same speed. One of the most common mistakes I see in 2HG is that one player will try to build an aggro deck while the other will try to build a control deck.  What ends up happening is that in the early game the aggro deck is essentially playing a 2v1 game as the control deck gets set up, then runs out of gas, leaving the control deck to 2v1 in the late game.  I would suggest building two midrange decks, with perhaps slightly staggered speeds, with one focusing on big dudes and board presence and the other focusing on value."

On the plus side the enchantment theme has nearly if not more cards as the Thopter theme, so the density is there, despite the downside of not working so well on their own, unlike the Choppers squad. With small stores it's of course tough to get the same color pack on both days, unless you registered in advance once the reg period got open. By the way, outside of Choppers, I think red best pairs with white."

lrcast,3cp8mx,carpeamentum,2,Thu Jul 9 20:40:09 2015 UTC,"I like it. I think in general the power level is high enough and the themes diverse enough that you can do a lot of exciting things and take advantage of cool interactions without there being one degenerate deck that takes over.

I guess planeswalkers are more the wincons, that produce value"

I think jace is a high pick, elspeth is a a pretty high pick.   its one of those things that sometimes doesn't quite get there, like if you don't have any non-targeting removal and they start hitting you with inkwell leviathan"

No one can come into a draft with a built in advantage by having a better deck.   I remember losing multiple games to a guy at my lgs in both modern and standard due to his 2000 dollars worth of cards vs my jank.  We then drafted and his deck was horrible. He really didn't know how to build a solid deck and his gameplay was terrible. This was all invisible when his cards outshone mine in constructed"

If you only make $20 a week I might suggest you spend it on something other than magic? (Oh, maybe you are young and live with parents? I guess I can see that then).  Anyway what I like about limited is that everyone is on an even playing field at the start of a draft/sealed event. I don't need to worry about examining the meta game, or the fact that the deck I really want to play would cost me another $200 I don't have/don't want to spend, or that a bunch of new, expensive cards just came out I want to try in my modern deck that are hard to find and/or expensive.  One thing you could do is play limited and then look to trade standard staples you open for your elves deck (though someplace like Pucatrade perhaps)."

You can go into drafting with $0 in Magic cards and make a competitive deck every time.  There is also a lot more space for innovation in draft.  In constructed, maybe an occasional rogue deck appears, but mostly it is all about Tier One, and everyone is playing the same handful of decks (although to be fair, it is more than a handful in Modern), and that just gets boring to me.  I have drafted DTK-DTK-FRF almost 100 times, and only now I am starting to get a bit tired of the format."

lrcast,3cok5s,lnt_,3,Thu Jul 9 15:53:48 2015 UTC,"It's the only competitive form of magic that requires every participant to build their own deck. I enjoy planning out and building decks. Limited tests more dimensions of skill. Play skill, deck-building, card evaluation. No two matches are the same. Fewer games are decided by rock-paper-scissors matchups or silver bullet sideboard cards. Budget, but for a different reason than others have said. I have the budget and commitment level to own some serious eternal decks, but most of my friends don't. Limited lets us play on an even footing regardless of budget or their knowledge of older cards. Cube is the best way to play Magic, and you need to understand limited deeply to play cube well. Opening packs is fun."

lrcast,3cok5s,MisadventuresPodcast,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:46:46 2015 UTC,"I think you'll get a lot of similar responses!  I like trying to collect playsets, and I'd have to win constructed to leave with cards. Drafting lets me build a collection while I'm playing. I also tend to manage my money better in small increments rather than lump sums. So while a budget constructed deck might long-term let me play Magic more cheaply, having $50-$100 ready for each rotation to update my deck is harder than having $25-$30 ready for a prerelease.  I also like the variety. If I build a constructed deck, that's my deck. If it turns out bad in my local meta, it'll be a while before I have the cash to switch to a better deck, so I'll likely be playing to win by luck alone week after week. In draft, it's just as likely I'll get a trainwreck as a winner, and in many ways I feel like skill puts a floor on how bad your deck can be (ignoring some incredibly unlucky but possible pack layouts.) Some weeks I'll have no chance, other weeks I'll have decks that forgive some mistakes. I like that."
lrcast,3cok5s,MisadventuresPodcast,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:54:21 2015 UTC,"I don't have the time to make competitive decks, even against what my friends are cooking up. I like to show up somewhere, create a deck with the tools in front of me, and compete against decks that are on a level playing field.

lrcast,3cok5s,LancesAKing,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:11:45 2015 UTC,"Re: budget I find it easier to go infinite drafting at my local shop than MTGO. Yes, the prize support is a lot less than in an 8-4, but cards you open are worth a lot more. Also, the competition is a LOT worse. If I was in such a tight financial situation I'd be aiming at maximizing my profits. There are podcasts and article series dedicated to MTG finance.  If I was making so little money I wouldn't be spending my money drafting though. There ARE free online ways to draft. They don't work as well as MTGO and the competition isn't as good, but it's a way to practice. Otherwise, you're gonna have to binder grind and win a good chunk of your matches to finance your hobby."

lrcast,3cok5s,daveclarkeart,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:03:31 2015 UTC,"I'll try to help. If you're new to drafting he used a lot of lingo you may not be aware of.   ""to go infinite"" means that on average you win more than it costs to play, so you can essentially play for free. It's what a lot of drafters strive for. Prize support refers to what you can win from the tournament, or how Wizards of the Coast gives packs to stores for tournament winners to earn.  Mtgo is magic online, in case you didn't know that, and 8-4 refers to the draft tournaments on mtgo where the first place winner gets 8 packs and second place gets 4. (see how if you buy 3 packs, and won 8, you can play 2 more tournaments for free?) But he's saying he does better at a local store and the cards are worth more then digital counterparts.  He goes on to say if you have so little money, your goal should be to get competitive, find free ways to draft (i don't know what those are though), and then after you are good you can try playing at your local stores.  All in the name of saving money however you can, because this game is expensive.  I'm not really sure how well his response deals with you're question, but there it is."
lrcast,3cok5s,jetanders,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:35:30 2015 UTC,"sorry about that. Too much lingo, which i mistakenly assumed was common knowledge.  I was responding to the second part of the original post, which deals with finances. Magic is an expensive game, especially if you're not really working yet.   I used to use apprentice/Magic workstation when I was still a student, and there's ways to play constructed and even limited with those tools, but I believe there might be better ways now. Just google ""free online mtg draft"" and you'll see some options. I know some members of this community use those, because sometimes people post screenshots from non-mtgo computer programs.  Personally, I think it's going to be very hard to  be better than opponents who play a lot more magic. Practice just makes so much of a difference."

As for saving money I do a pretty good job of it (since I wanted to invest into paint balling but magic just seemed better) and I dont have mtgo nor do I know how to get tickets in that game to draft.I think he means by draft is to go to a simulator and pick the best cards.

Stalwart Aven in particular is one of the best white commons at 1/3 renown flying for 3 mana. Fliers are not as plentiful in this set as in dtk, so this easily becomes 2/4 flying for 3, which blocks almost everything and is a decent clock. Knight of pilgrim'so road also is better than 2.0, at 3/2 for 3 mana this is already about average for white which doesn't get 3/3s at this cost, but renown is a huge upside if you get in once.  Knightly Valor is also an excellent card, you had to have played rtr to understand its power, where it was a top pick in white. auras leave you open to 2 for 1s normally, but this card starts at a 2 for 1 if it resolves."

I just saw no point in drafting it if Khans of Tarkir was the format I preferred, and it was also in the payout that I prefer.  If DTK had been in 6-2-2-2, I would have played there because I like to keep up with the current format, but I just didn't have enough reasons to play DTK when I had so many reasons to play KTK."

lrcast,3ck3h4,Demolishing,4,Wed Jul 8 15:08:08 2015 UTC,"Priest of the blood rite at 3.5? That guy is a bomb surely. A 5/5 flier for 5 is already bomb level and this has upside (and downside, but not a big deal)  I think he also overrated undead servant. I think you need 3 of them for them to be playable. And at 4 mana it's not a situation where you can shove a tonne of them in without ruining your curve."
lrcast,3ck3h4,sh58,3,Wed Jul 8 16:05:42 2015 UTC,"Not to mention it's only really draft where Undead Servent even has the chance to shine. In sealed you're typically going to have about 1 of these guys, occasionally 2, and it's just not worth playing at those numbers (unless you just need filler creatures)."
lrcast,3ck3h4,tjtillman,5,Wed Jul 8 16:13:42 2015 UTC,"LSV does his set reviews with draft in mind. He will sometimes write an extra sentence or two to take into consideration for sealed, but the ratings are for draft."
lrcast,3ck3h4,myRlad,2,Wed Jul 8 17:57:59 2015 UTC,"Priest of the blood rite really gets a 4 at most. A bomb should be something that gives you a significant advantage every time your play it. It always affects the game, and always in your favor  Opening or Developing: Great at developing the board  Behind: Not really what you want when you're down and really need an out, unless you have a way to deal with the priest as well and keep the demon without getting blown out  Parity: Still good, but this still depends on where you are at. If you're both at 5 life this could win you the game, unless they have air-blockers to hold the demon back. That being said, this has a solid chance of turning the game in your favor. With a bounce spell you can even abuse the priest and get 10 power in the air  Winning: Perfect for closing out a game and making sure your opponent doesn't have answers  The card is great in many situations, but when I'm losing, or if I'm at parity with low enough life, I don't want to see this card, and that takes it away from being a bomb. Is it strong? No doubt, but there are times I'm going to draw this and wish I'd pulled Necromantic Summons (or another 3- card) instead"
lrcast,3ck3h4,CelticStag,4,Wed Jul 8 16:31:43 2015 UTC,"Unless you are super low on life, this does a great job stabilising. 2 bodies to block, 1 of which is completely expendable and the other being probably the biggest thing on the battlefield.  I don't think you can make an argument that a card isn't a bomb because you'd rather have a removal spell sometimes. You could easily craft a situation where you'd rather have twin bolt than citadel siege, but that doesn't mean twin bolt is a better card"
lrcast,3ck3h4,sh58,2,Wed Jul 8 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"When you are losing, if all this does is stops their attacks (rather than allow you to swing for 5 in the air, like when the demon needs to stay back and block) then they are still essentially swinging for 2 every tunr which means you need a follow up yet again, where true bombs just come down and stabilize you(think ornitharch, Grave titan etc.) and you do not need a follow up, that's what lowers this from 4/4.5 to 3.5."
lrcast,3ck3h4,wilydanyeah45,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:27:19 2015 UTC,"Man, Ornitharch is a terrible example, since in the situation where you have to use it to play defense it's clearly just worse than the Priest.  The Priest is a better blocker than you think it is because you get two bodies out of it. Now, if you're forced to use both to prevent attacks, then yeah, that's not great, but you were losing that game anyway. The advantage is that you get a chumper that your opponent probably doesn't want to kill while you have a big creature to actually do the job of winning the game with.  After all, if you play your big fatty and it just blocks, that's not really that good. Maybe it helps keep you alive, but it's a tenuous situation that, as you say, requires additional follow ups to really pull you out of it. So much better is when you play a creature that can actually win the game while maybe buying you enough time to do it."
lrcast,3ck3h4,Sceptilesolar,2,Wed Jul 8 22:47:54 2015 UTC,"Ornitharch is not the best example but replace that with Cloud goat ranger or Rakshasa Gravecaller or Bestial Menace or even Trostani's summoner etc.  Priest just is not as good as that category of cards (fatty plus friends), because it is worse on defense, and that is where the rating difference comes from. It is not a bad card, it is in fact an excellent card, it is just not bomb level excellent because of its defensive deficiencies."

This is in addition to any situations where you can't/dont want to play it due to life considerations. All of these bring the card down to earth for me.

I'd rate thornbow archer at like 1.5-2, because I really think there's an aggressive deck here that wants a pseudo 2 power attacker for 1. I did take mardu shadowspear higher than most too, which may show my bias.  I also don't know how playable the 1 mana 2/1 artifact creature that cant attack alone is. It might be a key part of the aggressive strategies, but its hard for me personally to evaluate. Can't wait to see what Marshal/LSV have to say about it."
lrcast,3ck3h4,swissarmypen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"I'm tempted to like the 2/1 artifact creature but after thinking about it, I might only play it when- nevermind probably not. It's not aggressive since the fastest you can attack is t3, and your opponent can still prioritize trading the rest of your creatures to make it unable to attack next time. If you don't have it in your opening hand, it's probably a bad draw mid to late game."

But if they have a Skysnare Spider or a decent-sized guy with Knightly Valor, you're basically running a misdirectioned Duneblast. If they have Sentinel of the Eternal Watch ... well let's just assume you won't cast Languish against Sentinel.

lrcast,3ck3h4,Sceptilesolar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:27:05 2015 UTC,"Regarding Gilt-Leaf Winnower, I made some small math to understand how many creatures in Origins die to it. Here's a spreadsheet. Notably, I did not differentiate Rares&Mythics, feeling it would be negligible. In the NO camp are included Elves and creatures with 'protection'. Weighted Total considers boosters 'asfan', and in reality it might be skewed by actual playability of the creatures and priority of killing (for example: 1/1 for 1 are in NO camp, but you really won't see them often, nor you'll want to kill them) If you believe I made an error, feel free to tell me. TL;DR: Gilt-Leaf Winnower kills basically 50% of the field, so it will basically always have a target against any deck."
lrcast,3ck3h4,PforPizza,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:24:41 2015 UTC,"So I did my own review of the cards when they first came out, and there were a few cards that I was surprised to see that Luis had a much higher rating for than me, particularly:   Infernal Scarring, which I had at C- (~1.5), Luis 2.5 (~C+) Malakir Cullblade, I had C- (~1.5), Luis 3.0 (~B-) Necromantic Summons, I had again C- (~1.5), Luis had 2.5 (~C+)   However, I started to listen to the set review this morning to find that Marshall AND Luis agreed on Infernal Scarring at D (~0.5) and Malakir Cullblade a D (~0.5). Necromantic Summons LSV had at C which is somewhat inline with his score, but Marshall had it at D+.   These are dramatically differing scores and really make me wonder about my card evaluation, whether it's too high or way too low."

A 4/3 menace for 5 would probably be a playable card, and this gives you such an easy 2-for-1.  The effect is not narrow at all. Just thinking of random bombs off the top of my mind, it takes out Woodland Bellower, Embermaw Hellion, Kytheon, Kytheon's Irregulars, Sentinel of the Eternal Watch, Consul's Lieutenant. It even kills itself.  And that's just the best-case scenario. If you kill a Boggart Brute or Watercourser with it it's still a great deal."

Pelakka wurm / aquastrand spider are indeed two outs I would be considering, but your opponent has no realistic way of casting Pelakka wurm here: wurm is 7, triple G, and they're at 5, with two G. Spider is a concern, but they can't both cast spider and block more than one flyer without playing a second G here, which is an edge case again. Giving them another turn however makes both of those threats a lot more threatening since they have an extra turn of mana, and an extra potential land drop.   I'd be most worried about savage twister, but that beats you regardless, so you can ignore it.   Generally I think you want to win as soon as possible in this case."

lrcast,3clzc8,BonSequitur,7,Wed Jul 8 23:10:04 2015 UTC,vendillion clique seems really ambitious- with 2 swords I'd be more interested in playing silverblade paladin
lrcast,3clzc8,kuaggie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:38:52 2015 UTC,"Agree.  I don't want to play any islands when I'm reliant on untapped white mana on turn 1.  10 sources is not actually that reliable (most normal format draft decks dont care about 1 drops)  Silverblade paladin is an excellent card to follow up a 1 drop.  It's not disruptive, but it doesn't interact with removal that badly unless the opponent has a significant creature presence too.  If your opponent cant answer it quickly, they just die.  4 damage the turn it drops into 8 the following turn with just a 2/1 + it."
lrcast,3clzc8,sylverfyre,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:00:41 2015 UTC,"The problem with Silverblade Paladin is that it's worse against removal than something like a Dragon Hunter or something like a Brimaz. Dragon Hunter, being a 1-drop, is at least tempo neutral when it dies, it's less vulnerable to counterspells, and it puts the opponent on the back foot. Brimaz loses a small amount of tempo most times it gets killed or countered, but can win the game on his own, so he's better in games where he's the last creature standing after you and the opponent trade removal spells for a while. Silverblade Paladin is bad in both the ways Brimaz and Dragon Hunter aren't: It's not a self-sufficient threat that can win the game by itself, and it's not getting ahead on tempo when it interacts with removal.  It's a very BCSMy card, because sometimes you do play against the uninteractive storm decks and it does have a lot of racing power. But I find that the way games actually go with the white aggressive decks is that you often end up relying on a single creature to go the distance after the rest of your creatures get picked off, so I really want three-drops to be able to win the game on their own, or at least do something more than just attack and block. Hence why I put Exalted Angel (Which turns into a quasi-Baneslayer) and Mirran Crusader ahead of the Paladin. In fact, I think the Paladin is just a D in this cube. He gets a little better in the holiday cube that has less creature removal, but this cube is still creature-centric enough.  If I had a couple more of the strong white cards I would not be playing blue cards, but I don't actually think Silverblade Paladin is a strong white card. My alternatives were to play Exalted Angel (A C-, really), Soulfire Grand Master (A D+ in this deck), or blue. Because the power level of the cube is so high, I think I ended up having to get a little greedy to do well; if I had picked up a Thalia (Far and away the best card in thsoe decks), a Stoneforge Mystic, or an Armageddon I would not be in blue at all."
lrcast,3clzc8,kuaggie,-1,Thu Jul 9 20:46:01 2015 UTC,"I really didn't want to play too many cards like Silverblade Paladin, which interact poorly with removal, don't disrupt the opponent, and rely on me drawing other cards too. I think it was probably more correct to just play another island.

lrcast,3clzc8,rob_bot13,6,Wed Jul 8 23:46:55 2015 UTC,"cards like isamaru and dragon hunter aren't very powerful nor are they interactive.  The ""interaction"" they provide is getting a jump on the opponent:  a jump you can further exploit by playing paladin and giving them double strike, or one you can give up by tripping over your mana.  I don't think your manabase is terrible in a vacuum, but when I'm playing 1 drops and being aggressive I want to be as conservative as possible."

lrcast,3chob2,PoddyOne,4,Wed Jul 8 05:58:40 2015 UTC,"I gave it a serious chance after he left.  I wasn't wild about the guest episodes, but once LSV hit, I've quit listening to LR at all.  I think LSV is funny, and I know he's a fantastic magic player.  But I listened to LR because while Brian and Marshal are good magic players, they aren't pro magic players.  They talked about things from a perspective that felt familiar - that felt like something I could accomplish.  LSV is in a different class of MTG player (his entire career centers around it) and I have lost all desire to listen these days."
lrcast,3chob2,reodd,4,Wed Jul 8 15:21:23 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. The show just isn't what it used to be: Not bad, just not the show I loved to listen to."

lrcast,3chob2,enterthereckoner,2,Wed Jul 8 16:16:01 2015 UTC,"My wife and I were saddened by the departure of O. B. Wong Kenobi. I  found the guest host episodes to be mostly ""fine"" with a couple being pretty good, and then I'll admit I struggled to be excited for the episodes when LSV first took over.  I still miss Brian on the show, but I feel like I have broken through a plateau that I had reached from the last 2 years of limited play.  I feel the recent string of level up episodes specifically have been of superb quality.  Where I think Brian is missed is in card/archetype evaluation.  Brian seemed a slightly more balanced in what decks/cards he'd like to play and allowed for some healthy discussion on cards/strategies that he and Marshall disagreed on.  With LSV and Marshall having similar playstyles, at least as far as what they prefer to be drafting and playing (oftentimes Ux.grindy.value.dec) we don't get that difference of opinion."
lrcast,3chob2,PoddyOne,2,Wed Jul 8 16:07:00 2015 UTC,"Yes - this really is a problem. Also, I find the Marshall essentially treats LSV as an authority, and this makes it less interesting too."
lrcast,3chob2,4-in-hand,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:16:41 2015 UTC,"Well the concept of the show has always been that Marsh talks with an expert about magic. You need that relationship to make the show work. That relationship mirrors our own relationship with the show and the game. Similarly, in the booth you have one person doing play by play, one person doing color."
lrcast,3chob2,PoddyOne,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:33:46 2015 UTC,"Yes I see this, but it is better if they are still relatable in some way. LR with Marshall and Brian was kind of like ""two mates chatting"", with one of them the expert, while Marshall and LSV is more like an infomercial where Marshall says ""Oh! And what does this one do!"". I've exaggerated obviously, but I think the show used to be more down to earth, now they talk about playing in the pro-tour etc."
lrcast,3chob2,4-in-hand,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:39:28 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of us (myself included) were drawn to Brian's agnosticism. I've never seen a more committed nuts and bolts spike. I try to emulate the way that he plays mtgo still. LSV has shown at recent gps that he's fully capable of being a very agnostic player as well, the difference is, I think, he does this while also telling you what his preferences actually are.   I miss brian, but I like where the show is right now. I wish he'd come back for an ep, maybe calling him in during the PT ep (that might be more value filled than the standard bdm episode)?  Also, it would be sweet for a who's who of LR to do a draft. Everyone whose been a guest or host can qualify. They could draft an 8 player pod. Maybe even figure out how to raise money for gamers helping gamers?"
lrcast,3chob2,Andy-J,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:39:15 2015 UTC,"I used to listen to every show, now I listen to only the set review. I started listening maybe only four or five shows before Brian started, so may I'm biased, but BWong was the best and I really don't care for LSV. I don't like his attitude, or humor (I didn't really like his reviews before he came to LR). He strikes me as very smug and conceited based on his tone. When I listen to LR now I just find myself thinking about what Brian would do or say about the cards. His crazy number crunching and probability rants were fun, and he would get really cheerful and excited whenever there was a disagreement on the cards. The show had a lot more funny moments on it before. And while I appreciate them trying a more serious approach, I just don't really like it and never really wanted it either tbh."
lrcast,3chob2,moonbooty,3,Wed Jul 8 19:05:49 2015 UTC,"Must be fun, but also expensive I would think"
lrcast,3chob2,Gruul_and_Unusual,3,Wed Jul 8 00:50:56 2015 UTC,Brian's scheme of getting one box of every set that comes out and saving it for future chaos drafts seems ok. If only there was some way of retroactively deciding to do this 24 sets ago.
lrcast,3chob2,costofanarchy,2,Wed Jul 8 15:08:41 2015 UTC,"Since it takes a while to calculate, how much does that cost per person (total price of all the packs divided by 8)?"
lrcast,3chob2,costofanarchy,2,Wed Jul 8 02:46:38 2015 UTC,This cost me $330ish AUD in raw packs then another $33 AUD to get it shipped from America to Australia. For Americans it'd be about $250 with free shipping. So cost per person is around $45 AUD. So yeah quite expensive especially as I just covered costs for my friends. The chance at opening super expensive rares from some of the packs is cool. Last time we did it we cracked a scalding tarn. Mostly doing this is only viable if you really enjoy the style of draft. Also the reason b-Wong can do them regularly is because he hoards packs from each set just for this purpose. I was doing that for awhile but cave an cracked them all.
lrcast,3chob2,fkwillrice,2,Wed Jul 8 03:36:42 2015 UTC,"I'd really like to try this kind of draft but never have.  I was thinking maybe this can be simulated by a mega cube (just take someone's bulk collection and create balance across sets), where inclusions are made with variety in mind rather than power level and balance, but then I realized shuffling the cube would be a nightmare.  How come you have no core sets?  I get that expert level expansions are more ""interesting,"" but I've heard core set packs can help ""ground"" the experience in a good way (and probably reduce costs)."
lrcast,3chob2,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,2,Wed Jul 8 05:07:30 2015 UTC,"I skipped core sets for the shenanigan factor, wanted it to be complex and diverse. I def can see a couple core sets balancing out the pool being a good idea and if you want to do this on the cheap I think 1 of each core set plus 1 of each in print set would get you most of the way there for a lot less  Thought this didn't submit cause phone now I've rephrased the same thing twice, awkward."
lrcast,3chob2,Baelzabub,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:33:27 2015 UTC,Skipped core sets to make it a bit more intense. I think some amount of core sets would be a good idea to balance. Also if you grabbed 1 of each core set and 1 of each set in print you'd be most of the way to a draft with a lot less cost
lrcast,3chob2,transcensionist,2,Wed Jul 8 05:36:29 2015 UTC,"Packs from older sets are around 5 to 10 USD each, so 20 to 30 per person is realistic. I did one recently that was bring your own packs which made it more affordable for some. I highly recommend giving it a shot."

lrcast,3chob2,fkwillrice,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:28:43 2015 UTC,"I'm planning on running one of these soon, just need to hit-up civilization for a few weeks to get the packs.  I think I'm going to hand each player  a full set of a specific format and go from there:  So,  Drafter 1: INN INN INN Drafter 2: RTR GAT DGM Drafter 3: ROE ROE ROE Drafter 4: KTK KTK KTK etc..  formats depend on what I can get.  Idea being that since each player will get the all the first picks for their 'Block', there can be some consistency out of the chaos.  Anyone tried this?"
lrcast,3cidb5,oraymw,8,Wed Jul 8 03:33:24 2015 UTC,"I think the method of organization in this episode is better than the previous set review format, just keeps things sorted better.   But I thought it went pretty far off the rails in sticking Chandra in the top category then immediately bashing it as not very good. That made me question the value of the rest of the ratings.   What I understood the ratings to mean, and perhaps this was an unstated assumption, was ""A = cards that we expect to rightfully make it into top tier decks"", not ""cards that will be played because people want to make fun underpowered decks that aren't actually good.""  That stuck out like a sore thumb to me, but overall the content and organization is good and I hope we can get that point addressed in subsequent set reviews."
lrcast,3cidb5,Mullibok,5,Wed Jul 8 19:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I also think it would've been good for Marshall and Eric to double check their lists. There were a handful of of cards that were on their list that they had misread, and it stuck out pretty badly. Granted, that only accounted for a small percentage of the cards they talked about, but it's still kind of weird that they had that many cards on their lists."
lrcast,3cidb5,Cervantes3,3,Wed Jul 8 19:46:52 2015 UTC,"I understand misremembering a few cards and correcting themselves like what happened a few times, but missing what Nissa's +1 does seems like a pretty big oversight considering how different the show's stance was on her was from other reviews."
lrcast,3cidb5,Mullibok,2,Wed Jul 8 21:00:24 2015 UTC,"Yer. It was weird to hear Nissa being called ""unplayable"". While I think it partially to do with misreading her +1, it did seem that Efro found pretty much everything about the card very sub-par, quite in contrast to other commentators (Chapin for example)."
lrcast,3cidb5,billiam-was-taken,3,Wed Jul 8 21:15:49 2015 UTC,"Marshall seemed surprised upon hearing Eric's view on Chandra. I feel like it wasn't communicated properly before that he wasn't a fan, despite giving it an A. This was kind of reinforced by Marshall asking about Gideon ""Now just to make sure, you do actually like this card right?"" or something along those lines."
lrcast,3cidb5,BUfels,0,Wed Jul 8 22:42:27 2015 UTC,I don't like the grade scale for constructed cars at all. So much of a cards playability is tied to the environment that surrounds it and I don't see the use of comparing cards in a vacuum.
lrcast,3cidb5,DR_Hero,4,Thu Jul 9 22:33:26 2015 UTC,"I listened to this at work, so I wasn't able to give my undivided attention... but did they skip over Day's Undoing? I mostly know Timetwister as the cube card that I'm kind of scared of, but I really would have liked to hear the opinions of guys who've played with this Wheel type of effect before.   Other people that I consider very good at magic seem very excited about the card, so I doubt it is them just writing it off as unplayable. Seems very intentional to ignore it, and I'm not really sure why."
lrcast,3cidb5,Verror27,2,Wed Jul 8 18:29:36 2015 UTC,"I never heard them get to it either. Found it weird too, as it's clearly one of the more polarising cards, and it would have been interesting to hear the discussion."
lrcast,3cidb5,billiam-was-taken,3,Wed Jul 8 21:18:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sticky-ing episode threads, it's something I think the subreddit needs."
lrcast,3cidb5,cricketHunter,3,Wed Jul 8 15:04:16 2015 UTC,"This one was weird. I know Fro is busy with the WSOP but I disagree with a ton of his opinions on this, most importantly Nissa.   Everyone else is saying she's great. I have personally played with her, and she was great. Her being a slightly worse civic wayfinder in exchange for a great late game top deck has been massive. Out of a languish abzan shell, she allows so much only costing 3 mana late game.   I know it's all conjecture but I won every time I got to cast her late and flip her. You can easily do outright powerful things like cast her, get a forest, play the forest to flip her, languish with a rhino or tasigur out, and then make a 4/4."
lrcast,3cidb5,optimis344,3,Wed Jul 8 21:52:18 2015 UTC,"His evaluation was absolutely stunning to me, to the point where I was expecting at some point to say ""just kidding, this card is awesome"". It's pretty clear he misread the +1 and probably missed that she's an elf, but still it's bizarre to hear anyone declare the card just outright bad. I've seen the card actually play out, and it's very good."
lrcast,3cidb5,yavimaya_eldred,2,Thu Jul 9 00:25:14 2015 UTC,"Thought this was pretty good and probably the best set review to date. There were a couple misunderstandings, but I think that's going to happen sometimes, really.  As for the A/B/C rating system, I realise I'm in the minority, but I would probably just scrap it, and in general any rating system. For some reason, it feels like the ratings work for LR, but for CR, the analysis is so much more important and that putting a rating on something does much more 'damage' to the listener. It's probably because in LR terms, you know something that's an A or B almost always makes decks unless Marshall and Luis are way off base (which is extremely rare), but with constructed, sometimes cards never find a home despite being strong in a vacuum. Again, it feels like for CR, the analysis is the essential part and the rating system feels somewhat 'having one because people like a definitive stamp', as opposed it being the best approach.   That said, the analysis in here was really good and I certainly feel more prepared for the new set and that I have more appreciation for what some cards can do and why I was maybe getting overexcited by others."
lrcast,3cidb5,SohNata,2,Wed Jul 8 22:23:43 2015 UTC,Did I miss it or was Magmatic Insight not brought up at all? I've heard a range of opinions on it and would have much rather heard that diacussed than an oddly placed chandra bashing.

lrcast,3cidb5,MooMooMan69,2,Wed Jul 8 17:10:00 2015 UTC,"Somehow despite 3 hours of awesome analysis I came away focused on parts of this review that felt like EFro wasn't really invested in the show. I really like this method of organizing the set review, but when they got to Chandra and EFro just had no idea what their own grading system was it really stuck out. Also them misreading Nissa seemed very important to the fact that they rated her so low. The card is bonkers good and easily top 2 of the 5 planeswalkers. Overall the episode was great, but I really wish they had double checked what they were planning to do before recording the podcast."
lrcast,3cidb5,swishswash93,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:05:36 2015 UTC,"Nissa hype?  EDIT: http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=391937  EDIT 2: @Efro Nissa's +1 is Coiling Oracle, not Sindbad"
lrcast,3cidb5,bearrosaurus,2,Wed Jul 8 03:45:04 2015 UTC,"I also found it interesting that Efro completely dismissed the front side of Nissa - borderland ranger is not a ton better on the front side, and has seen play in several past standard formats. As Chapin and Flores brought up on Top Level Podcast, you can also hit your 7th land with a fetch land on the battlefield. If you do that, your fetchland can counter a removal spell, so they really have to kill it before then if they want to deny you the planeswalker."
lrcast,3cidb5,RootbreakerW,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:19:50 2015 UTC,"The only time I remember Borderland being successful at large competitive events was in 3 color Kessig Wolf Run. In that case the fixing was essential, as was having a huge mana-dump that could end the game with whatever body was around. In that case, Borderland got you the colors you needed, fueled you win-con land, and provided a body to pump. Nissa is doing none of that. Of course she has a whole second side too..."
lrcast,3cidb5,wonkygamble,2,Wed Jul 8 21:59:36 2015 UTC,"I wonder if Nissa is a card waiting for rotation. We have gotten a number of cards that place lands into play as their form of ramp in Dragons and Origins: Explosive Vegetation, Sword of the Animist, Animist Awakening, Nissa's Pilgrimage. I wonder if these are the way to make her work best. Of course, to make it a deck we would probably need more payoff, such as landfall triggering low drops.  This would make the Coiling Oracle +1, boost the same payoff as well. Of course that is pure speculation about what might be in Battle for Zendikar and it may not even mean that she is good."
lrcast,3cidb5,breecerm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:22:13 2015 UTC,"Attacking with Chandra helps her flip right? It sounds like the assumption is that she's only ever using her ping mode to get her to a planeswalker, but if you're against a control deck, it doesn't seem too far-fetched to think they won't have a blocker, and then you only need to cast one spell (on turn 4) to flip her. I generally agree with your assessment that she's probably not great, but I think there might be value as a sideboard option against control for the fact that if she's a planeswalker, she requires the control player to think about using a different removal suite that is going to necessarily be worse against a pure creature strategy."
lrcast,3cidb5,neofederalist,2,Wed Jul 8 12:20:42 2015 UTC,"A. Even against control, she's very poor compared to Goblin Rabblemaster. After rotation, you'd probably still prefer something with immediate impact rather than a 'dies to doomblade' 3 drop. Haste/dash guy at the very least.  B. I don't think the removal argument holds water. She dies to Bile Blight and to Ojutai. How often do you say that about a card?  I think we ought to rule her out completely because she's a vulnerable 3-drop that you have to untap with in order to do anything ... she'd have to make up for it in a serious way. Nissa and Lili can flip the turn you cast them and still get you value if they die."
lrcast,3cidb5,bearrosaurus,-1,Wed Jul 8 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed this, but I think they did miss a pretty huge blue card.  (get on soap box)  I think displacement wave is amazing.  I absolutely think it has a place in the current control decks, which is (and I'm pretty sure will remain) a viable strategy.  I think it really helps against aggressive decks full of allot of one drops or tokens, and as elves and goblins are both being pushed I think there is a very real possibility that it can be a counter card to those decks.  As a player of the heroic deck, I am far more scared of this card than Languish, as I can't out scale this card by making my small creatures large.  I can't even make them indestructible, which worked against Crux of Fate and end hostilities.  And since lots of these creatures lack haste, this is an issue.  I also think this has a place against the G-W devotion deck, since for UU it sends all morph/manifested creatures to their hands, and for 2UU it hits Mastery of the Unseen.  Playing for 5 to send deathmist raptors back to their owner's hand is also arguably better than destroying them, as it can be considerably harder to get them back onto the field from a player's hand.  Even against abzan aggro, it can return things like Fleecemane Lion (even monstrous) and Rackshasha deathdealer, which is not inconsiderable.  Also, if you are counting on things like elvish mystic or morphing rattleclaw mystic for ramp you can reset their ramp for 3, and turn three might (might) just be fast enough to reset the ramp before it destroys you outright (especially on the play).  Finally, if they are right and the new gidion is a thing, this is UU ""send him to your hand, now you have to transform him all over again"".  I feel this may be nice to remember once Murderous cut rotates out of the format.  I don't think it's great in every match up, sure.  But I defiantly think this card will see play.  Thank you for reading.  (gets off soap box)"
lrcast,3cico5,GoldgariDelve,3,Wed Jul 8 03:27:28 2015 UTC,I don't see how you can complain about the limited archetypes being boring when the set isn't out. There could be things going on that people haven't even thought of yet.
lrcast,3cico5,beepbloopbloop,3,Wed Jul 8 14:13:52 2015 UTC,Hm come to think of it I cant think of a format in the past few years where red white was really fun to play or draft ( aside from MMA2015 I quite liked that)
lrcast,3cico5,chord_O_Calls,3,Wed Jul 8 05:21:57 2015 UTC,"I liked red-white in Theros+BOTG, where I. thought it was fun and powerful, though it quickly became overdrafted."

I wish that they would make the natural pairing in a standard legal set for red white be the control archetype. In Gatecrash that sort of deck was lurking in the background but the Boros aggressive archetype was so much stronger, there was no incentive to draft the slower controlling version of R/W."
lrcast,3cico5,wilydanyeah45,0,Wed Jul 8 17:06:23 2015 UTC,This is really what I was thinking about. Red-White seems to stand out in being particularly boring/standard/repetitive in limited.
lrcast,3cico5,beepbloopbloop,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:33:36 2015 UTC,"They both have great small creatures so it's always been an aggressive weenie deck, which all tend to play similarly in limited. There haven't really been any strong other archetypes there, unfortunately."
lrcast,3cico5,TransitionFire,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:02:38 2015 UTC,"Some of us also like the archetype. I like pressuring my opponents and having them worry when/where the hit that kills them is coming. The puzzle of where I put down my combat tricks, when I correctly bluff.

lrcast,3cico5,redblade8,2,Wed Jul 8 16:02:39 2015 UTC,"When you get colors together they tend to do the same thing. That being said I think red white enchments is not going to be unlike most r/w drafts. I think you are going to use flyers and first strike guys plus the cheap enchments. The red enchment that replaces it self, the white one that taps, the cheap flyers and great renown guys. It's going to be fun."
lrcast,3cico5,5-s,3,Wed Jul 8 03:48:41 2015 UTC,I think it's more likely that you're goin to just ignore most of the enchantments and play it as the weenies beat down deck just like in other sets.
lrcast,3cico5,Malarazz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:08:53 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I'd say enchantments will be more reserved for black-white. Red-white doesn't want to play cards like Auramancer and Totem-Guide Hartebeest.
lrcast,3cico5,Talpostal,2,Wed Jul 8 14:21:43 2015 UTC,"When you get colors together they tend to do the same thing.   I disagree with that. Black/White has been constellation in Theros, Tribal Warriors in Tarkir, and is constellation again in Origins. In the past, Black/White has also had tokens and grindy attrition strategies.  With Red/White, we have a wide strategy in Tarkir, (presumably) a wide strategy in Origins, and a wide strategy in Theros with some heroic thrown in. In Ravnica, Red/White was a wide, aggressive strategy.  I'm not sure why they seem so hesitant to explore other aspects of W/R. The design space is there for a control burn style but we almost never see it."
lrcast,3cico5,Slypenslyde,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:51:57 2015 UTC,"Each color has its things that it's traditionally known for, and it's rare the developers go outside of those. That's made a lot of color pairs natural fits for strategies that I think are what's being considered ""boring"" now. This is particularly true for allied colors, and making sure those have synergies is a design principle of most sets. For enemy colors, it's usually harder to pull something together unless the designers have intentionally created a synergy.  This sounds like what you're describing. RW has natural synergies that arise so long as the two colors are doing what they usually do. BW doesn't tend to have synergies unless there's a set-specific need, such as KTK's BW Warriors. I think the problem with exploring new spaces in the allied pairs is the risk of giving those pairs too much power, or having the colors stray so far from their normal roles they cause other problems."

But I do feel like anything that'd make RW play ""strange"" would probably more strongly reinforce some other color pair. For example, if R or W got access to some good evasive creatures, UR evasion or UW flyers would probably be stronger than RW evasion, unless both colors got access. But then the draft would be ground vs. air because 3 pairs would have access to a powerful strategy.   Maybe it's because I haven't played for more than a year (ORI prerelease is the anniversary!) but it doesn't bug me that much. I guess if RW were my favorite color pair it would, but it feels like complaining about something fundamental to the game."

MM15 has a bunch of playable cards, so they should hold their value pretty well, especially if some of those staples go up in price and/or aren't reprinted again in the next couple of years.

lrcast,3cfdd6,BonSequitur,6,Tue Jul 7 21:31:47 2015 UTC,"A few common pitfalls that people might not be aware of:   Splinter Twin and related combo pieces (Kiki-Jiki, Pestermite, Inquisitor Exarch) are quite strong, but don't take them hoping to build a dedicated combo deck. Rather, they enable a control/tempo deck that just happens to have a combo finish, and combine particularly well with cards like True-Name Nemesis and Vendilion Clique that threaten to win the game by themselves or force action from the opponent. It is correct to play less land if you have moxen in your deck. 15 or 16 land and a mox is a normal mana base. Don't consider a mox to be a signal for a particular colour. And it's generally not worth it to draft white just because you have a Mox Pearl in your pile; off-colour moxen are still quite broken. Sol Ring is better than moxen. Black lotus is better than everything. Mishra's Workshop is broken as hell but you need 15+ artefacts in your deck. Timetwister is ""power"", but not every deck really wants it. Mana fixing is generally strong. The card quality is quite high, but there are still peaks and valleys, so being able to play more colours will give you access to more powerful cards. Particularly, dual lands and fetch lands combine in interesting ways which make it worth it to pick them up speculatively fairly early on. Sometimes you will play off-colour fetch lands (For example, a Verdant Catacombs to get Badlands and Underground Sea in your UR deck). Sometimes fetchlands will make a splash very close to free. Always pay attention to what dual lands and fetchlands you have and what they can get; if you have Hallowed Fountain, Savannah, Stomping Grounds, and Plateau in your pile, suddenly Arid Mesa is amazing even if you're not playing white. In the holiday cube, trying to do something broken is generally much better than trying to do something fair. If you do try to do something fair, it should be disruptive: You want cards like Force of Will, Thalia, Thoughtseize, Mind Twist (Not that Mind Twist is a fair card, of course). Blue is overdrafted. Blue is also so deep it might not even matter that it's overdrafted, but unless you get some really great incentive (Eg, Jace), your blue decks will often have blue as a secondary colour with some strong cards. You will definitely have enough playables, so speculating, taking early mana fixing, and picking broken cards you're not sure you'll be playing are all better than they are in a normal format. The cube is singleton. This means that if you have a card in your pile, you don't have to play around it, and you can make other inferences about what your opponent might have, too. This also means that playing around very specific answers is usually not worth it - Force of Will, Force Spike, and Mana Tithe are all in this cube, but I generally just ignore that they exist unless I know my opponent has them or remember from the draft that they are very likely to have them. Ancestral Recall is very splashable. Monored splashing Ancestral Recall is much better than monored. You can add as many basic lands as you want to your deck. Storm is a trap."

lrcast,3cfdd6,bitterrootmtg,2,Thu Jul 9 20:07:53 2015 UTC,"LSV's holiday cube videos on youtube, Twitch, and CFB are very good.  Cube is like Modern Masters turned up to 11. Synergies are everything, and ""good stuff"" decks don't cut it because every card is good. Your deck should feel like a constructed deck in terms of how focused it is on achieving its goal (combo, aggression, or control). Combo tends to be the strongest gameplan but it is also the hardest to draft properly. Aggro is the weakest but generally the easiest to pull off if you've never drafted cube before. If you do draft aggro, you should either be in an extremely low curve mono-red deck or in a ""hatebears"" type deck that uses cards like Thalia, Scavenging Ooze, and Quasali Pridemage to disrupt the opponent's plan. Midrange decks are horrible and should not be drafted.  Because of the high number of playables in cube, you can afford to ""throw away"" more picks on (1) high-upside cards that you're not sure will get played, and (2) powerful sideboard cards.  The best card in the cube is almost certainly Time Vault (apparently Time Vault has been removed). The second and third are a tie between Black Lotus and Sol Ring. The next best cards are other free mana sources like the Moxes and Mana Crypt, as well as Ancestral Recall, Jace the Mindsculptor, Tinker, and Yawgmoth's Will. If you have any familiarity with Vintage or Legacy, this will help you evaluate card quality in the cube."

lrcast,3cfdd6,FDL42,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:38:32 2015 UTC,"I should point out: Midrange decks can be viable in cube. What is horrible is ""normal Limited decks."" If you draft midrange, you have to draft a highly focused midrange deck that looks like a Modern Jund or Legacy Sultai list: A deck where every card is a board-impacting two-for-one or a piece of highly targeted disruption. Midrange decks need to be doing something very good at every point of the curve to succeed, which is why cube, with the flatness of its card quality, tamps down on it. However, it's better to be playing a deck that has a Liliana of the Veil, a Dark Confidant, a Bitterblossom, a Hymn to Tourach, a Thoughtseize and a Mind Twist in it than a mediocre blue deck that has one of the premium sub-Jace blue cards and otherwise is on all reasonable blue cards like Remand."
lrcast,3cfdd6,bitterrootmtg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:20:12 2015 UTC,"I'm having a little trouble taking the plunge and drafting combo pieces early. I don't have a lot of experience with the old and very rare cards so I tend to gravitate towards control decks. These have a game plan I can work my head around.  I know the Show and Tell, Tinker, Sneak Attack and Reanimator  decks work, but I find it hard to draft them.  I just 3-0'd a pod with UW Control. 2 of my wins came off of T3 Black Lotus into Sun Titan (which is pretty sweet with Black Lotus!) or Elspeth, Sun Champion, so I got to see first hand that fast bombs do work, but they weren't central to my deck either...  My opponent in the finals had a pretty sweet UB Reanimator that was super consistent (Recurring Nithmare, Necromancy, Demonic Tutor, Imperial Seal and Buried Alive). His fatties were Grave and Frost Titans (with Phyrexian Metamorph and Makeshift Manequin to boot).  I still feel like if he had only picked up one Titan, he'd have almost no gas and just an engine (which comforts me in my choice to play control because I can pickup more removal than my opponents have win cons...).  Anyways, I guess, I'll have to commit a couple of times, crash and burn horribly, and learn from those. :)"
lrcast,3cfdd6,FDL42,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:09:50 2015 UTC,"You're right. The pitfall of drafting combo is that you might not get all the pieces. Too many reanimation spells and not enough targets. Too many rituals and not enough storm cards. Etc.  That's why the key to drafting these decks is staying open and paying very close attention to what is being passed to you. You want to make sure you're the only person at the table drafting that deck. The cards I'm looking to pick up early for a combo deck (other than power/moxen) are cards that are good in every combo deck. Ponder effects, tutors, and the like. Once you find out a strategy is open, you can start taking more deck-specific cards.  The exception to this is when you see the key card for a particular deck, like Griselbrand or Mind's Desire. In that case I'm generally willing to pick the card early, realizing I might not end up in that deck."
lrcast,3cfdd6,Aethien,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:04:59 2015 UTC,Picking tutors/deck manipulation early makes a lot of sense.  How highly do you value removal like O Ring or Ultimate Price?

Once you have a spell in the yard, yes, keeping 1 mana open for spell pierce will annoy the opponent, but it's only a single use (per instant/sorcery) that the opponent can see coming, and the opponent should be sitting on 5 or 6 lands when you get this up and going meaning they can still build up their board around it.  It can't tap/untap creatures ""at will"" as you will quickly churn through your spells in the graveyard doing that.  I just feel like the setup cost here is too great for a 4 rating, even if you do try to draft for this."
lrcast,3cfmga,ScotMartin,2,Tue Jul 7 18:57:35 2015 UTC,"The ""setup"" cost for this card is minimal at worst.  Most decent mid-range draft decks run 6-8 non-creature spells.  You get a benefit for playing this creature simply by playing cards you were going to play, anyway.  Obviously this card is far less good if you're creature-heavy and you only have like 4 non-creature spells in your deck.  But, ""This card isn't amazing in a deck that doesn't support it,"" isn't really a knock against this card any more than any other card in the set."
lrcast,3cfmga,Greyfeld,2,Tue Jul 7 19:10:51 2015 UTC,"I hear ya. Rereading my original post, it came off too negative. I updated that I think the setup cost is too much for a 4 rating.   It does give you extra value for each sorcery/instant you cast in a game, but you wouldn't play a 3/4 for 3UU by itself, so that extra value isn't a bonus, it's needed to justify running the card. Will I run a 3/4 for 3UU with 3 uses of this ability in a game? Yep. I just don't see it as a slam-dunk 1st pick."
lrcast,3cfmga,ScotMartin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:57:48 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good card in more controlly decks; all of it's abilities are designed to slow up the opponent - the spell pierce, tap an attacker, or untap a blocker, pump itself.

Sure, it's not a finisher by itself, but it should allow you to reach your finishers by making combat a nightmare for your opponent for 2-4 turns."

We already know that a 1/1 flyer for 1 is pretty much  unplayable in limited, and probably even worse in Origins because there are a bunch of thopters so if you really want one they're easy to pick up.  So if you have 1 in your deck it sucks.  The second one is a cheaper palace familiar which is good, but you still had to play the first one to trigger it.  Once you cast your third it likely starts to feel really good, but how many of these do you need to consistently draw into 3 of these per game?  Probably like 6, and it's very difficult to pick that many copies of any given card since 24 random packs might only have a couple copies of these between them.    I guess if you pick one at the end of pack 1 and start seeing more mid- pack2 you could try moving in, but otherwise it does seem like the set-up is a little high."

It's effectively a 2/3 flier for 4, which doesn't pass the vanilla test very well; I don't think being split into two creatures compensates fully for that, especially when both of those creatures get blanked in combat by just about anything. Clash of Wills Again, I have it lower. I don't think this is better than Cancel - the possibility of being 1 mana cheaper doesn't seem like a great trade-off for being less reliable.

lrcast,3cfmga,UnsealedMTG,2,Wed Jul 8 13:40:39 2015 UTC,"My limited play time with Sandsteppe Mastodon leads me to believe that a 5/5 body that can block fliers is a huge asset to stabalizing on the board.  Being able to lock out a key piece of removal in the process only makes Alhammaret better for that purpose.  Keep in mind, you can also use it offensively, checking your opponent's hand for threats to see if it's safe to attack in or not."
lrcast,3cfmga,Greyfeld,3,Tue Jul 7 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"Sandsteppe Mastodon also affected the board in another meaningful way by buffing a different creature into ""block anything"" range."
lrcast,3cfmga,DazeRyuken,0,Tue Jul 7 17:55:23 2015 UTC,A key difference is that mastodon is in green and had a plethora of possible ramp spells to help him out.  Alma will usually not have the luxury of having green as a backup color.
lrcast,3cfmga,Malarazz,5,Tue Jul 7 18:50:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you, but when I draft green, I rarely waste a deck slot on ramp.  Whisperer of the Wilds being the rare exception, since also being a creature can serve other benefits."

Understand the value of one card vs another. There are some cards which are just unplayable in most situations. Know which of these cards are ""unplayable."" Basically...do your homework. Other than that it will just take practice at limited to get better. I suggest listening to Limited Resources episodes 248, 273, 283, 286, 288, and 290 to name a few if you have not already.

lrcast,3chghd,gregariousbarbarian,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, nobody will be so ridiculously prepared during the first draft of the format that they'll blow you out of the water if you don't do the same. As long as you have a decent understanding of what archetypes are available in the format and therefore how you should draft after your first couple of picks, you'll do fine. After all, learning the niche interactions is something that happens over time, and can really only be learned most efficiently by straight drafting the format multiple times."
lrcast,3chghd,Telemokos,4,Thu Jul 9 00:06:11 2015 UTC,"Unless you play with total morons, you're unlikely to go from 0-2-1 to 3-0 or 4-0 in one week.  Set yourself realistic targets and expectations. Maybe you can just go 1-1-1 first, then try for 2-1 etc.  Watch some pro tour drafts, see how the pro's stay open, learn to understand how to evaluate cards, and keep an open mind.  Good Luck, and don't get disheartened if things don't go your way."

lrcast,3cg07s,bitterrootmtg,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:57:17 2015 UTC,I would have cut one of the Skirmishers for the 16th land. It's clunkier in a fast deck.

lrcast,3cf9wy,cferejohn,8,Tue Jul 7 13:56:13 2015 UTC,"If you think it's cheating, that's purely a personal-moral decision. I don't think MTGO even bothers to claim that using outside material is cheating since it can't be enforced. I've never really heard it discussed."
lrcast,3cf9wy,Diablomarcus,3,Tue Jul 7 14:02:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think a lot of the reason it's considered ""cheating"" (or at least is against the rules) in paper play is that it can slow the game down immensely. On MTGO you have your own clock so if you want to spend it looking up combat tricks constantly, that's on you."
lrcast,3cgqrf,Malarazz,5,Tue Jul 7 19:57:13 2015 UTC,"If your curve includes multiple 4-drops and a 5-drop, you shouldn't go below 17.  16 land is for a deck that has a majority of 1 and 2 drops and a small number of 3s with 1 or 0 4s."
lrcast,3cgqrf,SleepingSheeperson,6,Tue Jul 7 20:54:42 2015 UTC,"I think you messed up on this one, but ultimately results do not matter. You did not get mana screwed multiple times because of one less land in your deck, it was a combination of bad luck and possibly bad keeps.  As someone who's often done 15-16 landers in draft, you want a healthy combination of 1-3 drops, not 2-4 drops with a 5. What you described is just a slightly aggressive mid-range deck, no need to mess with the mana to support that."
lrcast,3cgqrf,5-s,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:35:56 2015 UTC,it was a combination of bad luck and possibly bad keeps.   That's another thing I should probably make a post on at some point and hear other people's opinions. I always mull 1-land hands and 6-land hands. 99% of the time I keep 2-land hands on the draw and 5-land hands on the play.  It's 2-land hands on the play and 5-land hands on the draw that I'm never confident on.
lrcast,3cgqrf,LarpingWombat,4,Tue Jul 7 23:55:30 2015 UTC,Keeping or Mull'ing is so much more complicated than that. My buddy and I have been mulling over mulligans for a while now and we both have gone back and listened to the (really old) mulligan episode (#157). Bottom line: mulligans are HARD! You are really setting yourself up for failure with rules like that.
lrcast,3cgqrf,mtgorrah,4,Wed Jul 8 01:15:21 2015 UTC,"I played 16 lands in a KTK/FRF Draft when My highest cmc was 4. It was a very aggressive RB deck. I had a lot of triggers that made it so my opponent could not block. My deck consisted mostly of 2 drops, morphs, and removal."
lrcast,3cgqrf,punninglinguist,3,Tue Jul 7 21:40:03 2015 UTC,"It was pretty common in Theros block WR aggro decks to play 16 lands. In those decks, you usually had only 1-3 cards above 3 cmc (plus a bestow or two)."
lrcast,3cgqrf,GrayMatterMatters,3,Tue Jul 7 22:10:09 2015 UTC,"The sample size is way too small to make any general conclusions on. If you had done 30 games, then we'd be close to a proper sample size. That of course does not answer the question at hand.  Smarter people than me have taken a crack at the mana base problem. I recommend these resources;  Counting to 20  How many mana sources do you need to consistently cast your spells  LR episode 189"
lrcast,3cgqrf,beepbloopbloop,3,Wed Jul 8 08:21:06 2015 UTC,You don't want to play any 5 drops in a 16-lander. 1 or 2 4 drops is the absolute most but you should be able to win games on 3 lands.
lrcast,3cgqrf,Cervantes3,2,Wed Jul 8 14:12:29 2015 UTC,"It's just variance.   You only want to cut a land if you have nothing but one and two mana spells with a few three mana spells thrown in as well.   You can also consider 16 lands if you've got a lot of ways to ramp your mana, along with a lot of cheap spells.   I would never go below 17 lands in a deck that had four and five mana spells.  Edit: Keep in mind, these are very extreme circumstances, and I wouldn't actually recommend building your decks like this. Just that, if your draft went horribly wrong and your only good cards are really cheap aggro cards or ramp spells, you can maybe go down one land."
lrcast,3cgqrf,priceQQ,2,Tue Jul 7 20:08:05 2015 UTC,"If you ever see formats with warped mana bases, aside from the CC of the spells, there is usually a reason. Cheap cantrips like Dragon Mantle or Titans Strength made really low curves possible a few formats ago running 14-15 lands. And when you have powerful mana sinks, you'll want to run more lands. 17 is a benchmark partly because your deck is centered around three drops."
lrcast,3cgqrf,andresacram,2,Wed Jul 8 01:36:42 2015 UTC,"In addition to what everyone's already said, the format you're playing should also be taken into account. A deck full of 2- and 3-drops can afford to have 16 lands, but not every format has winning decks that high up on the aggro scale. Triple Zendikar, triple Gatecrash, and triple Theros were such formats (ZEN-ZEN-ZEN was actually a contest of who can assemble more evasive 2-drops :P), but I don't recall any other recent format in which you could get away with a low-curve, hyper-aggressive deck except for some very special circunstances."
lrcast,3cgqrf,CelestialBeekeeper,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:41:26 2015 UTC,Missing a land drop early game or taking a mulligan because your opening hand is light on lands is much worse than drawing a useless land late game.  The reason you still play 17 lands in an aggressive deck that curves out at 4 isn't because you want 6 mana on turn 9. It's because you want 4 mana on turn 4.
lrcast,3cf6s9,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,2,Tue Jul 7 13:06:12 2015 UTC,"Looking at the results of the LRCommunity set review here, the ranking seems to be:  Sigil of Valor C Throwing Knife C Veteran's Sidearm D+  Anecdotal evidence from a friend, Sigil of Valor looks better than it is, because that cheap re-equip cost looks like an upside - except unlike most equipment it doesn't give you any benefit on defense."
lrcast,3cf6s9,cricketHunter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:51:25 2015 UTC,"I think that only Throwing Knife will be a card that usually makes the cut in most decks (it is kind of like a much better Vial of Dragonfire) and I think Veteran's Sidearm will occasionally make the cut, especially in the artifact archetype."

At uncommon there is Jhessian Thief, Whirler Rogue, and Skaab Goliath (yeah, I think he will be a thing).  Blue will be able to play its usual tempo game, but it is definitely going to need a support color to get some hard removal and a few more quality creatures."

You also have access to some of the best finishers in the format - Deep Sea Terror and Skaab Goliath.  Something to note is that blue has a LOT of counters in this format.

lrcast,3ce8s4,gregariousbarbarian,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:51:03 2015 UTC,"Blue has only a few good Commons, but I think its Uncommon pool is very strong (Whirler Rogue, Sigiled Starfish) and some of its rares are pretty ridiculous (Thopter Spy Network).  Will have to see how it works out, but it definitely seems more like a color you'll only play because you get one of the very good Uncommons/Rares and very few other people are in the color with you."

lrcast,3ce86c,robalesi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:46:06 2015 UTC,"Here's my opinion.    Pack 1  P1P1: Silumgar's Command vs. Ultimate Price ... hard, since you can't really get the remove planeswalker on another card. I would go with single color requirement though  P1P2: Butcher over Hand of Silumgar considering first pick. Silkwrap is another option.  P1P3: Forerunners over SummiP. You can get more of those late.  P1P5: Vultous Aven.   P1P6: Hmm, late Scribe. SummiP seems solid though  P1P7: Nice Brute. At this point I'd be on the lookout for cheap drops and removal. Have we seen 2 or 3 Dragon Fodders  P1P9: Skirmisher over Scribe? I don't know if UR is really viable, but your pick feels like you're locking into BR. I feel like we've seen a decent amount of blue go by.    Pack 2  P2P2: Forerunnners over Death Wind? I mentally went OMG. I am mentally moving removal up in my pick order now and Death Wind is premium in my opinion.  P2P3: Outriders over Defeat I can better defend, but your still have no removal.  P2P4: Another good removal spell over a curve filler  P2P5: Really nothing interesting. A lot of white and green going by, so maybe hate draft some removal... The dragon seems a little overcosted to me and a Hulk will probably come by later.  P2P6: Goblin is the best pick here, though I don't know if it'll make the deck.  P2P8: Minister is sideboard material, but a decent pick considering.    Pack 3  P3P1: Atarka could be splashable. Looking for removal is top priority atm.  P3P2: Would rather not screw with my mana base to play Atarka if it means getting some removal. Douse I believe is the better pick here. Hoping for the Vaultbreaker to wheel, which would replace a SummiP.  P3P6: Considering the earlier heal land, a second one makes you able to relatively easy splash for Atarka.  P3P10: The Douse wheeled. Sweet. Did not expect that.  P3P11: Hungering Yeti is just a dumb 4/4 for 5. The Mind Rot effect is sideboard material against those controlling bomb heavy decks. I can make big dragons go away, which you otherwise have no answers for.    Bottom line:  I prioritize removal a little higher from the beginning. I got a feeling that you had a predisposition for RB."
lrcast,3ce86c,GrayMatterMatters,2,Tue Jul 7 09:07:16 2015 UTC,"I just listened to the Dragons sunset show, where Marshall and LSV discusses Scribe. Basically saying it's not that impressive."
lrcast,3cbssw,bearrosaurus,2,Mon Jul 6 18:10:02 2015 UTC,"I think LSV glossed over one of the most-important differences between Formidable and Ferocious: Formidable only applied to activated abilities on creatures and Ferocious was always either a triggered ability (on creatures) or an optional extra on spells. This did make them feel different as mechanics.  [Edit: Actually, I'm wrong about Formidable always being an activated ability. However, it's still the case that it wasn't on spells and Ferocious was never activated, unless you count Whisperer of the Wilds.]  It was also unclear how much of this episode was about DTK/DTK/FRF as a format vs. just a retrospective on DTK. Like, all of the superlative titles were given to DTK cards even though I'm sure FRF cards also deserved many of them.  I also thought that as a 2-color format DTK draft was a letdown in that it was obviously the case that 5 of the pairs were meant to be synergistic and 5 of them kinda weren't and the only payoff for playing them was the FRF commons that you'd maybe get.  [Edit 2: I switched Formidable and Ferocious. Whoops. Edited that.]"
lrcast,3cbssw,mtg_liebestod,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:59:53 2015 UTC,"3 very good points you make.  I never even realized what you said about Formidable vs Ferocious, but it's true. I give those mechanics an average grade, they were fine. Not every mechanic needs to blow our minds.  Re: 2 color format, they really could have done more to boost the enemy color pairs in FRF. Of the 5 enemy colored commons in FRF, Harsh Sustenance and Grim Contest were playable and the other 3 almost never made my decks. Cunning Strike's power level was fine, but UR was such a bad archetype it didn't matter. The UG double manifest card was not enticing, didn't really reward you for taking the risk of being in a weird color pair. And War Flare rarely made the cut because red decks already had a Magma Chasm in their deck by the time they opened the FRF pack, which was just a far superior card."

Especially considering Khans has become my favorite draft format of all time. Does it compare to the fun we all had drafting Khans? Not by a long shot, but do I like this more than Avacyn Restored or Dragon's Maze    The format was pretty consistent, and I more than half the time went 3-0 at FNM so I can't complain."
lrcast,3cbssw,TheJediCounsel,2,Mon Jul 6 23:28:44 2015 UTC,"Listening to this article made me think of something killingagoldfish reviews wrote about Mark Rosewater. That all of his articles effectively have ""Paid Advertisement"" written at the top. How today he talks about all the mistakes they were aware of while designing Kamigawa block, but his articles from when the set released only had praises for it. And in this podcast, there's stuff like ""it's not as bad as Avacyn Restored"". Yeah, well, okay.  Marshall and LSV really tiptoed around the fact that this draft format was miserable. Carefully avoided the question of 'are you looking forward to coming back to DDF later?' because I think it's a unanimous NO from every magic player.  Compare it to KtK where the draft format evolved, morphing from the natural clans, to 5 color decks, then to GR punch + other 2 color aggro, and even on the last GP it was revolutionized again by Fabiano delve. In constrast, DtK devolved. We quickly found the exploit deck and the strongest colors, but then the cat was out of the bag. RB became overdrafted and Jeskai Sage/Sultai Emissary weren't floating around anymore. What replaced those strategies? Nothing.  DTK failed on synergy and the build-arounds (Dashlords, Salt Road Ambushers, Skywise Teachings, the whole 4+ toughness theme) were complete flops in draft. GW was a pile, UW had a identity crisis between control and tempo, and UG/BG just had zero support.  In the end, Dragons of Tarkir was complete, but boring. And I'd make an objection to anyone that says Wizards did a good job on this limited format."
lrcast,3cbssw,LSV__,23,Mon Jul 6 18:47:44 2015 UTC,"Dunno, I do tend to prefer to be positive over negative, but I honestly don't think this format was bad. It wasn't super exciting (as I noted when I said I did like 20 or whatever drafts instead of the 50 I often do in a format), but I wouldn't put this on a list of bad draft formats. KTK was a good format, for sure, so maybe this suffers in comparison, but Core Set was the best way to describe this, and I do not think that Core Sets are awful Magic."

I compared it to core set draft and called it solid. I stand by that and don't think that it even comes close to a rave review, and certainly falls well short of the shilling that you are suggesting we do but that we would never would.   Also you are speaking for a lot of players when you assume that ""a unanimous NO from every other magic player."" is the answer. A lot of people really liked this format."
lrcast,3cbssw,sylverfyre,2,Tue Jul 7 05:51:07 2015 UTC,"I know you guys spent a lot of time pointing out its flaws, but you still came away calling it balanced and a B+ set.   My middle school english teacher was a complete sweetheart. She'd always find the tiny nugget of value in the nonsense we turned in as homework assignments. Ace her class if you can find two pieces of symbolism in the Scarlet Letter. She'd hang a picture of you behind her desk if you could name three Shakespeare plays. Take you on a vacation exploring Europe if you could identify the verb of a sentence.  But I still don't think she'd bring herself to give DTK a B+.  On the shilling thing, I do apologize."
lrcast,3cbssw,Muscadine76,3,Tue Jul 7 08:29:59 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I give good ratings to sets that are reasonably balanced, have good gameplay, and don't have any glaring inherent flaws. I think DTK met this criteria even if it wasn't an all-timer for me."
lrcast,3cbssw,flooey,7,Tue Jul 7 20:07:48 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the format just fine. My interpretation of Marshall and LSV not coming down harder on the format is that they felt it wasn't too bad. It was enjoyable from the start and good for a reasonable number of drafts. It wasn't revolutionary or incredible but honestly, I don't think it was supposed to be.  It was an experiment by wizards to see if they could design a format that was drafted in such an odd way. Considering how tough it is to have a transition set like FTR which had enough support for 3 color decks in KTK/FTR but not too much unnecessary fixing or multicolor cards for FTR/DTK, I applaud them. The fact that it was nowhere near as bad as a format like full RTR block is kind of a win in my book.  That being said, nobody told R&D to enact these kinds of restrictions on themselves so its tough to give them credit for doing an adequate job for a self-imposed difficult task."
lrcast,3cbssw,Nerdwah,6,Mon Jul 6 19:21:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure I agree with you.  It wasn't my favorite draft format, but it was ""fine"".  It was pretty pedestrian, there were some synergies but not heavy enough to make archetype-decks except for UB exploit.    I wouldn't call it a complete failure, but it was not amazing.  That said, it wasn't awful either.  Focusing a theme on ""big fliers"" is a very scary proposition for limited because it's basically saying ""This set is going to have a lot of bombs in it that are inherently not that easy to answer in a limited format"" and I was honestly expecting it to crash and burn out of the gate, especially after the poor reception of Fate Reforged.  It surprised me, partly by being a fast enough format that the dragons didn't just take over the format completely, and further impressed me that the Fate Reforged was better positioned in this format.  So, I agree that it wasn't great, but it won't go down in history as ""awful"" I don't think.  It will just fade into memory like many other draft formats."
lrcast,3cbssw,Nerdwah,3,Mon Jul 6 19:54:21 2015 UTC,"I guess I agree with a fair amount of what you're saying but not the main point.  I agree in that I don't think DTK is as good at KTK, there were clearly stronger color combinations that you wanted to draft if possible, and my enjoyment of the format has worn down fairly quickly.  On the other hand, I don't agree that was avoided in this episode - I came to the episode thinking this week that I was kind of tired of the format and I kept hearing things that fell in line with my thinking.  I'm pretty sure that at one or more points in the podcast both Marshall and LSV said something to the effect that they were done playing and glad to be moving on to another format.  I think their argument that DTK felt ""core-ish"" seems pretty spot on - it's a decent, average draft environment that lacks much depth."
lrcast,3cbssw,cferejohn,-1,Mon Jul 6 19:32:48 2015 UTC,"You know, it's very possible we're all in agreement but just have different ways of showing it. The podcast doesn't love declarative statements, but I love them. I'd like for Marshall and LSV to be more definitive in what they say.  I mean, come on. If you're gonna say that green can't support more than one drafter, then you should just say green is lousy. Don't say 'it's okay'."
lrcast,3cbssw,sylverfyre,3,Mon Jul 6 21:49:13 2015 UTC,"I actually think people just disagree with you.  I think it was about average for a Magic set, which is to say fun but not incredible.  Thinking about the regular draft environments since I came back, it's above average for me: I liked M14, Theros, and Khans more, and I liked Dragon's Maze, Born of the Gods, Journey into Nyx, M15, and Fate Reforged less.  I'm not going to be anxiously awaiting flashback drafts on Magic Online or anything, but I drafted it a few dozen times and it was fun the whole way through."
lrcast,3cbssw,punninglinguist,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:51:23 2015 UTC,Not sure what you're looking for. Saying green can't support more than one drafter tells you to read signals closely and avoid forcing green. Just calling green lousy closes off a color to you and lets that one other guy draft a very strong green deck.
lrcast,3cbssw,SleepingSheeperson,-2,Tue Jul 7 01:02:58 2015 UTC,"Except it doesn't matter if green is open to your right because FRF's green is awful anyways.  The only realistic way to get paid off in green is to force it after a pick 2-3 Epic Confrontation, clamp down on it hard, and hope to get passed good stuff in pack 2. And you're also forced into RG because it's the only supported archetype."
lrcast,3cbssw,mtg_liebestod,8,Tue Jul 7 02:17:12 2015 UTC,"Somehow, I trust the more nuanced opinion of the hosts over your assessment. I've had decent success with green white and have found enough decent stuff in green for FRF.  Temur sabertooth, hunt the weak, abzan beastmaster, etc.   It's not the best color by any means, but often open and a reasonable option due to the perception you're parroting."
lrcast,3cbssw,cferejohn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:33:42 2015 UTC,"Agree. I think it is worth knowing that the FRF green commons are sub-par (3 are nigh unplayable and none of them are better than OK), but that isn't the same as ""Green is lousy."""

There's no draft format that's hated by everyone.  But I've yet to hear anyone say this is their favorite of all time.  Any good set should be some group of players' favorites (for instance, my personal favorite set to draft ever was triple Lorwyn, objectively, it's probably not as good as Innistrad or Eldrazi, but I still liked it best), and I don't think this was anyone's.  And the theme didn't come through at all.  There should have been common dragons."
lrcast,3cbssw,cferejohn,5,Mon Jul 6 20:26:56 2015 UTC,"We quickly found the exploit deck and the strongest colors, but then the cat was out of the bag.   I actually felt it was the opposite - UB was initially hyped but there was a lot of debate over how good the other archetypes were. I think in the end only UW turned out to be lackluster... it just turned out that there was more to building a good deck here than taking the obvious value cards (exploit + exploit fodder)... LSV says this format was mostly about accumulating value but I'm not so sure. The UB deck couldn't just be a pile of Jeskai Sages and Gurmag Drowners... it needed removal, wincons, disruption, etc. and that made drafting a challenge.  That said, I think it was funny that they trashed on rebound pretty hard (fairly imo) but then claimed that none of the mechanics were failures. Uh, how was rebound not a failure?? Most of the decks that tried to build around it ended up being terrible, if only because most of the payoff cards for it were in pack 3 (prowess) and it was risky to gamble on getting them."
lrcast,3cbssw,punninglinguist,3,Mon Jul 6 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"Well Rebound wasn't new, and it has been better done before, so I think you might say the mechanic wasn't a failure, but this manifestation of it may have been. I think they were mostly referring to the new mechanics - dash, exploit, bolster, and formidable. Exploit was definitely the winner there, and Formidable was kind of boring coming off of Ferocious, but they all basically worked."

lrcast,3cbssw,white_lancer,2,Tue Jul 7 18:38:48 2015 UTC,"Letter grades are a funny thing, and I think DTK having a range of C to B+ among different people feels about right.  If you judge DTK in aggregate, it was a solid but not exciting limited format. If you didn't know what you were doing, you'd have an unmanageable pile of a deck, but going for the obvious strategies wasn't an instant-win either. While there's consensus on RB, RG, and UB being ""strong"" there's no consensus on which are ""strongest"" and I never saw a clear strategy emerge. Among those colors, there was lots of back and forth about whether this or that card was more powerful. I think this indicates a fairly consistent power level across commons, and that makes evaluation against your deck more important than evaluation against the set. Even in this discussion, several people feel like there were good candidates for ""best common"" that were overlooked.   The situation wasn't helped by the release of MM2, The Set With Many Abbreviations. A ton of people jumped ship completely, despite loud complaints about poor value and quality. A new Modern Masters is going to overshadow almost any set, and DTK got eclipsed. People can't help but compare DTK to MM2 when reflecting, and it's not a fair comparison. It created a situation in my local meta where the DTK draft was populated mostly by new drafters, and that created an even more confusing and inconsistent draft environment.  I also remember R&D pointing out third sets were a bit of a development challenge for them, so it seems unfair to compare DTK to KTK in the sense that R&D is phasing out these ""third sets"" as an acknowledgement that they rarely compare well to ""first sets"".  Add to this that DTK did manage to have a pretty big impact on Standard and I think the grade should be higher rather than lower. I think a player who plays a lot of Limited and Constructed (as Marshall and LSV do) would assign a grade in the Bs. But I don't think many Limited-only players would go that high, and in a limited-only context I'd rate it more in the C ranges, though I hate to give it a C- as it had a lot of circumstantial disadvantages."

lrcast,3cbssw,Sceptilesolar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:42:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's because they discussed four other cards.

It's interesting to me because I don't recall Efreet ever even being mentioned while Outrider was on the shortlist at first, so I was wondering if people's opinions on it had changed. I also prefer the removal spells to it and I've drafted the Efreet much more often, though that's usually because I think people at my LGS don't value the Efreet properly--I'm not actually sure which one I prefer, but I think they're close."

lrcast,3ca0dw,redblade8,5,Mon Jul 6 07:08:41 2015 UTC,"I'm really not sure how good Mighty Leap is going to be.  My only experience with it in Limited has been Modern Masters 2, where it was very much a card that you only played if you were desperate for playables.  The difference I see here is that there are a lot of 2/2s for 2 with Renown in ORI.  I'm really worried that going second means that you're going to spend most of the early game playing catchup because your opponent hit Renown first and now their first 2 drop is better than all of yours and they can use it to push through more 2 drops.  Mighty Leap looks like it might be able to stop their momentum.  Does that make it playable?  How high up is it on the pick order?"
lrcast,3ca0dw,Blenderhead36,5,Mon Jul 6 11:35:32 2015 UTC,I think we can assume (until finding out differently) that leap would be better in any core set than mm2015 and the presence of renown is likely to make it even higher.

lrcast,3ca0dw,snargaggle,3,Mon Jul 6 08:16:02 2015 UTC,I did a little bit of testing with him. He was terrible. In a vacuum he seemed ok. A valley dasher for aggressive decks.   The difference is that in khans everything was a 2/2 for the first 5 turns of the game. Here there are tonnes of 2/3s and 2/4s so he is just dying unless you activate prowess and there aren't that many cheap ways to do so that are worth playing. Like in aggro decks you can't have all these spells and have a nice curve. Basically you need to be super aggro with several pump spells or auras for him to be playable.

Like, a lot of the time you would attack with your only prowess creature, and people still wouldn't block, even when it was correct to do so, since you're still trading for a card if they cast something, and they aren't adding something to the board.

lrcast,3ca0dw,cosmonaut_88,4,Mon Jul 6 11:01:02 2015 UTC,"Throwing Knife, Sigil of Valor, and the other equipment in general.  Is this just me or is this just the perennial trap with equipment?    Throwing Knife: similar to Vial of dragon fire which was surprisingly playable. Downside, you do need to attack to activate but gaining the added value of creature buff and damage to the player.  Sigil of Valor: 2 to cast, 1 to equip means a response to kill will not ruin your turn most times. A major downside is that it only works on offense, however it's requirement leaves you with a better defense. Almost as if most your creatures had vigilance and they were all 1/1s with prevent all damage dealt to them. In a developing or stalled out board this puts you on the attack immediately. Your OP will likely chump block with a real card and you will not be exposed to an opponent's alpha crackback.  It is not unimaginable to see this do well in a U/W skies deck where something with renown or flying pokes in every turn while cards like Akroan Jailer setting up bad blocks for your op."
lrcast,3ca0dw,IzDaisho,4,Mon Jul 6 12:43:46 2015 UTC,"Throwing Knife seems more like Inferno Fist to me than Vial of Dragonfire. It actually seems quite playable and perhaps even a relatively high pick. Don't forget, there are multiple ways to make 1/1 flyers in this format. Throwing Knife on an evasive creature is just excellent. Even if your opponent mounts a flying defense to stop your creatures you can just trade in combat.  Sigil of Valor also seems like a pretty strong card. It has a mid-level set up cost essentially requiring two other creatures and wanting you to be attacking but it definitely rewards you. It would be great if the card did anything on defense, especially with the 1 equip cost but then it would be too powerful.   Interestingly enough it suffers from the same problem that Exalted could which is that your opponent can tempo you out pretty easily. You are incentivized to only attack with one creature. If your opponent has a way to kill or bounce that creature you get no damage through. Then your opponent can attack back and while you have blockers you don't really want to trade. So the card can definitely lead to awkward situations. In the end I suspect it will still be a strong card but it definitely is not all upside."
lrcast,3ca0dw,Sun_Shine_Dan,3,Mon Jul 6 14:48:54 2015 UTC,"Throwing knife seems like the best equipment you'll get often enough. It's bad  a bonesplitter and a bad shock, both cards I am happy to play. Realistically you'll never have more than two in your pool, which is good, cause two looks to be the limit. Do note that you'll have to work hard to kill three plus toughness creatures.  Sigil of valor is a card I willing to start mainboard and move out. Obviously much better with evasion or trample.   Honestly I don't think I'll get to see these cards too often because I'll have them as mid high picks and not first picks."
lrcast,3ca0dw,oraymw,3,Mon Jul 6 13:48:45 2015 UTC,"Throwing Knife is more like a Bonesplitter than a Vial of Dragon Fire. You don't sacrifice it unless you see something that you really want to kill, but I think that you leave it on the board unless you really need to throw it.  Sigil of Valor - I really thought this would be a great card, but I've done a little testing, and it's not as good as I realized. Yes, it can make one attacker quite big, but you don't really get any value moving it around onto other creatures, and you only get the benefit on attacks. If you ever have to block, then it gets significantly worse, and just throwing the sigil on something to get a little bit more damage doesn't seem very good."

I'll assume you can walk through quadrant theory with him; great at parity, not quite optimal in development/on curve, awesome when winning, and solid when behind.  He seems great in all the spots that aren't developing. If you look at him as ""i play this when this is the last card in my hand"" instead of ""i play this on-curve"" he suddenly gets much better. Wait until that late-game board stall and slam him, and suddenly you get the resources to win the game you'd otherwise lose as you grind out card advantage. Dropping him on curve isn't great, but dropping him later is just going to win the game.  At least that's how I predict it'll go."

lrcast,3ca0dw,telehax,2,Mon Jul 6 10:28:57 2015 UTC,"WB auras is a poor archetype I think. One way to start drafting it is to get multiple uncommon enablers early on so you can safely commit, but the problem is that they are all basically crap without a critical mass, with Totem Guide Hartebeest still being decent because it can pull singleton suppression bonds out from your library.  Probably the ideal way to enter the archetype intentionally (and as opposed to being WB goodstuff with some auras) are getting early consecrated by bloods or knightly valors. Suppression Bonds is the stronger removal aura but in the archetype Weight of the Underworld is probably better because it falls off so you can auramancer it."

Edit: I missed [[Weight of the Underworld]].  Okay, so we have two common enchant removal spells, but they're both 4 mana.

lrcast,3ca0dw,cferejohn,2,Mon Jul 6 20:14:15 2015 UTC,"Can I post a few?  Murder Investigation - With 2 common enchantment-based removal spells is this going to be worth a card? Do you look to side it out? Do you need some of the anthem-y effects to consider it?  Skaab Goliath - Is this a windmill slam first pick or is the exile 2 creatures requirement steeper than I realize? Do I need to prioritize ways to get things in my graveyard if I have this?  Shadows of the Past - Will there be a deck controlling enough to use this or is it just too slow and non-board-affecting to be worth a card?  Call of the Full Moon - It's a huge buff for cheap, but it's even more fragile than most auras. Will there be a deck that is all-in aggressive enough for this to be worth the risk?  Reclaim - My initial impression is that this is bad because it looks like several bad cards from recent sets, but 1 mana, instant speed, and getting any card makes me wonder if this is close enough to drawing a card to make it actually pretty good."
lrcast,3ca0dw,IzDaisho,3,Mon Jul 6 13:54:00 2015 UTC,"Murder Investigation- This was just an unplayable card in its last printing. I expect it to be similar. I haven't checked at how much bounce or exile or pacifism effects there are in the format but those cards can all retroactively two for one you, even if you are careful not to play it into open mana. In the end I suspect the reward is not worth the risk and that it will be unplayable.  Skaab Goliath- This was a good card in Innistrad but there are a couple of wrinkles. Firstly Innistrad had a significant amount of ways to dump cards into the graveyard on already playable creatures. This allowed you to abuse the yard much more than im most format. The next bit is that there were so many ways to abuse the graveyard. Anywhere from more Zombies that exile like Stitched Drake to Spider Spawning, you creatures in your graveyard were a resource. In this format, if they're not nearly as much of a resource, Skaab Goliath may just be great. I expect it should be a card that you never pass if you're in Blue.  Shadows of the Past is an interesting card. It looks to have inevitability if the game goes long as well as a minor effect in the early game. Reaper of the Wilds had the same ability but it was really just a throw in on an already great card so it's difficult to evaluate how strong Scry 1 will be. I suspect the card will be too slow, but as you mention, if there is a deck with strong enough early defense that just wants a slow inevitable win condition this might suffice. I suspect there should be a random large creature that would do a better job.  Call of the Full Moon is also a crazy card. Definitely one where if you play on T2 or T3 on the play your opponent may not be able to get rid of it or profitably block the creature before it gets 2-3 attacks in. If the card enables a 2/2 to attack and hits 2-3 times it's probably going to be worth playing. Worst case scenario is you draw it in the late game when your opponent is holding on to a couple of removal spells or just is at the point where they can play two spells in a turn. This seems like a situation where we need to see if there's an extremely aggressive deck that can make use of this card. No matter what it will be an annoying card to lose to, and you will lose to it.  Reclaim is not good enough. All you are doing is essentially shuffling your deck and putting a slightly better card on top. You might have drawn a better card anyway. So you need a situation where you have some extremely powerful cards that will routinely go to the graveyard. Marshall and Luis have been commenting on this nearly every episode lately and it deserves repeating but in a world where most of the spells are of similar power level, you do not want to discard a card just to get to reuse one at some point down the road."
lrcast,3ca0dw,cferejohn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:40:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the responses! I only started playing again in Theros, so I hadn't played with the reprints. I'm still a little curious about Reclaim. I understand what you are saying, but the fact that it's a 1 mana instant cantrip that at least nominally gives you some card selection makes me feel like the downside is pretty negligible and if I have some ways to put cards in the yard (and there are a few) then ""average power of card I pick from my graveyard"" is definitely going to be higher than ""average power of card off the top of my deck""."
lrcast,3ca0dw,IzDaisho,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:21:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed! If the card was 1 mana instant, put a card from your graveyard into your hand it would be a good card. In fact it would probably be a broken card. The card Treasure Find is similar but costs BG, is a sorcery and exiles itself upon resolution.   Unfortunately, Reclaim only puts it on top of your library it is nowhere near that level. If it's difficult to understand exactly why putting a card on top of your library is much worse than drawing think about it like the card reads ""Next turn, instead of your draw step, put a card into your hand from the graveyard"". Essentially, Reclaim puts you down a card."
lrcast,3ca0dw,cferejohn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:00:25 2015 UTC,"Oh. Derp. You know in my brain you were putting it in your hand. All right, mea culpa, yeah, being down a card is not worth the marginally improved selection except in the corneriest of cases (unbeatable bomb + was to self mill)."
lrcast,3ca0dw,IzDaisho,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:10:20 2015 UTC,"Definitely a reasonable thing to mix up. Anyway, of course Reclaim will be a strong card in a situation where you are dying to one flyer and have your removal spell in the graveyard. Or when you can mill your completely unbeatable bomb. But as you pointed out, definitely corner cases and over the long run this card is just not going to be worth it."
lrcast,3ca0dw,pahamack,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:35:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think Skaab Goliath is going to be any good. In Innistrad it wasn't even that high a pick and that had a lot more enablers. Not being able to cast your 6 drop even if you have the mana is brutal, bounce effects may just take care of it for good, and it's not like the payoff is fantastic."
lrcast,3ca0dw,IzDaisho,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"Well I think the key difference between Innistrad and now is the amount that you want to be using your graveyard. The major point is that there are fewer ways to enable Goliath but there is also less competition with the role it takes up. I agree that Goliath was not an amazingly high pick, but that was mainly because there were always good replacements. Now it's competing with some pretty unimpressive stuff.  It's also important to note that it's difficult to compare the value of a card like Skaab Goliath across different formats. Innistrad was not at all about making a big threat and killing your opponent with it. Many decks did significantly more powerful things and attacked from different angles. Origins is powerful and seems to have cool synergies but it still seems quite creature dependent, and Skaab Goliath is going to be the biggest creature.  All that being said, I think the jury is still out on Skaab Goliath in Origins. I'm going to start on the idea that the card is great and a high pick until proven otherwise, but wouldn't fault anyone for starting elsewhere."
lrcast,3ca0dw,pahamack,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:04:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm starting from I'd rather take a random bear than this guy. I have high requirements for anything more expensive than 5. Essentially I wouldn't be against having a deck having 0 6 drops, so if I wanted one I want it to be better than this.  It's vulnerable not just to hard removal. There's a new time ebb in the format for 3. That could quickly make your skaab goliath uncastable."

BCSM - I have more creatures than my opponent, I cast this and attack. They lose most of their defenders and my extras get through for a bunch of damage. Or perhaps we're racing and I use this to finish off the race.   However, these scenarios seems too unlikely. Other times they'll have more creatures (ground guys + 1/1 thopters perhaps?) and they can afford to chump block. If they're picking off my creatures or forcing trades, this spell does very little. Obviously if I'm not at 6 mana is does nothing...  My inclination is to give this a C- or so for being too conditional, but look to grab it for specific decks. However, I wonder if I'm underrating it..."
lrcast,3ca0dw,oraymw,2,Mon Jul 6 15:13:36 2015 UTC,I think that Joraga Invocation is one of the best uncommons in the set.

lrcast,3ca0dw,Greyfeld,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:11:45 2015 UTC,"Avoricious Dragon is an aggro card.  You drop it on curve once you've already dumped your whole hand onto the board.  It's meant to give you fuel to keep pushing out threats.  In no way are you meant to play this card in a control deck.  For me, one of the cards I'm curious about is Sword of the Animist.  It sounds amazing on paper, effectively milling all the lands out of your deck, so you're less likely to get dead draws (plus the obvious benefit of mana fixing), but I'm not sure +1/+1 is a good enough board presence to be worth a deck slot in Limited.  Since the immediate effect is equivalent of Veteran's Sidearm (which isn't really worth a deck slot), I'm curious how powerful the deck-thinning ability will be, and if it's viable to run in anything other than a control deck (which will get the most use out of what is essentially prolonged card advantage.)."
lrcast,3ca0dw,fkwillrice,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:46:00 2015 UTC,"I think Sword of the Animist is sweet, it reminds me of Prime Time and how much he just ends games by making sure your top decks are always nonlands. Obviously that's a huge hyperbole, though. Let's be more realistic.  The +1/+1 is mediocre. You want your equipment to give a little bit more than that, especially at equip 2. The good news about equip 2 is that it's very easy to move between creatures post-combat. I think this card has certain decks it goes awesomely in and others it's kinda miserable. If you're trying to make a slower, green-based midrange-to-control deck and are trying to ramp into a large bomb, this is going to help you get there. That's where this card is best. If you're trying to be aggressive and beat down, this is pretty much just wasting a slot that could be used on a better creature or removal. I personally think this card will be underrated, and I think it's definitely right to side it out against more aggressive decks, but in a slow, grindy mirror it's gonna do work."

However anything else than the plain oracle text is not allowed.   The booklets from the Fat-Packs are usually used. Yes, they are not there by that time. Also programms/apps that only show the oracle texts can be allowed for foreigners if otherwise a judge were to stand by that player during the whole tournament.   See, with your spreadsheet you have access to information the other player does not have = full list of cards. You could look up battle-tricks or other things the opponent could cast. So your ""disadvantage"" is turned into a huge ""advantage"" all for a sudden.   Also sorting it by ""CMC"" is (usually) not allowed. You could sort them by collectors number which is the same worldwide, no matter what the card in the country would be in the corresponding alphabet.   Since it is Rule inforcement Level Regular  you should (!) be fine when you talk to the Tournament Organizer or Judge and find a solution.

lrcast,3c8yej,Lief098,6,Mon Jul 6 00:33:10 2015 UTC,"I would definitely take Pyrotechnics, and it's not close for me.  Mob Rule is a finisher. It's a finisher that clears blockers, and gives you some extra power. It costs 6 mana, does nothing when you're behind, and isn't even guaranteed to get you there when you're in a board stall if your board isn't developed enough (and aggressive decks like this don't always get out of board stalls easily).  Pyrotechnics, on the other hand, can often clear out one or two blockers permanently, deal with a big threat, or, if you need it to, deal the last few points of damage to the face. Sometimes it can do multiple things.   Pyrotechnics is a little worse at the point in the game when Mob Rule is best, but it's also better at every other point in the game than Mob Rule, while still being a reasonable finisher.  Or maybe this is partly my bias: I prefer not to play board state-dependent swingy cards when I can avoid it.  Bigger question: What's with the Deadly Wanderings? It seems odd to have a 5 mana card that only does something when you have one creature, and a 6 mana card that's only good when you have a lot of creatures."
lrcast,3c8yej,CelestialBeekeeper,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:30:26 2015 UTC,"I've played against Deadly Wanderings a fair number of times lately, and it always seems to overperform. This is the first time I tried the card, as I suspected it would be better in a deck with a good amount of dash and creatures that traded easily. Of the times I drew it, it was usually very good. The one notable exception was against a mono-white deck with at least 2 pacifisms, and I simply sided it out."
lrcast,3c8yej,mtgorrah,5,Mon Jul 6 14:41:36 2015 UTC,I would take mob rule.
lrcast,3c8yej,Sceptilesolar,4,Mon Jul 6 01:20:58 2015 UTC,"I think I would prefer Mob Rule. Your deck has a pretty good aggro curve already. It's certainly close, though; Pyrotechnics is an awesome card. But I think Mob Rule adds more to the deck."
lrcast,3c8yej,HKShwa,3,Mon Jul 6 01:34:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback guys! I ended up taking the Pyrotechnics because I think it does more when you're behind, but I think either pick is defensible."
lrcast,3c8yej,bearrosaurus,3,Mon Jul 6 02:06:19 2015 UTC,"Personally take pyrotechnics.  Better when behind but also can smash to the face if needed.  Mob Rule is amazing and will almost certainly win the game at parity/when ahead, but if you're seriously in the tank I am not sure it can stabilize for you. Still, that's got to be the best feeling; choosing between two legit finishers that work perfectly in your deck."
lrcast,3c8yej,beepbloopbloop,7,Mon Jul 6 05:17:50 2015 UTC,"It's Mob Rule. How is this even a question?  Just in case you need a justification. DDF boards stall out constantly, and Mob Rule is a sure win on board stalls. And it can outright steal games that you have no right to win."
lrcast,3c8yej,Wilhelml,5,Mon Jul 6 01:14:15 2015 UTC,"The top 2 answers are both of them saying that it's not close, so I think it's a question. I'd probably take pyrotechnics since it's always good, while Mob Rule is often kind of awkwardly stuck in your hand when they have some big guys and some small guys. It's also really bad when you're far behind."
lrcast,3c8yej,fremeer,5,Mon Jul 6 01:22:56 2015 UTC,"I'm taking Mob Rule, although the safer pick is Pyrotechnics. You're not lacking for removal spells but you don't have very many end game threats (also I don't know about playing Deadly Wanderings). Mob Rule gives you an out to just brute force your way to an end game and just win despite of this. It is pretty close though."
lrcast,3c8yej,Nizzahon,2,Mon Jul 6 01:18:29 2015 UTC,in this case i think both are decent options.  mob rule is a great card in that you basically make it impossible for the opponent to come out on top. at anything other then when you completely being dominated it will win the game.   however pyrotechnics is more versatile.   i would take mob rule because its a better hail mary then pyrotechnics. i would nearly always prefer to top deck mob rule then pyrotechnics

lrcast,3c6hoq,TuesdayRB,7,Sun Jul 5 15:00:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is pretty nice ""what happened here?"" puzzle to work out who was doing the Hunt the Weak fighting:  We know that Seeker of the Way died, so it must have had at least 3 damage dealt to it (after prowess). Furthermore, it must have been exactly 3 damage, because 4+ damage would have killed the Abzan Falconer too. This means we can rule out the Windscout and the Mystic because either would have had 4 power by fight time after prowess and the 1/+1 counter happens.  But we can do even better! We know Jezdog gained 21 life, implying that the seeker dealt 3 damage to 7 things: each players and 5 creatures, and since there are only 5 creatures other than the Seeker, that's 3 damage each. If Hunt the Weak targeted the Tuskguard Captain then it would have been dealt damage TWICE (once from the fight, which it survives, and once from the Arcbond trigger) and Jezdog would have gained an extra 3. Therefore we can conclude that it was the Skullkeeper that was targeted, which died in the fight and did not receive additional Arcbond damage.  QED.  [EDIT! I forgot that of course damage was dealt to Jezdog too! So he took 3 and gained 24, so it must have been the Tuskguard doing the fighting after all. Which makes far more sense from the opponent's seat too. Magic is hard eh?]"

Often, a creature with menace can get outclassed in the midgame, this helps you eliminate the outclassing blockers and also deal 4, for one mana.

lrcast,3c54s7,Darkside-,10,Sat Jul 4 21:52:10 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I may have gone a little deep on this, but it was a lot of fun trying to find the cool interactions between random cards:   Zendikar's Roil + Evolving Wilds = You play Evolving, get a 2/2. Sac Evolving for a basic, get another 2/2. Valor in Akros + (activated) Starfield of Nyx = Valor entering the battlefield as a 4/4 creature and triggering its own effect, giving you a temporary anthem. Thought this might work with Sigil of the Empty Throne as well, but that card's ability triggers on cast, so I believe the angel token will enter the battlefield before Valor does, preventing the trigger. :( Thopter Engineer + Artifact Creatures = I haven't seen too many people discussing it, but Engineer gives all artifact creatures haste. Her thopter and all others after it swing for one in the air the turn they spawn, and the same goes for all other artifact creatures in the set. Like, say, Mage-Ring Responder. Tragic Arrogance + Multi-Type Cards = If your opponent has a bunch of Enchantment Creatures due to a Starfield of Nyx, you can choose one of them as both a creature and an enchantment, so your opponent gets to keep one less permanent. Conversely, if you have two artifact creatures, you can choose one as an artifact and one as a creature to keep both. Acolyte of the Inferno + Touch of Moonglove = If your opponent blocks with anything, it instantly dies and they take 2 damage for each blocking creature. On that note: Chandra's Ignition + Deathtouch = Duneblast. Kothophed + Act of Treason = If the Treason'd creature dies, you still draw a card and lose a life. Kothophed only cares that the creature is owned by the opponent, not controlled. Lastly (for now), Sphinx's Tutelage + card draw = Assuming Tutelage isn't removed, the worst case scenario is that your opponent now has ~10 turns to win (they draw one, you draw and mill them for 2, that's 3 cards a turn and likely 1/10 of their deck by the time you're playing this). If you start drawing extra cards and Tutelage's effect repeats itself a couple of times, then your opponent may be looking at a 5-6 turn clock. This potential increases drastically with multiple copies. I could actually see a dedicated Mill/Control deck winning some games, but I'm not exactly sure how many just yet. Truth be told, now I kinda want to make a standard deck with a playset of Tutelage, enchantment recursion, card draw, and counters/removal. No one will expect a mill deck in a set with Delve and Deathmist! :P"
lrcast,3c54s7,Demicorn,3,Sun Jul 5 05:06:06 2015 UTC,Starfield of Nyx is not playable in limited. Also this little interaction will NEVER occur in limited because you need FIVE enchantments under your control for them to become creatures. If you're playing a wide strategy there are better effects such as Kytheon's Tactics or Ampryn Tactician IMO.
lrcast,3c54s7,phasmy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:55:12 2015 UTC,"The point is to was simply to mention that it's an interaction that can happen. And it probably will happen, once or twice in the thousands of games of limited Origins which end up being played, to someone who decided to really force the deck.  Besides, I just like finding weird interactions. Who ever said anything about practicality? :P  Edit: Also, originally, I was actually thinking about the interaction for Sigil of the Empty Throne and thought it was interesting before I realized it wouldn't work. I then saw that it... technically worked with Starfield of Nyx and figured I'd mention both interactions even if they're unlikely to come up."
lrcast,3c54s7,Demicorn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:14:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like there's an opportunity for a mill deck in this set somewhere. Sphinx's tutelage is just an uncommon, so it's possible to get more than one. Then you have Dreadwaters at common and Returned Centaur also at common. Tutelage and the Centaur would probably be the really important cards, along with bounce and kill spells, of course.   Probably not an archetype your should be shooting for, but it's definitely going to be available some of the time."

lrcast,3c54s7,wetwilly92,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:29:29 2015 UTC,"Sphinx's tutelage can only target your opponents. As far as the self mill deck, it has two common enablers, the screeching skaab and the returned centaur, and I do not think it will be enough to draft a deck from. Blue mages will be interested in the skaab because it's one of the few blue 2-drops (and the only one with 2 power, I believe) and while you could probably get as many returned centaurs as you want, having your main self-mill engine at 4 is not the greatest, and having many returned centuars probably wont be great for your curve.

lrcast,3c54s7,SinibusUSG,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:04:12 2015 UTC,There appears to be a good bit of token synergy in this set. Ampiryn Tactician is a nice anthem on a stick.
lrcast,3c54s7,wetwilly92,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:31:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Tactician is the kind of card I want in this deck a lot more than Valor in Akros, which is just something that helps you push forward an already positive board state without helping to build one."
lrcast,3c54s7,SinibusUSG,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:47:21 2015 UTC,"I think that generally if you want an anthem and you can play either, you want the tactician or Kytheon Tactics, both are quite playable and pretty good at pumping the team.  If you have a bunch of thopters, you probably want war horn to help with your artifact synergies."

Renown is going to be important enough that Shambling Ghoul is going to look like some nice synergy to opponents. Guessing even at 2/3 for 2 that card will somehow not meet the C+ expectations it was given by this community.  Jhessian Thief is pretty well supported. Anchor to the Aether, Claustrophobia, Disperse, Send to Sleep, Separatist Voidmage, Stratus Walk, and Whirler Rogue are all strong follow-ups. This also makes me think that, while renown isn't actually in blue, it's going to be one of the best enablers for that deck."

lrcast,3c6ry1,deworde,2,Sun Jul 5 11:18:20 2015 UTC,"Whats a backdraft?  MaRo's advice for drafting UnSets is to draft it with a Core Set. Conspiracy is a little silly like a Unset, might be worth chucking in some m15."
lrcast,3c6ry1,daveclarkeart,2,Sun Jul 5 11:55:07 2015 UTC,In backdraft you try to draft as bad a pool as possible. After you're finished drafting you'll give your pool to another player. You get points for winning matches with the pool you're given and also for when the other player loses with the pool you drafted.

lrcast,3c6ry1,CelestialBeekeeper,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:28:29 2015 UTC,I think the key to making it enjoyable is to play it in a format where it is hard to draft a miserable pool.  Something with a high power level floor like cube for instance.
lrcast,3c6ry1,carpeamentum,2,Mon Jul 6 19:28:17 2015 UTC,In backdraft it's always important to try and draft as few creatures as possible and in as many colours.   Just be warned that walls is actually an archetype so don't get any vent sentinels to actually turn that on.
lrcast,3c6ry1,Theangryhermit,2,Sun Jul 5 12:02:03 2015 UTC,"In general you want to stay away from fixing and spread your picks on all the colors. Avoid creatures and draft situational cards highly, even if they are powerful. This is good for all backdrafts.  Conspiracy has a fairly large number of cards with very little impact, e.g. [[Reito Lantern]], [[Grixis Illusionist]], etc. But be aware that ANY card can be scary in multiples if you end up getting one of the better conspiracies as your last card. So it might be worth it to take slightly more powerful cards, if it allows you to draft as few multiples as possible.  Will you be playing 1vs1 or 4-player free for all?"

lrcast,3c4v11,NinjaDeathStrike,6,Sat Jul 4 20:21:53 2015 UTC,"He's expensive, but literally he's Double Abyss. Just flat out kills two creatures every turn, plus he has pseudo-vigilance."
lrcast,3c4v11,Sceptilesolar,5,Sat Jul 4 21:06:49 2015 UTC,"He's good, but he's no Hexplate Golem.  In all seriousness, seven-drop bombs have historically been playable in sealed and I doubt Origins is different. And yes, it is a lower-grade bomb; he stabilises the ground very easily when it comes down, then generates card advantage. The one thing stopping it from being a True Bomb (tm) is that it doesn't generate value when you cast it, which is something you really expect out of a seven drop these days.  It's probably good in draft, too. However, every colour pair has access to at least one answer to it at common, so in Sealed, it can die pretty easily."
lrcast,3c4v11,BonSequitur,4,Sat Jul 4 23:07:24 2015 UTC,"He's a bit of an ""I am the plan"" card. He basically says ""I am all you will be doing till your opponent finds a way to deal with me"". But if you can hit 7 mana, that seems like an acceptable deal."
lrcast,3c4v11,deworde,3,Sun Jul 5 08:08:31 2015 UTC,I predict he will get a C+ from Marshall and a B from LSV. I think that basically covers the range of it. In draft he's harder to cast but still a good card that goes in most decks. In sealed he's pretty much an autoinclude and happily so. Will play though can see this card not working out because I cannot cast it or he gets dealt with before attacking.
lrcast,3c4v11,SharkFinnigan,2,Sun Jul 5 05:23:35 2015 UTC,"I think you're way off, this is going to be something like an A-. If you untap with this essentially you can just shoot their best guy every turn, while keeping up a blocker.   Being colorless is also a huge bonus. C+ is good filler. This is a bomb."
lrcast,3c4v11,pahamack,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:06:26 2015 UTC,"The seven mana is what's doing it for me. I think it may be a faster format than we are used to. I don't see getting to 7 mana a guarantee, and if you cannot cast this card, it's not going to help you.  I personally think it's a B, but I don't think it's an A- for mana cost and lack of immediate impact on board. On board it's strong but can we get it on board and have it stick? That's the ultimate question with this card."
lrcast,3c4v11,SharkFinnigan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:36:06 2015 UTC,"""lack of immediate impact on the board""? It's a 7/7!   You know what else dies to removal? Dromoka the Eternal. Yes, I've cast pacifism on it and it was quite a blowout. I'm still 1st picking it every time. It's a card that takes over the board, becomes the most important thing on there. This is a mana more but colourless. It's not as strong of course, lifelink is just brutal, but if you untap with this you don't need to cast anything else to win. Not many cards can do that."
lrcast,3c4v11,pahamack,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:35:13 2015 UTC,"I never said I wouldn't first pick it out of the pack. But you have to consider the speed before rating the card too highly. It's a good card and in an average speed format you are likely able to cast it. But if this was gatecrash, you wouldn't even consider first picking this. The mana more is more significant than having 2 mana symbols (even if one is a splash). It does stop attackers on the ground but evasion still sneaks by him. He doesn't bring extra bodies or shoot anything down or give you card advantage. It's a big body that if it gets a turn is essentially game.   It's not an A card to me. It's a B+ at best and I'd still first pick this in a heartbeat. Its susceptible to blowouts (incidental artifact removal could nab this).  If I pick this, I'm trying to force green and make sure to hit my land drops because if I miss one, it's that more likely that I don't cast this card."
lrcast,3c4v11,SharkFinnigan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:39:12 2015 UTC,"C+ doesn't quite sound right to me. It's hard to say because it's the kind of card that's pretty good...if you get to 7 mana. And then it only blocks one thing, and you have to be able to attack for it to do damage. But on the other hand, it has pseudo-vigilance, so it does get to attack then untap if needed to block, which makes it a lot easier to attack with it. I wonder how much removal in the set can actually take it out? But at the 7 mana point in the game, your opponent might already have used a lot of their removal."
lrcast,3c4v11,Sspifffyman,2,Sun Jul 5 22:32:57 2015 UTC,"Your last point is true, but will you get to 7 mana and not be in a losing position? If you get this to stick, it's undeniably strong. But it may just sit in your hand and do nothing.   I would rate it as a B (mana cost and lack of immediate impact), but I'm guessing Marshall gives it a C+ because he wouldn't think you get to that cost that often.   It's a strong card but is the format faster that 7 drops don't get cast that often."
lrcast,3c4v11,SharkFinnigan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:40:38 2015 UTC,"yeah good points. I would probably run it at the prerelease if my deck ended up slow at all. Also, hi! You know who I am? :P"

lrcast,3c4v11,Greyfeld,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:24:26 2015 UTC,"He's pure card advantage.  If your opponent doesn't have an unconditional removal spell (there are a few, though, so be wary), he can just completely dominate the board.  And since he serves as repeated removal, it doesn't hurt nearly as much to pay that 7 every turn to untap him.  That said, I think he's going to have a hard time against blue stall decks.  They have a shit ton of bounce this set, and having to play him more than once is going to really clog up your hand."
lrcast,3c4v11,mrcjtm,4,Sat Jul 4 21:32:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, if he gets bounced a bunch that's going to be rough. BUT I suppose it's worth mentioning that the best removal spell in blue appears to be claustrophobia -- and this seems pretty good against that."
lrcast,3c4v11,sarmhan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:58:05 2015 UTC,"He seems like an excellent finisher in sealed. It's important that you can usually kill the opponent's biggest threat when you first attack, which will usually halt your opponent's ability to race you. You also don't have to spend the 7 mana to untap at any specific time- you can attack with him, then leave up mana until the end of your opponent's turn, allowing you to leave up instants."
lrcast,3c4v11,Nizzahon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:13:41 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, I think he is also probably playable in draft, provided you have a deck with lots of removal and need a big finisher, he definitely fits that bill."
lrcast,3c4v11,priceQQ,0,Sun Jul 5 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"he costs 14 mana before he does anything, and there is [[Smash to Smithereens]] in this set, so the potential for tempo blowout is about as insane as the power level of this guy if he goes unanswered."
lrcast,3c4v11,gregariousbarbarian,2,Sun Jul 5 21:04:35 2015 UTC,WHAT? He's 7 mana and he doesn't enter the field tapped. So for 7 mana you get a 7/7 blocker as soon as he hits the field and a 7 dmg removal spell as soon as he attacks. You'll usually pay 7 to untap him because he is a 7 DAMAGE REMOVAL SPELL.

After averaging out the values across each color, White seemed to be the best by a fair bit.   Red was close to White when looking at just creatures, but seemed to have a few more useless noncreature spells.   Green looked to be the worst. A lot of the Green noncreature spells looked pretty bad."
lrcast,3c4ctv,aeolus154,2,Sat Jul 4 19:38:55 2015 UTC,"This is almost exactly where I'm at too. Good to hear I'm not alone. Red has a couple of decent removal spells at common at least, even if some of the other ones are pretty mediocre."
lrcast,3c4ctv,NinjaDeathStrike,2,Sat Jul 4 20:12:07 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, because I found the exact opposite when I did my own analysis.  http://i.imgur.com/JxzuwbX.png (Ratings are the same as Grade, so a B gets a 3, a C+ gets a 2.33, etc.)  http://i.imgur.com/9Z0Bp14.png ('Good' grade means C or above, junk means C- and below)  While White seems great also, green looks to be the strongest in terms of statistics for non-rares. 19-20 good non-rares vs 10-11 junk. Although you're right about its noncreature spells being bad, all except 3 or 4 (if you count Sylvan Messenger) of its creatures are fine playables.  I did my analysis with the help of Jake's articles and evaluations.  That said, seems like most people here agree with you about Green so I'll have to rethink about what I've been doing."
lrcast,3c4ctv,Malarazz,2,Mon Jul 6 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"I looked briefly at your numbers for Green.  I think the biggest difference is that you translated grades into partial points. I was pretty strict about giving out whole points, so a lot of your C+ cards would have been a 2 in my scale. There looks to be enough C+/D+ grades that it may have affected the sums a bit. Similarly, if I was calculating ""junk"" counts, I would only include 1's, which would would basically only be D+ and below on your scale.  I'd be curious to run my evaluations through your system. I might play with the numbers tonight and see what happens.  The general issue I have with green is the smallish bodies on a lot of the creatures. Seems like it could be hard to get some of the renown creatures to trigger late game.  I don't see much of an end game for the Elf tribal stuff outside of Shaman of the Pack or Joraga Invocation (which seems fine, but is definitely no Overrun)."

It also has a conditional elf board wipe (-2/-2 to all non-elves) and a cheap deathtoucher that you have to pay mana for, a la hateblade.  Red has shock (2 damage for 1 mana on creatures only), and a really expensive lightning strike (4 mana for 3 damage), and a beefed up collateral damage (sac to deal 5).  Blue has an enchantment that taps target creature and it doesn't untap. Turn to frog (Target creature becomes a 1/1 frog) returns as well as a less conditional whisk away.

lrcast,3c4ctv,NinjaDeathStrike,3,Mon Jul 6 23:11:57 2015 UTC,"White seems head and shoulders better than the other colors from what I've seen. I've been building sealed pools all day and I find myself ending up in Wx more than 50% of the time. Now take this with a grain of salt, there's always a little bit suspicion with sealed pool generators, but white seems to have really deep commons and uncommons. Most of the renown creatures are fine on their own and excellent if you can get the renown triggers. Suppresion bonds being fetchable with Totem-guide Heartbeast and retrievable with Auramancer is awesome. Not sure about the other white Auras, I think Grasp of the Hiewromancer may be worth in it an aggressive deck? It seems like it could make openings for renown creatures to get in.  After White I really like red. Solid creatures and some decent removal at common. I think you're supposed to play all of the thopter generators you get? At least the red ones all seem good.  Green has been the color I'm in least. I feel like green and black are hurt by the Elf tribal stuff. A lot of the elves are really underwhelming without synergy, and opening enough of them to make it work seems unlikely. This means you often end up with a very mediocre Green and Black pool. Black at least has some kill spells (albeit at five mana, but that seems ok in sealed), but green just seems wanting.  These are just my impressions. I'm sure the seeded packs will change things up, and again, I can never fully trust a sealed pool generator. There's a few cards I have yet to open, and others I seems to open everytime. Hard to tell if it's just variance or a bug in the system."

They won't have the same removal suite as red or black, but being able to repeatedly tap down or bounce back your opponent's creatures so they can't do what they want to do on the board seems pretty solid to me."

These were my findings:  Best Color for commons/uncommons from first to fifth: Red, White, Green, Black, Blue  For Rares/Mythics: Red, Black, White, Green, Blue  I think Red looks the best, but because of personal color preference, I think I will pick Black for prerelease."

lrcast,3c4d7s,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,5,Sat Jul 4 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"Do you have cards you very much want to protect? If you're relying on a few very good finishers, counterspells are vital to keeping them on the board, since there's a decent chance you won't have been able to exhaust your opponent's removal.  Do you have the sort of deck that's going to come out fast and just needs to hold that advantage? If so, counterspells do a good job of preventing your opponent from landing that one card that really swings the board back in their favor.  Do you have instant-speed effects that you can use to gain card advantage or the like? If so, counterspells are much better for you than usual since, if your opponent doesn't cast anything you really feel the need to counter, you can just get ahead in cards by firing off said instant(s).  I love counter magic more than just about anything else in Magic. I'm that guy. But even if I'm one of the bigger proponents, I won't pretend that they're particularly good in standard limited formats where you're more than likely countering mid-to-low-impact spells rather than getting huge advantages like you do in Cube, or disrupting everything the opponent is trying to do as in constructed.   As a general rule, I'd say you should never pick them up over whatever you'd be using them to protect. If they're there to protect your big guys, another big guy is probably better so long as your curve isn't too lopsided. if they're there to protect that efficient ground game, you're probably better off increasing your chances of curving out by drafting another beater. But a good one-or-two-of drafted late can be a useful tool."
lrcast,3c4d7s,SinibusUSG,2,Sat Jul 4 23:44:47 2015 UTC,"I generally only main deck counters if I have some combination of early game clocks, tons of removal, big butt critters, and/or insane late game bombs.  In DTK drafts I have only been main decking them in grixis control."
lrcast,3c4d7s,SnowJoust,2,Sat Jul 4 18:21:56 2015 UTC,"I tend to mainboard counterspells when I'm short on hard removal (as in, most of my ""removal"" is just tap/bounce or damage-based), or when I have a handful of high quality creatures that serve as my win condition that I absolutely need to keep on the board."
lrcast,3c4d7s,Greyfeld,2,Sat Jul 4 22:59:10 2015 UTC,"Playing counterspells in sealed is also different than in draft. In sealed, decks are slower in general, with more bomb threats and more answer cards - counterspells are typically stronger than they are in draft, where decks are more focused. I'd always main deck 1 counterspell in a sealed deck, but may not in draft.  In draft, you need to think about where you're going to be playing your counterspell - where does it fit on your curve? Are you holding down the fort while trying to draw into game-ending bombs? Look for cheap counterspells that can interact with creatures ([[Mana Leak]], [[Essence Scatter]]). Are you a fast deck that wants to get an early advantage and prevent the opponent from stabilizing? Look for unconditional counterspells ([[Cancel]], [[Contradict]])."

lrcast,3c4d7s,MTGCardFetcher,0,Tue Jul 7 12:54:43 2015 UTC,"My general guideline (that's completely informal) is that if I'm in blue I'll usually play 2-mana counterspells (Essence Scatter, Negate), but only conditionally play 3-mana counterspells (Cancel, Dissolve). I don't play counterspells that cost more than that, unless they have some obvious, clearly powerful upside (Ojutai's Command)  You lose a lot by playing counterspells in limited because in limited you want to cast spells every turn. I like that 2 mana counterspells, though more condition, allow you, in the late game, to both cast spells and leave up counter mana.  I'm also more likely to run counterspells if I have other things to do with my mana if I pass the turn..  Likewise, I'm more likely to play counterspells in sealed than draft, because in sealed I'm more likely to have a deck where I'll be comfortable passing the turns later in the game without being as proactive if it means being able to get rid of my opponent's bombs."

lrcast,3c2wc8,ncs19,2,Sat Jul 4 06:39:30 2015 UTC,I put in the Efreets over the Scout and the Aspirant so that a curve going like Efreet --> Sandcrafter Mage would allow my two-drop to attack past their morph or two-drop.

I would also say that I feel that we are underevaluating the artifacts. The knife I believe should be a C+, the bonded construct is a nice tempo swing. It does not fulfill the 2/2 or better rule, but playing it on turn 1, and having a play on turn 2, and attacking for a lot on turn three, must be nice. Or maybe I am just feeling the hype in me. Also, angel's tomb, in an aggressive deck you should be able to activate it the three turns after you play it and attack for lots of lots of damage, if you play it turn three.

It is a good way to familiarize myself both with the cards and the community's early opinion on them.  I feel like Swift Reckoning is way too high. It is decent removal, but not second-most-powerful-card good and in my opinion not even a B but more like a C+. It can't remove blockers, lets you opponent untap with their crazy bombs, and doesn't hit vigilance creatures (which there seem to be a lot of).  The same goes with celestial flare. The casting cost is really hard to leave up in a normal two color deck, and you have to really manuever the board in order to get the right creature killed. Another C+ in my book.  I also feel like ravaging blaze is way too high. It is so inefficient, a much worse heat ray. Heat ray is always a good card to take, but it was never top tier removal, and neither is this. You have to pay 5 mana to kill a simple 2/3! Am I crazy or is this card just not that good?

Consecrated by Blood doesn't have that going for it, and even if you put it on a big creature there's a lot of flying blockers around giving your opponent time to find an answer which, if they do, will make up a lot of the value lost in chumping."

Vanilla test passing ones is interesting, especially because I've been thinking a lot about how to graphically display the vanilla test. I think that the vanilla test is changing too - a preliminary look at the set shows a fair amount of bears with upside and not many straight 2/2s.

Don't know if he'll still be as sweet of a card with modern day creatures, but nothing wrong with a 2/2 body that fixes your draws and replaces himself. On that trail of thought, there's a fair few ways for green to draw cards. I'd be too tempted to actually run Nissa' Revelation. Scry 5 is a lot of deck fixing, and you can draw a fair number of cards and gain a fair bit of life with it."
lrcast,3c04xy,oraymw,2,Fri Jul 3 17:52:10 2015 UTC,"Five cards:  Healing Hands - I wonder how playable this is when it has draw a card. It's basically Sphinx's Revelation, right? I know we had Reviving Dose a long time ago, and it wasn't fantastic, but that was also when formats were driven by card advantage and not by tempo. I would definitely like it more if it were instant, because then you could play it more easily alongside counterspells.  Sigiled Starfish - I love this card, and I noticed that it blocks a large number of the Renowned creatures. Being moved up from common to uncommon is kind of rough. It would have been nice to have common looters be a thing.  Macabre Waltz - I just love this card. I dunno if it'll be a lot worse than it was in Dissenion, but it is amazing how much different this kind of card is when it costs 2 instead of three. It can be used as a Raise Dead if you have at least two creatures in the yard, or it can get two creatures if you have an extra land in your hand. Who knows if this is good, but it's the kind of card that I like. Also, that art.  Skyraker Giant - I'm already a fan of Summit Prowler, and just giving it Reach is a pretty big deal. This is exactly the kind of solid card that tends to go underrated, but then performs really well in game.  Wild Instincts - Is this effect really too powerful for 2 or 3 mana? Sure it was one of the better commons in the set when it was at 2 mana, but it doesn't seem like it was unbalancing, just very good. This is probably now a little bit worse than Hunt the Weak, though it is possibly a little bit stronger on account of Renown. Who knows?  And one extra rare: Sword of the Animist - That's a card."

lrcast,3c04xy,BonSequitur,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:20:36 2015 UTC,"Unless you somehow draft monored, it works out because every other colour has common answers to large creatures; red brings really exceptional early-game removal to the table, which only black has.

lrcast,3c04xy,Rayvelion,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:46:09 2015 UTC,I think Shocks fall into that category when the format has Morphs (entire Khans block) since 2 damage to kill possibly some big bomb is insanely worth it in addition to hitting smaller normal creatures.  In this format? I'm not too sure.
lrcast,3c04xy,mowdownjoe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:10:09 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that it can upgrade to a bolt is pretty important. Yeah, your deck will need to be able to hit the Spell Mastery threshold, but a bolt still does a lot of work."

Collateral Damage also got a little better because drafting RB or UR with a minor sacrifice/exploit theme became a thing.  The uncommon FRF Dragons got minorly better because of the Dragon theme (though because of how light a touch it was, this didn't really change pick orders much).  Gurmag Angler got substantially better now that there was zero competition for delve slots. It went from a decent card to a pretty good one.

If you placed a Sword into Kami block, i suspect it would have been just as overpowering as Jitte was.  Warhammer was an uncommon which is why it was so feared at the time, and was from back before they realised how good equipment was and so was undercosted. i don't think there is a card in Modern at that rarity which is better.  And you know what, i still think i would take Sprout Swarm over it."
lrcast,3c00hj,SirChuffly,3,Fri Jul 3 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"Pack Rat, Bloodline Keeper, Olivia Voldaren, and Jace, Memory Adept come to mind from post-SOM. Elesh Norn and Angel of Serenity were insane but aren't quite up there due to their CMC."
lrcast,3c00hj,jadoth,3,Fri Jul 3 16:02:17 2015 UTC,"I know it's just echoing popular opinion, but it just is the Jitte. The card asks nothing of you except that you play creatures - and it's limited, you're going to play creatures. It has the power to take over the board, is colourless, and has a low setup cost. It's good while developing and good off the top. Good while ahead, good while behind (as long as you have a creature, I suppose!)   Just the nut.  Pack Rat and Grave Titan deserve honourable mentions, but I don't think anything else is really in the same league as those 3."

Karn might be the best pick in your cube, but in mine, with signets, Sol Ring is the consensus #1 pick.  Planeswalkers in general, though, are pretty solid picks. Sprout Swarm is certainly a powerful engine, but I think, personally, things like Sprout Swarm and Grave Titan get slight dings because it can take (relatively speaking) longer to get online than a card like Jitte. Certainly, once the engine is going, cards like that are close to unbeatable. But cards like Jitte or Pack Rat can come down turn 2 and are online and producing turn 3. There's something absurd about being able to untap on turn 3 and be an overwhelming favorite to win the game."
lrcast,3c00hj,SkepticalPrince,2,Sat Jul 4 17:51:37 2015 UTC,"Jitte. It's not only the best limited card in the Modern era, it's also the best limited card ever.

lrcast,3bwoc4,neagrosk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:03:37 2015 UTC,"ZJ's state justice system decided to punish him by putting him on a sex offender registry. This punishment comes with the understanding that that registry might be used to remove him from organizations. Because he is a sex offender, his crime was publicized to the MTG community. WotC then responded in the way that many organizations do when they have an public facing employee or representative that is on a sex offender registry, and they ""fired"" him.  If there's a problem here, it's with ZJ's country's judicial system."
lrcast,3bwoc4,snargaggle,4,Fri Jul 3 21:02:24 2015 UTC,"If that were the standard policy it wouldn't be as much of a concern. However, it is not currently a policy of Hasbro or WotC to disallow registered sex offenders to participate in sanctioned events. The reason ZJ was made an example of was primarily a PR move by Hasbro/WotC, which they are perfectly within their rights to do, but it is an inconsistent policy.  Effectively nothing would have happened had there not been media attention."

lrcast,3bwoc4,vrulg,3,Fri Jul 3 16:21:11 2015 UTC,"We don't think WotC makes decisions via coin flips. They follow decision rules, and we infer those decision rules via their policies and observing their prior decisions - the ""precedent"" set by banning Jesse indicates that our old understanding of the decision rules they're using (""we're not going to ban people for things that aren't related to Magic"") is incorrect. That's all."

lrcast,3bwoc4,BonSequitur,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:20:28 2015 UTC,"This argument actually makes me concerned about the entire subject. Banning ZJ doesn't do anything to make tournaments into a safer space. In fact, it will most likely backfire and make tournaments more dangerous by decreasing reports of sexual harassment.  It appears that this decision was made in the fear of potential legal issues.

lrcast,3bwoc4,snargaggle,0,Fri Jul 3 07:32:25 2015 UTC,"We don't really know what WotC's internal rationale is. For all we know, ZJ was caught doing something egregious at an event and the DCI has quietly handed down a ban without explaining why, as they do. People are making assumptions that this is about possible litigation or PR, and it could be that, too. I'm not saying WotC's handling of that was perfect, but I'm also not going to bemoan it happening, or accede to the narrative of Zack Jesse as a victim.  WotC needs to do more and better. It doesn't start by having no stance on Zach Jesse, and it's self-defeating to condemn actions against sexual predators because they may lead to underreporting of sexual misconduct."

I'd have more respect for him if he just owned up and said ""I raped someone, and understand that there are social consequences for that beyond my jail sentence.""

Arguably this reflects poorly on Reddit in the Duggar case, then, not the Jesse case.  Part of what makes this argument a shitshow is that Jesse is a very humanized rapist. He's a member of the community whose star was growing and was known and liked by many despite what he had done. He cannot be ""reduced"" to this one act as easily as many of his detractors would like for him to be. His defenders cannot be easily reduced to just shitlord rape apologists. And when people try to do this, they get pushback. The Duggar case is obviously different because the Duggars aren't part of a community that lots of Redditors are tied to and have various social connections with.  Look at what happens when someone who's liked gets accused of sexual assault in progressive communities - you see the same dynamic of people arguing that the person shouldn't be reduced to this one unfortunate action, that they've shown that they've moved on and repented, etc."
lrcast,3bwoc4,mtg_liebestod,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:55:57 2015 UTC,"I get that- that this is one of their own and that they're having to deal with their hero, in some cases, being a criminal. And dealing with that is hard. I'm not saying the people defending him are horrible, just that they should consider why they thoroughly defend him but not someone else who committed a similar crime. The Duggar case really isn't all that different, honestly, because both crimes were sexual and both families tried to deny what happened to some degree or paint the perpetrator as a victim as well. Both of them are wealthy, white, male, and high profile in their respective fields.   Look, I'm glad he's tried to do some good with his life, but until he is able to communicate that he's truly repentant and fully accepts that what he did wasn't a mistake, but was a horrible thing he did intentionally, I'm going to be okay with him being banned. His actions are unjustifiable and inexcusable, and he's done a lot of attempts at explaining them away because he was young, because of alcohol, because he thought it was consensual- whatever. I hate saying 'man up' but that's really what he needs to do here- face that his actions have consequences and affect the way that he is seen by people. Just because he finished his very short jail time doesn't mean the crime is erased. I think some of his defenders just don't realize how they're buying into some harmful ideas about rape and rape culture. Misguided, I guess, not horrible. Jesse himself? I really don't give a shit if he's defended, because he didn't give a shit about the girl he raped.   You make some very good points. For me, sexual assault isn't something I've experienced but it is still something I'm uncompromisingly against and it would be very difficult for me to find a person redeemable after they committed it.

Does Patrick's position in Magic given his criminal past make me a little hesitant? Yeah. But would I feel unsafe around him? Probably not.

He's not owning up to what he did and keeps calling it a 'mistake'. Rape is not the result of bad judgment, it's the result of having seriously fucked up ideas about your entitlement to another person's body and acting on them, which is something most people have enough decency not to do."
lrcast,3bwoc4,Misogynist-ist,4,Fri Jul 3 12:30:58 2015 UTC,His reformation goes far deeper than a single post he made in response to the fiasco started on twitter.   He's put more time and effort and action into it than just words.

lrcast,3bwoc4,Misogynist-ist,4,Fri Jul 3 13:05:52 2015 UTC,"So are you saying that rapists simply cannot be victimized by others, or what? You don't think that banning his MTGO account is perhaps excessive, even if they rationale is to protect others?"
lrcast,3bwoc4,mtg_liebestod,-2,Fri Jul 3 13:35:09 2015 UTC,"I have no sympathy for rapists, really, so trying to convince me otherwise is pretty fruitless.   Does being a rapist mean that you can never, ever be a victim of anything in your life going forward? Of course not. But here, he's facing social ostracization for doing something entirely deserving of social ostracization. If they're going to remove him from competitions, it wouldn't really make that much sense to let him participate online. He's gotten off really easy so far, in fact, and a lot of what he's written has stricken me as less than sincere. I would be extremely uncomfortable playing against someone that I knew was a sex offender."
lrcast,3bwoc4,Misogynist-ist,7,Fri Jul 3 13:39:54 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't be up to Wizards to determine who should be socially ostracized. It should be up to the individual stores and TOs where Jesse is trying to participate and the communities where he's already been participating. If they accept him and Wizards disapproves, then Wizards should butt out of it.  I'll note that the punitive, morally-scolding rationale you're outlining is of course not the one that Wizards is using anyways. If Wizards wants to outline a policy whereby they start banning undesirables from participation regardless of what their local communities and playgroups think, then they should say as much. They won't, of course."
lrcast,3bwoc4,mtg_liebestod,-5,Fri Jul 3 13:20:24 2015 UTC,"I wish they would take it further and crack down on the drug dealing, the stalking, and the overall boy's club aspect of the community. This would take a ton of time, money and effort. I'm not optimistic that this'll happen, so the crackdown will have to come from within the community.   And Wizards is aware of their image, so they can do what they want to ban people they feel don't uphold the standards of the community. And Jesse is free to keep playing if he wants, just not at officially sanctioned tournaments from what I understand."

I don't really think we can say ""oh, he paid his debt to society"" or make any claims about his supposed rehabilitation, not from his words, not from his history.  The idea that this guy is some sort of persecuted victim is really appalling, and the fact that his attempts at portraying himself as such have succeeded just goes to show how ingrained rape culture really is."

It's not necessarily fair, and it's not necessarily about punishment, but I'm not going to be the one to tell a woman ""by entering this tournament you knowingly agree that you might be paired against, sit next to, or have to interact with a convicted rapist."" Frankly, it's pretty amazing this guy isn't still in prison, and the fact that this even comes up is a testament to how privileged his background is.  Like, ""don't rape people"" is not a hard rule to stick to, seriously. Raping someone - and I don't want to bring up the details, but they are out there, and they are unpleasant - is not ""a mistake"", it's something that marks you as a profoundly untrustworthy individual; someone nobody would ever want to be alone with.  This is not some teenage fuck-up you walk away from with a slap on the wrist, and it's not like we can demand conclusive proof that this person is now rehabilitated and can be part of a safe and welcoming environment."
lrcast,3bwoc4,BonSequitur,12,Sat Jul 4 02:17:20 2015 UTC,"Do you think Zach is the only sex offender who plays magic? Sorry, but women can still be paired with sex offenders. I'm sure there are a lot of them at GPs or FNMs around the globe.  This banning didn't make anyone safer. All it did is lessen WotC's integrity by showing that internet witch hunts and bullying can drive their decision process.  If they actually cared that Zach was a sex offender, then they would make a policy about sex offenders."
lrcast,3bwoc4,dumac,-8,Sat Jul 4 02:50:38 2015 UTC,"Pointing out someone is a convicted rapist is ""bullying,"" now?  I don't think WoTC handled this ideally; I would have preferred a clear policy and a statement (and for all we know, that's forthcoming, they just set up the DCI ban before announcing anything because reasons). But I'm not going to complain about a rapist being asked to leave. This isn't a ""witch hunt"", in the sense that it's a search for someone to blame or lynch; Jesse is a rapist, this is a matter of public record. Pointing out this fact isn't ""bullying"", for chrissakes.  And yes, maybe all WotC cares about is the optics of the situation, but the optics do matter, and I do appreciate that at least on the high-profile case, WotC seems to be more concerned about how people feel about going to a Magic tournament than about people's handwringing and concerns about unfairly treating a rapist."

That's fine. I can do that for you.  I totally understand that some people will legitimately make other people feel uncomfortable. But I'm also fine with telling people they presumptively have to live with that, rather than figuring out who we need to exclude from our communities for the ironic goal of cultivating inclusivity.

I've been trying to get up my courage to branch out and start being a part of the community, but the knee-jerk reaction that's been going on in the MTG sub has scared me back into a hole again.   ETA: I could actually use some discussion/advice about why I find the community intimidating and how to change that. I love this game and want to get better, and that won't happen much until I get out there and start practicing it with regularity.  This seems like a much more subtly progressive space, and I'd also like to thank the LR crew for that. Two years ago I had NO interest in listening to Magic podcasts or watching videos of people's games, but LRCast has made it interesting enough that I actually watch now and then for myself, as well as over my husband's shoulder."

lrcast,3bwoc4,CelestialBeekeeper,3,Sat Jul 4 01:15:56 2015 UTC,"TLDR; I'm not great at Magic and am nervous that it will be attributed to my being female rather than my needing practice. I realize this is ridiculous. I need a push or invitation to get out there and see that it's not so bad as it is in my head.   Well, like 90% of the Reddit community. I've also tried going to FNM in my hometown and had a miserable experience where I didn't actually get to play despite hanging around for 2 hours waiting for a player 8. Heard some really sexist and vile stuff in the meantime. Also, and I know this is stupid, but I think being female matters more to me than it does to other people, at least when it comes to my own self-consciousness. I'm not very good, but I'm scared that I'll be a bad representative for women in Magic because of that. Will people think ""she needs more experience"" or ""see, women really do suck at Magic"" when I miss obvious plays? This has NEVER been an issue with my friends but I'm much more leery of strangers. And yeah, this is probably entirely in my head.   Now, my situation's a little different because I don't live in my native country anymore. That means any nervousness is compounded by my either having to speak a foreign language to play, or forcing my opponent to accommodate me by speaking my language.  And yeah, English is decently prevalent here, especially amongst young people, but still. Now, I do have an English-speaking friend that I could go to FNM with, but I've been a little hesitant. He's a lot better than me and a) I don't want to embarrass myself, and b) I don't want to seem like I'm trying to hone in on his turf or monopolize his time, as we already do a lot of stuff together, including Pauper and Commander and non-Magic board games.   When I was younger, I used to be one of the most active members of my local Pokemon League, became a certified trainer (the first female trainer at my league, actually), and taught others to play. I was never intimidated and made a ton of great friends that way. I like Magic even more than I ever liked Pokemon, but now everyone is grown up and I'm aware of things I never thought about as a kid. It's hard to stay out of your own head and those nebulous whispers in the aether as you said start to get to you after long enough."

When I first started playing Magic I would only ever go to FNM with my friends, and wouldn't have even considered going alone. Also, the more people you bring with you, the more likely it is that your pod will fire.  I'd say that if you have friends who enjoy Magic, there's no harm in taking them to FNM with you. If you're fine playing with friends, and anxious about playing with strangers, why not try doing both, and see how you feel?"

lrcast,3bwoc4,snargaggle,2,Fri Jul 3 06:39:32 2015 UTC,"The connection is easy to see -- both have made Wizards look bad in some capacity pretty recently.  But that connection is tethered together with dental floss, because one is a criminal and one wrote a disagreeable article.  I'm still of the opinion that Wizards did this to save face more than to create a safe environment, so I agree with the premise that Wizards policy here needs to be reworked.

lrcast,3bwoc4,bucs_and_squats,2,Fri Jul 3 13:34:23 2015 UTC,"It does seem that Wizards did this to save face. Banning ZJ didn't make the environment safer, and probably went a long way toward discouraging reporting in the community. I'd guess that they probably banned ZJ because they were worried about a potential law suit.  A potential law suit that they would probably win, mind you, but which might incur costs they didn't want to pay, so it was easier to ban him than to let him continue."
lrcast,3bwoc4,snargaggle,4,Fri Jul 3 17:24:12 2015 UTC,"Jim Davis' article made a lot of people (women in particular) upset. If Wizards wants to promote inclusivity, why keep people like him (or me) around?  No, I don't think Jim Davis is seriously going to get banned. But I think that someone who's more extreme than Jim Davis would be in serious trouble. For example, imagine a prominent Mens Rights Activist or white nationalist started to win Magic tournaments. Do I think this decision sets a precedent that Wizards would think about banning him? Absolutely.  Alternatively, I do genuinely believe that if Jesse were convicted of murder rather than rape he wouldn't have been banned. This action is guided by understanding the contours of the current moral panics that exist over sexual assault rather than a grounded notion of what will actually make players safe."
lrcast,3bwoc4,mtg_liebestod,-1,Fri Jul 3 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"This kind of slippery slope argument dramatically obfuscates the issue.  Several MRAs and neo-nazis have done well at Magic tournaments in the past, and continue to do well, and they aren't banned. They probably would be if it came to light that they had raped someone or if they had committed hate crimes.  Perhaps the strawman argument you are presenting is a tad childish."
lrcast,3bwoc4,snargaggle,2,Fri Jul 3 20:22:45 2015 UTC,"Several MRAs and neo-nazis have done well at Magic tournaments in the past, and continue to do well, and they aren't banned.   Like who? I'm genuinely not aware of anyone who is currently placing with this sort of background.  This isn't a strawman argument. It's a slippery slope argument. You might not believe that things will go this far, but that doesn't mean that it's unreasonable for others to disagree. My view on this comes from the fact that I think Wizards is afraid of negative publicity, and having a neo-nazi win would generate comparable negative publicity to having a rapist win (especially if we're talking about an active neo-nazi!) So I think Wizards would react comparably."
lrcast,3bwoc4,mtg_liebestod,-1,Fri Jul 3 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"I mean, I agree that they should ban neo-nazi's, but there are some who play at competitive levels and haven't been banned.  Do you have a problem with banning neo-nazis?  Is this really where you want to make your stand?"

lrcast,3bwoc4,mtg_liebestod,-1,Fri Jul 3 20:12:36 2015 UTC,"Wow.  Edit: I know a neo-nazi that top 8'ed a GP in the past 18 months. Unlike some people in the MTG community, I'm not going to publish this on reddit or on twitter, because I'm uncomfortable with witch hunts, but I did send a letter to WotC. Nothing happened.  There are a ton of pro MTG players who are MRAs, and who are quite vocal about their beliefs, and none of them have been banned. Many of them have even sexually harassed players and/or judges, but the DCI hasn't banned them.

lrcast,3bwsyv,Rnorman3,3,Thu Jul 2 21:50:55 2015 UTC,"I would take the Outcast for sure.  You only have 5 three drops, so you can stand to pick up another couple, and wardscale dragon is way expensive for an aggressive deck like this.  In this format the best way to win with RW is to just have a lower curve than everybody else.  And draft warflare."

I'd be tempted to give up the power of the outcast fit the better curve. It's a close pick though IMO.

lrcast,3c0ac7,Adjace-esque,5,Fri Jul 3 17:27:00 2015 UTC,"This might not be the right hobby for you...let's count the mental sins.  1) Insisting that you're making ""pretty sweet decks"" that somehow always have bombs and removal and curve. Even Pros have bad drafts sometimes. You can't always have all of these things. If you think all your decks are sweet, I guarantee they're not because you have a flawed idea of what ""sweet"" looks like.   2) EITHER exaggerating about how bad your draws were, or getting too worked up about a cosmically unlikely run of bad luck.   3) Continuing to jam drafts even though you were clearly upset about your run of bad luck, instead of doing something else to clear your head.   4) Making unfounded assumptions about your opponent's deck like he was running 14 lands. Trust me, he wasn't. Some of those cards in his hand that you were fretting about were bluffed lands OR he got really lucky.   5) Thinking that complaining about mana screw in the chat window is going to help.   6) The worst sin of all -- blaming ""the shuffler.""   You should probably take a break from the game, not because the game is rigged, but because you're not in a mindset that will yield success. If you want to succeed, I recommend not coming back until you accept that the shuffler is utterly, uncaringly random."

lrcast,3c0ac7,CelestialBeekeeper,3,Fri Jul 3 17:29:05 2015 UTC,"Getting bad draws for a stretch of time is as much a result of randomness as getting good draws for a stretch of time.  Look at any of the many people who stream or make MTGO videos, look at any of the people here who play a lot of MTGO, or even look at your opponents. Are they unable to play in most games because their draws are always terrible?  Variance doesn't mean that you must draw spells at some point. It means that you'll draw some spells most of the time. The fact that you got an unlikely draw twice in a row doesn't mean that the results aren't random. That's exactly what you'do expect to sometimes happen some of the time."
lrcast,3c0ac7,fkwillrice,2,Fri Jul 3 18:03:05 2015 UTC,"When it comes to poker, people who play for a living go through lots of variance swings. The highs can be really high and the lows can be really low. The stretches of these periods can last weeks or more, even if you're playing well. That's because you're playing a game entirely dependent on variance. In poker, nobody wants to hear a bad beats story. They're the sign of a new player, they're always the same, and they sound like your post.  Magic is no different. You're currently in a low stretch. That's fine. It happens. Wasting energy complaining about it isn't going to make you better, but what will would be examining what you did in those games. Was there really no way for you to win each one of them? Might be, might not be. If you stop focusing on luck you'll be able to take advantage of when the variance swings back in your favor much more."

lrcast,3bwlz5,5-s,2,Thu Jul 2 20:11:08 2015 UTC,"The problem with playing a deck like this in modern is that you really bank on getting two 5 mana enchantments in play, and if you don't, you basically can't win.  You can beat down with crypt ghasts, but that just isn't likely to get there in a format where people play tarmogoyfs.  Not to mention the fact that there are people who will kill you on turn 4 (Twin) or 3 (Podless/Anafenza combo) or even 2 (Amulet Bloom).  I think you would be better served packing more early disruption like thoughtsieze and inquisition of kozilek, and try to play a control game with an 'oops I win' combo.  That way you have a chance to stop the early combos, while having a way to go over the top of a deck like Jund that can't interact with your enchantments."
lrcast,3bwlz5,Carribi,2,Thu Jul 2 20:03:45 2015 UTC,"Your only disruption is removal spells for creatures, so you're going to just fold to any deck that doesn't depend on that, like Tron, Amulet, Ad Nauseum, Storm, etc. If you want to stick with this concept you should at least have discard in your 75, like Thoughtseize, Inquisition, or even something like Duress if budget is a concern.  Like others have said, I don't think building around this combo really has a chance of succeeding against the top decks in Modern, but adding hand disruption would at least give you a big boost."
lrcast,3bwlz5,Mullibok,2,Thu Jul 2 21:20:13 2015 UTC,"Dash Hopes is also really unplayable in this deck, as without the combo you have no chance of getting your opponent to zero life with the rest of your spells, so they can always just pay the 5. Those should be taken out ASAP."
lrcast,3bwlz5,Mullibok,2,Thu Jul 2 21:27:20 2015 UTC,I would encourage you to consider making this deck G/B. Green gives you all the ramp to power out 5 mana spells before turn five as well as access to commune with the gods to help dig for your enchantments while dumping cards to your bin. From the bin you could cast your syphon life. Having more chances to see that card allows you to need less copies of other drain spells. You also get to delve for cards like murderous cut now that you might be using fetch lands as well as commune filling your yard. Maybe consider adding something like tasigur or gurmag angler just to have beaters as a back up plan. Also the transmute card Brainspoil can tutor either half of your combo for just 3 mana and also could play as removal if all else fails.   This deck is weak to hard control decks and anyone packing enchantment hate so some match ups are going to be an uphill battle.

lrcast,3bvo7v,Greyfeld,0,Thu Jul 2 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's easy to imagine situations that lead to that. Here's what I think happens in situations like your example:   Pack 1, most of the way to your right, bombs in nonwhite colors are opened followed by other great cards. The players settle on those nonwhite colors, and pass some fairly good white cards because it's not a good pairing for what they've opened. Pack 1, close to your left, someone's opened some decent white, but then you started cutting it so they settled into a desirable 2nd color. But they're still open to white. Pack 2, the left player opens a good white card and has several passed to them. They start cutting your white, but you're a little less likely to noticebecause there are some great cards in a 2nd color for you. Or, if there's a lot of white in this round, you may not notice it's being cut. Pack 2, to the right, players are very discouraged from picking up white cards this pack because 2 people are cutting it. If they were thinking about white, they give up. Pack 3, to the right, one of the people who gave up on white opens Citadel Siege and gets passed an Elite Scaleguard. They move back into White. You're being cut from this direction. Pack 3, to the left, this player takes your 2nd picks in white, and your third picks filter through the right player. You're being cut twice.   Alternate scenario: sometimes the packs at the table are just mean to one color. It's possible to open several packs with only 2 mediocre cards in a certain color. In that round, no one wins in that color. Sometimes the other end happens too: one draft 3 of our pack 2s had more than 6 blue cards in them, it was strange enough we had to stop to verify someone didn't accidentally pass their stack of picks instead of a pack. This is rare, but most of ""signaling"" is based on the assumption that cards are more or less evenly distributed. When they aren't, the packs send strange signals.  And finally, yes, sometimes inexperienced drafters really ruin what signals you get. Last week, a player to my left was very inexperienced. I was pretty sure I was UW, with an Ojutai Interceptor and 2 Ojutai's Summons. Then, pack 2, that player sent me 2 Rakshasa Gravecaller. Suddenly I was very sad I'd taken Pacifism over Death Wind in pack 1, but such is life. Fate laughed at me even more by delivering me a foil Ojutai, Soul of Winter after I was firmly set in UB."

I picked the fetchland for my collection, and I think FRF got mad at me over that. I've seen Atarka 3 more times since then, but only once when I was actually in RG. In 8 games with that deck, I never even drew Atarka.  I've never opened a Citadel Siege. I've found 2 Palace Sieges, but only when I'm completely unable to use black. When I opened an Ugin, I was building a very low-curve UW deck that never survived long enough to resolve it. I've opened Scroll of the Masters more times than I can count. Want Living Lore? I can find it, I've opened it at least 3 times including every prerelease I've done. Want Silumgar, the Drifting Death?

Colossus is huge, threatens to get even huger, and can't be double-blocked. Winnower is like Pyrotechnics, it's a really easy 2-for-1. Even if you can't kill the creature you want because it's a 4/4, you can still kill a random 3/2 and be left with a 4/3 menace. How do they not get As? And Kytheon gets an A? I'd much rather have these cards than a 2/1 that dies to every red spell.  I'd also like to discuss 7-drops like Gideon's Phalanx. Obviously we don't know how Origins will play out, but how do strong 7-drops generally fare in your average limited format? We've seen Gideon's Phalanx as the 5WW instant that puts 4 2/2 knight tokens with vigilance and gives your creatures indestructible with spell mastery; and Alhammarret, the 5/5 flier for 5UU that says your opponents can't cast spells of your chosen name until Alhammarret leaves the battlefield.  Green ramps really well as far as we've seen so far so if you're UG or GW these could be pretty good. But if you're not, I feel like they might be dead cards more often than not."

lrcast,3bt1xw,forbiddenvoid,5,Wed Jul 1 22:42:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I like this-- you want to win in as few turns as possible to prevent the opponent from drawing into an answer. It's not possible for the opponent to have both flying and haste from zero cards in hand (unless the manifested card is either a surrak, which they can't flip, or that crappy red 1-drop megamorph), and it's unlikely that a manifest is flying (though this depends on what you've seen of their deck so far). You play the crappy 2 drop, swing for 10. if your opponent attacks, you block. If they do not attack, assuming they cast no creatures, you swing with all but regent, since they're projecting the intention to block on the ground, and will survive for an extra turn regardless. This also allows you to win the next turn if you draw into removal and they don't draw into another creature.   Not attacking with the regent the first turn gives the opponent at least two extra turns to draw anything. Since your opponent is in UR, burn is a possibility, and you don't want to give an opportunity to draw it.   That said, the read as to whether the manifest has flying or not really depends on what you have seen of their deck so far. At 3 life, they will almost certainly draw into a win eventually so you want to minimize the chance of that happening. That said, if you've seen a lot of flying creatures already (or if their deck is more blue than red), your line may be different."
lrcast,3bt1xw,FinalCactus,2,Thu Jul 2 00:58:10 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with the thinking. My thought was that a typical UR deck does have a high density of flyers. If you haven't seen much then your line is probably correct. I'm mostly thinking at this point about what you lose to.  Keep in mind that assuming they cast the manifest off of Write into Being, the opponent got to choose which card was manifested which increases the likelihood that the manifest is a flyer."
lrcast,3bt1xw,forbiddenvoid,2,Thu Jul 2 02:49:12 2015 UTC,"oh yeah, I suppose we can assume it was write into being. Good point. That definitely makes it a bit closer."

lrcast,3bt1xw,steve032,3,Thu Jul 2 03:34:01 2015 UTC,No way am I leaving back only one blocker here against RB - pretty much any dash creature kills you. I'm leaving back the regent and the 2 drop.
lrcast,3bt1xw,cferejohn,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:25:17 2015 UTC,"just wanted to clarify that the opp is on U/R not RB, leaving only one color of dash creatures. Still dead to a heel cutter but there't not near as many blue effects to take out a blocker as there would be in black"
lrcast,3bt1xw,fike-the-bear,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:52:21 2015 UTC,"blink. Derp.   Close then, though now of course you have to fade him having manifested a flyer if you swing (and since it was Write Into Being there's a reasonable chance that it's some creature)."
lrcast,3bt1xw,cferejohn,3,Thu Jul 2 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"So what happened in actuality? I realize then it would be ROTTy, but curiosity gets the best of me."
lrcast,3bt1xw,tjtillman,2,Thu Jul 2 16:39:34 2015 UTC,"Attacking with both represents a 3 turn clock (22 -> 12 -> 2 -> dead) while attacking with just the marsh hulk is a 5 turn clock.   If it's a manifest (and not a morph) attacking with both is probably correct. You only lose to a flyer, if that was the manifest (which means it both  has to be a creature AND a flyer). Keep in mind that it has to be a flyer and have 3 power. This represents a total of 11 creatures (including dragon whisperer), of which 4 are rares, 1 is lightning shrieker. The question is, how likely is he to have one of these cards manifested? The answer is probably very low. Assuming your 2 drop has 2 power, you also represent a 2 turn clock.   Attacking with both puts him on the back foot. He needs to draw something, and his manifest has to be able to eat the 2 drop. It feels like the better line of play."
lrcast,3bt1xw,chimpfunkz,2,Thu Jul 2 20:00:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the responses so far guys. To answer a few questions, the only flyer my opponent played until that turn was an ojutai interceptor and he had primarily red creatures.  Unfortunately I did not check to see if he bottomed or kept the other card when he cast write into being. That was a huge misplay on my part and considering how split the responses I'm getting that might be the key piece of information here."
lrcast,3bt1xw,Reavana,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:07:50 2015 UTC,"Question,  did you mean to say manifest or morph.  This makes a small difference, but I don't know how they manifested a card in UR without it having counters or flying.  A morph is much more likely to have an ability when flipped, while an actual manifest does have a chance to ""just"" be a 2/2."

lrcast,3bt1xw,Reavana,2,Thu Jul 2 01:18:37 2015 UTC,"Ahh yes.  Forgot that one.   However in that case did they bottom the card or not.  If they bottomed it, then I would attack into it, but if they left it on top I'm more likely to hold back in case they found something."
lrcast,3bt1xw,Greyfeld,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:20:31 2015 UTC,"If you swing in with both your big creatures, you die to a flip and removal.  Attacking with just the marsh hulk grants you a slower clock, but UR has too many ways to remove, tap, or otherwise get around your creatures for me to feel comfortable with going all-out with an unknown quantity on the board."
lrcast,3bt1xw,pahamack,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:02:20 2015 UTC,"2 turn clock vs 5 turn clock. I'm gonna go for it and attack with both. If he doesn't draw anything good, and assuming the manifest is just a land, he's on chump mode next turn."
lrcast,3bt1xw,DollarBizz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:32:43 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting one and thank you for sharing it.  I feel like this is really close.  I'm leaning towards swinging in with only the marsh hulk here.  Yes we are giving him more draw steps to grab a 3 damage burn spell, but we are also closing the door to a bunch of other outs our opponent could have otherwise.    If we choose to swing in with both creatures, leaving back our 2 drop: You have to figure out how often the manifest is a creature.  They did have selection so it will be more often, but im not sure how often depending on how many creatures they are running.  If we feel like it is a 3 power creature some amount of the time and we attack in with both the marshulk and the flyer, we lose to the opponent top decking any bounce spell, any tap spell, any removal. They straight win on the spot by flipping up a flyer, playing a threaten effect, or slamming 1 of a good amount of the red dash creatures.  Considering the manifest being a blank, there are still outs we are giving our opponent, things like Cunning Strike and heelcutter.  We are losing to some amount of top decked cards no matter what we do, but I like rolling the dice there this turn, rather than giving the opponent more immediate outs. If we don't die next turn, we reassess.  Maybe attack more aggressively?"

I'm sure it's not natural nor easy, it's clearly something Marshall's working on, perhaps with LSV's help because I noticed that LSV does this more frequently. That's a great thing.   We're all used to using ""he"" as a default pronoun...I'm not that old, and even I was taught in high school that when speaking about a hypothetical person of ambiguous gender, you should use ""he."" I don't know if that's still considered proper grammar but either way, I think alternating pronouns is a great idea considering the gender issues in the history of this game."

I don't know what will be, but it doesn't really matter: most of us aren't writing high school essays anymore and can use whatever we please.  Personally, I end up saying ""that player"" quite often when I'm talking. That's probably too long and unwieldy, but it's what I do."

I think that I'm the second person to listen to this episode this week and feel the need to post this, though, suggests that this does mean something real to people, and is important.   Absolutely, we need a female commentator1 (maybe this is something Marshall could work on next, considering his position), it would be great if articles like Jim Davis' stopped coming out, and we had something closer to 50/50 tournament attendance. However, the male default pronoun is a pretty big deal outside of just Magic as well, and Marshall subtly using his platform to undermine this very ingrained piece of male-dominated culture wasn't an accident.   I understand the argument of not patting people on the back for doing the bare minimum, but I do think Marshall made a conscious decision to be a better role model, and we should encourage others to do the same.     Although really, that could be a tough sell for the commentator herself-- have you seen the kind of vitriol female commentators in StarCraft or League get? It would have to be someone pretty brave. I don't say this to let anyone off the hook for it not having happened, but to underscore the size of step this would be."

lrcast,3bq50m,diabloblanco,19,Wed Jul 1 19:50:51 2015 UTC,"Even if you would never draft MM2, you still learn something from the crack-a-packs because they don't just say ""this card has the highest rank in the pick order"" but explain many aspects and evaluate each card. After months of DTK, it would be just boring to discuss another ""Flatten is the pick, after that it's between Stampeding Elk Herd and Sprinting Warbrute"" pack each week, so I welcome premium sets for this."
lrcast,3bq50m,ayumim,2,Wed Jul 1 07:06:27 2015 UTC,"I always thought a way to handle this would be reframing the discussion a bit. As you say, we all know flatten is a first pick, the elkherd and the brute are great.  Let's just say they are cracking pack two, and Marshall says ""I stayed mono white the whole first pack, but ended up with only one [[enduring victory]] and maybe one or two off-color removal. What I'm hoping for here is to either fill out my removal in white with a [[pacifism]], and look for something that helps me decide what second color to move into. Now we know black or red have the best removal in the format, but green or blue are allies...""    Meanwhile LSV says ""I didn't want to, but I drafted Blue Black again, I got some good removal, but only have 2 one and two drops.""   It would take a few seconds of an intro, and the questions about the cards would be relevant for an entirely different part of the game. Is Marshall gonna grab a [[twin bolt]] or an [[epic confrontation]]? What if there's an [[Artful Maneuver]] to stay white and add combat tricks as a ""faux-placement"" for removal? Will LSV snatch a [[Qarsi Sadist]] in the pack where a [[Sidisi's Faithful]] and a [[shambling Goblin]] might wheel? Is having another great [[ojutai interceptor]] worth risking not having a turn one or two play? Is this true for black, where [[sultai emmisary]] is in FRF, but not true in green where you get only an [[ainok guide]] two drop?  It would even let them start with the Rare (come on, we all do), and address if that's a bomb you snap, or something they have to discuss. Is LSV gonna grab a [[dromoka]] and start prioritizing fixing, or stay disciplined for the [[flatten]]? the [[ruthless death fang]]? The [[gurmag drowner]]? What about a [[Sunscorch Regent]]?  I also think ""what'll wheel"" would be fun. Do the first eight ""boring"" picks, and give us a better idea what and why to choose from the last half.   We crack three packs! Why are we always opening the first?  I agree: a lot of the time you're not choosing the best two cards, we know the best two cards. I'd like more discussion on the follow up :)"

lrcast,3bq50m,TheWrexial,3,Wed Jul 1 12:16:58 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind here is that advice is more sought-after in premium formats.  Regular formats are available enough that an avid drafter can get a good feel for the format within a few weeks of the format's debut.  They're affordable and easier to find, meaning that trainwrecking one and learning about the format isn't a terrible experience.  Premium formats are, by nature, more expensive, so most people will play them less and have more at stake when they do.  That means that people are both less experienced and feel worse if they botch the draft than they would for a normal environment.  In that scenario, information from outside sources is crucial, especially when it comes to archetype evaluation.  For example, BW Spirits was initially hailed as the deck of the format.  A few weeks later, LR put it at the middle of the power curve, with the removal-light WG tokens deck as the winner.  People who only get to draft MM2 a few times would likely not have access to that information, and it being available lets them perform better on the few drafts that they get to play."

Take the premium removal over the normal rare?  Take a strong archetypal card because its super strong if open vs just staying open.  Also, being fairly new to magic, I like the variety in crack-a-packs because it introduces me to cards I've never seen before.  Variety is good.

I personally don't get much out of MM2 crack a packs. I was planning on maybe one MM2 draft, but the money didn't materialize so the single booster I got from a Fantasy Crate is likely the only MM2 cards I'll ever own. There is some nonzero strategic benefit I get from hearing how these cards compare, but also a lot of discussion is about whether this or that card is a reason to go into Affinity or Spirits and I doubt that's going to present itself in standard limited anytime soon.  On the other hand, I'm not sure how interesting continued DTK crack a packs would have been. It felt like the format settled down really fast, and that people were really eager to move on to MM2. I'm not sure if there were some surprises that would've been revealed had the focus been on DTK, but I get the feeling LSV and Marshall are playing a lot more MM2 than DTK lately and if that's the case, their advice on DTK is a little less relevant than otherwise.  Overall it feels like LRCast coverage of DTK was fairly weak compared to previous sets. After the set reviews, we got 2 or 3 shows that were almost exclusively focused on UB Exploit. My memory may be failing me, but I feel like between GP Vegas and MM2 and a handful of other community things we never got very deep discussions of the other archetypes until the bulk of experienced players had moved on. MM2 didn't help, it provided a very big distraction when the ""sunset"" of DTK interest was approaching. I don't know if this is something LRCast should/could address, as I get the feeling DTK hasn't been viewed as a particularly deep set."
lrcast,3bq50m,Carribi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"I think part of this issue comes down to timing on set releases.  It felt like DTK was rushed on the heels of FRF to give MM15 more time in the spotlight.  I think Wizards wanted to give MM15 its own slot in the year so that people don't feel split between two draft formats, as that would be bad for Wizards financially.  At that point, DTK just got the short end of the stick as far as attention goes.  It also doesn't help that DTK kind of felt like a step down from KTK draft.  Regardless, I wouldn't want to blame the content producers for not giving DTK its all, because Wizards didn't really give DTK much of a window to shine in."
lrcast,3bq50m,Slypenslyde,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:54:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is why I say it's kind of a bad example, I'm not sure what a season with only DTK would've looked like.

While DDF doesn't bore me, the pick often seems simpler.   Your perspective makes total sense though.

I know it sounds like ""name dropping"" to you, but LSV actually knows these people ... they're friends (or at least people he has had many interactions with over a long period of time).

lrcast,3bn70v,billiam-was-taken,3,Wed Jul 1 06:11:41 2015 UTC,"In short, yes.  When he started on LR, he made an off-the-cuff comment about never listening to the show or to podcasts. (I'm pretty sure it was to the show, it may be to podcast in general.) It was pretty evident. He seems more interested in regaling the audience with his jokes and his stories with pros than getting his hands dirty and actually teaching players how to think about the set and maximize their play.  (There's also a serious conflict of interest currently on LR with Channel Fireball being the sponsor and LSV being a co-host. LSV is a VP of Channel Fireball. Channel Fireball gets a lot of their cache  from being magic pros and doing well at GPs and on the pro tour. LSV has always missed the show right after the set to prep for a GP. This calls into question how much he's being honest with the listener on his interpretation of his cards during the set review. Also, him missing the first show after the set review is exceptionally lame. That's the most critical time to figure out a set and he's just gone and that sucks. That's when I'm most interested in getting better at the set and it highlights the conflict of interest that is fundamental in the show.)  I think Brian Wong quit LR because burned himself out from working his butt off on the show every week and brought everything he could to the listener. He doesn't have the pro tour resume that LSV does nor the fame, but every week I felt like he brought everything he knew about the format to bear and he was an exceptional teacher. I feel like LSV thinks of this as ""something else to do"" and in other formats his stories and jokes are welcomed and encouraged. If the purpose of LR is to get people better at limited Magic, then he should focus less on telling us about all the pros he ran into and more about what heuristics we can use to understand a card or a format better."
lrcast,3bn70v,DeftMunky,2,Wed Jul 1 06:36:37 2015 UTC,"My main complaint about LSV's first bunch of episodes is that his contributions tended to be vague and unfocused, which could be to winging it and not preparing enough. Brian tended to have specific examples planned and a section-by-section plan to the show.  Recently, though, LSV's been better. These bullet point shows might get a little old, but at least having a pre-made list of things to talk about has made them more organized and has made LSV and Marshall pre-think about what they want to say. It could get even better, though.  If there's one thing I'd ask for, it's a lot more specific pieces of advice. They help explain the larger scale concepts."

The constant investment they require is problematic, someone else compared it to [[Qal Sisma Behemoth]] and that is pretty accurate I think.  Huge upside, but kind of a pain to constantly pay for and not get ahead at all on board.  That being said, this one can pretty commonly be a 6/1 with haste, which is pretty nice.

It's not that great in any other context really.   Genju of the Fields was the most powerful of all of them because you could stack the gain life clauses to get 6+ life a turn.
lrcast,3bosn9,Rad_Elemental_Blast,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:13:48 2015 UTC,"Outside of block synergies I don't know about, I'm thinking this card ranges between very good and bomb.  Unlike normal auras, you don't run the risk of getting two for oned in response to playing this card. That means this card is an endless stream of virtual card advantage by turning mountains into creatures.  The best thing about this I think though is the threat of activation. Leave two mana up and now your opponent can no longer profitably attack without trading virtually anything for your land.  I think if we use quadrant theory this thing is a beast everywhere. Early you could hit in for 6 unopposed, Parity you trade every land for a 6/1 attacker, and if you are losing you can throw this is front of your opponents attackers every turn."
lrcast,3bosn9,supyonamesjosh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:22:12 2015 UTC,"Genju are harder to evaluate because they have a tempo associated with them, as well as then returning to your hand if the land dies.  The best way to think of it it's to compare it to another very similar creature, behmoth of wal sima (I think?), the 5/5 from dtk that requires you to pay 2 to attack out block. Genju is basically like that, retiring a tax to attack or block (the tax being 3) but also returns to your hand.  Having never dragged kamigawa and not knowing what the format id like, I'd put it as a middle pick in most formats. It is good it you flood out, bad if you are screwed, and ok in a normal curve out.   By quadrant theory, it's bad or not great on development (since using it hampers your development), ok at parity (really swing here, since it prevents you from playing more creatures, but also isn't the best at letting you attack since anything trades with it) good when ahead, but if argue bad when behind since it trades 1 got 1 with their most middle creature (since you wouldn't attack onto it with your best creatures).   Probably the best analogue would be the zendikons for zendikar, but that was Weird draft format sure to how fast it was."
lrcast,3bosn9,chimpfunkz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:18:10 2015 UTC,"it's playable in a red aggro deck. it gives you the ability to dome the opponent for 6 out of nowhere if you can clear the way with a cheap burn spell, and, the lategame of red aggro decks is frequently you chump blocking while hoping to topdeck a burn spell.

You can use it as a way to add pressure once you run out of gas and can afford to start pitching lands.  It's also a card you wouldn't want to play at any other point in the game, and even in the late game can'you do much to help you catch up if you've fallen too far behind.  Ithe looks like the kind of card that I'd pick up occasionally while drafting, but would never actually make the cut, assuming there are any consistent finishers in red in the format."

lrcast,3bp0zn,sylverfyre,9,Wed Jul 1 00:52:09 2015 UTC,"That's a thing that can happen, but it doesn't mean it was an incorrect keep.  You were seeing 4 cards before needing to see a land and 5 before you really need a forest (and you can probably miss for a turn, so let's say turn 5 seeing 6 cards, before you're really in trouble, since you probably have found a castable spell if you haven't found lands.)  I assume you're running more forests than mountains so if you had 9 forests in your deck:  25*24*23*22*21*20 ------------------ 33*32*31*30*29*28   = ~15% to fail to find a forest by turn 5.

lrcast,3bp0zn,pahamack,4,Wed Jul 1 04:50:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe I am in the minority here, but I wouldnt keep that. I think this is an extremely greedy keep. Your first board affecting plays require double green and cost 4 mana. That puts a LOT of pressure on your draw steps. If you draw mana so that you can hit your 4 drops, then you arent drawing any low cost creatures to play. If you draw those lands, then you arent making any play until turn 4 (not good). Furthermore, I do not think you want to be using Tormenting Voice to fix your initial draw, you want to use it later in the game when you are losing steam and need to draw your finishers.    A general rule of thumb that I have been leaning towards has been to mulligan back your first hand if you dont have both colors, something to put on the board in turn 2 or turn 3 (preferably both), and the mana to do so.  This is a really tough question to provide a useful answer to without knowing more about both decks."

I must say I was also pretty surprised with the response of ""snap keep"".  I felt like it was way closer than that with the 2 double green spells.  I did end up keeping but didn't draw another green the whole game, even with the voice. I think in the future I would lean towards keeping again, but I thought it was quite close, so I thought I'd ask the masses.  Thank you all for your responses!"
lrcast,3bp0zn,Foolero,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:12:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, you might lose because you don't hit double green or at least a 3 drop, but when you mull you're seeing 6 cards. tormenting voice lets you already see 2 more cards, and you're already guaranteed the two lands in your opening hand. Plus, if you have at least 9 green sources Im pretty sure you have a good chance of seeing double green by turn 4 (you're going to be seeing 5 cards before you get to turn 4).  I think mulling is a bigger gamble here. it also helps that your turn 4 plays are both pretty good blockers."

lrcast,3bp0zn,rightseid,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:07:51 2015 UTC,Depends on your deck and his deck.   I don't see a reason why not to keep it though as you have turn 2 tormenting voice and likely a turn 3 play given the fact that you've drawn 4 cards by then.

If that were the case I would still see Pacifism as the strongest card and probably take it. If someone took Mirror Mockery and tried to go hard on the UB exploit I wouldn't fault them for it. Pacifism is already a bit weaker in this set than most and Mirror Mockery has potential to be quite a powerful card.   That being said I'd rather start out with the Pacifism and go from there. Echoes, Misthoof Kirin and Sunstriker are fine white cards but your neighbor probably wouldn't see any as a strong signal anyway, and if you cut white the rest of the pack you'll be fine.  Additionally, Pacifism is somewhat splashable if you are severely lacking in removal. Mockery is really only a strong card in the UB deck."

lrcast,3boei3,Kiwibird8,3,Thu Jul 2 05:07:18 2015 UTC,"Sarkhan's Rage is correct. Atarka's Pummeler is second and Sabertooth Outrider third, but in my opinion there's a decent step down with each one.  Don't worry that you're passing 2 strong red cards, and the guy on your left will pick them up. If red is open you'll be cutting him 2/3 packs, if it's not then let him scrap for it... I really wouldn't worry."
lrcast,3boei3,SirChuffly,3,Tue Jun 30 22:59:51 2015 UTC,Rage.  Most powerful.  You'll play in any red deck and its not unheard of to splash for it.  Also you're not crushed if you have to abandon when red's not open. (never is)
lrcast,3boei3,DollarBizz,3,Tue Jun 30 23:27:33 2015 UTC,"OP, I don't care if the pack has 12 red cards, Mirror Mockery, and Echoes of the Kin Tree. Never take those P1P1 over Sarkhan's Rage if your goal is to win the draft. Worrying about the colors you're passing is just a tiebreaking concern, not cause to pick a much worse card over a better one."

It's cheaper than Rage, performs the same creature removal (though conditionally), life gain and could protect a creature versus removal.  Also, considering what is in the pack, taking Glee cuts black, for what it's worth.   It's clearly less flexible than the Rage and probably a weaker card, but personally, I've had good luck with B/x in DDF draft. So that's where I'd want to be."

lrcast,3bnud0,Aethien,4,Tue Jun 30 18:40:58 2015 UTC,"When things start to get muddled like this I generally default to simplifying my decisions and trying to pick the best card in the pack.  When no one is following archetypes, I find it best to concentrate on the basics:  getting solid value creatures and removal and having a plan for your deck (aggro, midrange, controlish).  I'll try to consider what I've already picked and stay close to color, but it's not always possible.    What this means is that in trainwrecks like the one you described, I'd probably end up playing 3 colors, maybe even 4 if I was able to grab mana fixing.  It's harder to win a draft when you stray out of established, powerful archetypes, but the extra flexibility of your deck coupled with the confusion it causes your opponent can lead to wins."
lrcast,3bnud0,MrWienerDawg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:06:28 2015 UTC,"As you noticed, only 1 of the decks you saw was cohesive. It was probably just a weird draft. That's the great thing about draft, the power level is pretty flat, if you end up with a terrible deck and are drafting skillfully, it's a pretty good sign that the overall pool was probably weak.  Looks like you tried to read the signals and move into the open archetype, and it just didn't work out.  I'm by no means an expert, but i'd say all you can do is try to build the best deck you can, and try and play well. Don't be defeatist about it and you can often salvage some kind of result.  I guess the only added piece of advice someone could give is to at least make a deck that has some kind of plan."

My quick thoughts on your points in conclusion:  1), 3), 4) and 5): These don't suprise me, but I appreciate that the work you put in, both in crunching the data and in formulating the points.  2): That's suprising to me as well, I expected the increase in CMC to be higher. I guess my ""intution"" was skewed by the fact that the only old removal spells I see are the ones played in non-rotating formats, which is limited to the most mana-efficient for obvious reasons.  6): I've never really thought about this. But after I read it I can't help but think that I should have noticed it. If someone proposed a ""kill a creature, draw a card"" spell today I'd guess it would have either a very prohibitive cost or some insane restriction. In contrast Flametongue Kavu seems like a ""natural"" fit for the game at the time (albeit extremely good).  Out of curiosity. Did you only assign whole numbers to cards, or did you give some cards, say, 1.5 restriction?"

lrcast,3bj6ly,IzDaisho,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:43:39 2015 UTC,"I'm just not sure how much this will help. Mulligans were already probably the most difficult decision in the game. Adding another element to them will just result in more player error in terms of mulligan. In turn, this could result to even more non-games.  Players of varying experience levels will keep riskier hands hoping to draw the one card that they need to make the hand work off the scry. They will also likely be significantly more aggressive with mulliganning their first 7. While they should be, (mulliganing from 7 to 6 is now a smaller gap than it was) I suspect that a significant margin of players will do this too often resulting in the need to mulligan further.  I am excited to see how this goes but am really not sure this is all (or even mostly) upside."
lrcast,3bj6ly,zvazda,11,Mon Jun 29 17:58:52 2015 UTC,"But your argument is that mulliganing will now rely more on skill and less on luck... which is better, right?"
lrcast,3bj6ly,Orlick_Trellis,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:40:58 2015 UTC,"Well... it depends on your point of view.  If you are in the bottom 50% of players and all you care about is your MWP this is going to be worse for you. Of course, if you care about getting better at magic, then this is still better for you because you should get a higher MWP over time (assuming you keep getting better).  I DO think there is a non-zero chance that this could be worse for the game. If less people get hooked on the game because they luck into less wins, it could end up being bad.  Of course, I'm just Devil's Advocating, I don't think this is likely, and I would recommend that before they activate this change they test it somewhere. Maybe like a pro tour or something.  :D"

lrcast,3bj6ly,Carribi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:38:43 2015 UTC,"I talked about this at length last night with my bf. He thinks that the new rules will be too complicated for new/casual players and they'll have to know what scry is. I, however, think that they will have incentive to learn and use the new rule because it will be better for them overall. These players are often the ones who don't mulligan appropriately; they have a tendency to keep bad hands and refuse to mull below 6, in my experience. These traits mean that they're more likely to play ""do nothing"" games than better players. Also, since scry is now an evergreen mechanic, I think that will help them understand it better, since it will be appearing throughout sets.  I believe the degree of success in implementation will hinge on how WotC chooses to educate the player base. If it's not thorough, I foresee uncomfortable moments at the start of matches when kitchen table players attend a sanctioned event but haven't heard of the rule."

Personally, I like that fact that this is going to reduce variance at the outset of a game, even if only by a little.  The first few turns are so formative of a game that trying to put players on even footing is worth the risks in my mind."

So mull from 7 to 6-scry-1 to 6, to 5-scry-1, etc.  I wonder if they were trying this but decided it was a little too complicated to explain and/or too little of a penalty for mulliganing."
lrcast,3bj6ly,drjjn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:23:17 2015 UTC,The problem is that the difference between 6 scry 1 and 6 is so small.
lrcast,3bj6ly,THECrew42,2,Mon Jun 29 23:04:40 2015 UTC,"A mull to 6 is definitely not as large a penalty with this rule in place, but how large a penalty will be wholly dependent on the deck makeup. Thinking it over feels almost like a quadrant theory examination.   For the must-mull hands such as 0-lands or 7-lands, this represents a very big increase in the odds that your mull to 6 will still be a good opener. This is great for those games, but low impact on overall mulligan strategy because there's no discussion over keeping these hands. For the terrible hands that sometimes tempt people, like 1-landers with all 1 drops, mulling is now an even better choice. Pros will gain some edge from understanding exactly where this line is, novices will probably throw away some hands that should have been kept. Lots of discussion will happen about these hands. In the middle, you'll still have a conundrum. These are the hands that you're not very certain any hand of 6 will be better, but you don't want to keep them. You really have to know your deck to understand the right decision with these. For good hands, you shouldn't mull at all so this has no effect. There's going to be some people that superstitiously believe 6+scry is better than 7. They've probably got a lot of other bad habits internalized, and we can't protect them from themselves.   So overall, it seems good for players above some intermediate skill level that already make fairly good decisions about mulligans. For casual players or players who don't think much, it might be a bit of a stumbling block, but I feel like mulligan strategy as-is already presents a huge problem for these players."
lrcast,3bj6ly,Artemis201,4,Mon Jun 29 20:35:31 2015 UTC,"As mentioned on the main mtg subreddit there are little non-obvious advantages to be had. For example the scry can help you better set up a turn 1 flip on delver.  Great to see that they openly try to tackle the mulligan rule and admit that it is not a perfect system. One of the main concerns I see is explaining it to a newer player. Before you just said: ""if you don't like your first 7 cards you can shuffel them back in and draw 6 again""-. and that was it."

He's fun to watch, explains things fairly well, and is obviously a very talented drafter. He sometimes goes for crazy or interesting decks to appease his viewers rather than sticking to the spike mentality, but it's still worth a watch. He also has a youtube channel which is a little more orderly, but has less frequent posts.  Noah Sandler aka modogrinder1 on twitch. He's a bit dry, but really knows his stuff and takes a lot of time to explain his decisions and thought processes.   I think your best results will be dabbling with most or all of these, to find your favourites and/or get a decent mix of viewpoints!"

SGDoc is my favorite, but he's usually on late nights EST, so that doesn't work great for some. His music is the best on twitch for magic. some call it dad rock, i just call it awesome and very fitting, non distracting.  Numot is great and also has great music. He always draws a huge crowd though so it's harder to interact/ask questions about plays etc.  Neal.

There's a whole lot of information to absorb when you are first looking at a sealed pool, especially if you are unfamiliar with the set and new to magic in general.  The more he knows about the set going in, the easier it will be to evaluate what he has.  Don't waste any time once deckbuilding begins.  Sort the cards rapidly.  I like to go with color and casting cost right off the bat and not worry about separating into playables first, but ymmv.  Whatever sorting method you choose, be quick about it.  Listen to the set review show. Play your removal. Play your bombs."

lrcast,3bjcds,_kEND,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:08:36 2015 UTC,"Most of your beginner errors don't actually come from missing super technical lines of play (ie moving counters from one creature to another in between first strike/normal combat damage, or shrinking your creature in response to Valorous Stance). I'd say the biggest gap in improvement can be from evaluating cards and having a great deckbuilding process.  It means a lot to know the format before it even begins - there's a reason why the best limited players try to identify the colors with the best removal/bombs/commons/uncommons. Nothing can help more than actually looking at all the of cards in the new set and seeing how they stack up against each other."
lrcast,3bjcds,Vyraal1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:34:30 2015 UTC,"go over the archetypes. remind him 17 lands, 23 spells. stay in 2 colors, even if he has a cool planeswalker in a third color. make sure he understands what a good curve looks like. when in doubt, make a solid, low curve, aggro deck. study the spoilers and listen to/read the set reviews.   maybe make some fake packs out of old cards and practice building decks, or if you wanna get really serious, print out the spoilers, sleeve them with lands behind the paper, and practice with the proxies."
lrcast,3bjcds,Artemis201,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:27:32 2015 UTC,"Pre-release is mostly like any other sealed, so the basic sealed strategies are important.  When building a deck, sort by color, then split each color into good and bad cards.  Sealed is driven by bombs/removal, make deck choice base on these plus a reasonable amount of on-color playables.  So far there's no fixing spoiled for origins, so stay with two colors (obviously if there's more than the rare painlands still being spoiled this could change).    Build out a couple decks on curve, and ask for some help from other people at the shop.  Pre-release usually gives closer to 45 minutes for building, and a lot of people will be done in 20, I know most people love to help new people.  Play the first round, and then ask your opponent or whoever to have a look at your deck and sideboard.  It's not unusual to change the deck completely or partially in between rounds, this is always OK in non-competitive events (like fnm and pre-release), and since this is the first time playing with these cards most people will be trying out new cards and configurations throughout the day to see what works and what doesn't.  Most of all, it's pre-release, I'll literally show newer opponent my cards as we play so they can get the hang of it all.  Have fun with it, tell him to  just introduce himself and make it a social event not competitive.  There's tons of new people at pre-release, everyone asks a bunch of questions, and it's generally really relaxed.  TBH, reading the card reviews that matter most (commons/uncommons) can be dull as dirt, and the rares are fun but you'll never see most of them.  It's fun to go over the set reviews, but I wouldn't worry too much about watching 6 hours of video.  At first keep it simple, just play the best cards in the pool, don't overemphasize tricks and synergies just make creatures to bash face and have removal to clear the board, and battle it out.  It's a fantasy card game meant for fun, not a first step to the pro tour. :)"

Just talking about whether a card is good or not is a great way to organically explore good gameplay and deck building strategy. And on top of that, it's a great way to help you memorize the cards."
lrcast,3bjasp,Airymon,2,Mon Jun 29 18:10:34 2015 UTC,"P1P1 - I think I'd take Flatten over the Risen Executioner. Kinda blows that the 3 best cards in the pack are all black, but oh well.  P1P9 - I think I'd take Artful Maneuver over Fate Forgotten in a deck that looks to be aggressive (and getting the Dromoka Captain through is pretty important).  P2P3 - Pacifism over Qal Sisma Behemoth I think (though I can see the argument - I think it's close).  P2P5 - I just find that I almost always cut Champion of Arashin. 4 mana + 2 toughness is just not a good combination. I'd take Great Teacher's Decree, which is really really good when it is good.  P3P3 - I'd take the Heelcutter here. The Dragonlord is a beautiful dream, but I think the deck is powerful enough without it, and Heelcutter is nuts.  P3P7 - Arashin Cleric for the sideboard over the unplayable Rally the Ancestors.  P3P8 - The RW fixer is pretty clearly the pick here. Defiant Ogre is pretty bad.  Comments above notwithstanding, that seemed like a pretty excellent draft - you were definitely in the right colors, and I'm probably nitpicking (and possibly just wrong on one or more of those).  Given the top-heaviness of your deck I would probably cut the Ogre and run an 18th land. The last few cards of your deck are not great, but the top end is so good, I think you had to run pretty bad to 0-3 with this."
lrcast,3bjasp,cferejohn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:56:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.  I definitely had to decide between the Flatten and the Executioner. I decided to go with that one, since I wasn't sure how good he would actually play in a game and I wanted to give it a try.  The Rally the Ancestor pick was pretty bad in hindsight. I was actually reading the card wrong the first time and thought it would give the creatures haste when I picked it. Apparently a common mistake for a lot of people.  I went with some of the creature picks, since I was feeling I was lacking creatures in general and the ones like Champion of Arashin didn't really fit well into my game plan.  I had a general problem stabilizing. Often non of my plays were really substantial before turn 4. I also had a lot of trouble with my 3 tail slashes and would end up with a no creature board and no chance to use them.  A few times I also got flooded really badly, which lead to some frustration and a few misplays.  In general it felt like I either couldn't stabilize or would run out of gas in a drawn out game. My bombs never managed to stick and even in cases where I got out Citadel Siege I would just lose to an opponents Sidisi and a bolstered Destructor Dragon that I couldn't get rid of.  Overall it felt like I had a deck that looked good to me on paper but couldn't perform at all in those situations."
lrcast,3bjasp,Wraithpk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"See, I don't think he was in the right colors.  I think he should have been RG.  He was getting some pretty heavy signals that that color combination was open in pack 1.  He moved into white to pick some pretty mediocre white cards over some pretty solid green ones.  Sure, he ends up getting rewarded with a lucky Citadel Siege, but if he was RG he gets a Heelcutter there, and gets a third Heelcutter instead of a duel land a few picks later.  The clearest sign that he should have been green is the pack 3 pick 7 Abzan Beastmaster that he passed.  There were also some spots he could have gotten an Epic Confrontation or two instead of mediocre white cards."
lrcast,3bjasp,cferejohn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:10:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that red was more obviously correct than white. I'm trying to figure out where you think he got ""mediocre"" white cards over Epic Confrontations. Dromoka Captain is decidedly not ""mediocre"" (which he takes over one P1P6). The only other confrontations he passes are in P2P1 (when he takes the Dragonlord) and P2P3 (when he takes the behemoth, and should have taken the Pacifism in my opinion). Confrontation may be a hair better than Pacifism, but it's not ""omg I have to change colors"" better).  The dual land over the Heelcutter was just a mistake - he should have taken the Heelcutter whether he was RG or WG.  Beastmaster is pretty unexciting in RG to be honest.   I think you are right that G was at least as open as W, but I'm not seeing a clear place to switch. If he had, he maybe ends up with some Segmented Krotiq's filling out the bottom of his deck, which are admittedly better than what he ended up with."

lrcast,3bjasp,Wraithpk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:24:19 2015 UTC,"I think his third pick Misthoof Kirin was the first mistake.  It was too early to look for signals of white being open, so I would have tried to stay on color with one of my first two picks.  I would have taken the Sabertooth Outrider there, which makes me less inclined to take the white cards later.  Dromoka Captain is ok, but it's not something that's going to pull me into white.  His mistake was letting a Misthoof Kirin and a Dromoka Captain pull him into white, and those two cards alone are not anywhere near strong enough to justify that."
lrcast,3bjasp,cferejohn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:49:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do agree with Outrider over Kirin - not sure how I missed that in my comments."

I think hedging on green there is better than taking Dragon Fodder.  On the very next pick, there was a clear signal that the RG combination was open with Savage Ventmaw, which would have been my pick over Deadly Wanderings.  In the next couple picks he could have then gotten a couple Krotiqs to top off his curve and a Pinion Feast, which is a fine sideboard card."
lrcast,3bjasp,nightfire0,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:58:47 2015 UTC,"Issues I see:    You have 3 two-drops and 2 three-drops (behemoth doesn't count), and no early removal to affect the board (tail slash rarely does anything on t3 with 1 power 2 drops). I like to have 8 early plays (t3 or before) minimum. They're especially important if you're trying to be aggressive (which RW usually is).  The deck seems to have identity issues - it's not particularly good at being aggressive (lack of 2 drops/good curve), nor is it particularly good at being controlling (you have 2 bombs, but your other 5 and 6 drops are mediocre, and RW just isn't well set up to play midrange/control). Also, your early drops aren't very good at helping you survive.    The two-drops you do have are weak and defensive (the 1/3's), and champion of arashin is below the curve in terms of stats if you're not abusing the lifelink (you have citadel siege, and tail slash/enduring victory to some extent, but not enough to make me excited about it). If you're trying to be aggressive you'd probably just prefer another sabertooth outrider/summit prowler.   Tail slash is not as good as it could be - you don't have many early drops (its best use is blasting blockers out of the way to further cement a tempo advantage), and you don't have many big creatures. War flare and heelcutter are other cards that are powerful in a vacuum, but need the right deck to fulfill their potential (good early curve).   Looking over everything again, I think the main problem is your that early curve is just bad - you don't have enough early game to successfully defend yourself or mount an effective offensive. The cost sort on mtgo is deceptive, because mana cost doesn't actually show when the card will typically be cast. Tail slash is not a 3 drop, nor is behemoth, and center soul and tormenting voice are not 2 drops. Of the 5 cards you can cast early, at least 2-3 of them are bad/filler level cards.   Try separating your combat tricks from your creatures - this will make it easier to spot problems with your curve."
lrcast,3bjasp,Greyfeld,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:31:49 2015 UTC,"Try separating your combat tricks from your creatures - this will make it easier to spot problems with your curve.   The first thing I do after the draft is finish is to sort the creatures separately from the spells (then move all the spells that create creatures (manifests, etc) up into the creature group).  This usually gives me a better idea of what my curve is going to look like.  Then of course you have to move cards around to where they'll probably be cast.  Creatures like Hewed Stone Retainers are going to get cast on turn 5+ most of the time, despite having a 3 mana cost."
lrcast,3bjasp,fremeer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:40:10 2015 UTC,yeah i like to think of the retainers as a vanilla creature so 4/4 would cost 5. but benefits are when u can play retainers is tempo advantage and the ability to abuse rebound.
lrcast,3bjasp,Greyfeld,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:20:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's definitely better in something with a lot of rebound.  Probably something like a UW Prowess deck.  Center Soul, Taigam Strike, Artful Maneuver, Ojutai's Summons, etc etc."

lrcast,3bjasp,iPadreDoom,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:13:13 2015 UTC,"I took some of the advice to heart and went into another draft yesterday evening. This time it went much better, even considering variance and all and I went 3-0.  Pic of the deck in question: http://puu.sh/iIN9E/39095323f0.jpg  I went much more aggressive this time. I kept the Deathbringer Regent in as a maybe greedy insurance policy, in the end I never even got to cast him cause the only time I drew him I was already winning anyway.  Also for some reason these Citadel Sieges keep seeking me out. I won't complain though. I went with Khans all the time in this deck and it worked pretty well."
lrcast,3bi07h,Hoppelars,3,Mon Jun 29 11:31:24 2015 UTC,"Looks like a rough draft. A couple things I noticed, and I'm gonna focus on your first few picks because that's probably where you want to be picking up your line: p1p2: This early in the draft I would have been focusing more on power over the utility and openness blinding souleater gives you. That's why I probably would have grabbed the Hikari. It's really good enough to play in any white deck. p1p3: not sure why you went with the smokebraider here. I realize it wasn't a great pack but here is where I think you could have stayed more open and not get hurt as much. Taking runed servitor doesn't feel great here but with nothing else great to take this would have been my pick.  Ok so right now we're kinda looking like elementals I'm guessing? not a great spot to be but could be worse.  p1p4: not sure why the myr smith here. We haven't seen a whole lot of artifacts and the ones we have seen haven't been great (no cranial plating). Not to mention this pack already has some of the other artifacts that you'd want. If we're elementals this looks rough for us especially since we haven't picked any of the elementals that make us want to be in the elemental deck (i.e. mulldrifters and aethersnipes) On the other hand there is at least one elemental in this pack and it would have been my pick regardless of the creature type. Ashenmoor gouger is a beating. p1p5: my guess here is you saw the 5th pick scatter the seeds and thought that meant green tokens was open. However what we have to take into account is that we haven't seen much else besides an early dread drone in p1p1 that would make anyone want to go into tokens. Or if there has been cards they've all been getting picked up and there was just 2 really good token cards in here. For example maybe a nest invader got picked up here. My pick would have been the Incandescent soulstoke.  Ok so I've watched the rest of the draft and yeah it looks like it was rough the rest of the way though. I think you had an interesting issue here, most of the time when people give advice for drafting they tell you to stay open and try to see your options. I think you ran into the opposite issue in that you were seeing good cards in different archetypes, and weren't willing to settle for the average cards in one archetype.  After all that looks like you 3-0'd anyway haha I'd like to know how the deck came together in the end and how happy you were with it.  tl,dr: early in the draft I don't think you stuck with any one archetype as much as you could/should have."
lrcast,3bi07h,way2tal42long,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:59:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about picking a strong card, but I also have been extremely unimpressed by Hikari every time I played it outside the dedicated spirits deck. (Air elemental is just not pulling its weight in this deck.)  I would take Thunderblust from that pack, as it's more or less a 2-for-1 to cast it.  It works in RG domain, it works in UR elementals, it even works in RW or RB aggro.  It does require a commitment to red, though.  I definitely agree with your Smokebraider assessment.  I think you only want to be elementals when you have picked some of the strong, expensive elementals (Spitebellows, Mulldrifter, Aethersnipe, Thunderblust) and get passed the smokebraiders late. If you dont get the smokebraiders, the evoke elementals are very good in multicolor ramp-control or basically any deck that can cast them, while smokebraiders are unplayable in any other deck.  The Myrsmith pick is where the wheels really came off.  Gouger actually does work well with souleater, because it means you're an aggressive deck that is probably content paying 2 life to tap with souleater.  Myrsmith goes in exactly one deck and one deck only.  It's extremely committing - your comment of it being less committing is very ""off""  I don't like the 5th pick scatter with literally 0 token-related cards preceeding it.  It was probably a pack just deep in green, not a signal.  I'd be easily taking soulstoke here, but that's after Thunderblust and Gouger.  Narcolepsy if you're not committing.  Baku again makes little sense.  We haven't seen a signal for spirits at all after 5 out of 8 packs, so it's not like we'll be wheeling any spirit cards except maybe a scuttling death (Hikari won't wheel.)"

P1P5: Scatter the seeds seems like a crazy hedge here. Even in your version. Youre starting to get a White artifact deck which can use Flayerhusk, which works in both Equipment focuses or straight artifact version. In my version I went for Narcolpsy cos I was happy to slide into a WU artifact deck.  P1P6: I think you may be playing a trick on me. You havnt really seen enough of a spirit signal to think you can use Waxmane Baxu. In your draft you could have used Sylvan Bounty and gone for a 5 color deck and using you Scatter, Dismember and Souleater.  In my version I picked up Mana Leak.  P1P7: Vampire Outcast seventh pick is a nice pickup but its not really for your deck. Not sure what I would have picked in your shoes. In my version I picked up frogmite.

I took the advice, putting 2 mountains in with bathe, roar, and war flare, as pretty much my wincon was going wide and either tapping their creatures or buffing mine.   I lost round two in straight sets to a deck with Sage-eye avengers, savage ventmaw, boltwing marauder and other bonkers cards. It's only real weakness was it being 4 colours, and he did not miss either game. In game 2, some late game shenanegains may have been possible to prolong the game, but i missed the three card combo that would have let me trade with one out of three of his 4+ power creatures. I'll review the game, but I feel I was just outclassed by the deck from the get go.  Won round three 2-0 thanks to a creature heavy green/blue deck that did not want to trade 3/2s with 2/Xs so I could go wide until Great Teacher's decree could come down on an overwhelming board, and game 2 some judicious use of war flare and ojutai's breath."

lrcast,3bjleu,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:33:03 2015 UTC,"I think I would have gone U/R instead of U/W.  You actually have more removal in red than in white, between your [[Bathe in Dragonfire]] and [[Draconic Roar]], even [[Collateral Damage]] in a pinch.  You also have plenty of decent, though not exciting creatures in red, like [[Summit Prowler]], [[Mardu Scout]], and [[Screamreach Brawler]] not to mention the very good [[Vaultbreaker]].  You could have then splashed white if you still weren't happy with the deck, without too much trouble.  But yeah, it is kind of a weak pool."
lrcast,3bh8cq,Nizzahon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:03:20 2015 UTC,"P1P1 - Atarka Pummeler is fine (though I'm not totally sure it's better than Warbrute). I definitely think the Illusory Gains is head and shoulders above either. It is high variance - some games it will just completely shut down your opponent - sometimes a player has 8 dash creatures and you side it out. I'm still taking it here.  Fwiw, I don't think Volcanic Vision is a good card, like, at all. Yes when you meet all the conditions (7 mana, expensive instant/sorcery in the yard) it is nuts, but that is a lot of ifs."
lrcast,3bh8cq,cferejohn,2,Mon Jun 29 06:25:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment!  I think Volcanic Vision is a severely underrated card in the format.    You definitely have to have the right deck for it, but I have had it work amazingly for me on a number of occasions. You need a decent number of instants or Sorceries with CMC 3 or greater, but that is especially easy to do in say, a R/B deck where you get multiple flattens and bathe in dragonfires.  Not to mention Sarkhan's Rage and so forth. Obviously I didn't take it here -- I didn't have the right deck for it, but it can definitely be good, a bomb even.  I'd be interested to hear the thoughts of others on it.  I think that Illusory Gains is weak enough against enough opponents that it just isn't first pickable most of the time, not in that pack anyway. Any opponent who plays creature tokens or dash guys just won't care about it.  Also, opponents with Exploit also don't care a whole lot about it.  That's a significant enough portion of the field that I don't value it that highly, certainly not ""head and shoulders"" above Pummeler or Warbrute in that pack."

lrcast,3bfton,Greyfeld,2,Sun Jun 28 21:11:25 2015 UTC,"It depends on the board state.  If you're ahead on board, and your opponent can't swing into you, you can sort of just play around it, and once they tap out or at least tap the mana for the trick you think they have, you can attack them.  If they are ahead of you, sometimes you have to play into the trick, and trade the removal/trick for one of your creatures."
lrcast,3bfton,Nizzahon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:14:18 2015 UTC,"So if you're ahead on the board, but the trick will clear one of your key creatures, you just sit and don't attack until you draw into something to deal with it, even if it gives him all the time in the world to build his board?  More specifically, I recently went up against a UB deck in round one of my current draft, and not only was he running 2 Butchers Glee, he was also recurring them with Monastery Loremaster.  If I dragged out the game too long, he'd start dropping Deathtouch creatures, which meant I couldn't attack in even if I wanted to.  This was on top of his actual removal, Sidisi's Faithful/Whisk for bounce, and Silumgar Sorcerer (just in case I played something fat that he couldn't easily spot remove).    Plus, he was running a royal crapton of card draw, so running him out of cards was never an option.  It wasn't unusual for him to have dug an extra 5-7 cards out of his deck by the end of the match.  I felt completely useless, because even though my deck was faster and more aggressive, I felt like he was just punishing me for trying to do anything on the board.  And he so rarely tapped out that I felt like I had very, very few opportunities to attack or play anything without risking getting 2-for-1'd."
lrcast,3bfton,Nizzahon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:41:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sit back at least until he taps out or taps the 2B necessary to cast a Butcher's Glee in that situation.  Also, keep in mind that if you have your own removal, if you can bait him into casting his Butcher's Glee (by attacking, or by blocking), you can 2 for 1 him with your removal in response to the Glee.  Also, in this particular situation I'm not sure there really was a way for you to do really well -- it sounds like your opponent had a really strong and well-rounded deck, and sometimes one just gets overpowered, there isn't always a way out of every situation, you know?  Sometimes we just have to lose."
lrcast,3bfton,sylverfyre,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:47:57 2015 UTC,"A lot of my deck's removal is sorcery speed, anyway.  Epic Contest, Hunt the Weak, Pacifism.  Stuff that you use to clear the board or lock down big threats, not stuff you can use to pre-empt a combat trick.  Hell, he used a Glee in response to my Epic Contest, once.  Had to blow Artful Maneuver to keep my creature from getting nuked.  Far as deck strength goes... I always seem to run into those players that have ridiculous decks.  For some reason, I'll put together a good deck, then I'll run into a player who made the same deck I did, but with higher quality cards.  Like the dude I just played who also went GW, but also drafted the 5/5 bolstering Dromoka, Enduring Scalelord, And some other huge power cards that I never even saw.  I still won, but that had more to do with being lucky as balls to get all my removal in the first few turns."
lrcast,3bfton,bearrosaurus,2,Sun Jun 28 21:51:27 2015 UTC,"You might have to make him blow the combat trick and kill your dude and then start using your own removal.  If you have no better way to play around glee, it's your only choice.  Maybe it's possible to make him blow glee on a less crucial creature, but you didn't exactly give us game replays or anything.   It's a lot better than having him glee in response to Epic."
lrcast,3bfton,sylverfyre,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:14:45 2015 UTC,"I'm reading through this, and it sounds like you're playing an aggro deck but still falling behind on board while your opponent has a combat trick in hand, and is holding up mana for it. Come on, dude, what's going -  Ah, you're playing Green/White  But really, this is 'have a plan' situation. If you have a Center Soul or Enduring Victory in your deck, then keep building your board until you draw a way to blow him out. Otherwise, you're not going to win by sitting on your ass against UB. Play to your outs."
lrcast,3bfton,sylverfyre,3,Sun Jun 28 22:21:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll remember that the next time I actually draw into my combat tricks.  Otherwise, my only real option is to just twiddle my thumbs and not attack in.  Unless you have some magic trick for drawing the exact cards you need from your deck that I'm not aware of.  And you can say whatever you want about GW, but I'd rather draft a decent set of cards than fight 3 other players for black or red, and end up with a hodgepodge of garbage.  Which is what usually happens unless I get lucky on the seat I'm sitting.  Hell, I've had 3 Flattens in a row passed to me, before, and still ended up fighting like 2 other people for black creatures and ended up with a mediocre deck."
lrcast,3bfton,bearrosaurus,2,Sun Jun 28 23:12:17 2015 UTC,"It can be totally correct to attack in and force out the glee, especially if you have an attack that lets you hold back a key creature so it doesn't get caught up in the fray.   Also, I'll gladly take 3 flattens + fight over the rest of black cards as long as I can figure out a second open color.  Playing white or green creatures + 3 flattens and some other choosy black cards would make me very happy.  If you're getting passed 3 flattens, you are supposed to be in black.  *The fact that Black is a deep color means it can support 3 black drafters at the table.  Even 4, as long as you find the right color to make primary with black secondary. *"

lrcast,3bf0uc,Malarazz,5,Sun Jun 28 17:08:09 2015 UTC,"P1P3 - I think I'd take Minister of Pain here, though admittedly it's close. There's just too many things that punish 1 toughness creatures. In fact I think I'd take the lightwalker over the Warrior as well just because it has a higher payoff. Also, if I had to choose I'd rather play the Corpseweft than the Pacifism, so I'd hedge towards the black card when it is close.  P1P6 - I think Coat With Venom is just better than Tread Upon, and you are more confidently in black than in green at this point I think.   P1P7 - White has seemed very closed and Artful Maneuver isn't much of a sign. There's not a bunch of great things in this pack, but the Goblin is reasonable, and it doesn't feel like all the exploit cards are being gobbled up.   P1P9 - While none of those blue cards are very good, the fact that 4/6 cards remaining in the pack are blue suggests blue is probably at least fairly open.  P2P1 - Very easily Ukud Cobra here for me. White did not seem open at all in pack 1 (you seem to be putting a lot of faith in Artful Maneuver - I see that thing going pick 10+ all the time).  I'll stop there, but in general by halfway through pack 2 it seemed very clear to me that you ""should"" have been in blue. Green occasionally seemed a bit open, but not so much that it would have moved me off of black."

lrcast,3bf0uc,bucs_and_squats,3,Sun Jun 28 23:55:29 2015 UTC,"I think moving into Green with only a Scaleguard Sentinels to show for it may have been your first mistake, and then it kind of snowballed. I don't know the format super well, and I'm not the best player myself, but it just doesn't seem like a great strategy. Pack 1, Pick 5 is just bleh in general so I can understand taking the Sentinels, but Pack 1, Pick 6 over Coat with Venom definitely feels like a mistake. You want to be in Black more than you want to be in Green.  Pack 2, Pick 4 is where I feel it goes off the rails. At this point, you're mostly White/Black with some Blue and very little Green. You do have an Enduring Scalelord, but you can splash that one if need be, just grab an Evolving Wilds and you're golden. Circle of Elders is a lot of commitment with fairly little payoff when there's a perfectly good Student of Ojutai in the pack."
lrcast,3bf0uc,hawkshaw1024,3,Sun Jun 28 17:53:48 2015 UTC,"Moving into Green was especially awkward since we passed a steady stream of Green playables (starting with a pick 3 Epic Confrontation) in otherwise weak packs, making it pretty likely the person on our left would move into it. That cuts it pack 2, and then even if it's open for pack 3, FRF green is pretty awful. So you really only get a small handful of good, open Green picks, which a Scaleguard Sentinels is not worth moving in for."
lrcast,3bf0uc,Suedars,3,Sun Jun 28 20:39:37 2015 UTC,"One thing of note. Perhaps you read into the fact that you got a 7th pick Artful Maneuver and that was late as you mentioned you like that card over Tread Upon and you took Tread Upon over Coat & Zephyr Scribe.  My experiences differ greatly on Maneuver. In fact I'm pretty unwilling to even play the card in most decks. At this point in the format, I think most people are on that evaluation. As such, feel free to keep playing the card, especially if it performs well for you, but reading it as a signal that white is open will steer you wrong more often than not."
lrcast,3bf0uc,IzDaisho,3,Sun Jun 28 19:23:40 2015 UTC,"I think your biggest issue was that you were way too quick to give up on black.

lrcast,3bf0uc,Csquared08,2,Sun Jun 28 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"Well, you do get pretty unlucky in pack 3, particularly, opening a pack with very little on-color and then getting passed nothing. This is why people try to stay away from green, in particular, though, and why it's often a bad idea to try to move in even if you do think it's open - it's just very possible to go through FTK without a single green playable."
lrcast,3bf0uc,Sceptilesolar,2,Sun Jun 28 18:26:22 2015 UTC,"I think your first mistake was trying to be main white.  White is not a very good color in this format, it should be a secondary color.  The GW deck can be pretty good if you get the proper synergies, but you didn't, really.  With your initial pick of Corpseweft, which is a good limited card, I would be looking to try to be either RB or UB.  Blue was being signaled open to you pretty early in pack 1, you should have moved to blue.  Black also ended up being pretty open, so I agree with your hindsight that UB was the way to go.  I believe the UB deck that was available to you would have been much better than what you did draft, although your choices were rather weak all-around."
lrcast,3bf0uc,Wraithpk,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"Blue was being signaled open to you pretty early in pack 1, you should have moved to blue.   While I agree it would have been a better deck overall, I don't agree it was being signaled open in pack 1. Picks 2 and 3 had 0 good blue cards. Pick 4 had Ojutai Interceptor and Gurmag Drowner, both of which are solid commons.   But then picks 5 onwards had playable cards like Zephyr Scribe and Sidisi's Faithful, but not really any other strong card. You kinda need to keep getting passed back to back strong cards before you can say ""ok, this color is open."""
lrcast,3bf0uc,Wraithpk,3,Sun Jun 28 20:29:23 2015 UTC,"You can't really judge by picks 2 and 3, the packs just might not have had good blue cards to start with.  As pack 1 went on, there were a lot of blue cards being passed around.  They were mostly decent cards and not anything crazy, but the sheer quantity meant that blue was not being picked heavily.  This will benefit you in later packs, as people will pass actually good blue cards they open.  Edit:  Plus if you are cutting off blue at this seat, you're likely to see even more blue than he already did in packs 2 and 3."
lrcast,3bf0uc,tvkelley,2,Sun Jun 28 20:59:37 2015 UTC,"I think the p2p8 youthful scholar was a pretty strong signal, the p1p4 drowner was pretty solid too.  I would probably have ended up UB splash red, and the available lands tabling p3 point that this would have worked out pretty well.  But I hate WG in this format and would need a very strong reason to stay off both black and red regardless, so I never would have looked at some of the white cards that were chosen after pacifism (a great speculative pick that wouldn't have panned out).  I also don't like the p1p5 sentinel pick, gg is rough and it's mostly unplayable even if you have a dragon or two (if you want green take the morph, else take the dash flyer or blue exploit).  Tread upon is really bad, no way to take it over coat p1p6, and then goblin is much better than the white combat trick.  I think what happened was, you were locked into WG early and didn't look at some other choices, and some of the basic evaluations were off, and the result was mediocre.  I'm not sure if you have a 3-0 deck regardless, your first picks were all really lame (that just happens sometimes), but I think you have a decent 2-1 deck if you go UB or UBr."
lrcast,3bf0uc,pahamack,2,Sun Jun 28 23:45:32 2015 UTC,"I looked at your first pack and a half (your picks would change how people draft around you so it's useless looking at anything after that) and I totally agree with your moving into GW, it seemed open. The only pick I disagreed with in pack 1 was p1p1, I think pacifism is a lot stronger than corpseweft. I think moving into black for such marginal playables as minister of pain/coat with venom/goblin is a mistake.  I would've been either gw or uw after pack 1 but epic confrontation p2p1 would've sealed it, but I guess you wanted to waffle between those two by selecting enduring victory. That card is playable but not great, and I would've committed here.  Yes, blue is very open, but that's being rotty. You didn't really get much of a signal on that colour until that late youthful scholar in pack 2, and that's way too late to switch colours."
lrcast,3bf0uc,rubberducky22,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:44:41 2015 UTC,"I find signals can be pretty hazy in Dragons since the packs can be pretty weak, I think that's why you kind of floundered around in pack 1 a bit. That said, I would have done a couple things differently than you.    First, I would have taken minister of pain over dromoka warrior. I don't much care for the warrior, and the minister has a lot of utility.  Second, I think I would have taken the herald of dromoka over the ojutai interceptor. The interceptor is fine, but not so great I'd want to take an off color card.  Same in pick 5: scaleguards is alright, but not much better than a reckless imp, which again is on color.  Pick 6 coat over tread upon. Pick 7 goblin over maneuver.   So I think I would have ended up much more heavily black after pack 1. Digging a little deeper, I'm not sure if I actually like corpseweft into pacifism all that much. You've all but guaranteed that the person you're passing to takes pacifism into epic confrontation, making your wg shift kind of awkward. It's possible that pacifism is a better first pick than corpseweft (but I don't have enough experience with the card to be sure).

Generally speaking I prefer pacifism over epic because pacifism is unconditional removal, whereas with epic you need a creature with enough power to kill the target and enough toughness to make it not a 2-for-1.   However I concur that pacifism adding to formidable and being exploit fodder are real drawbacks. I also prefer BW over BG.

lrcast,3bf0uc,cferejohn,0,Sun Jun 28 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"You're actually very wrong about pacifism over epic. Both the Pantheon and Frank Karsten's pick order has epic higher on the list, and pacifism simply has too many drawbacks in this format to make it the ""unconditional"" removal it normally is.   Besides the maneuvering picks in pack 1 that are debatable, pack 3 pick 6 you take a Fruit of the first tree over dragon bell monk.. a stone-cold unplayable card over a decent filler. You definitely could have had a reasonable GW beatdown deck."

I'm sure I can cherry pick through their lists and find lots of orders that most of us would think are wrong at this point in the format.  Pacifism and Confrontation both have downsides, but I don't think there's a huge gap between them, so hedging based on color preference seems reasonable.  I personally agree with OP that Pacifism is a nose better than Epic Confrontation for me. If you are behind it is likely to be a better card (while confrontation is probably better when you are ahead or developing, especially in a deck that tends to want to be aggressive)."

The format is more mature now, so color preference is a little less meaningful (because now black and red are appropriately drafted higher, so the self-balancing act of limited takes place.)  Also the UB exploit deck is pretty universally considered to be less incredible than it was considered to be at the Pro Tour."
lrcast,3bf0uc,cferejohn,2,Sun Jun 28 20:03:31 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of other support for this - epic also wins you the game a a fair bit more often when played according to mtgo statistics. Either way, I'd rather defer to some of the best players for early pick orders - this is pick 2 and pick orders are pretty much exactly for these types of situations."
lrcast,3bf0uc,5-s,2,Sun Jun 28 20:02:39 2015 UTC,"As pointed out, those pick orders are quite old. I'd be curious to see the people who made them go back and update them.  Also, do we know if the MTGO stats count the spell being cast or resolved? Because the downside of Epic Confrontation is that your creature gets killed in response, meaning you get 2-for-1ed and the spell never resolves."

lrcast,3bf0uc,5-s,2,Sun Jun 28 20:20:21 2015 UTC,"This doesn't matter, theyr'e discussing picks for the PT, which is a totally different metagame from the meta in your local store or MTGO now.   They also have different goals, where their goal is to get a reasonable deck to 2-1 a pt pod that's swiss, the goal here is probably to 3-0 a pod.  I value any of the prime common removal spells in DTK over corpseweft because those will always do something in the early game and I consider this to be an aggressive format. Sometimes corpseweft does absolutely nothing.  I think people undervalue pacifism due to exploit/formidable. With an aggressive start, you don't care, you just use pacifism to keep attacking. Costing 2 is amazing: remove their blocker and add to the board on the same turn sometimes just wraps up that game for you. It also functions as a get out clause against a dragonlord. pacifism on a dragonlord dromoka is awesome.  Also: consider putting the cards ""in the arena"" as Marshall says. Pacifism doesn't even add cards for them to exile with their corpseweft!"
lrcast,3bf0uc,pahamack,2,Mon Jun 29 23:33:10 2015 UTC,"That's such a silly idea, that somehow pro players are only trying to 2-1 their pods. Players like Huey and Owen are certainly not trying to just have a positive record, they're trying have the best chance of doing as well as they could.  Also, we weren't even talking about corpseweft vs pacifism - there I agree pacifism is a reasonable pick. We were talking about epic confrontation vs pacifism, where all the evidence and pro opinion I've seen is that epic is a better card. People can give anecdotes otherwise, but I've shown my sources."
lrcast,3bf0uc,rubberducky22,2,Tue Jun 30 05:13:21 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, well I would've picked pacifism because I would've picked pacifism p1p1.  The PT is swiss, and there's more constructed rounds. Going into a deep colour is a lot safer than gambling on a colour where you might not be rewarded pack 3 since if you lose one round you're still in the pod. If you can manage to 2-1 your day 1 pods and have a good deck tested by a team for constructed you'll go far in the PT. If I was in a team full of hall of famers I would be pretty confident in the team's deck choices and testing, most people don't test as thoroughly or have access to some of the best minds in the game.   In an MTGO 8-4 you lose round one you're out. Better to be in an open colour than be one of multiple players in, say, red, where even if you have a good deck someone's bound to have a better red deck than you if they're to your right. In a swiss though? I'd love being in red as you have no problems getting 23 playables.  The PT format rewards being conservative with your drafting. A knockout 8-man rewards swinging for the fences. Losing in the first round is the same as losing in the second."
lrcast,3bf0uc,sylverfyre,2,Tue Jun 30 10:27:14 2015 UTC,"These are some interesting points, I had never even thought about passing pacifism and then passing epic confrontation implying that person might be in GW."

It was still early, though, so I figured it might've been because these packs just didn't have very many Black cards in them. When I saw the second Consume Spirit, I figured that nobody wanted to be in Black and just went in.  I was a little nervous about going into Blue because I passed the Domineer in P1P1. Ultimately, I figured that Cobalt Golem and Consume Spirit both were speculative picks but that Consume Spirit, while riskier, also had the higher upside, and it was still early in the draft.  Thank you for your thoughts!"

And just avoiding blue and red cards.  Anyways Battlegrace Angel was my first pick and black seemed more open than green.  Would prefer 2 Nameless Inversion but having all the white hard removal was awesome.  Death Denied is still kinda meh and I sb'ed out vs bloodthirst.  Terashi's Grasp wasn't that great this time and got boarded or close to it every game.  4 Kami was pretty cool for my 2 drops, 2 Changeling, 2 Thief, and 2 Baku was a nice mix, though 4 Baku would be ideal.    Moonlit Strider is the boss and I've had pretty decent luck with Swans.  The Angel was bomb city.  Midnight Banshee was pretty decent.  One interesting pick was after I already had a lot of removal I got the 1/1 black flier that grows when a creature dies and Pillory and decided to just go with the removal."

lrcast,3bdh89,hawkshaw1024,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:24:35 2015 UTC,Oh what do you guys think of me leaving the 3rd Changeling in the sb?  I like the card a lot but did it for the mana curve.  But maybe he should have been in there over Death Denied or Terashi?  I sideboarded him and the 2/1 wither guy vs aggro so I could stall the board early till my fliers and card advantage took over.
lrcast,3bbrll,bearrosaurus,9,Sat Jun 27 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"It's two slightly different things at play here, one which happens in both Constructed and Limited, and one which mainly only happens in Constructed.  So the first is varying your threats/answers. If I've already got 3 Nameless Inversions and I get a pack with another or a Spread the Sickness, I should take the Spread because I have killing cheap creatures already covered, and I need to be able to deal with bombs, even though Nameless Inversion might be the better card (say I'm in WB Spirits). The same goes for threats. If I've already got 3 Raise the Alarms in my GW deck, maybe I should take the Scion of the Wild instead to get better at going tall for when going wide doesn't work.  There's also the case of varying between threats and answers, which is something Luis touched on a couple episodes ago. Basically the more removal you have, the worse each subsequent removal spell gets, because it's going to be killing a worse threat than the one previously. Similarly, having 2 Gorehorn Minotaurs is great, but past that they start to lose value because they're great on turn 4, but any hand where you draw multiples means you've got a Gorehorn Minotaurs you're not playing on turn 4 and curving out with.  A classic conundrum during old core set drafts was Pacifism vs. Serra Angel. And even though the Pacifism was usually better in a vacuum, if it was P3P1 and you already had 3 Pacifisms and no Serra Angels, the Angel would probably be better because you've already got enough removal for their most pressing threats, so it's better to take an excellent threat of your own.  You see the same thing happen in Constructed. Hero's Downfall is great, but you need to run some Bile Blights too or you'll just get run over by mono-red. And Siege Rhino is a great finisher, but sometimes you need the grindiness of Tasigur.  That's generally what's going on when you see someone varying their threats between Shikaris and Slaughtermasters.  The Shock vs. Naturalize thing is a bit different, and more has to do with aiming a Constructed deck against a metagame, and because there's much less of a static format to shoot for in Limited, it doesn't apply as much here.  For instance, yeah, it might be uncomfortable knowing your deck has no outs to enchantments, but if no decks with enchantments made a showing at day 2 of the GP last week, maybe you can just assume you won't have to face them and run that 4th shock instead, because mono-red is a thing. Or maybe there were a few people still playing UW Heroic or something, but it was 3% of the field and mono-red was 15%, so cutting that Shock for a Naturalize would lower your overall win percentage, because odds are you won't even face UW.  So yeah, you don't necessarily want to water down your deck to be able to answer every conceivable threat, but that also doesn't mean you want your removal suite to be 4x Silumgar's Scorn 4x Hero's Downfall 4x Crux of Fate.  (Also maindecking Naturalize as a 41st card is really suspect outside of very unusual formats, and I probably wouldn't listen to whoever said that)"
lrcast,3bbrll,Suedars,0,Sat Jun 27 19:21:53 2015 UTC,"I dug up the podcast, it was Jon Becker on top 8 magic #411 and after a little bit of research, it seems like he's on an imaginary mission to justify 41 card limited decks. And even BDM and Mike Flores don't take his logic too seriously (which is saying something).  Gorehorn Minotaurs is a good example, but I guess what bothers me most of all is 'checklisting'. Specifically like, 'last pick I took Gorehorn Minotaurs over Vampire Outcasts, so on this one I'm going to take outcasts over gorehorn' as if they need to get 1x of every good card for their deck. Or flip-flopping on Rampant Growth v Wayfarer's Bauble. One should just be better than the other.  (And I don't want to nitpick your other examples too much because I can see the point they try to make, but constructed does play always 4x with Downfall, Scorn, and Rhino and also I wouldn't mind making a Raise the Alarm theme deck to go all out on Fortify, rather than turning on my opponent's removal with Scion)."
lrcast,3bbrll,sylverfyre,2,Sat Jun 27 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"I dislike your gorehorn/vampire outcasts example because they're nearly the same type of threat and they also have double-colored mana in what wants to be a land-light deck.  You should absolutely pick the same one twice in that case (the one that lines up with your primary color, vampire outcasts in case of tie due to power level.)  However, Bloodthirst is going to heavily be about balancing your curve, and passing the 3rd Gorehorn because you're taking a cheaper threat which is worse in a vacuum is still important for your deck to function so you aren't playing 3/3 Minotaurs.  Rampant Growth vs Wayfarer's Bauble there really isn't one that's strictly better - colorless IS meaningful on your fixing, but the extra mana is noteworthy too.  I think the wide vs tall example was correct - the token deck needs a balance of engine and payoff, and too much of one and not enough of the other is harmful.  Synergy decks in both constructed and limited are about balancing the right amount of engine and payoff.   Thus you will often find yourself passing one for the other back and forth correctly, regardless of whether its the same card - It can totally  be correct to take the first 2 raises but then take a Kavu Primarch or Scion over the third raise because you actually don't want to go allin on raise - you need stuff that pays off for having raise the alarm.  This does happen in constructed too, especially when you're looking at cards with similar functions but with restrictions Figuring out where your Bile Blight vs Ultimate Price split is important, along with answering questions such as ""how many Crux do I run (esper dragons has correctly run with 1 or 2 crux at multiple times during this standard.  Right now it runs more because devotion is more prevalent in the current meta.)  One is not necessarily better than the other and a split makes sense based on the expected meta."

It can definitely be right to take, say, Raise the Alarm over the third Sunlance."

lrcast,3bbrll,BonSequitur,2,Sat Jun 27 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"UW control definitely had some pretty weird cards that it wasn't running 4 of, like Last Breath.  This happens all the time in a control deck's removal suite.  RTR/THS was kindof a poor standard to analyze though.  Devotion decks naturally are going to gravitate towards 4-of due to the nature of the devotion mechanic.    INN/RTR standard was very much in line with what /u/czarandy said."
lrcast,3bbrll,deworde,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:24:12 2015 UTC,"Well,  A. I know removal splits their suite. I wrote about that exactly in the original post  B. A lot of UW control decks in that year did run 4 Last Breath. So it's saying something when the archetype that's supposed to be running a wide variety of cards looks like this.  C. Every linear deck is going to be pushed to 4x. Infect, Tempered Steel, Delver, Alara Jund, Faeries, White Weenie and the ever present RDW are all focused, consistent decks playing the max of their favorite cards. Maybe INN/RTR was the exception?"
lrcast,3bbrll,priceQQ,2,Sun Jun 28 21:11:45 2015 UTC,"In Constructed, usually you see three-ofs or two-ofs used to fine-tune a curve. If you determine that you need ten three-drops, you play four of your best one, four of the next best one, and then two of the third best one.  You also see them in control decks. One-ofs, particularly, show up when you have access to tutoring or just when you have a very long game deck. If you expect to see all of your cards over the course of a game, having a singleton answer or threat gets a lot better.  A normal Limited deck is not as focused as a Constructed deck; usually, we build decks that can play the aggressive or controlling side of a matchup. With 40 cards decks, we also see many more of our cards in a typical game. It's not unusual to end a game of Limited with 20 or less cards left in the library.  A three-of in Limited shows up roughly as often as a four-of in Constructed, and there are definitely effects that you don't want to see too many of in a game, because additional ones get a lot worse.  So don't look at this in terms of sacrificing consistency for well-roundedness - you're trying to increase consistency by making your deck well-rounded. Over the course of a game, you want to draw (say) six lands, six creatures, and two removal spells; so you're trying to get the numbers right to make that as consistent as possible.  Slaughtermaster and Sunspear Shikari are so close that trying to not draft the ""loses to Shrivel"" deck might be invaluable, but I think this is a corner case. But the thinking here is, against most matchups, drawing two slaughtermasters is almost the same as drawing a slaughtermaster and a shikari; but against the Plagued Rusalka deck, the latter is clearly much better.  Having that diversity of cards also gives you more options to sideboard - if your opponent is playing cards that punish 1-toughness creatures and you have 6 of them in your deck, you probably just have to live with their Plagued Rusalka or Electrolize being awesome. If you only have 2, you can potentially swap them for different creatures."
lrcast,3bbrll,daveclarkeart,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:35:19 2015 UTC,"Is the idea that your pool should be diverse enough to give you answers, but your deck should be consistent? Because in constructed, you put your Naturalizes in the sideboard. In Limited, you have to draft them if you want them.  Another reason could be that if it's the 3rd Slaughtermaster, the archetype could be pretty open, so more might arrive (because what other deck wants it?)"

White is really stronger in FRF, so I imagine white is weaker in 3xDTK. Same with blue. I think green goes up vs DDF. Red and black remain very strong. Expect decks to be really streamlined and probably pretty aggro, so I would prioritize 2-drops. Otherwise, just read signals and get into the open colors since you're going to want to be straight 2-color."

lrcast,3b6jhg,tmurdock,6,Fri Jun 26 21:16:32 2015 UTC,Actually no sexist and racist remarks are literally not welcome at magic tournaments. Players should receive warnings and eventually be dropped from events if they fail to listen to instruction on this. It doesn't matter if it's away from a game - discriminatory language is not welcome in venues where sanctioned magic is being played. The only reason you get away with this now is many TOs and judges aren't fully aware of the recent updates about this.  Edit: typo - thanks autocorrect
lrcast,3b6jhg,mtg_liebestod,-1,Sat Jun 27 17:46:34 2015 UTC,"Does the MTR specify what a ""sexist"" or ""racist"" remark is? Unlikely. iirc the recent updates just was an extension of the harassment policy and would cover cases where a Player A made a racist/sexist comment that was aimed at B. It wouldn't cover a white dude getting mad at a white dude because the other guy made a comment considered racially insensitive. If I'm wrong on this, please point me to the relevant MTR guidelines."
lrcast,3b6jhg,tmurdock,2,Sun Jun 28 06:29:35 2015 UTC,No it doesn't specify judges are meant to figure this out based on some examples. It would cover the scenario you're describing - you what your answer or regular or competitive
lrcast,3b6jhg,tmurdock,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:39:53 2015 UTC,"since you mention the MTR I assume you're interested in competitive - here's what it says about unsporting conduct   http://wiki.magicjudges.org/en/w/Annotated_IPG/Unsporting_Conduct  It absolutely covers the example you describe, even if one or more of the players is not even enrolled in the event, but would fall under USC - Minor http://wiki.magicjudges.org/en/w/Annotated_IPG/Minor and the penalty here is a warning at first but game losses if the warning goes unheeded.  What you're thinking of is USC - Major and yes to get a penalty for that there's a higher crumminess bar... the exact wording is that what matters is if ""the action could reasonably create feelings of being harassed, threatened, bullied, or stalked."" Some judges will still give players an unofficial warning because there's a lot of ignorance around why this stuff matters but you're playing with fire to count on that. I also wouldn't recommend flirting with the line between USC Minor and Major because even though what you described is probably Minor, it's intentionally written to be open to the subjective interpretation of the (head) judge of the event so again not something you really want to mess around with."

To extend your point, is there any difference between you saying a something offensive in a conversation between two people that can easily be overheard and me standing in your vicinity and loudly saying that I think the things you said are sexist? In both cases, it's merely a matter of free speech, right? If your worry is about the restriction of said speech, then I don't see how you can possibly be upset about me using my free speech in basically the same way that you are.

lrcast,3b6jhg,zvazda,5,Sun Jun 28 07:11:19 2015 UTC,"You have found the exact crux of the argument.   I would assume that there are places where our morals are absolute, right?   If you overheard someone joking to their friends or on the phone that they lost to an african american player so they were thinking about lynching them after the tournament was over... you'd consider that enough to speak up, right?  I know that if someone joked about me being Jewish after they lost to me I would be infuriated. I wouldn't care if they were having a ""private"" conversation on the phone or if they were just joking with friends. I assume you'd think I was right to think that?  If someone was joking about bombing the LGS you would definitely say something.  As soon as someone is having a conversation that YOU CAN HEAR you are more than welcome to speak up because they made the mistake of having the conversation where you can hear them.  The crux of this issue is that we are trying to move what is socially acceptable because there are places where there are already things that are socially unacceptable.  I think we all appreciate that a white dude using the N word in a ""joking"" manner is not appropriate. About 10 years ago there was a big push that in the same way racism is socially maligned, so should homophobia be. It's made a huge difference, as evidenced by the monumental decision by the Supreme Court yesterday.  Yes, I am pushing for a generally accepted moral absolute in terms of how women are treated, talked about and thought about. You are pushing against that. You are pushing AGAINST a large group of people being treated equally, fair and well which is mystifying to me.  You are allowed to have your own values as to what's right and wrong, you're just not allowed to have them when it comes to how it affects other people. That's why you're not allowed to feel that it's right to murder people. That's why you're not allowed to feel that it's morally right to steal things.  You can say homophobic, racist and sexist stuff all you want. That's free speech.

Fundamentally disagree, for roughly the same reasons that I think one can oppose racism without wanting racism to be a capitol offense. That is, yes we should treat people respectfully, blah blah blah. But that doesn't mean that every shared social space has to become a scorched-earth battleground where you're trying to advance your notion of respectful treatment.   you're just not allowed to have them when it comes to how it affects other people. That's why you're not allowed to feel that it's right to murder people.   Uh, actually you are allowed to feel that way. LGSes are not kicking people out for committing thoughtcrimes.   LGS's have the right to say that kind of talk is not welcome here and we as a community have a right to say that's not acceptable in our community.   LGSes can do what they want. I don't think anyone's disputing that. The issue is that ""we as a community"" is an ill-formed concept. Coastal American progressives imposing their idiosyncratic values on everyone else can be called a ""community consensus"", but it can also rightly be seen as a form of cultural imperialism, an attempt from outsiders to impose their values on subcommunities they don't actually interact with.

Focus on big threats, and answers to your opponents' big threats, while taking advantage of small synergies.  Aggro decks typically want to curve out with a lot of small creatures and win quickly, and in DDF sealed (or any sealed, really) you can't reliably do that.

The mono black version of this plays exactly like a suicide deck so I tend to try to splash red for all the great hate and [[Grab the Reigns]] as the ultimate finisher.   And honestly [[ebon Drake]] and [[Blind Creeper]] are some of the most underrated cards in the format. Nothing really trades with the creeper and if they do block you simply just kill their 2/2 and pass, playing a removal on their next crit. Follow that up with a chit rat or some equp and you are smooth sailing."

lrcast,3b568m,C0nfuzzled,5,Fri Jun 26 01:39:22 2015 UTC,"Remember that unlike constructed decks, draft decks don't tend to go ""really hard"" in aggro or control directions.  They tend to all be kinda midrangey with some minor slants towards aggro or control.  Knowing what a typical draft deck looks like goes a long way towards drafting well - you want an idea of what you're aiming towards.  You want a decent curve with most of your stuff castable around 3-4 mana.  You almost always want around 17 land, 16ish creatures (instants/sorceries that make creatures count), fill the remainder with spells.  And you want many of those spells to affect the board in some way: removal spells mostly but interactive spells that affect combat also help.   If you're going to cut creature count to make room for spells, be very careful of doing it to make room for spells that don't affect the board, but if it's gonna be removal spell after removal spell then it's probably fine.  Watch some pro draft videos like on Channelfireball, they tend to be good at explaining and deckbuilding and playing out the games."
lrcast,3b568m,sylverfyre,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:58:27 2015 UTC,"Good breakdown on deck slot numbers. Typically a normal midrange limited deck will look like the below. Sometimes you can get down towards the 12 creature range depending on what types of creatures and what types of other spells you get, but definitely shoot for 16-17 creatures until you feel you are getting comfortable drafting solid decks.   17-18 lands 15-18 creatures 4-8 spells"
lrcast,3b568m,LarpingWombat,3,Fri Jun 26 12:09:51 2015 UTC,"Learn the difference between a good card and a bad card.  Don't draft bad cards.  Second, learn the difference between playable cards vs unplayable cards.  Now that we've cut about 25% of the card pool, you can now learn how to draft.  Here are 5 tips that can really help you become a better drafter.    Pick the best* card.  Keep an open mind - Don't draft an unplayable card in your color just because it's in your color.  Don't get married to your first pick.  Don't walk in the draft with a certain color or archetype in mind.  You need decent removal - Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.  You can't let your opponent run away with the game because you literally don't have a way to get rid of something.  Have enough creatures - The fastest way to lose a game of Limited is to not have a board presence.  Practice, practice, practice - Magic is a very complex game.  You can't get good without practice.   Here are some articles to help learn to evaluate and pick cards better."
lrcast,3b568m,feh1325,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:54:59 2015 UTC,"Good points here. Knowing the ""best"" card just takes some time and experience with the cards to know. Dont forget about removal; I tend to give removal spells higher grades than other spells (including a lot of creatures) so that I always have some cards that will have a strong impact on the board."
lrcast,3b568m,LarpingWombat,3,Fri Jun 26 12:07:19 2015 UTC,"I am in the same place as you: just started playing MTG just over a month ago and am focusing on drafting. I have started to have some success the last two FNM drafts I went to. These are the things that I have found really helped me the most so far:     Spend some serious time looking at the cards and coming up with your own evaluations. Listen to the quadrant theory episodes (184 and 248). I would recommend doing this BEFORE listening to the set reviews as it will help you learn the set faster and you want to exercise/develop that skill. Listening to the set review will just put you in a place where you do whatever Marshall and LSV said to do without really knowing why. Don't get stuck on one of your early picks. Be willing to swap colors away from a first or second pick bomb. This one is difficult, but be open to ""signals"" during the draft. Example: if you start out with Green picks and by pick 4 or 5 you stop seeing good Green cards or any green cards at all, you might want to reevaluate what colors are available and move in.  Be mindful of your curve as you draft (remember that in live you are allowed to look at your pick pile) and dont let the fun expensive creatures get you in trouble. I was starting to realize that I was getting too excited by 5+ drops and was ending up with card pools that were skewed to the expensive side of the curve. This led to slow and inconsistent decks. 3 drops are the most important spot in your curve (in this format) so make sure you have enough. Megamorphs can help you here by giving you a turn 3 play while also helping you with some late game finishers. Similar to the last point: there are a LOT of really good 4 drops in this format. Be careful and dont overdraft this slot.  I would recommend against worrying about drafting a control or aggro deck. As someone else said, most decks will be mid-range decks. So focus on value (well priced creatures that will either trade and/or block well along with strong removal) and 2-for-1 deals.   Good luck, it is a fun ride! And dont get discouraged, MTG is an extremely complex game and there will always be more to learn and level up."
lrcast,3b568m,LarpingWombat,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:03:27 2015 UTC,"Sure, I can start you with something.  Have you listened to the set reviews from LR yet? They go into so much detail on card evaluation, and were very helpful for me when I first starting drafting (that was only a few months ago...)  Since listening to those, I've gone through and listened to most of the list of most helpful episodes which is found on this reddit somewhere. (Recently there was an episode called the top 10 or 11 mistakes in limited and how to avoid them- you might start there).  Then it's just practice- also never drop as a new player especially. You have already invested so much time and money into a draft you need the practice so just fight through and you may come up with some wins that were unlikely. Remember that the best players in the world only win around 60% of the games or something like that, because this game has a very high variance. So just try to play and draft as much as you can- but always try to think about why you are picking the cards you pick and why you are making the plays you make.  You can play either aggro or control depending what you are more comfortable with- most people start out aggro I think since it is more straightforward.   Try to make sure you are playing a lot of creatures (15ish) and that you have a good curve (ie some 2 some 3 some 4 and then alot less five six or seven costing creatures).   Keep playing, but have fun and try to enjoy learning!"
lrcast,3b568m,tduanebarr,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:49:46 2015 UTC,"This is a good opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a set.  DTK/FRF is already a mature format, but Magic: Origins is brand new.  The set review show should be happening in the next couple of weeks.  Read through the spoiler and listen to the review.  Pay the most attention to the Commons and Uncommons because you will see them all the time, but only encounter some of the rares.  When in doubt: Pick the cheaper card. Take the removal spell. Don't hate draft. Pay attention to what the person on your right is passing to you, but don't worry about what you are passing."
lrcast,3b568m,Ixothial,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:20:48 2015 UTC,"I had someone in your position in the draft last night. In the end she decided to watch rather than play, but i can more or less repeat what I said to her:  Drafting is a great way of learning the game. You will encounter and use more cards in a set through drafting. It's a great way of simply learning what Magic cards are and what good cards typically look like.  I can't speak for you, but for me drafting is a low pressure environment. I'm there to have fun and I would not consider dropping if I lost my first two matches. My advice here is don't drop. Keep playing. Not every card in your deck is bad and playing games with them is a good way to learn their value.  Saying ""my deck is bad"" or being told that is not helpful, to you or anyone else. Do you still have the cards? If so, post a decklist and tell us why you thought certain cards were good.  You're one month into the game, don't expect yourself to be able to evaluate cards immediately. Like other activities, the more you do it the easier it will come. I'd recommend you check out some of the card rating threads on this sub, especially for Fate and Dragons, to see what others think.  Some draft basics: evasive creatures (e.g. a 4/4 of 5/x flyer) are great to have creature removal is next card advantage should follow, especially where it is wrapped in a creature (e/g/ Youthful Scholar) solid creatures and a couple of combat tricks should round out your deck.  Aim for 22 or 23 cards, plus land. Try and have a deck where you can use all your mana each turn, should you wish.  Learning anything is not about not making mistakes; it's about recognising mistakes and avoiding them in the future."

lrcast,3b48gv,Not-even-in-flames,2,Fri Jun 26 01:12:03 2015 UTC,"I'd have easily replaced it with the singleton Grim Contest.  His removal suite is pretty shallow, and the monument he's running also taps for black.  He's already running 8 forests, so I don't think replacing the Thornwood Falls with a second black mana would be detrimental to his deck, since his only double-green is his 7-drop."
lrcast,3b48gv,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:04:50 2015 UTC,"The +1/+1 counter synergies were absurd; Scale Blessing was perfect in here. Looking back, I should have swapped one Ainok Artillerist for a Guardian Shield-Bearer and taken out the blue splash entirely, probably replacing Silumgar Monument and Ojutai's Command for Return to the Earth and another creature. Leaving mana open for Ojutai's Command never paid off, but of course I only played 3 matches.   I do owe some of the wins single-handedly to Ugin. Any 3-0 deck requires luck.  I'm curious what other people think of my build and if you agree with the splash. The argument in my head was 1) Artillerist helped fix colors and gave me counters, 2) the monument gave me blue mana and ramped to Ugin, 3) and Ojutai's Command was good enough to warrant the splash. I recorded the draft if anyone's interested."
lrcast,3b48gv,Malarazz,3,Thu Jun 25 21:11:53 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree with the splash, Ojutai's Command is the second worst command in limited and not at all a good enough card to warrant splashing. It's playable when you're in those colors, sure, but not really something you're gonna be excited about, unlike Silumgar's and Dromoka's.  I really would have preferred a Dromoka Monument here, the ability to turn it into a dragon is a big deal. But you definitely need ramp to play Ugin and you didn't draft a Whisperer of the Wilds, so you gotta go with what you got. You weren't wrong in playing the monument.  You should have really played Abzan Beastmaster though. Card is a bomb. It doesn't need the Archer's Parapets and Rotting Mastodons toughness archetype from KTK to be maindeck material."

That's valid. I think the charger overall is a better finisher overall (evasion, relevant body with a relevant ability) for that deck, but the guildmage is obviously bonkers in the tokens decks. Given that mana is never really an issue in this set I think the pick comes down to color/archetype preference."
lrcast,3b34bp,Carribi,2,Thu Jun 25 17:26:06 2015 UTC,"I actually think the Guildmage is a better finisher in the 5cc decks.  It can have a profound effect on the early game, and it gums up the board fast.  Unless you're being pressured by fliers, I would love to have the Guildmage.  It is vulnerable to more removal though, and the Hellkite Charger basically deals 15 to your opponent, assuming you untap with it.  Given that the Guildmage is more flexible, I think it's the pick here, but it is fairly close."
lrcast,3b34bp,darrenoc,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:13:21 2015 UTC,I remember Neal Oliver had this exact pick on-stream and he took the Hellkite Charger. Pretty sure he said afterward it was the wrong pick though: G/x tokens is so good and red is just OK.
lrcast,3b34bp,Mtgtrumpetman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:19:39 2015 UTC,"Oh that's cool that Neil had the same pick. Yeah I think it basically comes down to power vs. flexibility. Guildmage is clearly very flexible; at its best in GW tokens but also great in ramp. As others have pointed out, Charger is really only great in Ramp. Six mana is kind of too much for an aggro deck, although you'll still play it. Still, I think there's a significant power gap between the cards. Charger hits for 5 the turn it comes into play and often represents lethal the next turn. Guildmage is great, but for me it's a definite notch down in power."
lrcast,3b34bp,gregariousbarbarian,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:08:30 2015 UTC,I think there was a time when guildmage was the pick but the meta has shifted to where everyone is trying to draft tokens now.

Arrest is great removal, but it can only take out one thing, whereas spikeshot has the potential to pick off several targets (myrs) and dominate games.  P1P02 I prefer Silver Myr over committing to a random tripple-green 7 drop that is even not guaranteeing victory.  P1P03 I prefer Iron Myr over Joiner, because I am still open in my choice of color. Also, Myrs help sunburst. (I am not sure in how far Tree of Tales could be the right pick.)  P1P04 I prefer Viridian Longbow because it is reusable removal. It also make my myrs better.  P1P05 I am inclined to take Great Furnace over Chromatic Sphere, but I should probably refresh my memory on the affinity/artifact archetype were I to draft this format.  P1P06 I would take the Ancient Den over Hoverguard.  P1P07 I would probably settle on Nim Shrieker over the cantrip spellbomb and the potential card advantage of Moriok Scavengers. Note, that I am not yet faced with a color dilemma.  P1P08 Vulshok Gauntlets have by far the most upside for me with Spikeshot Goblin, but I would prefer equipment with a cheaper equip cost.  (P1P09 Alpha Myr, although I am a sucker for cards like Razor Barrier. P1P10 Slith Bloodletter. P1P11 Dross Prowler. P1P12 Dross Prowler. P1P13 Forge Armor. P1P14 Fists of the Anvil. P1P15 Nim Lasher.)  After pack one I have two great cards in Spikeshot Goblin and Viridian Longbow. I am set up to take advantage of an artifact theme and have a decent setup for sunburst. I also picked up random black playables that I am not married to."

lrcast,3azfd0,thejimmyst,22,Wed Jun 24 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that the vanilla test needs updating, I just believe it is environment-specific. For instance, a 3 mana 2/3 with no ability was perfectly reasonable in M15 (Witch's Familiar). I also think Grizzly Bears don't need relevant upside to be playable. Even KTK's maligned Smoke Teller was acceptable filler.  Edit: I revised my thoughts on this; the vanilla test itself is probably a constant. Will clarify later."

lrcast,3azfd0,KillerPacifist1,16,Thu Jun 25 17:57:44 2015 UTC,"Does a Hill Giant pass the vanilla test?  In the 20 years of Mtg history the answer is yes.  They have printed many 4 mana 3/3s over the years because colors outside of green do not get 3 mana 3/3s.  If you are going to print a red vanilla 3/3 and it isn't going to cost 3, then it has to cost 4.  Would you put a Hill Giant in a MMA2 or a DDF draft deck?  Not unless something went horribly wrong, but that doesn't mean it isn't appropriately costed.    A card that barely passes the vanilla test is a D+.  If black, red, and blue simply cannot have access to a 3 mana 3/3, because it would disrupt the color pie then that means that a 3 mana 2/3 or a 3 mana 3/2 is vanilla for them because a 3 mana vanilla 3/3 would be pushed.    Passing the vanilla test doesn't make something a C.  It is mearly a stepping off point (D+) to start the evaluation of a card before you look at any relevant up or downsides.    Also, a 2 mana 2/2 passes the vanilla test with flying colors and I would give a 2 mana 2/1 a passing grade as well.  M12 was a while ago, but still part of modern magic and I would jam Coral Merfolks in my deck all day in that format.  Goblin Piker is also a serviceable card most of the time he shows up in a draft environment.  If you are telling me that a two mana vanilla 2/2 is a 24th card more often than it makes it in your deck, I am going to have to call shenanigans."
lrcast,3azfd0,bfro,11,Wed Jun 24 20:25:10 2015 UTC,"I disagree with everything you're saying. ""Pass"" doesn't mean ""it's good"". It means, ""it's acceptable"".  A 2/2 for 2 passes the vanilla test in DTK. a 2/3 for 3 as well. You need 2 drops in KTK as it's pretty aggressive, and punishing to 1 toughness creatures, so a 2/2 for 2 is actually a lot better than a 3/1 for 2.   Because people are playing bears, 2/3s for 3 are playable, if unexciting. A 3/3 for 3 is above the curve and these are high picks, and can usually only be found in rare  (blood chin fanatic) or in green. There's one non-rare in the set that can't be blocked stats-wise on turn 3 by a 2/3. (The 3/3 counter guy)."

lrcast,3azfd0,sylverfyre,5,Thu Jun 25 16:08:22 2015 UTC,"You're seeing the holes in the vanilla test because you're becoming a better player, and a better critical thinker on mtg. It's a cheap surface test that gets taught to new players, a crutch for evaluation once a new set comes out. Once you get a feel for the format, the vanilla test is kaput.  Here's some quick context on each of your examples:  Frogmite is bad because you can't play it on turn 2, which is overwhelmingly the most important part of a bear. Also, MM2's format was ridiculously powerful.  Color matters. White bears haven't been considered good in close to a decade. They're given above-par early game because their high-curve stuff is bad. On the other hand, blue and red have never gotten a straight bear, and on more than one occasion they've played 2 mana 2/1's (e.g. Wetland Sambar). Heck, I've shamelessly run Smoldering Efreet.  Timberpack Wolf was marginalized because there were better 2 drops (Deadly Recluse and Elvish Visionary (bring back my Roaring Primadox deck WotC)). You only wanted them if you were playing aggressive, in which case you wanted all of them.  As for the DTK stuff, I probably wouldn't treat Kolaghan Skirmisher any different if he was a vanilla. I still pick him at the same place, I still run him in the same decks (alongside Smoldering Efreet)."
lrcast,3azfd0,bearrosaurus,3,Wed Jun 24 22:11:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think thinking about it in a 'pass/fail' sense is terribly useful. I think the point is to just think about what the creature is sans-abilities when evaluating. How good a 2/3 for 3, a 2/2 for 2, a 3/3 for 4, etc is going to vary depending on the set, what colors you are in, and what your deck needs.   In green and white, we usually see better things that a 2/2 for 2 these days, even at common. However in other colors 2/2s for 2 at common often come with a drawback."
lrcast,3azfd0,cferejohn,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:42:00 2015 UTC,"The vanilla test is mostly there to tell us how important we want the stuff in the rules text to be.  At 3/2 for 3B, we want it to be pretty good because that's a pretty anemic vanilla test (albeit not a colossal failure)"

lrcast,3azfd0,cferejohn,3,Fri Jun 26 01:47:03 2015 UTC,"The vanilla test isn't to tell you a card is good, it's that its baseline might be playable. So if it's a 2/3 for 3 then it might make the cut as your 22nd 23rd card unless you need more 3. What the vanilla test tells you is that cards that don't pass have to have a great ability to be playable. Your priorities on cards during a draft shift based on curve. If it's halfway through pack 3 and have no 3 drops sibsig icebreakers is def in the team. Alternatively I might open a bear with upside, which is better then some bears already in my deck but I have no 4s and there's a hill giant in the pack I might take it because I want something bigger.  The vanilla test is one of your tools to get fast reads on cards, it tells you a creatures worst case scenario and that's it."

lrcast,3azfd0,sylverfyre,3,Fri Jun 26 01:48:29 2015 UTC,"I think there's 2 kinds of vanilla test: the rough, historical test and the set-specific test.  The historical test is the one we all know. It ignores creature abilities or set gimmicks and just says ""What is a power/toughness combination worth?"" A 2/2 for 3 isn't ""unplayable"", but the test implies that this creature costs more than a vanilla 2/2 should, so you should seek a reason to pay that extra mana. Likewise, Gurmag Angler is terrible at 5/5 for 7, but its upside is you can use Delve to reliably pay 5 or less, which is very good.  The set-specific test is the one that makes you believe the vanilla test is out of date. This vanilla test takes parameters of the Limited environment into account. A 2/2 for 3 isn't very good, but in KTK you were playing morphs left and right. This bumped the value of a 2/3 beyond what it would've been in other sets. The presence of Throttle made x/4 creatures a little riskier than x/5s, so you were willing to pay a little more if you needed safety, and so on.  Neither test invalidates the other. Most good creatures are still great in terms of the original vanilla test, even the ones that are overcosted. Consider Sandsteppe Mastodon. At 5GG for a 5/5, it's overcosted, so we should expect an upside. ""Reach, Bolster 5"" is a heck of an upside, you could be getting a 10/10 reach for 7 mana. Consider Sandsteppe Scavenger, 4G for a 2/2. Yuck! That's at least 3 mana too much. What do you get for 3 mana? Bolster 2. That's more than casting a 3-mana Sandcrafter Mage could get you, but wouldn't you rather have a random bear plus a 2/2 Bolster 1 for 5 mana than a 2/2 plus Bolster 2? It failed the inital vanilla test, and the rest of its upsides didn't make up for it."
lrcast,3azfd0,Slypenslyde,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:36:12 2015 UTC,"You said what I was thinking. The vanilla test in its classic incarnation is just saying 'Do this creature's stats meet a baseline for its mana cost to justify playing it on curve?' That's not something that changes much. But just because it's reasonable on curve doesn't mean that you actually want to play it on curve. A 1/1 flier for 1 does technically meet the baseline, but there's no incentive to play a 1 mana creature on curve in Limited. A 2/2 for 2 in Khans meets the baseline, but there wasn't much incentive to play easily-outclassed 2 drops in that format."

lrcast,3azfd0,Talpostal,2,Thu Jun 25 02:12:30 2015 UTC,"It's also fair to mention that morphs played a much bigger role in KTK than they did in DTK; possibly resulting in overvaluing a 2/3 in the set review. In triple Khans and Khans-Khans-Fate, I felt that 2/3's for 3 often more than pulled their wait since they shut down my opponents morphs for a while. In Dragons, turn 3 morph is not nearly as prevalent, and so cards like Graceblade Aristan definitely struggle to make the cut for me."
lrcast,3azfd0,pjkenk2,2,Wed Jun 24 19:36:26 2015 UTC,"I dont agree at all either, you're picking out the best 2 mana 2/2s at lower rarities and saying theyre the bar when theyre actually the top of the bunch. While yes, power creep is hitting common and 2/2s plus upside being a regular occurrence, it doesnt mean that's the minimum standard."
lrcast,3azfd0,JimmyD101,4,Thu Jun 25 05:40:59 2015 UTC,"It's not a question of updating; it's a question of considering the format.  For example, in Theros there were a lot of 2/3s, and they were all pretty underwhelming, even with slight upside, mostly because there weren't a lot of relevant creatures they could eat/trade with. In M15, however, Midnight Guard was much more reasonable, even based on it's stats alone, because there were a lot.of smaller, low toughness crratures.  I also don't think saying a 2/3 fails the vanilla test because Colossians Yearling exists. Green always gets oversized creatures at common. This doesn't mean that we shold measure every 3-drop against Centaur Courser, or every 4-drop against Rumbling Baloth.   I think the bottom line is that the vanilla test doesn't ask whether a creature is good. It asks whether a creature, when cast on curve, will have a relevant body compared to the other cards in play. While the value of certain bodies may vary a little from set to set, the basic creature curve in Magic is pretty much the same now as it was a couple of years ago."
lrcast,3azfd0,CelestialBeekeeper,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:07:10 2015 UTC,"As a note, I feel like part of the reason this is coming up is because we're mostly experienced players looking at a tool that is mainly used for less experienced players (or just to pull ourselves back when we can't see the forest for the trees). We can recognize a set where a 3-mana 2/3 isn't great because you've got too many big things rolling around and relatively few bears, or where a 2-mana 2/2 is almost always on the outside looking in because there's not enoguh of them to enable an aggressive deck or to force you to defend against one.  But I think it takes a lot more evidence than we have to suggest that limited play has, as a rule, shifted away from these baselines of what makes a card worth a card. And I think it's also important to not confuse what makes a card worth a card with what makes a card average. These are two very different concepts."
lrcast,3azfd0,SinibusUSG,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:06:52 2015 UTC,"It's important to consider color and set. In green or white you usually get a 2/2 with upside for 2, so a vanilla bear isn't great. But the upside bears are always playable and sometimes really strong: Ajani's Pridemate, Atarka Beastbreaker, Heir of the Wilds, Oreskos Sun Guide, Vanguard of Brimaz, etc.  In the other colors vanilla bears are more playable, but you don't get them very often. Usually they have some drawback (Fleshmad Steed, Smoldering Efreet, etc.). So they are only really playable in aggressive decks or if the format is generally aggressive. In these colors it's more common to get a 1/3 or 2/1 with upside.  I like to assume a colorless card w/o any text for the vanilla test, and consider what P/T it needs to be reasonable in the 20-23rd card slot. I think that clearly gets you 2/2 for 2, 2/3 for 3, 3/3 for 4, etc. The vanilla test doesn't mean cards that you are excited to play, it just means that the card isn't an embarrassment to your deck."
lrcast,3azfd0,czarandy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:52:14 2015 UTC,"This came up on /r/magicTCG when someone said that bears are ""always playable"" and I pointed out that was definitely not true. I was surprised because I thought it was a common opinion that vanilla 2/2s for 2s in current sets are behind the curve and don't make the cut in normal circumstances.   I suspect the overemphasis on bears is an overreaction from new players ignoring a creature's stats if their abilities aren't good or relevant.   I don't think the vanilla test needs ""updating"" though. It's set specific and the hosts know that. But I agree that Marshall seems to slightly misevaluate bodies."
lrcast,3azfd0,Rhynocerous,6,Wed Jun 24 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"2/2s for 2 are very playable in recent sets. In all of khans block, a 2/2 for 2 was playable. The difference is that they aren't a mainstay; you don't want a deck full of 6 or 7 bears, but a bear on turn 2 is a good play."
lrcast,3azfd0,chimpfunkz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:01:50 2015 UTC,"And they are usually bad at every other point in the game.

lrcast,3azfd0,Rhynocerous,5,Wed Jun 24 20:11:27 2015 UTC,"They are not behind the curve, they are on it. Because aggressive decks exist, you need things like 2-mana 2/2 creatures to have some early game and not find hugely behind on the board against them. You accept that they won't be great topdecks later, but that doesn't make them bad cards. Things like Philosopher and Guide are below-average playables, but they are playables, and often necessities when you don't pick up the better two-drops."

lrcast,3azfd0,SinibusUSG,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:34:22 2015 UTC,I meant DTK. I'd bet vanilla bears are even worse in MM15 but I haven't played the set much. I'm fine with boarding in vanilla 2/2s against the Dash deck.
lrcast,3azfd0,Rhynocerous,2,Wed Jun 24 20:39:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in MM15 definitely, but that's a clear exception to the rule power-level wise which we really shouldn't be using to establish these tools. A vanilla 4-mana 5/5 would be excellent in almost any standard set, for instance, but in a typical MTGO-style Cube something like Deadbridge Goliath is a 14th/15th pick, if it's even in the thing.  As for boarding in vanilla 2/2s against aggressive decks--and this is going on a huge tangent outside the Vanilla Test topic at hand and into more general strategy--I think it makes more sense to start with them in and board them out if they're bad in the matchup in part because I think they serve a solid role in most midrange decks and only are really dead if you're facing a controlling deck and can't really apply pressure with them, but also because of how turn order is decided.  (Like I said, a tangent)  Going first or second is most important when an aggressive deck is involved, but if you're not running those 2-drops, a strong aggro build has a decent shot at winning that first game even if they lose the coin flip. You really, really want that game one win against an aggro deck because, if you don't take that first game, you have to win at least one more game against them when you're on the draw. This is far less of an issue against mid-range/control decks, and the downside to having a couple extra bears in your deck to begin with isn't all that high, so you're basically giving up a little advantage in G1 of your non-aggro matches for, in my opinion, a much better chance to beat a decent aggro deck.  Obviously throw that all out the window if we're talking about an M14 or ROE type set. But that's how I like to play it when aggro makes up its fair share of the metagame as in DTK with Dash or KTK and BNG with their red/white builds."
lrcast,3azfd0,SinibusUSG,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:01:37 2015 UTC,"but in a typical MTGO-style Cube something like Deadbridge Goliath is a 14th/15th pick, if it's even in the thing.   Yeah...in an MTGO Cube, pretty much vanilla 2/2s for 2 are playable, if unexciting (Kami of Ancient Law and Leonin Relic Warder are both important for the crappy white deck, and stuff  like Kiln Fiend is fine, even if the opponent's on no artifacts). There are pretty much no decks that somelike like Deadbridge Goliath -- you either have hyper aggro, ramp, or control - midrange cards like that just tend not to be good unless they're stabilizing your board (even the 4/4 for 4 that gains 4 life is pretty much strictly a sideboard card)."
lrcast,3azfd0,aasdf123,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:48:38 2015 UTC,"Don't quite know if I agree with that--Kami and Relic Warder are pretty poor substitutes for the better white two-drops (except in powered cube, where they are very good thanks to their abilities), and unless you've really missed a signal, it's hard not to pick up enough of those two-drops (Thalia, Precinct Captain, Accorder Paladin, Porcelain Legionaire, so on and so forth) even with just your late picks that you'd really ever even consider a 2-mana 2/2.  But I get where you're coming from in that, if there was an option to add any number of travelling philosophers to your deck at the end of a draft, there are some White Weenie builds that, with the draft having left them with a strange curve, would certainly press that button."
lrcast,3azfd0,SinibusUSG,2,Thu Jun 25 15:21:06 2015 UTC,"you're wrong. In Ktk that was true, but DTK is very aggressive. You can get killed by a guy going 2-3-2 drop + removal/trick.   KTK mostly doesn't have really good cheap removal/tricks to force damage through and tempo your opponent out. That's why bears weren't very good in that format. I actually thought that giant growth would be first pickable in 3x KTK if it was in the set as it's so hard to gain tempo in that format.  DTK is a different format altogether. The format has pacifism at common for crying out loud. Red has three instant speed removal spells at common including one that can dome you for 5. There's times when I get to pack 3 and all I'm looking for, are either whisperer of the wilds or ainok guides."
lrcast,3azfd0,pahamack,5,Thu Jun 25 06:11:42 2015 UTC,"If there is a sufficient volume of 2-mana 2/2s with abilities (other than, say, first strike) that are playable to make you doubt a vanilla bear's playability, then by definition you have an environment where a vanilla bear is playable.  What makes a 2/2 for 2 bad? A format where its body is irrelevant because there's no aggressive decks to either take advantage of it as an on-curve attacker or to pressure other decks into playing them to defend. That's why bears were at their worst in M14.  You look at cards like the life-gaining white bears from today's spoilers and you say ""well this just makes a vanilla 2/2 unplayable,"" but it doesn't. If people are playing 2-mana 2/2s with small upside like that or Herald of Dromoka or whatever, then it's readily apparent that a plain Grizzly Bear is worth a card because it will trade for those cards. Yes, your opponent is up some life in the transaction, but you're not down on cards, and that's the most important thing.  In fact, this is probably where you can find value in the draft. If people are looking at vanilla bears as bad cards and the ones with marginal upside as solid picks, then you can float the lower end of your curve until the last few picks and prioritize other cards that have replacements that aren't nearly so close in quality or quantity., even if it looks like you're overloading on high-end early in the pack."

You look at cards like the life-gaining white bears from today's spoilers and you say ""well this just makes a vanilla 2/2 unplayable,"" but it doesn't.   I'm not saying this. What I'm saying is closer to your point in the last paragraph. They are ""last few picks"" material in these contexts and often aren't making the cut if you can play better bears. I meant they're below the curve of playability, not the vanilla test, I could have used a better phrase there.

lrcast,3azfd0,SinibusUSG,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:49:26 2015 UTC,"it's not the creatures you should be looking at, it's the removal/tricks. If those are cheap enough then, for example, a 3/3 for 4 mana gets tempo'd out when it tries to block a 2/2 when the player with the 2/2 has a giant growth. If on turn 4 the attacker goes attack with 2 bears, giant growth, put a 3/3 in play, then next turn the other player's 5 drop gets doom bladed, that's how you win by tempo and leverage your 2 drops.  Without removal/tricks, all your bears get outclassed by a single 2/3.  This is what happened in KTK. There weren't a lot of cheap tricks/removal, so it was best to go for 18 lands and value. EXCEPT in the bw warriors deck, which also relied on mass pump to attack that format in a totally different axis, which is why it was the best deck in the format. Essentially, the BW warriors deck is a DTK deck in KTK."
lrcast,3azfd0,pahamack,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:48:57 2015 UTC,"Tricks/removal are generally what makes a format slow or fast, but even in a slow format there's usually a fast deck available, and it's usually the result of the volume of aggressive creatures available just because mediocre tricks are usually still enough (and always available) if you're just capable of curving out on the opponent, to say nothing of the fact that you're presupposing a single 2/3 which really depends on the volume/type of creatures available.  Again, I'll go to M14 for my example since that format was extraordinarily slow. That set had Doom Blade at uncommon, Quag Sickness as Common, Giant Growth at common, Shock at common, Flames of the Firebrand at uncommon, and Pacifism at common. Hunt the Weak and Chandra's Outrage at common too, up at 4 CMC, along with Briarpack Alpha at common, which is basically your perfect Giant Growth + 3/3 play stapled on one card. A thing of beauty.  What it lacked was strong creatures who could really capitalize on your ability to clear the way. Hill Giants were entirely playable in the format simply because there wasn't much better. In KTK there were absolutely aggressive decks available outside of B/W. R/W in particular shone through as a deck that looked incredibly janky in terms of card quality but won because you would curve out with mediocre cards like Valley Dasher and Leaping Master (and better ones like War Name Aspirant and Horde Ambusher) while your opponent waits and drops their 2/2 for 3 on two. Sure, if they dropped that single 2/3, you had to find a way around it. But importantly you were a lot more likely to have an aggressive opening with a couple aggressive cards than they were to play one of the four different 2/3s (three of them uncommon) for 3 or less in the whole damn set."
lrcast,3azfd0,SinibusUSG,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:16:09 2015 UTC,"(briarpack alpha is uncommon. that thing would completely screw the format at common)  I guess you're right. The important things are weenie quality, removal/tricks, and how good the blockers are.  I just find it funny that KTK is going to go down as one of the most loved draft formats,  even though it is purposefully low in power level. It feels powerful, but, if you think about it, there's so many DTK commons I would pick over the best KTK commons (debilitating injury and savage punch). I've actually first picked a feat of resistance in that set, I can't imagine a DTK p1p1 that bad.   This purposeful ramping up in power level is demonstrated quite clearly in throttle vs flatten: the exact same spell in the same rarity yet the khans version costs one mana more.   The convergence of a lack of a lot of good weenies, expensive common removal, lack of good tricks (especially 1 mana ones), and great early blockers like archer's parapet makes for a format hostile to vanilla bears. You can't kill them before they get to 5 mana and start flipping morphs, whereupon your 2/2s are just outclassed."
lrcast,3ay5uv,derelict5432,23,Wed Jun 24 13:14:29 2015 UTC,"I felt like his advice was aimed perhaps more at a higher level of player than the show aims towards. That's the only way I could explain his seemingly odd advice.  Maybe while the show teaches us the rules, his advice was aimed towards the players who are at the point where they know when to break said rules and apply his off-the-wall tactics. I don't know, that's just how I saw it."
lrcast,3ay5uv,BUfels,22,Wed Jun 24 14:07:13 2015 UTC,"I agree that his advice was aimed at experienced drafters. He's talking to someone who he's assuming is already good at drafting a consistent deck and playing the deck to accomplish its objectives.  What he's saying to that player is: dial it back. Recognize that you have two goals, not one. Yes, you want to accomplish your objectives. But you also want to stop your opponent from accomplishing theirs. Try not to get tunnel vision where you're planning three turns ahead on your side of the board, but haven't given enough thought to your opponent's long-term objectives.  This is how I took his advice, at least. I'm clearly in the minority, but I felt like this was one of the bigger ""level up"" episodes for me recently."
lrcast,3ay5uv,bitterrootmtg,5,Wed Jun 24 16:11:18 2015 UTC,"I also found this to be a pretty big level up episode for me.  I understand that this show may not be the best place for the theoretical aspects of draft, but it helped me a lot.  I would love to hear more shows like this every once in a while."
lrcast,3ay5uv,Carribi,5,Wed Jun 24 18:03:10 2015 UTC,"That is a great breakdown. I think OPs issue partially has to do with how unclear these points were made. I found it confusing and if I were even the magic player I was 6 months ago this would not have been a productive or helpful episode for me. So yeah, maybe it's a higher level episode with points that are so esoteric it obscure that it's difficult to properly articulate."
lrcast,3ay5uv,ErasmusFenris,3,Wed Jun 24 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with this completely. While most of the podcast episodes are dedicated at teaching people the fundamentals of drafting, deckbuilding, and playing limited magic, this episode felt like it would be more useful to folks either already on higher rungs of the competitive scene or somewhere close to it. That's not a bad thing at all, and even for scrubs like me, it's interesting and useful to peer into the mindset of a very high caliber player, even if I don't think I could use much of the advice he was dishing out, as I just wouldn't know when and where to apply it.  I think he should have spent less time with abstract concepts like ""pressing objectives"" or ""stop your opponent from pressing their objectives"", and spent more time on concrete examples with either real cards or simplified make-believe cards. It was hard to follow what he meant when he spoke purely in abstract terms, because as a listener you could interpret what he was saying to mean something completely different. I wish he would've introduced his concepts quickly, and then spent the bulk of his time laying out examples to explain them."
lrcast,3ay5uv,PlatypusPlatoon,11,Wed Jun 24 20:09:16 2015 UTC,"My stance on LR has always been to be open-minded about other opinions. Chris had some ideas that didn't line up with how we approach these things on LR, but that doesn't mean that they don't work for him or that we shouldn't listen.   I do agree that some of his advice hit a little higher than our normal demographic, but I'm ok with that. We have high level pros on sometimes for discussions like that, and we also go over the fundamentals of card evaluation or thought processes sometimes too. It's good to keep some variety there.  I also want to say that I think it's great that this kind of stuff gets discussed here in such depth (and without people being jerks)."
lrcast,3ay5uv,Marshall_LR,20,Wed Jun 24 23:45:19 2015 UTC,"I think Chris is clearly good, but I don't feel like he was successful in explaining why he does what he does. It was interesting seeing where he was coming from, and I can tell you from experience that it's difficult to explain this sort of thing (I've gone through tons of trial and error in attempting to do so). Distilling your whole process, especially the intuitive part, into something with firm takeaways is tough, and given that Chris has just started to enter that arena (with articles and now this episode), it's something I'd expect him to get better at over time."
lrcast,3ay5uv,LSV__,8,Wed Jun 24 15:14:44 2015 UTC,"To be clear: there is useful information here, and I agree with Chris on disrupting the opponent's plan/treating games as a battle over objectives (though I disagree strongly about hatedrafting), but I can see how it's hard to get a solid takeaway from what we discussed."
lrcast,3ay5uv,LSV__,7,Wed Jun 24 15:24:45 2015 UTC,"What I took away on the hate drafting discussion with  Chris was - this is all done in context, so don't make absolutes - it typically is done when the hate draft card is strong (against his deck) and the card that fits best in his deck is mediocre at best - he expects that there will be redundant playable cards in the end, so he's willing to settle for a slightly weaker filler card in order to enable the hate - he will prioritize the hate if it is against a cornerstone strategy for his deck - he is playing to go 3-0 in the pod because that is needed for spiking the tournament, so he is planning to face against the best deck and doesn't want them to have the best cards against him - he does it more than dictated by conventional wisdom    I enjoyed the discussion and did get a lot from it. I think challenging conventional wisdom has a place. I find I often end up with a bunch of excess filler cards, and in 20-20 hindsight those picks could have been used to erode my opponents' decks.    I also have had a tendency (now I will actively try not to) to develop a tunnel vision where I'm just looking for what strengthens my deck and don't necessarily balance it against what attacks my deck.    I think Chris is exceptional at tracking picks and passes, and is able to operate at a very high level in tracking the context of what is happening in the draft. I consider myself limited in those skills now, but I would certainly look for advice on developing the mental tools for tracking that many cards. I'm definitely a stronger drafter on MTGO vs Paper because I can see all my picks and build my deck on the fly while I draft. In paper drafts, I often find myself trying to recall how many 2 and 3 drop creatures I've gotten once I find my lane.    Overall, I enjoyed the conversation discussion with Chris and it provoked some thought."
lrcast,3ay5uv,Agog1,5,Wed Jun 24 16:32:01 2015 UTC,"What I understood from the ""treating games as a battle over objectives,"" was that a lot of players focus too much on what is going on on their side of the board.  If you focus on what your opponents are doing and WHY they are doing what they are doing then you may get a better understanding of which course will lead you to victory in the game.  For example: if you're trying to figure out who the beat-down is, maybe your hand looks like you're the beatdown. But maybe your opponent has Mob Rule or something like that in their hand. If you play like the game is a race when your opponent has Mob Rule in their hand you are probably going to lose. If you focus on the decisions your opponents are making and can intuit their game plan, then you will be able to decide your path to victory in a much better way.  Maybe I interpolated too much, but this was what I understood him to be saying."
lrcast,3ay5uv,zvazda,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:21:27 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I took from it. It was a new and really interesting perspective for me and it's given me another way to look at games every time I play limited.   I'd enjoy hearing more from Chris in the future, I think he could be a very insightful contributor."
lrcast,3ay5uv,Darkside-,3,Wed Jun 24 23:53:04 2015 UTC,"there's one thing that I think was implied but not explicitly stated through Chris' comments that could be an easier take-away for most LR listeners and is something that I think most tend to do incorrectly   that thing is that when you're pretty clearly in a 2-color pair late in pack 1, and you get to the last few picks where there's nothing for your deck, players tend to either take picks in their colours that are unplayable or else the best card from the pack, and I think that's often wrong... if there's a decent card in colours you're not in, leave it there to solidify your neighbour in a colour you're not  the reason I took this away from what Chris was saying even though he didn't come out and say it is because we was talking about making picks with the full context of the draft that you are currently in as opposed to relying too heavily on raw card evaluation, which is something I think a lot of us do too much"
lrcast,3ay5uv,tmurdock,2,Wed Jun 24 21:24:08 2015 UTC,How was it for you guys to have a guest on the show who you clearly respect telling your listeners to do a bunch of things you normally advocate against?  I know his advice may have had merit for higher level players but was it awkward at all?
lrcast,3ay5uv,horsekateer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:56:24 2015 UTC,From a pro perspective it's much better to be known as the guy who never hate drafts than the one who always hate drafts. You reap what you sow.

lrcast,3ay5uv,Mediocritologist,3,Wed Jun 24 16:34:37 2015 UTC,"I think this is the main point. He had a lot of great ideas, and I got a lot out of the episode, more than I get out of most episodes. But a lot of the things that Chris does are sort of intuitive, and he had a hard time breaking those down in ways that you can pick apart and dissect. That's fine, and I've been playing around with a lot of the ideas that he put forward, but it's not the kind of thing that translates as easily through an audio medium."
lrcast,3ay5uv,oraymw,10,Thu Jun 25 01:40:58 2015 UTC,"I was confused about Fennell's strange advice until they mentioned it was likely due to his experience with Team Drafting, which is wildly different than regular drafting. He put a lot of emphasis on things usually condemned by the show, such as:   Hatedrafting Sending signals to your left (rather than trying to read signals)   It's not great advice for a regular draft pod, but it can work for Team. Also, it flies in the face of much of LR's core advice, which is usually dedicated to new and developing players. Emphasis is put on debunking hatedrafting and ""sending signals,"" because these things are common traps that new players often fall into and misevaluate.  It also might be advice skewed toward the pro meta, where there is a stronger consensus on card evaluation. This can maybe help you hatedraft effectively, wheel cards in certain archetypes, or ""put"" players into colors. But that's not the case in some random MTGO pod or FNM, where it's impossible to tell another player's card evaluations and skill level. So, as Brian Wong was particularly adamant about-- a lot of it is just not great advice for the regular player.  I mean, think of it this way, is your meta made of LSV, Efro, Jensen, Turtenwald, Duke, etc. etc. etc. ? If it were, I think you might end up developing different draft strategies since a certain level of world-renowned competence is a given. And those strategies... might not apply to the average MTG player.  It was definitely an awesome episode to get that point of view though."
lrcast,3ay5uv,sylverfyre,3,Wed Jun 24 13:39:08 2015 UTC,"Well remember that one of the things about paying attention to the signals you're sending isn't so that you're making a decision, but knowing how it affects future decisions.    For example, Taking Comet Storm but passing Nameless inversion (and then passing more black cards afterwards) is totally correct, but it does mean that in late pack 1, if I think I'm not in the right colors, I might not want to take the Thief of Hope thinking that spirits is ""open"" because while it might be open from my left, if I'm getting into an archetype this late in the pack I will be relying on Pack 2 and I'm pretty sure the guy on my right will be snapping up the good cards early.  What Chris Fennell is saying isnt to change your picks to pass a ""better signal"" but rather to pay attention to the signals you sent because you'll want to have that information when you have a decision to make on switching into a different archetype."
lrcast,3ay5uv,sylverfyre,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:49:08 2015 UTC,"I mean, sure. But he put a lot of emphasis on what you pass, which should be a tertiary decision-maker at best. Certainly it's a thing to keep in mind, to use as a tie-breaker, but in general it's not solid advice to be the draft strategy. You cannot know what your left-hand opponent will play, especially outside of Pro Top 8s."
lrcast,3ay5uv,universe34,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:20:28 2015 UTC,"You're still going back to using ""what did i pass"" as influencing what you should pick out of a pack.  That's not how Chris was using it in the  episode.  He was talking about passing a good card but being aware of it so that he knows that the color of the good cards he's passing is likely not somewhere he wants to end up if he has to switch colors late in pack 1 or even at the start of pack 2.  (If you switch early rather than late, its fine.)  He's talking about ""know what options are open for switching colors"" which is important beyond just being aware of what's open.  It's information you will need so that you know where to go when you determine that Red is not open despite you getting a 2nd pick Roast into 3rd pick Sarkhan's Rage."
lrcast,3ay5uv,Slypenslyde,3,Thu Jun 25 16:03:33 2015 UTC,I buy this explanation. Chris Fennell is associated with Plus EV games (in some way) where I play and team drafting is a huge part of the culture there. I wouldn't be surprised at all if most of Fennell's paper drafting was in team draft form.
lrcast,3ay5uv,Malarazz,4,Wed Jun 24 15:37:15 2015 UTC,"I think this hits it on the head.  In normal drafting, you're only 1/6 or 1/8 odds of facing an opponent with a card you pass, and also facing ""Will they draw it?"" In team drafting, you know exactly who you will face. If you know your opponent is sitting to your left, and you pass powerful cards in the same color to your left, it seems reasonable to say you're hurting your win percentage by taking some replacement-level card instead.  The ""pro meta"" argument's one I've detected as well. There's a lot of cards in each set that are LRCast unplayables but tend to show up in the decks that win my FNM drafts. We've got a mix of novices and grinders, and sometimes the things I get passed late mystify me."
lrcast,3ay5uv,Greyfeld,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:20:43 2015 UTC,There's a lot of cards in each set that are LRCast unplayables but tend to show up in the decks that win my FNM drafts   Can you expand on that? Are you talking about cards like Rakshasa's Disdain or something? I don't think I've ever seen anything like this in the 3-0 decks at my LGS.
lrcast,3ay5uv,Slypenslyde,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:47:38 2015 UTC,"Can you expand on that? Are you talking about cards like Rakshasa's Disdain or something? I don't think I've ever seen anything like this in the 3-0 decks at my LGS.   See, I never understood the hate for Rakshasa's Disdain.  In most decks, it's just not very good.  But in a UB exploit deck, it's like a super Mana Leak.    Since nobody else ever drafts it, you can wheel them around all day and end up with a fistful of them that everybody else passed up.  And since they're in the last pack of the draft, it gives you plenty of time to see where your deck ends up, archetype-wise, before deciding to blow a card pick on them or not."
lrcast,3ay5uv,beepbloopbloop,0,Wed Jun 24 20:13:11 2015 UTC,"I don't have a lot of details to back it up because it's been a while, but I remember seeing a ton of Molting Snakeskin in KTK drafts when Marshall continuously panned it as unplayable. It rarely showed up in any matches I watched streaming, but I sure saw it glommed on to Sagu Maulers and various other threats. Dragons has been more ""Some cards do very well if you happen to draft the deck they require."" when I see an unplayable rise to the top.  My local FNMs lately are weird as heck because the grinders are playing MM2 or chaos drafts. The people that stick to DTK tend to be me, novice drafters, and a couple of experienced people that figured out they can win every week since the difficult players are in the other pods. If that's the case, and inexperienced people are playing mostly inexperienced people, then in my local meta it'd make sense to see more ""bad picks"" and get surprised by them."
lrcast,3ay5uv,Rad_Elemental_Blast,6,Wed Jun 24 17:18:20 2015 UTC,"I think it wasn't exactly clarified what he meant by shutting down your opponents strategies. I don't think it means you should be reactive at all - rather, it's similar to the idea of having a plan. You should be proactively shutting down avenues by which your opponent can win. It's a little higher level than most of the show's content, as it goes beyond understanding what your deck is trying to do and requires understanding of how your deck interacts with your opponent's."
lrcast,3ay5uv,seekerdarksteel,6,Wed Jun 24 14:36:05 2015 UTC,"He didn't really say much that goes against what normal strategies are for limited. He just talked about it on such a theoretical level that it's difficult to apply his ideas to past experience if you don't have as much play experience as he's had. What I got from it is this:  If you have an opportunity to make a game decision that hinders your opponent's overall game plan, choose to take that action over one that exclusively progresses your own plan. That doesn't necessarily mean to be reactive in the conventional sense. It just means that you need to be aware of what your opponent is trying to do--what resources they're trying to leverage--and be aware of how to mitigate their leverage by pushing your own with a different resource. It's super vague.   And then the point for hate drafting I understood to mean this: At high level events where you have to win the pod in order for your deck to mean anything, it's sometimes the higher EV pick to remove an unbeatable card from the pool than to pick a replacement-level card for your own deck."
lrcast,3ay5uv,Jovh,5,Wed Jun 24 15:31:32 2015 UTC,"I didn't interpret it as him suggesting that you should be reactive.  I interpreted it as him suggesting that you should try to read what your opponent's goals are and try to oppose those goals rather than trying to set your own goals in a vacuum.  E.g. if your opponent is trying to be very aggressive, then you try to slow the game down and protect your life total.  But if your opponent is trying to slow the game down, then you should try to be more aggressive.  If your opponent seems to be protecting a particular creature more than you'd expect, then you should consider killing it more than you otherwise would (since your opponent clearly has a goal with it).  If your opponent is trying to be controlley and reactive, then you should try to be proactive and put them in a position where they can't be reactive. Opposing your opponent's goals may very well require you to be even more proactive than you otherwise would be."
lrcast,3ay5uv,SmallFryHero,6,Wed Jun 24 15:52:17 2015 UTC,"The way in which I interpreted the whole stopping your opponents objectives thing I don't believe was a call to being a reactive strategy but rather attempting to ascertain what your opponent needs to do to win. Are they the beat down? Are they trying to stem my aggression if so why? In games two and three are they just trying to curve out or are they building towards a big bomb card? If they are trying to beat down slow them down, if they are trying to slow you down speed up. If you can read the Ugin they've got sitting in hand on 7 lands maybe hold up countermagic. He is advocating that once you know what your opponent wants to do the easiest way to win is to simply stop it because if you can stop your opponents plan while advancing yours your opponent has wasted resources in attempting this course of action, and as such they are down on resources."
lrcast,3ay5uv,pahamack,5,Wed Jun 24 16:09:31 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest error Chris made was pronouncing niche ""nitch"" once and ""neesh"" once. Both are fine, like beta lightning bolts or full art lightning bolts, but you can't mix and match."
lrcast,3ay5uv,taho_teg,2,Thu Jun 25 00:55:44 2015 UTC,"The thing about keeping track of what you're passing is such a good point though. This is VERY relevant. Yes, you are receiving two packs from the right. But, there is a point where you've passed so much of a certain colour to your left that you can't fight that guy for it anymore, because, let's say you've passed 3/4 of  a pack's worth of good green cards to that person, you're the one losing out because you're losing out on 1.75 packs by now. He's gonna fight you over that green.  It's even worse specifically with green in DTK because green is very bad in the last pack.  I'm now extra aware of this because of that episode. Now, this doesn't mean switching colours late is always a bad move. I've seen pack 1s where I see no exciting green cards until a pick 9 epic confrontation. Since I haven't passed any, it's correct to move in."
lrcast,3ay5uv,czarandy,2,Wed Jun 24 17:18:57 2015 UTC,"One thing I like to do with folks between matches is to trade decks and play against my own deck. Some cards are harder to evaluate, not because they help you, but they hurt your opponent. If I play against my deck and a card or situation is really annoying, I know that it may be better than I thought before. A good example is discard. You get no immediate benefit from having your opponent discard, but it can feel so brutal when it is done to you.  One card that demonstrates this is Consult the Necrosages. Many times I have played against it and while the opponent casts it I think ""this is it, the game is over if I have to discard these"" but then he draws cards instead! I make the same mistake when I cast it, thinking I'll draw some sweet cards when the discard is actually better.   I think it goes into the metagame a bit too. A beatdown deck may be terrible on defense, so make your deck capable of an aggressive start, or keep them off balance as best you can."
lrcast,3ay5uv,aDubiousNotion,2,Wed Jun 24 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"I actually think his advice was really solid, although he didn't explain it very well. The idea is that you need to pay attention to what your opponent is doing because it reveals to you their plan and what cards they have in their hand and deck. If your opponent is trying to throw away creatures for damage they probably either have a lot of burn or threaten/falter effects. If they are making seemingly unfavorable trades they probably have some late game they want to get towards, or a sweeper. These are simple examples, but in general your opponent has a plan and identifying what it is should guide your actions. It doesn't mean playing the control role necessarily; it could mean playing more aggressively instead if you get the sense that your opponent has some crazy late game. This can also matter a lot in sideboarding unusual cards (e.g., fogs/lifegain are sometimes good against threaten or falter effects.)  Of course this is more applicable at higher levels of competition (GP/PT) than random FNMs. It's a wholly different skillset to play against people employing the ""bear on a bicycle"" strategy ;)."

I always enjoy the level up shows, but this is the first one where I've really felt I learned things I hadn't thought about much before.  Since I see a lot of people weren't crazy about this I wanted to make sure to say that some of us did, and I'd really like to see Chris come back again."
lrcast,3az4sv,MooiTie,5,Wed Jun 24 17:45:27 2015 UTC,"I think that one of the arguments against a ""mulligan"" episode might be that the mulligan decision has been discussed in some of the more recent episodes (recent for me meaning last year), specifically the one where LSV talks about having a plan, and in the end, having a plan is basically what you look at when looking at a hand.   Your opening hand should have a plan, and that's something that applies to all formats. If you keep 2 lands plus 5 drops, that's setting yourself up for failure since you need to draw consecutive lands to do anything. Similarly, this should be your thought process for keeping a hand; Does this hand do anything.   Having typed this out, I realize that it could very well be a good LR episode. Similar to how the 2 for 1 special laid out how to evaluate card advantage. Giving people examples and then talk through the decision process for keep or mull."

I frequently come away from a match shaking my head and wondering if it was the right or wrong decision to mulligan (and how many times) or not.     When you have a 6 land first hand, no lands in your second hand, what are you looking for in that mull to 5 hand?  Under what parameters do you mull to 4?  Do you mulligan until you have a 2 or 3 drop and the proper lands to play it? If so, then you have to set a hard and fast rule of never mull'ing past 4. Is that a rule you want to establish? As I recall from the old mulligan episode, the only real mulligan rule was not to set any mulligan rules..."

The only time I'm willing to mull to 4 is when I need an absolutely perfect draw to play anything before turn 4.  If my 5-card hand looks like I can reasonably expect to drop something on turn 2 or 3, then I'll keep it.   Do you mulligan until you have a 2 or 3 drop and the proper lands to play it? If so, then you have to set a hard and fast rule of never mull'ing past 4. Is that a rule you want to establish? As I recall from the old mulligan episode, the only real mulligan rule was not to set any mulligan rules...   My standards are pretty extreme for that mull to 4, because I feel that that's the point where you've basically lost the ability to win, even on the draw, without your opponent just running into a ridiculously large pocket of land on the top of their deck.  Unlike constructed decks, there typically is no ""miracle draw"" that will let you overcome a 3+ card deficit in draft.  Sure you could say, ""never say no to a mull,"" but you have to have a limit.  Mulling from 7 to 6 can easily be done to fish for a faster start, but every mull you make after that is drastically reducing your ability to respond to your opponent's plays, regardless of what your first hand looks like.  Obviously, you need to be flexible and make decisions based on what you know about your opponent's deck and your own, so circumstances can vary wildly between matches, let alone between drafts.  But I think it's dangerous to hold onto this idea that you should freely mull away half your opening hand, just because you didn't get the exact amount of mana you were hoping for."

It was ALWAYS correct to sac-with-damage-on-stack.  Now there are many more decision points and I think in the end it makes for a more interesting game, even if it did obsolete or semi-obsolete some cards.  I prefer the decision point of ""do i want to sac this and get the effect, or do the combat damage?"" and it also lets them put more powerful sac-this abilities on cards.  (Or exile-this abilities, e.g. [[Aetherling]] and its apparent massive power upgrade from Morphling.)"

lrcast,3ayha9,Malarazz,2,Wed Jun 24 14:51:53 2015 UTC,"Nothing exciting today, just a bunch of junk rares.  Personally I think Jake is overvaluing Day's Undoing and Flameshadow Conjuring.  The former seems practically unplayable. It just seems really hard and inconsistent to somehow get the fast start you need to make that card a blowout (or even just value), especially since your opponents will get to play their new threats before you.  As for the latter, he compares Conjuring to Outpost Siege, but I don't find that relevant. Outpost Siege is card advantage that you don't need to work towards. With Conjuring you need to take a turn off from developing your board like with Outpost Siege. But then you also have to cast a creature that has power greater than or equal to the toughness of every creature in the opponent's board, just so you can hit him for X damage. And then you need to do that again next turn.   It seems like a good, maybe even a great card when you're ahead, but miserable when you're behind. And I don't find such a swingy card like that can be called a B. I'd much rather first pick a Death Wind than a Berserker's Onslaught.  Personally I'd rate these rares C- and C+, respectively."
lrcast,3ayha9,shinianx,2,Wed Jun 24 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"I could see playing the Conjuring in the format's RG deck. Adding a single R kicker to get you a hasty, expendable monster to just hurl at your opponent seems fine, and sometimes it's going to really throw off his blocking math. I'm more interested in its constructed applications, because that card seems like it could lead to some pretty degenerate plays if you had the right ETB effects."
lrcast,3ayha9,shinianx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:10:08 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought about ETB effects. ETB effects make Mirror Mockery go from a shitty removal spell to a powerful tempo play (Sidisi's Faithful with MM like I did in a FNM one day), or a straight up bomb (Raksasha's Gravecaller with MM that someone used to beat me in an 8-4 MTGO final).  I checked the cards spoiled so far and out of the 53 of them there are only 2 ETB effects that can combo with Conjuring, both fairly mediocre.  A blue card at uncommon that lets you look at 2 cards and put one in your hand and one in the graveyard, and a black card at common that gives target creature -1/-1 (i.e. it will trigger twice giving -2/-2 instead).  So yeah, better look for synergies in constructed because limited isn't looking very promising."
lrcast,3ayha9,SirChuffly,2,Wed Jun 24 15:33:08 2015 UTC,"Red and Green have both been seeing their share of low CMC glass cannons, like Gore Swine, Ainok Artillerist, and Alpine Grizzly lately; those would be just as acceptable too, though ideally you'd want something like Atarka Efreet, since 5 power is almost certainly going to take something down. I see paying a single R to get a free attack while still leaving behind a blocker as a pretty good deal. Also, it's not very pertinent to Limited, but the card has the same trigger template as Kiki-Jiki; the creature token is removed from the game at the beginning of the next end step. If you have a Flash creature, or a way to put a creature into play at instant speed, you can do so during your opponent's end step and the token will stick around all through your next turn. The wording doesn't even require that you CAST the creature, just that it's non-token, and that it entered play. An ETB-centric deck would get double the mileage out of its Flicker effects."
lrcast,3ayha9,SinibusUSG,2,Wed Jun 24 16:11:38 2015 UTC,"The former seems practically unplayable  C-   I don't think your commentary and rating on Day's Undoing match at all! Personally, I think it's nigh unplayable. It's very rare that you dump your hand so significantly faster than your opponent that you're going to get significant card advantage. Maybe a sideboard deck against someone slow with lots of card draw? Maybe? I think it's pretty much D- territory, honestly, though I may be proved wrong.  I also don't love conjuring. You need to run this card, then draw big, beefy creatures. How good or bad it is depends on the format; if you get to play a lot of high power (but weak in other ways?) creatures, this does have a fair amount of power in suitably agressive decks. I don't think it's unplayable. Maybe there's upside with evasive creatures?  But in your typical midrangey deck, it's too often a 'do nothing' or 'deal x damage' type card, which isn't really enough. I find it hard to rate this card in a vacuum so I'd plump for the slightly uninformative ""C"", even though in some games it's going to feel like a bomb."

So far in Red we've seen a 4/4 for 5 at uncommon and a 6/4 for 6 at common, so it's possible."
lrcast,3ayha9,SinibusUSG,2,Wed Jun 24 15:24:58 2015 UTC,"Completely agree on both arguments, though I'd give both a lower rating. While it's not as bad as most symmetrical effects since it erases the card advantage aspect, it's really hard to find a deck where it really does much, and the fact that it's in a typically slower color like blue makes it particularly hard to imagine this having much of a home.  As for the Flameshadow Conjuring, you also have to consider the mana needed. So you take T4 off to cast your enchantment, and on T5 you can attack in with a 4-drop assuming you draw a land and have the requisite creature. On T6 you attack in with a 5-drop. It's almost as if...you had just cast those cards on-curve without investing in this stupid enchantment!  Granted, if your opponent can't just eat said tokens (though they'll have an extra turn of development to set themselves up to do so) then they'll have to take some damage. But this card is actually at odds with the deck it wants to be in. It's a huge tempo hit to start that can only be recouped with an ideal sequence, and at best ends up trading card advantage for damage. That's the sort of thing that you want out of an aggressive deck that craves said tempo.  If you can find a way to sacrifice them profitably, sure. Otherwise? Nope."
lrcast,3ayha9,SinibusUSG,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:23:23 2015 UTC,"I think writing a set review is, at this point, largely premature (especially when it comes to things like common vanillas that can range from unplayable to premium depending on the format).  But I think people are looking at Day's Undoing wrong, with regards to Limited. It seems best in a controlling deck with a lot of cards that do a lot (Bombs, premium removal, and especially cards that affect the board while generating card advantage).  The idea being not that you dump your hand then refill with a Timetwister, but that you are taking the game to parity, then you cast as many spells as you can and finish with Day's Undoing, on the assumption that your new 7 will be better than the opponent's 7 in the late game. In that way, to me it looks like a replacement level card in those decks."
lrcast,3ayha9,Sceptilesolar,2,Thu Jun 25 00:10:15 2015 UTC,"Really don't see how Mizzium Meddler and Bounding Krasis have the same grade. Meddler is very good in very specific circumstances, but usually just an undersized body that you're forced to cast to either block (without eating) a small creature or just EoT because otherwise you're wasting mana.  Krasis, on the other hand, is pretty great. It can eat anything up to a 2/3 by itself, and in combination with other creatures it can get ridiculous. Or it can tap something down EoT and provide three unexpected damage in an aggressive situation. Or it can just keep a big beater at bay for a turn. And in the situation where it doesn't get any of that value, it's a 3/3 for 3, which is much better than a 1/4 at the same price.  It's just so, so much easier to make the flash ETB aspect of the Krasis valuable, and much less punishing when you can't."

lrcast,3ay8s3,alwayswritegerl,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:13:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is seen as ""normative sociology"":   Often when we study social problems, there is an almost irresistible temptation to study what we would like the cause of those problems to be (for whatever reason), to the neglect of the actual causes. When this goes uncorrected, you can get the phenomenon of “politically correct” explanations for various social problems – where there’s no hard evidence that A actually causes B, but where people, for one reason or another, think that A ought to be the explanation for B. This can lead to a situation in which denying that A is the cause of B becomes morally stigmatized, and so people affirm the connection primarily because they feel obliged to, not because they’ve been persuaded by any evidence.  Let me give just one example, to get the juices flowing. I routinely hear extraordinary causal powers being ascribed to “racism” — claims that far outstrip available evidence. Some of these claims may well be true, but there is a clear moral stigma associated with questioning the causal connection being posited – which is perverse, since the question of what causes what should be a purely empirical one. Questioning the connection, however, is likely to attract charges of seeking to “minimize racism.” (Indeed, many people, just reading the previous two sentences, will already be thinking to themselves “Oh my God, this guy is seeking to minimize racism.”) There also seems to be a sense that, because racism is an incredibly bad thing, it must also cause a lot of other bad things. But what is at work here is basically an intuition about how the moral order is organized, not one about the causal order. It’s always possible for something to be extremely bad (intrinsically, as it were), or extremely common, and yet causally not all that significant.   Replace ""racism"" with ""sexism"" here, and.."
lrcast,3avxg7,Malarazz,3,Tue Jun 23 22:52:32 2015 UTC,"I think you might be underrating Hixus.  Yes, he's a banisher priest, but he's also a 4/4 with Flash.  You're going to probably be blocking and killing one of the threats and exiling the others.  So I think you're overstating the concern that he dies.  Obviously you aren't going to get reckless with him, but I think after you resolve him in a state where he's getting a 2-for-1 or better, you're going to be swinging the game so far in your favor, it won't matter unless they have an IMMEDIATE answer.  That means he's extremely powerful in the ""losing"" quadrant (while being quite serviceable in other quadrants) which in my opinion bumps him up to at least A-.  It's hard to be this good in the losing quadrant, especially without also being a little bad in other quadrants (e.g. wrath of god)  I think both Hixus and Pia&Kiran will be better than the best uncommon in the set.   I also think you underrate Nissa as a borderland ranger (which is already reasonable) which demands an answer (an actual borderland ranger would not) which is ALSO an excellent 6drop (if you already have 6 lands out, she gets the 7th and transforms immediately.)  The 4/4 doesnt seem exciting, but that 4/4 is defending a rather large incremental card advantage engine and can come back if it dies.  Again, would be surprised if there's an uncommon in the set which is correct to pick over nissa (even in phantomdraft)"

lrcast,3avxg7,bearrosaurus,2,Wed Jun 24 10:18:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sold at all on Gideon.   First off, savannah lions has been crap in limited for a while. No one likes Elite Skirmisher.   Second, his trigger is NOT easy to pull off. Most battalion creatures gained abilities for combat, but trying to flip Gideon is going to lead to a massacre. I predict lots of players getting the trigger but with zero other creatures on their field. Good luck protecting him.   And his ability isn't even good. All that work for Goblin Diplomats?  Playable? Yeah. A-rank? Nope.   (I say all this like it matters. He'll pay off your draft so he's p1p1 every time.)"
lrcast,3avxg7,shinianx,3,Wed Jun 24 02:01:20 2015 UTC,"You're seriously underrating Savannah Lions. It's not an excellent card, but it's certainly good so long as we're not playing M15 where you need to get three one-toughness creatures on one card before it's good enough to overcome their vulnerability. Taking one mana off what is usually more or less Grizzly Bears is not huge, but it's also not insignificant, and the comparison to Elite Skirmisher--which was actually an acceptable card in plenty of decks--is completely outlandish given that it's 3 CMC.  It's also not that hard to flip him. It's not even hard to imagine that you won't have to put mana into making him indestructible. Your opponent will probably make their most favorable blocks which will probably be eating your 2/3 drop with their four drop. They won't block Gideon with their 2-drop since they'll assume he'll just eat it by being made indestructible. That leaves you open to mess with the presumed cost of running a creature into the slaughter with either a removal spell or a combat trick, so it's entirely possible that cost to flip won't even exist.  Then there's also just the situations where you curve out 1-2-3 and kill them.  Either way, once you get it flipped it's not just a Goblin Diplomats. It's a modal Goblin Diplomats/impenetrable blocker/indestructible attacker.  It's one of the cheap 2/X creatures you just kind of need to have in your deck to avoid getting run over, but it even plays reasonably as a late-game topdeck since you'll probably have the mana to spare to just make it an indestructible blocker and, if you can flip it, it can kind of take over any game where you were actually able to flip it in the first place."

You can theorize the overs and unders of grizzly bear v savannah lions, but at the end of the day, we know from experience that these cards aren't good in 40 card decks.  Yeah, we play Dragon Hunter and Mardu Woe-Reaper for the warrior synergies, but I think that says more about how underwhelming FRF and DTK were.  And are you trying to illustrate a case where you attack with 3 creatures while holding combat tricks? C'mon dude, we're trying to evaluate cards here."
lrcast,3avs0o,wmcduff,4,Tue Jun 23 22:09:26 2015 UTC,"There's a fair bit of overlap, I would say.  Aggro really wants a good sense of what your opponent has, because you often can't beat EVERY card, so you need to pin your opponent on a smaller range of cards that you can play around.  If your opponent ""has it all"" as an aggro player - e.g. multiple cheap removal spells AND a wrath AND a source of card advantage... you just can't win.  But if you can figure out what they're missing, you can play around that.  For example, if they're short on spot removal then that gives you more opportunity to play around a wrath, or vice versa.  For example, affinity is an extreme case of an aggro deck (it does bleed into combo, to an extent) where you have to deal with some incredibly powerful hate in postboard games.  However, there are times where you can pin your opponent on, say, Shatterstorm, so you pre-emptively move 4 +1/+1 counters to your inkmoth nexus.    However, that's not to say you're wrong.  Different styles of deck do emphasize certain skillsets, even if that's not the only skillset they require.  I also think the skillset you emphasized Midrange is a bit understated - midrange is also going to press your ability to line-up your hand with your opponents.  Since your individual cards are very strong, you want to make sure you're getting the most out of each individual card by lining them up with what your opponent has.  If you play your threats and answers in a way that each card is ""better"" than the thing from your opponent lined up against it, you're going to be advantaged."

That flight arrives at 7:45. The next flight arrives at 8:15 is waaay too close, considering the best case scenario to get from the airport to the tournament venue is 30 minutes.

lrcast,3auby9,bearrosaurus,6,Tue Jun 23 16:01:01 2015 UTC,"The ""I want to trade"" argument doesn't always work here. If you offer the trade your opponent has to accept it. If they have Raise into Scatter they probably won't want to make that trade. If they don't have any real payoff for the tokens and they predict it will be a long game they may be willing to do so. So you have to accept that your opponents hand will dictate them to want to trade. If that's the case, then you probably don't want to trade. It seems that in most scenarios they will not want to trade because the deck really needs its early tokens to function.   At the same time, it's not only about trading. If they have Raise the Alarm they get to crack back for 2 damage if you attack. If you hold back they don't get to do so.   But this is a very important turn to determine how you think the game will go. Do you have enough answers to what they're doing that you can make the game go long and win through attrition? Or will you be racing with flyers and killing them a turn before they can have a large attack? Somewhere in between? Not quite sure? Neither?  For us to help with the decision we need your decklist, your hand and what cards your opponent showed you in the previous two games."
lrcast,3auby9,IzDaisho,2,Tue Jun 23 16:21:38 2015 UTC,"It mostly depends on your hand. If you anticipate having plays once you hit 4 mana, it's fine to attack. If there's room where you'd want to use the Guildmage, I would hold back."

lrcast,3auby9,pahamack,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:33:09 2015 UTC,"I wanted to keep the pitch simple to get 'usually yes', 'usually no', 'really depends' answers because the hand added a whole other element.  Forest, GR bounceland, Grim affliction, Skyreach manta, Bestial Menace (and a card I can't remember). And if it really matters, this is basically a 4 color control deck.  So there was the second layer of: do I play the basic precombat to leave up Grim Affliction or play a bounce instead.  But I don't really care about advice for a situation that's never going to come up again. I want to know the answer to the more common quesiton: do you make them have it?"
lrcast,3auby9,pahamack,2,Tue Jun 23 17:15:15 2015 UTC,"i think more important than the ""do you make them have it"" question (since it's a 1 for 1) is if you even foresee the guildmage being more than a bear. If your hand is loaded, like you're showing us, with expensive spells, you're never gonna have time to use the guildmage more than once anyway. I would have attacked here. If they block you're disrupting their plan anyway. In fact, I'd think that 2 1/1 tokens is more important to their deck's plan than your dimir guildmage.  The play here is play an untapped land. You have no play this turn, unless it's that last card. That grim affliction doesn't even make this close.   But let's answer your question of ""do you let them have it"". Let's say you have a great 2 drop, like a guildmage, and it's not modern masters but a less powerful set, but one that somehow had [[ambush viper]] in it, which they revealed last turn . They have one and a green untapped and in your hand has no relevant tricks, just a couple of three drops and lands.  I would still attack here. You picked the card not just for it's ability but also for it's utility as a 2 drop.  ""Do you make them have it"" is a more pertinent question with, say, this http://media-dominaria.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/71/754/200/283/635706363431911864.png , which i'm already whining about. 3 mana blowout card that's gonna have to be constantly played around just seems like it promotes bad gameplay to me."
lrcast,3auby9,sylverfyre,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in this example you have a really good game plan that goes out for several turns.  You aren't going to be relying on that guildmage to execute the game plan, so it's more correct to trade.  especially because you're a control deck, trading 1-for-1 is more beneficial to you.  Token decks often want to not lose their tokens unless they're getting 1-for-lessthan1 trades because they need their 1/1s alive to convoke, go wide, overrun, etc."
lrcast,3auby9,Sun_Shine_Dan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:57:21 2015 UTC,"The answer is usually yes. Especially for a card that isn't stand alone going to win the game.   There are a lot more late game scenarios that say no, but all my early games are yes, especially if they worst case scenario is a 1 for 1."
lrcast,3auby9,Suedars,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:52:04 2015 UTC,"The thing is that the context of your hand is hugely important because of the Guildmage's draw ability. If your hand is light on action and you're likely to activate guildmage turns 4 or 5 to search for gas, you're best off keeping it safe. If you've got plenty of action and won't be activating it any time soon, then it's mostly just a Grizzly Bear and you should get in with it. If it were a random X/2, this question would be more generalizable, but in this case it isn't, due to the Guildmage's use as a utility creature.  In this case you've got plenty of powerful plays for the next few turns, so it's probably better to swing in."

lrcast,3aqrnd,enterthereckoner,10,Mon Jun 22 19:19:56 2015 UTC,"I would have appealed that. At Regular REL, what the judge did is the correct thing to do; however, if this event was being held a Competitive with 0-10 tardiness, your opponent probably should have received a game loss.  I say ""probably"" because there is one situation I can think of where they shouldn't - if the round started early. When rounds start early, players are not assessed tardiness penalties until the time in the previous round would have expired. (Logic: If someone finishes a game with 30min left in the round, we can't expect them to stand around bored for half an hour waiting for the next round. So judges let them leave so long as they're back before the next round would have started.)  So if that was indeed the case, then the +4min, no penalty was indeed the correct thing to do.  Either way, appealing that will (hopefully) get you a satisfying answer, one way or the other."
lrcast,3aqrnd,colacadstink,9,Mon Jun 22 19:35:48 2015 UTC,"There is another possibility here. The player may have gained permission from a judge to assist his friend. If this was the case, this needed to be explained to you, but it's possible that the judge didn't feel the need to elaborate. It's possible that the person was dealing with a medical issue or something else personal and did not want to share it with you. This scenario is unlikely, but you should definitely always appeal if something doesn't sound right."

If you're a pro battling for pro points to make a living and wanting to take every edge (within the rules) to help you achieve that and stay on the gravy train then all power to you.  If on the other end you're 100% casual who would rather let the opponent not take a game loss in a situation they should reasonably be assessed one as your enjoyment is coming from the environment and more social side of the game, that's fine too.  Knowing where you fall on that somewhat arbitrary curve is going to drive your decision in situations such as these.  The one thing to be aware of is calling a judge doesn't make you a jerk, and people 'rules lawyering' doesn't make them jerks either.

Making your opponent wait for you is kind of rude. They were there on time. You were expected to be as well. To be granted an extension for a trivial reason just demonstrates that his time is unimportant while yours is. That's simply unfair.  Also, if you do use that extension, then the whole tournament has to wait on you because you decided that getting ready for the tournament wasn't that important. That's not fair to the other players who all managed to find the time to do so.  To encourage players to show up on time and have their stuff together, you have to take a hard line on tardiness. Extensions should be given for unavoidable circumstances or situations where the judge needs to hold a match (such as the case with deck checks)."

On Sunday, at a Sealed Event that was regular REL, a player next to me was late by about 8 minutes, which I would have had no problem with, due to the different nature of the tournament.   His opponent was a little salty, because he would have basically been handed the final match and gone 4-0, instead of 3-0-1, or potentially 3-1 if they had played it out, but rules enforcement should be consistent at each level, or else why have them at all?"

lrcast,3aq4hq,Skythz,3,Mon Jun 22 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"Well...it ain't good. Hard to know what happened without seeing the draft (was this on Mtgo? Do you have the setting where you save your draft files? If so putting it on raredraft.com or similar would help a lot).  Without that it's hard to say if your card evaluations were off or if you were not in the right colors.   So I'd say the following cards are cards I'd typically prefer not to run (in LR grading parlance they are somewhere in the D range). Not to say they are unplayable - running 1 or 2 'D's to make playables is pretty common, but this is a lot:  Dromoka Dunecaster - An expensive, conditional tapper with an irrelevant body. There are times I'd board this in, but I prefer not to start it.  Quarsi Sadist - Neither having a 1/3 or draining opponent for 2 are particularly good. Getting to chose between them is better, but still bad. I'd have run the Icebreakers over this.  Reckless Imp - There are some decks that are happy to run this card, but this is not one of them.  Wandering Tombshell - Another card I could see bringing in against aggro (you have a lot of those), but not one I'd want to start unless I had some big bombs and all I cared about was staying alive.  Territorial Roc - This might hedge into C- - it's a reasonable card to start in a more controlling deck, but it is not a card I'm very happy to play.  At least I'd have run the Champion of Arashin and the Icebreakers. I'd probably run a Great Horn Krushok over the Tombshell. I might even consider the kinda-bad-but-at-least-it's-a-finisher Pilgrim of the Fires."
lrcast,3aq4hq,cferejohn,2,Mon Jun 22 16:49:23 2015 UTC,"Just turned on the save for the draft logs.  I was thinking I had a solid, though not great, deck.  My plan of attack was with fliers and getting rid of opponent's fliers.  Had the Drowner in as a finisher if needed.  I thought the Imp fit into that plan.    I sided the Dunecaster out as well as the tombshells, so I figured those were worse cards.  I made the mistake of looking at my 5 drops and thinking I had too many without looking at the 4-drop slot."
lrcast,3aq4hq,Wraithpk,3,Mon Jun 22 17:03:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of BW in this format.  White is just very weak in the DTK packs, the only benefit being hoping you get some of the strong white FRF cards.  If there are multiple white drafters at your table, you won't get those cards.    In terms of your actual deck, there just isn't much synergy and the overall power level is very low.  First off, you have 4 pieces of removal, but Death Wind is the only really good one.  Sandblast is ok, but there will be situations where you want to kill a creature that isn't attacking or blocking, and it sucks there.  Also, FTI is probably not going to kill what you want it to kill.  It's just all too conditional.  As for the creatures, you have several that are only good in a Dash deck, a few that are only good in a UB control/exploit deck, a few that are good in a tempo UW fliers deck, and a few that are good in the GW Bolster deck.  So your deck is kind of split between 4 different ideas.    If you want to go BW, you need aggressive creatures and good removal to clear the path for them to attack.  One of the main draws to going BW is Harsh Sustenance in the FRF pack.  The fact that you got none of those means that someone else likely was in BW and taking them, maybe the Mardu player you mentioned.  I would have to see your draft log to see where it went wrong, but I would guess  that one of your colors wasn't really open, and that's why the power level of the deck is so low."
lrcast,3aq4hq,Greyfeld,3,Mon Jun 22 20:12:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of BW in this format. White is just very weak in the DTK packs, the only benefit being hoping you get some of the strong white FRF cards. If there are multiple white drafters at your table, you won't get those cards.   The funny thing is, a lot of times I end up being the only one drafting white (or one of the few) while everybody else pushes Black and Red.  So I end up with crazy wheels.  Like I'm doing a draft right now where I got a p1p3 Pacifism, a p2p5 Pacifism, and a P2p6 Silk Wrap.  Granted, it's not the strongest color, so it often loses to that one guy who drafted the perfect BR dash deck, or the perfect UB exploit deck.  But it's better than trying to draft the leftovers of the more popular colors, more times than not."
lrcast,3aq4hq,tvkelley,2,Tue Jun 23 02:50:06 2015 UTC,"It looks like you have a bunch of role-players and no real working strategy.  This can happen in draft, but when you get more familiar with a particular format you tend to evaluate each pick in a larger context (impact on table, what you'll expect in later picks/packs, etc.).    This looks like you drafted a bunch of decent if unexciting cards, and you'll get pretty wrecked by someone who drafted a good deck.  I'd watch some of the CFB DDF draft videos (or Kenji on Gathering Magic) to hear their evaluations when choosing each pick.  Any card you choose is always open for debate, but that internal debate is what forms the direction of your draft."
lrcast,3aq4hq,mtgorrah,2,Mon Jun 22 17:30:10 2015 UTC,"I'd avoid trying to play Pilgrim of the fires. Dies to a lot and costs 7.   I usually try to get better playables than territorial roc, dunecaster, and sadist. Also would never play gate smasher.   There are better cards that do more on their own than gate smasher.  Use the quadrant theory to help you with your picks. Ask, how does this card affect the board?  What was your deck's plan? it seems like it isnt sure if it wants to be defensive or aggressive."
lrcast,3ao720,SnowJoust,5,Mon Jun 22 03:17:05 2015 UTC,Why no Monastery Siege in the main?

lrcast,3aor7v,darthWes,3,Mon Jun 22 07:09:46 2015 UTC,"I think this is a pretty decent pool -- every color has a bunch of good playables, and you could go a lot of directions with it. I would probably be base green -- you have a solid curve of creatures in green, you have two fight cards, wild call is pretty powerful, etc. You could pair green with any second color and have a decent deck, but I think red is the best choice? I think white may be the worst here, with some cards that are great in the right deck but pretty mediocre without synergies (Dromoka Captain, Great Teacher's Decree, Echoes, Aegis, etc.). The blue cards are solid but somewhat underpowered (interceptor, lotus path djinn). Black has a few great cards (foul renewal, damnable pact, flatten) but is light on good creatures. So I would just go with a R/G curve-out beefy creatures deck, winning with Elk Herd, War Brute, and Wild Call as big dumb dudes. And I would consider splashing black for Flatten and Foul Renewal.  So I guess this would be my deck:  Creatures:  1x Ainok Guide  1x Glade Watcher  1x Humble Defector  2x Guardian Shield-Bearer  1x Abzan Beastmaster  1x Hardened Berzerker  2x Screamreach Brawler  1x Salt-Road Ambushers  1x Atarka Efreet  1x Goblin Heelcutter  1x Stampeding Elk Herd  1x Sprinting Warbrute  1x Wildcall  Non-Creatures:  1x Epic Confrontation  1x Tread Upon  1x Hunt the Week  1x Tormenting Voice  1x Sarkhan's Rage  1x Flatten  1x Foul Renewal  Lands:  1x Rugged Highlands  8x Forest  6x Mountain  3x Swamp"
lrcast,3aor7v,mrcjtm,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:33:53 2015 UTC,"Green is pretty obviously your deepest color, but this is a tough pool because all four other colors have reasonable offerings. I'd start with GB because your black removal is good, but probably arrive at the Jund option you put together.  Angler seems good here, more dudes is good with two fight spells and Foul Renewal. The question is do we want Tormenting Voice to help enable us to get our mana, enable Angler, and maybe cheat a dude in with Foul Renewal? I don't think its better than Pinion Feast, or maybe even Douse in Gloom or Map the Wastes."
lrcast,3aor7v,krdonnie,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:42:58 2015 UTC,"There should be 40 cards there in my build -- maybe one of the 2x's wasn't totally clear. Anyways, I've got 15 creatures here, 7 spells, and 18 lands. I think tormenting voice is kind of necessary to help enable our mana and give us a little flood insurance so we don't feel as bad about playing 18 lands."

lrcast,3aor7v,krdonnie,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:51:11 2015 UTC,I think green-red is your strongest pairing.
lrcast,3aor7v,_kEND,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:29:33 2015 UTC,Maybe red green with splash for both flatten and foul renewal? Foul renewal would be awesome paired with your big dudes from green.
lrcast,3aor7v,kalikaiz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:49:10 2015 UTC,"I'm just your average sealed player, so take my comment with a grain of salt. The pool is not bad, but it's fair to say that you got a bit screwed in the bomb rares department. It happens a lot.   That said, your non-bomb cards are really solid. As others have said, R/G seems to be the strongest color combination. Since you don't have the bomby top-end, you need to find ways to close out games after you curved out and your opponent potentially gummed up the board. Heelcutter helps with that to a degree, and given your fixing, I'd consider splashing blue for Taigam's Strike and Ojutai Interceptor. Taigam's Strike is usually only playable in a very narrow type of deck, but I think in this R/G build it can win a lot of games, with cards like Atarka Efreet, Goblin Heelcutter or the Elk Herd.   If you want to go a more conventional route, black would give you access to Gurmag Angler, Foul Renewal and Flatten."
lrcast,3aor7v,Skurry,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:34:01 2015 UTC,"This pool is pretty good, though you don't have any bombs. White is unplayable. Blue is ok, but doesn't really have anything great. Green/Red/Black have the following as cards I would be ""excited"" to play.  Epic Confrontation  Abzan Beastmaster  Hunt the Weak  Stampeding Elk Herd  Wildcall  Atarka Efreet  Goblin Heelcutter  Sarkhan's Rage  Sprinting Warbrute  Volcanic Vision  Hand of Silumgar  Douse in Gloom  Flatten  Foul Renewal  Gurmag Angler  The red cards are quite aggressive, so I only like them if you can build an aggressive deck. I didn't go through the entire curve, but it's possible R/G has enough early plays, though you may have to play some mediocre cards like 2/3 dash. Alternatively you could go B/G and go for a more controlling deck. The downside here is that you don't have any unconditional removal or bombs so if the game goes long you aren't necessarily in great shape. Based on that I'd go with the R/G beatdown plan."

lrcast,3akxjo,mageta621,2,Sun Jun 21 21:49:14 2015 UTC,I also thing the plethora of morphs made the game really interesting and DDF's megamorphs are a weak version that just serve as a reminder of the good times of old.

I also determined that having a collection that purely appreciates in value also makes me feel good. It's like money I won't spend because it's pretty.

lrcast,3akxjo,KaioKennan,2,Sun Jun 21 19:43:19 2015 UTC,"Why not make a set cube?  It will cost maybe a bit more than a single draft set (if you get rid of the most expensive rares, such as fetchlands), and you can draft from it an unlimited number of times."

If you use the booster box approach and people don't keep the cards they draft, you can use those as a foundation for a set cube too."

While I was playing it I actually joked that it's so hard to gain tempo in the early game in that set that I thought giant growth would be first pickable in the set. I don't think that's far off.  DDF was a breath of fresh air for me. The only card I miss from 3x KTK is treasure cruise. I think it's a mistake that there's no good blue delve card in FRF. With new ways to stock your yard, it would've been nice to get a blue payoff, not just will of the naga which isn't very good."

It's core set analogue (Frost Breath) is slightly stronger considering the color commitment on Will, but it's still a decent 1-of in a deck that can use 1-for-1's to keep your opponent on only a few creatures and tempo them out.  It's no Sleep, obviously."

lrcast,3ammjs,Not-even-in-flames,5,Sun Jun 21 18:47:41 2015 UTC,"It's like this: The only rules meaning ""Exploit"" has is that you may sacrifice a creature. If you look at the reminder text, you'll see that's all it says.  The effect you get from Exploit is a second ability that triggers when the creature is sacrificed.  So while the first trigger goes on the stack when the creature enters the battlefield, if the creature isn't  there when it resolves, the second ability--the one that gives you something--won't trigger."

The opportunity to sac something goes on the stack, and then the Valorous Stance on top of that. Stance resolves to kill your exploit guy, and then you get the opportunity to sac something. If you do, your exploit creature is t around to see the sacrifice happen, so the ability that triggers when you sac the thing doesn't go off."
lrcast,3ammjs,Atmosck,5,Sun Jun 21 19:01:29 2015 UTC,"No, the ""you may sacrifice a creature"" trigger resolves. When it resolves, you choose if you want to sac a creature. Doing so is a bad idea at this point, because Sidisi is no long on the battlefield, so his ""When you exploit a creature, you may search your library for a card."" trigger won't trigger.  If your opponent had waited until after the exploit trigger resolved and the second trigger was on the stack, then you would get to tutor even without sidisi on the battlefield."

Unless that extra 5 life was going to literally be the difference between winning and losing, there's no reason to take that risk."
lrcast,3aljzd,Not-even-in-flames,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:41:06 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the biggest issue here is that your early game is really weak.  You're running a lot of stuff at the top end, and I think you could pare some of it down to give yourself some consistency in your early game.  I'd probably start with dropping the Rakshasa Gravecaller (you aren't really running a color pairing that encourages exploiting, and this card only really gives you a set of blockers, which you already have with all your other high cost cards) and Aven Sunstriker (you don't have enough counter/bolster sources to be worth running, especially with the double-white mana cost), and maybe replace them with Dromoka Warrior and Arashin Cleric.    I'd also consider cutting Silumgar Butcher, but that spot removal is hard to replace.  Hand of Silumgar would be a decent replacement, but with your black mana being so low, it may end up a dead card in your opening hand more often than not."
lrcast,3aljzd,mtgorrah,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:48:16 2015 UTC,Since you're running 2 whisperer of the wilds I would have cut the extra land for either dramoka warrior or pinion feast

Convoking out a 7/7 is really strong, and it's versatile too in that it can be a fast 3/3 if you need that instead.  You're also only at 15 creatures when you count your token-making spells.  Definitely would have tried to find room for the Primarch.  (Maybe cut sigil blessing, I find that 3 of this type of effect might be one too many - 4 if you count Guildmage.)  All in all, that's a really minor nitpick about a really sweet deck."

lrcast,3aj437,TheJediCounsel,2,Sun Jun 21 00:18:16 2015 UTC,"I own and enjoy all of them since 2012. 2014 is my favorite; I appreciate the nod to Limited even if it wasn't stunningly implemented, and mostly I just modded it to a ridiculous extent so I barely remember the original content."
lrcast,3aj437,Sceptilesolar,2,Sun Jun 21 01:16:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. 2013 was in my opinion one of the best magic formats ever.   Specifically, the ancient wilds deck is everything I want to do: Play a bunch of elves, have one of every creature ever printed in my deck, be incredibly grindy and slow, with value cards like vengevine and , thragtusk, interact a ton with my opponent with erratic portals, play 1/2 creatures for 1 mana (something I continue to attempt even to this day), and voltron stuff up with +1/+1 counters.   It is probably my favorite deck of all time, due to how many cool things it was trying to simultaneously do, and how so many of the cards tried to work together.   It was also what I think makes a great control deck design: one that allows your opponent to interact with you. Erratic portals are incredibly powerful, especially in a limited card pool format, but your opponent does get to play around them.   .... And it could only exist because of the very well designed 2013 limitations. Specifically, how careful they were NOT to give you full playsets of auto include cards (ancient wilds had one eternal witness, if I recall. the red beatdown deck had nowhere near a playset of goblin guides.). It was a format where most of the decks were at least interesting, and could take games. Because it was a full format, with decks designed to work within that format. Yeah, you could probably build a great red burn deck to have near a 100% win rate against ancient wilds. But not with the card pool any of the decks let you have.   Basically, it was an incredibly fun format AND it taught me most of what I know of how the game works. Stuff like the value of a curve, just how many big creatures you can fit in your deck, how slow you can get away with being, and how ruthless you have to be sometimes cutting stuff (Ancient wilds a roaring primadox deck and my version ended up playing zero roaring primadoxes).   I didn't play 2012 but understood it was well recieved.   The 2014 deck lists felt like they were written by multiple people who never spoke to one another. It was just a badly designed game built by children.   Specifically, the rush decks have quality hard removal, like multiple path to exiles and high quality low drops like a full playset of champion of the parish, and there are two decks in the format that don't seem to realize this: Green is a ""play one creature per turn, hope you don't kill it"", and it's low end puts on zero pressure. The 3 drop quality is so low you have to seriously consider playing 3/1 hexproofs for 3. As mentioned, the white deck is a humans deck, with stuff like doomed traveller and gather the townsfolk. And you are playing 3/1's for 3, waiting to play your big 6 drop and immediately find out what path to exile does.   And then there is a pants on head retarded deck called enter the dracomancer. Where you play a bunch of dragon fodder, sacrifice your entire board to this retarded mechanic called devour, build a giant dragon by emptying your entire hand to make tokens, then sacrificing all your own tokens.... and then have it pathed to exile, because again, one half of the design team had never spoken to the other half of the design team and the white humans deck is playing multiple copies of quality hard removal like path to exile and oblivion ring.   2015 is just terrible. It's a cash grab and forfeits the central advantage of  duels, that it's a highly restricted format that allows decks to do very interesting things by restricting their access not only by types of cards, but also numbers of copies. Full playsets were rare in 2013. 2015 was also incredibly hackable. There was a great video at launch of a guy just making joke decks, like his 40+ copies of the card clone, and a bunch of islands.   Overall, It makes me so sad how great 2013 was and how atrocious 2014 was. And frankly, rather angry. I can sympathize with 2015. The team felt they had nothing to add, so just made a cynical cash grab. But 2014 is an embarassment. The guys who built those deck lists had no idea what they were doing."
lrcast,3aj437,probablynotapenguin,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:42:45 2015 UTC,"See, apart from the Green Deck, which I agree is designed to be simple but ends up not being competitive (note that it's the starter deck, so there may be a reason for this), I think 2014's deck lists are incredibly well built.  The Dracomancer actually works really well once you get off the devour train and treat it as a ramp deck, trying to get big threats lethal, and wiping out anything that might be dangerous using the removal. It's not the strongest, but it's definitely better than, for example, Masks of the Dimir, which is boring when it's winning and miserable when it's losing. And the Eldrazi deck is my favourite deck I've ever played Magic with.  I'm also a big fan of the deck pack Fairies and Exalted decks; but I do like the Human Weenies as well. I will admit that there's no really fun control deck in the format, though.  But then, I haven't played 2013, maybe 2014 suffers by comparison."
lrcast,3aj437,probablynotapenguin,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:29:14 2015 UTC,"I won't comment on the DLC. I was long gone by then.  I do like the eldrazi. I think it's fun to play. Eldrazi conscription is an insanely powerful card, especially in a format where dodging removal is relevant.   I disagree completely on dracomancer, which is irredeemable. It has so much top end you can find some solid finishers somewhere in the list, but in my opinion, it just doesn't have enough quality in the 1 and 2 drop slots, which is a huge problem for a deck that is trying to ramp on turn 3 or 4. And it's threats just get outclassed. Not only does it lose to other ramp decks just on quality and consistency, but it loses to rush decks just because it's not playing any relevant combat creature before turn 4. What's your ideal sequence? tukatongue thalid, dragon fodder, and then either a 3 mana 2/2 or a 3 drop ramp spell? so your opponent swings at you.... and unless your opponent is playing sacred wolf, what favorable blocks can you set up?  That's dracomancer. It just doesn't have the core of early creatures to support anything but a token strategy, and devour is a terrible token strategy. Maybe if they just have you a bunch of scion of the wilds.   It's lacking power, but it's also lacking an identity. It's literally just eldrazi with worse finishers and more intensive color requirements.   For a total rundown, I was long gone by the time DLC came down, but I found that Eldrazi was fun. The lifegain white was pretty one dimensional and vulnerable. Dracomancer was terrible. Green value was not value. Overall, that's already just too many misses in my mind.  It does have a few decks that can somewhat play against each other (humans versus zombies, for example), but I think as an entry, it is missing most of the merit of 2013.... which really had DEEP decklists. 2013's hallmark was that after you built your deck, you would have several great cards that you want to put in your deck, but have to cut another great card.  That was what 2013 was for me. It's not real magic, the priority system isn't real magic. It's a great entry point to learn ""okay, this is what a deck is"". Everything supported that. Deep card pools with tons of things that are great so you have to cut something relevant. An encounter mode which really let you realize ""oh, this is what a deck needs to do to be playable"". And a very controlled environment to allow them to showcase some really fun cards was a nice plus."
lrcast,3aj437,huntsoda,2,Sat Jun 20 23:12:34 2015 UTC,"Fairies is an excellent, excellent deck, as is the Counterburn list. There's a strong elves deck (you get 3 well wishers :o) and the Eldrazi ramp deck is a mainstay of 2HG.  I agree that both 3 color decks in 2014 miss the mark by a HUGE, HUGE margin. Slivers and Dracomancer are basically unplayable, largely because Evolving Wilds + Rampant Growth is unacceptable fixing in a format with good elves, good humans, OK zombies, a surprisingly good/fluid illusion deck, and a strong Faeries build available. I feel like there should have been some concession, since those decks aren't uber powerful anyway - why not throw in shocks, or buddy/check lands - maybe even ABUR duals? It doesn't throw the format that much if the slivers decks is able to actually play their threats - the threats aren't that good.   Yes, 2013 rewarded you way harder for unlocking everything - I think I cut an unmake from the exalted list - but 2014 pushes you to do something different - meta game. You KNOW you are going to be against a good threats deck (humans and eldrazi are the most popular) and a distruptive deck (counterburn, life gain + removal, faeries) and plan accordingly.   I wrote way more about this than I thought I would, and I think I end up agreeing with you that I think 2013's environment as you describe it is better - I just find more of 2013's decks bland. I wrote up a thing ragging on each 2013 deck, but basically: in 2013 I only wanted to play Nefarox - in 2014 I have trouble choosing a deck because there are so many fun ones. None of them are ""my"" deck, but there are multiple I really enjoy."
lrcast,3aj437,probablynotapenguin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:47:48 2015 UTC,"I can see appreciating the metagame of 2014, but I don't think it's so much that 2013 rewarded you harder. Avacyn's glory starts with ONE of it's champions of the parish,  only half of it's angelic overseers, no baneslayer, no resto angel.... only part of it's amazing removal suite... Overall, I agree, 2013 really forced you to play 30 games with the deck before you could really start the deckbuilding. But 2014 isn't in my opinion really different. It's just that the 2013 decks felt like they had enough depth to run multiple different builds. Pack instinct is just a midrange creature deck. Dracomancer doesn't have any fallback plan after devour stops working, simply because ALL it's low drops are tokens, and it has no other payoff mechanics.  Ancient wilds can be heavy elves, with joraga+bond beetle+ a bunch of tutors+ yeva, it can be a search up big fatties deck, it can be a HEAVY bounce deck... And that's because it has a tiny number of stone unplayables. What are the cards that you really can't run? manaplasm, ambassador oak, herd gnarr? Even wurmweaver coil, while nearly the worst card in the deck, at least does something decisive, and ring of kalonia gives elf variant decks some cheap inevitability. That's why you get to actually build a deck, instead of just play one they gave you. Because you have lots of playables to choose from and tweak with."

Basically, instead of a bunch of janky, OK decks, I want to see a bunch of really good decks. Maybe that's not the nature of magic, but I'd like to see someone take a whack at it (and let's not mention 2015's complete deviation into fake mtgo)"
lrcast,3aj437,scottstoops,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:21:51 2015 UTC,"You played zero Primadoxes??? I ran the full set. Mine is based all around bouncing creatures - the deathtouch snake to destroy lands or enchantments, the spider to kill fliers, the mana elf to drag up tons of lands. I pair that with the enchantment that searches creatures and puts into play based on their power and toughness. Ultimately it wins by bouncing the wolf with the kicker where you multi-kick it to put 2/2 wolves into play, or casting overrun, then eternal witness-ing and casting again. I obv don't know all the card names lol, but that's my basic strategy for it."
lrcast,3aj437,probablynotapenguin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:45:37 2015 UTC,"I found that they were just too much of a liability. It was devestating to have your other creatures removed and then have a primadox have to bounce himself, leaving you with basically no board, and I felt like I needed some creatures that could actually battle in my midrange slots. I went with wolfbriar, of course, but also vengevine and (bugged at the time, I believe) Yeva, nature's herald (I think she was a 4/5 and she's supposed to be a 4/4). I also exprimented with briarpack alpha builds.   I didn't use wild pair at all, I just felt it was too slow. It does basically nothing for 6 mana, doesn't really pay for itself the first time you activate it, and by the time you have had 6 mana for 3 turns, I felt the deck had already won in most matchups, wild pair or no. In addition, I wanted nothing but creatures in my 6+ slots, because those were the guys I natural ordered for. I found it was really important to have both gaea's revenge and terastodon, simply because natural order was crippled if you only had gaea's revenge and it was in your hand, but also because terastodon simply closed out some types of games more effectively than gaea's revenge.   I didn't actually run overrun. I figured if I made it to 5 mana with creatures in play, I was far more likely to survive (and therefore win) by dropping a portal and activating, or a thragtusk, than by overrunning and leaving myself vulnerable to the crackback. Overrun did nothing on defense. Erratic portal, acidic slime, stingerfling, joraga, and thragtusk were 5 drops that defended effectively, and I just used taunting elves to win board stalls instead of an overrun effect.   That's what I liked about magic 2013 though. There were some REAL choices to be made, and I don't think that there were necessarily correct ones. I felt it was pretty correct to include most of the low drop elves simply"

I really enjoy the environments the games make for online multiplayer. 2HG is a blast, and a lot of the decks get to do almost powerful things - it feels a lot like t4 or t5 modern - you get a few rares, a couple cool combos, but nothing earthshattering.

lrcast,3ajj0d,4-in-hand,8,Sat Jun 20 20:29:23 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen/heard, WOTC is attempting to bring the player demographics closer to 50/50 through general support, openness to discussion, and inclusion of female employees on a relatively (for the game industry) large scale.   I think the real issue we're facing is with the player base, which at least appears to be resistant to equality-minded rhetoric. Unfortunately, this reflects a larger issue in our society: a broad misunderstanding of concepts like privilege and social pressure, common among a great number of people of all genders.   ((Oh, and Madness and Civilization is my personal favorite!))"
lrcast,3ajj0d,azotlenelli,3,Sat Jun 20 20:47:07 2015 UTC,"First, thanks for your considered comments. I'm going to try and encourage positivity and healthy discussion; something that I think we as a community also need to do.   My take away from your point is that WotC is probably doing things to address this, but out of protection for their own corporate brand they're not being open with those strategies (which is fair, given that their ultimate goal is to make money). Still, I don't think the things you listed are enough. We don't need general support from WotC, we need targeted strategies because we're talking about developing a huge community. I'm reminded of desegregation in southern schools. It was the prevailing logic of most southern (and northern) liberals that given enough time schools would eventually integrate. It took the supreme court to say that it has to happen NOW. Even then it took generations and generations to begin to ameliorate the tensions between racial communities in those areas. A social project that is still continuing to this day.   Your thoughts on the player base are interesting, but it feels a little too abstract for me. I'm reminded of the differences between latent and conscious prejudice. Most people, when asked, would say that they're not racist; though studies have shown that people still harbor certain racist attitudes. This is the shift from avert to symbolic or laissez-faire racism. Here's a wiki article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire_racism  I think the player base is open to equality-minded rhetoric, but there are still latent structures that are prohibitive to women.   As to the larger issue in our society that you reference, I think you're right. It's very difficult for us as players of a game to connect ourselves and our local communities to these larger social structures. Again, this is part of the reason why I think the problem requires a multi-faceted approach (one that involves WotC more directly). I think it wouldn't hurt them to publicly acknowledge this and to make public the efforts that they would put into practice. There's plenty of precedent for this kind of action (cf. corporate shifts regarding environmental practices etc.).  Yeah. Madness and Civilization is super good. And increasingly relevant as our own society begins to take on issues of healthcare and mental health. I've always had a soft-spot for The Order of Things and The Archeology of Knowledge, especially the later. Best analysis of science and modern epistomology I think."

lrcast,3ajj0d,CelestialBeekeeper,5,Sat Jun 20 22:18:20 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go out and offer an alternate view.  I think your reasoning makes sense only if we assume that there's a large community of women out there who want to play Magic, but that the only thing keeping them away from organized play is fear of sexism, or a sense of being excluded.  I'm sure that there's some truth to that, but I doubt that's all there is to it.  For context: I live in a very large city. In it, there are two fairly large, easily accessible stores that do a lot of Magic events. Of those two, both are largely, or even primarily staffed by women, and don't seem to have the same ""boy's club"" attitudes that I've seen in some other places. I work at one of those stores.  At the store where I work, for tournaments we have very few female players, but those who we do have are typically regulars. We don't often get women who try out playing, and don't return. At the same time, of the people who come in because they're thinking about getting into Magic for the first time, or are casual players who just want to buy packs, very few are women.   You could say that there's some aura of the comic/game shop (the store where I work is both) that makes women feel uninvited, but that's also not the case--we get plenty of women who participate in Dungeons & Dragons events, buy comics, or otherwise come into the store to look around. It's just that of the many women who visit the store, very few are interested in card games.  I'm not trying to generalize that card games aren't for women. I'm just saying, I'm not sure being more inviting to the women who already want to play, however positive that may be, will radically change Magic's demographics.  It's a nice idea, but what good is a women's only tournament when you can't get enough players for it to start, and the women who play regularly want to play with their friends in the community, most of whom are men?"
lrcast,3ajj0d,CelestialBeekeeper,0,Sat Jun 20 22:20:23 2015 UTC,"I just want to address your first assumption. The point of a WotC organized initiative to diversify the player base would encourage people familiar with the game to participate in more store/IRL tournaments AND would also work toward developing a new population of players who wouldn't otherwise be exposed to the game. Both of these populations, the real and the potential, need to be tended to.   Also, the metric for success for this kind of effort has to be measured over a long period of time. I don't think there's a quick fix for the situation, but we need to develop and imagine structures that allow these populations to flourish, even if it takes months or years to develop into a fully fledged system."

How does Wizards successfully market to a demographic that already makes up a minority of its consumer base in a way that goes beyond its current strategies?"
lrcast,3ajj0d,poopSMASH,0,Sun Jun 21 03:56:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know what it would look like. Part of the idea of this thread is if we could imagine or brainstorm a set of initiatives that would attack the problem from that angle.   Wizards has a long history of creating interesting marketing devices that target specific communities (you have to look back in the magic archive to find some great ones, but I'm especially a fan of the cut-out coupons in the backs of YA books that you could mail in for a booster pack or a special rare card).   I think it's also important to keep in mind that there's the demographic market that exists and there's also the market that can exist in the future, if a push is made in that direction.   Beyond straight advertising, support for lady planeswalker leagues, etc. We could also imagine the return of magic camps that target a wide array of kids. Older magic players probably remember the existence of some of these camps. If I remember correctly the streamer Elantris attended one when she was younger.   The point is that there are a lot of ways that we can diversify the community, and we shouldn't limit our thinking to simply what seems the most obvious. We should also remember that we're thinking of a community-to-be. The choices we make now, the choices that Wizards makes now, are going to shape what the future community looks like. That community doesn't have to look exactly like the one we have right now."

Regardless of how one feels about his points, he essentially took an extremely condescending tone towards female readers, causing a lot of prominent women in the magic community to express their discomfort.   IMO, this the biggest reason for the under-representation of women in Magic, aside from simple inertia. Little gestures, mostly expressed on a local level but occasionally by community mouthpieces like Davis, that say ""this is a game for dudes.""  I hope that's what you were looking for, and I apologize if I completely misunderstood your question."
lrcast,3ajj0d,ThePensive,2,Sat Jun 20 22:45:13 2015 UTC,"No the little demeaning gestures are a good point - I am sure there is a lot of that out there. I think that just as the little local things may be a big cause of the under-representation the little local things are the answer. How did I get into Magic? A couple friends showed me and they learned from their friends or older siblings. I think the barrier for introducing women to the game should be the same. When I introduce someone to Magic (guy or woman) if they enjoy it I try and nurture their interest. It should be a grass root level effort since the problems appear to be at that level.  Thanks for the specific example, much easier for me to engage on."
lrcast,3ajj0d,Badfiend,3,Sun Jun 21 02:03:33 2015 UTC,"There is no single correct answer or tactic (see my initial references to Foucault's political theory). Grassroots efforts are important and essential (Efro's signoff from a few months back about this on CR made the case well), but this issue needs to be attacked on multiple fronts. Some of those fronts, like how you as a player interact with people in your playgroup/community, are easy for you to participate in. Other fronts, like what WotC can do as an organization that sets parameters for tournaments and advertises the game to different demographics, are essentially unavailable to us. But we can call them out.   The point is not to decide which front is the best front, but to say that all fronts need to do everything that can do toward this common goal.  Your description of how you nurture the game within your social group sounds great. Communities like this exist through those forms of interaction, but with a group of people as large as the entire player base of Magic, more stuff needs to happen. Your responsibility is to yourself and to your social group, but we also need to find ways to make envoys to the larger structures that determine the very forms of possibility for play and for the emergence of the community (here I'm thinking of TOs, store owners, WotC).  Part of what my post was about was to call out WotC and hopefully generate enough buzz to maybe put a bug in their ear that there's more things that they can do from a tournament organization/PR side.  Being able to imagine completely new possibilities is important. We shouldn't limit ourselves to what's been done before, we need to start thinking about what is possible in the abstract and how those ideas could be actualized. This kind of creative thinking should happen publicly and people in WotC should take it under consideration."

Granted, I'm a guy, so of course my opinion is meaningless and unwanted because reasons, but it seemed to me that the author was attempting to make a point about becoming the evil we seek to remove.

I ask because lately it's been feeling like if I'm not waving the flag of women's rights, I'm being blindly labeled a sexist.  So here is my question to you in particular. If the best you can come up with when asked for an honest example of sexism in Magic is pointing to an article that was taken down near immediately for asking essentially that same honest question, is that really a reasonable answer?"

My entire point is that you claim there is this sexist undertone present within the Magic community, but have entirely failed to provide a single example of this occuring in reality. I've never seen it, no one I know has ever seen it, and even the people calling for equality at the LGS don't seem to have any actual examples of it. I'm not saying sexism doesn't exist, but MtG has a very large community, and one random sexist asshole does not a movement require. When I run afoul of some rude player while playing, I somehow manage not to turn it into some shadowy form of oppression. If it really bothered me, I might talk to a judge, or even the store owner if I really want to cause a fuss. The thing is people love to tell stories about the shitty things that have happened to them on here, but never have I heard a story that involved systematic sexism at the old LGS.  For the record, dealing with pick-up lines from across the table is not sexism. Assholes using the phrase 'beat by a girl' is not sexism. Using these petty complaints as examples diminishes actual sexism, the stuff you should be focusing your attention on instead of hassling Magic players because there aren't enough girls playing. Do you think we want it that way? Like everytime I tap a land I comment on how nice it is to be surrounded by dudes all day? Maybe you'll attack wrestling fans for having a male dominated fanbase, or the NFL. Hell, they don't even let women play most sports with men, go fight that battle. Forgive me if I seem dismissive, but I just don't see the damage being done here by the supposedly sexist mtg community.  But hey, maybe it is out there.

Jesus people, how sensitive do we have to become as a society before we decide that breathing is offensive to the trees who worked so hard to make that air and start dying of empathy?  If you have a breakdown everytime a mean person says something mean to you, you simply cannot function as a human being. People, myself included, have trouble taking the modern feminist movement seriously, in part because of people claiming minor inconveniences like that are some form of sexism or another.

To your last paragraph: 1) It's not the best example, it's cited as the most recent example. 2) The article does not ask ""essentially that same honest question"" it poorly critiques an earlier article. 3) the fundamental logic of your question doesn't make sense.

Nothing I said was worded with any real venom, nothing inflammatory in my comment as far as I can tell, so why lose your cool?  I suppose my point was that discussion is generally better than suppression, so hate mobbing an article you disagree with is inherently flawed reasoning. That, and feminism doesn't need to be everywhere and in everything. We don't need less sexism in grocery stores, pharmacies, apple stores, or half of the places people seem to want to insert it these days. In the same way that carrying a hose around and spraying anything that moves is not preventing fires, this relentless demand that every aspect of life should be bending over backward to accommodate women is not preventing sexism. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised to find that all this special consideration promotes more sexism than it prevents.  Finally, it seems like a problem to me that such a simple question is what you call ""a blackhole argument"". Really? I ask for a concrete example of sexism in Magic, and you tell me we will never agree on the topic and should just move on?

I promise you that someone along that chain isn't a mustache twirling misogynist keeping sexism in Magic on the down low.  As a Magic player, I don't believe a card game can be sexist, I don't believe that I personally am sexist, and were I to witness such sexism in a Magic environment, I would certainly speak out against it.

lrcast,3ajj0d,QuatreWinner,2,Mon Jun 22 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"I had a longer response but my browser crashed. Let me try to boil down everything in a list:  1) I'm sorry if my tone offended you. I don't want to have a argument about whether or not sexism exists within the magic community. It does. We know this because players are talking about it. My point earlier was to direct you to sources that document some of that evidence for you. I also think that if you're interested in this question, then you should talk to women players in your store and in your community. I have yet to meet a woman player who doesn't think that the community could do better on matters of sexism.  2) Your language regarding feminism will offend people, but I understand that that is not your intention. Here's why: Feminism describes the political and social belief in equality. It's rooted in a specific history of women's suffrage in the beginning of the 20th century. If equality is relevant, then feminism is relevant. To your examples, should equality be relevant in apple stores, groceries, and pharmacies? Yes. It wasn't that long ago that we lived in a segregated society that was organized under the legal principle of ""separate, but equal."" The result was separation, but not equality. I know that you're not tacitly arguing for anything like that. However, I think that the inflammatory rhetoric around terms like feminism obfuscates what it's really about. It's about equality. If you believe in equality, then you believe in the founding principle of feminism. Here's the rub: When it comes to sectors of the population that are historically discriminated against, they enter in society from a position of disadvantage. Simply asserting equality, when some people are inherently unequal, is simply not enough. Here's MaRo's breakdown of what this looks like in MTG terms: http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/122011706093/im-not-sure-how-much-you-may-want-to-debate-this  3) It's great that you've made a commitment to yourself to speak out against sexism or any form of discrimination that you see at your LGS. In the same light, we can't just unload responsibility onto the people that are treated unfairly (this is directed at your point that women should just step up if they're victimized). This is a problem that can only be addressed by an overwhelming majority of participants. The point of the original message was to say that while it's important for us to do what we can to be positive stewards of the game, that Wizards almost must step up, in ways more tangible than simply telling us to do a better job in our communities. I was hoping that we could brainstorm some ways of what that might look like.   4) Most of what we're talking about, with regard to sexism, is much more clandestine than outright sexual harassment. I'll direct you to moments in the thread where we're discussion symbolic, or Laissez-faire, racism. Because this is more of a cultural problem, we need to think a little more creatively about how to address it. Ultimately we're talking about a cultural shift that makes the game more welcoming to a diverse player base."

lrcast,3ajj0d,mtg_liebestod,0,Sun Jun 21 17:05:09 2015 UTC,"My comments are not ""deliberately hurting"" anyone. And I'm obviously not asking anyone to sit down and shut up. Quite frankly, these claims are plainly insulting and hyperbolic.  I'd honestly be amazed if a dozen women have contacted you over my comments. The community doesn't have that many female regulars, and it's quite frankly sad if so many of them are so fragile that the potential to be disagreed with in a stern-yet-polite fashion would dissuade them from posting. Again, if the presence of voices like mine are incompatible with creating ""safe spaces for women"", then this is an unwinnable battle. You can ban me from this subreddit (maybe?), but that's it. (I'd rather see a policy explicated that I'd supposedly be falling afoul of, of course.) I'm still going to be at FNM, and I'm only going to be more-critical on these issues as they arise.  But really, ""over a dozen women""? With the exception of you, whose gratuitous hostility has been noted by uninterested third parties, my interactions in this thread have been pretty positive. /u/zvazda, that's really the case?"

lrcast,3ajj0d,oraymw,2,Sun Jun 21 06:49:21 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you said. However I think Wizards is doing everything they can.  As a corporate entity they always answer to the bottom line.  But I think that SCG and local game stores can do more to support lady planeswalkers nights.  But these things only go so far. Having discussions like these is what is needed.  Thinking about these issues and discussing them is what's going to make the biggest change.  So cheers and thanks for the post.
lrcast,3ajj0d,mtg_liebestod,2,Sun Jun 21 07:01:12 2015 UTC,Whether or not wizards must do something is less interesting to me than a discussion about what in particular they could do. Does anyone have any ideas?
lrcast,3ajj0d,zvazda,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:13:25 2015 UTC,"I think they should incentivize LGS' to hold lady planeswalker societies or women only tournaments/game nights.   Yeah I vehemently disagree with this. Let's not bring ""man taxes"" to Magic, please. Not sure if there's much to add here, really. I don't think the problem of gender is so important in the community that we should be trying to redistribute from men to women within the community."
lrcast,3ajj0d,oraymw,10,Mon Jun 22 15:11:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a dude and I'd give my LGS lots of kudos if they held a ""Ladies' Night"" every now and then."
lrcast,3ajj0d,mtg_liebestod,-1,Mon Jun 22 15:37:53 2015 UTC,"One of my stores actually does have a ladies night, more or less. It's a self-organized thing, and doesn't mean that the store gets closed off to men entirely, which would probably be illegal anyways.  The issue is that I see a heavy-handed push in this direction as leading to substitutions. Like, if Wizards incentivized stores to have women-only events and that came at the expense of other events that would occur organically and the explanation was ""sorry guys, but social justice demands that you not have these opportunities for organized play"", then I think that's relatively indefensible. Yes, we can try to suit it up as a rationalizable market strategy but everyone knows that that's bullshit."
lrcast,3ajj0d,oraymw,4,Mon Jun 22 15:42:45 2015 UTC,"So Wizards could always say ""We give stores a bonus if they have a monthly ladies only tournament or meetup as long as they already qualify for our usual criteria (FNM and so on)"". Problem solved."
lrcast,3ajj0d,mtg_liebestod,3,Mon Jun 22 15:55:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like this idea. Maybe a free box of drafting product for hosting these kinds of events monthly. It's the sort of thing that stores need to do knowing that the first few months might be poorly attended. But I'm reminded of an saying from Field of Dreams...."
lrcast,3ajj0d,oraymw,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, and then my store cancels its legacy events for a ladies-only tournament. You don't see how this would create problems?  Any attempt to act like these proposals don't involve real transfers away from some players and to others is fundamentally dishonest. If getting more women involved were a free lunch, we wouldn't have to sit around and hand-wring about it."
lrcast,3ajj0d,mtg_liebestod,3,Sun Jun 21 23:36:46 2015 UTC,"There's always going to be competition between different kinds of events. If they cancel the event you like, then don't give them your patronage. BOOM SOLVED."

lrcast,3ajj0d,oraymw,2,Sat Jun 20 21:46:49 2015 UTC,"You can call that a solution if you want, but my point fundamentally is that I disagree with heavy-handed attempts to transfer resources towards female players at the expense of male players (or perhaps other female players who wouldn't be interested in these events.) If you're fine with this, there's a disagreement in values that I don't think is going to be hashed out here.  Also, I imagine that if you did see enclaves of resistance emerging in the community, this would not be interpreted as healthy pluralism, it would just lead to calls that Wizards gets more aggressive in stamping out male-dominated spaces. So it's not really a solution for the player who takes their patronage elsewhere if wherever they go just becomes the next target."
lrcast,3ajj0d,oraymw,3,Sat Jun 20 21:51:13 2015 UTC,"mtg_liebestod , your opinions on this issue regarding your concern of a ""heavy handed,"" ""top down"" approach are well documented in this thread. I know it's difficult to disagree strongly with a room of people and remain cool, so thanks for trying to keep this discussion issue focused, rather than spinning out into the typical internet troll-age. Being able to disagree in civil manner is extremely important for us to be able to have a productive dialogue.   I'm interested in why you feel so strongly about top down approaches in general? Have you had any personal experiences where you felt like these kinds of incentivized programs created more harm than good? Does this stem from your overall sense of history, or from personal experiences in your own political and social life? Can you cite examples of where this kind of practice backfired and can you usefully connect it to the issue that we're discussing? My thought is that your experiences might enlighten how we conceptualize what an ideal intervention might look like.  I'm sorry for putting you on the spot, but you're the lone voice of disagreement and you seem to be very passionate about the disagreement. I can tell you that there's absolutely 0% chance of changing my mind on this issue (I'm assuming that you feel the same way regarding your own opinions), however I'm interested in trying to understand why you feel so strongly.   Ultimately I don't see the harm in the attempt for a multi-faceted approach to diversify the player base. Even if it doesn't work the first time it will provide an opportunity to learn, revise, and try again. Clearly you do see a harm in this practice, a harm so great that you feel that it's not even worth trying to address. I'll just refer you now to my questions in the previous paragraph.  (unrelatedly, are you a Wagner fan? The Liebestod piece from Tristan und Isolde is one of my favorite pieces of music, not sure if you're referencing it. Nice to meet another opera fan if it is!)"
lrcast,3ajj0d,alwayswritegerl,2,Sat Jun 20 22:29:28 2015 UTC,"I think the most shocking thing for me in this thread is that you reference Wagner, but aren't a fan! :) My handle, by the way, references my favorite type of necktie knot, not how many cards I have to mulligan to on mtgo regularly.....  Seriously though. I think a couple interesting things come out of your comments. First, you presume that WotC always does what it can to increase their player base without costing them revenue. I feel like this is an impossible situation, given the fact that no entity is omniscient. I understand how that kind of assumption is useful for a theoretical model, but in actuality there are known-unknowns and unknown-unknowns that prevent this from being the case practically. It reminds me of the LR episode about in-game decision making. You seem to be talking about decisions based on the on-board information, but there's still a lot of unknowns that can change what the optimal play is. Your analysis defers to WotC as knowing what's in their best interest (I'm assuming because of a belief in their corporate responsibility to make money etc), however agents rarely have enough information to know what's in their best interest. Maybe all of this comes down to the fact that I spent my youth reading Sartre and Nietzsche and you spent yours reading Adam Smith? :)  I also think it's interesting how you define the goals of these kinds of strategies. Your definition defers to a number (a 50/50 split), however I think equally important is simply how people are treated, whether or not they feel welcome, whether or not they feel unfairly objectified. I would say that the goal is that anyone can come into an LGS and sit down at a table and not feel shitty or objectified. Yes, shitty things will always happen, but how can we asymptotically approach zero with regard to people feeling shitty? There's a lot of evidence that diverse social spaces do a lot to mitigate latent structures of prejudice (some of those were cited earlier).   Here and elsewhere you seem to assume a kind of zero-sum equation with regard to events and players. Like if we have more events for women, that means that there must be fewer events for others. Isn't it possible to just imagine more events overall? Or events firing simultaneously? I feel like your focus on equilibrium is restricting the set of possible options that a store (or corporation) may participate in.   There's another issue, tangentially economic, which concerns the goals of a corporation. Wizards is more than corporation, its product, Magic, is a community and they have a responsibility to both that community as a social structure and to their bottom line. I think that those responsibilities can benefit each other, but simply caring for the fiscal responsibility does not demand that they care for the social/community side. Because of this they need to make a concerted effort to tend to both the corporation and the community.  But again, I don't think any of this will change your mind. You're an economist and your analysis is motivated by a specific set of outcomes that are relevant for economics.  Granted, there are certainly economists that would disagree with your position, but that's probably besides the point.  I suppose my interest with this specific thread is trying to allow you to give the best version of your argument. Rendering this in economic terms helps a lot, unfortunately it doesn't help the shitty experiences that many players have to endure for completely arbitrary reasons. While you've expressed your sympathy to that end, and you've also given your acknowledgement that it is a problem, I don't feel like you've satisfactorily described a way to address this problem."
lrcast,3ajj0d,azotlenelli,3,Sat Jun 20 21:54:40 2015 UTC,"Why are you so hung up on it being a 50/50 split? I'm not sure anyone is saying that. (And if you have a link to someone who did, I'd be happy to see it)  All we want is for women to feel more comfortable at game stores and for numbers to increase.  If your central argument is against this pre-defined goal, then I think you have a misunderstanding of what many people are asking for."

lrcast,3ajj0d,carpeamentum,9,Sat Jun 20 21:59:29 2015 UTC,"Well, unsurprisingly I disagree with your disagreement. But that's okay. My sense is that when you write ""I don't think the problem of gender is so important in the community that..."" what you mean is that gender issues aren't a problem for you, or at least for your local community. Which is fine.  But the fact remains that as long as people are voicing concern about issues of sex and gender and magic it IS an issue. It's kind of a logical tautology, the evidence for sex/gender being an issue in magic is that sex/gender is an issue in magic (according to people who play the game). That you don't count yourself among those people is fine, but ultimately irrelevant."

Part of the reason that Lady Planeswalkers has been successful is that it's organized primarily by women, and is less ""women only night"" and more ""a night when a primarily female group gathers to play magic.""  One of the problems with this whole discussion is that it's been mostly men going back and forth on this, and in doing so many of those on both sides have missed the fundamental reality that such a discourse is based on assumption--we desperately need women's voices here.

I would object to WoTC sponsoring or subsidizing the event, much the way I would object if they did the same for a Men Only Night."
lrcast,3ajj0d,mtg_liebestod,0,Sat Jun 20 22:06:51 2015 UTC,"Some women like yourself would probably not enjoy a ladies only tournament. That's valid. However, for some women it is a mode of play that makes them much more comfortable entering the tournament scene. And it's not like this is just strange speculation; it has already been tested many times in the field, and been found to be successful. Here's a link to the Lady Planeswalkers website that gives an example of how this works.   These chapters have been very successful, they bring more women into the competitive scene, and they improve the environment of the stores that host them. liebestod would like to use scare tactics to make us think that this kind of thing is dangerous or that it will take rights away or that it will make men leave the game, but those kinds of logical fallacies are ridiculous when confronted with the facts about what happens when this is implemented in the real world instead of in someone's paranoid head."

Now what I did claim was that subsidizing these tournaments comes at a cost that we need to appreciate. Yeah, recognizing the existence of tradeoffs, now that's a real scare tactic.

lrcast,3ajj0d,mtg_liebestod,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:23:58 2015 UTC,"I think an important distinction to make regarding the specific examples are that   -the suggested ""Ladies Tournaments"" feels like men being patronizing and saying ""We know playing with us is hard for you.. here, just for you birds..."" -Whereas the lady planeswalkers feels like a bunch of women saying ""we will not tolerate your sexist bullshit here... ladies come here to play magic, we are putting a priority on your comfort"" (note they seem to accept men too though I haven't had the privilege to interact with a lady planeswalker group locally)  I think Wizards could certainly do something to support things like the Lady Planeswalkers Societies without setting up their own ladies only tournaments or the like."

I think that it would also be beneficial for WotC to provide some kind of incentive towards those groups. It would be similar to when WotC provides incentive towards EDH groups, or legacy groups, and things like that. The difference is that by increasing the amount of women playing the game, they are likely to dramatically increase revenue, which benefits everyone that plays Magic.  So, basically I think I agree."

I felt like I drafted a lack of spirits, and wanted more ways to support waxmane so I maindecked Terashi's Grasp which I haven't done before but it was fine everytime I drew it and the second got sideboarded in in a match as well. Scavenger Drake was decent but almost seemed like a win-more card.  Not sure how good it is in Spirits.    Crusher was just awful and a dead card everytime I drew him and decided to sideboard him out a lot.  Sunspear, Bat, and Raise the Alarm are kind of testament to this not being a great draft and just needing some creatures.  Sickleslicer seems decent to me and plays well with those other two cards.    In the sb Runed Servitor was close to a play.  I sideboarded it in for the Bat vs Bloodthirst.  Felt like I didn't really have good enough creatures to need to protect with Blessing.  Death Denied is an arcane but am not sure how good/bad it is.

Sign in Blood is a solid replacement--very playable in general. You're right that the Bat is not good in this deck, but Raise the Alarm is a great card in any white deck, and Sunspear is perfectly playable even with few ways to get him equipped. Others may disagree, but if you take out the Crusher I'd go down to 16 lands with that curve. Just an example of a simple but efficient/synergistic draft deck that can grind out wins."

I wouldn't consider it consistently better than a 4 drop until you have 16 hits, but the main problem is that these 2-3 drop creatures quickly become worthless, especially the creatures in Gx decks. It's not just about getting hits, it's about getting GOOD hits.  I can't recall a DDF decklist that would benefit from a Collected Company.

lrcast,3ag7d6,diabloblanco,3,Fri Jun 19 21:58:49 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right.  I should also point out that if you have a lot of cheap removal, you can afford a slightly heavier top-end, while if you have a lot of expensive removal, you should try to move your curve back toward the lower end."
lrcast,3ag7d6,Greyfeld,2,Fri Jun 19 23:19:18 2015 UTC,"For a generic format, yes, but formats matter a lot. The ideal 3x Gatecrash curve, for example, is: 18+ 1-2 drops."
lrcast,3ag7d6,5-s,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:19:48 2015 UTC,"It was either LRR or Numot who, as a draft challenge, only took 2-drops. I believe they 3-0ed."
lrcast,3ag7d6,diabloblanco,3,Sat Jun 20 18:26:32 2015 UTC,A general suggestion I heard is to have at least 8 board-affecting things to do off 3 or less mana.
lrcast,3ag7d6,Sceptilesolar,3,Fri Jun 19 22:11:41 2015 UTC,"I tend to disagree with the ""platonic"" drop listed my diablolic. I am in a similar situation to the OP and am finding more success with a slightly lower curve. You really only need a 2-3 creatures that cost more than 4 mana. You can very often win a game with a 4 drop.    In general, I am finding that the 3 mana slot is the most crucial in a value oriented, limited, creature based, mid range deck (which is the vast majority of limited decks). Your curve should definitely peak in the 3 CMC slot. This can be tough in the current DDF format since there are so many good 4 drop cards. The one thing going for you is the high volume of megamorphs which you can cast as a 3 drop. Whenever I construct my decks I follow Marshall's method of putting all the morphs in the 3 drop slot. This helps get my curve where I want it to be but also can end up sneaking in a few extra big dudes if you get lucky and happen to be able to flip some morphs, thus potentially giving you more  late game creatures. I think it is a mistake to expect to flip a morph though.    For a typical creature count (16-18) I would argue for the following:     1-2 mana: 4 (dont have to have 1 drops) 3 mana: 6 4 mana: 3-4 5 mana: 2-3 6+ mana: 1-2"
lrcast,3ag7d6,LarpingWombat,2,Sun Jun 21 17:20:53 2015 UTC,"During triple Khans, I would simply jam as many morphs in my deck as possible. Always worked out."

lrcast,3ag7d6,TheWrexial,2,Sat Jun 20 06:39:31 2015 UTC,"it's format dependent. In DDF my rule of thumb is 9 creatures I can cast turn three and earlier. 4 2 drops.  In m14, for example, casting divination on turn 3 is the best thing you can do and you actively don't want 2/2s for 2 in your deck.  When I draft monored in legacy cube I'm trying to go for around 6 one drops. I really want the beats to start early, though I include one mana bolts here since in that deck I really don't mind going t1 suspend rift bolt."

lrcast,3ag7d6,razorlead,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:46:58 2015 UTC,"It's going to depend on format and deck, but ideally you're looking for something to do on most turns of the game. Here are some examples of some of my draft decks that had decent curves:  (Modern Masters)[http://imgur.com/a/MuJ0D]  (Dragons)[http://imgur.com/a/RpZQQ]  My best rule of thumb when drafting, especially online, is to have your picks laid out by mana cost (move morphs into the 3 drop slot), and if you're debating between 2 cards in your colors, go with the lower casting cost or the place where your deck has a hole."
lrcast,3ag7d6,kccmtg,0,Tue Jun 23 14:01:02 2015 UTC,"Essentially, a curve is what it sounds like--when you lay out your creature spells by converted mana cost, they should form a sort of bell curve, with the bulk of the cards in the middle, at 3 or 4 mana.  As far as what to take, you need to consider what your deck needs as you draft. If, by the third pack, you realize that you're low on 3-drops, you should prioritize 3-drops over big expensive cards. If, on the other hand, you already have a good curve in your general card pool by pack 3, you can focus more on taking the best card for your deck.  it's all about paying attention to how well your draft has gone so you can understand where it needs to go."
lrcast,3afkzk,krdonnie,7,Fri Jun 19 18:58:04 2015 UTC,"If you're maximizing EV, delta is probably the pick, but it depends on the rest of your deck.   If you're maximizing win%, it's obviously between the other three, and it depends completely on the rest of your deck. In a vacuum, mastery > scaleguard > stance. By pack 3, there is no such thing as a vacuum though, so we can't really give any meaningful specific advice without seeing the whole deck. I guess the number of decks where mastery will be the best is greater than those that want scaleguard, which is more than stance, but whether your deck is one of those or not is another question."
lrcast,3afkzk,FinalCactus,3,Fri Jun 19 19:25:31 2015 UTC,I understand. I can provide the deck's final composition (I always SS my decks) and I can just pull out all the FRF cards once I'm on my home computer.

lrcast,3afkzk,pahamack,5,Sat Jun 20 03:42:17 2015 UTC,"The better your deck is, the better Scaleguard is compared to Mastery.  Mastery in play basically turns off the rest of your deck, meaning it improves your win percentage more in decks with weaker cards and less of a consistent plan.  Scaleguard is better in aggro, where Mastery can still be strong. Mastery gives opponent more time to find their bombs, where Scaleguard tends to end the game immediately.  According to what you said about your deck, I think Scaleguard would be a better fit."
lrcast,3afkzk,gild_for_kitten_pics,5,Fri Jun 19 19:36:31 2015 UTC,"If we disregard the money pick, I would take the mastery. It's just unbeatable in so many kinds of games.  That said, I'm taking the polluted delta every time, especially considering how cheap it is to draft DTK/FRF right  now. Giving up 5.5 tix (with sure upside if you wait on it) is crazy."
lrcast,3afkzk,mysticrudnin,3,Sat Jun 20 01:06:06 2015 UTC,"Elite Scaleguard is probably going to be the best in an aggressive deck, while Mastery is probably the best in anything not aggressive (and I'm not sure that it's not still better in an aggressive deck). They both win games, but Mastery will take over a game like few other cards while Elite Scaleguard needs some aggressive help."
lrcast,3afkzk,pahamack,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:12:55 2015 UTC,"These choices are interesting, because when we get them they are ""feel bad"" but the reality is that being able to choose between the absolute best cards in your color is going to make your deck absolutely sick - the choice is amazing, not bad."
lrcast,3afkzk,mysticrudnin,2,Fri Jun 19 23:33:33 2015 UTC,"it's bad because the only real choice is delta, and you're passing 2 bombs, plus a solid card. I'd rather the pack was a delta and a bunch of crap."

lrcast,3afkzk,mysticrudnin,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:04:56 2015 UTC,"I would always take the fetchland unless the stakes are high. taking value means you can draft more, and the stakes in an 8-4 are ridiculously low.   The prices of packs are so low that if you don't draft any money cards 2-1ing actually means you're losing money, since you're getting 2 dtk packs and 2 frf packs. The 1 frf pack you won is worth less than the 2 tix fee to enter.  Although, I've been on losing streaks where I just want to get on the win column so I pass the money card for something a lot stronger, but that's infrequent. In fact, in the last, say, 300 drafts, I remember passing a blue fetch just once, for a Dromoka the Eternal.  day 2 of a gp? Sure, pass the fetchland."

lrcast,3aftio,lbizfoshizz,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:10:11 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. I think there are times when Dragons can be a better option, especially when you're behind, so yes it's possible that that would have been correct. However, Khans is overwhelmingly the right choice like 90%+ of the time, that it's hard to see what that 10% is and be brave enough to do it then.  Also there were some cards that were pivotal to me winning the games, namely a dashed heelcutter + collateral damage game 1 and lose calm + temur battle rage game 2. It's hard to play around those when you don't know they're coming.  A few mistakes I believe my opponent made though was putting 4 counters on Vanguard instead of 2 and 2 on Attendant game 2, and maindecking a terrible card like Duress."

lrcast,3aathj,zBriGuy,8,Thu Jun 18 16:25:57 2015 UTC,"Bluffing is a pretty advanced decision and hinges on many different factors.  If I am Noah with the 2/4 lifelink flier and I am at 18 life I will never block the 2/2 flier because it is simply not worth it for me to risk my high value creature, but if I am at 4 or 6 and I feel like they are trying to get me into burn range I may call their bluff.    Being in white or green helps a lot with bluffing a trick.  Never bluff a trick that you wouldn't play in your deck or worse yet doesn't exist.    If you feel like you ""need"" to bluff attack to stay in the game it is probably too late.  Bluff attack early when the opponent is less concerned about their life total and more concerned about their board state.    Finally get a feel for how experienced your opponent is.  A complete novice will not be bluffable because they are only playing with known information, a slightly better player is bluffable because they think they are outsmarting you by playing around your trick even if it isn't correct, a slighltly better player than that could block because they think that fishing the combat trick out now so they don't have to play around it the rest of the game is correct, and finally a pro vs a pro may just both realize that there is an 80% chance that it is a bluff attack but a block is wrong because if the attacker mised the trick, the results would be devestating for the blocking player.    All in all, I would just say try it out.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but if you have never bluff attacked then you have definitely left some value on the table.    Start with thinking ""Would I block?"" and go from there."
lrcast,3aathj,bfro,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:08:06 2015 UTC,"I like the part about playing to the opponents skill level. I would just add that bluffing is also included in the body language/ect. If you sit up, lean forward, and attack without much time in thought (that turn) you can represent an trick to back it up much better."
lrcast,3aathj,taho_teg,7,Thu Jun 18 20:24:11 2015 UTC,"I think the thing here is that the 2/4 flier is really valuable. The 2/2 isn't super valuable. When you attack with the 2/2, few players are going to go 'I will trade this for your trick'. So they don't block. They, coupled with the fact that losing the 2/2 isn't even a big deal in this situation, could make you decide to bluff attack.   At least that's the logic. I'm not sure it's correct, but I can see where he's coming from!"
lrcast,3aathj,SirChuffly,2,Thu Jun 18 16:58:05 2015 UTC,"This is my problem with that reasoning: If I have a 2/2 flier and a combat trick, why would I attack it into a 2/4 lifelinker?   If I have a combat trick, and attack with the 2/2, my opponent doesn't block, and then swings back at me next turn, I'm still behind. On the other hand, if I have a combat trick, I leave back my flier, my opponent attacks into it, I can block and use my combat trick to kill his 2/4.   How do I make my opponent think I have a combat trick by doing the opposite of what I would do if I had a combat trick?"
lrcast,3aathj,CelestialBeekeeper,3,Fri Jun 19 02:48:01 2015 UTC,That's a huge disaster if your opponent has a removal spell or a combat trick. This is how you set yourself up for 2-for-1s.
lrcast,3aathj,Rhynocerous,0,Fri Jun 19 06:08:50 2015 UTC,"As opposed to them blocking when you attack in, then playing their removal/trick while yours is on the stack and blowing you out 2-for-1 anyway?"
lrcast,3aathj,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:48:23 2015 UTC,In this hypothetical the opponent is tapped out. During combat on their turn they won't be. Your opponent tapping out for dudes on their turn is pretty common in limited hence the conundrum of if they will block your bad creature when they've just cast their good creature. Also they will have seen an extra card and possibly hit another land drop on their turn.
lrcast,3aathj,Rhynocerous,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:57:18 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if they're tapped out.  You have to think about what you're doing beyond the current turn.  If you get into a game of flier tag with your opponent, he will win, because his has lifelink.  Sure you can ""bluff"" an attack, and he probably won't block, but that doesn't actually do anything for you.  All you've effectively done is give him free license to beat you in the head with his own flier, while his life total stays the same.  Bluffing an attack has its place, but bluffing a block can be just as important.  And I'd argue that, tapped out or not, making your opponent afraid to attack in is more important in this situation than making them afraid to block.  Unless you have an aggressive hand that needs the psychological opening created by convincing him not to block early enough that you can sneak in a bunch of damage under the radar.  But without the knowledge of the player's hand, we're looking at the board state in a bubble.  And in that bubble, keeping the status quo is more important than hitting for 2 damage."
lrcast,3aathj,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:02:20 2015 UTC,"Of course it matters if they're tapped out. Just because there are other factors involved in the decision doesn't mean access to mana doesn't matter. I would absolutely not recommend your play unless you believe you have no way to win the game without taking that risk, in which case the discussion is irrelevant."
lrcast,3aathj,Rhynocerous,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:05:55 2015 UTC,"How can you even consider, ""let my opponent beat on my face while his health doesn't even move"" to be a viable strategy for winning the game?"
lrcast,3aathj,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:09:13 2015 UTC,I'm operating under the assumption that there are other cards in our hands and decks. Taking huge risks the moment you are behind on board is a hilarious way to lose lots of a games. I don't really think you're capable of discussing this without being really hyperbolic so it's sort of a waste of time.
lrcast,3aathj,Rhynocerous,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:12:30 2015 UTC,"It's not hyperbole to ask a legitimate question.  You paint this idea of some nebulous ""something"" that one can do and ""some card"" one can play to make up for changing a bad tactical decision into a good one.  But we're talking about draft, not constructed.  The chances of drawing into the exact card you need to blow your opponent out when they have the upper hand on the board are drastically lower.  Now, if you want to paint a more specific scenario that we can discuss, I'd be glad to have that discussion.  But you can't just wave your hand and claim you win because ""something, maybe, probably"" and you automatically become correct.  Bluffing is important whether you're the attacker or the defender, and refusing to accept that only hinders your own development as a drafter."
lrcast,3aathj,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"I only just now realized that this comment wasn't in response to the one I thought it was.  To clarify, I was talking about it happening on the next turn.  You attack in on this turn, they don't block, next turn you attack again, they do block, you combat trick, they blow you out with removal because they're now untapped, then they proceed to beat you in the face with their flier, unchecked."
lrcast,3aathj,Greyfeld,2,Fri Jun 19 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"When your opponent attacks he'll have mana up, which makes it much easier for him to blow you out. Additionally if you do it on your turn, you can always use the mana on something else.  Again I don't really think this is a good bluff just to get in 2 points of damage. However, you probably -do- get in 2 points of damage because there's really no way they'll risk their flier."
lrcast,3aathj,SirChuffly,5,Fri Jun 19 08:19:54 2015 UTC,"A bit of wisdom from poker: if you never get caught bluffing, you're not bluffing enough."
lrcast,3aathj,procumbo,3,Thu Jun 18 21:24:06 2015 UTC,"since the 2/4 flier has lifelink.  I wouldn't block and so I'd just swing next turn to get the life back.  If it was just a 2/4 flier no Lifelink, I'd probably block (if I'm behind on life) and trade for your trick unless I have an instant speed removal in hand that I can use when I untap."
lrcast,3aathj,TabinD3,3,Thu Jun 18 17:31:46 2015 UTC,"If you haven't yet, listen to episode 288, because LSV's stuff about being able to afford to play around cards is very relevant here.  Say that eating a 2/2 flyer for free gives you a +5% bump on your equity to win the game. Also say that losing a 2/4 lifelink flyer (one of your best creatures) to a combat trick means you lose -15-20% equity for that game. In that case, blocking means you only get marginally ahead in a game you were already winning while risking actually falling behind, while not blocking ensures that you remain ahead. So in that situation it is correct not to block, even if you're 99% sure your opponent doesn't have the trick. Try to think of it as you actually getting more value from NOT blocking the 2/2 as opposed to blocking.  Now, if you're the opponent, as long as you can be reasonably confident that the player with the 2/4 is doing this calculation (e.g. late stages of a PPTQ, a GP, playing against local endboss Noah Weil) then it becomes correct to attack, because it's a bad block on their behalf."
lrcast,3aathj,RatherSallad,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:25:43 2015 UTC,"While I agree with this analysis, I think this line is incorrect:   Now, if you're the opponent, as long as you can be reasonably confident that the player with the 2/4 is doing this calculation (e.g. late stages of a PPTQ, a GP, playing against local endboss Noah Weil) then it becomes correct to attack, because it's a bad block on their behalf.   I think it's also important to take into account bluffing a trick while you're on the defensive.  If your opponent has a 2/4 lifelink flier, and your only flier is a 2/2, then you're going to lose if you just keep swinging into their face for 2 every turn.  Because they'll just do the same on their own turn, and you'll repeatedly lose 2 health while they stay at the same life total.  On the other hand, if you hold back your flier to bluff a block with a combat trick, you can increase your chance to win by maintaining the status quo long enough to actually dig for an answer to his 2/4 lifelink flier.  So while I think bluffing an attack has its place, I think that being willing to bluff a block is equally important."
lrcast,3aathj,Greyfeld,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:53:03 2015 UTC,"The problems with not attacking and hoping to bluff a block is a) you have to leave mana open, preventing you from continuing to develop your board to the best of your ability, b) not putting pressure on your opponent means they are under no pressure to start attacking back and gaining the life and c) because your creature gets eaten by default, your opponent doesn't need to actually do anything until you play  something to swing the trade in your favor, in which case they can respond with their own combat trick/removal spell, leading to a nice little 2 for 1.  I'm assuming also that the status quo of you leaving your guy back and neither player attacking is ultimately bad for you, since a 2/4 scales better into the late game than a 2/2. I think it's better to attack, continue to develop your board and try to put enough pressure on that the +2 life a turn isn't enough to keep up."
lrcast,3aathj,RatherSallad,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:01:19 2015 UTC,"I think bluff attacking requires you to do a SWOT analysis. What strengths does it have? Do you have open mana and you opponent need their 2/4 to hold off a 6/1? Weakness, Do they have mama up that would make them fearless of a trick? What do you get by attacking, is the 2 life relevant? Is your creature relevant? How will you win the game with and without your creature? Is your opponent scared? Are they fearless? Who is the beat down?  I assume that if they call my bluff they will call the next time. You can use this to set them up. Most people don't evaluate independently. Sunk cost is not a thing people consider often. If they behave one way and it works out for them, they will repeat. This is why I like offering trades early because you get a sense of their character."
lrcast,3aathj,americanextreme,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:05:45 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends. I attacked with seeker of the way into 2/3s ALL THE TIME in KTK limited. I don't think anyone ever called me on it. But in that case it's different because the blowout is so much bigger - you use one spell to kill a creature, and prowess turns the block into a chump block netting a 2-for-1  However, with prowess going evergreen, this may be much more relevant."
lrcast,3aathj,CogMonocle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:44:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is wise to attack even if you have a trick up your sleeve. What are the chances your opponent blocks? If they don't, they just swing back and their life total remains the same.   On the other hand, if you don't attack and have a trick, you could block their flyer and use it. If they don't attack at all, at least your life total doesn't change."
lrcast,3aathj,Arbormala,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:04:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think bluffing is usually correct. Without knowing your opponent's hand and temperament you don't know how highly they value their card. In your specific situation, how much does two life matter when the opponent gains it back with an attack the following turn? Not much. Definitely not worth throwing away a card IMO."
lrcast,3aathj,QuixoticMcGee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:05:33 2015 UTC,"You can never be sure what your opponent is going to do, but as an LR disciple I say always go for the high value play.  These are the questions I ask myself before bluff attacking:   How likely is your opponent to block?  Note they are much more likely if they're at a low life total, aren't thinking about combat tricks (often associated with being inexperienced), or if they can get a read on you What do you gain from attacking?  You can accomplish 2 things with a bluff attack:  1) Get in extra damage that could matter later down the road or 2) misdirect your opponent about what's in your hand.  Even if you're a control deck and don't care much about life totals there is always some amount of value to a successful bluff What do you lose if your opponent calls?  What value could this creature provide later on in the game?   Most importantly, I try to do this on my opponent's turn: tanking for a long time before a suspect attack will often cause your opponent to call."

I just... don't see any reason to play those strategies when BW Spirits, BG Sacrifice, GW Tokens, the rare mono-W affinity, and Green-based 4-5 color are so much better than anything base Red or Blue. That means passing a few Bolts, Bursts, and Narcolepsy's but... synergy is key in this format and even mildly synergistic decks seem to win out."

lrcast,3abe03,priceQQ,2,Fri Jun 19 10:28:14 2015 UTC,"I'm finding the opposite for myself - I'll pick a cool rare 1st pick (etched champion, for example) and want to go one way but then people will just ship me a card 5th or 6th that should never still be there and I'll move into a completely different archetype. I think my best drafts have been when I jump into a different archetype in the middle of pack 1 and just go with it. You can get some ridiculous wheels in this format too.

lrcast,3a9zcp,Kaelvar,2,Thu Jun 18 12:09:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the Esper build is much stronger. [[Necromaster Dragon]] is an all-out bomb and [[Flatten]], [[Douse in Gloom]], [[Butcher's Glee]], and [[Coat in Venom]] make up for [[Twin Bolt]], [[Roast]], and [[Sarkhan's Rage]].  If early game was an issue, you have options like [[Palace Familiar]], [[Arashin Cleric]], [[Sultai Skullkeeper]], and [[Sidisi's Faithful]].  In fact, I think I would have taken out the [[Marsh Hulk]] for either [[Palace Familiar]] or [[Sidisi's Faithful]] to shift some black into blue."
lrcast,3a9zcp,kccmtg,2,Thu Jun 18 12:46:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  With the naya build you're playing some awful cards that don't do anything in sealed.

lrcast,3a9zcp,mrcjtm,2,Thu Jun 18 12:46:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would cut most of the white. I would play base UB, splashing white for like 4 cards: Mastery, Pacifism, Sandblast, and Stance. Myth Realized is kind of meh. The white creatures are fine, but they're not necessary. I would replace 5 white cards with Palace Familiar, Sidisi's Faithful, Sultai Skullkeeper, Sibsig Icebreakers, and Tasigur's Cruelty. Then play 18 lands with 8 black sources, 8 blue sources, and 5 white sources. I would also consider cutting one of Coat with Venom or Butcher's Glee -- you don't have a ton of creatures, so it's risky to play combat tricks that might have no target.  The problem is that your white and black are VERY creature light. Blue has more of a creature curve, so you replace the white creatures with the blue ones and splash white instead of splashing blue."
lrcast,3a9zcp,chimpfunkz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:33:40 2015 UTC,"Splashing white for Mastery isn't even that good, since while mastery is ridiculous, it is much much worse if you can't activate it multiple times a turn."
lrcast,3a9zcp,mrcjtm,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:03:34 2015 UTC,"Yah I don't disagree with that. Though if you're getting to 8 lands with this deck, I like your chances whether or not you have 2 white producing lands by then. That said, it could be correct to just run 2 pacifism, 1 sandblast, 1 stance as your white splash. Or heck, even 1 pacifism, 1 sandblast, 1 stance, and go with mainboard encase in ice."
lrcast,3a9zcp,chimpfunkz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:33:01 2015 UTC,"Going with just the removal definitely seems correct (or more correct). 2 pacifisms, sandblast, and valorous stance + 3 or 4 white sources would be better than trying to run the mastery. Mastery just requires you to have multiple white sources in play to activate it multiple times a turn."
lrcast,3ab41f,magicbeardo,4,Thu Jun 18 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"Would take Burst Lightning. It's the best card in that pack by a reasonable margin, and WR is a great place to be."

lrcast,3a96en,raincometh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:39:42 2015 UTC,"What are your morph/manifests? and what relevant cards are in your deck?   Assuming generic 2/2s and no relevant cards, I swing with all but the hexproof flier, savage punch the morph with my morph, then do two to their remaining morph, one to sage with arc lightning. You can't get blown out by them flipping, and your hexproof creature won't be removed. They might use a trick to save their sage, in which case you block a generic 1/1 next turn if they swing in presenting a trick (unlikely they have two tricks). If they happen to have two tricks, you trade for it with your 2/2 hexproof flier, and they stay behind on board.   If they block your morph with one of theirs, fine, attempt to arc lightning the remaining two creatures post combat. If they block and cast a trick, well, we don't know what happens since we don't know what your morph is. This is fairly unlikely though since you have enough untapped mana to flip all the relevant 5 mana morphs and blow them out most of the time (if they have enough mana to cast their trick to push through lethal, they won't use that to kill your morph/save theirs. If they do, you can still do the savage punch/arc lightning line on their other two creatures, leaving up your hexproof flier). Their deck seems aggressive so it's less likely that they're running kill shot, but if they are, they kill your morph and don't get any prowess bonus from it since the sage doesn't block your flyer and they're still behind on board.   EDIT: apparently it's jeering instigator. That's an easy line. you steal jeskai sage, then savage punch their weaponmaster with the sage, killing both and drawing a card.

Just to reiterate, your use of ""endless"" in this case carried a negative connotation.  I think you meant this connotation based on your follow-up comments, so it seems incorrect for you to tell people they are interpreting your statement wrong.  If you would like me to respond to your specific comments and why I disagree I'm happy to do that. However, in this case I jumped into the conversation because I thought that your accusation of snargaggle was out of place.

lrcast,3a6ftf,zvazda,-5,Wed Jun 17 21:46:07 2015 UTC,"Telling victims of harassment that they have to be more positive and provide solutions is not acceptable.   Why? I'm not saying that the harassment is acceptable  (it's not in any way), but just spouting anger doesn't help anything.   Yes, victims have every right to be angry. But you can't deny that anger without purpose or direction is pointless. Just being upset, while it us comforting to vent and get support, doesn't do a single thing to solve the problem. Complaining in and of itself does nothing to give a victim any agency in a situation like this. Empowering someone who is harassed requires some kind of action. Even a victim is capable of taking action and taking their agency back. Sometimes they need a reminder that they aren't powerless.   Edit: anyone want to provide a rebuttal for this argument? Or are we just going to give a fussy downvote if we don't like what others have to say?"

lrcast,3a6ftf,zvazda,-1,Thu Jun 18 03:09:32 2015 UTC,"First of all, i think the use of the term complaining is reductive and damaging.   Many times it is just complaining, though. Yes, the harassment is wrong. Yes, the culture needs to change. What I'm saying is that writing articles about it on the Internet and expecting other people to do all the work is not solving the problem. Calling it complaining is meant to stir up action, to call out the fact that what someone is doing doesn't really solve the problem. Feeling good about telling the internet that harassment is wrong doesn't do anything to stop the individual person, store, or community from doing it at the next FNM.    they are standing up for themselves and saying ""This is not OK.""   Doing so on the Internet does nothing tangible to stop the person who actually harassed you. Unless that person by chance reads the article and then comes to the conclusion that they were wrong, you've done nothing to solve your acute problem. That's where it drops from useful awareness to complaining. We all know that harassment is still a bit of a problem. It doesn't even hurt to have periodic reminders if it isn't getting better (which it is, albeit slowly). None of that fixes anything though. That's the point I've been making. You have to take direct and tangible action in order to make real progress on these issues.   (And for the downvoters coming through this thread- drive-by downvotes don't change my opinions. Real arguments do. Internet points are meaningless. Just like feeling good about a card doesn't make it a good card, the same is true for debate. Just because you don't like someone's point, doesn't mean it's a bad point. Dismissing and argument because of feelings is like sticking with a bad card because you like it- your deck is still worse off for including it)"
lrcast,3a6ftf,CaptainDiamond39,4,Thu Jun 18 13:29:24 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm not sure what articles you're referring to, but I disagree with your assessment that taking the time to write a persuasive article is not useful and is not work. In many ways, it's more work than having a simple conversation with a TO.  I also take issue with your assumption that writing an article somehow precludes taking action IRL. People can do both.  I think if you look at the amount of comments and discussion that some of the articles have sparked it's hard to say that they aren't doing anything.  Discrimination and harassment comes from lack of education and lack of empathy. Articles help both of these things, and they are useful for asking the greater community to not accept this in their community.  Again, I'm not sure what specific examples you have in mind (though it seems clear that you do), but I do want to emphasize that I do think that when people feel comfortable speaking up they should do that.  When they feel comfortable speaking up to their harasser they should do that.  When they feel comfortable speaking up to the TO they should do that.  Sometimes they aren't going to feel comfortable doing that and they speak up to the internet.   You seem pretty concerned about your downvotes and I would guess that they came because you seem to be putting a lot of onus on the abused and insisting that they do what you would be comfortable doing in a situation that no one should be placed in."

There are a lot of ways to affect change. You point out one way, but you should realize that while you may feel empowered to speak to a shop owner, particularly if that owner shares traits with you (e.g., male) others may not. Those who face oppression in that individual's shop may not feel confident that their concerns will be heard. After all, the incidents are occurring within that TO's store, so the TO should be aware of it if they're paying attention. When these issues continue without being checked by that TO, they show tacit approval of that behavior, which only adds to feelings of hopelessness about the potential for change. I'm unsure why you believe it is up to those who are oppressed to be responsible for affecting change. They can bring attention to it in a way they feel comfortable, which is being done, but they rarely have the power (because they're not of the empowered class) to actually make that change happen."

This statement is invalid if you only apply it sometimes and DON'T apply it other times.  I think the correct line of thought is... I saw him play a bolt last game.  There is a chance he has a bolt which will just kill me if I take 3.  I should assume he has it.  He has another card in hand.  What could it be?  What mana does he have open?  It could be a pump spell, burst lightning, remand, mana leak, stoic rebuttal, etc.  Does he have mana for both?  What other option do I have?

Truly excellent players pull wins out of nowhere all the time in my experience.   Learn to anticipate your opponents. Memorize all the cards you're playing with and keep them in mind at all times.  Play around likely tricks and have a backup plan when you can't afford to do do it.  Most of all, get a feel for when to bluff. Get inside your opponent's head and lay waste to them with ""risky"" plays when the time is right.   For example, if I've shown my opponent I have 2 giant growths in the deck game 1, I'll often start acting like I have one in hand even when I don't, or I'll act like I have nothing for a couple of turns, and then switch strategies out of the blue like I just drew something. This throws your opponent off balance and can result in several ""free"" points of damage.  Last of all, watch your own replays, think about what you did right and wrong, be aware of your mistakes as much as possible and don't repeat them later. I like to keep track of the damage I took because I feared a trick and the damage I didn't deal because I missed an attack, sometimes the totals are quite staggering."

lrcast,3a4qro,SirChuffly,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:32:25 2015 UTC,"I'd say that in the real world the stats are more skewed than that, even. The thing is you might have a 55% win chance on average, but against the best deck in a pod (which you're theoretically going to have to beat to 3-0) it's much lower. So your win wait in the 2-0 finals is going to be below that, reducing your chances at 3-0.  Similarly chances to 2-1 probably go up a little bit, because if you lose early you're more likely to meet a slightly weaker deck? I'm not sure if this is as pronounced."

For instance, if you win 1/5 drafts (something like a 58.5% match win rate), then you've still got about a 10% chance to only win one in a streak of 10 drafts. Variance can hit very hard when we're talking about things with low odds like this. For every time you put together back-to-back draft wins, assuming your actual draft win rate stays stable over a larger sample, it takes quite the dry spell to even things out."

If you get mana screwed and lose vs a terrible player i imagine you lose a tonne of points.

No wonder it took so long for the queue to fire.

My first two opponents were both playing Court Humonculus which I'm pretty sure is seldom correct in Sealed. The first opponent had a Cranial Plating and Myrsmith to pair with it which looked a little scary but it still fell quite short of being a solidly aggressive Affinity deck.

lrcast,3a2wp9,TabinD3,2,Wed Jun 17 07:50:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  That average seems about right. And yes, I think it gives an advantage to be able to be consistently playing regularly. But I don't think it's unattainable  otherwise. Even with all of this experience in the format I still don't feel like I'm that far ahead of the competition. I still draft garbage decks at times. I think that's my biggest weakness is variance in the draft. I feel like my play, while still having a lot of room for improvement, is at least consistent whereas I can come out of the draft with junk occasionally."
lrcast,3a2wp9,procumbo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:40:11 2015 UTC,Thank you for the answer.  I'm trying to evaluate my own performance and manage expectations. Your experiences gives me data for that :)
lrcast,3a2wp9,TabinD3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:00:12 2015 UTC,What are the biggest leaps of understanding the format you've made since you started drafting MM15?
lrcast,3a2wp9,TabinD3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:32:36 2015 UTC,"Initially playing on Cockatrice things were a mess. I remember my first deck, not being completely familiar with the spoiler, consisted of some early pick Viashino Slaughtermasters. I figured Jund must be an archetype if these are here, I guess I'll get in on it. Yikes.  I also remember drafting Skyhunter Skirmishers in some sort of blue/white flyerish deck. Something else that sticks out are Burst Lightnings being passed very late and my not respecting Profane Command. It got to the point where I wouldn't even pick it early since I was seldom running it or getting value out of it. Thank you LSV for setting me straight.  By the paper release one of the decks I liked that I still have some respect for was UGx 4-5 color Graft/Sunburst/Proliferate. Being able to Graft & Proliferate an Etched Oracle is pretty great.  I think what's best now is just staying open and finding your lane. Pick cards that can fit into multiple archetypes. The payoffs for going all in P1p1 on Wilt-Leaf Liege or Overwhelming Stampde are very few and far between. Though I think that's especially since LSV & Marshall have been advocating for GW tokens so heavily. Don't get me wrong, it's a great deck. But it was an amazing deck a couple weeks ago while it was lower on the radar. Now Scatter the Seeds are gone by pick 2 and Nest Invader & Kozilek's Predator are about the same. I've often picked an Overwhelming Stampede over another card that was more likely to make a final deck (Lightning Bolt, Nameless Inversion) and regretted it.  The biggest issue I still face is drafting decks that fail to come together. I suppose that's about the worst thing that can happen for anyone, but even with all my experience I still find it hard to avoid. I think part of my issue is I'm not as good as I think some are at toggling to the 5 color deck. I've done it before where I'm on an archetype and start shifting gears when things dry up, but I seldom come into the actual reasons to end in 5 color.   An archetype I really like lately is UGr (or 4-5 color, similar to what I mentioned above) focusing on Graft, Thrummingbird, and Bloodshot Trainee. All of the cards tend to go pretty late and I found it pretty easy to live the dream during my matches with Vigean Graftmage (can get these next to last pick) + Bloodshot Trainee. If you get a couple Trainees pick up a Darksteel Axe or Sickleslicer as well for 4 power insurance (the equips aren't bad for getting them in the air with a Thrummingbird either.) It leads to some interesting deck building choices where you're debating putting in a subpar card like Thrive to make sure you have enough ways to enable your Trainees. I don't think it's the best archetype but graft tends to be underdrafted from what I've seen. I wouldn't force any deck but this one may be easy to get in on when you get 3rd/4th pick Trainee / Frogling or something similar.  One thing I'll add is that while the aggro decks (Rakdos, Boros, Affinity) can be crushing, they can also sputter out pretty hard. Stumbling on the colored lands you need or missing some early drops can put you way behind. I still think it's correct to be in these decks fairly often but I'm more inclined to try to start getting into some more controlling, less archetype-specific, builds like LSV's Izzet control brew.   At this point I've played the format a lot but know that I'm still a long way off from mastering it. I'm humble in the success I've had and each time I enter a draft queue I'm a little worried that it could be yet another time where the deck doesn't quite get to a solid build. Maybe part of the issue is all the fixing here. I think it makes it much harder to find strong signals and settle in on the right deck early."
lrcast,3a2wp9,shinianx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:08:07 2015 UTC,"You mention that GW or GB token decks are more and more popular now.  Bloodshot doesn't seem super strong against a token deck, but I could be wrong.  What strategies do you have against token decks?  I can really only think of two cards...savage twister and the black -1/-1 spell.  Do you side in counterspells for the Overwhelming stampeed/team buff spells?  Do you win the game via flying over the air?"

Even when they play terribly. [Attached pic] [Imgur rehost]     This message was created by a bot  [Contact creator][Source code]
lrcast,3a2m8c,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Wed Jun 17 23:32:14 2015 UTC,"Yesterday I had a similar experience to yours: drafted a rather clunky 3-color deck but at least with enough fixing and some powerful cards. One opponent was extremely salty claiming that he'll uninstall the game if he loses against me. Declined my proposition to buy his collection after he did :P  Here is what I drafted, btw, it didn't go my way exactly to have a good GW tokens deck: http://mtg-draftviewer.rhcloud.com/view/1434460566487/1/1 but rather 3-4 color controllish deck, went 2-1  All in all, it's a bit enterntaining when people tilt over such things as an mtg match. I think it takes away a lot of concentration from them when they do. Why complain in the chat that you drew 8 lands and 2 spells, when you could hold two of those lands and I'd be much less inclined to attack into your blockers?"
lrcast,3a2m8c,MadMetalist,2,Wed Jun 17 13:42:12 2015 UTC,"you have precisely the right attitude about this sort of thing. In fact, I'd say you don't go far enough. Opponents being salty isn't just entertaining, it is the BEST thing about MTGO. When I don't get any salt from my opponents, after a while I start missing it.   It's like what Conan said. ""To crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, to hear the lamentation of their women"". MTGO salt is equivalent to that last bit.  Everyone gets salty about this game. It truly is unfair sometimes. You know what the last thing I want is when I feel this way? The last thing I want is for my opponent to know about it. These people don't get that."
lrcast,3a2m8c,pahamack,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:46:20 2015 UTC,"Frankly, we had a lot of fun during that draft: I drafted with a buddy of mine (and a far better magic player), and even though the draft itself didn't go our way, we tried to squeeze the most out of our deck. Yes, it was clunky, yes, it wasn't super-synergistic, but hey its like using a pen in a street fight: anything goes, and when I get into trouble I can poke someone eye's out, you just don't control such things, it's about survival.  Here is the deck, btw http://s14.postimg.org/nzw0hv0kh/domain_tokens.png  After losing the first round to a good deck, it was really important for us to just hang in there, because otherwise we won't even get to play another round (people just drop from 6-2-2-2 queues after two losses)! So what I'm trying to say, it could seem to our opponent that our deck is crap and we don't know what we are doing, and thats what tilted his/her ego. Sure, it took us some luck of our opponent to get flooded, to scrap that win in game 3, but its not like our draws were super good either. Yet we didn't complain that we can't get a gazzillion forests with our primeval titan and then play Wolfbriar Elemental kicked for gazillion-2, and just had to decide to play it with one kicker, because that's what we needed with the current board state! instead of waiting for few more turns hoping our three-color deck can deliver more forests.  We kept playing magic and making decisions, concentrated on the board state and kept thinking what's that last card in opponent's hand can be. Only after our enemy was crushed as you put it, we took time to read enormous amount of messages, which again had no constructive criticisms, but simply an egoistic reaction to not winning the match that s/he thought s/he deserved, and blaming it on one thing or another, not giving us any credit and implying we didn't deserve our win. I simply start poking them back, probably tilting them even more, I don't think it's the right attitude though, but I couldn't resist at that time, we were laughing real hard at these hateful comments. And frankly somewhere deep inside I don't mind if such a person uninstalls the game.  When playing chess, I learned to never underestimate your opponent. Despite the difference in ratings, you can lose on the spot to some intricate combination, a hole in your knowlegde of the openings or simply slowly losing strategically turn after turn, losing the initiative at some point. I think we need same attitude in magic community: make it the best out of every situation, try to win every game and think about every card you can side in or out to improve your chance of winning, but if it doesn't go your way, give your opponent some credit to having a deck that managed to go under yours or his decision making wrt to what hands to keep, etc, analyze and try to learn something.  Even if it would seem the opponent's deck looks unassuming, there was some reasoning behind him playing low-power cards (if it is in his/her deck, it serves some purpose!)"
lrcast,3a2m8c,MadMetalist,2,Thu Jun 18 08:56:06 2015 UTC,"It seems like every time I first pick Overwhelming Stampede over a solid splashable card I regret it. Today's train wreck. I think numerous mistakes were made with this one.  I encounter players with poor attitudes less than 5% of the time. When they do come up I think they've already set themselves up for defeat by carrying this poor attitude with them. This aura of negativity can cloud their judgment during draft and gameplay, thus BW Eldrazi decks.  This isn't representative of MTGO though it gets a bad wrap for it since the client doesn't lend itself to players interacting with one another. The jerks tend to catch attention since there's so little chat interaction that happens otherwise. I occasionally try to strike up a conversation with my opponents, especially if I can tell they're a high rated player. I try to look for the small opportunities to discuss strategy with some like-minded folks when the opportunity comes up."
lrcast,3a2m8c,transcensionist,3,Wed Jun 17 15:42:59 2015 UTC,I love MTGO but one of the best parts of paper drafting is talking to your opponents about their decisions and plays. No one in real life would ever act this way.

They also accused me of making play mistakes, and even cited a specific number. They drew too many lands, you see, and I was ""better lucky than good."" I guess houts has turned trolling into a science.  The point is, MTGO is full of unhelpful, salty trolls. I wouldn't expect much positive criticism, so I wouldn't bother. Just post here instead.

lrcast,3a2m8c,FinalCactus,5,Tue Jun 16 20:51:33 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really after proper expert advice, but it's always good to at least know what people thought were mistakes. i looked through the games and played well. I found a few things that might have appeared to be mistakes if you didn't see my hand. I missed 2 points of damage because i wanted to scatter the seeds with only 4 mana.  I also used stampede when he had a bunch of cards and mana up with the rationale that i just win if he has nothing of importance, and i lose if the game goes on much longer, and he can't blow me out too much unless he has multiple relevant answers to it. As it happened he decided to take 6 damage instead of 3 there to kill my 2/2 instead of my 1/1 which ultimately lead to him losing.  I like to chat when playing magic, as it's my bit of fun for the day. I play online poker professionally, and you get all sorts of abuse in the chat, but you have to keep civil as it's your profession and you have to keep the bad players amused, so i don't mind chatting to people complaining to me in magic, it's kind of cathartic to me.  As to my deck, i literally had no other playables in GW, so splashing the burst lightnings were def. correct. The big choice was to go GR instead, which i sideboarded into in the mirror in the final. I had a bunch of mediocre red cards, and some blue cards also. Maybe GR splashing oblivion ring and arrest would have been a better deck."

It's just so hard to remind your brain that you actually need to perform as well as possible in every event you enter in order to get the kind of EV you need in order to play the game for free. Going 5-0 in these events makes up for a lot more match losses, so you really need to squeeze out that last round in order to get the results you want.   Too bad our brain's hate us :D"
lrcast,3a0hg4,oraymw,4,Tue Jun 16 08:17:37 2015 UTC,"This is really the same basic phenomenon as tilt. Tilt is when negative thoughts or emotions take your attention away from the game and hijack your rational thought processes. The ""in the money"" effect is the same thing, except with positive emotions.  Figuring out how to overcome psychological barriers to performance and improve your ""mental game"" is very important in Magic (and probably deserves an entire LR show). I know this is a theme that gets talked about constantly in other sports I've participated in that need mental focus, like golf and archery.  Here are some tips for improving mental game that I've found helpful:   Every time you practice (FNM, MTGO, playtesting), be aware of your mental state and try to practice having that ""in the zone"" frame of mind you want to have at tournaments. Then, at the start of every match in a tournament, try to take yourself back to that ideal mental state you practiced. It can help to imagine yourself physically sitting and playing a game in the place where you normally practice. You should repeat this exercise if you start to feel tilted; return to that mental state you practiced. Set process-oriented goals instead of results-oriented goals. ""I want to play as perfectly as I possibly can at this tournament"" instead of ""I want to win this tournament."" You only have direct control over one of those two things. Get a good night's sleep before the tournament (unless you're a redeye junkie like LSV). Pack and eat lots of healthy and high-energy food (fruit, jerky, granola). Drink water. If you miss the lunch break and you forgot to pack food, your mental state is going to suffer. Most people get ""hangry"" and have a hard time focusing when their blood glucose levels are low. This might seem like silly or obvious advice but it has a huge effect, especially late in the day."
lrcast,3a0hg4,bitterrootmtg,2,Tue Jun 16 14:00:04 2015 UTC,"This is an issue for a lot of people in Poker also. It all comes down to developing discipline - it's really what separates the good players from the great.   You talk about how you played sloppily because you ""already achieved your goal."" Well, sounds like you need a new goal then. Your goal shouldn't be to go 4-1 or 5-0. Your goal should be to play each match to the best of your ability. Not only is this goal better, it's more reasonable and achievable. You can go 0-5 while still playing to the best of your ability. That's why it's such a worthy goal - your final match score is irrelevant."
lrcast,3a0hg4,gregariousbarbarian,2,Tue Jun 16 14:10:12 2015 UTC,That goal is also much harder to measure/quantify. You should go for goals where you can do these things.

lrcast,3a0hg4,gregariousbarbarian,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:36:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is very noble. It's still hard to quantify though. Results do have a correlation with how well you are playing. Not a perfect correlation, because of variance, but there is a correlation. If you're ending up with jank decks all the time and 0-3ing, chances are there's something wrong with how you're drafting.  the entire point of trying to get better is because you're gonna get results in the long run. If you're not getting results, you're probably not playing well.  Winning a lot is a decent barometer for playing well, especially if you're playing against good competition. Pros have said repeatedly that the competition in MTGO is pretty good. Folks there play a lot.  Remember: Goals should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound. ""Playing well"" is nebulous. It isn't specific, measurable, or time-bound. Trying to get to 4 wins to qualify is all of these things. Saying you shouldn't be looking at the score sounds like some sort of guru-esque platitude but it's unrealistic. Should you keep playing at 0-2? Without stakes in the tournament and nothing on the line you're not sure if your opponent is trying as hard as they should be."

Good books on the subject of tilt by Jarod Tendler (about poker, but applicable to magic) called 'The Mental Game of Poker'.  Look out for it also in games where you are way ahead. People have a tendancy to play the worst possible magic when they are almost certain of victory.  The first step is noticing that you are doing it, so well done for that."

The big names above are all popular for good reason, but with the smaller streams it's easier to interact with the streamer if you want to discuss plays, deck choices etc. for active learning.

lrcast,39z3d7,punninglinguist,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:59:38 2015 UTC,how do you guys know when the drafting portion starts on twitch?  Logging into twitch to find someone streaming mid-game just doesn't seem that exciting to me.
lrcast,39z3d7,TabinD3,0,Wed Jun 17 21:15:46 2015 UTC,"Eric will sometimes hop on for a draft/Vintage on my channel http://www.twitch.tv/elantris. Catching him is very hit or miss though.   We also tend to watch Standard/Vintage Super League together on Tuesday nights, and Magic tournament coverage on the weekends. Gerry (G3RRYT), Paul (HAUMPH), and MJ (darkest_mage)  play constructed fairly regularly, and stream early afternoon into the evening on weeknights."
lrcast,39zafc,Airymon,2,Tue Jun 16 00:19:47 2015 UTC,"I can't look at the rare draft right now, but you probably felt like you were flooding because you've got a lot of mana going on. Bauble, sphere, 2 fiery falls and 17 lands is a lot (especially when 4 are Karoos). As a rule of thumb, I've heard that for every 2 bounce lands, you can get away with playing one less land. 15 may seem light here, but I'd probably go down to 16 and maybe even 15 on the draw."
lrcast,39zafc,MCWarsaw,2,Tue Jun 16 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"P1P4 is waaay too early for Matca Rioters. It's forcing 5 color super hard since the card is virtually unplayable outside of it, and even in 5 color it's not stellar and you generally have no problems picking up a couple copies. I'd go for the bounceland or Repeal there. You also seem to be valuing Gnarlid Packs weirdly high. It's ok to play one or two to pad your creature count in a pinch, but they're even more mediocre in 5 color than usual, since you won't always have 2GG on 4 mana, meaning they're  oftentimes a straight up bear without upside, which is well short of playable in this format. Finding random dorks generally isn't a problem for the 5 color deck and you can usually be picking more powerful cards over them (like the Izzet Boilerworks P1P5).  P1P9 I'd take the powerful sideboard card Flashfreeze over the random 2/1 for 2.  In general you seem to be drafting random dorks a lot higher than you need to in 5 color which is limiting your top end power, and if you're just going to play random 2 mana 2 power guys, there's better archetypes to do it in."
lrcast,39zafc,Suedars,2,Tue Jun 16 03:14:43 2015 UTC,"P1p1 - Agony Warp is fine but Narcolepsy keeps you much more open and I've been loving Bloodshot Trainee lately. I'd take the Trainee though the correct pick may be Narcolepsy. I feel like I'm starting to underrate it because I tend to value Sundering Vitae, Terashi's Grasp, & Apostle's Blessing a bit higher than most and feel like Narcolepsy and Arrest just get a lot weaker with so many of those floating around.   I think you're hinting that the correct pick here may have been Waxmane Baku with your nod to Spirits. I disagree there. I don't like taking Baku or Thief of Hope early as they're just unplayable outside of that deck. Nameless Inversion is the #1 reason to get into Spirits with maybe other solid White/Black removal behind it. I've been inclined to move in on Restless Apparition but the deck didn't really come together and I feel like it can easily suffer the same fate as Baku & Thief.  P1p2 - If I'd picked up the Trainee I'd be inclined to grab Darksteel Axe here. As it stands I agree Wrecking Ball is a solid pick.  P1p3 - Kozilek's Predator is the strongest card but doesn't go with your previous two picks. I'm a little torn between taking it or just looking to do LSV's Grixis Control build and take the Narcolepsy. I don't mind your grabbing Predator though.  P1p4 - I don't like picking up Matca so early. Even if you're 5 color you really need to be on the deck with about 3 Rampant Growth / Wayfarer Baubles and two or less bouncelands to have it shine. The 'other' 5 color build being one with 3-5 bouncelands and minimal ramp, very much favoring sunburst cards over domain ones. Anyway, this early I don't like Macta though 5 color does seem to be the direction you're going at this point. I'm looking at Repeal or Azorius Chancery as a solid 5 color card or Glint Hawk Idol as a high quality card in a completely opposite direction than your first few picks. I'm not sure what the pick is here. I guess I'll go Chancery.  P1p5 - There isn't much here and I agree w/ Evolving Wilds. Lot of Spirit cards present but I wouldn't move in on it.  P1p6 - Gnarlid is not that great. I'd take Boilerworks though Sages could be a decent pick too.  P1p7 - I guess Rioters is ok. Cloud Elemental or Daggerclaw Imp might be better but Rioters is fine.  P1p8 - I'm not really sure on the direction of this deck. We have some quality dual color removal and some Macta Rioters. Which is unfortunate since I don't think either of them are a reason to be in 5 color. I'd take the Grim Affliction here and consider sticking w/ just Grixis and not having to play all 5.   P1p9 - I don't really like Sickle Ripper but he's ok. When you need 2 drops he fills the slot as well as any. I guess I'd be inclined to take Stoic Rebuttal and go more controlling, but given your Matca plan Sickle is probably fine.  P1p10 - Servitor fills the 2 slot similar to Sickle. Unexciting. I'll take Telling Time.  P1p11 - Eldrazi Temple is kind of meh. If you're in 5 color I don't think you can run it. I'd take Servitor. I don't really think it matters, but maybe you're keeping Affinity off of another Artifact by taking the Servitor.  P1p12 - I'd take the Hoverguard. It's worse for our deck to play against than Phalanx, I think.  P1p13 - Agreed w/ Vitae. There's some decent Affinity cards here. Maybe it's a shame we didn't pick the Glint Hawk Idol way back when. Affinity seems to be underdrafted.  P2p1 - Lightning is great.  P2p2 - I'd take Etched Monstrosity. I know you need land search but Monstrosity is getting closer to a reason to actually be in 5 color.   P2p3 - Horde seems fine. It's similar to the Monstrosity I was on in the previous pack, though much harder to cast in time. This is a tough pack. At any rate it looks like something decent is bound to wheel.  P2p4 - Wow. 4th pick lightning? Sweet.  P2p5 - Vengeful is one of the payoffs for being 5 color so I'm glad to take it here. Though it stinks to be passing up an Evolving Wilds.  P2p6 - Bounceland looks good here.  P2p7 - Agreed w/ Fiery Fall.  P2p8 - Agreed w/ Tribal Flames.  P2p9 - Nice wheel on the Evolving Wilds!  P2p10 - Rioters is nice but again I'm not terribly excited about them.  P2p11 - This is a little tough. Manta is very good but this deck might need another Bauble to get the Matcas online. I can agree w/ Manta though.  P2p12 - Fiery Fall is a nice pickup here.  P2p13 - Vitae w/ 2 Affinity cards in pick 13 again. I like Vitae and am glad to grab a second one.  P2p15 - I think this 15th pick Gnarlid Pack is confirmation that you shouldn't be taking these early. :-)    P3p1 - I don't really like Chimeric Mass. Maybe it's fine. I guess it's better in a ramp deck than others. I'd just take a Wayfarer's Bauble here as I think the deck performs better with it. Maybe I'm wrong here though.  P3p2 - Pretty poor pack but I'd rather take Apostle's Blessing than Sphere of the Suns I think. You really want your ramp to be in the form of more lands coming out for domain, not this.  P3p3 - Spitebellows is a fine pickup here.  P3p4 - Gruul Turf is a nice pickup. I think it's one of the better bouncelands in the 5 color deck since you're going to be playing more Mountains & Forests than other basics anyway so it feels like it should hurt your domain less. I might be incorrect on this though. Some people like to play completely off color bouncelands to help with their Sunburst cards. I guess that's the other end of the spectrum from me and I don't think that's right either. I'd just rather have a more consistent deck all around.   P3p5 - At this point I'm worried that you're going to have too many bouncelands to have your Matcas be good. Granted there isn't much else here but I think I'd take a Viashino Slaughtermaster. I don't think we have many 2 drops and it might be fine. I think we're in a pretty poor spot regardless to be honest.  P3p6 - Knight is fine. It fluctuates from being really good to really bad for me. It always seems like they can just blow you out when you go to activate and it means you always want to dedicate a set of domain mana on reserve just to keep him alive. I think it's the pick here, and to be honest it seems like it's worked out well for me more often than not, it just seems a bit clunky to use. Somewhat high volatility.  P3p7 - The Minotaurs seem alright. I think this deck wants to be more aggressive than not, and if you can go turn 1 bauble, turn 3 rioter, turn 4 minotaur you're doing very well. But the likelihood of that happening seems incredibly slim given the deck's mana needs. Honestly I think I'd just grab a Daggerclaw Imp. It's not great but putting a Matca on the ground and an Imp in the air seems like a more plausible path to victory.  P3p8 - I think I'd be on the Imp plan again here. Maybe Cloud Elemental is better than the Imp for a similar, less aggressive plan.  P3p9 - Kitesail is ok. I'm looking at it or Wrap in Flames for the sideboard. The possibility of making the Matca fly is worth it I think.  P3p10 - I like Blessing quite a bit. If nothing else side it in against decks with multiple Arrests / Narcolepsys.   P3p11 - I'd rather have Growth chamer in 5 color but these Matcas are really going to suffer. I'll take the Shrivel unless we really need a 2 drop then I take Gust-Skimmer.  P3p12 - Here I actually like Gnarlid Pack better than Kavu Primarch. I know you already have 2 so it's very unlikely we'll run it. But they're not completely terrible in the ramp deck since they're an early blocker that scales up a little throughout the game."
lrcast,39zafc,transcensionist,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:55:32 2015 UTC,Agree with the other commenter. I would be cutting at least one land (maybe 2 ) and running Worldheart Phoenix and perhaps the Bear.
lrcast,39zafc,steve032,0,Tue Jun 16 02:46:04 2015 UTC,"I dislike these decks because you have all these cards dedicated to ramp, yet none of your 'payoff' cards give you card advantage (save for Vengeful Rebirth). Where do you get your edge? Sure, you could say Dragonsoul Knight turns into a dragon, but it's a dragon that still dies to Grim Affliction and a billion other things.  Needs Pelakku Wurms, Savage Twister, Niv-Mizzet, some kind of Eldrazi-level cards to make up for the inconsistency inherent to a ramp/5-color deck."
lrcast,39whdz,pahamack,3,Mon Jun 15 10:53:54 2015 UTC,"went 2-1 in an 8-4. Lost in the final to a card I've never even seen played before: dragon tempest. He just mauled me with dragon tempest into boltwing marauder on turn 5. Whisk aways just can't handle that. I have no idea how many dragons he was playing, just saw boltwing marauder both games t5 plus the RG uncommon dragon."
lrcast,39whdz,sylverfyre,3,Mon Jun 15 10:56:14 2015 UTC,"That's kinda the problem with the blue ""removal"" in this format.  I would have strongly considered playing Coat with Venom and Kolaghan's Skirmisher over Narset and Shieldhide, but that might be wrong.  Also possibly just play the coat over a reduce."
lrcast,39whdz,LancesAKing,2,Mon Jun 15 13:45:59 2015 UTC,"Narset is actually really good here.  I'm not aggroing anyone out in any build of this deck. Kolaghan's skirmisher is a mistake. I have enough defensive 2 drops.  Shieldhide is one of the best uncommon dragons. it wins from unwinnable positions due to flying + lifelink plus it's another dragon for our scorn. I actually won one game where I stalled the board so much I managed to get all three dragons into play, with icefall regent being a 6/5, while also attacking with a 5/5 shieldhide.  I thought about coat but I don't have enough creatures to play pump spells reliably. Besides, removal is good for control decks plus reduce is a cheap spell to trigger skywise teachings and you can get it with Narset. I suppose I could build my own baleful strix with coat + palace familiar/jeskai sage but reduce seemed more reliable than that.  Honestly, this isn't my sort of deck, I'd rather have a more normal midrange deck, but since these are the cards I drafted I need to commit to the Narset/teachings plan. The deck was good, just lost in r3 to a hard matchup plus whisk-away heavy draws, buying my way into more land.  If there's anything I missed in this deck it's card draw. Of course, hard removal would've been nice but I didn't see any."
lrcast,39whdz,SinibusUSG,2,Mon Jun 15 16:44:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about Narset being ""good"" here. you draw those extra cards for sure but you have almost no targets for her -2. in limited I found her best in U/R. Putting rebound on cards like bathe in dragonfire, cunning strike, Sarkhan's rage... It's a good time. UB would be good too but you're missing flatten, reach of shadows, foul tongue, ultimate price, etc."
lrcast,39whdz,hououinkyoumaQ,4,Mon Jun 15 20:36:21 2015 UTC,"You actually don't draw those extra cards for sure. Her + is basically ""draw 1/4 of a card"" in this deck by my count, which...yeah. Not so good."
lrcast,39whdz,clutchest_nugget,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"I used it multiple times in the draft to make a manifest with write into being, which is actually really good because the second manifest happens during your upkeep setting up your draw on the next phase. This happened maybe three times in the 6 matches i played. I mostly just fixed my draw to get another whisk away.  This happened in one game where I had a skywise teachings in play. That was really good.  I used it to rebound douse in gloom. That was really good.  Yes, it would have been better with those cards but are you really leaving Narset in the board with 13 non-creatures? She was so good during the draft. Much of that is because 15 of my 23 cards here are either great chump blockers (death trigger draw a card creatures) or act as removal spells (actual removal or creatures like icefall regent, aven surveyor, and sidisi's faithful). It was so easy to buy the time to get loads of cards off of her. If you draw even 2 cards off of Narset you are not losing."
lrcast,39whdz,hououinkyoumaQ,0,Mon Jun 15 21:56:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in constructed it's okay to put your opponent's good card on top of their deck of good cards to try and beat it with your deck of good cards.  In limited, you put their best card on top of their deck of bad cards and try and beat it with your deck of bad cards."
lrcast,39whdz,DR_Hero,4,Mon Jun 15 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"things like whisk away don't just perform this function. They also protect you from someone trying to kill you fast with aura'd up creatures, they seal a win by putting an irrelevant creature on top of their deck, making it impossible to topdeck, they buy you time to cast your more powerful cards if you're a control deck, punish double blocks/combat tricks and they let you win races with an aggro deck.  I think that card is underrated."
lrcast,39whdz,Slypenslyde,2,Mon Jun 15 16:50:04 2015 UTC,I especially like whisk when my opponent is stuck on mana. Taking away their opportunity to rip that last land they need can be back-breaking.

lrcast,39whdz,carpeamentum,3,Fri Jun 19 08:32:09 2015 UTC,"You're more incentivised to use whisk away early on to keep them with their weak cards early compared to other, more permanent removal."
lrcast,39z9kz,procumbo,3,Tue Jun 16 00:12:39 2015 UTC,"LSV did a draft recently where he ran Grixis control; that might be nice. Either way, it's better in a slow deck; either some UR-base control deck or 5 color are the prime candidates. It's good, so I do want to pick it up relatively early, but you're right that it isn't premium for affinity."

lrcast,39z9kz,YawgmothsTrust,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:43:41 2015 UTC,"I'll take it early, but it's generally well below the other top-tier common removal for me (about on par with Grim Affliction, maybe a bit below). Usually when I do I'm looking for some sort of 5 color deck."
lrcast,39z9kz,Suedars,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:32:09 2015 UTC,"It's good in any control deck, like 5-color or UBx.  It's perfectly fine in aggressive decks, including affinity, just not super exciting."
lrcast,39z9kz,bitterrootmtg,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:18:15 2015 UTC,"i think the problem is that it doesn't enable attacks the turn it's played, which pretty much rules it out of aggressive decks.  Seems like a good pick up for the 5 color deck."
lrcast,39z9kz,pahamack,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:08:26 2015 UTC,"Here's a list of the cons of Nacrolepsy:   Doesn't reduce UW's artifact count Beatable by BW's Kami of Ancient Law Free fodder for BG's Bone Splinters Bad against UG's graft guys (and straight worthless if they have Graftmage) Doesn't reduce GW's creature count (and bad on wide decks anyways) Blown out by UR's Aethersnipe and Repeal Screwed by RW's Apostle's Blessing   And the Pros:   2 mana hard removal   In summation, you're never cutting it from any deck that can cast it (including affinity). Yeah, I have no problem taking it early. I know when it's good, I know when it's bad, I know I don't pass cheap removal. It is worse than the other removal you mentioned though.  And seeing as it's the best common of its color, blue is probably open if Narcolepsy is floating around. So to give it a bit of criticism, it's one of those cards that I like much better when it's passed to me than as a P1P1."
lrcast,39wqut,shinianx,9,Mon Jun 15 12:51:38 2015 UTC,"I bring in discard when my opponent has tend to have powerful, expensive cards that get stuck in their hand for some time, and that I might have a tough time otherwise dealing with. Examples could be Ugin, Atarka, Duneblast, Artisan of Kozilek.  Usually discard is better when you have a low curve, so that you can play your spells and finish by removing your opponents potentially stabilizing plays. The biggest key, I think, is using it against high-cmc cards, so that you know your opponent will playing their lands and trying to get up to high mana counts, so they dont have excess lands in hand to discard.  Even in a vacuum, they are still playable, just not particularly good."
lrcast,39wqut,Hainen,6,Mon Jun 15 13:17:27 2015 UTC,"There's two parts of this.  First is that it's a spell that doesn't affect the board, which includes all the caveats that were covered recently about such spells.  Another important part though is that you need to view them in the context of the format - a slower format, with players emptying their hands more slowly and relying more on incremental advantages makes these spells more powerful.  There's two reasons for this: You have the time to cast the spell without being punished for not affecting the board, and your opponent is more likely to have cards left in their hand if you topdeck your ""Mind Rot"" spell later on.  In waking nightmare's case, the arcane upside isn't usually necessary (you usually have enough critical mass if your spirits deck came together properly) and Modern Masters 2015 is a reasonably fast format.  I would strongly consider siding it in against the 5 color deck if I were in spirits.  However, take a look at [[Rakshasa's Secret]] - in the context of a slow format like triple Khans, it was very good and was very rarely cut from the deck.  Your opponent was often not pressuring you prior to a turn 3 morph.  (Especially compared to MM2 where some decks start pressure right on turn 1 like Flayer Husk, Court Homunculus, Tukatuka.)    Additionally, they were often spending signfiicant maounts of mana later in the game flipping up morphs instead of playing out their hand - so the likelyhood of them having a couple cards left for your turn 9 Rakshasa's Secret topdeck to hit was increased.  It's delve-powering upside was also very relevant because it helped offset the tempo loss."

lrcast,39wqut,MTGCardFetcher,3,Mon Jun 15 13:41:29 2015 UTC,"Just to add to what others have said, I consider playing a mind rot-type effect when I think the match will be determined by card advantage. This is a major simplification, but I believe many limited matches come down to two different types of games: those in which the player who has no cards left in hand first wins (i.e. curving out with a 2-drop, 3-drop, 4-drop, etc.), and those in which the player who runs out of cards first loses (i.e. players trade 1-for-1 a bunch until one player gets some kind of 2-for-1 and gets ahead). In general, the first scenario is in a more aggressive match or format (who can deal 20 points of damage first), while the second scenario is a more controlling match or format in which attrition matters more (after the dust settles, who still has cards in hand or a board presence). Again, that's a simplification, but I think mind rot is better in the second kind of matches -- where you won't be as punished for taking a turn off, and where you need to find every way you can to get 2-for-1s.  I'll also just note that if you're playing against a deck with expensive spells, Mind Rot doesn't need to hit a powerful spell to be worthwhile, it can sometimes be fine to hit a land or even two -- if your opponent is playing 7-drops, it will take a lot longer to get to it if they have to discard a land in the process. You take off one turn to play a Mind Rot, and it can easily set them back 2-3 turns toward hitting that 7th land."
lrcast,39wqut,mrcjtm,4,Mon Jun 15 16:24:28 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the top comment (surprisingly) that says it's good against big bombs, a mentality that evolved from textbook ROTtiness. People will celebrate Mind Rot as AMAZING when it takes out the bomb and forget the vast majority of times that it doesn't.  Discard's most common effect is putting the game into topdeck mode, and decks with big bombs are very very good in topdeck mode. Do you know what's actually good against expensive bombs? Counterspells. If not playing blue? Killing your opponent before they become relevant.  Besides some niche cases (Sprout Swarm, Goblin Heelcutter), the place for discard effects is against removal heavy decks, or more generally decks that are heavy on answers.   KtK's format is the only one in recent memory where maindeck Mind Rot was pretty strong, if only in one deck. The Sultai deck had a lot of card advantage, but very little threats (a couple Abomination of Gudul and Mystic of the Hidden Way). So your opponent always had removal in hand to take out your finishers, and you'd have to try to ping your way out with Archer's Parapet before you decked yourself.  I'm not sure who came up with this, but I first saw it from Gerard Fabiano, he used Rakshasa's Secret to clear the removal in his opponent's hand before playing his expensive finishers. The guy won GP Baltimore forcing this deck and taking P1P2 Mind Rots.  It was also very effective in that format for taking out things like Kill Shot, Duneblast, and later Sandblast, removal that you couldn't use proactively.  So yeah, this ended up being a longer reply than I thought. Just wanted to finish off by saying discard is usually maindeckable in sealed, where aggressive decks can't really punish you and the games are usually more grindy."
lrcast,39wqut,bearrosaurus,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"Respectfully, I don't think /u/Hainen was arguing Mind Rot is great against bombs because it gets them out of their hands.  Instead, I think their argument was this: Mind Rot is a guaranteed 2-for-1 so long your opponent actually has 2 cards in hand. It's a good 2-for-1 when your opponent has less choice about which cards to discard. This effect is at its best when your opponent has lots of expensive spells that are 1) likely to stay in their hand for a while, and 2) represent two real cards in the trade."
lrcast,39wqut,richarizard,2,Wed Jun 17 19:17:11 2015 UTC,"Those cards are never main deck cards for me. But I like to board them in when I expect from my opponent to have important cards that tend to be in his hand for a while.  Typical examples would be: - Expensive bombs - Overrun-style cards  In both cases there is a good chance that the opponent plays out most of his hand, but will wait for the right time to play his overrun/bomb. Then discards-spells tend to be valuable."

It's probably important to note that not all discard is created equal. Generally, since you're not playing a spell that's affecting the board, you'd like to at least get card advantage out of this type of effect, so [[Mind Rot]] -style discard 2+ cards tends to be better than [[Duress]] or [[Despise]] style effects. The exception is something like [[Thoughtseize]] that has no restrictions on what it can take.  In general, don't start these effects. Board them in when you know your opponent has a better top end than you do and try to gain card advantage by using a Mind Rot effect rather than a Duress effect."

This is because cube is a very high power level format and your deck can very easily recover from, say, whiffing from a t1 duress.

lrcast,39vlqg,sevenduckies,2,Mon Jun 15 04:02:52 2015 UTC,I think the bigger problem is just how unexciting your pool is outside of blacks 3 bombs.  Black is a little shallow but 2 deathtouchers plus flatten and butcher to complement the bombs makes it fine. I see 10 cards that are fine in black(11 if you are desperate enough to run sadist).   Red is out. Pyro and Bathe are great but everything else is pretty bad. Green is unexciting but has some decent cards/roleplayers. White and blue are okay but lacking in something to take them over the top.   I think I'd build a UB exploit deck and keep a BWg(splashing for sovereign and maybe epic confrontation) in my back pocket for the SB.
lrcast,39vlqg,Tlamat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:19:47 2015 UTC,"I ended up in BWg, but I looked at the UB Exploit deck long and hard before deciding.

We're not expecting to see decks where Arashin Cleric is worth a full card in sealed, but we can always side it in if we do.  (As well as siding in Qarsi Sadist)    I would definitely play Kolaghan's Skirmisher (2/2 with no downside and minor upside) over Arashin Cleric (1/3 with minor upside) in sealed.  A 2/2 is much better than a 1/3.  In the matchups where we want Cleric we'd be pulling out stuff like Arashin Sovereign to bring in cheap blockers anyway.  I would also consider Great-horn Krushok and Custodian of the Trove for this slot."

lrcast,39s75l,Skurry,5,Sun Jun 14 06:19:42 2015 UTC,"My feeling is WR splashing green is the preferred build.   I don't think you can not play white as a main color here. The quality of your white overall is weak, but three absurd white rares plus Dromoka is too good. You don't win sealed games by not playing your bombs.  Given that playing white is mandatory, you just want to maximize the number and quality of your playables from your second color. I think your green build is clunky and playing some weak cards, whereas with a more streamlined WR build you can keep the curve low and build a deck that's good at getting to those busted bombs.  As to the construction of the WR deck, I would build it slightly differently from you by not playing the Scalelord or the Temur Battle Rage, and instead playing Tormenting Voice and Wardscale Dragon. I'd like to get rid of Krotiq too but there isn't a good alternative and at least it doesn't ask as much of your splash."
lrcast,39s75l,Sceptilesolar,3,Sun Jun 14 12:20:08 2015 UTC,"Your build looks good except I don't like Gleam too much. Is it weird that I'd like to play Abzan Runemark over it? Turn 2 Roc into turn 3 Runemark looks on the surface to be the jankiest start of all time, but it's surprisingly unbeatable against a lot of draws.  Anyways, the other guys telling you to play main red are wrong. Citadel (and Mastery to a lesser extent) needs a strong creature base and your red creatures are awful. It doesn't matter if your filler is a little underpowered because you're obviously not trying to win on your filler with this deck. Maybe this would play bad in a draft, but it's definitely a phenomenal sealed deck."

It has good removal and a solid creature base to help you get to the late game where your bombs take over.  The only change I would make from the version you listed is Tormenting Voice over Artful Maneuver. Voice helps smooth out your draws and make your deck smaller, so that you can more easily find Siege, Dromoka and Mastery."

It's a great pool. You just hope to apply early pressure with your 2 and 3 drops, and then win the game with one your 3 and a half bombs. There's enough incidental bolster to give your deck a little more staying power if they stabilize while you wait to draw into your wins.

Here's the thing; your white stinks. You have citadel siege which is absurd, and mastery / dromoka which are super strong but I'd be tempted to splash. But after  that.. You're playing pretty weak cards to make up playables.   Red is deep and very powerful. It has some removal and just big ground threats.   I'm not saying this is correct, especially since I've not laid it out, just that I think it's worth a look.   At a side note I'd main deck Return to the Earth over pinion feast, and in fact would be very happy to main deck it in any green sealed deck."

You're playing pretty weak cards to make up playables   Siege, Mastery, Secure the Wastes and Gleam of Authority range from very good to obscene and Enduring Victory, Wardscale and the 2 drops are perfectly playable with Jeskai Barricade as the only iffy card, white is pretty close to insane in this pool.  Red is fairly good but I'd much rather dump green and splash the Dromoka off of a forest and a Rugged Highlands and you get some cheap removal and a Tormenting Voice to dig you to your bomb and let you play 18 lands for Mastery, Secure and the 2 6 drop dragons."

Kozilek's Predator very happy. But early to say where we're going but these two green picks skew me toward tokens if it's open.   Scion of the Wilds that's my kind of payoff! And another Scion of the Wilds immediately after! I don't find fixing that much of a high pick and I'm looking to stake a claim on tokens here.   Artisan of Kozilek is a card I very much like to have. If you get a few more spawn producers / ramp, it's really a fantastic finisher. Plus if we're tokens with the Artisan as top end we're attacking in two axes.   Dread Drone is a great card is we're black green.   Raise the Alarm is great card if we're white green.   So we have what could become a very very sweet tokens deck. Not committed yet to either secondary colour but our green is good enough that I'm looking to go to token town."
lrcast,39s4r4,SirChuffly,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:31:48 2015 UTC,"This is basically what my picks looked like, though I opted for dark confidant p4 even in phantom.    No one else seems to like that pick though and it seemed close enough to me.    I would probably be a bit scared to run it though if we had a lot of ramp targets so in retrospect scion seems right."
lrcast,39s4r4,carpeamentum,2,Mon Jun 15 19:23:59 2015 UTC,"Lightning Bolt - I think it's easily the best card in the pack and a great start.   Nest Invader - I think it comes down to Guildmage and Invader. I think it might be wrong, but I'm taking Invader because it lends itself to 5-color/ramp quite nicely, and that's where I want to be in this format. So when it's close, I give that the edge. That said, I've never played with the Guildmage before, so I could just be vastly underestimating it.   Kozilek's Predator - Feelin' good.   Spread the Sickness - Removal is always good. Unconditional removal is better, and though it's expensive, the upside of proliferate is not irrelevant. Scion is a close second given our double token makers so early into the draft.   Golgari Rot Farm - Bounce land fixing is excellent here. Another Guildmage and another Scion, but fixing.   Artisan of Kozilek - Our first ramp target, and while I've never played with it before, Artisan seems really good. Immediate value when it comes into play helps mitigate the high mana cost, I think.   Evolving Wilds - Wilds is a great flex fix. It grabs whatever you basic you need the most right away. I think the fixing, at this point, is a little more important than the Manta, especially since we just picked up a big fatty.   Azorius Chancery - Totally off-color, but a bounce land is a bounce land, and this keeps us in the game for a good 5-color base. Hopefully that Gruul Turf from pack 1 comes back."

P1p2 - I'm looking at Glint Hawk Idol & Nest Invader. I think Idol possibly pairs better with Bolt so I'll go with it. Maybe that's wrong, I'm not confident here.  P1p3 - Nothing great in Red or White. Maybe Izzet Boilerworks is the pick here, but I'll take Kozilek's Predator and regret having not grabbed the Nest Invader in the previous pack.  P1p4 - I could see taking Dark Confidant or Spread the Sickness for a Rakdos deck though we haven't seen any good red cards yet. Maybe the payoff is there. But at this point we've been passed 3 solid token cards in a row so I'll take Scion of the Wild.  P1p5 - Pairing up Scion seems good.  P1p6 - I think I would rather have a couple Fortifies than any Overwhelms but I'll take the Overwhelm here. Otherwise I'm looking at Sunspear Shikari but I think Overwhelm is better here. Just considering it since it and our tokens would both benefit from equipment.  P1p7 - Dread Drone powers up our Scions and very well and I'll grab it here. Evolving Wilds might be nice to pick up at some point but not here for me.  P1p8 - Raise the Alarm. It might be worth noting that there's a whole lot more white cards than black here so we may want to focus GW tokens over GB, though splashing our Dread Drone or possibly some black removal we pick up later wouldn't be bad so we should keep an eye out for a land fetch or two and gb/wb bouncelands."

Guildmage is also a choice, but I like taking the chance of going hard tokens early.  3: Kozilek's Predator, pushing deeper into token territory.  4: Scion of the Wild.  Spread the Sickness is solid removal, but I'd rather spend my pick to hedge others out of tokens as early as possible.  5: I'll take a second Scion of the Wild here.  I want Fortify, but I think it'll wheel.  6: Overwhelm, easy.  Though I prefer a cheaper overrun effect.  7: Dread Drone.

lrcast,39s4r4,Greyfeld,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:04:51 2015 UTC,"Lightning Bolt - Easy pick Nest Invader - I looked at guildmage too, but I'm pretty off on UB as a color combination. Kozi Predator - Best card and works with the previous pick. GET THE SLEEVE Dark Confidant $_$  (Scion of the Wild because it's a phantom draft.  Spread the sickness is a card too, but after 2 good token makers I like the scion.) Scion of the Wild #2 Overwhelm - Kinda meh to pick this early (it's far from the best card that does this thing) but at the same time, there's lots of green cards here, so I'm definitely getting the feeling that the color is open, but meanwhile the other green cards are crap.  It's normally a bit early to pick up overwhelm as we don't need lots of this type of card, but taking it because it still slots into the deck nicely and we dont want any other green card.  I also greatly prefer this over Artisan in the token decks.  In my mind a good token deck isn't playing expensive spells unless they have Convoke.  I don't want to sac my eldrazi spawn to cast a 9 drop, I want to swing for 9 with them and/or use them to generate advantage like with Mortarpod/Rusalka. Dread Drone - we're probably playing tokens, but we're not sure if we're GW or GB at this point.  Raise the Alarm - Excellent in tokens which we've settled into, giving us the option of going GW as well.   So after my 8 picks, I definitely get a strong sense that I want to be in some kind of green token theme.  Whether I end up in GB or GW is yet to be determined and will depend on what wheels and what we open in pack 2.  Cards I'm looking for on the wheel to help with the decision of GW vs GB are:   Is raise the alarm still there in pack 1?  Sign for white.  Kitesail is also playable if it's not there (giant Scions do like the evasion.) Bone Splinters in pack 2? Not much I'm really reading signs off of in pack 3 wheel or later, but if dread drone wheeled I'd be happy.  Wouldn't be surprised if the pack is dry - was not a strong pack overall - and we end up hating a Wrap in Flames."

lrcast,39q8qv,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:41:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone, great feedback from all. I guess the consensus is Reduce in Stature sucks, and Frost Walker is out of place. I knew that Reduce in Stature was mediocre, but I guess I was thinking that I was short on removal. My reasoning for Frost Walker was to round out my mana curve and have an early blocker (or attacker for some early damage) since my curve was so high with so many 5-6 costing cards. That said, I suppose Write into Being does the same thing but provides more utility through the each phase of the game. Likewise, I guess Whisk Away would be better removal and is far more versatile than Reduce in Stature, and is a big hit to tempo.  Only thing about Write into Being though is that I've played it once before and didn't like it. It seemed like I'd always manifest a much needed removal card. Guess that's just bad luck?  Cheers.  Edit: Thoughts on Reality Shift or Taigam's Strike?"
lrcast,39q8qv,deworde,2,Sat Jun 13 19:33:32 2015 UTC,"Taigam's is good but not broken if you're beating down and need to squeeze damage through, but your deck is sitting back a lot, and it's not like blocking Sidisi or Okud ends well for your opponent. You'd generally rather they blocked than not.  Regarding Write, if you're drawing 2 cards and the worst card is the removal, that's an amazing draw. Remember, you always manifest the creature, or land unless you're really mana screwed. EDIT: Oh, you missed the word top? Yeah, that card is a lot worse. Don't run that card.  I think Reality Shift being instant speed and 2 mana makes it significantly better than Reduce as removal, because you can screw up combat or ruin tricks; your deck is not exactly afraid of a 2/2 vanilla. But the other comments have convinced me Shift's worse than Whisk Away unless you've got a specific target in mind. They'd definitely be my sideboard swap though (Atarka gets shifted, Carp gets whisked)"

For example, up until I read your deck this morning, I was completely unaware that Mr Frosty doesn't sac in response to the exploit targetting*, so you can exploit him for value.  *: Because exploit doesn't target."
lrcast,39q8qv,Greyfeld,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:03:27 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have that problem with Write into Being, since you get to pick which card is manifested.  I mean, there is an off chance that you see two removal cards with it, but it isn't all that likely.  I think Reality Shift is more of a sideboard card -- it can be ok against the R/G monsters deck, and it is good if your opponent has 2-3 huge bombs you need an answer for, but on the whole it isn't the greatest removal, since it leaves something behind.  Taigam's Strike can be good, but I don't think your deck is the deck it belong in, it is better in a deck with lots of the pseudo-prowess/prowess guys."
lrcast,39q8qv,Greyfeld,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:02:15 2015 UTC,"As has been said about Write Into Being, it's strictly better than most of the other ""manifest"" cards, specifically because it allows you to dodge manifesting something you don't want to.  It's like a manifest + scry wrapped into one card.  I actually like Reality Shift.  Lots of people seem to think it's not a very good card, and I admit that giving them a manifest is a major drawback.  But it's essentially unconditional removal for any creature, at instant speed, which isn't to be scoffed at.  I've run it a few times, and I've had a lot of luck with it.  I'm not sure I'd run it if I already had a full removal suite, but I'd gladly run it if I were light on removal, and be happy to pull it as a sideboard card at the very least.  Taigam's Strike, I think it works best in UW or UR.  Specifically, you want a deck that has some strong aggression to it that you can exploit for the unblockable damage.  The prowess in white makes it really good, and you can use it to easily activate Ferocious/Formidable in red.  I'd say UR you'd need to play an aggressive bounce/tap-centric style to force damage to the face, and UW you'd need to play an evasive style (fliers, unblockable creatures) to make it work."

lrcast,39q8qv,Greyfeld,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:03:18 2015 UTC,"I definitely run the frost walker.  It's a lot like Typhoid Rats, except that the opponent is much more likely to block it and trade if we swing in.  It's like an extreme Hand of Silumgar.  We WANT to trade early in this deck, and Frost Walker is plenty good at doing just that.  Sure, it's not perfect for the deck, but it still does its job.  Furthermore, it's harder to value-kill the walker than it seems - if we play it on 2, our opponent is unlikely to dork around setting up a ""free kill"" while we're hitting them for 4.  Sure, our deck isn't normally aggressive, but Walker will demand a trade, and we'll be happy about that."
lrcast,39q8qv,sylverfyre,3,Mon Jun 15 03:28:27 2015 UTC,"I would have cut reduce and frost walker for whisk away and write into being. Your deck is not aggressive so it doesn't need frost walker who has a lot of cases where it gets you 2 for 1'd(atarka efreet being on top of my mind).   Reduce in Stature I personally rank somewhere in the d+ range. Sometimes it makes the cut but I'd rather not main deck it. It is very weak to exploit and dash and something with an ability, and even leaves your opponent with a chump blocker. I like it in the sideboard where you can bring it against rg where it is basically a removal spell. Whisk away and Write into being I find both solid cards which have little downside."

Your deck is not aggressive so it doesn't need frost walker who has a lot of cases where it gets you 2 for 1'd(atarka efreet being on top of my mind).   I agree with not needing Frostwalker due to not being an aggro deck, but I'm not sure I'd list Atarka (and the like) as reasons not to play it.  It's only a 2-drop, and there are a royal crapton of 2-drops that are X/1.  The only time when his ability is actually a drawback is when your opponent uses a spell that normally isn't a removal spell to kill it.  Like Ojutai's Breath and the like."

Just hit a creature on your EoT, then have it rebound on your Frostwalker during their upkeep.  But it tends to still mean they end up taking at least 4 to the face to set up for that sort of value, if you end up dropping it on-curve.   There actually aren't very many spells which do better than 1-for-1 for your frost walker and would fail kill a 2/2.   Basically.  I think the only real drawback is that you can't use any of your own spells/abilities on it."

lrcast,39q8qv,Sceptilesolar,3,Mon Jun 15 03:22:07 2015 UTC,"Unlike other commenters, I actually like Frost Walker in a deck like this. The UB decks usually want to trade 1-for-1 as much as possible early, and then win in the late game with more powerful spells and card advantage. Frost Walker gives you an early blocker that can trade up for bigger creatures -- while it looks like an aggressive card, I think it fits fine in a controlling deck too.  I would have run the Write into Being in place of one of the Ojutai's Summons. While Summons is higher power level in a vacuum, you've got some curve issues to consider with your lack of 3-drops. I would keep Reduce in Stature in the main deck given your lack of removal, but I would happily side it out for the second Whisk Away if your opponent has ways to make you pay for playing it (i.e. exploit, bolster effects, combat tricks)."
lrcast,39q8qv,deworde,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:25:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in theory it's a lot easier to 'value-kill'  a frost walker than it actually is in practice.   Most of the cards that do it are not cards that are commonly played, and even stuff like Pressure Point don't actually get to cantrip-kill because the spell gets countered."
lrcast,39q8qv,clutchest_nugget,2,Mon Jun 15 03:25:06 2015 UTC,I'd rather have either Whisk Away or Write Into Being over Reduce in Stature; the card is just very mediocre.

But hey, 4 power flyers in the air, never a bad thing.  I actually like Anticipate here, the card quality's so good that you'd have a hard time not hitting something amazing, but I can see that that removes an exploit target.

In the other games, my opponents often had the 'really???' look, after I kept playing bomb after bomb... I got paired up against one of the two players out of around 30 something that was still undefeated and ended up beating him after we had already intentionally drew.  I was also a bit hesitant running 3 Ojutai's Summons, but given that I was mostly in blue, and with the monument, I felt like I could cast then relatively consistently.

If he already had two Scions (or other big, beefy creatures that synergized with his deck), I'd take the pump spell.  If he had 1 or 0, I'd take the Scion.  Overrun-type effects are very important in token decks, even if it's only +1/+1.  You multiply that 1 damage over 6-8 extra creatures, and you push lethal pretty easily.

lrcast,39prty,BishopBarkley,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:38:06 2015 UTC,"I've played quite a bit of F-K-K draft (in lieu of DTK) so I'll offer my perspective.  I think its at least worth noting you're passing Reach of Shadows P1P1 with a lot of junk in the pack.  Anticipating signals for pack 2 isn't always going to be a great bet, but it's something to note when you take the Angler 4th (which I think was correct).  I'm hung up on P1P7.  Harsh Sustenance vs. Battle Rage.  Sustenance is stronger in the type of mardu decks I can see you wanting to build here, but you haven't seen any wheelable lands (except for a tranquil cove to put you in Jeskai).  You have vaultbreaker + angler already so I think I might have stayed the course here, but it's very close.  P1P12 I'd go runemark.  I think it's a bit better of a sideboard card than diplomacy against any removal-lite deck and I dont think you're too upset passing a second hill giant, but its a fairly inconsequential decision.  So, P2P1, I've been a little dissapointed by Necropolis Fiend actually , but it feels really hard to pass, even for a heart piercer.  Honestly I can't fault you too much for it, but you're likely to be forcing people into trades in the early going which makes me feel Necropolis Fiend is just a fine curve topper to give your deck a bit of reach.  So, you have a lot of incentive to be white, though I just dont think you had the fixing cooperating with you here.  I'm comfortable with Charm at P2P8, but not comfortable with picking up the wheeling chief over a very playable krumar bond kin.  With you mana as it is you're not getting that chief out comfortably and consistently I fear, and Charm/Sustenance/Ride Down can be splashed far more easily.  There was a crag in the chief pack that didn't come around, someone was also desperate for the fixing you now needed by taking the chief.  There was also a pony in the Krumar Bond Kin pack which could be an indication that mardu wasn't actually open and you just got handed some deep packs.  To the same end P3P1 is really rough.  I would have taken dig for value especially because the next four cards - hordechief/scavenger/pony/take up arms - are all pretty similar in value.  I think the correct pick, even assuming what you'd taken thus far, was the scavenger.  Wow, Shanker vs. Nomad Outpost P3P2 is brutal.  I think you had the power in the white removal spells to take the land, but thats just a gut check for sure.  Really big punt in my opinion on P3P3 not taking Dragon Style Twins.  You're trying to play white and now have a double red 3 drop without a lot of synergy. I've been largely dissapointed with token combo in the format and have found that traditional aggro is stronger.  If you're familiar with the F-K-K meta on MTGO right now there has been an apparent increase (at least in my experience) in cheesy valley dasher-esque decks that prey on weak and overstretched manabases like the one we seem to be constructing here. I think the Mantis is better than the outburst here as well.  P3P6, war behemoth isn't aggressive but is plenty playable, I think it's the pick here.  P3P7 same idea, I think witness is the pick here.  You might still be 2 color and this is a fine man.    I think you drafted well, suffered a bit of misfortune in not holding the lands you needed, though that is the risk you run sometimes.  I think there was a plenty good R/B deck in here or even mardu looks much more palatable with an outpost over the shanker.  Don't be afraid to take speculative lands in FRF, I didn't see any opportunities for you to in this draft or I would have noted them, but with the bipolar nature of FRF packs there's often an opportunity to get out in front on prioritizing fixing so you can capitalize on deep KTK packs."
lrcast,39nsv1,paranoiaplus,7,Sat Jun 13 02:08:20 2015 UTC,"It is hard to be consistent and aggressive with a solidly three color manabase, I would try and see if most of the blue can be replaced with red or white cards"

lrcast,39nsv1,SourAsparagus,6,Sat Jun 13 05:09:25 2015 UTC,"Taigam's Strike and Elusive Spellfist are absolutely not worth splashing for.  As for the draft, Pack 1 you picked exactly as I would except for the Monument over Student of Ojutai.    It's pack 2 where you really go off the rails.  Pick 1 is obviously for the tickets, so I'll ignore that.  Kolaghan's Aspirant over Atarka Pummeler is a weird choice.  Dragon Hunter over Tail Slash is definitely wrong.  So is Dromoka Warrior over Atarka Efreet.  Pick 7 had nothing for you but it's weird that you take the basically unplayable Dance of the Skywise over the very good Palace Familiar and Butcher's Glee.   Pick 8 you ignored Kindled Fury for some reason, it's not great but its a decent card that might make the cut.  Pick 10 makes no sense.  Earlier you took the 2/1 for 2 over a near bomb uncommon, but here you take an off color bad card over another 2/1 in your heavier color.  Pick 11 you got super lucky on that Tail Slash wheel.  That should never ever happen.  You also made some strange picks pack 3.  Pick 1 is debatable, but I would have taken the very powerful Wild Slash over a card I need to splash for.  You did have the monument, but I'd rather not play the monument if I didn't have to.  Pick 2 you go right into making the splash work, but you miss the incredible Goblin Heelcutter.  Passing multiple good cards just to splash one bomb is absolutely not worth it.  Pick 4 is another pick that makes so sense to me.  You take a really bad off color card over the playable Soul Summons or even hate drafting the ridiculous Temur Sabertooth or Gurmag Angler.  There were even 3 other blue cards in the pack and for some reason you took the worst one.  This was a messy draft and I'm actually surprised you did as well as you did."
lrcast,39nsv1,lotrfish,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:53:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for taking the time to respond!  I agree with most of what you said, but here's some of my reasoning for my picks --   At this point in the draft, I wanted my deck to have a lower curve; I felt that Kholagan Aspirant would be more relevant for getting in early damage, especially in a format where there's an abundance of 1 toughness creatures. I actually looked at Kindled Fury for a few seconds and was going to take it initially. I chose the Spellfist mostly due to bias (aka being ""ROTT-y""). On the other hand, at this point I had quite a few non-creature spells and I'm known to have a lower creature count when I draft. I felt that a 1/3 body that could block morphs and get in a few points of damage would bring more value to my deck than what Kindled Fury offered. Spellfist ended up being my main win con (t2 spellfist -> t3 artful maneuver -> rebound + taigam's strike -> rebound on multiple occasions was absolutely devastating).  Honest question: could you explain why Taigam's Strike is bad? I feel like +2/+0 and unblockable is extremely relevant in a lot of decks.  Not really a rebuttal, I totally agree with P3P2. I don't know what I was thinking :v I value refocus over enhanced awareness for P3P4, but otherwise I agree."
lrcast,39nsv1,lotrfish,4,Sat Jun 13 03:58:27 2015 UTC,"In response to Taigam's Strike:  -It has the inherent weakness of any combat trick in that it opens you up to 2 for 1's if they have removal in response and requires creatures to do anything in the first place.  This one's even worse because the second half they can see coming and make sure to save their removal.  -Spending 4 mana and a card just get some damage in is usually not worth it.  If you're opponent is building up their board while you're doing this, you're going to lose.  -It does absolutely nothing if you're behind.    Also, you weren't even in blue at that point so even if the card was decent the pick still wouldn't make much sense."
lrcast,39nsv1,cferejohn,4,Sat Jun 13 04:17:35 2015 UTC,"At this point in the draft, I wanted my deck to have a lower curve; I felt that Kholagan Aspirant would be more relevant for getting in early damage, especially in a format where there's an abundance of 1 toughness creatures.   It wasn't even the best 2 drop for your deck in that pack, and you missed several better chances to pick up 2-drops. I think you are on the right track in thinking about your curve, but I think you chose the wrong times to focus on that.   Spellfist ended up being my main win con (t2 spellfist -> t3 artful maneuver -> rebound + taigam's strike -> rebound on multiple occasions was absolutely devastating).   That's about as ROTTY as it gets. Your main win con was a 3 card combo that would do 14 damage over 2 turns and could be completely hosed by a single removal or bounce spell?    Honest question: could you explain why Taigam's Strike is bad? I feel like +2/+0 and unblockable is extremely relevant in a lot of decks.   Because the creature you cast it on doesn't always live. Leaving yourself open to a 2-for-1 is a real risk, and if you're going to take it, you need a really good payoff. If you have Atarka Efreet and you cast it when your opponent is tapped out, that's 8 damage, and if it dies next turn, you can probably live with it. Getting in for 3 or 4 and then allowing your opponent to come up with an answer is asking be blown out.   I value refocus over enhanced awareness for P3P4, but otherwise I agree.   I think you are just wrong here. Refocus is 90% ""spend 2 mana, draw a card)"". Drawing 3 cards at instant speed is really good. Almost every blue deck can run at least one, and some of them really want it."

lrcast,39nsv1,cferejohn,3,Sat Jun 13 03:20:23 2015 UTC,"P1P5 - I'm taking Stormcrag Elemental over Twin Bolt here. That card is a beating and if you megamorph it none of the damage-based removal can hit it.  P1P6 - Did you take Haven because it's worth a ticket? That's probably close, or even correct, from an EV perspective, but for such a low value I'd take a card that might make my deck. Hardened Berserker is perfectly good. You could take a flyer on the Elk Herd as well, but Green hasn't seemed super open, so it's probably a fluke.  P1P7 - Lightwalker here. You already have a Sandcrafter Mage and T2 Lightwalker into T3 Sandcrafter is sweet. Artful Maneuver is fine, but if you end up RW the tricks you want are the 'pump your whole team' ones.  P1P8 - You are looking at an aggressive deck here thus far. I think I'd rather have the 2-drop Herald rather than the morph.  P2P1 - Wow. That pack is horrendous. I guess the Shaman is a mythic so you can get some tickets? There's literally no white or red card I even kind of want to play.   P2P2 - After passing a couple of 2 drops for worse creatures, now you take one in place of several better options. The Pummeler is quite good. A 4/5 body that can enable an alpha strike on a clogged board. I'd also take the Prowler, the Lightwalker, and probably the Warkite ahead of the Aspirant.  P2P3 - Easily Tail Slash here. Dragon Hunter is fine, but really a 1 mana 2/1 is just not that exciting in limited.  P2P6 - Atarka Efreet over Dromoka Warrior by a fairly large margin.  P2P8 - Not sure why you take a mediocre blue card here. If you want to hate something, hate the Belltoll Dragon, which can be pretty hard to deal with once it is down. Really though I'd be haply with the Kindled Fury - you have some low toughness creatures and you figure to get more in pack 3.  P2P10 - I am pretty confused now. Why are you going into blue. And again for a barely playable card. You even passed one of the cards that it is best with in the Efreet. And there's a perfectly playable 2 drop here in the Lightwalker.  P2P11 - 11th pick Tail Slash. Wat.  P3P1 - Ojutai is reasonable, though he's not the best fit for your deck. I'm not convinced Wild Slash isn't a better pick.   P3P2 - Holy Cow. Goblin Heelcutter here all day. That card is completely bonkers. It is a much better card than 7-mana Ojutai you're taking fixing for and it is not close.   P3P4 - You are spending a lot of picks on blue cards that I might not play even if I was base blue. Soul Summons is fine here.  The deck: You are splashing blue for Ojutai, who is fine, and some pretty bad blue cards. Taigam's Strike can be OK in a deck with Atarka Efreets or Conifer Striders, but in a deck with 2 cards that have 4 or more power it is just horrid. Elusive Spellfist is a card you play in a controlling blue deck because you didn't get enough other two drops."
lrcast,39nsv1,Greyfeld,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:44:58 2015 UTC,"P1P5 - I'm taking Stormcrag Elemental over Twin Bolt here. That card is a beating and if you megamorph it none of the damage-based removal can hit it.   Stormcrag Elemental is the Marsh Hulk and Crotiq of red megamorphs.  It's a big, fat creature, but it takes so much time and mana to ramp up to that it's usually something you take when there's no other prime removal/creatures left in the pack and/or you're missing some fat at the top of your mana curve.  Twin Bolt is prime removal, end of story."

A lot of times they seem to punish players for doing what they like to try and get them to play the way Wizards wants e.g 8-4 vs 4-3-2-2  The permanent solution to the demand for packs I would like to see is Chaos drafts that have a low payout (payed in random boosters from all the packs ever available on MTGO) and low non booster entry.  I think that would be so fun that the degenerate drafters amongst us would burn through lots of packs :)

I see everyone blaming redemption for falling prices but it doesn't seem like redemption could explain anywhere near this magnitude of drop, as the author says. The draft argument seems perfectly fine.  But there's one major point that isn't being discussed here, imo - redemption still does provide a price floor. A major problem factor right now is that the value of redeemed constructed sets is pretty low. This is to a large extent a seasonal thing - iirc there's an unusually large gap in the timelime between DTK coming out and Origins coming out. Once Origins comes out the problem will be reduced by a lot. If BFZ lives up to the hype it'll be reduced further. Temporary solutions, yes, but worth noting."
lrcast,39jvgo,mtg_liebestod,3,Fri Jun 12 12:46:12 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, I can easily explain the drop:  MM2 are the vast majority of packs being consumed, and/or the incredible disparity of enjoyment between DTK/MM2 has causes a larger than normal drop in play of the current block in limited.  As constructed players do not use packs, there is a vast oversupply which causes the price of a pack to  trend to the exact value of the cards it may contain across the whole magic economy."
lrcast,39jvgo,corran__horn,3,Fri Jun 12 18:14:46 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much what the article is saying.  Although it doesn't explicitly make the point that MM2 is a better draft format than DDF.

More drafts should increase the card supply to a point where constructed decks are easy to make. The flip is true when constructed is popular (demand for AVR cards made people draft that format).   But when booster prices drop to where constructed events aren't worth playing, the demand for cards falls through and the packs get even cheaper. It's up to redemption to hold up demand along with casual players (which also dropped with the new client).   There should be more constructed play created as booster prices drop, just like it is in paper. The reverse is true for MTGO, and it's making a positive feedback loop that lead to the economy going to crap."

The reason mtgo packs are down is because of the current pptq format. The change in pptq format of having no sealed season lowers the demand in sealed and to a lesser degree drafts because people that used to practice using mtgo don't do limited anymore just constructed. This means the demand for constructed like standard and modern went up as well accordingly which puts pressure on price. This is the reason why modern queues are popular right now, not because of modern masters packs. It is modern pptq, modern will be popular."

I like the change to paying out the preferred limited packs, but I'm just a bit thrown off by the concept that the economy is ruined.

lrcast,39jvgo,pahamack,2,Fri Jun 12 08:14:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like interest is cyclical and the market isn't ""broken"" when everything slows down because people aren't excited anymore. Slow play makes for a slow economy.  There's lots of groups of players: some want to make money, some want to collect cards, some want to play anything, etc. I'm not going to focus on any one group again.  When all groups of people are excited about new cards, there's a lot of play going on. That introduces a lot of new cards and I guess that's when the economy isn't ""broken"". After grinding out a ton of tournaments, people start to get bored with the new cards. So they play less. That not only means fewer new cards entering the economy, it means fewer games are being played, or at least the ones being played aren't in the new format. As time passes, more people burn out and everything slows down.  I don't think there's a way to ""fix"" it that doesn't involve trying to answer, ""How do I get someone to play a game they find boring?"" I don't think that's the right question for the game to ask, the better question is, ""Why do people find the format boring before the new format's out?"" I don't think there's good answers to that question, so I think we're stuck with this cycle and if your goal for MTGO is ""I just like to play games of Magic in the standard format"" things will get frustrating at the end."

That's a concern. That's a broken economy and something has to be done. Part of the appeal of MTGO is prizes: it gives real consequences to games and makes people try to squeeze every bit of win% off their cards.

lrcast,39jvgo,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,2,Sat Jun 13 02:45:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I entirely agree with the article, mostly with the part blaming alternative draft queues.  That would be easier to believe if DtK/Frf queues didn't fire regularly but they're still pretty much firing every 5 minutes. That tells me there's still demand for Dtk packs, and that players who need to purchase packs are reaping the benefits.  I'm a pretty degenerate drafter, and I've entered many queues past three in the morning eastern time, and the queues ALWAYS fire.   I think the author fails to address that the MTGO economy is naturally deflationary due to the $16 collected in entry fees in each 8 man draft but the sticker price of the prizes is $48. Entree fees for constructed amount to exactly equal to the sticker price. ($6 per person = $48).  If drafting is exceedingly popular compared to constructed the price will continue to drop , and the price gets closer to $1.33 (16/12).  In the past the price would be held up due to the comparative price of paper magic however the expensive redemption and shipping fees is causing an even greater disconnect between the two products. Prices would never fall that much in paper because 8-4 queues with their tremendously disproportionate payouts don't exist in paper. If you draft at a store and they collect $2 for the prize pool from each player, the prize pool will be $16.   The only solutions would be to either drastically slash limited payouts such that the sticker price of the payout is actually closer to the entree fee, or to slash redemption prices again, so that MTGO prices will be artificially pegged to paper prices. As it is, limited payouts are way too generous, and this will just further and further sink the price of singles and boosters until people stop drafting the set."

The cards inside do circulate in the economy.   Yes, drafts reduce the amount of packs in the economy, yet they add total cards if we consider each pack is equal to 15 cards. Drafts are a product fountain in this way.  There's a reason why, for example, silumgar's scorn is worth about a dollar on starcity while being worth absolutely nothing in MTGO. There's so many more opened cards in MTGO, and I attribute it to imbalanced prize pools for limited online. If the cards aren't worth anything, how could the packs containing them be worth anything?"
lrcast,39jvgo,pahamack,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:44:35 2015 UTC,"I'm still not sure I follow.  You say the cards opened have value and aren't worth anything.  Both of those things cannot be true.  I don't think I'm disagreeing with your overall point, per se, but I think things are a bit more complicated in terms of how they actually play out.  I am tending to think you are perhaps on the right track in saying pay-in vs pay-out is an issue, but I suspect the better way to think about it might be that people are paying in $112 but only getting out $48 plus the value of opened cards (which would be variable but should have an estimatable average EV).  It seems to me it's more likely some combination of desirability of a draft format, availability of a draft format, availability of other draft formats, and EV of cards in the format (both online and, because of redeemability, paper) that might be the better way to frame the issue here.  If only because I'm having a hard time believing anything more than a fraction of the current number of people would generally be interested in drafting if the payouts were something like 3-1, which seems to be what you are suggesting, or at least a logical conclusion based on your arguments."
lrcast,39jvgo,carpeamentum,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:03:28 2015 UTC,"...and that's exactly why mtgo works that way, even though the numbers don't make sense. They want to encourage drafting. In the past card prices are artificially buoyed by paper prices but adding transaction costs on redemption makes those two products even more delineated.  Just think, can any store afford to hold 8-4 equivalent tournaments?  The cards inside are worth something but that worth is being further diminished by card price devaluation. As it is, if we assume the contents of each pack are worth $4 on average, Constructed queues are equal essentially to just outright buying packs in the store ($4), while limited prizes push the price to $1.33.  Eventually, as more drafts happen the price of each pack nears towards $1.33, and this reflects into the price of singles.   As time goes on it makes less and less sense to play constructed, as you are essentially paying $4 per pack."
lrcast,39jvgo,andresacram,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:50:44 2015 UTC,"Overall an interesting read.  I don't know if my experience is abnormal, but when the packs are cheap for a format I don't dislike, I will draft it more.  If I win, I keep playing it.  If I lose, the price of packs influences how many more drafts I start from $/tickets."
lrcast,39jvgo,bearrosaurus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:24:00 2015 UTC,"I think the basic premise of the article is wrong; you can't make that significant a judgment about MTGO's economy looking at prices alone. For the vast majority of players, MTGO isn't either an economics simulator or a retail business, it's a platform for playing a card game. You can't say its economy is broken only because the prices have an up- or downward trend, you have to justify to which extent that trend has been positively or negatively affecting the ability of players to play the game. Can we empirically establish a relationship between prices and event attendance overall? Have prices altered the balance between Constructed and Limited events's attendance, and, if so, is that a positive or negative change? Has the price of packs and singles affected the popularity of formats and teh firing rate of events awarding different prizes, and, again, is this a good change or a bad one? How have price trends for singles and packs affected casual play? The behavior of prices is a very important data point, but, IMHO, it's not the only one, neither the most important one.  Just my 2¢.  P. S.: Also, shouldn't we take into account the online market's efficiency, at least some orders of magnitude greater than paper's? The sheer amount of bots competing against each other, plus the absence of logistical and geographical constraint real-world stores face, also are non-insignificant factors driving the price of singles and packs down, aren't they?"

My gut feeling is that the biggest conclusion for this is that MTGO is not able to maintain player interest in events without the expectation of payout.  Just to be clear, that conclusion is actually the most damning part of this whole article.  The article also missed part of the potential problems caused by high cost events which is that the primary consumer of constructed format prizes is highly influenced by how many people are playing the current limited pool.  And by extension, how fun that format is.  I am going to go out on a limb, but I don't think that DTK is a limited format that can hold a candle to MM2.  So the obvious lack of limited play has removed much of the demand, and the market forces  the prices down.  The problem here is not with a crash in prices, but that play is forced by internal economics."
lrcast,39jvgo,corran__horn,3,Fri Jun 12 15:58:11 2015 UTC,"the magic online economy isn't broken. It still is working perfectly, you just don't like the current conditions.   I can't tell if this is a contrived pedantic argument, or you're just oblivious to what's going on. The fact is, prices are spiraling down out of control and it's getting WORSE as constructed queues become less worth playing, and card prices drop MORE. The safety mechanism to hold up the floor (redemption) isn't doing its job. That makes the system broken.   So the obvious lack of limited play has removed much of the demand, and the market forces the prices down.   So how does this explain KtK boosters (very popular) going below 2 tix WHILE it was being drafted?"
lrcast,39jvgo,pahamack,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:34:17 2015 UTC,"exactly. The more likely explanation is that the popularity of KTK and DTK draft actually contributed to the price crashing because 8 man queues pay out $48 in prizes with only $16 in entry fees, thus, the more something is drafted the closer the pack's real price gets to it's real price as prizes: $1.33 per pack. (that's $16 divided by 12 packs).   In the past, this is mitigated by the cost of paper cards, which effectively pegs the price of online cards and by extension online boosters, however, increased redemption costs are making online and paper much more delineated.  Essentially, increasing the redemption costs has taken out the price controls on online cards, while artificially high payouts for drafts is causing extraordinary deflationary pressure. Essentially, wizards is devaluing their product by overprinting it, and this isn't going to change unless they overhaul how draft queues work, or somehow re-institute some price controls (such as making redememption fees $5 again to facilitate arbitrage of online cards into paper cards)."

And cash actually doesn't have any intrinsic value because it's just foldy paper and ink.  /sarcasm  The value of prizes affects how willing people are to play in tournaments because they have entry fees. If this was a game where you paid your $50 bucks up front and didn't have to pay cash for entry then the economy wouldn't matter but that's not how MTGO works. Concerns are as valid as concerns of overprinting tarmogoyfs in moden masters devaluing cards for collectors.
lrcast,39m78d,transcensionist,3,Fri Jun 12 18:43:14 2015 UTC,"IMO, 5 color isn't a deck you look to build, it's something you fall into by having bombs across multiple colors. You need haymakers to make up for the wild inconsistency from drawing too much/too little ramp. And there's no reason to prioritize ramp/fixing, it's all over the place. Growth and Fiery Flames are just random filler, you shouldn't consider them signals at all.  It's more helpful to think of the archetypes as shells that you build around your powerful cards. Ramp needs bombs, just like UW artifacts needs Glinthawks and Plating, BW spirits needs Nameless and Scuttling Deaths, GW needs Scions and Scatters."
lrcast,39kpx8,oooooog,4,Fri Jun 12 12:11:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely not! Wanted to use it to determine if I should be drafting Dragons, Khans, Theros, or Modern Masters."

lrcast,39j7c5,ElspethSC,5,Fri Jun 12 02:30:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree, this is a great idea. Once you've been playing Limited for a while it's easy to underestimate how valuable bulk commons/uncommons are to new players, but it definitely makes a difference. (For example, I started drafting as a more efficient way to get cards, and just kind of never stopped.)"
lrcast,39j7c5,CelestialBeekeeper,3,Fri Jun 12 03:43:51 2015 UTC,"This exact thing happened to me. I was on the fence, I'd drafted once or twice and enjoyed it but getting a collection seemed impossible. I didn't even have lands or whatever. Then some buddy of mine gave me a couple boxes of all manner of commons and uncommons, exactly like Elspeth said. At that point I guess I felt like a magic player, and got more into it. This is despite the fact I was pretty strictly limited only and barely used them!   So I agree with this. Drawing more people into the hobby is only a good thing, and when it's at such a minimal cost all the better. Not to mention it improves the quality of the community and buys the soul of new players and there we go."
lrcast,39j7c5,SirChuffly,3,Fri Jun 12 08:10:31 2015 UTC,"My wife and I give bulk to new players starting out regularly.  We draft paper magic 2-3 times a week so it builds up quickly. One of our newer drafters has several grandchildren who come to the store and draft occasionally as well. Its a great way to welcome someone into the community, as you have jump started a collection of cards for them."
lrcast,39j7c5,enterthereckoner,3,Fri Jun 12 12:32:34 2015 UTC,There was a LGS I used to go to that had this practice. Prize winners would go through their packs and any cards they didn't want they would pass on to the newest (least experienced player) member there that night. It definitely helped solidify the store community.
lrcast,39j7c5,qundus321,3,Fri Jun 12 13:18:03 2015 UTC,"Great idea and something I've seen at my LGS.  I'm actually in kind of the same position as a newer player, though I've been playing for 20 years. I sold my paper collection and played exclusively online. I got back into paper Magic when Scars of Mirrodin was released, but had my collection stolen so went back to playing online. I just started paper Magic again at the Dragons prerelease.  It's been VERY difficult to get a playable deck together, even something budget like mono red. The thing that's helped me the most has been making sure everything is loaded into PucaTrade. I've sent out tons of commons and uncommons and built up enough points to start trading for playable rares. You can't trade a stack of draft bulk for a Temple of Silence in person, but you can easily do it on PucaTrade if you're patient.  This might be a good recommendation for newer players to go along with helping them with the bulk cards."

Then a week or so later I stumbled onto a huge cache of cards at a thrift store, maybe 100-150 cards bagged for $4 each. Bought like 10 bags, left 8. I didn't understand rarity or blocks so all I knew was I had a ton of new cards! Turned out it was all c/u and maybe 3 lands. Still a lot of great cards to learn about more keywords and card types. Should've bought the other 8 bags, haha. I've only bolstered those cards with 30 or so loose lands (love the Swamp art on the Rise of the Eldrazi cards), maybe 8 booster packs, and recently bought a bulk 400+ Dragons of Tarkir c/u, 12-15 rares, 1/2 mythics, and a bunch more lands.  TL;DR, started playing with promo half decks, got a bunch of thrift store c/u, fell in love. And that thrill of opening a new pack?! Yea, hi, my name is /u/ProfessorApe, and I'm an addict. 😄"
lrcast,39j7c5,ProfessorApe,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:13:53 2015 UTC,"Meant to add this is a great idea and will definitely do it when I need to unload some c/u.

It mostly revolved around which Fallen Empires card we'd first pick and discussing the art direction of Homarids.   (Spoiler: this actually comes up on the next TTC)  Also, this was a good episode of LR!"
lrcast,39gbk0,Graham_LRR,7,Sat Jun 13 09:38:48 2015 UTC,"I really appreciated the episode, LSV, and thank you for sharing your experience in such a detailed way.  I'll let you know one thing that I really found useful, and one thing I'd like to hear more about.  The thing I find particularly useful is what I guess I'd call a pragmatism when it comes to having ""rules"" for one's play.  This also came up in the Biggest Traps episode.  Your main thesis with ""rules"" seems to be that they are there not because they are good in and of themselves, but because they serve a purpose: to shortcut decisions that have a ""correct"" choice the vast majority (but not 100%) of the time.  This shows me that I should keep in mind that the assumptions that I have about the ""correct"" way for me to play must have a purpose.  They usually do; after all 99% rounds up to 100% nearly every time.  Still, as I develop as a player, I need to take the time to re-evaluate my assumptions on a regular basis.  Keeping in mind that rules and assumptions are only good so long as they are useful is something I've really appreciated learning from this and previous podcasts, so thanks.  It's also something that I can take from the game and bring into everyday life.  Finding things like that, where I can use skills that come from this game that I consider to be a great hobby to impact other parts of my day, is almost like 2-for-1ing at life.  The thing I'd like to hear more about is related to a side comment you made in this episode.  You mentioned that you found Malcolm Gladwell's Blink useful.  You said that it emphasized the power that the unconscious mind has on our decisions.  Is there any more that you can tell us about that, either as it relates to MTG, or how you've seen it at work in any other aspect of your life?  The idea that there is a large reserve in the unconscious mind really appeals to me in a general sense, but I'd like to know if there are concrete examples of how it has helped you.  I know that I will have to read the book to truly get it, but I think hearing from you would help add to my understanding in a way that simply reading about the Getty kouros wouldn't.  Thanks again for this episode, and overall, for the dedication and imagination you bring to discussing complicated topics.  I'm looking forward to hearing more of these longform level-up shows in the future."
lrcast,39gbk0,burgler,5,Thu Jun 11 16:34:56 2015 UTC,"I think the ""rules"" could be called ""heuristics"" if we're being precise. Heuristics are imperfect rules that usually work, so they simplify decision making. ""Don't tell lies"" is a heuristic because it's usually a good rule to follow but occasionally isn't (e.g. most people would say it's ok to lie to the Nazis to protect Anne Frank).  The concept of a bias is closely related to the concept of a heuristic. Biases are basically heuristics that make sense in certain contexts but don't translate well to others. For example, Results Oriented Thinking. If I go to a restaurant and the meal is totally delicious, it makes sense for me to assume that this is an awesome restaurant based on the result I got (a great meal). But in MTG there is a level of complexity and randomness that makes this heuristic break down. You can't automatically assume a card is good just because you got a good result with it.  I think Blink is a nice overview of some of these concepts. If you want to dig deeper, I really recommend Taleb's The Black Swan and the other books in his Incerto trilogy. These are directed at concepts in finance and investment, but the ideas translate extremely well into the world of MTG. If you want to go really deep and read academic papers on this, Heuristics and Biases by Khaneman and Tversky is the central work."
lrcast,39gbk0,bitterrootmtg,4,Thu Jun 11 17:05:57 2015 UTC,"The Black Swan is also a good read. I've read most things Gladwell and Taleb have written, as I like reading that sort of stuff, but I still think Blink is the book that has most impacted me when it comes to Magic."
lrcast,39gbk0,RolandofGan,2,Thu Jun 11 17:15:07 2015 UTC,"Do you have a recommended reading list or just a list of books you like fiction or nonfiction?  Also, you mention your college days occasionally on the show, did you study Math?"

Kahneman's book is a little more solid for the wealth of experimental data, and for the diversity of ideas that really are all about the same (two) thing(s) – slow, deliberate, effortful, conscious thinking and fast, intuitive, heuristics. I really liked the way you two talked about this, and I think you'll find that this book is precisely those ideas, and at least for me every time you two (and your friends) say such stuff, I remember some Kahneman experiment or the other."

Thank you very much.   Edit: That was the first time I had heard ""chump attack"" before. I like it.   The first ~ 70% was stuff I think I knew and practiced but wasn't consciously aware of. You sort of cleaned it up to help me shortcut as well as better verbalise it when discussing the game with less experienced players. This is VERY helpful.   The last part covered some stuff that I am not sure if I have been doing or not. I always approached it completely fresh each time about attacking with the 2/2 and just never came to a definite conclusion. I just could never solve that situation and work out a solid baseline.

lrcast,39hqpb,rightseid,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:11:46 2015 UTC,"So this deck was a blast to play, mostly because of turn 3 mulldrifter into turn 4 aethersnipe.   I think the most questionable call was souleater, but I didn't have great replacements for it. I would have gone with a third 2/1 if I had any elemental lords, but with smokebraiders as my only elemental payoffs I went with souleater.  I also considered a plains for souleater/tribal flames, but it seemed pretty greedy with thunderblust as 3 point flames are already very good.  Pack 1 was a pretty gross mess and even halfway through pack 2 I was pretty divided between a graft deck and an elemental deck.  I managed to wheel some elementals pack 2 and got a ton to work with pack 3.  Overall this draft emphasized that the high power level, ease of fixing, and linearity of this format gives you a lot more time to find your lane than a ""regular"" format."
lrcast,39hqpb,IzDaisho,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:23:08 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, did you start out with a Mulldrifter? I have been thinking that the majority of decks with blue in them (UR elementals, UG graft and UB... UB... wait did they forget to give UB an archetype?!?!) are generally the weaker archetypes. As such I generally will avoid taking a strong blue card early because there's no real path for success unless the color is wildly underdrafted."
lrcast,39hqpb,IzDaisho,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:52:02 2015 UTC,"Second pick, I got 2 late smokebraiders pack 1 which really got me interest in elementals.

That makes perfect sense about going into elementals. It's a shame you didn't see too many other payoff cards (though that is a symptom of the deck, not really much payoff for going into elementals).  What you say about splashable blue cards makes good sense and aligns with what I was mentioning. The strong blue cards should be homeless in most drafts. That allows the five color deck to pick them up at a discount and reap the benefits."

lrcast,39hqpb,IzDaisho,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:27:23 2015 UTC,"The way I view it is that it's solid but it is only playable in one out of the 10 or so archetypes. If you are playing a good version of the BR bloodthirst deck it's good but even then it's pretty replaceable with a Gorehorn Minotaurs. (In other words, it's narrow and replaceable).

lrcast,39gh4x,Malarazz,4,Thu Jun 11 16:06:08 2015 UTC,"You nailed it.   This also comes up in the draft portion. Maybe you see two or three packs with cards that signal you should be in a different color, but for whatever reason you ignore the signals. Then you see another pack with the same signal. It might be correct to change color at that point, even though you missed the ""best chance"" to switch colors several packs ago."
lrcast,39gh4x,bitterrootmtg,3,Thu Jun 11 16:39:42 2015 UTC,"Well, this is slightly more correct because what you are weighing is ""the cards I already have + the quality of cards I expect to get if I switch"" vs. ""the cards I already have + the quality of cards I expect to get if I don't switch"" and it is in fact true that the later in the draft you get the more important the cards you already have are and the less important future picks are."

lrcast,39gh4x,bitterrootmtg,2,Thu Jun 11 18:24:51 2015 UTC,"Another interesting wrinkle which should be considered (though should definitely not be the only deciding factor) is that the longer you wait, the less you get paid off. In pack 2 the more cards you pass, the more likely your neighbors to the left will be in your new color.   Most of the time (Especially early in the pack) it is correct to ignore what you pass but if you are shipping along great cards in the same color packs 3-6 and then move in by pack 7, you likely have created a drafter to the left in that color.   Of course, it goes by a draft by draft situation and if you feel your colors are not open then you should absolutely jump in and risk suffering the pack 2 consequences because you will absolutely be rewarded come pack 3."
lrcast,39gh4x,IzDaisho,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:42:06 2015 UTC,"Sunk costs:       In economics and business decision-making, a sunk cost is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. Sunk costs are sometimes contrasted with prospective costs, which are future costs that may be incurred or changed if an action is taken. Both retrospective and prospective costs may be either fixed (continuous for as long as the business is in operation and unaffected by output volume) or variable (dependent on volume) costs.  However, many economists consider it a mistake to classify sunk costs as ""fixed"" or ""variable."" For example, if a firm sinks $1 million on an enterprise software installation, that cost is ""sunk"" because it was a one-time expense and cannot be recovered once spent. A ""fixed"" cost would be monthly payments made as part of a service contract or licensing deal with the company that set up the software. The upfront irretrievable payment for the installation should not be deemed a ""fixed"" cost, with its cost spread out over time. Sunk costs should be kept separate. The ""variable costs"" for this project might include data centre power usage, etc.    Image i     Interesting: Escalation of commitment | Contestable market | Psychology of previous investment | Anthropologist   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Recently LSV made an educated guess as to what was taken from a pack in the Top 8 of GP Atlantic City, but that was a high-level tournament among many players he personally knew.

lrcast,39faqq,Greyfeld,-1,Thu Jun 11 17:32:45 2015 UTC,"I don't play on MTGO, so the overall power level of the decks I face when I draft is lower, on the average.  The algorithm they use for pack generation on MTGO is all out of whack, which tends to result in a higher number of power cards floating around in any given draft.  In your standard paper draft, there usually isn't enough quality Formidable and Exploit floating around to support more than one or two players per pod.  And since white is usually pretty open (most people jumping onto black and red), it's not asking too much to p1p1 a Pacifism, and end up getting a solid deck, while the other players fight over the scraps of the ""prime"" colors.  Also, at 1W, it's very splashable, making it very flexible in that regard."

I don't suppose you have a source on that? I thought MTGO was supposed to mimic the same collation as paper booster packs.  Regarding P1P1 Pacifism I don't think it's better than Flatten or Cobra, but P1P2 it could be if you first picked a white card. So the cards taken could indeed have been Ultimate Price (P1P1) and Pacifism (P1P2, player took a white card 1st)."
lrcast,39faqq,IzDaisho,0,Thu Jun 11 16:05:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry, no source.  Just my own personal experience.  Course, I could be accused of anecdotal bias.  But between the MTGO drafts I've watched online, and the ones I've tried personally, I've seen a ridiculously high number of power cards in any individual draft.  It's not at all uncommon to go through multiple packs with big removal in several different colors that somehow managed to get ""passed over"" in the first 5-6 picks.  That sort of thing would lead one to believe that the other drafters are just really bad... but then you play your matches, and their decks are just as fucking nuts as yours, sometimes better."
lrcast,39faqq,taumxd,2,Thu Jun 11 16:21:34 2015 UTC,"What you're describing seems to me like stronger players who are better at drafting. It is likely that more casual players will frequent local game stores for the social aspect of the game while more experienced and serious players will seek out the online program where they can perform more repetitions.  Generally the better you are at figuring out what's open, the better you draft will be. If your neighbors are also smarter, they will steer clear of your colors and build good decks themselves. It may seem like overall there are higher power levels because a significant portion of good cards will end up in sideboards.  At least that seems like a more likely explanation to me than MTGO distributing a higher power level of cards."

Then again, I do realize that my LGS has a good number of younger or inexperienced or tunnel-visioned players (at least some of which qualities I share).

Basically, weaker players are more likely to send confusing signals. This results in players taking the best cards out of the pack more often than the best card for their deck.

lrcast,39edgc,priceQQ,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:54:42 2015 UTC,They are OKish in my opinion - you can't really put equipment on them which makes them not that great (except if you are prepared to pay a lot of mana every turn to re-equip)...  Though sometimes it is really nice to have some early pressure in the air.
lrcast,39edgc,Sony_Black,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:35:19 2015 UTC,"I think they're fine but I just felt they were a little too demanding in terms of activating bloodthirst and just keeping up general pressure while curving out. I think they definitely have a place in White/red, but that home is better suited in a deck emphasizing a White & Artifact theme featuring Court Humonculus, Cranial Plating,  Darksteel Citadel, Dispatch, Rusted Relic, etc; with Red bringing up more of a splash and not relying on it for things like Goblin Fireslinger (which I didn't have anyway), or even Gorehorn Minotaurs - its main presence being for burn or creatures with just a single R requirement."
lrcast,39edgc,Hiredgoonthug,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:06:13 2015 UTC,"I've been finding that the hawks are actually extremely maindeckable, as is 1ish terashi's grasp / sundering vitae.  If I built the same deck I'd add those 3 main and take out an apostle's blessing, a flayer husk (or sickleslicer), and a hobgoblin.  Overall it's an awesome deck to play, I drafted it one time at vegas except i had 3 shikari and got to go carapace, shikari, equip pretty much every game. it was a blast."
lrcast,39edgc,Greyfeld,2,Thu Jun 11 06:37:52 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with you though see my comment to priceQQ. I'm also a huge fan of grasp/vitae and agree it's useful in most matchups. I think an Apostle's Blessing or two is more flexible mainboard and saves you from those blowouts where you spend an entire turn equipping just to catch a removal or Vapor Snag. It can also mean evading blockers for last points of lethal damage.   I admit Flayer Husk & Sickleslicer aren't that impressive, and 3x Copper Caparace was about 1 extra than I really wanted to be running (wished one could have been a Kitesail) & I often sided one out when it was time to pull in the 3 Terashi's Grasps. I don't agree with benching Hobgoblin. Effectively a 4/2 beater for 3 that's troublesome to block and bonkers with equipment is exactly where this deck wants to be.   I'd have liked more Shikari and probably would have ran one over Sickleslicer and maybe another over a Slaughtermaster.   It gets a little tricky thinking bout the perfect balance of things when you have a Bloodshot Trainee in the mix. I feel like the deck wants to run only two Copper Carapace but Trainee wants at least three ways to pump two power. I guess I'm neglecting the premium Darksteel Axe or maybe Cranial Plating that this build would really like to have."

I looked for other shops but not many were running MM2 this week. I also skipped Fate & Dragons so I'd be at such a disadvantage attempting to draft them that it led me to go into an event I knew I'd lose money on even if I won.   I just look at it as buying 3 MM2 packs at retail and putting in $5 toward a small prize pool.

lrcast,39dre2,Tlamat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:49:59 2015 UTC,"P1: Probably Overwhelming Stampede here.  I like Next Invader and Vengeful Rebirth, but the Stampede is far less likely to wheel (on top of being just the stronger card), and I don't really want to jump into two colors on my first pick unless it's for something more amazing.  P2: With the P1 I took, my first instinct is to go Nest Invader and start going tokens, but Savage Twister is very, very strong (stronger than Vengeful Rebirth, IMO).  However, if we end up going tokens, Twister is going to get sideboarded because the two don't go well together.  However, I take the Twister anyway, because it's just that strong.  Worse comes to worse, I'm not in tokens and I take some other archetype.  P3: Having split my decision in two directions already, I've no qualms with going 3 ways at this point.  Gnarlid Pack is a solid 2-drop, and Scion of the Wild is great for tokens, but I think I'd rather hedge and snag Dispatch in case artifacts end up being open.  P4: Electrolize is probably the strongest card in this pack, but we've already split between three different archetypes and colors, picking up a fourth color here isn't going to solidify us into anything.  It's probably the smarter pick, just for the sake of staying open, but I like picking up the Alloy Myr for artifacts, since it'll also keep me open if I decide to go in another direction.  P5: Water Servant and Narcolepsy look nice, but since I've already decided to hedge toward artifacts, I'm taking the easy Lodestone Golem here.  P6: I'm tempted to take the Shrivel for my sideboard because of the Nest Invaders I passed, but Narcolepsy is too good to pass up, so I take that instead.  P7: Gladly take the Qumulox here.  Telling Time wouldn't be a bad draw, either, were the AFF creature not staring me in the face.  P8: I'll grab the Somber Hoverguard, easily."

First insists on not being cute, sticking to fundamentals like creature curve and removal, staying open then ends up talking about first picking a cute card (algae gharial).  I get it, it's a powerful card. But it's also a synergy card and modern masters is about picking powerful cards that go into multiple decks early and picking synergy cards when you find the open lane. What if the guy to your right picks up all the eldrazi token makers because he's in gw tokens?  I kind of wish they'd talked about the synergy vs pure power level tradeoff in limited, as clearly Marshall wanted to talk about Algae Gharial since he was also gushing about it in the show."
lrcast,39bgsj,pahamack,9,Wed Jun 10 18:30:42 2015 UTC,"The thing is, Algae Gharial isn't cute, it is a power card.  Any green deck that can cast it can leverage it given that they have a way to avoid dying.  All you need are a few other creatures on the table when you cast it, and when you untap, you are heavily advantaged.  From that point, you play a regular game of limited, but you have an inevitability engine that will eventually win.  Doesn't matter if you have eldrazi spawn or not.  The card certainly gets much better with eldrazi spawn or tokens, but your Aquastrand Spider is going to trade for their 2/2, and you are going to kill something with Spread the Sickness or Nameless Inversion.  All of these things grow the Truth, and eventually the Truth becomes the Void, forcing your opponent to block every turn until they can't, and then they die.  Very little setup required."
lrcast,39bgsj,Carribi,2,Wed Jun 10 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"it's also a 1/1 that costs 4. That's not a very good blocker. It takes a while for it to actually get to a decent size.  Are you actually telling me you will pick algae gharial over nameless inversion or arrest? Because that seems completely wrong.  Without sacrifice synergies you're talking about something that EVENTUALLY becomes a 4/4 with no evasion for 4. This is in a format where a 5/5 flier for 5 is completely normal and not surprising. Where the ground is littered with chump blockers.   It's cute, and I'm surprised at Marshall for engaging in the hyperbole he often decries. You should be very disappointed if you have to p1p1 algae gharial."
lrcast,39bgsj,pahamack,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:10:14 2015 UTC,"The thing is, once it gets up to 4 or 5 power, it is going to be the biggest thing on the board in most matchups.  The creatures in this set are by and large pretty small, though there are definite exceptions.  Regardless, you only have to keep the Gharial out of combat for a turn or two on average before it gets at start rumbling, and that is when the tables turn.  No I wouldn't pick it over Nameless Inversion, but that's also the best common in the set.  Arrest, probably not.  But again, Arrest is one of the best removal spells in the set.  There are a lot of things I could see taking the Gharial over though, just because it slots into every green archetype reasonably well and when it's good, it's amazing."

If I could name 3 commons just like that off the top of my head that I'd rather take over an uncommon then you can't be happy having that as your p1p1 especially when you know other people are opening stuff like comet storm and battlegrace angel.  AGAIN, i'm not saying the card is unplayable, or that it's not good even, but Marshall is engaging in hyperbole, one that's especially out of place in an article in which Ben Stark is talking about how keeping it simple is often the way to win.  If he had to talk about a card in MM2015 why not burst lightning? A card that fits both the wild slash and reach of shadows slots in a deck.

For you to be happy p1p1ing this must mean it can at least clear the bar of the best commons. As someone I don't remember once said, modern sets are such that you're never that happy picking a common as your p1p1."
lrcast,39bgsj,oraymw,2,Wed Jun 10 21:44:26 2015 UTC,It's about on par with Nameless Inversion. Better than Arrest/Burst Lightning. About as good as Scatter the Seeds.

It was slightly disappointing that the author didn't rate the reprints. Though none of them seemed to have a particularly tricky rating."
lrcast,39amw4,Malarazz,4,Wed Jun 10 15:17:38 2015 UTC,"Scholar of Athreos was a good card in Theros and this creature is just better due to being mono-color.     What? No, that's just wrong. First, Scholar's ability also gained you life. That is a huge deal. Second, Scholar came down on turn three and had a good body for early blocking. And as a result of that, drawing it off the top late game often meant you could activate it the turn you play it."
lrcast,39amw4,Csquared08,8,Thu Jun 11 00:20:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's a little premature to start rating cards without seeing the whole set. That being said, the Avaricious Dragon is nowhere near an A-."
lrcast,39amw4,Era_Pls,2,Wed Jun 10 16:34:31 2015 UTC,A 4 mana 4/4 flyer is a B+ I would say. The ability seems worth a half grade.

If you untap with it, you're looking at a bomb sure, but I would hate to cast this guy, discard my card(s) and then have it killed after my opponent untaps.  An A- doesn't ask anything of you to have it be good. A B+ is still too generous for a card that asks you to bait out removal or protect this guy for a whole turn."
lrcast,39amw4,Era_Pls,2,Fri Jun 12 00:04:30 2015 UTC,"Akroan Jailer is probably a C/C-, since it taps any creature, flyers included. Lightning Javelin is probably closer to a C since four mana sorcery speed is quite cumbersome.   Good article overall :)"
lrcast,39amw4,blindfremen,3,Wed Jun 10 17:08:30 2015 UTC,"Holding up 3 mana every turn really hurts, though. Thassa's Ire was never that good in Theros block, for example."

I think the Jailer/Dunecaster effect is fine in aggressive decks since you get 'threat of activation'. For defense though, 3 mana is way too much to hold up."
lrcast,39amw4,bearrosaurus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:44:04 2015 UTC,"Tappers don't benefit from ""threat of activation."" An aggressive deck actually needs to spend the mana to tap down a blocker or it'll get blocked.  For an example of threat of activation, take an ability like the one on Atarka Beastbreaker; if they choose not to block, you don't need to activate it."
lrcast,39amw4,samiamthelaw,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:07:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I stuck it in quotes.   If I have a tapper, you have to leave two blockers behind because I have the threat of getting past one guy. In that way, jailer can hold back two 3/3's without even spending mana. Late in the game, I can even threaten to tap two guys within one turn cycle.   Of course, you only get this if you're on the aggro."

It's 2 mana and unless the power level for the rest of the cards is insane it should be killing most of the 1-4 drops in most limited formats. Especially against French vanilla creatures it's powerful    The burn spell is crap relative to bolt but will most likely be playable. It's powerful and at that stage being able to scry can help quite a bit. It's just a bit weaker then the 1rr version and more splashable if red is your secondary colour

lrcast,397lmv,aparnell7,4,Tue Jun 9 20:54:42 2015 UTC,"I don't get the ROTTY feel from this article everyone else seems to get. Sure, it leads with the record, but then it drops into categorical comparisons between the two. I don't think the conclusion is, ""Since this deck went 3-0, you should emulate it"" but instead, ""This deck went 3-0 because it has qualities that are common in very good draft decks."" The article doesn't blindly discuss what was good in the 3-0 deck, it compares it to the 1-2 deck in several categories and even notes that Deck A had a higher power level in its top-end cards.  I think it's safe to say this kind of analysis is fine. Decks win when, ""Do I have an answer to this threat?"" is statistically likely to be ""yes"". A deck with 7 removal spells is more likely to have at least one in hand than a deck with 2 removal spells and a combat trick. A deck with a smoother curve is less likely to get hung up during the critical 4-6 mana phase of the game. Add those two together and you have a deck more likely to remove its opponent's threats than progress to the end of the game in a favorable position, and to some extent curve + removal is more important than the top end of the curve. That's how I think the article is meant to be read, and I think it's true in general (though you can certainly imagine decks that break the rule.)  I'd like to see more discussion about ""good curves"", because I think it's the weakest part of my strategic knowledge and this article cleared some things up for me."
lrcast,397lmv,Slypenslyde,3,Wed Jun 10 12:50:13 2015 UTC,"Interesting article.  I do strongly disagree with calling cards like [[Butcher's Glee]] and [[Coat with Venom]] removal, however.  They are combat tricks.  They both do a good job of helping your creature win combat (Glee more so than Coat; the two toughness is good when the creatures are close in size, but not wildly different) but if the threat you need to get rid of doesn't get into combat, these cards do nothing.If you've got a bunch of ground creatures and a Butcher's Glee, you're still gonna die to a 2/2 flier.  I think it's valid to put these cards in a different category of card, one which isn't as important as removal.  I mean, even within the article the terminology is inconsistent.  If Glee and Coat are ""removal"" spells, then why isn't [[Dromoka's Gift]]?  It's also an instant that can blow your opponent out in combat."

I absolutely agree that curve + removal are two of the most important things in limited and this was the strongest part of the article.  That being said, the second deck lacks synergy and finishers. The removal is fine but is nothing incredible. It seems like a middle of the road deck at best and would not be my example of a deck to emulate in the format."
lrcast,397lmv,IzDaisho,2,Tue Jun 9 22:02:00 2015 UTC,"The point of the article is that you can't simply judge decks based on their record or whether they seem like middle ground or not. Also that it is not enough to just say removal and curve are important, because the subtle differences between decks that both have a decent curve and removal can be the difference in winning the draft and not. These are not intended to be decks to emulate, they're case studies that allow us to compare and contrast how some small details between two decks that seem so similar can make such a big difference."
lrcast,397lmv,ErasmusFenris,5,Tue Jun 9 22:18:46 2015 UTC,"My main problem with the article is the heavy focus at the top on record. The second deck does fix some of the areas where the first is lacking, as you call out, with the lack of early plays and removal. But it has inherent weaknesses in itself. Starting by calling it a 3-0 deck and trying to see how the first deck can be more like the second seems like a bad place to be.   That being said it is an interesting topic. I like the idea behind comparing two somewhat similar decks and pointing out the small but key differences. I don't think the analysis needs the crutch of record to prove your point and at least to me, it detracted from the main thesis.  But I do want to say that it was a good read and I'm always happy to see new, informed limited content and enjoy discussing it :)"

You generally don't try to hit 5 drop too).   Khans was definitely an 18 land format, since you wanted to unmorph at 5 every game no matter what.

In limited, you'll almost never see something this clear cut.

lrcast,396mtd,cferejohn,3,Tue Jun 9 21:40:18 2015 UTC,If you can find a streamer who commentates on his plays and why he does them thats a good way to learn.  I think even marshall has some draft videos where he does this. Dont have a link off the top of my head though.
lrcast,396mtd,Rakyn87,5,Tue Jun 9 17:14:37 2015 UTC,"Noah Sandler streams on Twitch and posts draft videos once a week to MTGOAcademy.  He is the best that I've seen at explaining his draft picks and gameplay decisions.  To give you an idea of his level of detail, he has spent over 5 minutes on stream describing his thought process on which land to play on turn 1.  Marshall is usually very good at this as well."
lrcast,396mtd,ResetPress,2,Tue Jun 9 17:19:00 2015 UTC,"Seconded, by far the most methodical streamer I've ever seen. He really drives home the edge you can get carefully taking the time to think through every line."
lrcast,396mtd,rightseid,3,Tue Jun 9 18:20:31 2015 UTC,"Go back and watch your replays (if you play on MTGO, if not play back the game in your head)  I find this thought process valuable:  Why did I lose this game?  Could I have prevented it in any way?  Is that a reasonable line of play?  This process allows you to find exactly where the game went wrong. You can determine whether you could have done anything differently to put yourself in a winning position. If you just stop after question 2 you get into results oriented thinking very quickly, but including the third question allows you to figure out what you did wrong and how to make sure that doesn't happen.  Once you start recognizing game after game what you've done wrong you will avoid making the same mistakes.   Example: I was playing in a phantom MM2 draft. I lost a game against a very aggressive RW double strike deck. My opponent played Nobilis of War to give his Viashino Slaughtermaster (Already equipped with Flayer Husk) +2/0. He was able to attack me for 8 damage down to 8 life past my Gnarlid Pack which had attacked the turn before. The next turn I drop an Apocolypse Hydra for 5 (giving me 10 counters) that was in my hand the whole time. He hit me for 5 in the air before I was able to kill the Nobilis with a Fiery Fall and stabilize at 3. I died to lightning bolt the next turn.   To me that seemed like a game that was relatively tricky to win. Then when I went back and rewatched I had made two key mistakes that led to my loss.  Firstly, my Gnarlid Pack. I got in for 2 damage knocking him from 20 to 18, expecting to take 4 from the double striker. Instead I took 8 damage. Looking back, the only thing that mattered was surviving until I could drop the Hydra. Sure, I can't play around Nobilis of War, or even a pump spell for the Double Striker, but I could play around a Darksteel Axe (one of which I had seen in game 1), or a copper carapice. Not only that but I am so likely to win any game where Hydra lands and I untap that the 2 damage may as well have been irrelevant. So I should not have attacked with the Gnarlid Pack.  Another mistake requires rewinding to turn 3. My opponent has a Spikeshot Elder and a Viashino Slaughtermaster. I have a Tribal Flames and no other play so I know I want to kill one of his creatures. I kill the Spikeshot. Even then, my gameplan is to survive to cast Hydra. Following that plan I should kill the creature that represents the biggest chance that I lose before I cast Hydra. While Elder can take over the game given enough time, my chances of winning revolve around him waiting too long to kill me. If he follows the Elder plan, it will be significantly slower and I will have time for my Hydra to trump his Elder + Equipment.  Those are two game changing mistakes that seemed relatively innocuous when I made the in game decisions. Without the replays I might not have realized I even made an error. But when going back you can notice how each of these plays were contrary to my long term strategy of winning the game. Once you do it enough, you will start to notice these mistakes more quickly and change your strategies around them."
lrcast,396mtd,IzDaisho,2,Tue Jun 9 18:31:10 2015 UTC,"One thing that helps me is to take a few seconds and think through the various plays I have available - what happens if I play this instead of this, what if the opponent has this, what am I going to play next, how would I block if my opponent attacked me with this, what happens if the opponent blocks, what happens if the opponent doesn't block, etc., etc.  Just take your time and think through the different scenarios. There aren't hard and fast rules, but generally, if you're in doubt, attack if its questionable and save your removal until it will win you the game or prevent you from losing the game.  Another good resource is Reid Duke's level one series on mtg.com. Videos help, too, and just playing more is the best way to improve - run your draft decks against buddies or clan members if you're playing online."
lrcast,396mtd,kccmtg,2,Tue Jun 9 17:18:30 2015 UTC,"Lot's of people suggesting watching draft videos to hear the streamer's reasoning.

lrcast,396mtd,hououinkyoumaQ,2,Wed Jun 10 10:39:14 2015 UTC,"There's an old maxim in Magic that goes something like, 'there are no wrong threats, only wrong answers'. While a little simplistic, I think this sums up one of the bigger challenges of Limited, which is when and how to use what removal you were able to draft. An average draft deck will have something like 13-15 creatures and 8-10 spells. If half of your spells are removal, that only gives you 4-5 ways to outright remove an opposing creature. A lot of times (and I do this myself), I see players using their removal on targets that aren't really threats. They will kill an early creature or something because they have the spell available and want to 'do something', when they really should be more discerning. Whenever possible, you ought to rely on your own creatures to block and trade with anything that doesn't have evasion, or use a pump spell, or whatever. The straight up removal should be used to take out something you simply can't deal with otherwise or interact with meaningfully before it kills you. Flyers, unblockable creatures, powerful utility men that rarely enter the red zone, and obviously opposing bombs. More often than not I'll watch someone blow their removal on something and then lose when the real threat shows up a turn or two later. Hold that removal. Magic is a game of imperfect information; the longer you can delay a decision, the more information you have, and the more likely it is that you'll be able to make a good decision and win versus a bad decision and lose."
lrcast,396mtd,shinianx,2,Wed Jun 10 11:34:31 2015 UTC,"One more piece of advice - don't give your opponents information if it can be helped. This can apply from turn 1, based on which land you lead off with. For example:  Consider a DTK match where you're playing a W/B deck. You have more black than white and have no cards requiring WW. Your opening hand is Plains, Plains, Swamp, Sandcrafter Mage, Flatten, Misthoof Kirin, and Hand of Silumgar.  Turn 1, you play the swamp. Turn 2, you draw a swamp. Do you play it or a plains? I play the swamp and cast the Hand of Silumgar - I don't need double white and letting my opponent know my second color may affect his game play choices. He may use removal or trade off more aggressively if he has me on B/R.  On turn 3, you draw another swamp. You can play a land and a creature this turn and attack with your Hand of Silumgar. My play here is to attack with the Hand before playing anything. If he has a creature, my second color again can influence his blocking decisions.   Just a small example, but you can sometimes get your opponent to make bad plays if they take you for a different type of deck than you really are."
lrcast,396mtd,kccmtg,2,Wed Jun 10 16:40:01 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion, when watching gameplay videos on YouTube, pause at key moments when the player has priority. Try to figure out what line you would take and why, then resume the video and see what they did. Was it better than your line, the same, or worse? Why? This will help you identify potential gaps in your decision making process and gives you immediate feedback on what another (probably better) player would do.   Now I only do this on complex boardstates but it still helps"

You can just grab one of your draft decks and run it against one of your friend's draft decks in the casual room.

lrcast,395rj0,TheJediCounsel,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:01:46 2015 UTC,"I made it work in a draft where I P1P1 Narset, P1P2 Teachings (because I felt like having fun, not because I thought it would be the best thing to do).  Teachings was pretty good, especially when backed up with rebound spells and Student of Ojutai.  The deck only had 9 or so creature spells, with a couple of Ojutai's Summons and Soul Summons plus a monument to keep my creature count reasonable.  Narset was very underwhelming, in comparison.  I never had a spell that I wanted to give rebound that didn't already have rebound, and the +1 never drew me a card, and my opponents were just able to ignore her.  Ultimately went 2-1 with the deck, losing to the aggressive RB deck in round 1, although the match-up did not feel unbeatable.  It's worth noting though that the competition at my LGS can be a bit soft at times, so take this with a grain of salt.  tl;dr the card can be real, but you have to really work for it.  You can probably get it later in the pack than pick two, but you need to plan for it ASAP."

It would be helpful to see if there may have been a missed opportunity.  I play the Phantom queues and haven't noticed signaling issues, though I think it's important to heed LSV and Marshall's advice and try to keep pivots open and be cautious about committing to linear archetypes."
lrcast,397x85,transcensionist,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:30:43 2015 UTC,"Rare Draft  There definitely were some picks that could have changed the way the draft flowed. Tried to include as much of my reasoning at the time as I remember.  This was my 2nd MM2015 draft, so my card evaluation may be way off on some of these. Was definitely a hot mess, almost ran out of time building it."
lrcast,397x85,transcensionist,3,Wed Jun 10 12:55:09 2015 UTC,"P1p1 - Agreed w/ Guildmage. You mentioned taking it since Fiery Fall was the only removal. I don't think there's any removal I'd take over the Guildmage, except Profane Command at rare & Comet Storm at mythic. LSV describes Guildmage well as a pseudo-mythic. It's just that good.  P1p2 - YIKES. Runed Servitor? This card is filler at best. Considerations here are Dread Drone (good in G/B tokens, pairs decently w/ Guildmage), Repeal (just a solid card in itself, doesn't match particularly well w/ Guildmage), Ethercase Knight (good affinity card), Everflowing Chalice (solid for ramp decks), or Mystic Snake (probably the most individually powerful card here.) I'd go with Dread Drone to stick to the token theme for now. I don't think the other cards are strong enough to pull me away.. though I could see taking Mystic Snake or Chalice since your mage will be good in a ramp / five color deck too.  P1p3 - Smacks forehead Thrive? This card is MAYBE filler, even worse than Servitor. Don't pick this card. Try to never play it. It's not a great pack so at this point we need to take something for a possible alternate direction from tokens. Sunspear Shikari is ok in RW or Affinity as both will be glad to have some number of equipment, Scuttling Death is very good in the Spirits deck and unplayable in other decks unless you nab a couple Nameless Inversions to bring back, Glint Hawk Idol is good in Affinity and probably OK in RW, Thrummingbird is alright with Graft / Sunburst though it's very fragile, Gruul Turf is very solid if you end up in Green or Red, Bloodshot Trainee is good though it will only fit into decks with a few decent equipment, and Gorehorn Minotaurs is a very solid red card; I think it's the best card here so I'll take it.  P1p4 - I agree w/ Scion here. Back on the token plan, I like it. It is very strong in a dedicated token deck.  P1p5 - Kavu Primarch has definitely wrecked me at times but I think it's just underwhelming in general. On the other hand Necrogenesis is a mighty card in the token deck; I'll take it.  P1p6 - You're right Citadel is good in the Affinity deck. And had I picked differently previously I may pick it up here. As it stands I'll take the Vampire Lacerator or Sickle Ripper for this GB tokens deck. Let's say Lacerator since it's a 1 drop.  P1p7 - Agreed with Ally, reluctantly passing Spitebellows. Such a solid card.  P1p8 - Primarch is ok here.   P1p9 - Affinity is definitely open. I think you're right that it's the deck you should be in for this seat. At this point we should probably switch into it. Besides Dread Drone and our p1p1 Guildmage we didn't find any token producers so it's likely overdrafted here. There are 3 great Affinity cards in this pack with Citadel, Relic, & Homonculus. Go for it w/ the Homonculus, hopefully all of these cards will be appearing in droves in the next two packs. Also, I wouldn't take Changeling as a signal that spirits is open. It's definitely good in the spirits deck but a stronger signal would be a Thief of Hope, or to a lesser extent Waxmane Baku.  P1p10 - Yeah, not much here. Crazy that there's 2 Mystic Snakes floating around though.  P1p11 - I don't like Gut Shot. You could take the Trainee here. Maybe do WR affinity / equips, which actually sounds fairly sweet.  P1p12 - Slaughtermaster is a great pickup for this new plan.  P1p13 - I might take Smash here though there doesn't seem to be many Affinity players if any. So Flamekin is probably fine. Smash is a great sideboard card though, and could even ruin some Skyreach Manta dreams at some point.  P1p14 - Ok.  P1p15 - Wrap in Flames - I think this is quite a solid card, and it will fit nicely as one of the last cards in this RW deck we moved into.  P2p1 - Wolfbriar is a sick card. But with how dry green was last pack I think I'll avoid it and just be happy taking Arrest.  I'll stop here since the cards coming back may depend on us having taken different things pack 1. But I would say you have some work to do in terms of card evaluation. Go check out LSV's reviews of each color. In particular take a look at Thrive and Runed Servitor which you picked very highly."

lrcast,391gw6,ArsIgnis,4,Mon Jun 8 22:10:29 2015 UTC,"My thoughts:  White: The 4/6 vigilance, tap a creature in the ""beginning of combat"" at each opponents turn seems ridiculous. It does cost 6 mana, but it taps a creature, blocks whatever other large creature the opponent might have. And attacks with not too many worries. How do you lose with this on the board?  Blue: We see a cantrip fog(-2/-0 to attacking creatures) and two prowess creatures, I suppose we are to expect more of that. Cantrips to make use of prowess.  Black: It has the usual ""creature dies"", ""discard cards"" and ""lose life"" mechanics. Also, I have a hard time evaluating Malakir Cullblade and Eyeblight Assasin.  Red: No spoilers for prowess creatures? Prowess was supposed to be a U/R mechanic, but maybe, we just have to wait for more spoilers. Costly, but playable removal in the Lightning Javelin. Is there a time where removal is unplayable? The subterranean scout does not seem that.. playable in limited. It can make your Jhessian thief unblockable, so, maybe there is some synergy.  Green: Hitchclaw recluse is a green reprint of updraft elemental, except it has reach instead of flying. Blue appreciates blockers more than green, and this cannot ping for 1. The Joraga Invocation seems.. interesting. I can imagine situations where you are dead next turn to your opponents fliers, but you force him/her to chump block whith the flier, and thus you survive. 6 mana is a lot, it does not have evasion, but maybe we don't care because after blocking our creatures, nothing can actually kill us next turn? The conclave naturalists seems interesting, if there are a lot of artifacts and enchantments around, it is probably quite good. I would guess."
lrcast,391gw6,kccmtg,2,Mon Jun 8 16:02:24 2015 UTC,"More interesting are some of the reprints that are in the set.  For example, [[Claustrophobia]] is going to be around as good removal.

lrcast,391gw6,ElspethSC,2,Mon Jun 8 21:51:53 2015 UTC,"Fiery Conclusion is really contextual. It should be on the right side of playable in most formats, but not spectacular. The important thing to realise is that not all cards are created equal. You're probably sacrificing an early creature that you already got value from (by attacking with it) and which is now ""bricked"" on the board, to take out your opponent's best creature. Sometimes this will be a neutral virtual card advantage play; if your opponent has one big blocker holding off two small attackers, sacrificing one to kill the blocker costs 2 cards to deal with one of theirs, but it also nets you a virtual card in the form of a creature that is once again relevant.  Obviously, if there are ways to sacrifice a creature without spending a full card, then Fiery Conclusion goes up in value. That could mean tokens, or creatures that come back from the graveyard, or creatures that replace themselves anyway, such as Palace Familiar.  So the card could be a D in some formats or a B in other formats. It depends on how many ways there are to abuse it. It also depends on how it matches up against other creatures in the format (If a lot of the curve-topping common and uncommon creatures you want to kill have six toughness, it goes way down) and on how tempo-oriented the format is. Fiery Conclusion gets better for the same reasons Unsummon gets better: If throwing away cards to get attacks in is good in the format, it should be good. For example, sacrificing a small creature to kill a blocker then getting in with a 2/3 Jhessian Thief is card advantage neutral and gains board advantage; if there are a lot of ways of ""pressing the advantage"" like that, cards like Unsummon and Fiery Conclusion get better."

lrcast,391gw6,ncs19,6,Mon Jun 8 16:03:50 2015 UTC,"MaRo's article has some stuff that we don't need to figure out, though.  The gist is that Intimidate and Landwalk are gone, Protection is now non-evergreen, the Goblin War Drums ability (can't be blocked except by more than one creature) is now keyworded as Menace and evergreen (talking up intimidate's role as primary black, secondary in red), and Prowess will now be evergreen (primary in Blue, secondary in red, tertiary in white). Oh, and Scry is evergreen now, too.  The most interesting of these to me is Menace. It's been around, of course, but we'll be seeing it more now. In Origins, he spoiled a 3/2 Menace common for 2R. Overall, it seems like it is generally worse than Flying. But it's also a bit more aggressive."
lrcast,391gw6,nottomf,6,Mon Jun 8 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"You would never in a million years get a 3/2 flier for 2C at common with no downside, so they're definitely pricing Menace much more aggressively than flying.  The premiere Menace guy was always the newly French vanilla Stormblood Berserker, and that card was very strong. So a 3/2 Menace creature for 2R is definitely a very real card, and I'd be surprised if it wasn't one of the top red common creatures."

As they should. Menace doesn't do anything defensively and ""having 2 creatures"" is an easier condition than ""having a flyer"" (e.g. a green/red deck could easily have no flyers)."
lrcast,391gw6,depot81,3,Mon Jun 8 19:16:58 2015 UTC,"Menace is definitely not as good as flying, so of course they're pricing it more aggressively because they can. But they don't have to, see how rummaging still hasn't been priced aggressively enough to make it particularly good.  To be fair, usually all colours have access to answers to fliers (Red gets removal which usually matches up well against creatures that are small for their CMC, which fliers at low rarities are, and Green gets Reach and Plummet effects)"
lrcast,391gw6,czarandy,2,Mon Jun 8 19:30:24 2015 UTC,"Well, it means /something/, and it is also interesting to evaluate cards. Simply, fun. Might be ""smarter"" to wait until everything is spoiled, but I like speculating, and other unethical endeavors."

I was just pointing out that all we have is individual cards, and that there just isn't enough to piece together the big picture stuff yet. It's worth looking at the cards and seeing what kind of clues we are getting about big picture stuff, but we need another round of previews before we can start piecing together the puzzle.  As for talking about individual cards, yeah, that totally makes sense at this point."

lrcast,393lgx,MooiTie,2,Tue Jun 9 00:37:39 2015 UTC,"i dislike the low creature count when you have so many cards that rely on creatures, including 3x kindled fury, 2x tail slash, kolaghan forerunners, and artful maneouver.  you say ""RNG hosed"" but i bet some of those games you lost because kindled fury was dead or forerunners was a 1/3.   I would never cut the first evolving wilds, especially when you're playing a double red card"
lrcast,393lgx,pahamack,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:40:39 2015 UTC,"I dislike the low creature count too.  But I realized I was low by the end of pack one and did what I could to adjust.  I could have played one or both of the sub-par 6 drop Ogre dudes, but I felt like this build was a more reliable option.  What would you do differently if this was the pool you ended up with? Saying you don't like what I did doesn't really help me improve...  I actually didn't have any problems with creatures, I lost both games because I got mana-screwed.  I realized kindled fury might be dead often, but it seemed like my best shot at getting 1 for 1's in combat especially given I had 3 4/1's for 3 mana.  So you're saying all you need to overlook the drawback of having one comes in to play tapped land in a deck that's trying to curve out is one double colored casting cost? You might be right, but it seems that the one turn delay might hurt more than the fixing helps..."
lrcast,393lgx,pahamack,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:09:27 2015 UTC,"Yes. In your opening hand the evolving wilds is ideal, in a mana heavy hand it doesn't matter. So really you're just getting punished if it's not in your opener AND you draw it AND you need the untapped land and have no other cheaper play. I'd rather have better consistency with colours than being worried about that edge case. I don't know about a second tapped land, maybe if my curve was extremely tight i'd cut it, but the first cipt land? get in there.  I can't say anything about the draft as I'd have to see if any mistakes were in the draft itself. As it is, I'd probably play an ogre over one of the kindled furies. Im not a fan of that card anyway.  You have literally 0 good white cards in this deck. Everything is filler. Your second colour should probably have been something else."
lrcast,393lgx,gild_for_kitten_pics,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:42:35 2015 UTC,"I agree about the white creatures, I think the spells are ok though.  Sure maybe filler but not things to avoid. The first enduring victory is definitely in. Probly the second.  Does this look better?  OUT: Light walker, Krushok, Enduring Victory, Artful Maneuver IN: Defeat, Defiant Ogre, Dutiful Attendant, Marsh Hulk, Evolving Wilds (and went to 6 swamps 10 mountians???)  http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/rbdraft-copy/  Seems like Defeat is an upgrade from lightwalker. Ogre is a side grade to Krushok, Dutiful attendant helps with low creature count a bit, still sidegrade-ish from Enduring Victory. Marsh Hulk is likely better than the combat trick it replaces in this context."
lrcast,393lgx,pahamack,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:00:29 2015 UTC,I really think just running another Swamp here is better than the Evolving wilds.  Given my black is only a 3 card splash.
lrcast,393lgx,gild_for_kitten_pics,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:10:54 2015 UTC,I don't think this deck is very good. It's trying to be aggressive but doesn't have enough 2 drops to get there.
lrcast,393lgx,sylverfyre,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:50:22 2015 UTC,"I've recently tried to move away from two drops, as they just seem to get outclassed to quickly.  It's much safer to draft with a midrange 3 and 4 focused deck in mind because if I try to go super agro and don't get a critical mass of two drops and removal and the tricks and reach cards I need then I end up having 'wasted' a bunch of picks on two drops that my deck doesn't actually end up wanting.   I have been playing alot of sealed and not drafting recently though, so my curve calibration might be off..."
lrcast,393lgx,5-s,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:12:38 2015 UTC,"Yes. This is an aggressive format. You want 2s, particularly ones that can attack through 1/1s.   2s aren't just for aggressive decks. Controlling decks also need them for defensive speed."

lrcast,393zzf,kccmtg,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:36:01 2015 UTC,"Congrats!   On your sealed, I think I would have cut the white splash from your deck, running Dragon Fodder in place of Harsh Sustenance, or added more plains and ran Sandcrafter Mage and Sandsteppe Outcast, replacing Diplomacy of the Wastes and Fierce Invocation. Always have 2 sources at a bare minimum for a splash - 3 is usually better.  Your draft deck looked very good, but again I think the splash is ambitious, especially since you're looking fairly aggressive. Again, 1 source isn't enough to run - 1 Swamp plus the Evolving Wilds would have been better. I think I would have removed the Flatten and ran Rageform instead, maybe removing Collected Company for Tormenting Voice."
lrcast,393zzf,Sony_Black,2,Tue Jun 9 15:28:47 2015 UTC,"thanks for the congratulations!  I feel pretty good about how I did.  though it's funny, in the sealed portion I tended to side out the white splash in game 2/3.  I never drew both splash lands/spells at the same time all day.  I think I saw the dual lands and got greedy.  oh well.  thanks for your feedback; very reasoned and constructive."
lrcast,393zzf,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:55:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the [[collected company]] in the draft deck... I don't think it is a good limited card and it might be even worse in this deck, because you have only 14 creatures all together and only 7 of them can be hit by CC (and of those you might not want to hit the survivalist, because you would rather morph him...)  I think the [[rageform]] would be a nice substitute for it - it is OK filler even if it doesn't hit a creature to un-manifest and it can hit some insanely hard hitting guys in your deck.  Another questionable card is [[atarka's command]]. Yes it is great in constructed, but mainly in burn decks, where 3 ot the face can almost be worth a card on its own. In limited I would play it in either an extremely agressive deck to make the damage worth it or a deck which goes wide, where you actively want the mass pump.  I think I would add the [[atarka monument]] to the deck instead of the command. It is mana fixing and  is another thread in the later game.  EDIT: I completely forgot: congratulations for the top 8 result :)"

lrcast,390ylz,AlphaRhobot,4,Mon Jun 8 13:24:09 2015 UTC,6 packs off conspiracy or MM2. The power level is much higher than the standard sets
lrcast,390ylz,KamiOfOldStone,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:38:10 2015 UTC,"I think conspiracy is a poor choice as there are so many cards that depend on the draft information.   Modern Masters will likely be the strongest, but presumably will either be not allowed or will mean you are paying a significantly higher entry.  Khans would have pretty good mana, and gatecrash you could gamble on getting a super aggro pool...  Money not withstanding, I would go MM by far... there is just so much power in that set."
lrcast,390ylz,carpeamentum,3,Mon Jun 8 14:22:40 2015 UTC,"If they let you use the Conspiracies then Conspiracy is completely beyond your other choices in terms of power, and you should just grab six packs of that."
lrcast,390ylz,ImATomatoClone,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:17:29 2015 UTC,"The commons and uncommons are much stronger in Conspiracy and MM2. However with Conspiracy you run the risk of (a) not being allowed to use Conspiracy cards, (b) having a lot of cards that are designed for multiplayers, or (c) having a lot of cards which are only good based on the draft happening, making them useless in sealed.  If you're allowed 6 packs of MM2 I'd go with that. Alternatively, 6 packs of Gatecrash could lead to a very strong Boros, Orzhov or Gruul deck.  If you have to mix and match, then mixing Khans block with Modern Masters and RTR block will mean you probably get very good mana for a 5-colour deck of some kind."
lrcast,390ylz,h0m3r,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:03:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure they'd let you just pick MM2 for a sealed event, the packs cost like double everything else. If they do awesome, grab those and never look back. If they don't then what else you do should kind be up to the kind of deck you want. If you like slow decks theme khans would be the the way to go for fixing, mixed with conspiracy. If you wanna go faster dragons and born of the gods would be good.  Oh and if for whatever reason ravnica is still around, gatecrash is kinda bonkers. Very fast with brutal removal."
lrcast,390ylz,TheJediCounsel,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:28:50 2015 UTC,"Ugh. Grab bag sealed, limited to packs from the last 3 years? Sounds horrible.  If you wanted to metagame it and go for wins the best way to do it without picking mm2015 (for cost reasons) is pick a small set and go with six of those. You can be assured of some commons showing up because they are small sets. FRF might be more powerful than born/journey, due to not just it's powerful rares, but commons too. If you can get multiple heelcutters your deck will be unstoppable.  Dragon's maze is terrible because it's a small gold set. The cards are going to be distributed in all sorts of colours. You don't want that.  this is completely not in keeping with the spirit of grab bag though."

lrcast,38yml3,Greyfeld,3,Sun Jun 7 23:18:39 2015 UTC,"Initial comment is that it would be preferable for you to keep your sealed pool in one image to make it easier to analyze.  This is a rough pool though, and not one I would expect to make any kind of big run in a lengthy event regardless of build. I think your choice to play, effectively, straight three colors was a mistake; a card like Kolaghan Aspirant is not only a very weak card off-curve, it's not a card you're very happy to play in most sealed decks in general.  Looking at your GW build, it's still not great. Playing a bunch of low drops backed by pump is a strategy that is drastically worse in sealed than draft due to the higher quantity of removal you'll face.  I think UB is the direction you want to go; it's where your best cards and your removal lies. I think UB splashing red for Twin Bolt and Seismic Rupture looks passable. The reason I want to splash for Seismic Rupture is that the resulting deck looks pretty slow and having a Pyroclasm effect is usually good for a control deck. I don't see a much better build."
lrcast,38yml3,Sceptilesolar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:14:13 2015 UTC,"BUr is what I did, though.  It sounds like the only complaint you have is that I ran the aspirants, but unless you can suggest a couple cards that would have been better instead (considering the lack of 2-drops in UB that I had available), I'm afraid I don't really understand what issue you have with my deck decision.  As it stands, I had very few problems with getting color screwed, which sounds like is your biggest concern with my choice.  Edit: Added the ""secondary deck"" cards to the sideboard in the first link, just for the sake of easy perusal.  I left up the link to the second deck, though."
lrcast,38yml3,h0m3r,3,Mon Jun 8 03:33:49 2015 UTC,"Not the previous poster but the issue is twofold:  First, 2-drops are in general weaker in Sealed than in draft. (Though I understand your desire to be protected against an aggressive start)  Second, you can't really splash for your early plays. A splash means you won't reliably have the correct mana ""on curve"" because there are far fewer sources in your deck. You should only splash for cards that are impactful at any stage in the game, such as removal or bombs."
lrcast,38yml3,mrcjtm,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:39:31 2015 UTC,"2-drops are important so you have early plays, but if you are unlikely to hit that color of mana early, then it doesn't serve that purpose. Perhaps you drew well and were able to play your red creatures on curve, but that is really results-oriented thinking. I don't play a 2-drop unless I have at the very least 7 sources of that color of mana -- preferably 8+. Also, you're playing 5 red cards -- that's more than you want for a splash. I would have cut the 3 red creatures, the 2 cunning strikes, and one mountain and replaced them with an island, a swamp (this deck needs 18 lands), the anticipate, the ojutai's summons, seismic rupture, and probably the custodian of the trove. It's also possible that Sibsig Icebreakers should be played, maybe in place of Ojutai's Breath, which isn't doing much in this deck.  Just my thoughts!"

lrcast,38yml3,foglet_download,2,Mon Jun 8 22:12:27 2015 UTC,"cut red altogether.  the red you're splashing for is very weak, to the point that I wouldn't have any interest in splashing for any of those cards.  I'm fine with playing blue black.  I think if you cut those 6 cards, you can add: Vanguard Custodian Dragon Idol Anticipate Summons (one of your best cards) Tombshell  Or play 18 lands.  you also have some strong white, and an aggressive white x build is available.  Also, if you feel like your deck is too weak at two colours.  the better more powerful splash is white. You can play the Dragon, Elite Scaleguard, Sandsteppe Outcast and you get access to a dual.  You should 100% have summons in that deck,"
lrcast,38xrob,mjc5077,2,Sun Jun 7 19:18:06 2015 UTC,Looks like good decks overall. One comment I have is that I think you overrate Glassdust Hulk; I think it's too slow and clunky for good affinity decks.
lrcast,38xrob,Sceptilesolar,2,Sun Jun 7 20:41:39 2015 UTC,I might overrate it but I love that it cycles and sometimes when you get to untap and play an artifact they are right about the lethal mark anyway. I've found him better than the affinity flyer as a finisher in that deck. Also wears cranial plating well.
lrcast,38xrob,chord_O_Calls,3,Sun Jun 7 21:30:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with mjc, I think the hulk is quite good. I don't think the affinity deck has to be the super aggressive 4 court homunculus style deck that LSV and Marshall were talking about. I have had great success in a more evasive/tempo type affinity deck and the hulk is a great part of this deck. When he basically becomes a 4 power unblockable every turn if your artifact count is high its quite the clock and ends games nearly right away with a plating.  He's a good finisher and like you said is never dead if you need action as he cycles.  overall your decks look really solid and I think the last one could have been salvaged if you just had a high amount of artifacts (which you did) and cut everything but green and black. Obviously wouldnt be super synergistic but I feel like the blue and white spells really clog up the mana base especuially when you had so few of them"

My gut reaction is ""toss it back,"" but there are mana-fixing spells to consider, and we don't know how many land he had in his deck.  Not to mention, we don't know what sort of deck the opponent has (if this is match 1, I can understand trying to mull into more land.  If it's match 3, there should be a better idea of what sort of opener the OP can expect)."
lrcast,38y5ky,Greyfeld,3,Sun Jun 7 22:16:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, mull this every time. The 1 land hands you keep in limited are very few and far between, and would want some combination of:   Something you can play for 1 mana. Good plays for several turns if you can hit just one more land. Ways to dig or filter cards (e.g. Theros scry lands, some 1-drop that lets you scry).   If you never keep a 1 lander at 6 or 7 cards you probably aren't ever making a large mistake, where any 1 lander you keep could easily be a large mistake."
lrcast,38y5ky,cferejohn,2,Mon Jun 8 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"I really don't see how you keep a one-lander on the play. Assuming you were playing 17 lands, roughly 48% of your library is going to be lands. I don't like giving yourself worse-than-half odds of actually getting to play anything on turn two. Your odds of getting a better six-hander are definitely better, though in your case the numbers didn't work out. Same with the five. Just because you got a bad run of mulligans doesn't mean the initial mulligan wasn't the right choice. You can't control the shuffler."
lrcast,38y5ky,shinianx,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:31:44 2015 UTC,"If I have 3 two drops or more and I have already mulled to 6, then I will keep a one lander. The reasoning is that I am already fairly unlikely to win on a mull to 5, but with a coin flip I can have a much better chance. You could work out the odds for any given set once stats are available to see the general odds of winning on the play with a mull to 5."
lrcast,38y5ky,priceQQ,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:55:38 2015 UTC,"Your mulligan decision is influenced by two things: what's in your hand and what's in your deck.  One thing to note is that you were playing a 3-colour deck, so the decision on what to mulligan depends very much on your manabase and colour balance.  Certainly if you need Green or Black to turn your deck on, that Plains could never have been a keep."

lrcast,38tegx,NJCuban,2,Sat Jun 6 17:35:55 2015 UTC,"I think the lesson here is in aggro you want your 1 drops and double color requirement cards to be in your primary color with your secondary color having cards that come out a little later. I think the Vampire Outcast is powerful enough to still include a copy in a base red deck, but I wouldn't want to strain the mana by running multiple Fireslingers and Lacerators. I also think the on color Karoos and Evolving Wilds should be played, but you should let them take the place of your secondary color's sources rather than your primary. So your mana base might look like 9 Mountains, Evolving Wilds, Rakdos Carnarium, 5 Swamps - assuming a low enough curve to warrant only 16 lands.  I could be wrong here. Maybe you always just jam all of your 1 drops across both colors when you need to activate bloodthirst. But I agree an 8/8 split could lead to miserable draws at times. What do others think?"
lrcast,38rwil,Chemical_Bromance,2,Sat Jun 6 07:43:31 2015 UTC,"I've only played a few drafts since then, but I think it has. The decks they didn't mention in the top 5(7?) seem a bit more open, and I think more people drafting 5-color is causing some strange signals at the tables."

Much of his casual commentary and some of his writing is nothing more than expounding upon his relationships with Jon Finkel and other longtime players. This serves little purpose other than to impress upon the audience just how important Flores is. Many Magic commentators are criticized for engaging in hyperbole. Flores is the worst of the lot. It is his style to make bold claims about everything, and then contend that the predictions that don't pan out were obvious exaggerations while the ones that did were further confirmation of his impressive mind for Magic. Non-Magic issues. I don't know a whole lot about this area, but what comes up most often is his advocacy for ""pick-up artistry"" and other life coaching that is either offensive or psychobabble."

If you see enough targets for return to the earth, bring it in.  You have three ways I would say to close out the game. The two dragons and the elite scaleguard. Misthoof kirin also counts, though, but not as impactful. When playing against someone with lots of slow creatures, just like you, where the board stalls, I would side in the scion of Ugin and side out either the feral krushok or the dromoka warrior. Probably depending on whether you are on the play or draw."
lrcast,38s192,the_oker_in_proker,3,Sat Jun 6 12:17:49 2015 UTC,I agree in general -- though I think Destructor Dragon is strictly better than Scion

There's no synergy with the Soul Summons, deck is base green, and Shield Bearer is more versatile. Even has added value with the Sabretoothes and the War Shaman.

This deck is incredibly powerful because you have so many of the top end cards for this archetype. 4 bombs and a great curve, and your removal is not bad. Since you're gameplan is mostly just play out threats until opponent dies, I'd probably lower my curve.

lrcast,38qrl3,Stranjak,8,Sat Jun 6 00:52:39 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible it's a pull-over from games like League of Legends.

What'd I'd take away is that MTGO doesn't have a very clear etiquette for conversation, so try not to take offense at slight comments.

lrcast,38qrl3,rubberducky22,2,Sat Jun 6 03:33:07 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, 'gg' is the online gaming equivalent of a handshake.  I say it, win or lose.  It's a polite gesture, and construing it as anything else is just going out of your way to convince yourself that your opponents are terrible people.  It can be rude if you're saying 'gg' when you're winning but before the game is actually over because that's basically like telling your opponent 'you should just give up'"
lrcast,38qrl3,StP_Scar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:19:28 2015 UTC,That's fair. But I think the context we're talking about is before the game is actually over. I find people on MTGO almost never chat after the game is actually over.

It's just whatever; it feels bad to be on the losing side, but it also feels great to be on the winning side, and there's not any more reason for the winner to try to reduce the loser's bad feelings than there is for the loser to try to increase the winner's good feeling, so there's no reason to get upset by it.

That being said, I think in terms of etiquette context is important.  If you played to 3 ""real"" games where you barely squeaked out a win, ""ggs"" plus some relevant comment is fine.  Like ""wow ggs man...got really lucky I peeled that lightning bolt"" or something is fine IF the games really were ""good games"".  In general if you win though...especially if the games weren't good (you smashed opponent who got stuck on 2 mana) don't say they were.

lrcast,38qrl3,pahamack,2,Sun Jun 7 06:22:33 2015 UTC,"In a lot if internet games, saying gg first is basically saying ""I win, you lose, please concede"" and is considered poor form.

lrcast,38ol7s,transcensionist,9,Fri Jun 5 15:52:28 2015 UTC,"I'm more worried about a $250 prize for what I assume is a regular REL tournament...

lrcast,38ol7s,bearrosaurus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:13:18 2015 UTC,What are your primary concerns with regular REL? My biggest one is the possibility of outside cards being added. Especially in a draft with 3 of the same set it's difficult to determine what could feasibly have been passed. Is that what you're getting at - not registering card pools / decks?
lrcast,38ol7s,bearrosaurus,4,Fri Jun 5 18:45:59 2015 UTC,"If you want specific things, there's continuous deck construction and remembering triggers late (oh whoops, my scavenger drake is supposed to be a 8/8, do you want to take back the Dismember you just showed me?). At a philosophical level, the judges at Regular are supposed to make sure every one has a good time. At Competitive, they make sure everyone abides by rigid standards so the game is fair.  There's a ton of angle-shooting you can get away with at Regular because no one is going to act like asshole to get a measly booster pack. To win a box of MM2 though... someone is going to be tempted to pre-sideboard."
lrcast,38ol7s,kappolo,3,Fri Jun 5 19:03:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's exactly what I was looking for. I wasn't aware continuous deck construction was allowed in lower levels of play, or missing triggers like that."

lrcast,38ol7s,Locke_Daemonfire,4,Fri Jun 5 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"The prizes seem a little steep, but apart from that it sounds fine. My LGS does stuff like this all the time for all their FNMs. Suppose it is late in a draft season, and you get 14 people who show up. Would you rather do two 7-person, three round drafts where one person gets the bye each round? Or one 14-person, four round event with no byes? In my experience, the latter works out much better."
lrcast,38ol7s,5-s,6,Fri Jun 5 16:30:27 2015 UTC,"Our LGS does an 8 and a 6 if there are 14 people, and play only in pod.  I prefer that personally, though it's also because we start late and often have some slow matches, so wouldn't be able to fit in 4 rounds if we wanted to."
lrcast,38ol7s,stellarwarlord,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:52:04 2015 UTC,Yea that's way more normal. Out of pod is inherently unfair.
lrcast,38ol7s,czarandy,2,Sat Jun 6 04:17:05 2015 UTC,"My LGS does every FNM this way.   For example, if 40 players show for FNM they will be splint into 5 draft pods of 8 players each.  If an odd number of players show, they will be one draft pod with maybe 6-9 players or maybe two pods of 7 players.  In any case, after drafting all players are put into a single combined Swiss pool (meaning you will likely end up playing drafters from other pods).  Prizes are typically pack/win but i imagine the format would be the same for a larger prize such as a box.  To my knowledge, there has never been an issue at my LGS when using this method so I am wondering what that concern is about.  Why would it be better to draft and play in the same 8-person pod?  What am I missing?"
lrcast,38ol7s,stellarwarlord,7,Fri Jun 5 19:51:00 2015 UTC,"It just increases variance and diminishes the impact of skill, for a few reasons: - Some pods will open better/worse packs in aggregate. - Some pods will have stronger/weaker drafters. - Remembering which cards have been passed is irrelevant."
lrcast,38ol7s,carpeamentum,4,Fri Jun 5 19:56:18 2015 UTC,"You're playing against cards / decks / players that were not in your pool. You had no influence on them, and as someone else stated the dynamics of draft pods can be quite different. You might be in a pod with people that don't know how to build a deck so they just take random things and you're withheld the opportunity of building a synergistic deck. Or you get a pod of competitive players that all end up with decent decks, while another competitive player is in a pod of noobs and gets a bonkers deck that you now have to face.   I used to work at a shop that would have a ""Judge"" come in to run drafts and he shared your lack of concern with this. Quite absurd."
lrcast,38ol7s,Atmosck,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:07:21 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks for the explanation. That makes sense to me.  It seems I've underestimated the value of having influence over the decks you get matched against.  I just figured that everyone was on equal enough footing considering every deck is drafted anyway.  Even the Chaos drafts I've done at GPs have been run like this (though i must admit I was disappointed when I ended up in the 7-man draft pod since I felt I was getting to see less variance in the cards).  I've drafted at roughly 6 stores across the US since Scars and all but one store I've drafted at has run things this same way (combined Swiss after drafting) so I thought it was the norm.  Having experienced an 8-man draft/play pod only once (outside of MTGO) I didn't consider/pick up on the nuances you mentioned.    It sounds like I should be looking for a different store for my FNM draft.  Luckily, I live in the Bay Area and there are lots of stores to choose from. :)"

Sealed decks are even worse than out of pod drafts, you really have no say in what you open.  Yes, there's more variance and it's definitely not as good of an experience as an 8-man, but it's still drafting, still fun, and still competitive."

lrcast,38ol7s,sylverfyre,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:46:15 2015 UTC,"We kind of ended up doing something like this at the MM2 release event at my LGS. We had 14 players wanting to draft, and initially the shop owner was going to do a table of 8 and a table of 6, then have everyone play in Swiss pairings, but we convinced him to go 7-7 to try and even up the card availability. It wasn't ideal, but it wasn't awful. I think it might have been best if we'd just had straight up sixteen players and could have done 3 rounds within the pods, and then maybe have the winners face off for first place? I'm not even sure how something like that is supposed to work."
lrcast,38ol7s,JordanMiller406,3,Fri Jun 5 17:50:42 2015 UTC,"eh, I would rather play a pod of 8 and a pod of 6.  Drafting with 6 is just fine.  It's even done at professional REL in the form of team drafting in the top teams of a Team Limited GP.  Obviously that's team limited, but at FNM we draft with pods looking like 8-6 or 8-10 or whatever.  It's fine, just because MTGO demands 8 person pods doesn't mean that 6 person pods don't work.  4-person pods is where it breaks down and really changes how you draft.  Drafting with 7 is pretty awkward - you either have to play out of pods, or someone's getting a bye every round."
lrcast,38ol7s,pahamack,2,Fri Jun 5 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not sure I explained well enough, the plan was for the different tables to draft separately, and then have all fourteen players play in a combined Swiss. So yes, everyone was going to be playing out of pod at some point. That's why we tried to get him to even up the players, because otherwise one table was going to see six more packs than the other table, and be at a comparative advantage."
lrcast,38oe2g,hubay,7,Fri Jun 5 15:06:12 2015 UTC,"PV has a good point in his Vegas report (and it reflected my experiences too). Even if your deck isn't the best, if you draw well that matters a ton. A 5/10 drawing well plays like a 7 or 8/10. The better decks draw well more often, because they have more good cards or a better plan or whatever, but not getting bombs really isn't the end of the world."
lrcast,38oe2g,LSV__,2,Fri Jun 5 16:59:57 2015 UTC,"Is this an MMA2 thing, a general limited thing, or a general limited thing that's exacerbated in MMA2?"

lrcast,38oe2g,beepbloopbloop,5,Sat Jun 6 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who scrubbed out of the GP day 1, there is a huge amount of skill in sealed, especially this format. There are a lot of complex interactions and you are definitely rewarded for tight play. I know full well the ways I could have played better had I practiced more sealed.   Also the bombs in this format didn't feel as unfair as they usually do (especially compared to MM1). I'd say Bitterblossom, Karn, and Elesh Norn were the truly game-breaking ones, and the rest were beatable because of a huge amount of removal. Actually, I did win games against Karn and Bitterblossom in sealed, so yeah... bombs don't win on their own.   Anyways, the attitude of 'can't win because no bombs', even if it is true, does zero help for you."
lrcast,38oe2g,bearrosaurus,2,Fri Jun 5 16:49:15 2015 UTC,"YES.  Sealed pool determines the potential ceiling of your success if you are already a strong player.  If you receive a strong pool but you're a weak player, it is possible to miss day two due to blunders.  But if you receive a weak pool as a strong player, you're not making Day 2 with average draws, sorry."
lrcast,38oe2g,mlundberg27,3,Fri Jun 5 18:20:50 2015 UTC,"There's a factor of ""how well you draw in matches"" which is hard to quantify. For eg, if you have this bomb, but never ever draw it, it is like it is not in your pool."
lrcast,38oe2g,gloopiee,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:23:54 2015 UTC,"you're asking if there's a correlation between great cards and making day two... of course there is. Especially in a set with so much fixing that you can basically play all your bombs.  Heck, I don't even understand the question. Are you asking if chances of doing better increase when you open bombs? Because it seems to me the answer is obvious. There's a reason you want to open them after all.  Doesn't mean you can't do well with a crappy pool though. See: PVs tournament report, and, probably still my favorite GP performance, when Rietzl won a gp with a really bad pool by playing lots of [bump in the night]"

lrcast,38nwtz,MrRKipling,4,Fri Jun 5 13:00:57 2015 UTC,I think it comes down to MM15 affinity being an aggro deck that the Mechanist is often a bit slow for. In MM13 affinity was more about value artifacts with the Mechanist and that artifact Gravedigger. Here things sped up a lot; Court Homunculus went from bad filler to a cornerstone of the deck.
lrcast,38nwtz,Sceptilesolar,2,Fri Jun 5 13:11:58 2015 UTC,I drafted a bad version of this deck the other night. In part it was because I passed a Myr Enforcer for a Faerie Mechanist. The Enforcer would have been much better in my deck and I regret that pick.
lrcast,38nwtz,nerd2thecore,2,Fri Jun 5 14:25:23 2015 UTC,"The homunculous is very important...best decks I have drafted had 4+ homunculus, 2-3 glint  hawks, 2-3 mechanists, 2-3 Darksteel citadels, and 1 cranial platting, and as many sunlance, arrests, and oblivion rings as I could get. As I noted below,the feel bad with the mechanist is when you have to put any number of your removal spells on the bottom of the deck because they aren't artifacts. That alone might be enough to not run the mechanist I suppose, but I have found the 2 power flier+drawing a card to be well worth the 4 mana. Also, I love vapor snag in this deck."
lrcast,38nwtz,SirChuffly,3,Fri Jun 5 15:17:15 2015 UTC,"I do like the mechanist in this deck. A 2 power flier is really nothing to be sniffed at for 4 mana, when it has 'enter the battlefield, draw a relevant card'.  I think the reason it's not mentioned as a key card for the deck is the chance of a whiff (hopefully not too high if you're deep on affinity!) and that it's slightly inefficient on mana. I think it's great filler, but nothing more."
lrcast,38nwtz,LSV__,2,Fri Jun 5 13:15:44 2015 UTC,"This isn't the grindy Affinity deck from MM1, where Mechanist + Sanctum Gargoyle was the core. This is a near-monowhite beatdown deck that wants very few lands, and as such I don't think Mechanist is key, at least not in the builds I have had success with."
lrcast,38nwtz,darrenoc,2,Fri Jun 5 17:01:02 2015 UTC,I don't agree that that's the only good build of the deck. I've had good success with Affinity decks that win by outcarding the opponent with thoughtcast and mechanist and flooding the board. The all-in aggro build is certainly faster but less resilient.
lrcast,38nwtz,transcensionist,2,Sat Jun 6 01:04:09 2015 UTC,"More questions RE: Affinity.   LSV advocated going down to 14-15 lands, citing in part how Darksteel Citadel effectively produces 2 mana. How are you reliably casting turn 4 Rusted Relics, and while it's true that Citadel reduces the casting cost by 2 for Affinity cards, they're typically over costed in the first place. I know with enough cheap artifacts you can power out your Myr Enforcers with only 2-3 lands, but going down to 14 lands just seems too aggressive. You also have to consider that if you have 2-3 Citadels, a couple Court Homonculus, and a Blue splash, you're spreading your mana very thin at only 14 lands. Let's say 8 Plains, 2 Citadels, and.. only 4 Islands? Maybe the 14 land Affinity deck is running some number of Sphere of the Suns or Wayfarer's Baubles, or it could be Mono White? They talked about Sunlance being the optimal removal spell in Affinity, which I agree with. Do Arrest and Narcolepsy still fit or are they deemed too slow and you'd rather just power out more threats faster? Do you stlil try to run multiple Thoughtcasts or is it too slow for the explosive deck you want to have? I can't recall if they talked about it in the cast.   Just trying to get my head around the optimal configuration here."
lrcast,38nwtz,Sceptilesolar,2,Fri Jun 5 14:03:16 2015 UTC,"I haven't been playing thought cast much. Arrest will always be good since it deals with any creature, particularly one with 4+ toughness."

lrcast,38mfmc,turn0,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:50:16 2015 UTC,"I actually think this pool is well set up to play RG Domain.  You have Wayfarer's Bauble and Evolving Wilds as colorless fixing, as well as three landcyclers, a rampant growth, and a Noble Hierarch.  That's seven ways to fix your mana, and more that the average sealed pool, I've found.  Your bounceland is also green, which is a huge bonus.  That in mind, I think I would sleeve up something like this:  13 Creatures: 1 Noble Hierarch 1 Nest Invader 1 Gnarlid Pack 1 Dimir Guildmage 1 Lorescale Coatl 1 Sickleslicer 1 Blood Ogre 1 Alloy Myr 1 Kavu Primarch 1 Indomitable Archangel  1 Horde of Notions 1 Skyreach Manta 1 Spitebellows  10 Spells: 1 Wayfarer's Bauble 1 Burst Lightning 1 Rampant Growth 2 Sylvan Bounty 2 Nameless Inversion 1 Electrolyze  1 Agony Warp 1 All Sun's Dawn  17 Land: 1 Golgari Rot Farm 1 Evolving Wilds 7 Forest 3 Mountain 1 Island 3 Plains 1 Swamp  This build gives you access to basically all the removal in your pool, two of your bombs in Noble Hierarch and Indomitable Archangel, and plenty or solid creatures all across the curve.  Like any 5cc deck, the manabase is stretched, but I think it is ok.  A few notes on specific choices: - I added Blood Ogre to the deck because it is a solid defensive body in the early game regardless of whether it got bloodthirsty or not.  A 2/2 first striker is just a good body. - I did not include Fiery Fall in the final build.  This may be incorrect, but I really wanted to make sure that I could play all my fixing spells, and that was the only one in red.  Cutting it allowed me to go down to only three mountains to support Blood Ogre, Burst Lightning, and Electrolyze. - Horde of Notions is an incredibly difficult to cast magic card.  That said, I think the payoff in this deck is good enough.  It is a powerful recurring creature that can attack and block very well, the only problem is casting it.  Given that we want to get all 5 colors online as soon as possible, I think that the Horde will be castable in most games. This is certainly not the only way to build this deck, and it may not even be the optimal one.  I could certainly see cutting the Horde and the Archangel for the two Vampire Outcasts.  That makes your mana substantially better, and I think the Vampires are close enough in power level that it is ok.  At that point you could cut the two creatures and trade all your Plains for Swamps.  You could also leave in the Horde and one Plains and cut something like Kavu Primarch, which I think is very underwhelming in this deck. Anyways, that's what I think I would try. EDIT: I haven't played with All Sun's Dawn in this format, so it might be crazy to include it.  I think it's good enough, but if it is actually just a terrible magic card, Fiery Fall is what I would play over it."

lrcast,38jcx9,mtgratingtester,4,Fri Jun 5 05:08:56 2015 UTC,"I would expect that the reason you aren't always infinite is that you don't prioritize EV.  If a player cares more about winning (or having fun or practicing for a big tournament) than maximizing their return, going infinite is going to be significantly harder.  Taking 2-3 ticket money cards over reasonable playables makes a big difference.  I've been playing magic for about three years.  When I sit down to draft, my primary concern is usually maximizing EV.  I did this at first because I was a student and it meant that I got to play more magic.  Now I do it because I find it fun.  In the first year I played MtGO, I had to buy tickets a few times.  In the second year, I was slightly ahead.  In the third year, I was enough ahead to more than cover all of my first year losses.  I'm pretty decent at magic but there are tons of people better than me.  I would expect that most people could go infinite if they made it their focus."
lrcast,38jcx9,Airplace,8,Thu Jun 4 19:46:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is likely true. I tend not to raredraft, especially when recording videos, and I usually just draft whatever format I want regardless of what has the best equity at a given time."

lrcast,38jcx9,garrettj100,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:56:15 2015 UTC,Playing Sealed dailies or release queues helps quite a bit if you have a rating around 1800-1850.
lrcast,38jcx9,mlundberg27,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:13:50 2015 UTC,"Well maybe if you don't go infinite it might be a little out of my range as well. It feels like I almost can with the 6-2-2-2 Khans format, although the last two drafts I went 3-0, then 1-2 so its not a perfect formula.   Hope you feel better!"
lrcast,38jcx9,BonSequitur,6,Thu Jun 4 17:28:56 2015 UTC,"On MTGO, it's pretty much impossible to go infinite while drafting, though there is such a thing as trying to get as much gameplay as possible out of your money. Mostly the latter involves playing formats with good EV, playing the right prize structure for your skill level, and knowing when to rare draft. All of which are learnable but somewhat intricate skills.  Last I checked, the best EV in non-phantom Limited events is release sealed queues, when the set is new and there is a lot of demand for Constructed cards from it, but someone might correct me on that as it has been a while since I rode that particular money vortex.  Probably the most drafting you can do on the least money is phantom events, especially phantom draft/sealed such as the current MM2015 ones. The big thing with those is that as long as you have phantom points, you can keep rolling them forward, but if you run out of phantom points you have to put in tickets.  However, if you win more often than you go 1-2 or 0-3, given enough of a margin, you should go infinite on swiss phantom drafts:    Record Payout Net Change    3-0 24 +8   2-1 16 0   1-2 6 -10   0-3 2 -14    As you can see, if you 0-3 very rarely (Which you should, given that those are swiss events - even if you have an even overall chance of ending up on any given ranking, you have only a 1/8 chance of going 0-3, and it's very common in an 8-player event on MTGO for someone to drop and the lowest ranked player to get a round 3 bye. I don't remember the last time I 0-3ed a phantom draft; may never have happened, and I'm not that good) and 3-0 some 20% more often than you 1-2, you should go infinite.  But even if you have the win% to do it, the risk of ruin is real until you either become phenomenally good at the format or hit a real streak and accumulate so many phantom points that you can even out the variance - two things that might not happen at all. Maybe your 0-3 chance is 1%, your 1-2 chance is 10%, your 3-0 chance is 19%, and your 2-1 chance is 70%. Say you start at 0 phantom points and put in 10 tickets to go into a draft; you have an 11% risk of ruin, because you might lose that draft and end up without enough phantom points to roll into another draft, forcing you to put in more tickets. And even if you 2-1 or 3-0, your risk of ruin is still 11% because you could lose the next draft and end up with 6 or 12 phantom points (Or you might be cursed, like I am, to always have an odd number of phantom points because you got on that particular money vortex before Wizards changed the prize structure). So you could go infinite, but it would require variance going your way repeatedly and probably won't happen.  However, whenever you do put in your 10 tickets, the average number of drafts you get to play for that is higher than in other formats - easily three or four or more."
lrcast,38jcx9,BonSequitur,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:15:49 2015 UTC,The swiss way is the way I'm going right now. Hearing that not going infinite doesn't make me a bad player is encouraging. I guess when you win 8 or 6 packs you feel invinclible and then go 1-2 you just feel bad.   You make a good point on the phantom drafts. I guess I'll actually use my new player draft points.
lrcast,38jcx9,BonSequitur,2,Thu Jun 4 17:33:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely use your new player points, for the practice if nothing else.  Damn whippersnappers. In my day there were no new player points.

lrcast,38jcx9,shinianx,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:45:15 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much exactly what I've been doing with MM2015. I happened to have 16 phantom points sitting in my collection, and I've been running off of just those for over a week now. Two 3-0s, one 1-2, and the rest all 2-1s. I was fortunate that my 1-2 hit right after my two 3-0s, so I had the tickets to spare to jump into another one. It's a fantastic way to learn a format and to get a feel for how the drafts should go. I also have little attachment to the cards themselves, so having them disappear after every Swiss doesn't bother me at all."
lrcast,38jcx9,kalikaiz,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:51:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just unlucky, but I also got the feeling that the variance is very real when it comes to rare drafting in this format, so if I hadn't been drafting phantom it would just be a constant disappointment of ""C'mon, foil Goyf!"" and then opening the endless parade of worthless Necroskitters and Mystic Snakes."
lrcast,38jcx9,pahamack,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:22:02 2015 UTC,"I feel the same. There just aren't that many cards that I'd fall over to take. A Goyf would be awesome, but even then I'd only want it for the ticket value, since I really don't play Modern. So take a format that's fun to draft, but rather expensive, and holds only marginal appeal to me in terms of real card value, and it's not hard to understand why the Phantom queues are so attractive.     Beyond that though, this format is very punishing if you can't establish a solid deck identity. If you try to squeeze in different strategies, even within the same color, I find you wind up diluting your overall deck performance pretty badly. You might have different synergies or what have you, but when the best decks at the table are all cranking hard towards a really big Plan A, having a multitude of Plans yourself only means none of them are going to do that great against an average opposing draw. It almost feels like drafting Cube, and in that regard, stopping mid-pack to grab a rare for resale value over a solid playable might cost you more EV in the long run."
lrcast,38jcx9,kalikaiz,3,Fri Jun 5 15:18:33 2015 UTC,"I had been doing pretty well in frk/ktk draft for a while. The 6-2-2-2 has a good payout if you win, and if you pull a 4 ticket rare that covers like half the cost of the draft since the boosters for it are so cheap right now"
lrcast,38jcx9,pahamack,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:36:42 2015 UTC,"Thats where I'm at too. The payout is fantastic, khans is chock-full of value rares. I also think it might just be my favorite draft format as well!"
lrcast,38jcx9,kalikaiz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:40:48 2015 UTC,"What value? There's no card in that format that breaks the $10 barrier, whereas journey of the gods has three RARES that do so: temple of malady, eidolon of the great revel, and mana confluence.  Cheap boosters are also a negative because to go infinite you need to not be buying boosters, but selling cards/boosters and it's better for you if the prices are high.  If you're staying away from the current draft format due to value it's better to switch to the format with actual value: theros block."
lrcast,38jcx9,pahamack,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:26:17 2015 UTC,I've never played theros so I would have yo come up to speed. A week ago there were 10+ rares over 4 tickets in frf ktk

lrcast,38jcx9,taumxd,3,Fri Jun 5 07:57:48 2015 UTC,"Theros block looks good right now. Eidolon of the Great Revel, Temple of Malady, and Mana Confluence are all-non-mythics that break the $10 barrier.  If you're looking to go infinite on the current draft format you're going to have to sit on copies of cards and take your profits a year from now., or win at an insane rate because, right now, pack prices are so low you're not even breaking even if you come in second and open nothing."
lrcast,38jcx9,pahamack,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:15:34 2015 UTC,"If you're really looking to ""Go infinite"" in limited, then you'll likely have to give up hope if you want to do it through drafting, it's just incredibly unlikely to open enough cash to offset variance.  I instead suggest something different; sealed. In phantom sealed events (and phantom draft events while they are sometimes offered) you need to only win 1 out of every 4 events you play in for 10 point events (as long as you are able to 2-1 the rest) and in 16 point events like MM2 or phantom draft, 2-1 will let you go infinite.  Sealed is also good practice for more competitive events like GPs and PPTQs."
lrcast,38jcx9,jollyoldtime,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:54:47 2015 UTC,"So far I did turn out a profit on my MM2015 drafts playing in the 6-2-2-2 queues. I'm not saying I went ""infinite"" because I only played in 5 of them, and I don't think I'd be able to sustain that on average. I ended up with a 2-1 record in every single one of those drafts, netting 70 tix worth of packs. I rare-drafted 1 Tarmogoyf, 1 Dark Confidant, 1 Fulminator Mage, 1 Leyline of Sanctity, 1 Hurkyl's Recall, and a few other 1-tix rares, adding to around 70 tix total. That's a 140-125 = 15 tix profit over 5 drafts. Of course winning the Goyf lottery helped out a lot, but I would otherwise be down 30 tix over 5 drafts, which is not far from only 1 buy in."

lrcast,38jcx9,oraymw,2,Thu Jun 4 20:42:04 2015 UTC,"A Goyf on MODO is not worth close its paper equivalent. I sold mine for 50 tix, which is exactly 2 drafts.    The MM2 drafts definitely have a higher cost of entry, but they are super fun and it seemed to me that pulling cards in the 5-10 tix range is a realistic expectation. I raredrafted pretty agressively, but also passed a lot of 1-2 tix stuff when their was an actual good pick for my deck.    For the record I started playing MTGO pretty recently (I have about 15-20 drafts in there), and my rating is around 1680. I consider myself a decent player, but by no means a limited master.  If you're on a tight budget I can understand that it's a higher risk. The only thing I can say is this format is a ton of fun in my opinion, and I didn't feel like the difficulty was much higher than for DTK. People are just starting figuring out the format, and the latest LR episode should help you with that too."

Don't shy away from instants or abilities; your kid will figure it out and, let's face it, options are what make the game interesting.    I started with quick intros to each color identity and how much spells cost to cast.  Then we went through the turn structure.  Then we put out several creatures and spent some time talking about combat.  Finally, I introduced the concept of the stack, but simplified (essentially the last spell to be cast happens first) and illustrated some cool interactions.    Have fun and above all be positive.

Or at least that's how I justify to myself the losses to my wife who is a a keen board gamer but a relative novice at magic ;)   How is your daughter finding playing magic without being able to read? Presumably she memorises which cards have which french-vanilla keywords and what the spells do from the pictures?   I have wondered about trying such a deck with our eldest but in the end decided I'd wait and stick to other games until he can read well enough to at least be able to handle common keywords and card types."
lrcast,38jbaa,draig01,3,Thu Jun 4 23:25:51 2015 UTC,"She has a really good memory for cards.

She also will see a card in her dad's card collection and if she's seen us play it will often know the name and what deck it's in.   But we also started with all French vanilla creatures because that way she could pick a creature to play based on casting cost and after she played it we could remind her of any abilities it had. As we've added more complexity to her deck we've had one parent co-pilot until she got comfortable with the new cards. She's also now memorized some of the important words, such as instant.   She's not ready to play with anyone other than her dad or I, but she loves it. She says she wants to play magic professionally when she grows up."

There's plenty to get through in terms of the basics of casting spells, building a deck (establishing the right mix of lands, creatures, & spells), and how the basics of combat works (even this gets a little complex when looking at double blocking, for example.) From there you could slowly branch out by introducing one more complex concept at a time. Maybe Instants and just point out a couple places where it makes sense to use them rather than all the opportunities where you could; like using a Giant Growth mid combat. Or if you focus on deck building you could even start doing some two player draft variants right away, probably focusing on those that use face up drafting to begin with so you can talk her through the decisions.  One thing you may want to do is establish that the turn structure is Draw, Attack with available creatures, Cast spells. Since I think it's hard for new players to get out of the habit of playing their spells before combat. From there you could branch out and clarify that you can play things before combat if you want to but only if it's going to have an effect on what you're doing for combat that turn, like playing a Sorcery to clear a blocker."

I also kept a card of each type revealed so if they asked me something they don't have to show me their hand. And finally I let them win around two out of three games.  They were very curious so I added cards one by one to answer their questions. Once they tried the five colors, I find that brew decks from Theros block with only commons are better than duel decks.

lrcast,38kqrx,mrcjtm,3,Thu Jun 4 21:47:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting -- the deck came together pretty nicely, but I disagreed with a bunch of the picks, and I probably would have been RWu. In the end, I would have cut out the Sandstorm Charger and 2 plains, and I would play Hooded Assassin, Deathmist Raptor, and 2 more swamps. I think your mana is pretty weak, which could have been helped by taking an extra dual in pack 3 (which you had available). Going pick by pick, here are my thoughts:  P1P3: Not sure why you took the Deathfang here. It's kind of meh, and you aren't in black yet. I probably would have taken Sarkhan's Rage, and look to be either RW or RU, splashing the Ojutai.  P1P4: Probably Summit Prowler for me, even if I had taken the Deathfang the previous pick.  P1P6: I would have taken another Summit Prowler here, which would have cemented me pretty well into red. I'll stop pointing out the red picks now, but just wanted to illustrate why I would have been in that color.  P1P7: Honestly, I would have probably taken vial of dragonfire. You're still not quite sure what your colors are yet -- you could easily just be UW at this point -- so I probably go with the card that can make the deck regardless of what colors I end up being, and which tends to be pretty decent in UW which is otherwise light on removal.   P1P10: I guess this is a pretty decent signal that black is open. Butcher lasting to 10th pick isn't ridiculous, but it feels pretty good.  P2P4: I probably go with Silkwrap here -- though I can see some logic behind Haven. And I guess it's worth a ticket or two.  P2P7: Spellfist?  P3P1: As sad as it sounds, I might have taken Soul Summons here for curve considerations.  P3P2: As much as I like the Executioner, I think you have to take the land here, right?  P3P3: Again, as great as Aven is, I'm taking the land.  P3P4: Cloudform is totally defensible, but I would probably take whisk away."
lrcast,38iw9z,transcensionist,2,Thu Jun 4 14:52:23 2015 UTC,"P1P1: I debated between Thief of Hope and Guildmage, the former being a great pick for a spirit deck, the latter just being a great pick, period.  I went with the Guildmage, figuring it'll keep me open to either black or blue.  Shrewd Hatchling was also a decent choice, but I felt like it was a bigger dedication to U or R than Guildmage, since you can't just splash it and not run spells in those colors to knock off the -1/-1 counters.  P1P2: Easy Burst Lightning.  P1P3: I took Spread the Sickness here, just because all the other cards felt like I'd be giving up raw power for the chance at committing to a specific deck archetype.  Sphere of Suns might have been alright, but I like the removal, already having picked a black card.  P1P4: I took the Guildmage, too.  I felt it was a pretty strong signal that tokens are open, and even if they're not, it's the strongest card in the pack.  It doesn't match any of the colors I'd have grabbed so far, but we're only 4 picks in, and not really committed one way or the other anyway.  Plus, BWG works well as a token deck anyway.  P1P5: With so many colors floating around in the first few picks, I chose Horde of Notions, edging in on the idea of a 5-color deck.  I'm not sure this was the correct pick, as Otherworldly Journey and Apostle's Blessing are decent cards as well, but neither really plays well with a token deck, which I'm still hoping to shoot for.  I want the Thallid to wheel, but it's just the weakest card in the pack and I don't really want to pick it up here.  P1P6: Glad to see this Dread Drone, and my pick is to snap it up and push harder toward tokens.  P1P7: Without many token generators and unsure of whether I'll be able to make a proper token deck, I pass up on Bloothorne Vampire and snag the Evolving Wilds.  I still might end up 5 colors, and I don't feel the vampire is going to make or break a token deck.  The Aquastrand Spider is also an option since we're probably going to be in green anyway, but I'm still hedging between two archetypes, so I pass it here.  P1P8: However, I do take the spider in this pack.  If we end up playing black, I'm already dumping mana into the first Guildmage pick, which means I'm not going to have much to pump Ghostly Changeling with, which is the only other pick I'm really considering.  P1P9: Not much going on here.  I take the Vines of Vastwood, because it's on-color and I might find a reason to run hexproof.  P1P10: Necrogenesis as an easy token generator.  I'm glad this wheeled, and I'm happy to snap it up here.  P1P11: For a lack of anything better to play, I grab Sunspear Shikari.  It's a 2/2 for 2, and I might pick up some weapons at some point.  Plummet is the only other pick, and I think it's extremely weak, even as a sideboard card.  P1P12: Terashi's Grasp for an easy artifact/enchantment removal sideboard.  P1P13: I'll pick up the Thallid here, since it wheeled around and fits perfectly into the token deck I'm trying to make.  P1P14: Wrap in flames, because why the hell not.  P1P15: Kinda glad to see this Apostle's Blessing wheel back around.  Might not play it, but it's nice to have it in your pocket just in case.  P2P1: Although it pains me to pass up Wrecking Ball, I can't really pass up Conclave Phalanx, being a stable token deck card.  P2P2: Since the last Necrogenesis wheeled, I'm willing to pick up Nameless Inversion here, since we're lacking in removal.  P2P3: Nest Invader, just what we want to see here.  A token deck is looking like it's shaping up nicely.  P2P4: Though I want to pick up that Dread Drone, I feel like I have to pick up the Overwhelm instead.  I only have one board pump, and I can't bank on another one coming my way.  Hopefully the drone will wheel.  P2P5: I'm tempted to cut Shrivel just because it's so effective against this deck archetype, but I like taking a second Phalanx.  In the end, I think I cut the Shrivel instead.  In the end, the Phalanx is just a 2/4 dude, and he might wheel around.  P2P6: I'd grab Runed Servitor here, just because I'm lacking in solid 2-drops, and cycling through my deck should be helpful.  P2P7: Fortify, fantastic!  Windmill slam that bitch.  P2P8: There's a second Shrivel, and nothing up against it to make this a tough decision.  I cut it, and with gusto.  P2P9: Since I picked the Conclave Phalanx, it wouldn't be here. I'd grab the Bloodthorne Vampire, here, as a token saccing engine.  P2P10: And here's the Necrogenesis I was hoping would wheel.  Although it's tempting to take Ulamog's Crusher as a sideboard option, I'd rather have the deck consistency that comes from running two Necros.  P2P11: Nothing much to take here, so I grab the Mighty Leap, in case I think I might need a combat trick to make up for my lack of removal.  P2P12: I don't really want a second Overwhelm.  It costs too much, and doesn't even give my minions trample, and I already have 3 ""overrun"" type sources.  I grab Sundering Vitae as a second artifact/enchantment removal sideboard.  P2P13: Yay, Conclave Phalanx wheeled!  I take it without hesitation.  P2P14: Take a second Mighty Leap, just because I'm not playing red.  P2P15: Sickle Ripper is a decent 2-drop.  if I'm lacking 2-drops by the end of the draft, I'll gladly run him.  P3P1: As much as it hurts to pass an Indomitable Angle, it's not in my archetype.  I grab White Lightning, because it's great removal.  P3P2: Arrest, and with gusto.  Dread Drone wouldn't be bad, but I can't pass up prime removal like that.  P3P3: Iona, without even blinking.  Even if we don't get enough Eldrazi Token spawners to ramp into her, she's worth keeping in the sideboard for matchups that we can't win otherwise.  The only other pick here would be Raise the Alarm, and we're generating enough tokens already.  P3P4: I pick up a second Dread Drone here.  I'm hoping Fortify will wheel, then I can replace the Overwhelm with a second Fortify, since it's a lot cheaper to cast.  P3P5: Drooling Groodian.  It's an on-color beater and goes perfectly in this deck.  P3P6: Scion of the Wild, just the card I wanted to see!  P3P7: Dimir Aqueduct.  I still haven't decided if I want to cut that first Guildmage or not, but since there's no other good cards for my deck to be had here, I'd like to hedge on the chance to play him and draw some cards with him.  P3P8: Second Scion of the Wild is a great pick here.  Seeing this Thrummingbird makes me wonder what kind of graft deck we could have built, but I'm not too worried, since the token deck has shaped up nicely.  P3P9: Since I took the Sunlance in the first pick, it wouldn't be here.  I don't know what the other card would have been instead, but I'm going to run on the assumption that I'd still want to cut Shrivel.  P3P10: I'll take Kami of Ancient Law here.  The pick was between him and Daggerclaw Imp.  Though I like having the evasion option, and I already have two cards that blow up enchantment/artifacts, I like having a creature that blows up enchantments.  It gives me the choice to sub in a spell or a creature spell, as determined by my matchup.  P3P11: I'll take the Kavu Primarch here.  With convoke, it'll be an easy 7/7 most of the time, and it'll be a bigger threat than the two tokens I'd get from Raise the Alarm.  P3P12: Awesome, the Fortify wheeled!  I'll grab it here to replace that Overwhelm.  P3P13: Aquastrand Spider, because why not?  I can sub it in if I'm having problems with fliers, and since I didn't get any equipment, it's strictly better than Sunspear Shikari.  P3P14: And I'll cut this last Shrivel, because fuck that card.  P3P15: And this card doesn't matter.  TL;DR - GBW tokens."

lrcast,38iw9z,Crasha,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:57:28 2015 UTC,"With regards to the draft it looks like it was kind of all over the place, even if you managed to pick up some individually powerful cards. It's hard for me to evaluate without seeing a final decklist or card pool though."
lrcast,38iw9z,allenthar,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:11:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I should have included it. I'll follow up with it a little later. It was basically a WB midrange deck featuring Vampire Lacerators and Sunspear Shikaris but not much equipment. The deck itself was very weak and I think my mistakes were made in Pack 1, primarily from using Shadowmage Infiltrator then Selesnya Guildmage to make decisions."
lrcast,38iw9z,allenthar,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:17:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the big thing with pack 1 is to try and avoid letting your early picks dictate what you will do.  Even if they do make your deck at the end, they are only 1/40 cards, so thinking of every card in the context of ""how well does this work with Selesnya Guildmage"" is the wrong path.  My strategy for this format right now is to focus on picking up the pieces for a strong deck of any archetype in the colors that seem open (black/white removal, strong green creatures, blue tempo spells, etc.)  Once you've seen what cards come around at the end of pack 1, you can then start making archetype decisions.  Before that point, I'd just focus on taking generally strong cards that don't commit you.  In Vegas, I ended up with a successful affinity deck after spending the first pack drafting a mix of black, green, and white,  simply because I was able to identify that it was likely open after seeing what wheeled in the first pack."

A 2-1 record nets you 16 Phantom Points, which is enough for another draft. You can very very easily run streaks without paying anything at all, if you happened to have the Phantom Points around for the first draft. I've done five or six MM15 drafts this way and haven't paid a dime. Now obviously, for some people they actually want to own the cards they draft, or get a shot at opening a Tarmogoyf and raking in the money, but if you don't care to play Modern then it really doesn't matter if the cards are illusory. It's also a great way to learn the format before you venture into the 'real' queues."

I haven't drafted Modern Masters yet and am seriously considering switching to Khans draft from Dragons with the cheap booster prices and resale value of the fetch lands.

lrcast,38g5f3,Hopelandic,3,Thu Jun 4 00:10:34 2015 UTC,"The first two picks are iffy.  I'd say that Pacifism and Sarkhan's Rage are about equal in power, so which you go for is up to preference.  Red lets you dig into a stronger color, but white lets you dodge fighting others for the most coveted color in the draft meta.  I probably would have gone with the double Pacifism like you did, FWIW.  I think P1P3 was a mistake.  Scaleguard Sentinels is a stronger card than Palace Familiar at the 2-drop slot, and Palace Familiar is better in UB than it is in UW.  P1P4 is rough.  Surge of Righteousness is a great sideboard card (sometimes even mainboard, if you see a lot of B/R going around, though I didn't really see much in the first three picks), but I don't think you can pick it over Belltoll Dragon or Aerie Bowmasters.  Even Zephyr Scribe is a great pick, since it allows you to cycle through your deck once you get it up and running.  That said, with your current picks, I'd probably go with the dragon and hope that Cunning Breezedancer from pack 1 wheels back around.  P1P5, you're better off going with the scribe over the familiar, if you're sticking to blue.  That said, I'd take this pack as a sign that green is open, because Lurking Arynx is a strong green card.  I'd probably pick it up here and hedge in on green, were I in your position.  P1P6, since you're already dedicated to UW, Drowner is a decent pick here, given that you have two familiars.  That said, the Ainok Survivalist is a fantastic pick that I'd be happy to take here, were I drafting this deck, as I'd be going heavy WG.  P1P7, there's not much here in your colors.  Talgum's Strike isn't horrible, but your deck doesn't really have the punching power to make good use of it.  I'd probably have picked up the Custodian of the Trove or Contradict and banked on dragging the games out.  Pinion Feast would have been a decent sideboard had you hedged in on green earlier.  P1P8, with Conifer Strider alive 8 picks in, I'd say that green is probably fairly open.  That said, I would have probably taken Reduce in Stature over Dromoka Warrior.  Moving onto the next pack...  P2P1, I think you should have grabbed the Ojutai Interceptor or Herald of Dramoka.  You're not in Bolster, so the Aven Sunstriker is just going to be a 1/1 doublestriker for 3.  P2P4, I'd have picked up Echoes of the Kirin Tree or Sandstorm Charger.  The former will give you a way to make your Aven Sunstriker a threat (not to mention giving you a mana dump in the late game, and giving you a way to make your guys way bigger than your opponent can handle, without unconditional removal), and the latter will give you a solid blocker on the ground while your flyers do work in the air.  The charger would probably be the smarter pick, without any other synergies for bolster in your deck.  P2P5, I'd take Herald of Dramoka.  Elusive Spellfist doesn't do enough with how few spells you have in your deck, and only the one rebound card.  P2P6, again, you don't have the bolster to support Aven Sunstriker.  The Sandstorm Charger was the pick, here.  P2P7, Enduring Victory is fine.  I could also make an argument for Strongarm Monk, but since half your spells are sorcery speed, it's not nearly as strong as it otherwise could be.  P3P1, Whisk Away would have been a better pick.  The three health and 1/3 blocker are less useful than being able to stall out somebody's draw for a turn.  P3P5, you have so many 2-drops already, you should have taken the Great-Horn Krushok.  The big, dumb 3/5 for 5 will clutter up the ground really well.  P3P8, Mindscour Dragon was the pick.  You have no mana fixing, so splashing black for Harsh Sustenance will only make your deck more inconsistent.  TL;DR - It seems like you're too focused on ""value"" cards and ""combo"" cards, refusing to pick up the more boring, vanilla cards that have better stats and are more likely to trade better.  You have to keep in mind what your deck currently looks like when you make a pick, because there were several times when you picked a card that requires combo pieces that you just don't have, or have so few of that you can't bank on seeing them fall into your hand during a match."
lrcast,38g5f3,Greyfeld,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:59:19 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the detailed comments!  p1p3 - I don't have sentinels that high on my personal pick order, it's too often a 2/3 for 3 and not often enough a 3/4 for 2 for my liking.  p1p4 - Agree with your logic here, which was backed up by not seeing black or red until round 3, whilst I got beaten to death in round 2 by the dragon i'd passed... ah well!  p1p5 - Again, I don't rate the arynx that highly - I feel it does poorly on the vanilla test, and the ability is too marginal to make it a strong pick - do I have it rated too low?  p2p1 - I feel like sunstrikers is better than interceptor, and certainly better than herald. The megamorph ability is not valueless, and double-strike has nice synergy with the taigam's strike picked earlier.  p2p4 - Echoes was certainly in consideration here.  p2p5 - I ended up with 8 spells in the maindeck (inc. 2 rebound), which I think is sufficient to justify spellfist over herald. The evasion is valuable.  p2p6 - Charger is another card I have low on my pick order - it's incredibly unattractive face up, and struggling to make par even when megamorphed. The number of 5/5's at common/uncommon in the format (Elk-herd, Angler, Behemoth) also leave it a bit poorly positioned for my liking. Thoughts?  p2p7 - This was a close decision. In the end I decided that dealing with otherwise unanswerable threats was a higher priority (and bolster was a nice bonus with two sunstrikers)  p3 - agree with all your comments here, probably got a bit too frustrated by seeing 2 sandsteppe outcasts as the sum total of my ""payoff"" for playing white :P not the value I was hoping for!"
lrcast,38g5f3,Greyfeld,4,Thu Jun 4 13:00:40 2015 UTC,"p1p3 - I don't have sentinels that high on my personal pick order, it's too often a 2/3 for 3 and not often enough a 3/4 for 2 for my liking.   The problem is that you're rating Palace Familiar too highly.  It's okay in an exploit deck, where you can ping away for a couple turns, then sac it to something to draw an extra card.  As it is, you're running UW, which isn't an exploit deck, which makes the familiar more of a card cycle than an actual card.  Sentinels aren't amazing, but they have a relevant body for 1 more mana, and they can kill morphs without dying.   p1p5 - Again, I don't rate the arynx that highly - I feel it does poorly on the vanilla test, and the ability is too marginal to make it a strong pick - do I have it rated too low?   Arynx is stronger in GB where you can beat your opponent over the head with it in conjunction with Coat with Venom and Grim Contest.  That said, it's far better than Palace Familiar.  Like I said in my TLDR, you're valuing combo pieces over vanilla fatties, and it's hurting your deck consistency.  Also, the ability makes it easy to force the opponent to lose minions he otherwise wants to keep on the board.  It's pseudo-removal in that sense.   p2p1 - I feel like sunstrikers is better than interceptor, and certainly better than herald. The megamorph ability is not valueless, and double-strike has nice synergy with the taigam's strike picked earlier.   You're paying 8 mana and blowing two turns for a 2/2 doublestrike.  While it does have synergy with Taigam's Strike, you're crossing your fingers and hoping that you have both cards in your hand at the same time, instead of just going to their head with a 4/2 beater (which means it does the same damage as the 2/2 first strike without any buffs) that morphs for a mana less.  Or can just be played as a 3/1 flyer on turn 4.  If you were running bolster, that'd be one thing.  But you're not.   p2p5 - I ended up with 8 spells in the maindeck (inc. 2 rebound), which I think is sufficient to justify spellfist over herald. The evasion is valuable.   Spellfist does nothing when it's not pumped.  It sits there and chump blocks and dies.  The herald at least has 2 damage if it needs to chump block, and doesn't require dumping cards into just to make it worth attacking with.  Plus, the vigilance is a fantastic cherry, especially when you have multiple warriors on board (which you did end up drafting).   p2p6 - Charger is another card I have low on my pick order - it's incredibly unattractive face up, and struggling to make par even when megamorphed. The number of 5/5's at common/uncommon in the format (Elk-herd, Angler, Behemoth) also leave it a bit poorly positioned for my liking. Thoughts?   You're not going to run into an Elk-herd, Angler or Behemoth every single match, and there are plenty of 3 health creatures that it can block very well.  If nothing else, you can double-block with another creature, and your opponent has to decide which to kill because the Charger's health is so high.  The point of the Chargers is to clutter up the ground while you bash their face in, in the air.  Again, you're underestimating the draw of a big body on the ground.   p3 - agree with all your comments here, probably got a bit too frustrated by seeing 2 sandsteppe outcasts as the sum total of my ""payoff"" for playing white :P not the value I was hoping for!   The problem wasn't playing white, the problem was playing blue.  There's a Temur War Shaman in the very first pick of pack 3, which is an amazing card, and Abzan Kin-guard on the wheel, if you managed to edge everybody else out of green."
lrcast,38g5f3,aparnell7,3,Thu Jun 4 18:29:41 2015 UTC,"It looks like you really wanted to be blue, but not sure why. Pack 1 didn't really have any good blue cards and there were not really any blue signals coming your way (no I don't think palace familiar is very good). Tbh you didn't really see any blue card above average the whole draft.   It looks like you were getting a lot of green passed your way early and I probably would've picked up some dragon scarred bears, Scaleguard sentinels, aerie Bowmasters, etc, which would've put you much stronger going into pack 2.  One thing I'm trying to get better at myself is being able to see the commons that are a little above average vs the ones that are just normal playable to help with signals. So in p1p3, both bear and sentinels are half a step ahead of everything in the pack. P1p4, you now have 3 green cards that are slightly better than everything else, and this is where I would start to pick up on green being open. Then again in p1p6, while gurmag drowner is on the same level as herald and survivalist, you would be 5 picks in with solid GW cards, so I wouldn't consider drowner here. P1p8 is solid and shows the open colors - 4 solid cards you can take (also, 8th pick beserkers onslaught? Card is nuts, oh well). Following this all the way through the draft I think you could've ended up with a much stronger GW deck.   Just my two cents, hope it helps."
lrcast,38g5f3,TheJediCounsel,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:33:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts!  I'm trying to build up the same skill. For me, it fluctuates too much from set to set at the moment. I felt I had a strong grasp on FRF-KTK, and rarely ended up cut, but I've found DTK much harder to get my head around.  Judging by the comments I'm receiving, I may have some of the middling green commons rated a little too low compared to their peers. Are sentinels and dragon-scarred bear really that good? I can see the argument more strongly for Bowmasters"
lrcast,38g5f3,TheJediCounsel,2,Thu Jun 4 13:16:59 2015 UTC,"I think this draft was a tough one. To me the problem stemmed from p1p3 and 4, there was some solid green being past your way. At that point I would've abandoned blue for green.   In pack 2 and 3 red started coming around, you might've gone that way but understandably leaving your white with 2 pacifisms is rough.  That draft wasn't gonna be easy no matter what happened, but the only thing I can say would be to try and stay open a little longer. Especially when one color (blue) isn't looking particularly tempting."
lrcast,38g5f3,sylverfyre,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:05:50 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for your comments!  Out of curiosity, do you think a scaleguard sentinels p3 and an aerie bowmasters p4 are sufficiently solid for that spot in the draft to be a signal that green is open. To me, both cards are in that 5th-7th pick slot - middling playables (bowmasters may be slightly above that), but by no means certain to have been the strongest green cards, or even the strongest green commons in the pack.   That being said, I'm fairly certain that the same logic can be applied to belltoll dragon and palace familiar..."

Still interesting as a thought experiment though, they aren't exactly Elk-Herd or Epic Confrontation, which would have been good enough for me to take a flyer on.  I've had mixed experiences with the dragon. Sometimes it feels underpowered, other times it feels like the best card you could possibly have in the situation. I regretted not having it when I was being beaten to death with it whilst sat on a hand of sweet removal and with a selection of smaller fliers which got removed whenever I attempted a double block!"

I would play both Kamis for sure, probably over a Journey, and even consider dropping a Scuttling Death because you have a lot of 5/6 drops. But the deck looks great.

The cards I prioritize are 1)Nameless Inversion, 2)Anything with Soulshift, and 3)Bloodthrone Vampire. I will take a spirit with Soulshift over almost any other Spirit card when I'm in this deck.   There have been several instances (but still a small sample size, admittedly) where I have been able to sac 2 to 3 soulshifters to a Bloodthrone Vampire - sac the lower casting cost first and work up to the higher cost ones in order to return the first ones to your hand. It works even better when you can return Nameless Inversion to your hand and cast it in the middle of the sacrifices to return it again."
lrcast,389oor,BonSequitur,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"I would definitely cut a Ghostly Changeling and an Otherworldly Journey for a Kami of Ancient Law. I would probably cut the other Otherworldly Journey for a Bone Splinters. Otherwordly Journey isn't really good unless you have multiple creatures with ETB effects that are worth a card or so in your deck, and you have 0.  You really, really want as many low drop spirits as you can get, and having turn-two plays is really at a premium in this format. I think Khans has trained us to think it's okay if your curve starts on three and that just isn't true in MM2.  The deck is fine, it definitely has a very good high end, but variance happens, misplay happens, and opponents with even better decks happen. Especially in 8-4s, often you only get to play one match with the deck and you end up getting less information than you'd like. Also, sometimes you have a medium draw and they have Raise the Alarm into Scatter the Seeds into Kozilek's Predator into Overwhelming Stampede. It's impossible to tell without knowing all the details of your draft whether this is the best you could have done in your seat, too."

G/W tokens is very strong--your Pillories of the Sleepless are way outclassed there (take turn 3 off to lock down one token), Waxmane Baku suffers quite a bit as well, Midnight Banshee is amazing when you can actually cast her (so, rarely), Bone Splinters is pretty bad (kills a token after sacc'ing a token), and Otherworldly Journey is very weak when they have so many chump blockers and the game doesn't stall out (no time for Ghost Council shenanigans). Nameless Inversion is underwhelming against tokens as well. It's just a very bad matchup for an otherwise solid deck."

lrcast,3892e9,ryantucker1986,10,Tue Jun 2 18:19:39 2015 UTC,"I believe randomly determining a winner, intentional draws, and dropping with a pool are all bad things for the game for the same reason - they undermine the competition of the game. Tournaments would be overall better tournaments if none of these things happen, even though they help the specific players.   However, we make concessions allowing the latter two because the alternatives are so much worse. Playing to time for ID's, and stealing cards during registration.   I hate to be the pessimist, but people sometimes pull swaps to keep a big money foil, and it will happen at a much higher frequency if you don't allow drops.   It's better to allow a way out."
lrcast,3892e9,bearrosaurus,3,Tue Jun 2 18:56:52 2015 UTC,"To your pessimistic point: I disagree. Although I'm not aware of anyone swapping big money foils, I could see it happening.  However, I think the vast majority of magic players have a line somewhere between ""drop with these cards that I'm, by rule, allowed to"" and ""steal this card from a pack and replace it with another"".  There's a pretty big difference there. There is also a great negative stigma from the community surrounding stealing that would help dissuade people from doing the swap."
lrcast,3892e9,dumac,9,Tue Jun 2 19:06:31 2015 UTC,"Many players at GPs are mainly there for side events / artists / vendors. Some don't even like limited, but want the playmat or at least to try it out. It sounds like you are suggesting not allowing people to drop, when it is a necessity. Otherwise you are suggesting we penalize players for wanting to keep their expensive pull.  Also, it's important to note almost no one will drop when they crack an insane 6x Comet Storm pool. It's not the quality of the deck that makes people drop, it's the expensiveness of the cards... which often doesn't correlate to a strong Limited pool."
lrcast,3892e9,mtg_liebestod,2,Tue Jun 2 19:15:32 2015 UTC,"Those players can buy/trade for the playmat, right? Or drop after passing? If no one drops the chances of them getting passed a money pool are exactly the same as them opening a money pool.  I'm not arguing that we penalize players for wanting to keep their expensive pulls. I'm arguing that the only reason they're opening those particular packs is for the logistics of the tournament and they aren't that person's pulls to drop with!  How about this scenario?  You notice that your neighbor has registered a crazy money pool, stays in the tournament and the first pass sends that pool to you. Should you be able to drop right then even though your only relationship to that pool is that it randomly got passed through you?  How does the person in this example own the cards any more than the person who originally opened them? I think they both are only touching the packs on the way to their final destination for the sake of tournament logistics.  EDIT: Also forgot to say, but your last point is very good.  It doesn't necessarily make the pools stronger. That's format dependent (fetch lands weren't great for sealed as a rare :().  But it does still create a disparity in the pack quality between the passed pools and the pre-registered sleep in special pools."
lrcast,3892e9,corran__horn,7,Tue Jun 2 19:24:41 2015 UTC,"You haven't said it explicitly, but it sounds like you want to forbid people from dropping and keeping the cards they open during registration. Right?  That's just not a thing you can enforce. People will walk out if they open expensive cards. Or, they will be extremely incentivized to swap out cards, which is even worse. I don't want to penalize that behavior because it makes perfect sense to me, and is a crappy situation to be in.  On top of it all, I honestly think you're making a mountain out of a molehill here. The downsides of allowing people to drop are minimal. I think the only realistic solution is to have a third party register all of the pools at once."
lrcast,3892e9,corran__horn,4,Tue Jun 2 19:30:55 2015 UTC,"Right, I would like to forbid dropping during registration.  I think it's both something that can and should be enforced by the DCI under the old ""Theft of tournament materials"". The system today is supposed to be 3rd party registers your pool... 1st party you; 2nd party TO/Wizards; 3rd party random person.  The thing is...it doesn't seem like that big of a deal when one person does it, but the more people that start doing it the worse it gets.  And the other extreme of 0 people doing it keeps things nice and clean and everyone over the course of their magic tournaments will get an average number of money pools! Allow me to quote from Owen's Article:   Imagine you're a grinder who plays in only local PTQs and your one and only goal is to get on the Pro Tour, but you can't afford to travel. You get a couple Sealed PTQs a year, and you play them all and prepare extra hard for them. Let's say your name is Mike Z, and every Sealed PTQ registration period is in alphabetical order, and there's another person named John Z, and the two of you always sit next to each other. You would never drop under any circumstances, because if you drop then you can't get 1st place and qualify for the Pro Tour, but John doesn't care at all—he will drop if he gets any valuable cards at all. The fact that your tournament's deck registration is seated alphabetically and that you usually pass to people at the same table means it absolutely does not matter what the contents of your pool are, someone else at the table will get it as it was opened.  John, on the other hand, exists only to remove high-quality cards from the pool at your table build from or to pass cards of low quality. When I say the word quality, I mean strictly in terms of financial value—but, very often for Sealed deck play, more expensive cards have a high power level for game play. This is true for cards like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Sphinx's Revelation.  Imagine the tournament is 100 people, one Mike Z and 99 people who are identical to John Z. Now assume that John Z chooses to drop during registration whenever he gets an Elspeth, Sun's Champion. Once you enter a tournament like this, it is now impossible to play with Elspeth in the Swiss rounds and you can only get paired against it. When incentives are this perverse and people always look out for their short term dollar EV, then the tournament on the whole suffers.   The Impacts are real.  Also, I'd like to hear why being able to drop with your registration pool makes perfect sense to you."
lrcast,3892e9,Airplace,7,Tue Jun 2 19:43:13 2015 UTC,"The impacts really aren't that real, though. I'm getting the impression you are reacting to GP Vegas, which was unique for two significant reasons: it was a GP, and it was MM2. GPs in general have more drops due to the crowd they attract: any Magic player, even people that are not fans of Limited and may be there for any reason. On top of that, MM2 has insanely expensive cards in it at a much, much higher frequency than any other event. This will lead to more pools that are above the profit margin, something like 10% instead of 0.1%.  PPTQs and higher, however, entice a more competitive crowd. I've never seen anyone drop from a PPTQ because they've already spent the entry fee and travel to be there. Unlike a GP, it's the only reason they are there. I can't imagine too many people have dropped when opening $10-20 cards like Elspeth. It just doesn't happen. Even when it does, I don't see it affecting the tournament in any measurable way.  I think it's fair to say that Owen Turtenwald has a history of making complete non-issues into issues, given recent events. I take his article with a grain of salt.  And yes, it makes perfect sense to me to be able to drop when you open cards. You seem to believe that Wizards or TOs can require an amount of work from event attendees to set up the tournament. Players do not work for Wizards or CFB and should not be expected to hold any responsibility over registering pools or any other tournament set up. If you hand a pile of cards to people, they should be able to do whatever they want with that whenever they want, with the only penalty being not being able to continue in the tournament. The only way to enforce what you are suggesting is to, at the minimum, ban people from further tournaments for some amount of time. That is completely unfair and ridiculous."
lrcast,3892e9,dumac,2,Tue Jun 2 20:14:54 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""the impacts really aren't that real""? There are impacts, and each individual drop is not going to swing an entire tournament, but one of the things magic teaches us is that small things add up.  I don't think it's fair to dismiss Owen's points due to an unrelated comment that he's since apologized for.   GPs in general have more drops due to the crowd they attract: any Magic player, even people that are not fans of Limited and may be there for any reason.   Sure, I have no problem with people dropping, but if you don't have any interest in playing than there's nothing wrong with buying 6 packs and cracking them. There's also nothing wrong with entering the tournament, playing a round and dropping. Or entering the tournament, getting passed your pool, and deciding you don't feel like playing. Nothing about being a casual player makes them drop during deck registration.   If you hand a pile of cards to people, they should be able to do whatever they want with that whenever they want, with the only penalty being not being able to continue in the tournament.   Based on that, I'd like to revisit a previous scenario I mentioned. Are you OK with this as well?   How about this scenario? You notice that your neighbor has registered a crazy money pool, stays in the tournament and the first pass sends that pool to you. Should you be able to drop right then even though your only relationship to that pool is that it randomly got passed through you?   Consider deck reg a part of the tournament fees/process."
lrcast,3892e9,dumac,4,Tue Jun 2 21:00:28 2015 UTC,"In a perfect world, there would be shame attached to this kind of behavior and people would think twice before doing it  I feel judges should calmly explain to people that their actions affect others, and that everyone around them would be much happier if they didn't drop for reasons other than wanting the foil Purphoros for themselves.   Owen 'disgusts me', as does the premise of his entire article. It is just as irrational and emotional as his hate-filled twitter brigade a couple of days ago.  The kind of attitude Owen presents is much unhealthier for magic as a hole. You really want players and judges to shame people for wanting to drop with their pool? That's a great way to alienate players and foster and unhealthy community."
lrcast,3892e9,dumac,2,Wed Jun 3 19:40:25 2015 UTC,"Consider deck reg a part of the tournament fees/process.   I'm arguing that that's not a thing you can do. People don't owe TOs or Wizards any of their time or effort. Just money. Opening product gives people an inherent relationship to it that you can't take away without having problems and being kind of shitty.  That's an interesting comparison, I suppose, but I think holding a registered pool for literally two seconds is not at all legitimately comparable to opening and registering product.  Again, I don't see this even having a nominal effect on tournament play anyway."
lrcast,3892e9,Carribi,3,Tue Jun 2 21:25:02 2015 UTC,"Holding [someone else's] pool for 2 seconds during a pass and registering [someone else's] pool are comparable to me. In both cases you know they are not meant for you. In one case, most consider it alright to just take the packs and leave. In the other case, most people don't think it's fair. To me, there is no difference. Both pools are intended for someone else and the only reason I even have them is to help make the tournament more fair. Therefore, I cannot justify taking that product for myself.  I guess I would summarize what I believe as:   filtering valuable pools out of the swapped decks could in some (most?) formats filter out coppies of strong cards from the event. pre-registered pools are not filtered in this manner. the average value/strength of a pool is different between the two groups of pools this is unfair   Thanks for explaining your stance and for your patience.  Though, it seems like we are not going to end up changing eachother's mind.

lrcast,3892e9,dumac,3,Tue Jun 2 21:58:02 2015 UTC,"The Impacts are real.   Maybe, although as n (the number of players in the tournament) increases the expected disadvantage of being Mike Z asymptotes towards 0.

Sorry, but I don't think it's fair to say you're ""forcing people in to a mindset of cheat to keep"". Cheating/stealing is never acceptable, whether one agrees with the rules or not, no one is ever forced to break the rules. Not to mention, no one is going to let their neighbor get away with palming a foil goyf.  Sure, some times it will go by unnoticed, but people will get caught if they do something like that."

lrcast,3892e9,pahamack,6,Wed Jun 3 15:46:35 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying that I believe that the tournament experience would be improved overall if dropping with the pool you opened wasn't allowed.  That said, I think you're being ridiculous by saying that people that drop are throwing tantrums.  As long as dropping is legal, it should be an option to consider rationally.  If your EV for dropping is higher than your EV for playing (counting everything from prizes to pro tour invites to the enjoyment of playing the tournament), you should drop.  I also think that it has little actual effect on tournament integrity.  As long as players are seated randomly, the only difference is between players with the sleep in special and players without.  And I'm not convinced that the average quality of a pool worth dropping for is actually very different from the overall average quality of a pool."
lrcast,3892e9,SirChuffly,2,Tue Jun 2 22:21:05 2015 UTC,"Thought about it, you're right that tantrum comparison is not fair. Poor choice of words.  Edit: still disagree that anyone should drop before swap though. The pool is not really intended for that person."
lrcast,3892e9,Slypenslyde,5,Wed Jun 3 02:37:49 2015 UTC,"This is the same issue as Pascal's pick in the top 8, and it all boils down to Wizard's refusal to help bring down the ridiculous prices for some of their cards. Player's simply shouldn't be put in the awkward decision of playing their best game or making money.  If I open a pool literally worth 500+ dollars, do you really expect me to just burn $500 just because it is 'good for the game'. It is not my duty, as a player, to abide by some honor code in order to make WotC's product better.   Not allowing people to drop is just not feasible. You own the cards that are in your hands, at all times. You can drop at any time. Any other set of rules would be impossible to enforce and maybe not even legal in some situations.   Expecting people to burn money just for some irrational love of the game is unreasonable as well.  You are free to make whatever choices you want, but don't try to police the rest of the players, especially on such illogical grounds. I don't fault Pascal for raredrafting the foil goyf, and I don't fault any players for dropping from an event after opening a foil goyf.  I also don't think it has as much of an impact as you are making it out too. Most of the bomb rares in MM2 are actually junk rares. People will likely only drop due to a foil goyf or a goyf + combination of other money cards. People will pass their ant queens and comet storms."
lrcast,3892e9,SirChuffly,2,Wed Jun 3 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"This is not at all the same issue as Pascal's pick. Even though draft and sealed aren't the same, it is closer to someone opening a pack with a foil goyf + goyf, and dropping from the top 8, walking away with his packs. Doesn't that compromise the top 8 draft?   If I open a pool literally worth 500+ dollars, do you really expect me to just burn $500 just because it is 'good for the game'. It is not my duty, as a player, to abide by some honor code in order to make WotC's product better.   I expect you to sit down at the tournament with 6 packs in front of you. Understand before you crack the first pack that regardless of what these packs contain they are not yours. You are recording every card that belongs in someone else's pool so that we can all play fair tournament magic and have a good time.  Then I expect you to open the packs, sort them alphabetically and mark them down on the sheet, not really caring what those cards are because it shouldn't matter to you.  Next, to pass those cards around per the judges instructions, receive a pile of cards from someone who, like you, respected the process of the tournament and have the exact same chance you did when you sat down of getting a money pool if that's what you care about!  This is not ""burning money"". The fact that players see it as a misplay to complete a tournament set-up process if the pool has value makes me a little upset...not at that player, but at whatever forces created that pressure.   I don't fault Pascal for raredrafting the foil goyf, and I don't fault any players for dropping from an event after opening a foil goyf.   Nor do I.  I would fault him if he dropped from the top 8, but not for raredrafting.  I used this example somewhere else in the thread too, but please answer how you feel about this situation. The person next to you is registering their pool and you overhear them ""wow, two goyfs! one foil!"" ""Geez, lucksack! Foil spellskite!"". etc. that pool is loaded! However, he decides he wants to stay in the tournament and will be passing his pool.  The judge tells everyone to pass their pools to the left for the first pass, and you end up with this crazy money pool.  Should you be able to drop before the next pass is complete? Should you have any less right to those cards as the person who registered them?"
lrcast,3892e9,pahamack,4,Wed Jun 3 20:02:31 2015 UTC,"You have two arguments here.    Dropping affects the fairness of the competition. You shouldn't be able to drop because those cards aren't yours at the time of dropping.   Addressing the first argument   This is not at all the same issue as Pascal's pick.   It is the exact same issue. EV vs the 'fairness' of the game. Pascal raredrafting effects the rest of the players at the table as well, corrupting the 'purity' of the game. Pascal is not only making his deck weaker, skewing competition, but also making other people's decks stronger or weaker depending on what they were expecting.    Doesn't that compromise the top 8 draft?   Yes, as does rare drafting. Your entire argument around compromising the game applies directly to raredrafting. Maybe the person to your left could really use that rare you, the generic player, just took purely based on money value. Shouldn't they have it, since they correctly found their colors?  Wouldn't that be truer to the spirit of competition? Shouldn't players be rewarded by getting an Elspeth pick 2 or 3 because they correctly found that white was open, and now they are being robbed of that valuable Elspeth that same way players in sealed are being robbed of their hypothetical Elspeths? I'm sure Owen would agree.  The argument behind players dropping compromising the game depends on the fact that expensive cards sometimes = powerful cards. This is still true in draft. If player A never raredrafts, and players B does, aren't you disadvantaged sitting left of player B compared to player A? That isn't an equal playing field. Should raredrafting also be illegal now?  Addressing the second argument   Understand before you crack the first pack that regardless of what these packs contain they are not yours.   I don't understand that. Those aren't the rules, and I don't think they should be the rules. What happens if you have to leave mid registration? You just get no cards? That doesn't seem fair.  Plus, how is wizards supposed to enforce this? DCI bans? They can't physically stop you from leaving with product that was given to you and you paid for.   Wizards knows it is an infeasible and unenforceable rule. In a perfect world, the registration process wouldn't exist, but that is also currently infeasible. Rules reflect the realities of the world they are made for. That is why you are allowed to drop at any time and allowed to keep the cards in your posession.  The same goes for dropping in a draft. Do you also believe players shouldn't be able to drop during a draft?   This is not ""burning money"".   Under the current rules it is."

Pascal is not only making his deck weaker, skewing competition, but also making other people's decks stronger or weaker depending on what they were expecting.   Pascal's pick does not make the game less fair, it is an incorrect pick. On top of that, it could even be considered a poor attempt to hate draft.  He is playing within the confines of a draft, picking one card, for whatever reason, and passing the rest.  Would you say this is different than opening the pack, deciding you want ALL the cards, removing yourself from the tournament, and keeping the contents?  EDIT: You also seemed to argue the opposite in another thread the other day regarding pascal's pick..    His drafting does not negatively affect a single other person besides him.   Would have been a better way to put it. It positively affects the other players, as someone gets a burst lightning!   I have no issues with rare/hate drafting. People are free to make incorrect picks during a draft.   Shouldn't players be rewarded by getting an Elspeth pick 2 or 3 because they correctly found that white was open, and now they are being robbed of that valuable Elspeth that same way players in sealed are being robbed of their hypothetical Elspeths?   Players shouldn't have a reasonable expectation of getting a 3rd pick Elspeth. It's very likely that someone would hate-draft the card. Even if someone does take it for ""the money"" it's still part of the draft process.   What happens if you have to leave mid registration? You just get no cards? That doesn't seem fair.   This case would be very very rare, but it's still easily solvable. Here are 6 unopened packs, a judge will register the remainder of that pool.  Additionally, if the person really does ""need to leave"" they are not making their decision based on the quality of their pool -- so it does not have the same negative impacts on the overall sealed event. In most other cases, the person could wait until after the pools are passed to drop -- which as I've said before -- if everyone is playing by the same rules is equally as likely to be a money pool.   Understand before you crack the first pack that regardless of what these packs contain they are not yours.   I don't understand that. Those aren't the rules, and I don't think they should be the rules.    You're right, those aren't the rules..which I do think is a problem. You asked what I expected someone to do ""burn 500?"". So if we could have a rule change to disallow dropping during registration, that's how I'd expect people to think.  How do you feel about my example where someone wants to drop during the passing phase?   I used this example somewhere else in the thread too, but please answer how you feel about this situation.

lrcast,3892e9,Slypenslyde,2,Wed Jun 3 20:58:26 2015 UTC,"Pascal's pick does not make the game less fair   How so? It seems to fit all the qualifications that both you and Owen cited for ruining limited Magic fairness. Raredrafting removes hypothetical valuable cards from the pool of cards passed to you, whether opened or passed, making you disadvantaged for not dropping/raredrafting.  If you are in a GP and your goal is to top 8 no matter what, then you aren't raredrafting. However, the dude sitting next to you doesn't have the same opinion and decides to raredraft all the valuable rares that were coming your way. Aren't you disadvantaged here? Wouldn't it be fairer if all players refused to raredraft, and instead drafted purely on game value? Wouldn't Magic be a more competitive and purer game if all the cards were worth the same dollar amount?  To quote Owen:    Now, before I hope to get a good Sealed pool, I have to hope to not be seated near people who are going to drop.   Now, before you hope to get a good draft deck, you have to hope to not be seated near people who are going to raredraft.   I have also heard people explain to me that if you open an incredibly valuable card and you're forced to pass it, it feels terrible. I agree that it probably makes the person who passed the card feel bad, but it also makes the person who gets passed the card feel very good!   Applies word for word to raredrafting.   On top of that, it could even be considered a poor attempt to hate draft   No one in their right mind would consider an early foil goyf pick as a hate draft. The reason behind the pick was purely financial, which is the same as the reason to drop during registration.   Would you say this is different than opening the pack, deciding you want ALL the cards, removing yourself from the tournament, and keeping the contents?   Different in what way? Of course they are different, as they are different actions, but they share similar intent and effect on the tournament.   I have no issues with rare/hate drafting.   Again, don't link these together. Hate drafting is an in-game strategy and a good one in some scenarios (i.e. team draft). You are trying to reduce an opponent's deck quality. Rare drafting occurs completely outside the game. Your motivations are not game based by financial based.   EDIT: You also seemed to argue the opposite in another thread the other day regarding pascal's pick..   I fail to see how this is relevant, but thanks for apparently creepily sifting through my post history. If you read the response thread, you would see that someone replied and said that it could not only positively effect other drafts, but also negatively too. He was pointing out that my reasoning was flawed, and I ultimately agreed with him with leads to my point today. Rare drafting absolutely does effect the outcome of a draft as it changes the available draft pool on an aspect (money) that should be separate from the game.   Players shouldn't have a reasonable expectation of getting a 3rd pick Elspeth. It's very likely that someone would hate-draft the card.    Why not? It could very likely happen in a top 8 draft of a GP, where rare drafting is not as incentivized. Hate drafting is not the reason planeswalkers disappear pick 1 in most drafts regardless of color - rare drafting is. I've gotten third and fourth pick Citadel Siege, but I have never been passed a Narset nor do I expect to be.   I'm going to focus on the idea that players dropping compromises the tournament, as that is the only real reason to make a change to the rules. Your other argument is simply semantics. And I argue that it does not affect the quality of the tournament any more than raredrafting (likely much less than raredrafting) and as such I don't see it as a real issue.  If you think dropping should be illegal because it dilutes the purity of the game, then you should also think raredrafting should also be illegal because it does the same thing. And neither of them will be, because enforcing such a rule is not feasible."
lrcast,3892e9,pahamack,2,Wed Jun 3 21:50:52 2015 UTC,"There's a fundamental difference between draft and sealed.  In draft, you are empowered to adapt to the situation and draft the correct card accordingly.  If the drafter sitting on your right is drafting every rare, you have the ability to compensate in whatever way is deemed best.  In sealed you have no power of choice over the cards you have access to.  You simply acquire a card pool and make due with what you have.  You do not have an opportunity to adapt to the environment.  Given that difference, I do not believe the we can realistically compare the concept of raredrafting to the concept of dropping with a money sealed pool - we would be comparing apples to oranges.  As for who owns the cards that get opened, I believe the legal precedent is to say that the cards belong to the person who ultimately receives them.  When you open those packs, you appear to be performing a voluntary service to the Tournament Organizer that you volunteered for with your entry into the event.  Under this model you would have no right to drop until you receive the card pool with which you build your deck for the event.  That said, Wizards has not set any sort of precedent whatsoever.  Unless Wizards issues a ruling of some kind to either support the act of dropping before registration or condemn it, any approach to the issue constitutes nothing short of personal opinion.  There are no rights or rules other than those explicitly set in place."
lrcast,3892e9,Slypenslyde,2,Wed Jun 3 22:57:28 2015 UTC,"You can't adapt in draft because you don't necessarily know that someone is raredrafting. You can hope to get passed good cards in P3 and then not, but you won't know that they were even opened. This is the same as not knowing who is passing you your sealed pool.   The only difference between sealed and draft is that in draft you can take a single card. Everybody can easily money draft while still playing the event. With sealed you have to drop, making the process more noticable.  Wizards only issues ruling against something. By not making any rules against dropping, they are thereby supporting it. I don't think is any legal precedent whatsoever that the cards belong to the person who ultimately receive them. I believe the opposite is true. While they are in your hands during registration, they are yours.  They can't call the police for you at a GP because you dropped during registration."
lrcast,3892e9,pahamack,2,Wed Jun 3 23:05:17 2015 UTC,"No existing tournament rule or violation procedure involves calling the cops, nor are they likely to in the future.  That argument is a straw man. Your previous argument simply doesn't hold water.  If I never see a rare in my draft I can assume that I will need to draft answers or removal more highly than normal in order to deal with the rares my opponents have drafted.  This is the same as if I see packs utterly devoid of artifacts in MM15 draft.  I can assume that there is at least one affinity drafter and take smash to smithereens and other artifact removal spells more highly to adapt.  This is how draft is self-correcting.  It is the essence of drafting, and without it, drafting has no identity."

That does not change the nature of a straw man argument, but I will cede that we both may have made mistakes.  My apologies."

lrcast,3892e9,_Blurgh_,2,Wed Jun 3 11:02:16 2015 UTC,"Reasons related to this were discussed by Loucks on CRCast once, to cover a different topic.  In his discussion, he pointed out some decks are slow and likely to consume most of a round's time. Playing multiple games back to back with very few breaks is not everyone's concept of ""fun"". He pointed out he liked to play faster decks even if he didn't think they'd do as well because he wanted time to relax in between games. That sounds like a reason a person might be less excited to grind out side events.  Some people like trading and don't even really play Magic competitively. Some people just like the spectacle of a huge event but are intimidated by the level of player present. The cool thing about a huge GP is it caters to all of these people in a way that FNM at a small LGS will never do.   Lately I drop prereleases for similar reasons. My FRF prerelease was on the first clear day with mild temperatures of our year. Each of my matches had gone into time rounds, and by the end of round 3 I was 4 hours in, 1-2, and hungry as heck. I'd had enough time to go to the bathroom once. The prospect of chilling with a beer in the dog park vs. spending the next 2 hours trying to go 3-2 didn't appeal to me in the least."

Instead, they give you someone else's build-pool and have you record all of the cards in that pool -- to make sure that no one is adding cards they brought from home.  Some people will open money cards in these pools that they are supposed to register for someone else and drop out of the tournament rather than pass/give up the pool. If they passed the cards they would get their own random pool to build and I'd have no problem with them dropping at that point.  Not everyone that drops with a money pool is intending to abuse the system, but some people do abuse it .. ""pay for entry, if the pool I register is good, I can ""buy"" the packs. If the pool is bad, I can pass them and get another chance at 6 different packs that might be better and play in the tournament."""

Personally, I've been winning a good amount of my last few drafts, I've probably won more than half my last 10 drafts but I still need to bring out my credit card and buy tix because I haven't been getting any rares worth anything and selling FRF packs for way less than $2 seems like such a bad deal.

MTGO is deflationary by design. the payouts are worth much more than the sticker price of the packs. The total payout in an 8 man is 12 packs while the entry fee is 2 tix/person for a total of 16 tix, which totals 1.33 tix per pack. The more packs are won in drafts vs. bought at the store the closer the real price of a pack gets to 1.33/pack.  The culprit for this deflation is the popularity of MTGO events."

Deck is nuts.  I do like the aquastrand Spider because we feel a little soft to fliers without it, and I don't want to fully rely on getting our sac engine going to remove scary fliers.  The root-kin ally fills a lot of the same role as the Overwhelm, without being in that super awkward ""i'm an overrun that makes you tap your creatures"" realm.

lrcast,386dwu,TheJediCounsel,43,Tue Jun 2 04:21:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's fine to post it here. Raredrafting is an interesting topic in limited in general, and it's mostly a calculation of how much you think your rare is worth compared with the WAR of the card you are passing.  I would have to do some pretty complicated math to figure out this particular choice, and it would be nice to have the time traveling super computer go back through this draft and figure out exactly how much money that Burst Lightning is worth. I suspect that foil Tarmogoyf is worth more, that this particular Tarmogoyf could well be worth much more, but the numbers are likely close enough due to the sheer value of potentially winning the GP and locking up a Worlds slot and Platinum.  Regarding the response of several pros, I think it's an obvious example of privilege talking. It's easy to say that you pass the Goyf when you are in the kind of financial situation where you can fly to 40 GPs a year. The majority of us, including Pascal Maynard, are not able to do that, and we have to manage our bank roll in the way that allows us to play the most Magic possible while also taking care of adult responsibilities regarding money.  Also, not all of us receive $250 at every GP as well as 3 byes to significantly increase the likelihood that we make day 2, which significantly increases the likelihood that we cash and freeroll the GP.  I'm sure that we would all love to be lucky enough to be in the kind of financial situation where we can just throw away that much money, but I know that if I were in Pascal's seat, I would have taken the Tarmogoyf, because it is the better EV calculation, and because I have two kids that I have to take care of and a difficult and draining job that doesn't pay enough."
lrcast,386dwu,oraymw,11,Tue Jun 2 04:51:10 2015 UTC,I agree with you totally. Especially when you talk about the privilege some of the higher profile names get to enjoy.

It was the kind of behavior I'd expect to see at a high school tournament, not the Pro Tour.  It feels very privileged. People who get paid to play Magic, write articles about Magic, and have people literally give them packs to draft with are complaining about how money is ruining Magic. I can't afford to draft more than once a week, and it certainly doesn't make me feel good that the people who are supposed to be my ""heroes"" think I disrespect the game any time I pick a rare that pays for my draft over a good card.  I'm confused about another thing.  When talking about being ROTTY and several other bad behaviors, it often comes up that the odds are surprisingly in favor of a single card in your deck not being drawn. I usually see any one-of maybe 2-3 times in a draft, and I've had plenty where my sweet bomb never showed up. So this forms the foundation of ""Why a deck that relies on one card is not a good deck."", with the asterisk that ""You can always build a deck that breaks a rule like that in Magic.""  Aren't the pros falling prey to this? It feels like everyone's looking at Maynard's performance and saying, ""Just think, if you'd have had that Burst Lightning it'd have been in your hand turn 1 every game and you'd have won."" This is reverse ROTTY, implying that a person lost games because of a single pick.  I feel like we've been taught to think if he had a good deck with Burst Lightning in it, he had a good deck without Burst Lightning in it. If that card was the only thing between him and being #1, then it's not true that he had a good deck, right?"
lrcast,386dwu,callmetwan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:49:07 2015 UTC,"No one is saying his pick would make or break the deck, no one is saying burst lightening would absolutely have changed things. Its just that at this level most people expect every decision to be about adding every percentage possible to help get the win, hence the issue at hand. His deck certainly would be ""better"" with burst lightning than without it."
lrcast,386dwu,Slypenslyde,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:07:37 2015 UTC,"I'm just not sure the response has been worth the action. What could've been a great object in how moneydrafting can impact your deck turned into a henfight about ethics in competitive card game tournaments.  It's not like he played ""5-Color Highest EV"". He had a competent deck that could have benefited from Burst Lightning, but made a single pick that lowered its total win rate. He still played good games of Magic and while we can't be certain it would've been significant, parading about as if that pick lost the tournament creates an image that True Pros believe Magic is not a game of skill, but a game that comes down to single decisions made outside of the context of games.  If one card can rig an entire tournament, something's very wrong."

lrcast,386dwu,mjc5077,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:04:30 2015 UTC,"It's a missplay not due to any misguided sense of honoring the game or anything like that, but due to a pure EV calculation. He's chasing both platinum and a Worlds berth. A worlds berth is guaranteed a plane ticket/hotel plus $2k for just showing. Platinum players get $3k plus plane tickets/hotels just to show at the Pro tour.  If he wasn't chasing either of those things slamming a foil goif is the right play, no question. But he's so close to getting a LOT more rewards and if he got even one more match win that what he ended up getting.   EDIT: At least, that's what he's ""apologizing"" for. Not saying I agree. In fact, I don't. burst lightning is an amazing card but I doubt if it's going to increase his win % by 5%. I wouldn't pay the price of a foil goyf, probably closer to $350, for a 5% increase in my win percentage. Besides, there's nothing more satisfying than raredrafting, then 3-0ing the pod anyway."

(https://twitter.com/OwenTweetenwald/status/605442751035891713)   The first one is an out and out personal attack, and I'm shocked that CFB would let one of their representatives act this way towards a competitor in a tournament they're holding.  The second is more personal. It's a kind of subtle ""true Scotsman"" argument and implies that Turtenwald can only see a player as professional if they would always pass the Goyf in this situation. I don't like that insinuation, and it's a bit of a slight against anyone who has ever moneydrafted.

lrcast,386dwu,dumac,3,Tue Jun 2 13:36:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, and I wouldn't have at first, but now that I think about it I think you're right from an angle I hadn't considered.  What Maynard did is understandable when ""making money"" is a strategy that can be considered valid. In terms of ""normal"" sets like DTK, there's no one card worth enough to make this kind of pick. MM2 happens to have cards that, if you take a conservative estimate of how well your games will go, can be worth more than the potential winnings of more appropriate cards.  It seems some people want competitive play to be just that: competitive play, free of any other influences. That's not wrong, but  one can't pretend that MM2 has a card that, all other things aside, is worth a significant portion of the tournament winnings. It's not cool to make a player pick between being competitive or a card that's worth a significant portion of the prize pool. Some players get paid to go to the PT, other players have to pay their own way. That means the way things are set up now, there are players that would take the foil Goyf in any scenario, even though for competitive play it is not the right choice.  There are solutions that could make it work better, having GP Top 8s be effectively phantom drafts is one way. If there were no money involved, taking foil Goyf in Maynard's seat is an unquestionably bad decision and there wouldn't be any need for discussion.   The part that bugs me is even the most optimistic of estimates claim picking the Goyf cost Maynard something like a 5% win percentage. Were the Top 8 matches less exciting because he made this pick? Did he alter the draft so dramatically that no one had any fun watching the matches? I don't think so. I'm curious just how many bad picks one would have to make to screw up the entire pod, it feels like it'd take several players in a concerted effort. I think most people would agree the only reason it affected enjoyment of the tournament is the number of pros who created a lot of noise around the pick. I think that's kind of sad, and especially concerning that several of the pros making the most noise are employees of the TO."

If nothing else there is a nicer way to disagree with someone's decision and saying they disgust you or that you've lost all respect for them is certainly not that way.

lrcast,386dwu,benikens,-6,Tue Jun 2 06:02:15 2015 UTC,"It's not about not ""making the optimal play"", it's about the fact that he knowingly took the worse card for his game.

lrcast,386dwu,pahamack,3,Tue Jun 2 13:21:54 2015 UTC,"Not to split hairs here but if he knowingly took a worse card that would be a suboptimal play. Just because you know that it wasn't the correct decision if you wanted to maximize win percentage doesn't change that it was by nature suboptimal. The reason for the suboptimal play was money which according to Pascal's response indicates that he used to continue playing magic at the GP level. A concept of raredrafting to continue to keep playing magic can't be all that foreign to some LRCast members I imagine since I care more about drafting than I do about constructed decks I'm more than happy to turn my money cards into more drafts. I'm incredibly passionate about magic myself and even though the pick didn't bother me if it did I wouldn't say that he disgusts me on any platform regardless of the fact that Pascal Maynard likely would never have seen my words. As to your final point I was bullied relentlessly as a child being told I'm disgusting by my peers, that I'm a sellout or a whore as one pro said isn't nice it was targeted anger at a single individual by a group which as I said reminds me of how I was bullied."

CFB was marketing this event pretty aggressively, raffling off some very expensive cards when people hit pre-reg numbers. They even produced a marketing video. I doubt they'd do that if they weren't making substantial profits from the GP.  The tournament scene is part of magic's marketing. I wouldn't be surprised if this is a cost to WotC rather than a profit-making opportunity. I've also heard that a lot of the product in GPs is provided by WotC as well.  If T.O.s are making insane money in GPs like this one  and not enough of it is going into prize support it's still WoTC's fault because they're the ones that regulate this sort of thing. I do know, however, that holding tournaments, in general, doesn't generate a lot of profit, and that T.O's are sometimes going into the red just to get their name out there."

What about restructuring the current prize pool so that it provides greater rewards to those at the top end? It's insane to me that you could top 8 a GP but the prize money probably won't cover your travel/hotel/entry fee. The $100 prizes extend out so far don't really do much for the people who get them other than covering entry and maybe food, if they're really frugal or eat bad food off of dollar menus. I'd rather see these prizes eliminated and the T8 made to be something of real value."

If someone like Maynard, who is vying for Worlds and platinum is making suboptimal draft choices in the top 8 of a GP, then it damns tournament payout structure, not him and not even those people who want Magic to be seen as a legitimate occupation (even though some could have been more tactful)."
lrcast,386dwu,jollyoldtime,2,Tue Jun 2 17:57:15 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand the backlash.  The question boils down to: would you pay $500 (probably more) to have burst lightning in your draft deck at a GP?  If you would, you maybe need to evaluate your skills as a player."

lrcast,386dwu,jollyoldtime,2,Tue Jun 2 13:18:57 2015 UTC,"This isn't really an accurate way of looking at it, since Maynard wouldn't literally be spending money to get the Burst Lightning. It's better to think of it as a gamble: a sure thing (foil Goyf) for a possible greater payoff (a GP title, worlds, platinum, etc.)."
lrcast,386dwu,SmallFryHero,-2,Tue Jun 2 18:01:17 2015 UTC,"I do believe they were joking.  You obviously take goyf, let's do some quick math. Foil goyf with stamp is probably around $500. Winning the GP is $4000, 2nd 2700, 3-4th 1500, 5-8 1000. He's already got $1000 no matter what, so we can say:  1st: $3000 2nd: $1700 3-4th: $500  If you think burst lighting gives him 5% better chance in any match (which is really generous, it'd probably closer to 2-3%), and otherwise he has win rate of 50%, we can then calculate the EV of burst lighting.  Here's his EV without Burst Lightning: 1st: 1/8$3000 2nd: 1/4$1700 3-4th: 1/2*$500 Total EV: $1050  Here's his EV with burst lightning: 1st: .166375$3000 2nd: .3025$1700 3rd-4th: .55*$500 Total EV: $1288.2  Hence, the added EV of burst lightning is $238.2, which is less than the value of foil goyf.  Tl;dr: He made the right pick."
lrcast,386dwu,mtg_liebestod,7,Tue Jun 2 21:18:19 2015 UTC,"Two notes:  First, you didn't calculate the EV that if he wins the GP, he gets Platinum and virtually locks up a Worlds slot.  Second, I agree that 5% is a wildly high estimation, and I would probably put it around .7-1.3%."

lrcast,3870o4,fkwillrice,2,Wed Jun 3 06:01:01 2015 UTC,"There might be a CRCast podcast on this, but there might not be. I know that at the beginning of each of those episodes they do a ""would you mulligan this hand"" kind of thing instead of a crack-a-pack. Those segments are worth listening to for the sake of hearing their reasoning.  When deciding whether or not to mulligan, every question you ask has to go back to the question of whether or not six random cards in your deck are more likely to result in a game win than the seven you're looking at. That's it. If the answer to that question is ""yes,"" you mulligan, and if not, it's ""no."" It's easy to think of the ideal hands (2 drop, 3 drop, 4 drop, 3 lands, 1 something else) and the easy-mulls (all land, no land, only 4+ drops, etc), but the ones that are harder to decide are always the borderline cases.  Instead of asking myself if the hand I'm looking at can win the game, I'll ask myself if it can get me to t5 with a strong board presence and without taking too much damage. With exceptions, I'll mulligan any hand without any 2 or 3 drops because not casting something until t4 makes you so far behind. I also consider mulligans based on the creature density of my hand - sometimes a 3 mana removal spell + a 4 drop is okay to get away with, but a 3 mana combat trick and a 4 drop is much much worse. I'm still bad at a lot of borderline cases.  I do think people should talk about ""effective mulligan"" hands. When people say this they mean they have a card in hand that they can't cast until super late game, like an Ugin in DDF/KKF or a Kozilek in mm2015. These hands are ""effectively mulligans"" because you're essentially playing with one less card than your opponent, as you're not guaranteed to hit the late game. This does make mulligan decisions easier in that you're trading an essentially mulligan'd hand for another mulligan, but often people don't take into account that you're not guaranteed to not have that Ugin in your 6 card hand, so keep in mind that you're still at risk and that the mulligan isn't free like people often say.  I always try thinking about odds. If you have a land-light hand and you want to hit lands, think about the odds of drawing one each turn; you're probably looking at 15 lands out of 33 cards, then 32, etc. Likewise, if your hand needs a 3 drop, think of the # of 3 drops as a percentage of your deck size each draw step. I know there are charts out there that show % chance of drawing a card by turn X based on # of copies of that card in your deck, if I had a link to one of those charts I'd post it but I don't. You should be comparing those percentages with the percentage chance of having 2-4 lands in your 6 card hand, having a 3 drop in your 6 card hand, etc., to know if you're improving your odds or not via mulligan.  Finally, if it's after game 1, keep your opponent's deck in mind when deciding mulligans. If you know your opponent puts on a ton of pressure, prioritize having low drops in your hand very highly. If your opponent is playing a slower, grindy deck, you can take a risk with slower starting hands and not be punished as badly for it. Also, if you won game 1, it might be easy to say ""well I only need to win one more of the next 2, so I can afford to keep riskier hands,"" but traditional strategy rules of variance-based games dictate to use less variance when ahead (take less risks) and more variance when behind (take more risks), so keep that in mind (if you don't believe me, watch some professional scrabble or poker).  Those are my thoughts, I'd love for people to tell me I'm wrong and why so that I can also improve.  Edit: I think in general people don't mull as often as they should. I tend to mull at least twice in a 4-round draft FNM. Going to 6 cards is not a death sentence on your game, and even much less so when you're on the draw; mulligans are worse for your odds when you're on the play than when you're on the draw. I've won plenty of games off of 5 card and even 4 card hands. I think the biggest thing to keep in mind is to not be afraid to mulligan. When in doubt, I tend to err on the side of mulligans."
lrcast,3870o4,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,2,Tue Jun 2 10:57:47 2015 UTC,"With a 2 land hand.... If you're on the play, you're more likely to get to three lands on turn three by mulliganing, but you run the risk of throwing away those three-drops. On the draw, the chances of getting three lands by turn three are roughly the same if you keep or mulligan, so definitely keep. Whether it's a keep on the play depends on the format and your deck, and how important getting to three mana is."
lrcast,3870o4,Sceptilesolar,2,Tue Jun 2 12:17:18 2015 UTC,"I probably don't mulligan quite often enough, but your comment that going to 6 is usually just worse than keeping 7 is kind of crazy. Even discounting hands with lopsided land/spell distribution, there are still going to be plenty of hands you just cannot keep.  I always focus on 'What does this hand need to function?' and 'What does this hand need to be awesome?' as a kind of heuristic analysis of my mulligan decision. A hand usually functions if it can cast a board-affecting spell by turn 3 (4 on the play). A hand usually is awesome if it can cast all its spells and have a good shot at winning. Depending on how much the deck asks of my draws, the hand is then judged as keep or mull.  Usually a hand that needs one common thing to function is fine; for instance, a 2 lander with 3 drops, or a top-heavy hand in a deck with a low curve overall. A hand that needs multiple common things or any uncommon things is usually a mull; for instance, a 1 lander with 3 drops or a top-heavy hand in a deck with limited early interaction.  Then we check if the hand can be awesome. If the answer is close to what the hand needs to function, it's probably a keep. If there's a big gap, like a hand that still needs to draw two further lands, that's a potential mull.  Once I mull down to 5 or lower, the only thing that really matters is if the hand can function. Standards relax.  Land-light hands are more keepable on the draw, while slow hands are less keepable."
lrcast,3870o4,bearrosaurus,2,Tue Jun 2 12:24:11 2015 UTC,"It really is a 'it depends' question. Here are two scenarios I had this weekend (MMA2 playing BW spirits)  Game 3 against a RB aggro deck, I was on the play with 4 lands and a lot of 3 drops. I mulled because I had no way to keep his bloodthirst from going out of control. I was confident I could win the late game even if I was behind on cards, I just had to survive.   Game 3 against a 4 color control deck, I had a 6 card hand on the draw with a bounceland as my 1 land, along with a wayfarer's bauble. I kept (and ended up playing nothing turn 1) because I didn't want to lose a card in a grindfest game, and I knew I wouldn't be pressured. Also, I could reach 4 mana just drawing one land, and I had gas for days (including a key Nameless Inversion).   When trying to decide mulligans, try to figure out how many dead draws you have. If you are looking at 5 lands, every land is a dead draw. If you have a 2 lander, a 6 drop is dead only if you are in a game that will end before getting 6 mana. And that will depend on your matchup."
lrcast,3870o4,bitterrootmtg,2,Tue Jun 2 16:43:53 2015 UTC,"It's a very deep topic, as deep as the game itself. I think more LR content about mulligans would be good.   Is a 2-landhand with 3 drops a mulligan or a keep?   You just can't answer questions like this in a general way. Depends on the format, depends on your deck's plan, depends on your land count, depends on your opponents' deck, depends on whether you're on the play, etc.  I once kept a hand in Scars of Mirrodin draft with 6 lands and a Wurmcoil engine. I believe this was a good keep and I won the game. But this exact hand might not have been keepable in a faster limited format, or if I had been playing an aggressive deck, or if I knew my opponent was playing a very fast deck. And certainly a six-lander with just about any other spell would have been a mulligan."

lrcast,388y47,SleepingSheeperson,2,Thu Jun 4 15:58:14 2015 UTC,The math is pretty simple. You can take the difference of the EV with the 2 win rates. The difference is nonlinear (3% difference in win rate makes a bigger difference when you're close to 50%) so you need to estimate a win rate with and without the card.  Let: x = win % y = lose % = (1-x) P3 = value of going 3-0 P2 = value of going 2-1 P1 = value of going 1-2 P0 = value of going 0-3      For swiss  EV = x3 P3 + 3x2 y P2 + 3x y2 P1 + y3 P0  For single elim  EV = x3 P3 + x2 y P2

lrcast,388y47,Eolair76,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:04:39 2015 UTC,"I hope you don't experiece your Goyfaloo with this...   I love math and I am working on a ""math your mulligan"" problem eversince I got some responses in another thread. I experience that extremely difficult and there are very few variables and only some hypergeometric distribution i have to take care of....  THIS however is a project, where I personally wouldn't even know where to start.   During a draft you most likely don't even know where your deck is going, nor do you know what your ""first hand"" will look like. Possible that you never see the card you chose over another.   Also you would have to compare every single pick in every single pack to determine ""how much difference"" it would make if you chose the card with the higher power level over the card with more money value.   What made Goyfgate ""calculable"" is the insane amount of money Goyf foil is worth - in addition to being stamped in the Top8 of the biggest Tournament ever. So taking that card over another will ""almost always"" 98 % + lead to a better outcome moneywise than any other card in the pack.   I am interested though in how you manage to get the value of the cards into a spreadsheet, i tried that for my personal card collection - Excel can't do it and ""R"" and other components of ""R"" were suggested to do that pretty good.   TL;DR: I am Pythagorian enough to believe everything can be calculated with the right forumla but I don't think the power level of a card can be set into comparison to it's money value with a prediction on how the draft would have ended with or without that card."
lrcast,388y47,mlundberg27,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:34:45 2015 UTC,"Just using the spreadsheet to improve my heuristics. Obviously I cannot possibly know an exact number of how much a single pick will increase my win%. What is mathematical fact is how much of a win % increase is needed to achieve a particular expected value increase based of various tournament structures and prize payouts.  Example. I'm drafting a DDF prize per pack queue, and the value of DTK pack is 2.75 and a FRF pack is 1.37. I can see in my spreadsheet that in order to increase my expected value by 1 tix, I need to increase my win% by say 1.3%. At some point in my draft I see a card worth 1 tix that will never make my deck and another card that will make my deck. With the spreadsheet I know that the card that will make my deck will need to increase my win % by 1.3 when compared to a replacement level 22nd-23rd card in order for me to justify taking the correct pick rather than the money card.   In a swiss draft when everyone has a 50/50 chance at winning each game, you have 12.5% chance of finishing 3-0, 37.5% chance of finishing 2-1, a 37.5% chance of finishing 1-2 and a 12.5% chance if finishing 0-3. Take the value of the prizes at each level and multiple by the chance of finishing at that level, add them all together and you get an expected value of the tournament given a win% of 50/50. I need the precise math to determine the distribution of finishes when the win percentage is not 50% and I seem to be messing it up. I also don't know if I should account for varying difficulty of opponents based on the structure of the draft. Should I depress the win% when facing 3rd round single elimination opponents? What about the 0-2 bracket in Swiss? Am I just over thinking it?"
lrcast,388y47,Snakebite7,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you'd be surprised how little a single common increases the win percentage of a deck.  It's maybe 1%."

lrcast,385sad,LexorSC2,3,Tue Jun 2 01:33:03 2015 UTC,"Agree that those are the two choices.  I'm not sure I'd go for Mage because red is a deeper and overall better color.

(Edit: Happy cake-day!)"
lrcast,385sad,sylverfyre,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:25:24 2015 UTC,"""better color"" to me just means you should have higher standards of why you're moving into that color. ""Better color"", especially in such a mature format,  means more people in the table are probably going to be in that color, and if they're picking better cards in that color than you are (which is likely because warbrute is at best the 5th best red common in the format), it's not a winning proposition. If we were talking about twin bolt, tail slash, or Sarkhan's rage, then yes, I would take those over Sandcrafter Mage. Warbrute? Not so much."
lrcast,385sad,pahamack,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:01:47 2015 UTC,It's pick one.  Better Color means the color has more early pick worthy cards and is deeper and can probably support more people at the table drafting it.  It's just a criteria used for tiebreakers and in this case failed to tip the scales.
lrcast,385sad,sylverfyre,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:52:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's the conventional way of looking at it. I'm proposing an alternative view.  Red is the best and deepest colour in DTK. Most people would take this as a positive when looking at 2 cards with roughly the same power level. I say it's a negative in a mature format. Everyone knows it's the deepest color. Your chances of not having a neighbor to your right moving into red are slim because it is so deep, even if they don't p1p1 a red card. Once the premium rares/uncommons (if there's even any in the packs) are taken the best cards are usually the removal cards and red has three while the rest have either 1 or none.  If I'm taking a red common I want one of those common removal spells, because if there's two creatures of roughly the same power level I'd rather take the non-red one.  Essentially I am taxing the deepest color at common. Because its cards are better I also expect better.  Note: again, this is only due to the format being really mature. In a new format I'd rather be in the deeper color, as pick orders aren't solidified yet, people haven't agreed yet on what colors are good, and the pick order of cards in each color."
lrcast,385sad,pahamack,9,Wed Jun 3 07:25:29 2015 UTC,Sandcrafter Mage is probably the correct pick. It's much more versatile and consistent than Warbringer which is quite mediocre outside a heavy dash deck.
lrcast,385sad,gild_for_kitten_pics,6,Tue Jun 2 01:34:38 2015 UTC,I like Sandcrafter or Warbringer.
lrcast,385sad,JimmyD101,3,Tue Jun 2 02:02:32 2015 UTC,"I'd take Sprinting Warbrute due to colour preference over white otherwise Mage is probably the single best card in a vacuum. Warbringer is tits in the dash deck but it only pays you if the colour is open AND you get dash creatures, whereas you could still end up in that deck and the Warbrute is still a good card but if you don't end up with a million dash guys Warbrute may still be in your 40."
lrcast,385sad,benikens,2,Tue Jun 2 09:39:12 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but specifically red black has to be open for the dash deck really to glow, and not all red black decks are even dash decks."
lrcast,385sad,sylverfyre,2,Tue Jun 2 14:33:08 2015 UTC,"Sandcrafter mage. It and warbrute are of similar power level but it's more likely you'll be fighting people on your right for red than for white. There's a lot of better commons in red for warbrute but there's probably only 2 better commons in white for sandcrafter mage.  Plus, sandcrafter mage, besides being an already solid curve creature, enables, especially in multiples, a draft strategy (w/x bolster) which makes low pick cards like lightcrafter into solid playables for your deck. Warbrute's just another, admittedly efficient. dude.  The way I look at it Sandcrafter mage combines the best traits of warbringer (archetype enabler) and warbrute (solid curve creature)."
lrcast,385sad,pahamack,2,Tue Jun 2 06:34:44 2015 UTC,"I ended up taking the Warbringer and being very heavy dash. All in all, very close pick. Don't think any of the three are necessarily wrong."
lrcast,385sad,Greyfeld,3,Tue Jun 2 12:50:07 2015 UTC,"I'd probably grab Warbringer.  Fact is, your only other picks are Sandcrafter Mage and Sprinting Warbrute, and neither of them are so amazing that you absolutely need to take them as a first pick.  I think that Warbringer has a high enough upside (in the case that you end up being able to draft a proper dash deck), that missing out on one of the other creatures for p1p1 is worth the risk.  Mind, this is a risky pick.  I'm not saying it's the best pick.  You'd be a lot safer, hedging yourself on one of the other two cards, and probably safest going with Sandcrafter Mage, since you'll probably have less competition in white.  But I'm of the firm belief that not picking up one of these cards on this pick won't make or break your deck, so it's worth banking on the variance working in your favor."

It relies on you having LOTS of dash creatures because the upside doesn't do very much unless you have multiples in your hand.   There are a lot of good RB decks dont have as many dash creatures as Warbringer wants you to have, and thats not considering other R/x color combinations.  I'm evaluating Warbringer as a gold archetype-specific card.   Not firstpick worthy.  (Ambuscade's dash-relevant upside is much better, IMO.  It just wants you to have ONE dash creature, so you can just turn your reckless imps into dashing dragons.)"

He's good on his own, but having that card might persuade the person to your left to go b/r dash, and just get junk red cards from you then possibly switch their draft up in the middle of pack one missing a lot of opportunity early in the pack.  Then rewarding you in pack 2.  Red is really deep in this set, and warbrute is a card I always want in any red deck, whether its g/r, b/r, or what have you.  Sandcrafter mage would be my other pick.  Its a great 3 drop, but too narrow.  You don't have to deal with a mage, but you have to answer the warbrute."
lrcast,385sad,Nizzahon,3,Tue Jun 2 04:55:18 2015 UTC,I don't see how a 3/3 for 3 is narrow. Every deck wants that. It's above the curve in this format.
lrcast,385sad,deworde,2,Tue Jun 2 07:27:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Sandcrafter Mage isn't narrow at all, he's good in any deck you play him in."

lrcast,385sad,Greyfeld,0,Tue Jun 2 08:41:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like the Arynx. But the Warbringer is a very good pick as well, as others have noted. I could see an argument made for Ojutai's Breath too."
lrcast,385mb8,Airymon,2,Tue Jun 2 00:46:29 2015 UTC,"Alloy Myr is a useless card. Dump it for the Air Servant. I probably also cut 1 Thoughtcast for the Court Homunculus, and swap a couple island for plains. Your 5th white source is going to be more useful than the 13th blue source."

lrcast,385mb8,bearrosaurus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:23:59 2015 UTC,"He's got a grand total of 2 ways to get white mana on turns one or two.  Court Homonculus is fairly useless after that, so I think it was correct not to play it.  Air Servant is quite good though."
lrcast,385mb8,Locke_Daemonfire,2,Tue Jun 2 05:06:07 2015 UTC,"He has 12 blue sources in a deck with 12 colorless cards.  We already want to cast Ethercaste on turn 2, we should consider cutting some island for plains."
lrcast,385mb8,sylverfyre,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:53:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would cut back on some thoughtcasts.  They look a lot better than they actually are - They can really hurt your tempo, especially if you draw them when you don't have 4 artifacts (which is kindof a lot.)  Imagine an opening hand with relic, thoughtcast, qumulox, enforcer, 3 lands.  It's unkeepable.  Even a hand that goes Cathodion, Relic, Thoughtcast, Myr Enforcer is extremely slow.  Kitesail is solid here - it's a cheaper artifact which helps our synergy and we do need a way to get evasive when dealing with decks like GW/GB Tokens and BW Spirits which tend to clog the ground with tokens or recursive bodies.   Meanwhile, Air servant is a dude that just takes over the game on its own, which is great when plan A gets a wrench thrown in it.  Maybe your opponent has maindeck Sundering Vitae and some removal spells and you just cant stick enough artifacts.  Air servant taps down their scariest flier and gets through a lot of damage.  -2 thoughtcast  -Alloy Myr  -3 Island (9 blue sources)  +3 Plains (6 white sources)  +Kitesail  +Air Servant  +Court Homunculus  I'm least certain about the court homunculus on only 6 white sources, but we do want to run all 3 citadels.  We have so many things that can be cast for colorless, though - we don't need 12 blue sources, especially since we want to cast our colorless cards first (since we need them for metalcraft/affinity/etc.)  I'm also really feeling a lack of equipment - Plating or Axe would be amazing, but even just Flayer Husks fill an important role in this deck."
lrcast,385mb8,sylverfyre,2,Tue Jun 2 14:38:43 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned you have far too many islands in this deck. 14 blue sources is not necessary especially since you have so many artifacts. This deck definitely does not need more than 10 blue sources. Additionally I think you should replace an island with a Dimir Aquaduct.  As for the spells, I would probably take out 2 Thoughtcasts for an Air Servant and a Court Homunculus.   Air Servant is a powerful card that threatens to take over the game even if your plan A (play a bunch of artifacts and get cheap large threats) is not working as well as you'd hoped. Court Homunculus helps plan A by adding early pressure as well as enabling Affinity as quickly as possible. Thoughtcast is nice when you have all your artifacts out but if you draw a hand with too many Thoughtcasts and Myr Enforcers, you just won't be able to keep/play magic."
lrcast,385mb8,IzDaisho,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:44:57 2015 UTC,I would cut 3 islands for 3 plains which leaves you with 9 blue sources and 6 white so you can play your Court Homunculus over Alloy Myr and Air Servant over the third Thoughtcast. Alloy Myr is essentially just an artifact grey ogre in your deck and 3 thoughtcasts is a bit too much air for my liking and I'd rather have a big evasive beater especially since you're very light on removal and plenty of decks can clog up the ground.
lrcast,3869ak,izlosst,2,Tue Jun 2 03:42:57 2015 UTC,"I would likely have built a green white deck, splashing red for the bolt and the banefire or blue for the mull drifter depending on the matchup."
lrcast,3869ak,max5470,2,Tue Jun 2 03:53:05 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I don't think your pool is very good. As far as I am concerned you have a couple of options. The first is a WUr Affinity deck (you can also go straight white/blue, but I think Lightning Bolt and Banefire are good enough to splash for). Something like this. This deck is nice and aggressive but also has the potential in longer games with Mulldrifter, Aethersnipe and Banefire. The downside is that you don't have any of the best rewards for being in Affinity like Dispatch/Rusted Relic/Qumulox.  An alternative is a 5-colour tokens deck which could look something like this. This deck is definitely harder to build as I'm not sure whether the fixing is quite there or whether the deck can support Artisan of Kozilek (I have erred on the side of 'no, it cannot')."

I prefer drafting more of the equipment and double-strike creatures with more redundancy to trying to put in more than 1-2 pump spells which can get you there fast, but are very dangerous into open mana or against removal-heavy decks.   edit: also spectral procession is broken good in the equipment deck."
lrcast,385c6x,gild_for_kitten_pics,2,Tue Jun 2 00:03:17 2015 UTC,"I keep having people draft it and it is really easy to pick apart, but it can be explosive. It's okay but far too all-in for my tastes. If it's open and the nuts are there I'd move in but I wouldn't call it broken."
lrcast,385c6x,Flannelboy2,2,Tue Jun 2 02:38:23 2015 UTC,"It also seems like it might have real issues against the tokens decks, who will happily buy time chumping your big doublestriking thing with a token while setting up to kill you."
lrcast,385c6x,sylverfyre,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:01:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that this can be a problem, but that is the reason the flying guy might be the most important creature in the deck, because he can' be that easy chump blocked (but of course his drawback is his 1 base toughness).  I guess in the end it comes down to the deck beeing open (which is probably true for most/all decks in MM2015 limited) so you can easily get the key cards like the flying double striker and the protection cards I mentioned in an earlier post..."
lrcast,385c6x,sylverfyre,2,Tue Jun 2 15:26:15 2015 UTC,Agreed.
lrcast,385c6x,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is easy to pick appart with efficient removal, but exactly the explosiveness helps a lot, because your opponents usually won't have time to find enugh removal. Add a protection spell or two and it can easily become a monster of a deck. You can also use something like mutagenic growth to protect from burst lightnings and gutshots (and 2 toughness double strikers can even survive a bolt with a growth). Another nice thing about the protection spells like blessing or journey is that stuff like arrest and narcolepsy can be dealt with even after they resolved...  It might be a bit of result orientated thinking here on my part, but with enough agressive mulligans the deck seemed perform really well consistently (you are trying to be agressive and explosive, so mulliganing is important). We had great results with the plan over the course of the sunday on side events (3-0 in 3 drafts in a row) and OKish results in day 2 (my friend went 2-1 in both drafts).  Another detail about the deck - you want some removal, but actually you can live with less removal than other decks, because you don't care to much about your opponents creatures. They shouldn't be able to race you anyway. So my friend regularly took some good equipment or the flying double striker over removal like arrest...  Though on a side note - I'll certainly pick up some more gut shots if I'm not in that deck, just to make sure I have additional removal against it (and I think gut shot is overall a bit underrated as a sideboard card)"
lrcast,385c6x,mlundberg27,2,Tue Jun 2 08:07:30 2015 UTC,"Any deck can be broken in MM2 draft. That's what makes the format great.  Personally, I prefer other strategies, but if it's open I would definitely take it."
lrcast,3861xo,LeftoverName,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:43:52 2015 UTC,"Nice deck -- here's a couple thoughts: In the final build, not sure I would have played collateral damage and war flare -- you've only got 12 creatures, so you aren't really maximizing either of them. I think adding Gore swine or screamreach brawler over collateral damage would be better in that slot, and that ups your creature count to make war flare more useful. I might even play one of those creatures over the shieldhide Dragon -- just don't ever see you getting to the point where you're flipping him face up, and you've got plenty of other things to do with your mana than play a 3/3 for 6."
lrcast,3861xo,mrcjtm,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:13:52 2015 UTC,"I agree on the collateral/creature swap, less so on cutting the dragon.  Weird things happen in games and it's good to have a fallback plan if your aggressive start doesn't go as planned.  It's worth noting that there's a Soul Summons and Rageform in there, which count as creatures.  (14 in the current build, 15 if we cut collateral for a creature.)"
lrcast,3861xo,sylverfyre,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:04:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting thoughts.  I feel like Gore swine is a bit of a liability at 3 mana when I already have so many x-1s in the 2 drop slot- having my first two creatures getting blanked by a sultai emmisary seems like a disaster in the making.  Screamreach brawler vs collateral damage is probably a more even consideration for this build, but I'm still on the side of collateral damage.  I think collateral damage got way better in DTK when removal became much cheaper and abundant- it gets to be lightning bolt a lot of the time, and is super hard to play around.  Further, burn spells get even better as you get a critical mass of them. 24 points of burn in a deck vs 21 points might seem like a small difference, but it means I don't even need to draw half of my burn spells to finish a game after 1 or 2 attacks/ turn 6 or 7.  Finally, I wanted enough 1 mana spells to improve the likelihood of playing stone hewed retainers, even if collateral damage isn't really the kind of spell you play on curve."

lrcast,382sd4,Zelytic,7,Mon Jun 1 13:10:04 2015 UTC,"Personally I get annoyed with this acronym.  I think it's an overused buzzword in this sub as a way to disagree with someone without offering any feedback.  Not all the time, but common enough.  As an example: ""I would have picked the jeskai runemark here. In an aggro (wu or UR) deck it does a lot of work to end the game."" Response: ""that sounds ROTTY to me.""  I intentionally used a controversial card (an aura) so there are already some stock reasons for not wanting it. But without offering any feedback except calling someone a Rotty, Rotter, or whatever, you aren't helping the discussion. I'd prefer not to use this acronym at all, but I can't change everyone's opinion in it. I just hope people elaborate their opinion in future threads."
lrcast,382sd4,LancesAKing,6,Mon Jun 1 13:46:28 2015 UTC,"The example you give is indeed an example of misapplying the term (though it doesn't really matter what the term is). If you had said ""it won 2 games for me so it was a good pick"", that's ROTTY (ROTTen, whatever), but saying ""I think this card will increase the win% of the deck over whatever else I could have picked"" is exactly the opposite of ROTTY (you may be wrong of course, but that's not really the point)."
lrcast,382sd4,cferejohn,2,Mon Jun 1 16:46:25 2015 UTC,"You've picked an example of someone misusing the term. But when used correctly it's a very useful shortcut for helping someone see why their reasoning is flawed.  When used correctly ""don't be ROTTY"" basically means ""don't evaluate the strength of a card based on your anecdotal experiences with it.""  This advice unpacks into two sub-themes:  (1) Your sample size, if based on just a handful of games, is too small. To see how a card truly performs you need to see how it plays in a wide variety of settings. Things like quadrant theory and pro player consensus will give you more reliable information than your anecdotal experiences.  (2) People tend to remember exciting events (""I cast Trumpet Blast and swung for 21!"") and forget boring events (""I had Trumpet Blast in hand with no creatures in play.""), meaning that swingy blowout-type cards will tend to be inflated in your mind if you rate cards based on the results you remember."
lrcast,382sd4,bitterrootmtg,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:37:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like you missed the point.  Telling someone their evaluation is wrong because their sample size is too small is not an effective way of explaining to someone how they are overvaluing a card.  We're all here to learn.  In your example, you can include that trumpet blast is a bad card to have when you're behind, if you have few creatures on board, if your deck isn't aggressive, etc, etc.  These are examples to help players properly evaluate cards.  Saying ""don't be ROTTY"" by itself pretty much says ""Your experiences are misguided, but I'll let you figure out why by yourself.""  So please everyone, don't call people ROTTY as a ""useful shortcut"". It's dismissive, and potentially rude.  Instead, refer to Results-Oriented Thinking as a trap and explain why they may be caught in it by mentioning all the times the card sucks."
lrcast,382sd4,LancesAKing,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:41:06 2015 UTC,"Obviously you shouldn't just say ""stop being ROTTY"" to someone who has no idea what the acronym means and just leave it at that. Clearly that's rude and unhelpful, but that has nothing to do with the term ""ROTTY"" specifically. The problem comes from throwing around jargon and not explaining it.  To someone who understands what ""ROTTY"" means, it's a useful shortcut for the concepts I just outlined. It saves the time of repeating concepts the person you're speaking with already knows.  Side Note: That someone is being ROTTY doesn't necessarily mean they are ""overvaluing a card."" They might be evaluating the card correctly. It means their reasoning in getting to their evaluation is flawed in a specific way. So if I say ""Overrun is a powerful card,"" that statement is correct, but if my reasoning for that statement is ""...because whenever I cast Overrun I always win the game"" then I'm being ROTTY because this is bad reasoning. Telling someone they're being ROTTY isn't a way of saying their conclusion is wrong (though it might be), it's a way of pointing out a specific type of flaw or bias in their thought process. Results oriented thinking is a bias that all humans are prone to. This makes having a shortcut term for it especially useful."
lrcast,382sd4,bitterrootmtg,4,Tue Jun 2 17:38:31 2015 UTC,"I think it accomplishes its job as-is, but you can use whatever abbreviation you want. ""Don't be ROTTY"", ""don't be ROTten"", etc. are like jingles so they're easy to remember and will stick with people once they know what is meant.  The conversation with someone who is unaware is supposed to be something like an old cheesy PSA cartoon:  [Camera fades into a schoolyard with impossibly-well-groomed children.]  JIMMY: ""Wow, when I resolved Clone Legion in two games last night, it won the game!  I'm first-picking it and forcing blue from now on!""  [There is a flash of light and crack of thunder, and HAROLD, the bear on a bicycle rides onto the playground.]  HAROLD: ""Hold on Jimmy, don't be ROTTY when evaluating card performance!""  JIMMY: ""Willikers! It's Harold, the bear on a bicycle! But what's ROTTY?  And how did you know my name?""  HAROLD: ""I know the names of all creatures with a beating heart! ""Don't be ROTTY"" means you shouldn't fall for ""Results Oriented Thinking"", a common pitfall. Now,  let's talk about your *other* four games last night...""

lrcast,381y7f,Talpostal,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:48:26 2015 UTC,"Funny story: I took Mulldrifter out of that pack, then found WG was open, opened another Overwhelming Stampede in pack 2 and took it. And yeah, small sample size and whatnot, but: I had Overwhelming Stampede in the very heavy tokens deck (two Raise the Alarm, four Scatter the Seeds, two Bestial Menace, very often getting draws that resulted in having 6+ creatures on the battlefield on turn four). And Overwhelming Stampede... underperformed.  I just didn't have enough cards that would reliably make a 3/3 or bigger creature. I would often draw it when behind on board and just sigh as it did nothing. Over the course of the draft, I think I drew it four or five times and cast it once. It was about as good as a Fortify a good portion of the time, and Fortify is not a card I was happy to have in my deck. I think people overvalue that card because when it gets cast, usually the game ends on the same turn, and it's a rare, so you'll probably see it more on the other side of the board than on your side. So people discount all the times where it's a blank even though you can cast it, which are more than I want from a five-drop. At the end of the draft, I had won more games off casting a turn three or four Fortify than off casting a turn five Overwhelming Stampede, and that's not a ringing endorsement of that card. It was more common for me to draw Overwhelming Stampede and wish it had been Bestial Menace than the other way around.  I would probably still take it highly, but I also think people are overvaluing it. I'm not sure a card with a ceiling of ""win the game"" and a floor of ""blank"" is better than a card with a ceiling of ""three-for-one"" and a floor of ""two-for-one""."

lrcast,381y7f,sylverfyre,25,Tue Jun 2 08:35:12 2015 UTC,This is a good pack but the pick is not difficult at all. Overwhelming stampede just wins the game if you have a couple creatures on the spot.

Despite the ratings given on LR and CFB, I think there is a distinct difference between game ending bombs and efficient removal/creatures. Bolt and drifter are clearly great cards but they don't finish games very often, and cards like stampede often do on the spot. I can see the cards being rated similarly but Stampede takes the torch much farther as it is rare to pick up cards that just win the game out of nowhere.  I think it might be helpful to differentiate between efficient/great creatures/removal and excellent finishers like Stampede. The card gives you a distinct game plan to win and as such is just miles better as a first pick than anything else here.  But maybe I'm wrong?"
lrcast,381y7f,Blenderhead36,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:03:23 2015 UTC,"That's overstating it a little bit. Overwhelming Stampede is, in the format, probably the best card at parity but it really misses the other quadrants. Yeah, sometimes you can pull a win out of a losing board position off the back of an Overrun effect, but that's not really guaranteed, and there are situations where that card is just a Selesnya Guildmage activation. As a double colour, somewhat archetype-bound card (I'm not sure the controlling 5-colour green decks really want this card), it also has more variance in terms of real impact in your deck relative to something like a Mulldrifter or the Bolt which is splashable, good in every deck that can make U, and good. For reference, LSV in his set review gives all three of these cards a 4.0 (And Nameless Inversion is a 3.5, though I actually think it may very well be higher).  Also if like me you're starting to suspect WB spirits is the best archetype in this format (somehow), Nameless Inversion may look super enticing just off the back of that, maybe hoping beyond hope to wheel that Moonlit Strider."
lrcast,381y7f,SkepticalPrince,9,Mon Jun 1 07:22:16 2015 UTC,"It's not really, there is so much token making in green and the set that its not difficult to get 20 damage or at least a huge amount of chumps with stampede regardless of the quadrant. It's exactly the type of card I want to first pick."
lrcast,381y7f,Sceptilesolar,3,Mon Jun 1 07:28:21 2015 UTC,It's even better as a first pick because that means you're that much more likely to have a deck where it's insane. There's also nothing else of value in green in this pack which isn't super relevant but always nice and there's a chance of weeling either the Gruul Turf or the Plagued Rusalka and if not there's always a Plummet which the green based token decks really want in their sideboard.
lrcast,381y7f,SkepticalPrince,7,Mon Jun 1 15:04:15 2015 UTC,"You're really over thinking this. It's very easy to make one of these cards win you the game instantly. Check out frank karsten's pick order article, where stampede is the 10th best first pick in the set, and above any c/uc."
lrcast,381y7f,mlundberg27,6,Mon Jun 1 14:30:05 2015 UTC,"This is correct.  However, it's worth mentioning that Overwhelming Stampede is specifically very powerful as a P1P1, since it means you can build an aggression creature-based deck (preferably with tokens) from the start."

In other formats it would easily go to bolt like, nearly every other format but here nameless inversion is incredibly strong and is a backbone of a very solid archetype.   Any soul shift gets it back and it triggers as a spirit. Not to mention the +3 part of -3 isn't always irrelevant and can serve as the three to the opponents face on behalf of moonlight strider, which coincidently gets it back if the plan backfires.   Ya dig?"
lrcast,380lxi,Zurfloo,6,Sun May 31 23:43:14 2015 UTC,"This card is like a B+ in an aggro/tempo deck. I think the best comparison we have to this creature is man-o-war. Both are 3cc, 2 power, and set the opponent back on board without actually getting a 2 for 1 (no card advantage gained).  Here's a breakdown of the differences.   Pros: You can use it on opposing creature that has a good ETB ability. You usually don't want to bounce an opponent's creature if they have some sort of positive ETB effect. You can also destroy bombs that you don't want your opponent to recast. Here, the 'destroy + draw a card' is better than 'bounce' because the bomb you're destroying is much better than the average card in their deck. Also, it's a card that both deals with a bomb creature and gives you a free 2/1 in the process. This reminds me of snapcaster mage, though definitely not as versatile nor does it give you as much card advantage. Still, it's an extremely efficient tempo play most of the time, and an extremely efficient answer to their bomb some of the time. Finally, you can kill one of your useless creatures in a board stall to try to hit a bomb.  Cons: No synergy with other creatures in your deck that have good ETB abilities. 'Destroy + draw a card' is worse than 'bounce' against tokens or Control Magic'd creatures.    More thoughts:   it reminds me of man-o-war, aven surveyor, and goblin heelcutter.  seems alright in the developing stage of the game, unless you're having a very aggressive start. Then it becomes very scary. seems great in board stalls. Kill their biggest thing or bomb, get a 2/1, they draw a card (which is probably around 40% to be a land, maybe 55% to be a card not as good as the thing you just killed). OR if they don't have anything good to kill, you kill your worst creature and try to draw towards your own bomb. seems ok when you're behind. You kill one of their attackers and get a blocker to buy you more time to deploy the things you need to stabilize.    This card seems extremely solid. Not a bomb, since it's not something that comes down and clears the board or is incredibly difficult to deal with. But solid, versatile, and very efficient."
lrcast,380lxi,swamp14,13,Mon Jun 1 01:29:31 2015 UTC,"Okay. Compare this to [[Man-o'-War]]. Man-o'-War is an extremely powerful limited card--considered by R&D to be too powerful for modern sets. It effectively ""destroys"" their creature, then ""draws"" them a card, which is always the same creature you destroyed.  Now imagine that instead of giving them back that same creature, you give them back a random card from their deck.  That's amazing. How is that not amazing?"

Yes, your opponent could draw a better creature, but they could also draw a basic land, and you're +1 creature on board to their -1.  Even in the scenario where you topdeck this late, you take out their best creature and add another body to your board, which is usually enough to enable good attacks."

In an aggressive deck, it is easy to see wanting this card. Early, you can get a blocker out of the way and get a body on the ground. Late game, you can get rid of whatever helped them stabilize and get a body on the ground.  What about an defensive deck? Early game you get rid of an attacker and give yourself a blocker.

The only black unconditional removal spells in the current draft meta are [[Reach of Shadows]] and  [[Ultimate Price]].  And they're not really unconditional, they're just treated that way because, due to the lack of common multicolor permanents and good artifact creatures in the current draft meta, they tend to almost never be dead cards.  All the other black removal is limited by attack, toughness, color, allows the opponent to choose the creature destroyed, or is some sort of combat trick that puts your own creatures on the line.  That isn't to say that any of these cards are bad.

They said they tried that card at common and while it wasnt a problem there was the potential for someone to draft a deck a critical mass of them which made games very tedious.  Being able to draft a deck with 7+ versions of W, Instant, Gain 10 life while not a winning strategy would lead to some very tedious games so it might have to be an uncommon."

To me the ideal play for a card like this is something like:  I'm W/something and have 5 creatures on board, weaker than the 4 creatures my opponent has. I have 4 mana up and 5 life, they alpha strike into me. If I block, I have no profitable trades. So I play this fictional ""gain 6 life"" card THEN something like Great Teacher's Decree, breaking their combat math and causing me to make a couple of profitable trades. THEN next turn I get to swing forlethal into their tapped out board and if something goes wrong, survive their response swing."

Feed the Clan did work for slowish Sultai decks back in KTK at 1G for 10, there's not too many feasible white strategies for it in FRF/DTK. I was thinking more in terms of M15, where Raise the Alarm, Triplicate Spirits, and Sanctified Charge presented serious potential for token strategies.  But in general if I think I can go wide with white, and my deck revolves around team pumps, it doesn't seem asking much to expect to go wide and cast a team pump. Knowing I can gain 8-10 life while doing it means I might hold back a blocker in situations where I'd feel forced to lose it, and that's +? damage on a full swing."

So I would guess A. the mana cost on a life gain spell is pretty much irrelevant as long as you can cast it before you die and B. It's format dependent, much like how Shatter can swing from a slam first pick to last pick trash.  For KtK, it would probably have to be 12+ life to be worth it, even then I'm not sure.

lrcast,380f6u,Hopelandic,3,Sun May 31 22:48:32 2015 UTC,"P1P2 - I think Sandcrafter Mage over the Butcher - I just find too many board states where the -3/-3 isn't worth losing a creature. Obviously great in a deck with multiple good exploit targets.  P1P3 - What a horrid pack, but yeah, Monument I guess.  P1P5 - I think Imp is right here, but worth noting that green seems pretty open.  P2P1 - Kolaghan's Command here. Gravecaller is really good, but the command is just better. I'm guessing you are hedging on the green, but it seems pretty likely that the people on your right ended up in green and FRF is pretty bad for green.  P2P6 - I probably take Sprinting War Brute over the Qal Sisma - drawing 2 of those is really pretty bad.  P3P2 - Definitely Polluted Delta. The 5 tix are worth more than anything else.  Draft really seemed fine to me - Green was maybe a bit more open from the right in pack 1, but I didn't see an obvious place to switch. Watching that absurd P3P2 go by was frustrating, but I don't know what you could do to prevent that other than being psychic."
lrcast,380f6u,cferejohn,2,Sun May 31 23:51:31 2015 UTC,"P1P1 - Your pick here should have been either Sprinting Warbrute or Stampeding Elk Herd.  Qal Sisma is a stronger dedication to red (with the constant mountain mana sink) than Warbrute, and Elk Herd is just one of the best green commons you're going to get.  P1P2 - Sandcrafter Mage and Silumgar Sorcerer are both way better than Silumgar Butcher.  I'd probably go with the Sandcrafter Mage.  RW isn't horrible, and if nobody else goes white, Centered Soul will wheel back around.  P1P3 - And now you would have had a chance to pick up Centered Soul anyway.  I'd probably pick it up here anyway, just because the rest of the pack is garbage and you haven't picked up any major bombs in BR to be locking into those colors.  BR tends to be pretty fast, so I don't really see a place for the monument.  P1P4 - Sprinting Warbrute is the correct pick.  If you'd gone GW, I could have made an argument for Arashin Sovereign as a big flying beater.  P1P5 - You're still not deep enough into black to pick up a mediocre card like Reckless Imp.  I'd have snagged the Aerie Bowmasters here.  P1P6 - And if you'd gone GW, you'd have the Scalelord as an windmill slam.  Even if you went RW, you could have splashed for it.  As it stands, Surge of Righteousness was the right pick, if for no other reason than hate-drafting it so it can't be sideboarded in against your deck.  P1P7 - Ugh... it hurts to see a second scalelord you can't play.  It's actually tempting to say, ""Fuck it, take it anyway, you're only 7 picks into the draft, you can switch colors still.""  Everything else here is garbage.  But Evolving Wilds isn't a horrible pick if you plan on splashing a third color.  P1P8 - More green, showing just how open the color is.  It might be too late to pick up Elk Herd now, but everything else is pretty bad.  P1P9 - Scaleguard is the best card left in this pack, but the Elk Herd's already been snapped up, which means somebody else is probably already going green.    P1P10 - Custodian is the only pick here.  p1P11 - without knowing what colors you're going to go from this point on, I'd probably grab the statue, just for some bounce-tech in the sideboard.  I can't really fault you for Shape the Sands, though, since it looks like you're wanting to switch to green.  P1P12 - Naturalize was the pick here.  There are a few enchantments floating around, and you never know when somebody is going to grab something you need to nuke off the board.  Shape the Sands isn't really that good, and having a boardable answer for unforeseen cards is always nice.  P2P1 - You aren't building an exploit deck, and you had to abandon BR a long time ago.  I could see picking up Kolaghan's Command and hoping to still go BR (or going GR and splashing black, since this is a splashable card), but the safest pick here is definitely Twin Bolt.  P3P1 - You don't have enough 2-drops to make this card worth playing.  The pick here should have been Gurmag Angler.  I'm not going to tackle the rest of your draft, because I think I've made my point.  You tried way too hard to force colors that weren't available, based on a couple early mediocre picks, and ended up having to pass major bombs because of it.  That's your biggest problem."

That is not to say that you SHOULD have taken either of those, just an unfortunate takeaway from this specific draft.  That being said it was an exceedingly difficult seat to draft. There were multiple picks that I differ on but none that I felt were too terrible. I didn't look at the decklist too much but it seems like you ended up with a pretty average deck in the end. If I at least have a deck with a good curve and some removal I'm usually happy.  I wouldn't look toward the draft as the reason you didn't end up with a good result.

I googled how to take screenshots like a grown up who know how to work computers, so I'll do that from now on. Couple notes about the deck:   The 4 left most cards with the sun glare are 2 vapor snags, brute force and a lightning bolt I didn't try to play tightly to the elemental archetype, and I feel like that worked hugely in my favor. I forgot who suggested it in the MM2 Ep, but it's great advice. Not being afraid to mix artifacts and good bloodthirst creatures was super-clutch I tried to stay open for as long as possible, picking cards that would fit any archetype/are generally good, rather than trying to settle on an archetype fast. It's advice that Frank Karsten gave in his recent CFB article on MM2 draft, and I think it's super-smart. By staying open as long as I did, I was able to pick up (and actually use) a lot of strong playables that I would have missed otherwise (Blood Ogre, Cranial Plating). I drafted with a ""plan"" like has been talked about on the show a lot recently (Aggro/tempo in this case) and I think I executed pretty well. I had a chance to play cards like Guile and Mana Leak, but passed/cut them in favor of more aggressive cards. Highlights of the deck (besides the removal and vapor snags which were obviously good) were the Blood Ogres and the Viashino Slaughterer. The first strike made them very hard to attack through, and also combo'd well with lightning bolt and nameless inversion, since I could drop an attacker/blocker's toughness low enough for first strike to finish them off. Gust Skimmer was also decent enough, but maybe I lucked out with opponents not having easy answers for it. I didn't get a chance to really play my Blinding Soul Eater. I'm not sure it was correct to play without any white sources, but I did plan on playing aggressively/racing. If you have any thoughts/comments criticisms about my deck, please let me know!"

Atarka is great, but you're already in green, and if you're already green, you pick up as many Fight cards as you can.  If you can make the raptor work with working in a few morphs, great.  But a 3/3 deathtouch for 3 is already strong enough that you don't need to pass over prime removal just to try to recur him every once in a while.  I went through the rest of your draft, and you made a lot of questionable picks.  You made some morph picks over obviously better cards, then passed up cards that would have obviously helped your morph setup when the cards up for grabs were approximately equal power.  Two that really stood out to me were the Abzan Kin-Guard on p3p5 (you have no white or black permanents, so it's just going to be a 3/3 for 4, so I would have picked up the Ainok Guide for the choice of mana fixing or an on-curve 2/2 for 2), and the Bloodfire Enforcers on p3p6 (Arashan War Beast gives you free creatures, which punishes your opponent for blocking, and it feeds directly into recurring your raptor.

lrcast,37w56t,vikhound,2,Sun May 31 06:19:37 2015 UTC,I would've been picking green cards until the Ventmaw. Confrontation is so good. And Glade Watcher and Quartermasters do work.

lrcast,37w56t,pahamack,2,Mon Jun 1 11:26:28 2015 UTC,"Ah I see the trap you fell into in this one, seeing the deathmist raptor as a build-around. I think things like that are great tie-breakers but you should pick better cards if the picks aren't close.   I could see, for example, taking Atarka efreet over a sabertooth outrider, if both cards were in the same pack, to add more cheap morphs to the deck, but i wouldn't take either card over epic confrontation. It's one of the best green cards, including rares and uncommons, and being in the same color as your first pick is a tremendous benefit."

lrcast,37w56t,dumac,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:15:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the input! Highly appreciated!  Edit: the being married part was going after the RG ferocious deck as much as about picking morphs to support the raptor. That might explain tail slash over draconic roar - setup cost is higher for tail slash, but it also represents more damage in this deck. If it gets there...   Once I understand better, I'll write up all the traps I fell into"
lrcast,37w56t,CTROWW,2,Sun May 31 13:35:02 2015 UTC,"Not only is the setup cost higher (having a creature with 3+ power), but the mana cost is also higher and it opens you up for a 2-for-1. No way is that the correct pick.  You even have a dragon for random lightning bolts to the face, if you are lucky!"
lrcast,37w56t,dumac,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:15:12 2015 UTC,"I just honestly don't understand the choice there... Do you not value Epic Confrontation at all? If this was the first pack and it had a junk rare, I'd take the Epic Confrontation."

lrcast,37w56t,cferejohn,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:26:19 2015 UTC,"P1P4: I think glade watcher is one of the better 2 drops for RG and should be picked over dragon fodder. P1P6: While neither are great, ainok artillerist suites GR better than brawler. You aren't necessarily green at this point (and you passed a ton of good green stuff to the left) but since the cards are about equal and you have the raptor and dragon already, I'd go with the artillerist.  P2P1: Tail slash over draconic roar? P2P4: I'd probably take the warbrute here. P2P5: I think you overvalue atarka efreet, as tail slash and stormcrag are both better. P2P6: Krotiq is much much better than skirmisher. P2P9: I don't know your exact spell count here, but isn't this the time where you take the morph? P3P5: Ainok guide or smoldering efreet are better picks   I don't understand your reasoning. You P1P1 a green card, but then force red? Passing epic confrontation, SRQ, and glade watcher in the first few picks? You kind of wrecked the draft trying to get tricky with your deathmist raptor.  Luckily no one was in red (because you forced it so hard?) so you wheeled good cards P2."
lrcast,37w56t,sylverfyre,0,Tue Jun 2 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"That was the right pick, but you made a few other sketch ones. P1P3 quartermasters is about the same power level as twin bolt, I would've taken it instead of going into another color. P1P4 Glade watcher is better than dragon fodder (and dragon fodder is pretty weak in RG, with no exploit and less anthem effects than in RW). P2P1 Draconic roar is much better than tail slash. There's a few other picks that are close, but those stood out to me as most likely wrong."

It's a 4 mana 4/4 with upside. 4 mana 4/4 with upside. I mean... yeah. Overwhelm sucks, especially when you have Overwhelming Stampede. Play Tukatonuge Thallid in place of Overwhelm.  Profane Command, Overwhelming Stampede, and Liege are all absurd bombs if you are in just straight BG.  Also, cut a mountain for a swamp. You have two Rampant Growths, so you just don't need that many mountains."

I am not sure how good Apocalypse Hydra is on the splash, without being able to machine gun things due to limited red mana it seems less good.  We could play the cytoplast root-kin or Sign in Blood instead.  I don't think Instill Infection is that good."
lrcast,37rmmw,sylverfyre,1 point,Sat May 30 03:25:33 2015 UTC,"I was fine with one plagued rusalka, the second just felt 'meh.' You might be right in that it would be better than instill infection though. As for the hydra, if you think of it as a 7 mana 10/10 it seems okay at least."

But I think the Groodion absolutely should be mainboarded, I mean he is definitely a late game card, but he can easily take it over since he can operate as a repeatable removal spell, and can really make combat math a pain for the opponent."
lrcast,37rmmw,Nizzahon,1 point,Sat May 30 06:49:53 2015 UTC,"The deck's power level is off the charts, your rares are insane. I think you're running maybe 1 too many mana sources with the double rampant growth and a bounceland, I would cut one growth for the cytoplast (4/4 for 4 with great upside), trade out a mountain for a swamp, and pull out overwhelm in favor of sign in blood.  I think 3 red sources (turf, mountain, one rampant growth) is enough for your late-game hydra bomb, which is definitely worth playing as a 10/10 for 7 who can ping for 1 every turn, esp in your deck that has some good ramp with nest invader and dread drone. Great deck overall though, MM rares are the real deal."

lrcast,37sl6s,mowdownjoe,2,Sat May 30 01:29:37 2015 UTC,I remember getting a p1p15 Momentary Blink as a signal that U/W was open in triple Time Spiral draft. This was nuttier.
lrcast,37sl6s,tyl110,2,Sat May 30 09:24:49 2015 UTC,"The only change I would probably make is playing a copy of Death Denied over the Tezzeret's Gambit. Denied is arcane, so it triggers your Thieves and Baku, and is better than Gambit at any point where X is 2 or greater. Gambit does have a slight edge at 3 mana, but without any real proliferate shenanigens, it just isn't enough better in the games this deck is looking to play.  Edit: as a side note, I prefer a slightly higher curve in my spirit decks, typically trying for 2 each of Moonlit Strider and [[Scuttling Death]]. Did the opportunity just not come up, or is there a strategic reason that you may have decided not to draft them?"
lrcast,37sl6s,draig01,1 point,Sat May 30 05:13:46 2015 UTC,"I saw literal zero scuttling deaths and took 1/2 strikers (the other I took my first Waxmane over)  Denied v.

It could easily be wrong, but gambit did let me keep lower land hands a couple of times."
lrcast,37sqnv,punninglinguist,3,Sat May 30 02:17:23 2015 UTC,"With 2 duals and a tri I think you man's base will be perfect to support 3 colors. I don't think its worth it to splash for the rider or crane technique and risk not being consistent. The deck looks really solid though! Only thing I would do is change the skullkeeper for the write into being. You don't have any graveyard play and your not really hurting your curve at all by playing write over it and I think write is just a much better card! That's jut my opinion though and the deck seems great either way!  Edit: I guess you do have the hooting monkeys for delve which work with the skull keeper, but with only 2 you should be able to get them out consistantly for about 4 or 5 mana without any self mill affects. And as I said below I think the prowess trigger ends up being more relevant then helping get the mandrils out."
lrcast,37sqnv,YogiBearSC2,2,Sat May 30 06:06:27 2015 UTC,"The write into being also affects the board and triggers prowess which is pretty relevant with the sage, windscout, djinn, adapt and avengers."

A lot of people are getting rid of elk herds but I honestly think the 5 drop slot is fine. It is full, but there are also no sixes or sevens in this deck. This deck simply has to get to 5 mana, which isn't hard, and any hand with a whisperer of the wilds is going to be sweet."

lrcast,37qznx,LancesAKing,5,Fri May 29 22:04:09 2015 UTC,"That is the most ridiculous pack 3 ever. Honestly, it saved you because it's where all but one of your removal spells comes from.  I would have taken out the artillery and one elk herd for a beastmaster and krotiq. it helps your curve a little and the beastmaster will provide enough card advantage with that set up. A starting hand with 2 elk herds would make me sad."
lrcast,37qznx,AestheticDeficiency,6,Fri May 29 18:37:01 2015 UTC,You're not joking about that pack 3. I want to play at a place where people pass pyrotechnics. That is fantastic.
lrcast,37qznx,dumac,1 point,Fri May 29 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be sad to see two elk herds. That makes your game plan to get to 5 and drop big fatties, which isn't that difficult to achieve."
lrcast,37qznx,garrettj100,3,Fri May 29 20:13:04 2015 UTC,"OK, OK, first thing's first:  You were in the right colors.  That said, given your embarassment of riches, I have a couple of suggestions:   Find a place for Abzan Beastmaster.  Against a lot of decks he's a one-sided Howling Mine.  I suggest shitcanning the Artillerists, which kinda suck.  They suck if you don't have many ways to add +1/+1 counters, and they still suck if you DO have ways, honestly. You're running too many Stampeding Elk Herds.  Well, really, you're running too many 5-drops, and you're not losing any of the OTHER 5-drops.  I'd probably lose an Elk Herd, and a Formless Nurturing, in favor of a Summit Prowler and a Smoldering Efreet.  Gives you a much better curve, and actually makes your remaining Formless Nurturings slightly better because you have 1 more bona fide creature to manifest.  This issue in your curve is easy to understand:  Herd's the best common 5-drop in red/green in DTK that I can think of, and going into pack 3 your 5-drop slot looked fine.  Then you got a 4cc Hunt the Weak and two 5cc Pyrokinesises (Pyrokinesises?  Pyrokineses?  Pyrokineseii?) and your curve got a bit messy.  But even though Stampeding Elk Herd's one of the best common 5-drops in DTK, your fourth one is almost certainly your worst 5-drop.   [EDIT]  By the way, I'm aware Smoldering Efreet isn't that great.  But it's a 2-drop 2/2 and it's the only one available to put in that slot to improve the curve.  If there was a second Ainok Guide or Atarka Beastbreaker I'd be suggesting that instead.  Oh, and one last thing:  For a 17 land manabase with 1 Evolving Wilds I'd have suggested 9/7/1 instead of 8/8/1.  Only 1 of your 8 two- and three-drops actually requires red.  However, the cards I suggested adding are mostly red, so at that point, if you do take those suggestions you keep the 8/8/1.  [TIDE]"
lrcast,37qznx,procumbo,1 point,Fri May 29 20:37:56 2015 UTC,"Super solid, good mana and a good mix of creatures and removal. Curve is a little top heavy.  I would do something like cut two Formless Nurturing and an Elk Herd for the Beastmaster and two Krotiqs. That gives you more to do on 3. Beastmaster isn't at its best in this deck but it's still great."
lrcast,37qznx,Spartan_Beard,1 point,Fri May 29 18:24:44 2015 UTC,2 pyrotechnics would make my day! Nice one.
lrcast,37qznx,keattsd,1 point,Fri May 29 21:10:28 2015 UTC,"Abzan Beastmaster is an incredibly strong card.  Obviously, your deck is higher power than toughness, but removing a Formless Nurturing will have a very small impact on your ability to curve out (it actually probably will help), and the Beastmaster gives you another angle of attack (card advantage), which is important in case your plan A doesn't work out."
lrcast,37qznx,cferejohn,1 point,Sat May 30 07:12:51 2015 UTC,"I'll slightly diverge from other comments and say I'd rather run the Summit Prowlers than the Segmented Krotiqs, but either are an improvement over Formless Nurturing. I'd get the Beastmaster in too. Yeah this is not the idea deck for it, but if it even draws you 1 card it's way ahead of the curve, and a 2/1 for 3, while obviously not good, is unlikely to kill you."
lrcast,37qznx,clutchest_nugget,1 point,Sat May 30 08:34:57 2015 UTC,What was your reasoning to not play Beastmaster? This really confuses me.

lrcast,37qznx,Kwoz81,1 point,Sat May 30 17:03:40 2015 UTC,I would run both prowlers over two nurturings and run beast master over the 4-1
lrcast,37qznx,dumac,-2,Mon Jun 1 08:11:34 2015 UTC,I would take out the evolving wilds and replace it with a land so you can hit your curve easier. Your only GG cards are 5 drops I would swap with a forest.  I would remove one heard and one formless nurturing for the two Krotiqs. I love the flexible option of the morph.
lrcast,37suxy,Sits_and_wonders,3,Sat May 30 02:55:26 2015 UTC,"If you're first picking Atarka's Command, you're probably only doing it because it's worth $7-8. The card is fairly unexciting in Limited, although you can fit in your deck fine and all.  You're playing some pretty weak cards in an attempt to push the aggro/dash thing, and I think it weakens your deck. You have some very good cards in your sideboard; Aerie Bowmasters, Guardian Shield-Bearer, and Hunt the Weak are all above average green cards. Meanwhile, the Screamreach Brawlers, Warbringer itself, and Collateral Damage are more aggro than your deck is really capable of sustaining.  Also, if you do want to be aggro, the mana elves aren't super appropriate. Your deck as-is doesn't have much use for the mana."
lrcast,37suxy,Sceptilesolar,1 point,Sat May 30 04:41:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I hadn't played with Atarka's Command before so I wanted to try it out in here. You're right that it wasn't very exciting, I think the only two options that I used all night were the 3 damage and +1/+1 (I think the land option would have worked too had I had a land in hand).  I do think this deck felt a little confused between whether it wanted to be aggro or formidable. I'm just getting back in to Magic and ""Having a Plan"" is definitely something that I am struggling with. Do you think for this set it's best to stick in the standard templates for the colour pairs? I'll try swapping in those green cards you suggested and see how it works! Thank you!"
lrcast,37suxy,sylverfyre,2,Sat May 30 11:31:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I think the issue here is that you were trying to build a plan around cards that aren't powerful enough to facilitate building a plan entirely around them - in this case, Atarka's Command.  It's fine, but it's not amazing, and it mostly just wants you to play creatures, going wide if possible.  You don't have to pick between ""going wide"" and ""formidable"" - they are virtually the same game plan of ""I have lots of creatures.""  Also, Atarka's Command doesn't actually synergize with Dashing, because you want to keep mana untapped during combat if you're playing it as a team-pump combat trick.  Dashing makes you want to tap out to play hasty dudes every turn."
lrcast,37suxy,sylverfyre,3,Mon Jun 1 19:07:17 2015 UTC,"Warbringer hasn't impressed me and I wouldn't have been especially excited to get it 4th.  I don't usually want to go that heavy on the dash that its ability becomes relevant.   It's a payoff card if I'm picking it up very late and I'm already in the colors, and even then it might get the cut.  We should be playing [[Aerie Bowmasters]] and [[Hunt the Weak]] in this deck.  We should probably cut Collateral Damage and something else - probably even the warbringer (4 dash creatures total, and the 2 Screamreach Brawlers arent even exceptional dash creatures that you get excited about reducing the dash cost.)  [[Ambuscade Shaman]] on the other hand, is the ""Dash Lord"" I'm very happy to build around, because it functions much better on its own or with only a LITTLE extra help, unlike the LOTS of extra help that you need for Warbringer to make it worth playing a hill giant.  With Ambuscade Shaman, every stupid reckless imp becomes a dragon.  With warbringer, you need to have multiple cards and even then they're still just 2/2s or whatever.  The likelyhood that Warbringer is just an Alesha's Vanguard here is extremely high.  Aerie Bowmasters on the other hand is one of the best green creatures and is going to be more likely to be able to attack into a messy board.  We also would like the excuse to run more forests because we have access to Whisperer of the Wilds."

I've seen a WR affinity deck that basically did everything WU affinity wants to do.  Blue can still be good when its open (It even has good straight board-affecting removal - Narcolepsy is quite good, though it has issues with specific opponents, its also one of the removal spells that doesn't care how big a thing is.)   As far as affinity goes, Somber Hoverguards have disappointed me greatly, Qumulox is good but you're not necessarily going to get one, Thoughtcast is very variable, and Faerie Mechanist is a good card advantage engine but not the most aggressive body.  So imo the only common you're really sad about giving up is Faerie Mechanist.  Red changes out your fliers for better removal to clear the way and better reach to finish off a bleeding opponent who is stabilizing the red zone before their pelakka wurms or thieves of hope shoot their life total back up."

Ended up with 3 waxmane bakus and the only cards in my deck that didn't trigger them were 2 arrests and a sign in blood. It was like having 3 copies of opposition.   Even my best U/B DTK exploit decks don't come close to how much fun it was. Not sure whether my opponents agreed as I cast the same copy of nameless inversion for the 3rd time and tapped down their ulamog's crusher yet again as I slowly beat them to death with 2/2s.

I think BW good stuff, UW affinity, GR domain, and GWx/BGx are all strong archetypes.  It really comes down to drafting the quality removal first and shifting into the open archetype later.  Forcing archetypes is a great way to train wreck."
lrcast,37r9ke,shinianx,2,Fri May 29 21:52:44 2015 UTC,"I've done 4 drafts now (UW Affinity, 5-Color, and BW Spirits twice), and I think the deck that worries me the most when I see it across the table is the red aggro deck. Those double-strikers can pile on the damage out of nowhere, and it's awful trying to sort out whether or not they actually have a pump spell. The 1/1s for 1R with doublestrike are really annoying."

lrcast,37oecx,wilydanyeah45,2,Fri May 29 04:13:24 2015 UTC,"Agree that instant speed is an improvement, but cards that reward you for keeping mana up generally fit in control decks, and control decks need ways to interact with creatures.

lrcast,37oecx,Suedars,1 point,Fri May 29 12:24:32 2015 UTC,the kinda decks that hold up 5 mana to counter spells arent looking to lava axe the opponent i dont think.

But if you're racing it can swing things in your favor (and if you're each on 1-2 turn clocks, will often swing the race more than a creature can in that time frame), and if you're on the offensive but without a quick clock (say getting in for 2 with a flyer when they're at 10ish) it can trim that clock down quite a bit to put more pressure on them.  It's still not great or anything I'd look to pick highly, but it is considerably better than regular Lava Axe."

I keep turning it over in my head but I can't think of a scenario where the card draw would turn picking Lava Axe from a bad idea to a good idea.

It is 6R to do 3 to a creature or player and draw a card, so it is way too expensive mana-wise to be of use.

Artisan is fine.  p4: Here's our first payoff for having the Agony Warp. Repeal and Grim Affliction are both solid. Let's say Repeal.  p5: Vampire Lacerator and Sickle Ripper are ok. Faerie Mechanist is quite good and passable even if you aren't Affinity. I'd take it and look for some Wayfarer Baubles if I end up playing it.  p6: Whoa, that's a late Cranial Plating. Yoink.  p7: Mana Leak.  p8: A big payoff for our p1p1 - Shadowmage Infiltrator.  p9: Unimpressive pack. Steady Progress is ok with bloodthirst and graft, though I might take Apostle's Blessing.  p10: Dispatch. Affinity definitely seems open and having a decent # of artifacts in a UWb or UBw deck is going to be pretty awesome today.  p11: Steady Progress or Ghostly Changeling. I like Changeling better. Moonlit Strider might be OK if we pick up a Nameless Inversion later or have a base in white with a Kami of Ancient Law. Strider can also help on the ground while we fly in with Plating. I'd go w/ Changeling though.  p12: Stoic Rebuttal, though not exciting.  p13: Vampire Lacerator. We may not end up with a ton of artifacts and this guy is great for the UB tempo deck.  p14: Duskhunter Bat. Well hello there - nice!  p15: Thief of Hope. Wow that's a late late thief. We could even consider BWu spirits at this point? We did get a changeling earlier, or maybe even a Moonlit Strider if I convinced you on that.  P2p1: Iona's ok but if this is Magic online it's only worth $4-5 and is likely still on the decline. I'm not sure what my rare draft cut off is. This is probably the bottom I'd consider though. Alternatively for this U/B/W deck we have a tough decision I think. Affinity (Blinding Soulater) and Spirits (Thief) were both very open, or we could stick w/ a UB Bloodthirst tempo deck (Thrummingbird.) The bird is much less exciting there than in the UG graft deck though. I guess I'd go with Souleater still leaning on an artifact heavy and/or aggressive tempo based theme. It also seems safe-ish if we do end up getting deep into Spirits though I may not play it if we go nuclear on a stack of Thief of Hopes & Waxmane Bakus.   p2p2: Tough call at this point. Do we go Rusted Relic artifact plan, Duskhunter Bat or Water Servant for the tempo beater deck (maybe I'm mis-rating if it's good there), or Restless Apparition Spirits? Tough tough call. Getting the last pick Thief is a huge signal as is that super late Cranial. At this point I think the late Cranial + Dispatch is a stronger direction so let's do that..  All I have time for at the moment.

It's definitely feasible to cast it turn 3-4 with a Nest Invader or any ramp on turns 1-2.    I'm not sold on the Kavu Primarch. If you had a sizable board state, convoking the 4 mana and paying the kicker would be cool but otherwise it's a Hill Giant.   Not a fan of Vigean Graftmage. 2/2 for 3 feels bad and although you have an okay amount of Counter enablers, I'm not sure the upside is worth it.  I'd take out the Vigean and Thrive and add Bestial Menace and Scatter the Seeds. I think I would have also tried for more Tempo plays with Vapor Snags and Repeals since you have two Aethersnipes.  I don't think Plummet or Vitae are maindeckable. butgreat sideboard options.  I think the Graft deck is a bit too much setup and dedication without the insane payoff of the other decks. If you're the only person in the Graft going draft, sure, you could possibly get there but there are a lot of moving pieces which can be tough.  I wonder if a U/R Graft with Evasive threats, Bloodthirst, Steady Progress and tempo cards could work. Goblin Fireslinger, Thrumming bird/Stormblood Berserker, Blood Ogre and Steady Progress for ridiculous combat tricks?"
lrcast,37qbjm,OKGoodbye,1 point,Fri May 29 16:06:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I think this is solid advice. I really should've put Kavu Primarch on the vanilla test, I do see now that it's maybe not the card I wanted.   I was surprised however to see that I was almost always able to play it with the kicker with convoke off of Nest Invader or Bestial Menace.   All in all there seems to be plenty of ramp in the format and Graft is maybe not powerful enough to warrant going in on counters instead of just ramping up to Pelakka Wurm and Eldrazis or going for the evasive deck you talked about."
lrcast,37qbjm,transcensionist,3,Fri May 29 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"Pelakka Wurm and Bestial Menace are powerful enough to just include them in the Graft deck. Graft is very powerful but you're missing a crucial piece in Thrummingbird. Would also like to see Mana Leak and Repeal. You're pretty close to next leveling this deck, at least in terms of your available mana base, into 4-5 color goodstuff graft. Splashing removal from add'l colors is great, especially if you can get Vengeful Rebirth or any of the other premium, splashable, uncommons. And combining Graft & Proliferate with Etched Oracle and Skyreach Manta is very powerful.  I wouldn't dismiss the Graft archetype so quickly, a good graft deck is amazing. Aquastrand Spider into Thrummingbird with Mana Leak backup is pretty ridiculous."
lrcast,37qbjm,SCNA,1 point,Fri May 29 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"I won't go over the card choices, as I agree with OKGoodbye. I'll just reiterate that graft without thrummingbird has avery low ceiling.   ended up with so many playables   I've said this before, and I'll say it again: almost every card in MM2 is playable. Therefore synergy is so much more important than in other formats. Going halfway for 2-3 (ramp, proliferate, (tokens)) archtypes will be weaker than going all in for a single one.   I believe (based on my 8-10 drafts) that the road to success in MM2 is either correctly interpreting what a archetype is most open in your seat or forcing 5-colour goodstuff ramp, since this is the only archetype which can support multiple strong versions in a single pod."
lrcast,37q8e3,corran132,9,Fri May 29 15:14:21 2015 UTC,There was another thread on this a couple days ago where deathtouch was agreed by many (including LSV) to be enough upside to make it worth it.
lrcast,37q8e3,cferejohn,5,Fri May 29 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"An important thing to note is that the reason a 1/1 with deathtouch is enough of an upside is because it trades up whereas more other 1/1s do not. Your 1/1 flyer isn't going to do much in the face of a 2/2 bear, but a 1/1 with deathtouch trades up."
lrcast,37q8e3,chimpfunkz,3,Fri May 29 17:28:17 2015 UTC,"As I said in that thread, I think the important metric is ""it does something when you draw it on turn 8"" (or late in the game in any case). The deathtoucher can trade up (or threaten to trade up). A vanilla 2/2, while not as good in that situation as a 1/1 deathtouch, can often effectively be part of a double block of a larger creature, so it's not dead."
lrcast,37q8e3,cferejohn,2,Fri May 29 22:29:37 2015 UTC,"Ah.  sorry for repeat thread, thank you."
lrcast,37q8e3,divisionbyzorro,5,Fri May 29 15:22:36 2015 UTC,"There's one other exception: Llanowar Elves. Not every deck wants these, but they are absolutely playable and sometimes very good."
lrcast,37q8e3,SinibusUSG,3,Fri May 29 17:47:32 2015 UTC,There's plenty of exceptions. The list of 1/1s for 1 with upside that have been playable throughout the years is pretty long. It's just not nearly so long as some people might think.
lrcast,37q8e3,OKGoodbye,5,Fri May 29 18:56:58 2015 UTC,"Although this is a good question, I think figuring out your own questions is an even bigger skill. Teach a man to fish.  So as far as quadrant theory goes:  Opening: Offensively, it can be okay if they don't want to trade a 2+ mana creature off. Same defensively. You get to make the trade decisions for the most part.  Parity: A 1/1 isn't going to affect the board in a huge way almost ever but the upside of deathtouch slightly offsets that as it can trade well.  Winning: Probably the least important quadrant but the rat doesn't do much here either.  Losing: I think this is where it's best suited. Once again trading a 1 drop for a good ground creature or removal spell annoys the hell out of anyone. It's  not going to do anything against fliers, first strike or trample at a certain point. It's not going to turn the game around in your favor. It will be much better than most 1/1s but that isn't saying much.  I just looked at lsvs set review on FRF and he rated it at 3 but that was FRF/KTK. In a faster format with more incentive to trade 2cmc rather than 3cmc, I feel as if it loses some value. Still a decent card which can trade up but the choice will likely be the opponents."
lrcast,37q8e3,rightseid,2,Fri May 29 15:42:33 2015 UTC,"The issue with a 1/1 is that, unlike a 2/2 the body is just not worth a full card. The ability therefore needs to make up for that, death touch allows your 1/1 to trade up (for example with your opponent's 2/2 which is worth a card) which does indeed make it worth a card."
lrcast,37q8e3,Slypenslyde,1 point,Fri May 29 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"Here's a variant of Quadrant Theory that works for understanding why a 1/1 with upside often doesn't pay off. Ask yourself: ""What's it do if I draw it on turn 1, 2, 5, and 10?"" Let's compare Typhoid Rats, Aven Skirmisher, and a random 3-drop: Champion of Arashin. (Obviously we won't talk about the 3 drop before turn 5.)  Turn 1:   Typhoid Rats tells your opponent they're not attacking profitably until it's gone. Aven Skirmisher tells your opponent they're not blocking for a few turns.   Both of these are threats, but you have to put them in perspective. No matter what your opponent plays, Typhoid Rats is going to trade. Aven Skirmisher promises a 20-turn race. Neither one's winning the game but hey, you're on the board!  Turn 2:   Typhoid Rats can attack or block, threatening to trade no matter what. 1 damage isn't very much, and your opponent only had time to play a 1 or 2 drop, so odds are you won't trade here. Aven Skirmisher can attack or block, and it's hard to imagine the opponent having reach at this point.    Neither card's very exciting at this point. They're worth 1 damage and in weird cases Typhoid Rats might deal with an opponent's 1-drop. It's hard to imagine a 1-drop that makes this a must-play scenario.  Turn 5:   Typhoid Rats is going to demand removal or trade with something, if the opponent's been taking damage they won't want to let you push 1 through or keep the rats back as a blocker.  Aven Skirmisher is still a slow clock. It's hard to block, but your opponent's likely still got 15 turns to ignore it. It might chump another early flyer, or it might be a good target for Exploit, but it's not an exciting turn 5 play. Champion of Arashin is going to trade with a lot of creatures and threaten to heal back some life you lost early. It's strong enough the opponent needs to do something to deal with it soon, and you could still have the ability to play another card after you put it on the table.   Turn 10:   Typhoid Rats is going to demand removal or trade with something if your opponent is attacking on the ground. If you're at any form of parity it makes life harder for your opponent. Unless your opponent has no way to deal with flying and is at 2 life, Aven Skirmisher's best use is as a chump block or Exploit fodder. You want threats or answers and it's neither at this phase of the game. Champion of Arashin wants respect. It's not likely to be a major player at this phase, but if your opponent deals with it via combat you're gaining 3 life. If they spend removal on it, it cleared the way for a better card. It's ground-bound, so against flyers you're sad to play it.   See how, because of deathtouch, Typhoid Rats maintained good value through the whole game? It was always as useful or more so than a 3-drop. Compare this to Aven Skirmisher: the 1 damage just isn't enough even with evasion. As the game goes later, its value plummets and its role becomes ""chump blocker for flyers"". Later in the game, that's not usually very valuable.   Pick other 1/1s with upside and walk through this same kind of exercise. Most don't pull as much weight as a 2/2 for 2 bear. There's generally only 1 turn in the game where you can't cast a 2-drop instead. Ask yourself if you're going to win many games with cards that work best on turn 1.  Sometimes the benefit of having the card on turn 1 is great enough you pick it anyway. Sometimes the upside has some kind of synergy you feel your deck can make work reliably (a 1-drop warrior in KTK could be significant). Sometimes a deck's strategy just wants very cheap creatures. This is the fun part of card evaluation. But outside of special cases, decks without 1-mana 1/1s with upside do better."

lrcast,37l5zg,mrcjtm,5,Thu May 28 13:53:38 2015 UTC,"The problem with holding up contradict here is that you sort of price yourself into contradicting them whatever their play is, even if it's relatively weak.  It's not the worst since contradict does draw you a card, but I'd rather try to build up some sort of board presence and then protect it with the contradict.  Gurmag drowner is good against what you've seen out of him just as a 2/4 even if you don't get the extra value off its exploit."
lrcast,37l5zg,seekerdarksteel,1 point,Thu May 28 19:27:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is correct. The opponent only has 4 of 5 land. Three things can happen.  Opponent plays something good - You contradict and are very happy that you 2-for-1d a good card.  Opponent plays something mediocre - You contradict and are happy. Opponent doesn't really have enough mana to play something else extremely relevant.  Opponent plays nothing - You are happy the game is going long.  Playing a creature is just playing into whatever removal the opponent has in hand, so I don't like playing the Archfiend. I'd also rather save Drowner for another turn incase I draw some exploit fodder."
lrcast,37l5zg,dumac,11,Fri May 29 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"There's no general answer to the question, unfortunately.   In the specific situation you described, it would have been smarter to play the Drowner first. You're in the control role, so your goal is to prolong the game. You're rarely going to win by beating down early. Also, your opponent never had a good chance to use removal, so you should expect that they might be holding some.  Edit: I didn't even see that you had Contradict. You definitely should have passed and held up the counter. Your opponent has no pressure on you, it's going to be a free two-for-one."
lrcast,37l5zg,bitterrootmtg,7,Thu May 28 13:39:21 2015 UTC,"They had 0 pressure on you and your hand wasn't exactly teeming with threats, so in this case I'd hold it back until you can either bait out removal or are forced to play it. You've still got lands to play and they have no board, so there's not much cost to just passing and holding up your counter."
lrcast,37l5zg,Suedars,3,Thu May 28 13:37:08 2015 UTC,"On an empty board when you have 5 lands out, why would you ever play something rather than holding up Contradict? I think like 95% of the time the correct play is to pass there."
lrcast,37l5zg,steve032,3,Thu May 28 14:22:01 2015 UTC,"First of all, a couple of notes on your decisions before this game:   I don't love some of the card choices you made in building the deck.  Most of the cards are great, but you've chosen to eschew [[Dutiful Attendant]], [[Blood-Chin Rager]], and [[Ojutai's Summons]] in favor of [[Sultai Skullkeeper]], [[Soulflayer]], and [[Will of the Naga]].  I can kind of get behind Soulflayer, (though, at best it's a 4/4 flyer - deathtouch doesn't mean much on a 4/4 flyer).  But the others just seem strictly inferior.  Why play Sultai Skullkeeper over Blood-Chin Rager?  For the mill?  You wouldn't need it if you weren't packing so much mediocre delve.  Especially Will of the Naga, which seems completely out of place. Your opening hand isn't great.  Sure, it's a keep, and you have a good curve, but you really want to see a hand with a mix of exploit creatures, and creatures that you want to exploit, like [[Shambling Goblin]], [[Jeskai Sage]], or [[Palace Familiar]].  This is another reason to bring in Dutiful Attendant.  Also keep in mind, you have three or four excellent creatures, in the [[Stratus Dancer]], the [[Archfiend of Depravity]], and [[Sidisi, Undead Vizier]].  The rest of your creatures are fairly meh.  (This isn't a criticism of your deck, it's just the inevitable reality of playing blue/black.)  In a deck where a few creatures are REALLY REALLY strong, Dutiful Attendant gets better because you get a second bite at those apples.   Anyway, I don't hate your turn 1-4 plays.  It's turn 5 I have a problem with.  Here, you said it yourself:   they trade (figuring I'm unlikely to win a race, better to prolong the game)   Turn 5 the play is play a land, pass, and blow him out with [[Contradict]] on his next play.  He can pass if he really wants to, but you have land to play on turn 6, and the longer the game goes the better for you.  Plus, he passed on turn 4 with 4 mana up.  That means one of two things:   He's got removal sitting in his hand. He's got a very expensive creature sitting in his hand.   The first bullet suggests you want to draw out that removal with a different creature.  The second suggests you want to blow him out with a Contradict.  So they're both suggesting the same thing!"
lrcast,37l5zg,garrettj100,1 point,Thu May 28 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"I wasn't too pleased with having to run Will of the Naga, but being a little light on removal I felt it was a necessary evil. I could well be wrong! Yes, I felt Skullkeeper was essential if I also wanted to include the delve cards. Will is mediocre in this deck, but Soulflayer and Angler are pretty good, no? I cut Blood-Chin because my gameplan is pretty much just to clog up the ground early on, and as such its ability isn't particularly relevant.  I think you're right about Dutiful Attendant - I just had a lot of creatures and needed to cut something and viewed the 1/2 for 3 as the weakest of the pack.  What would you take out for Dutiful Attendant and Ojutai's Summons?"
lrcast,37l5zg,garrettj100,3,Thu May 28 16:43:28 2015 UTC,"Will is mediocre in this deck, but Soulflayer and Angler are pretty good, no?   I think [[Gurmag Angler]] is excellent, and Soulflayer is meh.  If it doesn't have flying, then it's basically a [[Hooting Mandrils]] without trample, and put more delve pressure on your Angler.  No card improved more in the transition from KTK/KTK/FR to DTK//DTK/FR than Angler, precisely because there's no other strong delve cards!  When Angler is the only delve card in your deck, you don't look at it like a delve card, rather you look at it like you would a Serra Avenger.  You're not really going to be hurting for win conditions without the Soulflayer: The Blue/Black exploit deck really doesn't care that much what it wins with.  It REALLY wins by grinding the opponent down with card advantage, and the creature that it turns sideways to get the opponent's life total to zero is kind of irrelevant.  I've won by attacking 9 times with a Gurmag Drowner, (though I don't recommend that.)   What would you take out for Dutiful Attendant and Ojutai's Summons?   I would have put in the Blood-Chin, the Dutiful Attendant, and the Ojutai's Summons, and cut the Will of the Naga, the Skullkeeper, and the Soulflayer.  Improves your mana curve considerably, and while the Blood-Chin's ability is likely to not be relevant, if you just pretend it has no text it's a better blocker than the Sultai Skullkeeper:  It can eat Dragon Fodder tokens, and doesn't fold to a [[Kolaghan Aspirant]] or (gulp) an [[Atarka Efreet]], which are very real cards in the Black/Red aggressive deck, one you should be expecting in game 2.  That package also improves your exploit package by adding another creature that does something when it dies.  If you must keep the Soulflayer, (and I'd be siding it in against blue & white decks that are lousy with flyers), I'd say you don't add the Blood-Chin Rager.  Against the aforementioned blue/white deck with flyers I'd be siding it in for Dutiful Attendant, but it's really close."

It would be an 18 land deck without bouncelands.  (Also with only 10 normal lands, the threat of having an all bounceland draw is unacceptably high.)  Also, the domain cards really need actual basics and not bouncelands.  Macta Rioters should be cut (but Tribal Flames is fine at X=2.)  But aside from those complaints, you have a ton of card advantage, a ton of removal, and some very good threats in Wolfbriar Elemental (though be aware that does want tons of green mana.)  It's not a bad deck, but your manabase is incredibly risky and I'd put money that games were lost due to the mana base.

lrcast,37l07r,Gruul_and_Unusual,8,Thu May 28 11:57:48 2015 UTC,"Is this something I should concern myself with?   Yes and no. Your situation was really unfortunate, because having three consecutive players all fighting over an archetype is unusual. At least one of the drafters ought out to have moved out pretty quickly when packs dried up.  However, I think you should continue to pay attention to signals throughout the draft, and don't think about 'moving in' as a necessarily permanent thing. Hedging your bets is in general a useful thing to do, because when you take 'hedge' cards from other colours archetypes, it leaves you open for longer. A common theme is that the better you get at drafting, the more often your decks are a 6,7 or 8, rather than a 10 or a 3. This is because you get 'the nuts' less often due to hedging, but your drafts are train wrecks less often because you have hedged."
lrcast,37l07r,h0m3r,2,Thu May 28 12:20:42 2015 UTC,"I normally don't think of switching colors as a permanent move, but for affinity specifically, a lot of the cards seem ""all or nothing"".  You have a very good point about hedging, and that's certainly something I strive for, but in formats with powerfull linear strategies I find that the hedge cards are fewer or comparatively weaker."
lrcast,37l07r,h0m3r,3,Thu May 28 12:31:54 2015 UTC,"That's true, and for these highly linear decks, they do indeed rely on getting a critical mass of the right cards, which is definitely a risk to drafting them. I think you are right that for MM15 and for affinity in particular this risk is a bit higher than usual. There is simply a chance that affinity is just a high risk, high reward strategy that results in a lot of very good and very bad decks, without much in the middle."
lrcast,37l07r,Brad_Defacto,1 point,Thu May 28 13:49:02 2015 UTC,"that is a really good point about the decks being 6-8 vs 3 or 10. I defintely am still struggling with this. part of my problem is the times I have a 10, I go 3-0 and it reinforces the behaviour."
lrcast,37l07r,IzDaisho,3,Thu May 28 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"It's something that happens in drafts. But, how often have you seen 3 cards in a single color going way later than they should one after another and thought ""well the guy to my left is getting a great deck!"". Often enough they're passing it as well and it all falls to one player.  Ultimately it's a risk/reward decision as are most in magic. The reward for being the only player in a strategy is generally so much greater than the risk that someone else will notice it as well. You'll end up positive in the long run even if sometimes it doesn't work out."
lrcast,37l07r,pahamack,3,Thu May 28 12:12:35 2015 UTC,"On a related note, this is the problem when sets are too deep at common. People always complain why wizards prints bad cards, but in draft, you don't want colors to be too deep otherwise signalling gets all wonky and people end up in the same colors/archetypes as their neighbors.  I've found this to be the same problem with red in DTK where it's so deep that I basically have to tax red such that if I have to move into it it has to be for a better common than other colors, because a mid pack sabertooth outrider, for example, means absolutely nothing because people would've taken any of the removal spells over it, but a mid pack sandcrafter mage is definitely a signal, even if the two cards are the same power level.  Anyway, your early picks in pack 1 were mostly cards that are good in any deck so you could still bail in pack 2, you're only losing the picks in pack 1 that you basically got for free anyway."
lrcast,37l07r,Greyfeld,1 point,Thu May 28 16:36:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've had a number of times in red where I'll get like a pick 3 Sarkhan's Rage, or a pick 5 Sabertooth Outrider, then the red will completely dry up by the time my pack wheels back around and I have to start hunting for a new color.  I've started to feel like it's easiest to settle into two colors if I consider at least three colors in the first half dozen picks.  Alternately, I've had a couple times when I had a handful of amazing mono-color picks in my first 4-5 packs, and it left me wide open to choose my second color all the way up to pack 2."
lrcast,37l07r,benikens,2,Fri May 29 01:15:36 2015 UTC,"This exact thing happened to me in my mm draft, i think part of the problem is affinity is not actually that good unless you get the nuts so when you move in you take a bigger risk then if you were to just start speculating on a colour. With affinity its an all or nothing move, so when you shift gears you can lock your brain into being affinity without realizing shits hit the fan and you need to bail. Another problem is the signals themselves, just cause there is a bunch of artifacts doesn't mean it's open. It has to be the really good ones like a plating or something before you move in because a lot of them are very underwhelming otherwise. LSV mentioned in the modern masters episode how there's a lot less of the risk free early picks in this iteration of MM and that probably exacerbates the problem."
lrcast,37l07r,SCNA,1 point,Thu May 28 12:04:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, MM2015 affinity is probably a deck where this will be extra prevalent. I agree that many of the affinity cards are of an all or nothing nature, so it both pushes and punishes the decisions more."
lrcast,37l07r,MTGCardFetcher,2,Thu May 28 12:25:56 2015 UTC,"In a new draft format, chances are that both you and your co-drafters are considerably mis-evaluating (is that the word?) cards. This hold especially true for cards in synergy oriented archtypes like affinity. This means that trying to read signals will be much more of a challenge. You might over-evaluate [[Frogmite]] and/or the person feeding you might under-evaluate [[Thoughtcast]]. Thus you will not correctly read what is open. MM2 is a very powerful format with a high floor and all the cards in your booster is playable. In this format it is feasible to stay open much longer than in DDF. Keep hedging by taking just powerful cards longer than you otherwise would have. Though there is no absolute clear cut line between the two, a helpful tool is to try to view a synergy card as either enablers or pay off - these terms should be self-explanatory. When a powerful pay off-card like [[Lodestone Myr]] or [[Cranial Plating]] comes 6-7 pick, that is a strong signal. A stream of enablers like [[Myr Enforcer]]s and [[Tumble Magnet]]s is not, as those cards are very common and (almost always) very medium."

Namely, people mistakenly think that by extracting one of your opponent's best cards, you're at worst 1-for-1'ing your opponent.  And the big takeaway that I took from LSV and Marshal is that -- no -- you're still down on card advantage, and there's nothing to say that your opponent would have drawn that card anyways.  All you're doing is sculpting your opponent's draws, and you're giving up a card + mana in order to do it, and your opponent gives up neither cards, nor mana.    If you find yourself in a situation where it's still worth it to do the extraction (such as in your draft anecdote), then that's fine.

lrcast,37gx6q,grine,3,Wed May 27 20:50:23 2015 UTC,"It's a bit like reverse deck thinning, you're reducing the card quality in your opponent's deck, but by such a minuscule amount that it's now worth the cost you're paying (a card + mana)."
lrcast,37gx6q,SendMeBitcoins,2,Thu May 28 09:46:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it, and really, if there's only one good card in your opponent's deck...  well, it probably doesn't matter that you're extracting in that case as long as YOU have a few other good cards."
lrcast,37gx6q,Kwoz81,1 point,Thu May 28 18:37:01 2015 UTC,"Everything you just wrote! I would also assume that you are wasting one of your early picks on this card, which leads to a worse deck by giving up a solid pick/splash-able."
lrcast,37gx6q,sylverfyre,3,Fri May 29 14:30:50 2015 UTC,"Worth noting that the most recent effect of this type that LSV called totally unplayable is Surgical Extraction, which is is even worse in limited than cranial extraction.  You can't cast surgical extraction until damage has already been done (the first instance of the card is in a graveyard.)  It's only good against graveyard recursion and even then, that graveyard recursion better be worth more than having a card in your deck that literally does nothing until the graveyard recursion starts happening, and it won't even help if that recursion gets out of control before you draw your extraction.  Edit: Posted this before listening to Ep286, was thinking in context of MM2015 reviews (where surgical extraction was put in the 'unplayable' pile)  Surgical is kinda suffering from TWO traps:    the ""1 drop (kinda zero drop) that isn't worth a full card"" trap (even though it isn't technically a 1/1, it's still kinda a similar situation.) the ""Search their deck and take cards out of it"" trap."
lrcast,37gx6q,czarandy,2,Wed May 27 15:58:38 2015 UTC,Well it's certainly better against Buyback/Splice cards that remain in your hand.

lrcast,37h4jq,transcensionist,5,Wed May 27 16:22:40 2015 UTC,"Given that Profane Command is quite possibly the best limited card in the set I'd say you were right to pick it over bolt, as I would go out of my way to try to play it. As to the 23rd, I'd probably go with Cloud Elemental. A 2/3 flyer for 3 is a reasonably efficient body, but it seems fairly trivial to make it a 3/4 flyer for 3 in this deck, which is quite strong. Between Thrive and Steady Progress: the best case for both is put a counter on all of your creatures, but one draws a card to boot. The worst case is that Thrive is totally dead, and Steady Progress cycles."

Like if you had some Nest Invaders and Kozilek's Predators, that might push me towards thrive. I agree with whatthebus that Cloud Elemental should be the 23rd card, and I would probably play either Steady Progress or Apostle's Blessing if I wanted to go down to 16 lands."
lrcast,37h4jq,NerfedArsenal,2,Wed May 27 17:27:14 2015 UTC,"You don't need 18 lands with 3 Karoos. Karoos can be valued at 1.2-1.4 lands each as they provide you with a guaranteed land drop the next turn. I'd probably end up playing 16 lands max in this deck, which would easily allow us to play the Thrive and Cloud Elemental.  As insane as Profane Command usually proves itself to be, I am fine with not playing it in this deck. Picking it over Lightning Bolt is most likely correct."
lrcast,37h4jq,wrathofrath,2,Wed May 27 17:32:37 2015 UTC,"I definitely wasn't playing 18 lands. I was just debating what to include as the 23rd card.

This illustrates precisely why [[Thrive]] is considered bad.  When would you be happy casting Thrive?  When you have three creatures, all with +1/+1 counters on them?  Shit, I'd rather be casting [[Steady Progress]] for 1 less mana and get the same effect plus a card.  When you've got a [[Thrummingbird]] and 2 graft creatures?  I'd rather just attack with the Thrummingbird, and if that's not possible because it's not clear to get through, I'd rather have a removal spell.  [[Plummet]], perhaps?  There's only one situation where Thrive is not strictly inferior to Steady Progress or Plummet, where I want to put the counter on the Thrummingbird and go infinite with it.  But with a zillion graft creatures in your deck, I'm hard-pressed to imagine that situation coming up."

lrcast,37h4jq,keyboredcats,1 point,Thu May 28 16:39:33 2015 UTC,"Given that just about all your creatures already have counters anyway the synergy with Thrive and the Birds isn't even that strong.  I agree with others that Cloud Elemental is the safer pick, and a pretty good card in its own right.  If you're really trying to get counters onto your Thrummingbirds for the proliferate triggers, you can always just graft them on from your other creatures (and a Cloud elemental with a grafted +1/+1 counter is a fantastic clock).  I like Steady Progress over Thrive since you can hold up mana to threaten a mana leak / repeal (even if you don't have them in hand) and then cantrip / pump eot if you don't feel like using them.  I would probably go 16 lands and toss one of each in, even if that means your Pelakka Wurm is really tough to cast you only actually need 5 or 6 lands to get him out if you can draw your bounce lands.  Bummer about the commands, though your deck still looks great.  I probably would have tried to force black and ended up with something way worse."
lrcast,37h4jq,mlundberg27,1 point,Wed May 27 18:31:20 2015 UTC,I would play steady progress or telling time over thrive.  Cloud Elemental isn't that great without the equipment or elemental synergies and your deck is highly synergistic with counters.
lrcast,37h4jq,Greyfeld,1 point,Wed May 27 20:30:52 2015 UTC,"Last Saturday, I picked up a Thrive while piecing together a Proliferate deck.  I ran it in the first two rounds, and it often ended up rotting in my hand.  It wasn't really worth casting unless I had 2+ creatures on the board, and usually in that case I had enough board control that I could just grow my tokens naturally rather than trying to force them with Thrive.  I ended up siding it out and running a second Mana Leak."
lrcast,37h4jq,shinianx,1 point,Wed May 27 23:49:17 2015 UTC,"One of my opponents last weekend played a deck running multiple Thrives. He also played a very high creature/token spell count. In the games where he could deploy a wide army and then target them all with Thrive, it was kind of annoying, but even at its best it wasn't all that great. It would have been a lot worse if he had any way to proliferate reliably, or if he was playing multiple Graft creatures. I can see maybe playing a 1-of in the UG counters deck."
lrcast,37h4jq,Gruul_and_Unusual,1 point,Thu May 28 11:53:11 2015 UTC,"You already have so many +1/+1 counters in this deck that the Synergy between Thrive and Thrumming Bird is diminished. I like Steady Progress better.  Given your fairly low curve and light color requirements, with the exception of a single Pelakka Wurm, I'd say you could go to 16 lands. If so I'd go with Steady Progress and Telling Time. Telling time will smooth out many hands and help you find that 3rd or 4th land.  I would also pick Profane Command over Lightning Bolt."
lrcast,37icmn,sh58,3,Wed May 27 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely Arc Lightning over Utter End. Lighting only commits you to a single color, and it has to potential to get 2-for-1s.  Fiend/Falconer is a closer call. I would lean toward Fiend because of its raw power, but I wouldn't fault someone who decided to take the Falconer."
lrcast,37icmn,bitterrootmtg,2,Wed May 27 21:28:49 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree about the [[Arc Lightning]] / [[Utter End]].  It's almost impossible to project what the mana & speed of an imaginary format is going to be, but it's not unreasonable to speculate that it'd be halfway between KKF & DDF, which places it at a disadvantage, especially when you don't know if W or and B is coming in subsequent packs.  And even without considering mana, Arc Lightning might just be better."

lrcast,37icmn,MTGCardFetcher,0,Thu May 28 06:30:08 2015 UTC,"I would actually tend to disagree with Lightning over Utter End.  In 3x KTK there really weren't as many x/1s being played so Arc Lighting was usually just a 1 for 1 with their 3 drop morph. Additionally, Utter End has a strong potential to get 2 for 1s (pump spells or mid combat) or trade up in mana (3 mana for morph, 5 mana to unmorph for you 4 mana spell).  I think the most important factor is that a gold card wasn't nearly as restrictive in KTK. Firstly, you usually wanted to be in one of the five Khans so Arc Lightning is limiting you to just 3/5 where as Utter end is 2/5. Secondly, it was quite easy to splash and you are very likely to end up in either black or white.  So I don't think you're giving up too much flexibility by adding the second color and you gain a significant edge in power level."
lrcast,37icmn,IzDaisho,2,Wed May 27 22:19:03 2015 UTC,"It's not 3x KTK, though.  It's KTK-FRF-DTK."
lrcast,37icmn,ArsIgnis,1 point,Wed May 27 22:33:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the fact that it's FKD means that utter end, while having more raw power, is the worst pick since it puts you into a 2 color combo very early."
lrcast,37icmn,chimpfunkz,1 point,Thu May 28 06:16:19 2015 UTC,"Even in triple KTK I think I would lean toward Arc Lighting, though it would be closer. Utter End is only slightly more powerful and taking the less color-committing card p1p1 has real upside."
lrcast,37icmn,bitterrootmtg,3,Thu May 28 13:44:17 2015 UTC,"It's definitely Arc Lightning in the first case. You stay a lot more open because Arc Lightning is so splashable, whereas you can only play Utter End if you end up being heavily in at least one of its colours.  Necropolis Fiend and Abzan Falconer are closer I think. Personally, I'd err on the side of Necropolis Fiend. Both require a fair amount of synergy to be at their best, but it might be harder to pick up  support for the Falconer in a full block draft than it was in triple KTK or even FKK. Fiend on the other hand is likely to always get a bit of a discount whatever the format, and if you can pick up some  delve enablers it becomes very scary.  I'm honestly not sure which has the higher ceiling though."
lrcast,37icmn,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,1 point,Thu May 28 13:11:02 2015 UTC,I think there is enough bolster and megamorph running around that Falconer may be an all star in a block draft.

lrcast,37hpvi,5-s,1 point,Wed May 27 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"The good removal is very good, but some of the linear decks don't care about removal that much. I've definitely passed sunlance for synergistic cards late in the draft (in affinity for example), and have not regretted it."
lrcast,37hpvi,5-s,1 point,Wed May 27 19:07:05 2015 UTC,"So I should identify what colors to go into, pick up bombs, then premium removal, and then focus on synergies?

lrcast,37hpvi,bearrosaurus,1 point,Wed May 27 19:10:45 2015 UTC,"All those except vapor are pretty top notch. Figuring your archetype out relatively early is unfortunately pretty important compared to other sets. For example, Air servants would be an auto-include in almost any deck in other formats, but I had to cut two from my affinity draft because the affinity cards just worked better together to ensure I always had metalcraft and could cast my affinity cards cheaply. Likewise, thrummingbird is either 2-3rd pickable or close to last depending on whether someone is in U/G graft or not.

lrcast,37djfa,13012015,4,Wed May 27 16:07:47 2015 UTC,"At what point does actively refusing to draft, say, green fall under the category of forcing colors?"
lrcast,37djfa,Slypenslyde,7,Wed May 27 13:05:05 2015 UTC,"When you pass more than one card that should make you move into a color, you're forcing. They discussed this a little with the concept of a late Pacifism, but things got a little cloudy I think. Right now I feel like a lot of people are down on green, so here's an example of forcing. The key is to focus on the concept of ""future value"" that each pick implies.  You open Deathbringer Regent, then your picks are Flatten, Ojutai Interceptor, Roast, Coat with Venom.  Now P6 hits you. There's a Gudul Lurker, Defeat, and an Avatar of the Resolute. Obviously Lurker is on-color, but you should raise your eyebrow at this point. Here are two important questions:   ""What 5 cards would I pick in UB instead of Gudul Lurker or Defeat?"" ""What 5 cards would I pick in G instead of Avatar of the Resolute?""   You can answer the first one easily, these are OK cards but not high picks. It's not hard to imagine this pack having given up an Ire Shaman, Rakshasa Gravecaller, Silumgar Spell-Eater, and Death Wind before making it to you. This would be very bad for you, it'd mean the 3 people to your right are interested in UB. The number of 5-card UB combinations that are all better than these 2 are sort of high. Also note P5 produced a black combat trick as the best UB pick.  On the other hand, it's hard to imagine Avatar of the Resolute making it past 5 people with no one interested in green, or only having better picks in green. What would this require the pack to have? Maybe Rakshasa Gravecaller, Pacifism, and some Flattens? It's hard to pick 3 uncommons and 2 commons that seriously outweigh this rare without imagining a foil rare in the pack as well. Worse, as the options are considered, most of the picks are UB cards!  So at this point, you pick the green rare over the blue uncommon, even though it's not in your colors. Your bet is this rare is a signal that 5 players at the table haven't seen an interesting green card. Maybe P1 just isn't stacked for green. But you're also getting signs that someone else at the table is looking at U or B. So you take the green card and wait for more information about UB.   I've been in this seat and passed the late green rare because I was too excited about UB. Then I passed a Stampeding Elk Herd. Then I passed an Epic Confrontation. Then, in P2, I passed Surrak, the Hunt Caller, Tread Upon, Epic Confrontation, and a Den Protector. Then, in P3, I passed 3 Temur Sabertooth and a P6 Daghatar the Adamant. There was 1 GW drafter in the pod, 3 UB, 1 RB, and 1 UW. Guess who had the sickest deck, with 4 people fighting for blue and black? I was dumb for maintaining my UB line."

You don't take those cards if you aren't firmly in the archetype. ""Value"" cards (fine on their own, and maybe have a few synergies) are much stronger signals. Faerie Mechanist and Thrummingbird might be exceptions, because they're such powerful engines for their respective decks. Scatter the Seeds and Kozilek's Predator for Green/X tokens. Aethersnipe for elementals. Nameless Inversion in black.    Anyway, that's where I'm at on the format right now."

And the Waxmanes and Thief of Hopes are so undesirable for other archetypes that another Spirits drafter might be thinking they can just wheel these. Or maybe they reluctantly passed them over an Oblivion Ring, Arrest, or Pillory of the Sleepless.  To be honest I haven't figured this one out yet. I guess if you get passed one of these quality removal, a Hikari, or on color rare like Ghost Council after the 2nd pick then it might be open?   Maybe the indicator is if you can catch a Waxmane or Thief on the wheel. I don't know. I love the Spirits deck but it just seems somewhat trap-like. Because those Waxmanes and Thieves that are very good in a dedicated spirits deck are very mediocre in a deck that doesn't get to the Spirit critical mass and very unplayable in everything else."

lrcast,37emyh,mjc5077,7,Wed May 27 01:50:31 2015 UTC,"I would imagine it's a business decision. Wizards has a vested interest in getting players to purchase new product, and I would assume flashback drafts act against that in some ways, if nothing else by providing more value to older packs that are otherwise sitting unused in players' collections. On the flip side, there's a market to consider -- Wizards has to be careful with reprinting cards, which skews the market and affects the value of cards that players have invested in. Maybe more phantom drafts would answer those issues, but I think phantom drafts aren't very popular. I would also guess that the more different events available at any one time, the more diluted the player base becomes (i.e. if you had a bunch of flashback phantom drafts available, it's entirely possible they wouldn't fire, which is bad). I'm not saying I disagree with any of this -- I'm for whatever keeps the company in business -- I just think there's more involved than just Wizards having the ability to do it."
lrcast,37emyh,mrcjtm,1 point,Wed May 27 03:23:19 2015 UTC,"I think this is a very well reasoned argument, though there are a few things I think you're wrong about.  All I have is an outsiders perspective, so I actually don't really have any more substance to my ideas than you do :).  I don't think Wizards has a vested interest in getting players to purchase new product on MTGO the same way they have a vested interest IRL. Wizards has a vested interest in people putting money into MTGO no matter what they are buying with it. I don't think they care if people purchase packs or tickets, as long as people are putting money in.  I think you're totally correct that wizards has to be careful with reprinting cards and with flashback drafts. They don't want players to get frustrated when the value of their cards tank. However, I do think that WOTC is more concerned with the barrier to entry to certain formats on MTGO. I think they are more concerned with modern being too expensive to enter, than not expensive enough. It's a very special balancing act, because they don't want to lose money they can get but they also don't want people to just not invest because it costs too much.  I think there are a fair amount of people who prefer phantom drafts which is why we continue to see them . Though, I do think they sometimes pop-up when they simply don't want to deal with pricing (Look at the wacky sealeds. Instead of figuring out how to appropriately cost them I think they just make them phantom instead of risking messing up the economy. I personally would love for this to change.)  I actually think that enough people have expressed interest in a wacky draft and and ""random-card-from-the-history-of-magic"" drafts that the barrier is programming. It's clear that WOTC has the ability to do this, but they probably just can't invest the resources in doing it right now.   My guess (hope!) is that we'll see these sorts of things start to happen after we finally get leagues.  I would also guess that WOTC is also just not sure how much $$ these types of queues would garner, which makes them less likely to invest the resources at this point."

lrcast,37emyh,kccmtg,3,Wed May 27 17:23:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say they're totally unconcerned, as the secondary market provides information as to which cards are in high demand.

lrcast,37emyh,whatthebus,1 point,Wed May 27 19:41:29 2015 UTC,"I think the argument can be made either way, but reprints are determined in order to get more players playing more formats - Modern Masters, Vintage Masters, and Tempest Remastered are all trying to get more cards into the market so that Modern, Vintage, and Legacy queues fire more often.  I think Wizards is more likely to use the amount of queues firing for a given format as an indicator to put more cards into the format than how much bots are selling cards popular in the format."
lrcast,37emyh,kccmtg,2,Thu May 28 12:21:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I thought I had heard somewhere that they decided some flashback queues based on what cards needed to make it into the market.   You may be right that they are totally unconcerned, I don't remember seeing either way. My guess would just have been that they could care about secondary market on MTGO because it does affect them.

Charging the same price/phantom tickets for a, let's just say mirridon flashback phantom draft, is a bit ridiculous. The draft environment of any block is never going to match a cube draft, and most of the thrill of playing those flashbacks is to open whatever money rare is in the set. Wasteland lottery, opening cryptic command in lorwyn, swords in mirridon, etc. when you open these in phantom the thrill is just not there.

I'm not sure why occasionally having flashback and/or chaos drafts with a similar entry fee and prize structure would be any worse than putting up the cube."
lrcast,37emyh,Tebwolf359,1 point,Thu May 28 05:31:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  EV is expected value.  Your expected value of a phantom event should be about the play experience, not the card value.   Also with phantom events for mm15, they are Swiss and going 2-1 gets you another draft, so ev is still there if you want it as far as being able to pay for your drafting habit.   Another minor bonus is it could be a more pure draft, taking the best cards, not worrying about money."
lrcast,37emyh,mikerpiker,1 point,Sat May 30 01:28:27 2015 UTC,"It just depends on how much you value Phantom Points.  If what you're trying to maximize is the number of limited events you can enter, I think it makes sense to value them at around 0.6 tickets per point, since it's either 16 points or 10 tickets to enter a Phantom draft.  And at 0.6 tickets per point, the EV for Phantom events is actually really good relative to the other events (assuming you dont have a super high win rate)."
lrcast,37emyh,CelestialBeekeeper,2,Sat May 30 18:10:09 2015 UTC,I agree. Play to your medium's strength. Phantom events are a strength--you can easily let people play with boosters from old sets without having to worry about the cost of printing/selling them.
lrcast,37emyh,mikerpiker,2,Thu May 28 05:35:02 2015 UTC,"What do you guys think about this idea:  For every draft format, there are only two queues: a ""classic"" draft queue (which has the 6-2-2-2 payout structure and functions just like draft events do now) and an ""arena"" draft queue.  The ""arena"" event has a normal draft portion, but afterward you play your matches against anyone who's finished building their deck and has the same record as you, even if they didnt draft with you.  I'd play ""arena"" drafts over ""classic"" drafts.  I'm willing to give up the authentic draft experience in order to have no wait time."
lrcast,37emyh,czarandy,1 point,Sat May 30 18:27:31 2015 UTC,I think they need to reduce the number of queues for each format. We don't need to have Swiss/4-3-2-2/8-4s all the time. I think we could just have 6-2-2-2 as a good compromise for everyone. Then they could have more formats available while still allowing queues to fire.

lrcast,37c75n,no_detection,2,Tue May 26 16:15:40 2015 UTC,I think the value of 1/1 with regeneration depends on the number of playable X/1's in the format. I do agree that it's usually low.

lrcast,37c75n,cferejohn,4,Tue May 26 16:21:33 2015 UTC,"The general test to think about, I think, is, ""does this have any value if I draw it late in the game."" 2/2s aren't great in that situation, but usually there are enough situations where you can double block a 5/5 with a 4/4 and a 2/2 to make them not completely dead.  1/1 deathtouchers are very often relevant late topdecks. Lightning Berzerker is better than many 1/1s because it at least sometimes meets this test - it might let you get in a few extra points of damage for lethal that they didn't expect, and you can at least threaten to trade for a bigger creature if you leave up enough mana (which isn't ideal, but it's better than a 1/1 chump blocker).  In constructed, 1/1s can live more on their early game utility since constructed decks that run 1/1s generally don't care about whether they are any good on turn 8 because they aren't planning on getting to turn 8 (or winning many games when they do)."
lrcast,37c75n,ScaldingHotSoup,1 point,Tue May 26 16:05:46 2015 UTC,"1/1s are also usually outclassed in constructed barring extreme cases e.g. Experiment One, Warden of the First Tree, etc."

Both are relatively useless in most cases, but throw the Homunculus into an affinity deck and it becomes a 2/2 that turns on metalcraft and affinity, and the Fireslinger can turn on bloodlust without combat. Personally, I'd think both are playable mid-picks when they're in those decks, and not worth it if its just the right color. Mana dorks seem like pretty obvious choices to me too.

Then you get special one drops, things like Warden of the First Tree, which is legitimately very powerful through it's ability to scale.  So yes, there's playable 1 drops. If they trade up and you're not going to cry drawing them on turn 10, they're good enough. Alternatively if they're 2 power then they're fine, if you're playing them basically as 2 drops that happen to come in a turn early."

On the other hand, cards like Typhoid Rats is a good man to play because it takes care of pretty much any ground-based creature limited formats, so I don't think saying all 1/1s with upside are bad.

I know I will, now that I've seen this strategy.  SotS can be good for turning on early Ferocious, or enabling something like Lightwalker, but you're asking for an opening hand that has 2 specific cards in it.

lrcast,37dt2b,pahamack,2,Thu May 28 13:09:25 2015 UTC,"If I opened this pack I wouldn't think twice about passing the non-foil goyf. It's not value added at all when you get a bad reputation at your LGS for disrupting a draft because of greed. For me, sharing the bounty with the guy to my left is a happy occassion. I'm up a lot more anyway.  The only acceptable reason for disrupting a draft by buying a new replacement pack is because it's one of those stupid ""All-God"" journey into nyx packs. Those things are just disruptive and I hate their existence."
lrcast,37cf5t,PsycGirl,7,Tue May 26 16:33:53 2015 UTC,You should draft KTK FRF 6-2-2-2.  Speculating on packs is rarely the way to go.

Magic's steady growth over the last few years has pretty much meant every set is the most successful of all time now, and will be until the next Mirrodin drives half the audience away, or those drugs Blizzard's putting in the water supply kick in.  Look at Utrecht-Vegas for example, a comparable number of people opened Magic packs that weekend to the number of people who drafted Tempest over the lifetime of the entire set. I wouldn't be surprised if there are more Siege Rhinos opened since Khans came out than there were Squires printed during The Dark days. I'd certainly bet heavily that there are significantly more Cruises opened than Serum Visions.  That's not to say you couldn't get to $6 on Treasure Cruise, but I suspect it's unlikely."

lrcast,37dv4j,man_on_horse,3,Tue May 26 22:23:18 2015 UTC,KTK is the only one intended to be played alone. It's the most interesting format as there is a lot of options due to the amount of fixing. This also means it's the most complex. Depends how new the players are IMO.  KTK/FRF is strictly worse than pure KTK IMO. The bombs are silly and will decide a lot of games but you still have the complexity of lots of colours.   I don't have much experience with DTK/FRF. It's more bomb heavy than KTK but you're only playing two or three colours. This normally makes building easier but you can't always just play your best cards as weak fixing (so can be harder).  Pure DTK wasn't ever meant to be played although it's a large set so should be fine. Could be quite good fit new players as the bombs aren't as bad as FRF but still not having to play many colours.
lrcast,37dv4j,jooke,1 point,Wed May 27 17:29:03 2015 UTC,"DTK would be better than KTK for new players. KTK sealed deck building is pretty complex because of all the multicolor. That said, KTK is a sweeter format."

I'd avoid FRF, just because of the ridiculousness of all the rares (if you didn't open a bomb, you were behind).   DTK is a good choice too, but I still think KTK was more fun."
lrcast,37dv4j,chimpfunkz,1 point,Tue May 26 22:55:28 2015 UTC,"I've had good experiences with the prerelease packs for DTK, which are 1 seeded DTK pack, 4 normal DTK packs, and 1 FRF pack.

I've never done KTK sealed, but DTK sealed has my vote of confidence."

lrcast,37dv4j,mlundberg27,1 point,Tue May 26 23:04:57 2015 UTC,"KTK is more fun and less bomb-heavy, so I would recommend it as well, although it has some strategies that may not be obvious at first sight (5-color morph is a solid archetype in 6xKTK sealed For instance). Also opening Fetch-lands is always fun to a degree, although it takes a spot of a rare. I'd stay away from FRF-KTK, it was a pretty miserable sealed format IMHO. When a lot of people start playing 5-color all the rares you know something has gone wrong with the format :) I don't enjoy DTK as much because the mythic Dragons are ridiculous in limited, so anyone opening one has a big leg up on everyone else. It's a fine format otherwise."

I'm kind of biased since I was born there but it's really a nice city and there's no reason to confine yourself to the jaarbeurs all weekend. There are some rather nice places to have dinner for example and since Utrecht is a city full of students there are plenty affordable places to eat.  Protip for traveling: http://9292.nl/en# and the 9292 app will let you plan out public transport. You probably want to check at an info booth/counter for which card to get as we use Chip cards to pay for public transit and paying in cash for buses and such can get awfully expensive. Keep in mind that taxis are even more expensive, they're not a particularly common mode of transportation for Dutch people and more of a luxury thing with a price to match and while Uber exists it's not widely used as the company is still fighting laws since the practice is illegal and drivers can be fined heavily.  Here's the official info for tourists about these cards, it's rather sparse unfortunately.  Edit: oh and a lot of trains have free wifi, it's noted on the doors of the trains that have it, you'll have to accept their terms on a screen like this that also conveniently shows you info about the train you're in. It's called ""WiFi in de trein"" so you know to connect to the right one.  The city center of Utrecht also has multiple free wifi hotspots although I can't say I've used those so I can't be more specific.

When they talked about Flores' mono-blue Dragons deck, they said that the red matchup was great because he won 3-0 against mono-red in a single event.  That's such a small sample size, and it's difficult to believe that the matchup was as good as they made out.  Additionally, when they were reviewing the Dragons of Tarkir additions to standard, they spent a lot of time talking about cards that are clunky or worse, like damnable pact and risen executioner.  They talked about how those cards could be impactful and powerful, but never addressed the problems with cards, or the concessions you would have to make to play those cards.  How do you tell when they are speaking words of legitimate wisdom, and when they are brewing fantastically for the pleasure of it?

lrcast,37d4yl,tayvsickle,2,Tue May 26 19:27:24 2015 UTC,"Overall this isn't a very viable deck. I understand it's your first time and you're new to draft. In general I'd suggest focusing on creatures (about 15) & removal (up to 8) + 17 lands. You can shave a little off of the creatures and removal for 2-3 combat tricks / draw / utility spells.   If you're going to stick with MM2 draft and really want to improve, I'd start with LSV's color reviews over at Channel Fireball. Try to get a handle on the top quality cards and viable archetypes for the format. Especially read the archetype overview he provides at the top of each review.   White Blue Black Red Green Multicolor / Artifacts / Lands are yet to come      tayvsickle's first MM2 draft  Instant (9) - Too many spells, not enough guys.  1x Blades of Velis Vel - Don't play this card.  1x Brute Force - Not very good. A couple copies may be ok in a dedicated deck of double strikers. But I'd agree with LSV & Marshall here that that's not an archetype you really want to be in anyway.  1x Brute Force - ""  1x Brute Force - ""  1x Burst Lightning - Solid.  1x Fiery Fall - Solid.  1x Sylvan Bounty - Meh. Bounty is just so-so in a dedicated green deck that wants to splash into 3, 4, or 5 colors. It's pretty bad here.  1x Sylvan Bounty - ""  1x Vines of Vastwood - It's ok. But again, too many spells. Not enough guys.  Land (19) - Too many. 17 is the typical number of land for a 40 card deck.  1x Evolving Wilds  9x Forest  1x Gruul Turf  8x Mountain  Creature (9) - Not enough. Aim for 15 creatures, though some could be removal instead.  1x Alloy Myr - Very mediocre outside of a 3-5 color deck. No, still mediocre, but better there.  1x Cytoplast Root-Kin - Solid. Better in a deck with a lot of Graft (or Bloodthirst / Sunburst) creatures, but fine here.  1x Cytoplast Root-Kin - ""  1x Fulminator Mage - So-so. This wouldn't usually make the cut for me, though I would sideboard it in if the opponent shows a couple bounce lands.  1x Gnarlid Pack - So-so, fine.  1x Hearthfire Hobgoblin - Pretty bad here. A fine creature on its own but outside of a heavy red or white deck he's going to be difficult to cast, plus not that great coming down in the late game when you find the mana for him.  1x Kavu Primarch - So-so, fine.  1x Nest Invader - Good.  1x Nest Invader - Good.  Sorcery (2) - Again, too many non creature spells in this deck.  1x Rampant Growth - Pretty good. Better in a deck with more colors and a slightly higher curve. I'd definitely include it though.  1x Savage Twister - Solid.  Artifact (2) - Again, too many non creature spells in this deck.  1x Expedition Map - Meh. I wouldn't want to run this card unless I really need to search up some off color bouncelands to power up Sunburst / powerful splashes.  1x Wayfarer's Bauble - See Rampant Growth."

lrcast,37aeeh,IzDaisho,4,Tue May 26 18:03:36 2015 UTC,"I haven't found much value in the chat on MTGO.   If you win there is a good chance your opponent feels bad about the loss. Saying almost anything can be seen as rubbing in the loss and just set them off.  If you lose, most things you say will be taken as complaining about your loss. Even a comment such as ""You have a great deck"", can been interpreted as ""Wow, you only won because your deck is so amazing. You are not a better player than me, but due to your superior deck you won"". Even if you had just intentions, it's hard to convey that over the internet to someone you don't know and who doesn't know you.  When I sit down to a game of magic I expect to win. Maybe I'm in the minority but that's why I'm playing the game. The person who is standing in my way of that is a nameless, faceless entity known as the opposition. I want them to lose. I want to destroy them. It is hard to discard those feelings for the 20% of games when the opponent suddenly changes from this uninteresting creature I have dispatched (or has defeated me) into a human being trying to communicate with me.  I always strive to be polite but I definitely recognize the impulse that many players don't restrain, that results in ruined experiences like yours."

They aren't responsible for your mana screw, it's just horrible fate. If you have wonderful friends you can go vent to them, and they will listen to you and agree that fate is a horrid and fickle master, and then you can all go out some time and get drinks and talk about your war scars and stuff.

I fully admit it was not phrased as well as it could have been but I was not trying to vent. My point was that the mana screw was taking the fun out of our matches. We were both in rough shape in Game 3, and he had won Game 2 where we were both similarly missing land drops so there was really no reason for him to be salty about it.

lrcast,37aeeh,sylverfyre,5,Wed May 27 05:57:32 2015 UTC,"I wasn't condemning you, I was merely pointing out that the message that you sent to your opponent was inappropriate. If you had sent the same message to me, I would not have responded, but I would have been irritated that you seemed intent on putting the burden of commiseration on me when I do not have that responsibility. When you get unlucky, your opponent is probably sighing in relief that they managed to win the round, and sending this kind of message seems like it is only intended to make them feel guilty for being happy.  It concerns me that people might see this post and get the idea that sending frustrated messages to your opponent is acceptable, when you should really just vent your frustration to some other audience. Your complaint was that people should be nice in the chat window, but the problem is that this story started with a comment that wasn't nice.  Your opponent didn't need to call you a ""complaining piece of trash troll"" but they would have been entirely within their rights to call you out by saying that in wasn't the time nor place for such a comment. Just say ""ggs"" and be done. Or say nothing. Keep your salt to yourself."

I would agree with your points if OP was just complaining about their own mana screw, but from the story it sounds like they were both stuck on lands which is a situation I often find myself trying to laugh with my opponent about.  I agree that it's never a good idea to complain at your opponent about your own bad luck. I would also not really recommend ever complaining, but if you both are stuck on 2 lands at Turn 5, cracking a joke doesn't deserve getting your head bitten off."

It's about chatting and meeting new people who love the game.  If we have reached the point where people think that any discussion of the game is salt, and that it's not only acceptable but even ENCOURAGED behaviour to ignore everyone, I'm not sure how magic players are interacting with anyone at all."

You go to the common room and watch the game with some other people and your favorite players just aren't on their game today. If you mention to them how it sucks that your favorite players aren't doing well, what do you think is a response that society would deem civil? A. ignore them, why would you go to a social event if you wanted to talk to people? B. insult them. What sort of garbage trolls talk about sports? I'm here to use the television you idiot. C. Discuss the game. It's great to meet someone who likes the sport. D. Decline the discussion. Ugh, sorry, I don't want to talk about this right now.  If you legitimately believe that A or B is the correct behaviour, then sorry, but I would like to decline this discussion."
lrcast,37aeeh,oraymw,2,Tue May 26 09:32:31 2015 UTC,"That's not even a close analogy, why would you even bother to put it that way. If you go to a game with other people to watch, you are willingly going for the social interaction, since you always have the option of watching privately. Playing a game is much different than watching, you don't expect pro's to be cracking jokes during the Pro Tour. In the same way, I don't see a reason why ignoring people who talk in chat is particularly bad. Especially when I deem that a conversation is pointless, I'd rather not even waste my time typing."
lrcast,37aeeh,oraymw,2,Tue May 26 21:19:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for a much closer analogy, if you come up to someone during the post-match handshakes at an adult rec sports league and start complaining that ""Man, must be nice to get all the calls from the ref"", don't be shocked at all if they roll their eyes at you.

You made to clear that you felt I was in the wrong.   I also don't see where I made a personal attack against you. I said that you maybe missed part of the story, that you condemned my behavior (see quote above), I interpreted your statement in a way you disagreed with but not in a way that disparaged you personally, and I pointed out some irony. Where did I escalate into a personal attack?!   Meanwhile you implied that I'm a jerk. No you did not literally say ""You are a jerk"" which you'll use as your defense, but you implied that my behavior was unacceptable, and that people in general should not be jerks to their opponents, ergo you felt my behavior was that of a jerk. There's the personal attack."

At no point did he question your motives or your personality.  And now you are over-reacting, where it is probably correct to now question your personality as you are now engaging in a petty argument at any point you could've just looked at the completely reasonable point of view another person is making and acknowledged their point even if you don't completely agree with it.  At this point it is but right for someone to just cut the interaction with a dismissive ""K dude"", or for, someone like me, to just completely enjoy the forum drama/poor behaviour because I'm not invested in the conversation and I take entertainment when I see it. I suspect I'm not alone in this, but other people will just enjoy it anonymously.  I am now reaching for my popcorn."

No amount of regulation that is reasonable is ever going to solve that. You just have to shrug it off (it's the same way in real life too). I also think that you could've handled the situation better; your phrasing really could've come across as condescending and although I don't condone your opponent's actions I can understand his or her reaction.    Maybe better options to actually ignore someone, as in their chats stop coming through, instead of the current system where you have to manually ignore.   This is probably a good idea, especially if someone is being rude or abusive.  Other than that I don't think the chat system needs anything else. If you try and strike up a conversation and the person doesn't respond, why does it matter for what reason it was? They're obviously not going to respond either way so you should just take it a disinterest in chatting and go about your day.

Sylverfyre recommended potentially running 17 lands and perhaps that is the correct way to go with this deck.  I agree and feel like I made some greedy choices, but I wonder if the mana (or perhaps double arrest) was greedy rather than playing Cryptic.  I often saved/used it for a late game play and it always won the game for me on the spot.  The card draw from Electrolyze and Repeal really helped move this deck along to get to my more powerful plays."
lrcast,379ryq,kuaggie,5,Tue May 26 00:59:47 2015 UTC,"TL;DR -  If you didn't read any of that I don't blame you.  I also tend to skim tourney reports :P.  Here are my main takeaways:   The cheap removal in this set is format-defining.  You're playing powerful spells pretty much no matter what you do, so if you cast 2 powerful spells in a turn instead of 1 you're at  huge advantage.  This was reflected in my games- M2G1,2,3 M3G2, M6G1,2, M7G1, M8G2,3 were decided in extremely large part to 1 & 2 mana removal spells You have to ""respect the game"" in sealed more than you would in a normal sealed format.  Not having a turn 2 play against a synergy deck can often cost you the game.  Not having a turn 3 play is cause for mulligan. You're going to play against insane bombs in sealed.  Having a plan on how to beat them is critical, which is why I think I should have maindecked a vapor snag in my sealed pool over the repeal. The ground gets clogged up between recurring spirits, eldrazi and saproling tokens.  Consequently flyers are very strong in both sealed and draft.   That's all I got!  Happy to answer any questions or discuss any games you guys thought were interesting :)"

Not having a turn 2 play against a synergy deck can often cost you the game. Not having a turn 3 play is cause for mulligan.   I'm not sure I agree with that. I've found the sealed environment to be slower than any of the recent blocks - you're very unlikely to get run over early in my experience. Good players aren't playing Vampire Lacerators or Court Homunculus in sealed."
lrcast,379ryq,darrenoc,3,Tue May 26 05:42:33 2015 UTC,Good players aren't playing Vampire Lacerators or Court Homunculus in sealed.   And great players do in the corner case where it's correct.  I think these corner cases come up more often in this format since the cards are so powerful across the curve.
lrcast,379ryq,sylverfyre,2,Tue May 26 06:45:01 2015 UTC,"I meant in general. Obviously there are sealed pools that exist where it's correct to build a deck that's more synergistic than rawly powerful, but I don't think that comes up that often."
lrcast,379ryq,charliepie99,2,Tue May 26 06:56:46 2015 UTC,"Tinkering with sealed pools it seems that aggression - especially artifact-based aggression - is a very real concern.  A lot of sealed pools have over 10 solid artifacts.   I'm not saying Court Homunculus is the norm, but fast hoverguards is a very normal occurance (and getting out quick 3 power fliers is basically always good in any sealed format, this one is no exception.)   Durdly 5 color piles are not very good (though bomby 5 color piles are) and theres enough synergy cards floating around that it's a lot more likely to find yourself with enough spirits and nameless inversions to go BW, or enough artifacts to go UW, or enough ways to make the bloodthirst deck work to go RB.  Those are all decks that can get an engine going quickly and make you hurt.  (Spirits isnt going to aggro you out, but if you give it a free pass to get its engine online you're going to be on the back foot.)"
lrcast,37agnp,hubay,3,Tue May 26 04:28:37 2015 UTC,"like most things in this game... it depends? What's in your hand? how many lands are out? Do you lose tempo by bolting it? What's the board state?  If we're talking about their turn 2, and you have an untapped mountain,  I would bolt it. I'm gonna give my opponent the benefit of the doubt that they can make good use of the smokebraider mana. If they untap and cast mulldrifter you're pretty far behind."
lrcast,37agnp,pahamack,2,Tue May 26 09:34:09 2015 UTC,"depends.  Can your removal hit most of the spells he ramps in to with it?  If we're talking about actual bolt, the answer is usually no so I would probably go for it."
lrcast,37agnp,kuaggie,2,Tue May 26 06:46:45 2015 UTC,"Once the game goes long a mana dork is less valuable than a removal spell. So killing the smokebraider destroys your opponent's tempo at the cost of using a higher quality card in this 1-for-1.  Like u/kuaggie mentioned, if you have catchall removal that could also kill what your opponent is ramping into it's probably better to save it.  On the other hand, if your opponent kept a greedy hand with few lands or needs the color fixing, killing the smokebraider can strand several cards in his hand and also turn many potential draws dead. This is only really good if you have pressure on the board, since a manascrewed opponent will eventually draw into lands and start playing stuff.  So, in general, if my answers are good I'd lean towards not killing the smokebraider, if my threats are good I'd lean towards killing it."
lrcast,37agnp,Gruul_and_Unusual,1 point,Tue May 26 07:10:07 2015 UTC,Going to turn 3 and having potentially 5 mana to play with can be pretty massive tempo advantage. The thing that smoke braider plays might not be able to be bolted and then your way way behind.   But you don't know what will happen. I think if your on the draw and have a mountain untapped when they play the braider it's probably the right choice to get back parity and some tempo.  If your on the play i think it becomes dependant on your hand a little. As you might want to see if you can draw into something that can deal with the braider or whatever they might put into play.

lrcast,37a9rw,NobodysKing,6,Tue May 26 03:26:16 2015 UTC,"P1P1 - This is close, but I think I'd rather have the Ukud Cobra.  P1P2 - Even if I hadn't taken the Cobra first I'd rather have the blood chin ranger than the Pummeler.  P1P4 - Stormcrag Elemental is much better than the Lurking Arynx and you already have a red card.  P1P8 - Glade Watcher here. RG is looking like the most likely direction.  P2P3 - I'm not sure why you are taking blue cards. Misthoof Kirin is just a better card and it is in a color you are more likely to play.  P2P4 - OK, so I'm thinking one of the holes in your drafting is being to in love with the megamorph dragons. Sure, you'll play them, but you don't want to be taking them over good cards. Atarka Beastbreaker is a good card. So is Sarkhan's Rage, but given the double Pacifism I can see dropping the red in favor of white.  P2P7 - Maybe you just have to take the Herald since you've passed up a number of good 2 drops, but Bowmasters and Press the Advantage are both much better cards and a sign that Green is pretty open. I'm pretty fascinated to see how you manage to get to blue at this point.  P3P3 - Egad man. Temur Sabertooth is somewhere between ""decent creature"" and ""unstoppable bomb"" depending on the circumstances. I have to imagine you still think you are GW at this point.  P3P4 - Whisperer or maybe even Cashed Defenses. I'm just don't see any cards that you've drafted that make you want to play blue, and plenty that make you want to play green.  So yeah, I think you got lucky. You had good reasons to be Green, and even Red, and you moved into blue despite it never seeming open and never getting any particularly good blue cards. I mean, Sight Beyond Sight and Jeskai Sage are fine, but I'd rather have the Elk Herd than either of them."
lrcast,37a9rw,cferejohn,1 point,Tue May 26 04:54:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed critique, I really appreciate it! I have a habit of weighing a color that I feel is open more heavily than another color. So when I get cards later that feel like the same power, I'll pick the color that was ""more open"". Case in point here was the late illusory gains and palace familiar at p1p7 skewed my decisions later on to weigh blue cards more heavily on the chances that I'll be getting good late blue cards again. Based on your response, I seem to have a hard time evaluating green cards/big creatures (the temur sabertooth was no excuse though). Any good resources for that?"
lrcast,37a9rw,cferejohn,2,Tue May 26 20:43:09 2015 UTC,"Oh right, the Illusory Gains is a pretty good card, but it seemed like an anomaly. Also Dash means sometimes it isn't very good or you even have to side it out."
lrcast,37a9rw,dumac,1 point,Tue May 26 20:51:21 2015 UTC,"Blue was looking open from the right based on SBS and then Illusory gains + Palace familiar in pack 1. However white and green were also open from the right. That means you are likely looking to draft either UW or GW.  If you were going to go for UW, then you should have picked gudul lurker P2P1 over elk herd since they are both powerful cards in their respective decks. Also, you should have picked Kirin over Belltoll Dragon, since it is better in UW while also applicable to GW.  Blue ended up not being open from the left, while green still was. Based on this, I think you should have ended up GW. The green cards you saw were much stronger than the blue cards you saw.  You were right about W being your main color, though."
lrcast,37a9rw,sdub86,2,Tue May 26 21:43:36 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine taking Avatar of the Resolute P1P1 over Ukud Cobra, Silumgar Butcher, or even Sprinting Warbrute."

lrcast,37a9rw,Qorgi,1 point,Tue May 26 20:48:00 2015 UTC,"P1P1 - I think ukud cobra is stronger and more flexible P1P2 - Blood chin rager is the strongest card in the pack I believe, ukud cobra or not P1P3 - Descent of dragons may be the pick, but I haven't actually played with it so it is hard for me to tell. It looks really good on paper? P1P4 - Elemental is better than lurking arynx IMO P1P10 May have taken the roc here to go with the UW plan P2P3 - Kirin is a lot better then Dragon, and you seem to be leaning more towards W and U at this point. I think this is really bad pick. P2P4 - Based on the cards you've chosen, I'd prefer beastbreaker P2P7 - Bowmasters? P2P9 - I'd take surge of righteousness here P2P11 - Center soul is decent and you know you are weight, so I'd take it P3P1 - I'd consider war shaman here, but stance might still be better. Tough pick P3P3 - Sabertooth??? P3P4 - Whisperer? P3P6 - Honor's reward is quite strong P3P7 - Can't see your curve at this point, but I'd rather skycaptain over monk   I disagree with a lot of your picks.

I haven't had a chance to listen to the podcast yet, but Modern is my format of choice so I'll try to steer you in the right direction.  mtggoldfish is a great resource for this sort of thing. You'll quickly be able to download a catalog of established decklists that you can import to MTGO and use as a resource. It also shows the cost of the deck if you plan to purchase it (from mtgotraders most likely).  Cardkingdom has a Modern Gauntlet of Greatness on YouTube that is worth checking out.  Channel Fireball's YouTube channel is also awesome.  I'm going to recommend Living Twin. It's solid and inexpensive.

lrcast,37694y,czarandy,3,Mon May 25 16:09:59 2015 UTC,"I 3-0'd my first and likely only draft with an archetype that ""doesn't exist"" so I really don't have conclusive data about the format as a whole. I'll provide the information I can remember so that people can make their own judgments about my draft pod or the format in general.   I was in a 6-man pod with small enough prizes that drafting value was likely a higher priority than drafting to win. I took a P1P1 Shadowmage Infiltrator, and picked up a lot of black cards in pack 1, and by the end of the pack I was pretty firmly set into a dimir deck. I was rewarded with a pack 2 with a Profane Command. Other notable picks for pack 2 were All Is Dust and Dimir Guildmage. By pack 3, some of my colors were drying up, so I dipped lightly into the artifact suite, taking a Darksteel Axe, Fairy Machinist, Tumble Magnet, Glassdust Hulk, and Binding Souleater. These seemed like safe picks since I didn't actually need to draw a Plains to get utility out of them.  Round 1 VS Graft: I took a game 1 loss due to being overwhelmed on the board. Game 2 I sided into a more aggressive build in order to shut down Thrummingbirds with bloodthirsty Duskhunter Bats and Cloud Elementals. For game 3 I made a lot of 1-for-1 blocks, gained some card advantage, and closed it out after casting All is Dust.  Round 2 VS RG(b): It turns out that a hardcast Emrakul wins the inevitability battle, so I went very aggressive for games 2 and 3. My opponent didn't have much removal, and a Shadowmage Infiltrator with an axe creates a seriously fast clock.  Round 3 VS Mono-red: My opponent should have won this match. His aggressive cards were better than mine, and included most of the red bloohthirst creatures. If I sided into a control build, I would have been dead before I got off the ground. Fortunately, he made a lot of misplays and I ended up taking the match 2-0.  The other decks in my pool were the traditional UW artifact deck, and a 5 color good stuff deck with 6 or so karoos."

It clearly is not a bad draft format. I've enjoyed every draft so far. It almost feels hard to draft a trainwreck in this format. Even if your deck isn't the balls, it's almost always playable. Whether it's an all-time great like MMA or ISD is something that takes more than a weekend to find out, and in any case an unreasonable standard to hold them to.  EV is another question entirely. It's certainly quite possible to pay $35 for a draft, win a bunch of prize packs, and walk away with nothing more than junk rares. You really need to open a lot of packs to hit the mythics that bring the EV up to $10/pack."
lrcast,37694y,gamblekat,5,Mon May 25 06:08:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. I've quite enjoyed it so far. I've drafted 4 times--Affinity, GB sacrifice, a value oriented Grixis control and the RB aggro deck. Each feels unique and powerful in their own ways and each felt like they could have 3-0'd the pod easily. While it's not as fantastic as MM1, I think MM2, at least for myself and my playgroup, has been a reasonable success. I'm very much looking forward to Vegas this coming weekend and am working hard (joyously hard) to make sure I make the draft portion of the event.  The people who are disappointed in MM2 were either looking forward to it for the wrong reasons or are not good enough limited players to make the high price point worthwhile in terms of winnings and I think the failure on Wizards' part is improperly tempering those expectations. They let the hypetrain run off the rails and I think that was their only real mistake (aside from Long Forgotten Gohei being in the fucking set, that shit's just fucking unplayable). The fact is that this set is for a specific subset of the MtG player base and I don't think Wizards did a good enough job explaining that, instead opting for the cash grab of telling everyone with a pack of sleeves and a deckbox that there's gold in them thar hills."
lrcast,37694y,ep29,1 point,Mon May 25 17:29:51 2015 UTC,"I think this is spot on. I am a novice drafter and found MM2 to be quite a stressful set. The complexity of the cards coupled with keywords/mechanics that are not included in some of the sets I've ever seen proved quite perplexing. Whereas I tend to lose in the standard drafts and understand why I lost and where I could improve, I felt like the only thing I know after MM2 is I lost ~$60.   For those who are more experienced either in drafting or played these cards in their original sets, I can see MM2 being a treat. Unfortunately, I did not fall into either of those camps and I certainly cannot afford to learn-up at the MM2 price point the way I could at the $10 Swiss draft."

lrcast,37694y,ArsIgnis,12,Wed May 27 20:54:39 2015 UTC,"I have drafted MM15 three times so far and I enjoyed all immensely. It seems there is much more overlap between the archetypes than in the previous release. Neighboring archetypes interact much better together, so you can be flexible and try to figure out cool multicolor combinations (or at least shift gears during draft). Mana fixing is excellent, so even 5 color isn't hard to do. Even going outside of the archetypes and doing something else is viable (yesterday I placed 2nd with UR control).  Each of the three different drafts was won by three different decks (boros voltron, selesnya tokens and domain). It felt like each of the decks I played against had potential to be very dangerous. There is no dominating deck.  I didn't play against the likes of Bitterblossom or Comet Storm, but most rares while good, are answerable. There are very few straight unplayable rares.  Considering the variance in pack value, I highly recommend backdrafting the prize packs. In my experience, out of 8 packs, there are generally about two to three cards worth more than the pack itself, with one really nice card."

It costs three times as much as a regular set! Yes there is more money to open but that's always a gamble and most people will come out on the losing side of that gamble -- meaning reviewers of the set who are salty about not opening cash.   Then you have to factor in the entry fee for the draft. Anyone who opens enough cash to cover their entry might relax and enjoy but everyone else has this ramped-up set of expectations. It costs 3x as much as a regular draft, it better be the best format I've ever played in a walk! And it's not that. I don't even know what they could do to make a set 3x more fun to draft than the average decent drafting set.   This all means the reviews will be heavily skewed by outcomes. Whoever comes out with good financial value will give an honest or optimistic review. Most of the rest will give a negative review. So it's really hard to tell if the set is actually any good."

The volume of packs allows for there to be a larger amount of cards within a specific archetype available, and decks all around feel less cobbled together.

lrcast,37694y,mtg_liebestod,1 point,Mon May 25 14:30:55 2015 UTC,"It's not stupid when you are paying $10+ per pack. I wouldn't complain if Comet Storm were the only problem, but that combined with damaged cards and inconsistent print runs is too much."
lrcast,37694y,blindfremen,1 point,Tue May 26 20:38:58 2015 UTC,Being unhappy with the printing issues are fine. A mixture of stupid and okay complaints can still be okay. But we should still dismiss the stupid complaints.
lrcast,37694y,mtg_liebestod,2,Tue May 26 21:40:07 2015 UTC,"When it was releasing, before everyone had had a chance to open boxes and cases, this sub was completely flooded with ""Went 3-0 and opened cards I wanted, best set ever"" threads. There was a really diverse array of decks represented in these threads, which is a pretty good sign there's a lot for drafters to do in this set.  Do keep in mind though, for each of these threads, there were a couple of 0-3 ""didn't get anything valuable"" people who just didn't post, and a couple of 2-1s or 1-2s that didn't feel like celebrating, either. It's a shame they didn't post, it'd be nice to see discussions about how to correct bad drafts, identify bad beats, and avoid traps alongside celebrations of obviously good decks.  I haven't drafted because $50 is too rich an entry fee for me, but everyone I know who has had a lot of fun. There's grumbling and grousing about nicked cards, but it's not so loud from the people who did well."
lrcast,37694y,Slypenslyde,5,Mon May 25 14:33:11 2015 UTC,"I've drafted about 15 times online.  No, I think the draft format is very average and certainly does not justify the cost or baggage.  INN/ROE/MMA/KTK are all better draft sets.  I'm looking forward to MM2015 leaving.  Right now I feel like it's getting forced down my throat with the MOCS competitions and Grand Prix.  Hopefully they did a better job on Magic Origins.  Looking forward to the future."
lrcast,37694y,mlundberg27,4,Mon May 25 06:39:53 2015 UTC,"Hopefully they did a better job on Magic Origins   I am really looking forward to Origins. Core Sets have always been a way to recover from Third Set Fatigue (for me) and the story approach for Origins is intriguing. I've stopped playing DTK and had no interest in Tempest or MM2015, so as soon as Origins prerelease  hits, I'm hoping for some great, enjoyable Magic."
lrcast,37694y,ryebr3ad,5,Mon May 25 07:13:23 2015 UTC,"Anyone saying this draft set is ""linear,"" ""simple"" or ""on rails"" is definitely wrong. This draft format is complex, challenging, balanced, diverse, and extremely fun.  I think people are projecting their disappointment with other aspects of the set: the print quality, the price, the availability. I am disappointed in those aspects as well, but have nothing bad to say about the format itself.  I also think a lot of people are hating on the format because it's extremely difficult and they are losing. There are tons of decisions with drafting, deck building, and play that are not obvious. I am one of those players; I've been losing a ton. But that complexity to me is really fascinating and rewarding."
lrcast,37694y,ryebr3ad,2,Mon May 25 15:47:00 2015 UTC,"This draft format is complex, challenging, balanced, diverse, and extremely fun.   All subjective -- but you know that, of course.  If people are pissed off that they paid $30 (or more) for a draft experience they feel is equivalent to a $12 draft, then we can't fault them for that."
lrcast,37694y,ryebr3ad,4,Mon May 25 17:55:14 2015 UTC,"People are putting an impossible standard on the format because it's crazy expensive. As in, a literal impossible baseline because $10/pack is unjustifiable.  I agree that it's way overpriced, but I'm not going to judge the format on that. It's not like X dollars = X enjoyment... it doesn't make any sense to judge it that way."
lrcast,37694y,Infersader,-1,Mon May 25 19:07:55 2015 UTC,"It's not like X dollars = X enjoyment... it doesn't make any sense to judge it that way.   If someone enjoys a $30 format as much as he enjoys a $12 format, why bother with the $30?  That doesn't imply a linear notion of enjoyment on any aspect."

lrcast,37694y,Infersader,4,Mon May 25 20:22:16 2015 UTC,Khans was a heck of a lot more fun and rewarding than this crap. They're going to have to lower the price if they expect me to draft this over that.  Edit: I'm sorry I have higher standards when it comes to a draft that costs $40 instead of $13.

lrcast,37694y,diabloblanco,3,Mon May 25 17:52:49 2015 UTC,"I'll never understand why people get downvoted for voicing their honest opinions.  I'm in the same boat. My friend and I draft regularly at a LGS and when MM came out we decided, ""Sure, why not?"" and did a draft. That was a big lesson for us. Neither of us play Modern, we didn't really know the cards (other than listening to the LR set review) and most of the other people playing had more experience with the set. Plus we only ended up with a couple of cards worth any money (which for is was part of the appeal, since we knew we had no long term plans for Modern).  We knew MM2015 wasn't even on our radar. What has sucked is that DTK enjoyment really fell off (for us) after a few weeks. I can still afford to draft the regular sets but since neither of us were really enjoying it, we're saving that money for other things. Gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em."
lrcast,37694y,llamagoelz,4,Mon May 25 18:08:27 2015 UTC,"Totally, I think if you're paying 3x the amount of what you normally would for a draft, you should be getting something more out of it. Conspiracy drafts were priced the same as your average draft and offered a unique experience. Standard sets offer you new cards to play with in limited. But Modern Masters 2015? What experience do I get that a core set or a cube doesn't offer? I look at what I paid for most of the drafts I enjoyed immensely and compare it to this and it's not enough to justify that price point. They should have just focused on reprinting more Modern staples."
lrcast,37694y,procumbo,1 point,Mon May 25 12:05:26 2015 UTC,Increased value of cards doesn't count?
lrcast,37694y,Infersader,1 point,Mon May 25 12:58:13 2015 UTC,"There are many on /r/mtgfinance and youtube that have broken down the value of this set and determined that is not the case. Prices are going to continue to drop further, especially after the GPs. That's why we're looking at whether the quality of the limited environment justifies this price or not."

lrcast,37694y,Talpostal,0,Mon May 25 21:00:53 2015 UTC,"If the EV isn't there and it's not the limited environment, why such a high cost?"
lrcast,37694y,ArsIgnis,2,Mon May 25 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"Because they can. I think this just brings into focus something we've mostly gotten used to about Magic: we're paying lots of money for pieces of cardboard. Now that we're paying even more money for the same cardboard with other stuff printed on it, we're feeling the sting of the whole situation all over again."
lrcast,37694y,negativeview,2,Mon May 25 18:18:43 2015 UTC,"EV isn't there? Sure, it's not at the absurd levels of KtK, DtK, and MMA1 but the ratios are certainly better than any of the Theros sets.  It's just higher stakes."
lrcast,376ozd,zbeg,5,Mon May 25 09:20:27 2015 UTC,"Something like this?   Mana Fixing (7):  1x Noble Hierarch  2x Rampant Growth  2x Wayfarers Bauble  1x Fiery Fall  1x Sylvan Bounty  Removal (7):  1x Lightning Bolt  2x Burst Lightning  1x Tribal Flames  1x Wrecking Ball  2x Narcolepsy  Creatures (10):  3x Matca Rioters  2x Dragonsoul Knight  1x Worldheart Phoenix  3x Skyreach Mantra  1x Aethersnipe  Lands (16):  1x Evolving Wilds  1x Rakdos Carnarium  8x Forest  3x Mountain  1x Plains  1x Swamp  1x Island  Maximum efficient removal and all the 5 colour creatures, plus all the fixing you can get your hands on. Hitting 5 colours should be fairly easy. I don't think there's much credit to running the creatures not abusing your manabase, like Gnarlid Pack and Nest Invader, but they're possible. You have a lot of removal to pick from, I took the 'best' I think while trying to lean toward red a little as a secondary colour.   It's a shame you don't have a couple more bounce lands, but I think the deck might play pretty nicely, and should certainly be fun!"
lrcast,376ozd,SirChuffly,1 point,Mon May 25 09:25:46 2015 UTC,"I think you're on the right track, though I definitely like an Arrest over one of the Narcolepsys and might consider the Nameless Inversion over the other one, or at least side it in in certain matchups. Also need to at least consider one of the 2-drops so you don't get run over looking to make dragonsoul knight an actual threat."
lrcast,376ozd,mageta621,1 point,Mon May 25 16:49:37 2015 UTC,Key decisions were:   How many lands? Which removal spells are we playing? How hard do we commit to the domain theme? How important are creatures like Dragonsoul Knight to the deck?   Opinions on how my friends would build this are all over the map.
lrcast,376ozd,blindfremen,1 point,Mon May 25 09:22:34 2015 UTC,"18 land, especially important for decks with 3+ colors"
lrcast,376ozd,blindfremen,1 point,Tue May 26 19:59:53 2015 UTC,This is one of the more interesting parts about this. I've had people play anywhere between 14 and 18 lands. All very reasonable players.  I played 15 fwiw.
lrcast,376ozd,LC_Music,1 point,Wed May 27 04:59:55 2015 UTC,15 is way too low for a 5 color deck. You have to hit multiple colors and 4+ land drops so it's very likely you will get mana screwed with only 15 sources.
lrcast,376nft,dolpherx,3,Mon May 25 08:59:48 2015 UTC,"Feels like a 17 land set still, I would get as many bounce lands as you can even if they only share one of your two colors but I wouldn't use them as an excuse to cut lands from your deck."
lrcast,376nft,Cabluesman,3,Mon May 25 16:47:18 2015 UTC,"I played a ramp deck with 2x ulamog's crusher, and artisan of kozilek. Despite that, 4x bounceland ended up putting me at 16 lands and it felt like the right number the whole night. Ended up winning my pod.  The list, if you care: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/mm2015-1-5c-eldrazi/"
lrcast,376nft,CogMonocle,2,Mon May 25 18:55:42 2015 UTC,"I can see that it makes sense to hvae 16 lands for you as you have a few nests, baubles, etc which help with mana if you do not get a third land for example."
lrcast,376nft,mlundberg27,2,Mon May 25 19:33:32 2015 UTC,"I play 17 lands in most decks.  Outside of the ramp decks, you want to be fast and aggressive."
lrcast,375w1s,mageta621,3,Mon May 25 03:40:36 2015 UTC,"Well, hm. My inclination is still that Ulamog is pretty dicey and those Skyhunter Skirmishers look absolutely awful, but I guess it got the job done. It's got plenty of good cards in it like the double Banefire, which is clearly awesome."
lrcast,375w1s,Sceptilesolar,2,Mon May 25 05:43:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah pretty much all the creatures before t4 were in there as speed bumps. That said, a 2 power flyer for 3 isn't the end of the world.  The Ulamog was a little less dicey than it looks thanks to all the bounce lands and Eldrazi lands, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't just looking to see if it was viable by picking it p1p1.  Edit: and I almost forgot to mention: the Everflowing Chalice really helped with the eldrazi"
lrcast,375w1s,gild_for_kitten_pics,2,Mon May 25 06:14:22 2015 UTC,I love the Banefire and Spitebellows synergy with Swans. 3 mana draw 6? I'll take it.

lrcast,3767n4,Jackomatrus,3,Mon May 25 15:02:50 2015 UTC,"I've beaten decks that managed to cast Eldrazi several times so far. As you say, the removal is good enough, counters are good enough, and if all that fails you can simply block them. It almost feels cruel to Mana Leak someone who just tapped out and sac'd all his spawns to cast an Eldrazi, but it gets the job done.  The real power in the Eldrazi spawn deck comes from using the other cards that benefit from the spawn tokens. Mortarpod, Scavenger Drake, and Algae Gharial are all ridiculous in that deck. I would take any of them over an Eldrazi."
lrcast,3767n4,gamblekat,2,Mon May 25 06:19:25 2015 UTC,"I played a sealed version of the eldrazi deck and will say that as the eldrazi deck you need ways to utilize the mana in addition to casting the Titans. Savage Twister to keep the board from clogging, Algae Gharial, the Kavu, Pelakka Wurm, Banefire, overwhelming stampede, overwhelm are all options to keep you from being stranded."
lrcast,3767n4,SharkFinnigan,2,Mon May 25 13:51:16 2015 UTC,"I think the eldrazi deck is fine, you just need a multitude of your own answers. If you're nothing but nest invaders and ulamog's crushers, your deck isn't going to be great. However if you're rampant growthing into firery fall and tribal flames and savage twister and vengeful rebirth, maybe a splashed O-ring or mulldrifter or endrek sahr (seeing as you can splash just about anything).  The deck is pretty solid.  I played it last night and facing down narcolepsy and spectral procession felt rough but I still managed to just fight through it. One of my opponents actually had the mana leak - but I had about 15 mana at that point (granted, primeval titan is a card).  I think it can be good. But a super linear draft deck isn't where you want to be. I think it's not helpful to think of it as an ""eldrazi"" ramp deck. It's deck that plays all of the powerful non-synergy green cards, rampant growth, whatever random sweet off-color cards you managed to pick up, and if your deck can handle it, a couple eldrazi.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go cast some turn four pelakka wurms."
lrcast,3767n4,CogMonocle,2,Mon May 25 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this format is not ROE, which had way fewer answers to Eldrazi and a lot of places to dump your ramp (levelers, invokers). In this format, you're discouraged from leading with your best guys, since they'll get eaten up by the readily available/cheap removal in the format.  It probably does well against Rx decks (except aggro RB), but everything does well against them."
