A sea eagle, it has two known sub-species and forms a species pair with the White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla). Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.  The Bald Eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish, which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest nest of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to 4 m (13 ft) deep, 2.5 m (8.2 ft) wide, and 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) in weight.  Sexual maturity is attained at the age of four to five years.  Bald Eagles are not actually bald; the name derives from an older meaning of ""white headed"". The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in plumage, but females are about 25 percent larger than males. The beak is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.    Image i     Interesting: Bald Eagle Mountain | Eagle | Bald Eagle (horse) | Bald Eagle State Forest   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

retorted,1h94eu,Cutealoo,5,Fri Jun 28 15:35:36 2013 UTC,"I am sort of off topic in regards to this post. This is just my opinion.  Illegal immigration is really bad for any country. Illegal immigrants are a huge fiscal burden on tax paying society. It is time to end the abuse of American generosity.  Let me ask who will pay for the Illegal immigration that costs U.S. taxpayers about $113 billion a year at the federal, state and local level. The bulk of the costs — some $84 billion — are absorbed by state and local governments.   Illegal aliens constitute over 25% of the federal prison population. Think about that for a moment. This means that a group which comprises less than 5% of the population is committing 25% percent of the crime. In Los Angeles alone, 95% of all outstanding warrants for homicide (which total approximately 1,200-1,500) target illegal aliens.  Up to 2/3 of all fugitive felony warrants (approximately 17,000) are for illegal aliens. In Lake County, Illinois 1/2 of the murderers and 21.5% of all criminals now in jail are illegal aliens, costing the county an annualized rate of $4,056, 945. Education for the children of illegal aliens constitutes the single largest cost to taxpayers, at an annual price tag of nearly $52 billion. Nearly all of those costs are absorbed by state and local governments.    It is so easy to throw around ""politically correct"" words, calling people who want immigration reform racist, bigots, xenophobes, ect.. when you dont understand the financial and social costs for a failed immigration policy.  Watch this short,easy to understand Video Clip: Immigration Tradition"
retorted,1h94eu,inextremus,3,Fri Jun 28 17:42:48 2013 UTC,"Detailed, concise, and accurate. It doesn't matter how ugly it is, immigrants, notably illegals, are bad for a country. This bullshit about illegals coming to america and giving birth in american hospitals for free and getting free education and even college and working here to send US money back to their home country and families and on and on is ridiculous.   If you want to be a citizen, learn how to be a citizen. That's the point of a test. We need to be stricter about immigration, not more lax. It's a fact that we are too easy. We are the ""melting pot"", and more diverse than most if not all, but god damn there needs to be some rules.   Yes, that person is a bitch. Yes they are racist and xenophobic.

People just really want there to be a correlation between video games and violent youth, so they don't have to accept responsibility for their shitty parenting practices.   Kid: (Kid takes out three grunts and elite.) Parent: Oh no! He killed his grandmother in the face witha gun. Damn those video games!!!!  Cop: Um. Where'd he get the handgun?    Parent: This isn't about me. It's about how those damn video games turned my son into a murderer.    Cop: How'd did he get the handgun, again?  Parent: It was laying on the coffee table. When are you sheeple going to wake up and put a stop to the violence these kids are exposed to.  Cop: Why was the gun on the coffee table?  Parent: I had it sitting there in case my ex came back. We've been having problems. I cheated a little on him and he shoved me into a wall, but that has nothing to do with the video games. He was playing that evil game and then picked up the gun and shot my mom. I should start a campaign to have video games outlawed.  Cop: Why do you think he shot his grandma?  Parent: He was obviously recreating what he saw on the game?  Cop: Yeah. Okay. Did he say anything to her before he shot her?  Parent: Yeah. He held up the gun sideways like they do in the movies and said ""look at this grandma."" Then, (sniff) he shot her dead. He was so cold. I didn't even recognize him.  Cop: So, was it video games we should blame or television?  Parent: What?  Cop: You said he held it sideways like they do in the movies. Could you show me how he did it?  Parent: Like this.   Cop: He held it just like that? Like he was looking at something he'd just discovered laying on the coffee table that he'd never seen before and wanted to show his grandmother what he'd found? You're right. We should ban video games. (sarcasm)  Parent: Thank you. It is such a relief to finally have some one recognize the truth. Wait. What? Why are you handcuffing me?"

retorted,1bellx,twin-cest,2,Wed Jun 12 06:12:40 2013 UTC,"It's very possible! It's a little-known and very underdiagnosed learning disorder. I was diagnosed with DC and ADHD (Inattentive Type) in elementary school, and had the diagnosis reconfirmed by a psychiatrist a few years ago. These are the things I have noticed most, re: how it affects me:   The most obvious symptom and the tip-off to my teachers: despite having a high IQ (LOL, according to the test - I don't really feel it) and doing well in almost everything I tried at school, I fucking suck at anything involving numbers. Like...in Math class - I am actually not bad at word problems and some geometry, but the minute I have to do anything number-related I just lose it. I still don't know my times tables at age 27, despite trying to learn them a millon times. Science, too - I got excellent grades in science and I love it, but I had to drop out of chemistry because I couldn't do any of the molecular weight stuff (fortunately I am much better at biology). Even when I have learned languages, I could do everything fine except learn to count in another language. I just...couldn't make the number/word associations stick in my brain.  I could not tell analogue time until I was about 14. Like...I understood how to figure it out, but if I looked at an analogue clock I would feel confused and it would take me five minutes to figure out what it said. It was only through practice that I could get better at it - but even still, I feel momentary confusion when I look at an analogue clock. I have a shitty sense of time in general, too - I would continually get in trouble as a kid for being late all the time, and even now the only way I get somewhere on time is by being paranoid and leaving super early. I was also really slow to learn certain things as a kid, like...tying my shoelaces, anything that involved co-ordination or spatial understanding. My drawings always looked off, too - kind of picasso-like, I was unable to draw realistically for a long time. I have always been, and I still am, really fucking clumsy. I will walk right into walls and doorways because I misjudge the distance between me and the wall and the hallway, haha. I suck at sports, really hard.  I am terrible with money. I am always hesitant to attribute this to my dyscalculia, because I feel like it could have a lot of contributing factors, but apparently it's a common problem with this disorder. Apart from the fact that I cannot balance a checkbook to save my life, it's like...prices of things never really sink in, for me? I never look at a pricetag and think ""OMG, THAT IS SO MUCH"", they just look like...random numbers. And when I was younger, I would look at pricetags and think, ""That costs $20, and I have $20, so I can buy that"", and found it really difficult to wrap my head around the fact that...$20 should be split up and used for many things/that money runs out quickly if you spend it all? No idea if that makes sense, but much like the clock thing, it took a lot of practice and limit-setting to train myself to spend money properly and stick to a budget, and even so I have to stop and think and remind myself when I am shopping.    Haha, I feel kind of embarassed saying all that, because it makes me feel stupid, but...yeah. It's actually a disorder, and it can have a lot of big effects on your life. If you think you might have it and want to know for sure, you should go to a clinical psychologist and have a psychoeducational assessment done - that will confirm the diagnosis if it's valid. There's not really a treatment for it - you can do a lot of exercises and stuff like sudoku to try and sharpen up the 'numbers' parts of your brain that don't work so well - but just getting the diagnosis can be validating if you have gone through life feeling like a moron because numbers don't make sense to you."

Also, Ranik Solusar was disciplined by the Council for his marriage and the child it produced, but was not expelled from the Order. Up to the Great Sith War, some Jedi did practice marriage and were known to have families of their own. There were even cases of families consisting entirely of Jedi, such as that of Andur Sunrider. The children of Jedi families were often gifted in the Force. Even later in the Order, such families existed—though the continuation of the line was through those family members who did not become Jedi.

I get that it can be hard for any person (not just women...) to reveal themselves to others for fear of judgment, but we're really lowering the bar for praiseworthy achievement here.  Similarly, the exact same logic could be used for flashers. If it offends you, it offends you.

I do mind when they get naked in front of me. And putting talc on their bodies in front of me is just disgusting. Doesn't even matter what they look like.  But it goes deeper than that. It doesn't matter if I find it offensive. The fact that someone would do something that is sort of controversial, that might reasonably offend me, even if it doesn't, I consider rude. I understand if you want to get naked and talc your body, but the fact of the matter is that, in most contexts (at least that I'm used to), people don't typically do that. It's not like she needed to do that and that was the only place to do that. Obviously it was her right to, but it is disrespectful. The question is whether the chance that it might offend me times the offense that I would receive is greater or less than the utility that she gets from taking that chance. If she decides that she would rather do it out in the open and risk offending me than simply finding a private area, I consider that rude."

Both he and I know he would not be discouraged by my choice of language - he would invite it. Yes, being eloquent is wonderful, but I did get my point across, and my point was enhanced and emphasised by the choice of language. I think everyone should embrace language, it's the most powerful tool we have. I agree that complex language isn't always required, but on important topics, such as quantifying and comparing genocide, it's our duty as reasonable human beings to make the right point as effectively as possible. Dumbing down goes against the root of my point: complex issues should not be simplified, they should be discussed at whatever length the issue commands.

Your submission history confirmed my initial assumptions - that you're a conspiracy-keen weed smoker. Try taking a week off the greens and dedicating your energy to something more productive than flaming in comments for self-satisfaction. Even if your misguided views were half right, how does sharing an image on Facebook or reddit make a difference to the cause (Kony 2012)? If things are as you say, we have little hope of changing them, so let's help the people who are prisoners of the construct you perceive, right? Let's not instead get off on how cool we are for knowing the ""truth"", maaan.  In response to the content of your image, the governments of many developed countries would currently tick all 14 boxes. But to say the US at present is the equivalent of 'Hitler's Germany' is simply untrue. It's not that binary. Stay calm and be rational here, Suzie. Control of information was essential in Nazi Germany, without it Hitler would have accomplished nothing. The rise of the internet has allowed a freedom of information never seen before. Look at the communication throughout the 'arab spring', and Iran the year before - even citizens without democracy are having their voices heard, forcing other nations to weigh in on the debate. Even actual fascist states are having to watch themselves. Suggesting that what occurred in Hitler's Germany is achievable in the states today is beyond retarded. It's paranoid and deluded. Seriously, calm down and re-evaluate - or just kill yourself."

retorted,wd61u,Mosethyoth,2,Tue Jul 17 07:02:44 2012 UTC,I can connect. By my view of moral if you can improve something (knowledge of others) without hurting anyone (you and them) more than he can profit from the improvement (not being included anymore in Pyramid Schemes due to having lost more money than they won caused by paying your fee) you're doing a good thing.  I refute my previous statement of you being immoral as I am know conscious that your intention wasn't drawing money out of the Pyramid Scheme.

I recently went to a presentation where a company presented the same opportunity but with travel. You have an initial one-time fee then you pay a low monthly rate (like you do when you open up a new mobile phone contract except with no contract), but if you pay a little more initally you can become a recruiter, and if you get four of your friends to sign up to the most basic plan (at least) then you no longer have to pay for your monthly fee ever.  I didn't understand how they could be making a profit out of this if they give me a lifetime membership for free, but then I realized that for every guy that gets a free membership there's at least four other guys who ARE paying the monthly service.  I read all the fine print. There is no contract. You can quit whenever, but they have great offers. I asked if my friend's had to also turn recruiters, and they said ""no"".  Another thing, if all of my four friends refer four of their friends, I start getting a monthly check (low of course, but it builds as more people are added).   One thing, I know to ask for next week is if/how I would pay taxes on this income.

From what I can tell from the google translated edition of the Spanish wikipedia article, he and some accomplices killed a 17 y.o. woman and he threw her body into the Guadalquivir River. It looks like he was sentenced to 20 years plus some fines in the hundreds of Euros. The information in the picture technically isn't wrong, but it is slightly misleading since that occurred in Spain.  Also, nice response, Sullivan, although you could do a better job of covering the names of the people who liked it."

Interesting quote from that last link,    Interestingly, as suggested by Lucas and Peters (46), another tough pliant food they would have had difficulty processing is meat.

There are plenty of animals that have the ability to eat meat, while it's not necessary for their diets, and can even shorten their lifespans. I wish more people could understand that.
