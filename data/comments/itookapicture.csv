itookapicture,3dz3v7,thereischris,7,Mon Jul 20 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"Well done man. Great use of the trees to frame the milky way.   May I ask, how did you post process this?"
itookapicture,3dz3v7,lepermessiah222,5,Mon Jul 20 19:46:51 2015 UTC,"I edited it in Lightroom.  The original photo was actually pretty hazy from the clouds. If you look at the image you can see brown patches over the milky way, those are the clouds and before they covered up the milky way a considerable amount.   I brought up the sharpness a bunch as well as the vibrance. I think what helped a lot (which is now a new feature in the new Lightroom cc, a tool called Haze at the bottom of your tools) was using the clarity adjustment. It really helped to bring out all the stars. I didn't do any brushing, or anything where i brightened/adjusted a specific part of the image; I edited the image as a whole.  After all that, I added a filter from VSCO for color and curves."
itookapicture,3dz3v7,lepermessiah222,4,Mon Jul 20 20:03:05 2015 UTC,"I would go even further and use a big brush on the milky way. Up the exposure a bit, not much, a little more clarity, saturation and contrast. Make it pop a little more!  Didn't quite make out the clouds over the milky way at first. Cool to see a good use for the dehaze tool, haven't had a chance to test it yet."
itookapicture,3dz3v7,comienzo,6,Mon Jul 20 20:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah i saw someone use it for an underwater shot. They used the dehaze tool and BAM.   I also found it works really well if you're shooting raw, or a flat color profile, it helps bring out those tones."

itookapicture,3dx0vp,grcadrian,12,Mon Jul 20 06:55:38 2015 UTC,"Taken on iPhone 5S, processed in VSCOcam.  I raised both the exposure and contrast a bit, and added a vignette.  I didn't adjust saturation or anything like that (the red on this car pops like crazy).   I was surprised at how well lit the car was. This was yesterday and it was raining in SoCal. This specific area had a tree canopy.   Guess I chose a good spot for the lighting."
itookapicture,3dx0vp,awhaling,3,Mon Jul 20 07:00:59 2015 UTC,Damn impressive. Great job. Just shows that you can take good pictures with pretty much anything.
itookapicture,3dx0vp,DrubieDaGuru,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:55:33 2015 UTC,"The lighter area behind the car (not under tree canopy) really helps to draw the eye to the car. Additionally, the natural vignette formed by the tree canopy is effectively framing the shot. I also like the colors here and the lighting lends itself to representing the dull reds in the brown leaves. Well done OP!"

itookapicture,3dx0vp,Lyr0c,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:16:56 2015 UTC,They're intentional. A lot of detailing and cleaning work on car exteriors is done specifically to make the exterior glossy and shiny in pursuit of those crisp and bright reflections.  Saying the reflections are distracting in this photo is like saying the boobs are distracting in Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit issue.

At what time of day did you take your picture?  Sadly your picture is not getting a lot of response - I thought about how its impression could be strengthened - what do you think about this?   I cut it so that the ground, the background trees and the sky each take about a third of the image and added some vignetting.  I hoped that the smaller image height and the darker corners would evoke a feeling of tightness hopefully almost like being hunted."

itookapicture,3dsv8r,Dualiti,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:17:48 2015 UTC,"To fill in the background: This was taken at Rainbow Beach in the early hours of the morning. Everyone else had gone to bed so I wrapped myself up in jumpers and walked down the the beach hoping to get a nice photo or two... I definitely got more than I bargained for!   The Milky Way was so bright, and the sky so clear from the recent rain, the was a visible glow on the ground, enough to cast a faint shadow. The glows in the distance are both from towns +50km away.   The Magellanic Clouds are on the left side of the photo, just above the main resort in Rainbow Beach."

itookapicture,3dsv8r,HazzaTheAlmighty,2,Sun Jul 19 10:55:29 2015 UTC,"I took this one using a Canon 6D and Samyang 24mm f/1.4 on a tripod.   Settings were shutter 15"", 4100K, f/2.0, ISO 2000, High Noise Reduction, as well as a built in noise-removal function on the camera, and post-production techniques.  I then basically just took a photo, and rotated it along the horizon first, then go back to your left shot and do the next layer. You want to do it in this order to make sure you're getting the horizon line the same when the stars are all in a similar position. The photos just filled with stars generally don't matter as much, as software can correct them as simple realigning of 'dots' easily.   Make sure you take an extra set of shots AROUND the edge of your intended panoramic frame to act as a buffer for later, those are the areas which you will crop out as they will be stretched the most by the panoramic process.   Hope this clears it up :) Let us know if you want more info."

itookapicture,3dqsco,Alex_R_M,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:38:17 2015 UTC,This is some great surrealist imagery. Can you tell us a bit about it?
itookapicture,3dqsco,Synthesizer-patel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:30:15 2015 UTC,"Of course! The way I do the majority of my work is by first placing my camera on a tripod. From there I plan my pictures with multiple exposures in mind. For this, I took a photo of nothing there, just the blank space first. This is just a habit, it's always helpful to have as it makes editing much easier. Next I took a picture of just the shirt laying on the ground, with no arm going through it. Very carefully I placed my arm through the head hole and out of the arm hole, taking care as to not move the position of the shirt too much. After I got a picture of that, I bring the images into photoshop and load them into a Stack. I blend the images together by layering the images and selectively deleting and moving what I want until the image looks natural (as natural as a severed arm can look), then color grade to add to the mood."
itookapicture,3dqsco,Synthesizer-patel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:03:31 2015 UTC,"That's really well done. I feel like it reminds me of another artist's work (not like you're copying, I mean more the sense/themes of it).

You have highlights on the side right from the plant that my eye keeps getting dragged to, if you were able to remove that im sure it would look even better than it already does.  To see what i mean try closing your eyes for a few seconds, then open your eyes again, initially the eye is getting drawn to the subject, but in the peripheral the highlights distract from it. The actual point of balance in this photo right now is between the flowers and that highlight."

So if these snakes were kept in a box and possibly de-fanged or mistreated, it's not because of some sort of tourist activity/sightseeing. This has been going on for a while, and I am not responsible for it.  second, this guy had these 3 cobras, a couple pythons and two or three other badass-looking snakes in a room the size of a cheap motel's bathroom, that were hissing like fuck and going everywhere under the mattresses and in the corners, my fixer had long freaked-out and left the room, the guy didn't speak a word of english.  If you also take into consideration that just after that, he started some ""magic"" tricks with human bones and showing off a collection of powders and mixture, you'll understand I didn't quite take the time to grab a snake and check on its dentition. they were trying to bite the guy though, and he was careful not to let them - told me it had happened before and that was not a pleasant experience, even if he is supposed to be a sort of ""snakebite-witch-doctor""."

itookapicture,3dip4b,pt606,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:37:45 2015 UTC,"The greens are looking mighty yellow, so maybe try driving up the blues in the saturation window in LR. I see some halo around your subject which is also pretty distracting. Cleaning up your masking would help that. I'm still working on my own technique, as well, so don't be discouraged. Judging by the noise in your shadows, it looks like you exposed for highlights and brought up the shadows in post. I tend to slightly underexpose shadows and then work on the highlights with split toning and tone curve. Bracketing shots will typically help you get the Goldilocks exposure that can be worked in post.  I like the composition of your shot, but it's hard for me to tell exactly what you want me to pay attention to. I feel that the mood of your photo suggest that the subject should be dwarfed by his surroundings, but since he's so large in the frame and the surroundings are out of focus, the feeling I get instead is that he is commanding his surroundings. Was that your intention when making this picture?  Jeez, I just realized that I've become artsy-fartsy. When did this happen to me?"

How many people are going to blow up the game by taking a photo of a pretty girl looking at the camera in some natural location before we decide it's been enough?   Technically, it's great. You got some good light on her face and wonderful fringing in the bokeh around the setting sun. Though I can see some kind of parking lot in the background(?). I guess what I'm getting at here is that it's just not enough to take vapid photos of people in forests. Are you playing with lighting or composition? Is the photo editorial? What is the photo doing for me besides showing me a pretty face? That's what I'd challenge you to think of.   Of course the whole point is moot if this was just a hired gig for someone and you're showing off a nice shot, if so then great!"
