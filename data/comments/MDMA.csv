MDMA,3e4t5m,nowihaveanxiety,3,Tue Jul 21 23:27:25 2015 UTC,"""Have taken MDMA 7 times since January this year Have been taking MDMA weekly for the past 3 weeks, except last week where I took Cocaine""   Thats a lot. You might just have a huge tolerance and you didn't take enough to get past the comeup. You seem like a sensible person so you probably already know that you should take a break.   To be honest I had a similar freakout more than once on MDMA. It usually happens on the second day of a festival. There was a time I've used MDMA every month for about a year. Maybe some people are just more susceptible to this than others. idk. Its worth noting that I'm normally an anxious person.  My wild and unfounded speculation is that classical conditioning of drug tolerance may apply here.  http://psysci.com/2012/11/06/classical-conditioning-of-drug-tolerance/ Basically when you expect to take the drug (you're at a show and you know you just ate your pills) your body knows and goes through physiological changes to counteract the drug, so you actually experience the drugs withdrawal effects if you don't take enough.   Sounds pretty bizarre but its a real phenomenon that explains why people mysteriously overdose when they had regularly taken a similar dose of drugs before, and it explains why people will feel withdrawal symptoms when they go to a place where they would usually take drugs. (might explain why I get a little anxious before a rave) entirely speculation on my part, and I don't have a solution for it either other than to take a tolerance break."

MDMA,3e4t5m,Dick_Wellington,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:13:20 2015 UTC,"It seems like a lot of your comments about what your friends were doing/thinking could all just be delusional thinking on your part. That type of stuff is pretty common on drugs, and I wouldn't be surprised if, when you talk to your friends about this, they didn't notice any of it. You should try and recognize those negative thought patterns and not entertain them. Realize they are irrational.  Something similar to this happened to me after a difficult LSD trip. That bit about having a delayed response is exactly what I had. It was also brought about by a difficult social interaction. Everytime I thought back to that moment in time, it would give me anxiety.  My advice:  Realize that this is probably some irrational thinking, and even if it's not, your friends don't care that you wigged out a little. They have probably already forgotten: can you remember a time when one of your friends embarrassed themselves? Probably not, and even if you do its not like you give a fuck.. It doesn't really matter. If those people are your friends it won't matter to them either.   Give it some time. I guarantee you will feel better in a month, if not much less. This experience is still very recent, and time heals pretty much all wounds. Realize this, and it should reduce some stress.   Slightly circlejerky, but get good sleep and some exercise. Go on a walk, hike, run, etc. to clear your mind. Lay off all other drugs for a bit while you recuperate. Think about your experience and face those memories full on: eventually they won't faze you anymore.  I just read the bottom of your post and will answer it directly here. Anxiety surrounding my difficult acid experience lasted 2-3 weeks. I'd say I felt off and a little slow for about a week. My old self is 100% back, I have tripped and rolled many times after that and haven't had a bad time since.   All that said, that doesn't sound like MDMA at all. ALWAYS test your stuff. This is the cardinal sin of drug use, and is really inexcusable. But, just hang tight man. You will feel fine again in a few weeks tops, try not to worry too much. There is no permanent damage."

MDMA,3e3i4x,disanchez27,2,Tue Jul 21 17:55:00 2015 UTC,"My fourth time doing MDMA I did 150/70 mg with a friend. Since I was the only one rolling, my friend fell asleep long before my roll was over, so I went for a walk outside.   Whenever I dicided to sit down to have a smoke I immedately started zoning out. While zoning out I had these crazy hallucinations. Suddenly I had 3 of my closest friends sitting close to me and some sort of conversations was going on. I would then suddenly snap out of it and realize that I was actually alone.   This exact thing happened ~10 times over the course of 1-2 hours. It was really scary the first time, but for each time it happened it bothered me less.  Normally my hallucinations just consist of patterns appearing where ever I dicide to look, but only at the end of the roll. They are often slightly controlable, in the way that I can make them move differently or change shape."
MDMA,3e3i4x,norwegiandroger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds pretty similar. Love the controlable aspect of these kinds of ""trips."" Definitely makes the whole thing more manageable."
MDMA,3e3i4x,llooggaann,2,Tue Jul 21 21:26:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, part of the reason I do the combo. My last roll, about a month ago, I took a 250mg UPS pill, smoked a lot during the peak, and when I turned off the lights, I had bubbles floating around and bouncing in time to the music (almost Matrix-like). It was insane."
MDMA,3e3i4x,Rorta,2,Tue Jul 21 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"Nice! Was just thinking that next time I roll and smoke, I'll probably want to do it in a setting that would facilitate this, rather than as an after-thought (I was at festivals both times I had this happen, so I wasn't exactly in a tripping mood)."

I'm waiting for the day for it to all come back to me. It's only been 2.5 days since, so I'm putting all effort into finding that happiness. I miss it.

Then I tell them that the recover-e will help them get to sleep and drastically reduce any come down depression...they are always up for that.  As for my personal experience, I care about my brain and free-radicals and shit so before I was buying from ravesafer I was getting everything from amazon too and focusing mostly on the antioxidants.  I haven't been able to tell any difference between the two approaches (ravesafer vs. buying everything separate).  What I do is take a prepar-e pack before I go out, then when I get home, if its been long enough since my last drop (at least 6 or so hrs),  I'll take a recover-e before bed, and do that for two more nights after.

Over time side reactions and decompositions will almost always result in discoloration.   With extremely compound and select reagents sometimes the original color will remain indefinably. I've only seen this sort of behavior with froehde's reagent though."
MDMA,3e30oc,morespore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:45:53 2015 UTC,"You've added way too much sample - you literally only need a grain of whatever substance you're going to test, and you'll get enough of a reaction to know what the outcome of the test is.  It can also help to react better if you crush it into a powder, although MDMA is completely water soluble so it should dissolve easily enough.  FWIW, the tests look positive for MDMX.  Roll on!"

MDMA,3dztju,TheSandmanECW,4,Tue Jul 21 08:17:33 2015 UTC,Mdma fucked my life up. And yes I was an addict. But even once every 2 weeks can do some damage.
MDMA,3dztju,steezyneezy,2,Tue Jul 21 00:01:23 2015 UTC,I used to do it every weekend I would also do huge doses. I cant honestly say it was addiction it was more we would party a lot and I didnt care about repercussion. I got an anxiety disorder for about 6 months. But today I feel amazing and have zero long standing side effects. The damage caused by MDMA is reversible unless it wakes a dormant mental disorder like schizophrenia or bipolar. It wont be the cause of the disorder but more simply what brings the disorder out into light. Serotonin which is what MDMA affects can be repaired and replenished.
MDMA,3dztju,TheSandmanECW,3,Tue Jul 21 00:23:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel you. I used to do it every day like a dumbass!!! Lol actually, dopamine is an effected neurotransmitter as well! I actually have permanently fried some of the axons in my brain associated with mdma. After I overcame my addiction, I tried rolling but it doesn't feel the same anymore. It's not enjoyable at all.  I've seen mdma do a lot of fucked up things to people, from abuse of course. Mdma is great and all but it can be extremely dangerous in a lot of ways. Just like a lot of things to be honest. And I actually feel like I've repaired my brain too but I've damaged it to the point where I can never roll again. I'm glad you got better dude. I never thought I was going to get better, but here I am, super happy and feeling great!"
MDMA,3dztju,steezyneezy,2,Tue Jul 21 00:30:03 2015 UTC,I actually never thought about the effect on your dopamine levels. Honestly mine are probably fucked from the 10+ years of smoking pot anyways lol.

MDMA,3dztju,steezyneezy,2,Tue Jul 21 00:56:18 2015 UTC,Coke is good and oddly enough it has a very chilling effect on me and pairs super well with a cig and a beer (though I dont smoke cigs often at all). But I hear you man weed is a very minor impact substance. The come down from E always was kind of a nice reminder to me of all the awesome times and music I had experience the night before.

MDMA,3e0aue,MrRefill,3,Mon Jul 20 23:40:52 2015 UTC,"I dunno why nobody has mentioned this yet. Crush it up, mix it up thoroughly with exactly a liter of water and then drink 85 ml's of it. MDMA is completely soluble in water, which means that each milliliter of water will have exactly the same amount of MDMA in it. MDMA keeps relatively well in water also, just label it clearly so you don't accidentally drink it when you're at the gym since close to a gram of good quality MDMA as a smaller person could well kill you"
MDMA,3e0aue,ch0dewrath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:46:34 2015 UTC,"sounds sick, ill do that i guess. you got any suggestions on how to scale it out"
MDMA,3e0aue,ch0dewrath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:49:32 2015 UTC,"You'll literally have to chuck all of your MDMA in there in order to get an accurate dose, this is the one downside.   After you've dissolved all of your MDMA in the water, you can think of 1 milliliter as being equivalent to 1 mg of MDMA, which it essentially is. You could also roughly eyeball half of the MDMA and just dissolve it in half a liter of water.   I'd crush it up pretty fine first to make it easier for it to dissolve, and if you do choose to chuck only half of your gram into 500ml of water, it'll make the eyeballing process easier because as some people have said, it's hard to estimate the weight of rockier lumps of MDMA."
MDMA,3e0aue,mdmawesome1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:53:55 2015 UTC,This is assuming you received exactly a gram....
MDMA,3e0aue,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:34 2015 UTC,"Going to be kind of difficult because the size of the crystals can vary in weight, if it is not crushed to a fine powder. Walmart or something like it will have scales at the mg level, so I just going that way. Otherwise, the best you can do is break down your dose as best as you can, and then divide it into roughly equal amounts by eyeballing (NOT RECOMMENDED). For example, if you break it into sevenths, each section is about 143 mg. Unfortunately, doing it this way could be dangerous, especially because you do not really know if you have 1 g (1000 mg) of MDMA."
MDMA,3e0aue,MythicalThermos,0,Mon Jul 20 23:45:47 2015 UTC,"its broken down into fine powder dawg  i know its 1g, or maybe a bit higher since i got it from a reputable vendor from the dark net"

MDMA,3e0aue,zNNS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:46:05 2015 UTC,"Have you done MDMA before? I definitely understand your sentiment--most drug users (including me) are very depressed and anxious. Are you aware of the negative side effects after you roll--usually it amplifies your depressive symptoms for up to two weeks after you roll.   You also will want at least one day to recover, so if you plan on seeing family tomorrow, especially first thing in the morning, I would suggest waiting to take it at a more appropriate time.  I am just saying think about it a little more. Do you know the dose that you want to take? If not, tell me how much you weigh, whether this is your first time."
MDMA,3e0aue,BobbleheadDoll,2,Tue Jul 21 00:50:33 2015 UTC,"this is my first time and i weigh 125  and its not first thing, and i know the side effects.

MDMA,3e0aue,bulbasauranus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:55:41 2015 UTC,"Okay. You weigh 125 lbs., which is 56.7 kg. I suggest taking about 1.5 to 1.75 mg/kg, so 85 mg to 100 mg. So you can break up your gram into tenths and just take one dose and then redose 60 mins later with 50 mg (half of another dose). Use the method another user mentioned below.  For a very strong dose where you will really feel it, you can break it up into eighths for 125 mg."

MDMA,3e0aue,psychoskid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:10:05 2015 UTC,A standard business card weighs 100mg.  You're not going to be able to make exact measurements but this is a good way of getting a relative idea.

I guess you could also try emptying out a capsule of some supplement, look up the capsule size, then see how much weight can fit in the capsule. Or you can use a small measuring spoon and look up online approximate weight. Again, all of these ideas will not give you exact measurements--you need a scale for that."

MDMA,3dxn8x,Zachatack1234,2,Mon Jul 20 12:23:00 2015 UTC,I've had the same experience. Since all of my previous rolls I feel like my outlook on life get a little bit better each time. Just don't forget the things you learn to understand while MDMA.
MDMA,3dxn8x,Zunscriii,3,Tue Jul 21 10:07:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is very normal after the first few times. I had the same experience, very euphoric for days after my roll the first 2 times. Pretty much every roll after my 2nd I feel a little depressed, or very depressed, but it passes."
MDMA,3dxn8x,idkhowtothrowaway,2,Mon Jul 20 11:34:09 2015 UTC,"I think following the suggestions on rollsafe helps to alleviate many of the negative repercussions after rolling. I don't really get the ""two week euphoria"" after dropping- but I don't feel bad either."

MDMA,3dxn8x,EasterGirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:46:38 2015 UTC,Every time I roll was with my girlfriend. So I didn't feel any. Maybe you took too much and depleted your serotonin?
MDMA,3dxldl,JamalMcShitnuggets,12,Mon Jul 20 11:02:21 2015 UTC,Most people who take supplements and long breaks do not get post MDMA depression.   Edit: Just realised you rolled 2 days in a row. That's your problem right there. 1-2 months break minimum. Not 1 day.
MDMA,3dxldl,hithere5,3,Mon Jul 20 12:44:44 2015 UTC,how long will this last? its the worst feeling ever
MDMA,3dxldl,TopHatSpike,9,Mon Jul 20 13:43:50 2015 UTC,Some physical exercise will help your brain recover. Get a solid workout in at the gym.

The worst part is over in 2-3 days but you'll feel it linger for a week...maybe 2 in the worst case, but every day gets better Oh btw: something I learned while dealing with depression myself: Just try to get trough today, don't worry about dealing with it tomorrow. Just today is fine"

Really helps get everything back to normal. I also do dabs, which in my rolling exp has helped tremendously with not only the come down, but recovery day as well. When the afterglow leaves, I may have a day of blah, because I miss how good the afterglow feels, but have never gotten depressed after a roll, and this is from someone who considers himself depressed most of the time."

MDMA,3dw2ul,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:20 2015 UTC,Yeah the second idea sounds good. Maybe I can take only 100mg oral and 50-65mg plugged?
MDMA,3dw2ul,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"I am not sure. I have not tried either suggestion, but I wanted to give you some options to thin about. Oral dosing lasts longer than plugging, so my guess is that starting off with parachuting and redosing with a plug would make it last longer. I mean, there are other possibilities, too: For your initial dose you can plug + oral and then do the same for your redose. Any combination you can think of--think about what you think would work best for you."
MDMA,3dw2ul,mollyanalyst,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"All right, thanks for the suggestions. I'll have to think about it. I think I may go with what you suggested, with oral first then plugging as a redose, since I'm not sure how my body will handle plugging.  You have any band suggestions? I'm working on a playlist for the roll."
MDMA,3dw2ul,mollyanalyst,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:11 2015 UTC,"Awesome! No, I don't have any suggestions as I am not super into the scene.

MDMA,3dwvgk,mollyanalyst,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:16 2015 UTC,"Two good nights probably depleted your body's normal levels of serotonin. It takes a normal person 3-5 days to replenish your levels again. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables (smoothies work the best), and try to get 8-10 hours of sleep with some exercise to speed up the process. You should be fine within 3 days I'd say."

MDMA,3dv1i4,MagicSmashDrugs,2,Mon Jul 20 01:25:32 2015 UTC,"I still get tingles listening to certain songs almost a year after. Also it really did help me deal with processing the grief of my mother dying when I was only 22. I haven't had any this year either so it's not like I do it that often.   You are right though, in a recreational setting it won't drastically change who you are or magically fix problems."
MDMA,3dv1i4,choppysmash,2,Mon Jul 20 01:35:33 2015 UTC,"yeah i get that with the songs from my peak moments. I have a playlist called afterglow with just these songs from my rolls and what not. Ehhh I find that in a recreational setting like a music festival i still have a lot of time talking and thinking tjat I still have moments that affect how I am as a person in the short-term midterm. Yeah It can definitely help with major issues however, if you're mostly happy you're or average its not going to make you happy just from one experience in the long-term"

MDMA,3dw13m,tombstoneci7y,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:22:45 2015 UTC,MDMA works by releasing serotonin. The vast majority of the body's serotonin is made in your gut so taking too much MDMA will cause you to vomit. Try lowering your dose.
MDMA,3dw13m,hithere5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:46:43 2015 UTC,"It isn't that unusual -- I've seen it happen in clinical MDMA studies after doses 1.5 mg/kg or lower.    That being said, what you experienced sounds late to be an acute MDMA effect and nausea and vomiting can be a symptom of hyponatremia (too low salt in blood, a known serious risk from MDMA that mostly affects women).  So I would keep an eye out for other symptoms of hyponatremia and would hydrate with something other than pure water, such as sports drinks, coconut water, or something else with dissolved ions."
MDMA,3dw13m,MBaggott,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:38 2015 UTC,"I've also had this a few times on the comedown, especially if I redosed that night. It sucks, especially because it happens so fast, one moment your fine, a second later you feel something is wrong, 2 seconds later you vomited and you feel totally fine again afterwards. I think it has something to do with parasympathetic serotonin receptors on your stomach."
MDMA,3dw13m,phacid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:27:18 2015 UTC,"ah okay i see, thanks. yeah it was awful because i had come down and just wanted to sleep but it was really violent vomiting but i had nothing in my stomach so it was really painful. i think it could have been the redose maybe?"
MDMA,3dw13m,phacid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:30:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah most likely, try taking an antacid or something and see if that helps next time."

MDMA,3dwayq,hithere5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:06:20 2015 UTC,"No one knows what the most important thing to take is.  There is some animal research and rationale supporting most of the recommendations in the sidebar (one exception is grapefruit juice, which I think doesn't have a good scientific basis).  But there are no good human studies and the human pattern of long-term occasional use may have different effects than the single binge usage patterns the rats get.    Alpha lipoic acid and ALCAR (Acetyl-l-carnitine) are two that have been directly studied and shown to decrease MDMA neurotoxicity when injected into rats and are now often recommended as part of harm reduction efforts.   They should probably be on your short list.    I am also interested in the potential of SSRIs taken at the comedown and sildenafil (Viagra) taken a day before MDMA, but I think those both need more research."
MDMA,3dwayq,MBaggott,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:27:59 2015 UTC,I rolled over the the grocery store and found magnesium (for the clenching) and 5-htp for serotonin regeneration.

I do not suggest this to anyone, but consider that my cannabis consumption is very high even now, the cannabis thing may have something to it. Still would not recommend it; it eventually affected my abiility to deal with stress in undesirable ways so I now use it much less frequently."

We still talk fondly of that night and how fast it flew by, just the two of us sitting on his apartment floor, cuddling and kissing but mostly just talking.

MDMA,3duoab,BobbleheadDoll,2,Sun Jul 19 17:33:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true, yesterday was my first time in over two months (not that long) but I definitely felt that.   Doesn't help i'll be rolling at HARD in two weeks"

MDMA,3duoab,rollingaroundphilly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah. That's good. I lost the magic years ago and haven't tried since. It's a shitty feeling to chase the magic and having it always within arm's reach. If I could constantly be rolling, I would. And that's what I tried to do every weekend years ago. I don't recommend it."
MDMA,3duoab,whatislife232,2,Sun Jul 19 18:15:36 2015 UTC,"Advice I always take for sure man, here in socal it's super easy to get and so many events are here.. makes it easy to do it every weekend if you wanted too"
MDMA,3dsnah,thyaway,20,Sun Jul 19 01:54:12 2015 UTC,"I feel precisely the same. Im glad someone else feels this way too. I felt sort of pathetic explaining this to my boyfriend, who himself, to me, is a social masterpiece naturally. I dont think he can really grasp how the hell I find people so scary.   I have pretty bad social anxiety, I find it hard to know what to say to people and often feel disliked by new people because of this. But on MDMA, I have this crystal clear mind, I know exactly what to say to people because I'm no longer worried if what I say is interesting enough or funny enough. And because of this, what I say is ALWAYS interesting enough and funny enough. I feel like a fucking social superstar on MD and I love it. I never want the feeling to go away.   As you said, the fact that this version of you comes out when rolling, it must exists within you naturally. Although I genuinely believe I will never reach the stage where my mind will be clear and care free when interacting with people, I do believe MD helped me not worry as much about whether I am liked or not in everyday life.  I get pretty sad comparing the person I to the person I am on MD. The version of me could become anything they wanted. I wouldnt be afraid of anything."
MDMA,3dsnah,ginklet,5,Sun Jul 19 04:20:06 2015 UTC,"idk if you're willing to hear someone else's perspective, but I wouldn't give up on that version of you. Maybe try to shift your view from thinking of it like transforming from how you currently are into a different form, and see it more like trying to clear away things that stop you from being how you could be? Ahhh this is totally unsolicited advice it's just that the contrast between saying you ""feel like a fucking social superstar"" and then saying you genuinely believe you can't reach that stage otherwise makes me sad :( I wish I could help somehow"
MDMA,3dsnah,darknorth,2,Sun Jul 19 04:57:33 2015 UTC,"So much this! I have the exact same ""problems"" as I'm never sure about what to talk about with new people and in the end I'm being silent... But on MDMA, BÄM, no problem! I dont mind how I dance, I dont mind how I come across, I'm becoming Me 2.0!  Sometimes though I ask myself if they notice me being on something, but that thought never lasts long.  As a friend puts it, the art is to become like this without rolling."
MDMA,3dsnah,ComradeCatilina,8,Tue Jul 21 01:05:17 2015 UTC,"The drug does make one feel this way, but combined with DBT therapy like in Alicia Danforth, PhD's current work, those effects and feeling can last beyond the acute effects.

Surely you will not start treating them differently after toxins wear off.   And when you hang around people you've tripped with comfortably, you'll be yourself all the time even in the presence of unfamiliar faces.  i think"
MDMA,3dsnah,mdmax_i,5,Sun Jul 19 07:24:30 2015 UTC,"100% agree. Some of my best friends I met at a festival rolling. We kept in touch afterwards and despite living two states away we all get together at least once a month. I have never bonded with people so quickly.

MDMA,3dsnah,psychedelic_dude,2,Sun Jul 19 02:51:45 2015 UTC,"I can definitely relate. I feel like it's almost a privilege to have experienced what it's like to be the person I want to be through MDMA. What's really helped me is taking time to reflect on my thoughts and actions, always making sure that what I'm thinking and doing are in line with the person I want to become. Honestly, yoga has really helped me get to a really good place. I leave every session feeling really centered and like I can just build up positivity from that stable base.   Try to keep in mind that this is all a process, and have respect for your own process and the time it takes you to get where you want to be :)"

MDMA,3dur5f,lolimfalling,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:31:13 2015 UTC,"145 should be a fine dose, I wouldn't be concerned about that being too much"
MDMA,3dur5f,Salvyana420tr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:17:43 2015 UTC,"Your dose will not be too high for a first time. Too high for a first time is more in the range of 180-200+. 140 will give you a nice pleasant roll while 160 would give you a heavier (and more enjoyable in my opinion) roll.  Its about personal preference, but messing with numbers between 140-160 is never going to ruin your experience by being ""too much"".  If I were you i would do 120 mg + 50mg an hour or two in to make the come-up more stable while keeping to roll heavy, but i like my rolls heavy so again personal preference."
MDMA,3dv1uy,stormz13,4,Sun Jul 19 19:22:05 2015 UTC,"Alcohol dulls the MDMA's effects, if you insist on drinking most people, including myself, advice to keep it at a minimum. Think like 2-3 beers. Alcohol can help with the pre-roll jitters making you more relaxed but anything above slightly tipsy dulls the roll. Alcohol also dehydrates you so that's another concern as MDMA dehydrates you even more - which is why you should definitely avoid drinking alcohol on MDMA!"
MDMA,3dv1uy,suche1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:32:27 2015 UTC,"good to know,thanks for fast answer tho  ill keep drinks at minimum,1-2 beers will be enough  also first two times i took it without knowing anything about it(or minimal knowledge) and the more i read about mdma the more i wanna know less and just enjoy it"

MDMA,3dv1uy,psychedelic_dude,2,Sun Jul 19 22:59:45 2015 UTC,"even my favourite drinks taste like absolute ass when rolling. but i usually have a beer or two before to help with my nerves. stupidly i have been wasted and then dropped once before, was stuck in that inbetween comeup and peak stage, never really reached the peak so would not reccomend drinking much at all so you can get maximum enjoyment :)"
MDMA,3duptw,videodude316,3,Sun Jul 19 17:40:36 2015 UTC,"Was it really hot? Humid? Did you drink anything during or just before the roll (caffeine or energy drinks to be specific)?  What /u/BobbleheadDoll said would basicly make your roll faster not longer. Make sure the caps are secured, try to eat a little closer to the roll (still, don't eat anything too heavy or dont drink caffeine or acidic drinks).  What was your redose amount btw?>"
MDMA,3duptw,Salvyana420tr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:25:04 2015 UTC,"All good points, and thank you for filling me in on the knowledge about Tums."
MDMA,3duptw,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:27:05 2015 UTC,"It was an indoor show so yes it did get pretty hot in the crowd. About an hour before the roll I drank a large powerade and about 2 shots of vodka in a cherry limeade. during the roll, ~2 bottles of water and half of a Gatorade. Redose amount was half of the original so ~65mg an hour and a half after the original dose. I've been taking magnesium and ALA supplements all week. Should be noted that the night before my roll I only slept about 6 hours and I had been awake for 14 hours before dropping. I'm assuming this may have an affect on the come down severity as well. Caps contained small crystals, not fine powder. I popped mine open before swallowing."
MDMA,3duptw,Salvyana420tr,4,Mon Jul 20 01:17:58 2015 UTC,"OK so,  -Hot indoor shows increase the blood flow, if you think the mdma is the fuel; you will burn through it faster (harder roll, shorter duration)  -I never mix strong alcohols with MDMA, it makes the roll rather unpredictable (not remembering, too mild/strong rolls, too many ups and downs etc). Couple beers is always enough to get the slight alcohol buzz.  -If i were you id do 120mg+80mg, 65mg really is a small amount to really give a strong push and im assuming you are not overweight by any means if 130 gets you going and gets you going strong.  -Lack of sleep and tiredness does explain the harsh comedown but has nothing to do with how hard you rolled.  -If they are actual edible caps that are made to dessolve slowly in your digestive system, don't de-cap before swallowing. That's why bombing is done as it is as well, first reason is you don't want crystals sticking to your throat but another resaon is you want to keep the substance together and isolated as much as you can so it doesn't dessolve all over the place in your stomach where there is a lot of acid that is also bad for MDMA. Another proof that swallowing with capsules is great is the fact that plugging works so well, you want the substance in your intestines rather then your stomach."
MDMA,3duptw,PixelLight,2,Mon Jul 20 01:32:31 2015 UTC,"Dude, thank you so much for taking the time to write all that out. There's a ton of valuable knowledge in there and I so appreciate it. I'll make sure to, 1) not drink next time (especially with a mixer as acidic as limeade), 2) swallow the gel capsule whole, 3) sleep more, and 4) redose heavier."
MDMA,3duptw,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:41:59 2015 UTC,You don't really say when you came down. Roll should be 3 to 5 hours.  Try using tums
MDMA,3duptw,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:04:28 2015 UTC,"Crush the crystal into a fine powder next time to parachute. Take tums. Use a supplement guide. Also, next time, redose shortly after you come up, around the 60 minute mark."

I'm not saying I'm some heavy weight beast, but that is just my experience. In clarification for my last tesla roll, it lasted 3.5 hours as opposed to my usual 4-6 hours. I bought it from a stranger cause mine got taken my security so I didn't test it (dumb I know). The comeup was... Different. I felt super hot and extremely sober. It felt like a completely different roll. No euphoria, not much dancing, not much energy."
MDMA,3dthal,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:41:53 2015 UTC,"Doesn't sound like ecstasy. But if this was a second-day roll, then that might be the reason. Try to stick with the rolling once every 3 months rule."

So I wouldn't recommend it. Also side note, I took about a 2 month break and dropped again, the magic was back luckily :). Now going on a 3 month break.

I'm guessing it depends on your metabolic rate and how quickly the drug can be absorbed by your body, and if you had eaten a meal prior.   Little anecdote but I had a friend try for his first time and it didn't hit him til +2:30 after dropping. We dropped for a show  and the entire show ended before he felt effects. He still enjoyed it though, just not in the desired setting lol"
MDMA,3dtp3d,euro_bangers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:55:27 2015 UTC,"Ya this has definitely happened to me. Depends on what you ate earlier that day. MDMA on an empty stomach will get you really high but can make you nauseous. On a full stomach.....it can take a couple hours. Even if you haven't eaten in a while your body might just be holding food in your stomach for the time being. Smoking weed can get your digestive track moving along, just like coffee and cigarettes.

A half pill did not get me to where I wanted to be the first time I tried them, the next time I tried them a whole pill did the trick.   If your tesla tested mdxx it is possible that is a copycat although I have not heard many reports of copycat teslas. They have been out long enough to where I would not be surprised though. The presser has already moved onto the snapchsts and starbucks. Teslas will soon be a thing of the past"

MDMA,3dtag3,Troyster143,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:29:11 2015 UTC,"Well a half is only 120mg of mdma, assuming the whole tesla is 240mg as its been tested. So you should have at least taken half and redosed with the other half at the 60 mins after the initial drop. It's not surprising you didn't peak after only 120mg, depending on your weight as well."
MDMA,3dtag3,_huckleberryfinn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:56:29 2015 UTC,"id like to point out that 1st batch teslas were tested up to ~250. since then there have been multiple batches, around 4 different shades & most likely were reduced in dosage. i would believe that some are raving teslas, &some are not because some are taking high dosed ills while other, with latter batches are getting below the 200 mark. either way, clean md & safe studies as always"
MDMA,3dtag3,depends_on_my_daiper,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:51 2015 UTC,"The Teslas are testing as 240mg of pure MDMA, which is a pretty massive dose for most people.

MDMA,3dt4vy,peonyourface,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:00:47 2015 UTC,"I went into it prepared for the worst. I froze water bottles (using these to keep beverages cold, and to cool artery sites such as inside wrists, jugulars and neck,back,and forehead), and chilled others (we dampened some bandanas with cold water to blot our faces and necks). Hydrated a lot before hand (eating fruits and veggies too!), ate a hearty, yet light meal. Packed Gatorade (you need electrolytes too- not just water) and a naked smoothie. I followed the suggested vitamin regimen on roll safe. We stayed out of the sun as much as we could and waited till 90 minutes before dark to dose.  We promised to keep an eye out for each other. We were dancing and my friend stopped and told me my hands were very hot. I hadn't noticed, but her telling me that made me aware to sit down and chill out for a minute. Making sure everyone in your group is aware of health implications, and aware enough to hold each other accountable is a huge plus.  Dress for the occasion. Pack for the occasion. Don't be afraid to ask a vendor for a piece of ice to cool your neck. Eat well and hydrate! It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be (and it was very hot!)- we just went into it with a conscious mind and we were fine!"
MDMA,3dt3fs,saltmens,2,Sun Jul 19 04:48:30 2015 UTC,MDMA is MDMA. There are no types. There is shit MDMA and good MDMA. No variants like with weed  Edit: There are doses which might help you kinda have the time you want. 80mg roll is different from a 200mg roll. Maybe you were referring to that?

I was 198, now i'm 172 when I took the tesla. I think it hit me a lot harder cause I was less, but I had also rolled the weekend before.   I recommend taking half, say it takes 45 min - 1hour to kick in, once you're peaking for about 15-30 minutes, if you can handle it take your second half.   By the time you're coming off the peak of the first half, the second will be kicking in so you're not chasing your roll. The tesla is strong but you just gotta stay up."

MDMA,3drk36,dopamingo,2,Sat Jul 18 21:33:11 2015 UTC,"Well, not necessarily. If it's brown and smells of safrole, it most likely has precursor residue. Pure MDMA is generally white crystals, although I agree you still can't be 100% sure if it has impurities."
MDMA,3drk36,kiggidykog,2,Sat Jul 18 21:39:05 2015 UTC,I think that's perfectly fine. My normal dose is usually ~150 mg with a 50-70 mg redose. I haven't lost any magic yet! But I also take a few supplements prior/after.

MDMA,3dqnyw,Hot_Soups_China,2,Sat Jul 18 14:54:25 2015 UTC,You did 200mg. The half-life for MDMA is 9 hours. The threshold for failure on DoD-administered tests is 500ng.  According to the math:  Rate of decay = ln(1/2)/9 = -0.077  500 = 200000000e^(-0.077t)  t = 167 hours = 6.9 days   It should take about 6.9 days for you to be able to pass. You've given yourself somewhere between 7-8 days so you should be okay although it's cutting it pretty close.

MDMA,3dqlim,Troyster143,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:28:15 2015 UTC,"Try it out an see how it goes. But, if you are going to be taking a lot of MDMA in the first place, the initial dose is where you want a lot. So why not try 2/3 at first and then 1/3 later? That would be super strong and would correspond to the redose being half of the initial dose."
MDMA,3dqlim,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:28:44 2015 UTC,Ok I think 3/4 then 1/4 redose sounds good! So that would be around 180mg to start then a 60mg redose assuming the pill is 240mg whole
MDMA,3dqlim,BobbleheadDoll,2,Sat Jul 18 15:44:18 2015 UTC,"Okay. That will definitely be intense. Have you taken doses like that before? 2/3 of a pill would be 160 mg, which is pretty strong, too."
MDMA,3dqlim,BobbleheadDoll,2,Sat Jul 18 15:46:11 2015 UTC,"No I've only taken 120mg initial. Probably smarter to drop half, 120mg, then redose with a quarter, 60mg. So a total of 180mg, sound more reasonable, I definitely don't want to get floored to the point where I don't remember the night"
MDMA,3dqlim,BobbleheadDoll,2,Sat Jul 18 15:50:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah. What is your weight in kg? And how did the 120 mg make you feel? If you think you can go stronger, then you can take a little bit more than half."
MDMA,3dqlim,n1ll0,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:52:42 2015 UTC,"86kg, 5'11"". The 120mg gave me a decent come up that was intense but passes in a few minutes, I think I could probably handle a little more for the initial. I'm an everyday weed smoker so I have some experience with the feeling of my body and mind being altered."
MDMA,3dqlim,Nintra,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:54:49 2015 UTC,"Okay. So 120 mg is about 1.40 mg/kg, which is actually fairly low--at least that's a low dose according to some other users. You could try stepping it up comfortably all the way up to 2 mg/kg, which should be pretty intense. So, take anywhere between 1.40 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg, or 120 mg and 172 mg. This translates into between 1/2 and 3/4 of a pill (assuming 240 mg)."
MDMA,3dqlim,Nintra,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"i'd say you'll prolly be good, but depending on the exact dosage, it might get a little intense/weird near the end.. lol I ate half of one of those and then a quarter to redose and i was pretty faced.. but if you wanna go hard it'll just be a bit more intense with the whole other half  EDIT: I'm about your same size and build also"

MDMA,3doxzl,RuralKansas,5,Sat Jul 18 01:40:10 2015 UTC,"If you follow the MDMA supplementation guide  you can probably avoid a bad comedown all together as long as you don't roll more than once a month.   My girlfriend and I never have a bad come down and follow that guide religiously  Besides that, I was in the same situation.  My girlfriend had never done a drug in her life but after a lot of effort, I got her to try MDMA because I really wanted to share it with her.  Since the first time, we've been doing it every 1-3 months  Same environment as you.  At home, cuddling/making out/whatever, music, etc  The supplement guide is the best advice I can give to any roller.  Not just to prevent comedowns but to protect your brain.  Other advice...  Give him something to chew on.  A lot of people use gum or a pacifier but I just chew on a blanket or shirt.  Most people, especially newcomers don't even realize they are clenching their jaw  A lot of people vomit on the come up.  If he starts feeling nauseated, just tell him don't worry about it, throw up, he won't lose/waste the drug and he'll feel good afterwards  Set up a playlist with XBMC or milkdrop for cool visualizations.  Alternatively, you could just youtube milkdrop, mute it but play the visuals, and play your own playlist in the background  Misc stuff:  massages, shower, lotion/oil, menthol (vicks vapo rub), viagra if you want him to be able to get it up for some sexy fun time while rolling (highly recommended)  I don't think either of you have much to be anxious about.  As long as your molly isn't cut to crap with other substances, and you control the dosage, it's not like shrooms or acid, or even a super paranoid weed high, where you can go out of your mind and do something stupid, especially considering you'll be at home.  Relax and enjoy, being too anxious about it will probably be more of a buzzkill than anything else"
MDMA,3doxzl,mdmacaber,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:15:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much!  I have never come across that guide before and I'm so happy you shared it with me. :) this will definitely help. All your suggestions sound great too. I honestly didn't think about the chewing issues because my own experience any my friends' experiences with jaw clenching weren't that bad, but it could be different for my bf.   As far as sex, I've done it while rolling with my ex. Surprisingly didn't need Viagra (though I hear most do) but it was too intense for me. I'm not sure if I'll try that again.   I know I'm probably just being paranoid so thank you for all your reassurance!"
MDMA,3doxzl,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:54:56 2015 UTC,"The important question is, does he want to roll because you want to roll with him or because he wants to roll for his own reasons?   Does your boyfriend have any pre-existing mental health conditions (e.g., social anxiety)? You should ask him about this, especially considering you said his mood is sometimes unpredictable. See if he is taking any medication.  Save the 5-HTP for after the roll.  Otherwise, if you both want to roll, don't worry about it! You guys will have each other, especially during the comedown (him holding you will be better than watching any sad movie!). Try to give your boyfriend somewhere between 1.5 and 1.75 mg/kg dosage. It seems like you know how to dose for yourself. And don't forget to test your stuff.  Once you decide to roll together, set up tentative activities for the night but don't commit yourselves to doing any of them (though, I suggest putting back massages and couple's showers at the top of the list!). Just roll with the punches. :)"
MDMA,3doxzl,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:09:36 2015 UTC,"You've brought up some very important points!   I'm pretty sure that my bf wants to because he brought it up. He doesn't smoke weed or drink because he doesn't enjoy either. I think he's interested in rolling because I've told him about how my first time was the happiest moment of my life. I truly do want him to feel what I felt but I also know that he wants to feel that way as well.   As for the dosage, that's exactly what I was thinking. Im used to about 3mg for an alright roll, but I don't like to exceed that or the comedown is too much, so I was thinking about giving him half of that. Thanks so much for all the tips!"
MDMA,3doxzl,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:00:10 2015 UTC,"I think you mean 300 mg. If you mean 3 mg/kg, then that means the dosage is 3 times your body weight in kg. By the way, 300 mg is a lot, unless you mean splitting that up over the night (e.g., 150 mg + 150 mg 60 minutes later)."

I'm really not sure the difference between them all though  Maybe, I'll try that next time. I've only ever done 2cb twice, the first time with a pill that was sold as 10mg (purple mushroom) and the only thing I felt was the phone thing that was previously mentioned. So I thought I'd up the dosage quite a lot this time (17mg is almost double the first time I took it) in the hope that I'd feel it more but evidently not until I redosed.

MDMA,3dot4m,BobbleheadDoll,3,Sat Jul 18 01:08:20 2015 UTC,Not sure. But having seizures is not normal and deserves to be checked out.
MDMA,3dot4m,cc0891,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:13:46 2015 UTC,"How much sleep had you gotten the night before? Were you hungover? These factors can trigger a seizure in those susceptible. Unfortunately, it sounds like you may have a preexisting neurological condition that either coincidentally showed itself while you were rolling, or the roll itself pushed your brain over the edge to trigger the seizures. Although it is bizarre that the doctor said you could have experienced kidney failure - as far as I know, this is not typical in cases of seizures due to epilepsy.  Next time, I would recommend that you make sure you are well rested the night before rolling (8-9 hours) and take no more than 200 mg total throughout the night just to be safe. During my 10th roll, I got cocky and took waaay too much - about 400 mg of pure MDMA over an 8 hour period - and stayed up until the sun came out. Upon closing my eyes to go to sleep, I experienced strange hallucinations and was talking in my sleep. Then, I had my very first grand mal seizure. After some tests and visits with the neurologist, turns out I have a form of epilepsy called JME that had been dormant until this episode. Furthermore, he believes the MDMA had absolutely nothing to do with triggering the seizure, and that it was the sleep deprivation instead. Since then, I have made sure to get a good night's rest every night before rolling, cut back on binge-drinking; and have taken MDMA another 8 times with no problems yet. It has been over a year since my first seizure. Don't give up hope, and please see a neurologist! :)"

MDMA,3dnjei,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:44:23 2015 UTC,What do you do for redosing ?
MDMA,3dnjei,BobbleheadDoll,2,Fri Jul 17 19:47:43 2015 UTC,Redose only once with half of your initial dose 60 - 90 minutes after you drop your initial dose.
MDMA,3dnjei,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:50:59 2015 UTC,By parachuting it again ?
MDMA,3dnjei,goawaywhatsapp,2,Fri Jul 17 19:58:00 2015 UTC,"Yes. Or plugging it. You could even try snorting some of it, because the only dose that matters the most is your first dose--like an all or none thing."

This is PURELY anecdotal but my friend told me Atarax (hydroxyzine) boosts MDMA a lot, nearly to the point of being dangerous. I don't know how accurate this is but he told me he had taken 4 pills of MDMA with 2 pills of Atarax which nearly resulted in a heart failure, his friend actually dying from it. But,""It should be safe if you only take half a pill of Atarax with one dose of MDMA."" So he gave me half a pill and I've had it for over a year because I don't want to risk my health over one night of fun with MDMA...  But I dunno. Like I said, I have no research to back this up and I haven't even found anything online about combining hydroxyzine with MDMA. Maybe someone else could shed some light into this matter?"

Took the Zyrtec-D in the morning, so when I rolled in the evening it's probably a lesser effect but still active in my body. One of the active ingredients in allergy medication (Pseudoephedrine) is a vasoconstrictor, so it can potentially be harder on your heart when combined with MDMA. That being said, a regular dose of MDMA is probably okay, based on my experience (100mg-150mg).  Do you know what medication you're taking?"

I mean, I agree that there will always be people who completely ignore the plethora of safe dosage materials out there--look alone at the people who take that much and more on this subreddit--but if something came prepackaged with a more correct dose, there's an increased likelihood that people won't overdose unknowingly. Also, legalization = less stigma = more opportunities to learn about safe dosage, just like with alcohol."

So, just as pretey much everybody who is not a small child knows that taking a whole packet of paracetamol is dangerous and potentially lethal, I am dreaming of the day when it will be just common knowledge that taking a whole ""packet"" of MDMA capsules is dangerous and potentially lethal."
MDMA,3di1x2,jimitri,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:19:41 2015 UTC,"Big difference between for example paracetamol and alcohol is that alcohol reinforces redosing, the more you drink the more you want to drink.

MDMA,3di1x2,phacid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:59:30 2015 UTC,"In my experience regulated substances (alcohol, tobacco) were harder to get, as a minor, than ecstasy or any hard drug because there is no money to be made in it.

No. .5 grams is several times more than anyone should take, especially someone who (I presume from the age and photos) was much smaller than most people because it wnt provide any additional positive effects and would create lots of nasty side effects, but thats still probably a lot less than what it would take to kill even a very small person unless something medically weird was going on.  I have known people to take that amount (god knows why) without doing any damage. The article doesn't specify what it was cut with or how she died exactly."
MDMA,3di1x2,critropolitan,3,Fri Jul 17 01:16:57 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that she is 1. A girl 2. 15 years old and 3. Skinny and short (from the pics). I'm pretty sure that half a gram is a trip to the hospital for her, and if you have bad luck yes even death. Also she didn't take it 'over 2 hours'. She died 2 hours after taking it so I assume she dropped half a gram in one drop. MDMA is not as safe as you potray it to be. BTW 500mg is 2,5x the 'heavy' dose on erowid. Not something a 15 year old girl without any tolerance should take. I was blown of my socks my first time with 100mg and I was 18, I'm male, 175cm tall, and I had some light stim tolerance."

Then again, she apparently did her research so who knows? Teens drink too much alcohol and that comes with ""dosage"" information of sorts (percentages/proof/units etc).  Either way I think it's a good cause for the mother to be fighting."

Half a gram in a 15 year old girl that is skinny and short from what I see from the pics is going to be a trip to the hospital even if it was like 70-80% pure.

MDMA,3di1x2,hithere5,5,Fri Jul 17 01:36:39 2015 UTC,"This is why we need better drug education.   According to chemistry MDMA can't be more than 84% pure.   Unless you're in northern europe, MDMA is always referred to in hcl form. 100% pure mdma exists and it refers to 84% freebase mdma plus 16% salt.    The LD50 of MDMA is 80mg/kg of bodyweight.   Can't find a source for the forum post but I'm assuming that's referring to rats. You just can't transfer those values and apply it to humans. Dosages that would kill rats would not necessarily kill humans and vice versa. I can assure you, that a 12kg human child would not be fine with 1/2gram of MDMA."

It is very rare but it exists. Also the LD50 is the dose half the people die, it's an average. This is a girl, 15 years old, skinny and short with no tolerance. What would you expect with 2,5x times the 'heavy' dose on erowid? Also, pure MDMA has a white/off white color. The brown color comes from additives.

Look at yourselves in the mirror with strobe lights. Set up the strobe lights around the area.  Take a shower together (again, depending on who you are with) or go swimming (careful here).  Pass around some lotion.  Make each other feel like you are floating: have each person grab the limb of the luck E-tard. Lift the person up and slowly lay them back down.

MDMA,3dk9y2,Spinster444,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:34:47 2015 UTC,yeah im confident its gonna be fine.  I wanted to take about 150mg but im sure ill be able to get another .1 to split with my friend in time. Gonna to be at an EDM show tomorrow night. Should be fun. I'll update a few days after.
MDMA,3dk9y2,Spinster444,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:10:06 2015 UTC,Well i took it and it was honestly underwhelming. I felt something but the effects werent that strong and i ended up consuming alcohol as well. Not really sure what went wrong or why it didnt hit me too hard. I crushed it up and parachuted it.
MDMA,3dk9y2,Spinster444,2,Mon Jul 20 01:31:56 2015 UTC,Alcohol kills rolls
MDMA,3dhx27,Leatherpig,4,Thu Jul 16 12:22:36 2015 UTC,"The optimal dose of pure MDMA would be about 100-120mg and a re-dose of about half that 60-120 minutes in.  Given the fact that you wont have pure MDMA, you'll need more.  Most MDMA should be around 65-90% pure.   If you assume a purity of 80% then a dose of 125-150mg with a 60-75mg redose should do the trick.   Also, make sure what you have is actually MDMA and not something else. Methylone is often sold as MDMA and is basically only half as potent on a mg basis with a shorter duration as well."
MDMA,3dhx27,Morthyl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:29:09 2015 UTC,Basically what this guy is saying. You just need to take a higher initial dose.

MDMA,3dhx27,gixxerfanatic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:25:10 2015 UTC,"130 and 70 redose about 90 mins is a good jumping off point if you want to have a largish chunk of time legit rolling. One point usually brings past threshold but underwhelming, above 250 and you start to get into the realm of more annoying side effects"
MDMA,3dj5wm,NotFAKEbutREALbeef,2,Thu Jul 16 18:18:53 2015 UTC,"i used the suggested supplements the last time i rolled. i didnt do them exactly as listed as 1.) some of my supplements were a lower strength then suggested 2.) i didnt want to take that many vits in to a club with me.  But i really think it helped. The main thing was i pissed like a race horse during the roll. so i feel that allowed a lot of toxins to leave my body, i slept better and felt better the next day. Still had the Jaw tensing problem but not quite as bad.  will always use vitamins from now on."

And I do the full blown regime by using packs from ravesafer  I think it mellows the jitteryness of mdma a little bit, but all of the love, empathy, emotion is still there and the come down is virtually non-existent.  If I roll all through the night on a saturday, don't go to sleep till late sunday, I'm back up at work monday 100%.  That would never happen to me before supplementation.  I roll maybe every 3 months, I've supplemented my last 7 rolls, and I've supplemented my last 4 rolls with ravesafer.  I've been toying with the idea of not supplementing my next one just to see if its not just all in my head haha"

I think your brain need a rest and to recover a little bit  I wanna point out that the I have rolled in the last months (5months) in a row once per month , however everything went fine, even I would say better than past experiences with the same dose 180mg, 90mg redose 1h.30min later  I am feeling same effects didnt lost any "" magic "" you know is summer... and well 1 time per month I gotta do it   After summer gotta take longer breaks.  I hope you could be rolling back asap  Cheers"

MDMA,3dhpcu,psychedelic_dude,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:18:56 2015 UTC,"There is NO cross tolerance between 2CB and MDMA, both act on serotonin receptors however is a different mechanism  And I can say its true since I tested it, taking 2CB and 1 week earlier and then MDMA and all went fine no tolerance between :) great roll as always  Btw how your 2CB trip was ? Dose ?  I just took it 3 weeks ago for the first time 22mg and was pretty nice, the colors very intesify  and the walls moving... was a nice trip but I really expected a little bit more."
MDMA,3dhpcu,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:23:10 2015 UTC,"It's was interesting, I bought it off a Dutch guy who I befriended who said the dose was 20mg (pill form). Since it was my first time I halved the pill with my girlfriend. The experience was more like the truffles you get in Amsterdam, no major visuals but everything seems brighter and things start to become wavy when staring at them. My girlfriend really enjoyed it but I don't think it was the kind of experience I was wanting being in a club. It kind of made me quite sleepy but I think that was probably due to the fact we had been out all day walking.  I'd definitely do it again except take 15mg this time and possibly take it as a top up when doing MDMA instead of redosing with more MDMA."

MDMA,3dh3pd,long_live_mcqueen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"No, the only thing he takes is Synthroid because he had cancer years ago and had radiation which fucked up his thyroid.

My best guess is he tried over 4 days straight with gradually larger doses. So I'm thinking maybe he built up a tolerance over the days even without experiencing anything but a ""slight change in scenery"" and sort of grinding his teeth. No classic roll signs besides that. And you know it the first time you roll, right?   It's also weird because he doesn't get high off of smoking weed either. Edibles are TBD though.  Next month we're going to a festival and we are going to start him out on a higher dose."

After the 2nd re dose you will have completely run out of serotonin so the next bombs will just act like speed. I'd recommend just chilling for the first 6 hours then rolling for the next. Or perhaps dropping, coming up, then fully comedown before residing 4 hours later which might do something"

MDMA,3dhmje,IAMA_monkey,2,Thu Jul 16 12:36:47 2015 UTC,"You're not going to get much help in response to a roll that length on mdma on here. To attempt that it'd be pretty reckless and most people on here try to get encourage people to do minimal neurotoxic damage. That said I've tried to do around about an 8 hour roll the other week (starting at 10pm and finishing at 6am) I did 100mg at 10pm, 100mg at 10.45, 200mg at about 12.30, 200mg at about 2-3am. The final 200mg did almost nothing except make me feel cracked out for like an hour and I had to sit down doing nothing except feeling pretty fucked but not in the usual great way. At about 4am I felt pretty much sober just exhausted and my jaw was still going  We went for a walk up to a nice viewing spot and sat around for 2 hours just enjoying the view until we had to leave at 6am. I felt alright the next day, as bad as you usually do on mdma and got a comedown 4 days later, had a bit of a bout of depression for 2-3 days and then I've been fine and dandy since  That said there was a girl I was with who's not as experienced as me with MDMA. She started at 9pm taking 100mg, then at about 12pm taking 100mg, then about 2am taking 100mg and she said she felt up the entire 9 hours so fuck knows how that worked out. Personally I've never had a roll last than 6 hours though no matter how much MDMA I take  All the MDMA was in 200mg Blue Teslas so if I say 200mg I meant a whole Blue Tesla and if I said 100mg I meant half a Blue Tesla *Estimated times as I was too fucked to care about the time  On the subject of Acid, if you're going to a festival do not do it for the first time there. I'd strongly recommend trying it at home first, it's a wholeee other beast compared to MDMA and shouldn't be treated lightly. That said Acid and MDMA work well together, take LSD first (as it lasts around 12 hours) and then MDMA about 3 hours into the trip and it's meant to be fantastic. You don't want to do that before trying out acid for the first time in a safe enviroment though"

MDMA,3dhmje,Winston_Sm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"Absolutely save the acid and don't just try it. It'll bite you and it'll bite you hard.   Take it in an environment in which you are safe. With safe people. Not many, you don't want to interact with sober people on the 'other side' much when you are tripping. Make sure to properly read up on it, also let your friends do it if you plan to take it with others.   I am more avid with LSD than with MDMA and I recently had a friend, very experienced MDMA user, meet his 'makers' as he described it on his first acid trip. He was not prepared at all that LSD to such a huge extend is not comparable with MDMA.  Make sure to visit /r/LSD, you find great support and tricks there. Safe journey!  edit: It's great together with MDMA, but you should be rather experienced with both substances to handle and more importantly time it well!"

MDMA,3dhmje,CosmicInput,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:55:54 2015 UTC,"As others have said probably not possible with MDMA alone, but you could try two redoses of MDMA and some 2C-B at the end? Haven't tried 2C-B in combination with MDMA myself, but I can see how it would work nicely to prolong your roll."

That wouod be absolutely amazing but your seratonin will be seriously depleted after 4-6 hours. Im assuming you will be at an all day/night event and in that case just enjoy yourself the first 4-5 hours then drop your mdma around that mark.  This is what I usually do at a festival. Good luck my friend and it is not advisable to keep redosing to chase that high, in my opinion I would take a single dose and then another redose about 90minutes in. Anything more than that willl be a waste of mdma imo.  Be safe dude and good luck on your upcoming roll!"

MDMA,3dg9jp,Ibfac,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:20:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's really strange. Try a supplement regime, like /u/Ibfac and the sidebar suggest--see how that works out. Also, make sure neither of you are taking other drugs or medications or supplements (5-HTP) prior to the roll.

MDMA,3dg9jp,snapple_cap_wisdom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:18:40 2015 UTC,I think our tolerances are pretty high.   How often do roll? What was the time between the 2 different scenarios?
MDMA,3dg9jp,d15b2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:12:31 2015 UTC,"We had been rolling a little more frequently than we'd like to because we were trying to hammer out the right dose.  So perhaps some tolerance stuff was going on.  I think it was a month in between the two scenarios, but it could have been as little as two weeks.  The second scenario was a month ago, and we were thinking of trying again this weekend.  I don't intend to keep up this rate in the future, but do you think once a month is quickly enough to raise tolerance?"
MDMA,3dg9jp,06ptp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:25:43 2015 UTC,"Yo! I've had this problem but think I've cracked it! The time between rolls shouldn't matter as long as it's over 3-4 weeks, especially if you're getting a good peak anyway. I honestly think it might be a case of just taking more. Trying taking around 200-250mg each for an initial dose, but then (this is the other thing) increase the ratio! So I would make the redose maybe 75% of the initial dose. So if you took 200mg initial dose, take 150mg redose. I really don't think that would be too much. Also, as I've found out the time between doses is very important. Imo the best time to redose is 1.25 hours (75 mins) after your first dose. One other thing I've found is that having a spliff when you start coming down helps to prolong the peak a bit (although not at its highest intensity) for about 45 mins to an hour. Anyway, hope this helps! Enjoy!"

Once we get the dosages correct, I plan to back off a good amount and only do it a couple times a year.  Maybe 4-5 times per year.  Do you think our tolerance was still up when rolling again a month later?"

"" I found out, for myself, that using MDMA more often than four times a year was not wise. I used MDMA as a writing drug for about a year. Once a week, I would do a great deal of writing using MDMA; it was a wonderful experience for me to use it that way, but I discovered after that kind of use that I had to go up in dosage to get an effect, and the effect became less and less the magical insight; it was more and more the stimulant effects, and for many years now, I have been totally unable to use it. Not only because now it is illegal, but because I used it once a week, and that was too often. Nobody knew that, then, but now I would advise anyone who wants to use MDMA not to take it more than 4 times a year if you want to continue to get the best effects from it, otherwise you risk losing its effects entirely and permanently.

MDMA,3dfijk,LeoBrZ81,2,Wed Jul 15 21:32:27 2015 UTC,"If i were you id choose 3-5 hours to roll each day...otherwise you are most certainly overdoing it just like you have done previously. Id start with 150-200 mg and redose with around 100 mg.  As for the supplements, ive heard both are good but to avoid ones containing 5-htp the day of the roll, as that can cause seratonin syndrome.  Happy rolling! :)"
MDMA,3dfijk,bellie24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:23:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying, man! So in your opinion, no second re-dose in a single day? And should I then not take the 5-htp supplement on Saturday night following Day 1 of the event (given that I plan on going again on Sunday)?"
MDMA,3dfijk,bellie24,2,Thu Jul 16 00:09:55 2015 UTC,"In my personal experience a second redose would do close to nothing. Plus, neurotoxicity skyrockets after every redose, its really not the safest to redose more than once.  And no, you should wait until monday to take the 5-htp!"
MDMA,3dfijk,IDrinkUrine,2,Thu Jul 16 17:57:33 2015 UTC,Do not take 5 htp within 12 hours of taking mdma. I would start taking it on Monday and not any before dropping.   If you plan on rolling two nights in a row eat serotonin producing foods on  Sunday. Bananas and avocados. It matters to make sure you get a good roll the 2nd night.  I personally  re dose 90 minutes after first dropping to extend my roll to the 7 hour mark. This is less healthy for you  I have no experience trying for 11 hours. Have been told if you drop 5 hours apart the second roll is not as good.

And he actually does share that information with me - and because of that it's not a big deal. In return I extend the same courtesy back to him, if I give a peck to my girlfriends while under the influence or hold someone's hand I will tell him that.  I don't know what to tell you though.

That's my honest personal perspective, without trying to justify anything in my favor.   If you don't mind me asking, has your BF actually cuddled with someone of the opposite sex when you were not present? What about you? Did you guys ever have issues about this early on in your relationship?  Thanks for your input suche. :)"
MDMA,3dem85,suche1,3,Thu Jul 16 00:06:48 2015 UTC,"I think you got your answer then :)  We both have had cuddles with someone else whilst rolling and we've always told each other almost immediately or as soon as we're able to. I think it's because of that, that we've always told each other, it's never been an issue to either one of us, not ever.   Then there would definitely be an issue if I didn't feel comfortable telling my SO that I'd cuddled with someone or if my SO didn't feel comfortable telling the same to me! I'd be more hurt about him not telling me rather than with the fact that he'd cuddled with someone, that's secondary. But that's just us and every relationship is different :) If you feel your GF would have a bigger issue with the cuddling aspect then you might be better off not telling her. Maybe you could bring it up as discussing about what's OK to do when rolling and what's not OK? Then you'll know what she's comfortable with and you'll know your limits for any future rolls."
MDMA,3dem85,Fbulol,4,Thu Jul 16 09:33:15 2015 UTC,"Don't let it bother you. It's fine, you controlled yourself and didn't take it further than what's innocent. This was a problem for me and my gf's relationship until we got more Now I can't comment on if you should tell her because I don't know if she's the type who understands rolling, or the rave/drug scene. Telling her could lead to trust issues if she's any bit insecure and doesn't understand."
MDMA,3dem85,lorelei722,3,Wed Jul 15 18:47:11 2015 UTC,"Well my question is has your gf ever rolled before ? I ask because I feel like she wouldn't understand the craving you get for human contact when you roll and would over react a bit about it if she's never experienced it herself . If she hasn't I don't feel it's imperative you tell her , I'm a pretty jealous girlfriend myself but since I know what it's life to roll I see this as pretty harmless . Hope I helped a little ."

If it's the real deal, and you make sure you stay hydrated during the roll, and you take all the supplements, and you have a couple of good friends to trip with that you trust, you will most likely have an amazing time."
MDMA,3dez1t,sweedsmoker,2,Wed Jul 15 19:35:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'll add I've had different experiences from the same batch before... sometimes the setting can make or break a roll.  @Op, if your head is in a good place, your gear is good (you have tested it, right?), you're with good friends and have good music to listen and dance to then you'll have a blast.  You may notice some anxiety after you drop while you're waiting to come up, and may even feel nauseous to start with... these are completely normal and pass very quickly. After about 30 - 45 mins you may start to notice the tips of your fingers feeling tingly - that's how I know I'm about to feel it. Again, don't fret about this as it's common and nothing to worry about.  The next few hours will be great. You'll feel very relaxed. You'll love your friends more than you already do... more than you think is possible. You'll even feel love towards strangers. You'll be unable to not dance to music, and if there are lights and lasers then they'll appear brighter and more colourful then you've ever seen them before.  Now the not-so-nice points that you should be aware of... firstly, you won't be able to pee during your roll, so don't bother until you feel like you're about to piss yourself. Also, you'll most likely feel the urge to chew something so have some gum with you... but try not to chew too hard or you'll regret it the following day when your jaw aches live you've never experienced before. Also, you're gonna sweat a lot - especially if you're dancing or in a hot venue. Drink water regularly to compensate for the fluids you'll lose through sweating... don't go overboard and drink bottles and bottles (I find one 500ml bottle per hour is good). You might notice your eyes wiggle a lot... just go with the flow if this happens. You'll also be unable to do basic things like sending a text message... although you may well try, and then cringe when you see the next day that you texted your mum, your gran and your next door neighbour telling them how much you love them.  Hope that helps. Enjoy it. Stay safe. You'll remember this experience for the rest of your life."

MDMA,3dcsr6,mdmaLion,8,Wed Jul 15 06:57:00 2015 UTC,personally I would skip the first dose. the dose is so small you risk not feeling it too well either way and in my passed experiences redosing more than once becomes a waste of MDMA. have a good time at the show! stay hydrated my friend :)
MDMA,3dcsr6,peonyourface,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:08:59 2015 UTC,This is the best response. You can even use that extra 50mg to either strengthen your first dose and/or your second dose. Or you can even snort 50 mg on a redose and tae the remaining 50 mg on the same redose.
MDMA,3dcsr6,BobbleheadDoll,2,Wed Jul 15 16:27:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the replies. I will do as you all say and skip the 50mg dose. Do you think I should drop waiting in line, or wait till I am inside?"
MDMA,3dcsr6,Fbulol,4,Wed Jul 15 10:18:27 2015 UTC,"Lol wtf who went thru and down voted all these posts? Anyway I time my rolls on who I want to hear the most. Depends on the show. Just know an oral dose takes allot an hour to fully hit. So drop T-60 mins from the act you want to roll to (whether it's the opener or headline). That drop will last about 3-4 hours so drop your reup about an hour before it comes down (so like 3 hours after the first drop). And as everyone else stated, go big for first dose then taper off for the reup"

MDMA,3dcsr6,aloofinecstasy,3,Wed Jul 15 13:33:26 2015 UTC,"The show is like 5:30 to 10:30 or 11 I think. Will dropping the re-dose 3 hours later make the roll feel more cracked out? It's kind of a short show I think, 5 hours. I figure drop 150mg when Im inside, and then an 60-90 mins later drop 50-100mg for my booster and call it good. Im just worried that since the headliner is last, I won't be feeling as good by the time they go on!"

But I'd say drop 150mg 45-60 minutes before the headliner, then another 50-100mg 30-45 mins after that first drop starts to hit you."

It won't be the same as the roll you had previously though, which could bum you out (leading to regret).  Moreover (and I've seen this happen to several friends) this could lead to you psycologically justifying you rolling twice again in quick succession in the future because you did it once and it worked, why not one last time? Ok one more time... I wonder if I can roll twice in a row? etc etc up until you get to the point where .3 barely makes you roll and you're wondering why it just doesn't feel the same anymore.  My advice? Just learn self control right now. There are so many other amazing drugs that are so much fun to be taken alone at a rave/show.

Other bad things is also that both substances increases heartrate and can cause heart problems.

You will be left with a very stimulated, though a bit less intense and trippy, MDMA high. Its likely that you will be able to sleep after that unless you go overboard with the amphetamine"

That being said never tried the combo"
MDMA,3d9vzj,mindmischief91,3,Tue Jul 14 17:10:52 2015 UTC,"Make sure to test it just so you have no doubt what you are taking, regardless of what people tell you it is.  I always make it a point to take it on an empty stomach which is usually at least 3 hours after my last meal. It's only because my come-ups are sometimes rough and make me queasy. I prefer to dry heave rather than vomit anything up. It also hits you harder or more efficiently.  You will be okay to roll in 45 days, minimum one month is recommended. I think anything over 150 is excess depending on the quality. The difference between 140 to 180 can be that you will be floored. You can redose half the initial dose but do it around an hour into the roll. There's a window of time where it can extend the roll but not by much so don't expect to roll hard for 8 hours. If you dose too late, your serotonin will already be depleted and you won't feel the roll, only jittery from an amphetamine high.  The way I look at it is that I choose a special event or time, about 5 hours where I want to roll. I share this moment with friends at a rave that I've been looking forward to for sometime. Just know what this drug is and what it does for you. It's easy to fall into a pattern of rolling so often especially when you first roll.  Good luck!"
MDMA,3d9vzj,keyed_yourcar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:54:24 2015 UTC,"Hello!  Thanks for your great advice! I still have some MDMA left from the first time, and I already tested it with Marquis (the only one I could get) so that isn't a problem :).  This time I will make sure to have my initial dose 3 or 4 hours after my last meal. Since it's not possible to be rolling during the whole event, I think I will drop it after a few hours have passed.   I'm really looking forward to this second time, since it's a big costume party with 50k people attending, and I'm going with lot of friends. After that, I will wait at least until my birthday, which is at the end of the year, so that would be a break of 4 months minimum.  I will be reporting back after my second time! :D"
MDMA,3d9vzj,keyed_yourcar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:07:09 2015 UTC,Awesome. Have a good time! I would chalk up your diminished roll to having ate just before dropping.
MDMA,3d9vzj,BackBreaker,2,Wed Jul 15 07:14:36 2015 UTC,"On top of taking it on an empty stomach I will also suggest this to have it hit you a lot faster; have some tums on hand.  2 or 3.  Take them 15 mins prior to dropping.   You see, stomach acids eat away at the MDMA (someone else can probably explain the science better then I can) but by popping a few tums beforehand I find it empties your stomach of the acids and it allows for more absorption of the MDMA.  Since I started doing that I've noticed my rolls have come on much quicker and harder.    Good luck"

If you roll at the voyage then the roll at hard will be lessened at hard or save it for hard and have the good roll there.

MDMA,3dbwbm,bunnydoctor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:28:50 2015 UTC,"Let me see if I can summarize my understanding of what you are saying.  If a reagent test says X is in your substance, it doesn't say anything about what else is in it.  Ultimately, all you can really know is a negative.  If a test is supposed to indicate X and it doesn't show positive, then you know you don't have X (or trace amounts)  So, in practical terms you could tell whether your MDMA has methylone in it.  Or you could tell whether it has some MDMA, but not know what else is in it.  Kind of sucks.  Lab tests are expensive and slow."

If a test is supposed to indicate X and it doesn't show positive, then you know you don't have X (or trace amounts)."" This is correct.  ""So, in practical terms you could tell whether your MDMA has methylone in it. Or you could tell whether it has some MDMA, but not know what else is in it."" That is also wrong. Reagent tests cannot tell if you have MDMA, Methylone or anything else. Reagent tests can tell if your supposed MDMA doesn't actually contain MDMA as its major ingredient. For example, if a Marquis reagent turns yellow, the substance in question does not contain MDMA as its major ingredient. A yellow Marquis result could be a whole host of drugs. By making guesses based on the fact that a drug sold as MDMA would probably have effects at least somewhat like MDMA, if a substance sold as MDMA turns yellow, thinking that it is really Methylone is a reasonable assumption. However, guesses based on what a substance is not are just that: guesses. A substance sold as MDMA that has a yellow result on the Marquis reagent could be a lot things, some of which could easily be lethal if consumed at MDMA-level doses. One example is MDPV, which is a powerful stimulant which can produce very strong effects at 10mg and has a threshold dose of about 1 mg. Taking 100mg+ of something like MDPV would certainly lead to a horrible death.  In addition to the above, reagents are nearly worthless when used on substances containing multiple drugs that react differently because one reaction may mask the other one. For example, a substance sold as MDMA which actually contains 5-10 percent of Amphetamine or Methamphetamine and 90-95 percent MDMA will likely be indistinguishable from a substance that only contains MDMA, because the MDMA's reaction will cover up the reaction of the Amphetamine or Methamphetamine.  ""Kind of sucks. Lab tests are expensive and slow."" I guess so, but I'd say that waiting a week and spending $50-$100 to have a substance analyzed beats the dangers of misidentified substances, which can cause severe injury or death if consumed."
MDMA,3dbwbm,bunnydoctor,2,Wed Jul 15 05:04:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for doing this.  I think a lot of people don't realize how all this works.  What do you think of ecstasydata.org?  They don't tell actual purity of anything, but they do tell you all  the active components of a substance."
MDMA,3dbwbm,bunnydoctor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:23:01 2015 UTC,I'd say that ecstasydata.org is safer than using reagents but not as accurate than a lab such as EnergyControl.
MDMA,3dbwbm,n1ll0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:24:25 2015 UTC,Doesn't ecstasydata.org use the same basic equipment?  They are just forbidden from reporting purity.  So it seems like the safety profile would be the same.  Let's say I got some MDMA that is cut with something benign.  ecstasydata.org would say MDMA is in at a ratio of 1 (meaning nothing else active).  EC would say it is 75% MDMA.    Obviously EC is better for getting my money's worth.  But both are equal at showing how safe I am.  The reason I ask is that ecstasydata.org seems a lot faster for people in the US.
MDMA,3dbwbm,BobbleheadDoll,2,Wed Jul 15 13:35:04 2015 UTC,except for the fact that EC's GCMS equipment is broken and they dont have enough money currently to fix it.. supposedly..

MDMA,3d9mbz,ClemHD,3,Tue Jul 14 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"Umm, that depends by how broad you take real house music as. I'm a huge New Order fan, or Kraftwerk, or loads of other things that I'd call 'electronic', but I'm not exactly sure where the genre boundaries lie. (I might sound like a complete idiot calling either of them electronic!)   So basically, yeah I don't really know. That's such a shit answer, sorry!

MDMA,3d9mbz,elderdabs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:25:03 2015 UTC,"Also, I think I'd prefer to roll to something lighter anyway. Even New Order are a bit heavy and I think that detracts from the roll a bit.

Rolling your first time is such a special moment that you will be remiss if you did not get to share that moment with at least one other person.  You can take a dose close to 2 mg/kg (close to 2 times your body weight in kilograms). Grab a test kit. Once you confirm you have MDMA, parachute your dosage. You will not need to redose."

MDMA,3d7uq7,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:12:59 2015 UTC,"It is difficult to put into words. Once you take it, you will know exactly why it is called ecstasy. It is the single best feeling you will ever experience in your entire life. It is life. It is love. Your body becomes liquid love. All sensations and perceptions are heightened to an enormous degree. You become more social. You are accepting of everything.  No need to denigrate sticking drugs up the bum. Your response implied that it seemed to easy, so I told you about other methods--plugging is supposedly a great way to take MDMA.  Anyway, given the above, it is a great experience, ESPECIALLY your first time. Even more special than your sex virginity. So make it count. That's my advice."

MDMA,3d5oai,cohen5250,2,Tue Jul 14 01:00:48 2015 UTC,"As for the question if the MDMA will degrade:  https://drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=149783  From link:     Let the record be set straight: MDMA is one of, if not the most stable recreational drug that exists. Phenethylamines in general are notoriously stable (especially as compared to tryptamines such as psilocybin, or other drugs such as LSD or beta-ketones) because of their low chemical reactivity. MDMA, even if sitting in a half-open baggie on your shelf, in the absence of extreme heat, humidity, etc. will last a lifetime. The same ideas also apply to MDA and MDEA as they have very similar structures, but not to MDMA analogues like bk-MDMA as a ketone introduces a more reactive (less stable) moiety to the molecule.  Regardless, this isn't the best way to store it. Almost any compound will begin to degrade if exposed to the elements for a long period of time. For this reason, MDMA will last the longest (that is, likely even longer than a lifetime) if kept in a cool, dry, dark place; in other words, it should not be stored in an environment which is constantly hot, damp, or bright (UV or incandescent light). Profoundly acidic or basic environments should also be avoided.   For example, it could be stored in a vacuum-sealed bag in a small box or amber vial of some sort, in a shelf in the closet, or perhaps even in the fridge if you feel so inclined. Although storing it in the freezer where moisture could seep in, or around food where mold or something else could do the same could be an issue if left for... 2 centuries."

I also recommend taking far less next time. that might be the reason for such a bad comedown. people recommend 2 mg/1 kg that you weigh. example: if you weigh 180 pounds it would be about 82 kg so take 164 mg of MDMA and redose with another 80 or so. taking 1 gram of MDMA on any given night definitely classifies as abusing the drug. and buy a test kit! nobody can stress this enough! it just might save you and your friend's lives!!! other than that I'm glad you had a magical time! roll safe my friend :)

You can research the effects of that yourself, but two bigs one are: strong feelings of depression, brain zaps. You probably want neither. There is no reason to roll that many times, try something else. Try another entactogen, like 4-FA or something slightly psychedelic but still a entactogen like 2c-b. Something that will not cause any long lasting effects on yourself, rolling too often is not smart. /r/DarkNetMarketsNoobs if you are confused about getting other stuff."

MDMA,3d4mzo,gearbuyer1,9,Mon Jul 13 14:15:40 2015 UTC,I just feel stupid the next day. I think the worst part is coming down and wishing you were still rolling. Which is more annoying than depressing.

MDMA,3d4mzo,uwotMD,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:27:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's all about mindset. If you're familiar with it, and you know how react to depressed thoughts, you can probably psyche yourself out of it. Keep yourself in a positive mood, and always remember all the good things in life.  With that said, you and your SO will be extremely fragile. A simple disagreement has a possibility of turning really bad because in this state. Stay cooperative, take care of each other, and most importantly take care of yourselves.  Personally I can get bad on it. It's manageable depending on my dosage, because the higher I get, the more fragile I am. If I had higher expectations during a night of MDMA and it doesn't go as planned, my mind tends to focus on all of those negative things. I need friends and support to help. I also need to remind myself of all the good, and that this is just the drugs.  Weed helps tremendously. Not even as a placebo, it's just an amazing cure lol. Good luck!"

Most recent time I only took around 110mg (in a pill advertised as 260mg) so obviously felt fine the day after.  If you're in the right mindset and haven't been abusing it recently you'll be fine."

I have been silly and sensible and have taken things that I thought were MDMA. .2, first time felt shit the next day, was like a drone high/MDMA. Not tested .4 same stuff , thought it was a one off, boy it wasn't felt like pure death and felt like the whole world was against me. I also had trouble sleeping the night after sweats/nightmares/headaches. The above were pre educating myself , Post educating myself  .18 of MDMA, tested, great purple reacted nicely from a viable source felt incredible , no jaw tension like previously , did in home setting with few friends chilled PC/Xbox/dance just a laugh. Slept on mates sofa , next day felt a little hungover but nothing like previously. After I had a glass of juice and a bit of food felt glorious, nice afterglow and loved the world. .25 different batch , tested. Nice setting , had a crazy comeup, dropped at 10:00am , about 9pm/10pm redosed a small amount trying to chase a high I guess, smoked some huge bowls played mario party and had a great time, things got a little trippy late on into the morning like 2/3am. Went to bed , woke up feeling like gold dust, no comedown at all.  Hope this helps , I had about 1month in between trips, just make sure you get your stuff from viable source like DNm and test it, you'll be fine. Just don't do too much or it'll bite you in the ass  Edit: just read your post properly, you'll be fine for vacation if you get some reliable stuff I suggest looking at DNm's. Make sure you get some decent rest the night before and if you don't have a set time on dropping go for early because you can get more rest that night. You'll be fine just treat it with respect and you'll be fine. A nice thing we like to do when rolling is sellotape a piece of paper to the wall, write down when you took your first dose and what drinks you have, that way it can give yourself a little bit of reassurance of what you did when etc. I know it sounds a little overkill but it's just a little thing we like to do ."

MDMA,3d5yug,BobbleheadDoll,2,Mon Jul 13 20:27:59 2015 UTC,"From the guide on the side:   Alpha Lipoic Acid- This is one that everyone should be taking. It is a powerful antioxidant[1] that scavenges reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. It also has a nice benefit of regenerating other vitamins, like C, after redox cycling. It exists in two enantiomers[2] , R-ALA and S-ALA. R-ALA is the biologically active isomer that we are looking for. Most supplements are racemic, or a mix of both. Racemic ALA does not reach as high of plasma levels as R-ALA, nor does it stay in the blood as long. It's half life is very short, ~30min. If that is all you can find, it's much better than nothing. R-ALA by itself is very unstable, and is not suitable for supplementation. This is where bonding it to sodium comes into play. Na-R-ALA, or sodium R alpha lipoic acid, allows for stable delivery of just the dextrorotory isomer of ALA. Here is a study on the benefits of Na-R-ALA[3] . And here is the study[4] showing that ALA prevented MDMA induced neurotoxicity, even though body temperatures still rose.   The conclusion is that R-ALA is better than nothing, but try to get Na-R-ALA."
MDMA,3d5yug,Tussthethief,0,Mon Jul 13 20:50:50 2015 UTC,"ALA and R-ALA have terribly short half lives that make them very ineffective at protecting you. Get Na-R-ALA.

MDMA,3d5225,dontbenaughty,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:11:59 2015 UTC,I kinda skipped over the end of your post but I have 2 comments. First of all I'm having an issue decoding the timeline but it's common knowledge that mdma kinda loses many of its positive effects if you use it often for a long period of time.   I personally try to put atleast 3 months between my rolls but I've also done 6 month breaks. I can guarantee you the longer the break the better the experience.  Try to make it more of an exclusive thing rather then a regular activity.   The second thing is my only mediocre experience was a week or so after I used mushrooms for the first time. Although the mushrooms were a very interesting experience to me I found it really difficult. Hence when I used mdma a few weeks later I was somewhat more afraid of the possible negative effects it could have that combined with a pretty high dose resulted in another pretty intense experience that was somewhat less enjoyable the usual. Afterwards I waited for 4 months and then started the night with a smaller dose which was absolutely amazing    Also if you're afraid about the quality of your stuff then please get it tested. I don't think that's the case though. I think you just need to have more respect for this powerful drug.
MDMA,3d5225,FruitdealerF,-1,Mon Jul 13 16:27:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah man we waited a good 1/2 months between each roll. We're well aware of the basic rules and that. I haven't taken any other drugs really.   Yeah i really need to get a test kit, but once it's bought you can't really take it back you know."
MDMA,3d5225,FruitdealerF,3,Mon Jul 13 16:32:45 2015 UTC,Make sure you know how much you are taking. Wait longer for the next time (like 4 months) and start by taking less. Wait for the peak and once you notice it's dropping take a little bit more (50/50 ish)  That's what I'd do in your position right now.

MDMA,3d5225,PeaceLoveLindzy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:23:41 2015 UTC,The lack of serotonin in your brain is most definitely the biggest reason of what you are feeling when you roll. MDMA has enough side effects that you feel when you are on it that are usually masked by the positive effects. As you are building up a higher tolerance the negative effects will be stronger and stronger.

Why am I even trying to convince you I do not know, I just felt pissed lol. You want real advice? Drop 100mg, and redose 50mg when you peak (usually around 2-3 hours in)."
MDMA,3d40hm,Frostybropanda,2,Mon Jul 13 11:48:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not sure why OP doesn't want the full experience. You be totally euphoric with 100mg at that weight.
MDMA,3d40hm,mdmawesome1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:09:57 2015 UTC,Sorry to say this.... But if you want 'just some euphoria'... just take some  4-FA or some other Amphetamine...
MDMA,3d3upw,Omgwizzle,3,Mon Jul 13 08:37:20 2015 UTC,"Every time I've ever had a 'bad thought' while rolling, it doesn't seem so bad. Instead I see it so much more matter-of-fact-ly. If that makes sense. Just make sure you have good music around you and you can dance. MDMA is amazing and makes you super happy."
MDMA,3d3upw,wakingbliss27,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:46:03 2015 UTC,"Can you ""lose yourself"" per say on mdma? Like on lsd I thought I was a thousand mes and I died and was coming back to life and shit"
MDMA,3d3upw,YouKnowNothingJohn,4,Mon Jul 13 08:58:10 2015 UTC,"LSD is a hallucinogen, MDMA is not. There is a big difference and no I feel you cannot ""lose yourself"".  It might amplify your own feelings and might remove some boundaries that you normally have but it won't make you feel like you died."
MDMA,3d3upw,CannabisFan420,2,Mon Jul 13 09:07:35 2015 UTC,250ug of LSD for a first-timer is way to much (you should have seen that bad trip coming) but 120mg of mdma sounds just perfect to start with. Just look into the saver use advices.
MDMA,3d3upw,wakingbliss27,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:21:41 2015 UTC,I've definitely lost myself... To the music. It's none of that ego death stuff. I just become the music. I can't stop dancing. Endless happiness. It's beautiful
MDMA,3d3upw,mdmayy_bb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:04:25 2015 UTC,"Nah, really not that crazy. Like, if you had to (you never should!) you could probably drive. You could talk to your parents on the phone, and they probably couldn't tell except that you'd sound pretty positive. It makes everything very positive, intense, loving, and warm."
MDMA,3d3upw,morespore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:50:31 2015 UTC,"120mg is a good first roll - my recommendation would be to avoid all other substances, just so you get an idea of what a ""clean"" roll is (assuming you've tested your gear).  LSD on it's own can get a little crazy especially if you're not expecting or prepared for what's coming.  If you do however come across more LSD and MDMA in the future, candyflip - the intense euphoria of the MDMA and the trippy loopyness of the LSD go together really really well.  Just keep the doses of both at the low end (150mg MDMA+100ugLSD) and it's extremely enjoyable in my experience."
MDMA,3d3upw,adamecs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:15:19 2015 UTC,"The ""pure"" effect of MDMA is not that crazy, in the sense that it will normally not lead to ""dramatic"" alteration of consciousness (depersonalization, hallucinations, time warp etc.). Ecstasy pills, however, often contain other substances in addition to MDMA, like methamphetamine. This could of course add to the ""craziness"" of the trip, but given the pills are of ok quality, you will probably still not experience a bad trip.  I would recommend not being drunk while rolling, though. In my experience, high alcohol consumption before rolling can lead to loss of control. This is probably due to the combined effect of reduced inhibition from alcohol and euphoric mood from molly.  Good luck and roll safe.  edit: spelling"

MDMA,3d2kbs,peonyourface,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:17:04 2015 UTC,"Ecstasy pills often contain stimulants in addition to MDMA (or, if you were unlucky, just stimulants). Methamphetamine sounds likely. It is quite often added to pills, and it can lead to sleeplessness for some nights and paranoia. The latter can also be caused by the sleeplessness.    Try not to worry about it. If you're still suffering from sleeplessness, just tell yourself it will be ok if you just give it some time. Don't start taking benzo or sleeping pills. If it really gets bad, try getting a prescription for some antihistamines with a sedative effect, like promethazine.  Good luck."

MDMA,3d0yqr,uwotMD,6,Sun Jul 12 18:21:36 2015 UTC,"MDMA is neurotoxic and thus prolonged, frequent irresponsible use can lead to cognitive impairment. This includes memory, learning, attention etc.  Imo another roll in a weeks time won't add much to any damage you may have done already but continued use as frequent as yours will lead to cognitive deficits. However, I would not recommend it."
MDMA,3d0yqr,adamecs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks this is the perfect answer!  I really appreciate it,  would it be worth supplementing for a week until that roll if I decide to do so?"
MDMA,3d0yqr,Frostybropanda,2,Sun Jul 12 21:09:05 2015 UTC,"First, I have to say, this is not that extreme. Personally, I space out my rolls more, but I have friends who roll even more frequently than you did, and over longer periods. Although it is impossible for me to say with any certainty, it seems like they are doing perfectly fine, both emotionally and cognitively.   I also want to point out that the link between frequency of use and neuropsychological damage in MDMA is not well established. Also, for most neuropsychological outcome measures there is not even an association between poorer performance and total lifetime consumption of MDMA (Rogers et al., 2009). This does not mean, however, that the rate of ecstasy consumption is irrelevant, but realize that there are not many studies including that as a covariate.    That being said, since we don’t really know how harmful high frequency rolling is, why not try to take some breaks from Molly, and see that you can have a good time without it as well.     Source: Rogers, G., Elston, J., Garside, R., Roome, C., Taylor, R., Younger, P., Somerville, M. (2009).

You can take the same MDMA, same amounts, at the same time. And basically have completely different experiences. People are just different I guess.  2) Also there's the whole ""first time"" thing. The first time is so good, that everything will always pale in comparison. So maybe you won't get it back, but you'll have something like it.  3) Maybe just your headspace?

I plan on leaving it atleast 2 months and trying again, gel capsuling 132-135mg (who knows with my cheap scales), and then would you recommend half of that for a booster or do you prefer boosting with a relatively high dose? (if at all)"
MDMA,3d07jx,Monkey_in_a_Barrel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:58:08 2015 UTC,I have stopped rolling for a long while. But the recommendations seem to be to use a half for a booster. I do not have personal experience with varying initial and redosing amounts to see how it affects my subjectively.
MDMA,3d07jx,Monkey_in_a_Barrel,2,Mon Jul 13 15:28:19 2015 UTC,Time does go by fast while rolling. Definitely is the mindset. First time I roll was 100mg cried for 5 hours so happy. Two weeks later took 100mg then redose another 100mg had the best roll ever. Going to festival with good vibes help a lot. Don't lose hope too soon.
MDMA,3d07jx,Monkey_in_a_Barrel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"If the duration is that short I'd guess it was methylone you took, I've tried both and methylone felt too short compared to mdma.   I guess if you tested it it's unlikely, could it have been a mix of the two? The dark colour would overpower the yellow methylone reaction.   Or you might be a fast metabolizer, which given the test kit seems more likely"
MDMA,3d07jx,Monkey_in_a_Barrel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:23:32 2015 UTC,"Not only was it test kitted but another person who got the same darknet sample (not sure if I'm allowed to mention who it was obtained) had it lab tested and it came back as pure MDMA. I am known to be a fast metabolizer! I am completely unable to gain wait no matter what I eat, and it's actually frustrating because i dislike being so thin. Is there any way to slow down my metabolism for the duration?"
MDMA,3d07jx,Monkey_in_a_Barrel,2,Mon Jul 13 11:25:06 2015 UTC,"It's actually not related to your metabolism in general, it's due to activity of the specific enzymes, which is due to genetics and can happen regardless of body weight or metabolism.   Grapefruit juice inhibits one of the enzymes that break down mdma, so load up on that beforehand and during, that may help. Also, if you're comfortable with it add some 2C-B or LSD to the mix, they'll extend the experience quite a bit and add an incredible layer of awesomeness to the experience."
MDMA,3d04pc,hfl92,4,Sun Jul 12 10:41:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm not so sure about that. Even when I've bombed speed (street amphetamine) the come up has always been much quicker than with MDMA. And I've only puked / felt sick once from bombing speed and that was when it hit me harder than expected and I was going too hard on the dance floor, lol. Speed has some euphoria to it, too, I always feel extra amazing when I've taken speed so yeah. I dunno. Just doesn't sound like amphetamine to me."
MDMA,3d04pc,EasterGirl,3,Sun Jul 12 10:59:32 2015 UTC,methylone maybe
MDMA,3d04pc,SingingPenguin,2,Sun Jul 12 19:44:20 2015 UTC,"Did I take speed?   I dunno, what did the test kit say?"

MDMA,3d08zn,agreatwayofff,3,Sun Jul 12 11:52:36 2015 UTC,"You should NOT take MDMA in conjunction with any medication that affects your seratonin levels, including Venlafaxine. MDMA generally does not interact well with antidepressants. The best-case scenario is that your roll is unaffected, dulled or non-existent. In the worst case scenario, it could be lethal.  Also, don't temporarily stop taking Venlafaxine just so you can roll. Only consider rolling about a month after stopping medication, and only stop medication if your doctor agrees that it's the right thing for you.  See this past thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/34v29c/molly_mixed_with_cymabalta_snri_antidepressant/"

MDMA,3d08zn,burrito_lord,2,Sun Jul 12 14:04:13 2015 UTC,There is a good chance the venlafaxine will reduce the effects of the MDMA or there will be no effect at all.   There is also a risk of serotonin syndrome. I would not recommend stopping the medication. Something like LSD or mushrooms might be a safer choice if those interest you.

MDMA,3d00mp,jucifer,5,Sun Jul 12 13:54:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not getting into an argument over the internet but there's plenty of advice from qualified chemists regarding the colour of MDMA. The chemist in this interviews specifies what colour it should be and why it is often a tan colour. But obviously you know better than somebody with a PHD in chemistry so there's no point arguing.  http://detect-kit.com/2015/07/can-mdma-be-over-84-pure-well-yes-and-no/  Can MDMA exist in over 84% pure form?  Dr. Chaim Yosef Mariategui-Levi, the PhD chemist interviewed for this article, states that MDMA in general can exist in two forms: “ Free base: C11H15N02 MW = 193.25, and the Hydrochloride: C11H16NO2Cl ; MW= 229.70.”  Freebase has very high pure levels. The hydrochloride version can hold, in his estimate, 85.62% of freebase’s purity. Accounting for impurities would leave a level of  about 84% pure MDMA, which leaves room for the other 16% being the hydrochloride salts. If the HCl content is under 16%, the MDMA compound becomes liquid. In its salt form, he stated, MDMA looks white or off white.  Why does some MDMA come in different colors, like tan or dark brown?  “The different colors are caused by impurities of the product.. The drug in its salt form (hydrochloride) is white or off white."

The funniest being that you are arguing that a HCL version of the drug is as clean as it gets, when in reality the maximum purity in this form is about 84% or so.

MDMA,3d00mp,dregofdeath,6,Mon Jul 13 01:33:39 2015 UTC,"MDA should not look like this pretty much ever. If anything can be said of MDA, it's that in terms of physical properties it is a very very consistent compound. This is quite different from MDMA HCl which forms up to four different hydrates, all with different chemical properties.   High purity MDA HCl has a very uniform appearance and it looks nothing like this. Very dark stuff like this seems to be fairly well known, but to my knowledge no one has quantitatively analyzed and contrasted multiple samples with such properties. It may very well be Pd(0), other wacker oxidation reagents, or just junk from impure safrole.   If it was supposed to be MDMA the above would be a reasonable explanation, but for MDA it seems very unlikely so I would be worried."

Basically it's a powder that doesn't do anything except allow pills to be stuck together (it's the same stuff used in prescription and over the counter pills like paracetamol). so you add so much mdma and so much pill binders (and maybe some dye for colour) and mix. Then when you press the powder together tightly it'll stay in place. This is done using a pill press and it's how pills are made"

MDMA,3cuinc,askmdmathrowaway,3,Fri Jul 10 21:56:00 2015 UTC,"I'm bipolar as well, and I always take 5htp after any hard drug. Especially mdma or ecstasy. 5htp promotes the production of serotonin, which is the neurotransmitter that mdma depletes, and why you feel depressed afterwards. Even when I'm going through a down cycle I like to pop a 5htp to help get through it. But, as I'm sure you know, we're all very different and things can react differently for everyone. Also, eat lots of red meat as this helps produce happy hormones too. And exercise also helps to stimulate healthy brain chemistry."

MDMA,3cuinc,aldanexotyr,3,Sat Jul 11 01:48:18 2015 UTC,"It feels amazing. It's nothing like mania. MDMA is such a powerful chemical emphathogen you really begin to feel love for everything. I don't know how other people with bipolar disorder are, but I'm usually pretty apathetic about everything and rarely feel a ton of plur emotions. I wouldn't do mdma if I were manic though, just to be safe and stay clear of a psychosis. But I wouldn't fear doing it while stable or maybe even a mild depression. Though if I were to compare mania to any drug I'd say it's more similar to Lsd."

MDMA,3cuinc,yourmomsvevo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:26:07 2015 UTC,"I think I would try everything else before mdma to help relieve the down cycle. Again, MDMA is very powerful, and the emotions are very beautiful. But everyone's brain chemistry is different. There has been research that points towards its help in relieving depression. And to answer your question, yes, at least for me, it did relieve my depression. Keep in mind that afterwards you basically have a clean slate with your brain, so you have to be kind to it so that it can start to regulate the proper chemicals. As with any drug really, you want to make sure you're in the proper environment."

MDMA,3csjl6,smouy,2,Fri Jul 10 15:37:07 2015 UTC,"This is not true. Where I come from, 93% of all tested pills only constain mdma as a working substance, the rest is mdma-like substances (like mda). Only 1-2% contain other substances, like pmma or speed. Ketamin or heroin are never found in pills and wouldn't make any sense for it's more expensive. although I live in one of the highest quality pill producing countrues, your source is still invalid and your information flawed."
MDMA,3csjl6,S0rb0,-1,Fri Jul 10 16:52:49 2015 UTC,"If you over do it on mdma you can literally start feeling nothing because your brain is pretty worn out. Make sure you're taking your supplements. And if you pop a 5htp 4 hours before you drop the Molly then you're more likely to get a stronger roll. Also, the comment above about psychological impotence is very true. All psychedelic drugs, will affect you according to how much you tell yourself it will. So if you go in it with a good attitude, you'll generally enjoy the shit out of it."

Probably changed the colors so you could tell the difference between batches.  The new presses have been out for a week+ now.  It doesn't mean they don't still have some leftover from the old batch.

I've heard of others who claim they take no supplements with MDMA, but that they get no negative come down. For the most part however they do maintain a healthy diet (plenty of greens, fresh juices, distilled water, etc). They also do things like meditate while on MDMA instead of party on it or do physically active things. And they're not doing risky doses, but staying within the recommended/safe parameters of 50-120mg. They attribute the lack of side-effects to the setting, diet, and meditation.   Have you tried meditating on 80-100mg? You could give that a shot sometime and see how that affects the way you feel on the ""come down"". Would be interesting :)"

Also- her pupils did not dilate at all and the other girls took up almost her entire eye.  You say your friend takes 150-200 mg starters, do you think she maybe just has never taken enough?

MDMA,3cpfyf,sarahlituma,3,Fri Jul 10 02:42:01 2015 UTC,"My gf has a similar view point for when I attend these festivals. Honestly though, when I go solo I just have the best time alone.

MDMA,3cpfyf,Gumballhead753,2,Thu Jul 9 20:13:50 2015 UTC,"My guess is that since it is your first time rolling you'll be feeling a lot of euphoria and will just want to share that with the person you love most.  In all honesty I'm much less distracted by the half naked girls if I am rolling.  I think your idea of rolling at the festival is totally fine, just make sure that you spend most of your time hanging with your wife and ensuring that she feels appreciated and loved. If you feel the need to go dance or something then that should be fine as long as you're not using it as an excuse to dance with other girls.  When I roll I feel so much love for everyone, but not because they are scandily clad hot girls. Because they are beautiful inside and out. If I had a girl I loved with me I reallllllllllly doubt I'd be focused on anyone but her. Molly is the love drug, not the lust drug. I feel a lot more lust if I'm on alcohol, on Molly it's just pure love. When I'm rolling I spend more time reminding my close friends how much I love them than I do looking for hot girls."

You'll just want to spend time with your wife. Like Eliam19 said it's the love not lust drug.  However the first time you come up on molly is such a perception altering, mind blowing experience. Honestly I am so happy I had my first time with friends (who were also rolling). But it would have only been better with my s/o. I would personally wait until you can do it together and I think she'll thank you for it after that time comes."

This year at electric forest me and my gf candy flipped and we were with all our friends. We started to roll tits and my gf said she had to go to the bathroom. But when walking there my gf just bursted out with some of issues we were facing and said she just said she had to get away from the group so we could talk privately. We worked out some long time issues in the midst of thousands of people partying it up. It was so amazing being able to openly communicate about things that are so hard to talk about (ie skirting around the issue, trying to not hurt the other with criticism etc)  Granted we are both experienced with mdma, and it might not be the same for OP as they've never tried it before."
MDMA,3cnnnt,mdmaismdmamazing,10,Thu Jul 9 08:53:06 2015 UTC,A friend of mine coined a term for this phenomenon: ecrush  We've been trying to make it a thing for the last 6 years
MDMA,3cnnnt,nosispower,5,Thu Jul 9 12:24:49 2015 UTC,Please elaborate! I would love to know.
MDMA,3cnnnt,nosispower,5,Thu Jul 9 12:28:17 2015 UTC,"We both had failed relationships with girls that started from rolling. And we started to discuss the feeling of falling for someone because you spent a lot of time rolling with them. Honestly that little tinge of romantic feeling never quite goes away but at the end of our relationships, we both realized that those feelings never really compensate for irreconcilable differences.  He hence coined the term ecrush and has been trying to make it a thing for years. It's what happens when you roll with someone but it's not always real."
MDMA,3cnnnt,nosispower,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:40:03 2015 UTC,"The harsh reality. Do you think I should say befriend this person on facebook, or will that only make it worse? I had quite a memorable time with her, but not sure if itll make it worse or better."
MDMA,3cnnnt,snapchats,2,Thu Jul 9 13:15:19 2015 UTC,"Why not? Don't look at my experience and think that it always leads to a failed relationship. If I examined my own history of relationships, I'd find that they've 100% failed and I should expect my current one to do the same. You like this girl? Who cares if it's because of MDMA? You're not asking her to marry you. You should definitely friend her on fb and see if she's interested in hanging out."

MDMA,3cnnnt,Salvyana420tr,2,Thu Jul 9 19:12:24 2015 UTC,Was it your first intimate experience with a chick over all or was it the first time on MDMA?
MDMA,3cnnnt,Salvyana420tr,4,Thu Jul 9 10:18:53 2015 UTC,"On MDMA. I'm sure it was just the drug as I don't even know anything about her... but I still have feelings for her, y'know?"
MDMA,3cnnnt,CandycaneMushrrom,4,Thu Jul 9 10:25:29 2015 UTC,"I've thought i had feelings exactly in the same situation as you are, I was single and after 1 lovely night one particular girl just filled my entire mind. What really helped me was as i got to know her more (we had mutual friends) i slowly "" realized "" it was just the drugs acting up. She was nice and hot and all but nothing to make here special between all the other nice and hot chicks, and i really didn't give a single dime about her anyway. After the realization letting go of the thought entirely was rather easy, it was the realizing part that took some time and effort.  The main thing that helped was doing MDMA with my girlfriend for the first time after this whole thing (she was my girlfriend before this event as well, we were in the middle of a weird breakup). You suddenly see the difference between drug-induced love and drug-enhanced love. Once you realize this fine detail it gets very easy to tell which one is which."
MDMA,3cnnnt,Zirtonic,3,Thu Jul 9 10:32:35 2015 UTC,"How long until the infatuation faded with the first girl? Right now I feel as though during that single night we actually shared like a really long time together, if you get what I mean, and then it suddenly just all vanished. It makes me feel sad in a way. I'm trying to get over it though. I'm trying to rationalize that it was just the drug and that I should move on."
MDMA,3cnnnt,jonotol,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:44:12 2015 UTC,"Dont get over it really. Im sure she was nice and pretty (especially in your memory) but just know that what makes her really special is the drug. You had a lovely experience, aim to have more of them and let them stay as sweet memories rather that things to look back at and feel bad about. It probably was a pretty sweet experience rather then a ""bad"" one am i wrong? Let it be that way."

It was even ""worse"" for me because it was the first time I'd ever had any kind of intimacy with a girl, sober or otherwise.   2 weeks have gone by and I'm just starting to rationalize all of the feelings I had/have. I've been aware the entire time that they're most likely part of an ecrush, but I'm now finalizing those thoughts and getting past them.   I'm not sure how close you are with this girl without MDMA but (even though the drug gives you false feelings) definitely use the experience to become better friends with her if she seems cool. The girl I rolled with was more of an acquaintance before our experience but afterwards she's become a very good friend."

MDMA,3cp40z,MoveableParts,2,Fri Jul 10 08:31:56 2015 UTC,"The research falls into two categories: rat research that can look at specific schedules of drug use and their corresponding effects on brain physiology, and human correlational research that looks at varying degrees of MDMA users (e.g., heavy abusers) and their actual cognitive deficits. Any other claim is an extrapolation from this type of research. The claims about ""responsible use"" and ""harm reduction"" are based on neurotoxic effects in rats, rather than on the cognitive effects in humans. So, although the recommendations given appear to be the best based on these findings, they may not actually be able to prevent lasting physiological and cognitive damage. That's the risk we all take when using MDMA. Nevertheless, we take this risk with the intent to reduce harm based on research, which is better than taking the risk without knowledge of any of the research."

MDMA,3co8iw,Greenpapercups,4,Thu Jul 9 13:13:02 2015 UTC,"A large majorty of your high is in your head. If youre in a great dancy mood and get to the festival with everyone else in a similar mood, and have your mind set on dancing, then there's a high chance youll dance. But if you keep thinking about how you would rather lay around, that will likely distract you and persuade you to ""stay on the couch"".   Just think, a festival would already help boost your seratonin naturally if you're having a genuinely good time, so the MDMA will just follow the lead.

Despite being an upper, MDMA almost feels like it has a downer effect on me because it makes me just want to sit down, close my eyes, conversate/bond with friends, and just enjoy the high. This is why my favorite place to roll is around a bonfire. Anytime someone suggests standing up I want nothing to do with it. However, I have noticed that once I get up, it's much easier to stay up. Just gotta give myself that initial push! I rolled at a festival last year and during the peak I was glued to the grass but after the initial intensity wore off I danced my little heart out to Lotus and had an absolute blast! =)"

MDMA,3cox0z,SentFromGods,3,Thu Jul 9 16:26:07 2015 UTC,"It's not a great idea. You're more likely to do damage, the second-day roll won't be as good and your chances of having a shitty comedown/next few days go way, way up. If you find yourself being super tempted and want to do it twice during the festival anyway, the more days you wait in between the better, don't re-dose, and try to wait at least 6 months afterwards til your next roll. But I'd suggest picking one day to have a really great roll, then find something else to do on the other days - alcohol, LSD or shrooms (SMALL amounts if you haven't done them before!), etc.  Use a test kit, make sure you take all the recommended supplements, get sleep and eat well while you're there too. Have fun!"

MDMA,3cmbcr,hash_smashed,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:23:13 2015 UTC,"mmmm I'd say thats probably good.. also re: your comment above, if you space out the doses (redosing much beyond the first drop) it doesnt increase the intensity.. the overall strength of the roll will be determined by the initial dose you took, if you want to increase the relative STRENGTH of the roll, you're better off taking more up front.  It is also worth asking whether you tested the substance before you took it. Even aside from a safety standpoint, if you DIDNT happen to test the substance and it was actually bk-mdma (methylone), you would probably need about double the dose to have approximately the same effects. I know you said that your friend took some and rolled face, but often statements like that are pretty subjective and theres not really any way to reeeally tell what it was JUST based of his description of the effects."
MDMA,3cmbcr,snapchats,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:18:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't end up taking more earlier because sometimes the initial dose can take a bit to hit me.

I've had methylone in the past so I know the difference, but I know for sure it wasn't that. This isn't the first time I've used this batch either so I'm pretty set on knowing it was legit."

I know you are probably really looking forward to rolling tomorrow, but it really would be a good idea to try not to partake and wait a few more weeks.  Normally I would say that partaking more than once a month isnt necessarily the end of the world as long as you dont do it every month, but in your case I really think that it would be best to let your brain and body recover a bit longer than is normally suggested.

MDMA,3ckb16,realityfake,7,Wed Jul 8 16:03:00 2015 UTC,"Suggesting powdered MDMA over a pressed pill is pretty woeful advice - it's much easier to know exactly what is in a pill (i.e. through pill reports), where as you are afforded no such luxury with a powder. Also, I believe the recommended dose (in milligrams) is actually 1.5x your bodyweight (in kilograms), as opposed to the stated 2x. As I weigh 86kg, I know 172mg would have been FAR too much as a first time. This advice, generally speaking, is pretty crap."
MDMA,3ckb16,AndyG1001,2,Wed Jul 8 19:58:00 2015 UTC,I agree. It's much easier to add more powdered stuff to powder than it is to replicate an unusually shaped pill like a legoman or whatever. That's not to say that pills can't be bunk but I'd say the reputable dutch presses are pretty reliable.

I can imagine that Eminem's older stuff would sound pretty good, too, though you would probably consider that rap."
MDMA,3clfx2,BobbleheadDoll,2,Wed Jul 8 20:50:58 2015 UTC,Oh man Alliyah would be amazing! Haha I feel like immortal would be way too intense. And yes old eminem with the flows and production would be incredible. I listened to drug ballad on a roll once and throughly enjoyed. And it's all hip hop to me man :)

MDMA,3cltxc,catswhatshesaid,5,Wed Jul 8 22:27:09 2015 UTC,"Definately not, especially with the Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin is what's known as a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, which impacts your bodies regulation of Serotonin by affecting the Serotonin Pumps in your brain. MDMA has a similiar effects on the Serotonin system, but SSRI's are likely to block and trump the MDMA.. resulting in: Well, you may have a greatly diminished response to the MDMA (what a waste!!!), and you also may cause some unwanted side effects. I couldn't see any literature regarding whether it would be fatal or not, Not being alarmist,  but you also have two other meds in the mix. As Psychonaut420 said, probably not wise. Ill say it even stronger. Don't consider it at all until you are off the Meds. Full Stop. Sorry to be a party popper :-("

MDMA,3cltxc,blacktactix,2,Thu Jul 9 21:41:27 2015 UTC,"My recommendation is still the same unfortunately. Seroquel will likely block MDMA's effect. Coupled with possible side effects from the other 2. I think you will be rolling a dice if you attempt this. More likely, you are going to have such diminshed effects (see this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/27aty8/strattera_adhd_meds_and_mdma/ on strattera interactions), that its going to be a waste of time at best, and risky at worse."

MDMA,3cltxc,OnAGoodDay,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:54:24 2015 UTC,"I was on seroquel, among other things, at one point too, its a pretty heavy med that will likely reduce the effects of MDMA, mushrooms and acid by quite a bit. If you are set on trying a substance I would try a small dose at home where you can monitor the effects and see how well it goes, if it seems OK, then up the dose a bit for the concert. I personally was on a bunch of different meds for a while and decided to give them up and stay clean for a year (only smoked weed) till I felt like my neurochemistry was more or less back to normal before using MDxx, mushrooms and LSD again."
MDMA,3cltxc,helloworldalex,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:21:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with the guy above ya that it's probably best not to mix MDMA with 3 prescription drugs, especially ones that are potentially messing with the same neurotransmitters that MDMA does.  You could have a great time, or you might not feel anything, or there's a small chance that you get yourself into a dangerous situation.  Either way, it's an elevated risk when you're taking other drugs.    As for mushrooms, they're generally less physically hard on the body and brain as MDMA.  You're not likely to hurt yourself, but the other drugs may affect the strength of trip you have.  Hard to say.  In this situation it's always best to start doses very low if you aren't sure.    And, as always, test your stuff."

MDMA,3clhox,_huckleberryfinn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:36:37 2015 UTC,I think what is happening is people are making liquid MDMA and pressing in in pill form. That is how they are able to serve MDMA at such high purity.
MDMA,3clhox,WeGotTheWay,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:56:08 2015 UTC,"The article doesn't make sense and it's unfortunately obvious the author doesn't understand what they are typing. Disinformation like this is not a good thing.  Any salt of a drug can be 100% pure. Counter anion weight isn't considered at all. If I have MDMA HCl and it's pure, the purity is hypothetically 100%. It's still normal MDMA HCl and is going to be a solid. The weight difference between the freebase and salt is not even considered because the extra proton and chlorine atoms are expected to be part of the compound.   MDMA freebase is never offered for consumption. It's harder to purify and usually carries along solvents and impurities dissolved. Allowing it to be exposed to atmosphere puts it in equilibrium with MDMA carbonate anyway which is a solid."
MDMA,3clhox,disposable125,3,Thu Jul 9 04:16:37 2015 UTC,"No he isn't wrong. If its MDMA HCL the highest purity it can be is 84% to be a solid, and the rest is HCL. Any higher percentage the MDMA wouldn't be a solid. You obviously don't know what your talking about. Also the author is interviewing a PhD chemist in the article he isn't just making stuff up"
MDMA,3clhox,WeGotTheWay,2,Thu Jul 9 07:02:52 2015 UTC,"You are wrong wrong man seriously. Like I said, if I have MDMA HCl and it's hypothetically pure, I have 100% MDMA HCl. Equivocating MDMA salts to freebase is pointless as literally no one ever consumes base MDMA. Aside form being wasteful, the taste and smell are absolute nightmare fuel. It's almost impossible to even consider consuming that stuff.   Counter anion weight of the salt is not going to be considered an impurity. Hell even if it was the ratio given would be wrong as MDMA HCl can form multiple hydrates depending on the work up. This is why its physical properties can vary so much.  The article is seriously ridiculous and has no basis in actual chemistry whatsoever. I am an Ochem post-doc and I have no idea how another chemist would make such claims. I seriously doubt an actual chemist was even interviewed.  Sorry but if anyone doesn't know what they are talking about it's you and the author. It's not even that difficult of a concept. I don't see how people can possible get confused by something so simple as purity. You can absolutely have 100% purity MDMA HCl and its physical properties will be identical to literature values in terms of MP, crystalline structure (depending on hydrate), etc."
MDMA,3clhox,disposable125,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:20:04 2015 UTC,Your wrong man seriously I don't know where you are getting your facts. Shulgin couldn't even get over 84%.

MDMA,3ck08n,EasterGirl,3,Wed Jul 8 14:58:41 2015 UTC,I guess it's kind of an unexpected effect of MDMA. I don't mind it but it's surprising how real these visualizations seem.
MDMA,3ck08n,EasterGirl,3,Wed Jul 8 15:03:13 2015 UTC,It's mostly due to MDMA metabolizing into MDA (in you liver?) which is much more psychedelic than MDMA. It's also more neurotoxic so most people here advice you to take low enough doses and preload with antioxidants to avoid this conversion. Personally I really enjoy those 'dreams' and the trippyness but yeah. It's completely normal to experience that :)

MDMA,3cku9n,ThePsychonaut420,2,Wed Jul 8 19:15:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you :) Yep, I will start with a half and redose maybe +1.30h. I do love bike rides... I wonder if there's any balance- issues if I ride under the influence of mdma... I usually ride 4 x 40km per week in the summer time, but maybe 20km is enough if I have taken mdma... All that sweating and all... Bike ride first, then I'll probably go for a little swim and after that just lay down on the ground and do some stretching exercises and some kind of meditation. Thank you for your answer !"
MDMA,3cku9n,ThePsychonaut420,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"I've had no issues biking on a low to medium MDxx dose, I've also gone biking on a half tab of acid and had a blast. I always bring plenty of water and make sure to not kick it into high gear and always pay attention to heart rate and heat, when I feel my body working too hard I stop somewhere with a good view and just relax with the headphones on. Prepare a good playlist of feel good songs and I think you'll have a great day."
MDMA,3cku9n,baconmma,2,Wed Jul 8 19:46:31 2015 UTC,"Might be a good idea to test it. Last thing you want is to be feeling some weird effects alone in a remote location.   The thing I'd be concerned with is that the comedown might be kind of harsh and, at that point, the thoughts about your dad might be a bit troubling. It might be alright though. They use MDMA to treat PTSD so during the roll you should be able to think about what happened very openly.  Another issue might be swimming because MDMA messes with your body's ability to regulate temperature. When you swim your body loses heat to the water. I don't know if it would be a problem or not but it's something to consider. Same goes with cycling in the hot sun and sweating a lot.  The good thing about rolling alone is that you can do anything you wish without worrying about other people. The bad thing is that you have no-one to talk to. Every time I've done it alone I've wanted to talk to someone at some point. I chatted with my friend on Whatsapp one time and the other time I spoke to a random Romanian dude on Omegle ha."

MDMA,3cjxb5,barlingbackbable,2,Wed Jul 8 15:15:17 2015 UTC,"No I didn't rush, I just felt great like usually on e. I was amazed that the 1.5 tablet still worked on me after throwing up. The funny thing is I didn't mind that I had thrown up, I didn't think much about it until the next day."
MDMA,3cjxb5,stayclassy_073,2,Wed Jul 8 18:16:11 2015 UTC,"I throw up pretty often on the come up of my trip with the same tested MDMA. No stress, pretty common side effect."
MDMA,3cjxb5,only_spoons,4,Wed Jul 8 21:21:20 2015 UTC,"Once when I took 200mg of MDMA at once I felt a sudden feeling that I was going to be sick as I started to come up. Luckily it passed. I don't think nausea is an entirely uncommon side effect and I've heard of other people being sick. Usually seems to happen on the come up and passes, either after being sick or on it's own."

MDMA,3cjxb5,only_spoons,3,Wed Jul 8 18:17:13 2015 UTC,Yeah sounds pretty typical. Come up can be overwhelming. If you also try to eat at that time it is not surprising you were sick. Wait until you have been rolling for a little while before trying to eat next time - personally I have no appetite after MDMA but my friends manage mid-roll chips and burgers on a night out.

MDMA,3clhdt,Zathrix,2,Wed Jul 8 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"There are alot of factors that could have contributed to your less than overwhelming experience, for example; your body weight, setting, expectations, and of course the purity of your product. Did you test your product?. If you have done so, and you are sure of its purity, and that is actually MDMA, then you may be able to up your dose slightly (say 110-120mg next time), to see if that increases your experience. I usually only experience visuals at much higher doses (160mg+), which is above what you require for an optimal experience. I find as doses increase, visuals increase, but negative side effects (like getting couched) also increase. As always, know what you are taking, stay safe and increase any dosages in small amounts. Some people also consider a 2nd dose at the 1 1/2-2 Hour mark of 40-60 Mg to potentiate affects, or lengthen the experience, so you could consider that."
MDMA,3clhdt,blacktactix,2,Wed Jul 8 21:43:25 2015 UTC,"Yep! I could test it before. 80% purity MDMA no other drugs on it.  Now that you say about weight, I'm only 60kg and 180cm tall (I should be 74kg) and that was another factor for a low first dosis but yes... I think next roll would be slightly stronger (when you say 110mg you mean with 100% purity MDMA? so I would say like 140mg actually?)  Also, I took another small dosis two-three hours or so before, but I think it only made it longer and no stronger!"
MDMA,3clhdt,blacktactix,2,Wed Jul 8 22:30:43 2015 UTC,"Ive never had 100% pure MDMA (dubious if this is even possible, and unlikely on the street). So, no, just work out a dosage based on what you have. Given your response the first time, I think you could be safe to up your dose. But as always, don't trust what I say. make sure you are comfortable with what you are taking, and safety first. Good, uncut MDMA is reasonably forgiving with upped doses, just with the effects I described earlier.  EDIT: Also, yes, with your redose, given the time between, this would unlikely have had an effect on perceived ""strength"". Most of the time I only have a 3-4 hour curve.  A redose at 1 1/2 hours extends this to 6 or so hours."
MDMA,3clhdt,disposable_UK,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:05:24 2015 UTC,"when you say 110mg you mean with 100% purity MDMA? so I would say like 140mg actually?   Without access to a lab there's no way of measuring the purity so just follow the dosage guidelines without worrying about if it's proportional to purity. I like 120mg, although have taken more bigger amounts on a big night out.   I took another small dosis two-three hours or so before   If I redose then I don't do it so far apart... 90 mins is my sweet spot. I go for 50% of my initial dose.  Lastly, you really should look into getting some scales. Eyeballing doses is ineffective... the amounts are small that it's easy to over or underestimate your dose. Amazon sells them cheap enough that there's no excuse really.  Hope your next roll is enjoyable :-)"
MDMA,3clhdt,finedininandbreathin,2,Thu Jul 9 23:58:56 2015 UTC,"My first time rolling was underwhelming also, although I took a quarter of that amount. The second time was much better, I imagine it's because I knew what to expect and could focus on the effects better"
MDMA,3clhdt,Chumbardo,2,Wed Jul 8 23:58:12 2015 UTC,"Probably because you didn't take much. 90mg is a weak dose, even for a first timer. I'd wait at least a month and then try 130mg if I were you."

MDMA,3cjdc1,virtually_sane,7,Wed Jul 8 10:59:04 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand how people can abuse MDMA on a daily/weekly basis. Honestly, after I roll the last thing on my mind is to take some more (at least the day after while my head is pounding)."
MDMA,3cjdc1,raspistoljeni,6,Wed Jul 8 11:34:10 2015 UTC,"Daily is rather hard to understand... Weekly? Very, very easy to get into that kind of habit depending on the circumstances of your life.  I have seen MANY people go down that road.   In Berlin, it is common for young people to go partying just about every weekend and most take a variety of drugs, MDMA being favored by many.  Personally I never had any kind of headache from MDMA, as you mentioned your head pounding, only loss of motivation, energy, focus and after some abuse also depressive states.  Really, the side effects at first aren't all that bad, only with frequent (ab)use they start to be more than a nuisance. The insidious thing is that they ramp up slowly, almost unnoticeable.   Most people at some point break out of that lifestyle as they start noticing the toll it is taking but some really ruin their life, not managing to quit before it has caused permanent damage to their health and / or life."
MDMA,3cjdc1,Morthyl,4,Wed Jul 8 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"I'm also confused how someone can abuse MDMA on a daily/weekly basis. It takes time for your serotonin to replenish itself. I can't imagine the effects being noticeable after the 3rd day (ask anyone about the diminished effects of rolling 2 days in a row let alone for weeks).  You should get them to test their stuff to make sure it is MDMA and not Methylone or worse.  I think that if these friends of yours are people you hold dear, you should talk to them heart to heart. Let the know you don't want them to die because that's where most drug abusers (MDMA or otherwise) tend to end up. It's a slippery slope."
MDMA,3cjdc1,ContENT_in_NYC,2,Wed Jul 8 14:13:57 2015 UTC,"I know it's baffling, I asked them how frequently they took the pills, and they said every night. I'd imagine they might skip a few days each but no more than 3 days. As what are in those pills? I can't really tell. I only tried one. And I'd also imagine not all pills are mdma, the one I took certainly was MDxx. Had all the signature qualities. Next 2 days were shit, but not as bad as I expected. I remember them talking about bad pills. So if they hit a bad one they pop just another 2 or 3 I know it's mind blowing how stupid these boys are. But trust me they are so disconnected from reality, drugs became the center of all their conversations. Talking about pill quality, bragging how many they swallowed and stuff. I doubt they have pleasant rolls, as you said once serotonin depletes it takes time to replenish. They don't know about that, and trying to explain this using simple analogies failed many times, they think I talk out of my ass and they try to convince me with their own made up theories, sigh.  I believe what they experience is some high in it's own right albeit not as pleasant as a roll would be. And I see them suffer the consequences as the effect starts wearing off as they start to get sentimental and start to talk about how bad they fucked up in life etc. Than they start to blame others for their own actions etc...  Some really depressing fucked up stuff right there."

Take MDMA (candy flip) and I roll for twice as long on half the dose.  Aside from that, if you are at a rave try standing completely still with your eyes closed. Letting the music and tension build up in your body. Only releasing when the drop comes. It's so hard to stand still when you want to do nothing but dance but you get an amazing rush.

MDMA,3cjyg0,Trueartiscan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:05:50 2015 UTC,"2cb is a great addition post rolling but nothing's going to bring the actual roll back up (except nitrous I suppose lol). You're literally emptying out your serotonin, your mood is going to be altered. Tbh I prefer tripping for a couple hours and enjoying that, then dropping the mdma towards the end of the day so when it comes down it's just time to sleep. If you trip after the roll,  often times you'll notice that the comedown is more apparent because you're more aware of the senses from tripping.  I find weed helps overall, although I have heard some people say it makes them to scatter brained to think coherently. It's fine by me tho."
MDMA,3cjyg0,Fbulol,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:40:00 2015 UTC,Wait what do you mean it's pointless to redose more than once?  I intend to take 1/2 a pill every 2 hours or so to create a gradual climb. What are you saying you can hit a point of diminished returns?
MDMA,3cjyg0,Peachy23456,2,Wed Jul 8 14:45:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I've heard previously that multiple redosing gives diminished returns - whether that's just from lack of seretonin remaining or if your brain somehow builds a resistance to it over the night I don't know. But definitely have seen mates redose 4 or so hours in and only get 20-30mins more uptime from it.   Also read that redosing creates more neurotoxicity but again I have no source so hopefully someone else can chime in.
MDMA,3cjyg0,thgiftac_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:07:51 2015 UTC,Ok I just took my first 1/2 pill. I guess the idea would be to keep taking every 2 hours until I hit a good point - then stop completely. Otherwise it's just adding toxicity for no perceived value.   I had no idea it worked like this.   Please others - chime in.....
MDMA,3cjyg0,Peachy23456,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:17:37 2015 UTC,"Usually what I see recommended almost consistently here is to redose about 90mins after your initial dose. Personally I usually drop a half, then drop another half about 30mins after I come up and that works for me.  Have a nice roll dude!  edit: Redosing every 2 hours may not be the best idea if you want to peak - you're better to take enough usually to put you 'over the threshold' with your first dose, otherwise you might be wasting some of your roll and will just end up mellow over the whole night without a real peak"
MDMA,3cjyg0,thgiftac_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:29:49 2015 UTC,Well I haven't eaten all day and that initial rush was hectic just from that 1/2. It's starting to feel more normal now though. But uncomfortably powerful at first.
MDMA,3cjyg0,Peachy23456,2,Wed Jul 8 15:46:18 2015 UTC,"An ELI5 someone once posted here is as follows:  Serotonin sits in a ""bucket"" in your brain normally (naturally) it drips out slowly, with MDMA it tips the bucket over releasing all the serotonin at once.  This is why you shouldn't redose more than once because your serotonin is out at that point and your are just causing damage to your serotonin receptors.    This is also why you shouldn't roll daily or weekly, because to refill the bucket takes a long time as your serotonin isn't normally dumped out all at once.    How scientifically accurate this is, I couldn't tell you, but it seems to make sense based on research and personal experience."
MDMA,3cjyg0,Mattya929,2,Wed Jul 8 17:02:05 2015 UTC,I like the sponge analogy.  Your brain is like a sponge filled with water (serotonin) over time.  You squeeze it (first dose) and a ton of water comes out.  You can squeeze it one more time and get a bit more water.  But after that it is dry and you have to let it re-soak and fill up.  If you keep squeezing it while it is dry you will just stress out the sponge.

MDMA,3cjyg0,FeilNerguson,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:56:09 2015 UTC,So does that mean 5 hours is the most I'll ever be able to get from a roll? Not sure how the folks at all days festivals do it unless you stay sober a few hours (or candy flip of course) .
MDMA,3cjyg0,thegroovedude,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, the best way that I've noticed to keep a roll going for a good amount of time is redosing half your initial dose about 1.5  - 2 hours in. So say you take 150mg initially, I would follow it with 75mg after about an hour & a half. Can last upwards to 6 hours this way.  Then when finally coming down from that, smoke some weed. Definitely helps bring it back some more :)"
MDMA,3cjyg0,SymphoniusRex,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:27:06 2015 UTC,"Redosing once definitely helps, and also pairing it with something else. For me, GHB about 2-3 hours in works wonders and really brings it back. I became acquainted with it via the gay community in San Francisco, haha, it's a really popular combo. The only this is, don't drink alcohol with GHB."
MDMA,3cjyg0,barlingbackbable,-1,Wed Jul 8 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"I find that reaching steady peak and staying there makes for an easier come down.

It's relatively new and not sure how EZ test was able to calibrate without a license to handle MDMA.   The test was calibrated on a 10-25-50-75-96% pure sample. http://www.eztest.com/product/ez-test-kit-for-mdma-purity/   But regardless, if they were able to calibrate it, it's still just indicative of the quality of your sample, not definitive.  Here is a link to my results for comparison. This is what is being claimed as 84% pure on the DNM. https://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/39nmhj/ez_test_mdma_purity_results_description_in/"

MDMA,3cfvmf,baconmma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:51:22 2015 UTC,"Dopamine is necessary for your ability to create memories. The presence of alcohol in your system affects your dopamine levels so this is the real contributor to your memory loss. The MD's are responsible for release of several neurotransmitters, largely serotonin and in a lesser amount dopamine. Drugs tend to pronounce your current mood which is why you should generally only drop while you're already on an up or feeling good, if you're brooding or thinking about what 'might' happen, unfortunately you're brain will help realise this idea. That's not to say you should't drop, but next time if you want to, you should be with friends who's company you enjoy and vice versa and maybe no drinks or stop at two to take your edge off if you like.

(it's a douchey club I've never been to before, and wasn't a big fan of the crowd and staff)   I reckon this might be the main thing here, I've had rolls where I wasnt really enjoying the atmosphere and it felt like a very subdued roll. You've probably heard it before but set & setting have a big effect. Were you tired when you took it?"
MDMA,3cgkw9,thgiftac_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:16:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had just eaten a big meal and haven't had a disco nap due to a long Friday at work."
MDMA,3cgkw9,-DR34D-,6,Wed Jul 8 03:37:51 2015 UTC,"but I can attest to the fact that it is in fact MDMA: first judging from its bitter/acidic taste. Also I went to a warehouse party in March and took two 100mg capsules of it: I had the greatest time on the dance floor, and even caught some glances ""I wanna have what he's having!"" LOL   I don't really understand how you have come to the conclusion it is MDMA? You can't tell from taste. Many, many drugs are bitter.  The pink colouration suggests to me that it could potentially be methylone. I think you would be best using a testkit to confirm this.  MDMA wouldn't have gone bad, it's a very stable molecule.  I'm not sure why you've had such varying results from the same batch, perhaps you just got part of the bag that contained more impurities? Difficult to say really."
MDMA,3cgkw9,CoffeeNSquats,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:11:19 2015 UTC,"True. It tastes like the other stuff I've had before, but without a chemical test can't be 100% sure.  Before I put it in capsules I did grind it and mix it up pretty good using a razor, so all caps have the same content."
MDMA,3cgkw9,RazorHaze101,2,Tue Jul 7 22:15:39 2015 UTC,"Was it the exact same batch as earlier in the year, or did you rebuy from the same guy who had the same batch?"
MDMA,3cg4sa,redandruthless,6,Tue Jul 7 17:25:38 2015 UTC,"If it is your first time, start with a small dosage at about 1.5 mg/kg. Maybe even 1.75 mg/kg. 100 lbs is about 45.3592 kg. So this would translate into 68 mg or 80 mg. You could even up it by a little bit, too to like 90 mg. So 70-90 mg should be a pretty safe dosage.  There is always a risk while taking any drug, though. This sub is about harm reduction for those who will be using anyway. So also stay hydrated (not too much, not too little) and keep body temperature normal. She should be fine.  Also, always test your product!  EDIT: Keep in mind that 90 mg is about 2 mg/kg, which could be fairly strong for a first timer."
MDMA,3cg4sa,BobbleheadDoll,3,Tue Jul 7 17:40:27 2015 UTC,Just dose according to her weight.  She's most likely not going to die.  1.5mg/kg
MDMA,3cg4sa,snapchats,2,Tue Jul 7 17:40:17 2015 UTC,"Number 1 rule. Always. Regardless of weight is keep hydrated - and she should be good. I personally would think overweight or heavier people would have more complications, because of the way MDMA raises your internal body temp.   edit:formatting was funky using the number symbol...."
MDMA,3cg4sa,liberosismaniac,2,Tue Jul 7 19:35:28 2015 UTC,I think they both have problems just different ones. For overweight people it's the temperature but underweight people have less reserves so they need to be extra careful to stay hydrated and fed.
MDMA,3cg4sa,BhiQ,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:39:01 2015 UTC,"very true! As a smaller build guy - i have to drink shitloads of water, i sweat like a siv."
MDMA,3cg4sa,liberosismaniac,2,Tue Jul 7 19:47:26 2015 UTC,I weigh 95 lbs on my heaviest days and my sweet spot is 120-130 mg. Less is usually very underwhelming.
MDMA,3cg4sa,idafje,2,Tue Jul 7 21:51:51 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain that the 1.5 mg/kg figure comes from studies on rats, which cant really describe the subjective effects. The physiological effects (which is what the scientists performing the study were likely looking at most closely) might be very similar to a higher dosage but with a less pronounced subjective effects, so that makes sense.. Ive always been kinda skeptical of people suggestion 60 to 80 mg doses even for smaller people.. it just seems like that would be barely enough to feel good.. unless you're like UNDER 100 lbs which is seems fairly uncommon for an adult of any gender"
MDMA,3cg4sa,n1ll0,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:54:30 2015 UTC,"Just stick to the 1,5mg/kg dosage!"

Only when I have taken a lot of MDMA with multiple redoses I've gotten some weird symptoms, like being unable to move my fingers when they get 'stuck' in a weird position and hurt but I doubt that has anything to do with my weight rather than redosing one time too many..  Your friend should be fine, just remember to hydrate and have a good time.  edit: Forgot to mention your friend might need to drink a lot more water than you, after my first proper roll I actually passed out from not drinking enough water. I was walking and BAM, everything went black and when I came to I found myself clutching the end of a table. I had only had 1 and a half pills that night, no clue what the dose was though. So yeah, water."
MDMA,3cg4sa,EasterGirl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:55:32 2015 UTC,I weight 100lbs. I always had 100-120 mg per roll. That's enough for me. 80-100mg would be a fine dose for the fisrt time.  Tell her to space out the rolls and everything should be fine !

MDMA,3cgd5q,sarom058,4,Tue Jul 7 18:23:13 2015 UTC,"First of all, test your MDMA. Second of all, if you guys weigh more than 50 kg, you might consider getting more MDMA. Start off with somewhere between 1.5 and 2 mg/kg.  To deal with comedown, hold each other and comfort each other, maybe have sex if you can. You can also smoke weed, take xanax, sleeping pills, or melatonin.  To make sure it is safe, test your product. Also, stay hydrated (not too much or too little) and maintain a normal body temperature."
MDMA,3cgd5q,BobbleheadDoll,2,Tue Jul 7 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"Also, I don't really have a lab to test my MDMA; what should it taste like, smell like, etc? I'd there a way to test it without buying something online?"
MDMA,3cgd5q,BobbleheadDoll,2,Tue Jul 7 19:33:09 2015 UTC,No. You can buy a kit online for pretty cheap though.

MDMA,3chzxw,k_phamster15,2,Wed Jul 8 01:39:46 2015 UTC,"you should just take two halves on one day and save the other pill for another time.. it likely wont feel anywhere NEAR as good as the first day, and the hangover is gonna be terrible  EDIT: also you shouldn't take the second half more than 90 minutes after the initial dose, it will just feel more speedy and you probably wont get the same empathogenic euphoria"
MDMA,3chzxw,n1ll0,2,Wed Jul 8 02:15:13 2015 UTC,"Orange Tesla can have 220-250mg of MDMA based on the batch you have, which is more than enough for one day. Don't drop double days. Just go half half and you'll be good for 4+ hours  Cya there!"
MDMA,3chzxw,shitlord_traplord,2,Wed Jul 8 04:31:07 2015 UTC,I did 2 and a half at beyond and had a terrible time cause the roll was so strong. If you like that kind of roll then go for it but I'm never going to do that again 😅

MDMA,3chzxw,lastkoruptor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:33:55 2015 UTC,I'd say 2 pills each day is pretty crazy. Doing just 1 pill got me through a night at edc 1/2 first and 1/2 later. It smacked me REALLY REALLY hard initially when it kicked in. Please be safe.
MDMA,3cft6c,damiancockburn,2,Tue Jul 7 16:05:22 2015 UTC,"i believe its actually the other way around.. cannabis IS a hallucinogen, but it only has mild psychedelic effects at large dosages.. MDA on the other hand is a hallucinogenic stimulant which is a good bit more psychedelic (its not uncommon to have mild hallucinations with even a moderate dose of MDA by itself), so it was likely the cannabis that potentiated the unmetabolized MDA.."

MDMA,3cbrn5,SSASERTPO,2,Mon Jul 6 20:17:39 2015 UTC,100% this. I just posted a wall of text last night. I took more pills than I could probably handle and my comedown was twos days later than I expected. But holy shit was it bad. Feel free to read and get the whole rundown.

Rewatching  Skrillex at paradiso, particularly the lion King bit (a movie which already has deep personal significance to me) was too much,  but I pushed through.   Even watching Under The Electric Sky helped,  hearing those people's stories was awesome... Minus the long distance couple (New York/Japan), those feels hit like a brick wall."

Not surprised at all reading this.  To provide an example, early on when I started experimenting with MDMA, I was able to see my own subconsciousness in amazing HD quality simply by closing my eyes. I saw way too much facebook, reddit and league of legends going on, so I kicked the habits to an agreeable extent. I actually have time to do important stuff in my life again."

MDMA,3c9ytr,hotvomitmilkshake,2,Mon Jul 6 06:47:44 2015 UTC,"Go with LSD first as tripping after your roll will be very, very strange and eerie due to the serotonin depletion. Trust me, I've done it before and suffice to say that I will never do that again.  Like the other poster said, there is a cross tolerance, but it's slight. I wouldn't even worry about it."
MDMA,3c9ytr,gixxerfanatic,2,Mon Jul 6 16:25:08 2015 UTC,"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/1969270/  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/8388988/  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23333599/  There's a cross tolerance. And it depends on how hard you barrage your 5ht system. Fortunately LSD's decrease of the saturation of receptors is time dependent and only lasts a few days (aka non-neurotoxic).   It all depends on the person. Rolling the day after tripping has lead to very decreased experiences, commonly.   Any substance that functions through the same monoamine transporters will have a cross tolerance with another.   Try taking LSD one day and 2c-b the next. The properties of their function is very different, however think of it like this.   You rub out a nice fucking nut. And then you try again immediately. It doesn't work so good, and you're super sensitive. That's essentially down regulation. And that's what causes tolerance."
MDMA,3c9ytr,snapchats,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:45:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm aware that they work through the same channels, but I'm skeptical as to whether down regulation from a 100-300 ug dose of lsd is really enough to make the roll any less significant the following day. I feel like I'd roll just as hard. Maybe not, I haven't tried it.   I've gone from mdma into 2cb hours later without ever having that down regulation affect my 2cb tolerance.   Either way, there's no way I'd roll before the last night of a festival, because I'm absolutely done the next day."
MDMA,3c9ytr,gixxerfanatic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:36:39 2015 UTC,"Ok. So I have tried it, and so have other people I know. And while thats anecdotal, we all experienced the same effects, with tried and tested MDMA.   This lead me to look into the subject because I was so fucking confused as to what happened. I was under the impression there was no cross tolerance? Of course taking 200ug of LSD shouldn't cause any problems.  But there was. A friend tried it again (for science), and same issue.  Also taking 2c-b to prolong and MDMA trip makes sense, the brain can be fooled while still stimulated.  I think its fair to roll the last day of the festival, and honestly 48 hours later, the tolerance will be down significantly. Much less than rolling the next day.  But, there will be a tolerance."

MDMA,3c9ytr,gixxerfanatic,2,Tue Jul 7 01:11:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd say like 50mg. HOWEVER, for me I tripped one day and rolled the next. I'm not sure how it would be for someone else, or someone else two days later.  Its just something to be aware of, so that there's no overdoing it because you ""don't feel it yet."" And not to go overboard because that increases chances of neurotoxicity."

Although LSD is not neurotoxic, it will have a cross tolerance with MDMA.  Strangely, many find that taking the MDMA first alleviates that cross tolerance, but can lead to an uncomfortable experience due to the serotonin deficit.   Be aware of this. I however very much approve of this festival schedule.  Although, taking LSD for your first time at a music festival could be very, very uncomfortable and overstimulating."

MDMA,3cadul,GhostlyFireCunt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:48:31 2015 UTC,"1) Was the pill you took two years ago tested? That doesn't sound like MDMA. It sounds like you were having a psychedelic trip and not rolling. Was there anything else you remember from the experience? Was the come up hard for you? Did you feel like it was too much?  2) If you haven't done MDMA since your last experience where you had an anxiety attack, you should  not be taking MDMA at a festival. You should experiment at home or in a comfortable and safe environment.   3) Is the MDMA you're going to be taking tested?   4) You're not going to be rolling throughout the whole festival if you do choose to go. With MDMA you can have an initial dosage and one redose but after that, you're doing more harm than by wasting your MDMA on chasing a peak you won't reach again."
MDMA,3cadul,kanad3,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:50:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for replying.  1) No, but the pill I got was from a good friend with ''good'' connections. He also used this pill, without any problems. My trippartner was also fine, although he did mention that he was hallucinating a bit.   The trip itself was fine and nice, other than the glassess and minor anxiety attack. The hangover however was terrible, was depressed for a week. With depressed I mean truly depressed and anxious.  2) Thank you for this solid piece of advice.  3) Tested with a home kit, not in a lab.  4) Sorry what do you mean with this, I dont quite understand.

MDMA,3c8dq5,psychedelic_dude,3,Sun Jul 5 21:26:57 2015 UTC,Ime the two are best used alone or in succession.
MDMA,3c8dq5,uwotMD,5,Sun Jul 5 21:33:29 2015 UTC,Take the 2c-b towards the end of your MDMA peak.
MDMA,3c8dq5,snapchats,2,Sun Jul 5 21:33:38 2015 UTC,"Agree with this!   I always take it about 90 minutes after come up. Since 2cb usually takes an hour to kick in, you should start to feel the effects towards the end of the peak (which for me, makes any comedown virtually nonexistent)."
MDMA,3c8dq5,rollingballzzz,3,Mon Jul 6 01:17:49 2015 UTC,"MDMA first, then 75 minutes after your peak starts, I just set my timer for 2.5 hours from first dropping, take 15-20mg of 2C-B. Take your normal dose of MDMA, or a little lower if it normally causes real memory issues."
MDMA,3c8dq5,tolderoll156,2,Sun Jul 5 22:17:19 2015 UTC,"Depends on the desired length of the trip and how long mdma lasts for you. Typically swim alternates a dose every hour.  100mg mdma, 10mg 2cb, 100mg mdma, 5mg 2cb. Swim separates the two middle dosages by an hour and a half if necessary.   Someone else I know does 3 and 3.   Many say to take it during the end, but I completely disagree. Swim took an extra 10 instead of a 5 near the end, coupled with the anxiety from the comedown and tripping too hard, had a reallllly bad trip. Swim prefers to space out everything.  Swims boyfriend does 3 and 3, spacing them out every hour and thinks the two together are great, doesn't like using them separately.   Swim+swims boyfriend have done this for the past 7 rolls.   Initially, swim did 5mg as they were coming off and that helped a bit with the anxiety. But 10-15mg during the middle and near the end seems to work the best.   Both swim and boyfriend did not alter the mdma dosage. It is synergistic, but only a little. Just start slowly. Dose 10mg at first and wait at least 1 1/2 hrs before you redose 2cb. It has this funny way of doing a roller coaster of changing intensity. After the first 10, I'd say to do 5mg each dosage (the first time you try both together) to get a good judge of what your tolerance is with the two together."

MDMA,3c8dq5,roxypotter13,2,Mon Jul 6 09:16:13 2015 UTC,Good idea :) just experiment with it. They're a great match! One of the favorite things to experience was sitting in the trunk of the car by the subwoofers and having closed-eyed visuals of melting rainbows while feeling the bass. That was on 200mg mdma and 10mg 2cb. (over the course of 5-6 hours).
MDMA,3c8dq5,roxypotter13,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"I am gonna take it at a nightclub , I hope everything will be cool ... and not too overwhelming ( because of the music and too much noise )  But in case I am gonna feel bad, I just go out for a smoke and relax"
MDMA,3c8dq5,baconmma,3,Mon Jul 6 17:42:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the only concern I have for 2cb mix is that you have a VERY short attention span. Like, you get distracted super easily. A nightclub shouldn't be an issue. But sending two friends who were honey flipping on a mission to get water at a festival was a mistake lol. ""Oooh... look a the lights!"" ""no, no we have to get water! .... oh those are nice lights."" Took them forever to come back lol.   2cb is super dose sensitive, though. On low doses with mdma you usually just get the floor breathing kind of thing. The roll is a bit more intense, longer lasting. A bit of the short attention span. Nice closed eyed visuals. Some of my friends get tracers.   On 10 I experienced that little bit (with the aforementioned 200mg mdma). Then I accidentally took another 10mg instead of just an extra 5 and went way over the edge. Started having a panic attack for no reason. And then was tripping wayyyy too hard. Thoughts were super convoluted. Crazy fractals for open-eyed visuals. Distortion of faces. I'm really sensitive, though. Hence the warning of pacing yourself.   I always recommend having a buddy who is slightly more sober than you lol Or someone you trust who is on the same trip haha."

The thing that I don't understand is that the DOD even lists on their page that it is 3 days tops to detect it at 500NG. I seriously don't understand the math or the logic that goes into it.

Up to 90% of your serotonin is in your gastrointestinal tract in Enterochromaffin cells. Serotonin activates secretory and peristaltic reflexes in your GI tract when released and you're dumping all your stores with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine.   I've heard of people taking Imdoium prior, but I usually just accept it and carry some wet wipes for cleanup and tums for nausea."

MDMA,3c3fvj,Factor1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:19:47 2015 UTC,Guess its just a different part of your senses being focused on.

MDMA,3c4opd,threeinchesoffury,2,Sat Jul 4 20:17:15 2015 UTC,"It is more complicated than that.  Some serotonin changes may just be your body making less serotonin or serotoinin transporter.

MDMA,3c4opd,Allabputeeeeee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:00:06 2015 UTC,"I've been in a similar situation myself (but with other drugs, not mdma) where I couldn't sleep for about 36 hours, slept for about 4 then stayed awake for another 36 hours. I was quite worried too. In terms of getting to sleep, it's probs best to stay awake and be active during the day and then try to sleep at night when it's dark and you're naturally supposed to sleep. The sleeplessness should go away eventually once the effects wear off. Worrying about it will only make it worse cause your body will release adrenaline. Once you get some sleep you'll feel better. Then every day after that you'll continue to feel better. You'll probably feel a bit off for about 4 days. That being said, if you feel like you're getting worse you could always visit your doctor."

MDMA,3c4opd,elderdabs,0,Sun Jul 5 17:07:13 2015 UTC,I call bull shit.    No way on earth you took 1 gram of mdma.    I have descent tolerance and 200mg or a full pressed fucks me up pretty good.    500mg is a bad time with eyes rolling back of your head.    At 1 gram you will be fucked up for a week.    You didn't test it and have no idea west you took cuz 1 gram all at once would be a horrible time.
MDMA,3c4opd,Allabputeeeeee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:30:39 2015 UTC,"I took 200mg at first, then 100mg 2 hours later, then 700mg another hour later, not shitting you man. I got it from a really popular vendor on the dark net and a lot of other people said their tests came out perfect. I'm just happy to be alive"
MDMA,3c4opd,elderdabs,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:51:04 2015 UTC,"You will be fine.  It will take a long time for your serotonin receptors to heal so no drugs for at least 6 to 8 months.   At 1 gram you should have puked and shit yourself for reals,  I highly doubt you took real m,  most likely cut with other agents.    It's not about how much you have flushed serotonin,  it's about damaging the receptors,  cuz dopamine destroys serotonin receptors and that is not good.  You can recover serotonin levels but It takes for ever to heal serotonin receptors if not never.  At 1gram, you flushed a lot of dopamine after flushing out all your serotonin.   Never ever do dopamine flushing drugs like coke around m.   Take 200mg of 5htp on complete empty stomach with 200mg of ECGC in the morning for at least a week,  best if you can handle it for 2 weeks because it's not easy.  I am used to it and barely want to throw up anymore.    Start with 100mg of ECGC and work yourself up, like I said, you really are going feel like puking.    You might feel extremely euphoric and happy,  so take advantage of it and play some happy music   Try not to puke and hold it in, ECGC green tree extract is very difficult to hold it in on empty stomach.  It you can take 1mg of m,  than you can handle this.  This in the only way you can cross the BBB with 5htp.   BBB stands for blood brain barrier.    You need to take some xanax before you sleep, you need to sleep a lot. Sleep is the best way to heal your brain and xanax temporarily will help you sleep deep."
MDMA,3c4opd,Allabputeeeeee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:50:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much, I'll pick up all three of those. Do you think I should stop using cannabis as well?"
MDMA,3c4opd,Allabputeeeeee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:04:00 2015 UTC,"Cannabis is fine, but nothing wrong with just being clean for now.  .    But if you are taking xanax, leave all drugs alone and live in the real world.  Xanax will knocked you out without getting high.    If you suffer, than suffer and remind yourself how bad it was so you never do it again Try not to escape by using Cannabis.   If you puke,  then start even smaller on ECGC and work yourself up.   For the first few days take 300mg of 5htp, then down to 200mg with ecgc   Never ever take 5htp while taking m,  cuz it can kill you."

MDMA,3c3pkr,luring,2,Sat Jul 4 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"There was a qualitative analysis done on the associated risk of concomitant use of MDMA & SSRIs, the discussion ends with the suggestion that there is little risk involved. You are correct in thinking there will be diminished desired effects.  If you think of the neuropharm involved this makes a fair amount of sense."
MDMA,3c3pkr,uwotMD,2,Sat Jul 4 14:26:27 2015 UTC,It was my understanding that MAOIs with MDMA lead to serotonin syndrome. SSRIs just make it far less effective. I've even heard of people taking an SSRI at the end of the night to reduce neurotoxicity.
MDMA,3c3pkr,MusicFoMe,2,Sat Jul 4 16:15:39 2015 UTC,"While this used to be thought as a good plan for reducing neurotoxicity it has lately  been suggested that the neurotoxic effects actually occur (mostly) during the roll, so taking an SSRI on the come-down most likely has very little efficacy in the reducing of neurotoxicity in the brain."
MDMA,3c3pkr,rocketno40,2,Sat Jul 4 17:02:33 2015 UTC,"I, too, have seen people suggest SSRIs + MDMA will lead to serotonin syndrome, which I'm a tad confused about, because it's not true.    SSRIs simply have a higher affinity to serotonin receptors than MDMA, so what happens is the MDMA just gets metabolized and very little happens because the SSRI is being a bully and clogging all the receptors anyway.  When people (like me) suggest you quit SSRIs for about a week before rolling (with doctor guidance of course, many times you're not suppose to quit these cold turkey!) it is for a reason none other than making the MDMA mechanism work and has nothing to do with serotonin syndrome or some other kind of neurotoxic damage.  MAOIs, however, very bad.  Because these inhibit a breakdown process necessary to save receptors from becoming fatigue.  This will cause serotonin syndrome and can dangerously raise body temperature among many other (potentially fatal) effects.  MAOIs and MDMA are NEVER, EVER to be taken together."
MDMA,3c3pkr,rocketno40,2,Sat Jul 4 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"Just start on baby doses, there's no need for large doses. I am on an SSRI and I have the best relationship with MDxA compounds."

MDMA,3c46gd,threeinchesoffury,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:50:38 2015 UTC,Kk so would 50mdma and 60mda start and 50 boost mdma be good or do you suggest just all at once?
MDMA,3c46gd,threeinchesoffury,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:32:33 2015 UTC,I'd do 80 and 50. Redose one time so needed. Take too much mda and you'll be talking gibberish pretty quick
MDMA,3c45ss,Peachy23456,2,Sat Jul 4 16:31:41 2015 UTC,"Great little story. I'm happy that you are getting your life back on track in terms of seeing what you need to do to be happy and working towards bringing yourself out of the depression you have been suffering. MDMA really is an incredible substance and the possibilities and uses of it, in a respected manor, can be truly incredible. One bit of advice I would like to give you, if that's ok, is to treat MDMA with the respect it deserves. Your plan to take 3 pills the next time you roll is not wise in my opinion. I know you are experienced in using MDMA in your past but the pills floating around these days are often of very good quality and very high quantity. It's not uncommon to find pills containing up to 200mg of MDMA. I'm guessing your British or Irish as you drink your beer in pints. So as a fellow pint drinker, I can vouch for the amount of good quality pills that are usually sold around these parts nowadays. If you want your next experience to be more profound and euphoric I would recommend dropping one whole pill, see how you go with it and if you reach your peak and are feeling in the mood for a re-dose, another half a pill will be fine. Try and find out what pills you've got so you can check the quality/quantity. This will be easy if there is a print/logo on the pill. If there isn't post a pic on this subreddit and see if someone can help in identifying it. Peace brother. Happy rolling!"
MDMA,3c45ss,WanderingTheMind,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:46:03 2015 UTC,"""This has now changed, and Ecstasy is a combination of MDMA and (usually uppers of some kind).""  I disagree. I think there ae far more pure MDMA pills on the market now. When I was taking pills in the early to late nineties, Ecstasy came as either MDMA, MDA and MDEA - MDEA being the weakest of the three, but still fun. Also, most pills were mixtures of those chemicals, or had other things like caffeine, ephedrine and amphetamine in them too. I think they're purer now and I don't think you really hear of MDEA or MDA in pills anymore. As I say, MDEA was like MDMA lite, MDA on the other hand was a lot heavier and trippier.  A lot of old schoolers will swear ecstasy was better back then, and that the way they synth MDMA now using different precursors makes for a poorer product. I disagree - I think it was the fact that pills were more of a mixture that made them more fun. Along with the fact that it was a new experience and you had little or no tolerance at first.   ""and after a few weeks the time came when I got rather than MDMA - Ecstasy.""  I don't understand this either. Ecstasy is MDMA is Ecstasy. Do you mean you got pills instead of crystal?  I still take it occassionaly, and I always make sure I test and source decent pills or good crystal, but I've got to say that it's still not as much fun as it was back then.    I'm rambling a bit, but my point is that I think you're far more likely to get a pure MDMA pill now than you were back then, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're more enjoyable.    As for it being of medical value in curing depression - I think you're way off with that one. It'll only exacerbate the situation, especially if you take it regularly. Shuglin recommended 3-4 times a year max to get the best benefits from it. (I think)"
MDMA,3c45ss,hashmon,-1,Sat Jul 4 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"Firstly I agree that when I originally had taken E, Ecstasy was synonymous for MDMA, but from what I now know from the last week of research is that MDMA pills are just that MDMA.   The times have changed.   Ecstasy now is a term used for a pill that should contain some MDMA and other substances.   Google - Molly vs MDMA.   Or watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTtqxuRHD0w"
MDMA,3c45ss,djme,0,Sat Jul 4 21:35:59 2015 UTC,"You have completely misunderstood, because I am saying the complete opposite of that. I am speaking from a British perspective but In the 90's Ecstasy meant MDMA but also included two other compounds. This trio of compounds, MDMA, MDA (Adam) or MDEA(Eve) were considered to be Ecstasy. But true Ecstasy, for want of a better phrase, is and always has been MDMA.   But yeah, the only bit we agree on is that pills now are more likely to be pure MDMA than before, but there is still plenty of crap. Go to pill reports and see the results of thousands of tests and you will see there are plenty of adulterated pills out there. PMA and PMMA being the real problematic ones.  Nowadays, just because there are more compounds that mimic MDMA, doesn't mean that people class them as Ecstasy. At least not over here, in Britain.  That video is a lot of crap - Things like MDVP, Methamphetamine etc are not ecstasy,  and nobody in Bitain would class them or bk-mdma or any of the rc that she mentioed as being true Ecstasy.   I'm not going to argue over semantics, but the girl in that video talks nonsense. Any pill on pill reports that tested for MDVP or methamphetamine would be marked as adulterated as it's not true ecstasy."

MDMA,3c29yl,ccs514,2,Sat Jul 4 02:27:15 2015 UTC,"How sure are you that the dose was measured properly? What you are describing sounds really quite typical of a high dose of MDMA.  Alternatively, what was your state going into it? Were you tired? How much sleep had you had? Had you eaten? Have you been taking any other drugs or supplements? Maybe had you just had significantly more cannabis than last time?"
MDMA,3c29yl,deearcue,2,Sat Jul 4 02:58:12 2015 UTC,"I've tested this stuff to know that it is MDMA and I have a scale that reads .001g. I calibrate/test my scales every time I use them and it was perfectly calibrated. I was kinda drained from running errands that morning, but by the time I took the MDMA I was feeling much better. I wondered if it was my smoking weed prior. I don't recall what strain I smoked, but I felt very anxious. I took a 1mg Xanax (an hour before the MDMA) and it somewhat helped. Last I took a dose of this MDMA I felt very calm and actually got some nice sleep. This time I was very hyper for an hour, then tired so laid down. I hadn't slept the night before (horrid chronic insomnia issues). I've smoked weed before MDMA, but most of the time I'd wait till after to smoke. Do you think it was the lack of sleep combined with a weed strain that increased my anxiety?"
MDMA,3c29yl,MDAzing,2,Sat Jul 4 06:24:41 2015 UTC,not sleeping the night prior probably is the culprit.
MDMA,3c29yl,deearcue,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:15:31 2015 UTC,"Sleep dep and the weed certainly seem adequate to explain it. (I never combine cannabis with other drugs myself, as it has a tendency to make me anxious, but I have heard that the combination can potentiate and change the effects of the other drugs.)  Also, in general drug experiences can be a bit unpredictable. All the subtleties of your mindset and physiological state going into it can really shape the experience."
MDMA,3c29yl,threeinchesoffury,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:57:00 2015 UTC,"This is a similar experience to staying up all night and smoking at the end.  Weed ALWAYS makes me hallucinate and get the dumbs.  Your dosage is minuscule, it's not enough to cause any harm really."
MDMA,3c29yl,threeinchesoffury,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:42:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't think it was enough to cause harm at all, I enjoy MDMA at rather low doses. I've never hallucinated from weed before, even on nights I can't sleep. I guess I wasn't expecting such a reaction on MDMA because usually it makes me very calm."
MDMA,3c29yl,n1ll0,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:42:48 2015 UTC,yeah it has a weird interaction with mdma for me.
MDMA,3c29yl,Le_Tabernacle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:02:51 2015 UTC,i feel like a lot of people underestimate the effect of set and setting have with hallucinogens that are less classically psychedelic such as MDMA.. Ive taken equivalent doses of the same batch of mdma and felt completely different from one setting and set to another.. e.g. one time I went to an edm event and was balls to the wall dancing feeling excellent and then another time I was at a smaller concert and just hanging out with my friends and i rolled with the same dose from the same batch and it was a much more mellow experience
MDMA,3c29yl,brandononrails,2,Sat Jul 4 15:33:43 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, I certainly didn't expect the effects to be what they were, especially considering how low I dose. Your comment was very helpful. When I found out a friend could find it, I got an 8th to last me a good while, so these last two were from the same batch. It wasn't scary, but now I know these effects are potentially possible even at a low dose. The other time I'd taken a slightly higher dose from this batch and felt incredibly mellow, so much so I ended up falling asleep for a few hours (woke up feeling absolutely refreshed and the MDMA was still working so the rest of the night was very chill). Thank you for your comment :)"

MDMA,3c29yl,DrabSavage,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"(Ps; yes I test my stuff. My connect does before me and then I also test it myself with my kit. It came out pretty damn pure, only the MDMA colours showed from the reagent reader thing)   Just a quick note (not trying to be a dick) purity can't be tested using a test kit.  My first thought when I read what you were feeling was that you may have gotten a batch of MDA (would show up exactly the same with Marquis, Mecke, and Mandelin reagents). I believe on a Folin kit would be able to tell the difference."

If you took 300mg as a first timer, maybe that wasnt MDMA ? Did u tested it ? As first time 300mg should be rolling hard, even hallucinations and stuff like that  I don't know what to say about your case, just to say low a little bit that dose , is way too much ( is for your brain )"
MDMA,3c1o66,psychedelic_dude,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:13:26 2015 UTC,I was rolling really hard and a lot of pieces are blurry. It was tested twice by myself and a friend of mine just to be sure. He was the more experienced one and he usually does 200mg and then redoses an hour later.  I've been doing a lot of research and I still not sure what dose to do. My friend says 100mg is almost nothing with hardly any rolling and that's why I did 3. I did it as 100mg and then an hour later took 2 more. Doing more research I learned to not do that.
MDMA,3c1o66,MothEnt,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:07:18 2015 UTC,"Oooops , dude never take 100mg then redose with x2 amout of first dosage , go for 200mg, then 100mg   The redose is always half of first dosage, doing 100mg u already realase a lot of serotonin , then 200mg is worthless , you cant get anohter peak , is a waste however if u redose with half of your first dose 90 later it will increasse your roll , i dont doubt 200mg redose also increasse it , but what about neurotoxicity ?

MDMA,3c1kh9,psychedelic_dude,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:01:28 2015 UTC,"The best redose time IMO is 90min later with 1/2 of inital dose, If you redose like 2-3h later it wont give you really much, just increasse a little bit the duration of roll, is worthless  I always redose 90min and I got like "" another peak "" obviously not as first one but is damn good   Cheers"

For a first timer, 100mg should be a really good dose to let you feel the magic for the first time. If you're feeling good about 90min after you've taken it and it's already kicked in, you could consider another 50mg as a booster to extend the experience.  Other then that, make sure you're with people you like and trust and get ready for a great time :)  Be sure to stay hydrated, especially more so if you're dancing! Smoking weed is fine, but you might feel like it clouds the experience especially for your first time (either save it for another day or for the comedown)  Hope that helps! :)"

I had maybe one minute of anxiety due to a large crowd but that went away in a minute. Then I rolled pretty hard and it was great. Enjoy it man and be safe!

Nothing too serious, just a little queasy and antsy. If you have a nice quiet, cool, well ventilated place to retreat to for a little bit, you'll be just fine.   You most likely won't have any significant trouble, but if you end up upset, remember: you chose to do this. You took some chemicals that affect your brain in certain ways, you did this on purpose, you knew what you were doing. Trust your past self.

But I've been taking ravesafer packs the last 3 times I've rolled and I've still had an amazing time and woke up for work the next day soooo the benefit for me totally outweighs any ""lesser"" roll (personally, i can't tell either way if the roll is less but there are people that claim this)."

We have a whole ritual for the night. We drop, then get cleaned up in the shower/bath(feels amazing on the come up!), turn off all of the lights off except a black light and a red bulb, turn on our X-mix, and proceed to have fun! She always surprises me with a new outfit or lingerie! She starts out dancing for me, in which that turnes into a lot of touching/kissing/sucking/fucking for the night! We absolutely always look forward to our monthly ""couples therapy"" night!"

MDMA,3bxgc5,aoestnhuaou,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:36:21 2015 UTC,"I went through a period of about 6 months where I had 4 intense rolls, all with redoses. In the following months, I noticed a marked change in my verbal memory and just like you I struggled to remember words. I sometimes even had trouble stringing sentences together, and I would hesitate when I spoke.   I think part of it was damage from the drug, but part of it was also my anxiety about it and my increased awareness of the moments when my memory lapsed. Whenever I forgot a word, I immediately assumed it was due to MDMA. As time passed, I became less anxious about this and the lapses seemed to reduce in frequency (or at least, I became less aware of them). Now, it no longer bothers me and I don't feel like my memory is different to how it was before.  I would recommend giving it a few weeks or months and seeing if it improves. The brain is resilient and it's extremely unlikely that you've done permanent noticeable damage to your memory from one very small dose. In the meantime, avoid MDMA, and maybe weed too since weed can contribute to the fogginess. You can look into caffeine (even just green tea), modafinil, or other supplements to boost alertness if it's really bothering you."

MDMA,3bx9ib,BuchnerFun,4,Thu Jul 2 22:24:02 2015 UTC,"What advice are you looking for? Pill reports suggests these are between 220 and 250 mg, so yeah, they sound pretty strong. Do you guys only have one pill, though? If you break that up into quarters, you might have another underwhelming experience: only about 60 mg per quarter.  If you want to roll on the light side, then take about 1.5 mg/kg. For your wife, that's about 80 mg, so about 1/3 of the pill. For you, I don't know how much you weigh, but you should probably take more. If you weigh a little less than twice her weight, then take close to 2/3 of the pill.  Otherwise, I suggest getting two pills, have your wife start with 1/3 to 1/2 of the pill, and you can start with 1/2 to 3/4 of the pill. Then redose with your remaining pills, and your wife could redose with just 1/4 to 1/3 (and maybe give you the remaining pill, or you guys can snort or plug the rest)."
MDMA,3bx9ib,BobbleheadDoll,2,Thu Jul 2 22:31:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice and I appreciate you doing the math for me.   I'd take the whole thing myself, we have one orange Tesla and one generic white capsule I was told had about 150mgs of MDMA.   I get very over-protective of my wife when it comes to drugs, your dosage and titration instructions were fantastic.   Essentially I just want us both to have a good time, not roll so hard that we get overwhelmed or lose our inhibitions beyond reason, but enough to have a legit MDMA experience.  We're both professionals so we don't get too many opportunities to party like we used to, so essentially I just want her to have a great time without becoming overwhelmed. Like I said in my OP I don't know if I've even had legitimate molly before, and I'm completely dedicated to gathering as much info as possible.   I know MDMA has a very high LD-50 but I don't want her to burn out or become anxious/confused, we've got our water-bottles, electrolyte packets to avoid water intoxication, and a big bottle of 5-HTP for bed-time and the next day, gum to counter-act any trisma, and multi-vitamin gummies to munch on all night.   We've also got etizolam (a CNS depressant) to counter-act the come-down and get us to sleep Saturday since we've got to be back home by Sunday night.   Have I covered all my bases?"
MDMA,3bx9ib,snapchats,5,Thu Jul 2 23:04:26 2015 UTC,You are more than prepared.  But you and your wife definitely should take different doses.  My SO is 100lbs and takes half of what I take and rolls as hard if not harder than I.
MDMA,3bx9ib,BobbleheadDoll,3,Thu Jul 2 23:18:11 2015 UTC,"Okay. Well the best way to be extra safe is to test your pills and your generic capsule. That way you can be sure that what you have contains MDMA.  As far as supplements go, check out the supplement post on the sidebar. It is great. At the very least, get some Vitamin C and Alpha Lipoic Acid for antioxidants. Also, you can get chelated Magnesium supplements to help attenuate the mouth-grinding effects.  How much do you weigh? Seems like you guys have more than enough MDMA to have a good time. One thing that is important is to make sure you start with a high enough dose. Somewhere between 1.5 and 1.75 mg/kg would be perfect for you guys. For your wife, that is somewhere between 80 and 90 mg. She could safely go up to 100 mg, too if she wants. Some people go up to 2 mg/kg and even higher to start, but this is getting into the ""rollling balls"" category, which you said you do not want to get into.  Your wife won't burnout. Just stay hydrated (not too much and not too little) and keep your body temperature normal (not too hot not too cold).  Also, it won't hurt to weigh the MDMA capsule you've got to be sure that it is 150 mg.  You can follow my suggested advice, or you can calculate the mg/kg dosages that seem appropriate to you. Again, I don't know how much you weigh, but you guys could be on an even playing field if you both take the same mg/kg (1.5-1.75 mg/kg). For a better roll, get closer to 1.75 mg/kg. I heard that 1.5 mg/kg is not very strong at all and might leave you feeling underwhelmed.  Other than that, it sounds like you guys will be rolling in public with each other? If you are rolling at home, get a music playlist ready, some lotion, light shows, and soft blankets and things to play with. Tie glow sticks to a ceiling fan. Enjoy each other. :)"
MDMA,3bx9ib,Celeste_Cat,2,Thu Jul 2 23:19:23 2015 UTC,"Hi - Just wanted to give you some comparison metrics.  I am 5 feet tall, about 90 lbs, and in excellent health.  My SO and I get high quality DNM sourced and tested MDMA, weigh and cap it ourselves.  I've experimented with a lot of doses over the years, and usually drop btwn 125 and 135 mg.  On times when I dose lower than 125, it's usually an underwhelming experience.  If it was me, I would take half the tesla.  Hope this helps.  Good luck and have a happy 4th!"
MDMA,3bx9ib,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:24:22 2015 UTC,"How hard is the roll, just out of curiosity?"
MDMA,3bx9ib,Celeste_Cat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:26:20 2015 UTC,"It's perfect for me.  The come up is very smooth, and gives me a really nice roll - not too overwhelming - with the right mix of euphoria and energy.  I tried 150mg a couple of times, and definitely felt like it was way too much - had really bad nausea, a hard come up and didn't remember a thing from the entire night."
MDMA,3bx9ib,BobbleheadDoll,3,Thu Jul 2 23:36:30 2015 UTC,Cool! Good to know!
MDMA,3bx9ib,Bluesunglasse,2,Fri Jul 3 00:15:10 2015 UTC,"I made an account just for you so that I could help you, so please listen closely.  In my experience with first timers, nearly 2 years ago, we had some red supermans, containing roughly 220-240MG, similar to your teslas, and I had a male friend who weighed 130~, who was already a bit boisterous to begin with keep in mind.  He took half the tab and the second he started coming up he was very loud and crazy talkative, he denies being overwhelmed, but I disagree.  This could be bad depending on how your girlfriend is normally.  I would really recommend her taking a quarter to start off with.  One golden rule I have found from searching the web and personal experience, is that you can always take more, but never take less.  For Supplementation, www.rollsafe.org/ is my go to and has never let me down, since you will be in the public I don't see it that possible to just pop pills, you will already not have that bad of effects after your first time in such a well-spaced timeframe.  Although, I do recommend you get that NA-R-ALA and just take it before you leave the car, as well as soon as you can while rolling as a preventative measure.  Also, DO NOT take 5HTP the night OF because it can actually induce Serotonin Syndrome.  Just take it the night after, for 3-7days after.  I do not have much information about etizolam, but I often take Melatonin the night of.  Melatonin is a very strong antioxidant and sleep-aid.  You are recommended to take lower dosages, but I take 10mg for it's antioxidant properties and sleep.    The powder idea sounds like a good plan, but wrap it in toilet paper and parachute it.  Depending on your weight I would probably still take just a half, unless you weigh 200+, then take a half and an 1/8th of the pill.  I have no idea if this is just some 4th of July get together or a full-fledged rave, if it is a rave you can both take up to an 1/8th more and still be fine, she may have a hard come up though, which can be alleviated if you wait until about 30minutes after she doses to help her get through it, and you also won't be coming up at the same time.    Lastly, the amount of food you eat and how long you last ate before dosing are critical.  I recommend eating a healthy breakfast rich in carbs, followed by a lunch and then a medium dinner atleast 4 hours before the dose."

MDMA,3bwm8k,Aspext,3,Thu Jul 2 19:24:12 2015 UTC,"I tried to do this a while ago and paid the price, horrible comedown. Rolling for that long isn't really a good idea as you only have a certain amount of seratonin and each redose increased toxicity. Why not take mdma along with something else such as 2cb?  Edit: I misread, if ur only looking to 5 hours 180/80 then some caffeine (80-120 mg) should do the job nicely"
MDMA,3bwm8k,Plato2012,3,Thu Jul 2 19:59:42 2015 UTC,"The way I would do it taking pressed pills (75kg, 1.80m, light to normal toleration I guess) :  I would start with some beers, start rolling at 4 (120 mg) so it hits about 5. Have a decent redose (75 mg) at 7:30, redose at 9 (75 mg) and then cool down in the last (half) hour. Drink a couple of beers so you end up slightly intoxicated such that the transition to normal life is more easily  This is a perfect festival experience for me  Edit: spelling"
MDMA,3bwm8k,Golden_D,2,Thu Jul 2 21:03:00 2015 UTC,"That sounds pretty fair. If you are going to redose, you might extend your roll to about 5-6 hours. You could redose again to extend your roll, but you might not really get that much out of it, and the negative symptoms of the comedown will likely be amplified. Nevertheless, it could extend your roll; just depends on whether you think it is worth it. If anything, you could use that 40mg to up your inital dose or redose by a bit (depending on your experience and how much you weigh).  What exactly will you be doing at 12? Will you be driving back home or walking back home? It might be good to get a DD or a taxi just to be safe. If you plan to party afterward, you could drop your first dose a little bit later."

Think of your right vs left hand, both of them are hands, but they are mirror images of each other and non-superimposable.  The German Wikipedia link shows the ""Right"" hand MDMA on top and the ""Left"" hand MDMA below.  The English Wikipedia is the representation used that says ""this molecule can be 'Right' or 'Left' handed.""  If you truly want to go through with this (and I say it's a pretty bad idea), use the picture from the English Wikipedia."

MDMA,3buvri,EasterGirl,3,Thu Jul 2 15:20:56 2015 UTC,"Those molecules are all correct, it's just a chemistry concept call isomers  It's like viewing something from a different perspective..or imagine you're looking at your hands, both hands are the same, but you can lay them ontop of each other and they don't match..or like looking something in the mirror  The error on then tattoo you linked was that if you look at the ring (benzene ring) on the left, there are two extra lines on the inside of the ring that make a double line, this represents a double bond between the two carbon atoms, however one of these lines is missing. Just by looking at it, if seems like a small mistake, however in reality that chemical is extremely unstable and incredibly reactive due to the spare electrons from not forming the double bond (the missing line)..Infact that probably doesn't even exist..google benzene ring and you can see it for yourself.  There is also a slight difference in the way the German wiki has chosen to display the molecule. On the right side there are CH4's (methane group) on the German one, however the European one does not write CH4, however the European one it's implied that the end of the line (carbon) contains 4 hydrogen atoms. It's just the German one physically writes the methane group. There are many different ways of drawing molecules in chemistry, each looks different but they all ultimately represent the same molecule, that's why you'll find many different representations  As for your tattoo...are you young? If you're still young, you may want to consider if future you will enjoy the tattoo as much as current you does, it's probably just a phase and we all go through them..you'll get older, stop going out to raves begin earning responsibilities etc, that's just life. However if you're completely sure, then yes the molecule is fine..tattoo seems a bit large tho, like waaay large..but that's just my opinion"

Taking tums or a teaspoon of baking soda in water beforehand should eliminate this problem.  That said, three hours is quite a long time. The MDMA could just be really bad quality, or if it was in a pill - pressed really firmly (like a red UPS).  Don't rule out tolerance either, for me personally, waiting 6-8 weeks means the roll won't be as intense as the last time.  Hope that helps a bit man :)"

MDMA,3bt5fc,dechoosenwun,6,Wed Jul 1 22:57:11 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the efforts here but: Grapefruit juice supplementing is not well supported by the scientific literature. It's what wikipedia calls ""original research"" and bans.  Grapefruit juice can inhibit the enzyme CYP3A4.  However, inhibiting CYP3A and a bunch of other enzymes was not found to protect against MDMA neurotoxicity in rats in the only study I know of. Similarly, selective CY3A inhibition did not protect against MDMA-induced cell death in rat livers.    The idea that MDMA neurotoxicity is the result of a toxic metabolite is a published theory from one group, but it is not proven and there are other competing theories.  I don't personally think MDA is relevant to the psychoactivity or toxicity of MDMA.  MDA is a very minor metabolite of MDMA, only about 4% of what we find in urine (or 1.6% of the total dose - it's not all recovered) is MDA, and it forms slowly, peaking around 7 hrs in the blood.  The maximum level in the blood is about 14 ng/mL after 1.6 mg/kg MDMA, much less than MDMA (about 292 ng/ml) or HMMA (about 174 ng/ml).  Even if you somehow stopped all MDA formation, I doubt it would affect your roll.  (These numbers btw come from this paper and this paper.)"
MDMA,3bt5fc,MBaggott,3,Fri Jul 3 00:17:54 2015 UTC,"Again, I appreciate the efforts here, but the section on Magnesium seems confused.   There is no scientific support I know of for linking excitotoxicity and bruxism (teeth grinding).  Magnesium has long been used to decrease bruxism from many causes, including ones where excitotoxicity is not suspected. And having bruxism does not mean you're having brain damage.   There is some evidence from rat studies for the possibility of excitotoxicity after MDMA, but magnesium has not yet been shown to help with this, to my knowledge.   The harm reduction statement I would make is that MDMA-induced bruxism often damages teeth and that magnesium may reduce this. I think it's ok to mention unproven theorizing that it might help with some types of neurotoxicity, but we should be clear that's speculation."
MDMA,3bt5fc,MBaggott,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:50:04 2015 UTC,"i, as an biochemistry student , am not sure about the whole 5-htp thing..  ive heard of peolple getting high just off of 5-htp.. so.. it does not just ""refill"" you.   to my knowledge 5-htp does not ""naturally refill"" your seretonin amount, its just like taking more mdma, wich corresponds to my experiences.  im really not sure about this. most people here seeme to have different experiences, but as i see it, its not like you can just  ""replenish"" your amount of seretonin.   just my piece of cake, i love mdma but i think time is the most relevant variable. :s  edit: all the othter supplements are great imho, in my experience magnesium (in any form) and anti-oxidants are great. but as everyone else seems to agree with, every roll is different :)  plus + vitamins such as E and C cant be bad , imho its just like good nutrition befofre you roll :)  i think thats what its all about!(just my piece of cake, from experience!!!)"
MDMA,3bt5fc,players8,5,Thu Jul 2 00:20:35 2015 UTC,"The logic behind 5-htp is that the tyrptophan hydroxylase enzyme which is a step on the path to serotonin is irreversibly inhibited for a week or two, 5-HTP bypasses this step and allows amino acid decarboxylase to have a pool of 5-HTP from which to convert into serotonin as normal.  The only time ive heard of people getting high on 5-HTP is shortly after a roll has ended. With still high levels of MDMA it may be that the vestibules are depleted and supplementing with 5-HTP would then bypass the already rate-limited, inhibited Tryptophan hydrolase to give the user a 'second wind' of serotonin and thus a new roll."
MDMA,3bt5fc,glatiramer_acetate,0,Thu Jul 2 00:39:38 2015 UTC,"It's all cool and well but I don't supplement with magnesium anymore. I've always stupidly loved the way my teeth chatter during a roll and magnesium takes that away from me. The stronger the chatter the stronger it feels I'm rolling, haha.  Also I would rather avoid drinking anything acidic before dropping because that diminishes the amount of MDMA absorbed as amphetamines need basic surroundings for maximum absorption. Sure taking antiacids would bacify(?) your stomach contents but I'd rather just not risk it and leave grapefruit juice out and just take the antacids 30mins before dropping."
MDMA,3bt5fc,EasterGirl,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:14:21 2015 UTC,I know grapefruit juice and OJ Are quite acidic....I was under the impression that to get your vitamin C and avoid stomach acidity emergenc-c would be recommended.

I can barely make out the front of the pill because of the picture quality but they look very familiar.   My best friend and her boyfriend took those 2 weekends ago and she said they were pretty good. White Speakers pill report says they are about 200-220mg but she said they are probably a solid 200mg. She also claims that the roll either come in waves or with a noticeable come up.   Remember to test your pills before taking them and if they are good then enjoy yourself! I always recommend taking 1/2's or 1/4's for pills stronger than 200mg but that's just me.   Have fun, be safe and roll on! 😏💊"

MDMA,3brp99,SSASERTPO,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:06:05 2015 UTC,"Are you stressed out? When you're rolling you need to go in with virtually no worries so your emotions aren't amplified. Stress especially will put strain on your chest.   Obviously if you're having these issues, take a lower dosage. Your goal with mdma is to have a good time with as small a quantity as possible. If stress is in fact the factor, don't roll unless you're relaxed. Especially paranoia. If you feel uncomfortable and worried about what might happen, don't be stupid.  Dont take the drug in the first place.   Heart problems are definitely something not to mix with mdma. I personally don't know of any other health related concerns but thats cus I haven't looked into that aspect of mdma use. Try using google."

MDMA,3brp99,edgeofpain,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:11:33 2015 UTC,"You honestly seem like you will be fine. No one ever knows whether something wrong will happen to their heart and yes mdma can make that occurrence more likely to happen, but you seem to be fine. You have done it before and were fine. If you don't have any major issues with your heart and don't take anti-depressant medicine then you should be fine to roll. I think 140 mg is a good dose for someone who is beginning/paranoid. Just relax. I know some people smoke on the come up to avoid any nerves."
MDMA,3brp99,ToadForce,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:12:02 2015 UTC,Drink a good amount of water and have a meal a couple hours before dosing. mdma is a poor choice if you are on ssr medication. Just relax. Try and have a few fun activities planned.

Otherwise, what do you care.  Search for ""beta blockers and mdma"". I was curious about them, if they have any benefit to control the heartrate...roll-wise... but the jury is still out. Some say yes, some say no.  If you're just 22 and not a couch potato, and not popping 1 g per night, then water, vitamin C, and moderation are all your friends. Thats my humble opinion. :)"

MDMA isn't a very dangerous drug if you are cautious about it. Test the drugs to make sure you aren't getting something dangerous. Drink plenty of water but not too much. If you are dancing take frequent breaks to cool down. A really good website that has a lot of information is DanceSafe. It will instruct you how to have a safe roll and give you helpful information. I sometimes get random chest pains but I've never had a heart attack or a bad time on MDMA. If you are really worried then you should definitely have your heart checked before doing MDMA. It may be expensive but if its a life or death situation its worth it. However, benign chest pain is pretty common and not always indicative of a heart problem."

I've never rolled alone before but staying home doesn't sound that fun. When I roll I like to dance a lot so I do it at parties, festivals, or raves. The hooker idea doesn't sound like too bad of an idea to me but I'm pretty liberal and you would have to probably make sure she was ok with what you are doing. Its a hookers job to be discrete so that might not be such a bad thing. I would highly recommend you find a party of some sort or a festival or somewhere to dance.

Basically like a ""rent a chat companion"", but even this is a gamble. Since we're discussing openly I don't think I could afford her for the whole night, and 1 or 2 hours will go by quickly.   What about internet chat rooms? Will text chat really facilitate social needs? I think it would feel fairly pale in comparison to being around other people who are rolling.   Thing is, I want to roll and will, but I know that on every prior occasion I've had amazing times being with someone else.   Like one time my friend and I rolled for 2 days, we spent the entire time talking, was frigging amazing. Deepest conversation I've ever had.   On yet another occasion I was rolling with a friend, who had to leave, so I knocked on my flat mates door, her and I spent about 5 hours chatting even though she was completely sober. Was amazing."

It was his first time rolling. He didn't know how much he took. He hadn't tested it. And he didn't know it could make you dehydrated. We schooled him up real quick but damn that was shocking. To have no idea what you're putting in your body is crazy.
MDMA,3bohwv,jtet93,4,Wed Jul 1 05:33:43 2015 UTC,"Well, it is not crazy. Honestly, I understand it. When I used to abuse ecstasy, I never tested or weighed anything. I just took it, and my only goal was to increase the intensity of my roll and to make it last as long as possible. Also, people do drugs spontaneously for all sorts of reasons.   It is our job as experienced and educated users to educate people about their drug use. It is our job to inspire people to want to learn about what they are putting in their bodies and how they can reduce harm. I wish other people were there to educate me when I was ignoring my health."

But I was at least with a friend who knew what was up and she told me what to do, and I knew how much I had and stuff.

MDMA,3bohwv,ThePsychonaut420,2,Wed Jul 1 05:47:39 2015 UTC,"This is the essential thing to follow. Don't be dumb, I've been dosing on and off for 14 years. I only saw pressed pills for the first 7-8 years, there wasn't much testing back then, but we did have a lot of good mdma content for a while. They were also well paired to other drugs like K, mda, speed, 2Cxs, stuff we knew about at least all whipped up together for a 10 hour all night rave. After learning how much powder/crystal crap is out there now I've gotten really vigilant with teaching people more, and when I have the 99% pure and sample it out it blows people away, they don't even thinks its MDMA that's how polluted this drug is in the markets."
MDMA,3bohwv,captain_shit,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:19:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I used to roll, I never had access to crystal. That was like the holy grail at the time. I would love to get 99% pure MDMA. When you had that, was it lab tested for 99% pure?"

I would drink some Gatorade or other sports drinks with electrolytes in them before you get to the event and drink a lot of water throughout the event. if there are vendors with ice kindly ask them for some and if they say no kindly ask them if you can purchase some. if all fails try with different vendors I'm sure there will be some nice enough to give you or at least sell you some! my only other bit of advice is bring a fan! this is something I do for every event. it's really cheap and it'll save you and other will really appreciate it too. just spray some water on your face or body and fan the shit out of it. good luck, have fun, and more importantly stay safe :)"

MDMA,3bpzv8,deezyyyy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:26:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that sucks. He can try smoking weed to see if it will help him come up? Also, although I do not typically recommend this, he can try taking another larger dose, something closer to what he should have taken.   EDIT: Note, that my suggestion could increase neurotoxicity. However, if he does decide to do this, he should take his dose and crush it into a very fine powder. Then he should either plug it or parachute it."
MDMA,3bpzv8,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:03:25 2015 UTC,"Neurotoxicity is relative to the amount of serotonin released.  If he's not rolling, there's not a lot of serotonin released.  So the neurotoxicity needs to be increased for him to roll at all, 120mg can be way more neurotoxic to someone smaller than to someone larger."
MDMA,3bpzv8,snapchats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:01:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is true, but there are other factors related to neurotoxicity, such that you might have neurotoxic effects without even rolling."
MDMA,3bpzv8,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:32:01 2015 UTC,"This is true, in the case of say, someone who takes MDMA while also taking an SSRI. They can still cause downregulation and neurotoxicity. But an SSRI can cause downregulation on its own.  Neurotoxicity is brain damage. Plain and simple. If someone doesn't roll because they take a dose too low to really overstimulate the receptors, the neurotoxicity caused would be less than someone who is rolling.   I'm not saying taking 120mg and not rolling doesn't cause any downregulation, or neurotoxicity. And I'm not claiming that because he ""didn't roll,"" (he obviously did, just not as hard as he'd like) that he could roll tmro and be fine because he didn't stimulate the 5ht2a receptors.  What I am saying, is he can up his dose without worrying about neurotoxicity, next time he rolls, anymore than his GF who rolled at this dose would worry about if she kept this dose."

MDMA,3bpzv8,SoggyBiscuitBeats,2,Wed Jul 1 21:51:01 2015 UTC,"Take a break.  Neurotoxicity isn't something that can be measured very easily, but if you're not feeling well. Or you can tell something is up, with your memory, your sleep, your emotions, whatever.  Take an extra long break.  But honestly, you're probably ok."
MDMA,3bpzv8,snapchats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:06:25 2015 UTC,"Cheers for the advice My memory, sleep...and emotions are all pretty messed up tbh. Some of that can be accounted for by other things but obviously the high tolerance and relatively frequent doses are going to attribute somewhat.  It's been a month and a half, I'm dropping 0.5 next Friday as it's the biggest music event of the year for me...then I honestly think I'll give it a rest until new years eve or something."

MDMA,3bpzv8,decadurabolin365,2,Wed Jul 1 06:26:07 2015 UTC,"Are you asking how to prevent losing the magic, or to know how to take enough so that you get a good roll? If you're asking about preventing losing the magic, my best advice is to a) Learn your sweet spot of dosage and adhere to it b) Pre-load with at least Vitamin C and some grape seed and post-load with the same as well as some 5-htp and c) give yourself 1-2months break between each roll. Also it should be just a given but try and have a healthy lifestyle, your body is so much more durable when you are keeping it healthy on a daily basis."

MDMA,3bpzv8,decadurabolin365,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:13:34 2015 UTC,"For c, you can roll 2-3 times in one weekend, just be aware that by the third day you'll probably have 0 serotonin left and won't feel much if if at all unless you take a pressed pill, and even then it'll probably be only some speediness. If I can suggest doing something like acid, shrooms etc on at least 1 day so you don't waste MDMA on your third day."
MDMA,3bpzv8,Toofat2camp,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:19:15 2015 UTC,You just have to take a relatively high dose to start. Maybe somewhere between 1.5 and 2 mg/kg.

MDMA,3bpzv8,decadurabolin365,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:15:33 2015 UTC,"Does .4 mean a pill or does it mean .4 g of MDMA? If it's a pill, then you don't know how much MDMA is in it."

MDMA,3bpzv8,decadurabolin365,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:18:02 2015 UTC,Okay. You cannot calculate mg/kg because that dose refers to the amount of MDMA per kg of body weight. You do not know how much MDMA you have in a pill unless it is lab tested.

Rolling together is brilliant, you'll love it. It doesn't kill you faster than drinking this way. When you show confidence and she has the feeling not to worry about anything, you're already half way to a great roll. Enjoy!  Edit: make sure your pauses between rolls are 6-8 weeks though.

MDMA,3boqmq,BobbleheadDoll,3,Tue Jun 30 22:32:45 2015 UTC,"It seems as if there is little to no relationship between weight and MDMA dosage. It's a highly controversial topic and everyone has their own opinion, but for the most part, weight plays a very little factor. What plays more of a factor is stomach content, other medications, etc.   MDMA works in the brain and on your serotonin receptors, which are pretty much the same for everyone despite weight."
MDMA,3boqmq,legaladvicethrow42,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:41:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think there are lots of other factors. But the amount of MDMA that enters your blood stream and the amount that is able to move freely through your bloodstream may depend, indirectly on weight. I mean, I can imagine that some MDMA might not reach the brain if fatty tissue absorbs it. I don't really know if that is true, but it is definitely something I can imagine."
MDMA,3boqmq,legaladvicethrow42,2,Wed Jul 1 05:46:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I'm not saying it plays no factor, but I think that it plays such a little factor that unless you're on the very end of either side of the spectrum, you shouldn't notice a difference."
MDMA,3boqmq,legaladvicethrow42,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:52:07 2015 UTC,"Okay. I think that is an interesting hypothesis. I would definitely love to see other people's responses to see which hypothesis is supported. :)  What do you consider to be on either side of the spectrum?   You just made me think, though, that both height and weight might matter (it might not). If so, then we could actually do mg per BMI."
MDMA,3boqmq,legaladvicethrow42,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:54:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm just speaking on experience with both myself and my friends. I haven't really noticed any of my friends that are lower/higher in weight to be hit less/more. We all seem to be pretty consistent with doses, so I'm not quite sure. There's not too much research out there. I think it also depends on what form the MDMA is in. At least for me, pressed pills are way more hard hitting than powder/crystal."
MDMA,3boqmq,legaladvicethrow42,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:58:10 2015 UTC,Okay. Do each of you take the same dose?  I think the difference in form can be explained by difference in amount of MDMA taken.
MDMA,3boqmq,snapchats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:01:04 2015 UTC,"Well this kind of goes into a whole other topic, which I have no problem discussing. Just from what I've noticed, taking half of a popular 200 mg dutch pressed pill affects me a lot more than taking a capsule of 100 mg of MDMA. I think it also depends on how many times one has rolled.   I've taken MDMA probably around 25 times now. So for me, just regular moon rocks are somewhat of a bore and disappointment.   As far as answering your question, we usually take the same dose, but it really depends. I have a friend who is female and probably weighs 20 pounds less than me that will take 200 mg in one dose, where as I rarely will take more than ~110 mg in a single dose."
MDMA,3boqmq,snapchats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:04:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so different amounts.  That is really interesting. Seems like everyone has their own comfortable dose. That is what I am interested in learning about. :)"
MDMA,3boqmq,snapchats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:06:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think for most people an ideal dose is somewhere between 100 and 150 mg. While there are people who like more, I don't really like to be rolling that hard at the types of environments I roll in."
MDMA,3boqmq,snapchats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:08:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like to roll hard as balls. I never measured my dosages before, though, so I don't know how much I used to take.

I wouldn't really recommend rolling anything closer than a week apart, and even then you should really be waiting 2-4 weeks. I'd say a month is probably ideal, try for 2 or 3 if you really want to preserve the MDMA experience.   Basically, you can do it, but you're probably going to feel like shit after.

MDMA,3bote5,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:33:56 2015 UTC,My main worry right know is that my depression (sounds really similar to dysthymia) is caused by my one trip and is therefore irreversible. What do you think about that? I realize it could have happened to me but I do hope it has not. Im thinking I should wait it out since I can not possibly imagine a doctor could do anything for me righ now without giving me happy pills
MDMA,3bote5,thgiftac_,2,Tue Jun 30 23:44:08 2015 UTC,"Is your depression or dysthymia affect your ability to function in daily life, including work and personal responsibilities? If so, then you can work with a psychologist to help overcome your depression.  Also, did you have depression or depression-like symptoms prior to using MDMA?  I think the thought that one MDMA trip caused irreversible depression is irrational. Although it is possible that one MDMA trip can cause depressive-like symptoms, these symptoms usually do not last for more than one week. And if they do, then this may hint and other underlying issues. I think MDMA likely makes any existing depression worse. So, if there is existing depression, using drugs to treat that depression would make that depression worse.  Also, depression is not irreversible. There are treatments for depression, some involve medicine some do not. To say that it is irreversible means you think that depression is permanent. But look in your daily life--the amount depression you feel fluctuates from day to day. This means that on some days, your depression is better than other days. This means that depression or depression-like symptoms can change. Therefore, depression is not irreversible."
MDMA,3bote5,hrgilbert,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:32:39 2015 UTC,"- I'm no expert on mdma or the brain  I wouldn't say that the depression could be ""caused"" by the pill the same way you feel depressed on a comedown, as that is due to a lack of seretonin receptors left in the brain. By this point they should all have regenerated (unless you destroyed some of them but afaik it would need to be a really high dose to do that - much more than .35g anyway). So chemically your brain should be fully recovered, though it's obviously not that simple.  However it could be ""caused"" by the experience you had during or after the trip which means it's a mental thing in the same way 'normal' depression is, so I would say it should be reversible (though not easy as with all forms of depression)."

Unless you are sending your sample off to undergo tests using GMS then you have no idea what is in it. Sure, reagent tests are helpful. But they will only tell you so much and what the substance is not. The more different tests you do, the more drugs you can eliminate."
MDMA,3bmzkq,Leonard_DaVinci,2,Tue Jun 30 19:36:02 2015 UTC,"I said  it made it easier man, i didnt say it makes it impossible to misidentify. if you have crystal and you are experienced with high quality mdma its going to be alot easier to tell if you buying good shit than it would be if you where buying a pill, which as far as i know there arent really anyways besides test kits to judge the quality."
MDMA,3bmzkq,adderyn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:05:13 2015 UTC,"Crystal MDMA can come in a variety of shades so how you can differentiate between one form of crystal and another through sight alone is beyond me. It's easier to find out whch pills have good reputations, reports etc as it's a lot harder, but not impossible, granted, to copy and press a pill to look like one with a good reputation. A pill press is a lot harder to get hold of than some crystaline substance that could pass as MDMA."

Whereas powder/crystal has a higher chance to be random crap."
MDMA,3bmzkq,RedEyedJedii,2,Tue Jun 30 20:46:42 2015 UTC,"Moon rocks all the way! I never really tried an E pill though, which are apparently a lot better due to a mixture of other drugs (or worse for the same reason).

(although this is not advised as your body will need it for the nutrients and energy) it is also said that taking tums and other supplements  before your roll will prolong and intensify it. also, if you're taking pressed pills and crush it into powder before taking it it'll hit you harder, faster, and for a slightly shorter period of time."

MDMA,3bnnhd,steezyneezy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:57:15 2015 UTC,Melatonin won't fuck with your brain.  Part of the reason you can't sleep is serotonin depletion also inhibits the creation of natural melatonin in the brain (the hormone that controls your biological clock).  So supplementing a decent dose of melatonin (10mg or so) will help your body understand you're trying to sleep.

MDMA,3blww4,larjew,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:28:08 2015 UTC,"Put it up your butt. It has higher bioavailability (more drug enters your bloodstream, so you get higher) due to there being loads of blood vessels there, slightly faster come up (20-30 mins, very hard pressed pills can take longer) and comparable duration of action. There are also loads of nerve endings up there, so you may have some discomfort depending on the pill and how used you are to putting things in your butt. As a general rule, if it's painful to put up your nose it will be at least slightly painful to plug, but normally not that bad.  It can be easy to overdose using this method, and obviously you can't throw it up, so be careful how you dose, for your first attempt dose no more than 2/3rds of your standard dose (and ideally closer to 1/2) and wait to come up completely (1.5hrs+) before attempting any redose."

MDMA,3blww4,dopamingo,2,Tue Jun 30 17:03:51 2015 UTC,Definitely grind it up into a fine powder. It needs to be absorbed into the blood and it can't do that in pill form. Mix with a very minimal water solution and stick it up there for a few minutes.

MDMA,3bo1hx,ayyitsluke,5,Tue Jun 30 19:29:40 2015 UTC,"My advice:  1) don't be nervous 2) consider pre/post loading 3) assuming you've tested what you have with a testkit i would give 100-115mg a shot as your first dose 4) if you're still nervous, look at rollsafe.org for a fairly comprehensive guide on what to expect, etc. 5) if you care to know, dancesafe.org has a great presentation on mdma and the brain 6) hydrate, sip on some water/gatoraid throughout the roll, but don't drink too much (refer to rollsafe.org)  what kind of environment will you be in? dance party? huuuge rave? alone? small group of friends?"
MDMA,3bo1hx,rocketno40,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:03:57 2015 UTC,"All great advice. The starting dose you recommended was about 2 mg/kg, which might be a little high for him? He could feasibly go between 81 mg and 100 mg if it is his first time.  Also, OP, make sure you are not stuffed before you drop. Have a good sized meal about 4 hours before you drop--you don't want to be too full or too hungry."
MDMA,3bo1hx,BobbleheadDoll,2,Tue Jun 30 21:07:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go much under 100 at the risk of not feeling anything at all.  The problem with mdma is it operates more like a toilet.  You've got to push the handle just enough to make it flush.  Too little and nothing will happen (I realize this analogy is watered down, no pun intended, but it works).  I don't think for OP's case I would go over 110mg, but somewhere in the 90-100mg should be the goal.  I'm around OPs weight, and 110mg is my magic number.  +1 on the food thing...if you're too full it will take FOREVER.  Also, you've tons of serotonin receptors in your stomach, so having a lot of food in there when you're exciting your serotonin receptors may make you feel queazy.  A good healthy meal at least 4 hrs before is perfect."
MDMA,3bo1hx,rocketno40,2,Tue Jun 30 21:29:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, good to know. I am familiar with the idea that you should take a higher starting dose, otherwise you won't get a good roll. I like the suggestion for 90-100 mg. That seems more reasonable than 1.5 mg/kg."

MDMA,3bo15i,cokeadoodlesniff,2,Tue Jun 30 19:27:09 2015 UTC,The half-life of mdma is around 7hrs...meaning that it will almost be completely depleted after 4 of these...or 28 hrs.  General rule of thumb with urine though is that it becomes detectible within 2 hrs of use and becomes undetectable after 3 days.  Dose isn't generally considered as a factor in this because the body so rapidly metabolizes it.
MDMA,3bo15i,rocketno40,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:07:53 2015 UTC,"~3days till you will be clean. MDMA is usually not tested for directly, but can give a false positive for amphetamines."

MDMA,3bm6ff,Lysergine,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:54:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much (and it differs from person to person is my personal experience) If the dose 4FA isn't too big, the euphoric effect is the biggest without the 'speedy' part.. Dropping X after a small dose of 4F will increase/extend the euphoric feeling  Pure amphetamine (which is indeed very similar but not the same as 4F) will overrule more if you combine with X, killing the euphoria of X  Bad English and TLDR; There are better combos, still 4FA + X can be a good combo for some, better than speed/amph + X (not for your brain ofc)  Festival i'm going is Wish Outdoor (@ Beek & Donk; NL)"

MDMA,3blex9,Keithious,9,Tue Jun 30 04:15:03 2015 UTC,"Story Time! One time my partner had to pick up a g for some people who had never rolled before for a music festival. We love it when people who are normally against substances decide to roll for their first time. We normally do darknet, but we had ran out because of high demand. Another one of our friends got a pickup from a dealer who my partner taught how to use darknet. The dealer gave it to our friend to sell at the festival. We have picked up from this dealer before and tested it, so he assumed it was good. The friend shows up with the product. Reluctant, my partner decides to test it. It shows up as methylone. Furious, my partner demands the friend asks the dealer why its shit. The dealer says ""I gave you that to sell at a music festival where nobody has any test kits"". Moral of the story; Dealers are motherfucking scumbags ,always test your shit even if they have had md before. Humans are easily corrupted by greed and dealers do not care about people's personal health. Eventhough the dealer orders half o's at a time and can get the MD hella cheap he chooses to be fucking greedy and order Chinese shit. I'm sorry this is a rant post, just whenever people take advantage of others its just completely unacceptable in my eyes. TL:DR ; ALWAYS TEST YOUR SHIT, EVEN IF ITS FROM A TRUSTED DEALER. STAY SAFE HOMIES!"
MDMA,3blex9,Moopeeeee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:06:44 2015 UTC,Yes. Dealers hold a sacred position of trust that must not be messed with.
MDMA,3blex9,Moopeeeee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:33:29 2015 UTC,"Most of my dealers have real MD. One of my business partner and I's most trusted dealer recently got into a very loving relationship with his boyfriend and therefore he stopped selling. He was one of the best and most reliable, he always had real md and L, my partner and I understood that now that he was in a serious relationship that he stopped selling and we respect that. But yeah most dealers are alright, if you use darknet and they specialize in MD, I usually ask them if they would like to trade blotters for caps or some good product I get online for their product. This shows dealers that you are not some punk that is looking to buy, but you have good product as well and it can strengthen your relationship with them."
MDMA,3blex9,BrinxJob,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:53:15 2015 UTC,"The dealer says ""I gave you that to sell at a music festival where nobody has any test kits"".   Someone's never been to a festival."
MDMA,3blex9,Moopeeeee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:02:12 2015 UTC,"It's wasn't an all electronic music festival, and the demographic was people (15- 25) who just drink alot, many of which have not experimented with substances besides weed. They do not know what is fake and what is real. The (douchebag) dealer mostly goes to festivals for the sole sake of selling, he does not really go for the music."
MDMA,3blex9,BrinxJob,2,Thu Jul 2 12:58:51 2015 UTC,"I don't even like electronic music, I'm a jam head. But every jam fest I've been to there's been tons of people either selling testers or testing their shit, so my apologies. I'd expect less people testing at an electronic show than anything tbh.  No denying the guy's a scumbag though, regardless."
MDMA,3blex9,Moopeeeee,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:01:48 2015 UTC,"No need to be sorry, my bad if the my last comment came off aggressive. It's difficult to explain the situation over comments on Reddit haha. But from my experience down in the south, most people are very very very uneducated when it comes to mdma usage. They do not space their rolls out at all. I've had multiple clients buy ""Molly"" ask me to see if its real and 99% of the time it is methylone or some other horrendous chemical. One time a girl literally bought meth. I didn't need to test it to see that it was fake. It was clear and was very shardy looking (my partner Marquis tested it and it turned the most violent shade if red). The girl was a friend so we traded her real md for abit extra for her shit crystal. My friend and I didn't know what to do with it so we dumped the whole lot in a test tube and dumped a bunch of Marquis on it for shits and giggles. And yeah my friend literally taught the dealer how to darknet and he still sells fake ass shit, there is a reason that he was too stupid to operate darknet and he just should have not even shown him anything."
MDMA,3blex9,peonyourface,5,Thu Jul 2 13:10:47 2015 UTC,I like buying in bulk for this reason.. but as I'm sure most people will say here... test kit.. ALWAYS! your health is worth the $20-$50! stay safe and good luck :)

When I found it in my mailbox after work, it was the best non drug high ever!!!! Lol. Just order enough to last you for a bit so you're not constantly ordering. But let me warn you, ordering from the DNMs can be addicting.  I find myself wanting to order something everytime I peek at the listings. Lol"

NEVER go two days in a row doing this kinda stuff. It's fun as fuck but it is a chemical that basically fucks with you're brain to work. If you know that then you should know not to keep fucking with your brain for a good time. The real fun of drugs is like having nieces and nephews, they're fun to see on the weekends but it's nice to have them go home till your ready to see them again. And sometimes they live in other states so you only see them a few times a year, make it count, but don't over-do it."

MDMA,3bkjio,BobbleheadDoll,15,Tue Jun 30 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"Most people take a maximum of about 250 mg per roll, and might redose with about 100 mg. You rolled on over 1 g two nights in a row.  Honestly, I have no idea what will happen to you, but if you feel like you are in danger, then I suggest going to the ER.   Do you have any symptoms of Serotonin Syndrome? Scroll down the page to the list of symptoms. If you have any of them, I suggest going to see the doctor."
MDMA,3bkjio,snapchats,11,Mon Jun 29 23:55:18 2015 UTC,On my way to ER now. Have almost half of those symptoms. Thanks for the reply. Will get back to you if I'm still alive.

MDMA,3bkjio,BobbleheadDoll,3,Tue Jun 30 23:45:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, good to know. I cannot imagine taking 5 grams of MDMA. And sorry if I scared you into going to the doctor. I am not a doctor myself, but having those symptoms after a lot of MDMA worried me. I am glad you are okay!  Did the doctor give you anything?"
MDMA,3bkjio,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:33:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess so. I took all the necessary supplements before, during and after. And I'm still taking a few. He recommended just eat lots and exercise, which I do anyway."

MDMA,3bkjio,pillsforfun,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:21:03 2015 UTC,"OP, check out the gradations of severity of symptoms so you can see how they might apply to you:   Mild symptoms may consist of increased heart rate, shivering, sweating, dilated pupils, myoclonus (intermittent jerking or twitching), as well as overresponsive reflexes.[1] However, many of these symptoms may be side effects of the drug or drug interaction causing excessive levels of serotonin; not an effect of elevated serotonin itself. Tremor is a common side effect of MDMA's action at dopamine, whereas hyperreflexia is symptomatic of exposure to 5-HT agonists. Moderate intoxication includes additional abnormalities such as hyperactive bowel sounds, high blood pressure and hyperthermia; a temperature as high as 40 °C (104 °F). The overactive reflexes and clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. Mental changes include hypervigilance or insomnia and agitation.[1] Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to shock. Temperature may rise to above 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) in life-threatening cases. Other abnormalities include metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; these effects usually arising as a consequence of hyperthermia"
MDMA,3bkjio,BobbleheadDoll,6,Tue Jun 30 00:01:20 2015 UTC,Serotonin syndrome doesn't happen 40 hours after last dose. He would have noticed while rolling and required medical attention.

MDMA,3blllc,lucyinmyeyes,2,Tue Jun 30 09:47:49 2015 UTC,I would give her about 1/3 of a pill. I feel like 1/4 might be too little for her to feel the effects strongly and 1/2 might be overwhelming and she might get floored. whatever you choose to do I hope you guys have a fun and safe roll! :)
MDMA,3blllc,peonyourface,0,Tue Jun 30 05:47:58 2015 UTC,"I was going to recommend the same. 1/2 is still a strong/heavy dose in my experience with those.  Edit: maybe I should have specified, strong/heavy for a small person who has zero experience with MDxx"

MDMA,3blllc,Astrocat15,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:36:47 2015 UTC,"Start w/ somewhere from a quarter to a third first, just take more if she doesn't feel it still in ~1.5 hours.  My friend is about 190lbs and got FLOORED from 1/2 an orange tesla, so honestly I think 1/2 is a gamble since she's so small.  It's safer/better to just work your way up to that if shes not feeling it. If you ruin their first roll, they're not going to want to ever do it again.  So be smart."

If I did it again I would do 90mg. Cheers!"
MDMA,3blllc,kanad3,-2,Tue Jun 30 17:55:14 2015 UTC,"Lol at all the people giving these extremely small amounts. Girl here, whom has only rolled with girls - not one of my girl friends have found 100mg to be sufficient, more like 130-160mg."

Walked up to the security at the gate feeling like a cocky bastard. Nice friendly female guard. Had a good feel about and then put her fingers into my top pocket. Found the single pill. Oooh shit. She just went ""naughty naughty. No taking this shit past me"" and chucked it in a big bin they had for all drugs etc. Then she waved me through and that was that.   Soon as I got in and met my mate I explained the situation and gave him one of my two pills (origin yellow UPS! Lovely). No drama whatsoever."

I get some people tape to balls etc but I've always found that to be a bit worrisome if you're sweating. I just wrap what I need as tight as possible in film and then just place said package in between the head of my penis and my foreskin. Just wrap the foreskin over and pull it tight at the top.

Luckily they were mostly tagging along to humor me and my other friend, and they were a couple so they just went and did their own thing and my friend and I stayed and enjoyed the show.

MDMA,3bk52a,Severance13,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:35:37 2015 UTC,Will definitly try magnesium glycinate. We only had Mg-oxyde
MDMA,3bk52a,kandikraze,4,Tue Jun 30 02:48:35 2015 UTC,Magnesium citrate absorbs better than magnesium oxide and is usually readily available at most big chain pharmacies. Only caveat to the citrate form is that that you may experience an increase of frequency of your bowel movements.
MDMA,3bk52a,rocketno40,2,Tue Jun 30 03:52:09 2015 UTC,This. Mg oxide is so poorly absorbed you have to take upwards of 500% more of it to get the same benefit at glycinate. Also mg oxide can act as a laxative which is also not much fun while rolling. I take ravesafer before rolling each time and have had good results as well

That being said, I read on a different forum that the US Department of Homeland Security boasted about their ability to train dogs to sniff out MDMA. From what I recall, they selected the top methamphetamine trained dogs and trained them further to smell MDMA. The result of the program? About 150 dogs in the entire US that are able to identify MDMA. The likely hood of encountering a MDMA sniffer is fairly unlikely, but due to influx of use and current atmosphere this may have changed.    Unfortunately the article has long been lost. If I could find it, I'll link it when I can."

MDMA,3bk0t8,BitNugget,2,Mon Jun 29 21:16:00 2015 UTC,"The idea that CYP3A4 inhibition is going to do anything to prevent neurotoxicity is beyond dumb. The thread in which it was posted needs to be pruned because it's overflowing with disinformation. The guy who posted it wasn't qualified to come to the conclusions he came to, which is troubling. Not going to go into detail, but the idea that n-demethylation is the only route that can produce toxic metabolites is just plain dumb. This is why not a single academic paper has ever suggested this correlation to exist.  Anyway, MDMA itself inhibits CYP2D and CYP3A quite significantly. This is a big deal because CYP3A4 doesn't de-methylate MDMA in a bubble, CYP2D enzymes catalyze this significantly. This is why MDMA has very low conversion to MDA normally, if it didn't act as an inhibitor of the very enzymes that metabolize it, conversion to MDA would probably be much higher.   Don't bother trying to do this shit. Very likely it would do more harm then good.

I am not sure why he did not roll on Friday, though, but there could be other factors. For example, there might be contraindications with the medicine he is taking, his initial starting dose may have been low (e.g., 100 mg + 100 mg (redose) + 100 mg (redose), he may have been pretty full, he might not be in good health, he might be under a lot of stress, and he may not have been comfortable in his rolling environment. Also, if he is taking other medicines or supplements that affect 5-HT systems, this could affect his roll, too. Finally, if the last time he tried to roll (before Friday) was relatively recent, this might have affected him, too. Also, if he is using other drugs, this might affect his roll."

MDMA,3bhp04,suche1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:09:40 2015 UTC,"Also, at this point you would need to invest in a semi-automatic capping machine. It takes me about 2hours to cap an 8th mol by hand. And that's only ~50 caps"

At noon, it's somewhat okay in that no outsider is going to notice, but your driving skills are still going to be impaired. I personally wouldn't do it, to be honest. It's not safe to drive, especially if you're also sleep-deprived.  In fact, nowadays I refuse to take control over my vehicle for the entire duration of the next day. Yeah, I probably won't get caught doing drugs even if I do end up in an accident, but I just don't feel ready and fit to be behind the wheel of something not necessarily, but potentially so deadly."

Finishing college and moving home felt like having everything that I depended on, the routine, just pulled out from under me. All the structure in daily life just instantly lost feels like finding yourself in limbo. The days coming up to the end of term felt like running towards a cliff edge. I love how mdma can release you from your own self restricting negativity and allow you to take life for what it is and be damn happy about it. Feeling down is a state of mind, not a state of life."
MDMA,3bfrnj,Laumartre,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:43:26 2015 UTC,"I get what you mean about being stuck in limbo, but it is just a state of mind. I realized isolation was the main cause of feeling so down. When I peaked, I realized the group I was with, whom I barely knew was all I needed to feel apart of EDC. I nearly cried , because Its something i realized to my core. Now I wont take life for granted. Also that third night I drank so much I blacked out, I woke up in the medical tent thinking I was gonna die or something ( jager and strong edible, go figure) and It made me realize how precious life is. Man some fucken weekend i had."

There's nothing like that moment when you feel totally assured about the people you're with and that you're in the right place. Its like having a safety net. Too much time is wasted on negative thoughts, especially while we're young. The less pressure we put on ourselves for immediate happiness the easier it will be for it to just come naturally. Good friendship is the goal and happiness is the reward"
MDMA,3beyot,2007Pseudonym,3,Sun Jun 28 16:48:43 2015 UTC,"Not in the UK but here's my advice: you seem to know what you are doing by (I assume) checking sites like pill report and testing the presses. If one of them seems dodgy, why not just load up on the ones you know are good? If they are different doses, or there is some other reason for your wanting both pills, I suggest buying 1 or 2, retesting them with your kits, waiting to see if anything new pops up online, or if you feel comfortable in doing so (and I'm sure many people may say this is terrible advice) just eating one and see what you think. Peace, love, and safe travels!"

I believe the more MDMA you take, the more your body metabolises it into MDA, or something along those lines, and MDA is what causes visual hallucinations. The pills may have contained MDA too.  You may have a rough comedown and be feeling a bit off for a few days, but as long as you don't make a habit of this kind of use, you'll be fine. Make sure you take a decent break, an consider researching post roll supplements if things get real bad"

Pharmacologically, MDA acts as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor. Possession of MDA is illegal in most countries.

MDMA,3bdo85,S0rb0,11,Sun Jun 28 06:24:40 2015 UTC,"It's similar to MDMA in that it makes tactile sensation really nice and it great for fostering love. It's a lot like LSD because of the visuals and the headspace it creates. It won't give you the energy of MDMA or the duration of LSD, but it's really fun and worth taking.   If you can, combine it with MDMA for an absurdly pleasurable experience, some of the most intense euphoria and love I've ever felt, throw in some LSD if you're fully insane and ready for a 14 hour full body orgasms (advanced maneuver, not for the inexperienced)"

Admittedly, with this dosage, when the 2cb hits it can be a bit confusing for a while, specially when trying to talk to people - I just tend to dance it off :P Also, I noticed doing a line of mdma after the 2cb is in force can make music sound even more incredible for a short while, not sure if that was just my imagination or not though"

MDMA,3bdo85,ErdeTyrene,2,Sun Jun 28 10:02:26 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion, but I think its subjectively closer to MDMA. 2C-B is clear-headed unlike LSD which can be confusing. 2C-B is also very empathetic and erotic like MDMA, while LSD is more analytical. I also feel as is both 2C-B and MDMA both have more a positive mood push than LSD.  I guess high doses of 2C-B do shift its character towards LSD though."

It's interesting at the start when you go from completely sober to a mild intoxication. It's also cool to cause you don't know how high you're going to get and it's awesome when you get higher and higher. I never feel nauseous either. The only time I felt any discomfort was when I took a fairly high dose and felt a bit light headed but it went away after about 5 minutes and I was fine. It wasn't even that bad anyway.

MDMA,3be4lj,captain_shit,2,Sun Jun 28 16:29:24 2015 UTC,"I adore the come up, I love laying on a couch as the feeling washes over me before we head out but my favourite thing ever is on the comedown.. When you're feeling a bit scattered, a little bit trippy with a group of friends, joint lit, not doing anything but being high on each other, scratching heads, playing with hair, talking a bit of bollocks... The sense you are one and the same, that these are the best friends you've ever had, and are more like family than anything else (especially when that's the case, and not just the loveyness of the MDMA talking). When you're holding hands and hugging each other, nothing sexual or romantic, you're basically just being high on your family. Occasionally somebody reveals something to the group we've not heard before, and instead of being high on each other we start being high on them, comforting them, talking it through.  I say being high on, not with, because we end up on a sofa or a bed, not sure whos limb is which, just enjoying each other and life."

MDMA,3be4lj,funkymonkey0426,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:28:21 2015 UTC,"The come-up.  The first time I rolled was a very odd experience as I took it moments before the group I was with decided to ditch the club we were in and head back to a hotel.  I'd tried rolling before and been sold duds, and really didn't know anything about MDMA to understand how long it took to kick in.  By the time I'd got to the hotel, I'd already assumed I'd been sold a dud and had kind of forgotten I'd taken it.   I was sat on a sofa in the reception at about 5am in the morning, chatting to a friend. And then...it happened.  I always equate it to a dark warehouse suddenly having all the lights switched on. It was that sudden.  And it was absolutely fucking incredible. And it just got better over the next couple of hours.  It's always amazing...but that first time. WOW."
MDMA,3be05n,lvmisfit,5,Sun Jun 28 09:24:20 2015 UTC,"Oxytocin is the ""happy bonding"" hormone. It's totally normal but also a big part of the ""everything is awesome!"" And the ""i Love you guys!"" feelings from MDMA. It's a totally natural hormone in all (or at least most) mammals. It's released during pleasurable activities with people you like such as cuddling, sex, breast feeding, and in small doses in hugs.  When it is in synthetic medicinal form its called Pitocin and it comes only as a nose spray, injection, or IV as far as I'm aware. There's a small culture of ""bonding parties"" where folks use it recreationally but I'm pretty sure they use the nose spray  I can't speculate on what happened to your friend but its reasonable the doctor doesn't know enough about MDMA to make a good guess either. It's not something your average ER doc knows a lot about. Oxytocin bursts both begin and end human labor and Pitocin is used to both induce birth AND to stop bleeding after births or abortions so its not a clear cut case either way. I'd guess the girl either has much more going on medically than we're hearing about or she had a crazy reaction and should be very careful in the future."

There's no way to know how much MDMA your friend will be taking this way and there could be way too much which could result in a bad time.  Just weight out 100mg and have your friend take that for their first time. Taking too little and not breaking through will feel meh and too much can be too overwhelming for a first timer. Maybe have your friend read Erowid's entry for MDMA, there's a lot of good info regarding dose, duration and effects.

MDMA,3bavq6,ben_da_gr8_1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:27:29 2015 UTC,lol you should be fine for working the club (although a bit tired) but if you took a whole one of those yellow UPS good luck.. you actually may luck out as i believe that particular pill had a large spread of dosages based on lab tests done in europe.. if you got one of the large dose pills (north of 230mg) good luck... lol if you got one of the lower dose pills though you should prolly be able to keep it together.. just wear some sunglasses so she can't see your saucer dish pupils... hahah good luck and have fun sir!
MDMA,3bavq6,n1ll0,7,Sat Jun 27 14:03:18 2015 UTC,although she did question why i was sat like this for a while :P

MDMA,3bbzvb,porofo,4,Sat Jun 27 19:45:47 2015 UTC,I'd advice against using oxy the same day as MDMA.  I'd also advice against using MDMA after a surgery for which you get oxy as a pre-op.  What kind of surgery did you get?
MDMA,3bbzvb,Maklo_Never_Forget,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:41:59 2015 UTC,I tore 3 ligaments in my ankle and im bed bound for a few months. I dont plan on using any OXY the day I roll just wondering if me using it days before roll will affect the roll in any way.
MDMA,3bbzvb,Maklo_Never_Forget,2,Sat Jun 27 22:29:48 2015 UTC,"So you are going to roll while in bed and while not being to get out?   Well,, my friendly advice is that you wait a little longer till youre off medication and still youre not bed bound anymore."
MDMA,3bbzvb,darcy_clay,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:08:38 2015 UTC,Yea that's the plan now to wait a few weeks but I would still like to know if oxy will affect the ex high because if it's going to make it less or anything I will probably wait till I have been off the oxy for a while.
MDMA,3bbzvb,phacid,3,Sun Jun 28 00:12:53 2015 UTC,Lots of unknown factors here my friend. For us at least. Often you are the best expert.

MDMA,3b9g5l,DarthMauledByABear,3,Sat Jun 27 12:05:50 2015 UTC,Thats fucked up bro
MDMA,3bac9t,Mikelemod,2,Sat Jun 27 08:05:38 2015 UTC,"Yikes. Sounds like piperazine. MDMA does NOT cause the effects you mentioned. Even speed would give you insane euphoria and at least some kind of entactogenic effect (even horniness). I once had an experience with ""pipe bombs"" and don't ever wish to repeat it — a hollow, soulless energy followed by shaking, muscle aches, and mildly painful breathing. Sound familiar?  I implore you to get a test kit and test every single fucking pill, capsule, and powder that you get. Bad trips are one thing; dire health issues are another. Don't let yourself become a casualty of shitty dealing."
MDMA,3bac9t,SinnicleSquabble,2,Sat Jun 27 08:39:02 2015 UTC,"Indeed,  I agree.  Always test!"
MDMA,3bac9t,BE_chems,2,Sat Jun 27 09:26:50 2015 UTC,"No, it's because it isn't MDMA at all."
MDMA,3b8wm8,Retrekte,3,Fri Jun 26 22:43:37 2015 UTC,"If 200 mg was too much for you last time, then knock it down to 150 mg. That should be your starting dose--however you want to break that up is up to you. Becaues snorting kicks in pretty quickly, I would drop, wait like 15 minutes, and then snort. Or I would snort a higher dose than 50mg. Not really sure because I have not experimented with starting the night like this.  If you are redosing, I think the typical recommendation is to redose only once with one half of your original amount about 90 minutes after your first dose."
MDMA,3b8wm8,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:49:57 2015 UTC,Is redosing once the initial dose has warn off with a second dose of similar size allways a bad idea/how dangerous is it?
MDMA,3b8wm8,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:19:57 2015 UTC,"Once it has worn off, so after like 4-6 hours? I think that would be pretty bad."
MDMA,3b8wm8,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:21:26 2015 UTC,"later on in the night, like 3 hours after, say first dose at 11 second at 2 to finish the night"
MDMA,3b8wm8,SirSamuelTheGreat,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:32:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I am not sure. Maybe someone more qualified can answer. I think you get diminishing returns the later the redose. Also, you will not feel the full effects of MDMA even at a large dose, so it becomes kind of a waste the more you do and the longer you wait between doses."
MDMA,3b8wm8,yellowfinger,4,Fri Jun 26 23:42:50 2015 UTC,Plug it.
MDMA,3b8wm8,NoMoney12,2,Sat Jun 27 00:55:08 2015 UTC,"The best way is plugging.  Uses much less,  much cleaner come up and you can do some ass play"
MDMA,3b8wm8,phacid,2,Sat Jun 27 03:34:42 2015 UTC,I always bomb about two thirds then snort the last bit about 45 minutes later. It always hits me perfectly
MDMA,3b8wm8,DerpThang,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:04:02 2015 UTC,"Are you sure the chest pains were related to your heart and not heartburn? If they were I would be let a doctor check it out. Also, doses for snorting are generally lower than for oral use."
MDMA,3b8wm8,chemo92,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:00:12 2015 UTC,"i dont think so but i dont see why you would, either let it dissolve under your tongue/on your gums for a quick come up and short duration or dissolve it in water and take it like a shot, not a mixture of both :P"
MDMA,3b8wm8,ben_da_gr8_1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:49:50 2015 UTC,"It taste like shit. It's terrible. Even when you snort it, the drip is disgusting.   If we're being objective (barring plugging and injecting). Orally has the most bioavailability to it, so would be the most efficient use of your dose. It's a slower come up sure, but once you're high it doesn't even matter.   Although I totally see the appeal of snorting. It hits quicker. But I find it doesn't last as long and burns like hell.   Just have patience. Learn to time your drops. Just embrace life, you don't need to be instantly high to enjoy yourself."
MDMA,3b8wm8,Lewbap,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:00:37 2015 UTC,Situstion dependent really. At house partys I do both but at a club or something I don't tend to snort cos the fuckin bouncers might see me.

I do have a test kit but mine looks the same as the ones already tested on pill reports so I'm a bit lazy to test , probably a waste of time . Lmk if you try 👍"
MDMA,3b9gu4,MollyMthrowaway,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:18:33 2015 UTC,"Had them at EDC. Only took half and was a really intense roll. Smooth come up. Probably one of the best I've had. I would recommend starting with only half, and taking the other half when you're peaking. Trust me. Or just split with a friend."
MDMA,3b9gu4,RUSTYREX25,2,Sat Jun 27 02:26:38 2015 UTC,Are you a mdma regular ? I've been on and off but probably in march I took 2 yellow Warner bros 2blue Bugattis in the span of 10 hours . Because of that I stopped since then . One whole yellow Warner bro got me good but did not floor me as much as a purple battery . How many imports have you tried before trying the blue Teslas ? And which import would it be comparable to ?
MDMA,3b9gu4,RUSTYREX25,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:42:01 2015 UTC,"this was response to my post asking about comparison between green trip advisors and blue teslas, (as an, at times, fairly regular, then at others, fairly casual user, lol, greens for me were strong, a relatively fast-ish, compared to red ups, and hard come up but one of the cleanest, bestest rolls of my life similar to purple batteries u mentioned)....https://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/39tvfa/just_ordered_some_blue_teslas_how_do_these/ not a lot of info/feedback I know, but every little helps eh? I also tried yellow warner bros (probably second batches) hence found them to also have a relatively quick but not quite as hard a come up and not quite as strong as batteries, green trips/but imao a nice come up/ride nevertheless like the green trips and purple batteries, so if this feedback is a fair reflection, whilst just as strong, the come up from blue teslas seems to be a tad faster but the overall ride seems to last longer according to the reviews on pill reports."
MDMA,3b9gu4,RUSTYREX25,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:03:29 2015 UTC,"Very nice info thanks . I usually cop beans more than a few .. And just trust reports and don't try them for a very very long time .

MDMA,3b9gu4,yellowfinger,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:24:01 2015 UTC,I wonder If the blue Teslas you have are the same ones in America ?
MDMA,3b9gu4,RUSTYREX25,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:26:46 2015 UTC,"I also trust pill reports but way I see it if u keep up to date with most recent presses and are dealing with reputable vendors u can't go wrong, obviously later presses are notorious for lesser quantities of mdma but that's better than them, pardon my French, putting additional shit in them. you are welcome kind sir, that's the beauty of this sub, sharing and caring! I reckon the blues we have are the same, as is relatively new press by relatively new presser and cant see a copycat being made in such a short space of time. that said dutch reports seem to estimate roughly 200mg per bean whilst other European test results show them to be as low as 160mg which is still nice but maybe they are measuring in wots it called hcl value or sometink like that which i think means 160 hcl mdma equals approx. 200mg. Anyway as a new producer, I'm sure he/she is trying to build a good rep and thus believe we have same beans and that these are of high quality/mdma content. only one way to find out, lol, and we will do in due course :)"

MDMA,3b9gu4,elijahsantos,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:07:00 2015 UTC,"he/she means shoving the bean up his/her anus, which apparently means a higher percentage of mdma gets absorbed quicker this way as opposed to orally, hence apparently hits harder/lasts longer, blah, blah. but personally not my cup of tea. I'm all for a more intense roll but shoving my fingers knuckle deep in my own ass doesn't quite merit the end result/feel good factor. Each to their own tho, eh, lol?"
MDMA,3b9zrq,SinnicleSquabble,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:11:06 2015 UTC,"Well a side effect of MDMA, or any amfetamine for that matter, is that it causes the norepinephrine neurotransmitter to release norepinephrine which causes you to not feel hunger (or sleep).  Eating isn't really pleasureable but your body still needs the carbs, minerals, proteins etc etc.   If you're not hungry and cant really stand solid food than a drink is a great way to pump some well needed calories into your body. Keep in mind that there is a difference between drinking 200kcals worth of cola and drinking 200kcal worth of protein shake.  tl;dr Eating on mdma is not nice, body still needs food, a shake is great."

MDMA,3b94z4,threeinchesoffury,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:23:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know what tripwhip is. Is that whippets while tripping? That also sounded awesome as a fuck.  Have you tried crazy 8s? You have someone stand up, lean forward and close their eyes. Put on some music without breaks. Then they slowly move their head in the shape of an 8. And the get faster and faster as the music picks up. After a whlie of doing that, you tell the person to fall back. Someone will catch the person, lower them to the ground, and then have them stand back and slowly touch their toes. It's intense.  EDIT: Almost forgot, you can have someone do a light show underneath someone's moving head, so they would have to have their eyes open."

MDMA,3b94z4,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:30:32 2015 UTC,Have you tried swimming on mdma? I got a pool recently and figured that would be a fun time XD
MDMA,3b94z4,BobbleheadDoll,2,Sat Jun 27 00:37:12 2015 UTC,"I have once, yes. You have to be careful, though, because it is easy to drown. Just stay in the shallow end and do not try to swim.  Get soft towels and tons of soft things.  Hot tub would feel nice too (but dont' stay in too long because you want to maintain a normal body temperature). I haven't done a hot tub."
MDMA,3b94z4,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"What was it like? I was thinking of doing it at night while rolling and on the come down to try to achieve a sort of sensory deprivation tank. Its an above ground pool that's only 4ft something deep so i can stand up and not drown and ill have my cousin with me if anything happens. The depth gives me confidence to try and swim a bit but we'll see how it feels. I've heard that you should try to maintain a normal body temperature, but why is that? I usually put on a sweater and turn the ac down a bit (~70°f) and put a sweater on bc its soft and feels nice XD  And of course thats a must!  I was thinking about showering and i usually take pretty long/hot showers, would you advise against that? I can turn down the heat, would that make it safer to stay in longer?  Sorry for all the questions btw .-."
MDMA,3b94z4,RUSTYREX25,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:46:54 2015 UTC,"Well, it was amazing! Yeah, you can try swimming then! I was too scared to drink because it felt so good.  It's good to keep a normal body temperature to reduce neurotoxicity effects and other physiological effects due to high body temperature.  Yeah, soft things are nice to wear!  Yeah, take a shower! That's what I do. hahaha. Just try not to stay too long.  and ask away!"
MDMA,3b94z4,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"YAY. I might skip the pool if it's too cold cause of the body temperature but im definitely going to shower. I love leaving the curtains open so the light is shining in (I have good lighting in there and the water doesn't splash out of the shower so it works out.) and turn my music on my phone. Its super fun to just be in there and stare at everything on acid, I'm sure being on mdma will be cool too.   Alrighty then good to know  XD  Last questions lol,  do you know if theres anyway to intensify the roll and are there any ways to go to sleep easier?"
MDMA,3b7tto,ravenkain251,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:47:48 2015 UTC,I really doubt anyone here is going to know the answer to this  You're better off at /r/drugs or /r/drugnerds

MDMA,3b7dkb,candy9821,3,Fri Jun 26 15:49:33 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend R-ALA as a substitute for Na-R-ALA, but as alexanderis said below. You probably won't die/it's better then nothing. Just keep looking anyway. Mostly because rollsafe.org says so, but also because from what I've read Na-R-ALA is better for you. It can be hard to find in stores for sure. I know that. Is there a reason you can't just order it online?  The Magnesium Bisglycinate should be fine. Give it a try and report back if it doesn't do it's job (relieving jaw clenching). If I remember right the Bisglycinate just has to deal with absorption of the magnesium. I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be okay.  Be safe! Stay awesome."
MDMA,3b7dkb,BrotherMidas,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:57:50 2015 UTC,R-ALA is better than nothing though and just doesn't stay in your system as long. That means you'll have to pop one every hour of the roll to get similar benefits to NA-R-ALA.
MDMA,3b7dkb,alexanderls,2,Fri Jun 26 17:23:20 2015 UTC,Ahhh. Okay. That makes sense. TIL. Thank you.

MDMA,3b8axu,dakuria,2,Fri Jun 26 19:51:29 2015 UTC,Normal. What is your body weight? I am wondering if 125 mg was a low dose for you because you should not have been tired just after 2 hours. Did you supplement before and after?  Try to exercise and eat healthy. You should have these symptoms for 1-3 days and up to 2 weeks.
MDMA,3b8axu,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:09:19 2015 UTC,"64 kg, so it's almost 2 mg/kg; definitely not low.  Supplements:  -Green Tea Extract  -Magnesium (1000mg citrate - still had teeth grinding)  -Vitamin C  -Alpha Lipoic Acid  Thanks, I hope it goes away soon. I've been making some vegetable/fruit smoothies, so hopefully that'll help me recover. I'm just really disappointed that I got kinda depressed and tired during the roll."
MDMA,3b8axu,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:19:46 2015 UTC,"Okay, and you said you tested it, right?   When was the last time you rolled? And did you take the 125 mg all at once? Or did you break it up over the night?  And, you know, that has happened to me before. It is really disappointing when you don't feel the magic. Just take a longer break (3-6 months) and try again. You'll get through this."
MDMA,3b8axu,RandallWho,2,Fri Jun 26 20:22:26 2015 UTC,"It is really disappointing when you don't feel the magic   he never said he didnt feel the magic, he said it was short lived and he said he got sad.  Both are pretty normal.  100-125mg will only keep me going for a few hours and as for the feelings, that happens, just because you take mdma doesnt not mean you going to have happy thoughts all the time on  it.  your brain chemsistry is haywire, its just as easy to go down a less the light path as it is to follow the light."
MDMA,3b8axu,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe you are right. Maybe he felt the magic.  Yeah, I think we came to the conclusion that he just did not use enough."
MDMA,3b8axu,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:49:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, it went straight to black. I rolled about a year ago at 100mg. And yes, I took it all at once.  The first time I did it, I didn't test it, so maybe the extra shit in it made it better than MDMA really is? I'm not sure. :/"
MDMA,3b8axu,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:24:08 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, wow interesting. How much of the 125 mg did you take out? Maybe you actually took less than 125 mg? Also, what was your ROA?  So it's been a year since you rolled. You should have rolled pretty good. Maybe it is just one of those flukes. :/"
MDMA,3b8axu,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"I used oral. Well, I didn't weigh it, but it was a 250mg bag and I ate a little more than half of it (so the dose isn't precise). It really should've worked. These were pure white MDMA crystals. It really sucks.  What do you mean by fluke?"
MDMA,3b8axu,RandallWho,2,Fri Jun 26 20:30:15 2015 UTC,"Okay. How do you know it was a 250 mg if you didn't weigh it?  Sometimes these things happen due to things we do not know about. It has happened to me before--I will roll for like 30-45 mins, never reach my peak, and then just come down for the rest of the time. This happened to me when I was abusing MDMA. This has also happened when I wasn't abusing MDMA. I know that you are not abusing MDMA, so it might just be a fluke. Give yourself a decent break and then try again."
MDMA,3b8axu,thgiftac_,0,Fri Jun 26 20:39:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't, but I assume it's close because it was from a pretty reputable onion. You're right though, no one can know for sure what it weighed. The amount looked about right though (it filled 1/5-1/4/ of a 00 capsule, which averages about 500mg of substance depending on density).  I mean, the problem is that for the entire roll I had amazing bodily euphoria. I was rolling pretty hard. I just don't know why I got depressed while I was rolling.  I'll try this again in a few weeks and plug it instead."
MDMA,3b7ejj,JitterJosh,6,Fri Jun 26 15:57:06 2015 UTC,"I think most people do it that way because of A) harm reduction and B) a lot of people feel there is less ROI (return on investment) if you take more then your initial amount. Think finite supply of happy juice and its used up in your initial dose so why waste more drugs.  Personally in the past i would start out with smaller doses and work my way up, 100mg, 200mg re-dose. For me it would start of mild and then get progressively stronger. i imagine it would be the same doing it your way."
MDMA,3b7ejj,RandallWho,6,Fri Jun 26 16:58:59 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of ecstasy by the way (depending on your body weight). You can do it as an experiment and see how it works out for you. Then, next time, you can redose with half and see how it goes. Dosing with this much can be pretty neurotoxic, so be warned. If you are just experimenting, it should be okay, but you should realize that it is neurotoxic to take this much ecstasy.  If it were me and I did not care about neurotoxicity and I was going to roll like this, I would think about the ROA of the initial dose and redose. You might just swallow the first pill normally and then either plug or snort .5 of the remaining pill and parachute the 1 pill an hour and a half later. I've always wanted to try plugging, so I would do that. Multiple redoses is not recommended: they will only extend your roll by a miniscule amount and will make your comedown way worse."
MDMA,3b7ejj,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:06:40 2015 UTC,"when redosing, i usually start with a larger dose (let's say 1/2 a pill) and then redose periodically with smaller doses (1/4). the larger dose kind of kick starts the roll for me and gets me up there and then the smaller ones keep me up on that level."
MDMA,3b7ejj,csandz,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:48:01 2015 UTC,"All I have to add is that twice I started with half a dutch bean (around 100mg) and then stupidly thinking nothing was happening re-dosed with another 2 halves in quick succession (about 200mg). Now this was from wot I recall on both occasions half an hour/45 mins later/after my initial dose, hence my obvious hastiness. but personally I had two off the biggest kick ass, most beautiful rolls of my life with a decent, smooth, slow comedown. so whilst not suggesting this by any means, my advice wud be if u do decide to redose bigger than original, maybe make sure u do so no later than an hour tops maximum and only ever once after intitial drop. But as we are all different/unique (body chemistry/genetics wise), my experience shud by no means be generalised. I now prefer dropping 2/3rds of a dutchie followed by another half later, this feels just as good, if not better and admitably feels less messier and with more clarity of thought/action than b4, espesh towards the end of roll. Hence, my conclusion, that by recently redosing closer to the advice originally given by shuglin (I think that's his name in that he recommended redosing half of original dose only once) and supported by many others here, I have to agree that I have since had a somewhat better roll (more peak, less duration in my view). Thus for me and for many others this is the preferred, safer method for redosing on this sub. I do however think ultimately, a little and I stress little experimentation to find your own personal sweet spot, and best method of dosing is acceptable but please do not be act as hasty as I did initially. peace :)"

MDMA,3b7t78,baconmma,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:48:24 2015 UTC,I consider antioxidants to be the most important supplements so I'd say your supply is good. Maybe try to get some vitamin C too. You could probs get that from a supermarket.

It's not to say it won't work, you'll just have to take more of it and may have some unintended side effects.  The other two are fine.  If you have trouble finding the supplements that are recommended there are some all-in-one products out there you can try.  It's probably more expensive than buying everything separately, but way easier."
MDMA,3b7t78,MDAzing,2,Mon Jun 29 18:59:06 2015 UTC,Its better than nothing but more could be added  go get some melatonin at the very least
MDMA,3b7t78,GhostOfAlRoker,4,Fri Jun 26 18:20:11 2015 UTC,All melatonin does is help you fall asleep. If you're going to add anything else get 5-htp
MDMA,3b7t78,MDAzing,5,Fri Jun 26 20:18:48 2015 UTC,"nah its an anti oxidant and is apart of the recommended supplementation regent created by /u/MisterYouAreSoDumb  you are supposed to take 10mg of it  5htp doesnt do anything to reduce neurotoxicity it just sorta helps your brain replenish its serotonin supplies post-roll, but it is not a bad idea to get some of that as well."
MDMA,3b7t78,rocketno40,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:24:27 2015 UTC,it's also important to note that in some studies melatonin (at high does; eg. 10mg) was shown to decrease body temperature by as much as 1 degree celsius.  this is good when coming down or when you get home from rolling as its very easy to overheat when taking (especially too much) mdma

MDMA,3b7t78,rocketno40,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:13:50 2015 UTC,"5htp will cross the bbb when other antioxidants like EGCG and B6 are taken in tandem, so i wouldn't totally write it off, these 3 supplements are excellent post load combo for a comedown"

Its not even that good.  Drop .100 or .120, redose once with .100. It wont last you all day but its one of the less brainwrecking dosage schedules"
MDMA,3b6wbx,EQDISTORTEQ,-1,Fri Jun 26 15:17:52 2015 UTC,Agree with this.  I'd recommend redosing only once and just take more with each dose.  Wouldn't recommend doing any more than .35 or .4 depending on how much you weigh
MDMA,3b6wbx,littlelionel10,2,Fri Jun 26 15:45:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, we should get OP's weight and then decide how much to take. 1.5 mg/kg should be good enough."

I am inclined to believe the former/first story over the other/latter, as the second team still appear to be producing quality dutch presses. also we have the relatively new, apparently dutch produced blue teslas (which I just obtained and have received gr8 feedback/look high quality) and I believe are a first from a new producer. Then we have the orange teslas u mentioned, another quality press by another reputable producer (though possibly not dutch), who recently announced on reddit his new/upcoming products (snapchats and starbucks designs from what I recall). So whilst there might seem to be a dip in availability I am personally confident that quality dutch presses, or those from other origins which are just as good, are far from gone, perhaps your interpretation owes more to the fact that its is tougher/more difficult/riskier for vendors to get hold of these dutch presses these days via customs and moreover that some presses seem to sell out a lot faster than others at certain points in time, for example before a big event like EDC or Glastonbury, it is summer festival season afterall, just be patient."

I think there are other organizations or people who have collected better data than me to make more accurate determinations of the proper dosage.  MOllymeasure uses 1.5 mg/kg for first timers."

George Greer, a pioneering MDMA therapist, used 75-125mg and felt that 150mg was the highest dose that should ever be used.  (Basing a dose on a person's weight is an imperfect way to make it less likely that they'll get too big or too small a dose.)  In terms of studies in healthy people, Vollenweider's group in Switzerland first used 1.7 mg/kg and then came down to 1.5 mg/kg, the Barcelona group initially used 100mg (very close to 1.5 mg/kg for an average person), and the group I was in at UCSF used 1.5 mg/kg.  Later groups followed suit.  A study a few years ago estimated the probability of desired and undesired effects at different doses of pills. They found the probability of positive effects peaked around 81-100 mg. I clipped out the main image here: https://plus.google.com/+MatthewBaggott/posts/hVtaBzXmj29"

So just breath, maybe close your eyes, definitely sit or lay down, and the anxiety will melt into pure bliss. Trust me, honestly the best part is going from coming up to pure ecstasy!"
MDMA,3b6leh,Troyster143,2,Sat Jun 27 12:53:34 2015 UTC,Had and amazing time on Friday!  The come up was definitely a wild feeling.  I was sitting on the couch played some video games when it kicked in.  I stood up and just had to walk around to get through it.  Lots of deep breaths and pacing.  Once it was over though... Wow!  The whole night was literally perfect.  Everything was perfect.  Thanks for the tips!
MDMA,3b6leh,n1ll0,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:49:45 2015 UTC,I second this! limiting the amount of stimuli I am exposed to usually helps keep me from feeling overwhelmed.. you will still feel the intense rush of euphoria all at once but not having a bunch of stuff going on around you to overwhelm your senses should help a bit.. it should only last a few minutes before you feel perfect!   Have fun!

I would wait at least a month. Try to exercise a little too. Glad you're getting off those btw. Ssris are very dangerous to the body. Even though they may seem to help some people in critical times. I would start off with 100mg or so to see if your serotonin is still being recycled by the ssris. If you don't feel anything. I would wait another month. Hope this helps."

MDMA,3b5cu8,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:41:50 2015 UTC,Your body can only absorb so much of a vitamin/supplement. So taking so more than you normally would can only do so much. I'd do what you normally do.

MDMA,3b59fa,grissabria,2,Fri Jun 26 02:07:49 2015 UTC,It always depends on how much you trust the person (and trust her ability to know if something is good or not and tested or not).  I've given mdma to friends and they took it because they trust me. So i guess it happens a lot

MDMA,3b5991,SinnicleSquabble,4,Fri Jun 26 02:06:15 2015 UTC,"MDA is actually a bit different than MDMA.  I would say MDMA is the one we all know and love, while MDA is the crazy cousin.  MDA is definitely more hallucinogenic than MDMA, and 100mg is what most would consider one dose.  I also wouldn't worry about ""being too thizzed out"" because honestly, I find MDA to be more euphoric, and less tweaky, if that makes sense.  400mg of good quality of MDA is more than enough for two people.  Have a good time, we all know you already will.  :)"
MDMA,3b5991,72APTU72E,3,Fri Jun 26 02:53:50 2015 UTC,"MDA always seemed to affect me more strongly than MDMA, but that could also be a dosage issue with regard to presses. Those White Lightnings that I had back in 2011 (and that still appear to be floating around in select lucky places) were ridiculous.   Definitely feel you on the ""less tweaky"" bit — I get way more euphoria but in a mellower sense."
MDMA,3b5991,mango-mang,3,Fri Jun 26 03:02:46 2015 UTC,Enough for 4 people possibly 5
MDMA,3b5991,RedditMDMA,2,Fri Jun 26 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"Good MDA is much stronger and trippyer than MDMA ...you should never need to dose as high as MDMA..Also you guys likely have no tolerance ..I'd honestly start with 80mg, wait for it to hit and go from there."
MDMA,3b5991,disposable125,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:48:18 2015 UTC,"Depending on the person, 200mg of pure MDA could be enough to be overwhelming, especially without tolerance. MDA is very different from MDMA and I would not want 200mg to be my introductory dose. I think 110-150 would be more conservative as 50mg can easily be the difference between great and excessive.   I would not redose either. MDA lasts significantly longer than MDMA so redosing can sometimes drag things on to the point they get weird or uncomfortable."
MDMA,3b5991,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:22:24 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to get super thizzed out, do about 1.5 mg/kg. Then redose with .75 mg/kg.  If you want to get super thizzed out, do 2-2.25 mg/kg and redose with 1-1.125 mg/kg.  Actually, you said you had MDA rather than MDMA. I am not sure if the same rules apply (though I think they do)."

So clean — makes me incredibly happy that good stuff can still be found.   Both of us used to roll regularly, but that was three years ago for me and way too long for my BF. Maybe we'll start out with 75mg and see how that goes. Not like we won't have more if we need it!"
MDMA,3b3mfh,dashboardgenius,8,Thu Jun 25 18:17:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, it might. But she might also be very receptive. Is the secret really so bad that it will ruin your marriage or something like that?  Have you guys rolled before? Make sure you measure out your doses very carefully. If your first time, take 1.5 mg/kg for each person. Also, have water on standby, keep your body temperature normal, and just have fun!  EDIT: But it's not like you will confess in the way you think you will. You will not have an overwhelming urge to just share the truth. MDMA works indirectly by making you feel more comfortable with what you say and with saying those things to other people. But you can still control whether you say something or not. Hope that helps and clarifies things."
MDMA,3b3mfh,BobbleheadDoll,4,Thu Jun 25 18:20:52 2015 UTC,"So like the same way you might be more open to talk about things when you're drunk, but you're still only going to say the things you wish you were brave enough to say when you aren't drunk?"
MDMA,3b3mfh,BobbleheadDoll,4,Thu Jun 25 19:13:51 2015 UTC,That might be a good way to think about it.
MDMA,3b3mfh,bunnydoctor,7,Thu Jun 25 19:37:37 2015 UTC,"Let's say your secret is on a scale of 1-10.  Where 1 is ""I'll easily  talk about it"" and 10 is ""OMG I will take this secret to my grave""  It sounds like your secret is a 7. You have a strong desire not to talk about this.  If you had a 3, MDMA might turn it into a 1.  But it isn't going to do something major like you are worried about.  If it did, the CIA would be using it as a truth serum.  I confessed something with my SO that I really had not planned to talk about, but MDMA made it really easy.  But it wasn't a major secret."
MDMA,3b3mfh,sassystrike,2,Thu Jun 25 20:36:47 2015 UTC,"You're going to be very aware and careful of what you're saying and how you say it. there won't be any ill intent behind your words if you do discuss your secret. your SO will also be much more understanding and receptive to listening. if you don't feel comfortable telling your secret and it's not relevant to your current loves together, maybe you should keep it to yourself if you think it will only cause harm. I don't think it is healthy to keep dark secrets though. if you can't tell your SO maybe try talking to a counselor."

BUT i do have a secret that i've felt guilty about for a while and it's never come out when i've talked to my boyfriend while rolling. you will have more control over that than you think. ALSO, if you're both rolling and you do happen to accidentally reveal the secret, your partner might take it much better than she would sober just because the drug does make you that much happier and more understanding. hope this helps! i know you'll both have a great time together though no matter what happens :-)"

MDMA,3b3zo5,Klausar,3,Thu Jun 25 19:55:00 2015 UTC,I feel I should point this out: be prepared for the comeup. The first ever comeup on MDMA is one of the most indescribable experiences ever.

MDMA,3b3zo5,Ozelotten,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:30:53 2015 UTC,"It can be overwhelming, kinda disorenting and you can feel a little sick. Just lie back, let it wash over you, and remind yourselves that it's only temporary; you'll be more than glad you went through it soon after. Personally, I've never found it too bad.  As for your other questions...   The dosage people often suggest is body weight (in kg) * 1.5. In this case, 90mg each, though anything around there would be fine too. If you want to redose, you can take half the amount (so 45mg if you dropped 90mg earlier) 1.5 - 2 hours later. Comedowns can be different every time. Smoking a joint as you're coming down does help. Once you've come down, you should have no trouble sleeping! It's possible you'll feel fine, it's possible you'll feel out of it for a while, it's possible you'll still be tired from going to sleep late. You can improve how you feel with supplements (such as 5-HTP to regain your seratonin). Your heart beats faster, you can get sweaty, you will probably be clenching your teeth - have plenty of gum and take some magnesium pills before and during if you can to reduce this. If you go outside, remember that you won't feel the cold as much and if you go to pee, you'll find it harder (I mean you'll find peeing harder, not your dick, which you will find perpetually unhard). Also your eyes do that weird flickery wiggly thing, Drink ~1 pint of water (500ml) every hour to stay hydrated without overhydrating.   On how your friend feels, if she's talking about doing this, I think she'll overcome any apprehension. In my experience, people who are a bit worried tend to come around pretty quickly once they're up (the ""Why have I never done this before?!"" moment).  Finally, check out Rollsafe - it tells you pretty much everything you'll need to know, as well as suggesting some supplements to make the roll better.  Have fun!"
MDMA,3b3zo5,The_Grid_Is_Up,2,Fri Jun 26 06:35:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Just one last question, how long does it take until we feel the first thing and how long does it take until we are really ""in it""? Thanks for your help so far!"
MDMA,3b3zo5,Ozelotten,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:01:01 2015 UTC,"It depends if you have food in your stomach or not. If you don't you'll get first alerts around a half hour in. Then it swiftly transitions into the come up which lasts about 15-20 mins on average. At about the 1 hour mark you will be ""in it""."
MDMA,3b3zo5,suche1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:48:05 2015 UTC,"How long it takes varies from person to person and from time to time. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes to start feeling anything, I find, but it could take twice that. It could also take longer for one person than it does for the other, even if you've both dosed the same, so don't be surprised if you're both coming up at different times and don't panic-redose."
MDMA,3b3zo5,The_Grid_Is_Up,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:47:47 2015 UTC,"What should I expect to happen? What is it like?   Come up is my favourite part of rolling but it's really hard to describe it in words.. I usually start huffing, breathing really deep because everything feels so good in my body. Like orgasmic and let out sighs and moans, lol. It's a bit cringe-worthy but it really just means you're having an awesome time and anyone who's rolling with you will understand that!  Also my hands usually start to wander as everything feels good to touch.  Don't worry about throwing up - though I think that won't be an issue with low doses - but if you need to hurl just do it.  You will feel absolutely amazing and light afterwards so do not worry about throwing up.  Some people don't like the come up as much because it can be overwhelming (I guess) but really it's one of the best things I know. Just relax and enjoy the ride :)"

MDMA,3b3zo5,OfficialYoungNitro,2,Fri Jun 26 10:13:53 2015 UTC,"It will be harder to eyeball a third of it than you think. And I'm not aware of your source, but street sources are usually unreliable with dosages. I'd recommend splitting the big pills in half and seeing how that goes, and if it's ok then split the second half of the pill again and take that, since I'm assuming you don't have a scale, and the weight of pills also comes from fillers. Safe dosage. Make sure you eat like 6 hours before hand so that you aren't too full or too lethargic - has a big impact on roll. Expect to get hot, for your heart to start beating faster with less action.   First timers usually get the ""magic"" which includes the second day and you feel incredibly in touch with everybody and your emotions. Though it's possible you'll be anywhere from up to way down emotionally as well. Make sure BEFORE you roll talk about if sexual activity and/or petting/groping is ok and whether or not you might change your mind (probably will want to). A playlist that you don't have to change (but still picking every song is fun, though sometimes difficult to focus on). Reefer is up to your individual persuasion. Some people love it, some people get anxiety from smoking on a roll (I do). Though, smoking on the come down will probably happen- just keep in mind weed increases blood pressure and heart rate. Any other questions feel free to ask. I've rolled a handful of times and made mistakes here and there."

What's the effect we should expect from, let's say 100mg MDMA? Isn't it too much for a light person like me (55-60kg)? I heared about 1,5mg per 1kg bodyweigh."
MDMA,3b3zo5,Jammy507,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:34:37 2015 UTC,"use rollsafe.org. there was a website that asks your body weight and if it's your first time or not and tells you suggested amount. for me, I weigh 150lbs and am 5'7"" and my first time I did just 100 milligrams and was rolling pretty damn hard, but comfortably strong if that makes sense."
MDMA,3b3zo5,B42m0row,2,Mon Jun 29 03:12:41 2015 UTC,"I recommend starting with 100 mg and then redosing with half later on.  Lots of great tips. Get a good music playlist consisting of your favorite music and some good techno dance music. Get lotion and massage oil. Get speakers. Get something with lights, like a strobe light, glow sticks orsomething else. Get lots of soft things, especially a blanket that you two can share.  As far as your physiological experience, you can expect heightened touch, sweaty palms (especially on come up), sweat, increased body temperature, racing heartbeat, clenched jaw.  That reminds me, get something like a pacifier or chewing gum."
MDMA,3b3zo5,trolest,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:22:53 2015 UTC,"First of all, the best thing about having pills is that you don't really need to crumble it up! This is pretty much the reason people buy pills. They're pre-calculated doses. The reason people put crystal MDMA in cig papers and swallow them is to sort of make them into a pill!   For your first dose, I would leave the 217mg pill out of it. Get one of the 240mg pills each and bite half of them off. You'll come up in around 50 mins. Once you've come up, take the next half! Or depending on how you're feeling, take the half and then half the other pill. But for first timers, I think just one pill each would do fine.   Coming to the questions. I think one pill each is enough for a first roll, but if you have the other pill you'll probably just have a better time to be honest :)  Comedowns are extremely individual specific, but for first time rollers comedowns are usually cushioned by the afterglow of what just happened to you. You should get some different types of berries and make a fruit salad for the next day. Get some fresh OJ or smoothie (or both!) Get as many different vitamins in your body the next day and go for a walk. If it's nice weather; bonus! If not, maybe go to a mall or something and just mooch about.   Don't expect to be able to sleep for at least 4 hours after your last dose kicks in. Smoking weed is fine, but I don't like it while peaking. Especially for your first time, I'd leave it until you REALLY just want to get to sleep. That way you can enjoy the substance on its own. Weed also makes me feel anxious, so that is partially why I'm saying this.  The next day, I've sort of already explained. If you are drinking alcohol, it will be much worse. I recommend you don't drink alcohol or maybe just have 1-2 beers max. Make sure you get out of the house. If you stay in, you're going to sulk and not have as much fun.  The most important thing I wish I knew about when I first tried MDMA is the come up. Make sure you don't smoke anything while coming up or up to about 15-20 mins after. It could make you throw up. Try to stick to water during this period aswell. If you need to throw up while coming up, just do it. Remind yourself it's not a big deal. I've never really noticed my heart beating faster, to be honest. Expect to 'gurn' which is clamping your jaw/grinding your teeth. Some people like to chew chewing gum for this, so maybe get a pack. I personally find it just makes me gurn more. If you have music on, you'll feel very connected to it. Don't hesitate to lie down on the floor and just enjoy feeling the tingling sensations going through your body. Avoid caffeine beforehand as this can make gurning worse. You may want to start petting, hugging and caressing each other. Head massages at this point feel better than sex. Make sure you get some music on! I have a lot of recommendations if you'd like. Dancing is a lot of fun.   IF things start getting hot and heavy, remember your penis might not work. Even if it does, you probably won't come.   I have no idea what you can say to her. I've been taking hard drugs for a year and a half now. I still haven't been able to convince my girlfriend it's safe, and it's putting a lot of stress on our relationship.  DON'T FORGET TO DRINK WATER"
MDMA,3b3zo5,BrinxJob,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:25:48 2015 UTC,"Dosage will give a good first time, although you could go up to 100-120mg to have a hard roll for your first time, maybe 100mg max for your friend cause of her anxiety. The comedown is usually mellow, if you smoke a joint even better.  Take 10mg melatonine tablet just before bed, its antioxidant and you sleep like a rock If you get a good night of sleep, it shouldnt be so bad although you have some kind of hangover For sure huge pupils, maybe sweating, sometimes a bit of nausea at the come up for some people Buy a test kit, and buy supplements Supplements: http://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/15m9sf/mdma_supplementation/ Test kit: http://bunkpolice.org/basic-test-kit/"

MDMA,3b3czu,Armunt,4,Thu Jun 25 17:11:57 2015 UTC,"What exactly are you doubting?  People can usually have sex on the comedown, unless it is not a super clean roll.  Also, get tons of  cozy fluffy soft things, like fleece or microfiber blankets. Create a music playlist."

MDMA,3b3czu,BobbleheadDoll,4,Fri Jun 26 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"go to Walgreens or cvs and invest in a menthol inhaler at the cold and remedies section. that feels amazing when you're rolling. as do menthol cigarettes (if you guys smoke) it seems silly but grab some pacifiers if you can. it'll really help with the jaw clenches. the massage oil will be nice as your senses are intensified during a roll.  I also suggest speakers to play whatever music you guys are into and in terms of having sex it's very possible you won't be able to until the end of your roll. some people call it ""stim dick"" because stimulants can affect your ability to get hard. honestly my best advice to you is to prep yourselves for a great roll and although you guys might not use it all you'll have it to your disposal. just talk to her and see what she wants to do! have a fun and safe roll guys :)"
MDMA,3b3czu,ageofprogress,2,Thu Jun 25 17:26:48 2015 UTC,"This is great advice, especially the speakers! They will be very important. You can also set them up next to the bathroom when you guys take a couple's bath. :)  Ummm, if you can find one and afford it, get a strobe light for an awesome light show.  As far as not being able to get an erection--that is definitely possible. I am not sure what the advice is about cialis or viagra with MDMA. It might be unsafe."
MDMA,3b3czu,RedditMDMA,4,Thu Jun 25 17:36:24 2015 UTC,"If you're more experienced with MDMA, one thing I might suggest is that you wait and take your dose about 30 minutes after she takes her dose. The comeup is usually the most uncomfortable part for newcomers to MDMA, so you being in a more sober state of mind can be helpful to help her through it.   It's how I always do it if I'm taking MDMA with a first/second-timer. I never have issues with the comeup, really, but during that 30-60 min period I can be a little disoriented and not as suited to assisting others with their comeups. Delaying by 30 mins means I've always been able to put out any fires that come up, so to speak, before getting really crazy myself."

MDMA,3b3czu,dafuq_mayne,3,Thu Jun 25 19:33:40 2015 UTC,"I'm curious too to know why you are doubtful? Me and my SO have found that we much rather roll home alone with each other these days than at clubs or raves.  You may or may not be able to have sex but truthfully it usually doesn't even matter when you roll. Sex feels kind of redundant because just cuddling and feeling each other is enough. We've usually spent hours just talking to each other when we roll.   Get some glow sticks, oil is a really good idea as is bath salts. I've heard that taking a bath during come up is supposed to feel orgasmic on its own, sadly we don't have a bath tub in our apartment so I haven't been able to test that out yet... Best advice I can give you guys though is to go with the flow. If you try to plan your night to the minute it might end up being frustrating when you manage to do none of the things you had planned."

We were in the shower for an hour and a half just caressing, lathering soap on each other, shampooing each others hair, holy shit it was so amazing. I felt no sexual urges honestly it was wayyyy more intimate than anything and was definitely a night I'll remember for the rest of my life. We each had a green tulip I parachuted mine each had about 200 milligrams so if you guys have 2 pills I'd definitely start with half then redose an hour later or sooner depending on how you're feeling."

MDMA,3b3czu,RedditMDMA,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:36:12 2015 UTC,"It depends on how many mg of MDMA are in each pill. If you haven't tested it (Marquis kit), you won't even know if it has MDMA in it.

MDMA,3azy1h,singlemothers,5,Thu Jun 25 02:16:07 2015 UTC,"Dissolving in water won't harm the MDMA at all.  If you let the water evaporate you will be left with a powder you can scrape up.  You can put the water onto a baking sheet and let it evaporate, or heat it up at very low heat.  Do not boil the water.

In my experience 80:20-60:40 have been good ratios, I lean more towards the 50:50 mix, but my girlfriend prefers much less MDA, she goes 70:30 always"

MDMA,3axy2f,fightclubdevil,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:56:03 2015 UTC,"And yeah there will be 100% cross tolerance, both molecules are really similar being amphetamines."
MDMA,3axy2f,MySweetUsername,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:11:11 2015 UTC,"you are wrong.  from pihkal, ""Tolerance studies also support differences in mechanisms of action. In one study, MDMA was consumed at 9:00 AM each day for almost a week (120 milligrams the first day and 160 milligrams each subsequent day) and by the fifth day there were no effects from the drug except for some mydriasis. And even this appeared to be lost on the sixth day. At this point of total tolerance, there was consumed (on day #7, at 9:00 AM) 120 milligrams of MDA and the response to it was substantially normal with proper chronology, teeth clench, and at most only a slight decrease in mental change. A complete holiday from any drug for another 6 days led to the reversal of this tolerance, in that 120 milligrams of MDMA had substantially the full expected effects. The fact that MDMA and MDA are not cross-tolerant strengthens the argument that they act in different ways, and at different sites in the brain."""
MDMA,3axy2f,disposable125,2,Wed Jun 24 15:54:34 2015 UTC,"That MDMA and MDA are not cross tolerant has never been proven and is almost certainly untrue. This isn't the first insane statement Shulgin made. The studies he likely took in to consideration coming to this conclusion never actually suggested that these drugs were not cross tolerant. He came to that conclusion on his own even though the sample sizes were absurdly small.   Cross tolerance between these drugs is in reality likely extremely high. MDA is more complex than MDMA in that like MDMA it is a strong releasing agent. It's also a strong agonist which MDMA really isn't. Based on current understanding of these drugs, it's safe to assume MDA will result in significant tolerance to MDMA. Visa versa is also true, but probably to a lesser but still significant degree.  Empirically speaking, I have found both drugs to produce very significant tolerance to one another. That's just me though."

MDMA,3axy2f,disposable125,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:35:39 2015 UTC,"Too bad there aren't any controlled studies comparing the two. Maybe you should ask why Shulgin didn't bother to site any publications supporting his theory.   I don't know how Shulgin came to this conclusion. As he cited absolutely nothing and then proceeded to die, we will never know.   Deconstruct his argument in reverse. Shulgin states that MDA and MDMA don't act at the same receptor sites. The opposite has been proven. As a whole MDMA and MDA act on the same receptors albeit the selectivity and potency of each differs. Sorry, but I'm not going to go digging up papers investigating their various affinities because broad scope studies don't exist. Generally, researchers will investigate these compounds mechanisms at one or two specific sites.   A definite answer doesn't exist. Receptor interaction studies show that MDA and MDMA as a whole act on mostly the same sites. Extrapolation would say that because of this, they would be at least somewhat cross tolerant.   All I'm saying is these drugs are certainly not extensively understood. Shulgin was human and wrote more than a few funky procedures and made some far reaching assumptions. That MDA and MDMA aren't cross tolerant certainly is one of these. The jury is still out and your guess is as good as mine or Shulgin's frankly. Still, I think you'd find that the general consensus is that MDA and MDMA would produce some extent of cross tolerance to one another."

The MDA will overpower the MDMA, making your trip draining and trippy .You'll probably hallucinate and feel distant/untrusting of people, especially randos at the club due to the MDA. MDA feels like the trippy end of an MDMA comedown after smoking a bunch of weed and dancing all night, minus the shitty comedown feeling - until you start coming down.

This means you could be severely underdosing OR overdosing the caps just due to the inherent inaccuracy of a .1g scale...   I actually tried doing exactly what you are suggestion and it was an absolute nightmare  EDIT: oh also, they have a minimum weight they are able to measure as well, so if you tried to just measure out say .1g of your powder, it may or may not even register on the scale."

MDMA,3axalx,GhostlyFireCunt,2,Wed Jun 24 07:02:45 2015 UTC,I love lurking ecstasydata.org every once in awhile. I always find it interesting to see what crazy chemicals are getting sold off as MDMA.   Like look how crazy this pill is that was sold off as 'molly':  Orange Bull  Not as crazy as the one /u/bunnydoctor found but at least the pill they linked had MDMA in it. I definitely don't doubt I had pills like the Orange Bull back in 2010-2012 before I knew about test kits. I do not miss those days whatsoever
MDMA,3axalx,GhostlyFireCunt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:51:27 2015 UTC,"Wow.  That was sold just a couple of months ago.  Meth + ethylone (3:1).  I wonder if that really fools anyone?  I have never done meth, but from what I have heard about its effects, I can't imagine anyone mistaking it for MDMA."

MDMA,3axalx,BrinxJob,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:12:28 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Shit like that doesn't necessarily make me upset, it's more of a thing to poke jokes at for me, but when I say they ruin the scene I mean they've created such a high demand that so many scumbags have hopped on the trend of selling them, and by proxy a ton of other people, garbage. Just because it's popular enough to get away with. See: alprazolam sold as ""pure dutch MDMA.""   Not to mention some of my friends picking up stuff and just bombing .5's because they're so used to garbage..."
MDMA,3axalx,adissaddd,2,Thu Jun 25 12:40:44 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, it's terribly difficult to get pure MDMA on the streets. But again, that shouldn't affect you too much since there are other ways to find it (e.g. online) - and if you don't wanna use those other ways I guess that means you just aren't that into MDMA?  But if it's cause you don't wanna roll with your .5-bombing friends, and have no one else to roll with and don't like rolling alone either, that makes a lot of sense."

Thershold according to Erowid is 30mg but microdosing doesn't work the same way for MDMA as it would for LSD or mushrooms.

MDMA,3ay1uz,Rollingthrowaway456,2,Wed Jun 24 12:32:40 2015 UTC,"what kind of setting will you be using in?If you are staying at home you have full control. Make sure you have water nearby to sip at from time to time.  As for doses... It really depends on the person. I've taken MDMA pretty regularly lately (taking a bit of a break atm) and 100mg is really a sweet spot for me to have a nice smooth start, then redose and 6 hours of amazing intimate fun with my SO.  If you are worried 100 might be a bit low.. sure, go for 125, it just hits a bit harder at first. 200 is really a pretty big dose and will knock you off the world more then 100... personally I don't get a lot more enjoyment out of 200 compared to 100.  Just a note on the ""brown""-ness... color has NOT an indicator of purity. there is only 1 way to know if you have mdma and that's testing it.  if you have any more questions feel free to respond or message me personally if it's a bit more personal.  Have fun & stay safe !"
MDMA,3ay1uz,BE_chems,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:12:28 2015 UTC,"Hmm I'll let you in on a little ""tip""(just personal experience here..) When on MDMA you are pretty influential especially by your GF/BF, everything sounds like an amazing and great idea. Since you want to make a connection with him you'll want to get as much time as possible. So it's better to have a long and fun roll compared to a really hard one. Let him start with 125 and keep the .75 as a redose, that way he has the same dose but it will be longer and more fun. Just tell him you have stuff you want to talk about, but in a fun and happy way and he'll be all ears and talk talk, hug hug, talk talk and before you know it ... 6 hours have passed and you'll have had one of the best nights of your life"
MDMA,3ay1uz,BE_chems,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:57:08 2015 UTC,"Okay, that sounds good to me but maybe I should ask what type of experience he wants. Maybe he does just want to roll really hard."

MDMA,3ay1uz,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:21:03 2015 UTC,"You guys need to calculate your weight in kg. Then, for your starting dose, you can start with about 1.5 mg/kg (so 1.5 * your weight). Redose with .75 mg/kg after about 60-90 minutes.  Definitely communicate about what you guys each want out of the experience and your purpose for rolling. Then each of you take it upon yourselves to make it happen for your partner."

MDMA,3azarz,machiavellipac,2,Wed Jun 24 18:27:41 2015 UTC,"could be anxiety which can be brought on from using MDMA, especially in high doses or using it often for long periods of time. But if you haven't touched it in six months maybe you're just unfit. Or maybe you feel self concious about your fitness and are having panic attacks caused by your MDMA usage whilst you're out jogging. Who knows? There are a hell of of a lot of things that can cause shortness of breath. See a doctor if you're that worried about it."
MDMA,3azarz,Zazoot,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:29:35 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't correlate the two, however, if you're having chest pains its usually a good idea to visit a physician. If it persists and you're still worried you should visit one."
MDMA,3axfdb,MdMaThrowAwayed,3,Wed Jun 24 07:25:38 2015 UTC,"I think they should be fine.  More than likely any of the expansion was from the binder.  I think MDMA needs fairly high temperatures to really break down.  Edit: From a study on MDMA... ""The half-life for MDMA was 6.6 h and for MDA was 7.1 h under the extreme conditions of 90 degrees C and 6 M HCl.""  So since you didn't have it in acid, I'm guessing the heat alone wouldn't shorten the half life to this extent."

With an external temperature of 113F, the temp on the interior of the car is likely to exceed 160 F. This is no 90C but it is still significantly hot. Furthermore, per OP the pills were left in this condition for at LEAST several days (assuming they were in there the whole weekend, 5 days - although if only count the hottest parts of the day between 12pm and 4pm it would only amount to a cumulative 20 hours).   Considering this combination of (relatively) high heat over some 20 hours (rather than 6 and a half hours), what are you thoughts on the possibility of some at least minor breakdown in the compound?"

MDMA,3axhn2,fightclubdevil,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:11:38 2015 UTC,"Digital dreams is going to be unreal I can't wait!  Check out rollsafe.org for a complete supplements guide. Magnesium is good, the ALA is really good. Also get 5Htp, it's the precursor to serotonin and is good for restoring your brain (only take it no sooner than 24hrs after your last roll, I don't know exactly why maybe someone else can explain, it has something to do with serotonin syndrome? Dunno). I would skip the green tea extract and instead buy some good brand green tea for a fraction of the cost.  When taking 5HTP, drink the green tea (or pop a green tea extract pill) with it because the good green tea chemical works with the 5HTP to maximize brain re-fuckyeahness.   You don't HAVE to take any supplements at all, it's just way better for your body if you do.   Also I recommend a multi vitamin once a day for a few days before and after rolling. Hope I helped enjoy   TL;DR Magnesium, ALA, and green tea GOOD, ADD 5HTP and multivitamins to the mix"
MDMA,3axhn2,courtabee,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:48:44 2015 UTC,If you look at the roll safe guide it will tell you. But I think off the top of my head for ALA it's 1 every hour of the roll. Magnesium is 1 an hour before the roll and 1 two hours into the roll.   I'm not sure about the green tea. Probably an hour or so into the roll though.
MDMA,3ay7oa,RollYourBoat,2,Wed Jun 24 13:31:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know what would explain this but I understand where you're coming from because I've yet to experience a bad comedown, usually I get no comedown at all when my SO gets them pretty bad. Even when I rolled two days in a row (it was one-off thing and wouldn't recommend to anyone) I didn't notice any kind of come down the following days/weeks...  My SO is not so lucky and he gets pretty bad comedowns which sucks :/ He just needs much bigger breaks than I do and it gets tricky sometimes because he knows I want to roll and could roll but he can't so we both feel bad because I don't want to roll alone or force him to roll too soon.   But yeah, it'd be interesting to know why this happens."
MDMA,3ay7oa,suche1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:44:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds like our experiences are pretty similar then. I often find us having that disconnect too about breaks. He needs much longer breaks, but that's in part also to him having a much more addictive personality than myself. He and I have compared notes, and really the only lifestyle differences between us are that he is an everyday smoker of weed, where as I only ever smoke when rolling; and that he falls asleep long before I do at the end of a roll."
MDMA,3ay7oa,RandallWho,2,Wed Jun 24 14:07:06 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: is there a reason a person would cease to have bad comedowns/hangovers without any change in habits...\   The only thing i can really think of is that you get used to it so you know what to expect so it dosent seem as bad but thats all just a guess.   and has anyone else experienced this?   Yeah kind of.   i havent had a bad hang over in years and even then the last time had to do more with feelings and emotions that were brought due to interactions with people that night and not the drugs them selves.  Even last time when i did a lot of MDMA i didnt even have a bad hangover. Sure the next day i couldn't sleep and i then i was irritable and tired for a few days but no major hangover, no depresion, no saddness etc etc.   scientifically speaking some have a harder time than others   People are different. thats really what it comes down to."
MDMA,3ay7oa,SharpieBlueRed,2,Wed Jun 24 18:47:22 2015 UTC,"Same here. I get nothing other than maybe needing sleep bad at around 7pm the next day. I will usually get a pleasant afterglow and be really motivated and happy at work lol.   My partner though has a tough time. Feels super super tired the whole day, won't eat for at least 24 hours. Totally different. Usually never lasts even 24 hours, but still crazy as it is almost like I just roll less and less and not really come down ! haha"
MDMA,3ayp3z,Dalton87,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:52:54 2015 UTC,"Hey not sure if I'll be that much help but I went to Ibiza earlier this month and didn't have the problems you had or think you will have. In 6 nights we rolled 3 (well actually 4). Some you might already know but hope it helps.  Sankeys is nice, aggressive sound system downstairs (take earplugs, seriously if you value your ears take them as a precaution), with an open air roof and cinema to chill.  es Paradis, loads of (clean) cubicles, everyone seemed happy on the night. Security were sooo lax, I could have got in with a blank piece of paper.  Ushuaia, nice day time club/hotel with big nights. Toilets are massive, few cubicles but you shouldn't have a problem.  Amnesia, drugs seemed to be everywhere, it was a DnB night though and again loads of toilets and no one seemed to mind.  Again we didn't encounter security anywhere, maybe it was a bit early in the season though. Just buy beforehand and sneak in, this shouldn't be a problem in Ibiza - its easy to obtain (stay clear of the looky looky men).  Try Sankeys on a Sunday/Monday, Amnesia on a Tuesday, and whatever club you already want on a Wednesday.   Really though it should be about the music YOU like and only use MD to make the night better.   I hope just a little of that helps.  Edit: I think I may have concentrated on the security a little too much. It does all depend on the night/music to what people they attract but saying that: Sankeys was about the music, loud down and dirty but there was one or idiots off their bollocks which dampened it a bit. es Paradis was amazing but then again it was an old school night (even in/near San Antonio) Ushuaia full of pretentious dicks but again it was all about the music and a nice warm up (for Sankeys that night) Amnesia - everyone was great, lovely. Again though all about the music and we all embraced it."

Not only that, anecdotal evidence that MDMA-induced hyperthermia is worse; your neurones will take a severe oxidative beating."

MDMA is neurotoxic, so any time you take it you run the risk of doing permanent damage, especially if you take it the way OP has (rolling several days in a row and often with short breaks between them)."
MDMA,3aye5s,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:37:31 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I was worried about but since I'm feeling normal now I'm guessing there's no temporary damage? Any insight into how long it takes the brain to recover if no temporary damage is done/If its possible to avoid future hangovers if I've had bad ones in the past?

MDMA,3awuk0,potheadLOL,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:33:37 2015 UTC,The presser is indeed releasing new orange tesla's that are hard pressed but still relatively easy to split down the middle. They are not dark orange but a pinkish color and do not have noticeable specks like the original ones. But be ware there are some dark dark almost reddish ones that are definitely fake and they have specks.   Hope this helps.

MDMA,3awz6z,leavesthetrees,4,Wed Jun 24 04:20:50 2015 UTC,"How damaging is rolling on MDMA? Both qualitatively and quantitatively?   Honestly no one knows. The only research that has been done has been in rats and primates, and what has been accepted as harm reduction is just extrapolated from those studies and few other studies looking at the effects of both short term and long term users but still no actually research so we cant really messure the qualitative and quantitative effects of MDMA on humans.   how bad would it be to roll again in the next week or so?   Depends in how you talk to. Some people will tell you ""no never. you shouldn't do that. you will be abusing the drug"" the others will tell you to go for it but dont make a habit of it.  Me? well i am in the second camp. you have done your research and you seem to know what you are getting in to. So as long as you dont make a habit of rolling every weekend and do all the usu pre/post load stuff and take care of your self..go for it.  just be aware you may not roll as hard. Some people can roll at all other have no problem.  have fun and be safe."
MDMA,3awz6z,RandallWho,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:53:49 2015 UTC,"So because no actual research has been committed we still do not know the potential harmful effects of MDMA on the brain? Because the research I've seen goes back and forth and it's hard to form an opinion on it.  I'm a firm believer in respecting drugs and not abusing them especially MDMA. My family suffers from substance abuse and I have an addictive personality and I know that I have to limit myself.   Not only do I know how reckless it is to roll every weekend or abuse this drug, I simply do not want to roll all of the time for several reasons.   Supplements are not at my disposal because I'm currently in a foreign country. However I do have melatonin and St. John's Wort available. What other pre/post stuff should I follow?  Thanks for the insight."
MDMA,3awz6z,hashmon,2,Wed Jun 24 15:29:45 2015 UTC,"I've done it roughly weekly for close to ten years, and it's always been fantastic. MDMA is some great stuff, very benign. The ""toxicity"" line is fear-mongering bullshit. For a sober look at the studies into it, check out www.thedea.org."
MDMA,3awz6z,hashmon,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:14:39 2015 UTC,I've heard reports of it losing it magic for some. Has that happened to you?  Do you not feel any negative side effects?
MDMA,3awz6z,RandallWho,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:52:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely no negative side effects. Many positive ""side effects."" But I only take a normal dose, on the smaller side, actuallylike 80-100 mg's. I don't mix it with coke or alcohol, since I don't touch coke or alcohol. I use it as a psychedelic, and it's always been amazing. It has a way of pushing you along in life, as far as emotional maturation and what not. Once a week is an extremely rough estimate; right now I'm in a longer break, cause I used it kind if heavily when I got a really good new batch in a few months ago. You just feel it out, like hunger; right now I'm riding out some awesome rolls that ended a few weeks ago.  From what I can tell from reading people's stories online, most if not all of the people losing the magic really heavily abuse it; like they take a half gram at a time and party all night. If I did that I think I'd be kind of fucked up for a while, too. But instead I've let psychedelics, especially MDMA, show me a healthier and happier way to be- no caffeine, no alcohol, no sugary junk food, and in this paradigm it's been all good.   If you're really interested in MDMA I recommend the book ""Ecstasy: A Complete Guide,"" edited by Julie Holland. Also, the web site www.thedea.org has an excellent section objectively reviewing the studies into ""neurotoxicity."""
MDMA,3awz6z,dakuria,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:40:10 2015 UTC,"So because no actual research has been committed we still do not know the potential harmful effects of MDMA on the brain?   Yes, kind of. we can say that MDMA Nerotoxic and that it will damage the brain but we cant really say what that means ie what the physical manifestations will be and also we cant really say at what level or dose dose the damage occur and at what level is permanent.   I'm a firm believer in respecting drugs...I simply do not want to roll all of the time for several reasons.   Then you are a step ahead of a lot of people.   What other pre/post stuff should I follow?   Honestly? Idk. i dont use them, never have never will, the whole idea or pre/post loading is new to me.  and actually a lot of what is accepted as best practice is new to me.  Example: testing your mdma. This was never really possibly back when i started. so its really a pretty forgin concept to me esp to the level of which /r/mdma pushes it as harm reduction"
MDMA,3awz6z,dakuria,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:57:24 2015 UTC,"As for supplements, magnesium helps with jaw clenching. Alpha Lipoid Acid, Green Tea Extract, and Vitamin C helps with preventing the neurotoxicity of MDMA. If you can't access any of those, I'd say go on a healthy diet. Eat a lot of greens and fruits. I like making smoothies with fruits and vegetables.  Also, don't take the 5-HTP until the next day because serotonin syndrome is a possibility. Take the melatonin before bed to help you sleep (it is made from serotonin, and MDMA burns out most of your serotonin).  One last thing I'd recommend is to get a testing kit. You don't even know if you have MDMA. Look on eBay for a Marquis Testing Kit. Try to find a vendor that will ship it to you."
MDMA,3awz6z,YahooMailClient,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:19:52 2015 UTC,"Since I'm out of the country I currently don't have access to those but Vitamin C. I'm actually eating really healthy and I'm eating a ton of fruits and vegetables.   I don't have 5-HTP, but I have St. John's Wort available, would that work?"
MDMA,3awz6z,YahooMailClient,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:51:17 2015 UTC,"St. Johns Wort would definitely work in place of 5-HTP. I wouldn't sweat about this. As long as you don't roll every weekend, you'll be fine with minimal supplements and healthy eating. :)"
MDMA,3awz6z,berrygirl23,2,Thu Jun 25 16:33:45 2015 UTC,"You always hear about those who can no longer feel the magic because they did too much, and then you hear those that still feel great while doing it every two weeks.. This subreddit generally agrees on minimum 6-8 weeks break between rolls (and yes, supplements will help).  To be honest dude, I went through a period of irresponsible use a year ago and I don't feel ""damaged"" and my mental capacity hasn't decreased. It's just me though. It's your call to decide if whatever you're doing this week is worth the three hours of magic, but I promise you that magic won't be as strong. I usually succumb to peer pressure unfortunately and go ham, and if you do the same, just take care of yourself from now on. Yer head is important."

The browner ""sassafrass"" that you're referring to is usually MDA. I've always known MDA to have a root beer smell to it. It's slightly more neurotoxic than MDMA with a heavier body high. I've actually experienced worse comedowns with MDA.   3.) As far as the pressies you had back in the day, those are  gonna be hard to find. I'm a youngin' but I hear the best presses back then were various mixes of mdma, mda, ketamine, cocaine, caffeine and other substances. Do a little research on these drugs and their effects and then you may just be able to make your own capsules with the desired concoction ;)"
MDMA,3awha1,videodude316,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:47:32 2015 UTC,"MDMA should be MDMA.  Sass, is MDA, a close cousin of MDMA.  Molly is a term that has been adulterated by asshole drug dealers trying to pass off bullshit cathinones as MDMA.  Don't ever ask for molly, ask for MDMA."

MDMA,3axr2y,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:46:44 2015 UTC,"For first time, that would explain why you didn't roll. For second time, you did a lot trying to chase your roll. Probably the 125 mg was not enough (assuming you tested it). For 3rd time, that is difficult to explain.  Are you on any medications? What was your mindset? Did you preload on any supplements (e.g., 5-HTP, St John's Wort)? Had you eaten a big meal shortly before dropping? Did you parachute or just swallow?"
MDMA,3axr2y,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:06:45 2015 UTC,"No meds. Mindset was just ""let's just have fun"", so just kept trying to be overly positive about everything - you can try that sober too.  5-HTP for a couple of days before rolling (more than 12 hours before/after), rolaid 30ish minutes before, vitamin c 1 hr or 30 mins before, and then during.

But I'm getting them from a really close friend who always go with the same crew and they get it from one person who they really trust ? :P
MDMA,3avgs1,SSASERTPO,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:01:31 2015 UTC,"I've gotten stuff from trusted sources which ended up being PMA which is very dangerous.   If you care about your health, test it yourself."
MDMA,3avgs1,csandz,2,Wed Jun 24 02:42:54 2015 UTC,"LOL i definitely understand why you're worried, but you'll live! i'm also a tiny girl who raves quite often with my tiny girl friends. my first time, i expected my tolerance to be low, so i dropped 1/4 first and felt nothing when my friends started to feel it (they had taken larger doses), so i dropped another 1/4 and that's when i felt it. i was good off of 1/2, but my other small friend (she probably weighs 100 lbs, she's the tiniest) was also a first-timer that night and was only able to take 1/4 and was rolling pretty darn hard. my other tiny girl friend that rolled for the first time that night dropped 1/2 and kept complaining that she wasn't feeling it and was being all pouty and borderline throwing a tantrum so she dropped another 1/4 and was floored.. in her case, she was overthinking it; of course the roll wasn't gonna hit her, if she was anticipating it too much, despite my friends' telling her not to think about it and to just enjoy the event. so her ass thought she could handle more than she could and ended up being too floored to dance with the rest of us. it's a good thing people who have rolled before knew how to take care of her. so try not to be nervous about the roll (whether it be about feeling it or dying lol). just drop the pill, enjoy the good music and good company and let it surprise you. it could take anywhere from 15-45 minutes for it to hit you but it'll be awesome when it does, i promise. i also wanna add that your tolerance to other things doesn't necessarily determine your mdma tolerance. i know people that have low alcohol tolerance and high mdma tolerance and vice versa. i am such a lightweight when it comes to alcohol and a heavyweight when it comes to weed, but find myself somewhere in the middle with mdma and usually just drop 1/2-3/4 at raves. definitely just be careful and make sure you have people with you that know the drug and can take care of you in a worst case scenario. i hope this helps and that you enjoy your first experience with it! :-)"
MDMA,3avgs1,barlingbackbable,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:07:43 2015 UTC,Omg YAYYY I can go and just try to have a good time. I'm excited :P I weigh like 95lb ugh and I can't handle anything. I'm glad u brought the thing up about tolerance. I have no problem with weed now that I think about it woooo THANKS gonna go enjoy myself! I'll do what you did and start with 1/4 then maybe another if I really don't feel it

MDMA,3au7jj,trvplawdbeeno,3,Tue Jun 23 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"There won't be very much cross-tolerance, maybe a tiny bit due to 5HT down-regulation, but one won't significantly weaken the other.  It's almost universally recommended to do acid day 1 and molly day 2 however, because otherwise you run the risk of having a bad trip if you're in a low mood the next day from an MDMA hangover."

MDMA,3atud9,bomona,6,Tue Jun 23 13:38:37 2015 UTC,"First of all, happy birthday!  Second of all, I urge you to at least get a Marquis reagent and test it. Your health is worth far more than $20. The fact that it was purchased at a festival does not impact the likelihood of it being MDMA.  Third, no one can confidently say what your response will be. In my honest opinion, a lot of people here are hyper vigilant about dosing (I have been guilty of this myself at times), and I think individual physiology and metabolism probably affect the experience more than a 20% difference in dosage. I'd suggest you take ""some,"" (maybe 1/2 of it), and wait 90 minutes and reevaluate. If you want more, take more. If you're rolling your balls off, hold steady.  Cheers, man. Have fun with it. Be safe and test!!!"

It means it probably won't kill you, but you still don't know what it is.  Lots of things behave similar to MDMA.  Also, no one around here uses the term ""molly"" because that term can mean almost anything.  MDMA is the name of the molecule, so we use that to be absolutely cleat about what we are talking about.  I really urge you to get a testkit.  They are cheap and easy to use."
MDMA,3atud9,throwawayroller,5,Wed Jun 24 01:34:30 2015 UTC,I would go with something like 150mg. Dosages like 200mg are pretty strong even for experienced users.

Should I just stick to having it one day and then not bother with the other 2 days in that case?  I don't plan on doing this for first time trying it, but what is mixing weed and/or alcohol with it like? Is that a no go, or is it fine?"
MDMA,3atcyo,_huckleberryfinn,2,Tue Jun 23 22:08:48 2015 UTC,"if its your 1st time, & given that its actually real mdma, you should be fine with minimal - no comedown effects. this is not to say that you will be fine rolling for 3 days straight though. if this is your plan, i highly advise against this option, but then again even i have gone down this route. just know that doing this is not good for your health, & may cause lasting effects. it most likely wont, since it is your 1st time.. but its always better safe than sorry.       as for the weed, do you smoke on the regular? if so, this should be fine during a roll. might wana start off slow, but its definitely one of my favorite things to boost my roll, so to speak. if you dont smoke regularly, meaning, if youre not a potato chip munching, couch locked sleeping, stoner of a pot head like me, you probably might want to keep it REALLY low & slow on the intake. as for the alcohol, id say thats a no go. i hate drinking before a roll cus it makes me feel sick on the comeup & gets me blowing chunks in the toilet. drinking AFTER a roll though, now thats a different trip. i love it, i hate it, it hates me, makes me pee, but it is somewhat enjoyable.       if youre trying to have a great memorable time with the friends, id say roll only 1 day, 2 MAX MAX MAX. try not having more than 1-2 alcoholic drinks, but a little bud & a couple cigs should definitely help ease the roll. its gna be one hellavu weekend my friend :] enjoy &stay safe!"
MDMA,3atcyo,_huckleberryfinn,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:45:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think the plan was to ever do it 3 days back to back, but if we tried it once and really enjoyed it, a second time could have been possible.

The only way to know if you've got good shit is to use a test kit! In the UK though as mention £30-40 is the standard price.
MDMA,3atcyo,ben_da_gr8_1,2,Tue Jun 23 11:03:19 2015 UTC,"FYI a reagent test result will give you the same result regardless of the quality of the MDMA.. if both the shitty M and the good M are mostly MDMA, regardless of the quality they will both come back with a positive test for MDMA.

By the sounds of this there was an underlying cardiac issues. Combine that with dehydration and increased BP as a result of mdma's stimulant properties and if say that was it.

MDMA,3arvuh,n1ll0,4,Tue Jun 23 04:37:38 2015 UTC,"yeah redosing past probably 30 minutes or so is only going to extend the roll a little bit and/or increase the stimulant properties you are feeling. The intensity of the roll is generally determined by the initial dose, so youre description sounds about spot on for a quarter of an orange tesla. I actually did pretty much the same thing when i went out to a concert my buddies band was playing at (classic rock/blues genre music) and it was a blast, but I was only aiming for threshold effects and thats what I got with a quarter of one of those teslas."

Other then then that you really probably did to little to get any real effect.  100mg is just enough to really start to feel it but not really get in to. then the redose were really to small to feel much more then a little pick me up.  try doing what you did before (250mg) or try a 150/100 mg split.  That will probably give you more of what you are looking for.

If you would have taken a whole pill the first day you would have had a whole different experience. Wait 6 weeks to 3 months and try again and measure your dose and take around 150mg. Then, you should definitely feel the magic.  Edit:Just read a bit more, the alcohol and adderall shouldn't have made a difference at all those days. And if you were rolling, trust me, you would know.

You should be worried about it if you are having trouble regulating body temperature (hyperthermia), if you're shivering, if you feel you could faint, rapid heart rate, and heavy sweating.  This is when something more serious could be happening.  It doesn't sound like you're experiencing this.  For the come down just eat well, exercise (this does help), and maybe try taking some supplements like 5htp+EGCG+B6+Vit C  Another tip for next time...try pre-loading with supplements, it'll really ease the comedown period (even when you binge)"
MDMA,3aqy2i,LetMeGoogleThatFoYou,2,Tue Jun 23 05:43:23 2015 UTC,just don't pre-load with 5htp!!
MDMA,3aqy2i,rocketno40,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:44:10 2015 UTC,It makes the chances of you getting serotonin syndrome much more likely so I wouldn't take it for the few days before you roll.
MDMA,3aqy2i,oliviamaeae,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:42:35 2015 UTC,"Yea, what it does is makes the body create too much serotonin.  This may seem like it's a great idea but when theres way too much excess what happens is your serotonin receptors will become fatigued and actually shut down the uptake mechanism all together in an attempt to prevent damage to themselves.  This leaves a ton of serotonin just hanging out freely in the brain to oxidize and become toxic...this is what causes serotonin syndrome and why it is universally not recommended to take 5-htp during a roll.  Good thing is, the half life of 5htp is super super short (like 5 or so hrs), so you only have to discontinue taking it for around 20hrs before you plan to drop.  You can then get back on it 24hrs after your last dose."

MDMA,3apscu,hallothar15,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:24:36 2015 UTC,"idk if you can say its ALL visuals. i think its a lot more cevs than oevs, unless you start taking high doses. took 15mg orally &practically felt nothing until the end of 5 hours where i noticed my phone started looking slightly warped. i feel like if you want the visuals, you gotta take close to 20-25mg. feel free to correct me &chime in anybody, but if youre going for a visual flip, id recommend a 100ug candy flip. although be prepared cus thatll get you rolling &frying for sure w/the unicorns, colors, &the whole shibang. but if youre going nexus, just know that there is gna be a slight body load as others have described, but may be less of a load & headspace than other psychs like mushrooms or candy even. should be fun either way, ive nexus'd once towards the end of a roll &it was very relaxing w/gentle wave like vizooals ;]       edit: whats your dosage estimate for the trip? &if youve tried dmt/lsd, 2cb is gna be a walk in the park."
MDMA,3apscu,_huckleberryfinn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:18:33 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as you, I took a 17mg miffy and the only visuals I noticed was my phone screen looking a bit odd so I took another one 2 hours later so 34mg overall (if the they're really 17mg that is) and I felt a lot like I was on LSD mentally, like everything around me felt weird and not real but I never really got any oevs. I was at a festival so I never really closed my eyes so never noticed any cevs. my dose tomes were 6pm and 8pm and when I was on the 11pm bus home I was fully sober albeit on a massive depression downer I think I was on from 400mg MDMA I'd taken 3 days previous. I never noticed the sadness until I sobered up from the 2cb so I'm not sure if it was and MDMA comedown or that's how it feels coming down from 2cb..."
MDMA,3apscu,hallothar15,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:07:36 2015 UTC,"hahah, my experiences were with the miffys too. its unfortunate there arent any lab results (unless youve seen one?) w/exact dosages in those bunnies but my experience was just about the same. ive heard ppl raving about 2cb, but i have yet to see the hype. i did feel noticeably ""bummed"" during my whole experience as did my SO, but i thought this was due to the lack of psychedelic experience. maybe if i had double dropped them i wouldve had a visually better time?       btw, which color miffy did you have? mine was orange, but i did take half a white towards the end of a roll once that seemed very relaxing &enjoyable, although it could just be placebo. :p"
MDMA,3apscu,_huckleberryfinn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:16:08 2015 UTC,"I used the red ones :), I've not seen any test results but from the dark net they were advertised as 17mg so probably a bit less. I'm pretty sure I read somewhere different coloured miffys were different strengths though so I could be making that up  Yer same I've heard people raving about it to, I've tried it twice, first time was some purple mushrooms advertised as 10mg but I seen a lab results of 6mg and I only took one so nothing happened other than that phone thing we both mentioned. the 2nd time was those 2 miffys but 2 hours apart, I felt a lot different but didn't trip I had an amazing time with this though (not as much as I would of on mdma though). I've been too scared to double drop as I'm new to the drug but next time I'm going to double drop and see what happens. well that or nexus flip I'm not sure yet  I've done LSD twice before and the only similarities I found was the phone thing happening on both and when under the influence of either real life didn't feel real  I did feel pretty relaxed when on the 2cb too, I was at a dance festival and didn't really want to dance much I just wanted to stand there and admire. 2cb made me happy as well, I couldn't get the smile off my face whereas LSD didn't have that effect.  Next time is my last time trying it if nothing much happens again"
MDMA,3apscu,amazingsil,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:19:34 2015 UTC,"thanks for that man, dont really have a set plan but i was thinking of 140mg mdma then 18-20 mg 2cb 2 hours later (If just on mdma i take 160+85 @90 minutes)  Im a bit apprehensive about candy flipping and im not sure why, when i done lsd (only 2 times) i only took 100ug and was manageable but im a bit worried about what it would be like in a gig setting. I was leaning towards 2 cb first as its a bit of an easier trip?  Any advice?  Edit: at dose of 18-20 mg 2cb will i be feeling any trippy psychedelic effects or mainly visuals?"
MDMA,3apscu,RandallWho,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:18:54 2015 UTC,"i feel like that should be a solid trip, if the dosage is weighed out then i think it will be very nice w/the mdma. shouldnt be too overwhelmingly 'flippy' but should definitely add a more colorful, wavy visual to your roll       stay hydrated, &enjoy the gig!"

MDMA,3apscu,RandallWho,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:48:53 2015 UTC,"2c-b is just easier to manage in general, i feel like it's easier to get overstimulated on LSD, so if you've only done LSD twice i'd suggest starting out with a nexus flip in a concert setting.   20mg personally gives me nice visuals, and just a tiny headspace change. I also personally took 100mg mdma + 50, but I'm on the smaller side as well."
MDMA,3apscu,RandallWho,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:30:55 2015 UTC,"Cool thanks man, did u find any worse of a come down from residing mdma aswell as 2cb?"
MDMA,3apscu,amazingsil,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:11:26 2015 UTC,usually for me any type of flipping has me doing the psychedelic first followed by the pill after i am done peaking or i take the psychedelic on the tail end of the roll as breather but with 2CB i always take it towards the end of my roll or right around my re-dose.  IMO snorting it gives you a better effect the ingesting it the body high was / is insane.
MDMA,3apscu,amazingsil,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:45:41 2015 UTC,"cool thanks man, is it very different to just an mdma only trip?"
MDMA,3apscu,amazingsil,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:20:39 2015 UTC,For me yes.  When i did 2CB itself i got very little of the empathy or the euphoria or the speediness but the heightened sense were AMAZING like unbelievable.   I kid you not the desert breeze would blow and  my body would orgasm.   So major sensory enhancement with out the mindfuck.  when i had it with mdma it keep all the yummyness of the roll but the sense were kicked in to hyperdrive.  I cant wait to do it again.
MDMA,3apscu,ThePsychonaut420,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:39:28 2015 UTC,brilliant so the heightened senses you got on 2cb only were there when you took 2cb with mdma?

Also for me magic has always been more then the drugs, there are just part of it, but they arent going to cause the magic. go to shitty party with shitty people and no amount of drugs will give you a that magic feeling but go to a great party with good people and you dont even need the drugs to feel the magic...  anyways getting off my soap box now."

The difference isnt in the effects of mdma but just in what i expect now and what i expected then. When the mdma hit me first few times trying i,t i just couldnt belive how perfect you can feel with just one little pill and i was so amazed by the effects i used to say mdma is a just whole other world. And it was...first few times, until i learned what it will feel like. Effects are still the same but i now just know what to expect and what its going to be like whereas first time on mdma i kept touching my face whole night cause it was so different and magical. I think that is what people want to say when they say magic is gone."
MDMA,3aqdu2,sarklo,2,Tue Jun 23 16:05:12 2015 UTC,"I totally agree.  the way i described it once was its like a high end sports car, when you first get it AMAZING, then you drive it more and only Amazing and then you drive it more and its just amazing but thats because you know it. you know how it handles and what it can do. its familiar and comfortable but still fun.  but its also why i tell people to stop trying to chase the first few highs.

You can try the EZtest purity test, however be aware that you have to use a pretty accurate scale (measures to the milligram - .001g - if i recall correctly), AND the test is only semi-quantitative anyways, i.e. you will really only be getting an estimate still.

MDMA,3aoof4,machmezie0731,5,Mon Jun 22 06:29:41 2015 UTC,"There's not much you can do now except for stay hydrated, get into a happy mindset, and wait it out.   However it's very frustrating seeing person after person ignoring all of the helpful information and advice this sub offers and go their own route, then come back crying when they have a terrible trip because they didn't even measure out how much they were ingesting or even test what they were ingesting because they think that it's a good idea  to trust their dealer rather than pay $20 for a test kit. Next time actually measure out what you ingest and if you aren't feeling it after a while DON'T KEEP TAKING MORE. This is how people injure themselves. I feel bad using a harsh tone on such a wonderful, loving subreddit, but sometimes it is necessary to get the message across."
MDMA,3aoof4,thecoon32,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:14:49 2015 UTC,"Well, the advice is not very clear. Some say ""take only half, and if you don't feel anything after an hour and a half, drop the other half"". Well that can be really shitty advice if the thing is 250mg and you're unexperienced, even if it's tested pure."
MDMA,3aoof4,Emmalucidify,2,Mon Jun 22 18:55:57 2015 UTC,Sounds like whatever you took wasn't MDMA. Did you test it before taking it?

MDMA,3aovz8,mdmaQuestz,2,Mon Jun 22 08:22:17 2015 UTC,"mdma does enhance your hearing to a certain degree so i wouldnt worry about things sounding a bit ""echo-ey"" :p as for all those euro pills you mentioned, i dont think they were all above 200-250. theyre advertised this way but more than likely will be in the 160-200 range. lab tests will confirm this evertime, so when you take half a press, it could in fact be anywhere from 80-100mgs, with the exception of the FEW presses that were known to have outrageous spreads. ie, ups' had a 160-275 range or something. crazy.      was the molly tested? if so, then i believe its the dosage. you should try a 100mgs instead of 130-150, then redose again later if its not enough. i feel that 100 is a sweet spot for me to feel it enough to be energetic &more ""awake"" than taking a high dose. that usually leads me to being floored &couch locked the fuck up for a while cus my bodys being flooded w/too much sassy goodness.       lastly, this is not a pharmecutical drug. its not regulated no matter how great these european super labs are. the purity of mdma differs vastly from pill to pill, &from cook to cook. do we really think that all mdma is gna be 100% (or 84 for the sticklers) pure? of course not. so when they arent, what chemicals & byproducts are left in the cook? nobody seems to be able to give me a decent answer, but if you think about it logically, there must be something leftover when your mdma isnt ""pure"". for example, original bitcoins were mdma, but many had been tested to have leftover byproducts such as mddma & mdp2p. these chemicals may or may not affect your overall roll to make you feel better, or worse. just my 2¢"

And yes first time hearing my voice in extreme echo-ey with some effects, was kinda scary x)  I guess i was rolling to much of these euro (NL) press and they were too much strong so i got speedy effect because of it, and these new Yellow Rolls Royce 2.0 are not from the same pressers so they just say its 250mg and i guess 190or something.  I hate this mg in pills i everytime i don't have idea how much exactly i take but in capsule its too mellow and slow to get the same high i guess i should take over 200mg, or snort it i guess.

MDMA,3aovz8,ThePsychonaut420,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:55:10 2015 UTC,Different combos of MDMA and MDA can give greatly varying effects. Add in a bit of amphetamine (reagent tests won't tell you the ratio) and they can be very buzzy and energetic.   I've taken the purest Mdma possible before and it's a highly different roll than a lot of the press pills.

IMO it all depends on A) how much you do B) your body/brain chemistry and C) also what type of high are you looking for.  In addition to the standard harm reduction guidelines line about rolling multiple nights a lot of people on /r/mdma dont roll multiple nights because they dont roll as hard or dont feel the ""happy"" effects of mdma or you may have to take more to get the same effect.  Same with re-dosing.  anyways it really comes down to the individual.

MDMA,3aqklf,mdmazinggg,0,Tue Jun 23 00:56:08 2015 UTC,This is because you depleted your serotonin (and probably also some of your dopamine) the first night. 5-htp is a precursor to serotonin and can replenish your levels if you take it after your roll. However you should not be rolling that often. I usually wait 1-3 months between rolls so that my serotonin levels replenish. Maybe try a different drug the next day or just drink.

I would agree with /u/you-is-beautiful, take 140mg and redose a little bit later. I'm very similar to your height and weight, and I took 140mg for my first time and I thought it was absolutely perfect. I would recommend about a 60mg redose an hour in. It won't necessarily increase the effects (maybe a tiny bit), but it will make them last longer. About 45 minutes in, once the first dose has hit, you will be very glad you have the redose haha. Make sure you only redose once!  Don't forget to take some supplements beforehand, and have fun!

I unfortunately think I have burned out some of my serotonin axons associated with the drug. It doesn't work on me anymore. I just switched to using psychedelics and other things like K and a little blow every now and then :). Mostly clean LSD. I'll probably never roll again but I enjoy doing acid and other things much more than I did rolling. It depends on the person I guess but psychedelics rebirthed my love for going out to shows and festies again and it's feels more genuine. It's just nice to not have to do molly to feel the ""magic."" I was a very heavy user and my situation might be different but I feel like you can maybe relate a little bit. I wouldn't go straight to these substances just yet. I would first focus on things that will heal your brain. Exercise and eating healthy!!! Hopefully this was of some insight!"
MDMA,3altl9,steezyneezy,2,Sun Jun 21 15:13:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I've only tried psychedelics about 3-4 times (LSD and mushrooms twice). First try of LSD was fantastic for me but the shrooms made me a little too overwhelmed, maybe i took too many but my train of thought had completely gone and I felt about 5 years old again, just discovering the world, so it was neither a positive nor negative trip, everything just seemed so big and it scared me a little and i couldn't talk on it for some reason. I do enjoy rolling though as I still feel ""normal"" (if that makes sense) rather than how alcohol and psychedelics make me act differently with different thoughts/views, especially at a festival where I still want my common knowledge/train of thought to keep me safe. I definitely will stick to the healthy eating and exercise before i go though, thanks a lot :)"
MDMA,3altl9,steezyneezy,2,Sun Jun 21 15:39:22 2015 UTC,"Shrooms were honestly the reason I got my life back from it. If you ever have an experienced friend who you feel comfortable tripping with, I definitely would suggest trying again in the future, low dosage of course! Psilocybin can actually create new brain cells and I felt like they repaired my brain. Anyways, I wouldn't roll if you think you're going to feel like that. You'll have a strong temptation to do it at a festival. I would look at the supplement guide on this subreddit and stack up on all the supplements just in case you do roll! Don't feel like you have to substitute mdma with another drug at a festival because that could lead to an uncomfortable experience. Just enjoy yourself and if you do roll, don't do a lot!

MDMA,3almc6,rickytannRUSH,6,Sun Jun 21 14:06:28 2015 UTC,"We can pretty much end this thread right here.  If you really sound like you didnt get MDMA esp after taking 7 pills and describing the way you feel you should of been WAY more fucked up esp for your first time.  My advice hang around and do some research. Read the side bar. Ask some questions and learn a little.   1)   Most e-hangovers last 3-7 days and the effects vary from person to person but i really dont think you had MDMA or it was low quality or low quantity.   2)   Yes. And if you do you research and make sure you are getting MDMA you will be able to have that experience but MUCH better.    2a)   Common harm reduction says no more then once every three months but most people will go through periods where they roll once a month for a few month then take a break. When party season starts for me i will roll once a month for 4-6 months then take break for a few months.   I don't want to mess up my brain too much   If you are worried about that and as long as you follow the guidelines for harm reduction (read the side bar) you shouldn't really have to worry about that.   Is this normal?   Yes, it can be. Learn to enjoy it."

Also try searching events at facebook, those are usually events with not much people ""going"" and such events probably have words techno,tech,house and other in the name of event. And i would look for events thats name look like this ex.(TECHNIGHTS w/""artist name"" 27th june 2015 at ""club name"") or similar, but do not necessary need to look like this.

Reddit: Subscribe to the subreddit or your preferred genres and ask about what is going on in your area.  Events: When you find an event, GO! Talk to people, be PLUR, make friends, give out lollipops or gum to people you bump into. Be kind to others and kindness shall find you.    This is basically what I did about 6 months ago.

MDMA,3alyhk,Mikelemod,2,Sun Jun 21 15:01:41 2015 UTC,"Looks like you're the one who's lucky here and not them being unfortunate. 700 mg of mdma is a fucking ridiculous amount. Even half of that is still a lot to take in one evening, and can lead to the symptoms you described.   Normal harm reduction organizations advice to take 1-1.5, sometimes 1-2 times your bodyweight (kgs) of mdma in mgs. You do the math."
MDMA,3ammbc,4fadruglover,3,Sun Jun 21 18:39:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely give yourself a break on day 2. Maybe 4-FA day 1 and you can save the MDMA for day 3, give yourself something to keep looking forward to. I rolled 3 days in a row before and it really takes a toll, not worth it imo. Especially by day 3 your brain just has nothing left, don't be surprised if you start malfunctioning. If you do decide to go with 3 days in a row you better have a shit load of benzos and weed for the week that follows, and that's a whole other problem.  Just ask yourself is 5-10 extra hrs of fun worth 1 or possibly more weeks of suffering and misery?"

MDMA,3ammbc,loudpackballin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:43:50 2015 UTC,Yeah that sounds fine as long as you don't make it a habit. The 4-FA doesn't seem near as damaging from what I've read.
MDMA,3ammbc,loudpackballin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:46:03 2015 UTC,"4-fa gives little to no comedown for most and depletes little serotonin. What do you recommend (drug) if not rolling 2 days?   And if not mdma 2 days, what about 4-fa 2 days (in higher dosages such as 130-150mg)"
MDMA,3ammbc,likeasomebooody,3,Sun Jun 21 19:33:38 2015 UTC,LSD. Ketamine. MXE. 2C-B. Nitrous Oxide. Marijuana.  Plenty of good festival drugs out there.

MDMA,3ammbc,guruofknowledgelel,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:47:10 2015 UTC,"4-fa is still a serotonin releaser. However small, it still downregulates 5-ht system. Although it may not be neurotoxic, it still will cause cross tolerance.  As will LSD.  Take LSD the day before rolling, and you'll be disappointed. Take it after you might be feeling a little too dark.  There's no easy way around it. Even if you take adderall, there's a dopamine cross tolerance.  Either up your doses and deal with it, or search for substances that effect different systems.  Perhaps: Xanax, MDMA, Ketamine or Tramadol, MDMA, LSD + Ketamine.  I wouldn't smack your brain with two rolls and 4-fa. I did 4-fa every couple weeks and it DEFINITELY effected my MDMA experience negatively."

MDMA,3al3z2,csandz,0,Tue Jun 23 21:30:54 2015 UTC,Alcohol is a depressant. Mdma is a stimulant? It's like flooring the accelerator while pressing the brake pedal at the same time. Not all drugs play nice with each other. You'll be fine but it's a waste
MDMA,3akfpl,HeyItsFudge,6,Sun Jun 21 01:57:53 2015 UTC,"Don't do it. wait at least 6-8 weeks before you roll again. Your brain needs that time to recuperate and get your serotonin levels back to normal otherwise doing it too often can have scary consequences. I'm speaking from my own experience as I was exactly the same as you, didn't like drinking and thought this was a safer option, only to realise I was doing it way too often, and I started to see changes in myself, lack of interest in my usual hobbies, couldn't enjoy things without the mdma, loss of general happy wellbeing, etc.   Check out Erowid.org too, that'll give you safe and reliable info on mdma (and other drugs). Stay safe :)  EDIT: just found http://www.rollsafe.org/ - another one for info :)"

Plus your setting and mentality plays a crucial role in your roll, because MDMA only enhances from there. If you're just chilling and not really doing much else, dont expect yourself to go balls deep  Are you on any SSRIs?  Pressed pill is the same thing as MDMA (molly). Test it.

Given that almost nothing happened I feel like not very much serotonin could have been released. Would that be an incorrect assumption?"

MDMA,3aj0as,RUSTYREX25,8,Sat Jun 20 17:39:57 2015 UTC,"Not particularly my cup of tea, but I definitely understand why people go. EDC's grandiose, over-the-top production with a myriad of mainstream artists is why most everyone goes. Although, I don't understand why some commenters feel the need to insult music others clearly enjoy."
MDMA,3aj0as,osiiriis,4,Sat Jun 20 20:06:23 2015 UTC,Because if you didn't experience Detroit warehouse raves in the 90s then you're a fuccboi who shouldn't ever roll or dance. /s
MDMA,3aj0as,r3vv,6,Sun Jun 21 02:55:47 2015 UTC,"I turned it off after I head someone yell ""everybody fucking jump"" and then there was some twangy buzzy noise with no bass in it. The thing is though the main stage at EDC is pretty shit in general, they have a few good artists up there but even then it's not Above & Beyond can give you a proper experience with only 1 hour.   The trance stage, and deep house/techno stages are where its at. Not sure if they have a hard trance stage again but that's usually pretty amazing. The night they have some DnB and dubstep over in the basspod is a lot of fun too.   It's still the most amazing festival I've been to, though looking at the livefeed it looks like 100% creepy bros now which makes me want to hold on to my amazing memories and not return to have them ruined."
MDMA,3aj0as,omgredditgotme,2,Sat Jun 20 20:15:42 2015 UTC,"I second this. The main stage is more for the mainstream music lovers (big room and big names). I love the Neon Garden stage. Great music and awesome vibes. I spent more than half of my 2 days at EDCO at Neon Garden. I met some awesome fucking people. I remember this huge guy asking to put me on his shoulders! I'm a 6'3"" 220 lb male. If I wasn't coming up so hard,I may have done it too!"

MDMA,3aj0as,GhostlyFireCunt,3,Sat Jun 20 21:50:54 2015 UTC,"I LOVE EDC. Even though I chose not to go the past two years because of the insanely inflation cost increases (I can afford it 3x over but I just don't want to spend that much) I still love it and plan to go next year possibly.    I was watching the feed last night and it was...boring. I don't know why but regardless of who was playing it just felt all over the place with camera angles, cut aways, and the overall vibe was off. Random flashes to people in the crowd for barely 3 seconds then back to the Djs for 5 seconds then flash to some hot girl for 2 seconds then flash to the (shitty) gogo dances then cut away to either one of the carny rides or some other weird montage of hot girls dancing.   I've always enjoyed the podcasts they release post-EDC for certain artists sets. But I don't think EDC transfers to livestream well. I  feel like with EDC you have to be there. But then again I feel the same with most livestreams of massives, I don't understand the point. Not many artists are fun to watch since most just DJ or wave their hands. Maybe it's just better to stick to audio only?"

MDMA,3aj0as,GhostlyFireCunt,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:11:11 2015 UTC,How much is an EDC ticket?
MDMA,3aj0as,disposable_UK,3,Sat Jun 20 23:42:29 2015 UTC,"Last I saw if you're lucky to get a early bird ticket it's $199 plus tax. I can't remember if they stopped doing that or what but I think it's around $230/250 now for three days.  There used to be priced tiers but I believe they just have it at a set price now. There's also the transportation dilemma for those that are flying in to Vegas. Insomniac offers a shuttle pass (which I've heard over the years has really degraded badly in transportation times and quality) which I think is around $30/40. So your other options are rent a car or get cabs (which cabbies cheat a lot of EDC goers).    But that's not the killer. The nail in the coffin is staying there for the three days. Since Vegas declared that there would be an 'EDC Week' the week of EDC which is celebrated with tons of pool parties and club events. But in turn, the 'EDC Week' brings up the costs of hotels, shuttles, taxis, and just other things that can be fluctuated. So unless you're booking your room a year in advance (which some hotels have a limit on how far you can book ahead or will black out certain dates or even already have the price raised for certain dates) you're looking at a enormous chunk out.   Then there's eating for while you're there which can get pricey in itself especially since besides shitty fast food all the places you might actually get nourishment from cost a pretty penny.  I'm not exactly an EDC veteran but I've been going long enough to see the wave of EDM popularity and mainstream flood EDC and inflate the prices on not just EDC but the surrounding area itself.   Don't get me wrong, I love Insomniac and their events. I really do love EDC. But since I've been going long enough to see the price increase, I feel sorta I dunno... I'm a semi-frugal girl so I don't like spending a huge amount even if I'm well above the means for it. There's A LOT of ways to do EDC on the cheap but (can be) at the sacrifice of comfort and health."
MDMA,3aj0as,GhostlyFireCunt,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:11:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much, that's interesting to know.  Dunno why I didn't think of this before but I didn't realise it's not a camping festival... just kinda assumed it was, so hadn't thought of hotel prices too.  I guess we're lucky here in the UK. It's such a small country you can drive pretty much everywhere really easily and quite quickly... although our petrol prices are sky high.   Thanks again :)"
MDMA,3aj0as,disposable_UK,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:19:30 2015 UTC,You're welcome! EDC LV is convenient for the surrounding states but it's such a big massive that people come from all over. It really is a one of a kind massive and worth attending once. But it really is something you have to plan in advance for. It used to be something you can go to last minute but that was back in 2011/2012.

MDMA,3ahois,phazshifter11,8,Sat Jun 20 16:27:41 2015 UTC,"I feel like alcohol would hamper the experience, considering alcohol is mostly a depressant. I have never tried it myself for this reason. A friend of mine who drank a couple of beers before and also during an experience didn't seem to have quite as great a time as me (very anecdotal!)  Once I come up on mdma it feels so wonderfully clean, and I wouldn't want to potentially ""ruin"" it with any other substance."
MDMA,3ahois,jfassbander28,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:19:22 2015 UTC,"Yeh know what you mean. I just have a couple of bottles, nothing at all heavy, just helps relax myself before the come up"
MDMA,3aiscl,dakuria,5,Sat Jun 20 16:26:56 2015 UTC,"If you liked the dose at 100 I would stick with that.  More is unlikely to be better and is much more neurotoxic.  Tome, MDMA is more of a binary thing.  You are ""there"" or you are not.  You can do a 50 mg redose at about an hour to extend it.  Only do 1 redose.    And try to wait 2-3 months between rolls."
MDMA,3aiscl,bunnydoctor,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:43:19 2015 UTC,"All right, good idea, I'll stick with 100mg. Why not redose at 75-100mg? 50mg doesn't seem like much."
MDMA,3aiscl,bunnydoctor,4,Sat Jun 20 16:46:29 2015 UTC,Because the first dose dumps a good chunk of your serotonin out.  You don't need as much for the second dose to extend it a bit.  Conventional wisdom is your redose is 1/2 of your original dose.  It won't make your roll any stronger but it will make it last longer.  I am usually at about 6-7 hours doing a 1/2 redose.
MDMA,3aiscl,BobbleheadDoll,2,Sat Jun 20 16:50:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll do that then. I appreciate your advice."
MDMA,3aiscl,BobbleheadDoll,3,Sat Jun 20 16:51:49 2015 UTC,"Also, account for your weight. If you have already rolled before, you could bump your starting dose from 1.5 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg or 2.25 mg/kg (very strong). But I agree, if 100 mg was a good starting dose for you, then you should be fine with starting that again. Were you totally blitzed?"
MDMA,3aiscl,BobbleheadDoll,2,Sat Jun 20 17:02:34 2015 UTC,"I weigh 64 kg, so I suppose I can try 125mg if I want to.  I definitely wasn't blitzed, but I was pretty high and I felt the happiest I've ever felt in my entire life. I don't know about the purity of it, but I know that the molly I'm getting soon will be very potent.  I don't really want to get high to the point of losing my mind. So do you think I should start with 100mg or 125mg?"
MDMA,3aiscl,threeinchesoffury,5,Sat Jun 20 17:06:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can safely go anywhere between 100 mg and 130 mg. 144 mg would be 2.25 mg/kg.   I don't know about the purity of it, but I know that the molly I'm getting soon will be very potent.   Have you tested it a) for the presence of MDMA and b) for the purity of the MDMA? If not, you should not take it by word of mouth. You should test it.   I don't really want to get high to the point of losing my mind. So do you think I should start with 100mg or 125mg?   I have not, myself, experimented with different levels of MDMA, so I cannot safely tell you the correct answer. If you already felt okay at about 1.5 mg/kg, I think it would be safe to bump it to somewhere between 1.5 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg. It's up to you. I like to roll intensely, so if it were me, I would try the 125 mg."
MDMA,3aiscl,threeinchesoffury,3,Sat Jun 20 17:17:52 2015 UTC,"I am getting it from a very reliable source that can't be discussed here, and I also have a Marquis Reagent Kit ready for testing it, so I think it should be fine.  And thanks, I might go between 100 and 125, just because I'm still a beginner to MDMA and I'd like to do this in babysteps."
MDMA,3aiscl,threeinchesoffury,3,Sat Jun 20 17:27:17 2015 UTC,"and I also have a Marquis Reagent Kit ready for testing it, so I think it should be fine.   Awesome!   and I also have a Marquis Reagent Kit ready for testing it, so I think it should be fine.   Sounds like a good plan. Just discover your favorite dose. :D"
MDMA,3aiscl,BobbleheadDoll,3,Sat Jun 20 20:05:13 2015 UTC,"200 is getting into pro level doses, friendo, especially for only doing it one time.  You want to use the absolute minimum dosage you can to get the roll effect.  At most I'd say 140mg would good, even a tad high.  Then a smaller redose of half whatever you take about 90 minutes in."
MDMA,3aiscl,threeinchesoffury,2,Sat Jun 20 17:04:40 2015 UTC,Yeah probably. I'm debating starting with 100mg or 125mg.
MDMA,3aiscl,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:07:28 2015 UTC,How much do you weigh? 125 should be fine though. It's the pretty much accepted standard dose.

Regardless of that though, I think you're doing it 2 often. You've gone from never doing it before to doing it 5 times in 10 weeks (average of once a fortnight). I've done it maybe 6 times in the last 2 years and each one has been really special. It's only natural for your most recent roll to be crap, you only gave it 4 days! I mean at festival a few years back I did it heavily 3 nights in a row, was barely feeling it by the last day, was totally desensitised to it."

The last festival I was at I  at did 3 days in a row. I had to up the dose each day but it still worked. Just don't make a habit of it and take a longer than usual break afterwords. If you're typically prone to stronger negative effects you'll likely notice this in the week following.  Keep on top of your hydration and make sure to eat and rest between days"

I rolled 3 days in row a week ago, and I'm still feeling the negative effects from it. Life has really been depressing this past week because of my reckless use. I didn't supplement properly, I didn't hydrate properly, and I just plain didn't think. It seemed like an ok idea at first, but man, this week has been something I'd never wish on anybody because the comedown has been so bad.  I love MDMA and what it does for people, but just don't make the same mistake I did!"
MDMA,3ajprk,praggygrunt,3,Sat Jun 20 21:55:05 2015 UTC,Supplementation and hydration aren't going to make you feel any better after putting you brain though that.

MDMA,3ajprk,praggygrunt,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:36:56 2015 UTC,Just didn't want anyone to get the wrong idea and think you could somehow safely roll 3 days in a row with supplementation. As it is most people already think supplementing (though very important) does more for you than it actually does.

I meant to calculate the mg/kg for yourself and try to get a dose between 1.5 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg. Then take half. This should be the recommendation for most people."

Since it's our first time trying together (my 2nd time, tried a very small dose last week to test and reassure) she chose the safe option of staying home since she has no clue how she'll be.  Going to dose as soon as she's home and throw on a movie to keep distracted during come-up, then redose at around 80 minutes after the first.  This will be my first 'real' dose. Last dose was 80-100mg. Mollymeasure puts me at 360mg with booster."
MDMA,3agike,RUSTYREX25,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:18:18 2015 UTC,"Since it's our first time trying together (my 2nd time, tried a very small dose last week to test and reassure) she chose the safe option of staying home since she has no clue how she'll be.   This is the better option because you guys will really be able to let loose.   Going to dose as soon as she's home and throw on a movie to keep distracted during come-up   This is actually one of my favorite parts about rolling--the come up. It can be a little uneasy if it's your first time experiencing the come up, however. While I think having something there to distract you is good, I would suggest putting on some slow, chill music. The best place to start is with your guys' favorite music. You will start to notice how everything sounds a little bit different. At the same time, you guys should just have normal conversations. Even the come up is a great experience together! You could have the movie on in the background, if you want, while chatting and listening to music.  I never knew about molly measure, but it seems legit. I just plugged in my weight just for fun (without first time) and got 214 mg starter + 107 mg redose 45 min to 90 mins later. That's about 2.25 mg/kg, which already seems pretty high to me.  Anyway, to prepare for your night, I suggest you guys make sure you have water nearby and sip on water every now and then (you don't want to drink too much). You guys should also take some Vitamin C (or other antioxidants) or drink OJ prior to and after rolling. During is okay, too. It will taste pretty awesome. Also, it is important not to overheat; try to maintain your normal body temperature if you can.  There are other things to do, but you should just go with the flow. Here are few suggestions. You should get some lotion handy, take a shower or bath together (don't stay in too long because of body temperature), get a music playlist to chill out to and a music playlist that has strong beats that you can dance to (depends on your preference). If you like Pink Floyd: fucking phenomenal while rolling, especially Comfortably Numb.  Really, just play everything by ear and just do what you want when you want. Touch each other. Hold each other. Sit under the same, soft blanket. Kiss each other. Hug each other. And just be present. It will be a good night!"
MDMA,3agike,shitlord_traplord,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:36:01 2015 UTC,"We're just tossing a movie on to distract if she gets worried and rolling with it. Starting with cuddling and a movie sounds great, and from there we'll do whatever we do. We're in our air conditioned house, so water and temp isn't really an issue.  I did lower the dose from mollymeasure to 1.5mg/kg started and then .5mg/kg booster. Mollymeasure recommends that for the 'first time' option but then kicks it up to 2.25 total after, while most other sources I've seen generally recommend sticking to the 1.5/.5"

MDMA,3agmcs,Shorewahtevs,2,Sat Jun 20 00:09:33 2015 UTC,"I've only had it once, after the first time. I don't throw up anymore though."
MDMA,3agmcs,Multatuli123,2,Sat Jun 20 10:57:09 2015 UTC,Yes! I've done it a few times when I was first starting out with rolling. It starts with me having this terrible hiccup and having to burp at the same time. It progressively gets worse on the comedown and no matter how hard I try I can't burp (I have a really hard time burping sober too though). Eventually all of a sudden I'd burp and then BOOM out came watered down vomit. It feels so much better after it happens but I just hate being that person.  You may hate hearing this but shaving off some of the initial dosage helped me. I don't like being crazy out if it anyway. Also not to be weird but farting or pooping helps SO much. I haven't thrown up in a while because I found I can beat the nausea by relieving the gas through the other end lol. Powerade/gatorade definitely helps too if it's around. Good luck I hope it gets better for you!
MDMA,3agmcs,lactatesfruitpunch,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:04:43 2015 UTC,"I'm usually at festivals when I'm rolling so trying to go poop is just something I don't want to do because of the port-a-potties. Also, if my burps are a gamble I don't want my farts to be a gamble either, if you get what I'm saying, lol. I might shave down my dosages to thirds or quarters even. I always try to have some type of sports drink available either in my car or house and that usually does help. Thanks a lot for the information!"
MDMA,3agmcs,rgent006,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:11:35 2015 UTC,"I'll post my experience here: I've rolled 4 times so far in my life. My first experience, I took one purple magnet in halves, ate about 6 hours prior. Moderate amount of water throughout the night and maybe a mouthful during the comedown. I didn't throw up this time, but I had major cramps in forearms, calves, and in my abdominal area. I felt like my stomach was going to turns itself over, but I controlled my breathing and pulled through until I got some food in my stomach and drank some powerade and everything was better.  Second roll, I took one and a half green heinekens in halves as well. About an hour apart from each half. This time about 30 minutes after my third drop, I blacked out a few times for a minute or two while dancing, and threw up maybe ten minutes from the first blackout. I want to look at this as probably drinking too much water despite sweating, but I didn't pee at all since I dropped. Also, it may have been the amount I dropped throughout the night. After I threw up I tried to take small gulps of water, but after ten minutes from drinking I would throw it all up again, despite trying to tell myself not to throw up and controlling my breathing. I also think it maybe the fact I didn't eat much that day and it was about 6 hours prior to the first drop.  Third, I dropped halves of one orange legomen at around 1 hour apart from each other. A little time after the second drop I started to feel gurgly in my stomach and needed to burp (which was similar to the feeling when I threw up on the green heinekens), but I told myself it was nothing and held it down. Burped a few times, not even a bit of anything came up, I was pretty happy. Really good roll too. I drank about a small fiji-bottle sized amount of water throughout the night.   My last roll was last night, dropped another legoman in halves, about an hour and 15 minutes apart from each other. Ate about 3 hours prior. Fucking amazing roll (best roll tbh). I felt the gurgliness on the comeup, but I'm not usually scared of that cause it usually goes away after the first 15/20 minutes. Although, at the end of the night, I drank a fair bit of water, probably more than I should have. I was able to hold in the nausea for about 20 minutes until I finally came out. It was all water.  TL;DR: I want to hear people's stories on throwing up on their comedowns and if possibly found a way to keep it from coming up.  Since it's usually during the comedown I don't actually mind throwing up since its mostly water, but I would like to avoid it as much as possible. Thanks for reading and hope to hear your stories!"

You can do this with pre-load supplements.  As for now?  Eat some yummy food and try to exercise (it helps).  If you can get your hands on some take 5htp + Green Tea Extract(EGCG) + Vitamin C each night.  There are supplements out there for this type of thing that perhaps you can try next time?

MDMA,3aers1,only_spoons,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:36:24 2015 UTC,No problem. I think it was a full two weeks until I felt 100% but after the first week I definetly started feeling a bit better. It wasn't just me either it was my whole rave group that felt more or less the same for the duration. I'm actually going to the same rave that I did the three day roll last year again today lol. Not going to be making the same mistake twice though . just hoping I didn't lose the magic because of last years stunt as I haven't rolled since then. Wish me luck lol.

MDMA,3aers1,73grandam,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:31:02 2015 UTC,"You will be fine. This is why you shouldn't roll three days in a row. Don't do it again!  Take the rest of this week really easy, get lots of sleep, lots of water, lots of healthy food. Also try to get some exercise in and see friendly, positive people. Listening to uplifting music can help. I find smoking weed quite relaxing and pleasant on a come down too."
MDMA,3aers1,73grandam,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:06:29 2015 UTC,Advice: Don't freaking roll three days in a row. Throw some L in there one day. Its recommended you only roll once every three months for a reason

Have fun !"

Had the best night of my life, strong and clean pills u will enjoy !!  It lasted for +5h, dancing like there's no tomorrow at a night club .  Enjoooooooooy mate, I recommed you take 1 then redose with 1/2   PD : I am 69kg bodyweight and taking 1/2 hmm i dont think if is a good idea man, as a first timer yeah but if u already had experience with MDMA, i wouldnt recommed take 1/2, i just gave to my friends half of that pill (first time user ) and yeah he got a nice high and didnt need more for whole night  I strongly recommed take 1 pill if u are looking for a strong roll and peak, but if u wanna be like 7/10 ( rate )  then take 1/2 and redose with same, IMO I really wont do that because aint ur first time, ( btw, it was my 4th time rolling ) so I cant have much tolerance   In case of redose never redose 2h later, is already late and the redose will be pretty useless (just a little bit longer roll) nothing else  I always redose 90min later and I have like a 2nd peak"

MDMA,3absbx,Maklo_Never_Forget,3,Thu Jun 18 20:52:21 2015 UTC,If it tested as mdma before than for the sake of safety just test it again.  MDMA is very stable and shouldnt degenerate or become more potent over time.
MDMA,3absbx,smmagic,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:21:09 2015 UTC,"If it's been tested okay, then it should be still okay. MDMA/MDA won't degrade until much much higher temperatures.

MDMA,3acf5z,tombstoneci7y,2,Thu Jun 18 23:40:13 2015 UTC,"Although someone here says it doesn't happen with MDMA I can confirm anecdotally that I usually always get ""waves"" when rolling. Usually if starting with 100mg then redosing it will give me a nice buzz for a few solid hours. During that time I'll come ""up"" and then plateau nicely a few times.   It's never normally just ""peak"" and then done that's for sure."
MDMA,3acf5z,Danbob6,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:19:17 2015 UTC,"If I'm honest, this has only happened to me a few times. I usually take my pills like this: half first, then quarter, quarter, and additional quarters if I feel up to it. The initial half is the biggest come up, but usually after I drop the next few quarters I get these warm waves and rushes throughout my body, with a few seconds to a minute of intensity. Feels pretty good, especially when you're already high."
MDMA,3acf5z,mushy-peas,0,Thu Jun 18 23:52:31 2015 UTC,"I think what people mean when they say they are coming up again is that they can feel another peak coming. This can happen if you start with high doses and redose with a high dose. Take me as an example. I do not recommend this because it is unhealthy. But I would start the night with 2 pills, one swallowed and one parachuted so they hit at different times. Then as I start the descent of my peak, I take another pill or split it with someone else. Or I snort some. You'll get your peak back pretty quickly and it will extend it."

I'm just going to assume you have your stuff checked. How long after your initial dose do you redose?  I know some people get antsy and redose too early which results in an overwhelming roll."
MDMA,3acf5z,pandachestpress,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:57:25 2015 UTC,"On one dose, I haven't heard of that happening.  Unlike classic psychedelics, MDMA isn't considered to have waves."

Find a cleaner product and I think you will be much happier. Another method is to take your dose a little before you usually do so your peak is more of a plateu."
MDMA,3acf5z,tantalized,5,Thu Jun 18 23:47:44 2015 UTC,"If you do not do MDMA, I think you should refrain from giving advice on MDMA and I want to say that in the most polite way possible.

Taking a combination of 5-HTP, Green Tea Extract, and Melatonin before bed will help you sleep, and help regenerate serotonin in the brain faster than not doing anything at all.  If you wake up in the middle of the night after falling asleep, take some more melatonin to put yourself back out.  Along with that, you need to eat well and attempt to exercise (I never want to exercise but it actually does help)   Other than these things, you'll just have to wait it out.  Next time you drop, do consider some supplements . I do every time i roll now and I'm usually at work the next day."

I snorted cocaine while rolling, too. and smoked weed, though not all of the time.  I lost the magic after about 2 years of doing that (there were some breaks there, but not that many. depended on whether I was in the middle of a semester or not, though not always). I never got the magic back.  My memory have suffered. I have recently met with a neurologist who ordered a lot of tests to try to identify whether I really have something wrong with me."

Camel crush are good because if you do not like menthol, you do not have to crush the ball. I dislike menthol cigarettes, even when rolling (although, I must admit, that I always crush the ball for the last few drags--at least when I smoked. I have been smoke-free for 3 years).

Most people on here say wait 3 months between each time but I think that's a bit excessive. I usually do it like 3 times every 2 months, so like once every 3 weeks or so and I've never seen any decline in quality in 2.5 years  I'm not sure why you think it's cut with speed though, if you're getting it as beige crystal I seriously doubt it's cut with speed"

MDMA,3ab06c,bunnydoctor,0,Thu Jun 18 17:56:44 2015 UTC,After a certain point more is certainly less. You'll just get too fucked up to fully experience it and you'll forget half your night.

MDMA,3aax6e,bobthetrucker,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:53:20 2015 UTC,Chemistry of how it works in your brain? Should be kosher. Chemistry of how to make it? Why would you think such a public forum is a good place for that?
MDMA,3aax6e,FailWhale42,-1,Thu Jun 18 17:48:26 2015 UTC,To make it. We should allow discussion similar to The Vespiary.
MDMA,3aax6e,FailWhale42,2,Thu Jun 18 17:50:07 2015 UTC,"This site is a corporation, no way a corporation wants that kind of liability on their site... hence the rule. It's not ""our"" site, so if it doesn't work for you, you'll either need to find another one that does, or make one."
MDMA,3aax6e,snapchats,2,Thu Jun 18 17:56:34 2015 UTC,Because talking about the synthesis implies you intend to synthesize it which means that you may or may not have some. And no one synthesizes personal amounts.  So reddit doesn't condone drug dealing. So go look at pihkal.
MDMA,3aax6e,itstingsandithurts,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:05:10 2015 UTC,"Is it just not possible to synthesize a small amount or is it far too difficult to be worth doing on a small scale?   I feel like I'm treading a line asking this, but I'm genuinely just curious."

MDMA,3aaf57,Adriaantje,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:31:44 2015 UTC,"Some people can, some don't. Or maybe it wasn't/was bad mdma. Mdma triggers the release of the hormone that tells your body to keep all fluids in. Maybe your bladder tension overrules this.  Anyway, yes the fact you can pee decreases chances of hyponatremia (overhydrating) drastically."
MDMA,3aaf57,S0rb0,2,Thu Jun 18 15:46:58 2015 UTC,"It was definitely MDMA, I got it from the dark web and tested it."
MDMA,3aaf57,Belleinoc,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:51:05 2015 UTC,Those issues are found at way higher doses. You dosed normal/ low so you didn't have any terrible effects
MDMA,3aaf57,peonyourface,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:05:00 2015 UTC,I believe the inability is fairly common. I wouldn't say majority or anything but I know of quite a few people who have some trouble peeing. if you take green tea extract pills prior to the roll it should help a lot!
MDMA,3aaf57,n1ll0,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:40:11 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain getting sick from overhydrating (hyponatremia) has nothing directly to do with your ability (or inability) to urinate. Indirectly, I suppose NOT being able to pee miiight cause you to retain SOME of the water in your body and thereby quicken the onset of hyponatremia.  However, the real culprit of electrolyte loss and resulting hyponatremia is sweating.. water lost due to sweating has a much higher sodium content AND it is an autonomic response of your body so you have NO control over it one way or another (and in fact you have LESS control over NOT sweating because MDMA is a CNS stimulant and is naturally going to make you sweat more)."
MDMA,3aaf57,NJ_state_of_mind,0,Thu Jun 18 23:20:22 2015 UTC,"It's important to note that just because your body handled it well the first time doesn't mean it will continue to do so, especially as you increase dosages."

MDMA,3a8gep,bunnydoctor,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:52:31 2015 UTC,I think I saw an EZ Test claiming that they can test purity. You can also get an estimate of the amount of MDMA contained in your pill.  I also suggest that you test your MDMA to see if it actually contains MDMA.
MDMA,3a8gep,corn01,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:39:47 2015 UTC,I already ordered a test kit and it's on its way!  My main question is can I like crush up the pill and weigh it on a scale to know the dosage? Or is that not how it works? I'm very new to this!
MDMA,3a8gep,BobbleheadDoll,2,Thu Jun 18 01:47:49 2015 UTC,"Let's say you have a pill and you crush it up.  You weigh the powder, and is 200 mg.  Now, it would be impossible for that to be 200 mg of MDMA because you needs something to hold all the stuff together.  So, you might have:  180 mg of MDMA + 20 mg of binder (inert stuff that doesn't matter) 80 mg of MDMA + 100 mg of caffeine + 20 mg of binder 0 mg of MDMA + 180 mg of methylone + 20 mg of binder 180 mg of ???? + 20 mg of binder.  Do you see the problem?"

MDMA,3a7huy,CaptainButtFuckler,2,Wed Jun 17 20:54:42 2015 UTC,Sounds like a solid plan to me. If i were in your shoes i would take her on a nice walk through the woods. she might feel it kick in and just start talking about how she feels while on rolling. You guys might even want to sit down and read about mdma so she can actually know what to look for it could make her less worried if she knows what its gonna do. She'll love it and im sure you two will have a good night.
MDMA,3a7huy,cats-f-days,2,Wed Jun 17 21:33:04 2015 UTC,"We have some woods right next to my house so that sounds like a very feasible plan, I can't say I've done a nature walk myself while on MDMA and it sounds magical. She is a worrier at heart and while I do tell her of the dangers and how minimal they are under responsible usage, I also attempt to emphasize the positives, bonding experience, and euphoria. I think you are absolutely correct, I'll sit down with her sometime soon and we'll browse the effects it will have on her, the sensations and such that she can expect to experience. I'm sure that would rest her mind a bit, thank you!"

MDMA,3a3qb9,MDMA-Questions,5,Wed Jun 17 00:07:35 2015 UTC,Lego or TripAdvisor theyre both tested around 200mg on average. blue tesla is around 180mg average tested Yellow ups is 160-270mg tested so is a lucky dip on whether you get a good one red ups has a batch that is only around 160mg average  Tripadvisor is probably easier to swallow than a little legoman so id go for that one
MDMA,3a3qb9,hallothar15,5,Wed Jun 17 00:41:37 2015 UTC,You don't have to worry about size if you chew them first. :)

Yeah, just a different way to parachute it--so drink it all at once. The issue with this method, though, is that you might not get all the little fragments that might stick to your cup. But it is a tastier way to do it! Parachuting (with small piece of toilet paper) is more preferred."

MDMA,3a3qb9,monkeytown-awesome,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:39:43 2015 UTC,They were popular because they were high-quality and also high-strength.
MDMA,3a3qb9,mushy-peas,0,Wed Jun 17 12:11:26 2015 UTC,"It's because people seen ""270mg"" and disregarded the fact that there was a massive spread so chances are the pill they've got won't be anywhere near that strong.  I feel like it's kind of the same with orange tesla's, people see ""250mg"" and so big them up so much even though they're probably not that strength. They probably don't have as big a spread as the UPS' though"

My eyes rolled back for what felt like forever if I wasn't consciously trying to look at something (take that as you will, I enjoy it when my eyes roll back). Loved everyone. Everything felt good.

MDMA,3a5lky,redweed12,2,Wed Jun 17 12:16:17 2015 UTC,It will have anywhere from 160- 250mgs of mdma depending on if it's an og domino or not.
MDMA,3a5lky,sgchubbz,2,Wed Jun 17 14:01:21 2015 UTC,so even if its 350 mgs it could only have like 160 of mdma?  thatd be lame as fuck lol
MDMA,3a5lky,n1ll0,3,Wed Jun 17 14:06:57 2015 UTC,"yeah the amount of mdma in a pressed pill will never equal the pills gross weight because binding materials are required to press everything together in a hard pill.   This is not from personal experience, but I'd estimate the mdma content in a given pill is ~1/3 to 1/2 of the full weight, depending on the press quality/binders used/etc."
MDMA,3a5lky,n1ll0,0,Wed Jun 17 17:06:46 2015 UTC,well yeah i get that obviously. filler is necessary  was just hoping for more than half lol. well whatever i guess ill see when i eat them lol
MDMA,3a5lky,n1ll0,2,Wed Jun 17 17:09:19 2015 UTC,"hahah yeah for sure! I feel ya.. if my understanding of the process is correct, as you get into higher binder:mdma ratios the pills become less easy to press, i.e. you would have a crappy, crumbly pill as opposed to a nice solid legit press."
MDMA,3a5lky,n1ll0,0,Wed Jun 17 17:16:17 2015 UTC,yeah that def makes a lot of sense  haha been so long since ive fucked with pressies. i feel like a noob lol
MDMA,3a5lky,sgchubbz,2,Wed Jun 17 17:23:23 2015 UTC,"hahah you're alright.. I'm not an expert by any means and I don't have any direct experience with pressing pills, so take my comments with a grain of salt.. however, I feel like I have a fairly decent understanding of the process so I thiiink its accurate..  As a side note, if you happen across any orange tesla pills, definitely pick them up.. they are fuckin amazing!"
MDMA,3a5lky,n1ll0,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:34:57 2015 UTC,"it sucks cuz i know someone with em but its a personal stash. its like why tease me?  when i first started rolling in 2008, rolls were still super legit. you had to be careful but overall it was the norm for mdma users. molly was around but it was always legit as fuck. people didnt cut molly then and at a fest itd be $20 for 100mgs  then rolls just fuckin died so hard. the transistion period sucked. you like had to relearn shit cuz molly and rolls are different  i really couldnt be anymore happy that rolls are slightly making s comeback. imo they hit you so much harder"
MDMA,3a5lky,ChemEPHD,2,Wed Jun 17 17:39:05 2015 UTC,"yeah for sure! hahah I have half of one left, but Ima try to get a few more from a DNM in a minute here.  I just recently got back into the scene a little bit ago and I'd agree.. I had 1 or 2 presses back in like 2007 or so that were legit as fuck and then a year or two later anything I tried to find was methylone.. glad the nice pure dutch presses are making a comeback (although to be honest I dont mind a smidge of some stimulant thrown in for a bit of extra dancing energy ;) haha)."

MDMA,3a5lky,artbars1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"ok cool  also idk like which version this is but id guess its one of the later ones, but honestly idk  making a pill with that much filler is bushleague tho"
MDMA,3a5lky,Belleinoc,3,Wed Jun 17 14:37:53 2015 UTC,"this may just be my ignorance, but I was under the impression that the less filler, the worse the quality of the press.  that being said, there's probably a sweet spot where you have just enough binder:mdma to give a strong roll with a good quality press."
MDMA,3a5lky,Wackomann666,2,Wed Jun 17 17:08:39 2015 UTC,"You need the filler to bind the MDMA.  You can't press pure MDMA, so without a filler you can't have a pill."

There is a rapper in Croatia where i live, he is called Stoka and he is known to have taken 20 ecstasy tablets per day back in the late 90's and early 2000's. After few years he stopped with this habit and then started doing cocaine daily. Anyway he is still alive and he is clean now after few rehab sessions.

MDMA,3a5mzr,ronstoppable420,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:44:05 2015 UTC,Well what is describe is not the equivalent of 100mg per day anyway. What he just said is somewhat irrelevant to the question at hand as people have actually died directly from MDMA. This is not a good way to use anecdotal evidence.
MDMA,3a5mzr,thecheddarman1,3,Wed Jun 17 19:02:38 2015 UTC,"Okay so you know a person that takes exactly 100mg MDMA daily? Or is there an experiment with more people taking 100mg in exact same set and setting (and other things that can matter) ? Pretty sure there isnt and im too pretty sure there wont be an experiment like this (taking the dose daily until they die) in the future, so i guess all that we can say are examples of people doing similar mdma sessions (like my example, and example of /u/luring ).

To mix it up sometime, you should try rolling with a lower dose at just your normal party scene (bar, live music concert, etc.).. 10/10 would recommend.. I love going to a big ass electronic festival / rave / concert / whatever you wanna call it and dancing for 4 or 5 hours straight while rolling, but its soooo much fun to go with a small group of friends to something that is not as epic and just let the feels engulf you.. haha"

MDMA,3a5bfg,n1ll0,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:07:01 2015 UTC,"the only way that a dosage can be measured safely without a scale is volumetrically.  To do this you would dissolve the mdma in a given volume of solvent (water, alcohol, etc.), and then distribute whatever volume is required for a necessary dose.  E.g. If you dissolve 1g mdma into 1L of water, you would pour out 1 dL (.1 L) of water per 100mg of mdma because 100mg is .1 of a gram."

MDMA,3a5bfg,tommylaw96,0,Wed Jun 17 17:19:02 2015 UTC,"Every time I've had mdma I've never actually weighed it on a scale, just split the gram into equal-ish piles depending on how many people are taking it. I've never had any problems with doing that so you will probably be ok."

MDMA,3a3qch,eeeeeeeeerw,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:37:33 2015 UTC,"Hello!   Make sure you test whatever it is you ingest. Marquis test is the standard test for MDMA. Here is one you can buy for a reasonable price:  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Marquis-Reagent-5ml-Analytical-Grade-MDMA-Presumptive-Test-Free-Shipping-/281688296680?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item4195ee4ce8  Here is the supplement guide on reddit:  https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/15m9sf/mdma_supplementation  There is a lot there but the important ones are Na-R-ALA, Magnesium, and Vitamin C. Also, 5-HTP helps with the recovery.   Drink a water bottle of water every hour. If you are more idle and relaxing; every 2 hours should be okay.  Make sure your comfortable with your environment before you take it, surrounded by people you trust. Don't overdue it - I recommend no more than 1.2mg/lb body weight. If you're dealing with pills, some pills can contain up to or slightly above 200mg. This is probably too much for a first-timer. Know what you have. http://www.pillreports.net/  Have fun! <3  https://www.reddit.com/r/DrugNerds/comments/15m9sf/mdma_supplementation"
MDMA,3a3qch,YourMVP01,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:58:33 2015 UTC,"Before the roll take some vitamin C, it prevents neurotoxicity and is good for your immune system (MDMA kills your immune system for a little bit). Some people take magnesium before as well to prevent their jaw from clenching - I just chew gum whenever I roll instead. During your roll, drink about a cup of water every hour. Also be sure to take your time with your roll, don't redose immediately (wait at least an hour before redosing) & give yourself time to come down a little. The day after its normal to feel a little sad because your brain has depleted its serotonin. You also prob won't have much of an appetite. You can take 5HTP to regulate your mood & appetite! :-) Just remember to have fun & enjoy yourself, the mindset you go into it having, affects the whole roll!"
MDMA,3a3qch,sarahlituma,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"First, test your product ahead of time.  If you're copping at the festival without testing, you are taking a risk.  That risk could be wasting money, or it could be taking some shit you have no interest in actually taking.  Also, measure what you get.  Eyeballing a dose can be an issue.  Second, stay hydrated.  Festivals tend to be hot, have water on hand before you start rolling.  Don't start to get dehydrated then have to wait in a hot line for water.  Just have it stocked and ready.  Third, I follow rollsafe.org as someone suggested.  Those supplements have generally led to very smooth trips, limited toxicity (as I understand it), and very little comedown/bad days after.  Finally, and MOST importantly, have fun!"

MDMA,3a7chx,Hommushardhat,8,Wed Jun 17 23:13:56 2015 UTC,"It's legal until you're caught actually committing a crime, then it's used as evidence against you. This sub is used for discussion and research purposes only. There's no one selling the drug on this sub. If you look in the sidebar it actually has some tips for how to roll safely. Universities have this too.  Comparing talking about your experience with drugs versus talking about raping children is like comparing apples and oranges. In one, with drugs, you're talking about something that you voluntarily did to yourself. Raping a kid is harming someone else. But, in the eyes of the law, talking about it is completely legal as well.   Talking about something and actually doing something are two different things. Only possession is illegal. I can talk about doing all sorts of drugs, but that won't hold up in a court of law unless they actually find drugs on you or in your house. Consumption is perfectly legal, you have to be holding or have evidence that you were buying/selling. Same principal goes with what you were talking about. It's perfectly legal unless they find hard evidence that you committed a crime.   I'm not sure where you live, but the first amendment protects those in the United States."

There needs to be open discussion so the public can be informed with the truth rather than manufactured propaganda.  Look at what is happening because people are informed.  Many states now have medicinal marijuana policies in place and other states have simply legalized it.  The propaganda used to make marijuana illegal in the first place is slowly being eroded as people become more educated.

Why and how and etc. Maybe it is a waste of drugs but I'm trying to figure out how and why exactly it's bad or worse for you than doing just one or the other instead of combining them.
MDMA,3a3g6x,gixxerfanatic,3,Wed Jun 17 23:48:11 2015 UTC,Alcohol mutes a significant portion of the feeling of MDMA. It also compounds the neurotoxicity and further diminishes the body's ability to regulate it's temperature. Having more than a couple drinks is not a good idea at all.

MDMA,3a43bf,MDMAisFUCKINGAWESOME,2,Wed Jun 17 04:43:39 2015 UTC,"best way....get it at the show on the first night... DONT INGEST IT!!! bring it back to your hotel...find someone with a test kit...test that its MDMA...if it is go crazy...if it isnt...repeat process for the THIRD day and hope for the best  edit: you are also more likely NOW to find real MDMA in a press instead of crystals....used to be the exact opposite but now half the stuff being sold AT THE FESTIVAL is bath salts..honestly best to bring your own stuff from a darknet market or a trusted dealer, but it seems a little late for that for you haha"
MDMA,3a43bf,GenericPoster85,3,Fri Jun 19 06:56:46 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend checking out the darknet markets, learn how to use them properly, order from a reputable vendor, for cheaper than you'll get a festival that's probably purer. As for sneaking it in, just tape only the dose you'll be using between your balls and leg if you're a dude, or just inside your lips if you're a chick. Either way, shave it clean first."

People should get to decide for themselves whether or not it's a good idea to partake in whatever drugs. Know yourself, know your drugs.

The roll was actually better the 2nd day because I got more sleep the night before.  The toll it took on me was really felt that next Tuesday.  I didn't supplement at all which was dumb, so I'd highly recommend doing everything you can there.  I've also heard coke and MDMA isn't encouraged, just because of the dual affects of coke raising your heart rate and what MDMA does to your brain (someone else can probably explain that part a lot better).  I'd say either do coke one night and roll the other, or roll both days, because it's doable and enjoyable if done safely and in moderation."

The second day I rolled ten times harder but I came down much faster than the first night, still enjoyable nonetheless.  I didn't have a horrible comedown, but my body was definitely exhausted for the entire week. I also had tree to help out for that week.   Sometimes people in this sub blow rolling back to back out of proportion, but you definitely should not make it a habit. You may feel like you're rolling harder but you are doing a lot of damage at the same time. Keep it to a minimal, supplements can only do so much and it'll make you choose when you roll better."

MDMA,39zcjf,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:36:11 2015 UTC,"After reposting this thread in r/Drugs, Mr /u/Borax brought up the idea that it might be a benzofuran because these generally gives similar results to MDMA's with reagent kits. (Gathering pieces of information on many drug related forums (bluelight, drug-forum, psychonaut, shroomery, erowid, etc...), I was able to identify 5-APB as the one closest to my color results (http://www.nist.gov/oles/upload/Color-Tests-and-Analytical-Difficulties-with-Emerging-Drugs-Morris.pdf), even tho I couldn't find a Simon's reagent result picture to compare so I still had no confirmation. I also read that benzofurans are generally in powder form in a color spectrum from white to brown and a little bit sticky (my substance was a brown sticky powder with a stange smell, not too far off the MDMA smell). But even tho I had these small pieces of info after the thread, I drew the conclusion that it was probably MDA with impurities that would've reacted so I ended up trying it at 100mg dosage.  I was impressed how only 100mg launched me on another planet. Also the roll felt trippy like MDA but it lacked all stimulant effect of MDA or MDMA. Litterally no dopamine neither norepinephrine activity compared to those 2 (from what i've experienced before). And so I told myself that this substance couldnt be MDA, it was too different. I was very stoned, like, strong ass body load. It wasn't empathogen so much, didnt feel the need of talking but it was one hell of an entactogen. I would just rub my couch while sitting on it to feel how soft it was, or just throw myself into a big pile of pillow and get comfy to talk with my friends. I just sat in my couch for almost all the roll and smoked some weed throughout the whole experience. It was very enjoyable, it felt really really great.  Judging from my trip and all informations I've gathered in the last weeks, if I had to point out one drug and say ""this is the one"", I'd say what I got is 5-APB.   Sticky, brown, dull powder that looks like some pictures I find here and there of 5-APB or 6-APB.  It was very strong at 100mg compared to MDMA, whereas 5-APB's strong dosage ranges between 100 and 150mg. Also, I was still feeling effects about 14 hours after ingestion. after a bong hit the high came back strong for an hour or so before fading smoothly Strong body load, almost no dopaminergic or norepinephrine activity, lots of serotonergic activity. That all points out to 5-APB from the IC50 values I've managed to get: http://www.bluelight.org/vb/archive/index.php/t-608049.html Reagent test kit color results points towards 5-APB   I will be rerolling on this substance again soon to provide you with my first ever trip report!

MDMA,39z8tj,YourMVP01,3,Tue Jun 16 03:38:04 2015 UTC,You'll be fine the day after already to learn as normal again as long as you don't overdue it. Keep the dosage reasonable (for most people who are health conscious and follow the 3-month rule; under 160mg is what I would suggest as a reasonable dosage) and stay hydrated to avoid any sort of hangover.

MDMA,39wjty,troy777,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:51:33 2015 UTC,"Last Glastonbury festival i took a G of MDMA every night for 4 nights straight. Took me a full 20 days to recover and i probably wasn't fully back to normal for another month on top of that. Every night for the week afterwards I had terrifying, vivid dreams just like you said (i dreamt that instead of a festival, Glastonbury was a human meat farm and me and my friends were trapped there), as well as constant depressing thoughts about how my life was going nowhere, which in hindsight was ridiculous (wont go into it). I also experienced brain zaps(?), kind of like an electric shock in your head. Not exactly sure what they're called, but i know i stumbled across the term when researching about why i was so fucked up. My advice to you is this; tell yourself that all the depressing thoughts you are having are just the drugs talking (sounds obvious but just the thought really helped me), spend as much time as possible with close friends and family who you enjoy their company, and eat lots of food rich in vit C and just ride out the pain, you'll get better soon. Remember that when you're feeling like you're at the bottom, the only way is up! Good luck buddy, hope this helps and you start feeling more like yourself again soon!"

MDMA,39yicn,FailWhale42,2,Mon Jun 15 23:33:12 2015 UTC,ok so .150 mg of MDMA will do absolutely nothing. You need .150 g or 150mg. I've done 60mg (0.06 g) as therapy for SSRI discontinuation and up to 250mg (0.250 g) for fun. I find 100 mg (0.100 g) to 200 mg (0.200 g) to be sufficient.

Also helpful are magnesium in a bioavailable form, sublingual vitamin B-12(/B-6/folic acid if you can find them combined), 2000 iu vitamin D or get regular sunshine   -regular workouts, of the style that make you feel best.   Melatonin in a low dose (1mg or less) made a big difference in fixing my sleep problems after my brush with mdma habituation   -if you felt the magic disappearing, noopept can be helpful to jumpstart your brain chemicals again.

MDMA,39va6v,Ejacu1337,7,Mon Jun 15 02:22:24 2015 UTC,"Hallucinations often indicate the possible presence of MDA, rather than MDMA if I remember correctly, but I haven't read about those things in a long time and my memory isn't what it once was.    In my experience, hallucinations have typically occurred after hitching a second or third ride in a given night.  Here are few of my favorites (nothing crazy but I thought I'd share):  •  A shower of green and purple dots over a friend's face while he spoke to me.  •  My SO's nose, completely covered in a thick layer I dark hair.  • A procession of men in black robes, slowly scaling a mountain in the distance.  I don't know about you, but I love how peaceful one feels in the face of visual hallucinations triggered my MDMA.  Had I seen the same things on LSD or on shrooms I might have been a little freaked out, but a little MD and you be like, yeeeeeeaaaaaah."
MDMA,39va6v,LoneyJon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:10:57 2015 UTC,"Yes you're right, it is MDA which is hallucinogenic and MDMA is converted to MDA in the brain, I've also had visuals like purple clouds over the treetops, it was sunrise as well. That was most definitely my favourite visual"
MDMA,39va6v,MDMaaaZING12,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:27:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting. It may have been cut with MDA then in retrospect. Definitely happens after redosing a couple times for me. It doesn't help that my body is tired but my mind is racing.  I think a lot of my hallucinations aren't psychedelic though, just entirely misleading. Often, they are quite vivid and happen within a blink of an eye. Another example is when I was dozing off on my bed, sitting upright. I kept laying my hands down in front of my as if I was sat at the keyboard in front of my computer. In my mind, I thought I was, then I would 'wake up' and discover my hands in the rested keyboard position with no keyboard. That and seeing black cats out of the corner of your eye, etc."
MDMA,39va6v,MDMaaaZING12,0,Mon Jun 15 14:38:29 2015 UTC,"Did you get it off a dealer? Or darknets? Cause to my knowledge people don't really cut with MDA, I may be wrong though. you get MDA from high doses of MDMA anyway, is it at all possible you just took a lot? I find tripping tends to happen if you come up hard or re dose or just take a lot in one."
MDMA,39va6v,MDMaaaZING12,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:37:31 2015 UTC,"I got it years before the darknets was a thing in the form of ecstacy. The pills where really strong whatever they were. A lot of the hallucinations came during the come down into the early morning. Without a doubt they were cut with caffeine. What's really interesting is I was able to induce a similar effect by staying up all night and stimulating myself with caffeine (not on purpose) but I had similar effects of double-taking things, auditory hallucinations, etc into the morning. Perhaps some of it was due to tiredness. Without a doubt the pills were intense. I had an insane come up that I wasn't prepared for."
MDMA,39va6v,Malmm,0,Wed Jun 17 12:10:24 2015 UTC,"Well I always find that the hallucinations from MD come in during or before the come down anyway, have you considered speed as a cutting agent? Would explain why it lasted longer"

First time taking only MDMA, but have taken E before.   Was at an awesome techno party and I think it was on the second dose that I thought there was a railing or something on the dancefloor so I would fall over, but was all the time with my friend and from what I remember I saw that a few times and said it but he said theres nothing there, then it was fine. Also I though my water bottle I held the entire time was like a hand computer that I use at my work, but I realised after looking again it wasnt.  Kinda weird experience, but it wasnt scary or anything."
MDMA,39va6v,borris_the_dachshund,2,Mon Jun 15 20:46:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely know what you mean. The pills I took were clearly Ecstasy so they were definitely cut with other shit, but this is the type of stuff that I would experience. It's not scary, you're just like ""meh."" Kinda careless, but when you look back on it you wonder how you weren't more confused. It's just really weird."
MDMA,39va6v,Z32opXX49,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:18:13 2015 UTC,"Its pretty common for me to get them at the end of the night after a redose. It is usually peoples facing having 'blur lines' on them, almost like someone put a feather on top of their feature (if that makes any sense at all). Once I a guy turned into the Thing from the fantastic four. My favourite was looking at a brick wall and one brick turned into a puzzle piece and ran around the wall. Most recently I was in a toilet and saw dripping water on the walls. It was so realistic I had to touch it to see if it was really there.  I completely agree with LoneyJon, the hallucinations feel so peaceful. Im one to get easily freaked out but with MDMA I've just learnt to be like 'cool' and enjoy the show."
MDMA,39va6v,throwaway89714,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:41:37 2015 UTC,"If your taking a lot of mdma you can expect some visuals depending on how much you take. The more you take the more you will experience.  However regardless of the amount I have taken I always get slight visuals after the come down when I go to sleep. Thankfully I can sleep fine after the comedown. For me its probably a combination of being tied and trying to sleep that causes them. Again the amount I have taken effects this.   I do get pretty weird/almost real dreams. They almost seem real that is when I wakeup but it pretty easy to distinguished them once I am fully up.   However all that being said I have had friends who have taken more than me in a given night and experience non of this.   As for myself it is something I enjoy and actually look forward to. For me, it is all apart of the experience and led to me trying psychedelics but that is another story."

MDMA,39un88,cbickle,5,Mon Jun 15 00:56:15 2015 UTC,Generally speaking I roll once every three months. Early this year I had a 6 week break which is my shortest ever. I've also started taking higher doses (200mg+). But my most recent break was 3 months and for my next roll I plan to wait 4 months (it's been 1 month so far) and I'm going to take a pink chupa chup which is like 130-160mg. I want to continue taking longer breaks and less mdma until I can get a good roll from moderate doses again.

MDMA,39un88,SlipperyWhenWettt,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:22:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe what you're taking isn't MDMA?  Dude at the end of the day everyone experiences effects of drug abuse differently..some people can abuse alcohol and live a healthy life, some people can abuse alcohol and end up with liver disease, that doesn't mean that alcohol doesn't have effects of long term abuse, nor does it mean you're immune to them just because you may not have experienced them yet.  At the end of the day to think you're completely immune from long term abuse effects is just ignorant and stupid, and if you're really so fine, and you really DID abuse MDMA everyday weekend for 12 years straight, then i'd be surprised if there was much MDMA in what you were taking  There are hundreds of studies online that prove MDMA has long term cognitive effects if you abuse it, and there are also considerable amounts of anecdotal evidence of people experiencing these effects...I for one consider my usage fairly moderate, however i have noticed an increased in depression in my hangovers, brain zaps after a binge, effects to my short term memory for about a week or so after using if i binge on too much..  Just because you don't necessarily feel the effects doesn't mean that they aren't there, if you genuinely took MDMA, every week for 12 years, that's 12x52, which is 624 separate occasions you took MDMA. Now let's say like you said, you missed a few weeks, so let's say each year you missed 5 weeks, so 564 separate occasions you took MDMA. Now, how much did you take on average per weekend? Doses as frequent as that i can imagine you were binging quiet hard, seeing as i doubt a standard 150mg would be doing much for you anymore after 12 years...so let's say you averaged 250mg a night, that means over the course of 12 years you consumed 141 grams of MDMA...and you seriously believe that you haven't coursed any long term effect??  I'm not sure if your account is troll or serious anymore."

Not saying there is no damage, just none I've noticed. Shit I even went back to college at 37 and got 2 degrees.  I don't understand why people get so angry about it. I tell other people not to drop too often or large amounts.  Oh by the way, I'm in a European country and got the best of pills. Although nobody tested them back then (88-2000), I do believe after taking tested mdma that the majority of pills I took was mdma. You are right in that I was taking huge hits, up to ten pills a night when out, and although nowhere near as enjoyable as my first few months, enjoyable all the same (although I do need acid to really enjoy it)."

Dude i'm not gonna lie, everything you're telling me seems so ridiculous to me, to the point beyond comprehension i can't tell if you're trolling or not....20 tabs of acid, 10 pills a night...you said you rolled like that for 12 years on 10 pills a night, that's like thousands of grams of MDMA...i don't even know how to respond"
MDMA,39un88,Noble_Ox,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:01:45 2015 UTC,"Go through my history I'm really not bullshitting. Just a major major druggy. Remember this was back in the end of the 80s and all through the 90s. There was no roll safe or anything like that and thank god my country has nothing like D.A.R.E.. I guarantee you loads of people in Ireland (where I'm from) and England were, and probably still are, doing that (well not the acid I don't know anyone who takes acid like I do).  I dont know you but you speak to someone who goes clubbing/raving every weekend for month after month and ask them how much they take or someone from Ireland/England back in them days you'll hear the same kinda story. Sure there was a famous boyband back then from London called East 17 and the lead singer got kicked out for telling reporters that he used to take up to 18 pills when partying, google them.  And it was only every Saturday night through to Sunday day not every day for 12 years."
MDMA,39un88,PunkAintDead,6,Tue Jun 16 08:13:54 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't be rolling more than twice a month. I personally only roll annually, maybe sometimes a little bit more often."

MDMA,39un88,RandallWho,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:19:20 2015 UTC,"depends on when the party season starts for me…but usually once a month for 4-6 months and then once every two or three months before and after.  usually around 6-8 times a year total.  but this year…i haven't rolled since march and dont know when i will roll again might not be till next year. if its, it will be interesting to see what its like with a year break. the longest i have gone recently has been 4 months."
MDMA,39un88,disposable_UK,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:01:41 2015 UTC,"Similar here. In winter it's probably once per 3 months, but during summer when it's festival season then it's maybe once per month / 6 weeks."

Looks to me like to tried to mix everything with your fork and it may have compromised your results. Id test again and let the reaction occur as it look like you did for erhlich and simon's
MDMA,39visu,B42m0row,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:44:55 2015 UTC,"No mixing of results happened. I used a new fork every time to be sure. The reason i spread it out, is that the results were so dark I was having a difficult time making out the colors.   Repeated the results, they came out the same."
MDMA,39visu,B42m0row,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:04:21 2015 UTC,"Well then Id say its MDMA or it could be 5-MAPB, but i seriously doubt it. I only say this because color results from 5-MAPB are practically the same as MDMA, I wouldn't know the exact difference except that its subtle"
MDMA,39sulb,mdmayylmao,5,Sun Jun 14 12:56:11 2015 UTC,"Yep this is normal, happens to me too  Who knows if you're taking to much, that depends how big you are, and also depends what you're taking is pure...for many 200mg in one of is a huge dose, for many it's normal, personally for me that would be quiet a large dose"
MDMA,39sulb,SlipperyWhenWettt,3,Sun Jun 14 13:11:15 2015 UTC,What? How big are you? 200mg of pure MDMA would floor the average user.
MDMA,39sulb,cbickle,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:54:35 2015 UTC,Are you sure you have MDMA? The dosages might hint at bk-MDMA if the effects are weak below 200mg.
MDMA,39sulb,throwawayroller,2,Mon Jun 15 00:57:59 2015 UTC,"I know you've already received a bunch of replies but I'll throw in my two cents as well. Memory loss happens to me personally to a certain extent  every time I roll. Looking back I might not remember certain songs and a chronological string of events, but nobody's brought up something I straight up dont recall experiencing, which is good.   In my opinion it depends a lot on the setting. At a house party, I'll remember better than as if I was at a rave. At a rave I'll remember better if I don't get carried away dancing in the pit, vs hanging around the outsides and chilling moreso."

MDMA,39sulb,RandallWho,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:11:36 2015 UTC,"Is this a normal side effect?    Yup. When i try to recall my nights out some times it gets pretty fuzzy. So dont stress and learn to enjoy it.   Is it possible i am taking too much?    By /r/mdma standards. Yes esp with the 100mg re-dose.   by other peoples standards? Maybe. it all depends on the person. for some people yes a 200mg and 100mg re-dose is to much. For me no, thats almost a normal night.  IMO as long as you are fine with the amount, not doing it to often and taking care of your self in-between rolls. You are probably fine.  I have never felt bad side effects only very enjoyable ones"

Honestly the first event i went to i took 100mg of pure MDMA and the effects were so minimal, it was very disappointing. I Then went 150mg and then 200mg. I find 200mg to be the point for me personally where the bad sides are minimal and im having a blast. Never had a bad night on MD (is that possible? haha)"

Have you ever had similar experience?    Yup.   Will it disappear and when?    Most people will say 3-7 days.   I do not even know if I want to disappear it, cause it makes me much more empathic and nice to other people.

It's quite common after use of MDMA or other psychedelics - you'll probably notice a gradual return to your ""normal"" self over the next few days.   Until then enjoy! I love a nice afterglow, I find it cleanses me of too much cynicism and helps set my outlook on the positives of life and trying to become a better person in general."
MDMA,39tcl5,BraveDiomedes,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:43:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it could be it. I´m feeling rather more positive then negative and I like it, so I doubt it´s about a lack of serotonine.  Today I´m feeling much more ""normal"" then yesterday, so I think It´s leaving me :(   It's a shame, cause I really like it, it changed my (mostly negative) mind. I was feeling like I can do everything, talk to everyone, no blocks, no borders.. and I always wanted to be as such.  Never mind, I look forward for next roll (I know, min. 3 months pause ;) and I hope the next afterglow will last much longer \o/  Thanks all for your contributions!"
MDMA,39tcl5,peedrink,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:37:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah that'll happen - but you should try and  realise that all those blocks to talking to people or whatever are all in your head and that we shouldn't necessarily need an afterglow or other drugs to behave like that. That's what I try to take away from my experiences with this great drug anyway!  Good to see you're being sensible and spacing your rolls out to 3 months. If you want to increase your chances of a better, safer time and a longer afterglow you should follow the supplementation guide at www.rollsafe.org"

MDMA,39scqc,oreohno,2,Sun Jun 14 12:34:58 2015 UTC,If OP only bombed it once and didn't redose meth would not last nearly that long. The first time I smoked meth I had smoked throughout the day which made it last 22 hours before I started coming down and I fell asleep. It certainly could have contained some meth but I know for a fact without redosing it wouldn't last that long.
MDMA,39scqc,Pie23,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:19:14 2015 UTC,I don't have any experience with meth. Would an mdma bomb dose be a high dose of meth? For example 150mg.
MDMA,39scqc,baconmma,2,Sun Jun 14 23:13:45 2015 UTC,Yes that would be a pretty hefty dose.  Threshold doses are ~10mg and a recreational dose is around 80mg.
MDMA,39scqc,ChemEPHD,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"Well I've done both only 3 times and I'll talk about the first of each. I took 200mg of MDMA when I tried it and was out in public and as long as there was music playing I couldn't control myself and would dance. There's the obvious loviness you get from it and (energy for me like I couldn't stop dancing) the ease of talking.  When I had tried meth that day I had gone through about a gram with 3 other people throughout the day and get really fucking high, I had trouble not talking actually lol. I think the euphoria was a little better than MDMA.  I think they're both really fun drugs and unlike MDMA meth makes you want to keep doing it."
MDMA,39scqc,Pie23,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:38:14 2015 UTC,"Did you have a high pulse or were you sweating? Speedy/amph effects? Then it's more likely to be meth. Urge to redose? Also an indication.  If you just can't sleep it's more likely to be a RC or something psychedelic, but it's odd you had no visuals then. Also most RCs have lower dose than MDMA, so that's weird as well then.  I'm voting meth. Might be up for a bit more. Don't worry too much about it and just do productive things while you can. Try reading before you go to sleep the night before (out of a book, not a glowing screen). Some tea or something.   Or if you have benzo's, take those."

MDMA,39scqc,highassnegro,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:39:44 2015 UTC,Did you get some sleep?
MDMA,39scqc,baconmma,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:08:22 2015 UTC,Most likely it was bunk. It could have simply have been caffeine or a very low dosage of one of the 2C compounds. Do you feel tired? Are you calm and at peace? Maybe that's why you can't fall asleep my friend <3. Try to forget about it. You lost out by buying bunk but it is what it is.  I recommend you test your substance before popping them.

I am very certain this wasn't MDMA, and it was in a powdered bag (white powder). I mean I feel fine, with a small headache but it's annoying because I cannot sleep and I would really like to know when so I can actually wake up and feel fresh instead of being stuck in this 2 day limbo D:"
MDMA,39scqc,baconmma,3,Sun Jun 14 09:03:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you took but when I took acid a while ago I couldn't sleep for about 36 hours, slept for 4 hours, then couldn't sleep for another 36 hours. I think the best thing to do is try to stay awake during the day and be reasonably active and don't drink any caffeine or eat lots of sugar. Then go to bed at night time when it's dark and your body knows it's time to sleep. I was worried too but you'll eventually get to sleep."
MDMA,39scqc,BrinxJob,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:30:32 2015 UTC,"He was wired for over a day. Caffeine or 2c would not do that. Certainly not MDMA, but certainly not ""bunk"""

However the you'll still feel good throughout the night and have the energy it gives you, which I think is most important. Hell I'm also going to EDC and will do it there 3 days in a row, same as I did last year. For a music festival I think it's worth it just because it keeps going the whole way through."

Dude I've had a very similar experience to you tonight, normally roll with my friends at parties and clubs etc.  But tonight....  Tonight I decided to do my biggest bomb to date, 200mg and smoke a couple of Js. I was feeling fantastic and decided to drop another 200mg. It was at this point where I wanted to talk to people and just share this feeling I was having, but it led into some amazingly insightful thoughts afterwards.   That music tho', been bringing out some of old favourites and having a great time thinking about past memories. Ive actually got Hendrix on at the moment too but for most of the evening I've been listening to Pink Floyd darkside of the moon.   You're right about the brain explosion, riding solo is awesome!  Sending out positives vibes to whoever reads this, we're all in this together :)"

MDMA,39rlom,bunnydoctor,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:21:26 2015 UTC,"I actually get these huge euphoric and energy rushes on tested mdma and no other substances. I think it has to do something with dose, euphoric and energy kick is usually strongest (for me) at 130-140 mg. Anything above that dose will put me into that relaxed and chilled state with crazy eye wiggles, and with anything less than 130 mg just wont be enough euophoria and energy. I discovered this when i tried those chupa chups pills last year, it was the most intense euphoria rush ever, just could not control that much of energy (ive tested them at the testing center and my pill was 137 mg, and i think spread was about.130-140 mg, not really sure about the spread)....so i would suggest trying to find your sweet spot for mdma. Enjoy :)"
MDMA,39rlom,sarklo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:57:05 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting.  I have done pure MDMA twice, doing 200 mg (200 lb male).  I am supremely chilled on that.  I hadn't considered lowering the dose to intensify the experience.  That sounds counter-intuitive, but sometimes things work that way."
MDMA,39rlom,bunnydoctor,3,Sun Jun 14 14:43:40 2015 UTC,"Seems like a lot of people including myself become a bit sedated with MDMA. The good tabs back in the day used to have everyone FLYINGGGG and I mean truly defining the phrase ""rolling balls.""   Anyway, assuming your MDMA is clean and as close to pure as it will get then that's just how it is. I've heard large doses will sedate you more because it will be heavy and that you have to find that certain ""sweet spot"" to wher eit won't be AS MELLOW. However, you could always try to mix it with other things at safe dosages like MDA, amphetamines, caffeine, etc.  Personally, the best combo I've found MDMA+speed (amphetamine sulfate) to be the cleanest combo. Good luck finding your combo to give you that extra UMPH!"
MDMA,39rlom,oreohno,2,Sun Jun 14 04:28:46 2015 UTC,That's how your body responds to MDMA unfortunately.

MDMA,39rlom,adderyn,2,Sun Jun 14 02:40:55 2015 UTC,"Reduce the dose, 200 is going to be overwhelming leading to just wanting to sit down, if you take 100mg in a stimulanting environment you will have a way better chance."

The second time, while still fun, I didn't experience the same intensity. Probably due to a cross tolerance from doing other psychs pretty frequently at the time."
MDMA,39rjo1,BicycleBitch,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:43:13 2015 UTC,Sweet. I haven't tried any psychs before. I've been told to do mushrooms or truffles first before trying acid as it can be too intense

We ended up cuddling all night and I kept touching her, especially her back and neck. We only kissed eachother on the cheeks, and agreed on each other that we are just great friends and we just opened up to each other.  I did get a bit horny at some point but told myself I shouldnt take advantage of this situation, even though the chances that i would get under the sheets with her were slim to none. she made that all clear just before I got horny haha.

It's a combination of needing the energy to keep going till 3 or 4 in the morning, plus the feeling of how much better a time I'd be having if I was rolling whenever I just drink.   MDMA is just too fucking good... nothing else compares. I space out my rolls so take Coke in between, but it's a different high really."
MDMA,39puch,disposable_UK,4,Sun Jun 14 01:15:50 2015 UTC,"Yea, it gives you super much energy, but it's the ""connection"" part of mdma that makes it the most interesting, I think. Taking it often is irresponsible tho'."

MDMA,39perk,Sandwichmixto,2,Sat Jun 13 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"I smoke cigs and weed all the time when rolling and I can say thats likely not the problem. Last time I rolled, I had the same symptoms as you the day after:   You likely have early tonsillitis (but hopefully just a cold).    When one rolls, sleeping is difficult, eating is difficult and constant access to water might be difficult- thus viral infections are very easy to catch (especially at a club or a rave with people everywhere). Fortunately it has nothing to do with the drug itself.   I personally had full blown tonsillitis, had to go to the doctor and get antibiotics. Your best bet is to restore you body to full strength by eating lots, drinking lots, vitamin c and lots of rest before things get worse! Best wishes for a speedy recovery!"
MDMA,39oqax,BroMatterhorn,8,Sat Jun 13 08:15:51 2015 UTC,"Nice man, if I have any advice try not to redose more than one. Even if you feel like you are coming up, you are mostly chasing your roll. Just take a bigger initial dose and redose 15-30 minutes into your peak.   I've always found the best success in prolonging my roll this way. Also learning from experience that redosing more than once is not always worth it."
MDMA,39oqax,elijahsantos,4,Sat Jun 13 16:12:21 2015 UTC,"100mg  wait for come up  have fun  50mg redose after an hour or 90 mins  Best way is to eat it.

MDMA,39oqax,AndyG1001,6,Sat Jun 13 09:36:00 2015 UTC,"Ideally only redose one my friend. Any more than that and you'll not only experiencing diminishing effects, you'll be also causing much more harm to your body."

MDMA,39oqax,petnarwhal,2,Sat Jun 13 10:06:04 2015 UTC,"50 mg also is not a significant enough amount to do much. The threshold dose for MDMA is 80mg in it self. So while I realize you are new and 100mg is ample, 50mg seems like a waste. You might as well bump it to 80mg and wait about 1.5-2 hours for the redose. It'll lengthen the experience and keep it intense instead of microdosing 50mg multiple times :)"
MDMA,39oqax,justwhatif,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"You don't have to redose though, see how the evenings goes, redosing causes more negative side effects (more jaw clenching especially) for me."

MDMA,39oqax,fezbeast,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:27:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't think the adderall would have affected it honestly. I've mixed other things with it to great success, but this maybe not.  I'm waiting until 11 a.m. to take another 50mg. That will be 250mg total and I'm gonna stop after that."

I'm pretty sure I've come down a bunch, but at my peak I felt super jittery. Was hoping for more of a euphoric and less manic high, but a solid first time, nonetheless"
MDMA,39oqax,BobbleheadDoll,2,Sat Jun 13 12:06:05 2015 UTC,"You guys probably should have started with a higher dose, in my opinion. Like 125-150mg would have been great."
MDMA,39oqax,fezbeast,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:11:09 2015 UTC,"yeah probably, learning experience though - we still have 600 mg left that we'll keep to do at later dates  that come up felt like I had more energy than I knew what to do with, pretty intense"
MDMA,39oqax,BobbleheadDoll,2,Sat Jun 13 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely. I never had powder when I was rolling, so I never knew how MDMA I was taking at a time. So it's great you are able to be cautious and put in your body as much MDMA as you want.  I think the recommendation is to just do between 1.5 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg of MDMA. So, if you weigh 80 kg, then that would be 120 mg to 160 mg. I am not really sure, though, what the proper doses are--this is just what I saw in an MDMA study using rats."
MDMA,39oqax,deadfap5,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:44:04 2015 UTC,"yeah, I get you - the weirdest thing is that I came up and he didn't, and I'm 5"" taller and weigh 10 lbs more...we were both pretty baffled by this as he almost always starts feeling the shrooms first when we do them together.   We'll probably have to look up the math for weights though. He did 100mg more than me with little to no notable effects, but he was also on hour 12 of a 30mg adderall so we're wondering if that interfered at all"

MDMA,39n0gz,ageofprogress,3,Fri Jun 12 22:11:48 2015 UTC,"as mentioned below, try roughly 2/3 first dose, 1/3 redose at t+60 mins ish.  Some people (myself included) find cigs help with the come-up. Tums can help a little bit if you have come-up issues related to your stomach/gut gurgle/etc.  Other than that, you're taking a pretty intense stimulant, the come-up will feel intense and kinda cracked out. Pre-loading (as per the side-bar) can help mellow out all the effects of rolling. Your come-up will be smoother, your high mellower, and your come-down basically non-existent (my experience). This can be nice, but sometimes it can be too mellow for the environment."

MDMA,39n0gz,BobbleheadDoll,2,Sat Jun 13 07:00:28 2015 UTC,"Not really dude. I thought I had clean drugs cuz it was from DNM's turns out my idiot friend was getting the best deal, not the best shit. When I finally bought pure and expensive MDMA crystal, the come-ups were no longer rocky. Just a huge initial wave of pleasure and euphoria and relaxation and it just continued from there. I also snorted about 70mg of it when I got home and slept like a baby just 2 hours later. I also hardly sweated and clenched, and I'm usually the insane sweaty and clenchy one. While MDMA is a stimulant, I don't think it's truly as cracked out as people think it is - it's just that a lot of it, unless you get it in hard crystal form only, is cut at least to some degree. But that could make for a funner roll if its just a little extra amphetamine."
MDMA,39n0gz,CoffeeNSquats,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:39:01 2015 UTC,"Okay...? That's basically what I said. MDMA can be a really mellow drug, no doubt about it, but the come-up and speedier feeing side effects can happen regardless of purity. The gut issues are partially related to elevated serotonin levels, and gut sensitivity to that varies between people. Similarly, jaw clenching and eye wiggles are partially related to nutrient levels in your body, which obviously vary per person and dose to dose (magnesium supplements help reduce jaw clenching for example).  So, yes, mdma can be mellow and the come up and come down can be pretty chill, but this usually only happens once you've played with the drug enough to be familiar and not confused or overwhelmed or surprised by any of the effects. Also, sensitivity to various side effects is dependent on a lot of things other than purity of drugs.  As I said before, for me pre-loading mellows out rolls: the come up, high, and comedown. If OP's goal was to mellow out his roll, it should help. You don't know what their sensitivities are to determine if his displeasure was the result of significantly adulterated drugs or personal sensitivity to the side effects. My advice addresses the latter, yours the former."
MDMA,39n0gz,BobbleheadDoll,2,Sat Jun 13 17:59:54 2015 UTC,"Also try to distract yourself with other things, like talking to your friends or watching tv, liistenign to music or browing the internet."
MDMA,39n0gz,a_stray_bullet,2,Fri Jun 12 23:21:55 2015 UTC,"It was so intense that I found it impossible to do that. My friend left me for a few minutes and I ended up counting to try free my mind, it helped but not much as I get too introspective."
MDMA,39n0gz,alteredditaccount,2,Fri Jun 12 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"Don't focus on things inside, look for external stimulus to distract you.  It gets kind of intense for people when they keep diving deeper and deeper into their minds.    Enjoy lights, enjoy nature, talk to people, dance.  Do things outside of you, then as you come down you can think about those things more and relax."
MDMA,39n0gz,alteredditaccount,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:13:17 2015 UTC,Okay. Then maybe try other people's suggestions. You could also focus on the positive: the come up is temporary and then you will launch into ecstasy.
MDMA,39n0gz,alteredditaccount,2,Fri Jun 12 23:31:03 2015 UTC,"Eat well during the day and drink water. Try not to smoke while waiting for it to kick in and when it kicks in don't sit down.

MDMA,39n0gz,tolderoll156,2,Sat Jun 13 00:20:30 2015 UTC,You could take a mild dose of a benzo. Given your take on week weed I'd bet it's more anxiety issues that are plaguing you than the actual effects of the roll-preview.

MDMA,39n0gz,yellowfinger,4,Fri Jun 12 23:02:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not discounting that, that's real; but I suspect it's your reaction to the come-up that's the producing the most unpleasant symptoms.

MDMA,39n0gz,peeloo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:35:50 2015 UTC,"Only rolled twice, first time was 3 bombs over the space of hours. Second time was 1 bomb kinda large but nothing extreme.   My friend was fine during it all and they never got anything like it."
MDMA,39n0gz,bunnydoctor,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"OK, so that really sounds like a bit of anxiety exacerbating your come-up. I stick with my recommendation.

MDMA,39n0gz,Belleinoc,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:42:29 2015 UTC,"If you have crystal, you can dissolve your dose in water or something and drink it over half an hour, and it won't all hit at once."

MDMA,39nmhj,ContENT_in_NYC,3,Sat Jun 13 01:11:31 2015 UTC,"you could simulate your own low purity test by either halving the sample size or just cutting it a bit. The test essentially relies on a carefully weighed sample size.  Eztest claims to have calibrated the reaction, although I am not sure if they had an analogue to test with. I don't believe eztest has the proper authority to handle mdma directly."
MDMA,39nmhj,LiquidLabs414,2,Sat Jun 13 05:40:02 2015 UTC,"I thought I would share my results after having purchased the EZ Test MDMA Purity Test (do not expect much scientific rigor)  I tested two samples of MDMA. The first which is marked ""NEW - HOS"" was sourced from the DNM from a reputable vendor (guess who) and the unmarked sample was what was left from an older order from SR1.  Both samples have been tested using dancesafe's test kit (Mandelin, Mecke, Marquis and Simon's Reagents) with a pic of the results in the album.  Both samples have also been tested personally and I have not had any issues with either. All rolls have been sublime with no jaw ache, heavy body load or negative comedowns ever. In fact I'm one of the lucky people who get that ""after glow"" the day after rolling.  The photos of the purity test are all taken after 45 mins and I would read the results as medium to high purity for both samples. I'm not sure how much stock I put into the results though. Perhaps my mind will change after I have tested a sample with low purity and can see what level of sensitivity this test can provide."
MDMA,39nmhj,BobbleheadDoll,2,Sat Jun 13 01:11:41 2015 UTC,It seems like they break the purity into categories. What percentages does medium or high correspond to?
MDMA,39mx2i,Supertoasti,5,Fri Jun 12 21:46:27 2015 UTC,Just wait at least a month between rolls. Sounds like you need a dose somewhere between 100 mg and 200 mg--maybe the 100 mg dose was too weak for you.
MDMA,39mx2i,BobbleheadDoll,2,Fri Jun 12 22:09:03 2015 UTC,I know I'm late but I thought I'd say for me personally if I just wait 1 month between rolls it's not nearly as good like you said. But there's a significant difference for me waiting 2 months and a significant difference waiting 3 months. There's a mild difference waiting longer than that but that's why 3 months is my minimum unless there's 2 special events close together. Also the extra anticipation of waiting longer helps by itself.
MDMA,39mx2i,jmsloderb,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:03:04 2015 UTC,"100mg tends to be enough to get you up over the threshold into ""rolling"", but otherwise is a fairly small dose. 200 mg tends to be on the ""high but still with it"" side of doses.  I'd trying playing around with 100mg first dose, 50mg redose at t+ 60/90 mins. usually redose like 20 mins after you get over your first come-up.  and yeah, fun drug, keep trying to space out at least 4 weeks"
MDMA,39mx2i,Spinster444,2,Fri Jun 12 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna sleep soon, so I won't response before next day. I will try a bit more and follow the tip of /u/BobbleheadDoll next time with around 130mg and redose about 50%. My pause until then will be around 6+ weeks, the date isn't set yet. I want to smoke weed before and through it to see how it works with mdma for me. I'm excited and gonna report my experience :)"

MDMA,39mn5y,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:53:28 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I could tell at the 15 minute mark. The come up was so strong that I knew it was absorbed.  I'd honestly never plugged anything before and was skeptical about it... but only had a 100mg and wanted the full experience. It was... odd. Just laid on my side for like 3 mins to make sure nothing would drip, then got up and went about the day and suddenly got hit by a truck 15 mins later.  edit  Emptied gelcap into bowl, added 5ml water, used super thin syringe with very soft tip. Lay down on side. 1 inch in. Shame. Empty syringe. Lay on side for a minute or two to be sure. More shame. Go about the day. :P"

Yeah, this is the best part about rolling alone. Make sure you listen to all of your favorite songs!! Hey Jude is a GREAT song!

I'm worried it might not be as good for me since it's only a week and most suggestions I've seen say 3weeks-1month between rolls is best... but honestly I'd much rather do a test dose to make sure all is legit and have a weaker time next week in group than pass out some shit I'm not sure of.  Actually... I just started playing Fallout 3. I was frustrated that I couldn't find all 3 leaking pipes in Megaton, but when I found the last one I was actually happy that the people of the town wouldn't have to worry about their water supply.

MDMA,39mn5y,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:26:46 2015 UTC,"Okay, yeah, it might not be as intense next time. But, actually, given that this will be your second time rolling, you might not have an issue: I never did when I first started rolling. But, in the future, I would strongly advise waiting at least 1-2 months between rolls, longer if you can.   I was actually happy that the people of the town wouldn't have to worry about their water supply. I was honestly satisfied I'd helped imaginary people. o_O   Haha, you must be deeply empathetic.

MDMA,39og1k,MandyDandyWithCandy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:02:45 2015 UTC,If you want faster come up try plugging it
MDMA,39og1k,yellowfinger,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:38:02 2015 UTC,"or snorting it. But careful, you have to make sure you have clean clean shit so you don't have to use a lot (70mg is more than plenty) and and crush it very VERY well, otherwise you will get scabs/bleeding in your nose.   Overall ingestion is the best option, just wait 2 or so hours before dropping at least and don't eat greasyass food before either. Don't fast all day like half the idiots on this sub, it's not healthy and doesn't give your body what it needs for a long night of partying. That's why a lot of people wake up feeling like shit, not even the MDMA but it's simply not eating all day and night and dancing and sweating out everything your body has and then not replenishing anything before going to bed."

MDMA,39lncr,Rolf_Savile,5,Fri Jun 12 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"If it persists for more than a month I'd say get some medical advice from a doc (don't worry, they won't get you in trouble)  Your nasal passages are probably extremely inflamed and sliced to pieces.  Remember, MDMA is crystalline even though it may seem like a fine powder, and its sharp as fuck.  One thing that will help stop the bleeds when they happen is a product called ""Nasal-Cease"".  Its a coagulant that you put in your nose that helps clotting.  You can find it at almost any drug store (I get nose bleeds completely unrelated to drug use all the time and I get mine from Walgreens).  Sometimes they are behind the pharmacy counter.  Hope this helps..."
MDMA,39lncr,rocketno40,3,Fri Jun 12 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"to continue my thought...  it's possible you've ruptured some vessels in your nose with the sharp crystals of the mdma too.  Most of the time your body is able to heal these over but sometimes it can't, either because of too much stress (allergies, nose blowing, etc.) or other reasons.  An ENT can fix these types of things really quickly with silver nitrate swabs and you'll be nosebleed free when you leave.  So, definitely if this has been persisting a month, I would see an ENT about it."
MDMA,39lncr,rocketno40,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:10:36 2015 UTC,"Hey man, thanks for the advice, I'll check that stuff out it sounds really awesome, biggest pain in the butt is getting the bleeds to stop, they only go on for about two minutes but I end up having like four in a row off where I try to clean up, so a coagulant agent would be perfect.   I've always had a awful noes when it comes to bleeding never really thought it would get that bad of such sparse use though, suppose you live and learn.  Cheers so much though bud, I'll wait it out a bit and fingers crossed I don't have to get it my noes cauterized which is what I was dreading."
MDMA,39lncr,B42m0row,2,Sat Jun 13 18:16:47 2015 UTC,"I only have one thing to say, sniffing the MDMA destroys your nasal  region even more than cocaine. I would recommend just dropping a bomb and waiting 30min to get high instead of sniffing it and rape your nose. Although thats up to you to decide wether or not you want to continue nosebleeds"

MDMA,39jmyq,Spinster444,2,Fri Jun 12 18:46:45 2015 UTC,"MDA dosage is usually ~70% of what you'd take with MDMA. It lasts a bit longer, can induce more visuals (especially closed eye visuals for me), and is a bit more energetic/speedy. I personally like it more for events where the music is going to be banger-centric.  It is worse for you, and you will feel speedier/more cracked out (especially on the come-down), but sometimes the duration and energy it brings over MDMA is more fun.  Super fun drug, but not MDMA."

MDMA,39i5hd,IIFellerII,3,Fri Jun 12 01:59:40 2015 UTC,"Before I didn't even feel comfortable dancing drunk/stoned/sober or in any state, I just felt like I can't, I have never tried, I probably look shitty. Now since I have done MDMA a couple of times it felt better, but nothing to feel confident or good about, and stayed away from dancing.   Since the last time I took a pill, it was a beautiful evening, entered a morning bar with a lot of people on MDMA and very good music for that situation, so I took a half. While I started feeling it I just chilled at the couch and suddenly I began to feel the music in my body. After a while I got up and started dancing just on the motion I felt in my body. I was dancing for a few morning hours...  Next day, new evening, was chilling having a booze and I just still felt the music, that day I also got complimented on my ""moves"" by a friend of a close friend and just told him I have never learned it, I just went with it. Since that evening I'm not shy about dancing or afraid somebody is looking at me anymore, just going with the music"

MDMA,39mnmp,Vollinkv2,9,Fri Jun 12 20:37:30 2015 UTC,You sound irresponsible.  Terrible idea to roll at that party.  Do some reading before picking it up again.
MDMA,39mnmp,CoffeeNSquats,-4,Fri Jun 12 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"i realize going to work on it was not the best decision in my life, but no one noticed or said anything about my pupils being the size of quarters the whole day"
MDMA,39mnmp,CoffeeNSquats,5,Fri Jun 12 20:50:33 2015 UTC,"Just because they didn't directly say it to you, doesn't mean they didn't notice.  You'd be surprised what little ticks or actions you do while rolling that others notice.    Is this your first time rolling?"
MDMA,39mnmp,BrinxJob,3,Fri Jun 12 20:52:12 2015 UTC,That's super true man.. People always think they look sober when they're super fucked up.

MDMA,39mnmp,RandallWho,6,Fri Jun 12 21:01:34 2015 UTC,You clearly know absolutely nothing about limits dude. Look up how neurotoxic this stuff is before defending a three day binge.
MDMA,39mnmp,BobbleheadDoll,2,Fri Jun 12 23:52:09 2015 UTC,"JFC man he isn't talking about the work part.  If you care about your serotonin levels, don't go rolling 3 days in a row."
MDMA,39mnmp,RandallWho,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:27:11 2015 UTC,"Without getting into the ""right"" or ""wrong"" of it, I would just say its a waste of good mdma (assuming you have good mdma).  Any roll you get on day 2 or day 3 is going to be crap compared to what you would have gotten with some kind of break."
MDMA,39mnmp,BobbleheadDoll,-3,Sat Jun 13 02:44:47 2015 UTC,good or bad idea and why   Most people will tell you bad idea dont do it. and then they will tell  you why. you would think for the number of time i have seen it would know but i dont.  The official /r/mdma line. is not dont do it. its bad for you. here are xyz studies that say it is.  me personally though? fuck it if you want to do it go for. you wont kill yourself or do permanent noticeable damage.  you might however not roll or not roll as hard and you may have worse comedown.
MDMA,39mnmp,RandallWho,4,Fri Jun 12 21:28:57 2015 UTC,"you wont kill yourself or do permanent noticeable damage.   Not necessarily. If his come down is so bad that he become depressed, and he already has depression himself, this might not be good.  Also, the long-term effects of MDMA damage will probably appear several years later, like they did for me.  So, if he is going to roll like that anyway, then there is no point to say, ""No, don't do it."" He is going to do it anyway. But if he is going to do it anyway, he should do it in a way that is more responsible. For example, wait as long as possible between redoses. Take less MDMA. Take antioxidants. Eat well. Exercise."
MDMA,39mnmp,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:12:50 2015 UTC,Out of curiosity what were the long term effects of MDMA damage that you experienced and what was your usage like?
MDMA,39mnmp,psychedelic_dude,4,Fri Jun 12 23:02:17 2015 UTC,"I abused MDMA. Often start the night with 2-3 pills--parachute and swallow. Redose with several more pills throughout the night, sometimes chewing, sometimes snorting. I preloaded with 5-HTP, I was also on Wellbutrin. Sometimes I mixed with weed, alcohol, and cocaine, though not very often. Rolled every week, sometimes two days in a row.  Long-term effects were difficulty in retrieving memories, old or new. Not sure which is more difficult: retrieving older or new memories. Sometimes I feel it is one way; other times i feel another way.   I lose track of information in the middle of conversations. I have trouble ""holding onto"" information and storing information that I just heard. It's terrible. I was never like the before MDMA."

The next day would be euros again, the last day could be euors and acid depends if you want to candyflip or just acid by itself.   There is little to no cross tolerance with 2c-b and acid so you should be fine. Take recommended supplements with MDMA as you will be rolling twice."

MDMA,39hp67,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:04:55 2015 UTC,What does the color chart say? Are we safe in assuming that you did four separate tests of the same pill for each pill?

I do not have experience with testing, but based on teh charts and tests you showed, the batch on the right appears to following the correct color pattern:  1) Darkish-Light purple. Could indicate MDMA, MDE, MDA, or Codeine (seems unlikely).  2) Dark Blue. Could indicate MDMA, MDE, or MDA. Rules out Codeine because final color is not green.  3). Black ? (difficult to tell). Could indicate MDMA, MDE, or Methoxetamine. You can rule out the latter one because this did not show up in the other tests.  4). Light blue. Could indicate, MDMA, MDE, methamphetamine, methylne, butylone, PMMA, or Ritalin. You can rule out everyone except for MDMA or MDE based on results of other tests.  Seems to me that you have MDMA or MDE."

MDMA,39hp67,B42m0row,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:05:04 2015 UTC,"I do not have experience with this, but it may just have to do with variations in scooping the poweder and the amount of powder or in the amount of test reagent.

MDMA,39i80n,littlelionel10,3,Sat Jun 13 00:34:19 2015 UTC,"So either painter's tape or scotch tape are the best type to use - most stick with the least pain removing.  You basically just take the bag and tape all 4 sides down.  If we are really getting graphic, I've actually found it easier to tape it on the front part of the sack, so that the bag is between your nuts and your dick.  Once you tape it, jump up and down and walk a little bit to make sure it will stay there.  Hope this helps."

MDMA,39i368,phacid,2,Thu Jun 11 22:21:49 2015 UTC,"people drinking can be annoying while you're rolling.   And a club has so much social stigma attached to it, how you should act etc., that it can over-shadow and cloud a roll.  roll with other people that are rolling at a more open event (house party, festival, whatever) and you'll notice the empathy and euphoria more.  don't eat for a few hours before, don't drink more than a couple drinks.  also, MDMA isn't as much of an upper as people make it out to be. Try MDA (""sass"") if you're looking for a more stimmed energetic roll. dose ~70% of an mdma dose. fair warning though, more energetic high comes with worse comedown, and MDA is worse for you."
MDMA,39i368,baconmma,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:00:09 2015 UTC,"The first time I did it, I was extremely interested in people's problems and wanted them to feel better/ overcome them. I also really wanted to open up and talk about my own problems and be optimistic about the future. I was with my friends who were also rolling but I don't think it should matter that much. I don't think you would really be aware that other people (who aren't rolling) might not be as enthusiastic as you. I could be wrong though."

MDMA,39i368,BobbleheadDoll,-2,Fri Jun 12 00:07:15 2015 UTC,"You thin you took too much? What if you took too little?

MDMA,39go23,brinnamang,4,Thu Jun 11 17:07:42 2015 UTC,2.5 points is 250 mg. You said you were shmacked when you took that. Why do you want to start with 300 mg?  It's more feasible to to take 200 mg then redose with 50 mg every so often. Or even start with 150 mg. But redosing is still not good for you.
MDMA,39go23,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:13:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm thinking about taking a bit out of the second capsule so I end up taking about 2.5 again.

You must take other supplements with it in order for it to help replenish serotonin in the brain and not just your periphery (like EGCG and Vitamin B6).  refer to rollsafe for more info on this there are also all in one supplements that contain everything out there for sale as well

MDMA,39fq2r,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:54:54 2015 UTC,"As /u/BetweenTwoCities has said before:   The ELI5 for MDMA is like this: You have a bucket of serotonin that gets flushed into your brain every time you roll. However, the bucket has a very slow drip rate - that is it does not replenish too quick. This is one of the reasons why people advocate for the minimal one month break - the bucket gets refilled to an acceptable level.   So yeah, you probably have a bigger tolerance now as you only rolled 10 days ago. Even though you didn't take as much last time it still depleted your serotonin levels and now there's not much to roll with. The recommended time between rolls is 3 months to allow your brain to heal itself and also for not losing the magic!"
MDMA,39i7u2,budgee,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:03:00 2015 UTC,"Yea, wait at least 12hrs...take it at night...and take it with helper supplements like EGCG and B6, otherwise it'll just speed up the creation of serotonin in your periphery and not your brain."
MDMA,39efqk,mdmathrowaway6969,38,Thu Jun 11 04:41:04 2015 UTC,Don't . Just don't. She's on anti-depressants and Abilify(correct me if I'm wrong) is usually prescribed on top of another anti-depressant because her primary anti-depressant does not have much effect.  And I'm assuming she's taking these because she suffers from depression? I would say no. For her sake. I've been there and took MDMA when I was suffering from depression and taking anti-depressants. It made it worst.
MDMA,39efqk,LumpySpaceWarrior,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:00:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she takes another pill as well, but I forgot what it is called. I think she takes them for a mood disorder, rather than actual ""depression"" though. She's been thinking about not taking her pills for a week and then rolling but... I don't know about that.... /:"
MDMA,39efqk,LumpySpaceWarrior,44,Thu Jun 11 05:07:15 2015 UTC,"Don't do that. The thing about antidepressants or any medications to treat mood disorders is that these drugs ultimately affect your brain chemistry and taken over a course of time for one to see its effects. You can't just stop taking antidepressants when you've been on it for months or weeks. It has to be monitored by your psychiatrist/physician such that they will ween you off or on it.   I would just say no. If you want your girl friend to live a long and healthy life (considering she has mental health issues), you would tell her to stay on her medication and not roll."
MDMA,39efqk,BobbleheadDoll,9,Thu Jun 11 05:19:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is the correct and responsible choice."
MDMA,39efqk,andrewbing,11,Thu Jun 11 05:31:03 2015 UTC,"Based on the fact that you are not aware of ALL the medications she's on I would recommend not rolling. A lot of antidepressants are reversible MAOI's, which in conjunction with mdma can cause a hypertensive crisis and lead to sever serotonin disorder (which is permanent) or even death. Also based on some reports from blue light abilify seems some how make mdma less potent which means her roll would not be good anyway. If she is really serious about rolling then she would need to go off all her meds for at least 4 days prior and wait 12-24 hours after rolling to restart them to be safe, also do not take 5HTP beforehand, and wait at least 6-12 hours after she is completely rolled down to use any. It should also be noted that psycological disorders seem to be exacerbated by mdma and she may want to avoid it anyway since the risk is pretty high. If you can find a COMPLETE list if meds she's on look up how the react with mdma on your own BEFORE giving her any advice.  Sorry for any spelling or grammar errors, in on mobile."
MDMA,39efqk,Borax,2,Thu Jun 11 06:08:41 2015 UTC,It's pretty rare for MAOIs to be prescribed now but the rest of your point is still valid.

MDMA,39efqk,Borax,3,Thu Jun 11 19:41:08 2015 UTC,Antipsychotics will largely block the effects of MDMA and people with mood disorders need to be very careful with MDMA anyway. Not worth it.  What might be worthwhile is speaking to the psychiatrist about moving to alternative treatments - antipsychotics are very heavy duty for what you suggest is a minor mood disorder. Psychiatric medications are often overprescribed in the US where therapy would be just fine.

MDMA,39efqk,ThePsychonaut420,0,Thu Jun 11 06:32:33 2015 UTC,"Ignorant to what? All those mood stabilisers and anxioltics are band aids to a root cause. You're treating the symptoms and doing nothing for the disorder, once you find a better balance there's no need for them. I have watched pharma meds pretty much fry my mothers brain into nothing over the last 20 years. We barely have 50 years of history with these medications and neurochemistry."
MDMA,39efqk,PsychedelicVisions,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:59:29 2015 UTC,"If you're not a doctor you have no place to tell anyone what to do.   I don't love those meds either but for some people they are literally a lifesaver.   The amount of suicides that have been reduced from people suffering bipolar disorder and depression objectively proves the worth of pharmaceutical antidepressants and mood stabilizers.   Are people over diagnosed? Yes.  Are they over prescribed? Yes.   Those two thing are true but they don't eliminate the good they do and the lives they save.  Yes you're right we have barely 50 years of history with these meds but we have a hell of a lot less information and studies on MDMA which you so brazenly prescribed taking up to 4 times a year. Not to mention any pharmaceutical will be of higher quality and more pure than most MDMA people are going to find. Seriously think about what you're saying.   MDMA isn't a cure either. There IS NO CURE for bipolar disorder or serious depression, the best you can do is hope to balance the brain chemistry and make the quality of life better. You do realize this isn't a ""crutch"" as you so condescendingly said, this is an imbalance in the brain, a real physical illness, not something you just make better by doing some yoga and exercising let alone taking molly in a non clinical or therapeutic setting.   I'm sorry your mother had a shitty doctor and was misdiagnosed, but your anecdotal story doesn't overrule thousands of lives saved and made better for people suffering with debilitating mental disorders."
MDMA,39efqk,ThePsychonaut420,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:32:50 2015 UTC,"Last line of my reply...   But everyone is different.   I have been properly diagnosed as; Bi-polar disorder 2 Major depressive disorder Generalized anxiety disorder ADHD Treatment resistant to most medications during a bad psychosis it goes on. I've seen psychiatrists and psychologists. I'm off meds and I'm still alive at 32. that's my story and its worked well for me. And I never said MDMA would cure anything but there is more clinical trial research going into it than most other marketable substances. I agree with you on pretty much everything you mentioned, you didn't really have to argue that for the sake of it. friends of mine are alive because they found the right path. Do we need to start putting disclaimers on all our posts. If you are taking a medication that is supposed to be balancing brain chemistry its likely not a good idea to take any psychoactive compounds. I quit mirtazapine cold turkey one day, and had to wait a year till I felt like i was clear for a roll or trip."

Glad we could be amicable I appreciate it
MDMA,39efqk,ThePsychonaut420,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:49:11 2015 UTC,"I like to stir ideas and conversation, its what stimulates us more than anything out there. But there are many studies around the world helping us understands the things we once banned, and that's why the information is so crucial, because its being scrutinized and hindered so much they are taking every avenue and angle to prove its worth, unlike big pharma who may have scientist and chemists with good intentions, but they are still a business model. John Hopkins U has entire studies dedicated to MDMA, psilocybin and lsd, tell me the same has ever been done for lithium compounds or paroxetine.  I tried to find what I could on mirtazapine and came up pretty empty and that was my shrinks prized med for some reason. I had to quit it, it turned me into something very strange during my treatment."
MDMA,39efqk,only_spoons,-2,Thu Jun 11 21:06:17 2015 UTC,"I know various friends who take anti depressants and/or anti psychotics who take MDMA on a night out. Nearly all of them have experience taking MDMA when they weren't on such medication, and their report is that they do not roll properly. The drugs they are taking dampen the effect. So I think one concern would be that in order to try to feel the roll more, a person might take too much MDMA and experience serotonin syndrome as a result of this and the other medication.   I'm not a doctor so do not take this is as fact, but I'm not sure it would actually be dangerous to take a normal dose (100-150mg) MDMA whilst on anti depressant or anti psychotic. It just wouldn't do as much and your risk of serotonin syndrome from taking more MDMA would be higher."
MDMA,39f7nz,ErdeTyrene,2,Thu Jun 11 09:08:25 2015 UTC,"Thought I'd add my 2cents. I know what you mean by mdma being mellow, I find this to be case with mdma that's really high in purity.  Usually leaves my friends and I in a big cuddle session with wobbly legs! I've done the mdma and mda combo a bunch of times, I prefer it to either drug alone as they synergise perfectly. It's very energetic and very very euphroic, and there's also a slight visual element to the roll as well. Wouldn't hurt to take a lot of supplements with this combo, expect your eyeballs to shake hard and your teeth to chatter haha. Redosing really drains you however, more so than redosing mdma when you do it alone.   All depends on what dose you take and what ratio of the mix you make it of course. Hope this has helped!"
MDMA,39f7nz,Xtaldeemt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:58:11 2015 UTC,"That sounds pretty sick to me. I'm basically after a high energy roll, without having to throw straight amphetamine into the mix. What you have described sounds like what I'm after for a festival and dancing.   What ratio do you do and do you take the mdma and mda at once or is your dose staggered?"
MDMA,39f7nz,Xtaldeemt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:55:42 2015 UTC,"I usually do 50/50, but I do this knowing that mda is a little bit more potent than mdma. 50/50 is actually a little more mda heavy but not by much. i prefer this for the strong body rush that mda gives me, it's perfect for dancing like you want but go easy your first time lol.  I cap them both together in one cap, about 100mg + 100mg. That's my personal high dose and I don't recommend that to you without any experience it might be overwhelming. The mdma always feels like it kicks in first as mda takes a little longer, but before long it does and you really feel yourself start crackling with energy and extra euphoria, plus the enhanced visuals has a incredible magical feel to it"
MDMA,39f7nz,only_spoons,2,Thu Jun 11 21:50:38 2015 UTC,"I'll be interested in people's answer to this but I have something to add from my own side. It seems to me that maybe you have been using MDMA a bit too much as what you are saying about it's effect on you now seems like classic ""magic wearing off"" stuff. I think it maybe time to consider a long tolerance break. Continuing to use MDMA and other drugs is not likely to make your experiences any better.   I know it's tempting to keep chasing after that magical ""first time MDMA"" feeling but you can only keep experiencing the true wonder of it if you leave lots of space between rolls."
MDMA,39f7nz,only_spoons,6,Thu Jun 11 10:43:51 2015 UTC,"I'd really rather this be kept on topic. I understand what your saying, but I don't roll anymore than every 2-3 months. This isn't about tolerance or losing any magic. I really like mdma, but I personally find its effects to be not all that energetic. So that's what this thread is about, thanks"
MDMA,39f7nz,B42m0row,-7,Thu Jun 11 10:52:54 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but every 2-3 months is still pretty regular. I am not surprised you don't feel as energetic on the MDMA any more."
MDMA,39f7nz,only_spoons,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:55:55 2015 UTC,"If you lose the magic at this rate, meh thats too bad for you. I myself take breaks of 2months, 1 month during the festival season and i havent lost neither that stimulant effect or the magic. Although i have had a a couple of couch locked rolls, and strangely it was on small doses, no more than 120mg, which led me to believe it was high purity. Its not the first time i hear that higher purity leads to this stoned high, just like Xtaldeemt said. Although i wouldnt say for sure because i dont have the opportunity of lab testing. Anyway, to come back to the ""losing the magic"" my dealer roll every fucking week or so, sometimes twice in a week, and i believe he havent lost the magic, although is tolerance is in the roof now. But hes an idiot dont start rolling each week, even worst if you sometimes mix with cocaine like he does.  Edit: I want to add that it probably isnt the same for everyone. One might lose the magic faster than another for some psychological or physiological factor which i dont know anything about"
MDMA,39f7nz,threeinchesoffury,-1,Thu Jun 11 13:43:12 2015 UTC,"I know people who roll weekly and claim to be feeling the same effects they always do. Personally, I'm gonna call bullshit on that.

MDMA,39hea4,interwebsmeow,2,Thu Jun 11 18:56:54 2015 UTC,"Hey forest fam, I would advise against doing it two days in a row. The second day you will feel much less of the desired effects and feel more of the not so desirable effects as your serotonin will be mostly depleted from the first day. I did it once before and I very much so regretted it.   I will be there as well, and I'm doing lsd everyday (with progressively bigger doses to counter tolerance build up) and only doing mdma only on Saturday for nectar and russliquid."
MDMA,39hea4,Fbulol,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:35:47 2015 UTC,Okay so would Thursday and saturday be better? Cheese and nectar on saturday is when i would love to be rolling.  Thanks for the honest advice!
MDMA,39hea4,Fbulol,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:38:39 2015 UTC,"Your serotonin takes a long time to normalize. At minimum people say 1 month but 3 months is more around the  actual time it takes to get back to 100% I sort of think about it like a gas tank, doing everyday activities depletes it a little bit but mdma is like putting the pedal to the floor and burning all of it at once. Your body regenerates it but it takes time.  If you HAVE to do it you can, but like I said the second roll won't be nearly as powerful and you'll get more teeth grinding and general scatter brained/feeling exhausted. It's possible to roll twice in a short period but don't make a habit of it, because you could easily get burnt out to the point where even a 6 month break wouldn't be enough to feel the magic anymore."

MDMA,39g0vj,tolderoll156,2,Thu Jun 11 20:07:07 2015 UTC,Is there a specific way or a tutorial for how to do that successfully ?
MDMA,39g0vj,tolderoll156,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:59:33 2015 UTC,"You can access The Secret Chief for free at the link. It's very short and excellent. Here's a quick discussion of the group trip, because it touches specifically on MDMA, which is pretty much the same approach as for individuals:   Jacob: We all gather in the living room again and we have our dropping ceremony, which is a very nice ceremony. After everybody’s dropped, they wander around, they’re quiet. We ask them to still be quiet, until they feel themselves starting to turn on. Before that they’ve staked out tripping spaces, which may or may not be different from the sleeping spaces. If there’s two people coming together as a couple we want them to trip in different parts of the house, whereas they might have slept together.  When they start to turn on, they go to their pads, lie down, put the eyeshades on and the earphones on and there’s music playing already. They just lay there until they turn on. The only time we ever hear from them is when somebody feels they haven’t turned on and want a booster. They’ll call one of us over. Or if they have to get up and pee later on. We’ve got it down now so we know everybody’s dosage, so we rarely have to give a booster. They lay on their pads, and we’re in the kitchen sitting and talking and all that stuff and waiting, just being available.  Myron: All the time they’re really in it, they’re laying there listening to music?  Jacob: Right.  Myron: You don’t encourage any interrelationship.  Jacob: No! We don’t want anybody to talk. Sometimes, somebody when they have MDMA, Jesus Christ, you know, they want to hold hands, it’s so loving and all that. That’s all right. If somebody doesn’t want to hold hands, they’re on a different material, all they have to do is hold their hand back and everybody respects their position. The MDMA people like to get up and do some hugging and then we set them right back down. We’ll all hug them, they’ll call us over just for a big hug. They’re so full of love, it’s really fantastically beautiful.   MAPS also has a free book of accounts of using MDMA for personal growth Through the Gateways of the Heart where you can get good ideas for how different people approach their set and setting.  For me, the most important part is setting an intent going into the session. Make it a part of the dropping ceremony. Don't lay down or start meditating too early, or the come-up gets distracting.  Ralph Metzer says:   The    questions, purposes, or agenda brought to a therapy-oriented MDMA session, as discussed above, basically set the tone of the experience. Whatever unfolds during the experience seems to be, in a sense, an answer to those questions— even though this may not become apparent until much later. Most therapists suggest to the voyager to go first as far and deeply within as he can, to the core or ground of being, to his High Self— or similar directions. From this place of total centeredness, compassion and insight, one can then review and analyze the usual problems and questions of one's life. It is not uncommon for people to feel and report to the therapist that all their questions and problems have been dissolved in the all embracing love and compassion that they are feeling. Even with such an initial state of total unity and transcendence, it is often helpful later to ask the questions, and perhaps record one's answers or comments, on tape for post-session review."
MDMA,39g0vj,Fbulol,3,Fri Jun 12 14:27:01 2015 UTC,It's less about you and more focused on others and relationships. Psychedelics are more introspective.  You can get psyches easily in any country by ordering from dark net markets. Check out /r/darknetmatkets

MDMA,39d34w,RONC55,2,Thu Jun 11 00:28:25 2015 UTC,You're opinion on these? I've tried the blue tesla's and those were good. Are these similar? Better?
MDMA,39d34w,RONC55,2,Thu Jun 11 00:30:31 2015 UTC,I personally haven't gotten a chance to try them or the blue ones yet. But I have heard many great things about them from my friends. My understanding is that the orange ones are a higher dose than the blue ones.
MDMA,39d34w,lastkoruptor,5,Thu Jun 11 00:37:41 2015 UTC,Thanks man. I appreciate it. Looking forward to EDCLV next weekend with these bad boys!
MDMA,39d34w,yellowkittenkisses,3,Thu Jun 11 00:42:29 2015 UTC,No problem. See you out there ;)
MDMA,39d34w,xxxkandithroaway,2,Thu Jun 11 00:46:53 2015 UTC,"Yup, me too!"
MDMA,39d34w,repr1zero,0,Thu Jun 11 13:25:16 2015 UTC,we've got some ourselves to try at edc too! yay!
MDMA,39d34w,RONC55,2,Thu Jun 11 06:57:12 2015 UTC,I heard the blues had sass
MDMA,39d34w,RONC55,2,Thu Jun 11 11:15:19 2015 UTC,How were the Blue ones? Just copped a few myself
MDMA,39d34w,loopaddy,3,Thu Jun 11 16:38:15 2015 UTC,"Very quick to hit. I took half, then took the other half about an hour later. I was smiling more than usual. Chatting with buddies. Having a great time amongst friends. Then it got intense. Teeth started to grind and roll picked up substantially. Lasted a while too. Overall, a great time."
MDMA,39d34w,LReyes66,2,Thu Jun 11 19:33:06 2015 UTC,It's the lighting. They're definitely orange. I can take a better pic when I get home.
MDMA,39d34w,porofo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:25:35 2015 UTC,sorry to tell you but those look like the fake ones being made in cali. Here is a thread on this already http://redd.it/3awuk0 Basically 3 versions. V1 is crumbly pinkish orange with specks. V2 is hard pressed pinkish orange with low to no specks made from same supplier. The ones you have from the picture look like some fakes that are almost red with specks.
MDMA,39d34w,porofo,2,Thu Jun 11 00:27:27 2015 UTC,I def have the bottom one. Wonder if they r from same supplier.
MDMA,39d34w,porofo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:24:58 2015 UTC,Most likely. They probably just contain less mdma.
MDMA,39d34w,porofo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:25:37 2015 UTC,Did you test these?
MDMA,39d34w,rickytannRUSH,2,Wed Jun 10 23:29:23 2015 UTC,Yup with a marquis and black light
MDMA,39d34w,MicklesCuz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:41:27 2015 UTC,My friend had some of these and they looked exactly like the bottom ones and they had a bad trip and thought it was cut with something else.(no test kit)
MDMA,39d34w,Johnnyring0,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:46:36 2015 UTC,Interesting.. maybe it was just bad vibes. I just tested another pill and it went purple to black.
MDMA,39d34w,Johnnyring0,2,Wed Jun 10 23:48:06 2015 UTC,Oh and I meant they look just like the top ones. Another thing they were puking and having insane visuals all night
MDMA,39d34w,cock_almighty,2,Thu Jun 11 00:03:50 2015 UTC,Oh the top ones are the og ones that are tested at 250. That would definitely cause an inexperienced person to have a bad time.
MDMA,39gugc,bobthetrucker,3,Thu Jun 11 17:01:40 2015 UTC,Has that combo ever been tried by humans before? I doubt you'll get a proper answer. Consider the
MDMA,39boah,Senor_Zoidberg,4,Wed Jun 10 17:55:20 2015 UTC,green trip advisors are the shit. so damn good
MDMA,39boah,Weed4TheFree,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:22:29 2015 UTC,Pink Teslas?
MDMA,39boah,CoffeeNSquats,2,Wed Jun 10 18:11:36 2015 UTC,Orange legomans and green trip advisors
MDMA,39boah,peonyourface,3,Wed Jun 10 19:09:35 2015 UTC,"No no, in the background you can see Pink Teslas as well.  Copycats!"
MDMA,39boah,CoffeeNSquats,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:12:36 2015 UTC,Yeah i cant find any info on them i remember seeing a post about ones that glow under black light i feel like these glow
MDMA,39boah,CoffeeNSquats,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:40:04 2015 UTC,Those were the orange teslas.  There's also the blues out by a different presser... but these pink ones are new to me.
MDMA,39boah,andrewbing,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:56:17 2015 UTC,Those Legomen are AMAZING!
MDMA,39boah,azilt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:34:08 2015 UTC,Can I just please ask how can you afford all of that..maybe because I live in southern hemisphere it's supper experience here?..
MDMA,39boah,derpnt,2,Thu Jun 11 11:03:34 2015 UTC,Maybe buying for a whole group
MDMA,39d4h6,snappyM,7,Wed Jun 10 23:29:30 2015 UTC,"Depends on how long you're willing to wait - the longer, the better. I'd say a minimum of six months. 8-12 would be great, especially if you're under 21ish years old, but I know that's not a fun answer.  Congrats on being responsible after the fact and asking! Your brain will thank you :)"
MDMA,39d4h6,DrugEducator,2,Wed Jun 10 23:38:43 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with this--the longer the better, especially because you rolled so much. The more times you roll that frequently, the worse off you will be."
MDMA,39d4h6,BobbleheadDoll,4,Thu Jun 11 05:33:16 2015 UTC,"/u/DrugEducator has given you a great time table.  On a side note, do you test your product? It always blows my mind when people take this much MDMA when I can't even think of myself taking 300mg."
MDMA,39d4h6,idafje,2,Wed Jun 10 23:50:18 2015 UTC,"Actually that's a good question. Did you test it? If so, disregard the rest of this. If not, unless it was a really long night over which you spaced out those half grams, you might have been taking methylone or something else (which, if you didn't test it, is pretty likely given the drug scene right now). If it was methylone, then the timeline will be pretty similar since it is generally agreed to have cross-tolerance with MDMA. But if it was meth or something else, the only upside to that scary situation is that your tolerance for MDMA might be OK.   In sum, teeeeeessstt eeeeverryyyythhinnnnggg"
MDMA,39d4h6,DrugEducator,2,Thu Jun 11 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"The first two times I was on vacation and did not have access to a testing kit. After my heavy half gram plus night that was mostly negative side effects, I really did not want to roll a second night but my best friend pressured me into doing so. I only took one dose that night but it could have been 200-400mg now that i'm thinking about it. My most recent roll I was at home and the product was tested to be mdma.  I just feel terrible because my SO did this with me and these were her real first times. I believe she did way too much and I fear I have potentially ruined this drug for her. I really want to try this again but alone with her, at a way lower dose, and no redosing so she can fully feel the love/empathy/energy that comes with this drug. I just wanted to see how long I should wait before we try this again. I was at least going to wait until October but reading your guy's responses I might even push it to new years or later. I want her too see the true beauty of this substance not the tweaky speedy high you get from large doses."
MDMA,39d4h6,DrugEducator,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:14:28 2015 UTC,I have talked to her about it and she does enjoy it. I just feel like all the negatives that came during the comedown/post roll were a little rough on her. She took so much her first time that she was so floored she can't even remember everything the first night. The other two rolls were probably subpar for her just because of how much she took that first time.  I would much rater her have a week long after glow than be tweaking all night.
MDMA,39d4h6,GekkoPie,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:30:13 2015 UTC,That's really great that you have so much respect for what it can do for both of you :)  EDIT: As opposed to taking it for granted and just wanting to get high...
MDMA,39d7l1,h8fatppl,7,Wed Jun 10 23:51:45 2015 UTC,I'd like to see more posts about experiences with the substance including images as well.
MDMA,39d7l1,hehslop,5,Thu Jun 11 02:27:40 2015 UTC,Pills look cool.
MDMA,39d7l1,rickytannRUSH,7,Thu Jun 11 03:19:01 2015 UTC,"Mostly because presses are more recognizable than a bag of stuff. As long as you test it, you're good to go."
MDMA,39d7l1,idafje,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:11:52 2015 UTC,Mdma rocks can also have potential cuts.
MDMA,39d7l1,WilrikDeBaas,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:18:52 2015 UTC,I just wanted to clarify.
MDMA,39d7l1,WilrikDeBaas,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:25:58 2015 UTC,"I love both crystal MDMA and pills, and I buy whatever is available to me. But most of the time I now buy 1/2g of MDMA and then 2 pills to have a solid night of buzz. I do this because the pills can get you more buzzy for your money but I also love the feeling of sniffing it up my nose so that's why I buy the 1/2 of sniff"
MDMA,39d7l1,GalsDemSugar,0,Thu Jun 11 11:26:22 2015 UTC,Question from someone who has not had pills : are they flavored? I hear some people let them dissolve in their mouth but if they are not flavored that would be nasty.
MDMA,39d7l1,SSASERTPO,2,Thu Jun 11 11:30:44 2015 UTC,"Nah they aren't flavored, well I've never had flavored ones. You wouldn't want to let them stay in your mouth as it's taste vile. Best thing to do is just pop it down your throat and enjoy :)"
MDMA,39d7l1,GalsDemSugar,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:03:16 2015 UTC,"It was strange but when I rolled a few weeks back at a local event, I redosed with a quarter of a pill after 90 minutes and i decided to take it sublingually and let it dissolve under my tongue for a faster absorption. I prepared myself for a super disgusting bitter taste but when I put it under my tongue and let it dissolve I actually kinda liked the taste. I mean yeah it was definitely bitter, but it was a weird tasty bitter... lol its hard to describe... Kinda like how grapefruit juice is kinda bitter and weird tasting (I love grapefruit juice), but different.. haha  I dunno if it was just because I was already fairly blasted or what, but I thought it was weirdly tasty.. hahah"
MDMA,39d7l1,n1ll0,2,Thu Jun 11 08:30:31 2015 UTC,It was probably because you were already buzzing. Like for example I hate the first few lines of MD but then when I get buzzy I absolutely love the taste haha
MDMA,39d7l1,GalsDemSugar,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:05:28 2015 UTC,hahaha yeeeeah i was fairly certain this was the case.. hahah it was one of those orange teslas too so it was a super clean and super strong buzz.. hahaa I dunno if i'd do it again though because of how abrasive the chemical is.. I had a canker sore/chemical burn under my tongue where it dissolved and another tiny spot on my tongue where i let the very last little chunk dissolve
MDMA,39d7l1,n1ll0,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:16:17 2015 UTC,Yeah next time it's best to just swallow it whole :p
MDMA,39czsu,HMNE,3,Wed Jun 10 22:57:26 2015 UTC,Test them.

MDMA,39d8lm,SUPRAHH,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:59:16 2015 UTC,I have looked online and I have found no information on these. I'm waiting for my test kit to be shipped so I can test these. They both have the same stamp which is FedEx on the front and pokeball on the back. The Orange one has almost invisible brown specks and the blue one doesn't seem to have any.
MDMA,39d8lm,idafje,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:03:18 2015 UTC,Every single pokeball that I've had/seen in the past 5 years has been shit. I hope this isn't the case for you.
MDMA,39d8lm,GalsDemSugar,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:13:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've noticed that too, about the pokeballs, and I'm hoping that they aren't shit. Well I'm going to test them asap"
MDMA,39d8lm,Frankierulz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:23:42 2015 UTC,Pretty sure I had some of those pills a couple of months back. I took one and then I felt great and then another around 1 hour later and I was buzzing for a good 6 hours without having to re dose. So they are pretty good pills tbh. Had a great night.
MDMA,39ccv2,stonergirl14,2,Wed Jun 10 20:30:37 2015 UTC,"Hey, make sure you read up (dancesafe.org & rollsafe.org) and take at least 3 month breaks in between! I was 19 my first time. Hope you have a great roll and be safe, much love."
MDMA,39ccv2,amazingsil,2,Wed Jun 10 22:45:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, the breaks are very important! And take antioxidants afterward, too! Like alpha-lipoic acid and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C)."
MDMA,39ccv2,BobbleheadDoll,2,Wed Jun 10 22:52:11 2015 UTC,WOOOOW itjust keeps going :D i'm sooo ohappyyyy thank you all for the kind advice . Wish i could do this every day but ill wait a few months :)
MDMA,39ccv2,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:36:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely wait several months before using again."
MDMA,39ccv2,suche1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:15:56 2015 UTC,How old are you? I was 21 the first time I tried MDMA. Remember to stay safe and hydrate yourself :)
MDMA,39ccv2,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:33:30 2015 UTC,First time I rolled I was 15 years old. It was fucking amazing. How long ago did you take your pill? And what are you doing right now? There are lots of things you can do to show yourself a good time.
MDMA,39ccv2,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:33:33 2015 UTC,im almost 15 i dont know if there are rules about age and stufff so sorry about that I took the pill about 30 minutes ago and i'm just on my bed looking at my ceiling (it has stars on them !!! theuy are so pretty  but if you have ideas let me know
MDMA,39ccv2,BobbleheadDoll,3,Wed Jun 10 20:37:10 2015 UTC,"Haha, I remember how intense it was at that age. It is going to get even more intense during the come up stage. I am sure that your palms are starting to sweat, the air is feeling heavier and enveloping, and more light is entering your now-dilated pupils. You are still coming up and probably will be for the next 30-45 minutes until you start your peak. This means these feelings are going to keep intensifying.  Do the stars glow in the dark? If so, turn off your lights so that it is as dark as possible in your room. I also suggest putting on some of your favorite music and turning your speakers up really loud. If you have house guests, then put on your headphones. If you don't want house guests to hear you, though, be careful because when I first took ecstasy I was moaning like crazy.  I also suggest that you get the most comfortable blanket or clothing that you have--something with fleece or microfiber--and wrap your body in that or pet it. It is amazing.  Oh, and get some gum. I am sure you are already clenching your jaw very tightly now.  Remember to sip water every few minutes (do not gulp it--you don't want to overdrink water either).  Try to keep your body temperature relatively low--a fan would be good.  Finally, as you are listening to music, staring at the stars, and wrapped in the comfort of something soft, grab some of your favorite lotion and rub your hands with it. Put it on your body. Just go as slowly as you need to explore all of your new, heightened sensations. Remember, stay hydrated, stay cool, and chew some gum."
MDMA,39ccv2,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:48:20 2015 UTC,"thank you for this!! so many ideas yeah the stars glow in the dark they look amazing. i got great music on pretty loud. its really hard to write and type but ill keep trying im home alone so no worries about someone finding me i feel soooo warm, thats the only thing i worry about a little. i'think i got some lotion somewhere so i will try that once i feel it come on harder :)"
MDMA,39ccv2,Gucciburrr,2,Wed Jun 10 20:56:28 2015 UTC,"No problem. If you are heating up, change into lighter clothing, don't wrap yourself in a cozy blanket yet, and you could open a window, turn on the AC, turn on a fan, or splash a little bit of water on your face or neck. Sip some water.  It is probably getting more difficult too look at the computer screen. You can turn on some visuals, too, on your computer with a music player. Those are nice. Strobe lights are good if you have one (but they can be pretty intense).  What kind of music do you listen to? Do you have any electronic music?  Here are two of my favorites to listen to while rolling:  ATC - All Around the World  ATB - Ecstasy  DJ Sammy - We're In Heaven"
MDMA,39ccv2,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:05:19 2015 UTC,"oh i love those songs !! im listening to a lot of stuff like all my favorites, some edc some hardstyle & trance. water feels really nice but it is a little hard to swollow i couldn't take more then a sip if i wanted. really loving it so far ! :D"
MDMA,39ccv2,GaianNeuron,2,Wed Jun 10 21:11:03 2015 UTC,Awesome. You can sometime close your eyes and just let the music take you away. You can also move your head to the music and sway your body to it.  Glad you are enjoying it!

MDMA,39c2hu,icecreamennui,4,Wed Jun 10 19:26:05 2015 UTC,I'd suggest some psychedelics but you haven't any experience and I would never suggest a first drug experience be at a festival. If your event isn't too soon then I'd suggest you experiment a little bit with different substances. If your event is within the next few weeks then I suggest you just stick to MDMA one night and smoke some weed the other nights. Maybe even do a day sober.
MDMA,39c2hu,idafje,2,Wed Jun 10 19:34:57 2015 UTC,"It's at the end of july, so I guess I have time to experiment myself soonish. Which psychedelics would you recommend?"
MDMA,39c2hu,paratrees,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:43:42 2015 UTC,"Can only speak for shrooms. Got a batch of LSD in before a festival this last weekend but didn't want to try it for the first time at a fest. Sold some to some friends and they loved it. Said R Kelly's set changed their lives. According to them (idk if this is or isn't true), you can control yourself a bit more on LSD than you can with shrooms.  Although I'm sure it depends on the dosage.  I had done shrooms a few times before bonnaroo last year and got a hold of some for both Washed Out and James Blake's sets and had an incredible experience (especially James Blake). I just laid on the grass and felt the base come through the ground."
MDMA,39c2hu,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:50:57 2015 UTC,I'm definitely looking for something with more 'control'. I'm leaning towards LSD atm
MDMA,39c2hu,DrugEducator,2,Wed Jun 10 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"There is some control on LSD. It actually feels like a ""clean"" high, even though you are tripping balls. Taking too much, however, could leave you with a really intense trip. Shrooms are pretty strong, too, if you take a big dose. Shrooms give you more of an intense body high--like eating a shit ton of edible marijuana goodies. Anyway, I would experiment with lower doses of each to see what you can handle and still be coherent. Taking too much of either one will have you incapacitated and not remembering much."
MDMA,39c2hu,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:24:37 2015 UTC,I think I'm going to try the LSD at home and see how I react with it. I've been told so many times not to ever take LSD/shrooms if you've had problems with depression/anxiety so I think giving it a go on a low dose will be best. Thank you!
MDMA,39c2hu,LReyes66,3,Wed Jun 10 20:34:20 2015 UTC,"Shrooms and LSD are both great, but I second /u/BobbleheadDoll's recommendation to not try them alone for the first time - do it with a close friend (or two) who is/are stable, kind and trustworthy. If you can be in a forest somewhere even better!"
MDMA,39c2hu,paratrees,2,Wed Jun 10 23:41:05 2015 UTC,"Okay. Be careful, then. Maybe let someone know you are taking it before hand. It would be even better to have a babysitter with you, someone who has taken LSD before. You do not know how you are going to react."
MDMA,39c2hu,LReyes66,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:38:24 2015 UTC,I saw some really freaked out people at rkelly during fpsf. Not saying it was ur friends but ur post reminded me of it lpl

MDMA,39c2hu,monkeytown-awesome,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:06:00 2015 UTC,Yeah you've got some time to play with. I'd try out shrooms and LSD. Leave 2 weeks between the two to get a full experience. Don't want to have to mess with any tolerances. And squeeze 2C-B in there if you can. 2C-B is a pretty forgiving substance IMO so I don't think you'd absolutely need to test that out if you get your hands on LSD and shrooms.
MDMA,39c2hu,hash_smashed,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:54:31 2015 UTC,Have you taken 2C-B? I'm thinking I'll go with either this or LSD and maybe not shrooms since I've been told they're better in a more private/relaxed setting. I'll defo try LSD in the next few weeks to test myself out and then maybe 2C-B too.
MDMA,39c2hu,monkeytown-awesome,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:58:54 2015 UTC,I've had 2C-B quite a few times now. I think it's fantastic as a party drug. It gives me nice stimulation and awesome visuals with a bit of euphoria. Nothing the levels of MDMA but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
MDMA,39c2hu,Multatuli123,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:25:00 2015 UTC,"Ah right, that sounds interesting. I think I'll see if I can get 2-CB. I have a mdma test kit that I'm pretty sure tests for 2-CB. Do you think this will be good enough (looking out for the colour change for 2-CB) or should I buy a 2-CB specific kit if they make those?  Thank you for your help!"
MDMA,39c2hu,yamzinthekitchen,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:33:23 2015 UTC,"I kinda have the same proble, but I was thinking 4fa. Does anyone know if there is a cross tolerance with mdma?"
MDMA,39atss,Zeplove25,6,Wed Jun 10 14:21:45 2015 UTC,"Ask for MDMA, you never know what you'll get until you test it. if he doesn't know what mdma is, find someone else. test kits are close, they will tell you if the drug has MDMA in it.. now how much or if anything else is in it. only  a lab can check that... don't worry TOO much about it to be honest, test, if it's MDMA.. have fun :) if you get a pil, ask how much is in it, if he doesn't know, start with half, then another half after an hour or so...  If you get it in crystal form, you can just weigh it off (get a good scale).    thats pretty much it :) feel free to message me if you have questions"

But you can use a bit of toiletpaper and just swallow that. I know people who just put the crystals in their mouth and swallow it down with some water but it tastes really really bad..."

Another alternative to toilet paper that may be more palatable is cigarette rolling papers.. *shrug but you could probably wrap it in some sort of food. Just make sure to swallow it straight and don't chew it lol.. that would taste terrible.."

Peeing really really hurts when you get a UTI to the point when you need to pee but it hurts so much you don't wanna pee but you have to so you just try and hold in the tears and pee, lol..  Start chugging on some cranberry juice and take your vitamin C's for now! If it gets worse you should go see a doctor for antibiotics. I don't think MDMA on its own could cause UTI but sitting on something cold or just staying outside a tad too long might've something to do with it."

MDMA,3988q1,squelchy04,3,Tue Jun 9 23:34:36 2015 UTC,You can take both together. Continue with your antibiotic dose as normal and roll as usual.
MDMA,3988q1,pharmaninja,2,Wed Jun 10 09:01:49 2015 UTC,Idk about that antibiotic. I had an infection on my toe and my doctor prescribed me antibiotic i was supposed to take 2 times a day. After that i did a little research about taking antibiotics and mdma. I found that SOME antibiotics have CYP34A enzym which breaks down mdma and could be potentially dangerous combining the two. I think if your antibiotic have this enzym you should take half of your usual dose and you should be fine. But most of antibiotics are perfectly safe to do while rolling. I found a list of antibiotics that have this enzym on drugs-forum.com and i would suggest you to find it and see if your antibiotic is there. What i would strongly recommend is NOT TO TAKE ANY KETAMINE as it is proven to do harm to urinary tract. And keep in mind that MDMA weakens your immune system so your recovery from infection could last longer. Cheers :)
MDMA,3988q1,sarklo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:07:07 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for your reply - and yes fully agree on ket, not gonna touch that shit.  Co-amoxiclav is based on Amoxicillin which apparently interacts with the CYP34A enzyme. I'm going to halve my MD dose just in case and see what happens from there. Also going to be taking probiotics and a multivitamin leading up to roll day (and after) to try enhance my immune system."

Because MDMA can sometimes make UTI's worse or even cause them because you don't pee properly whilst rolling. I had my worst UTI exeperience to date after an excellent night out. Since then I've been more careful with UTI prevention when I know I'm going to be rolling - making sure I am drinking water and making myself go to the bathroom when I'm out even if I don't feel like I'm going to be able to. And the next day making sure I don't get dehydrated just because I am too lazy to get out of bed, making sure I eat properly, etc. Are you female? Because peeing after sex also majorly important for helping prevent problems of this nature as well."

MDMA,396nqa,phacid,2,Tue Jun 9 20:54:50 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking that..MDMA IS MDMA and if there were no other tested active substances your roll should be equal at the same dosage from either crew. Now someone will say there are differences between the r and s isomer but thats just shit, when you produce mdma you get 50/50 racemic mdma and to make different ratio of isomers you would need more chemical procedures and production of such mdma takes more time, and after all i think even shlugin wrote in pihkal that racemic mdma has the best effects. And the test centers even include the purity of mdma in pill when testing so i think there can not be such difference of the effects at same dose. Cheers :)"
MDMA,396nqa,sarklo,-1,Tue Jun 9 21:19:18 2015 UTC,"idk too much about the isomer effects, but do you think the purity lvl of the mdma in a press could alter the effect? say you took 2, 200mg doses where one was 84% (the supposed purest form of mdma hcl.) pure while the 2nd was only 1% pure. would you not have a ""cleaner"" or ""better"" high off the 84%? edumacate me reddit!"
MDMA,396nqa,_huckleberryfinn,2,Tue Jun 9 22:15:16 2015 UTC,"If it's 200mg it's 200mg. The purity means that when it's a 60% pure powder for example, only 600mg out of 1gr is actually MDMA."
MDMA,396nqa,phacid,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:41:14 2015 UTC,&what would the leftover 400mgs be? completely inactive chemical compounds? possibly leftover chemical residue from the production procedures? do these chemicals have absolutely no effects on bodily function &behavior?
MDMA,396nqa,_huckleberryfinn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:09:25 2015 UTC,"So you for example have 2 pills. Both tested with 200mg MDMA at test center. But it could be that in one pill there is a greater amount of MDMA.HCL that is less pure than MDMA.HCL which is less amount but more pure. So lets say that the first pill has 280 mg od MDMA.HCL which is 71.5% pure that means there is 200 mg of MDMA in pill. Lets say that in other pill is 238.2 of MDMA.HCL that is 84% pure and that also means there is 200 mg of MDMA. Therefore it is the same amount of MDMA and the effects should be the same. Oh and MDMA.HCL are the crystals you get when buying MDMA so if you buy 1 g of MDMA(.HCL) that is 50% pure, you actually get 500 mg of MDMA. Cheers :)"
MDMA,396nqa,sarklo,-1,Wed Jun 10 13:38:28 2015 UTC,"it's not placebo ;)   I was thinking all the pills were the same things when they contain the same quantity...  I saw differences on the effects with one pill to another, but always good effects.  And one day, new pill (gold bar), very bad effect (not the trip, the days after... and i'm not talking about the traditionnal known sadness effect, as I said, it's a medicine for me ;) ). I retried few time after, exactly the same bad effect...   Maybe there was impurity in that batch? Because I tried in the past the bitcoin pill from the same crew, and I did'nt have any bad effect...

MDMA,395q4h,long_live_mcqueen,6,Tue Jun 9 13:14:56 2015 UTC,"You said you are drinking an adequate amount of water, but could it be possible you are drinking too much? Especially if you are dancing or doing some else very active, as you sweat your body is excreting both water AND electrolytes in your sweat. If you only drink water and no electrolytic drinks (sports drinks, Gatorade, etc) you are replenishing your water reserves but your electrolyte levels are continuing to drop as you sweat. Electrolyte imbalances can cause all SORTS of issues (including death if it becomes bad enough - this is what they are talking about when people warn about water poisoning/drinking too much water while rolling) and I would imagine his would include nausea and vomiting in the earlier stages.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia#Signs_and_symptoms"
MDMA,395q4h,n1ll0,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:54:15 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense actually. I'm planning on drinking emergen-c packets every 2 hours of my roll at this festival. Gatorade wouldn't be a bad idea either. Thank you!
MDMA,395q4h,n1ll0,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:02:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely :) You might wanna search around on here and elsewhere to confirm, but I believe that those Emergen-C packs should actually be sufficient. The solution made when you mix with water is actually hypertonic and takes the place of the sports drink. I always use one of those packets beforehand and then just buy a gatorade at whatever event im at for good measure."
MDMA,395q4h,n1ll0,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:22:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, since you mentioned being at a festival, if you are outside in the sun for long periods of time, especially with high heat, its possible the nausea/vomiting could be from minor heat stroke / heat exhaustion or something similar. It might do to make sure you get some shade and sit down and relax every once in a while, specially if this is like an all day thing."

MDMA,395q4h,threeinchesoffury,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:35:23 2015 UTC,"Sure - Plugging hits faster (30mins) and lasts longer.  I would also say it hits a little harder as well.   - as far as I have read, the absorption rate in your colon is much better at getting into your blood stream over the stomach. Never had it burn the sphincter (use lube) and make sure you get it up there as far as you can.  About 5-10 mins after I take it I tend to want to poop REALLY bad, but it tends to feel mostly like gas buildup (I'm guessing this is why my stomach gets fucked).  However a few mins before it hits, the pressure goes away and fun ensues. I find the easiest way to do this is empty out a capsule (vitamin or the like) and use one half of it - place the crystals in half of the capsule and put a little tissue paper to cover it, lube it, your sphincter and your long finger and.... well... push it up"

MDMA,396ntt,joedizzler,-3,Tue Jun 9 22:04:43 2015 UTC,I done a good 6-8 hours researching alot people say candy flipping l+m is best when consumed together alot of people said if shrooms and m taking together can cause problems at both peak point their for  take the shrooms just before the peak are after to make the M last longer and reduce the comedown while get the effect of truffles but I doubt it will be my last time experimenting ^
MDMA,396ntt,baconmma,2,Tue Jun 9 22:31:54 2015 UTC,when i candy flip or hippy flip i will take the LSD or msuhrooms and the about 4 hours later (or when i am past peak trip) i will roll.  if i dont space it out like that i find that the A) combination is a little overwhelming for me and B) i feel the lsd or mushrooms overpowers the mdma and makes it less enjoyable

Countries that are more tolerant to drug use tend to have better drug education systems. This actually leads to less drug use. I think one of the reasons that mdma use is so high here in the UK is because of prohibition.

MDMA,39398f,Soapy9,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:36:55 2015 UTC,They are probably not even getting much effect from the MDMA anymore either. I know people who do it weekly. From my perspective they certainly seem to need a lot more of it and aren't as excited about it as me.
MDMA,39398f,only_spoons,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:55:12 2015 UTC,Surprisingly they only do it at gigs/raves which tend to be 5-6 months apart. But those who do it weekly truly baffle me; to me that would just completely ruin MDMA for me.

There's not really any way to tell without testing it, but my guess is that if it was a rocky/powdery substance that looked like MDMA, it was probably methylone, which has similar effects, but at about 2 to 3 times the dose. Also, the effects are often described as less empathetic and more tweaky, or stimulant-y, if that makes sense.   You should ALWAYS test anything you are going to ingest."

He's also very dependant on his meds not being able to function without taking his meds in the morning but that's just the price we have to pay.

MDMA,3966qz,MEL_GIBSONS_ASS,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:00:41 2015 UTC,I took one pill excluding the little bit we scrapped off for the test. I have no idea how often the tests don't work or what the accuracy is supposed to be..

MDMA,396f7p,fratagascar,2,Tue Jun 9 16:18:27 2015 UTC,"the best option is to get a test kit, but barring that, if you have access to a black light / uv flashlight, the originals glowed under UV light. I imagine if there WAS a second batch and the second batch DOES come from the same group, they would use the same UV reactive binders and the new batch pills should have the same property.  Again, if AT ALL possible, try to get a test kit before you take them. That way it doesnt really matter if they are a second batch or a knockoff, as long as you know they are MDxx and not a cathinone or other substance.  EDIT: I can confirm the UV reactivity of the originals, as I tested this under a UV flashlight."
MDMA,396f7p,n1ll0,2,Tue Jun 9 18:26:08 2015 UTC,I to have noticed the different orange teslas. Both tested fine with marquis and black light only difference is one is heavily speckled and the other is not.
MDMA,396f7p,ProfessorFarnsworth3,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:27:58 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on the differences? Are they slightly different colors? Any idea if the second batch is dosed differently?

Can't be beaten. I'd thought that I may miss the music but it never crosses my mind.   We were astounded by the water. Just appreciating everything. Hot summers day in Australia. Can't be beaten.

MDMA,394fob,steezyneezy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:22:59 2015 UTC,I've only camped and rolled semi remotely in the States (it was awesome) - a rainforest seems like it would have some animals that could eat you and that would kind of harsh the roll for me.
MDMA,3954ds,TOHRz,4,Tue Jun 9 09:18:16 2015 UTC,"Just go with the flow. Take a shower together, massage each other or do whatever comes to mind. More often than not I have rolled one on one with my SO and even if we'd had in mind to go out clubbing or dancing we have just ended up naked in a cuddle-puddle not wanting to go anywhere, lol.   Just remember to keep yourselves hydrated, especially if this is her first time she might forget to drink enough water... that's happened to me once or twice and passing out because of dehydration is not fun :P"
MDMA,3954ds,suche1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:16:07 2015 UTC,"Showering sounds awesome, thanks! And I already bought some fancy bottle things with straws to drink from, so I'll remind her to drink enough.  By the way, do you know if girls are still into sex while on M? Like we can't get our magic wand up, but do they have a similar thing?"
MDMA,3954ds,BackBreaker,5,Tue Jun 9 10:31:35 2015 UTC,"Everyone is different.  My gf gets wicked in the mood for sexy times when we roll and although it may take a few attempts and some time and patience she/I can reach the big O.  When/If it finally happens I assure you it's one of the best orgasms of your life and I know my gf feels the same way.   But on the other hand don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen.  We've had many times where we go at it for an hour, get tired, and decide to go do something else and continue the sexy times later in the night.    Remember, it's about the journey, not the destination.    More importantly make sure she's mentally sound and keeping up with her water intake.    Ps - totally agree with the comment above; massages and hot showers with your SO are the best while rolling.  10/10 highly recommend."
MDMA,3954ds,BobbleheadDoll,2,Tue Jun 9 11:35:50 2015 UTC,"You can also get some vic's vapor rub or the inhalers. Get some orange juice for the unique taste. Some different flavored gums.  Shower is the best idea. If you have a strobe light, you can blast the music, turn on the strobe light, turn off the lights in the bathroom, and have the best shower of your life. In general, I would just keep the lights off and get some kind of light show thing going constantly along with some music."
MDMA,3954ds,suche1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:04:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds good! :)  Haha, well I can only speak from my personal experience but no, girls don't have a similar thing on MDMA. Sometimes sex feels a bit mundane though when all you want to do is be close to your SO and just feel each other, sometimes it leads to sex but other times not. Getting head on M feels absolutely incredible though"

It's incredible how good you will feel for making your SO feel good.   Oh, and one more thing! Try giving each other shoulder/neck massages. Be careful not to go too hard because you don't always realize your strength on M, but once you get the blood flowing to your brain it can shoot you off to the moon. My friend did this once to me and I literally felt like I was put on a rocketship blasting through space, haha."

MDMA,394gzs,elijahsantos,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:48:36 2015 UTC,"MDMA on it's own is pretty sedative for me so I've tried a few things (I want energy when I roll, otherwise what's the point?).  Anyway, so I've tried caffeine pills a couple of times and one of those times it enhanced the roll a bit but for a short period of time. I've had better luck with amphetamine sulfate (speed). Even 15-25 mg should boost your roll pretty nicely to where you're not rolling face.  Note: Keep in mind adding amphetamines will be more toxic to your body. I completely understand the repercussions of doing so but to me it's well worth it in small doses. Pure MDMA won't give me any energy to dance."

Usually end up going to work, not eating, and then going to the event on an empty stomach.   Almost every single time I rolled I came up in like 30 minutes, peaked HARD for about 1-2 hours, and by that time my redose would be kicking in. I do recommend trying to eat some fruits and vegetables, or anything really if you can because I do get tired during my rolls which is what brings me down.  I use Vicks nasal spray, Purell, and i'll smoke a menthol to get my energy up. Haven't had the chance to have a red bull while rolling so I couldn't help you there."

MDMA,392vj3,don_manfred,2,Mon Jun 8 21:23:56 2015 UTC,I've had friends that go against my advice and redose several hours after their initial dose. They say they come right back up but I'm sure that's putting a LOT more stress on your serotonin receptors than if you redose closer to your initial dose. I would say it's doable but don't count out the possibility of a bad comedown.
MDMA,392vj3,ronstoppable420,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:33:43 2015 UTC,"In addition, this is REALLY bad for your brain cells. Why not just roll one time?"
MDMA,392vj3,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:34:46 2015 UTC,It's not remotely as good the second time. Just take it once in the afternoon and ride it through night.
MDMA,392vj3,hashmon,0,Mon Jun 8 23:46:24 2015 UTC,If you have enough to keep going then yeah by all means do it! If i were you I'd want around 1-2g of MD if you're doing that
MDMA,392vj3,GalsDemSugar,0,Tue Jun 9 01:14:48 2015 UTC,Horrible idea you wont come up as hard and it will drastically increase your tolerance in the future and lead to some permanent tolerance and negative effects in addition to a much worse hangover.
MDMA,392vj3,MagicSmashDrugs,-1,Tue Jun 9 00:41:18 2015 UTC,Me and my buddy used to drop a pill then on the comedown split a pill and snort it. We did this hella times. I'm still alive and so is he.

MDMA,392jf3,baconmma,0,Mon Jun 8 20:20:26 2015 UTC,"I have read elsewhere that 3-4 weeks is okay between taking it, is this correct? Will I get the same effect? I would like to know details."
MDMA,392jf3,BobbleheadDoll,2,Mon Jun 8 20:26:35 2015 UTC,"People say for the best results wait 3 months between uses. No-one has figured out exactly how often someone should take it. Everyone is different and everyone takes different amounts each time they roll. Basically, the more often you take it and higher the doses, the less potent the effects will be for you in the future. Most people would agree that 3 weeks isn't a long enough break. If you want to preserve the effects of the drug you should probably wait at least 2 months. Again, that's just a random opinion. But certainly 3 weeks isn't long enough if you're wanting to protect your mental wellbeing and have enjoyable rolls in the future."
MDMA,390o07,UndertakerENT,8,Mon Jun 8 11:39:16 2015 UTC,"Really it's counterproductive. You may have one good or interesting session but overall it likely won't help you long term.  The point of meditating, at least partially, is to practice mindfulness so you're better able to not let your ego or emotions overcome you in your daily life.   If you're not meditating in the same state you spend most of your waking hours it's not as beneficial."
MDMA,390o07,PsychedelicVisions,2,Mon Jun 8 18:50:30 2015 UTC,"I agree to an extent, but there are advantages to meditating while rolling, tripping, etc, just not for mindfulness purposes. For example, if the purpose of the meditation is to increase/generate compassion for self/others, then MDMA will certainly help, just like if it's for insight on some issue, Mushrooms/LSD can help someone to think out of the box, or from another's view."

MDMA,390o07,knattt,2,Mon Jun 8 22:39:36 2015 UTC,I love just meditating on MDMA. Turn everything off and just absorb the experience.
MDMA,390o07,hashmon,2,Mon Jun 8 23:45:16 2015 UTC,"I had a great session doing the same, during a period where I was not doing great after a rough breakup. This was before Christmas and I have not rolled since. Nor will I repeat the experience, as there is no need to.  The only way I can explain my experience is by saying it was akin to dipping my toe into the river of infinity. It was a catalyst that brought so much into life.  Heart opening, awareness expanding, and permanent, continuous changes have been the result.  Enjoy life, do things for the sake of doing them, and don't chase after that feeling, would be my unsolicited advice. Enjoy it for what it is, but I would suggest that it might never quite be the same."
MDMA,390o07,InRover,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:39:42 2015 UTC,I did it for a brief few breaths in a club once just to see how it would be. I only did it for a moment but it seemed very easy to do (unlike when I'm sober when all sorts of thoughts are rising in my mind.
MDMA,390o07,baconmma,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:03:12 2015 UTC,Its nice during the moment and can be a good opportunity to bond with people but its not thattt useful in the longterm as meditating on psychs is.
MDMA,390o07,MagicSmashDrugs,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:41:56 2015 UTC,Getting treatment for psychological issues while rolling can be very helpful. Meditation can get you to a place where you feel like you are on ecstasy that makes the drug feel like shit.
MDMA,390o07,Grasshopper42,-3,Wed Jun 17 22:19:09 2015 UTC,"THC for meditation. Any other drug - for communication.  Got high once just to meditate. Did it whole 9 yards. Caughing with tears/10 is how high I was. 30 seconds later was laying on my back on the floor listening to Yoga nidra. It sends you into conscous sleep. In 2 hours you get an 8 hour sleep. I did it 3 times sober.   It starts with seagulls and ocean in background, than the yoga guy in soft voice starts the ""your limbs are........... relaaaxiiiing (with an exhale)"" etc etc all 2 hours. It sends you down and then lifts you back up.   While sober - it worked as a charm. I was gradually letting go of all the muscules. Works. With ganja it took me 0.33 seconds at most to reach the purpose of meditation. I couldn't relax anything further. I just left body as soon as I heard that first seagull hit my eardrums. Usually it takes good 10-15 minutes to believe that you're on that stupid beach and you don't have student loan, a job tomorrow or 9 other imaginary problems.   Other drugs are a communication tools for me. THC makes me creative but I cannot express myself comprehensively to others, noone can understand me unless they high too. Other drugs annihilate ego and I'm all alpha/beta/gamma male in one person. I don't want to spend this limited experiment time to be passive."

MDMA,3905lw,suche1,3,Mon Jun 8 08:16:03 2015 UTC,Really interesting. It's never taken me that long before. The fastest I have started coming up was like 10-15 minutes after parachuting on an empty stomach.
MDMA,3905lw,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:45:43 2015 UTC,"I always drop on an empty stomach too but it takes 2 hours to the dot to start coming up while everyone else has already reached plateau from the same stuff. And I'm not a very big girl either, 173cm/50kg. Antacids have helped with this though, once I took 2 antacids an hour before dropping and I started coming up 45 minutes after dropping and it felt like a miracle at that point, haha."
MDMA,3905lw,suche1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:35:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you are tiny, haha. I can imagine how frustrating that must be to see everyone else rolling when you are just starting.  I never tried the antacid approach. But 45 minutes is usually when the roll has started--no peak, but I am definitely starting to roll. Somewhere between 30-45 mins is my sweet spot."
MDMA,3905lw,BobbleheadDoll,2,Mon Jun 8 16:41:46 2015 UTC,"Well, it's really not that frustrating for me when I get to see everyone having a good time and I get to take care them :D It's actually quite interesting to see someone coming up when you're still sober tbh. Also knowing you will reach that same stage a little later is a nice feeling, haha."

MDMA,3905lw,BobbleheadDoll,4,Mon Jun 8 20:15:28 2015 UTC,One time I went to a festival and took some MDMA before seeing Eminem. Eminem was like an hour and half late and by the time he came on stage I was already coming down. It was a long time ago and my friend was the one who wanted to take it so early. If it was my decision I'd have waited but oh well. I just remember everyone getting really hyped when he came on stage and me being super depressed and leaving. Think I got laid the next night though so it turned out ok.
MDMA,3905lw,baconmma,2,Mon Jun 8 12:33:55 2015 UTC,also try to switch scenery from time to time when you want to start rolling.. it really helps

MDMA,3905lw,vin_mac18,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:49:18 2015 UTC,That's essentially what happened. XS was pretty dark inside (besides the lasers and lights). The outside is still in the hotel where it is veeeeery well lighted. Very interesting...
MDMA,3905lw,oreohno,2,Tue Jun 9 08:28:27 2015 UTC,That's why I usually drop on a relatively empty stomach just in case. The press could also have been hard which would take your stomach acid a little longer to break down. Usually on an empty stomach I feel the first effects to begin within 15 min or so.  The fact that you had eaten not that long ago could've gotten in the way of your tummy acid. Oh and not everyone's stomach acid is going to be equally as vigorous either.

MDMA,3905lw,SharpieBlueRed,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:45:49 2015 UTC,"Usually takes me about 30-45. I never ever ever take anymore until at least 45 minutes if I don't feel it.

MDMA,392lrc,BayAreaxRaver,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"Is it already in powder form? Probably won't be much different. You could try parachuting and see how it goes. Or you could dump the powder is some OJ, stir it, and down it (but make sure you get ALL of the powder)."
MDMA,392lrc,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:23:40 2015 UTC,It's in powder form but inside the capsule. Was just thinking of emptying out the capsules. I did that last year but with Lemonade. It took about 20 minutes for the come up.. Maybe I should've mixed it with less than 8oz of juice instead of 16oz..
MDMA,392lrc,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:30:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it will hit you with the same strength. The difference in time is due to difference the container for the powder: The capsule takes longer to dissolve than no capsule.  I saw people suggesting plugging the powder, which is something I have not tried, but it sounds like it is a really intense way to roll (but it might last a shorter amount of time)."
MDMA,392lrc,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:36:12 2015 UTC,Probably just stick to swallowing the capsule then. I don't think I'd ever plug.. Sounds a bit gross and weird considering crap literally comes out that way.. Lol
MDMA,392lrc,n1ll0,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:49:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah. So if you want a faster come up, then get rid of the capsule and swallow the powder.  The only way you would get a more intense roll is if you were comparing a pressed pill to a crushed pill.  For you, the get a more intense roll, you can either take more to start or plug it (or both)."
MDMA,392lrc,n1ll0,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:56:33 2015 UTC,"One suggestion I've seen floating around, which I can confirm anecdotally, is to eat a few tums the hour or so leading up to ingesting. Supposedly this lowers the acidity of the stomach and better (faster?) absorption of the MDMA.  I dunno if this was specifically the reason, but last time I rolled I ate like 3 or 4 tums an hour before and then 2 more like 15 minutes before. I started coming up after 10 or 15 minutes and was coming up hard at about t+20 minutes.  Just my 2 cents :)  EDIT: oh also, for full disclosure this was a pill not rock/powder MDMA (capped or otherwise)"
MDMA,393szs,mdthrow001,4,Tue Jun 9 01:36:52 2015 UTC,Ok I really hope you don't actually roll  weekly. It's actually not recommended to roll more than once every 3 months. Also your dosing is super harmful. A typical first dose is around 120-150mg with half of that amount for a redose. Taking anywhere near what you took on a night will cause you severe mental and physical issues in the future. On top of that you drank 10 drinks? This is ridiculous. You should really assess your partying ways and why you need so much drugs to have fun.
MDMA,393szs,Belleinoc,-5,Tue Jun 9 02:00:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm fully aware that rolling weekly isn't recommended and I'm also aware that I was a fool to do this much MD in one night. Things got out of hand. That's not the answer I'm looking for here though, like I said in my post. Oh, and I do not need 1.3g of mdma to have fun. I love life every day. I just love it a bit more on md."
MDMA,393szs,deadfap5,7,Tue Jun 9 02:10:53 2015 UTC,"You're not going to get any sympathy here. Weekly rolling and 1.3g's in one night means you deserve what you got. That's all there is to explain. I've been rolling for years and never, not once, more than 300mg. Why is it so impossible for you to stop redosing? Don't bring more out with you then. You can easily prevent this shit from happening, but clearly are just too stupid to do so. You want to wait just 2 weeks after what has happened to you? You are clearly addicted and are lying to yourself about how fucked up this drug is making you. I swear, brits don't know shit about MDMA and MDMA safety."
MDMA,393szs,deadfap5,0,Tue Jun 9 03:11:35 2015 UTC,"Mate, I am not looking for your or anyone elses sympathy. I know this was insanely stupid and it's not something I intend to do again. I created this thread to understand what happened so I can learn a good lesson. I didn't mean to redose as much as I did, I forgot that I had taken more caps (before they kicked in) and just kept taking them until I was out. The reason I had so much on me from the beginning was because I was my friends ""guy"" on this particular night and I didn't know how many wanted to roll.   Oh, and two more things. I'm not sure you are in a great position to tell me how ""fucked up"" I am and I'm also not a brit."
MDMA,393szs,Belleinoc,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:32:49 2015 UTC,"I thought mate was exclusively British term. Or Australian? Anyways, there's no need to understand what happened. Just understand that you should never do that or anything remotely close to that ever again. There's just no point. No one can tell you anyway cuz we are all just drug Guinea Pigs since no real research has been conducted on humans yet that isn't tainted (i.e subjects' poly drug use and most subjects never took pure MDMA in the first place though thought they did all that time)"

MDMA,393szs,amazingsil,0,Tue Jun 9 03:29:39 2015 UTC,"Well, from what I understand that's only true with severe SS. The descriptions and symptoms I've read about for moderate SS fits quite well into my experience. What makes you say that it wasn't SS? (I'm curious)  And of course I take this as a warning. I don't want to feel like I did again. This whole thread is about harm reduction. I might not be perfect when it comes to spreading out my rolls, but shouldn't I be able to ask questions and get proper answers just because of that?"
MDMA,393szs,phacid,3,Tue Jun 9 03:54:24 2015 UTC,"You did get real answers. The answer: You need to stop abusing MDMA or you will pay a higher price. If you had serotonin syndrome and didn't need to go to the hospital you are LUCKY. If you did 1.3 grams in 1 night and roll weekly, you need a large break.  Not very many people on here are going to be qualified to diagnose whether it was serotonin syndrome or not, especially over the internet."
MDMA,393szs,Noargh,2,Tue Jun 9 10:53:26 2015 UTC,"dude. take a break, you lucked out. what you're doing right now is irresponsible as fuck, there is other party drugs that you can do on a weekly basis, mdma is not the right one for that."

MDMA,391plt,selerim,2,Mon Jun 8 16:43:17 2015 UTC,"If you are really concerned, I would go to the doctor.  Some possible explanations I can think of are that your head feels tights from clenching your jaw. Maybe your neck is tight, too.  After rolling hardcore, I would sometimes feel like the back of my head is lighter, like a piece of my brain was missing. I think that was from taking way too much MDMA.  When in doubt, go see a doctor. I am not a doctor."
MDMA,391plt,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:48:03 2015 UTC,"I was considering the jaw clenching to be a possible reason but not entirely sure. Considering I do not have insurance at the moment, I will most likely see Urgent Care doctor if the issues persist."
MDMA,391plt,BobbleheadDoll,2,Mon Jun 8 17:27:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, I understand. Not having insurance is pretty stressful.  Test out the jaw clench thing. Try to flex your muscles in different parts of your neck or head to see if the pain gets worse. If it does, then that is probably the issue."
MDMA,391phx,Siebevandijk,2,Mon Jun 8 16:42:34 2015 UTC,What I used to do when I rolled was swallow one pill orally and parachute another one at the same time. My reasoning was that I would get stronger and longer peaks--and I think I did. But I never compared this to something like you are suggesting where you take two doses through the same route of administration but separated by time.  You could try it and see how it stacks up to your previous rolls. It's about experimenting.
MDMA,391phx,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:49:52 2015 UTC,Pill and parachute is the same thing. Oral administration. The reason you rolled harder and longer was because you were just taking more MDMA lol..
MDMA,391phx,deadfap5,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"Well, you would be correct, but my comparison was to taking 2 pills at the same time in the same way (rather than separated in time). So I usually started off with about the same amount each time.  Pill and parachute is same, except parachute is powder (more surface area) and it dissolves more quickly than pill."
MDMA,391phx,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:32:56 2015 UTC,I keep forgetting most people still take pressed pills. Pills for me have always been and always will be capsules full of crushed crystal lol - hence why I considered them the same
MDMA,391phx,deadfap5,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:02:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Back when I was rolling, powder was difficult to find."

MDMA,391phx,BobbleheadDoll,2,Tue Jun 9 20:33:21 2015 UTC,Yeah but the ideal redosage time is 1.5 hours in after the intial I'll give an example   Take 100MG at 12:00  Take 50MG redose at 1:30  Its best to take half the initial amount as a redose 1.5 hours in and make to do ONE REDOSE ONLY more is counter productive and hurts your tolerance. This timing allows for you to half a sufficently long roll.  Referring to the example before  12:00-Take Initial Point (Sober)  12:45-Start Coming Up  1:30-Redose/Start Peak of initial dose  2:15-Come Up of redose in addition to peak of first dose creates almost like a super peak that is best experienced with a 1.5 hour redose timer  3:00-At the start end of your redose Peak and at the tail end of your initial dose peak. This will be the best part as for a little while you will be peaking on both dosages  4:00-Initial Dose peak will start to end but you will still be feeling it strong and the redose peak will still be going making the roll still go strong  5:30-Initial Dose is at its comedown stage and peak of redose tends to end right here but the comedown isnt instant so you still have some time   6:30-Real Comedown Begins.   It allows for you have basically 6 hour roll where your peaking from 1:30-4:30 With a super peak from 3-4. I find that one initial dose keeps the roll too short in my opinion. You can opt to redose the same amount as the initial but it is less safe but for the most part as long as you do it 1.5 hrs in you should be fine
MDMA,391phx,MagicSmashDrugs,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:52:35 2015 UTC,Thanks! And why only one redose? As the festival lasts 12hrs..
MDMA,391phx,MagicSmashDrugs,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:06:14 2015 UTC,"The reason is your body has processed the MDMA so much at that point that the majority of serotonin has already been used. The way I like to think about it is when you take each dose you're telling your body to drink the water. However after the 2 doses the majority of the serotonin is gone. AKA you've taken 2 full swigs of the water. If you add another redose you will try to drink from the water bottle again but there is no water to quench your thirst and you may cause the bottle to deteriorate or in this case your body.   Basically it doesn't really work very well. As for option to do about the 12hr festival. You don't roll the whole time the bad acts are usually the staters. I'll use another example a festival starting at 12 and ending at midnight sine you said yours in 12 hours   Noon-2PM arrive and feel at the venue. I never eat 4-6 hrs before I drop so I can get the full effects. I feel at the venue go see some sets sober talk to some people just hang out from 2-5 at 4:30-5:30 I would drop my initial dose depending on how long you roll for I would redose at 1.5 hours in at 6 or 7 and that would keep rolling hard until 11:30 or 12 or so or maybe even a little bit after. It makes the experience a little bit more real I notice.   Festivals always go this way for me  -Anticipation fratic last minute get together stuff which is stressfully  -Driving or traveling there which creates issue Im excited but in slightly a bad mood or so.  -Arrive at festival get everything together is the peak of my discomfort along with getting past the long line and security to get in the festival. However once I walk past the guy with my mdma secured. I just breathe a sigh of relief.   -I feel out the venue from 2:30-5:00 as my day progressivly improves.   -Then I drop @5:30 I feel out the venue a little bit more at I eagerly await the effects. I get angry becauase I dont feel it which then leads to me to smoke weed or something. Around this time I have the comeup set which is the set where I start to feel it. If i dropped at 5:30 the come up set usually is around 6:00 and i come up in the middle of the set and redose at the end of the set.   -At this 7:00PM I'm peaking for sure and I had just recently taken my redose, but I dont want to go to another set right away I usually do some ""spiritual stuff"" I talk to my friends, trade kandi, socialize, go on rides, experience personal growth. Basically just enjoying the MDMA.  At my 1st roll I spent this time running around the outside of rave asking random girls for hugs because I was always so shy normally. I got about 30 hugs in this hour or so span  Durin my 2nd roll I tried to find my friends when we got lost. When I found them we ran to meditate and we literally sprinted around the venue like little kids   During my 3rd roll I spent this time bonding with my 2 friends at the time at a place called spirit tree we talked about how awesome life and this feeling was and just bonded in general  During my 4th roll I reconnected with some of my raver friends that I had a falling out with and bonded great.   Roll #5 is yet to come  As this hour or period so begins to end I am already thrilled with the experience to point where I would say its worth. I have gotten my bonding with my fellow ravers at this point to max fold and everyone is really feeling good at this point we usually go head back into the crowd for 1-2 big sets  On my 1st Roll this was Laid Back Luke-Then my roll ended becusae I only took 1 point  On my 2nd roll this was Martin Garrix and Tiesto plus a little bit afterword becuase i took 2 points   On my 3rd roll this was Rehab and 90% of clockwork i only took one point so it ended during the last peak set   On my 4th roll this was Henry Fong and Deorro and because I did 1.5 points it lasted both sets and a little bit more   The peak set is when as I said before you have the peak of the initial and redose going at the same point. It is the best part of the night by far and all my peak sets rank in my top 5 to the point where all 5 of my top sets are peak roll sets despite attending 40 raves/festivals total and only rolling at 4 of them.   After the peak set I usually comedown pretty early before the event totally ends so I usually spend the last half of the last set starting to come down but ignoring if I am really starting to comedown then Ill usually just trip out at the visuals in the stands and just take photos and kick it with my roll buddies.   After the festival if I can we head back to the tent or to the car and after a grueling drive back. I smoke a fuck ton of weed to bring the roll back. I trip out crazy on this initial high and then I pass out the end."
MDMA,391phx,elijahsantos,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:41:58 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say harder but definitely longer. This is pretty much how I redose with presses.   I take half of a pill, wait till I come up. I am usually on empty stomach so I come up in about 30-45 minutes.  After peaking for about 15-30 minutes (30 min top), I'll take another half. The reason I re-dose so early is because if I wait too long, even a little over 30 minutes, I start to chase my roll and I can no longer extend the roll.  What this does is by the end of my peak from my first half, the second half should already be kicking in. Usually no need to redose after this, in my opinion, redosing does nothing after the first time.   So to answer your question, yes definitely longer. I've found myself rolling from 10pm-3am at times because I just timed it right.  The biggest key I think though is despite all this information, don't think about it too much. Don't get it down to a science and just let the MDMA do its magic. Feel for it but it is okay to plan."
MDMA,391phx,RandallWho,0,Wed Jun 10 08:18:24 2015 UTC,"so if  your pill is 100mg and you split it...you are taking 50mg and then 50mg half hour latter so you are still taking 100mg so no, its not really going to hit harder or extend your roll.  if anything i would guess it would a weaker roll overall."

MDMA,38yd1f,phacid,2,Sun Jun 7 22:32:46 2015 UTC,"I've dabbled with micro dosing MDMA, usually to try and enhance the effects of another stim or psych. I would say as low as 15mg will already have you feeling fairly significant effects. (Note, this is a plugged dose, which kinda lends itself to micro dosing things since even that little bit will hit all at once as opposed to gradually orally) For example, a few minutes after micro dosing, I will notice my vision to get some of that rolly 'sparkle' and brightening, and music will become noticeably enhanced. This low of dosing only provides its boost for an hour or so, and admittedly does leave you wanting more. This is why I have only tried it as an adjunct to another substance, so when the lil boost wears off, I won't really crave redosing because I'll still be in a recreational state. On the up side, such low dosing doesn't drain you like a full on roll would."

MDMA,38xabk,RandallWho,-1,Sun Jun 7 20:04:47 2015 UTC,"So you dont have enough sense to just understand that if i took 2gs at a time to ""roll hard""  i wouldnt be posting about how wrong you are. 300mg would have me rolling hard, but definitely wouldnt last me as long as i want. I use at festivals or shows that last longer than a normal roll. How bout instead of saying ""youre dumb and wasteful because I think you shouldnt take more than 200mg"" you understand that everyone is different and some people like me are fine taking more because we know our limits. Quit being a prick and lumping everyone together into a single group"

MDMA,38xabk,73grandam,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:59:27 2015 UTC,200 In general is when dosages start to have diminshing returns if you weigh more maybe its 250-300 but after that its kinds of pointless and very harmful to have more dosage. High dosage you will probably be floored and not want to do anything as well as very easily get overwhelmed and black out or have bad memory in general

Eventually, it started to put people off and I started getting invited out less often to roll. It sucked. In hindsight, I probably could have controlled it a little more, but honestly, it would have been better to find BETTER PEOPLE to roll with that are ACCEPTING of who I am and how I like to roll."

MDMA,38vlta,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:40:09 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it depends on what you were doing. I've taken MDMA with someone who was horribly touchy-feely and made everyone very uncomfortable. I had only just met him that night and he would constantly come up to me and hug me, squeeze my shoulder, kiss me on the cheek, hold my hand and rub my thigh and shit. On their own, not a big deal, but it was constantly. I kept having to push him off me and kept asking him to tone it down. He done the same to my girlfriend as well, grabbing her, brushing against her tits, kissing her on the corner of her mouth, etc. I am not ashamed to say that we ditched him in the club that night and only met up with him again at the end of the night. No matter what we said to him he would not stop it and it was incredibly uncomfortable to have this big sweaty stranger kissing you on the cheek and groping your girlfriend. To me that isn't part of the experience and if that's the way you act then you really need to re-evaluate your self-control."
MDMA,38vlta,Soapy9,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it depends on what you were doing.   I can totally understand that. Thankfully, I was not even close to acting like this--that is just unacceptable. I just really yearned for touch and talking to people--I was hanging out with my dorm buddy's friends, and I did not know them that well. But I treated them like close friends (hey, we were rolling). And I think it was too much. I would keep going up to people and asking them how they are feeling and if they feel good. I have learned a lot of self-control since then, though.   No matter what we said to him he would not stop it.   This is definitely an issue. If the people who had an issue with me would have talked to me, I definitely would have stopped. I honestly did not know what I was doing wrong. But I am a good listener and sensitive to other people's needs, so if someone tells me not to do something, I won't do it. I was just saddened because after rolling a few times, I found out that they started rolling without me, and I didn't know why."
MDMA,38vlta,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:33:53 2015 UTC,"I would keep going up to people and asking them how they are feeling and if they feel good.   I can't imagine anyone would think that was too much? If you're running around hugging and kissing everyone and asking them personal questions and shit, that's probably a bit too much for some people. But I don't think the way you acted was out of the ordinary at all."
MDMA,38vlta,Soapy9,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"f you're running around hugging and kissing everyone and asking them personal questions and shit   I don't think I did that (this was in like 2006). I just remember really enjoying myself, asking if people were having a good time, and just chatting a lot. I honestly cannot remember if I did things that were out of line, but I definitely was not kissing anybody. I do remember asking people for hugs a lot.  I think the issue was that I was the ""new"" guy in the group and these guys all had known each other since they were young kids (or at least throughout all of high school). So they felt uncomfortable with me being very open and enjoying my rolls (I used to roll like mad intensely, so sometimes I would moan involuntarily because I felt so good. I couldn't help it!).  I can understand how some people would consider me offputting. It would have been better if I knew these people well so they could be more comfortable with me."
MDMA,38vlta,BobbleheadDoll,5,Fri Jun 12 19:43:19 2015 UTC,"I've noticed with the group I roll with that any inhibitions seem to fade away. We have made a pile of bodies before where we just all cuddle up to eachother. Bear in mind the majority of us are straight guys, it's just the way it works."
MDMA,38vlta,kh4zm,4,Sun Jun 7 10:41:22 2015 UTC,"Nah.  I get really touchy feely too.  I really like shoulders though, so I arm hug people and dance with them there."
MDMA,38vlta,CoffeeNSquats,2,Sun Jun 7 05:15:37 2015 UTC,"No.  It means it works and it means (as you said) you are new to the drug. i was the same way when is started but now its easier to control and it have gotten better at reading people.  and i am the say way. i can get extremely cuddle on MDMA its the part i love the best but…  ...There is some degree of etiquette that goes with it.   Which comes with time, knowing yourself on the drug and then learning to read others. Which is pretty tricky. esp when you are high and they are high.  But you will learn.  What make you think your freinds are weird about it? have they said something? do they run the other way? have you asked?  also reminds me of story of friend i brought to a party for the 1st time.  He did 200mg for his 1st time and well was pretty friendly with people esp girls.  There were more then a few times where i had to intervene or check on him or the girl he was talking to.   So you are not alone."
MDMA,38vlta,RandallWho,2,Sun Jun 7 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"Well tell your friends to loosen up cause mdma is all about empathogenity and entactogenity, which are the exact effects you are describing. Youre not taking speed to be all hyped up and dance your ass off (even if dancing on mdma is awesome)."

MDMA,38w1g8,suche1,2,Sun Jun 7 11:37:52 2015 UTC,Its fine you might feel more speedy and less lovey. I usually stop taking adderall a week before a roll. Otherwise I get more anxiety on the come up and less euphoria. Personal experience so take it for what you want.

MDMA,38w1g8,long_live_mcqueen,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:24:14 2015 UTC,"Doing it once should be fine. Don't make it a habit of taking stimulants regularly.  Amphetamine mostly only releases dopamine and norepinephreine, while MDMA mostly only releases serotonin and norepinephrine. Your MDMA high will likely be less stimulating as you will experience short-term tolerance at the dopamine and norepinephrine sites from using Amphetamine the day before. You might end up being less interested in dancing and moving around, but you'll still get the loved up MDMA high."

I find that I usually smoke a bit when I peak and what has really help the last 2 rolls is eating edibles about 3.5 hours from dosing. My friend and I both tried this and I had no nausea. I don't usually have a harsh comedown but I felt like getting a nice edible high to end the night after the roll made it all more magical. If you have access or can bake your own goods maybe try that? If you haven't eating any pot brownies or medical grade edibles before MAKE SURE YOU TRY THEM OUT BEFORE TAKING THEM AFTER ROLLING!

So sorry, tried because I thought it would improve your day! I cannot find it now.   I was impressed that evolution had ""accounted"" for so many things, including how some poisons cause a conflict between the sense of balance as relayed by the eyes and the ears, hence why some people puke after reading in a car ... amazing.   Like your friends I always puke just after the come up. I understand MDMA is toxic, like nearly everything, but that the LD50 dose is so much higher (~few grams) than what sensible people use ... I have no idea which pathway I am triggering when I blow chunks but I do not expect my body to know what to do with this molecule when I give it 200mg.   If you do learn the specific scientific reasons for your puking on the way down (or up), I'd be interested in the details! This is a shit reply, sorry, but I am eager to help/learn. :)"
MDMA,38sspm,gayrudeboys,2,Sun Jun 7 22:53:35 2015 UTC,"This happens to me, too. I think it's got a lot to do with electrolyte imbalances but I can't be too certain.

MDMA,38sspm,marijuanapots,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:10:48 2015 UTC,"I really think milk wont do things better, problem is i almost always take mdma in the club so i dance a lot, and now after reading some comments im sure it has to do something with those electrolytes so next time im going to try drinking isotonic drinks instead of just water, or just have a beer or coke( coca cola hehe :) ) as im sure there arent sports drinks in the club.

MDMA,38sspm,Belleinoc,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:05:36 2015 UTC,Literally THIS i dont even feel nausea and suddenly just out of nowhere hits me and i throw up. Its really stressing cause then i get worried if i puke a lot of liquid i dont know if thats because i drank to much water or should i drink more now i threw up...but the upside is that i dont really feel bad before or after puking like say from alcohol. Glad im not the only one :) cheers
MDMA,38sspm,lelgg,2,Sun Jun 7 19:38:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I always drink water afterwards because you do lose a lot of liquid.I'm also glad I'm not the only one btw ;) my friends don't seem to experience this.
MDMA,38sre2,whereswallace10,3,Sat Jun 6 14:28:21 2015 UTC,"I've tended to find the pre-loading kinda mellows your roll out some. Less speedy, less overwhelmingly euphoric. More in control, chillin, happy. Both are good, and honestly the differences aren't extremely noticeable. But the comedown after a well-planned roll is basically non-existent.  Intensity of comedown is basically related to intensity of high. Pre-loading trades a bit of the speedier side of the high for a dramatically reduced comedown.  For me, ymmv."
MDMA,38sre2,Spinster444,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:26:39 2015 UTC,"I pre/post-loaded for the first time when I rolled last, and it definitely was less overwhelming in the euphoric sense and I was a lot more in control.

MDMA,38sre2,rocketno40,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:37:23 2015 UTC,"No amount of good diet and exercise is going to offset free-radical damage in the brain from mdma, this is really the whole point of the supplements.  If youre not interested in taking a shit ton (like some do), then just make sure you've got some vitamin c in your system before/during.  Taking antioxidants after youre finished rolling is fine and all, but most of the damage has been done by that point."

MDMA,38sre2,kandikraze,0,Sat Jun 6 21:22:44 2015 UTC,"The times when I didn't pre-post load, I felt like utter crap. MDMA seems to be one of those drugs that you need to plan for in advance (well for me at least).  I believe that harm reduction is important, however this is no amount of supplementation that could nullify the damage done by [excessive] MDMA use. The point of harm reduction is to cushion that damage.   Neurotoxcity is what causes most if not all the damage done by MDMA. The metabolites your body creates from breaking down the compounds of MDMA, those of which contains free radicals, causes this neurotoxcity. To offset the damage done by free radicals you'll need to look into antioxidants such  as Vitamin C, Melatonin, ECGC (Green Tea Extract), etc. I prefer taking something like Ester-C since it's 24 hour time released Vitamin C supplement.  5-HTP isn't necessary unless you're feeling especially depressed. The point of this supplement is just to help regenerate your stores of serotonin. You shouldn't be taking 5-HTP 12 hours before OR after your roll anyway since it may increase the chances of developing serotonin syndrome.  As for the jaw clenching, using chelated magnesium (don't take any of that magnesium oxide crap) 6 hours before and after your roll will alleviate the bruxism.   If you want a comprehensive list of supplementation and what each one does this thread is a good place to start.  If you want to learn more about the metabolic pathways or MDMA and neurotoxcity of it's metabolites you can find it here."
MDMA,38sfxy,mdbigup,6,Sat Jun 6 12:25:03 2015 UTC,"You're chilling. Just a warning though: 2cb can really have a nasty come up. Lost of gurgle gut, nausea, etc. The severity of it changes by person, obviously, but just know that the drug isn't some miracle acid/mdma hybrid thing. It has its downsides."
MDMA,38sfxy,Spinster444,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:18:34 2015 UTC,can you elaborate? I plan on 2-cb since I don't wanna roll back to back. does it have the similar euphoria like mdma?
MDMA,38sfxy,whatdoy0uknow,2,Sat Jun 6 22:57:47 2015 UTC,"Its psychedelic in an aspect here's how I would describe it. It is a true ""stimulant"" not so much that its like Meth or Coke or Adderall but it truley stimulates your senses in ways that other drugs cannot. I remember thinking how cool stuff felt how cool the visuals looked and how cool things sounded. However, it is also has a high bodyload. Your stomach can feel weird and its easy to want to just lay down and enjoy the stimulii. I would say it has very different euphoria. Its similar in that you are empathetic and happy be when you feel it, it isn't something you direcetly compare to mdma. Its not as high energy in my opinion and over the top. Its much more psychedelic and easier to come down on though.  The reason its called an LSD MDMA hybrid is because it affects you way that is similar to both. It can cause great visuals, great euphoria, great empathy...But as I learn the more drugs that i've done is that all the drugs are really really different and 2c-b is very different compared to LSD and MDMA. I would say its harder to do than MDMA like to have an ideal trip but easier than LSD."
MDMA,38sfxy,MagicSmashDrugs,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:13:48 2015 UTC,"Preface: I have only tried it twice, so not super experienced with it. The first time was only 10mg, barely enough of a dose to really talk about in the context of a festival. The second time:  My dosage: 20mg, 10mg redose at t + 120. After my first dose I had pretty bad come-up issues with my stomach. A lot of gurgle gut, kinda felt like I had to poop but couldn't make myself. So the start of my trip was centered around my GI issues/feeling. Once I just made peace with the fact that I was not going to shit my pants it was better.  The visuals were pretty intense. Along the same line as acid visuals: breathing, straight lines moving, things going in and out of 2d/3d, but just way way more obvious. I didn't have a ton of the mental effects that some people describe (euphoria, empathy, etc.) I think my redose was far enough out from my first dose that I never really breached the mental side of the high. I was more talkative and friendlier than normal, but that's kinda my default move at festivals. Kinda hard to discern what was the drugs and what was environment. With more experience I could talk more.  The visuals were more intense than I've had with acid (up to 2 tabs, ~200 ug), but the headspace was not fun enough to overcome the GI issues. However, I am interested in trying the drug more. It wasn't bad, but not really super fun.  Honestly unless you're planning on taking acid enough to run into tolerance issues (more than 2 days in a row) I would probably suggest acid/candyflipping."
MDMA,38sfxy,Spinster444,3,Sun Jun 7 00:58:09 2015 UTC,yeah its awesome. i usually roll first tho and then 2c-b.

MDMA,38sfxy,idafje,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:39:17 2015 UTC,"In Shulgins book PIHKAL he talks about how the perfect time to take 2cb is while coming down from MDMA ""The most successful reports have followed a program in which the two drugs are not used at the same time, nor even too closely spaced. It appears that the optimum time for the 2C-B is at, or just before, the final baseline recovery of the MDMA. It is as if the mental and emotional discoveries can be mobilized, and something done about them."" So I would say you are safe to take them one after the other. If you can rearrange your schedule you might enjoy taking the 2cb after instead  Source:https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal020.shtml"
MDMA,38sfxy,Agoddamnliterofcola,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:47:30 2015 UTC,how about if i take 2cb and i enjoy it friday then take it again just after the mdma the saturday night?
MDMA,38sfxy,MagicSmashDrugs,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:42:21 2015 UTC,Nah there's a pretty big cross tolerance from back to back days of 2c-b. I would either just do 2c-b friday and mdma saturday. MDMA is enough for sure if you want to do the combo than take something else friday. if you want to do the combo. Take MDMA and then as your peak ends prob like 4 hours in take 2c-b that is the most ideal way to combo the two
MDMA,38sfxy,GalsDemSugar,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:14:59 2015 UTC,Well the first time I tried 2cb was the same night I had done around 1g of MD and I was fine! The trip was actually really awesome. But I wouldn't smoke weed while on 2cb and I had 2 blunts and things got a little sketchy and I didn't quite know what was reality and when I thought I had stood up it turned out I was still sitting down but it was all the trip. So things can get a little weird when you're tripping and also high as fuck. But other than that 2cb is fine to do with MD and is actually an awesome combination :)
MDMA,38sjv6,isciple,5,Sat Jun 6 13:12:55 2015 UTC,Probably methylone. Meth is more reddish. Check the color wheel/chart that came with your kit

MDMA,38qy4v,Kapsize,4,Sat Jun 6 02:05:14 2015 UTC,"For me, weed is a day to day thing, so I smoke before during and after rolling. I like how during the come up you go from weed high to mdma high. During the roll, smoking just feels so great."

MDMA,38qy4v,n1ll0,3,Sat Jun 6 21:16:55 2015 UTC,It depends on how much you like marijuana and how it affects you. I have friends that smoke every single day and they usually smoke through an entire roll. I only ever smoke marijuana towards the end of a roll because it's the only time I really like the marijuana high.

MDMA,38o3t3,kiggidykog,-1,Fri Jun 5 13:53:52 2015 UTC,"So are you looking for things to do while rolling or looking for how to intensify the existing roll?  Here is what I would do. I would break the first dose in half. Then swallow half of the first dose and then chew or parachute the other half. This will hit you harder and faster. For your second dose, do something something similar with plugging. If you have an oral syringe, you can crush half of the pill, mix it with water, and then shoot that up your tooter. Then chew/parachute the remaining half (or even just swallow). If you have more than two ecstasy pills per person, you can do larger doses for each of those administration methods.  I have never plugged before, but it sounds like something I would try. Also, keep in mind that redosing is not really that good for you.  Maybe other people here will some other ideas about how to potentiate your rolls. Make sure your music is super loud, lights are off, and you have some light visuals going on your computer (or a strobe light).  Have a good time!  EDIT: Added""more than"""

MDMA,38oue1,forestcollector,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:51:45 2015 UTC,"As others have pointed out, two days isn't even remotely enough. You need 1 week minimum for the absolute shortest half-life SSRi out there (Luvox/Fluvoxamine). You'd need an average of 2-3 weeks for others. Prozac/Fluoxetine has a half-life of 1 week, which completely checks you out for well over a month.   SSRIs also cause long-term changes in the brain. MDMA will not work nearly to the same extent after their half-lifes have worn off. Nobody knows why this happens, but it does. If you have only been on your SSRIs for 3 weeks as you said then you're fine. Long-term changes don't occur in just 3 weeks."

MDMA,38mirg,BringingTheMagicBack,2,Fri Jun 5 04:25:05 2015 UTC,"You didn't read it completely right. It doesn't do ANYTHING from what I can see to serotonin levels.  It is less about the total serotonin level than it is to do about the actual binding efficacy of serotonin. For example, you could have a shitton of serotonin from MDMA, but if you've used it too much - you'll get less of a reward as your brain has reduced the receptor densities.  What this drug does, is act at the 5-HT1A receptor as an agonist (activator) and at 5-HT2A as an antagonist (blocker).  Agonism at the 5-HT1A receptor is good for boosting mood, arousal, sociability. If serotonin isn't binding effectively at this site, you'll have a lower mood, less arousal and less sociability, etc. This drug acts on this site, similarly to serotonin.  Antagonism at the 5-HT2A receptor is good for restoring receptor sensitivity and density. Antagonists block receptors, and this action leads the receptors to increase in density and increases their reaction to their respective neurotransmitter. They basically occupy the receptor but do not induce a physiological response within the cell."
MDMA,38mirg,NotoriousPyro,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:27:18 2015 UTC,"It won't bring the magic back from the MDMA high, if that's what you're asking. You need to stop using MDMA (and any other drugs that bind to and/or release serotonin) for a long time for that to happen. Activating the receptors further, like this drug does, will only make the problem worse. There is no fix for this. You just have to stop using the drugs that you do, and tolerance may reverse enough in long-term abstinence for MDMA's ""magic"" to come back.   The reason why you no longer feel MDMA's ""magic"" is because the brain builds up tolerance to the repeated presence of a drug. It's the brain's natural defence mechanism. The brain will in theory reverse tolerance after a lack of exposure to a certain drug. How long that is depends on how long you've taken the drug for."

Alcohol has similar effects on the brain that Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Alprazolam, etc) have. Cocaine definitely counteracts the effects of alcohol, and I've had similar experiences with cocaine and MDMA. Cocaine takes me out of my roll everytime.   I typically have a couple beers before I take MDMA (which is not very often), because I feel the rush of MDMA can be a bit intense, feel like anxiety, and even give me slight nausea. I've found that after a couple beers, or cocktails that effect is virtually nonexistant.   I also find that when I am taking MDMA, or pressed pills, I am usually in the environment where drinking is in the majority. I usually like to pregame with alcohol and transition into either MDMA, cocaine, or even mushrooms depending on what I'm doing that night.   After the MDMA hits me though, I typically have a stronger desire for water as a result of dancing. I end up drinking more water, but still have some beers or cocktails as the night continues and I feel it helps the after effects of MDMA wearing off and helps me sleep."

I always empty caps of 5htp and fill it up with molly or if you have euro presses they blend in well with Flintstones vitamins so u can hide them mixed in a jar.  Just hide the 5htp/flitstones jars in your toiletries bag that you check in (i highly recommend checking a bag if your flying...dont carry on).  This has worked for me (3 EDC's, 1 Electric Zoo, and 1 TommorroWorld so far)."

MDMA,38jfy4,IIFellerII,9,Thu Jun 4 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"Easy answer, yes, it would be dangerous.   Long answer-- What you're doing is a little reckless, MDMA takes a very large tole on your body. If you're already exhausted why push your luck? Depending on your body you may not even have enough serotonin left to enjoy it properly. Plus the level of neuro toxicity starts jumping through the roof when you go on benders with mdma. Also you will probably need more than your average dose to feel anything worthwhile.   If you decide to go through with it. Get another nap in, take a vitamin cocktail and eat a decent meal 6 to 8 hours prior. Gotta fuel your body if you're planning to put it through that level of stress.   Expect a fairly moderate hangover."

MDMA,38jfy4,hashmon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:51:54 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm 35 years old. I used to sell it, so it was around all the time. I never partied with; I just took it as a psychedelic, but for a couple years I was practically always rolling, and often tripping on L, as well. Great times, actually. And I've never, ever had a problem with MDMA. No HPPD, certainly no serotonin depletion. I did get HPPD from taking too much methylone a couple times, trying to overcompensate for not having real MDMA.  The 1000 estimate might be a bit high; I'm not sure exactly. At one point I had to take a break, and I took nine months. That was a couple years ago, and since then I've been having the best rolls of my life, not quite as frequent, but still pretty often. I think I've been getting away with it partially because I put nothing that I consider a toxin in my body- no coffee, no alcohol, no junk food, no prescription drugs, no cigarettes. Just weed and psychedelics, mostly just MDMA, and the occasional serious DMT adventure. Also, I only take one normal dose at a time, like 75-100 Mg's. None of this five half gram dosing, which is bound to get you in trouble. I use it as a meditation and creativity tool, and it's added a lot of spiritual and spiritual connection to my life."

MDMA,38h819,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:17:18 2015 UTC,"I mean, you could take a non-professional perspective and just listen to her talk. Has she expressed interest in rolling and chatting with you?"

She is still technically active so any pills she would be put on would take her out of service (which she doesn't want) but she's on leave for a few months.

MDMA,38h819,BobbleheadDoll,2,Thu Jun 4 05:47:56 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be nice and could possibly help alleviate a bit of her stress.   There is no guarantee that this will help. She should really see a therapist.  If she has expressed interest and it seems like she is going to do it no matter what, then it would be best if she did with you and other people she felt comfortable with.   She is still technically active so any pills she would be put on would take her out of service (which she doesn't want)    This is a risk that she would have to take. Do they randomly drug test while she is on leave? She should strongly consider her options.   I've been thinking of throwing her a small get-together with close friends and rolling. Just talking about life and sharing the love.   That does sound like a fun time. Just make sure that you and she weigh all of the consequences of her rolling."
MDMA,38h819,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:50:20 2015 UTC,"Not only would it take her out of the service, but she could get a dishonorable discharge from it too. As for chemical resistance, most anti - depressants take weeks to kick in. If she's missing doses or not following the dosages that can be a issue. (That and some just don't work as well for different people.) But I'd recommend doing it with a approving physician present. As it'll help her ptsd therapy sessions long term if she's able to speak to her therapist while on it. If she's gonna take the risk of UCMJ action it might as well be under dr supervision to help with counseling vs a fun time rolling."

Give me a real underground trance gig with a few hundred real fans any day"
MDMA,38hmqo,Plato2012,4,Thu Jun 4 12:24:57 2015 UTC,"Can't handle the 'EDM' current stuff. It's just the same tracks with a name put on it, quite often with a famous vocalist. Or a mainstream pop song changed. Sure some of it using vine samples is pretty funny, and it appeals to a wide range of people because you have a well known vine which get's people pretty excited.  At the end of the day, people like to listen to what they know generally, which is why nightclubs which play club remix's of radio tunes are so popular. The underground scene will always remain underground because it's only those that are really into their music which delve deep enough to find the new emerging stuff.   A lot of producers move towards edm because they like to engage with the crowd, and if they aren't worried about which crowd they engage with then edm is the easy choice.   Genre's which are pretty underground usually have a long history and that's where the those that are into their music hang about. Sure, some producers make some really good tracks and get crazy popular and you have to deal with folk you don't want to. For example, deep house really went that way with the introduction of a lot of vocalists, but their is still plenty of underground music coming out of deep house genre.  The same is with drum and bass, you got a lot of really dark stuff which really doesn't appeal to most people, but it has a consistent underground following, which has been around since the beginning. What people need to realise is that EDM isn't ruining underground music. Those that produce commercial EDM music would never be interested in the underground style of music anyways.  That was long."

MDMA,38dvqp,gammajuggler,3,Sat Jun 6 22:53:03 2015 UTC,For me when I smoke during a roll it helps smooth my nerves over/calms me down a bit. I usually smoke at then end of my roll or if I'm losing it and took a bit too much.

MDMA,38dvqp,Paragonswift,2,Wed Jun 3 23:22:53 2015 UTC,"It is very dependent on your personality how you like and use weed and what situation you are in.   The only situations I recommend smoking weed on in the peek is if   -you are in a house setting and are looking for a trippy aspect of the roll  -you smoke weed often and have absolutely no issues with weed. If you are a stoner and love weed all the time and dont get shy or introspective or trip out from weed normally   -you can handle your shit  The issue is that if weed makes you antisocial or not want to move than comibing with MDMA can make similar effects which can be not ideal in the concert/rave setting.  However, from what i've noticed as I love weed that weed makes my roll when I smoked during the peak infinitely better. I actually wrote a paragraph in my 1st trip report of the 1st time I smoke weed while peaking on MDMA I will post it below  "". I then realized that X was right about MDMA and weed and how it was so perfect. The MDMA gave me increased empathy and energy and feeling. This combined perfect with weed which increased my sensory organs so strong. I could hear everything better, I could feel everything better and everything felt better. The lights on the stage were so cool to look at that I couldn' even handle it. The weed made the music sound even better it basically made everything perfect, the best part of it was that the weed fused flawlessly with MDMA it felt like it was the same drug. However, there was one even better feature of MDMA Weed there were points were music would drop and if it was in the right moment my body would be overwhelmed and I would get the most excited I'd ever been and starting going crazy with happiness.""  This was my analysis on smoking weed while peaking. Also let me know if you want to hear more about the trip report or MDMA and weed I will be glad to speak about both"

I find that smoking before coming up makes the come up really sudden. ""Sober"" i would notice the energy building up slowly in my guts and then i would come up in a matter of 10-15min afterwards but when i smoke, i dont notice this soft beginning of the roll. I just come up really quick, like a big burst of energy and euphoria building up in a single minute or two. Also, smoking is a social activity so while i roll, i often smoke when i have a conversation. A little joint meanwhile or just packing the bong hit while listening and then hitting it hard. Me and my friends also like to smoke hash bits in a bottle while hanging out in my living room, chatting. Probably the best way to smoke on mandy. Keeps your hands busy, looking at the smoke flow going up then down in the bottle is trippy and i like the stoned feeling from the hash combined with the mdma euphoria"

MDMA,38g7dr,CherryCokee,3,Thu Jun 4 00:22:28 2015 UTC,"Assuming it's got at least normal potency and, you have a normal tolerance a good idea may be to start in the neighborhood of 125-175 MG. Approximately ~1 hour after you start to feel the effects coming to a rise, towards the peak of your first dose, take another dose in the range of roughly 1/3rd to 2/3rd's of the initial. This will piggyback off the initial dose, increasing and, prolonging the peak for quite some time. Be sure to eat a moderate sized meal 6-8 hours previous (nothing heavy but, not too light either).   All those numbers really just depend how hard you want to go. I'd feel fairly safe ingesting roughly ~200MG (broken up through the first couple hours)  over the night but, I weigh about 30 pounds more than you do. Admittedly it's obviously your choice but, that amount should be relatively safe (but quite high for your size) for you. I really think If the effects of .1 on an empty stomach were fairly weak I think going towards the Middle/higher end of my suggestion should be an OK place to start.   In the end I'd rather be safe than sorry. With that said it's also OK to explore a little to find a dose you're comfortable with. Start small and build up, people tend to say around here, you can always take more but, once it's in you, it's in you. As long as you do all your bumps and, additional dosing within the first 3ish hours of your initial ingestion, you shouldn't lose too much of the effects.  EDIT: Also if you're wanting to take something before an event, i'd say 15-25 minutes before you step in the doors should give you a little time to get situated before the come up really starts. With that in mind, you said the event was roughly 9 hours. It's terribly hard to make a safe roll last longer than 5-7 hours and even then I'd say we're pushing it. If you start too early you will come down before the event ends and. depending how your body takes it, be exhausted and, just wanting to chill / lie down. If you can get it to and, into your event safely I'd drop right around 6 PM so you could enjoy a nice sunset around 8:30 and, be coming down when it's time to leave."
MDMA,38g7dr,redditingatwork23,2,Thu Jun 4 07:26:49 2015 UTC,"It's hard to predict how long your roll will last. Normally it is 4-6 hours. I would just take a larger dose, maybe something between 1.5 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg. So, if you are 68.0389 kg, then your dose should be between 102 mg and 136 mg. Why not try about 150 mg? To be honest, I am not sure the proper dose. Maybe 2 mg/kg is low? I do not know what the research literature says on this, so tread with caution. It seems like 1.5 mg/kg is too low for you though."

If you absolutely can't wait for test kit and are in the states, Walgreens has a drug kit to test drug residue but it's not specific.

On the other hand no one would care about you putting 10+10 pills in 2 random medicine containers and checking them in in your luggage. Airports, like the police, are not after the usual ""user"" type, they dont care as long as you are not a potential dealer."

MDMA,38axmr,somedrugquestions,5,Wed Jun 3 01:03:08 2015 UTC,"I'm happy for you! Rolling with a loved one is great. I always tell people to be careful with who they roll with one-on-one, and only do it after they are sure that the other person is a soulmate  (not necessarily THE soulmate, but someone who you know it will benefit you both to strengthen the bond with). Rolling with someone one-on-one at the beginning of a relationship is not a good idea, in my opinion. You will be giving each other a part of your soul, really. If your relationship is not going to last, you will develop emotional ties that will make leaving the relationship way more painful than need be. If you aren't sure she is the one, invite some friends to join you or go to a show!  That's my personal opinion on it... take it as you will. Others disagree; some people like to take MDMA with a one-night-stand. YMMV.  That said:  180mg is a pretty high starting dose. A good dose is 1.5mg/kg, which will put you (180lbs) at about 125mg.   If you want a more intense roll, take some 2CB at the same time as the MDMA. Don't needlessly increase the dose and compromise your health and enjoyment.  Your rebumps are too high. Rebumps should be half of the original dose. And don't take it at T+2hrs, take it 30 mins after the first dose hits you.   As far as Ritalin goes, it will make the MDMA less effective at stimulating dopamine and adrenaline receptors, but it isn't going to effect serotonin. This means she will still feel the lovey parts of MDMA. Considering she has ADHD, she likely is going to find MDMA to be very relaxing and almost sedative. Keep that in mind. 2CB combined with the MDMA can increase stimulating effects. If she doesn't have the typical brain patterns associated with ADHD (meaning she finds Ritalin to be stimulating rather than calmative) then she can take some of her Ritalin along with the MDMA to make it more stimulating.   Have fun, and let me know if you have other questions! :)"

MDMA,38axmr,DeaZZ,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:39:06 2015 UTC,"I feel 125 is light.  I don't mean to question you, but I've taken that much before and while it was quite incredible .. How about 150/75 for me with 15mg 2c-b? How about 120/60 for her with 10mg 2c-b?    I'd otherwise like to keep the same schedule.  Isn't 30 minutes for the redose a bit quick?  I'm not doubting you, just comparing to other lit on the subject.  How about an hour in and then 4 after that for the 2cb?"
MDMA,38axmr,WakeAndVape,0,Wed Jun 3 17:35:19 2015 UTC,"150/75 is fine if you are familiar and take a nice break, but keep in mind you're doing a total of 225mg in one night.   If you redose 50% 30 mins after coming up it will make it as if your MDMA roll is extended over a 6 hour period rather than 4. Essentially you get a longer, sustained peak and a smooth comedown. It isn't going to make you peak much harder than not redosing, if that makes any sense... hard to explain. I actually typically redose 20 mins after I feel first dose and it sustains my roll well.  The problem with T+2hrs is that every time you take MDMA it hits you at different times. Sometimes it kicks in in 30 mins, other times at 75 minutes. You may end up getting a second, smaller peak that may not be pleasant and you will have a longer comedown.   Take my advice as you want, and experiment with it if you have multiple opportunities! It's a very subjective experience. I just wanted to share my method with you which I've found to be perfect for myself and others with whom I've shared this experience.   2CB is one of the most subjective drugs in terms of dosage. 5-15mg is typically good as a MDMA adulterant. Some people get extremely strong effects from 10mg while others have a mild trip at 45. Stuff to keep in mind.  I didn't mean to make it this complicated... just focus on having a good time haha!"
MDMA,38axmr,WakeAndVape,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:57:55 2015 UTC,"hey, no, i appreciate the advice.  i'm going to go with your suggestions and timing here.  I've only ever done it near about the way I described above .. but a 6 hour peak sounds like, well, a six hour peak.  amazing, in other words.    i might step down to 125/70 and her to 100/50 maybe?  It's not a ""biggest rolling balls"" contest, after all.  I want it primarily to be FUN and FEEL GREAT, and that sounds much safer.     If it's a 6 hour peak, should I plan on a general time frame of 5ish hours from initial dose for the 2c-b?  I hear it's best to time with the comedown."
MDMA,38axmr,precense_,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:45:59 2015 UTC,"Not quite a 6 hour peak, didn't mean it that way. This will definitely extend the ride of your peak as best you can, though. It'll definitely be at least 6 hours of fun :)   Think of this as stretching the MDMA experience. Instead of a 4 hour experience, it'll evenly stretch it to ~6.  T+5hrs sounds like a great time to pop the 2cb.   Have fun dude :)"
MDMA,38axmr,WakeAndVape,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:24:21 2015 UTC,"I've always heard 1:30 for redose always on this sub, am I missing something? it's 30 minutes now for 6 hour rolls?"
MDMA,38axmr,tugsfordrugs,2,Wed Jun 3 21:34:37 2015 UTC,"That can be a good rule of thumb, but every roll is different. It's best to do it based on when the MDMA starts to affect you rather than when you swallowed the drug.  Typically takes 45-60 minutes to hit you, which is about 1.5 hours after dosing."
MDMA,38axmr,Anthemz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:38:57 2015 UTC,"The general rule for redosing mdma is to take half the original dose. Your doses are a bit high, especially with the addition of the 2c-b.  Last night I took 170mg mdma with a red is of 60mg at t+1:30. At t+5:00 I took 16mg of 2c-b. I tripped WAY harder than I intended to. The OEV were so intense that I kept being transported to different worlds. It was really intense, almost too intense. I was alone, and if I had been with somebody my ability to communicate with them would have been a 0 out of 10.  Needless to say, I think you should scale back on the 2c-b dosage. It can be an incredible experience with a SO, but I fear at that dose you both will be tripping way too hard to have a good time together wink wink"
MDMA,38axmr,LedLevee,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:44:47 2015 UTC,"You seem to know what you're doing by taking the safe precaution that you are. So that's good. However, you are correct that there is a cross tolerance between MDMA and Ritalin. Ritalin has been reported to dull the effects of MDMA more than not, but people still have been able to roll quite hard while on Ritalin as well. Everyone is different. I would suggest 100mg for your girlfriend since she's a light girl and hasn't touched MDMA in years, but since she takes Ritalin... she may just need to take 130mg to feel the desired affects. So your dosages are pretty spot on in my opinion. But if your girlfriend isn't feeling well or not feeling much at all at the time of the redose... may not be a good idea to redose all together. All that said, ask her to stop taking Ritalin from now until you guys drop in order for her brain to wean off of it a bit. Happy safe rolling, and remember to hydrate with water throughout the roll.   EDIT: Totally didn't see you'd be planning to take 2-CB as well later on in the night. If you're including that fun stuff, I wouldn't redose so high on the MDMA. Good luck!"
MDMA,38axmr,LedLevee,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:46:35 2015 UTC,"I'd drop the second redose and just do the 2C-B at that point. 2C-B brings the M back while not giving that speedy feel you'll get after another redose.  I also think 25mg 2C-B is too much for you, max is really 18-20mg. Dose curve on 2C-B is steep as FUCK. Not necessary and it'll turn out better.  My 2 cents."

MDMA,387qvd,hunt4pingaz,3,Tue Jun 2 13:28:18 2015 UTC,Seems to me you might have more or less of certain enzymes which causes higher serum levels of MDA. Next time you can try having some grapefruit juice the day before and the same day as taking MDMA (few glasses).  That inhibits enzymes that convert MDMA to MDA.

MDMA,387qvd,jnb192,3,Tue Jun 2 19:16:00 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing the MDA theory come up, and whilst it is true, your body only metabolises 10% of MDMA at most into MDMA. From a 200mg dose, that would be 20mg MDA which is not an active dose to cause these hallucinations.  The reason for MDMA hallucinations is to do with the 5HT 2A receptors in the brain. These are the same receptors that psyches like LSD or mushrooms activate. When you are coming down from MDMA, the other serotonin receptors have already been activated/saturated, so excess serotonin spills over if you will, and activates the 5HT2A receptors which causes hallucinations."
MDMA,387qvd,MBaggott,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:44:23 2015 UTC,I'm also skeptical about the speculation that MDA plays a role in MDMA effects in humans.

MDMA,387qvd,throwaway54266,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:52:50 2015 UTC,"Does anything besides grapefruit juice help reduce this? Does orange juice or Vitamin C pills?  I just rolled on Teslas (2 pills total spaced over 2.5hrs) and was having some visions. Towards the end of the night when I would close my eyes to kiss my SO I would see a 'vision', almost like a dream but it looked real. Each time it changed. Also a few times saw weird stuff like in the kitchen it was dark but it looked like little stars as well. Trippy. Probably due to how much MDMA I took.   We never took grapefruit juice but we did take VitC pills and orange juice which is why I ask. Thanks"
MDMA,387qvd,Mattytat,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:40:15 2015 UTC,As far as I know MDMA is a basic drug and Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) makes the urine more acidic meaning that the MDMA will become ionised due to it's basicity. Because of this it is now polar (charged) therefore will be unable to cross the non-polar membranes to be reabsorbed so dosing with VitC will cause quicker elimination of the drug and is recommended for use after. There's a supplementing guide on rollsafe.org and plenty more information on erowid.

MDMA,3894iq,rustbatman,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:28:07 2015 UTC,"Go for it. My SO has rolled on the same day as taking 50mg Elvanse and all has been fine. Of course it strains your heart a little bit more but taking MDMA with amphetamine has been done for ages, it makes the roll a little bit more speedy which is great for going out clubbing/dancing. But only if you take them together of course, taking prescription amphetamine the day before shouldn't make a huge difference one way or the other. (Other than a slight cross tolerance)"
MDMA,3894iq,suche1,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:31:09 2015 UTC,"Anything potential dangerous with this?   Are you asking about potential neurotoxicity? Yes, adderall increase dopamine and, to a lesser extent, serotonin. The increase in dopamine from adderall can potentiate the sertonin-driven neurotoxicity effects from ecstasy.  If you are going to do it anyway, I just recommend only making it a one time thing. If you have a choice to do something else, I would do something else. Any kind of stimulant, like adderall, methamphetamine, cocaine, caffeine, and so on increases dopamine that could potentially increase MDMA's neurotoxic effects. Just be wary. Take antioxidants to help (vitamin C)."

Serotonin is imho the biggest thing to look at when you want to combine MDMA with something else.  Taking 2cb the day after MDMA isn't something I'd advice, but since you are at a festival and you want to use anyway it would be the thing I'd suggest.  If someone asks for a 3 day festival I'd probably recommend: 4FMP - 2CB - MDMA."

When I was peaking I clearly remember thinking ""this is great, but I could really handle/want more of this"". From comparing to others and witnessing/researching, the effects I felt from the ~500mg wasn't what other people would consider ""rolling really hard""."
MDMA,389i3h,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"I think there are a lot of factors besides the quality of MDMA that contribute to whether you will have a good roll or not.   Regardless, you should always stay within a safe dosage range--it seems like 500 mg of MDMA is a very large dosage. Even if you go with a 1.5 mg/kg rule, your dosage should be about 163.3 mg. If you go with something much stronger, like a 2 mg/kg rule, then you should go with about 217.7 mg. Somewhere between there should be fine."
MDMA,389i3h,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:14:21 2015 UTC,"I've had past experiences with up to two points  or 200mg of molly (none of those had been tested, but according to experienced users who took the same stuff it was good). From those dosages, I felt very little. Going off that, if I know ~200 mg barely affects me, I clearly need to take more. I'm wondering if you have any thoughts/experience with people who need to take significantly larger doses to get any effect."
MDMA,389i3h,throwaway64dedr,-1,Tue Jun 2 21:09:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, maybe I was a little unclear about your original post. You are saying that the ONLY way that you have rolled is by taking 500 mg?   I'm wondering if you have any thoughts/experience with people who need to take significantly larger doses to get any effect.   I do not have experience with this. However, my thought is that there might be some variability in the correct starting dose for people. When I used to use about 8 years ago, I only got pills and never knew how much was inside.  My thoughts are as follows. Some things that might affect your roll are the amount of food you have in your stomach, how healthy you are, whether you preloaded on supplements, whether you take antidepressants, whether you take other drugs, the type of food you have in your stomach, how much sleep you got, how stressed you are, what you expect the roll to be like, the environment you are rolling in, whether you are accepting of what comes rather than focused solely on rolling, your starting dose, how soon you redosed, how you took your starting dose, whether you were around people you feel comfortable with, and so on."
MDMA,389i3h,BobbleheadDoll,-1,Tue Jun 2 21:19:30 2015 UTC,"Redosing isn't bad for you, mdma being neurotoxic should be enough for you to figure it out. It will be bad to redose, but hey, live in the moment right? Just take a month or couple month break in between dosing. Redosing extends the peak, why most people will redose.   From rollsafe.org: ""Guideline by body weight: 0.7mg/lb, or 1.54mg/kg. Optional Redose: 1/2 of the original dose, 2-3 hours in."" So for you: 168 mg and redose of 84 mg  From mollymeasure.com: 162mg if it is your first time 245mg for it not being your first time 245mg and redose of 122 mg 45-90 minutes later  Hope this helped! Be safe and have fun!"

THAT SAID - if you're planning on doing it anyways (and really, it sounds like you are):  It's up to you to decide the risks. I'd strongly suggest taking some 5htp for the next week or so to try and bump up your serotonin levels (since whether you rolled hard or not, you still used up that serotonin).  Make sure you eat well, are well hydrated, and get loads of sleep in the weeks leading up to rolling, especially if you want to roll hard and are disappointed in your last roll. Taking care of your body and brain can only be good for this type of high!  Get yourself some supplements to try to take the edge off the problems this might cause in your brain, so you're doing less damage.  After this time, take a good long break - a solid 6 months or so, or bare minimum 3 months, so that your brain can recover from having done it so often.  Stay safe, buddy!"

As a disclaimer for /r/mdma, i'm gonna give you my personal experience but please don't let it motivate you for your own MDMA use. Rolling frequently without at least a month break, is definitely not good for you and you are frying your brain.  WITH THAT SAID..  You are most likely low on serotonin, MDMA definitely drains it even if you didn't feel it. If you roll again your mind will definitely will be scraping up the scraps but honestly from personal experience you never know. Last weekend I rolled back to back at an event HARD, then went to a spontaneous event that following Thursday and stupidly rolled again. That last roll happened to be one of the hardest & cleanest rolls ever. I'm lucky that I was able to roll super hard every time but my body hated me after that.

MDMA,384x2p,stkstsk,3,Tue Jun 2 03:59:20 2015 UTC,"I think the drug works in such a way that if you were 100% committed to your girlfriend, you wouldn't have cheated on her. For me at least it's a 120% honesty drug and if really love your girlfriend the thought of cheating wouldn't come to you while rolling."
MDMA,384x2p,elijahsantos,2,Tue Jun 2 12:41:20 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right about that. I've rolled plenty o' times before without cheating, even given the opportunity. I just happen to like this girl that I rolled with, and I didn't feel like I could resist her. What you're saying is completely true, I don't know if I am in love with my gf anymore. I'm breaking up with her tonight."
MDMA,384x2p,chrisnguyen123,2,Wed Jun 3 04:31:47 2015 UTC,Girl comes up to me during a rave and asks me to dance but doesn't know where her boyfriend is.   I have made bad decisions with these type of things in the past and knowing myself now I couldn't let myself dance with this girl.  I could've simply said no sorry and walked away but instead I just stood there saying nothing for the next 20 minutes while she kept asking me to dance. I was rolling balls.

MDMA,384x2p,chrisnguyen123,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"Either the time I made out with like three or four girls at the same time (I'm a dude) while we groped each other to disco music in a friends backroom. Then I ended up fucking one of them until the early morning hours when I had to go to the dentist and she felt bad since she had apparently only broken up with her long time boyfriend like the previous day. Then one of the girls I was making out with kept trying to get me to come visit her and fuck her and a few of her friends at the same time. She was cute, but fuck her now, she screwed over a friend of mine.   Or the time that I took a ton of X with a friend in NYC on a trip, saw excision, met some cool girls there, then tried to find some pot. We asked some random people on the street if they could help us out, they said they could, and the three of them, my buddy and I, and the two cute girls we had known for all of an hour set off to the subway. We got on, did some shots of tequila with fresh lime that one of the drug dealers had stashed in his backpack, bought a blunt wrap, then headed towards their apartment. We got there, were greeted by the receptionist, then took the elevator to the top. Yeah. The dudes had like a penthouse apartment. So we smoked blunts on the balcony a stones throw away from the chrysler building until the sun came up and we realized that our instructors would be up soon. We said our goodbyes, walked the girls back to the station, then ran from homeless men that tried to rob us until we hit our hotel. We got there, decided to try to find the stairs so there was no risk of running into our instructors, but we couldn't find them. So we asked the bellboys outside who were super confused at two guys in matching tanktops and shorts in 50 degree weather and looking like we had danced and done drugs all night, mostly because we had. Turns out they werent bellboys, they were like airline captains and shit. We eventually made it back to our room without getting caught only to find one of our roommates in the bathroom. He came out and told us how horrible his night was. He got drunk, took a shit, then flushed (as is the custom). Unfortunately, when he flushed he knocked his toiletry bag into the toilette which clogged it, causing it to overflow all over the floor. He then had to dig through his own shit to clear the clog. This caused him to vomit profusely. Yeah.. That was a fun trip, well, for my buddy and i at least!!!!"

I was in a tent with my roommate and his girlfriend, rolling balls for the first time ever (I had only known my roommate for a month or so and was getting to know him better at the party). At one point his girlfriend offered to let me feel her boobs and I thought ""really?"" And looked at my roommate, who smiled and said ""go ahead!"" So I felt her up while my roommate watched. It was fun, though!"
MDMA,385ea4,dshort44,3,Mon Jun 1 23:49:26 2015 UTC,MDMA = MDMA.  Just test and make sure it's solid and you'll be fine :)
MDMA,385ea4,CoffeeNSquats,2,Mon Jun 1 23:55:58 2015 UTC,Thanks! The names of all the different shit always confuses me as I only do it once a year for EDC!! I thought it was all the same once you tested it but naturally everyone thinks their name is better.
MDMA,385ea4,CoffeeNSquats,2,Tue Jun 2 00:04:55 2015 UTC,"I'm going to contradict myself a little bit here, but names do matter.    MDMA is highly influenced by environment, mood, serotonin available, and all those things.  If you don't think so, think about the times you've vacationed to Vegas with your parents, and the times you've vacationed with friends.  Same locale, different feelings.    That being said, I'd want to take a Dom Perignon pill over something like a Green Strawberry any day.  I have friends who won't even touch batteries/heinekins because they've had a bad experience at a rave while rolling.  Again, all psychological even though they were tested and clean."
MDMA,385ea4,CoffeeNSquats,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:14:06 2015 UTC,"good to know!! I so agree with you on that...

MDMA,385ea4,CoffeeNSquats,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:20:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah of course!  There are many sites to check these on (Primarily in dutch, but google will translate it for you).

MDMA,385ea4,hallothar15,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:07:25 2015 UTC,"No.  MDMA is MDMA.  Though, there are 3 variations of the red UPS out right now.  There's Bright Red, Red, and Brown which looks oddly red.    The Orange Teslas actually got toned down in the current rotation too apparently.  Used to be in the 240+ range, now they're closer to 200-220."
MDMA,385ea4,CoffeeNSquats,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:22:49 2015 UTC,"The brown ones are considerably weaker than the others, red UPS is around 210mg average, brown UPS is around 160mg average  I've yet to see a single orange tesla test result yet everyone keeps acting like they're 250mg, everytime I hear that my bullshit alarm goes off (nothing against you I'm just saying I don't know where this rumour that they're so strong comes from)"

It is better to describe what you see particularly over the first 5 to 10seconds then 30 seconds and finally at 60 seconds) unless otherwise stated.  e.g.  Marquis : purple > black (hint of green)  Mecke: intense green > blue  Gallic: (some brown to start) > green (with some brown) > browning after mark time (60 seconds)  Liebermann: green > brown

MDMA,382b2s,arhombus,6,Fri Jun 5 11:57:54 2015 UTC,"Be careful, some of those reagents are highly toxic.  They're all pretty toxic, but Mecke in particular bad, containing selenous acid.  Good to test though :)  I wouldn't recommend using porcelein as a testing surface."
MDMA,382b2s,Safetest4,2,Mon Jun 1 14:09:14 2015 UTC,What would you recommend then?
MDMA,382b2s,arhombus,2,Mon Jun 1 14:30:34 2015 UTC,Glass is the best thing to use as it won't react to the acid.  Certain plastics will work as well.  CD case plastic seems alright.
MDMA,382b2s,Safetest4,2,Mon Jun 1 14:38:36 2015 UTC,"Good to test though :)  I wouldn't recommend using porcelein as a testing surface.   I had no idea. Might have to get a glass plate now!  Or for maximum ballin'ness, grab a CD and use its polycarbonate underside :)"
MDMA,382b2s,Safetest4,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:13:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed all the reagents will not do you any good but they are in very low amounts. The concentrated acids are more harmful and destructive. Use ceramics i.e. glass, plates etc and not the best porcelain!"
MDMA,382b2s,Henzington,2,Mon Jun 1 14:42:00 2015 UTC,Yes yes.  I don't want to argue but they are destructive even in small amounts.  Most use 97% sulfuric amount other corrosive acids.  All the best.
MDMA,382b2s,Safetest4,2,Mon Jun 1 15:00:05 2015 UTC,We know we manufacture them! The low amounts does not refer to the Acids it refers to the Selenious Acid that was spoken of. The sulphuric acid is going to get you before the Selenious acid does at a toxic level.
MDMA,384clj,mdmavspill66,5,Mon Jun 1 19:36:29 2015 UTC,"Well, if you have Euro pills they most likely are just MDMA (test them anyway) so  it doesn't really make a difference because MDMA = MDMA.  With that being said, the pills I've taken usually have come with a bit of amphetamine or other little mixey-wixey in them so ideally pills for clubbing/going out and crystals for home rolls because pure MDMA usually is pretty sedative. That's for me at least."
MDMA,384clj,suche1,2,Mon Jun 1 20:15:22 2015 UTC,I prefer crystal because i find its easier to control how much i take.
MDMA,384clj,RandallWho,2,Mon Jun 1 20:18:38 2015 UTC,Can be but if you know how much is in a pill you can always split it roughly.
MDMA,384clj,RandallWho,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:04:52 2015 UTC,sure you know your pill is 200-220mg and you cut it along the score. you know you will get anywhere from 90-110 mg  but i still preferring measuring out 100mg ahead of time and put it in caps then i can dose according to that.

MDMA,384clj,thecheddarman1,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:12:01 2015 UTC,"UK pills: we are talking random substances. What you enjoy the most depends on what is in your pill vs what your crystal is. If you want to do it in a sort of 'as long as I'm having a great time' kind of way, research previous pills you've taken by Googling their pattern and colour and you'll find out which substances in your pills that you enjoyed the most. For the future, maybe you'll want to buy some test kits for your drugs to see what you are taking and what you are enjoying.  Pure MDMA will usually be more chill then a pill or powder combined with other more 'speedy' drugs. Perhaps at a festival you may enjoy the speedier pills if you want to dance a lot but it does involve more risks."
MDMA,384clj,hallothar15,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:48:50 2015 UTC,"If you're going to get a random pill at a festival make sure you do your homework before, you could end up buying some random shit cut with PMA  The exact same can be said about powder but since all powder looks the same there's noway of differentiating it so doing your homework won't matter as it all looks the same, I'd just advise against buying powder at a festival"
MDMA,384ura,don_manfred,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:34:18 2015 UTC,Doms are testing at 160mg (155-164) and Teslas are testing at 200mg (185-214).    So whichever suits your needs.
MDMA,384ura,CoffeeNSquats,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:51:24 2015 UTC,Sounds like you get more MDMA per dollar if you go with Teslas.
MDMA,384ura,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:01:32 2015 UTC,"For dosage reasons, you might not want that.  Also because of the spread.    A lot of times it's also mental.  The doms do look like a really nice press."
MDMA,384ura,CoffeeNSquats,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:33:59 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by spread? Whether the MDMA is mixed evenly throughout the pill (i.e., homogeneous)?   Yeah, I guess it is ultimately the buyer's choice. If I were buying, I would go for the larger amount of MDMA and take a risk on whether the MDMA is homogeneous throughout the pill."
MDMA,384ura,BobbleheadDoll,2,Mon Jun 1 23:38:38 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Not every pill is pressed to be homogeneous.  Thats why usually there's a spread reported by the sites that have test results.    I suppose that makes sense to try and get the most bang for your buck for most people, but some like to be able to dose a little lower.  Esp if you have girls in your group that are 95lbs haha."
MDMA,384ura,CoffeeNSquats,2,Mon Jun 1 23:42:57 2015 UTC,"Not every pill is pressed to be homogeneous.   I should clarify. This refers to whether the MDMA is spread out evenly within a single pill.    Thats why usually there's a spread reported by the sites that have test results.   The spread you are referring to is the lowest and highest values obtained across a variety of the same pill. You could call this a range of values (although range technically refers to the differences between maximum and minimum score within a set of scores).   but some like to be able to dose a little lower. Esp if you have girls in your group that are 95lbs haha.   Yeah, that definitely makes sense, though those girls would be rolling balls if they took a large dose."
MDMA,384ura,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:47:52 2015 UTC,"Ah yes sorry, clarification makes sense.  From what I've seen it's different on breaks too (Left side vs right side of pills).

MDMA,385wgu,idk_anymore,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:01:38 2015 UTC,"so this seems about right, one thing, the ALA.  Read the back label more carefully to determine what type:  R-ALA - a lesser available form, but this doesn't mean its bad, you just need more of it at a time (200mg instead of 100mg)  Na-R-ALA - a ""better"" form, mainly because you just need less of it (100mg)  Your magnesium supplement is fine (I've used that exact brand before).  You can probably get by with just taking 1 of those pills, depending on your weight, but 2 is fine too (that'll equate to 400mg elemental Mg from Mg Glycinate)  Your EGCG is fine, just follow the recommended dosage and so is your 5HTP.    As you probably read, don't take the 5HTP supplement before or during your roll (or even within 12-24hrs after your last drop)  If you cant dose supplements during, then try to aim at taking them between 30min and 1hr before.  This will ensure that you have a decent amount of antioxidants in your body during your roll.  Be careful with that EGCG, its good to have in your body, but it'll also make you pee more if you take a lot of it...and that won't be fun while you're in the crowd at EDC.  When you get back to the hotel at night, dose your antioxidants again (ALA, Mg, etc.)  I'll be at EDC this year and what I plan to do is take one ravesafer ""prepar-e"" pack before going to the event and then one right when I get back each night.  Then the few days after the whole event taking their ""recover-e"" pack."

MDMA,384ou3,suche1,6,Mon Jun 1 20:54:40 2015 UTC,"The times I've done it, generally dropped it before leaving the car, then roll hits as we get into the club and have peed.    Not my thing though.  Would definitely rather drop at a rave.  Atmosphere is entirely different."
MDMA,384ou3,CoffeeNSquats,2,Mon Jun 1 21:52:40 2015 UTC,"I'd say tt depends on whether you are going to see a particular artist or performer (and if so what time their set is), and how comfortable you feel sneaking it into the club.  If you are going to see a particular artist, their set is later at night (3 to 4 hours after you enter), AND you feel comfortable bringing drugs into the club. I would try to take it in with you and take it later. That'll give you a chance to familiarize yourself with the layout of the club (where the restrooms, outside smoking areas, etc. are), assuming it is unfamiliar to you, before you are in another headspace. Also, you can time it so that you are peaking near when your preferred artist goes on the stage.  If you are just going for a good time and don't care about any particular performer OR you don't like the idea of smuggling it into the club, I would take it just before (or as soon as possible before) going inside - that way you wont change your mind before you even leave.. haha"
MDMA,384ou3,n1ll0,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:31:54 2015 UTC,"Also, depending on the dosage, it MAY be a bit intense.. I just went to a decent sized event (~2500 people) at a big warehouse-sized place and I had a super intense come-up.. It help me A LOT to go outside where it was cooler and limit the amount of stimuli I was experiencing as much as possible for like 5 minutes. I mostly just closed my eyes and tried to breathe slowly.. Even if it gets too intense for a few minutes, you'll be just fine afterward.. Good luck and enjoy :)"
MDMA,384ou3,n1ll0,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:34:50 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not going to see a particular artist but just to listen to the music in general, there are a few different DJs playing. Truthfully I haven't decided if I'm even gonna go yet, there's a big UG party happening later this month and I was entertaining the idea of candy flipping there for the first time but we'll see. Tough decisions, lol"
MDMA,384ou3,Bambalama,2,Tue Jun 2 08:08:49 2015 UTC,"I actually only drop on festivals and raves so I can only speak for that.  If we are on a festival I usually wait till I'm very near to the place in the crowd I want to roll in and then do it. So I am sober as I reach it but that feeling of bliss is sure to roll right around the corner. And at that moment I lose myself.  For raves I usually wait till I'm inside, go around  a bit and when I feel like it, drop."
MDMA,384ou3,stkstsk,2,Mon Jun 1 22:46:25 2015 UTC,"Either just before getting in the cab or right when I come inside. I think it's nicer to do it before, usually you come up about 10-20 minutes after entering DA CLUB"
MDMA,384ou3,stkstsk,1 point,Tue Jun 2 10:21:31 2015 UTC,"Usually it takes 2 hours for me to come up after dropping so timing is a little bit of an issue as well, lol"
MDMA,384ou3,just-chippin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:07:08 2015 UTC,"Haha wow yeah that's a tough one. If you drop as soon as you come inside you have to wait for 2hrs, but at the same time you usually have no idea if you're going to leave (stop predrinking and get to wherever) in 1, 2 or 3 hours (at least with my friends) so you can't really time it like that either."

MDMA,384ntf,LocoJuniro12,2,Mon Jun 1 20:48:05 2015 UTC,"From what i've read, amitriptyline isn't an SSRI, so it's more safe than your regular anti-depressants. To be on the safe side, maybe reduce her first dose of MDMA and if she's feeling ok after that (no bad side effects) try a regular sized redose.  Amitriptyline is a sedative, but in such a small dose i'm not sure how much of an effect it has on your GF. If it makes her sleepy throughout the day there's a chance it could affect her role.  EDIT: BobbleheadDoll is right, TCA (amitriptyline) IS an SSRI. I'll check my sources next time.   To add to this I would now definitely NOT RECOMMEND taking MDMA and SSRIs at the same time. I have no first hand experience but I know it can lead to Serotonin Syndrome (in extreme cases), which can be fatal."
MDMA,384ntf,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"From what i've read, amitriptyline isn't an SSRI, so it's more safe than your regular anti-depressants.    I would argue against this. Read this excerpt from the Wikipedia page here:   Amitriptyline acts primarily as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, with strong actions on the serotonin transporter and moderate effects on the norepinephrine transporter.[29][30]   This suggests that it is an SSRI and an SNRI. I suggest retracting or revising your original statement."
MDMA,384ntf,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:04:31 2015 UTC,"You can probably roll while taking it, but that is a bad idea. I used to take WellButrin and would often double or triple my WellButrin doses while rolling and redosing throughout the night. While this did often help the roll, I think this pattern of drug use really fucked my memory and attention up. So it is very dangerous in the neurotoxic sense.  Dosing like this is also very dangerous because it could put you at even greater risk of developing a stronger depression. For example, if she has had suicidal ideation before, then dosing like this could increase the frequency or intensity of suicidal ideation.   Therefore, I would strongly consider rolling while on antidepressants. If you want to roll, maybe stop taking your antidepressants for a few weeks. BUT THIS IS ALSO VERY DANGEROUS, ESPECIALLY IF NOT ADVISED BY YOUR DOCTOR.  It is important to keep in mind here that none of here are doctors, psychiatrists, neuroscientists, psychologists, or neurologists. Therefore, none of us are qualified to give you advice. The BEST advice is to tell your doctor that you want to take MDMA but you are worried about the contraindications with your antidepressant medication. If your doctor is unaware of these complications, then you need to find a new doctor (where doctor refers to a neuroscientist, psychoologist, and so on)."
MDMA,384ntf,suche1,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:54:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think OP implied she was suicidal or depressed, using amitriptyline only for her migraines? Even so, it never is a good idea to mix antidepressants with MDMA"
MDMA,384ntf,BobbleheadDoll,2,Mon Jun 1 21:00:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think OP implied she was suicidal or depressed, using amitriptyline only for her migraines?   That's true. I think the tone of my response sounded like I thought she had depression. I think I should clarify by stating that it is possible that she could experience depression-like symptoms, such as suicidal ideation, after mixing antidepressants with MDMA.   Even so, it never is a good idea to mix antidepressants with MDMA   Yeah, definitely not."
MDMA,384ntf,suche1,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:02:20 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I gotcha now! That's solid advice too, didn't know mixing MDMA and antidepressants could cause that"
MDMA,384ntf,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:07:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know either. But it is an educated guess.   Most anecdotal reports from MDMA users is that they feel blue, melancholy, and depressed for several days afterward. These are depression-like symptoms. These symptoms likely result from damage to serotonin and dopamine systems.  My point is that different people may experience different depression-like symptoms. I merely listed an example of an extreme depression-like symptom to illustrate my point. My guess is that these symptoms would be magnified if also combined with other 5-HT-dependent drugs."
MDMA,384ntf,suche1,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:12:47 2015 UTC,"Does she take it every night or is she allowed to (or capable of) not taking the amitriptyline for a while? I would ask a doctor for more help, if I was in her situation I'd take a break from my meds as long as needed (and is possible) before taking MDMA."

MDMA,384c3j,baconmma,3,Mon Jun 1 20:03:53 2015 UTC,It means it starts with MethyleneDioxy but the last part (MethAmphetamine) is unknown.  (I think)

MDMA,384c3j,BobbleheadDoll,5,Mon Jun 1 19:58:30 2015 UTC,It's not the same as meth
MDMA,384c3j,ITSTIMETODDDDDDDDUEL,4,Mon Jun 1 23:34:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry should have clarified, could be MDA or MDMA as far as I know. And kinda yeah, MDMA stands for 3,4-MethyleneDioxyMethAmphetamine"
MDMA,384c3j,BobbleheadDoll,2,Mon Jun 1 19:59:38 2015 UTC,Or MDAI
MDMA,384c3j,myvicesaccount,5,Mon Jun 1 22:03:33 2015 UTC,MDMA = ecstasy  the MA stands for methamphetamine. That's because ecstasy is a psychostimulant and is called a substituted amphetamine. It's all in the same family.
MDMA,384c3j,bobthetrucker,2,Mon Jun 1 20:12:18 2015 UTC,"But, to clarify, there is a considerable distinction between what is colloquially known as MDMA and meth."

The most successful reports have followed a program in which the two drugs are not used at the same time, nor even too closely spaced. It appears that the optimum time for the 2C-B is at, or just before, the final baseline recovery of the MDMA. It is as if the mental and emotional discoveries can be mobilized, and something done about them. This combination has several enthusiastic advocates in the psychotherapy world, and should be the basis of careful research when these materials become legal, and accepted by the medical community."""

MDMA,383l6t,MDAzing,2,Tue Jun 2 06:37:47 2015 UTC,I'm with you on this but it's definitely better to wait a couple of months in between rolls to get the full effect. Glad you had a good time though!
MDMA,383haa,FeelsLikeNoodles,2,Mon Jun 1 16:13:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on a variety of things, I would guess, such as how much food you have in your stomach, the thickness of the gel cap, amount of MDMA and so on. If you had a good roll, then it doesn't matter when it starts, right?"
MDMA,383haa,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:27:02 2015 UTC,Many things can be factors in the come up... I would likely say the first would be a tie between stomach contents and set/setting.
MDMA,383haa,mdmawesome1,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:23:31 2015 UTC,"be sure to crush your mdma well, dosing on an empty stomach will accelerate the process, and stomach acidity i think have its part in it. the lower it is the faster it absorb (dont take my word for it on this one)"

For me it usually takes 2 hours to the dot to start coming up but when it hits me I'd roll really hard and long. My friends just think it's odd if we drop at the same time and I come up after they've already come down a bit, lol. And I've always dropped an empty stomach too.  What's helped me though is antacids! If I take one or two antacids 30-45 minutes before dropping I will start to come up in 45 minutes.. the first time this happened it felt like a miracle, haha.

MDMA,38309l,lyfoon,4,Mon Jun 1 14:12:55 2015 UTC,having them in crystal form or pressed in pills does not effect how pure they are. You need to test it to be sure. It is easier to dose the crystal version (obviously). That's pretty much the only upside to them.
MDMA,38309l,BE_chems,2,Mon Jun 1 14:22:44 2015 UTC,I heard that it's a lot harder to cut it if it's in rock form is that true?
MDMA,38309l,VBundren,6,Mon Jun 1 14:25:01 2015 UTC,"Quite the opposite. You can't really add anything to an already pressed pill, but you can definitely add some shit to blend in with MDMA crystals. They grind up pretty easy so you'll likely get a powdery crystal-like material that may or may not be cut. Purity of MDMA doesn't just rely on being cut or uncut, it depends how well it was purified when be synthesized."
MDMA,38309l,VBundren,2,Mon Jun 1 14:45:05 2015 UTC,Meaning the chemist could be the only one who altars it so it would be more difficult? Or am I missing something .. :/
MDMA,38309l,_huckleberryfinn,2,Mon Jun 1 15:29:26 2015 UTC,"It's much less likely for a chemist to cut pressed pills. It does happen, that's why you should always check websites like Pillreport as well as test with reagents. However, it's much easier for a dealer to buy MDMA in crystal form then cut it with speed, meth, or whatever else he wants to add weight and also increase the effects of the high to keep you coming back."
MDMA,38309l,Maklo_Never_Forget,2,Mon Jun 1 15:56:48 2015 UTC,"ehh, im gna have to agree w/ VBundren on this one. if youre getting shards &some crushed powder, theres too much room for contaminants. although, if it is a SOLID rock, sure theres less room for contamination &adulteration, but even then it could just be methylone or some other rock shaped chemical. w/well known pressed pills, there is practically no room for contamination unless the dealer is crushing it down, adulterating, then re-pressing it back into a well known stamp, which is more than highly unlikely.       bottom line, no real sure way of knowing whats in your baggie unless you get a test kit. with that being said though, if you had pure mdma in rock form, &pill form, should be just about the same, just different purity levels. happy safe rolling my friend"
MDMA,38309l,thecheddarman1,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"A chemist usually doesnt press the pills. A chemist makes the MDMA and works together with, or sells it to, the people who press the press."
MDMA,38309l,VBundren,2,Tue Jun 2 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"It is definitely not ""quite the opposite"". Just because the street dealer can't put other things in it doesn't mean that the manufacture hasn't. Crystals are definitely more likely to be just MDMA than your average pills.   If you're getting crystals, why would you most likely get a powdery crystal-like material? Who says this? It would be so easily noticeable if there was another random powder accompanying your crystals if there is a reasonable amount."
MDMA,38309l,B42m0row,5,Mon Jun 1 15:57:48 2015 UTC,"You must have had good dealers all your life. I've seen a lot of ""Molly"" before. I'm not saying it'll be powdery, but even if it is crystals there will be powder at he bottom of the bag (or capsule) from the crystals rubbing. I'm just saying I have seen people cut this with meth, speed, and even finely ground Ritalin and it can be hard to notice to your average Joe as it mixes in the power.   Like I said, manufacturers of pressed pills do sometimes cut. Some even make fake pills. I've just seen A LOT more cut crystal MDMA than I have bunk pressed pills."
MDMA,38309l,VBundren,-1,Mon Jun 1 16:03:54 2015 UTC,almost all mdma ive got from my dealer (who is also a trusted friend) were whole rocks which he would crush in 3 or 4 smaller rocks in front of me to deal a cut.
MDMA,38309l,B42m0row,2,Mon Jun 1 17:26:48 2015 UTC,"Of course I've gotten more points like that than what I described, but that's not the point I'm trying to make. Based on my experiences, I'd be more likely to find cut crystals on the street than if I were to order pressed pills from the DNM."
MDMA,38309l,Maklo_Never_Forget,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:31:13 2015 UTC,"True for powder/powdery rock maybe, you can put some white powder in the small white mdma crystals. But for a real mdma rock its really harder to cut as where you need to heat it to make fusion with another chemical. Usually i get a tan white rock, some parts are more brownish and there is no other product than that rock and what composes it (no added powder or differwnt crystals mixed up. As for a pressed pill whatever powder you mix up you can add a binding agent and color and you got yourself a pressed pill of whatever powder you wanted to put in.  Edit: sure you cant add anything to the pill but you can form a pill with whatever powder you want"
MDMA,38309l,Maklo_Never_Forget,2,Mon Jun 1 16:36:12 2015 UTC,my dealer told me that I'd be getting MDMA rocks and told me   ''my dealer told me''  Your dealer will probably tell you anything to get you to buy his product instead of something else :)

MDMA,382h2r,ErdeTyrene,3,Mon Jun 1 11:19:15 2015 UTC,"I think it just has to do with the enormous amount of other factors involved. To test your hypothesis, purchase a large batch (multiple grams) of MDMA. My guess is, you will still get both types of rolls from the same batch (cuz mdma = mdma).  I've experienced both great rolls and the empty ones you describe from the exact same batch (seemingly at random, just like you say)"
MDMA,382h2r,Sanderbokskabouter,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:38:43 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying.  Evidence says that your non-Shulgin MDMA experience is perhaps just a weaker dose.   It's very possible to get MDMA that looks great, only to have purity in the 70% range.  It is highly unlikely that you've gotten an isolated R stereoisomer of MDMA in your bad batch (or batches, idk).  Highly unlikely bordering on impossible.  I'll tell you one thing.  I have a batch of M that I keep in my head stash.  It's amazing, like you said in your first example.  Just an atomic bomb in your head.  ""Oh my god"" when you first hit the peak.  Every time I take it, it's amazing, even if I had done it only a few weeks prior.  No loss in magic, just amazing and hits hard.  I generally take 130mg, which is above the suggested 1.5mg/kg dose (which would be about 100-110mg for me).  I've had other batches which have been lab tested as just MDMA (though with no qualitative analysis done) that no matter if I take a higher dose, it just doesn't feel like the other stuff.    Possible explanation:   The good batch I have is pure and that's what MDMA is supposed to be.  Other batches are weak.  Either due to lack of skill of chemist, or low purity precursors. (There are no analogs of sassafras oil, it either is or is not, however there might be other chemicals in it when purchased)   Know that safrole is not the only route to MDP2P/PMK to MDMA.  MDMA can be made from eugenol as well afaik.  You're not getting a stereoisomer though, I'm almost positive of that.   All the known synthesis routes produce racemic MDMA and no chemist is gonna isomerize MDMA.  No point."
MDMA,382h2r,myvicesaccount,0,Tue Jun 2 01:40:45 2015 UTC,Jesus fucking Christ I'm sorry for going off like this but A MOLECULE IS A MOLECULE. Can we put that at the fucking top of this subreddit or make it part of every post.  We've had this discussion about one fucking zillion times.

MDMA,382h2r,myvicesaccount,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:42:30 2015 UTC,"Simple version: because chemistry.  Longer version:    There are four principal precursors which can be used in the manufacture of MDMA and related drugs: safrole, isosafrole, piperonal and 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-2-propanone (PMK). Safrole is the key starting material in so far as the other three can be synthesised from it. In the original Merck patent of 1914, safrole was reacted with hydrobromic acid to form bromosafrole, which was converted to MDMA using methylamine. Many illicit syntheses start with PMK and use either the Leuckart route or various reductive aminations including the aluminium foil method. All of these methods produce racemic MDMA."

MDMA,382h2r,suche1,0,Tue Jun 2 07:58:52 2015 UTC,"Hm, not really sure what to say on this. I've always thought that two rolls could never be exactly the same because there's too many variables and that it's OK. Did something stressful happen a week before dropping? Or have you had an amazing month and MDMA topped it all off? Even though you seem absolutely certain it's not a set&setting -thing, a roll can be affected by pretty much anything, much like with psychedelics. Even the batch of MDMA itself can affect your rolls of course, I'm not denying that.  I have never really noticed this kind of difference in my rolls though but I don't actively look for a certain feeling when I take MDMA, I just let it take me where ever it wants to go. I've never had a roll that was absolutely similar to one before, sometimes there's insane euphoria and empathy, other times there's less empathy and that's completely all right. I don't attribute this to ""different MDMA"" but to different set&setting - because it never is the same. And that's the beauty of it too, wouldn't you get bored if you knew EXACTLY how your roll was gonna go from minute 1 to the end of the night? I know I would :x"
MDMA,382h2r,suche1,2,Mon Jun 1 12:24:26 2015 UTC,"Sure you will know to an extent of what's going to happen but there will be variations no matter what, MDMA being a psychoactive substance. Have you ever had two absolutely identical rolls to the dot? I've never had, even home rolls have felt very different despite having used the same batch of MDMA as months before. My belief is that this occurs because even though the setting is the same as before the set isn't, meaning I could be stressed over reason X and I wasn't stressed over reason X the last time I rolled."
MDMA,382h2r,mdmawesome1,2,Mon Jun 1 12:57:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, as I have also had same batch of MDMA (tested) that I capped myself and took 2-3 months apart and have had varying things happen the week of and have noticed they do in fact, have an impact on the amount of euphoria/empathy of the roll... You may not think about it or think it could possibly be a factor... but even what you eat the week up to the drop has been noticed by myself and others as well (possibly a placebo on both mine and OPs part as well)"
MDMA,382h2r,Bhap1,0,Mon Jun 1 14:00:19 2015 UTC,"To me the difference is like an atomic bomb going off in my brain. It's hard to articulate the level of difference. One roll is what mdma is all about, the other roll is is nearly purely physical without the mental effects.  I understand the lovey feeling with mdma comes from oxytocin being touched upon. The empty MDMA completely lacks this 100%.   It's not just me either, a group of 6 people myself included all experienced the same mediocre experience. We had fun, the mdma worked... But there's something not right with it. No love, minimal euphoria.. Your correct in saying not all rolls are the same..   But the difference in these seemingly different batches is far, far too huge to be just a result of diet or expectations etc.  I could be wrong but there's a large number of people I know who are experiencing the same thing"
MDMA,382h2r,kassnl,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:39:25 2015 UTC,"It's purity issues and lots of variables such as what you've eat, your mental state, how much you take, how much serotonin is in your brain etc, simple as."

MDMA,380ym2,jonathanmvu,11,Mon Jun 1 01:25:16 2015 UTC,"I suggest not rolling all three days. The second day will have reduced effects, and the third day will have very reduced (almost non-existent) effects. Adderall also has a small cross-tolerance with MDMA. In addition, an Adderall + MDMA combo will increase your risk of overheating (and keep in mind this festival is out in the desert).   Consider this safer (and in my opinion, more fun) plan:  Day 1: Since you already have Adderall, try combing Adderall + Phenibut. Phenibut is legal and and can be bought online. This combo will reportedly give you euphoria and increased sociability. Be careful not to get hooked on Phenibut since it is dependence-building. Basically treat it as a ""once a month"" thing like molly and you'll be fine.  Day 2: Acid (no candyflip).  Day 3: The grand finale, roll your balls off on MDMA.  Alternatively, if you can get your hands on some 2-CB, do that day 1 as it doesn't have a cross-tolerance with either acid or MDMA."
MDMA,380ym2,GekkoPie,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:27:49 2015 UTC,thanks for the tip. I'll look into Phenibut. Is there a cross tolerance between Phenibut and MDMA and LSD?

MDMA,380ym2,sgchubbz,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:11:47 2015 UTC,I would suggest doing the acid the first day that way you're not having to deal with the day after come down thoughts while tripping. Maybe you can even candyflip the first night and take the second night off and roll again on the third night.
MDMA,381y7y,GrizzliesFTW91,2,Mon Jun 1 07:08:11 2015 UTC,People said the come down is terrible or the effects isn't as strong as the first night. Is this true?   it depends on the person.  in the past i have gone to three day parties where i was rolling pretty much the entire time. I never noticed a difference.  however there have been other times where if i let my self come down its hard to get back up.   Or does it just depend on some people?   This. Some people can roll the next day others can not.  Same with come downs. i havent had bad come down in years and i do way more now then when i started.  The biggest reason against rolling three days  is it is bad thing to do if you are following all the harm reduction guidelines.  But if you know yourself and you know your limits then go for it.
MDMA,381y7y,RandallWho,3,Mon Jun 1 20:31:50 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether you actually roll 3 nights in a row, popping ecstasy for 3 nights in a row is terrible for your brain. That's why people do not recommend it. To roll responsibly, you should make sure there is AT LEAST one month in between rolls."
MDMA,381y7y,BobbleheadDoll,0,Mon Jun 1 07:32:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are other reasons why. I should clarify that I think the most important reason is harm reduction.  But yeah, the comedown will suck, you won't roll as hard or might not even roll, you will be exhausted, and you could stay depressed for a pretty long time."
MDMA,381y7y,BobbleheadDoll,5,Mon Jun 1 07:40:48 2015 UTC,"Harm reduction is a framework that assumes that people will use drugs even if you tell them not to, so the goal is to reduce any potential harm that could befall someone using drugs. This usually means that we should try to educate ourselves as best as we can for the safest drug use practices. Please go ahead and read the information on the sidebar in regard to using ecstasy responsibly. Also, there have been many posts in the past week or so about how to reduce the chances of neurotoxicity. Arm Yourself with knowledge and you could save yours or another persons life."
MDMA,381y7y,BobbleheadDoll,2,Mon Jun 1 07:42:46 2015 UTC,"Last weekend I rolled two days in a row then rolled again the following Thursday.   Rolled hard every single time, came down a bit faster the second day of going back to back. Comedown was minimal, came to terms that my body was obviously going to be sick for the following few days so it didn't catch me off guard. The Thursday when I rolled again, probably one of the hardest/cleanest rolls i've ever had.  Not rolling again until HARD Summer (cause 2 months).  I believe everyone is different when it comes to how you will react to MDMA, but I also believe there is no doubt that no matter the roll you get, you are definitely frying your brain. That's where the self control comes in.  EDIT: I did have Vicks, Purell for massages, and a shit ton of Emergen-C   EDIT 2: Lol downvoted for giving an honest experience.. typical /r/MDMA"

MDMA,380ibs,adderyn,2,Mon Jun 1 00:11:48 2015 UTC,Ive used a mouthguard before and it worked pretty well. I think you can get one made for braces.
MDMA,380ibs,ggknight_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:03:28 2015 UTC,You can also buy generic storebought ones. I have one brand that sits in the middle of each side of your mouth and has a band that wraps around so you don't swallow it. It has a size adjustment thing on it. It's shitty for sleeping with but for something to bite on while rolling it would probably work fine. Getting a mouthguard made is expensive and it's hard to get your insurance to do it unless you can show that you really need it to sleep or whatever.

MDMA,380ibs,1884848199939,3,Mon Jun 1 00:30:59 2015 UTC,Why is it terrifying? It just makes you grind your teeth. Sometimes it makes your jaw hurt. It happens sometimes.

MD visuals are the best tho. They're so real. Last time when I was trying to sleep, hundreds of campaign glasses were staked up tipping and over like dominos. Liquid was splashing everywhere with colorful fireworks going off behind, reflecting on the glasses. There were camera angles and everything. I looked mad trying to explain it to my gf at the time"

MDMA,37zz6l,MDAzing,5,Mon Jun 1 01:00:30 2015 UTC,"Ok so a majority of the visuals come later in the trip, and this is due to around 10% of the MDMA being metabloized into MDA.  The MDA causes the visuals  if you want a more visual experience I suggest getting MDA, but be aware that it is more neurotoxic than MDMA, lasts longer, and hits you harder.  Its a very fun drug, little less lovey dovey feeling, but if you desire you can drop a lil of MDMA with it, maybe like 100mg MDA 50mg MDMA.  One night when I took MDA (Way too fucking much mind you, i was a noob) i was having closed eye visuals for like 2 hours when going to bed, after smoking 5+ bowls of weed.  Was crazy"
MDMA,37zz6l,sillySTALIN,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:57:09 2015 UTC,Also MDA has a very positive reaction to cannabis while MDMA has mixed results and a few downsides. I love mda and wish it was less intense as its noticeable more neurotoxic. But at the same time I am satisfied a lot longer and its worth several trips.

I had taken just one pill that night ~190mg  Second time things started getting trippy was at a house party a month back. Where everyone had gone to bed and I was sleeping on the couch. I thought everyone came back and started raving. I was dancing by myself in a dark empty room for 10 minutes. I took 2 pills that night ~280mg total  I loved both experiences and still laugh about it when I think about it

After pointing it out to my friend i straight away realised i fucked up and was hallucinating, and when i looked back there was no needles at all. On the way back home on the tram,  and at home when i was about to sleep me and my friend were both having weird closed eye visuals and we were describing them to each other.

Never had open eye visuals before.  I wish I could get the tracers at lower doses because they were pretty fun the two times I got them, but I don't think it's healthy to take that much.

Also there was some trippy stuff going on with peoples tail lights (like the lights looked like they were glowing and popping out from the car. Haha there was some weird ass forest of closely spaced traffic cone things that all had this diagonal white and orange striped pattern.. had to go through that for like a half a mile so that was a little weird too hahah.

MDMA,37zz6l,Martindaman,2,Mon Jun 1 00:59:58 2015 UTC,I've had closed eye visuals at about 150mg but I am quite light (66kg male). Those were the whole of my vision filling up with miniature spinning and overlapping pepsi logos which was weird. Open eye visuals came on after 250mg later on in the evening where my wall turned into an old style movie screen and I thought I was watching an old stop motion cartoon.

MDMA,37zmy5,amigaos,23,Sun May 31 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"My best advice is to remember that the person you are rolling is you. Yes you feel less inhibited but that's still you. And you can be that person whenever you want, it's just a mental block. Learn to remove the block without drugs and you'll be golden."
MDMA,37zmy5,ChemEPHD,5,Mon Jun 1 01:31:51 2015 UTC,This is actually my goal. Thank you very much for your encouraging words!
MDMA,37zmy5,DopeDealerForKids,7,Mon Jun 1 10:50:14 2015 UTC,You could always try and behave as though you're rolling? Not so much the jaw clenching and sweating but be as confident and as outgoing as you were when you rolled. It's not going to come across the wrong way because that's how you got a date in the first place! :)
MDMA,37zmy5,BobbleheadDoll,3,Sun May 31 22:01:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I really would like to do that, just talking about what I feel like without fearing any negative judgement. But I'm not sure if it's as easy as it sounds.  Do you think I can do that? Did you try it out yourself?"
MDMA,37zmy5,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sun May 31 22:23:23 2015 UTC,"To be honest, as attractive as she may be if she judges you negatively and thinks you're a weird person or are strange then she's not the right person for you. I would just go for it, if she seems to be reacting badly maybe tone it down but stay confident"
MDMA,37zmy5,BobbleheadDoll,2,Mon Jun 1 15:50:09 2015 UTC,"The first time I rolled I met the greatest love of my life. We didn't hook up that night, but just made that mdma influenced bond. She asked me over a few days later and I was probably a lot like you are afraid you will be. Not the same outgoing person she met just a few days earlier. I was much younger back then and very naive so I did not pick up on any of her flirting or advances. I even slept on top of the sheets next to her in bed. She thought it was sweet and I finally got wise to what was happening soon after. Out of all the times I rolled, the best nights were with her.  You'll do fine OP. Just be yourself.   Now that I reread your post, she wasn't rolling too was she? She doesn't know you were either? Or at least you don't think she knows. I bet she does."
MDMA,37zmy5,Leatherpig,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:31:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you! :) I really will just try to be myself.  No, she wasn't rolling. And I don't think she knows I was. She's kind of the good girl who hasn't even smoked weed yet."
MDMA,37zmy5,dallasdarling,2,Mon Jun 1 10:53:38 2015 UTC,Thank you all very much for your responses and your advice! This is really the most welcoming and friendly sub I ever entered.
MDMA,37zmy5,crispydank,4,Mon Jun 1 10:54:31 2015 UTC,"Just be yourself. If she doesn't like you, then it is her loss. She obviously liked you enough to meet with her, so use that as your confidence boost. You guys can get a couple of drinks on your date--that could help, too. But do not take MDMA before your date--you literally just rolled. You should take at least a one month break before rolling again."
MDMA,37zmy5,TheodorTheDolphin,2,Sun May 31 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your responsible advice! I won't be rolling for at least the next two months. While I adore the feeling, staying safe is more important to me.  I'd value your opinion about telling her that I was rolling."
MDMA,37zmy5,TheodorTheDolphin,1 point,Sun May 31 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"I'd value your opinion about telling her that I was rolling.   Does she roll herself? Or use any kind of hard drug? Stating this openly might scare some people off, and, my personal opinion is that drugs are a personal choice. No one else's business. That is just the kind of person I am--I like to keep it to myself.  However, if you are the kind of person that needs to be open and honest about everything you do, then go for it.  But you cannot expect people clean from drugs to understand. If you want to bring it up, I would try to gauge whether she has used drugs before, and then go from there. You might have a different opinion.  Also, if you want to discuss it because you somehow feel guilty or deceitful about using drugs when she didn't know about it, I wouldn't recommend coming clean because of this. You do not owe her anything. But see above comments to make the decision for yourself."
MDMA,37zmy5,chrisnguyen123,2,Sun May 31 19:47:32 2015 UTC,"I guess you're right. Unless she asks me directly, I'll probably just keep it to myself. Thank you very much for your response!"

MDMA,37y6wv,5-Hydroxytryptamine-,4,Sun May 31 13:15:31 2015 UTC,"Rolled with a friend last night and it was his first time as well. He had his doubts about how good it was going to be, as I had hyped it up quite a bit. But an hour into our roll I asked him how he felt, and he just looked me in the eyes, hugged me harder than he's ever done before, and told me how much he loved me and how he felt happier than ever.

MDMA,37y6wv,Kadoir,3,Sun May 31 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"Rolled for my first time last night as well. Amazing experience, Ive heard that rolling never feels as good as the first time though, is this true?"
MDMA,37y6wv,OmfgHaxx,7,Sun May 31 19:24:24 2015 UTC,"Used responsibly, it can absolutely feel as good as the first time. The first experience is just distinct though, because of the surprise factor of feeling something you've never felt before."
MDMA,37y6wv,tangerineskyz,2,Sun May 31 19:38:38 2015 UTC,"What's responsible use though really? I'm planning on waiting for my second time for at least 3 months, to let my brain cope with this process, like i literally need time to process what happened last night haha.  Also, i feel like this could be an extremely addictive drug to me, as i absolutely loved it, and i really wanna do it again soon; i'm just not gonna do it because it woild be irresponsible, but i can definitely see myself get addicted to this feeling if i don't watch out..."
MDMA,37y6wv,tangerineskyz,3,Sun May 31 21:29:23 2015 UTC,"There is by no means a scientific basis for what ""responsible use"" is, but from what I've read on various forums, it is recommended to do it no more than once every 3-4 months. Because of festival season, I have sometimes used it only a month apart, but then not for the rest of the year.  And the feeling of rolling is ""addictive"" for sure, but it's actually basically impossible to become an ""mdma addict"" because of the mechanism of how the drug works. It increases serotonin release in your brain, but if this drug-induced abnormally high serotonin release occurs too frequently, your serotonin receptors downregulate and your neurons are unable to produce more serotonin fast enough to keep up with the drug-induced release, so the drug would simply cease to work at some point if used excessively, even if you took a very high dose."

MDMA,37y6wv,jmsloderb,3,Sun May 31 23:55:47 2015 UTC,"I mean I guess it's that way with most things (first kiss, first skydive, etc.) just because of the novelty at the time. However I personally think this point gets overemphasized sometimes. To the point it makes people think subsequent times aren't going to be even close to it. But while my first time was great it would be hard for me to rank my rolls they've all been so good (and I don't think I'd even rate my first time as the best). I just change up my environment or activities I do during each roll a little bit so they feel unique. Which is easy to do when usage is spread out every few months like a special event."

MDMA,37zxa6,Ismellgorillas,9,Sun May 31 20:37:44 2015 UTC,"Serious advice from someone who has been in a similar situation: Do not assume that MDMA magically makes your mental health issues disappear. Yes, the short-term effects are amazing, and they give you a good baseline to work with, but if you don't work on the underlying issues you can relapse very easily.  Use the platform MDMA gave you and start therapy while you are in a good place. Don't make the mistake I made and assume that no symptoms = healed forever."
MDMA,37zxa6,Draewa,4,Sun May 31 22:48:20 2015 UTC,"Correct, don't rely on MDMA to solve all your problems. It's a great drug with a great effect, and can be used in therapies to help greatly, but it doesn't solve things on its own directly."
MDMA,37zxa6,mmine1,3,Mon Jun 1 04:58:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly. LSD, psilocybin, and MDMA can take you out of your own mindset and show you a completely different way of thinking that you may have never considered before. But that does not mean everything is cured. Often, during times of adversity, I have remembered my experiences and what I've learned from them and they've helped me. I also find that my experiences have opened me up to also doing healthier activities, such as eating healthier, exercising, meditating, listening to my higher self, etc. They aren't magic cure-alls, but they definitely can change you for the better if you put in the effort."
MDMA,37zxa6,long_live_mcqueen,5,Mon Jun 1 12:19:46 2015 UTC,"It's funny, I tripped on LSD a while back, and it was a pretty shocking experience. I lost touch with reality completely, and for the months following the experience, I had a looooooong existential crisis because of it.  I then accidentally tripped on 80ug, almost had reality fall apart again, but somehow, this time it helped reassure me it was simply a weird drug experience, and that I was fine."
MDMA,38006l,thelittlecoon,6,Sun May 31 20:59:06 2015 UTC,It's normal to hallucinate during the comedown especially if you take 300-400mg+ usually for me its closer to the 400mg mark. If I keep my doses lower I don't hallucinate.
MDMA,38006l,ChemEPHD,4,Mon Jun 1 01:29:55 2015 UTC,"Haha I was trying to unlock my phone once on a very strong roll when one of my friends suddenly asks ""wtf are you doing?"" turns out my phone was still in my pocket and I was just holding air like a complete retard haha. Weird thing was that I fully hallucinated my phone in my hand and when my friend talked to me I ""snapped out of it"" and realized what I was actually doing."
MDMA,38006l,phacid,3,Mon Jun 1 04:54:53 2015 UTC,"So, I have hallucinated before on MDMA. I was at a party and everyone had gone to bed for the night (or left or something), and I was alone and trying to sleep. I was still rolling balls, except my peak had passed, and no one was there. And then, I saw someone in front of me and they asked me a question. Then I started talking to them out loud. When they didn't respond, I realized that there was actually no one there--I was all alone. It really freaked me out, because I did not realize that MDMA could cause hallucinations. But I was not so freaked out, especially when I realized they were not real. Still, though, it was unnerving. I just closed my eyes and had closed eyes visuals. It took forever to fall asleep (I always hate comedowns).  Just remember, it is just a drug, it will pass. You are safe, and it will all go away soon. Don't worry--this stuff happens!"

MDMA,380lgk,JezAbershawe,2,Sun May 31 23:39:23 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, taking speed after MDMA increases neurotoxicity by a lot (due to the stimulated release of dopamine). That said, I tried speed and then MDMA once and I had a beautifull roll."
MDMA,380lgk,Razorlike,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:43:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, good to know!  So, speed up front then MD?"
MDMA,380lgk,Razorlike,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:47:45 2015 UTC,"So I don't know a lot about this, but one theory of MDMA's neurotoxicity is that uptake of dopamine on the serotonine receptor causes damage. Ergo, taking amfetamine, which release more dopamine, would mean more damage.  One other key factor is body temperature. This is a factor which is almost surely related to neurotoxicity. Taking both speed and mdma will make you warmer and thus increase damage.  All I can suggest is taking a small dosage of speed and then take your first bump of mdma as late as possible (depending on your party timeline). Pay extra attention to heart rate, hydration and body temperature."

MDMA,381190,psychedelic_dude,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:56:12 2015 UTC,yeah I think that'd be the case  I have an event coming up and if taking one single dose was better then there'd be no need to smuggle it in
MDMA,381190,BobbleheadDoll,2,Mon Jun 1 03:19:41 2015 UTC,"The first one, I think. Probably worse come down. Redosing increases likelihood of neurotoxicity by reactivating the same 5-HT depleting mechanisms after you are already depleted. Excess 5-HT results in excess neurotoxcity."
MDMA,381190,xeyve,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:43:44 2015 UTC,"Hey, just so you know what you're saying is wrong.   The increased in NT is due to MDMA ability to inhibit it's own primary metabolic pathway by different mechanism.  It is theorized that MDA and other metabolites are mostly responsible for neurotoxic effect.   MDMA release 5-HT by reversing the action of the vesicular transporter. You wont increase neurotoxicity by trying to empty an empty vesicule."
MDMA,381190,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:40:55 2015 UTC,"There are many reasons for the neurotoxic effects. hyperthermia, excess DA, excess 5-HT, and oxidative stress. See one of my previous comments for a little bit of info in this regard.   MDMA release 5-HT by reversing the action of the vesicular transporter.    Actually, MDMA blocks reuptake of 5-HT, if I remember correclty, flooding the synapse with 5-HT. This increases the likelihood of 5-HT binding. Therefore, increasing the release of MDMA could increase neurotoxic effects."
MDMA,381190,xeyve,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:52:53 2015 UTC,"Hyperthermia is one of those way MDMA inhibit in's own metabolic pathway. A rise in temperature change the ration of metabolization more toward the MDA route.    Activation of TAAR1 by MDMA triggers protein kinase A and protein kinase C signaling events which then phosphorylates the associated monoamine transporters – DAT, NET, or SERT – of the neuron.[45] In turn, these phosphorylated monoamine transporters either reverse transport direction – i.e., move neurotransmitters from the cytosol to the synaptic cleft – or withdraw into the neuron, respectively producing neurotransmitter efflux and noncompetitive reuptake inhibition at the neuronal membrane transporters.[45]   It kinda does both with some fun competitive antagonism of monoamine oxidase, but the flooding part is really due to SERT reversal."
MDMA,381190,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:23:16 2015 UTC,"In turn, these phosphorylated monoamine transporters either reverse transport direction – i.e., move neurotransmitters from the cytosol to the synaptic cleft – or withdraw into the neuron, respectively producing neurotransmitter efflux and noncompetitive reuptake inhibition at the neuronal membrane transporters.[45]   Either way, it is the same result--more serotonin in the synaptic cleft.

As for the issue at hand, what did you do while you were rolling. Whatever was be it raving or running or what have you, try doing it again. It won't be as fun but you will get some flash backs and it can help remind you that there is a happy version of yourself inside you. You just have to let him out. Raving is my favorite example because that environment helps remove a lot of anxiety for me and I just think about how I would act if I was rolling and it helps improve my mood greatly."

Did she take it all at once? Did she take it with you, or did she take it with other people?    She said she feels kind of funky today but that it's getting better.    This is normal.   I really don't want her to go through what I went through.   You are worried about your girlfriend getting a panic attack? Is your girlfriend worried about getting a panic attack?

I had a buddy who would almost always roll solo because of this. When we ended up popping together he would just sit indian style on the couch and not say a word. I really dont think there is anything you can do that will tell your body to act a different way on MDMA. Its quite an overwhelming drug and you feel what you feel. I will also say this since pills these days are pretty much pure MDMA (all the euros) the roll is a lot different than back in the day when they were cut with a bunch of shit (my friends always joke about how they want that uppy roll that they used to get from those cut pills). The roll is a lot more... personal, more secluded i'd say. Granted I still take them at events and have a good time, just saying it isn't too unimaginable that you guys would feel the way you do. I myself would be interested in hearing suggestions on how you would change that, doesn't seem like you can just tell yourself to be more social and I would personally never suggest taking something else with your MDMA to get there (like Adderall)"

MDMA,37z070,DabErrlDoYa,1 point,Sun May 31 21:20:33 2015 UTC,I don't drink beforehand often but it's completely okay in my experience to drink a bit before.

MDMA,37z070,Razorlike,1 point,Sun May 31 18:43:04 2015 UTC,I am normally very active... But this may be the problem. I usually drop on a Friday night after working all week and exercising every day

Even going out for a walk seems ridiculous because I can barely stand up, or I could but I'd just rather roll on my couch...   Anyway, some people suggest just forcing it. You have to push through the sedated feeling, force yourself up and start moving. Eventually you won't even want to sit down but keep on dancing and moving. I don't mind the sedated feeling, I love it, so I haven't tried this on myself yet :P  Oh, and if you're open to other chemicals then you might want to take some amphetamine or caffeine to boost your energy."

MDMA,37zdbb,throwaway98765452567,5,Sun May 31 18:10:52 2015 UTC,The main thing I can think of is just to relax and don't expect too much. Have fun regardless of the roll and don't let the party be about the rolling. If you don't feel a lot (which can happen your first time) try to enjoy everything that IS happening instead of focusing on the peak you are missing out on.
MDMA,37zdbb,Razorlike,1 point,Sun May 31 18:40:59 2015 UTC,So just take it easy and relax. Gotcha!
MDMA,37zdbb,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sun May 31 18:47:08 2015 UTC,Test your MDMA first. Stay hydrated (but not too hydrated) by sipping water every so often. Take some Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplements to reduce chances of neurotoxicity.  What will your environment be?

MDMA,37zdbb,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Sun May 31 19:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yes! They definitely will, because you will feel very comfortable in them (that's obvious, right?).  Make sure you get a really super soft blanket or something that you guys can cuddle with.   If it means anything, we kind of have a thing going on???   This means something. Do not worry if you cannot get an erection (happens), but just enjoy the moment and the intimacy with each other. Ecstasy as a couple is about getting to know yourself, the other person, and accepting each other for who you are.  Just have a good time! You can also consider taking a shower with the lights out with some music blasting in the bathroom. Lather each other up but be careful about the water temperature and staying in too long (overheating is not good for the brain or body).   Let's see what else...ummm...share with each other your favorite music. Get some visuals--strobe lights would be best, but not everyone has one of those. Smoke cigarettes (if you smoke), play with your lighters. Look at yourselves in the mirror with music on and in the dark (or a very very low light--or strobe light).  You also want your clothes to be comfortable for your girl to cuddle you"
MDMA,37yxzy,WetSands,2,Sun May 31 16:14:37 2015 UTC,"What pill was it? Having being separated from your friends and having to look after someone could have had a great impact on your high; MDMA is all about set & setting. I'd recommend you take the same amount but try to remain in company of your friends, stay relaxed and don't expect anything; go with the flow. Take it on an empty stomach. If there's no onset within an hour or so, assuming the pill is tested, it is likely safe to take more."
MDMA,37yxzy,uwotMD,1 point,Sun May 31 16:20:43 2015 UTC,120mg is a crazy small dose for an experienced user. Which you are not. But maybe your tolerance spikes easily. I literally will almost feel nothing with 120mg of DNM top quality shit. I personally need 200mg for a solid roll or 70mg if snorted.
MDMA,37yxzy,deadfap5,1 point,Sun May 31 20:09:26 2015 UTC,"I don't quite understand it myself. I tried taking another 120mg pill and redosing with a 60mg an hour and a half later today and was met with a very underwhelming and disappointing high.  Again, I took it with a few friends. Everyone had the same dosage and everyone bought off the same person. My friends said they were absolutely feeling it after an hour had passed but I was still met with nothing very significant. All my friends are also half my height/weight more or less. I still don't know if body weight and height is a factor."
MDMA,37yxzy,kanad3,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:03:20 2015 UTC,"Body weight is a factor. 1,5-2mg/kg is what people usually recommend. If I were you I would take 180mg, not 120."
MDMA,37yxzy,deadfap5,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:29:07 2015 UTC,"Bodyweight is not a factor in this drug nearly as much as others. I am 185lbs and my girlfriend is 115lbs and we both need the same amount. Other drugs she is extremely sensitive to, even alcohol and weed."
MDMA,37yxzy,deadfap5,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"Take more. Also, if you are buying your stuff off the street you will definitely need to take more as the chances of your shit being uncut is EXTREMELY unlikely, regardless of how reassuring your friends are. Trust me, MDMA is the hardest drug to find pure on the street. I would recommend getting yours from DNM's and taking more in general. On an empty stomach as well, but NOT all-day fasted. Don't eat within 2-3 hours of drop. Also, taking MDMA two days in a row will result in a MUCH more milder roll. So if you barely had anything the first night on a fresh head why would you expect more on the second off the same dose?"
MDMA,37ze83,Razorlike,2,Sun May 31 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"Can i ask why you would take the mdma first? I usually take the shrooms or lsd first, wait an hour 30 - 2 hours and drop the mdma to trip harder"

Generally speaking, I've always done them at the tail end of the roll - just when you'd normally be thinking >""should I do a 2nd pill or not?"" - take the mushrooms instead. It seems to help kick the E back in, and the effects >of the E potentiate the shrooms, and the shrooms help potentiate the effects of the MDMA.  I recall awhile ago, I was going to a club in montreal. I had popped the E while getting ready, then I left for the >club. Waited in line for a bit, get searched - and the security finds the shrooms on my friend.   We then get told ""You'll need to take these now, we cant let you take them into the club"" (They didnt even know WHAT we had). Anyways, we left the line, walked around to the back of the building and ate the mushrooms.   I'd say this was maybe ~45 mins or so after doing the E, it was just starting to come up, but not fully so.   Then, as I said in my above post   One moment, I'd feel just the E Then, I'd feel Both E + Mush Then boom, I'd feel 100% sober THen I'd feel just the mush Then I'd feel both Then I'd feel just the E Then I'd crash and feel sober   I still enjoyed the trip/night all around and had alot of fun, however I felt like it was a bit of a waste of a >hippyflip. Every other time I've done it, I've done the mushrooms some time after the peak of my MDMA - (or, >halfway through it kinda thing), and havnt had any complaints.   I found that if the MDMA doesnt have a full-hold of your system first, its kind of like the mushrooms end up >fighting the MDMA and you get a very up/down expierence, where if the MDMA has kicked in fully first - its a >smoother and more enjoyable ride.  This is just from my personal expierence, and my friends agree also. However, I have seen a poster or two here >saying they like to take them at the same time so they peak at the same time, shrug.  But, having hippyflipped a dozen times or so, I've always found it to work best when waiting for the MDMA to be >fully kicked in, if not the main roll wearing off before doing the mushrooms to be the best way.  ie: drop E at +0:00, do mushrooms ~3 hours.

MDMA,37xy7e,lucoloco,3,Sun May 31 10:44:24 2015 UTC,"I've been using since 99.  You don't meet many people who only tried it once, because it feels that good, and can really lift the veil most people go through life with.  Make sure you are around others who are experienced, do it in the right setting ( I recommend at home first), you'll be fine.  It's not physically addictive, you'll rarely have the blues after the first time, rather you'lll have a few days of afterglow.    Anything can be abused, anything can be bad for you.  Regardless where your friend gets their stuff, spend $20 and get a test kit (sidebar) so YOU can be 100% sure it's good stuff."

I can honestly say my whole mental outlook has changed since the first time. The feeling as you come up for the first time is truly indescribable, as there are so many things going on. To be non-biased, if you're snorting, it's gonna hurt. The taste is disgusting so make sure you have some water or something to hand. My friends and I experienced a small bit of nausea the first time, and I got a couple ""baby pukes"" as I call it. (The ones you just swallow straight away) The comedown varies from person to person, and also depends on the MDMA. I've had some comedowns where I feel depressed for days after, and some that are practically non-existent apart from a little tiredness (which is probably just from dancing/running everywhere). Overall I'd say go for it, as long as you're smart about it there's not much danger. I've had close to a gram in a night (a stupid idea) and still had barely any nasty effects.  TLDR: It's not as dangerous as hyped up to be, as long as you're safe about it."

With that being said, I read and studied as much about MDMA as possible.  Made sure to understand what goes in behind the scenes before ever trying it (About two weeks of just non stop reading).  It's fine if used responsibly, and it's an eye opening experience.  Everything is dangerous in the wrong amounts, MDMA is the same.  Don't be one of those people who drop a full pill, or 200+mg and roll tits all night.  Use it sensibly to aide the night/day that you're using it.    With that being said, I cannot stress the importance of testing your stuff.  Whether it be molly or E, you test it.  No questions.  It is better than accidentally ingesting PMA/PMMA, or methylone or some other crank and hurting yourself.  Find the real McCoy.  Note* I'm still rolling from tonight, so excuse any rambling."
MDMA,37xy7e,CoffeeNSquats,3,Sun May 31 10:57:51 2015 UTC,Whats wrong with taking 200mg lol
MDMA,37xy7e,Le_Tabernacle,0,Sun May 31 18:36:15 2015 UTC,"Is MDMA as dangerous as everyone makes it out to be?    No. All the anti-drug hype is just that hype.  And even while it is accepted MDMA is neurotoxic its not widely understood  how the effects of the neurotoxic damage manifest in daily life.  in fact one report in 2009 by the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs showed while there was    definitely noticeable declines in some areas of cognitive performance, and a slight extra tendency toward depression, the evidence seems to show that moderate Ecstasy users suffer few ill effects in the long run.   So yeah moderate to heavy use may lead to some impared cognitive performance and a greater chance of depression but outside that not much else.  and in fact they recommended MDMA be rescheduled to class B in the UK    to reflect the 'balance of harms' Ecstasy exhibits in relation to other drugs.   So yeah overall its pretty safe and if you follow the accepted harm reduction guidelines you will be fine."
MDMA,37xe61,roledfg,29,Sun May 31 04:54:51 2015 UTC,Sound > opposite sex on mdma  Bitches are cray.  No offence
MDMA,37xe61,Xevro,16,Sun May 31 05:17:58 2015 UTC,Fuck these bitches! I just wanna dance with ma boyz!
MDMA,37xe61,ThePsychonaut420,8,Sun May 31 05:31:36 2015 UTC,It's so acceptable for girls night out...  Why can't I do the same.
MDMA,37xe61,krixo,7,Sun May 31 05:35:48 2015 UTC,Realistically you can pick up girls any time. when you're rolling it is you time.   I love being around girls who are rolling and on my the same level as myself but that's no different with lads either.  But then again i get really bad jaw swings from MDMA so i don't get a great deal of female attention when i'm out on it haha.
MDMA,37xe61,connorm19,5,Sun May 31 09:35:59 2015 UTC,"Yup, I don't consider this a drawback though, I consider it a feature."

MDMA,37xe61,this-is_bullshit,1 point,Sun May 31 07:11:10 2015 UTC,"There was a study not too long ago about MDMA actually decreasing testosterone. But, I think it was due to long term use. What you have experienced is normal. The roll gets so epic that a lot of general thought patterns blow away with the wind. Realistically, That is its appeal."
MDMA,37xe61,xrwsx,1 point,Sun May 31 07:19:21 2015 UTC,"don't force yourself to do something you don't want to do. I think it's great to not be concerned with trying to hook up with someone, especially when you can just have a load of fun dancing and feeling the music! Don't worry, let the experience take you away and have fun! :D"
MDMA,37xe61,RandallWho,1 point,Sun May 31 13:58:30 2015 UTC,Does this happen to anyone else?    Not really.   Music sounds good by itself but sounds better when i cuddled up with some cute raver chick and dancing is awesome by itself but better when i am dancing with a good partner (fyi i dont mean grinding)  but i will add the enhanced tactile sensations and the enhanced energetic connections with people are one of my favorite parts of the drug now..  and actually that last times i have gone out it has really been more about meeting people then the dancing and the music.   how do you overcome it?   Why do you want to overcome it?
MDMA,37xe61,jtet93,1 point,Sun May 31 14:36:12 2015 UTC,I'm a girl but yeah I have the same problem. Guys approach me and ask if I want to dance and I usually just explain that I'm rolling and it's nothing personal but I like to dance by myself. If I think they're cute I might ask them to come out for a cig with me later.
MDMA,37xe61,DabErrlDoYa,1 point,Sun May 31 15:18:04 2015 UTC,"DUUUUUUUUUDE. This made me laugh so hard. We went to EDC last year and experienced this off the White Dominoes. My buddy, who is the biggest horn dog i've ever met and has easily slept with over 100 women, went the 2nd day of EDC and we told him this was going to happen. He didn't believe us. Needless to say he was smacked, dry heaving, and then raging his heart out in the crowd with no thoughts of women in his mind. That being said, it sounds almost creeperish to say, but chicks rolling are really easy to dance with and are usually very inviting."
MDMA,37xe61,Belleinoc,1 point,Sun May 31 17:11:38 2015 UTC,"yeah this happens when I'm at a festival with my husband, unfortunately he wants to cuddle/ grind and I want to dance by myself. It gets awkward"
MDMA,37xe61,bellie24,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:25:29 2015 UTC,"Im a girl and usually when rolling I don't want anything to do with kissing, grinding, etc with the opposite sex. However, this past weekend I was rolling with someone who was also rolling and finally found that connection and sexual nature of mdma that people often talk about, so i think it depends on setting, etc.."
MDMA,37y2lw,the_mdma_newcomer,6,Sun May 31 10:44:45 2015 UTC,"Near death experiences from MDMA? I find that hard to believe   How much are you taking? How are you measuring your dose?  Just because it had an affect on you, doesn't mean it's MDMA, you can't be sure of that, especially without testing..  How would you describe the effects? Increased love and empathy? Increased energy and alertness? Decreased social inhibitions??  If you found it kept you awake and alert, id guess it's a mixture of you not allowing enough time between each roll, and the fact you're eye balling doses terribly and have taken significantly lower doses than what you did first time..."
MDMA,37y2lw,SlipperyWhenWettt,2,Sun May 31 13:54:09 2015 UTC,My experience has been documented here: http://www.reddit.com/r/MDMA/comments/33uhfm/a_delightful_story_of_my_first_times_using_mdma/  The response I've elicited has been so negative that I'll be withdrawing myself from this completely. Hopefully my MDMA experiences in the future will be fun again.
MDMA,37y2lw,CoffeeNSquats,2,Sun May 31 15:57:44 2015 UTC,Have you tested your stuff?  Chances are it's probably something shitty and not legit.
MDMA,37y2lw,bunnydoctor,2,Sun May 31 10:59:48 2015 UTC,I had a truly incredible first experience that matched every description of MDMA.  Eventually got around to testing it.  Methylone.
MDMA,37y2lw,CoffeeNSquats,-10,Sun May 31 15:06:23 2015 UTC,It's from the same exact bag that put me on a journey of life changing self discovery and realization.
MDMA,37y2lw,xrwsx,16,Sun May 31 11:27:48 2015 UTC,"Ok, but did you test it?  It doesn't matter if you thought it gave you those feelings once if it isn't the real deal.    At least then you can be sure there might be issues with you and MDMA, rather than you and X substance that did the thing one time."
MDMA,37y2lw,BobbleheadDoll,5,Sun May 31 11:30:26 2015 UTC,"MDMA is not the only drug that can make you feel that way, test it!"
MDMA,37y2lw,david_chappelle,2,Sun May 31 14:06:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you should definitely test it. If what you had was legitimately MDMA, then one reason you may have not rolled is that you rolled too close together, took too high of a dose, are on a MAOI antidepressant, preloaded on too much 5-HTP. Just get the MDMA test first to rule that out as an explanation."

MDMA,37xtxl,uwotMD,1 point,Sun May 31 09:48:20 2015 UTC,"I doubt it degraded unless it was stored in very unsatisfactory conditions (high temp, humidity etc) - MDMA is a very stable compound, most phenethylamines are."

Usually leave about 2 weeks between events if possible, but some 2/3 day events have come up recently.  Was fine though."
MDMA,37weqv,CoffeeNSquats,2,Sun May 31 01:19:19 2015 UTC,I just dosed 1/3 of a purple bullet.  I'm still rolling and it's been 4 hours.  I suspect these are strong as tits as my friends described them.
MDMA,37weqv,CoffeeNSquats,3,Sun May 31 09:20:30 2015 UTC,"I've been dosing way too much the last 2 years, but it is still somewhat spaced out between rolls. however I wish I had the normal tolerance of being able to drop .15 and re-up .05 caps like most people. 2 x 200mg should put me in a good zone, but I have put back as many as 5 pills in a night before I was to say the least 'smarter' about this stuff. I have had MDMA tested at 85% pure (14.5% HCl or how ever its composed in salt) and was able to go through a half gram or slightly more at a Savant concert."

MDMA,37weqv,ThePsychonaut420,2,Sun May 31 13:58:36 2015 UTC,"Probably average of 1 month between rolls, usually around 200mg, up to 300 if its a festival and I want to redose twice. Usually fairly tired the next day, but besides that comedowns are easy.  I try to keep at least a month between rolls, preferably 2 or 3, but if there are two great events 3 weeks apart I'll roll for both. I'm trying to cut back on how frequently I roll but artists I love keep announcing concerts..."
MDMA,37weqv,200yearsofwar,2,Sun May 31 15:24:33 2015 UTC,"3, maybe 4 times a year!   First roll this year was on March 30, exactly 6 months since last roll.. Messed it up myself by waiting too long with the redose(s)..  Eventually i took about 250-300mg..  Last week during my 'second' roll of the year i took ~200mg 4fa followed by 3 red UPS' (~ 600 mg MDMA ic with 4FA within 6 hours)  No pre/post loading, 5htp etc..  Comedown wasn't that bad, but definitely a red flag now i look back at the amount i took and how easily i was handling it (Few years ago i would probably have continued until we all just run out of stuff)  Same reason i'm sticking with the 3-4 times a year rule. For me it's the only way to keep it magical/fun and 'responsible' considering mental health.  Pre/postloading with tons of pills just so you can take that one 'magic pill' in shorter time spans without ending up suicidal, doesn't feel good for me..at all Not saying it's a bad thing, but ending up taking pills is a must and considered normal in order to have a good roll.  (Dutch here so bad English etc etc, so maybe the message is a tad vague/long; Probably best explained in Dutch)"

Yes but not in a bad way  the parties i go to usually go well in to the next day. the earliest they stop is usually 11a more often they will go to 3p or later.  and to be honest i enjoy rolling during the day more.  i find the people are more sociable during the day, and i really like being able to see how i am talking to or dancing with something i find lacking during the night and every thing still looks as cool if not cooler during the day. colors are just as bright, costumes are just as cool etc etc.  and the music sounds the same so..   Does bright light ruin the roll?   Nope.  The only advice i have is bring some sunglasses as stuff will seem brighter and have a good time.  what festival are you going to?"
MDMA,37vwsi,RandallWho,2,Sat May 30 21:29:22 2015 UTC,It's Free Festival in The Netherlands. Pretty ironic as the festival is not free lol. Thank you alot for your information! :D
MDMA,37vwsi,Lysergine,1 point,Sat May 30 22:12:06 2015 UTC,"Gok dat ik hier wel in het Nederlands verder kan;)  Ik heb zelf vaker overdag M/X gedaan dan op bv een binnenfeestje 's nachts.   Ik vind het zelf misschien nog wel prettiger aangezien je toch minder waanbeelden kunt vormen dan wanneer je ergens wazig in het donker rondzoekt.  Lekker zonnetje erbij, gezelligheid en mooie vrouwen om je heen maakt het zelfs alleen nog maar vetter.  Dit kan alleen wel ook het (grootste) minpunt zijn: hoe gemakkelijk voel je je in die omgeving?   Nu ga ik zelf eigenlijk alleen naar festivals waar drugs meer regel dan uitzondering zijn, en een scheve kop dus perfect bij het meubilair past.   Dus ik hoef mijn gebruik niet te verbergen (vriendin/vrienden doen vrolijk mee etc)  Nou lijkt Free Festival me ook wel 'geschikt'.   Pas als je echt zelf uitzondering bent, of er personen in de buurt zijn waarvan je liever niet hebt dat zij weten wat je allemaal uitspookt kan het overdag vooral slechter uitpakken en is een zonnebril haast verplicht.  Is dit niet het geval, dan is het naar mijn mening alleen maar beter en al helemaal met een mooi weertje erbij!"

Perhaps you can add some faster shipping options?  I really like that you split up the 5HTP dose unlike Rave-Aid so you are taking 5HTP well after your roll.  Also, when it says it includes for example: ""Na-R-ALA, Magnesium Glycinate, Vitamin-C, Grape Seed Extract, Grapefruit Juice, ALCAR, EGCG, CoQ10"", does that mean there is 8 different pills to take, or is it combined into a single capsule?

After about 2 hours of dancing just on alcohol, red bull and water my muscles and feet were starting to ache pretty bad; There was still 4 hours left until the trains started again so I couldn't do much other than buy more red bull, smoke and attempt to keep on dancing and having a good time. With MDMA I can easily go for 4-5 hours of non stop dancing and having the time of my life and feeling no ill affects afterwards.  So I would say I do it because it provides: energy, euphoria, the hallucinogenic effects, a mood uplift and it is cheaper than buying alcohol throughout the night."

If you really want to enjoy yourself do not mix these two unless you have done so before and know the risks associated.   That being said hydrocodone can be plenty of fun by itself (do not mix with alcohol or other depressants especially, unless you love respiratory depression.) in small doses.   Look up the Cold water extraction method for hydrocodone and if you want to take 10-25mg or so you'll have a very relaxed Blast.  Of course since it's an opiate I wouldn't make this a habit as opiate addiction is no joke.    If all you're worried about is grinding you could use a magnesium supplement to help. But that never guarantees you'll have no issues. I say do other drugs.   Tl;dr: You're probably going to be on meds anyway that soon after. Do not mix them.

MDMA,37tsuj,theredhombre,1 point,Sat May 30 09:32:16 2015 UTC,I was super open to it happening but I was anxious for the show. My mind was sidetracked a lot by the weather. But I felt super ready for it to kick in and it never did so I did start overthinking it.   I last took it 1.5 months ago (different pill) and I didn't eat 1-3 hours before hand.
MDMA,37tsuj,baconmma,1 point,Sat May 30 09:46:55 2015 UTC,how long did you wait between taking the first quarter and the rest of the pill?
MDMA,37tsuj,baconmma,1 point,Sat May 30 10:15:33 2015 UTC,45min-1 hour.
MDMA,37tsuj,baconmma,1 point,Sat May 30 11:17:23 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that when you take MDMA your body becomes very resistant to any more MDMA that follows. The quarter you took may have only contained about 50mg which is a sub-standard dose. Then any subsequent MDMA would have had a lot weaker effect than it would if you had taken it all at once. This isn't to say that you should take lots of MDMA at once but at least 100mg would be more effective. This also kind of makes sense because you said you didn't eat before it so the quarter pill might have hit you quickly enough to cause your body to ""block out"" the rest.  In the past I have also taken a small amount of MDMA (maybe 60mg) and I too felt some mild effects but also had heavily dilated pupils. So I guess pupil dilation is something than can occur with low doses."
MDMA,37tsuj,Zunscriii,1 point,Sat May 30 17:09:19 2015 UTC,I was told that the pill was 8 points. So a quarter was 2 points. My friend who has rolled many times took a quarter of it and was good to go all night. So I think the dosage was high enough. Oh well. I guess I was just unlucky.

MDMA,37urf4,chrisnguyen123,1 point,Sat May 30 16:04:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I usually roll starting with 125mg MDMA and then redose with one (or more - yeah, I know it's not good) more of the same amount later in the night.

MDMA,37urf4,hallothar15,1 point,Sat May 30 22:26:39 2015 UTC,Interesting. I have always been told that pills have a fair amount of other stuff in them other than MDMA and certainly the two times I have done pills it has been different from when I've taken MDMA in crystal form.
MDMA,37urf4,hallothar15,1 point,Sat May 30 23:19:38 2015 UTC,i kinda either get tired/energized taking those
MDMA,37urf4,Le_Tabernacle,1 point,Sat May 30 20:01:08 2015 UTC,Well those are two contrasting feelings! Is it dependent on dosage?
MDMA,37urf4,hallothar15,1 point,Sat May 30 20:32:36 2015 UTC,In the grand scheme of things they're very very strong. around 200mg however that amount is becoming more common in pills these days. It's strongly advised for new-ish people to mdma to only take half of these as a whole one might be a bit overwhelming
MDMA,37urf4,Le_Tabernacle,1 point,Sat May 30 22:23:56 2015 UTC,Hmm well now I'm not sure. Done plenty of crystal form MDMA and always end up dosing at least 250mg for a night out. Maybe I'll bosh half a pill and then half a pill later if necessary just to be on the safe side. But I'd be interested to see how it effects me as compared to the crystal stuff. As mentioned the 2 previous occasions I have done pills they definitely had a different feel to them...
MDMA,37urf4,sourpatchkunt,0,Sat May 30 23:21:27 2015 UTC,"Well there's something else...  powder/crystal isn't actually MDMA, it's MDMA.HCl. MDMA freebase (on it's own) is a liquid, MDMA.HCl is made up of 84% MDMA freebase and 16% HCl. So if you've got 250mg of completely pure crystal/powder you've only really got  210mg of MDMA. Pills also contain MDMA.HCl however for some reason the common (Well at least in europe) way of describing their strength is their freebase weight. So if a pill is spoke about to contain 200mg it really means the pill contains 238mg MDMA.HCl so is closer to a quarter of a gram than a 5th of a gram. So that's probably why you feel a difference.  So if you took a 200mg pill you'd need 238mg to feel the same  a guy above posted a .pdf of a labtest (it wouldn't work on my pc for some reason by copying the link but you can get on it pretty easily through the site, it's the ""warning strong pills in march"" .pdf) of a red UPS among others. The Red UPS was lab tested at 276mg MDMA.HCl  Soooo if you usually do 250mg MDMA.HCl in an entire night each of these pills contain 276mg MDMA.HCl so there's more in one of them than you usually have on an entire night out*  long story and i probably bored you but I tried to explain it pretty simply  *well going off this one test result but I'm sure not all the pills contain that amount and some will be under it, the guy above said the lower bound was 180mg so thats 214mg HCl value. so each pill is between 214-276mg"
MDMA,37urf4,uwotMD,0,Sun May 31 00:09:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining, it's relly interesting and helpful.   I usually start off a roll with 125mg.  On a few occasions it's been 150mg. Then I'll redose 125mg-250mg later. Sometimes this is all together and sometimes I'm stupid and try to redose a second time. To me this seems a bit wasteful and I have been trying to cut down 250mg total. The most I have taken at once was 250mg and I did top up later.  I think probably these pills will be manageable for me but it still might be an idea to do at least 2/3 first and then save the last 1/3, simply for safety.

MDMA,37s5dn,DevsiK,-2,Sat May 30 17:18:49 2015 UTC,"You poor little man, doing street drugs. If you ever just had one opportunity to realize what you are talking about you'd instantly take it all back. You are just regurgitating buzzwords you've read in a few reddit posts ""DDOS"" ""Exit scams"". No one is DDOSing, just a bunch of paranoid meth heads in the darknet subreddits. Exit scams never occur from reliable vendors which are the ones you should be going for anyway. Evo had 1 scam, but big fucking deal, I lost nothing from that. Don't keep money in your market wallets like a moron and you won't lose a thing. Move on to the next market.  DNM drugs wipe their asses with street shit. Street quality is absolutely abysmal because by the time it gets to your precious dealer its already been cut into shit PLENTY. Trust me when I tell you your dealer is full of shit, or his dealer is full of shit telling him it's straight from the ""chemist"". I can't tell you how many bro's I hear telling me their friend knows the chemist lmao. Please... Ordering from DNM's ensures 100% crystal, no powder, no pressed bullshit. You cannot CUT into a crystal with other bullshit so you know its real. And the vendors having 4,000 reviews and 99.8% feedback kind of reinforces that. I had a buddy who bought from DNM's and told me it was the best shit there was - it was good, but it was cut with amphs, and turns out it wasn't the best, simply the best DEAL that the cheap bastard went for.. Everyone lies, even your friends. Especially about drugs.   A test kit don't mean shit. Your shit can be only 30% MDMA and it would still turn completely black/purple as black is the dominant shade of color and whatever other cut/filler they put into the mix could just simply have no reaction to the reagent test kit and hence, still, you will get a black/purple reaction and think you have ""fire"" or pure shit, which I can guarantee you if you are getting street shit you DONT. Test kits only test the presence of a drug, not purity. Pure pure MDMA fizzes and bubbles when reacting with a reagent and turns black literally in 2-3 seconds, if it takes longer than 8-10 seconds its cut, and any longer than 20 seconds then its bunk with a little trace of MDMA."
MDMA,37s5dn,deadfap5,2,Sun May 31 17:16:54 2015 UTC,"Lol ok buddy, you sound like a kid who bought mdma once on the darknet and now thinks his sources are the best."

MDMA,37s5dn,B42m0row,2,Sun May 31 04:11:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt say accessible.   lol why not?   sure you can bargain with your dealer, but i really doubt you're getting as well priced deals as on the DNM where the dealers have direct competition in large numbers."
MDMA,37s5dn,amazingsil,1 point,Sun May 31 04:16:35 2015 UTC,"bargain a bit your shit   Exactly, bargaining for shit lol. Bargaining for cut and crap quality drugs. You do realize that DNM's are VASTLY cheaper right? You can get a gram of solid quality MDMA for 30 dollars off DNM's, while you are in a dark alley risking getting robbed, bargaining for methylone and other cut and non-MDMA bullshit for 80-100 a gram lol. And if you buy bullk even cheaper, I got 14 grams (140 pills give or take) for only $280 dollars. Kapow."

I mean... that shit is not molly at that point, why do it?  In college, one of my friend's friends used to get ""great molly"" and we all thought it was great. He took it to a festival and was able to test it... It was ""bathsalts"" / methylone. Pretty shitty.  I do look for pressed pills now since they're more clean than the molly out there...

Then 20 mins later I dropped another half. I started rolling nice and smoothly. In the next 2 hours I took two other halfs and I was bursting with euphoria. I sat on my balcony all alone and focus on the view. My vision was super blurry and confusing so I was very much hallucinating. Started watching cats on the rooftops chasing birds and a billion of stars on the sky. Smoked one joint (didn't do much) and went to bed. This morning I feel good, have appetite again, just a mild pressure on my head which I hope will disappear tomorrow. Enjoy your roll mate and don't take too much. Let me know your experience.

MDMA,37r6ie,ineverwantothrowaway,2,Fri May 29 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"What I've always used and do recommend is 100-120ish mg as the first dose and then 40-60mg as the redose. I've only once redosed more times than that, and at that time I suspect my redoses were a bit smaller (didn't have scales though). I felt pretty worn out after the night of several redoses...  Be wary of the potential for neruotoxicity. As I've understood it, the risk increases over time.  I wonder why mdma would be weaker in the UK? I mean just over the sea in holland you'll find pure stuff rather easily? As long as you have the crystals and have them checked with some kit I'd say the odds of it being pure are pretty high."

Have you not noticed that after the second dose the following makes no beneficial difference? Doing this pretty much ensures neurotoxicity as you are unable to maintain your body's functional temperature, leading to an inability to deal with oxidative stress and thus neurotoxicity.  I personally only redose as my original dose starts to take its effect, this ensures you aren't floored by one single large dose and keeps you going throughout. Supplement with caffeine if needed."

Absolutely correct.   I personally only redose as my original dose starts to take its effect, this ensures you aren't floored by one single large dose and keeps you going throughout.   I think this is the best strategy. As the time goes on, it becomes less and less appropriate to redose.   Supplement with caffeine if needed.   Note, that anything that increases DA, like other amphetamines, could also increase neurotoxic effects because DA potentiations 5-HT neurotixicity.  It would be good to supplement with antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid to help reduce the influence of oxidative stress on 5-HT cells and terminals."
MDMA,37r6ie,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri May 29 21:14:09 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly the increase of MDMA neurotoxicity by caffeine is proposed to be attributed to the potentiation of MDMA-induced hyperthermia. Co-administration of MDMA and caffeine increased DA release but no change in dopaminergic terminal injury was noted, the major difference was the increase in hyperthermic response. Temperature control tends to be key in MDMA neurotoxicity.  That's an excellent point though, supplements are definitely something to consider. I would also recommend grapefruit juice, an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of MDMA to more neurotoxic metabolites. However, this can cause several drug-drug interactions so be weary."

Temperature control tends to be key in MDMA neurotoxicity.   You rock for citing these studies. I read a review chapter that stated that neurotixicity also may increase because of DA activation. I am not allowed to share the link to the book chapter because it is under copyright protection. However, I have quoted the relevant section below:   Multiple doses of MDMA result in decreased 5-HT levels and metabolites in the cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and striatum (Battaglia, et al., 1987). Although MDMA causes the immediate release of DA, long term decline in DA levels is not apparent. Dopamine release, however, likely potentiates the long-term 5-HT-depleting effects of MDMA (Stone, Johnson, Hanson, Gibb 1989; Schmidt, Ritter, Sonsalla, Hanson, Gibb, 1995).  an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of MDMA to more neurotoxic metabolites    Thank you for linking to this image, but unfortunately, I never went past basic high school chemistry. I can only talk about neuroscience research at the concept-level. :( But it is good to know that grapefruit juice might help.  I am going to cite the relevant antioxidant part of the review paper here:   Additionally, blocking hydroxyl radical formation after administration of MDMA ameliorates the damaging effects on 5-HT terminals (Colado and Green, 1995). Formation of free radicals by METH or MDMA can be counteracted by administration of antioxidants and free radical scavengers, leading to decreased damage to DA and 5-HT terminals (Wagner et al., 1985; Gudelsky, 1996). Excess DA release, occurring after administration of METH or MDMA, leads to the formation of free radicals (Cadet and Brannock, 1998). DA-dependent free radical production likely contributes to the damages observed at DA and 5-HT terminals (Cadet, Ali, and Epstein, 1994; Shankaran, Yamamoto, Gudelsky, 1999).    As you can see, excess DA can lead to creation of free radicals, which could be attenuated by antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid (that's what they used in the Wagner et al., 1985 paper)."

I came to Toronto from the UK 10 years ago, and the quality of both pressed pills and MDMA was excellent.  Like yourself I'm 36 now and have two kids, so party times are few and far between.  I have seen a pattern emerging over the last 3 years with regards quality.  The majority of MDMA being sold in Toronto is indeed shitty methylone.  Unfortunately many ""kids today"" believe that this is the real deal.  It actually is rather depressing as an old school raver that the majority of the new generations MDMA experiences will be fake.  Also when you read press reports of ""molly"" is is wrongly described as ""pure MDMA"", ugh, it kinda makes me mad.  I have searched for 2 years now to find some pure MDMA, I'm computer retarded (no darkweb), so go the old school route.

I know for a fact it's MDMA as I got it from MollyMuse on the darkweb and i've tested it just to make 100% sure. It's clean product i'm just nervous about how clean my pee might be haha."
MDMA,37qa3q,BobbleheadDoll,3,Fri May 29 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"Okay, then assume the worst--12-panel. If you know there is only MDMA in there, maybe see what the half life is and also figure out how much MDMA or its metabolites are detectable by the test.  For example, this website said:   Interpretation of Urine Test Results: MDMA, MDA, HMMA, HHMA, HMA and HHA are typically found in urine following their hydrolysis. MDA and HMMA concentrations in urine are typically 10-15% of the corresponding MDMA concentrations.   And it also said half life is about 7 hours.  HEre is an answer on erowid from 2001 stating that average use is about 3 days:   At this point we believe that MDMA is detectable for approximately the same duration as Amphetamine/Methamphetamine (3 days average, up to 5 days with heavy frequent use), but we haven't seen conclusive data on this.   Another website said it is out of your system by 4 days, even with heavy use. Maybe shorter for non-heavy use:   How long does MDMA stay in the body? Detection windows for MDMA, HMMA, and MDA are longer than previously thought. Although MDMA has a short detection period in urine (30-48 hours), detection times do vary according to dose and metabolite. But generally, XTC is out of the system within 4 days of use, even for heavy or conescutive dosing.   Finally, here is an article from 2004 about drug detection times (see the Table). Apparently, with a dose of 100mg taken orally, MDMA will not be detected after 24 hours. BUT, I would also be careful because there might other cuts in there, like amphetamines or methamphetamines, which ARE detectable up to 48 hours afterward for fairly small doses taken: amphetamine (6 mg orally) and methamphetamine (22 mg smoked).  This means that any deviation from these factors, such as changing the route of administration or increasing the dosage, may affect detection times in different ways."

MDMA,37ng27,apvizion,2,Thu May 28 22:42:36 2015 UTC,"Q: What is the best way to reduce neurotoxic effects of MDMA use?  After testing your pills or powder, figure out your dose for the night. Do not redose because frequent dosing can increase neurotoxic effects without necessarily increasing your roll. In addition, you should try to keep your body temperature normal and stay hydrated (sipping water throughout the night). Also, take some antioxidants before, during, and after MDMA use, such as ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). Finally, it might be good to maintain a healthy diet and exercise routine prior to and after rolling, so you should try to reduce your sugar intake."

MDMA,37olod,Darkman101,1 point,Fri May 29 05:51:40 2015 UTC,"Despite the loads of (albeit well warranted) clamoring as to not dose both days, I would personally testify that rolling both days should be OKAY, especially if you have had a long mdma break beforehand and are a non-abuser.   For context, the last time I did MDMA before my 2 day dosing for EDC was 5 months beforehand with .2 mg. I was in your exact situation very recently for EDC NY. What ended up happening was that I took 100 mg on the first day and ""went all out"" with 350 mg for the second day. Both days I managed to roll and have fun and although the comedown was a little rougher than usual, I would say that being in good company and staying hydrated/smart about my health in general made rolling both days not really much worse than any other Molly comedown that I've previously had.   Though I would definitely advise taking a good time off the drug for a while when doing it for more than 1 day in a row. Oh and take some magnesium at least for all the jaw clenching!"

You need to wait around 24 hours between taking that and MDMA (either before or after) and since you took it all in such a close time it's fucked with your head.  Rolling 2 days in a roll isn't recommended either but that probably won't be what's caused your situation.  If it gets worse go to the hospital, you may have serotonin syndrome which can kill..."
MDMA,37mfa4,hallothar15,1 point,Thu May 28 19:10:03 2015 UTC,It can kill? Are there symptoms of it getting worse so that I know?
MDMA,37mfa4,rollsroyce05,3,Thu May 28 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"Let's not jump the gun, the doses of all of these are likely not enough to create a lethal amount of extra serotonin.  Also if you only took 5htp and nothing else (like b6 or green tea extract) a lot of that serotonin from the 5htp likely made it only to your periphery (not the brain)  It is correct though that you took 5htp the wrong way.  You should really only supplement your body with 5htp AFTER youve completely metabolized the MDMA (around 12-24hrs after dropping).  If you take 5htp during or too soon before rolling you create too much serotonin in the body, so much that your receptors get overwhelmed and stop taking it up.  This causes way too much serotonin to just be freely hanging out in the brain/body, which is toxic.    Some symptoms of serotonin syndrome are elevated temperature, confusion, twitching muscles, extreme shivering, goosebumps.  If you are exhibiting these symptoms you should keep yourself in check.  Take fluids, take it easy, try to eat.  Serotonin syndrome becomes life threatening when you start losing consciousness, have a high fever (hyperthermia), irregular heartbeat, or seizures.  Immediate medical attention should be sought out at this point.   I don't think you were at or anywhere near this point, so rest easy.  What likely happened is taking 5htp along with a fairly heavy second dose of mdma was causing your body to negatively react.  You'll re-regulate in a few days, it may even take as much as a week.  Diet and exercise speed this process up."

MDMA,37mfa4,BOGOF_Dominos,2,Thu May 28 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"From my past experience with (potentially) having the first symptoms of Serotonin Syndrome, this seems to fit with what I had. Your first mistake would be taking the 5-HTP too soon. You should wait, at best, 24 hours after the roll before you first take 5-HTP. After taking any 5-HTP you shouldn't consume MDMA again for 24 hours. As /u/BobbleheadDoll mentioned, you should also not really be taking MDMA two days in a row, with the recommended minimum spacing between rolls being 4 weeks and the ideal spacing being at least 3 months. When I had symptoms of Serotonin Syndrome I decided it would be best to go in to hospital because I could not physically function and I was basically stuck in my bed. I was in hospital for a few days before the symptoms went away and most of the time I was on a drip to flush my system. Your best bet now would be to drink lots and lots of water to keep fully hydrated, and to not roll again for a good 3 or so months. This is a link to the post I made a few weeks ago about my situation. There is more info in the comments than in the actual post."
MDMA,37mfa4,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Thu May 28 19:03:58 2015 UTC,"It's really scary stuff. There is some research out there (at least in a 2011 book chapter I read) that reviews research that can help prevent 5-HT neurotoxicity. The factors that lead to neurotoxicity are ""hyperthermia, increased intracellular and extracellular DA concentrations, glutamate induced excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and activation of cell death pathways"" (Pritchard & Hensleigh, 2011, p. 14).  Here is more info from the same paper, mingled with my opinion:  To decrease the risk of neurotoxicity, you should keep your body temperature cool, take antioxidants after MDMA use, such as ascorbic acid. Also, excess 5-HT can increase neurotoxicity, so my conclusion is that it may be best not to take any 5-HT supplements. Also, do not increase MAO (monamine oxidase) with drugs such as MAOIs, because this leads to excess neurotoxicity. There is also evidence that blocking NMDA glutamate receptors weakens 5-HT depletion due to MDMA use. Similarly, so does blocking formation of NO. Finally, doses of MDMA that are neurotoxic activate cell death pathways (trigger cells to essentially kill themselves).  I am not sure which drugs could block NMDA receptors (glutamate) or the formation of NO. However, glutamate excitoxicity contributes to the formation of free radicals, which can be counteracted with antioxidants.  I should also note that a lot of MDMA increases inflammatory responses. Do reduce this type of inflammation, it is best to limit sugar and carbohydrate intake (this is my opinion).  Hope this helps."
MDMA,37mfa4,BOGOF_Dominos,1 point,Thu May 28 19:21:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm honestly not interested in rolling for the while. This experience definitely opened me up to the dangers of rolling.  Did you need to take any medication or did the symptoms fade with time?
MDMA,37mfa4,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Thu May 28 20:22:03 2015 UTC,"They just put me on a drip to flush my system. I took some painkillers because I had a slight headache, and they gave me diazepam to try to reduce my heart rate, however I don't believe I really needed that and it hardly reduced my heart rate anyway. In the UK diazepam seems to be the go to medication for any suspected 'overdoses' from 'stimulants'. The doctors didn't seem to know a whole lot about it though."
MDMA,37mfa4,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri May 29 21:46:52 2015 UTC,"I am been trying to understand where I went wrong and from doing some research it was the micro-dosing, taking more pills the following day and taking the 5-HTP too soon.   This is the issue here. You took pills two days in a row. MDMA is not like other drugs where the more you take the higher you get. It is best to start off with your full dose for the night and then not take anymore. Redosing could get you another peak, but it is not worth it because it increases the chances of 5-HT and DA neurotoxicity.  I do not know how many times you have taken MDMA like this, but if this is your first time rolling like this, just take it easy. I would wait a minimum of 3 months before considering rolling again. If you really want to be safer, wait 6 months.  One potential reason you did not peak and your roll was short-lived on Monday is that you might be rolling too frequently. You might also be supplementing in the wrong way. This is what happened to me many years ago.   Therefore, I strongly suggest that you take it easy from ecstasy for a long while. Distract yourself with other things. In the meantime, read the links on the sidebar about proper ways to reduce the harmful side effects of MDMA abuse."
MDMA,37mfa4,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Thu May 28 18:53:02 2015 UTC,"This was my first time taking MDMA like this. I started just taking a pill for one night enjoying it and waiting a month+ . Normally when I did this, I had no hangover. I am very new to MDMA and as the addiction took place and I wanted the rolls to last longer and to wanted them to be stronger. With all this I poorly read up on options and executed them even poorly. It is definitely a lesson learned. While all these symptoms were minor they feel deadly, the whole experience was awful."
MDMA,37mfa4,BobbleheadDoll,2,Thu May 28 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"Hey, man, do not be hard on yourself. See this as a big lesson that you learned from. I was the same way--I just read about things that could intensify my rolls. But it is important to also read about harm reduction.  So, just keep some of the rules in mind. Do not preload on 5-HTP. Take ascorbic acid (e.g., orange juice diluted with water to reduce sugar intake) before, during, and after MDMA use. Do not redose after your first dose. Do not use any MAOI antidepressants. Do not mix with other amphetamines, like cocaine, caffeine, or meth. Stay hydrated, but do not overdrink water. Keep your body temperature down. And limit a lot of sugars.  EDIT: Also, wait at least one month before rolling again. To be safe, I would wait even longer, like 3 months."

MDMA,37nh1e,uwotMD,3,Sat May 30 20:00:50 2015 UTC,Compare your pill to Pillreports or EcstasyData database. This will give you a pretty good indication but you should always test the compound you're about to ingest.  What did your dealer say this red substance was meant to do?
MDMA,37nh1e,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Thu May 28 23:15:10 2015 UTC,"First things first, you should test your pill. The size of the pills says nothing about the amount of MDMA or other contaminants in your pill. The only way you can know for sure is if you test it.  Will your girlfriend be taking MDMA with you? If so, you guys can definitely have a good time together. :)  I do no know what a molly sucker is.   Any tips or things to be aware of to prepare?   If I were you, I would take some ascorbic acid supplements or drink orange juice before, during, and after your roll. Also, do not redose throughout the night, because this increases neurotoxic effects of MDMA.   If you are looking for fun stuff to do, check out the FAQ thread that was just created. I posted some stuff in there."
MDMA,37nh1e,suche1,1 point,Thu May 28 22:55:05 2015 UTC,Instead of drinking OJ before dropping I'd suggest taking antacids first. OJ is acidic which means less MDMA absorbed which means less fun-times
MDMA,37nh1e,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri May 29 11:21:03 2015 UTC,"I was going based off of research suggesting that ascorbic acid (plentiful in OJ) helps protect neurons from the neurotoxic effects of MDMA. Do antacids also have ascorbic acid in them? I think any antioxidant will do, though, beside ascorbic acid."
MDMA,37nh1e,suche1,1 point,Fri May 29 14:57:01 2015 UTC,"No you're right but amphetamines are absorbed poorly when your stomach is acidic (drinking OJ will do this) so basically you'll ""lose"" some of the MDMA if you drink orange juice or anything acidic before dropping. Antacids neutralise your stomach acids so less MDMA goes to waste and more is absorbed.   Some people claim taking antacids also helps on the come up, that it prevents them from feeling nauseous or throwing up which is a plus in my books, too :)"
MDMA,37nh1e,BobbleheadDoll,1 point,Fri May 29 16:13:23 2015 UTC,"amphetamines are absorbed poorly when your stomach is acidic (drinking OJ will do this)   Didn't know that. Maybe it would just be better to take like a Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) supplement along with some antacids. It's definitely better to protect your brain cells with antioxidants.   Some people claim taking antacids also helps on the come up, that it prevents them from feeling nauseous or throwing up which is a plus in my books, too :)   Good to know!"
MDMA,37nh1e,suche1,1 point,Fri May 29 16:18:46 2015 UTC,I took the pill last night after taking the orange juice advice. Absolutely nothing happened...waited an hour...then another hour. Didn't feel anything in the slightest. I don't know if the pill was a scam or if it was weak and the orange juice negated it.
MDMA,37nh1e,ibd95,1 point,Fri May 29 23:40:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that :( It's impossible to say why you didn't feel anything but don't give up! My first two times were really not good either but third time was the charm, blew my mind away. Have some antacids ready for your next time and an open mind even though this time it didn't work. :)"
MDMA,37nh1e,B42m0row,1 point,Sat May 30 02:20:48 2015 UTC,"Never heard of a Molly Sucker but I'm going to assume it's a piece of candy with bits of MDMA inside, probably to disguise the foul taste."
MDMA,37l3yi,throwawayformq,5,Thu May 28 12:34:29 2015 UTC,"So GFJ contains a CYP3A4 inhibitor, which as you said above, inhibits the metabolism to MDA. AFAIK only a small amount (somewhere between 7% and 11%) of MDMA is metabolised in this way, so you probably don't really need to reduce your dosage at all. If you want to be really precise you could probably reduce it by around 10% to compensate but it's not going to make a huge difference."
MDMA,37l3yi,AlpacaHeaven,1 point,Thu May 28 19:22:20 2015 UTC,Yep - this is correct. It's all about CYP3A4.
MDMA,37l3yi,disposable_UK,2,Fri May 29 00:27:38 2015 UTC,"From experience, it makes for a better roll, a smoother comedown and a ride on a nice and fluffy cloud the day after."
MDMA,37l3yi,SharK3D,-3,Thu May 28 19:18:25 2015 UTC,Okay I'm guessing here but although grapefruit juice might taste acidic it reduces stomach acidity.  I know that absorption of amphetamines can be increased by ingesting baking soda before.  But I don't know how much you have to adjust your dosage.
MDMA,37ndo3,murrayland,6,Thu May 28 22:24:24 2015 UTC,"There's so many misconceptions surrounding ""pure"" MDMA that get thrown around as facts a lot on the internet so I'll try and clear up a few things you said to the best of my knowledge.   it was mind blowing but definitely not pure - gritting teeth a lot, sweating, woke up with achey jaw.   Sweating and gurning are just the effects of MDMA, but the higher you dose the worse these will be. Some people are more susceptible to it than others and there seems to be a lot of unknown factors which cause this. In my own experience I will gurn and sweat from 100mg of MDMA, at 200mg I will be sweating a lot and the gurning will get worse (so I supplement magnesium to reduce this).   I wanna try pure but I've read in forums it's really chilled.   I think this depends more on your set and setting. If you dose too highly it can be very easy to get floored, even in a club or at a festival. Keep your dose sensible and you can avoid that.   What would people recommend?    It's kind of difficult to gauge purity without sending it to a lab or just taking it and seeing what the effects are. If you are expecting ""pure"" mdma to give you all the positive effects with none of the negative (sweating, gurning, etc) then I think you're going to be disappointed. It's more important to be sure you are actually getting MDMA, so get a test kit, etc. Also supplement with magnesium to reduce the jaw clenching."
MDMA,37ndo3,Soapy9,1 point,Thu May 28 22:53:41 2015 UTC,"Not heard the magnesium thing before, thanks. And good advice about taking too much. It might be I get half and half. You have no problem on pure dancing and staying up then?"
MDMA,37ndo3,Soapy9,1 point,Thu May 28 22:58:18 2015 UTC,"Buy chelated magnesium (google places near you that sell it or buy it online) and pre-load with it for a few days. I've only had success by doing it this way, but most places will tell you you only need to take it on the day you are taking MDMA. It completely stops my jaw from clenching for most of the night! When I feel myself starting again, I just have some chewing gum and that helps it.  Nope no problems, I take 130mg then an hour and a half later take another 70mg and that usually lasts me about 5 hours until I'd want to just chill out and have a joint."

MDMA,37ndo3,uwotMD,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"dude stop thinking about it this way. find some molly, test it with a test kit, but you cant control the purity of it. and if you want to know that purity ration send a sample to lab. Even what you buy on the DNM you can't be sure of its purity until you lab test it. stop it with the purity thing. just find some good molly, test it, dose correctly and supplement youll have a clean nice roll and you'll think ""oh shit that felt like pure mdma"" but its mainly because of the circumstances around it"
MDMA,37ndo3,hallothar15,1 point,Fri May 29 13:52:09 2015 UTC,"I've had lab grade MDMA and street grade, the only difference ime is clarity - the body high on the pure compound was more enjoyable and my thoughts felt more clear. Both compounds passed reagent and lab tests, the former was simply a more pure sample; maybe the impurities in the latter account for discrepancies or it could have just been a psychosomatic effect.  Assuming you have MDMA the biggest factor seems to be set & setting, if this is your favourite weekend of the year you're going to have an amazing time regardless."
MDMA,37ndo3,uwotMD,1 point,Thu May 28 22:45:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I do think it's about mindset. Just on this first mdma I had I had a habit of 'zoning out' a lot and getting in my own headspace. Whilst this stuff where I think it was cut with other stimulants I was just more on it. I know even with pure I'll have a great time and maybe not care if I'm dancing or not but I don't wanna miss late night sets or just end to crashing in a field chilling
MDMA,37ndo3,disposable_UK,1 point,Thu May 28 22:54:10 2015 UTC,"MDMA doesn't make you sleepy, you might feel like chilled and stuff but you'll almost certainly want to be in a dance tent/stage instead of crashing in a field"

I supplement throughout festivals/club nights with caffeine if I feel I need it. I would also recommend menthol cigarettes, the combination of a nicotine buzz and the refreshment from the menthol helps my friends and I - also provides a nice opportunity to socialise.  I've tried both at festivals and clubs, never partook in a home roll - I'm not one for being alone whilst on such a sociable substance."

MDMA,37l36o,Jelly_Warthog,1 point,Thu May 28 15:26:22 2015 UTC,"Ideally you want magnesium citrate, as the citric acid works as a chelating agent and increases the absorption rate. Magnesium oxide has a really low absorption rate. Pick some up from Holland & Barrett or Boots.  There's 2 disadvantages, however, that you should know. Firstly, magnesium citrate is more expensive than magnesium oxide... it's about £6 for a pack of 100 (so go halves with mates cause you don't need that many). Secondly - and more importantly - it's a bloody good laxative so don't take too much of it unless you wanna spend the night on the shitter with diarrhoea."
MDMA,37l36o,disposable_UK,1 point,Fri May 29 00:23:33 2015 UTC,"Holland and Barratt magnesium bisglycinate.  They stock it in every store.  Aka chelated magnesium. Just ask someone working in there. They neither know nor care why you want it, they just like to make a sale and get you to join the loyalty scheme.   Other magnesium supps don't quite cut it compared to this one, at least in my experience.  HTH"

I take MDMA for the purpose of being able to enjoy conversations with ANYONE. I could talk to my worst enemy on MDMA and have a great chat, and probably make them my friend in the process.  Although some things are frequently asked in this sub, I don't see why you have to hate people for asking questions about MDMA on the MDMA sub. FFS at least they're doing their research. It's kind of ironic how a sub devoted to a drug which is supposed to intensify feelings of love and euphoria is filled with people full of malice and judgement."

MDMA,37k6iw,The_bamboo,3,Thu May 28 05:48:27 2015 UTC,"Doing research on Tesla's, just a few questions   Here   So like, how much is a dose for someone who has MDMA experience but hasn't rolled in over a year?   IIRC Teslas are 200+mg and some where between 220-250mg. So it really depends on how much you want to roll.  If it was me i would do one pill and then do half a pill as booster but you would be going pretty hard so keep that in mind. if  you want a more mellow roll take one pill and split it.   How different is it from MDMA?   its not.   What are the precautions I should take, and are there things I should supplement?   i dont know, i honestly do pay attention and am not the person to ask"

MDMA,37k6iw,fratagascar,2,Thu May 28 15:35:42 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're talking about the Tesla presses. Take half first, redose with the other half/fourth if you need it within 30-90 min after the initial.  Personally, the orange Tesla came on pretty quickly and smacked me within 30 minutes. You'll feel the sense of euphoria, ease of breathing, and rhythm of the music. You'll have a lot of energy and will want to dance unless you're floored.   It is MDMA (assuming it is) in pill form.  I don't use supplements, but eat healthy and keep hydrated. Get your sleep and working out helps. Have fun!"

MDMA,37kirc,throwawayroller,1 point,Thu May 28 12:01:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I always get super anxious coming up. I can barely handle it if i'm in a club or at a festival due to the amount of people around me. If i'm in a calm environment at home with friends then the anxiety is bearable.   You just got to ride the wave and know that the feeling will pass and will be greeted with an immensely pleasurable experience. Normally after the initial come up I get little to no anxiety for the rest of the night depending on the environment I am in. This is coming from someone with an anxiety disorder.
MDMA,37kirc,drumandbuds,1 point,Thu May 28 12:15:29 2015 UTC,"I've found a strange way to calm down. Again, no empirical evidence but it worked for me and opened up my breathing capacity a bit and increased blood flow. Raise your arms up and if you can grab one or two peppercorn and chew on them. Thats it.  I got the idea for the arms up from the idea if you get a deep enough cut on your finger, I was always told to raise it above your head to prevent bloodflow.   Not a doctor. just noticed it worked when i tried it."
MDMA,37kirc,PWEI,1 point,Thu May 28 19:40:23 2015 UTC,"Last time I rolled I'd been really anxious for a few weeks, and the roll wasn't great because of that. For about 2 hours after I dropped, I felt like it was too much for me (even though I took a small dose) and thought I was about to have an anxiety attack. For the rest of the roll, I still felt anxious, but in control."
MDMA,37kirc,aoestnhuaou,1 point,Thu May 28 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"Same experience here. Rolled 3 times before that particular night. It was a big indoor party and didn't even took a big dose, just hit too hard I guess. 1,5 hour in and I started panicking out of nowhere and was experiencing a lot of stress. Just went to the side and sit on bench for most of the evening  Weeks after I was very anxious and experienced 2 panick attacks. It's been 3 months now and I am fine, but weed seems to trigger the anxiousness again. I don't think it'll be worth it to roll again in future."
MDMA,37kirc,BadassMcmuffin,1 point,Fri May 29 22:49:08 2015 UTC,When I tried it the come up was pretty rough but once fully kicked in it was like a wave washed over me and it was completely gone with no trace of my normal extreme anxiety. 10-15 minutes of reminding myself to breath and then a couple hours of feeling amazing.

MDMA,37gqbv,steezyneezy,2,Wed May 27 18:21:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. Unfortunately, this study is limited because there was no control group. Also, no statistics were reported that could help gauge the size of the effect. Also, no numbers were reported (e.g., averages and standard deviations). That would be cool, though, if meditation really helped with this kind of thing, but I think interventions (e.g., meditation) + drugs (e.g., antioxidants?, piracetam?) might be the best combination, which is usually the case in treating people for clinical mental disorders. Just a guess, though.   Thanks for your input!"

MDMA,37gqbv,diplomatmarkmorgan,2,Wed May 27 22:17:14 2015 UTC,It happened to me. I apparently burned out some serotonin and dopamine axons associated with mdma. I probably won't touch it again. I have other ways to feel the way I did when I rolled which include a strong relationship with psychedelic substances like LSD and psilocybin. Exercising really helped too. I would just try to find something you're really passionate about and expand on that.
MDMA,37gqbv,phyyr,1 point,Wed May 27 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have rediscovered my passion for opiates. I don't plan on doing MDMA again. But I still am suffering MDMA's deleterious effects from my abuse. I am hoping some knowledgeable are aware of some good research and can recommend some other things to help."
MDMA,37gqbv,PixelDemon,1 point,Wed May 27 20:00:17 2015 UTC,I don't think that 's what he meant about finding something you are really passionate about.  Opiates feel great but there's no happy ending there.  You might want to consider ditching your current life and go hike around the world or something completely different.  You need a serious change of pace.
MDMA,37gqbv,DabsSparkPeace,3,Wed May 27 22:03:55 2015 UTC,"Opiates feel great but there's no happy ending there.   That's true, too.   You might want to consider ditching your current life and go hike around the world or something completely different. You need a serious change of pace.   I actually have many things I desire from life now. I have a wife who loves me, and I love her. I have a promising career (graduate student now). And I love what I do.  Unfortunately, I am a former drug addict. So every now and then, I go back to drugs for a brief amount of time. Once my drug use has a notable effect on my relationships or my career, I stop using the drugs for a while. And then I come back a year or so later. It's a dangerous game.  EDIT: When I say former drug addict, I should say current drug addict who follows the pattern of behavior I described in the previous paragraph."

I have heard about that before, but I am not sure how it compares to placebo or whether it has a significant impact on cognitive functioning over and above other interventions (e.g., meditation).  Thanks again for the suggestion!"
MDMA,37kvwd,lyleandscott,2,Thu May 28 11:10:14 2015 UTC,"DO NOT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE BELOW SAYING TO ""bomb half"" or just ""weigh it"" you need to TEST IT!  I have a story for you that's going to bum you out, but please read the whole thing and trust me. I don't want to be the bearer of bad news or burst your bubble at all but chances are HIGHLY likely that this is a synthetic cathinone (probably methylone).    The reason I say this is because currently around my area (I'm in San Diego County, CA) I have seen TONS and I mean TONS of this exact same shit going around as ""moon rocks"" or ""brown sugar"" - it is always in big chunks like this, has a slight bitter taste and little to no smell.  Hard to tell from the pic but that looks like a pretty fat/dense rock and mdma in crystalline form generally looks nothing like this unless you literally know the chemist producing it.  All pure MDMA or brown/tan ""molly"" I've seen has been in more of a clumpy powder form, it's extremely sticky and sticks to itself/clumps up into little balls and absolutely REEKS of safrole (black liquorice/root beer type smell) - it's never just one big, fat, solid dense rock  If that was real mdma it would have cost you a LOT of money - looks to be at minimum a half g there and eating that amount of real mdma would have your eyes stuck in the back of your head, jaw going crazy to the point that you chew holes through your tongue and such an intense rush it would be too overwhelming and you probably wouldnt even remember the roll (especially if you're a first timer).  I have myself purchased that exact stuff you have pictured, thinking it was mdma and had multiple people telling me it was mdma only to eat close to a half g or more and only feel slight tingles/coming up feeling that quickly plateaued out and faded away after 2 hours.  I literally thought I had ""lost the magic"" and mdma wasnt working for me anymore for almost a year until I smartened up, bought a test kit and found out that every single cap or bag of ""molly"" being sold around here is in fact a cathinone (marquis test results turn highlighter yellow with no indication of purple or black at all - and I've tested this brown sugar moonrock type stuff multiple times, all bunk).  Since it sounds like you are new to the game let me break it down for you like this - avoid ""molly"" ""moonrocks"" ""brown sugar"" or anything of that sort like the plague, people are importing these cathinones in from China for literally $100 USD for a POUND and then breaking it down into rocks/caps and selling it as ""molly"" to naive kids who have no idea what mdma is and want to try it after hearing one of Drakes songs about it (not saying this is you, just trying to explain how the market is currently working) - only the people who were in the scene before 2010 or are extremely informed have a clue that the word ""molly"" literally stands for methylone/bath salts right now, it hasn't stood for mdma since the end of 2011.  So I'm not trying to be a dick or say ""you're an idiot"", just be warned that I have seen the EXACT stuff you have pictured there and purchased it/eaten it multiple times myself and no way on planet earth is it real mdma.  You might still have fun if you eat some since you are new to the game but the risk of death isnt really worth it, plus the effects you feel will be NOTHING even remotely close to how real mdma feels.    Sorry man, if you are in my area (Socal) then you def just got ripped, I'd sell that bag to someone or save it for a boring night, in the meantime be on the lookout for PRESSED PILLS not molly, there are tons of amazing euro imports and domestic pressed pills going around right now that are loaded with real mdma, stay safe and get a test kit IMMEDIATELY http://bunkpolice.com/basic-test-kit/   Hope you heed my advice man, I've been rolling since 2007 and have seen the shift from pills, to pokeballs, to fake pills, to molly, to fake molly and now back to pressed pills.  Stay safe out there and even more importantly stay SMART!  ~ Know your source, know your dealer, know your chemical, know your body & know your limitations ~ Peace, pot & microdot ~ [J-DUB] ~"

MDMA,37kvwd,eatmdmadroplsd,2,Fri May 29 18:54:48 2015 UTC,Looks like definitely enough but you really need to get a scale to make sure it isn't in fact too much. There is no benefit to taking loads of MDMA at a time. I say this because here in the UK I see people rolling on ridiculous amounts and they're not even having a better time - they are just harming themselves more. Get the dose right and you can save money and your brain!
