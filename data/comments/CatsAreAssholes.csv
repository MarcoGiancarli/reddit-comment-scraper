They see this as a fair and just exchange, and are baffled by our seeming indifference to this mutually beneficial relationship.  Seriously, cats are naturally most comfortable at about 85 degrees F, whereas humans are naturally most comfortable at about 75 degrees F.  This is why cats like to be in the sun.  They like to be on humans.  The temperature we keep our homes at, is just too cold for them to really be comfortable with.  This is also why little old ladies get along so well with cats.  Old people tend to get cold more easily, so they welcome a friendly cat in their lap."

CatsAreAssholes,3697x7,autowikibot,4,Sun May 17 12:42:33 2015 UTC,"Grey goo:       Grey goo (also spelled gray goo) is a hypothetical end-of-the-world scenario involving molecular nanotechnology in which out-of-control self-replicating robots consume all matter on Earth while building more of themselves,   a scenario that has been called ecophagy (""eating the environment"").  The original idea assumed machines were designed to have this capability, while popularizations have assumed that machines might somehow gain this capability by accident.  Self-replicating machines of the macroscopic variety were originally described by mathematician John von Neumann, and are sometimes referred to as von Neumann machines.  The term gray goo was coined by nanotechnology pioneer Eric Drexler in his 1986 book Engines of Creation.  In 2004 he stated, ""I wish I had never used the term 'gray goo'.""  Engines of Creation mentions ""gray goo"" in two paragraphs and a note, while the popularized idea of gray goo was first publicized in a mass-circulation magazine, Omni, in November 1986.

However, alcohol use is very common in the wild. And I loved getting into my dad's ""hidden"" beer when I was a kid. Now that I'm an adult, my only drinking problem is getting enough of it."

CatsAreAssholes,34ylnm,Astrixtc,4,Wed May 6 14:04:41 2015 UTC,I'm not criticizing you for it. I think that anything that is made from fermented yeast or fruit is pretty natural for animals to crave. There's a good reason us slightly less hairy apes like to get fucked up. Can't blame a kitty for wanting the same thing. Give him/her a little nip to go with it and I'm sure that would be one blissed out kitty.

The cat that my pup likes and is friends with? He's got no trouble walking past, chasing, kissing, and everything else.  The other cats however aren't fans of the puppy and a good hiss will send him scurrying. He's been smacked in the muzzle a few times and doesn't want a repeat experience. Combined with the fact that the cats get to do things that he doesn't - unlimited furniture/bed access, a room to themselves, etc - I'm pretty sure he's sees them as being higher in the pack."

CatsAreAssholes,32s4ac,WhyAmINotStudying,2,Thu Apr 16 10:22:28 2015 UTC,"All laying is sitting   Well, etymologically, I was thinking that I might agree with you, as the root of sit is the same root as ""sedentary,"" but on the other hand, if you were laying down on a sled you wouldn't be sedentary.  That also makes me wonder about sitting on a bicycle or even in a car. In the case of a car, you're sedentary to the car, but you might be traveling 70 mph with relation to the Earth. On a bicycle, you're likely not sedentary unless you're stopped, in which case, you're likely not sitting, but leaning on one foot.  This takes me back to my early quantum mechanics studies with inertial reference frames. Of course, in this case the gamma function is effectively 1, so temporal relativity doesn't come into play, but still... A man sitting in the passenger seat of a car that is traveling 70 mph down a freeway is sedentary. A man sitting on the hood of the  same car is most assuredly not."

She was fussy the first couple nights and in all it took about a month of this to get her on my schedule. But now, 4 years later, she comes to bed with me and wakes up with me,  and now she sleeps with me in the bed.  She's now all about her schedule. Once our alarm goes off, she wakes us up... so we have to set it later on the weekends.  :)  But your cat is horny... I don't have any answer other than to have her fixed.

Just as you get up to chase him off/stop him, he would whack the cup off the table and race away at full speed.   edit: he has since passed on, but not before teaching our other two younger cats to do the same. he continues to torment us from the grave. cheeky bastard.   edit: I can't spell."

It looks like the pup and your cat will get along eventually. They're within a few inches of each other and no one is freaking out. Puppy is absolutely adorable!

Also, they don't meow like other cats. They tend to ""brr"" instead, and it's fun once you get used to it.  One of our two Russian Blues was half wild when we brought him home, so he was a bit weird about being pet and bit a lot. Over time he became the most lovable (but lazy) cat, and biting is just one of the things that we've accepted as part of his personality.

Seems like he may have been weaned way too early (before he came to you), possibly due to losing his mother, or else you would've had trouble feeding him. In case you ever find yourself in this kind of situation again, do some research on how to bottle-feed kittens, and how/when to wean them. The weaning process usually starts at around a month (maybe a bit later)."

CatsAreAssholes,2lqoo9,frubbliness,9,Sun Nov 9 05:45:03 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry to break it to you, but it appears your cat is a felinist SJW who is attempting to prevent you from playing your species-ist games. The only way to appease her is to start playing more games with feline representation. Until then, she will do everything in her power to stop you from playing your games, such as crying for attention when you're at your computer, and complaining to her followers on tumblpurr."

CatsAreAssholes,2koldz,NeverNix,3,Wed Oct 29 15:32:54 2014 UTC,My cat would do this crap when he was a kitten.  I woke up a couple mornings to this before I learned to keep the bathroom door closed.
