flightsim,3e39uu,TheGingerPhantom,3,Tue Jul 21 16:59:08 2015 UTC,"Firstly, welcome to Flight Sim! Virtual Airlines are websites that exist independently of flight simulator. If you find one you like, you go to their website, sign up, and can begin flying flights for them according to their rules. Some virtual airlines allow you to fly whatever you want whenever you want, other require you to follow a set schedule, etc... It varies greatly from airline to airline. However, you don't need to be a member of a virtual airline to use a Flight Simulator. Simulators themselves aren't really games because they don't have objectives, points, etc. I'd explain it further but your post is a bit vague. What flight sim do you have, and what do you want to do with it?"
flightsim,3e39uu,N415XJ,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:34 2015 UTC,"No, you don't. It's something some people do for a more realistic experience.

They will use an ACARS or tracking software that will in essence record your flight and capture it on their website or forum.  I enjoy VA's because it gives structure and meaning, provides a great way to learn the ACT language and puts some realism into the whole experience.  Find one that is a bit casual and doesn't have strict rules to start, then try to find the medium and demands of a VA that suits you."
flightsim,3e39uu,Sketchy_Uncle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:45:25 2015 UTC,"Hello,  This sub encompasses the usage of multiple flight simulation entertainment/educational products, including Microsoft's Flight Simulator X (FSX), Lockheed Martin's Prepar3D (P3D), Laminar Research's X-Plane, Eagle Dynamics' Digital Combat Simulator (DCS), and more.  All of these products are arguably ""edutainment"" (educational entertainment) software packages that allow users to simulate flying a variety of aircraft in peacetime and/or wartime environments. You may see that some here are touchy about using the word ""game"" though in all but a very specialized version of P3D and X-Plane, that's what they are, while also simulating flight. (Yes most programs featured here are simulation games).  Most of the basic software packages that any of of us are using have a base cost of roughly USD$50, give or take 20 depending on the specific software. That cost covers the basic, bare bones program, though the vast majority of what you'll see featured in this sub is the result of the accumulation of hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of hardware and software add-ons for the base applications mentioned above.  You'll also quickly realize that while you can use most of the simulator choices in any way you please, many here strive for utmost realism, which oftentimes can involve in depth flight planning and aircraft system studying, before even getting into the program. With that being said, some here enjoy the long trans-oceanic airliner flights, while others are content flying around in a light aircraft at a local grass airfield.  The participation in a virtual airline (VA) is purely optional, and over the years I have sensed a downturn in structured VA participation in favor of flying how one wants, where one wants. Of course, if you desire structure, then maybe a VA is for you.  Flight Simulators (particularly the civilian ones like FSX, P3D, and X-Plane) are open worlds which allow you to fly anywhere in a wide variety of aircraft, so feel free to explore and ask further questions."

Since the aircraft is limited to a Boeing 737, the flights are also fairly short. For example it takes me about 2 hours, including preflight planning, to do a hop from KDEN to KPHX.

flightsim,3e158t,TheGooose,2,Tue Jul 21 03:54:10 2015 UTC,"Theory: The flight model is overpowering your CPU. When you do not touch the stick you are not placing any new burden on the flight calculations, but when you move it all of a sudden its working its butt off. Some planes just utterly shaft core 0. You could try loading up MSI afterburner or performance monitor for each core (not just the overall CPU performance) and monitoring core 0, assuming this is indeed where P3D has decided to put the flight model on your system; it usually does. It can sometimes be difficult to tell if its totally totally maxed because P3D always pretty much maxes core 0 anyway, but look for little respites in the sea of green if you are using performance monitor, or some occasional dips if using MSI. If there is no black / dips at all then the core is overloaded. See if moving the stick makes you go from ""just about maxed"" to ""maxed""."
flightsim,3e158t,Wirel1ne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:11:55 2015 UTC,So what can I do to fix the problem?
flightsim,3e158t,Wirel1ne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:33:11 2015 UTC,"If it is to do with CPU loading, and not some other cause, you could try reducing any other load on that core. I don't know the exact core assignments, but usually autogen seems to impact it in some way. AI can have an impact too. Experiment with turning things down or off to see if it helps. The other option is upgrade the CPU. I would say overclock but you said i7 2600 which doesn't appear to be a 'K' chip, that means you cannot overclock it."
flightsim,3e158t,Wirel1ne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:14:08 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll watch the CPU usage when I use it today."
flightsim,3e158t,misrepresentedentity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:18:04 2015 UTC,"Cool cool. Its usually core 0 you need to watch, you will probably see your other cores are more lightly loaded. I think the 2600 is a 4 core chip with hyperthreading, so you will see a total of 8 cores in performance monitor. P3D is quite good at making use of multicore so you will see activity on most of them, but you are looking for the one that is an almost solid block of green. Hope thats the answer, if not I am not sure what else it could be!"

flightsim,3dx9oj,ceno666,3,Mon Jul 20 12:32:02 2015 UTC,What he said. I've got 25 hours in a real 172 and the A2A plane is pretty damn close.
flightsim,3dx9oj,jacenborne,4,Tue Jul 21 02:39:58 2015 UTC,"Stop! if you have FSX, you have the Stock C172. that's all you need. Listen to me now and hear me later. Save all your money for the IRL flying lessons. don't give any FS addon a thought. the default 172 will work for any practice you want to use the sim for. trust me when i say you are going to need every penny.   other have mentioned Orbx global and vector. while i will agree that they do enhance the pilotage portion of navigating. they are still not required. stock data includes most major roads and rivers. as well as airports terrain features ECT. you can still learn pilotage enough to (when combined with some IRL practice and ground school) not pass. i would not use the sim for learning pilotage. simply because the sim is best suited for Instrument and emergency training.   Last tip from me (i have a PPL with ASL and was a avid flight simmer before them) your going to have to un-learn quite abit of things. be ready for that. and go with what the FAA books, or the CPC ground school tells you. not what you learned form your sim, or a FS forum."
flightsim,3dx9oj,Desparoto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:18:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, during my private pilot certificate (it's not actually a license) training, I used the stock C172 to practice cross-countries and IFR procedures. I would invest perhaps UTX or Vectors to get the towns, rivers, and road layouts corrected so that you can practice pilotage."
flightsim,3dx9oj,AviatorMoser,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:31:25 2015 UTC,"I think that has validity for the navigation portion of things, but the stock 172 has a great many shortcomings in the actual flight characteristics area. Though some say that the A2A C172 is actually slightly harder to fly than the real thing, and its ""left turning"" trait is a little off, I still think it will give a much better idea of what to expect in terms of handling. Plus its just such a beautiful thing to own."
flightsim,3dx9oj,Wirel1ne,4,Mon Jul 20 15:47:39 2015 UTC,"Well, my experience has taught me that most that simulation aircraft are harder to fly than the real thing because you lack so many sensory inputs.  Flight simulation has limited benefit for training toward your private pilot certificate. For instance, it's terrible to practice S-turns, steep turns, and pattern work, because a large part of those maneuvers rely on a feel for the aircraft, a feel that is impossible to simulate on a desktop computer. In fact, you'll likely learn bad habits trying to practice these maneuvers in a simulator like I did.  The real benefits for VFR training is navigation. You can accurately plan a cross-country flight using real world information. You can take out a sectional, use a plotter to plot your route, find landmarks, calculate distance, ground speed, and fuel-burn accurately. All that I found out I could ultimately do in the default Cessna 172 quite well (with some biases in the numbers). You can also practice communication with the ATC.  The biggest benefit lies after you receive your private pilot certificate and move onto instrument training. Here sensory inputs don't matter all that much, and in fact you are taught to ignore them and trust the instruments. FSX was a huge help, as I could simulate zero visibility and just shoot approaches for hours.  I guess the A2A will be a better representation of the aircraft's systems, but honestly a good book, such as the Aircraft Systems for Pilots by Dale De Remer would be a better investment for that."
flightsim,3dx9oj,AviatorMoser,3,Mon Jul 20 16:09:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed, that is the major frustration of sim aircraft. Even when things like adverse yaw are well modeled, the need to always look at a ball is a bit annoying when I know I could feel this with my butt if I needed to (I have a few lessons in a C172 but not as many as I would like).  I definitely take your point on the navigation and I have heard a great many PPL qualified pilots say the same about simulation being more useful for the instruments stuff, its definitely something to take into account. That all said, I still think that the answer to the OP's question is the A2A, even if you have given some great food for thought."

flightsim,3duoew,Forkboy2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:58:20 2015 UTC,Only question I have is what is VAS usage compared to 737 and 777.
flightsim,3duoew,SmCTwelve,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:21:54 2015 UTC,PMDG usually does a good job managing VAS for such complex airplanes...it's sad that it's 2015 and we still have to worry about this though
flightsim,3duoew,Forkboy2,4,Mon Jul 20 05:48:11 2015 UTC,"Good job on it's own perhaps, but not good enough once you add in ORBX, detailed airport sceneries, etc.  There is a huge market for a complex aircraft that somehow gets around VAS issues.   I would like to see low VAS options....for example, remove the interior passenger cabin, low polygon version of aircraft model, low res texture option, etc.  Developers need to pay more attention to this kind of thing.  Go ahead and build your super detailed version for promotional screenshots, but let us adjust the level of detail to our liking."
flightsim,3duoew,GMenez,2,Mon Jul 20 05:56:26 2015 UTC,"Whilst those options would be nice to have as standard, it's not really each individual developers job to limit VAS usage. They want to focus as much detail on their product. It would take more time and they'd probably charge more because of it.   The sim wasn't designed to handle numerous complex addons. P3D going 64-bit would be a very interesting change for future development though."
flightsim,3duoew,Torsteine,2,Mon Jul 20 17:45:54 2015 UTC,"Since VAS usage is becoming a key issue for many of us, I disagree.  For example, if the PMDG 747 uses so much VAS that it doesn't work with other popular addons, then their sales will certainly suffer because of it and it's ""their job"" to sell units. I certainly will not be purchasing it until I hear real world reports of VAS usage.  In many cases, the extremely high level of detail addon developers are including these days serve no purpose other than to make pretty screenshots for marketing purposes. In most cases, it's not that difficult to take a detailed texture or model and reduce the level of detail."

UTX for is a good addition and replacement for Vector and gives you nice autogen.  And then there is the new released GEX for Prepar3d, rather expensive and in my eyes, at least in Europe, a mess.

flightsim,3dujpk,mewanttrackir,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:02:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry, not the developer, just a costumer ;)  And you can attach the clip to the headset with zipties, nothing fancy needed."

flightsim,3dujpk,Sketchy_Uncle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:08:57 2015 UTC,"First, to answer directly: Yes, any array of LEDs that a webcam can pick out from the background will work with FreeTrack or FaceTrackNoIR/PointTracker or OpenTrack/PointTracker.  I originally wrote this for r/starcitizen, but it is very relevant to here; a full guide to getting a DIY head tracking system set up. Just ignore the bits specific to Star Citizen and you'll be fine.  https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/2gpr7r/completeish_facetracknoir_diy_trackir_guide/"
flightsim,3dujpk,ThatOtherGuy435,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:56:49 2015 UTC,"As someone with the TrackIR 5 and Clip Pro, what I need, is to figure out how to get two TrackIR cameras to work together, each one 6 feet and 45 degrees off the left and right shoulder of the pilot. This should increase the range one can look, but so far, there's no support for this."
flightsim,3dujpk,Meateous,3,Mon Jul 20 12:26:01 2015 UTC,"So you basically want to be able to look over your shoulder and still have it head track?  Interesting. Tricky...but interesting.  Edit: Not possible.    The problem is that the TrackIR cameras are not syncable, and as such will have issues interfereing with eachother. In order for multiple burst IR emitters to work together, their bursts must be synchronized. OptiTrack supports this, however TrackIR does not   OptiTrak stuff is expensive commercial mocap stuff, though."
flightsim,3dujpk,packtloss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:39:32 2015 UTC,"That shouldn't matter, as the IR bursts should just be for the hat clip reflectors. Still, the software would need to be designed to specifically fuse the two cameras' data together, which isn't exactly a simple thing for what I doubt many people would use."
flightsim,3dujpk,trashaccountname,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:44:10 2015 UTC,"I recently bought a clip and camera from www.trackhat.org and it works lovely. Hardware all works fine, software (I'm using OpenTrack) was a bit finicky to get working nicely in my lighting conditions (I've got a window behind me, throwing IR right at my camera :/) but it all works great!  I'd recommend using it rather than TrackIR5 or whatever iteration they're on now if you've got a small budget (like I do). I couldn't really justify to myself spending nearly £100 on TIR5 whereas I only spend £33 (£30 on the product, £3 on shipping) on TrackHat."

flightsim,3dupkn,Chrispy01,3,Sun Jul 19 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"Addons featured in this album    PMDG 737 NGX Active Sky Next - Weather Engine FlyTampa Dubai   I'm not really a screenshot type of guy, but having seen the amount of screenshot albums from guys with P3D, I thought I might share what my FSX is now looking like.  I recently took the time to sort my FSX out after a break using DCS World for some time, and just to help a few people out I thought I would mention what I did to get the results above, both graphically and performance wise.   First of all, in terms of the fsx.cfg file,which is key to your performance in the sim, I followed Kosta's incredible software/hardware guide from top to bottom - this is your key to getting the most out of your PC for incredible FSX Performance. Since then, I have had no problems whatsoever, no Graphical Glitches or Artifacts. You can find this guide here   Secondly, to get some better anti-aliasing within FSX your gonna need NVIDIA Inspector, (which requires a NVIDIA GPU) which forces the AA settings up as the sim has much, much older, less effective AA techniques.  I used the following settings found here, specifically the settings from the second screenshot. Ignore the tweaking guide, Kosta goes into much more detail on his guide. This produces some fantastic results.  Be warned - some drivers from NVIDIA prevents you from changing the settings on NVIDIA Inspector - I am using the Geforce Hotfix Driver 353.38 as the current drivers have caused HUGE errors such as BSODs on my system, not good.   Your probably what clouds and sky shit I'm using. Is it REX, you ask? No, it is not REX, the sky and cloud textures I am using are completely free - I use Pablo Diaz' HDE v2 - some fantastic textures completely for free.   Again, you ask, how are you getting this semi-glorious sun effect in FSX, what is this madness? Well, I'm using the Simple Sun Mod to produce this effect.  Matt Davies even made a video explaining how you can install the two above mods (I only use the stated mods), so use this guide to help you install them if you so wish.   Finally, to stop that REALLY FUCKING ANNOYING UI CRASH THAT FSX LOVES TO FORCE UPON US, I found a simple fix deep inside the VATSIM Forumns. First of all, create a BLANK, yes, BLANK notepad file, then rename it to UIAutomationCore.dll and paste it into the Root FSX directory. This fixed this issue, for me.  Using all the above tweaks, I now have FSX running at a steady 30FPS with very few issues. I strongly reccomend you follow these steps if you need help tweaking your sim!  Be warned - FSX is pretty CPU heavy - so you may need a good, overclocked CPU for your PC to manage this. My System Specs are   i5-2500k @4.7GHz ASUS GTX 660 OC (I know, not amazing, thinking about a GTX 970, opinions?) 16GB of RAM   I must also add I'm running FSX on it's own dedicated 60GB SSD, which is vital if you want much quicker loading times.   Hope this is helpful to some of you, I'll read all the comments and hopefully reply to most of them. Just be aware, I'm not an expert, just sharing my knowledge of what works, and what doesn't.  Thanks :P, and it's good to be back in FSX!  Edit 1 - Formatting"

flightsim,3dt5ws,coffecup1978,2,Sun Jul 19 05:19:13 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that if you are considering getting a PS3 cam for IR tracking, you want to convert it to an IR cam by removing the IR filer and installing a visual light filter.  The visual filter can be a cutout of an old floppy disk placed between the CCD and the lense, however, there are two different versions of the lense. You would want the one that has a curved lense on the outside, as it is releative easy to remvove the IR filter, the other one is more tricky.  This can be a bit fiddly, but take your time, and there are plenty of instructions on YT/Web. Btw, Don't forget you need a driver as well (3 euros or something). And the IR clip to your head.. My setup cost $40, use Opentrack, and it's really great!"

flightsim,3dt5ws,sbabbi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:05:41 2015 UTC,"I originally used FTNoIR with just facetracking in FSX Box'ed edition, which worked reasonably well, but wasn't stable enough for me to operate the dials in the 3D cockpit.   When I upgraded to FSX:SE, FTNoIR stopped working, and I switched it Opentrack w/facetracker. While it looked more advanced, I never got it reliable enough. That's when I investigated the IR tracker, and now it is so stable I can operate the knobs in 3D view.   Only thing I miss from FTNoIR, is that it lets you send reset command from ingame (to center/start/stop tracker/view), but I'm finding the setup so stable I only need to do in once per session anyway.

As far as the cost, if I can build something for 30 bucks in about an hour, and that saves me $200, i'll do that.

flightsim,3dqux4,TheRealWireline,3,Sat Jul 18 16:03:27 2015 UTC,"Updrafts and downdrafts are very common and perfectly normal especially during the summer. Being on final, lined up perfectly on the VASI, and staying that way without making adjustments only happens on very smooth days. I'd say 100-500 fpm is typical, but 1,000 fpm is really strong and is something I would want to avoid (you can tell I'm not a glider pilot). That being said, that's still way weaker than a microburst, which produces downdrafts up to 6,000 feet per minute.  Getting a 1000 fpm updraft followed by a 1000 fpm downdraft on final in a small plane is pretty severe and not realistic for typical days. 500fpm is normal and not scary."
flightsim,3dqux4,xdarq,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:32:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply, I really appreciate you taking the time :) Yeah I had a suspicion that those numbers were a little excessive, but its good to hear that thermals on approach can and do happen. I think I may have to see if I can dig around in one of the config files to prevent those 1000FPM rollercoasters! What is the correct IRL way to deal with them, in cruise and approach?"
flightsim,3dqux4,xdarq,3,Sat Jul 18 17:40:36 2015 UTC,"On approach, correct airspeed changes with pitch and adjust power as necessary to maintain the desired descent rate. Less power for updrafts, more power for downdrafts.   In cruise it's okay to just ride it out, especially in VFR. The thing about thermals is that if you hit an updraft, there's almost always going to be a downdraft coming right after it, and vice-versa. So if you start climbing excessively and just ride it, the coming downdraft will take you back down to where you wanna be. I'm not sure if this is true in P3D but it's true in real life.  What I have noticed is that A2A planes are REALLY sensitive to thermals (especially the 172) and it's totally unrealistic and annoying. If you use Active Sky Next there's an option under settings that allows you to adjust the maximum climb and descent rate for thermals."
flightsim,3dqux4,xdarq,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:54:33 2015 UTC,"Yup it was A2A's it was happening in. Just all of a sudden the VSI needle just goes nuts and you hear whooshing.  So on approach you handle it just the same as any speed / altitude change? Cool, thats good to know. I guess as runways are concrete, it must be possible to get bad floaters due to thermals running off the runway surface too. Wonder if anyone has ever been unable to put it down because of that. Anyway, cool beans, thanks again for the info!"
flightsim,3dqux4,xdarq,2,Sat Jul 18 18:18:49 2015 UTC,"Not really, floating on the runway happens due to what's called ""ground effect"". Basically even small planes like Cessnas have wingtip vortices that come down, circle around to the top, and hit the plane on top of the wing, spoiling the lift. When you get close to the ground, the vortices hit the ground before they get the chance to come around and hit the plane again, which gives you extra lift and causes you to float over the runway."
flightsim,3dqux4,AviatorMoser,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:26:21 2015 UTC,"Indeed, that I am aware of - however I wondered if it had ever been the case that a thermal on a runway had actually prevented a landing, from any altitude?

flightsim,3dqux4,wilbur1340again,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:27:55 2015 UTC,"I was in a DA-40 once on takeoff, an aircraft with very light wing loading like a glider. About 300' AGL, a thermal hit me just underneath the left wing, and the damn thing nearly tipped me over sideways. A bit nerve wrecking.   You won't notice thermals below 100'. Often, they have not picked up enough speed. Also, thermals can be quite large as well with diameters greater than 500 m. When flying near airport, you might very well be flying in an airmass that will eventually rise as  thermal."

flightsim,3dozkk,Flymia,15,Sat Jul 18 02:23:40 2015 UTC,"737s components are easy to obtain due to the 737NG having many of the same buttons, panels etc.. to even the oldest 737-200 and certainly the 737-300 through 500 which many have been retired.   Also flight sim components companies have been making 737 components for a while now. Along with PMDG making a highly sophisticated 737 early on in FS9.   Finally, the 737 is just a popular plane for simmers. It is a plane that often flys 30min routes but is also a plane that can fly 6 hour routes and even in BBJ form long haul across oceans. It can be flown into small airports under 5,000ft runways too.   If someone is going to make a home sim that is likely the only plane they will fly in simulator. Might as well fly something that can do and does do a little bit of everything in the real world.   That being said, an A320 sim would be great too because well with the right software an A320 can be a A3-18,19,20,21 and 30. That is a bit of everything."

flightsim,3dpni0,Easy301,2,Sat Jul 18 05:59:50 2015 UTC,Aerosoft's managed descent logic is just incredibly poor.
flightsim,3dpni0,occasionalpirate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:04:54 2015 UTC,"This is my technique:  I do most of my flying in the US where most medium to large size airports have numerous STARS that make descent planning a breeze.  When I am in the cruise and not far from TOD, I am reviewing the STAR waypoint crossings and speeds to make sure what I see on the chart matches what's in the FMGS.  The FMGS is only as good as the data you put into it.    From there I dial up the first crossing waypoint altitude and it's a simple left click of the alt switch I usually do to start a managed descent a few miles before TOD and the Airbus starts a -1000ft/min descent until it captures the descent profile.  I continue to twist the alt knob to the lower altitude crossing waypoints before I hit them so that way the Airbus can continue to do its thing in managed descent.  Most of the time once you hit the last waypoint on the STAR, it vectors you nicely to either the downwind portion of the ILS or localizer capture. If I'm put on a downwind, I'll usually control the speed and set it to 210, descend to the glideslope intercept altitude on the chart, and drop a notch of flaps.  I'll then slow to 180 when turning base and to capture the localizer.  Once I'm starting to capture the localizer, I'll click the app button which puts me nicely on the glidepath and I'll put the autopilot into managed speed to slow me to my vapp while I drop the gear and rest of the flaps so I'm fully configured by the FAF.   It's perfectly fine for the engines to go idle during the initial descent portion and use the speedbrake as needed, but don't mess with the speedbrake too much.  I'd highly recommend you read Mike Ray's Airbus A320 ebook to learn more about operating the bus."
flightsim,3dpni0,CUREAZGEORGE,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:38:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for all the wonderful info.  I do all my flying in the US as well using real world routes including the SID and STARS, although with that said, here's my technique that's not letting managed decent hit restrictions and I'm curious as to why.  The FMGS is properly programmed for an adequate descent, all altitude and speed restrictions for my star correctly correspond to the information being displayed on the FMGS.  Initial restriction alt for the descent (or lower) is in the MCP.  At roughly 2 miles away for TOD I'll go ahead and click the ALT knob,  putting the aircraft in a managed decent. During this time I'll verify on the PFD that the aircraft has received my command to go into managed descent as well as confirm once again that the FMGS shows all speed/alt restrictions and is currently trying to meet those.  As the aircraft enters manged descent it adjusts pitch and speed accordingly as starts descending without issue, the problem arises when the aircraft is not descending fast enough to hit those alt restrictions. It get especially bad below 10k and the aircraft does not want to bust it's speed restriction.  I know of ways I can easily fix this by adjusting MCP values myself, but how do I correct this without doing that and keeping the bus in managed descent the whole time?  It almost seems like it calculates TOD too late in the flight plan. I might try activating descent a bit earlier next time.  Thank again you for all the help and advice!"
flightsim,3dpni0,migster90,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:00:15 2015 UTC,"Ahh... I see. Your Airbus is on ""Open Descent"" mode (right click), and the aircraft is using the appropriate descent rate to keep it's speed. This is independent from the MCDU, and in order to force the aircraft to descend faster, you must set a higher speed. To answer your question, you need to left click the altitude selector knob in order for the aircraft to follow the MCDU programmed altitudes. Hope this helps."

flightsim,3dp0ch,TheRealWireline,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:57:45 2015 UTC,"I like the Captain Sim L-1011 Tri-Star. The autopilot is a bit more advanced but its still all VOR / DME / ADF. It has a CIVA INS too which is pretty cool to use, manual input of waypoint co-ordinates and the need to calibrate at beacons as you go. An FMC it really is not :) Also has the good old flight engineers station with a high degree of modeled systems. The instrument panel and throttles are gorgeous, and the whole flight deck feels sumptuous especially when you get the lighting on. There is a nice matte sheen to the battleship grey panels and the fully 3D gauges look and feel very real. They have gone for a slightly worn look. I would have preferred ""fresh out the wrapper"" look but thats personal preference.  Cons: Though the actual front dash and pedestals / overhead are beautifully modeled with nice textures, some other bits like the seats don't look quite as nice. It also lacks the CS ""modeled cabin"" feature. You will also need to search for documentation for the L-1011 yourself as the included stuff is very thin. Performance in P3D is not great though may be better in FSX. Finally I have not heard great things about their support, but haven't needed to use it yet.

flightsim,3dn65y,TheRealWireline,6,Fri Jul 17 19:14:04 2015 UTC,"No, P3D is quite an extensive reworking of FSX and offloads a great deal of scenery processing to the GPU, as well as adding in a lot of extra graphical effects like HDR, shadowing, volumetric fog and so on. It still needs a very good CPU, especially once you start adding things like scenery packs and more advanced aircraft.  I tend to think of sims as being like level editors in popular video games. You can make a simple level with a few huts and some enemies and the performance will be great - that is like default P3D or FSX with default aircraft. But once you start adding in more and more buildings and AI units, eventually any hardware will start to slow down. This is like adding in more scenery and complex airliners etc in P3D. Theoretically there is no hardware combination that can max out any combination in sim because there is always more you can add.  AFAIK there are no addons that improve performance for P3D, though there was an addon called fiber something or other that was meant to help with FSX."

I don't think you could even call DCS an ""analogue"" of ATF.  DCS is a switch for switch study-sim of various airframes, not a bang-for-the-buck ""sim"" that really simplifies the airframes.  It doesn't make any sense to compare the two.    If you're just looking to fly lots of cool jets and don't care about testing them in combat, FSX and a ton of mediocre-to-decent freeware planes and a handful of payware-pretty-well-modeled planes will whet your appetite.   If you're looking for combat, DCS is really the only current developer. They still offer FC3, which is a slightly ""dumbed down"" version of the full-on switch-for-switch sims and has 5 or 6 different airplanes in one package. BMS is out there and worth checking out, but still focuses on one particular airframe in exhaustive detail.  Based on your post, I'm not sure that's what you're looking for."

I love DCS, but until Leatherneck comes out with a Tomcat, Strike Fighters North Atlantic is my fix for some Swept-wing sexyness. The publishers are pretty cool too, and there are massive amounts of user-created aircraft like FSX.   The CombatAce Forums probably has the largest collection of user-content.

flightsim,3dllvw,RampageZGaming,5,Fri Jul 17 07:01:20 2015 UTC,"Pilot here.  The first step is to figure out your fuel burn, measured in gallons per hour. You can figure this out by looking at the performance tables in the A2A C182 pilot's manual. Divide your maximum fuel capacity by your gallons burned per hour, and you'll end up with how many hours of fuel you have on board.  The next step is to figure out how long it will take you to get to your destination, factoring in your route of flight and winds aloft. You can find out your true airspeed on the same performance chart you got your fuel burn from, and you use the available winds aloft data to figure out what your groundspeed will be for each leg. The old school way to do this is with an E6B flight computer.  So for example if your aircraft has 3 hours of fuel on board, and your trip is expected to take 2 hours, you're golden! In the United States, you're required to have at least 30 minutes of reserve fuel for VFR flight. I would personally take an hour reserve since you're flying over water.  I know this is just a simplified short summary, but if you're still having trouble I can break it down step by step for you."
flightsim,3dllvw,xdarq,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:22:43 2015 UTC,"Alright, so according to the pilot's manual, the C182 can go a speed of 145 ktas at 7000ft 80% throttle, and can travel for 5.4 hours under those same conditions. 145 ktas converted to mph is ~166mph. 166mph * 4.4 hours is 730.4 miles. The longest stretch in the trip is from Kingston to Limón, which according to Google Maps is 693.33 miles.  So I should be golden! Of course it would take a bit longer due to the time it takes to rise to 7000ft and descend back to sea level, and also the time it takes to line up the runway, but the extra hour of fuel should be more than enough to allocate for that. Thanks for the help!"
flightsim,3dllvw,corsa180,5,Fri Jul 17 08:14:00 2015 UTC,"Don't forget to allow for winds aloft, as xdarq mentioned. If you get a strong headwind, it will take you a lot longer to reach your destination; on the other hand, if you get a strong tailwind, you'll get there quicker. So they are a critical part of your fuel planning (and also influence your decision on what altitudes you plan to fly at, etc.)"
flightsim,3dllvw,TheRealWireline,2,Fri Jul 17 13:40:27 2015 UTC,"I think its great to learn the 'proper' method that xdarq is talking about, I will look into that myself too! However I think if you use the simbrief site it will generate your flight plan and, if you tell it you are in a 182, give you correct fuelling as well. Not sure as havent tried that combination myself, but it always seems to do OK with other aircraft."
flightsim,3dllvw,Phyinx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:50:10 2015 UTC,"I'm no IRL pilot, but I've got a lot of hours in FSX (about 25 hrs in the A2A 182 so far) so I figure I'll chip in my 2 cents.  They way I tend to work out my fuel consumption is to fly short practice flights before flying a major flight. If you push Shift+2, it'll display your estimated range under the current conditions.  If I was going to be flying long-distance, I'd take the 182 up to my planned cruise altitude and speed, then monitor the estimated range and fuel burn. From there I just kinda guesstimate how much I'll need because I'm lazy. If I were to do it properly, though, I'd work out how long the planned flight would take at cruise alt&speed, add an hour then use the gallons per hour used from the practice flight to load up the right amount of fuel. The extra hour of fuel is just to give you a safety margin, should you run into bad weather or simply don't end up flying as economically as you'd have liked.  With fuel planning, just remember that you won't use a lot of fuel for the decent. You can extend your range by cruising high then effectively gliding down in a semi-shallow dive with a little power.  If you're crossing a largish body of water, personally I'd land at the nearest airport to the coast, fill up the tanks with enough fuel to cover the water 1.5x then fly to the nearest airport on the other coast. This is mainly because I really don't want to run out of fuel over the ocean but also in-case you have a fuel leak or coolant leak; you won't have anywhere safe to ditch. If the coolant is leaking (not sure if this is simulated, but it probably is), you can richen the mixture to provide extra cooling with the fuel.  Well, sorry 'bout the wall o' text, but I figure if I'm gonna help, might as well do it properly. Good luck, and feel free to ask questions!"
flightsim,3dllvw,V1VrV2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:18:53 2015 UTC,"(RW Pilot here as well)  Flying General Aviation planes like the 182, the winds aloft are going to play a huge role in your fuel planning. Not here to critique your route but if I were flying this RW, those lengthy overwater legs would make me find another way to get there. I tend to leave as much fuel margin as possible when I fly (the 1 hour for VFR mentioned by /u/xdarq is my personal minimum; more if IFR). Hypothetically, say you were stretching your route and all of a sudden a storm popped up and you needed to deviate around it, you'd like to have plenty of fuel. Or maybe the winds aloft ended up stronger than predicted (and since there's not many reporting stations across that part of the Caribbean, that’s a real possibility). Or, if your destination airport was suddenly closed due to weather and you couldn't land there. Anyhow, you get my point - Best to have plenty of gas to consider your options and make it to another landing spot. Obviously these scenarios won't happen in FS and you asked about fuel planning not help with the route… But, it’s something to consider if you’re wanting to simulate something that’d be close to a RW route. I might suggest something like KMIA-KEYW (get fuel). KEYW-MWCR = 317nm (get fuel). (MWCR-MNPC) = 334nm. And then continue by following the coast down to MRLM. This would keep your options open and limit the overwater legs to around 2 hours.   But – about that fuel planning:   In the sim, I seem to recall flying the A2A 182T in the 8,000-12,500 ft MSL range lean of peak (LOP) at around and 11-14 gph with “24 squared”. That is, 2400 rpm, 24” mp. This results in around 140 knots – again, rough numbers. With 87 gallons usable, divided by 14 GPH = 6 hours of endurance, minus my 1 hour personal limit = 5 hours at 140 knots, which equals a maximum of 700 nm range.  To get more precise, I’d do what you did – Go and find a 182T POH like this one.pdf) and look up the performance numbers (starting on page 181). :) Next, pick an altitude you’re likely to fly at – we’ll go with 4,000 MSL since the two overwater legs are basically westbound. That puts us referencing the table on page 184 for the cruise numbers and doing some math for the climb and descent. Note that these numbers in the POH are for a max takeoff weight scenario and unless you’re taking at that, you’ll do better than book values so right away that builds in a little bit of margin.   So, first consider the taxi/takeoff: the POH says add 1.7 gallons for this… easy enough to do.  Climb/Descent: You’ll be going from sea level-ish to 4,000 MSL. At max takeoff weight, the 182T will climb at 90 knots and around 600 fpm average (POH page 179). The POH also states that this will take 6 minutes and use 1.6 gallons over 10 NM, without winds. You could also figure the descent at this point in time, too: -4000 feet at, say, -500 FPM, will take us 8 minutes and cover 20 nm and burn maybe about 2 gallons, again, no winds.  Now you can figure the enroute portion. From KEYW to MWCR is 317 NM. On the POH page 184, cruise performance at 4,000 MSL shows 143KTAS at 13.6 GPH (round it up to 14 GPH for a little more margin). The big unknown at this point is what your groundspeed would be which is where you’d need the winds aloft data. But, for a no-wind situation, let’s just go with what the POH says, 143 knots.  (317 nm – 8nm miles for climb - 20nm for descent) / 143 groundspeed in knots = 2:01 enroute 2 hours times our fuel burn of 14GPH = 28 gallons for the enroute portion.   So, totaled up, I have 1.7 taxi fuel + 1.6 climb fuel + 28 cruise fuel + 2 descent fuel = 33.3 gallons used with no wind and no reserve or contingency fuel so be sure to add those in. YMMV, literally.  In any event, I’d be much more comfortable with full tanks and plenty of time to sort things out if a “situation” developed.

flightsim,3dm8g7,Gr82bagator,3,Fri Jul 17 12:18:17 2015 UTC,Interesting. First time I've heard that one. I would have thought as long as your machine had enough grunt there would be no need to spread stuff. What are you currently installing on other machines?
flightsim,3dm8g7,coffecup1978,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:11:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the OP needs to add context. Accessing data over the network will be far, far slower than accessing it locally."
flightsim,3dm8g7,beef-o-lipso,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:54:48 2015 UTC,"Let me rephrase....By installing FSX on a computer by itself, addons such as any flight navigation software, weather services, etc, will allow more processing power dedicated to FSX. Your other programs can suck up RAM from another networked machine. I run Aivlasoft EFB, OPUS FSI and ACARS on a networked computer. Less RAM used for these programs frees up RAM for FSX."
flightsim,3dm8g7,trashaccountname,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"This might have been true back when you'd have maybe 2 CPU cores on your main PC, but I really doubt it still holds up today.

flightsim,3dkmzx,Forums_Terrorist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:48:22 2015 UTC,That's a lot of analogue. Really gotta hand it to the pilots that flew those older aircraft. It takes a lot of concentration and attention to detail to be able to not screw up.
flightsim,3dkmzx,DetCord12B,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:37:55 2015 UTC,"I read a story somewhere where a Concorde pilot claimed that Concorde was regularly allowed to go to 300 knots below 10KFT, but I couldn't re-locate that link when I wrote my article, so it's in the ""unconfirmed rumor"" status. Would be great if someone familiar with ATC operations could confirm/deny how likely that would be. That said, control of your aircraft's airspeed (and altitude and heading) is critical, so practice away. Concorde (Concorde X, at least) is quite stable at 250 knots, so there's no control issues at this airspeed."
flightsim,3dkmzx,Forums_Terrorist,3,Fri Jul 17 18:11:00 2015 UTC,"Waiving the speed limit isn't uncommon; it's usually done for heavier widebodies like the 747 and MD-11 when they're at MTOW since the margin of safety is too low below 250. My trouble is that my x52 is too goddamned limp so if I let up for even a second the nose'll drop and whoops I just gained 20 knots.  Edit: I read up on it and apparently in a lot of the world ATC can cancel speed restrictions globally, but in the US they can only cancel the 200 kt limit for certain classes of airspace and any SID/STAR restrictions; US ATC can never cancel the 250 kt below 10k rule without the administrator's permission."

flightsim,3dkmzx,MeneMeneTekelUpharsi,2,Fri Jul 17 08:53:09 2015 UTC,"This came out 2010ish. You can buy it right now for about 50 bucks, but it only runs on FSX."
flightsim,3dkmzx,TheFlyingTiger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:15:03 2015 UTC,"It's currently about 50 Euro at the Flight Sim Labs store, I'd actually recommend sitting it out until they update it for FSX Steam or P3D. While it's certainly flyable in old skool FSX, there are little instabilities/bugs here and there that can make for an occasionally  frustrating experience. I just couldn't wait, so bought it, and am not totally miserable, but it is a big complication."
flightsim,3dm41b,Ragerin,5,Fri Jul 17 11:23:12 2015 UTC,"P3D is essentially the same as FSX, just improved upon what FSX is. Same source code, and was left for dead by Microsoft until Lockheed Martin picked up the license to develop it further under a academic/professional use.   P3D supports shared cockpit as well as FSX, rather its the aircraft that decides if shared cockpit will work or not. There are only a few aircraft out there that support shared cockpit (Aerosoft Airbus for one that I know of), and soon to be Majestic Software's Q400 in the ""Pro"" Version of their release. Currently their Pilot version is out, but it doesn't support shared cockpit.  http://majesticsoftware.com/mjc8q400/products.html   Take a look at the link above, and see the differences. I highly recommend the Q400, its on the same level of detail as PMDG is known for, and is one of the best regional turboprops in flight sim. Easy to use, and fly. You can always pick up the Pilot version of it, and when the Pro version comes out, all you do is pay the price difference between the Pro version and the Pilot version from what ever website you bought the pilot one from, and its yours. Which is great news.    I'm pretty sure both flight sims are equal in terms of developing custom work on. I would only hope Lockheed improved P3Ds ability to do so. ' FSUIPC supports P3D. P3D isn't some toy you play with when no one is looking, thinking people will make fun of you for using it. P3D is the new FSX, and its a day/night difference in performance you get. Almost, if not every major FSX add-on developer has produced their products for P3D as well.  PMDG 737 is the best 737 out there who are seeking realistic simulation, and the high detail that comes with it. Its a popular aircraft because of that, and its a major airliner that tons of airlines use. Like I mentioned before, the Q400 by Majestic Software is the best turboprop you could buy that has that type of detail. Recommendations: PMDG, Aerosoft airbus, Q400, A2A simulation aircraft (smaller piston aircraft like Cessna)    I'd recommend youtubing reviews of add-ons that you are interested in. Its honestly the only way you will ever make that solid choice of wanting it. For Weather and texture add-ons, the best to get are: ORBX, Active Sky Next, FSdreamteam Airports (there are a couple of other companies that produce same level too, though Fsdreamteam has a great collection of major airports)"
flightsim,3dm41b,fishbait32,2,Fri Jul 17 15:51:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for your elaborate answer. :-) Settles the matter pretty much for us. I think we'll swap to P3D when we're building the cockpit."

flightsim,3dlipy,akhbhaat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:56:28 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are letting the plane control the climb rate? If you are flying a SID with alt requirements, that could cause these high rates. You can always right click to take control of the autopilot element."
flightsim,3dlipy,dmacrye,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:28:46 2015 UTC,You are correct as I the plane is controlling the climb rate. Do you know how the plane controls it. For example other then a SID how does the plane pick the climb rate?
flightsim,3dlipy,Kortiah,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:42:25 2015 UTC,"It controls it when you don't put VS (vertical speed) constraints on the MCP. Otherwise it'll follow the SID with the regular constraints :   maximum altitude you've given him min/max altitude constraints of the SID.   If you set something like a low maximum altitude at first on the MCP, and raised it at or above a SID constraint, but later on, it'd mean your plane would have to climb at a high rate to reach that constraint within the time it's allotted (if you need to go from 5,000ft to 9,000ft and you're only 1 min off the constraint, then the plane will climb at 4,000fpm if it's allowed to go at or above 9,000ft)."
flightsim,3dlipy,TheRealWireline,3,Fri Jul 17 09:32:04 2015 UTC,"I believe Cost Index you input also affects how much climb power, and hence climb rate, that the 'bus uses. It will also affect cruise speed etc."
flightsim,3dlipy,Kortiah,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:22:19 2015 UTC,"Not really during the SID. Cost Index has more effect during the effective climb after the SID, where you don't have constraints. (it can during a SID without min/max altitude though)."

A2A makes you rebuy it, but it's the same price, and for now the FSX version is still compatible with P3D.  Majestic's Q400 lets you use both sims under the same license.

flightsim,3dk4l0,5Rya,4,Thu Jul 16 22:33:29 2015 UTC,"believe it or not im one of the few fans of FSX's default ATC. Mainly because it actually controls traffic. Most ATC addons dont. they monitor AI and try to play calls for whats going on but it never works. And i have never had a issue with default ATC. okay it does always clear you as filed and tell you to fly runway heading even if there is a ODP or SID. but you really dont have to, ATC doesn't bark at you for not being on runway heading for departure. ive found that flying VFR with flight following is the same as IFR with FSX default ATC but you can do what ever.  Basically i modified default ATC with edit voice pack. useally even if inm going IFR the default ATC has me VFR as far as its concerned. this way i can do anything i want (Fly ODP, SID, STAR's) and sill get traffic calls. another trick is to set the PLN file cruise altitude lower. say 12000. you will almost always get cleared to that altitude right off the bat. once cleared to it, dont contact the next controller on a hand off. simply monitor all controllers from then on (think of it as handing you Coms to the First officer). when you close to the destination and ready for vectors just call up the controller. dont forget you can also request diffrent transitions for approaches you dont have to recive radar vectors. when you request a transition other than vectors to final, default ATC always clears you to the inital fix of that transition. how you get there is up to you (direct, Airway, or something else) but once within 5 miles of it you are cleared for the approach and told to fly it as published.  Ive tried several ATC addons. and ive flown on both IVAO and VATSIM. and i have found Default to be the best aside from Pilot edge.  I want to add that AI sidstar is a very usefull tool."

EDIT: RIGHT ok. I just installed and took the Cherokee up for a flight. I took it to 5000 feet and did something banned by the POH, and chucked it into a few spins. OH HOLY CRAP does that get the adrenaline flowing in VR. I couldn't get that opposite rudder in quick enough :D Also tried out a few landings, for some reason I am floating really badly, maybe just need to adjust to the new viewpoint and be more careful of speed.  I ran it with ORBX NCA and Monterey Airport. I definitely need to play with DSR because it was hard to make out the runway from even a close distance, and the PAPI's are a mush. Also needed to turn off terrain shadowing and cloud reflections because they seem to cause that flickering that was there with DCOC when you look around. Once I backed off some autogen settings and got a nice framerate, it was the good old P3D VR I have missed for a while (DCOC didn't want to work with 2.5 sadly). I also started getting the OOM chime but that was probably nothing to do with FlyInside.  But oh my god, what a fantastic piece of work this is. That sensation of really just having been somewhere else, a little holiday, that VR always gives me, those moments of OH MY GOD and feeling my heart in my mouth during the spins, and the oh wow moment of taxiing to my parking spot past the huge tail of a Dash 8 being refuelled, the amazing sense of scale and weight VR gives everything.  So, so glad you brought this out dude, I will be kickstarterererartering you fully and completely with bells on :D  EDIT2: I was just on the flight deck of the A319. Its amazing sitting there.

I think I replied to you below gushing over the A319 :D I dont know what it was with the tracking, I have a feeling it has to do with the way Aerosoft have set the head movement for the cockpit. Its almost as though there is something that slightly restrains horizontal movement, so when you look right and down it doesn't quite follow correctly. I tried reloading and changing head position / resetting. I don;t think its a flyinside thing as it was perfect with the A2A cherokee"

flightsim,3dim11,TheRealWireline,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:47:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks! very glad I can try this out on P3D now, my graphics card was not able to handle DCOC very well but I have hopes it might fare better with FlyInside.  Also, now that DCOC is dicontinued, what is the safest/easiest way to uninstall it from P3D?"
flightsim,3dim11,TheRealWireline,3,Thu Jul 16 17:51:54 2015 UTC,"I believe DCOC ships with an uninstaller, you should be able to use that.  I will warn you, FlyInside P3D is still quite heavy on the GPU, it's the nature of the beast.  What sort of hardware are you running?"
flightsim,3dim11,Heaney555,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:50:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks, will give that a try. Hardware is a GTX460, sadly. I realise i'll need to upgrade before CV1/Vive. Just out of curiosity: how do the FSX-SE and P3D compare performance-wise with respective FlyInside alphas? Unfortunately I don't have enough HDD space to install SE right now, but I'm curious whether your numbers show a difference. If P3D has an edge I may upgrade my pledge (atm I'm not so confident in P3D due to few updates - I hope they are not keeping it for 3.0 to make their users pay again)"
flightsim,3dim11,Bfreak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:17:34 2015 UTC,All we need now is better resolution in Oculus itself..
flightsim,3dim11,Heaney555,2,Thu Jul 16 20:53:55 2015 UTC,Try using DSR if you have it. The improvement in the image quality is extremely good. The FlyInside software also seems to have an option to increase render resolution.
flightsim,3dim11,darkdeus,2,Thu Jul 16 21:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yup.  I don't have a 9xx GPU so I'm not sure what effect DSR has in conjunction with FlyInside.  Inside FlyInside, you can just set the resolution to 4k and you are good to go though."
flightsim,3dim11,Bfreak,3,Thu Jul 16 21:36:13 2015 UTC,"Mate, I am blown away. Just did exactly that and in the A319, its clear enough I can lean across and actually read the COPILOT'S instruments. Didn't use DSR, just your natty handy dandy resolution increaser. Also I am so impressed with the way you can put a window anywhere you want it - it will make having charts and menus so easy.  I've got a pretty complete P3D installation and what I just experienced, I know its cliched by now but that was honestly the closest you can get to really sitting in the cockpit of an airbus. With P3D's shadowing and the ORBX terrain, that was one of those Oculus WOW moments. When they bring out the new headsets it is going to be incredible"

flightsim,3dl41j,Mirthaar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:42:38 2015 UTC,The only way to do it is to install FS2004.  VRC does have a tower view inside the program but it's all wireframe and looks pretty bad.

In terms of an exact radius, there isn't one.

Something a bit more modern will probably let you run it OK but you are going to hit a performance ceiling much more quickly in terms of addons.  Can't recommend a supplier, as I am in the UK."
flightsim,3digiu,TheRealWireline,3,Thu Jul 16 17:50:32 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for a gaming laptop and you're on a tight budget, you're going to be disappointed. I'm sorry but it's the truth.  Realistically, you could probably run PMDG planes with FTX Global, sliders way down, scenery complexity on low, and autogen on sparse. Volumetric fog off.  For A2A planes and maybe the Airbus X you could probably turn that up a bit.  For PMDG planes, full ORBX regions, and high quality addon airports? Forget about it.   If you're ok with finding a balance between low settings and OK performance, I wouldn't go less than 3 GHz on the CPU. I think you may have a difficult time finding that on a tight budget, however. Considering you'd be using integrated graphics you might be better off running FSX Steam Edition since it's less GPU dependent."
flightsim,3digiu,xdarq,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:54:09 2015 UTC,"Ummm.. considering there are laptops with desktop cpus, and even the mobile cpus closing the gap with higher clock speeds, I can easily see him using a laptop for simming.

Also, good luck finding a laptop at a decent price that will run P3D, being a flight sim you need as good of a processor that you can get, that seems to be the biggest factor regarding FPS, although P3D can take advantage of the GPU more, it's still FSX at the end of the day, and still loves the CPU.  The thing is, many budget laptops aren't exactly good for gaming, as heat can also be a much bigger concern than say a desktop where you can just overclock, so you'll need to get something with a fast processor and decent cooling, as well as have a seperate GPU.  As for answering your question, I'll leave it for someone more knowledgeable than me recommend you something."

According to the EULA, Academic is only if you are on an undergrad aero course or some special US only schools aero program. If you are taking a PPL or training in any way, you ""should"" be buying the pro licence. If you wish to be entertained in your home, you ""shouldn't"" buy P3D at all. But as I said, its never checked either at purchase or later. LM know for a fact they have thousands of P3D users that are sinking tons of cash into their product and who are outwith the terms of the EULA. And as one of the CEO's of a large flight sim addons company recently said, its an arrangement that they all benefit from anyway. No one actually cares.  That said, if you discuss this on AvSim or any 'pro' YouTuber channel, you will get the official line because they are afraid of getting shafted, but the reality is you can get academic and nothing will happen at all, unless one day LM are forced to enforce the EULA due to some claim by other ESP licensees (e.g. Dovetail)."

Luckily I had the foresight to simply return the products.   If I was in your situation I would keep using the logitech 3d pro (It's actually a really well made joystick) and couple it with a throttle of your choice.

flightsim,3ddqso,Brethon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"Generally it's ok, but if you look at the pictures here there are two issues. Firstly, at the back, the stripes don't run through and there's some white bits. I know which part of the template I'd have to repaint, but I don't have the photoshop skills to actually do that, how simple it might be. I also don't like the front (which you can see in the second screenshot). I'd like the lines to sort of bend down, run underneath the body and connect to eachother, rather than cover up the whole nose. But again, I don't know exactly how to do that. Another problem is that I can't seem to get the both sides lined up properly, as is also visible in the second screenshot. The left side is lower than the right side, but when I move the left side up by even one pixel, it's suddenly higher than the other side...  Enough problems for a photoshop noob :P"
flightsim,3ddqso,packtloss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that you aren't texturing a flat surface. While the kit may be laid out in that manner, it's applied to a models exterior, and that exterior curves.  The stripes aren't curving at the back because you don't have them on the belly of the fuselage. That's the very top section on the fuselage_master. You need to use the pen tool, create a shape or shapes, add anchor points, curve them in sync with the raster, and fill them with the appropriate colors. The same goes for the nose section. This shit isn't easy if you don't know what you're doing in relation to the aircraft and especially if you don't know how to properly manipulate Photoshop.  The port and starboard striping is defiantly off by 2 pixels. That's a easy fix though.

The Ifly apparently could do it. but IDK if this was ever confirmed.  Edit: a link"

flightsim,3ddt5b,Owsen,2,Fri Jul 17 12:37:39 2015 UTC,"iFly 737 NG was the first to implement an Active Sky Next radar. It was first to implement fail-operational autoland autopilot for catIIIb approaches. It also has windows that open in the cockpit for nice days on the tarmac.  It supports multiple types of legs including Arc to Fix which is required in some approaches and arrivals. It also includes full models of the:   600 700 700ER (for transoceanic flights) 800 900 900ER BBJ BBJ2 BBJ3   These models can be customized as well. Different panels. EFIS/ND or PDF/ND. Honeywell or Collins MCP. HUD or NO HUD. Short field performance package or not. You want winglets or no winglets. Which CFM56-7B engines do you want installed? Classic CRT MFDs or LCD? Automatic reduced thrust after takeoff? Integrated or standard standby flight displays? Takeoff bump thrust or no?   And it's cheaper. VC is fantastic too. http://i.imgur.com/7Fu0w1k.png  That is what I know that separates the two.  It's panel save function isn't as automatic as PMDGs.

It goes under their Flight1 Aviation Technologies for professional use of their addons, although it can't be used for commercial use? I guess that limits it to academic environments. For a while, there was a cheap upgrade to the P3D version for FSX owners, but that was for a limited time only.  http://www.flight1tech.com/Products/AircraftSimulations/737NGforPrepar3D.aspx  This is why I don't do P3D at the moment. Ever since that stupid ""no entertainment"" EULA came out, developers have been charging more for their addons under the disguise of ""professional use"". But I guess it's still a better deal than the P3D PMDG 737NG.  However, with the FSX iFly 737 NG and DX10, the damn thing is lovely and a bargain."
flightsim,3ddt5b,packtloss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:01:01 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. /u/Help-desk-slave was asking about P3D aircraft specifically i think....So when i googled the ifly and saw no p3d i was a bit confused.  I'm in the same boat as OP - I have a need to get an NGX for p3d, as i have the 777. The Flight1 version is only $10 cheaper than the PMDG version, so that makes the competition a little bit stiffer. ($34 if you include the 'expansion')."
flightsim,3ddt5b,AviatorMoser,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:21:52 2015 UTC,"Well, the only reason I would pick the PMDG 737 NG version and spend potentially $34 more (and still have less models) is...  Let me think here.....  Ummm.....  The Boeing manuals. But those are in healthy supply online, and you could save that $34 for a completely different addon as well (like FS2Crew or GSX).  And I don't know if the policy applies to the P3D software, but Flight1 has a 30-day refund process for their FSX software. You could inquire about that, and if they do have it, and you don't like the iFly 737NG, then you could be able to get a full refund. I don't think you have that option the other way around unfortunately with PMDG."
flightsim,3ddt5b,AviatorMoser,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:36:57 2015 UTC,"However, you wouldn't be in the wrong with the PMDG simulation. It looks a little prettier, and probably does have some more advanced code under the hood, although how that translates to your style of flying is quite subjective.  Go with either! Just don't let someone tell you one is clearly better than the other because of said brand name. As with cars, that is not always the case.  Honestly, I would rather just go to town on the CaptainSim L-1011, apply my custom panel.cfg which adds dual INS, and then become an expert with the Tristar. Anyone can fly the 737.

I find the soundest to be much better as well. 2D panel also available with PMDG. Ifly does win big points for being a great value in getting all the variants for one lower price  I've only used ifly 737 with FS9 and briefly with FSX, so unfortunately I can't speak of its performance with P3D  The PMDG bird does tax my system pretty good when combined with addon airports, but for the most part it's always at least above mid 20's for frames. Mind you my i5 is overclocked to 4.6ghz and I also have a 970, so with say, flytampa YYZ I usually get mid to high 20's in performance with P3D when loading out of there.   I have used the ifly 747 with P3D though,  and actually went back to the PMDG 747 with the migration tool due to the heavy hit in performance."
flightsim,3ddt5b,Skinner_11,3,Wed Jul 15 16:11:06 2015 UTC,"The 747 is totally different in every aspect, let's not mix things up. With that system I would go for the iFly, because their 737 costs less FPS than the PMDG. I have a friend who is second officer at a company flying the 737 classic. It's really similar to the NG in terms of general design. He's also into flightsimming, and after trying both he said that the iFly VC was better represented in terms of general look (the texturing and modelling may be lower quality, but the shape of the interior and the size of things is way better than the PMDG). You can't go wrong with the PMDG either, but you know in my opinion many people don't take the iFly bird seriously, because they think that ""well, the majority uses the PMDG so that has to be the better one"". Sorry for my rant, and one more thing. Sound doesn't matter, there is an awesome soundpack on avsim which is way better than either the iFly or the PMDG sounds."

Ive tried the VOX demo and found its biggest feature (voice control) to be what shoots it in the foot.   Radar contact is good at first. but after awhile you start to feel as though its controllers are reading from a script and your doing the same performance every time. my last flight with it was from a Uncontrolled field up to Class D field in ATL. Cleard as filed (becaues that all it can do) giving me usless traffic calls enroute. oh and my favorite, vectoring me right into ATL's Approach corridor. i was staring down the buisness end of multiple airliners. seperation was non-existant. not one traffic call recived then either.  I have heard good things about ProATCX, but i cant get over the debacal of its release to buy it.  As u/Rustigearbox2 said there is VATSIM/IVAO. more realistic but also worse in a way. if no ATC is on you may as well use default ATC. Controller Quality varies, pilot quality varies even more. they really don't adhere to real world operations either  There is Pilot Edge. fantastic controllers. guaranteed coverage. adherence to Real world an current procedures, actual traffic. but it has a subscription fee and only covers the SOCAl area.  each one has its pro's and Con's. pick your poison. my recommendation is Default modified with Edit Voice Pack."

flightsim,3dd7dq,Help-desk-slave,2,Wed Jul 15 10:18:56 2015 UTC,"Welcome back to simming! Hope your stay is enjoyable. We have scattered clouds at 2000 feet and favourable winds. Drinks will be served mostly by yourself if you have them in the fridge :D  I have a 5820K @ 4.5 GHz and 2xGTX 980s, 16GB DDR4 @ 2666MHz and a Samsung 850Pro SSD, though mostly to date only ran one 980 as the SLI is a bit shonky in P3D. One thing I can say is that, as you seem to already know, the sims performance will vary MASSIVELY depending on what you have installed, and - in the case of ASN, how much its actually doing.  FTX England runs smoothly on my system, more so than FTX Norway which experiences loading stutters. Scotland also runs very nicely. P3D will load up your GPU, and you have a fairly capable card. I do not see more than 2GB VRAM usage with England or Scotland, and GPU usage does not climb above 60%, but there are some ORBX addons like Palm Springs which will push it to peaks of 99% and 2GB VRAM.  A2A addons do not tend to be performance heavy. I see about 50-60FPS in the air, and around 30-40 on the ground or during take off roll, even with all other addons running.  ASN can vary hugely. If it is injecting a lot of cloud and you are using REX, it can have a large performance impact versus those times when it is clearer. If I am in a fairly rural or small suburban area, it will still perform as above. Unfortunately with the A2A stuff I have not tested in places like Heathrow recently.  With the PMDG's in heavy scenery areas you are on dicier ground, and you are probably going to need to back off texture resolutions in REX to avoid OOM's, and autogen levels to get a decent frame rate. Take the limiter off for these guys as it seems to cause more problems than it solves.  As you rightly say, a better CPU will definitely help. The chips that usually come up in these discussions are the i5-4690K and i7-4790K, and whether there is any advantage in the i7. I re-checked recently and it DOES seem these chips can both overclock to 4.7 / 4.8 GHz, but do check into this extensively to see if this is average user reported clock speeds. If only building for flight sims and you do not expect to use the PC for applications requiring hyper-threading, then go i5. IMHO at only £80 more I would go i7. I am not sure of cache levels and other bells and whistles, but do look at the spec to see what else you get for that money.  Really I think you have a good idea what to expect - the more you add, the more it will creak, and the more you will have to back off settings. I think if you add ALL that stuff, you might be able to get away with 20-25ish FPS in an A2A, but you are going to struggle with the PMDG's especially in built up areas. It all depends on what is acceptable to you - do you want super smooth takeoff rolls, or are you happy with a bit of chug before hitting V1? Usually frame rate improves at altitude as the sim unloads a ton of autogen.  In terms of tweaking for P3D, I think its a vicious circle and does not improve much - thats been my experience anyway. What helps in one location or plane may hurt in another, and you just spend more time tweaking than flying. That said, for PMDG the OPTIMIZE_PARTS=1 tweak seems to genuinely help. Many people recommend the affinity mask tweaks, but for me this just negatively impacts texture loading as the sim seems to want that always on Core 0 (affinity mask tells the sim NOT to use core 0 in order to 'rescue' it from the system load the OS places).  I would buy REX4 and ORBX region of choice, and your preferred aircraft(s?) and see how you get on. Use something like MSI afterburner to see which parts of your system are bottlenecking you, e.g. is it the flight model on Core 0? Is it your GPU straining under scenery load? Then you can make an informed choice about upgrading.  EDIT: At some point you will still find the limits of even the most expensive, capable system. If you want to take off in a PMDG 777 from Aerosoft Heathrow, high autogen and with REX4 clouds and ASN weather, you are going to see significant frame rate drops no matter what, even with a fully OC'd 4790K and a Titan X. Sims are hungry and will just consume whatever you throw at them eventually.  Anyway, wall of text to answer wall of text, hope it helped! Any more questions feel free to ask."
flightsim,3dd7dq,TheRealWireline,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:49:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this reply, really helpful!   FTX England runs smoothly on my system, more so than FTX Norway which experiences loading stutters. Scotland also runs very nicely. P3D will load up your GPU, and you have a fairly capable card.   I suspected as much. I'm well aware that it's my CPU that bottlenecks my system. As you say I've got a fairly good card, but most of the games I play (Flight sims, ARMA etc) tend to be CPU intensive and this is where I struggle.   I noticed the FPS improvement in P3D immediately and I guessed that this was due to the sim offloading more work to the GPU.   Another question about FTX if you don't mind. Does the FTX England scenery come with it's own mesh and vector files? Or will I still need to buy the global mesh and vectors too? And do you run FTX Global? If so, what's the performance like on that too? With it being just a texture replacement I can't see it having too much effect on the CPU?  In terms of CPU usage, which settings cause the most strain? I already know autogen and traffic are the big culprits but is there anything else?    ASN can vary hugely. If it is injecting a lot of cloud and you are using REX, it can have a large performance impact versus those times when it is clearer   I'm not particularly fussed about REX. I mean it looks amazing, but I'm more bothered about the realistic weather of ASN than I am it looking pretty. Do you know how ASN performs if it's using default cloud textures? Does it just tweak the default P3D weather system to behave more realistically, or does it actually put more load on the sim?   It all depends on what is acceptable to you - do you want super smooth takeoff rolls, or are you happy with a bit of chug before hitting V1? Usually frame rate improves at altitude as the sim unloads a ton of autogen   Yeah I can already tell I'm going to have to create several different profiles depending on what type of flying I'm doing. Realistically, I'd like to buy the PMDG 737 and tweak my sim to provide the authentic airliner experience. I want it to look good from high up, 'cos that's where I'll be most of the time! I want to have to plan around realistic weather and other airline traffic, but I'm not so fussed about there being thousands of high quality trees because I won't see them for that long. I'm not bothered about flying into New York and being able to see every building in the big apple for miles around, but I want JFK airport to look good and I want to have an authentic airport experience.  I suppose in that sense, turning autogen off and the scenery level and traffic up high might be a good compromise?  Is there any guide out there about what each setting does and exactly how it impacts performance?  Again, sorry for rabling on. Normally I wouldn't be so neurotic about a game, but when I'm looking at spending more on an add on pack than I am for the main game I want to make sure I know what I'm getting into!"

But for me its much more enjoyable having such a realistic landscape to look at, then those ugly buildings ;) Close up on the ground, everything besides high quality airports isnt looking good anyways. But having that view from above: priceless."
flightsim,3d9vm9,TheRealWireline,3,Wed Jul 15 01:10:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah fair enough - one man's meat is another man's gravy and all that. The problem I find with a lack of autogen is the ""angle inconsistency"" problem. Its OK if you are a few thousand feet up, but get low enough and as you fly over a barn or some trees it looks as though reality is warping because your view of the object does not move as it should. I do quite a bit of low level flight though, really like the ORBX HD trees."

flightsim,3day8d,hairwaytophteven,3,Tue Jul 14 21:31:10 2015 UTC,"The default 737 does NOT have autoland. It has an ILS system that will guide it down the glide slope, but you have to land it yourself. What the default 737 one will do is slam you into the runway in a not good way.  The QW 757 does have an autoland system in place though.        *First: The runway you want to land at needs ILS. You can check this by looking at the FSX map. If there are green triangles coming off the edge, there is ILS.  *Second: You will need the runway course and the ILS frequency. If you click on the airport in the map it should give you a big box with a bunch of frequencies. Get the frequency and course from that list.  *Third: Put that information in the plane. In the 757 this will go in the NAV 1 radio block which is directly in front of the pilot at the top of the dashboard. The course goes in the CRS part right beside the NAV 1 window. Duplicate this for the FO side.  *Fourth: Fly the plane to the approach. This part is on you. Get yourself flying towards the green triangle at roughly 2000 feet (this number is just a good practice height. To know what real pilot do, find the approach charts online.) With the frequency and CRS put in, fly towards the localizer. When you are in the triangle, press the LOC button to have the plane fly the runway course.  *Fifth: When the glide slope comes alive (starts moving down), press the APP button to have the plane follow it down to the runway. You want to be at landing configuration by this part. If everything is done right, you will see CLASS III or AUTOLAND somewhere on on near the PFD.  This is where the plane will autoland correctly, to include a good flare. Make sure the spoilers are armed and the autobrake is set. You are responsible for making sure the throttles are idled and putting out reverse thrust if necessary."
flightsim,3day8d,Casen_,2,Tue Jul 14 22:38:39 2015 UTC,"I've gotten to do all of that. The issue I see a lot (or use to) is that once the rear gear hit the deck, the aircraft pitches up and over, violently.   99.9% sure I was doing something wrong, missed a step somewhere.

flightsim,3day8d,DetCord12B,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:12:27 2015 UTC,Make sure you retard your throttles because I believe auto throttle disconnect on landing. Don't own the aircraft but this seems normal in others.

flightsim,3day8d,DetCord12B,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:33:12 2015 UTC,It would help if you said what was going wrong. Are you able to capture the ILS with the autopilot? What happens when it does go wrong?
flightsim,3day8d,MeneMeneTekelUpharsi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:23:52 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I'm lined up with the runway and I have the LOC and then it will veer to the left. Other times the plane will just nose dive (assuming to get on the g/s.) None of this I'm blaming on the plane, but just me and not knowing which buttons to engage/disengage and when. BTW, what is a good landing speed and stopping distance for the 757, cause I always think I'm gonna overshoot the runway."
flightsim,3day8d,MeneMeneTekelUpharsi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:38:33 2015 UTC,"First of all, it's good to learn how to read approach plates.  Here is an example. Intercept altitude is 2000 feet, a good initial approach speed during this intercept is something like 180-160 knots. Make sure you have 110.9 entered into both nav radios, and your course selectors set to 022 (as seen on the top of the chart)  As for the buttons to make the ILS intercept: ""APP"" will arm both the localizer and glideslope intercept. There are plenty of other ways to do it, but for simplicity's sake we'll assume you're flying directly towards CASEE at 2000 feet and 180 knots, with APP pressed. When pressing ""APP"", you should see that both the localizer and glideslope capture are armed on the PFD.  After the autopilot intercepts the localizer, slow to 160 knots (deploying flaps on schedule). As you near the glideslope, you should see the glideslope deviation indicator start to move down; when this happens, deploy gear and slow to approach speed (again, flaps out on schedule as well). The autopilot will capture the glideslope as you cross it (assuming you pressed APP earlier to arm it), and begin descending.  If you're doing a full autoland, engage all of the autopilots (as the QW is a bit simplified, it might do this for you, I don't remember). As you pass 2500 on the radar altimeter descending (you should already be below this if intercepting at 2000), the aircraft does a systems check and announces LAND3 or CAT3 on one of the indicators on the panel, which means both autopilots are active and armed for the landing. That should be all there is to it."

flightsim,3d78at,ThePropellerHead,4,Tue Jul 14 01:44:52 2015 UTC,"Well you can put in headings, altitudes and speeds like you would with the autopilot of any other plane. Turn the knobs until they show value you want. Though you have to right click the knobs instead of left clicking them after you put in your alt, hdg, speed ect. Left clicking puts it into managed mode which is pretty much like LNAV and VNAV on boeing aircraft. Also, It seems you don't know how to use the FMC. I'd recommend you do the step-by-step flight to familiarize yourself with the plane."

If there is you can try setting the gain higher.  EDIT: Also if you're in the air a 15 on the tilt is too much I would put it closer to the center."
flightsim,3d78at,TheRealWireline,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:17:55 2015 UTC,"Just to help you memorize, when you pull the knob towards you (right click), you control the autopilot, when you push it towards the plane (left click), the FMC has control."
flightsim,3d78at,malzabin,2,Tue Jul 14 15:33:40 2015 UTC,"As others have said, DEFINITELY do the tutorial flight in the manual (the main one from LOWI to LFMN). It covers so much necessary info and sets you up extremely well for doing your own routes. The bus really does seem to rely on being programmed in the MCDU (Airbus refuse to call it an FMC) because it relies so much on calculations to manage the auto-throttle and so on. it takes quite a few hours to work through the tutorial and it will probably help massively if you print it, but its well worth the time and is actually pretty good fun."
flightsim,3d78at,Kortiah,2,Tue Jul 14 08:46:04 2015 UTC,"Yes ofcourse you can:  Just make sure that AP1 is active, ALT is set and LEFT clicked, HDG will be followed as long as theres a HDG indicated (so as long as there is a number as opposed to ""---"", the aircraft will follow that heading, same thing goes for airspeed. Also, just a very important note that helped me out alot. In you MCDU2 (right FMC) you have an option to have checklists, this will drastically improve your knowledge about the aircraft. Make sure you have the latest hotfix for the bus (the previous version had some major issues with autothrust) There's also a copilot that will do all the checklists for you; but I strongly condemn this.   As for planning:   I'd suggest getting FSCommander 9 soon to help you plan your routes. It will find routes automatically given the inputs, aircraft type, and type of route (Low vs High Alt). This is also considering you have the AIRAC update (Thats a subscription from Navigraph to update intercepts and airways monthly: this will update FSC9 as well as you aircraft's FMC and pretty much any other program/aircraft). Keep in mind, FSCommander 9 is not the best route planning software out there (for the best check out PFPX) but FSC9 is very simple to use and one of the best features is that you can connect to your FS and view your current a/c position, the route you created (obviously), download weather from NOAA and others, as well as see air traffic and live ATCs from IVAO and VATSIM flying networks. FSC9 also holds a database for runways and airports so you can get alot of info about your arrival aerodrome incase you don't have the charts.  As for the weather and terrain:  I have two things to mention. The right dial next to the tilt should be set to ""CAL"" as far as I know. Second thing is to press the button ""TERR ON ND"" to the right of the navigation displays. Something to note. This does NOT display clouds. It will only display precipitation and terrain. (Depending if you set it on WX only or WX+Terr)  What I suggest:  If you get into Flighsim more and you want to continue with the hobby, I suggest checking out ivao.aero to start learning rules and regulations and start flying online. (With other traffic, real ATC, Virtual Airlines, etc etc) -- You also have VATSIM if you will be flying mainly in the US as most US traffic fly on VATSIM. As for Europe, Africa, Middle East, and some of Asia as well as Australia, IVAO is more predominant (I also see regular traffic in South America. Both these networks will drastically improve your knowledge and communication skills (at least it did so for me because I learn best by doing).  Incase you have no idea what I'm talking about, take a look at IVAO's web program that shows a map view of current status. IVAO Webeye  If you have any questions, feel free to PM me :)  I normally fly on the A320"
flightsim,3d66db,DcoltGaming,4,Mon Jul 13 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"Hi there, firstly, are you by any chance starting the approach from a save point? That often royally screws the bus up, it doesn't seem to handle it. Second, it looks like you have not armed the APPR button. Third, you may be too slow for your flap setting, meaning the bus is trying to increase your speed. That often means it stops bothering to follow the flight plan especially if it goes into alpha floor. Your FD is showing you are below F speed, but it looks like you are only flaps 2, hence the speed callout. It looks like you are at or actually below Vapp very early but not configured correctly at first. You have some blue in your landing memo saying FLAPS FULL which seems to confirm this. At no point does the 'bus go into ""G/S"" mode which it should if the glideslope is captured correctly, though maybe this part is not on the video. Are you using the EGLL ILS approach?  EDIT: There is also an issue with the bus where depending WHEN you press APPR, it can capture the GS in the wrong direction. If you use the copilot function, you wait til you hear ""localiser alive"" and then hit APPR. It may be that its captured from the wrong direction, and though the runway visually looks like its to your left, in fact the reciprocal glide slope would be to the right of your position if you were on the opposite heading, which the HSI shows. Apologies if I have misundertood and this is a different type of approach.  Also don't know if you have spent time over at the PMDG forums but its perfectly fine to be anonymous here if you want. No one will crap on you about ""full names in the forums please"" ;)"
flightsim,3d66db,TheRealWireline,3,Mon Jul 13 21:31:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. This was from a save as I tried to complete this multiple times. I would normally arm the approach button when the glide slope is captured, but in this case it didn't happen. I will retry with higher speeds to see if that occurs. I am using the ILS 09L approach (110.30). After rigorous testing, the HSI does line up, about half the way down the runway, and so it is likely that it is capturing the ils for 27R on the same frequency. Do you know how to solve this?  Regards  DcoltGaming"
flightsim,3d66db,TheRealWireline,2,Mon Jul 13 22:58:14 2015 UTC,"If I am understanding correctly, 27R is the reciprocal of 09L, and so if the 'bus is indeed capturing in the wrong direction, then you need to ensure you hit APPR at the right time. Checking the manual it looks like this is after you hear ""localizer alive"", and it partcularly seems to be an issue if there is a sharp turn to final - the turn must be less than 90 degrees before you will get the call. The final turn you have on the display looks bigger than 90 so that might be why its affecting you. Do you particularly want to fly that STAR?  EDIT: There's a good part in the manual about what speeds to have and when, in the tutorial section, green dot speed, S speed, F speed, Vapp etc, and at which stages in the approach you should aim for each. Having the copilot on helps because the flap settings are done automatically. You can always take them off later once you are happy everything is working."
flightsim,3d66db,TheRealWireline,3,Mon Jul 13 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"Ah ok. I was flying this originally with proatcx, and so it was a atc assigned STAR. If this is the case, then that would explain why it works in the 737. Will need to try the copilot as have used Fs2crew up to now."
flightsim,3d66db,TheRealWireline,3,Mon Jul 13 23:33:42 2015 UTC,"Yes the bus can sometimes do some odd things especially if there are some tight turns in the approach. It can sometimes be difficult to get the thing to slow down if it does not calculate the deceleration point correctly. I am no expert of course so there is likely something I have missed. Selecting a smooth STAR helps a lot and being really sharp on speeds, otherwise it sort of throws a mini tantrum and takes over flying, just like the real thing :) The copilot function helps a lot because it will tie right into the airbus logic, so you know for a fact you are in the right phase of flight."

This solution didn't work for me, but it might for you.   Here are the steps I would recommend: 1) Uninstall it 2)Restart your computer 3)Make sure that you have the latest version downloaded 4)Turn off everything AV (antivirus) related. Make your computer less protected than a baby in the woods alone in the middle of the night 5)Install the 757 (being sure to run the .exe as an administrator) 6)Turn back on your AVs then restart your computer 6)Go in to FSX, load up any random flight you want (but don't use the 757, use the default trike), then go into ""Addon Manager"" after the flight loads. 7)Find the 757 and either activate it or make sure it is activated 8)close your flight and load up the 757. You don't need to go anywhere with it, just load it up 9)Close FSX and try the QW livery manager (the separate program with all the 757s load info options and such), being sure that you're trying to install a .qwl file you downloaded from the Quality Wings website. If none of that works, I'm truly stumped, and you need to contact QW or go to their forums. I have many liveries installed for FSX:SE, so using it in SE is not your problem. Sorry for the extreme detail, but I don't know how experienced with FSX you are so I wanted to make sure nothing is lost on you."

However you have also set off my need for a rant, apologies for indulging myself ;)  I've often wondered how companies think about customer service. My feeling is that they tend to see it as pure overhead - you are paying a customer service tech to sit there and wait to be contacted, and earning nothing. That was one of the reasons why ASUS completely overhauled and contracted out its customer services - the CS firm had their performance tied to the profit they make, and ASUS reduced overall costs by contracting out. The problem is, the service is crap.  With smaller companies, I reckon the CS guys are basically the devs, and they each have their own little account that picks up queries. With some companies I think you send an email, it sits in someones ""I really don't have time for that"" box until they can palm it off on someone else or they get bored on a coffee break. I can totally see why forums became so much more common, because there are always motivated users on hand to help out in between time. That said ORBX are great at picking up forum queries.  I've not had experience with JustFlight, I would be interested to hear if you get any joy as that is very disappointing to hear they have not helped so far. I always make a mental note of anything like that and it influences my buying decisions."

flightsim,3d4rsq,HappyJackisHappy,6,Mon Jul 13 14:54:38 2015 UTC,"Both work well. Flight models tend to be a bit more dynamic in X-Plane, which makes small GA planes more fun to fly. FSX often has better systems simulations, which is important for big tubeliners. That said, both can be done in both."
flightsim,3d4rsq,bastibe,4,Mon Jul 13 15:15:28 2015 UTC,"If you want to learn, the one massive advantage that FSX has is the Rod Machado flight school. Its basically a condensed PPL / Instrument Rating (plus a TINY BIT of commercial pilot stuff) in the sim. Hands down it taught me the most about flying than anything else, even if the venerable C172SP you use in it has many superiors.  It goes into great depth on pattern work and landings, a little on VOR navigation (though could really be improved). IMO I can't believe someone hasn't made an addon that takes this idea and builds on it. FSFlyingSchool is the nearest thing but that is more designed to improve flying skills you already have. FSX also has a huge aviation encyclopaedia, and some missions to get you in the swing, so from a beginner learning perspective it is second to none - even P3D whose educational aspect would essentially be supplied from whichever learning institution might have purchased it.  XPlane does not have this at all, though one caveat is that FSX: Steam when I last checked, the flight school was bugged to hell. Hopefully they fixed it!"

Get FSX first and learn the basics (how to fly a pattern, land without crashing etc.). Later on you can make a switch to X-Plane, try which of the two you like more. Both can be used for learning how to talk to ATC and navigation. :)    You can get good deals on both if you're patient and wait for steam sale :)"

I have a lot of cash tied up in ORBX addons and I want to to try out the FSX FlyInside VR alpha.

All of the installers that can be installed into Prepar3d v2 will allow installation if FSX is installed as well. Lots of users have this setup.  The only side by side sims that create issues are having an installation of FSX Steam Edition and boxed FSX. FSX Steam will end up creating different registry entries if boxed FSX is already installed which confuses the installers.   Installing Orbx products onto multiple machines is where it technically goes outside the license terms but so many people have networked setups or backup machines it's really a non-issue, nobody will get chased down."

flightsim,3czlbg,TheRealWireline,5,Sun Jul 12 07:38:17 2015 UTC,"Its definitely low speed as the ""ears"" are extended, which IIRC are to aid in stability during landing. Concorde had unique curves and contours to its wings and a COG management system which aided in low speed stability, but the Tu struggled in this range. They added the 'ears' to help with pitch stability on landing. Why the gear isn't down, not sure. Maybe its just a high-alpha pass or something."
flightsim,3czlbg,TheRealWireline,5,Sun Jul 12 12:09:52 2015 UTC,"Just departed and brought the gear up through a low overcast layer. This is moments before speeding up and raising the nose. Perfectly fine (and expected/normal) to have the nose lowered during takeoff, landing, and ground ops at low speed. One can see  examples of the Concorde with a low nose and gear up as well during low-speed flight. Note that like the Concorde upon departure, I have the nose only one ""notch"" down in the shallower position, rather than fully down. The cool thing about this model is that utilizing the canards does result in a very noticeable difference in flight dynamics."

If you look at this picture, right in the centre of the top part of the dashboard you will see three buttons - AP1, AP2 and A/THR. The last one is the auto-throttle. However if you look down at the thrust levers at the bottom centre, you will see that the little grooves they run in are marked with lettering. It says ""CL"" about 3/4 of the way up. At least for the A319, once you have taken off, shortly after you should move the throttle to the ""CL"" point.  There are a ton of things you need to know though, its also possible you are making the plane sad by not having retracted the flaps or disarmed the spoilers (black levers at the bottom of the pic). Flight simming is a pretty huge topic area so dont worry about not knowing stuff, learning is part of the fun.

Falcom BMS is a classic, and probably the best ""true"" dynamic campaign where your actions influence the strategic situation.   WOFF is still extremely immersive and fantastic as a WW1 recreation, you go day-by-day as a pilot thorugh WW1 with historical squadrons, aircraft, aces, etc. The front lines and squadrons and aircraft are historically based, there's no ""what-if"" movement or strategic simulation, so it's not like destroying factory X will cause the front to move or resupply to be lower or something like that.

flightsim,3d0k2u,BlakeTheGreat,6,Sun Jul 12 14:20:26 2015 UTC,get out of the jet and do some pattern work in 172/152   just fly a simple 1500' agl left hand pattern   during landing controls for speed and altitude are swapped  use throttle to control altitude and pitch to control airspeed
flightsim,3d0k2u,Elios000,2,Sun Jul 12 15:46:47 2015 UTC,"Which aircraft? Different birds require different approaches. Pitching up too early if your speed was right would typically lead to a stall too far above the runway if you are in a small GA plane, so you may actually be coming in too fast. Typically you cut the throttle as you cross the runway threshhold and then learn to gauge visually when to time the flare. Some people say to look to the end of the runway, but with flight sims you dont have depth perception so its better to look off the nose to the left and look for ""runway rush"" where the runway suddenly appears to get wider very fast. You will also suddenly be able to make out textures. By this point though you will already have made adjustment to pitch. Speed management is key, and rather than flaring try to think about ""transition to slow speed flight"". A last minute yank will often lead to ballooning.  If you are in an airliner then maybe look up the manual to find out when to pull the throttle (don't leave it til ""retard"" in an airbus, pull it at ""40"") and what the required pitch angle is on landing."
flightsim,3d0k2u,TheRealWireline,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:47:31 2015 UTC,The one that I'm having trouble with is the A330
flightsim,3d0k2u,TheRealWireline,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:30:22 2015 UTC,"Is that the default FSX or third party payware? I have only flown the Aerosoft A319 and I found this guide to be quite helpful. The pitch angle at flare for the A320 is very small, only 5-6 degrees, so aim to reach this angle gradually alongside taking the power out at the recommended point. Of course that is for the A320 series aircraft so there may be differences. EDIT: With airliners you are more 'flying the plane to the runway' than flaring as you would in a C172."
flightsim,3d0k2u,RoboRay,2,Sun Jul 12 16:11:55 2015 UTC,Learning the basics is a lot easier in a basic plane than a tubeliner.  Put away the big jets and practice in a little single engine prop bird.

I qualify for the academic license since I'm a student so they are priced pretty similarly (fsx is cheaper, but not to a point where it would impact purchasing decisions.)"
flightsim,3cxn5d,Jewell45,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:33:42 2015 UTC,"Most addons work, I wouldn't worry about witch licence to get either, Lockheed Martin isn't going to bust down your door just because you bought an academic licence.  The only thing that I would say is bad over fsx is that some companies, PMDG for example, make you pay more for their P3D products."
flightsim,3cxn5d,ramrunner800,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:42:58 2015 UTC,"They're pretty much all compatible, and FSX doesn't look nearly as good as P3D.  Your GPU might struggle a bit with some of P3D's more advanced features though."
flightsim,3cxn5d,Elios000,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:25:37 2015 UTC,i wouldnt even look at FSX any more these days X-Plane or P3D   both can look good but your going to spend a ton of cash on P3D   X-Plane can look just as good for less but takes more work and imo has a better flight model
flightsim,3cxn5d,TheRealWireline,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:37:53 2015 UTC,"Firstly, CPU is the most important component for any of the sims. XP and P3D will use your GPU, sure - but you need a CPU with a LOT of single-thread grunt to power the flight model and autogen.  Discussions of which sim looks best always result in arguments. Broadly XPlane can look great if you put a lot of effort in yourself locating and installing the widely available freeware, but if you prefer to just buy something and install it then P3D is the way to go as it has a massive selection of scenery, environment and aircraft addons. XP is catching up but it does currently require a lot of patience and dedication.  If appearance is #1 for you, then P3D is your choice over FSX due to the shadowing, HDR, volumetric fog and IMO better colouring."
flightsim,3cxn5d,TheRealWireline,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:06:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I realized I should have put CPU after I posted, I actually forget what it is though and I'm not at my computer.   I'm fine with putting some work into making it look nice. What appeals to me about X Plane is the flight model and realism of crosswinds and stuff, but I'm unsure if I could make it look as good as P3D+add-ons. Do you know if there are add-ons that improve the p3d flight model?   I plan on mostly flying various GA planes if that helps too."
flightsim,3cxn5d,iusethisshitatwork,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:27:05 2015 UTC,"The thing I am finding with X-Plane is that, though you can indeed make it look fantastic, its very piecemeal. You can get a tool that lets you generate your own scenery tiles from satellite imagery data, but it takes a very long time and you will experience a lot of situations where you overfly transitions from your new scenery to default, which can be jarring. Whilst the same can happen with P3D, when you buy something like an ORBX region you cover a very large area in one go, and a lot of the ORBX US regions butt up nicely against one another. You can also add in OpenLC Europe and BASE / Vector to get a large coverage. So whilst both can look great, P3D CURRENTLY makes it easier, if costlier, to do so. I have seen videos of X-Plane that are mind blowing, but you often see that the user will quickly fly out of the area of most impressive beauty because they have not yet got scenery for the whole area.  In P3D, very often addon aircraft will have their own flight modeling which massively improves over the base model. A2A's Cessna and cherokee are considered among some of the best flight modeling available, even though it is ""lookup table"" based. Similarly PMDG have excellent additional flight modeling.  If by GA you mean fairly small, light aircraft, then you will be spoilt for choice in all of the sims. In fact XPlane could still be a good choice because flying a lot of short, VFR trips won't so quickly take you outside of the ""upgraded"" areas."
flightsim,3cvv78,zalemam,23,Sat Jul 11 05:15:56 2015 UTC,I suggest using a flair system to identify the type of sim in each post. Just make a rule that simply states all post need to be flared accordingly.   Alternatively you could require all post to include the Sim in the title. Like [Sim] - Title goes here.
flightsim,3cvv78,danlocke123,6,Sat Jul 11 07:54:04 2015 UTC,+1 to the flair idea. My favourite posts are full flights documented by lots of screenshots- would be great to be able to find various posts quickly.

It is pretty dead, but I have personally had a few good conversations in there."
flightsim,3cvv78,TheRealWireline,3,Sat Jul 11 14:38:26 2015 UTC,"Regarding downvoting, I would like to see something similar to other subreddits indicating what the reddit is for and what is deemed inappropriate / downvote worthy. It disappoints me every time I see someone new, asking a question, and a ton of downvotes appear with no kind of comment or reasoning. There may be a good reason for it, but queries and questions are a huge part of learning when you are new and we end up putting newbies off by downvoting, presumably because theirs is not a ""quality"" submission.  We have all been there - been new once, we all struggled with knowing when to retract flaps, or how to get something to install, and especially as simming is such a tiny corner of the 'gaming' market, we need as many people as possible to discover how glorious it is, and more importantly to want to stay :) Plus, ""A good pilot is always learning"".  I know we are nowhere near the ""open contempt"" stage of newbie question answering of some forums, but the subtle anonymous sense of ""you are not welcome here"" of downvoting has affected many subreddits in the past (one reason you often see comment scores hidden). There have been studies that indicate that downvoting actually does nothing to increase the quality of submissions, or volume of same - it makes ""the downvoted"" worse, the ""upvoted"" stay the same, and the ignored just don't come back - even if they stay ""subscribed"".  I will admit to feeling irritation when the same old questions come up again and again. I think a lot of those would benefit from a sticky if that's possible, or maybe a revamp of the stuff on the sidebar."
flightsim,3cvv78,TheRealWireline,2,Mon Jul 13 08:47:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, it annoys me when I see downvoted submissions with legitimate questions or discussions without someone providing input as to why. In fact, this is what generally keeps me away from the iRacing subreddit - everything is downvoted for no reason. The issue I see, though, is that people who downvote with no reason tend to do it regardless what the rules of the subreddit say because it's really unenforceable. It is still something we will consider, though, and we appreciate your input."
flightsim,3cvv78,Derbysieger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:10:54 2015 UTC,"That is a good point. I was trying to understand why downvoters downvote, and I suppose all you can really do is guess because they never speak up. I know that's the purpose of the anonymous system and it makes sense on a huge reddit where submissions have hundreds of replies, but here it just stands out as mean spirited I think. One guess as to why they downvote here was because they believe the reddit is only for screenshots and pictorial flight logs or articles, and downvote anything else, but I'm not sure. It could equally just be because they want the ""hot"" page to have the ""best"" stuff (in their view) at the top only. Maybe they just like downvoting things no matter what? Who knows.  I have seen some reddits that just hide negative scores and only show positive numbers, a bit like the youtube system. I just think here that anonymous downvoting just makes everyone look like a bit of a douche. Especially as this reddit generally manages to stand above a lot of the flight sim forums in terms of friendliness and openness to new users, I think it would be a good way to go to hide the downvotes."
flightsim,3cvv78,ghostrider176,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:46:32 2015 UTC,"Yes please, it really annoys me when I find that submissions by people that are obviously new to flightsims initially get downvoted without a single comment to the submission (it usually stops when someone calls out the bs). I want new people to feel welcome here and I think that a reminder about what the downvote button is for and something on the sidebar (like an FAQ) that you could refer to would help a lot. With that being said, the majority of redditors here are very open and friendly towards new people but I still see submissions that ask simple questions being downvoted from time to time."

Just the fact the people want to not allow any combat sims, or ban Outerra and WT content...or jesus christ someone even suggests to not deal with FSX?   All the armchair-pilot-personalities on here are really getting to me. Go over to /r/flying and no one in the irl flying community is so judgmental and narrow-minded as it can sometimes get on this sub.

The rules that are being put in place are definitely not exclusive - the unwritten rules of the subreddit are just becoming written for clarity and transparency. Nothing that was previously permitted is being excluded. Included in the rules is no discrimination against other flight sims.

flightsim,3cvv78,squinkys,2,Fri Jul 17 17:05:21 2015 UTC,"Another common request is a community TeamSpeak server. Before we implement one, we need to gauge just how much interest there is as we do already have an IRC channel and I've never really seen anyone use it (full disclosure: I've used it maybe once or twice in the three years I've been a part of this community). Do we move to TeamSpeak and ditch IRC? Do we keep IRC and not bother with TS?   /r/hoggit already has alot of these community things, and isn't really about the A-10C anymore, though still almost exclusively about combat aviation. There's also undoubtedly a large intersect between the readership of the two sub reddits, perhaps the teamspeak/IRC channel for the two can be reused."

For me, add-ons in screenshots are just as important as knowing what sim it is. I like how some posters have adapted to commenting on their own post with all the info. I just can't think of how to encourage more to do that.   Self-promotion should be limited. Maybe only allow one self-linked youtube post per week? That way if someone has a weekly podcast they can post it, but we don't get three links a day from the same user to their own content..."

I'm not regretting my purchase by any means but it seems like a lot was left out in regards to US based carriers which I did not know before purchasing.  Which is my own fault. I don't remember a payware aircraft especially a commercial airliner that did not have this option.   The only other request I would ask of the Aerosoft team is to make available American flight crew voices."

flightsim,3cq4rn,squinkys,3,Thu Jul 9 21:45:50 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, I figure there's probably some Falcon BMS pilots here that don't yet frequent /r/hoggit that might wanna get in on this upcoming event with us!  The details are below, stop on over our IRC or TS or leave a comment and let us know if you'd like to fly with us!    Inspired by how much fun we had with Lawlcat running a weekend campaign with BMS last weekend let's do it again.  Who, What, When, Where  Over the weekend of the 24th of this month I will be running a 24/7 1x speed Iron Fortress campaign vs. the Strong DPRK AI on the Hoggit Dedicated Server.  For those of you new to BMS, The campaign is completely dynamic!  The battlefield is very alive and reflects your contributions to the war effort.  Who should join up? (protip: everyone who wants to)  This will be challenging, but don't despair we're still gonna have fun with this, we don't really do a lot of super seriousface stuff so I want to make sure that even if you feel too green for it that you are welcome to participate!  The only thing I ask is that you have the fundamentals of the F-16 down, and we're gonna try to run some training sessions between now and then.  Don't worry!  The F-16 is really simple compared to the A-10!  Commanders and human AWACS  Also I'd like to add a little twist to it.  I'd like to see human AWACS and human commanders running the show.  AWACS is staring at the campaign map and helping your virtual pilots through the virtual skies, pointing them to (or away from) the enemy.  BMS has some very rudimentary tools to achieve this but it does work and if you've got the right mindset for it, it is a lot of fun.  Human commanders would be pretty fun too.  Pretty much you dictate the strategy for a slot of time.  Decide what type of missions we want to run, where we want to run them, and define Hoggit's strategy as we repel the godless Best Koreans.  Of course you'll be able to fly too as long as it doesn't cut into your duty!  So dust off those totally legit copies of Falcon4.exe and let's see what Hoggit is made of when it's time for the rubber to meet the road!  If you are interested in commanding please comment below the times you think you can be available.  I'd say you really probably want at least 2 hours of time so you can get a few missions planned, and it would also be helpful if you can manage our airfield's assets and setup BARCAP and other uses for our AI aircraft to keep our airfield defended and well reconned.  There's lots of people who can help you with the logistics of that though, so don't worry about it too much if you don't know the ins and outs of the UI.  Leave some feedback or just tell me how awesome I am  If you plan on flying some sorties with out just put a note in the comments.  No need to get specific with dates or times, just trying to judge the interest level.  Thanks guys!"
flightsim,3cs84l,JarrettLeger,3,Fri Jul 10 10:21:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not able to get to my sim to take some screenshots but the first step is to get a destination in the GPS.  You can do this either from the startup screen by clicking on ""Flight Planner"" or clicking the icon on the GPS that looks like a D with an arrow through it (stands for Direct-To aka direct to destination).  The flight planner gives you a few more options such as directing you through known airways and VORS/NBDS if you want a more realistic flight plan.  The direct-to option will just send you straight from point A to point B without any regard for terrain or real world airways.    Once in the cockpit you can either pres the CDI softkey at the bottom of the Garmin 1000 GPS until you see ""GPS"" instead of ""VLOC"" or press the OBS button above the attitude indicator and it should change to say GPS.  This will tell your aircrafts flight systems to use the GPS information instead of VOR comm frequencies.    From there it's a matter of turning on the AP and toggling the Nav hold on/off."

flightsim,3cqnfy,TheRealWireline,2,Fri Jul 10 09:44:35 2015 UTC,"Yes this is the latest version, there is also an a320/a321 pack. It's worth the money if you're starting out with airliners. It's not as indepth as PMDG, but has enough depth to do anything you would do as a normal pilot. It has some quirks and bugs, as anything does and the performance is ok. I usually get 18-25 FPS with it with my system. (i7 920, GTX 660, 6GB RAM)"
flightsim,3cqnfy,OfficialShip2000,2,Fri Jul 10 00:24:05 2015 UTC,"I just bought both of those aircraft today.  I'm enjoying them immensely so far.  I have a few habits I need to break from flying primarily Boeing aircraft but it seems like a solid purchase.   I'm spoiled by PMDG being able to do all the loads and fuel from the FMC.  AFAIK,  you can only use the external fuel tool that comes with the Airbus before starting up FSX.  It does all the calculations for you though,  you only have to import your departure and arrival ICAO codes.   The only downside so far is how slow the livery downloads are from the Aerosoft website,  at least for me. It took twenty minutes to download a Jetblue livery.  :("

flightsim,3cqnfy,wvuchip,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:40:43 2015 UTC,"Stupid question, but is there any chance you have PFPX set up calculate fuel in pounds for the Airbus? AFAIK the Aerosoft tool is kilograms only. 1lb = 0.45kg, so that might explain why you don't seem to have enough capacity."
flightsim,3cqnfy,Atlantean,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:12:30 2015 UTC,"Could be an issue, but solely using Aerosoft's tool and putting KLAX/KJFK as the departure/arrival airports limits the passengers and cargo to about 25% of max in order to have sufficient range."
flightsim,3cqnfy,wvuchip,4,Fri Jul 10 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"I just checked it out myself, and you're right that you can't max out the load sliders on KLAX/KJFK, but that seems accurate to me. AA's transcontinental A321 seats only 102, while the normal one seats 181.  I can enter KLAX/KJFK, max out the passengers slider, and get cargo to about 5,200 kg before hitting the fuel limit. Finnair report 5 tonnes as the limit on their A321, while Air Canada says 2,600 kg. Presumably both of those figures exclude passenger baggage. The 17,000 kg cargo limit on the Aerosoft A321 seems like a lot to me; the Emirates A380 has space for 8 tonnes in addition to the passengers and bags."

The Carenado being $40 only reinforces the value of the Q400 at $50 - Carenado is well regarded as having very pretty models with shallow systems modelling, while the Q400 has incredible systems depth, uses an external flight model program (from NASA?) to overcome the limitations of the FS engine, and is gorgeous on top of that."
flightsim,3cq20f,Brethon,2,Thu Jul 9 22:18:14 2015 UTC,"You can get the pilot version and upgrade to the pro version for the cost difference between the two if you decide you want more than the pilot later on. Honestly though, the pilot version is really intricate. I didn't even know the pro version was out yet TBH.  The price for the pilot version is borderline worth it IMO, but I think you have to really want a high quality dash 8 in order to justify it.

You almost certainly won't be able to tell much difference and it will free up a decent amount of VAS. The scenery detail radius slider also has a significant impact, as well as scenery complexity and autogen.

flightsim,3cmuge,AviatorMoser,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:36:46 2015 UTC,"Yikes, that's not an extensive addon list either. I would follow u/breeett advice and switch to 1024x1024 textures in REX. There are several texture optimization threads for other addons at AVSIM, but I don't know if anyone is actually truly seeing an improvement.  I had thought with P3D moving stuff over to the GPU, and with all that VRAM you have on your 980, that you shouldn't be getting OOM errors. It seems since the P3D 2.5 update that OOM reports have skyrocketed."

I wish there was some way to physically limit the ram p3d uses and just not generate any more textures until the ram usage decreased. And a way to purge old ram that's loaded unnecessarily."
flightsim,3cmuge,xdarq,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:23:09 2015 UTC,"Simply put: Orbx PNW + detailed KSEA + PMDG is a lethal combination. The Seattle area is notoriously hard on the simulator's VAS resources due to a combination of complex physical geometry and texturing requirements. The FSX engine (from which P3D is derived) is practically an antique today and was never well optimized for the 64 bit multi-core system environments in common use today. Just as well, the vanilla product at the time of release was so far under the 32 bit VAS limit and there was an entirely reasonable expectation that FSX would be long obsolete today (replaced by future iterations of the MSFS product) that the platform developers clearly didn't put much effort into intelligently managing memory resources when approaching it. A sensible design tradeoff, given the circumstances.  For the record, FlyTampa publicly declined to develop a new KSEA for FSX given these limitations. They concluded it simply isn't possible to deliver a high fidelity scenery that meet their usual standard and ensure compatibility with the complex aircraft add-ons and the Orbx regions that most users have.  My suggestion would be to use 1024 textures in REX (reduce VAS usage by several hundred MB) and disable the Orbx scenery region when flying into or out of KSEA with a complex jetliner, which should lower your VAS usage by another ~300-400 MB and give you just enough headroom to get by with a PMDG aircraft."

The ""soon to be released"" aerosoft CRJ700 is also an option. Of course it's been been close to release for years now.

And you can stay at 250 kts until final approach and then start deploying flaps. Flaps 9 at 250 kts, Flaps 18 or 22 at 200 kts, then 45 at 160 and below.

flightsim,3cks3n,ArcticBrewFella,4,Thu Jul 9 03:17:32 2015 UTC,clouds are horrible. control your own weather. you can download down-rez cloud bitmaps to get a boost.  Finding certain things to lower is key. Trade-offs.
flightsim,3cks3n,atonesir,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:26:41 2015 UTC,"Overclock the CPU? I am not sure for XPlane, but the other flight sims do not tend to get on very well with AMD processors. A quick search on the internet suggests that the Intel equivalent of that CPU is the 3.4GHz i5-3570K (sadly an AMD GHz is not equivalent to an Intel GHz because of IPC, or instructions per cycle). Its OK, but flight sim land is the kingdom of the big CPU wang swingers. If you can find out how to squeeze some more performance out of your chip, that might help.  Other than that, others may be able to suggest alternate weather addons that are a little lighter on frame rates."
flightsim,3cks3n,TheRealWireline,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"Currently, clouds are a killer in X-Plane, and the 280X isn't the best GPU out there. It's equivalent to a 680, and X-Plane's clouds kill my 670. Unfortunately, your best option is to turn your clouds way down, but even that may help.  Option number two is to buy SkyMaxx Pro, which replaces X-Plane's default clouds with much more frame rate-friendly (and much prettier) clouds. SkyMaxx's only drawback is, at the moment, it can't draw distant weather, which means if you are flying through an area of dynamic weather, the clouds may reload often.   my computer SHOULD be able to run it just fine   Depending on rendering settings. As has been said, X-Plane is all about single-thread performance, and Intel kills AMD for single-thread. Add to that your GPU is a few generations behind the current and it's a machine which X-Plane can really hammer."

I'm probably going to try the CH Fighterstick soon.  EDIT: It dawns on me that there might not be a dead zone on the stick, but it's probably due to my curve setting to overcome the center slop."

flightsim,3cjtj3,Artur96,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"I currently have both of those. I'm currently using the logitech for the stick, and the t-flight for the throttle.  The T-flight tension sucks. When you move it about 80% in any direction it tightens up and requires more muscle to move it, which causes you to over correct.  The throttle has a rather large dead zone at half throttle, as well as a mechanical ""catch"". So moving it from 0 to 100% it catches in the center.  You can remove the catch by taking it apart and removing the tab with a dremel (I've done it on 3 different ones now), but the dead zone is built into the electronics.  My current plan is to replace the t-flight first with a CH Pro throttle, and get an CH Fighterstick a little later to replace the logitech.  My only issue with the logitech is that it has quite a bit of play in the center (flops around a bit)."

flightsim,3cjtj3,Sketchy_Uncle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:47:50 2015 UTC,"Personally, I use a Thrustmaster T-flight Hotas X for my simming. For the price, it feels solidly built, the movement is good (though it can feel a tad jerky when making tiny, tiny movements, This can be reduced by dropping the tension on the stick), the throttle is built well too.  Plenty of buttons and the stick can have the tension adjusted with a dial underneath. Had it for about 4 months now and not had any problems. Even got it working as a H-shifter for Euro Truck Sim 2 with the aid of Xpadder. Be warned though, there is a catch in the middle of the throttle, so that can be a little annoying - is great for Elite Dangerous though, where 1/2 throttle on the stick = 0 in-game; <50% is reverse and >50% is forwards.  I can see how the catch would be annoying for some, and it does give me some frustration at times, though I've come to work with it and I can safely say I have as much precision on the throttle as one without a catch.  As for the stick getting more tense at the edges, it's not really a problem unless you're flying fighter aircraft and need full roll/pitch, but in that case I'd imagine you'd be moving the stick quickly and forcefully which would negate the extra tension significantly. For flying most aircraft in FSX, I doubt you'd need more than 80% - at least, I don't when I'm flying a Spitfire/Cessna 182/Commanche 250.  Can't say much for the Logitech one, frankly, as I've not used it. The throttle (at least, I assume that's what that black strip is below the stick) could be tricky to get fine movements out of.  TL;DR: Both are good sticks. I can personally vouch for the Hotas X being a quality product if you can overlook the flaws (and at the price range, you can expect there to be flaws). Other people in the thread are more knowledgeable about the Logi stick, ask them questions on it."

flightsim,3ci530,redcode,3,Wed Jul 8 02:22:37 2015 UTC,"Hi,  I'm currently using a LG 34UM95 and have no complaints at all. This monitor is running at 3440x1440, which I find to be more than enough (no need for 4K). A zoom-setting of .70 seems to be the most realistic. Anything lower will give you a fisheye effect and very bad depth perception. You could go higher of course, but that will probably cut over some instruments. Most of my flying is with FSX Boxed. Majority of the time I have frames in upper 20's (locked 30), I'm running on a 780.  Please let me know if you have anymore questions."

EDIT: and im not sure if PE offers text atc service but i do know VATSIM offers text atc if you are new or cant talk.  ive heard multiple people with hearing or speech disabilities able to fly with live atc on vatsim and the controller is happy to help with whatever they need, so they can enjoy the sim as much as everyone else."
flightsim,3cf43i,ppface12,3,Tue Jul 7 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are good and bad for both. (Pilotedge has a limited area, etc)  But, nothing is stopping someone form using both."
flightsim,3cf43i,packtloss,2,Tue Jul 7 17:45:51 2015 UTC,"That limited area is getting bigger soon, but still not the whole world."
flightsim,3cf43i,coma24,3,Wed Jul 8 19:29:52 2015 UTC,"PE provides something unique (at a cost, since it takes a lot of money to provide that unique service), and as a result, the community is fairly vocal about it. Nobody is being paid to say anything about it.  Nobody was paid for these testimonials, or even asked to send a testimonial: http://www.pilotedge.net/pages/testimonials-and-case-studies. Same with this thread: http://forums.pilotedge.net/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=497  None of the magazines (AOPA, Flying, etc) which have run editorials on the service were paid for those pieces.  Also, there are plenty of people who found the service wasn't for them (there are compromises we must make by having 2-3 on-duty controllers doing the job of 400+ people) and have been posted reviews along those lines, too.  On the surface, it makes sense to compare PE and VATSIM since they both offer 'online ATC' but the approach is so different at so many levels, it's not surprising to see camps developing which prefer one of over the other. The gulf between, say, VATSIM/IVAO is much smaller as they both have similar operating models.  And lastly, you're right, the controllers who volunteer their time on VATSIM generally do a great job, and I too salute them for doing it for free. FWIW, I actually controlled there for 4000+ hours before starting PilotEdge, during which time I tried hard to encourage r/w pilots to use it. The issues that I ran into time and time again when trying to bring r/w pilots to that platform were the catalyst for starting PE."
flightsim,3cf43i,coma24,2,Wed Jul 8 15:58:24 2015 UTC,"sounds to me like pilot edge has a strong community and everyone seems to enjoy it regardless of paying or not. i guess i was just being ignorant about PE cause all of a sudden a pay-to-fly ATC service popped up and it seemed like out of nowhere, ive seen online so many people talking about it. maybe i will just have to bite the bullet and give it a try. :)"
flightsim,3cf43i,ppface12,3,Wed Jul 8 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"It really comes down to how important it is for you to have ATC on a predictable basis, as well as a realistic experience in terms of changing frequencies and procedural fidelity.  Also, regarding text, there's nothing stopping us from supporting text from a technical standpoint, but since that absolutely isn't how actual ATC works in the real world (until datalink completely replaces voice), a decision was made not to support it. The vast majority of people who elect to use text when flying online are doing so out of fear or convenience, not out of necessity. This is why PE is a voice-only network. When flying an end to end flight with text-only becomes an option in the real world, we'll follow suit on PE."
flightsim,3cf43i,coma24,2,Wed Jul 8 20:04:11 2015 UTC,"I can tell you im not getting paid to push PE (i wish i was). but in all honesty. its a world of a difference. On PE i feel almost like im flying the real thing again. versus on VATSIM im very aware im sitting in front of a computer.  As for the fact that no PE does not support Text. keep in mind what PE is for. its for IRL training. Although they do let us sim users in (thanks for that). IRL traning is the main focus, you just cant get that from VATSIM. i use to fly VATSIM every flight. until i learned to fly IRL. i had to un-learn a lot of things.  that being said i still fine VATSIM a fun place. even though i question their leadership sometimes."
flightsim,3cf43i,Desparoto,3,Wed Jul 8 06:32:07 2015 UTC,"but i feel like a lot of these people who really push PE and then say vatsim isnt as good are getting paid to do so.   The CEO of PilotEdge is on Reddit quite a bit, so he'll likely confirm, but I would bet you seven billion dollars that no-one is getting paid to push PE to casual customers.  There's just not enough ROI to bother pitching to anything other than commercial or government contracts.  To answer your question about text atc service, PE definitely does not support it."

Did that a few times and finally just tried myself at an empty-but-controlled airport. I did PM the controller that it was my first time.   I made some mistake but he was happy correcting me and to see me fly out.  Hope that helps."

To my mind, Matt Davies is much more a 'community' creator. Froogle is much closer to the dev side of things. Though this gives him quicker and sometimes exclusive access, from lessons I have learned from ""regular"" video games over the years, the closeness of those relationships means I don't tend to pay as much attention to actual reviews he does. I don't believe you can work closely with someone and completely objectively review their product. Your natural inclination to preserve a good relationship means you are less likely to truly vent anger or frustrations at that product, or even the developer as a whole, that you might feel if you were 'only' a consumer - its only human.   His tutorial content and willingness to engage are all great though."

flightsim,3cbxf1,TheRealWireline,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:45:18 2015 UTC,"I built a machine really similar to these and feel that you can do this for a little less money....maybe 10-20% less if prices in RAM, SSDs and other components keep dropping like they have been."
flightsim,3cbxf1,Reapercore,0,Wed Jul 8 00:06:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, these look great. I built my computer in 2011, and although it's still running well I think it may be time for an upgrade. Has anyone had any experience with Chillblast before? Also, are there any real advantages to running FSX with an i7 instead of an i5? I've got my eye on the Fusion Stratus- when they say it's overclocked to 4.3 does that mean it'll come running at 4.3 or do they mean it's capable of being overclocked to 4.3?"
flightsim,3cbxf1,TheRealWireline,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:00:09 2015 UTC,No advantage to getting the i7 over the i5 if you're just gaming and playing flight sim
flightsim,3cbxf1,Reapercore,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:31:09 2015 UTC,"Debatable. The 4790K's overclock generally tops out higher than the 4690K. Following forum threads on recent retail versions of those chips, most people were seeing 4.3GHz on the i5 and 4.8Ghz on the i7 (we are talking easy overclocks, not leaderboard type stuff). Half a gigahetrz is not insignificant for flight sim. If you do not intend to overclock then again you are giving up half a gigahertz on stock clocks. If you intend to run a lot of complex aircraft addons and high quality scenery, you will want every last bit of juice you can get. If you want to use it for anything besides simming, the i7 also has hyperthreading where the i5 does not.  Retail differences seem to be from £30-£80 more for the i7 which to my mind doesn't seem a massive financial jump for what you get, but everyone's tastes are different."

flightsim,3ceyq1,PinkBalloons,2,Tue Jul 7 13:00:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there seems to be alot of false hope out there at the moment.  Dovetail is unlikely to ever produce anything of note, and certainly not  anything within the next year or two.  x64 is pretty much the same, it'll prolly be at least a year before LM converts to x64, and then years after that before the addon developers convert."

flightsim,3ceyq1,Peacerock,2,Tue Jul 7 14:44:29 2015 UTC,Hence why I asked if there was an update. Apologies I was quite confused
flightsim,3ceyq1,nomofica,2,Tue Jul 7 14:54:10 2015 UTC,Microsoft is not going to make another FS. They have sold their licences to LM and Dovetail. I read somewhere longtime ago the reason Microsoft made FS series was because of Bill Gates. If I remember correctly he was the main supporter of the Flight Sim series. Since he left his successors have killed the Flight Sim series that Microsoft made.
flightsim,3ceyq1,Foofski,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:17:41 2015 UTC,Microsoft has not sold anything. They still own ESP outright. They simply granted LM and Dovetail licenses to use the engine in their software.

flightsim,3cdisu,-3Green-,4,Tue Jul 7 01:51:30 2015 UTC,"Hello there. As a long suffering consumer of YT aviation vids, I feel qualified to offer some suggestions :D  Have a vague script you are going to follow, and do your research. Especially if its a tutorial, make sure it just flows together. Nothing more likely to put you off than loads of ""uhhhhhhh I THINK its that switch, urm RUMFLUMFL BANG lemme uhhhhhh just see here * massive long pause then comes back to PC and gets too close to mike, OK SO YEAH ITS THAT ONE (deafening)"". If you have a cold or hayfever then just don't record. Get a decent mike.   Its likely at first you will be nervous and will probably sound quiet or like you are eating your own tongue as you speak, so don't be afraid to edit. Also on the editing topic, Matt has the right idea of just showing take off, cruise and landing with the interspersing montage. There are people who will watch a 4 hour flight, but you will either put a lot of people off if they see the vid is 4:34:15 or they will just skip about.  Also, something for later, a good brand identity really helps when it comes to catching interest and securing repeat views. Matt Davies has some great branding, and also check out Jeff Favignano and the way he uses fonts, graphics and rich thumbnails, though maybe don't use his approach of sometimes using a real picture - only use thumbs from the actual content or you will piss a lot of folks off as they often will click the picture FOR that picture - and expect to see it at some point.  Whether to go screen-in-screen and put your face in is debatable. I find it tends to add more gravitas when its just the voice over the movie, though it works with lets-players because they can ""emote"" -_-  EDIT: Keep TrackIR use to a minimum and use a gentle setting. A lot of people get nauseated from excessive TIR movement and its distracting.   If you have ATC, like pilotedge or vatsim, keep the volume of the operator to a minimum - listening to competing voices is among the most irritating things EVER to come up in sim vids. Its fine for auto ATC like FSX as it rarely comes up and they have generally quite sexy voiced people doing the reading ;)"
flightsim,3cdisu,TheRealWireline,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:57:22 2015 UTC,"This is some incredible advice, thank you so much!   I plan to do point-to-point flying, no tutorials. I'm nowhere nearly knowledgable enough to pull off a tutorial! I'll be doing things like overlaying charts to make it easier for the viewer to follow along.   I've already recorded my first video. Will be doing the editing and such over the weekend. I've done UAL1916 from Denver to Vancouver.   I recorded my voice and the in-sim sounds separately, so I should be able to adjust the levels to have a consistent volume throughout, and also boost or reduce the volume of my voice as required. I checked the mic quality, it sounds very clear and pretty good. I probably need a pop-filter if I continue making videos, though.   I've decided to go the Matt way and will be doing the pre-flight, take off, and then a cruise montage, followed by planning the decent and then a cut to the interesting parts of the arrival.   I don't have TIR, but I do have EZDok, so hopefully everything is dandy.   Will be doing a VATSIM flight at some point, but not yet. I need to be comfortable recording first.   Again, thank you so much for your input. It was extremely valuable to me."

I know FSX/P3D can't use more than 4, but W7 seemingly reserving 4GB for itself leaves just 4GB. Having other applications FSX related running in the same time can quickly lead to an OOM. Having 12GB does really help in that case."

flightsim,3c9jda,jacenborne,24,Mon Jul 6 03:51:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should PM this but I advise you KEEP your flight sim gear. Aviation is a tricky world. I'm stoked about your progress and super stoked your getting your PPL - there is nothing quite like that first time. The job world of aviation is BRUTAL. During my time in flight school there is a constant running joke about how there is no money to be found.  Personally the best option for a single hardworking guy (by single I mean, not married with kids and a mortgage)  Look into fractional ownership - perhaps work on a CPL slowly for the added experience and persicsion but only pursue IFR if your dead set on going commercial(ask around, it's a brutal industry) or if your super rich and can buy some nice fancy twin and go IFR cross country. .  .  .  .  Not trying to take the wind out of your sails but once you get a real real scope of the cost, you may want your flight sim at home for when your funds need to recover between overhauls, rental time, insurance costs, hanger costs, medicals, currency checkups with instuctors (every 90 days :P) .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Fun options to consider after you finish your PPL (and I know your gonna fuckin nail it)  .  . Float Rating: Will probally never use it again beyond those lesson but boy they are a hell of ride! And if you ever need to ditch, you'll have had a smidgen of experience of landing on water. .  .  . Tailwheel endorsement: Learn to fly like a man  .  .  Aerobatic Endorcement: Again, may never use it again (where ya gonne get an $$aerobatic rated$$ airplane?) BUT the flight schools that offer that course offer it in two seater training aerobatic planes. Again.....once in lifetime kinda stuff.  .  .  .  Glider endorcement: Another amazing experience, really helps give you confidence in engine out scenerios because.....well, its a glider. It's also flying zen but that could be its own subreddit.  .  .  .  .  and one final note.  .  Slow down. You only get to do your PPL once, it's a very special time in your life. Everyone one of these flights will become a part of who you are. After your PPL set a new goal. Slowly work your way up. I'm guessing your not rich because your selling your sweet setup. This is one of the most fulfilling paths in your life. Enjoy it. I'll finsh with the obvious but lame joke. Most things in life are like your first time having sex, it's awekward, amazing, short lived, pathetic and yet every time after that it just lose's that magic just a tiny bit more. Go slow, learn the sky, respect it for you shall never master it."
flightsim,3c9jda,windseeker242,8,Mon Jul 6 06:07:04 2015 UTC,"Great comment. I think that spending $10k for a PPL is not the end of the story; if you really want to be a safe pilot you should keep flying at least every 2 weeks, and this is getting very expensive to call it a hobby. Too much for a hardworking guy."
flightsim,3c9jda,jordy22,2,Mon Jul 6 06:26:36 2015 UTC,"Which is why I had to ultimately be realistic.  Yes I could complete my PPL, and yes I could rent a plane and fly around, but could I do it frequently enough to keep everything running smoothly and be safe, 100% of the time?  Probably not.  Once a month isn't enough."
flightsim,3c9jda,Praetor80,2,Mon Jul 6 13:15:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the safety concerns. As mentioned above, there are some opportunities coming my way that will enable me to fly much more, potentially even enable me to eventually purchase my own plane. For now, I make enough to afford a few flights a month, whether that's enough or not, I'm not sure."
flightsim,3c9jda,gsav55,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:17:46 2015 UTC,"Getting the PPL is definitely not the end of the story - it's the start :) .

And thank you for the encouragement, I have my nervous thoughts about the checkride but overall I think I can do it :). I have a list of endorsements I want to get afterwards, TW is definitely one of them!  Some notes - I am not looking at getting into the aviation industry. I currently have a job in IT and am not looking at changing from that. As far as cost, there are discussions going on about some job changes that would substantially increase my salary, enabling me to continue flying after procuring the license and potentially even allow me to purchase my own plane.  The issue is that the timeframe for it could be 4-6 months and I don't want all of the training I've done so far to deteriorate. I can afford to fly at least 2 times a month after getting my license on my current salary, so I'm just trying to gather the resources for the final push to get the license. Then when the other elements line up, I'll have a way to continue flying. For now, the priority is to get the license finished.  As far as enjoying the training... I love it :) . It's been an incredible experience.   Thank you again!  EDIT: as far as keeping my simulator gear - I am keeping one yoke and a set of rudder pedals and throttles. This way I can still use the simulator when working on my Instrument rating or when I can't be in the air."

It helped so much.  And as many have said flying will drain your wallet. Having the sim help a bit with keeping you in the flying mind set between real flight, especially for IFR. It's definitely not as good as real flying. But it's a nice backup. :). Good luck"

I posted this question, then I found some sort of solution myself.   I came to think about that I used to have the boxed version of FSX installed so i opened the register and searched for FSX. I found some traces of the old FSX-version so I deleted those.  The next time I started FSX in Steam it thought it was being run for the first time. When I launched a flight my head tracking suddenly worked. I guess that there must have been some collision between the old FSX and FSX:se.   The problem I'm facing now is to reconfigure FSX again, it seems to me like everything was lost. The head tracking was also very erratic, I need to spend some time configuring that as well."

Prepar3d brings a number of improvements to the table which you may find useful. The first and most important for many including myself is better performance and better compatibility. Prepar3d is optimized well for newer OS unlike FSX which is an outdated 32 bit program. This means that you'll see a number of improvements mainly things like no/less OOM (Out of Memory Crashes which are a common sight in FSX, something I personally fucking experienced all the time) and in general less crashing, more stability. As well as the general lack of constant crashing there's the increase in FPS, I'm able to constantly run around 25-30 fps in P3D something I wasn't able to do at all in FSX.  Apart from this there's not many other advantages. P3D does look quite a lot better graphically as well, which means a lot to some people but idgaf really. Finally P3D is a program that's being constantly improved and is constantly getting more add-ons and is being better optimized, unlike FSX of course.   I personally am thinking of checking out X-Plane and you should do some research yourself as it seems like a good option.  TL;DR If you want a more stable program that is also graphically better and is being constantly developed P3D is perfect"

If you have a legacy install of FSX(a boxed version thats still installed on your computer) install the QW 757 to both FSX:SE and reg FSX. Then, use the livery manager to install the liveries. They will be installed into the old FSX folder. Now, just go into the simobjects/airplanes/ whatever 757 variant it installed to and copy and paste the livery folder to your FSX:SE install and edit the aircraft.cfg file to show it."

That doesn't make much sense to me as the only real difference between MS and SE is where the main files are located. Try reinstalling the 757 (they have a download of the latest version on their forums for registered users), ensuring that you install it as an administrator with your antivirus turned off, and be sure that it's active in the Addon Manager within FSX."
flightsim,3c8uvg,N415XJ,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:53:33 2015 UTC,"I reinstalled it, installed the 757 to my steam fsx, ran the installer as an administrator, my antivirus says its good, and ran the repaints manager as admin, and still nothing. the manager is even part of the addon manager. Am I missing a step?"
flightsim,3c8uvg,N415XJ,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:11:02 2015 UTC,"my antivirus says its good   Yeah, I have no doubt that the files associated with it are clean, it's just that sometimes antiviruses can identify false positives while the program is installing and leave out files that may be important. If you didn't try this already (I can't tell if you mean you disabled your AV or just checked the files for viruses), turn it off, turn any windows protections off, turn off everything. Then turn them all back on after installing it, of course.   the manager is even part of the addon manager   Sorry, but I don't know what you mean by this. ""Addon Manager"" is a program put out by FSDreamteam (I think) that the QW757 utilizes for its registration/activation. Here are the steps I would recommend: 1) Uninstall it 2)Restart your computer 3)Make sure that you have the latest version downloaded 4)Turn off everything AV related. Make your computer less protected than a baby in the woods alone in the middle of the night 5)Install the 757 (being sure to run the .exe as an administrator) 6)Turn back on your AVs then restart your computer 6)Go in to FSX, load up any random flight you want (but don't use the 757, use the default trike), then go into ""Addon Manager"" after the flight loads. 7)Find the 757 and either activate it or make sure it is activated 8)close your flight and load up the 757. You don't need to go anywhere with it, just load it up 9)Close FSX and try the QW livery manager (the separate program with all the 757s load info options and such), being sure that you're trying to install a .qwl file you downloaded from the Quality Wings website. If none of that works, I'm truly stumped, and you need to contact QW or go to their forums. I have many liveries installed for FSX:SE, so using it in SE is not your problem. Sorry for the extreme detail, but I don't know how experienced with FSX you are so I wanted to make sure nothing is lost on you.  Finally, if you have pirated the software, it will not work. I'm not accusing you at all, I'm just saying."

I think as long as you have made some effort to solve it yourself, and its not something easily googleable or been answered many times before (like ""recommend me good free aircraft for FSX"" or ""XPlane or P3D?"", which are asked literally every day and could be found with a search), then people will be happy to wade in."

Best one is EAD Basic, Eurocontrol's archive of everything available from every european country, it just requires a free registration.

flightsim,3c5crr,dr_doe,3,Sat Jul 4 23:14:47 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly using A2As Skylane and Comanche...     Consider then, the realism of torque and P-factor. The plane naturally want's to go left. On climb out, you can expect a bit of right rudder will be needed, but if you then roll into a gentile left turn, neutral rudder would actually keep the ball centered. Rudder is not used a ton in well designed modern aircraft, therefore only requiring small amounts of input under most situations.     how much rudder input do one generally use on a coordinated 20° standard turn     So obviously, the only correct answer is ""depends on the aircraft and the airspeed and configuration"" as there really is no simple answer. If you want to feel a massive difference in how much rudder you need, try flying A2A's Piper Cub. That thing takes some skill to keep her coordinated."
flightsim,3c5crr,prometheus5500,3,Sun Jul 5 01:16:09 2015 UTC,"I have a little experience flying 172s, and a low g turn like that does indeed take very little rudder. Much rudder was required for takeoff, slow climbs, and steep (45°, 3g) turns. So this sounds completely reasonable to me. Have other planes required more in the past?"
flightsim,3c5crr,rickyharline,3,Sun Jul 5 01:18:21 2015 UTC,"The amount of rudder you use is proportional to the amount of aileron deflection you're using when you bank into the turn, so the answer is it varies. When you bank into a turn, the outside wing makes more lift than the inside wing, so the outside wing has more induced drag, which yanks the nose to point outside the turn. Once you're in the turn with the ailerons mostly neutral as they would be in a 20 degree bank, the adverse yaw would be pretty marginal. The outside wing is going a little faster than the inside wing, but also the dihedral of the wings adds a little extra AOA to the inside wing too, so not much rudder would be needed. So really, it varies. You need the most rudder when you deflect the ailerons, and all you're looking to do is center the ball. Don't fixate on it too much. It's just like riding a bike, you'll work it out after repetition."
flightsim,3c5crr,fartbox,2,Sun Jul 5 17:19:50 2015 UTC,"thanks for your detailed answer. I assume, due to the lack of g-forces, that this is something which doesn't need that much of attention in a simulator... however if I understand right, I push the rudder pedal more or less at the same time as I start do deflect the ailerons?"
flightsim,3c5crr,fartbox,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you apply it with the ailerons. And sure rudder improves passenger comfort, but I'd still try to fly coordinated in a sim, because you're guna have much more parasite drag and reduced performance when you fly uncoordinated. It's a sim after all, so you wana try and fly fairly legit."

flightsim,3c29xw,Kirillb85,5,Sat Jul 4 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"Helmet mounted displays go way back, there were consumer head tracking HMDs in the '90s that you could get for a few hundred dollars, game support was not that uncommon.  The problem was the displays themselves. The core problem is that you need compact high resolution displays. In the days of CRTs it could be done but it was horrendously expensive. Those '90s consumer HMDs could only handle 320x200 resolution when 1024x768 was becoming the norm.  The rift is more about timing than anything else. Over the last few years smartphones have proliferated. Most of us now are carrying a tiny, low power, high resolution display in our pockets and the sheer scale of their manufacture has made them cheap. We now have what we previously lacked, low cost, high resolution displays. With that in place, working head mounted displays are inevitable."

Display resolutions and more importantly pixel density were not high enough to create a head mounted display that would give a sense of presence. High performance graphics cards are now able to drive these displays at a high enough frame rate to be convincing to the viewer. I don't think Oculus has really done anything insanely innovative, but they realized the technology necessary to make a consumer product was finally available and of course marked that."

On the industrial side the custom image generator hardware may have started out strong but the rapid progress in PC video cards made the PC flight sims look much better than the stuff I've worked with most of my career.  In the past an image generator was built to last 10-15 years.  They were big, expensive, and not easily replaced with new tech.  In the last 10 years the IG manufacturers have moved to PC hardware and are finally catching up to what you guys are accustomed to.  I've never worked on military grade visual systems so I couldn't tell you if those kept up with PC graphics.  I know they were better than the stuff we had access to."

I fly the PMDG planes lots as well and let me tell you...you owe it to your feels to make the switch.   The immersion factor is so much higher than with FSX just due to the lighting and higher framerates alone.
flightsim,3c4g83,malzabin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:07:49 2015 UTC,I would wait. The main reason I bought it were the ones you mentioned performance and stability. Because prepar3d is being actively developed and updated there may be bigger differences between the two sims in the future. Also eventually most addons will hopefully work with p3d. If I was you I would stick with FSX but keep an eye on p3d. The only thing really attractive about p3d right now are the things you mentioned but you already seem to have those sorted.
flightsim,3c4g83,ramokerat,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"I've been using FS for around 4 years, and just switched to P3D v2.5 around two months ago. Let me tell you, it's a beauty.  Let me just begin by comparing performance for you.   On FSX,  using high to ultra settings, I get around 45-50 fps on average on my gaming laptop (Aorus X7). On P3D, using medium to high + shadows, id get around 15-45fps -- most of the impact is from the shadows since you have many new shadow options. If I tone down the settings to match FSX fps, P3D runs waaaay smoother, kind of ruines FSX for you.  As for addons, I use the following:  PMDG 777 + Immersion 777 (FSX and P3D) Aerosoft A320 (FSX and P3D) A2A C182 Skyplane (P3D)  Active Sky Next (FSX and P3D) Rex 4 + Soft Clouds (FSX and P3D) FSPassengers (FSX) OrbX Global (FSX and P3D) EZDok (FSX and P3D)  My personal next step is getting a PC to make my experience amazing.  For you, i'd suggest you consider getting a better device to run P3D on before you make the switch. If you barely get 30fps with ultra settings on FSX, you will not be able to run high settings on P3D (and get decent fps)."

If you are ONLY wanting it for FSX, you could give the Intel Pentium Anniversary Edition a shot. That might sound crazy to many, but its a dual core (FSX doesn't use any more than that without some rather hit-and-miss hacking) and overclocks to ridiculous levels - like 4.8GHz. Its only about £55 so you could get a semi decent LGA1150 mobo, but of course you will need to learn how to overclock it. Here is a suggestion (i.e I just cobbled this together in 2 minutes so please research yourself). Total cost £192:  Water Cooler - refurb. This is a refurbished H100, great performance and costs less than usual part.  Pentium G3258 Anniversary. This thing just oveclocks like you wouldn't believe.  MSI Gaming 1150 Mobo. Just the first LGA1150 mobo amazon came up with, should allow good overclocking but check reviews and to see if there is anything cheaper.  Do you have some semi-decent DDR3 memory to go in it? That might jack the price up if not. Otherwise you are looking for whatever is the best CPU for the socket LGA 775. A quick search throws up this.

flightsim,3c4ct4,TheRealWireline,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:25:57 2015 UTC,"That 180-quid budget is going to be a really hard upper limit on any builds, so I'd suggest that you start by upgrading your currant rig: max out your ram for your motherboard, or push to eight gigs, whichever is lower - 8 gigs looks to cost about 40 pounds, via amazon.co.uk. Then, get a ""new"" last-gen gpu with ~4 gigs of vram - amazon.co.uk has an amd 270x with 4gb of vram for about 160, or an nvidia, if you can stomach team green's disappointingly standards-hostile practices, for a few quid more. It should be noted that those are not the result of detailed searching, merely a 'first-page-of-search-results' first approximation.  That should (A) get you to a basic playable state in terms of basic rendering, and (B) be forward-compatible at such time as you get enough money to build a better rig (mobo, cpu, ssd, psu, hdd, + case). Alternately, do like therealwireline suggests and throw together an overclockable system - CPU is hella important performance-wise, but overclocking can be tricky and risky if you're not careful, so do consider yourself warned."
flightsim,3c4yyx,iradical88,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:58:46 2015 UTC,Sim performance generally comes down to single core speed more than anything else. If your budget can manage the i7-4790k it would be worth it.  You can OC that up into the 4.7-4.8 range quite easily.   Swap the Cooler Master for the Noctus NH15 and that's basically my rig. I'm OC'd to 4.8/1.29v and pretty happy with the results (Prepar3d 2.5).   Edit: derped on the CPU model number. i7-4790k not i7-4690k

flightsim,3c48sq,Electro_Leprochaun,4,Sat Jul 4 16:59:52 2015 UTC,"The QW 757 was their first release, and had several layers of simplification. The ""feel"" of the aircraft, the flight model, and visuals are top notch, while the underlying systems and such leave a lot to be desired for an in-depth simulation. This is OK, their product descriptions match this and emphasize it's a good aircraft for beginners.  Their next release, the BAE 146/Avrojet, is fantastic, and much more in-depth and of much higher quality. There are still some abstractions and simplifications, but not nearly as many, and it's extremely polished and in-depth. If their 737 Classic is anything like this one, which they seem to be based on what we've seen so far, I'll buy them in a heartbeat. I don't know quite enough about the real 787 to know what sort of cool hard-to-program features it might have, but the previews we've seen point to a very good simulation."

flightsim,3c1gc9,peat76,5,Sat Jul 4 00:02:44 2015 UTC,Most full flight Sims go for 10 to 15 million. There are years of development costs that go into making them. It took 60 people in my company an entire year to make just one level D full flight sim.
flightsim,3c1gc9,onethousandshits,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:59:06 2015 UTC,"Aviation grade components in the cockpit, licensing agreements for data packages from various manufacturers - Embraer probably gives the data package for a nominal fee, Honeywell generally wants an expensive subscription for FMS updates.  Support contracts is where a lot of money finds itself in. The motion system itself is pretty expensive, the older systems use big hydraulic systems with pump rooms.  Newer systems use electric motors instead, which are probably expensive due to the requirements.  I bet there is a wall of MAU cards inside that sim - those cards can be swapped in most cases between the simulator and an actual aircraft.  Some of them require being sent back to the manufacturer or a certification centre to verify they are still air worthy.  I think the Navdb card alone is $50k.   The computing power in these simulators is pretty modest nowadays - gone are the days of CAE's crazy ass FPGA graphics cards and now it's all just COTS Nvidia GTX cards.  Projector technology with higher brightness and good contrast is expensive still.  These simulators will use 2-6 projectors depending on their purpose - on average it's 3."

flightsim,3c1l4n,OMGWTFROFLOL,3,Sat Jul 4 06:20:18 2015 UTC,"I picked it up last night because, frankly, I've had very forgettable nights out for more than $15 so it wasn't much of a risk.  Impulse verdict after a ~20 minute test flight and a ~2 hour cross country: definitely worth it at the sale price.  It looks great. Systems modeling isn't extraordinarily detailed but it's still a couple steps above stock FSX/P3D. Sound set is decent but that can be corrected/improved with some tinkering. The only thing I really wonder about is the flight model: on one hand, it seems a bit too forgiving (maybe my impressions of the early Learjets were inaccurate--apparently, a lot of the early accidents were caused by GA pilots who were inexperienced with jets). On the other, it'll climb at over 6000 fpm off the ground and then hold it for a good while with a gross weight approaching MTOW. I know the real thing can supposedly do this, but it's shocking in practice when you're used to well modeled heavy iron and GA turboprops. The spoilers also seem far too effective, but for all I know that isn't too far off from reality, either.  Anyhow, for $15, it's a good choice and for P3D you really have no other options, anyhow."

In this diary I'd like to tell you about how we're changing the Campaign in the nearest future.  We've been thinking a lot about improving this game mode and making it more like the campaign you wish to have. We are 100% aware about all drawbacks and weeks spots of what we have right now (including fictional awards that annoy some of you too). But trust me when I tell you that with the time limits and budgeting that we had for our project we've chosen the best opportunity possible. And now, a year after release we're going to answer the question if anything can be done to make the campaign better.  A whole lot of ideas have been considered including those gathered on the forum (oh yeah, all that feedback doesn't just vanish in the cold dark catacombs deep below 1C's office, as some of you believe). Unfortunately, we've always been under the pressure of limited resources - primarily human and time resources that we can use for this or that development task. I believe you've read about it many times in the past in devs' answers to community's questions. But I had to mention it again because it's important.  Among the ideas that were abandoned there was old IL-2 static missions. I understand that it could sound really disappointing to some pilots but such missions would be an impossible task for the team. The significantly more complex editor and massive briefing texts that need to be translated properly into several languages make creation of 2 campaign with at least 20 missions each a really big problem. Speaking of time, we'd need up to 10 months for that. But as always you need them ""yesterday"", and new content for BOS is in works, and BOM is scheduled for release next year...  As a result, we've approved a quite interesting idea but first things first.  As you know, we'll be releasing a major addon to Battle of Stalingrad this fall. It will feature new summer and autumn seasonal maps and a new single player campaign that will tell the history of military operations and battles from late August till mid November, 1942. And before you start asking - yes, the campaign starts at noon on August 23rd when the city had already suffered from Luftwaffe's massive bomb raids. Why are we not starting Chapter I in July 1942? Well, you already know the answer: we don't have enough resources to build a copy if the city with undamaged buildings within the time limits.  Alright, beck to the campaign. It will consist of three chapters and will inherit the general structure of the campaign that we have now (and that was completed entirely by so many of you). However this time we have a chance to experiment and try new things. And since the addon is going to be released quite soon, we'll have enough time to get your feedback, examine it, and make necessary corrections it our plans for the bigger campaign in BOM.  This long prolog was needed to explain the situation we're in and give you an idea why this or that decision is being made.  Well, here's what comes to the game with the major update in Fall, 2015:  1) The video cutscenes will be different. In fact, all key events of the Battle of Stalingrad were shown in short videos that come with the vanilla campaign. There's not much sense in showing the same events again. Also the time limits doesn't allow us to give full and comprehensive backgrounds for tactical steps of both armies. So we decided to let the numerous films and books do the educating part. This time our video cutscenes will be telling history with some more art and emotional approach in them.  2) Difficulty levels will be tweaked for both new and old campaigns. Of course, it doesn't involve the CFS veterans or those who's level-capped already, but it should really help the rookies. The curve will be less steep: enemies' numbers and mastery, AAA's precision and reaction speed, gunners' accuracy, etc.. We expect that to make campaign easier which is good because we'd like to show all of you those new targets, like Volga fleet's gun boats and others.  3) And the last but the most important feature - changes in the very mode's structure. Since we don't have resources for a big static campaign, we've approved an idea to borrow separate elements of it and add career missions to every chapter.  Here's how it'll work. In the beginning you'll be offered 1 mission per side that you'll have to complete to advance further. Of course, we are not making the campaign more difficult with this. Completing career missions will not be a problem.  These missions will have long briefings telling the unique stories, and special hand-made mission scenarios. Writing these stories I attempted to deliver a gradual change of mood and spirit of both pilots as the battle evolves. As for Luftwaffe it was the feeling of absolute domination and even a bit of despise to the enemy which are being replaced with annoyance caused by lingering attack on Stalingrad. As for the Soviet pilot it was pessimistic and partly panic state of mind caused by tragic events that happened by the end of summer, but still a phantom hope to overcome all odds appears by late October 1942.  As a result, with this new campaign you're getting 6 career missions. In theory we'll be able to increase their numbers in future letting you play them in each newly opened chapter. This time everything depends on your feedback about this feature. Meanwhile it's just an experiment that we (not without risk, BTW) can afford.  So let's wait for the autumn to finally try the new stuff! By that time we sure will be working hard to make it happen. See you!  P.S.: we've practically finished work on the summer map."

flightsim,3c10d0,-3Green-,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:01:44 2015 UTC,Do you know if you can install and activiate the same addon in both FSX and P3D on the same pc? I tried last night and had some issues with some of the building not loading (and I did install the VC++ 2013).
flightsim,3c10d0,acamp04,2,Sun Jul 5 19:05:58 2015 UTC,"AFAIK it shouldn't be much of a problem. I vaguely remember doing the same when I was in transition from FSX to P3D.   Did you install the standalone addon manager, w/ your anti-virus turned off?"

It seemed to be something with simconnect and Active Sky Next.  I sometimes would start ASN after P3D (I know that's kinda a no-no) and hadn't ever seen any issues, however simconnect would conflict with the scenery if it wasn't loaded prior to the simulator. It all works now though! Lesson learned: Always start ASN before FSX/P3D."

As someone else mentioned, there is a free trial, so try it out and decide for yourself."
flightsim,3c0ys0,emptycup3,3,Fri Jul 3 19:36:40 2015 UTC,"Not sure about Xplane, but in FSX, if you set a flight plan to a certain altitude, then load the flight, ATC will give the altitudes you planned."
flightsim,3c0ys0,prometheus5500,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:23:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Ive been setting my planned altitude at about 2000'. XP10 ATC insists on sending me up to 3-6000 for vectors to the field.   Good thought, Ill try seting my planned altitude down to 1200' and see if anything changes."
flightsim,3c0ys0,prometheus5500,2,Fri Jul 3 21:58:48 2015 UTC,"Well, fyi, for GA aircraft, those are very reasonable altitudes. When flying IFR, even on a short hop, it's not unheard of going up to 6000 feet... and I mean a SHORT hop."
flightsim,3c0ys0,prometheus5500,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:39:35 2015 UTC,Thanks. I wasnt aware of this.. Figured ATC would keep small aircraft below 2 or 3000 feet.
flightsim,3c0ys0,SinisterDexterity,2,Mon Jul 6 15:57:22 2015 UTC,"A handy guide to minimum altitudes. And then as for how high GA will go? Oxygen requirements kick in at 12,500. So you can only go above 12,500 (for more than 30 minutes) if you've got bottled O2 or a pressurized cabin. The final altitude limit is 18,000 feet, where class A airspace begins, and all pilots must be IFR rated and on an IFR flight plan (no VFR above 17,999).    So as you can see, 2,000 AGL is pretty much a minimum for a cruise (not legally, but it's a very reasonably bottom line. Altitude is life!), while 12,500 is a max (unless you've got Oxygen). 4,000-10,000 is where most GA aircraft cruise.    By the way, the Magnetic Course cruising altitudes take affect above 3,000 feet (making 3,000 feet the first official IFR cruising altitude, and 3,500 feet the first official VFR cruising altitude.). These altitudes are to help separate traffic. The ""+500"" for VFR helps keep VFR and IFR traffic separated, while using even/odd thousands for different magnetic headings helps keep traffic headed in opposite directions separated.    If you've got any questions, feel free to ask. I clearly enjoy the stuff! Cheers."

flightsim,3byq6o,UltimatePorkMan,26,Fri Jul 3 06:25:26 2015 UTC,"I, like many other users have been frustrated with many of the choices the Reddit admins have been making as of late. The firing of Victoria seems to be yet another misstep. I'm not sure if going dark will make much of a difference for such a small niche subreddit as ours- but I'm not opposed to it if we see a significant amount of support from the community. So- weigh in peeps, if enough of you are in favor we'll do it."
flightsim,3byq6o,VerboseAnalyst,10,Fri Jul 3 06:56:25 2015 UTC,10k does make this a fairly large niche subreddit (vs some of the other niches I visit). Though I don't think the smaller subreddits need to bother going dark to throw support into the ring on this one.  If anything I'd suggest a 1 hour blackout so as to increase the # of total subreddits that had a blackout over the course of the entire event by 1. That's a data value people are likely to drum up.  Aside from that keep the business open and voice frustration along proper channels.
flightsim,3byq6o,cooperwey,7,Fri Jul 3 07:23:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think it will make very much of a difference, but I also don't think it would affect this subreddit that much of it were to be made private. It would kinda just be another line of text on the massive list of private subreddits."

I myself would be annoyed by this subreddit going dark as I am with others however I also understand why it happens.     Going dark (striking) is supposed to be an inconvinience, it is supposed to draw attention to something that would otherwise be ignored, and by doing so it forces admins and management to stand up and open dialogue to fix the issues which until now was not happening.     Sure, this sub may only have a small number included but it also adds to the masses.

flightsim,3bzvbw,Falcon__Hunter,2,Fri Jul 3 14:28:24 2015 UTC,"It depends an awful lot on what things you are looking for in your flight sim.  P3D2 has the larger range of addons available. However, they can be expensive (especially when purchased from companies that want to price gouge their P3D2 customers). P3D2 is also still afflicted by the 32bit VAS limit that FSX has.... in other words once you load it down with addons expect lots of OOMs.  XP10 has far fewer addons available, but you can get it looking absolutely amazing without spending anywhere near as much as you would on P3D2. It's also 64bit so can use as much memory as your system has available. I'm also going to say it runs a hell of a lot better than FSX and P3D2.  Under the hood I think XP10 is definitely the superior platform, but it currently lacks a decent weather engine, ATC and AI options. P3D2 however, has inherited the huge FSX addon ecosystem and benefits hugely from it compared to XP's much smaller ecosystem."

Just out of curiosity, what is oom?  It seems like it might jusy be a case of flipping a coin between x plane and p3d. I can't see a clear choice.  I mean I love having ai, atc, mp and decent weather. But also since I'm a 15 year old with no source of income, I like the sound of xplane being cheap.

You'll want the HD Mesh V3 (freeware), W2XP sceneries (freeware), and some of the Carenado and Alabeo stuff (the XP versions are much nicer than their FSX/P3D counterparts). Also check out the SMS DHC-2 and RWDesigns DHC-6, the VFlyte PA-28 and the X-Aviation MU-2 and even the DC-3 if that's your sort of thing.  To get a similar setup in P3D you'll need to spend a lot more with a very high liklihood of getting OOM errors once you've got it all set up.  If you've got the inclination, time and hard drive space you can also get into G2XP (donationware) which lets you create your own photoscenery... combine it with the W2XP scenery and you've got some awesome scenery that will keep you busy exploring for a long time."

If you go with X-Plane then take a look at Carenado's planes. They make planes for both X-Plane and FSX/P3D but the flight modeling in their X-Plane addons seems better.

flightsim,3bzrim,kevlarfairy,5,Fri Jul 3 13:53:27 2015 UTC,"XPlane can be great but for me its P3D all the way. Maybe once the addon scene gets a real head of steam up, and begins to give FSX / P3D a run for its money, I might fully jump ship."
flightsim,3bzrim,Wirel1ne,3,Fri Jul 3 15:23:21 2015 UTC,"Xplane has a UI that isn't the friendliest.  Or, it could be that we're all just used to FSX/P3d.   Your computer probably isn't as good as you think it is for flight sims, but you can buy FSX on Steam or better yet, P3d at http://www.prepar3d.com/ and give it a go.  BOTH sims in their default states are not the best.  You'll need addons.  Both have quality addons like the SM Beaver and FlightFactor 777 for XP10, and PMDG/Majestic for FSX/P3d, but XP10 has, by far, a larger database of high quality FREE addons, especially in the scenery dept.  If you're new to this, it's going to be like drinking through a firehose, so ask lots of questions."
flightsim,3bzrim,Praetor80,2,Fri Jul 3 14:06:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this isn't the type of sub that has to be sold. It's something you're interested in, or it's not.  A good, inexpensive sim is Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition. You really can't go wrong with it if you're just getting started in flight sims."

flightsim,3bzrim,kirreen,4,Fri Jul 3 17:43:49 2015 UTC,Xplane 10. Try the demo.
flightsim,3bzrim,realskudd,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:00:32 2015 UTC,"FSX, and it's more mature fork Prepar3d have great add-ons, but the add-ons are often very expensive. With enough add-ons, the simulators can look stunning. The simulators tend to be somewhat prone to crashing and hard to optimize, so prepare to spend a lot of time fiddling with conflicting add-ons and configurations. FSX has missions, though, which are great fun. Both Lockheed Marting (Prepar3D) and Dovetail (FSX) work on improving the simulator, but progress is slow, and updates usually cost money.  X-Plane is less popular, so there are fewer add-ons available. But, many great add-ons are free, and the community is expanding quickly, and is very friendly. X-Plane is actively developed, with a big focus on community involvement and extensibility. I find the simulator to be much more stable and reliable than FSX, and much easier to debug if things go wrong.  I spent years, and thousands of dollars on FSX, then Prepar3d, and enjoyed it greatly. But at the end of the day, it was a glitchy, error-prone mess, that never worked quite right for me. X-Plane on the other hand may not look as pretty, but it put the fun back into flight simulation for me. Mere hundreds of dollars bought me a simulator that I enjoy immensely, and that I trust enough to actually dive deep into aircraft systems and procedures, instead of spending most of my time fiddling with settings and add-ons.  I would recommend buying X-Plane, and a third-party aircraft or two, then download some free scenery from SimHeaven and X-Plane.org, and have fun! Also, maybe you find FSX in a bargain bin somewhere, and install it with no add-ons just for the missions."
flightsim,3bzrim,bastibe,2,Fri Jul 3 14:30:33 2015 UTC,So is Prepar3d an add on on of FSX or it's own thing?
flightsim,3bzrim,ghb93,3,Fri Jul 3 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"Prepar3D is a separate product. Short version:    Microsoft sold their simulation framework for FS to Lockheed Martin for use in commercial simulators.  Lockheed Martin sells their ""training product"" to anyone that wants it and nearly all add-on creators for FSX now offer P3D options (many times you pay one price and can install your new stuff to either sim, but not with the 'boutique' developers) P3D has brought the framework into the present day with DX11 support (FSX was DX9), more GPU optimization, etc. Microsoft then sold the FS name/entertainment simulator to Dovetail who was only allowed to make some tweaks to the sim, but not totally overhaul it like LM bought the right to (or something). Dovetail now sell FSX: Steam Edition (on Steam, obviously) which supports most FSX add-ons, but with more stability (though minimal performance increase) over the original FSX."
flightsim,3bzrim,Brethon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"Very informative reply, many thanks."
flightsim,3bzrim,ghb93,2,Fri Jul 3 15:54:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, you have written so much wrong information:   FSX, and it's more mature fork Prepar3d have great add-ons, but the add-ons are often very expensive.    There are a lot of expensive options, but you also have amazing freeware mesh, REX costs the same for both sim families (XP & FSX/P3D), there's payware scenery regions of similar cost and quality (ORBX PNW is $25USD, Inside Passage for XP10 is $25USD).    The simulators tend to be somewhat prone to crashing and hard to optimize    No, P3D is not prone to crashes, nor is FSX:SE. They are also both very well optimized ""out-of-the-box"" for your average user. Most complicated I've ever seen ""optimizing"" is adding (copy & paste) a couple lines to your .cfg  Original FSX is a wreck, but it's also fairly irrelevant now when considering purchasing a sim.    Both Lockheed Marting (Prepar3D) and Dovetail (FSX) work on improving the simulator, but progress is slow, and updates usually cost money    P3D has had a single version change (from v1.x to v2.x) that cost money in 4.5-years of active development. FSX:SE has yet to charge for any update. And 8 updates (v1.0-1.4 and v2.0-2.5) for P3D hardly seems like slow progress - that's basically a major version update every 6mo.   I'm not about to say FSX:SE/P3D is the better option - as far as I'm concerned it is the apogee of personal taste, and you can easily go point-counterpoint all day long discussing the merits of each sim. I do get irked when I see false information going around, though.  To the OP /u/kevlarfairy I say: Get the XP10 demo and try it out (EDIT: I think these videos are quite good to get you started), also keep your eye out for sales of FSX: Steam Edition and you'll be able to give it a test run for ~$5 if XP10 hasn't hooked you in by then. Finally, to dip a toe into P3D you can get a $9.95/mo subscription for one month and try it out before spending $60 to out-right purchase it."
flightsim,3bzrim,Brethon,2,Fri Jul 3 15:33:28 2015 UTC,"Re: crashing:   my P3D never ran entirely stable. I like photo scenery, and photo scenery uses a lot of memory. P3D crashes when it exceeds 3Gb. This happened rarely for me, but enough to be annoying, and take the fun out of long-running missions or FSEconomy.   The thing is: this really depends on the addons you are using. Stock P3D will never exceed 3Gb, but some addons can exceed it quite easily, and it is very difficult to figure out the problematic addon.   Installing and removing addons can also be quite difficult, as the addon installers often overwrite files, and can really only be cleanly uninstalled in the exact reverse order they were installed. If you uninstall one of them out of order you might break later addons... It's a mess, and a quick way to wreck your sim.  In contrast, X-Plane is 64 bit, so the complexity of your scenery is only limited by the amount of memory in your computer. Furthermore, there is an informative log file that usually tells you quite clearly what addon caused a crash. And most importantly, each addon is a simple folder within your X-Plane directory, so removing addons is as simple as deleting or moving that folder.  This is not to say that I didn't have my share of faulty addons in X-Plane. It's just that they were trivial to find and to get rid of, whereas I had to reinstall my P3D every once in a while when the situation got out of hand. And reinstalling a complex P3D setup would always take me eight hours or more. I have not yet reinstalled X-Plane even once, and setting it up on a new computer is as simple as copying the directory over."
flightsim,3bzrim,bastibe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:29:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking the time to expand on the topic - those are all good points for a newcomer to consider. 64 bit is a huge plus for XP over the others.
flightsim,3bzrim,Brethon,2,Fri Jul 3 21:49:22 2015 UTC,"Re: updates:  I bought FSX, FSX:Acceleration, FSX: Steam Edition, Prepar3d 1, and Prepar3d 2. During the same time, I bought X-Plane 10. And I dare say that X-Plane received more updates, bugfixes, and new features during its run than the other family over all those versions.  Also, I never paid for updates for an X-Plane addon, but often for new versions of FSX/Prepar3d addons."
flightsim,3bzrim,bastibe,2,Fri Jul 3 21:35:30 2015 UTC,"To be fair, P3D released in Nov 2010 and XP10 in Nov 2011, which means only FSX:SE and P3D v2 have been charged for in the same lifespan as XP10. I don't argue the expensive history of the MS franchise, but when considering new entrants into the hobby the past is the past.  The quality of those updates, though, I can't give an opinion on. And I 100% agree that there are some money-grubbing third-party developers in the FSX/P3D ecosystem."

FSX is a cheap, fun simulator but is lacking in the present day. P3D and Xplane 10 are both excellent.  DCS and Falcon 4.0 BMS are high end study combat sims, but need a throttle and headtracking to be enjoyed in the fullest."
