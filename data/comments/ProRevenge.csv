Said client was allergic to bleach and they had to call the hospital. They claimed it was a simple cleaning accident and fired one of their janitors. She filled a report anonymously and nothing was done.  Same place, new day, one of another worker's clients began choking. They have very strict rules about whose clients were whose and you never over stepped your boundaries. Roommate watched her begin choking. The coworker was eating lunch at her station and disregarded the client AND roommate trying to get her to help. Said coworker was higher on the food chair than roommate and deliberately ignored her and eventually waved her off before bothering to get up. The client died due to the lack of care.   When roommate tried to file a complaint, said coworker managed to record 3 of roommate's clients having fall injuries immediately following roommate going home from her shift, causing her to be investigated.

I used to work in the parts warehouse for a local bus garage/industrial truck garage. the conditions were horrible. The roof leaked like a sift. Everything was rusted to shit. Half the parts that were left were in horrible condition. I was expected to dead-lift toolboxes onto shelves three to four feet above my head without a back brace and the ladder I had was rickety and held together with duct tape. So after multiple complaints about doing a job that should have easily been two or three. I called OSHA. They came in, interviewed me. Looked around the warehouse and what I had to do to get by and it ended up costing the company thousands of dollars in fines and forced repairs they wouldn't have done otherwise.

The owner deduced pretty quickly that it was him, and he was fired within the week.  About a week later, the same OSHA rep came in to see how conditions had changed and talk to the employees (really, just to talk to my buddy). When the rep asked where he was, one of the workers informed the rep that my buddy had been fired for calling OSHA (which is generally considered ""wrongful termination"").  This ultimately resulted in my buddy receiving some decent monetary compensation, and the offer for his job back (which he declined, as he had just found a new, better, higher-paying job in the same line of work only two miles down the road)."

Lots of nurses were terrified of being the person to call and then be outed somehow to their superiors, which would either fire them or make their time at the hospital absolutely miserable. When you have to spend 12+ hours at work for 6-7 days a week you tend to want to make as few enemies as possible.   Hospitals do not want to be fined. Thy don't want their reputation ruined. And most of them only care about profits.   I can't speak for other nurses, but Mom loves her patients. Even the ones that are rude and difficult to manage. She comes home crying when she can't help to save someone. She has risked her job and license many times and gone against a doctors instructions when it is in the best interest of her patients.    Mom has never told anyone that she was the person to call them over that surgery, not  even her best friend (who also quit and was hired at the same new hospital that my mom was). She is afraid word will get out and she will be turned down from other potential jobs for being a whistleblower.

Sometimes they would give orders that were unnecessary or not the best solution for the health of a patient.   She was aware that they would have trouble adjusting and was trying to give them a proper chance to learn. Had she reported them at this stage, she would have lost her job for nothing as they could use the ""I'm new to this"" excuse to get off the charges. Hence, why she tried this tactic:   Mom - being so respected - would often times coax the doctors into changing their orders to something more suitable as she has a lot of real work-experience.   But then, some doctors would disagree and tell the nurses to go on ahead with his instruction.    She can't do much about that if she's not there to hear the orders.   Then, when something goes wrong the blame would go on Mom and there was really nothing she could do about it.   They've basically used this procedure to make her look incompetent, so it would most likely be her word: a woman with a record of errors vs. new doctors with fresh training.  She finally had enough when a doctor ordered a heart catheter on a patient who was extremely drunk and in no state of mind to make decisions for himself. My mom tried everything to get the doctor to not go through with it because the man really didn't need to have a heart catheter at all!   This doctor was all the time ordering ridiculous treatments for patients because that is how he makes his money.

Some things that seem important to you may not be as big a deal in the eyes of the accreditation organization.   I would say that while some important things are reported they go on a back-log of sorts  until other issues that take precedence over said reports are dealt with but I am not for sure."

ProRevenge,3e1orn,koofti,-27,Tue Jul 21 21:35:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going to call bullshit.   Residents are not ""fresh medical school"".   Everything an intern (fresh from medical school), resident, or the chief resident does must go through the attending physician, someone with at least half a decade or more or training and experience.   Unless you have the shittiest of all hospitals there's no way the intern, resident, chief, and attending all fucked up.   If a licensing/accreditation rep. came and found a bunch of funny stuff going on that's different. Many hospitals will be fucked in this sense. Fines are a normal part of business.   I'm 10 months from my MD so I have some insight here. I respect nurses, I do. My brother who is much older than me is a nurse.   That being said, nurses are no where as educated or qualified as doctors. Their degrees can be achieved in 4 years. It's a bachelors degree. Unless your a NP or nurse PhD but those are rare. Your average doctor has 8 years of education plus residency which can extend out an additional 3-8 years.   You should always listen to your nurse but the doctor always makes the final call with a bunch of oversight from other doctors.   I'm sure your mom was a good nurse but she didn't respect her doctors and she did not respect her hospital enough. She disgustingly threw them under the bus. It's hard enough with insurance companies and all the health reform going on to keep a hospital afloat.   Edit: if I didn't make it clear it's totally messed up your mom put the entire hospital in jeopardy. She put everyone's job on the line janitors, nurses, and doctors. Just because she disagreed with a single doctor. If she followed protocol she could have filed a complaint on that single doctor to the hospitals admin."
ProRevenge,3e1orn,Dr_Nikk,9,Tue Jul 21 22:28:24 2015 UTC,"If the hospital didn't have any JC violations, it wouldn't have been an issue for them to do an audit. That is definitely not this nurse's fault.  You can't just do whatever you want because you're a doctor.   Also, doctors aren't infallible.  They can make mistakes"
ProRevenge,3e1orn,koofti,4,Tue Jul 21 10:24:04 2015 UTC,"I downvoted you.  You are claiming op's mom was messed up for reporting unethical behavior from a doctor to the regulatory agency that hospital has contracted with for accreditation.  She didn't ""respect"" those doctors when they were ordering procedures and obtaining signatures from drunk people?  That's medicine for you?  That's OK?  That doctor was acting with zero ethical behavior and was putting the hospital at risk - not the nurse who reported it.  Also, never ever downplay the amount of learning that happens on the job.  Especially with an 8 year veteran who loves her job.  You may not have noticed the nurse in the room while you were making rounds as a resident, being educated by your attending... But the nurse was likely learning something too.  It all adds up.  While it may not be formal, it still counts for her knowledge base."

Clearly patients to you are cash cows and you're likely the type of person to recommend unnecessary surgery to someone unable to consent.   She disgustingly threw them under the bus.

ProRevenge,3e1orn,Dr_Nikk,11,Tue Jul 21 14:13:40 2015 UTC,"""10 months from my MD"" -Dr_Nikk.  Get off your high horse. Seriously. Your average doctor has 8 years of schooling? Let's go ahead and subtract the 4 years you spent getting your irrelevant bio degree. Then while we're at it lets subtract your first two years in med school where you learn stuff you'll never remember, let alone use. And you're left with two years of actual hospital experience. You're a fool if you think an intern knows more than an experienced nurse.  Secondly I find it hard to believe you have any insight into how a hospital is run. Interns and residents often make decisions by themselves everyday. If you are an intern on the floor, and not in the ER, your supervising attending might oversee your actions ONCE in the entire day.  Also, she never said the doctor in question was an intern. Interns don't get paid fee-for-service, they are paid a fix salary. An intern, even a resident, doesn't get paid more if they order unnecessary tests. An attending can. Are there dirtbag doctors? Yes. Are there good doctors? Yes. Stop acting like all doctors are saints. They're humans."

She can also attest to the fact that there are some things that college just does not teach you about working in the healthcare field. How could they when there are so many ways a person's health can take a nosedive to?

And 90% of us regret starting, the other 10% still find it enjoyable but know they should quit.

Someone yells at you? Well that's great, you've been craving something for the last 22 hours and now there's this fucktarded asshole being a cunt fuck that guy!

Hell, a friend of mine didn't know she was pregnant for about 6 months (she has lupus and the symptoms of lupus are similar to those of pregnancy) and smoked, drank, and got stoned regularly. Her baby is fine, a year old (coming up on the 25th), smart as hell, and super adorable.

ProRevenge,3ddx85,cyberchief,276,Wed Jul 15 19:34:05 2015 UTC,"Hi there. First time poster, english is not my first language so please be generous with typos and stuffs. Here's my story:   About a year ago I was getting home after long session of “physical activity” with gf. I was pretty tired so the plan was: get ass home, shower, lay on bed forever. Before I get to the point I need to tell you a bit about the place I live in.   I live in an apartment in a building kinda out of town. Building has two gates: a small one for people/bikes and a large one for cars. There are parking lots inside for residents, however we often lament that there is not much room for parking cars inside; just in front of the large gate there is a large area that can be accessed right from the street and is actually part of the property so I have taken the habit of parking my car(a small one) just there on the side of the large gate. This way there is more room for the other residents inside and I don’t need to carry the remote/key for the large gate (which I always lose anyway).   For those that are just passing by it is not really clear that the large area is actually part of the property, so people sometimes park there thinking it is a free space, after we explain the situation people always move without problems but we got tired of this, so we recently put some “no parking” signs inside the area and this stopped happening.   Ok, so I was tired and in need of rest, I get home and I see a big van (some electric implant company) parked right in my spot. I usually don’t get mad at these things but I was tired and the guy parked RIGHT IN FRONT of the “no parking” sign. I cannot park anywhere else since I would block the way in/out of the other residents. So I park in front of the large gate, get out of my car and approach the van. On the passenger seat there is a large lady (2L) and I signed her to open the window. I kindly explained her that this is a private property and she needs to move the van.  2L: but there’s nowhere else to park!!!!   Me: I am sorry but, as I told you, this is a private property and I need to park here.   2L: why can’t you park next to us???   Me: It would block the way of the other residents. (isn’t that obvious????)   2L: Oh, so you live here, then why don’t you park inside???   At this point I would like everyone to notice that there is absolutely no need for me to explain why I can’t park inside. All she needs to know is that she is on private property and needs to go. Anyway I explain the situation and she told me that the electrician (her husband) was making repairs in the building next to mine, and in 5 minutes they were leaving. Now I am a bit pissed because I already know is not going to be 5 min and I would have to go and up and down at least once to move the car, and if someone wanted to get in/out in the meanwhile they would (rightfully) be mad at me.   So I just leave the car there and go to my apartment, thankfully I have a window which let me see just the entrance and can check if they are still there. After 15/20 min they are still there, I need to rest and I am pissed, so I go to confront them.   2L tells me that the guy came back but only to get some new stuffs from the van and needed to do extra repair.   Me: Why didn’t you tell him to move the van?   2L: He said it was only going to take 10 min. (how is this an answer???)   Me: I am not interested in that, you need to move the van!   2L: JUST RELAX!! (I am more pissed now)   Me: Listen, I kindly asked you to move the van, if you don’t I will call the police and have it removed.   2L: Alright alright, I will try to call him, but he probably won’t answer. 2L calls the guy but he won’t aswer the phone.   (2L: see?? See??) Laughing she starts to show me the ringing phone as if this is something that I am supposed to be interested in.   2L: see? He won’t answer!   Me: I don’t care! You need to move the car. Why don’t you tell me where he is? I will tell him!   2L: He is in that building but I don’t know which apartment. (ufff. I can’t ring every apartment just to find the idiot!!). I give a look inside the van and I see that he left the keys there.   Me: hey you have the key there! Why don’t YOU move the van??  2L: AHAHAHAHAH. Are you crazy???? He is gonna be mad!! AHAH   Me: I DON’T CARE! YOU MUST MOVE THE VAN!!!   2L: JUST RELAX!!! I CAN’T DO ANYTHING. JUST WAITH HERE AND TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES BACK!   Now I am really pissed. I don’t say anything and I just start to walk in circles like a shark. After 10 min fat electrician (FE) finally shows up, he is 6’5 tall and at least 420 pounds. I approach him but he starts to shout at me first.   FE: WHAT IS THE PROBLEM????   Me: This is private property. You can’t park here! Move the van!   FE: Why can’t you park inside??? (ARGHHHHHHHHH!)   Me: I just can’t ok? Move the van or I call the police.   FE: you know what? Fine. Call the police.   He ignores me, get some stuffs from the van and went back to his work. Now I could have called the police but I am not sure they would have had the van removed and I might have caused a big fuss for nothing, BUT POLICE OR NOT THOSE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO PAY! REVENGE MODE: ON!!!   I took pictures of their license plate and the name of their company with my phone, then got in my car, move it and parked RIGHT behind them (I was like 1-2 inches from the back of their van)! Stupid FE parked like 2 inches from the “no parking” sign, my car was behind it and a small wall was on their left; the right was free but there’s no way they could have maneuvered out of it. More important: the passage was now free and the residents could go in/out.   I tell doubleL I got their license and datas just in case they were to try damage my car and that I would be back in a couple hours to move the car if I remembered to. I went back to my apartment and turned TV on. After 10 min I hear people screaming at the entrance. I took the interphone and asked what was the problem. FE is crazy angry and wants me to move the car. “Alright, I got it I am coming”, went back to watch TV. Another 10 min pass and more screaming. This time I go.   FE: YOU HAVE TO MOVE THE CAR RIGHT NOW!!   Me: WHY?? This is my property!   FE: YOU CAN’T BLOCK MY WAY! I GOT WORK TO DO!!   Me: Fine. Call the police! (I am not sure the police would have removed his stupid van, but sure as hell they weren’t going to remove MY car from MY property)   At this point FE is really mad and start screaming obscenities. One thing I didn’t notice: He had a lot of large electrical stuffs on the ground (cables and others). But he couldn’t put it back in because his stupid van didn’t have a lateral entrance but only in the back (where my car blocks the way!) Why am I telling this? Because it is starting to rain! All his stupid things could get damaged! I notice he also understand the situation so I say:   Me: Ok, Ok. How about I do you a favor? I will move my car but you will have to pay me! Say 50 €?   FE: ARE YOU FUCKING WITH ME??’   Me: As you wish. You can pay me or call the police and see if they give a shit about you. If you don’t pay I will move the car in a couple more hours.   FE starts screaming more obscenities, get into the van and comes back with MY money. I take MY money and move the car. FE and 2L load their stuffs and leave at full speed. NO ONE SHOULD EVER BE IN MY SPOT!"

I had a similar incident, I went outside at like 8am to find the side of my bumper destroyed, no dashcam. Called the cops, but they literally couldn't do anything except take my info. Confused and angry, I knocked on a bunch of doors, and found this older, ballin' ass neighborhood watch gentleman that just happened to have one security camera that just happened to be pointing exactly where my car was parked across the street. It was a huge stretch, we couldn't make out the license plate, but we saw he was hauling a boat, so I went to every single docking area looking for a dark truck and a slightly damaged boat trailer. At the end of the day I finally found the same looking truck with a trailer, the boat wasn't there, so I backed up behind him and measured the damages CSI Miami style (nah I just used a lame little ruler): put my sunglasses on and screamed when it was a match. Just then and totally unrelated though, two cop cars, a firetruck, and an ambulance show up and pretty much block me in. I'm feeling like batman right then getting in trouble for doing justice, the cops come over like ""dude seriously what are you doing"", so I explain my story and show them the video and the damages. They both just sort of laughed, and one officer said ""you really did it, great job"" and they both just walked away.   The guy who hit me ended up being in town for that day only, drove back to Nevada the same night.

Otherwise you end up with legitimate self defence cases where say a young black man defended himself against a older white man who was well loved in the community. The black man had a string of past violent offences but in this case was 100% legal to use force, well the jury sees this as their chance to put him away and so do so, this is a miscarriage of justice.

This is called ""subrogation"" and is a common element in every car insurance policy I've seen.

ProRevenge,3c8v6h,pstasio,475,Mon Jul 6 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"From /u/seni0r in this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1kbhcn/i_gain_strength_from_their_tears_and_anger/cbnhvxv   This comment will get buried, but it's a story worth telling. In college, my best friend and I had a summer job culling trees from a property 50kms (30miles) from the nearest hospital/ambulance station. We both got the job at the same time and worked there for almost 3 summers in a team of 5 guys. We were all very skilled with equipment and had been through extensive training. Two of the guys on the team were professional arborists. We had all the gear, but as anyone with professional experience with chainsaws will tell you, unpredictable accidents can happen.  On a late August morning we had just finished downing a 30 foot white pine and were in the process of removing the branches. My friend was working his way down the trunk when he hit a knot in an oddly formed branch and the chainsaw kicked and due to the admittedly awkward position he was in sliced into a seam between his chaps and his belt.  The blood started flowing immediately and everyone stopped. While the others stabilized him, I ran to get my car knowing in any case we'd have to drive. While trying to control the bleeding we loaded him into the back seat of my car and I started driving as fast as I could towards the nearest hospital. 10/50kms in we got cell coverage and arranged a place to meet the nearest ambulance. I knew we had to get him in fast as we were having trouble controlling the bleeding. When I reached the 416 I started going faster than I had ever driven before. While in the middle of nowhere most people would see me coming and move to the right lane (slower traffic keeping right), but as we got closer to town we started coming across packs. It was 25/50kms to the hospital that we came across a white Nissan Altima and a Subaru Forester that blocked us in just like the OP likes to do. I can still remember the license plates of those to cars to this day. She was doing everything to ensure I didn't pass. She slowed up down from 90-75km/h (speed limit is 100km/h - ~60mph). We were stuck. It was this way for a solid 10minutes. It wasn't until we got to the next exit ramp that I was able to pass on the inside and get by. By this point most of our clothes had been used to help soak up the blood/applying pressure. Frustrated one of the guys threw a T-shirt that was dripping in blood out the window as we passed and hung out to give them a wave. He, like all of us, was covered in blood. The blood soaked T-shirt landed midway up the hood of the white Altima leaving a streak as it slid/rolled up and over the windshield.  5kms (3 miles down the highway) we were joined by an OPP officer (like a state trooper/highway patrol) who matched our speed and helped to clear the way to the ambulance waiting a further 2 miles down the road. By that point the bleeding had slowed and my friend had a very weak pulse. The ambulance crew was ready and waiting and transferred him within seconds of our arrival. I jumped into the ambulance and we all took off. Sadly the friend died a few minutes later, 1km (<1mile) from the hospital.  My friends were at the side of the road explaining the situation to the police officer when the white Altima showed up. I wasn't there for this part, so I'm going by the stories they told me. Anyways, she stopped and approached the officer in such a way that she couldn't see the blood soaked guys. She was shouting about dangerous driving and going to kill someone, yadda yadda yadda. The officer brought her around to look at the inside of my car which was covered in blood, and then pointed to the other two guys from my crew who were covered in blood from head to toe. He explained there was a medical emergency and asked if what we had said about her impeding the flow of traffic was correct. He cited her for a number of things including unnecessarily slow driving and dangerous driving. While he was writing the ticket he was informed of the death of my friend in the ambulance. The guy stopped writing the ticket to come over and tell the guys what happened. He opted to not tell the lady in the Altima, but the other guys on the team sure let her know.  The guys got in the car and came to meet me at the hospital where we were going to meet with police to explain the situation. On the way they passed the Subaru Forester, which had been stopped by another OPP officer.  Your best bet is to get out of the way if you can. While the driver behind you may just be an asshole, it may also be someone with a medical emergency; a partner in labour, a child having a diabetic attack, or a tree surgeon bleeding to death. In any case, letting them past you doesn't affect you in any way and may save a life. These scenarios aren't likely, but they also aren't impossible. It ultimately comes down to how you decide to process the situation. If you want to operate on the default mode of assuming you're right and everyone else is wrong, you're going to have a terrible time functioning in society. Lines, traffic, call centers, and dealing with big business or government will always seem tedious to you. On the other hand, if you can view the world from a more understanding perspective you'll be able to relax and stop being such a dick. Have a good life!

Not even 100 feet onto it I notice a newer model Cadillac escalade on my ass.  This is a 30mph road and I'm going 40mph.  I have a feeling my actual speed is a mile or two slower than my speedometer reads but still, not going slow and not speeding either ya know?  So this road is relatively straight with ups and downs all along it.  At almost the end there is an S turn that has a pretty decent decline in elevation at the start of it.  It comes on really quick and I knew it.  I was in a mid sized sedan and hit this turn with this person on my ass at a pace I knew would be pushing my car to its limit in handling.  My tires did not squeal though I was surprised they didn't.    I hit that turn at such a speed that I had to really concentrate on where I was going through the turns.  I looked back to see they were half a car length being me at the start of the turn.  When I came out the turns they did as well but now a couple hundred feet behind me.  They stayed at that distance for another 5 miles or so until I turned off.  I reckon they about shit themselves and hopefully learned a lesson."

He didn't know how that woman would have reacted, she could have rammed him, followed them to where the stopped and shot them.    It just isn't the general public's job to make sure other people drive the speed limit. If someone is trying to go faster than you are then just get out of their way if it is safe to do so. If someone is going slower than you and in the passing lane, don't ride their ass just be close enough that they know you are there and want by and wait for an opportunity to pass.

Was waiting behind a car which wanted to turn, there was just enough space to pass on the other side of them without going onto the pavement but I decided not to risk it for the ~5 seconds it would take to wait. Cue one car behind me beeping the horn like mad - so given they were the only car behind me, once the car in front had turned, I decided the 30mph limit was a bit high right at that moment, so proceeded to drive the quarter mile or so to the turn I needed to make at about 10mph. tl;dr: Get impatient with me and I'll make you wait even longer."

Here in Tennessee (laws vary per state) it doesn't matter if you know you are being recorded, or if you don't want to be recorded...  As long as just one person involved in the call is okay with it being recorded then no law has been broken.  Tennessee is not unusual in this respect - there are many single party consent states.

At no point did anyone intend on solving this problem, but to simply keep passing the buck until she went away or to ""trying to fob her off"" as you put it.  I am almost positive that your company was recording her, as is a standard practice with most call centers, but her recording you wasn't allowed...because you were uncomfortable with it.  Then, when it became clear that you and no one else was going to attempt to solve this blatant overcharge, she got angry (after a fucking month!).

She called in intending to manipulate the company into crediting her account far more than necessary. She used an edited phone call to try and do this. I'm guessing this guy is at a lower level so he isn't allowed to make any kind of changes to an account like that. Being unable to resolve that kind of issue without someone higher up being involved he escalates it. I can promise you that 800$ is not something a company would ever allow be credited to an account without a lot of management involvement.  Rather than allowing it to escalate (and be proven that she's lying), she takes the phone call he made with her and manipulates it so he sound's like he agreed to give her the money. When she contacts him again, she's intending to catch him in a position where management will agree with her, apologize and fire him, he calls the bluff, she gets rowdy and that ends.  The reason it went on for a month is because she did no follow up, she intended to get money out of the situation rather than actually deal with it. If most people had actually been screwed for 800$ they would be contacting people religiously, not two weeks later with a hacked up recording.   There tends to be a lot of fraud when it comes to mobile devices. And just a heads up. Call centers tend to record most but not all conversations, and they aren't stored for long."

ProRevenge,3c42px,AndrewV,12,Mon Jul 6 21:06:24 2015 UTC,"I used to work at a call center for Sprint. Learning how to not give a fuck is the only way to stay sane.  On your average day, you will take anywhere between 20 to over 100 calls a day, depending on what shift you get and other factors. Fully half of those will involve somebody who is pissed off in one way or another. Of those, anywhere from 25-50% of them will involve somebody who is pissed off and more than happy to take it out on you. Which means that on average, you will get to deal with anywhere from 1-25 people who are screaming, blaming you personally for their issue, and refusing to let you get a word in edgewise. Every. Day.  To make matters worse, you are expected to follow very strict metrics. You can't transfer more than 20% or so of your calls. You have to finish the entire call and write your notes documenting the call and be back in the queue in under 7 minutes total. Most critically (at least where I was), you have to ensure that you turn those customers literally screaming epithets into your ear into a 95% 4-5 star rating on the customer survey that they may or may not get afterwards.  So imagine that you're in a scenario where somebody is literally screaming bloody murder. You can't fight back. You can't raise your voice. You can't disconnect the call. You can transfer, but you'll get dinged on your metrics and might get yelled at by your boss if it happens too much. You can't even space out and stop listening because of the off chance that their ranting will reveal some random piece of info that lets you fix their entire problem in one fell swoop. All you can do is put on a fake smile (Remember, the customer can hear your smile over the phone!), keep an even voice, stick to the talking points, and slowly watch the clock tick up past the 24 minute mark, knowing in the back of your head that you've taken five other calls like this today and this is going to shoot your average handle time up by 10 seconds on its own and you were already near the borderline and fuck you need this job WHY WON'T YOU SHUT UP  And then before you can get in another word, the customer loudly yells ""FUCK THIS SHIT, I'M CANCELLING"" and hangs up before you can offer a transfer to department that handles it. And just like that, you now get to roll the dice on whether this customer is going to get a survey or not, and there's nothing you can do about it.  And then you write your notes, exit out of their account, and go back into the queue... and now you get to wait. You can't do anything while you wait--you can't read a book, you can't surf the Internet, you can't play games on the computer or a 3DS, you can't pull out your smartphone--all of that's banned because you need to be ready to spring into action at a moment's notice!  And then you hear the beep in your headset, the caller's account populates in your CRM, and you pray this is a nice, simple request you can handle in 3 minutes.  It's really difficult to overstate how insanely stressful call center work is. That cycle of panic and sheer boredom weighs on you like a ton of bricks, and the only thing you're allowed to do to cope is to just... disconnect. Stop giving a fuck, stop caring about providing a good experience, stop caring about anything but meeting the metrics."

You must have missed the part where the woman played an edited version of the previous phone call, made to look like the employee promised stuff they didn't.  (And, in all probability, edited the other call, the one she played during the initial call, as well.)   What would you call that, if not 'lying'??"

That's why this sub is 'pro revenge' and not 'pro justice'.  I mean, it's okay to be upset or angry at a company that you think is charging you unfairly.  It's not okay to lie and alter recordings to try to get employees in trouble.  Try that, and you've made yourself a legitimate target in my opinion.

ProRevenge,3c42px,Fred_Klein,20,Sat Jul 4 19:38:36 2015 UTC,"You seem to be looking at this as ""customer vs. company"" when it really is ""customer vs. OP"". The customer (or her background male companion to be exact) issued a personal threat against OP: ""You’ll be out on the street without a penny to your name, I’ll make sure of it."" I can't fault OP for taking that threat seriously, I know I would if I was in his position.  As for OP being ""shitty"" (I take this to mean that he was not being helpful), I see no evidence of this. OP did his job, he raised a call listening request and a call-back request, which are handled by other departments and therefore are completely out of his control after he has raise the issues. I don't see how the issues not being handled correctly after he raised them could in any way be his fault, seeing as he has no control over those processes. OP was even helpful and acted professionally during the phone call he was forced to take. How exactly was OP being shitty, what more could he possibly do to please the customer apart from lubing up and bending over?  As for balancing the scales, that's exactly what OP did (note the singular here, it was in fact OP and not ""they"" as in OP and the company like you insinuated. The company was in no way involved in this). The customer threatened to take away OP's livelihood which, depending on his financial situation, could even ruin his life. Considering the seriousness of the situation OP's retaliation was, in my opinion, quite mild since there are far, far more nefarious things one can do with someone's personal information.  Please note that I'm expecting a response from you. It seems to me that you're purposefully misreading and twisting OP's story to fit your fantasy of what really happened."
ProRevenge,3c42px,RubTheFrog,9,Sat Jul 4 19:42:04 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm looking at it through the lens of; the one thing OP and this woman seemed to agree on was that there was some overcharging going on (not sure on the honest amounts). Instead of anyone attempting to really handle this in any meaningful way, they ""fob her off""   They could not use the customers recording as proof of what was said, for obvious reasons.  The employee then sent the case over to the team that pulls the actual call records to see what was actually promised.  This is not 'fobbing the customer off' in any way.   And what happened after the case was transferred is in no way this employees fault."
ProRevenge,3c42px,Fred_Klein,19,Sat Jul 4 19:52:09 2015 UTC,"yeah she had a manipulated recording of OP, which leads me to believe that the original recording that she played in the first conversation also was manipulated. which means customer is lying through her teeth."

The problem was they needed to verify that what she said was true (it probably wasn't) and for that someone had to listen to the calls, which OP couldn't do.   I think the reason she asked for OP all those times is because the original conversation wasn't with OP so she couldn't be called out for lying."

ProRevenge,3c42px,ImaginarySpider,11,Sat Jul 4 19:40:47 2015 UTC,"The difference is, OPs company didn't edit the phone calls. This lady did, which means the first phone call ""promising"" an $800 credit was most likely also fake."
ProRevenge,3c42px,TheGirlwThePinkHair,31,Sat Jul 4 19:54:53 2015 UTC,"I am almost positive that your company was recording her, as is a standard practice with most call centers, but her recording you wasn't allowed...because you were uncomfortable with it.   Those are two completely different cases.  Depends on the state but when she is on the line she is told that she will be recorded. If she proceeds then both parties have consented. If she is recording OP without consent then that's illegal depending on local laws."
ProRevenge,3c42px,249ba36000029bbe9749,6,Sat Jul 4 20:02:18 2015 UTC,This woman had been charged essentially double by your company for service. She tried to get it handled by a manager who kept kicking her down the road.   I read that as the customer racked up $800 in roaming/data charges while on vacation in a foreign country.  The charges were legitimate and the customer should have known how her plan worked internationally.     The $400 comes into play as the first line call response has a policy of giving out upto $400 in credit when someone complains about these things.  So hearing about the $800 credit the OP was already suspicious.  As it turns out that suspicion may be justified as she manipulated the 2nd recording.
ProRevenge,3c42px,zerj,2,Sat Jul 4 20:16:01 2015 UTC,You missed the really big part about her altering her recordings so they'd say what she wanted them to say instead of what actually happened. Then she proceeded to play those tapes for the next guy down the line to try and trick people into giving her what she wanted.  While I wouldn't steal her info from a work file and do anything with it like OP I certainly wouldn't be inclined to help her at all after some bs like that.

ProRevenge,3c42px,nobrasnomasters,-1,Mon Jul 6 13:13:27 2015 UTC,"you can have your issues handled without swearing, threatening, manipulating and lying.   I wish that the first two of your list were true. And your second sentence applies equally well the other way round. As a customer I have encountered too many whose attitude boils down to ""ain't my problem, mate, tough."" - in fact, I have just been listening to someone on the radio describing the attitude he got from his airline for shoddy service, and commented that most of the time they give good service, but on the occasions things Do go wrong, they don't give a toss.  Now, Perhaps the people I have encountered are rogue agents who are not doing what is expected of them, but I have encountered enough to make me suspect that they are employed by a department that regards the ""service"" bit of Customer Service as having the same meaning as what a farmer has his bull do to his cows. And I am afraid that the only way to get anything from such people is to make it clear to them that sorting out your problem is going to be less hassle than avoiding doing so. If that involves swearing and threatening, and possibly even manipulating, then, if they have demonstrated that those are the rules they have set for the game, I will take them on.  Of course, there is the other scenario which I have also encountered, which is rather more like the one OP describes: The initial contact makes reasonable promises that another part of the organisation unreasonably fails to keep. My former ISP set a debt collection agency on me after they continued to try to bill me when I had moved out of a flat (and cancelled my service appropriately.) When I got through to customer service (after the obligatory half-hour listening to a worn recording telling me that they were experiencing an unprecedented number of calls) they understood the problem immaediately, acknowledged that it was entirely their fault (and emailed me the same) but when they passed it on to billing to tell them to stop billing me then getting shirty because I had done what they advised me and cancelled my direct debit directly with my bank, they clearly failed to act on it, billed me again, and sent me threatening letters the cost of which they added to my bill. Of course, because my account Had been cancelled, I could no longer log in to customer support online, and it only eventually got sorted because a customer support person broke the rules and gave me his direct email address, and also got his boss involved on my behalf when I forwarded the next threatening letter to him.  But the pieces of shit who caused me so much grief never dared show their faces."

That being said I'm not sure this was the best way to get revenge, I would have threatened them with legal action for recording and manipulating a phone call, even if it wasn't actually against the law they seem dumb enough to have bought it."

In my experience the problem will get resolved and they will go above and beyond to help vs the times I have been passive. One last thing before people downvote me for being a ""shitty"" customer, when I bitch I make sure to emphasize that I am not yelling my frustration directly at the rep for it is not their fault, but more so I will bitch to them about the bs practices their company does and the people who are in a position of power to enforce these practices"

ProRevenge,3c42px,The_R4ke,3,Sat Jul 4 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"I would have threatened them with legal action   That wouldn't have been revenge and could even have been against company policy. Not all call centers have the luxurious policy of being able to hang up with ""our lawyers will contact you"" when a customer threatens legal action. But that's irrelevant because they didn't threaten the company, they went after OP personally. Call centers are hells on earth, they employ people who are in a desperate financial situation and pay them pennies, you think they give a flying fuck about their staff? And if OP works in a call center, do you really think he could afford a court case, even if it's a small one?  Someone threatened to take away OP's livelihood and make no mistake, if anyone has a reason to take such a threat extremely seriously it's someone who's desperate enough to take a low-paying job with practically non-existent worker's rights.  But you are right on one count, the caller and her friend were dumb as hell. It's generally a really bad idea to taunt and issue serious personal threats to someone who knows your name, home address, and phone number. That's practically asking for trouble. In hindsight she got off really easy, OP could've caused much more trouble by posting her personal information to some of the less pleasant corners of the internet."

It can also include falsely stating that a family member of the recipient is injured or dead, or threatening to injure the recipient or a family member. People violating these laws may receive a prison sentence, a fine or both. Maximum fines for first offenses range from $250 to $2,500.

First, people are going to do the bare minimum if you are a jerk. They'll be more inclined to do more if you're nice. But most importantly, the people who answer the phones are just regular people like me, low men on the totem pole just trying to earn a paycheck. They personally had nothing to do with my issues but can resolve them.   Here's an example. By misunderstanding my dad accidentally had the Internet disconnected (not Comcast as will be soon obvious). Because I work second shift I didn't realize that until about 3am.  I called simply to have them reconnect and hopefully to try to get set up for automatic payments.   Had I been a dick, I'm sure the guy who answered would have, despite having not a lot to do (by his admission), probably set me up and connected me and that's it. Instead, for about an hour, he went through all the available new account deals to find the best one for me. See, the Internet was technically under my dad's name, since it was linked to his standing landline account with the same company. He cancelled the landline and ended up cancelling the entire account, including mine.   The guy could have bridged my dad's account and just put it in my name.

The truck always stood out to me - it really harshed with Hilo's mellow, and really did spew out vitriolic messages...way beyond ""I'm expressing my dissenting opinion,"" and more in the realm of ""I want to shock as many people as possible without trying to get this to become an open debate."" I'm actually fairly certain I even have pictures of the placards on that truck: they didn't stand out like a sore thumb - they stood out like an extra foot growing from someone's hand: disconcerting, jarring, and uncomfortably unexpected.   Now, I'm all for freedom of speech too, particularly when it fosters discussion. PM wasn't about that; it really felt like shock value and even overt hatred rather than a mere expression of an alternate viewpoint. I recall a lot of use of really derogatory slang in reference to Obama, for example; in my experience, you don't use that language if you're interested in an open conversation - you're telling people "" screw you, you can't change my mind and you can't change my signs""!

Mohammed married a 5 year old and had sex with her when she was 9. So, calling him a pedophile is perhaps offensive to believers, but nevertheless objectively true.   They realized that all though PM was protected by free speech, the parking spot PM used for his billboard was not.   You could also call the department of motor vehicles and ask them if a billboard mounted on a private vehicle like his constitutes a safety hazard because it could blow off or topple over or hit over-hanging objects such as hanging traffic lights as he is driving. If they say it's a hazard, provide photos and give them his license plate number.  The town could also pass a regulation limiting the amount of time anyone is permitted to park in the spaces next to the park during the day, so he might show up but he could be forced to leave.  The town could also pass a regulation limiting the size of signage within the town... so he would have to reduce the size of his signs to the point that they might not be bothersome any more.

They will try to do their job, but fail and the company has proof that they did not do their job properly and fires them. Alternatively I can choose to make their life very miserable and get them to quit.  Why does the company do it this way? Severance pay.

ProRevenge,3b39ck,xerxerneas,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:56:46 2015 UTC,Well… That is both right and wrong too. It is quite hard to damage a drive with a magnet. Even if you do you may only corrupt a small portion of the data. Using a large enough magnet or moving a powerful enough magnet back and forth above the platters (even through the metal case) can essentially wipe a hard drive.  Here's a good explanation of why the neodymium magnets in the drive don't damage the data stored on it: http://youtu.be/ep_VCotA1ZY

In such cases the Commonwealth is particularly focused on the wishes of the alleged victim, as are the courts.  Even in cases where the proof is overwhelming, there are ways to minimize the impact of these charges.   A conviction can also carry the possibility of a fine in the amount of three times the value of the property, in addition to restitution to the alleged victim.  In cases where the proof is lacking, the substantial penalties for allegations that the value of the property exceeded $250 mean these charges should be taken very seriously."

Opiate withdrawal is actually fairly safe as far as chances of it killing you but it basically feels like you have 7 strains of swine flu at once and got hit by a train.

At this point an usher came down and asked to see tickets, turns out we were in the wrong seats.  I apologized and told him it was a mistake, he said ""fucking mistake yeah right.""

For bigger games when I really did want my seats and someone was sitting in them, I would just say almost exactly that.

We noticed that our row and the ones in front and behind us were unusually empty.  All of a sudden a college-age kid wearing a long sleeve shirt and a tie jumped up and started yelling at us.  ""Those seats are reserved!"", he practically screamed in my face.  Well, I immediately got pissed off by his behavior and asked him wtf he was talking about, these were our seats.  He then went on to arrogantly say we could sit ""over there"" and kind of vaguely waved at the next very crowded section.    I promptly said hell no, we were sitting in MY seats and he could fuck right off.  ""Nice girl"" he said sarcastically to my male friend.  I told him if he had approached us nicely, maybe we could have worked something out, but he started out by screaming in my face and I didn't appreciate it.    My friend and I sat down and proceeded to get comfortable, wondering who the hell this guy was and why he thought he could control seats that weren't his.  The funny thing is, absolutely none of his friends or whoever he was expecting even showed up.  We basically had three rows to ourselves."

Teens can be very self absorbed and don't really have a concept of life as an adult/non student, thus when a student decides that they have been wronged by their teacher (usually grades relating to student not doing home or class work) they can recklessly deface that teacher online through any forum or sites like ratemyteacher.

ProRevenge,3aq71t,metastasis_d,4,Mon Jun 22 20:28:44 2015 UTC,"Morse v. Frederick:       Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393 (2007), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held, 5–4, that the First Amendment does not prevent educators from suppressing, at a school-supervised event, student speech that is reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use.   In 2002, high school principal Deborah Morse suspended Joseph Frederick after he displayed a banner reading ""BONG HiTS [sic] 4 JESUS"" across the street from the school during the 2002 Olympic Torch Relay.  Frederick sued, claiming his constitutional rights to free speech were violated. His suit was dismissed by the federal district court, but on appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that Frederick's speech rights were violated.  Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, concluded that the school officials did not violate the First Amendment. To do so, he made three legal determinations: first, that ""school speech"" doctrine should apply because Frederick's speech occurred ""at a school event""; second, that the speech was ""reasonably viewed as promoting illegal drug use""; and third, that a principal may legally restrict that speech—based on the three existing First Amendment school speech precedents, other Constitutional jurisprudence relating to schools, and a school's ""important—indeed, perhaps compelling interest"" in deterring drug use by students.

From my POV, this is how that night went down:   PL informed me of what was about to go down about a day prior, I offered to follow him in my car so he'd have another body to keep the weirdos from jumping him. (The last time he had to pick his sister up from anywhere, it was in an EXTREMELY shady part of town, he wanted friends with him and understandably so)  I followed PL to the location specified and agreed upon between him and his Sister We show up, I get out of the car as soon as PL and his sister meet and start talking, because I saw someone from her car getting out (didn't want him getting jumped, and I'm a big hefty guy [more on the fat side of things though]).  Sister starts giving PL the business about the state of the car (car taxes weren't paid for that year yet, among other things she complained about.) PL was amusingly uncaring and robotic through the whole ordeal.  Sister finally says ""Fine"" and hands PL the money.  PL and I get in my car, and drive off, PL lets me know about the entire situation as a whole.  ""You think it was a bad thing that I left fumes in the tank?"" ""She's got an expired license too""    Suffice to say, when I saw her, she had every single symptom you get when you're a heavy meth user. Sans the messed up teeth, but I'm sure that would have come with time. Her eyes were sunken in, her behavior was semi-erratic as well.

It wasn't even a full year after she graduated high school before I had to pick her off the street because the father of the girl she was mooching off of had demanded she whore herself out for rent or get out.   My mother took her in, got her back on her feet and she had a good job going for her. Then she gets into drugs again and it just got worse from there.

With her car impounded, she ain't going anywhere fast. The expired license isn't that big a deal if she has nothing to drive. Now that PL has given her [read: sold] a car, she'll more than likely drive it with that expired license. She's high on meth, so any cop worth their paycheck will notice the dangerous driving, pull her over, and get her for a double-whammy... expired license and a warrant out for evading police.

With a car she thought it'd be ok to go places and be out in public again.   That led to her running it out of gas and leaving it abandoned in the street while tried to get someone to bring her fuel.

It would have been enough to request a new title for the car and have her license renewed, if she could somehow do that while escaping her warrant at least.

ProRevenge,3a780a,Divine2012,8,Thu Jun 18 13:37:22 2015 UTC,"As the 'good child' like you in this situation, I can highly recommend Narc-Anon and Codependents Anonymous for you. It would help your father as well, but you have no control over his attendance.  When I was growing up, as far back as I can remember, my brother tortured me. As in, when CPS found out 1% of what was happening, he was removed from the home immediately.  I could never understand (and still don't completely), how my dad could minimize my brother's cruelties and evilness. How he could minimize its effects on me. How he could expect me to 'get over it' - even though eventually he learned the full extent of what I could remember.  As far as I understand right now, after years of therapy and group meetings, I can tell you the core issue is not about refusing to admit being wrong. It's about giving up hope.  Your dad has gone through Attempt 'A' to Attempt 'Z'. None of them worked. So he  restarted with Attempt 'A1'. He's now on Attempt 'X37'ish.  He's working harder, not smarter. There isn't much of a choice for him. Humans can't control other people, even when it's for his/her own good.   He can't fix her. He can't help her.  He looks at her and sees her as his baby, his two year old walking unsteadily, his baby girl who lost her first tooth and couldn't wait for the tooth-fairy. He also sees who she is, but she is overlaid with happy phantoms of who she was, and wisps of who he wants her to be again.   It's almost impossible for a parent to allow their child to experience short-term suffering, even when it's for their long-term good (even survival).   (One reason my father's behavior was such a mind-fuck - he only picked one kid to help).  Your father's only choices are keep trying in the only ways he knows and can tolerate, or give up and let her go.  Let go of trying to fix her, help her, control her, coerce her, bribe her, push her, love her, manipulate her, support her, pull her, inspire her, buy her, motivate her, beg her, and anything else.   That lets him feel he is doing something to make it better and he has a chance to save her. Otherwise he has to admit he's powerless. And the result of that is letting her go.  And if he lets her go, he has to admit how far she's actually gone. He has to admit that her pain is beyond his control to alleviate; her choices are beyond his ability to influence. Her path is almost certain to lead to her death, most probably preceded by years of excruciating pain.  All he can do is stand back and watch her march to her death, or turn his back and wonder how fast she is walking.  Somewhere deep down, he knows he isn't helping. He knows that he really isn't making a difference. He knows that it's ultimately up to her. But admitting it to himself kills any hope he has left.   When you respond to his pressure to 'help' her, it reinforces his belief that there is something left undone that could cure her. That if he keeps pecking that red lever enough times, there will be a reward.   Witnessing you letting go is an unbearable reminder of how he should respond.   But by not doing anything, he would be leaving her choices about life and death up to her. And that hasn't worked out very well for anyone."

Everyone loved him at first but I noticed there was something 'off' about him and didn't see things the same way everyone else did. I kept it to myself though, as he wasn't a bad guy; just something odd about him that came to light over several months. He was EXTREMELY intelligent and had an impressive work history but had this absent minded professor quality. He once remarked to me as we had to drive somewhere together that 'Quarantine Road' (which we were on) must've been named during the 'Black Plague' (EDIT: we were in the U.S.). I chuckled at that, thinking it was a bad joke, until I realized he was serious. Then he started asking me the same questions over and over at work as if he had never asked them before and I started to think he was losing it then. He also had verbally promised me that he was seeking a 20% pay raise for me as I had already been promoted in my last eval and couldn't be promoted again, but was underpaid considering my level of performance and responsibility. When the time came for this, he denied ever saying it and we started into a back and forth over email regarding it. The last email he sent was ""Quite frankly, you're beginning to annoy me."" which he followed up with a visit to my cubicle, which was right outside of the Director's office. He had pissed me off with his flip-flop and asked me, with a smirk on his face, if I had gotten his last email. I replied that I had and quietly and calmly said 'but you haven't begun to see me when I'm annoying yet!' He BLEW UP. Started screaming at me and swearing while I just sat there and smiled. I simply replied that I was sorry he felt that way, but would appreciate it if he wouldn't scream and swear at me. You could hear a pin drop in the department as he stormed off the floor. The director was in his office and called me in. I shut the door and he asked me what the hell that was about. I told him everything that transpired, including what I said to him, and he first explained that he (the manager) had no business making promises like he had and then asked me what I thought of the manager. Before I could stop myself, I told the director that I honestly thought he was suffering from the early stages of alzheimer's syndrome. His face turned pale and I first thought 'oh, I've screwed up now...' until he related several instances where he stopped by other managers offices and asked them questions only to return 15 minutes later and ask the same questions over again as if he never asked them to begin with. The director told me to take the rest of the day off (a Friday) and I still wondered if I might be in some trouble regarding my comment. I worried over it all weekend until I went in Monday morning and the director called me in again to tell me that he was getting me the raise promised, although he had no obligation to, and that the manager in question had been 'let go' Friday afternoon when I left."

Plant the idea to fire them: State that That behavior should not be tolerated and repeat offenders should not be tolerated, that their behavior is abusive and that you feel threatened.    Its good for you if it was overheard.  Depending on how it went, demand their dismissal, demand distance from them (maybe a new position or new boss).

ProRevenge,39vm9q,Riodancer,10,Mon Jun 15 05:29:16 2015 UTC,"A lot of our legacy code was written in COBOL. I used to love to sift through it and point out errors when I was never formally trained in COBOL. Talk about pissy programmers...more fun was when they decided to move to Object Oriented Programming and tried to teach it to programmers who had been around long enough to have started out with punch cards. From their point of view, it was sorcery. A few actually quit over it. Then there was the guy that fixated on trying to fit all of our products on DVD rather than the CD format we used because...well, no one knows why; he was told they weren't interested to begin with. When he came to them and said 'Look! I did it!' they figured out why he hadn't met any of his deadlines on his actual product and fired him."

I'm older (not ancient but old enough to have one foot in mainframes/DoD stuff and another in Linux/Windows).  I've been really lucky to have made the jump both opportunity-wise and mentally.  I can totally see how a COBOL coding would fix your mind in a very certain way of thinking.  I met a guy 3 years ago who had done nothing but COBOL for the last 30 years.  He also had one employer and was weirdly defensive when we talked about anything modern (web development, for example).  I'm still not sure what to make of his choice.  I can see why it's so scary, I guess, but we have to face our 'fear' and just get our stuff done.  Not only the new languages themselves but current machine's resource management, distributed architectures, and ways to measure and debug make it a completely new world to learn.

ProRevenge,39vm9q,IAAA,9,Mon Jun 15 05:55:14 2015 UTC,"Well, it's rewarding but tech development is a hard sector.  Mostly because of the churning that takes place with cycles of money coming in, heavy overtime, then layoffs in 1-to-3 years because of failed initiatives/services/products.  When it does pay off you get to work on some great stuff but as I've gotten older I'm now a little envious of my relatives and friends who are in the same jobs after 20 years.  I earn more (because of my elevated position and experience) but they haven't been laid off 3x in the last 15 years like me.  My advice to anyone in the industry is to have a lot of skills and interests to keep a lot of 'irons in the fire'; Don't get stale and don't ever just say you can/will only do one thing forever.  I have a good friend that's a graphic designer (formerly a game artist... 2D only) and she was basically phased out over the last 15-20 years.  For a while, it was good times and a lot of work but few people saw the threat from China/India/SEAsia for their ability to create relatively cheap 2D art with only a few key frames and a character concept book.  So, she moved only corporate graphic design then UI design/art then lately UX/UI design.   She loves her work (and the good paycheck) but misses the game art.  We both miss the game industry actually."

ProRevenge,39vm9q,DaemonXI,3,Mon Jun 15 21:47:36 2015 UTC,"Is this your first QA job or just a new one in a series of past ones?  Here are my quick suggestions (gotta get to work).   Learn the positives and negatives to every situation and tech you are using.  You can almost force any tech to do a LOT of things but that does not mean it is the best application of that technology.  This is a hard one to learn but eventually, if you stay in QA, it will shape how well of an advisor you can be in your role.  It's hard to learn because the people who are advocating a technology tend to also be defensive on it's downsides.  Or maybe they feel threatened by the idea of you learning more about it.  Knowledge is power and too many tech people tend to hoard it for themselves. For whatever platforms you are working on, learn to automate tasks with scripting and scheduling tasks.  It's both helpful to you, your team, and the company but it will also expose you to different ways to make things easier and faster.  At almost every company I work for, I end up automating tasks.  Right now, I have scripts that do a bunch of things like collate performance numbers from the previous day, send emails on build changes, etc. Start learning about software quality metrics and measuring.  I have never seen a software quality argument (ahem, discussion) harmed by having too many facts and hard evidence.  A lot of QA shops will rely on feeling of the build.  ""Test this and see if it blows up..."".  This is great and absolutely necessary.  That kind of ad-hoc testing is invaluable.  But so is planned, measured coverage.  When you are making an argument as to why something needs to be fixed or what area of the system people need to pay attention to next, your developers and QA people should have cursory and automatically-collected numbers on current bug-to-location density (how many bugs in each module/section of the system), when they were introduced, bug lifecycle numbers, mean-time-to-failure (MTtF) for every important section of code, etc.  While this should not be the sole driver of your direction, it should be present in the conversation. Learn why people are making the decisions they are making.  Sometimes things will not make sense to you.  If you have a better suggestion then ask why they aren't doing it the seemingly better way.  Sometimes you end up working with jerks and they just want to exercise their power but sometimes you are wrong too and will learn some nuance about the system that you might've overlooked. Get to know your QA manager, other supervisors, and programmer.  Seriously.  If you are QA and they are coding then you need to keep the conversation alive and well like any good working relationship.  Ask to talk to people.  Tell them you want to learn and then learn stuff.... whatever your dev group is working on.  Keep a running list for any terms or acronyms or initialed shorthands that you hear and REALLY LEARN what it is.  Read it on wikipedia and then try to implement it on your own in a very simple way.  Play with the tech that the devs are using. If you want to code, don't wait for the job and do it now at home or in free time at work.  Script, code, whatever.  It literally is like learning a new language and culture so the more you use it then the more it will be natural.  I sadly barely code now and miss it.  However, my career was moved forward both by the fact I was literate enough to talk to coders and smart (or lucky?) enough to ask the right questions at times.  My best advice for learning would be to ask for a task that you can succeed-at at work and then ask for time to do it.  Maybe it costs you some personal hours but I swear if I see someone doing this and asking questions then I'll move them into my list of 'People that I need to keep an eye on"" for further education, opportunity, and promotion. Read industry and tech news.  Not just about what flavors the new Apple watch is coming out in.  If you are working with system that heavily relies on HTML5, Mac, MySql, and FooCorporation's BestNewTechOf2015 then take the time to regularly learn what they are, go to the forums or sites that teach that stuff, skim the sites where people post questions re: that stuff.... then keep an eye out for how to improve your current development based on what you are seeing.   Good luck with your new job!"

They all complained about the workload and the ratio of work to family time.  They would put in solid hours at the beginning of a release then ramp up until release.  Then they would have additional time they'd have to take after release to polish patches or DLC.  All the while they were promised a few weeks off once that finished.  Only to have the next game signed and have to repeat the process.  Cut to the chase, I had a buddy who worked for EA and he didn't get time off for anything other than a few days for Christmas and Thanksgiving for three years.

The company really liked me and I went from a general assistant to a test lead and tripled my pay in the space of the first 2 and a half years I was there. I have a strong work ethic and my opinion held a lot of weight 4 years in when I was leaving to pursue other ventures.  My last manager there, who we called 'Half Day Hambly' (not his real last name, but similar) because he had a habit of disappearing after lunch on Thursdays and Fridays. None of us minded too much since when he was there he liked to 'shoulder surf' and micromanage projects where he knew absolutely nothing and generally made an ass of himself. He was known for forcing projects off track and then blaming the platform programmers for the stall; he had no problems tossing people under the bus to give the appearance that he was competent.  Right before I left, I had to have minor outpatient surgery and I stopped by his office to let him know that I would need to work from home for a few days afterward, which was a routine occurrence in my department and I had done it on a couple of occasions. He agreed and I went about my business until he informed me after I put in 30 hours from home while recovering that I would need to use comp time to cover my missed hours. I went to him and reminded him of the fact that he OK'd it and he gave me a 'fuck you' smile and said 'Well, I guess you should have put it in an email.'  So, the following week, when I did my exit interview with HR on my last day I unloaded on them and told them all about Halfday Hambly's adventures in mismanagement and how he regularly skipped out after lunch to go play golf on Thursdays and Fridays. The HR manager I spoke with tried calling his office to bring him down right then but got no answer. He asked me if I'd go by his office and bring him down but when I went up, I found his office locked and no one answered the door. The look on the HR managers face was priceless when I told him this as it was 1:30pm on Friday when this happened. The HR manager had my check adjusted for me, wished me luck and I left with a smile on my face knowing I had outed this asshole.  2 weeks later, my good friend and coworker called me up to say 'guess who they just fired!' HR started watching old 'Halfday' after I left and determined his caliber of excellence would serve him best somewhere else."

ProRevenge,39dzr3,kionae,7,Fri Jun 12 02:45:42 2015 UTC,But pitbulls are such adorable and harmless creatures! How could this happen?
ProRevenge,39dzr3,Bandin03,21,Fri Jun 12 02:47:36 2015 UTC,"Pitbulls can be amazingly kind and loving pets.  But like any dog, they can also be aggressive (particularly if they're poorly trained, or conditioned to be aggressive)... and because of their size/strength, when a pitbull gets aggressive, it often doesn't end well.  They're not inherently dangerous animals... they just have a reputation that results in douchebags turning them into dangerous animals."
ProRevenge,39dzr3,Tastygroove,9,Fri Jun 12 02:57:10 2015 UTC,"They are. But because of their reputation, they're the dog of choice for most dudebro douchebags that don't train them properly or train them to be mean."
ProRevenge,39dzr3,2OQuestions,5,Fri Jun 12 03:58:13 2015 UTC,Their rep sure hurts their bite statistics from insurance claim data too. Matter-of-fact data is SO BIASED...   http://m.livescience.com/27145-are-pit-bulls-dangerous.html
ProRevenge,39dzr3,blueharpy,5,Fri Jun 12 04:08:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, but which is the cause of the data? Is it that pit bulls are inherently dangerous, or that people who want dangerous dogs pick pits b/c of their reputation and make them meaner than they would be otherwise?  Correlation =/= causation.   Does the approach of December 25th start natural phenomenon of trees falling? Or do the choices of people near the date of Dec 25 cause trees, normally just happily vertical, to be cut down?"
ProRevenge,39dzr3,blueharpy,0,Thu Jun 11 03:06:16 2015 UTC,Can you pick the 'pit bull' on the first try?  Most people cannot. Who knows what breed it was if it looked 'like a pit bull' and they're not dog people.
ProRevenge,39dzr3,0verTheRainb0w,6,Thu Jun 11 03:36:21 2015 UTC,"Picked it on the first try. That being said, the dog I wrote about had the characteristics of a pit bull. Does that mean it was, genetically speaking? Who knows. Is a rottweiler really a rottweiler if it has 50% German Sheppard DNA? I'd argue that any dog that has the typical characteristics of a given breed is of that breed.  What's funny is in many discussions about pit bulls and their breed specific behavior, you've got lots of people saying ""it's not the breed, it's how the owner raised them."" Inevitably someone will mention rottweilers and the response is, ""they're great around kids because they're even tempered."" In other words, only non-aggressive traits are inheritable in dogs whereas aggressive traits are instilled by their owners. Few people offer rebuttals to those who claim Chihuahuas bark a lot, yet this is a breed specific behavior.  Pit bulls were bred to bring down large game. They were bred to be aggressive and have strong bite force. This doesn't mean their mindless killers, but they're more temperamental than many other breeds and large enough to cause severe injuries when they do become aggressive. A Daschund biting you on the ankle is annoying but survivable with a bandaid or two. A pit bull biting you on the neck results in a wound with a high mortality rate.  It's all beside the point. The neighbor in my post had a large aggressive dog, the breed is irrelevant. I only mentioned it so it's easier to visualize the scenario."
ProRevenge,39dzr3,Avatar_Yung-Thug,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:13:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, I understand your point. Mine was only that the statistics on ""pit bulls"" are flawed, because most people have no clue about rare breeds or lookalikes.  I have a registered purebred yellow Lab and have been asked multiple times if he is a pit bull or a cross, by randoms on the street. One groomer was going to charge me extra because 'he's clearly part pit bull at least,' I told her he's a registered purebred lab and she scoffed at me. Thus, I am extremely skeptical about the breed identification of the public. German Shepherds are fairly easily identified, but are people also classing Tervurens and Malinois as Shepherds or mutts? Probably. I know they used to think my childhood Doberman was a Rottweiler, etc.  TL;DR it's just that people can't identify dogs for shit, so the statistics are only as good as the info received."

No. The problem is he lacked compassion and empathy. He didn't care about the fact that he was keeping his neighbors up all night. He didn't care that he was disrupting their ability to relax on days off. He didn't care that his dog was a menace (in fact he thought it was funny.) Heck, he even have a pool pass to his friends despite the fact that he wasn't on the lease (only friends of lease holders could go to the pool and had to be accompanied by the lease holder.) Then his friends would get drunk and rowdy at the pool and when the female apartment manager tried to get them to leave, the cussed at her, made sexually explicit remarks to her, and threatened her when she called the police.  What a horrible person I am for wanting to sleep at night and not be mauled by a dog. Thanks for showing me the light pal."

Pretty soon his friends were over every bloody weekend, then started showing up during the week, even when the young one was at work. Like wtf right? It got so bad we had a house meeting and basically said the parties have to stop, and his friends are not allowed over anymore.

ProRevenge,39240j,oh-jcb,4,Tue Jun 9 20:58:24 2015 UTC,Cheating isn't really just about sex because obviously the cheater has their SO if they just want sex. It's more about doing something bad and getting away with it or screwing someone they've been attracted to but can't do anything with. I feel like fucking someone in your fiancé's bed would do a hell of a lot more for a person who gets off on being sneaky and bad and getting away with it than doing it in some place where there is no chance of getting caught.   Also it's a story on an anonymous forum by an anonymous person... You mean to say it's possible that it might not be true?

It's hard to assume someone would lie about something like this because there doesn't seem to be much to gain.   The primary reason is that she did a bad job of representing how humans behave. That's the biggest tipoff. When people get cheated on and are of sound enough mind to not freak out then and there, and also to have the maturity to be sure the relationship is over and be willing to end it, it's not likely that they'd want to go to the trouble of dragging out a painful situation just to cause shame/embarrassment to the guilty party.

ProRevenge,37g6i0,mandalorkael,1 point,Thu May 28 00:51:10 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, my ex had a CC for which I was an authorized user.  I had a card with my name on it, but she was the one legally responsible for all the charges.  Original plan was for us to charge all our household purchases to it, and split the bill 50/50.  We both claimed similar beliefs about CC debt:  don't spend more than you owe, always pay off the balance each month.    For a while, we'd go through the statement every month together and check it against receipts, but between school and work, we stopped making the time, and she'd just tell me what my half was.  It was always about the same, maybe $600-700 for the month (this is all groceries, furniture, etc etc; we lived pretty frugally).  After four years of this, when we broke up, I called the CC company to get myself removed from the account, and found out my ex was hiding three years of debt, totalling $4k, on the card.    I'm now a lot more vigilant in relationships about spending.  Current gf makes a LOT more money than me and we've been very clear that we'll figure out a way to pay equally and transparently, if we ever move in together.  Important note:  it DID show up on my credit report, but only after the breakup (and I check every year, so I have no idea why it didn't show up).  Not sure if it affected my score, but it did show up on the report, and I had a credit monitoring service that contacted me multiple times to say ""a card related to you is maxed out!"".  I did get it removed from the report; it would have dropped off after 5-7 years, but I'd rather not have monthly reminders of my ex and her credit choices."

ProRevenge,37g6i0,SpicyPeaSoup,8,Fri Jun 5 05:06:14 2015 UTC,I'm sure it was embossed with HER name as an authorized spender on HIS account
ProRevenge,37g6i0,tankfox,2,Wed May 27 15:16:52 2015 UTC,"I really doubt that she could get a credit card in his name. He would have had to sign some stuff, and quite a few banks require personal visits if you've not opened with them before, and so forth.  You just plain can't register accounts in other people's names legally."
ProRevenge,37g6i0,pie-oh,10,Wed May 27 19:49:55 2015 UTC,"While I don't believe that anything posted on ProRevenge actually ever happened, it is very easy to open a credit card account in someone's name in the US.  Most people receive multiple CC offers a week in the mail that just require a few details to be filled out and mailed in.  A couple living together would very easily have that kind of information, which basically boils down to name, address, social security number and not much else. For more legitimate CC companies, they might ask for previous addresses and a couple of other credit/bank accounts, but again for a couple living together this would not be difficult information to get.  Again, I don't believe this story, but the credit card portion is easily possible to cause to happen in the US - not sure about other countries."
ProRevenge,37g6i0,ImBillBraasky,2,Thu May 28 13:49:41 2015 UTC,"Ahh. Fair enough.  If this did happen, then surely she basically was an thief? She forged his signature, and pretended to be him – which is a federal issue, right? (I've lived in the States, but my law knowledge lacks.)"
ProRevenge,37g6i0,pie-oh,3,Wed May 27 12:28:02 2015 UTC,"Oh its definitely illegal, I probably should have mentioned that as well - its just very, very easy to do.  It is fraud, which depending on the amount could be a local or a federal issue.  With the amounts involved though it probably wouldn't be a major criminal issue though - but the bigger issue is proving it.  The burden is on the person who's name the debt is in, and unless they had video evidence of someone physically forging their information and signature and mailing it in it is nearly impossible to prove you didn't request the credit line.  Bottom line - laughably easy to get into debt in the US, very difficult to get out of debt."

ProRevenge,36nvb5,sleepyhollow_101,147,Thu May 21 00:09:33 2015 UTC,"Well, sleepyhollow_101, that's where things get a little more interesting. For the first few calls, we gave a fake name so we couldn't be tracked. After a few calls, though, we realized we could go ONE LEVEL DEEPER! and used the name of another notorious douche (and good friend of Randy) in the barracks. So, Randy actually thought it was his good friend Seaman Douche that was making all these calls. About a week after leaving, he actually called the barracks to vent at Seaman Douche for his treachery, the irony being lost on him. There were  'Someones been calling Randys family telling them Randy got kicked out' whispers around the barracks for a few days, but we kept it well quiet, as not to be found out (and disciplined ourselves).   When we started sending out the letters, we used different names for the return address, some fictional. About 2-3 weeks after the first call, Randy called the barracks AGAIN to accuse a different guy of doing all of this. For a time, the small group of us debated calling Randy to rub it in, but we were sure he would have recognized whose voice it was, and I would be standing before the Captain myself.   The way i figure it, because we spread out the calls/letters to so many people, the blowback probably went on for months. Whenever I get melancholy and think of those old days, I imagine Randy trying to apply for work all over  his county and getting the reply ""You said your name is Randy UNUSUAL SURNAME?"". I picture UNUSUAL SURNAME becoming associate with narcotics use, Dishonorable Discharges, and betrayal. I picture Randy wondering to himself just how widespread news of his misdeeds had spread.  I like to think he realizes it' would've been better to man up and take the Bad Conduct Discharge instead of trying to screw some poor dude to save his own skin. I like to think that he is a joke in SMALL SOUTHERN TOWN and that to this day he actually flinches when he hears his own name.   You know why? Because fuck Randy."

There are guidelines for punishment, but the military judge has a lot of discretion.  Administrative discharges are: Honerable, General, and Other Than Honerable.  Punitive discharges are Bad Conduct and Dishonorable.  Administrative discharges allow some level of Veterans benefits, and punitive discharges cut off all benefits.  This guy was ""upgraded"" as part of a plea bargain - likely because he lied his ass off and told the judge that drugs were rampant in the barracks, that everyone was doing them and he was the only one to get caught."

ProRevenge,36auf1,Relevant_Monstrosity,5,Mon May 18 10:47:20 2015 UTC,"I develop software but have exactly zero academic training involving CE. When one of the guys I was managing (MSc in CS) found out he just about lost his shit.  While he had his tantrum I added fuel to the fire by saying, ""You needed someone to show you how to do this easy shit?"" He was an inch from hitting me. You might think that I was being a shitty manager but it was really hard to get people off my team as I had some excellent billing projects so after he calmed down I suggested he find another team. He was a crappy programmer and a douche.  That said another guy who was just finishing his masters was easily the best programmer I have worked with. So my takeaway is that school can help but doesn't guarantee squatto."

ProRevenge,36auf1,trowawufei,3,Tue May 19 03:37:35 2015 UTC,"Something cool on your resume. There are many kinds of cool in no particular order.  Working for a cool company even if you were a nobody, apple, google, facebook, etc.   Having a top tier university degree will very much impress the HR departments and upper management.  Others want to see an active Github account where you have made contributions to multiple projects.  Having a zillion contacts with computer people in LinkedIn is another measure that many shallow HR departments look at. But they also look at what kind of actual engagement you have.  Actual stuff that shows you can put a project to bed. Many many people can program but taking a project all the way and making it happen is actually a skill all on its own. This could be an app you did on your own and sold on some app store.  Contributing to an opensource project. Either a major contribution to a small project or an interesting one to a massive project. This can be a great way to get domain experience that can be relevant to what you want to do. So doing something on the libressl would show that you have some crypto chops. Working on a networking part of linux would show network stack chops, etc.  But teamwork is harder to ""document"" so having some understanding of managing projects would at least show that you will be able to communicate with management. So something from the PMI would look good.   One of the constants in the world of hiring programmers is that nobody really knows what they are doing but many have rigorous systems anyway. A common interview tactic is basically a series of trivia contests that more test what you have memorized. Others will do programming tests. Others are all interviews where being able to BS is a key skill. Some are all about the buzzword bingo and the worst are the experience whores combined with buzzword bingo ""10 years experience with Python 3 or better.""  So the easiest would be to put out some kind of application on your own(maybe opensourced on Github) and the second would be a contribution to a major opensource project."

As stated in the story, it was retaliation for him going off on the IT dept. for something that was entirely his doing...  He created a problem but wouldn't cooperate with us in finding the cause and resolve the problem, preferring to bitch about how incompetent we were because we could not replicate the problem without his cooperation. This wasn't our first clash with him; it was, however, the one which pushed us to finally retaliate; a side benefit was that the more he was obsessing about his car, the less time he was harassing the IT dept."

I've only ever had one class in my four years that has gotten a terrible sub review. It was one of my 6th grade choir classes this year. I dreaded being gone on their class days as I knew it would suck for the sub. Out of 24 in that class, 10 of them were amazing and I felt so bad that they had to deal with the others. I do auditions for my 7th grade choir and I flat out told the 6th grade choirs that the only reason I wouldn't put them in 7th grade choir would be their behavior. Took care of those kids! One of them didn't bother auditioning but still signed up....I took care of that with an email to the counselor. I would much rather have a group of mediocre talent that was full of kids that wanted to be there and work hard than a class of amazing singers that have bad attitudes and won't work.

In February 2009, as a result of the information he gave U.S. authorities, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it had reached a deferred prosecution agreement with UBS that resulted in a $780 million fine and the release of previously privileged information on American tax evaders.   As a result of the financial recoveries facilitated by his whistleblowing, Birkenfeld received a $104 million award from the IRS Whistleblower Office in September 2012.

Maybe because I know my own brother, he would show up bloody and drunk with some large dead animal telling me if I gut it for him he'll give me some, and if I'll make him some sausage he'll give me half. This happens every time he thinks he can ""get away"" with it and if I'm living on his private hunting area will happen often.   I hate hunting, I have a soft, soft heart and can't kill the sweet little animals.  I can process em though, and I'm damn good at that. I can also happily eat them.

ProRevenge,359bar,Divine2012,7,Fri May 8 16:36:09 2015 UTC,Your brother should have hired a lawyer at the time of sale as his problems were easily foreseeable and avoidable.  His first mistake was selling the house and the land over. He could have offered to let them LEASE the house and land for cheap. Or sold them the house  but not the land it sits on. I've seen the latter sort of deal for cabins. And finally I am pretty sure a lawyer could have written up an agreement giving him first right of refusal when they went to sell and some kind of terms of what the sale price would be so they couldn't make an obscene profit trying to sell it back to him at a much higher price than the sweetheart terms he gave them.   I won't dispute that the family sound like assholes but that's exactly why we have contract law to begin with.

ProRevenge,354vy0,ckg85,5,Thu May 7 12:33:27 2015 UTC,"It sounds like he also put the dead animal in a milk crate (a nearly indestructible container with open holes). The milk crate (with the dead skunk in it) was dragged along behind the car for 24 hours and hundreds of miles.  Not only did that give it time to start decomposing from its internal bacteria, but it was also exposed to sunlight/heat (which in Florida is warm in the winter, and scorching in the summer).   So by the time he even gets to the convertible, the skunk has been ripened, ripped, dragged and de-furred. Not only does it have natural skunk stink, early stages of decomposition, and that fun asphalt smell, but the corpse looks more monstrous naked than 'clothed'.   After all that prep work, it is tossed into the car and the imitation bomb added to get public attention to the revenge.  10/10- would read again."

ProRevenge,354vy0,seiyria,-4,Thu May 7 04:25:56 2015 UTC,"This was my first thought, too. We're missing a large part of this poorly-written story. I'm betting OP's grandpa didn't do a damn thing to help his parents, and the brother helped build/maintain their parents' business, which is why he took it over when they passed. It also sounds like the brother was legitimately taking care of his mother. Kidnapping? BULLSHIT. That would have been prosecuted.  And driving from Michigan to Florida just to put a dead skunk in the brother's car? Complete bullshit. The grandpa would have made his own car smell just as bad.

When someone gets ejected like this, they still spun it in a positive way, but just enough so that likely everyone could read into it the proper meaning.  Had he been truly leaving under good circumstances, it would probably be phrased in a lot more positive light with more emphasis on his value to the company/etc.    The people that read this kind of exit messaging are usually able to fine tune the sarcasm in other words, and truly interpret the meaning without getting the company in legal hot water."

AFTER the plane starts to taxi, the starts to speak in a panicked voice in her language; eventually another woman starts to frantically ring her call button.  The attendant comes over and the woman says:  ""Are you aware that this woman thinks she is on a flight to Warsaw?""  We had to return to the gate to swap her out.  Evidently she got lost, walked to to an American Airlines agent for directions, and that guy just walked her onto the plane.  After we got in the air, they announced that ""There will be no Polish jokes allowed on this flight"".  And even 12 year old me was thinking to myself ""Who's fault was this?

It got on my nerves, particularly since I asked several times for someone to unsubscribe me, and no one bothered to do anything.  Well one day, I get an email from this list with the name of someone who might have been a patient, so I decided to find out who the list maintainer was and call them up on the phone.  The response I got was something to the point of ""it's a low volume list, I don't see your email address on it, just delete the messages and don't bother me.""  I replied that if people were randomly and invisibly getting added to departmental mailing lists without rhyme or reason, that was a major potential security issue, and I'm obviously going to have to report the problem to data security.  The guy on the other end of the phone stammers a bit and we hang up, and then five minutes later I was unsubscribed from the list.  I reported the incident anyway."

They'll sweep you with a layoff for ""performance"" reasons and hire the guy that responds to emails and doesn't use his vacation days but instead cashes them in for cash. Good fighting these practices too.  Nice companies don't rush their employees to finish a job before a deadline, nor do they offer big money. You can't have on without the other, unless you believe in unicorns.

Cue about two weeks of being pulled from classes, breaktimes etc for pointless questioning (one time it was because the headteacher claimed he and another boy 'were walking through the canteen area in an aggressive manner')  Eventually my dad had to step in and tell them to stop fucking with him.

ProRevenge,33b21t,KingMong,2,Wed Apr 22 00:48:42 2015 UTC,"When it comes to stuff like this, it usually comes down to who you ask and how you ask. This is why part of being a teacher is cultivating relationships. With the good kids, the quiet kids, the generic trouble makers, the gang bangers, the nerdy kids, the jocks... all of them. Somebody knows what happened and given the right environment someone will share that knowledge. The key is to not ask in class in front of everyone. Ask in the hallway, before school, after school, at sports practice, whenever you can have a quiet moment without the prying eyes of peers. I've used those connections to recover stolen property, figure out bullying, mediate drama before it turned into fights, and get intel on upcoming gang stupidity.  However, the sub not returning phone calls makes me think something weirder is going on."

The culprets probably don't care anyways.  It sounds like the biggest problem is the sub who apparently lost control of the situation and didn't have the students doing their work.  Why blame the students for this.  If I was a parent of a good student then I'd be in the principle's office ASAP to discuss this and at the next school board meeting if the principle didn't resolve it.

I don't blame you for wanting to make it hard for them, but I don't think making a super hard test applied to everybody helps your students, or even you.  It could have the effect of making the students mistrust testing, which is important to lifelong learning. The tests go from useful tools for helping you/them understand their achievement and where to go from there, or tools for placement and ranking, to something cruel and unusual. If that happens, it may make them tacitly resentful rather than instil respect. Be careful.  If anything, I'd be more mad at the sub. What the heck did they do that week? Take the roll, then go in the back room for an hour-long nap? High school students may be at an age to take responsibility for their own work, but if that were foolproof, we'd both be out of jobs. Why weren't they protecting your gear, and motivating the students to complete the worksheets?  </teacher_mode>  <redditor_mode>   Ha! Little fuckers...  </redditor_mode>"

But the whole thing is that teachers are supposed to instil positive attitudes to the entire learning processes, including assessment, evaluation, and testing.  Not only that, but high schoolers aren't stupid, they know when a teacher is being overly negative toward them, and don't usually respond well to it. A teacher using legitimate classroom practice for illegitimate ends may not be fully parsed by the students as ""sir/miss is unfairly using the test"", but maybe in ""sir/miss is being a dick"" — which isn't exactly better, is it?  In any case, I'm gonna go with years of empirical research of learner attitudes to learning and the effect it has on their achievement, rather than anecdotes..."

That doesn't mean the punishment should be the misuse of an assessment. Assessment is used for specific purposes: measuring achievement, diagnosing learning issues which may impede achievement, or ranking. Using it for any other purpose is abuse of the tool.  Nobody deserves to undergo an unfair assessment, especially if these are summative achievement tests (which, given the timing, I believe they may well be) — because the test should demonstrate a learner's achievement against set criteria, not demonstrate that they can cope with being overworked.  The punishment doesn't fit the crime, and the choice of punishment tool is inappropriate on a professional and academic level.  For any students who may not have participated in wrecking the equipment, it doesn't teach them anything. It's just unfair, full stop.  Is that the life skill that a teacher should impart? That it's okay to misuse things other people may depend on if you deem they ""deserve"" it? I'd love to see that applied to a workplace situation, where an employer is happy to make internal progression evaluations unnecessarily difficult for one-off offences, potentially ending an employee's ability to get a pay rise or see advancement, rather than dealing with them more appropriately..."

While it can be frustrating to not have a perpetrator come forward, punishing all your students for actions that they most likely did not witness is just dickish, to be perfectly honest. Group punishments are easily the worst way to address issues, and while I'm sorry about your piano and hope that you figure out who fucked with your stuff, I can't say that such a drastic and startlingly immature reaction is the best way to go about this.

But, having been a camp counselor, I also understand how hard it is to solve issues like this, especially when nobody fesses up; but you can't allow an incident like this to set a precedent of non-reaction."

ProRevenge,33b21t,radioactivegumdrop,14,Thu Apr 23 20:45:16 2015 UTC,"I feel bad for the kids who honestly don't know what happened to the piano. Punishing an entire class for the actions of one (or a few students) doesn't make them remorseful and it doesn't make them turn against the miscreant(s). It makes the entire class bond, across all social barriers, in dislike of the teacher.   I'm usually in favor of revenge, but if I were one of your students I would lose respect for you for doing this. In what other situation would it be all right to punish an entire group of people for the actions of one? This will make you look weak.   How would you feel if, a year from now, you found out it was the sub, eating lunch alone in the classroom, who spilled the juice? How would you feel if, a year from now, you found out the poorest kid in class accidentally spilled the juice and everyone banded together to keep him from having to pay for something he truly could not afford?"

Someone had to have noticed at some point.  If it had occurred when none of the students were around and the sub did it, surely someone would have noticed when they walked in.    You'd be surprised how quickly people can fess up when they realize that they're likely gonna be punished for something they didn't do but bore witness to."

Yeah. Students in school are fucking animals. I value some of my time in high school for the friendships I made and the valuable conversations I had. But I scarcely consider it to be a time of learning.  To the teachers that make it through each year, I thank you. I'm sorry that the people of my generation are such rancid assholes.

I took a few of your suggestions (namely the anon emails and the ballot box), and I got a confession. Maybe that's because I offered to cut the test in half for the innocent, give 75 questions to the confessors, and 150 to those who were found out but didn't confess. I couldn't match the anon confessor's handwriting to anything, but then they mentioned 4 more that joined in. The math teacher around the corner had more bullocks than little young FizzFox. The moment she caught whiff of my issue, she came into my classes and gave them militant, motherly talking-to. She came back and told me that one burst out into tears and ratted on the other four. Three of them were in my lunch class, and one of them was in her lunch class. According to one of my students, hers had the idea to wreck the place when he heard that my sub handed a student the key to lock the door for lunch. Apparently, he wanted revenge on me since I'm usually put on detention duty on Wednesdays and he's always tardy to his classes on Wednesdays (saith the roster). No phones in detention, which is school policy. I really don't care about that silly rule, but I want to keep my job. He had the nerve to make a phone call in my face without even asking my permission. As soon as he finished the call, I politely asked him to put it away. He didn't and went to playing Fruit Ninja (kids still play that game? hmm...). So I told him to wipe down my board and straighten a few books while I practiced a score for a coming concert. Enough about him, my blood's boiling a little. His mom scares me.  Turns out this kid put tape over the security camera and went to work with the others. No audio, but they ran out of the room grinning.  To sum up, I'm almost a happy musician again. That kid has a 200 question exam in math. I was offered to pick the questions, but I declined. His mother offered to pay for the piano though. I don't believe in denying a kid that wants to learn music, but if he ever wants to be my student, <insert vulgarity here>. My room's back in order, class is great once more, and we're having an end of the year concert to top it all off. To atone, those scoundrels--I mean students agreed to pass out flyers the week before, get t-shirts, and hand out tickets at the door. And clean up duty. Thanks kids. Don't shoot yourselves in your feet again. :-)   Edit: Before you call my relief/previous mood rash, I did tell my other students that I was sorry. And they apologized as well since they were marked guilty when that kid told him he did it. He threatened to do something to Mr. FizzFox if they snitched. Expulsion was at the top of the list, but his mother argued it down to a two-weeks suspension. Damn that woman! I see a bullet-proof vest in my future..."

Once they cave from the social pressure of everyone being pissed at them (assuming any of the other students know who it is, which at least some of them probably do) deal with them accordingly.

There was the mgr (Larry), the assistant mgr (Roger), and me (I) along with three more employees. I quickly ascended the ranks and within a month I was swing mgr. This made Roger uneasy. Roger began to find fault with everything I did, and tried everything in his power to make me look bad in front of Larry. This went on for months. Any time I closed and Roger opened there was always an issue. The door wasn't locked, the alarm wasn't set, the store was a mess...however none of this happened whenever I closed and Larry opened or if Larry & Roger opened together. Larry mentioned to me to watch my back around Roger, b/c the DM would be making his rounds soon, and Roger's input might hurt my chances for another promotion.  I formulated a plan.  I waited until a day in which Larry & I opened together, and Roger came in later to close. Around 11:30, I mentioned to Larry that I was hungry, and would he like a sandwich from busway before he left. I mentioned that I had been doing more computer work lately and had some extra money so it was no big deal he could buy my lunch sometime later. He said ok, I went & got the lunch, we ate & he left. Around 2pm Roger came in, and my first order of business was asking him if I could borrow $10 for lunch b/c I was starving & hadn't eaten. He was all ""Awwww...man, noooo....I sure don't"".  Before I left that evening I took $50 from the register. I was off the next day. I went & bought beer & cigarettes.  The following day when I returned Larry met me at the door. He said 'I', I had to fire your buddy. I said ""What???, why?"". He said ""The register came up short & when it did the first thing out of his mouth was 'IT WAS 'I', HE WAS ASKING ME FOR MONEY TO GET LUNCH WITH'.  Larry said ""I looked him in the eye and said 'I KNOW YOU'RE A DAMN LIAR, HE ATE LUNCH WITH ME AND EVEN BOUGHT MINE, you've been trying to sabotage him from day one and I'm sick of it. You're fired, get your stuff and get out'  Over the course of the next few months, I slowly paid the money I'd taken back into the register.

Even if you paid it all back, with interest, there's no amount of reconciliation you can do with the business to square things. It causes a shit ton of headaches on the accounting side, makes a ton of reports for LP (idk if you had an LP or not, or if it was a corporate one, etc), and leads to nasty consequences.

They were desperate to find a place immediately, as they came down before the fall semester started and hadn't been able to lock down a place to stay through the university system until then. I told him she would ""probably move out soon"" and that up until that point she had been paying half the rent and that he could discuss it with her. He didn't seem remotely fazed and I signed the papers and moved out that evening.   The thing about her parents- I'd known ""Maggie"" since we were in the 6th grade. We were friends, off and on, through high school. She wanted desperately to get out of the dorms and I needed a place that would let me keep my huge dog. I found a place but couldn't afford it on my own then I ran into her in one of the dining halls, we struck up a conversation, and she called her parents and begged them to let her leave the dorms at the end of the fall semester. They really liked and trusted me- I was super religious and low-key in high school, she was kind of a wild child, so they agreed to let her live with me and pay for half of the bills and rent. They thought she had gone with me to sign the lease, but she couldn't come up with her half of the deposit on her own, -the only stipulation they gave her- and in a rare flash of common sense for a 19 year-old, I told her if she didn't have any money in the deposit, she couldn't put her name on the lease. At the time it didn't seem like a big deal. Lots of kids roomed together haphazardly all over town in varying degrees of illegality.   I knew and liked her parents. Then, after the whole dog bite thing, (which she elaborated on quite a bit and concocted quite the sob story to get him out) they were ""disappointed"" with me and with her and were starting to have their misgivings. By the time I booted her out, she was on the rocks with her parents over several things. I haven't talked to her in a few years, but I still have her on facebook. I know she ended up graduating and working around town a bit, then she ended up living with her parents a while. She was an only child to older parents and I think the three of them had a bit of a hard time getting her to mature and take on life on her own."

My high school spanish teacher was my mother's best friend in Spanish class at the same high school 30 years before.  My mother gives EVERYONE Christmas cards every year. However, this teacher never responded, never called my mom, and never acknowledged them in any way. My mom stopped sending her cards, but I still had a vague idea of who she was.  Like you, I was an AP student in honors yadayadayada. I was nerdy, but it made me feel comfortable speaking in class rather than hushed by the mean ones in the ""popular crowd.""  When she was my teacher, she was ""evil."" I feel bad reading your post because your teacher was so much worse. Our teacher would go on rants about bars, about her boyfriend, about life. She would spend twenty minutes on the most ludicrous stuff. To be fair, it was something like Spanish III and wasn't difficult.  The thing that annoyed me and the class was how she treated us. She had no concept of reading our emotions, feelings, confusions, etc. She had her own nicknames for us that she would use way more often than our chosen ""Spanish names."" Mine was ""bebé"" because she used to hold me as a baby. She didn't just use the word - she would say ""baby who I used to hold"" (in Spanish). She did this with everyone. Another had a last name of Pan so she always called him ""Pan like the bread."" It was so annoying.  Anyway, she clearly wasn't the best person to be teaching high schoolers. We really, really got under her skin. All we had to do was ask stupid yet somewhat sensible questions and be overall bad students. Apparently, all of her classes did the same.  One day, we were being especially bad. Apparently, the next period, she exploded on a poor little nerdy Indian girl for asking a question. The girl ran to the office crying. The next day, we were all waiting outside the room. The bell rang. Five minutes passed. Ten. Fifteen. We all left after that. The next day, the principal came down to say she took a leave of absence due to medical reasons. Nice cover, bro. She never returned.  As I said, I feel kind of bad.

But....I have concerns with a principal firing/pressuring a teacher to retire on the basis of an an anonymous letter. Cause if that's the case then it could swing both ways (removing a bad or good teacher without proof). Most teacher positions are unionized and if this teacher was close to retirement then she would have had seniority and (likely) a union rep fighting in her corner. Hard to believe anyone would fire her without a more thorough investigation. Also, how is it that no other teacher or student heard what was going on in the classroom?   To be clear, I do believe that this teacher was awful and that you wrote both letters. I'm just not sure if this is the whole story. Maybe your letters were joined by other letters, witness statements and other teachers bringing their concerns forward."

Based on how much she seemed to hate her students and teaching in general, I doubt a union rep was even called because she was thrilled to be done teaching.  I wish it were possible for one person to have the whole story, but all I know is that my letter to her and to the principal are essentially the final act to her story that led to her no longer working at my high school.

Even so I lucked into a situation some years ago that was just too perfect.   Here's a copy/paste from the original thread.    This was a few years ago, and I have to admit that it was largely accidental, but it was satisfying none the less. I was on my way home when this guy in a lowered, bright orange car with a huge chrome ""muffler"" sticking out from under the back bumper, hid lights, and a very badly fitted body kit started tailgating me. I had seen the guy coming for a while in my mirrors, going from lane to lane, cutting people off, and in general driving like a jerk. He was in front of me at one point, but when his lane slowed down, he fell behind. The next thing I know, he comes buzzing up behind me, with those blinding bright blue headlights right in my mirrors. He gets so close, there's just this aura of light behind me. Traffic is heavy and I couldn't get out of his way if I wanted to. It was at this point, I see a commotion among the cars in front of me. They are merging into any opening possible. Then I see it. There is a square bale of hay laying in the road that must have fallen off some farmers truck. I don't really have anywhere to go, and the idiot inches off my back bumper makes it a bad idea to stand on the brakes. That's when it dawns on me, that I'm in a 3/4 ton truck with 280,000 miles on it, that looks like it barely survived a war. I'm not worried about what little damage a small bale of hay might do. I never touched the brakes. I feel it hit a couple of times under the truck, but it's not bad. This is followed instantly by a loud whump/crack! noise. The buzzing behind me changes pitch, and those super bright headlights immediately start falling behind. They stay back. Eventually he was able to pass, and as he went by, I could see that part of the the body kit, under the front bumper, was now missing.   I've not been able to duplicate it on dry roads yet, but when it's snowy/icy weather and someone is tailgating, I look for the biggest hunk of ice or whatever in the road, and drive right over it.   Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't, but it keeps me entertained."

ProRevenge,30kftv,Nerdican,9,Wed Apr 8 14:28:55 2015 UTC,"Almost the exact same thing happened to me a couple years back.  I was coming home one night, and although it didn't look icy at first, I quickly realized it was when I fishtailed a bit early on.  From that point I started taking it very easy.  Residential roads have a 50km/h limit, but it's relatively unusual for people to do less than 60 on the ""main"" residential roads.  That said, I was doing 40 on account of the ice, and all of a sudden there was a guy behind me who was NOT happy about it, and it looked like he was planning on tapping me a message in morse code using our bumpers.  Anyway, as I said, I was heading home - so I knew the road.  There's a railway bridge coming up, and the road both dips under it and curves around - treacherous with all this ice.  I know enough about driving on ice to know that you want to brake early in these situations - you want to be going slow enough that you don't pick up too much speed going down the hill, and you don't want to brake on the curve at all.  So a little before this dip/curve combo I ease on the brakes ever so gently - I don't want buddy behind me to run into me, and I don't want to fishtail either.  I also know there's a chance he's going to think I'm brake checking him or pissing him off intentionally, if he doesn't know what's coming.  Unfortunately, buddy slams his brakes, which is obviously the worst thing that could happen.  In my rearview mirror, I see him lose control, except now he's headed towards me, sideways, and fast.  SHIT.  He manages to avoid hitting me as he does a 180 and slams into the opposite curb facing the opposite direction as I go past, slowly.  Just looked as though he was parked there.  I saw his face as my headlights flashed past and he had this wide eyed look of holy fuck.  With the blind curve up ahead I couldn't stop, and I hope he got out of there fast before someone ran into the back of him.  TL;DR: I avoid doing 40km/h version of fast & furious tokyo drift, tailgater behind me not so much."
ProRevenge,30kftv,JoanOfArctic,8,Thu Apr 9 12:01:53 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of an incident years ago in Oklahoma.  It doesn't snow much there, but when it does, the roads become a ghost town.  I got off work one night with it snowing and I was heading down the expressway, going about 40mph (60kph) in a 75mph due to the snow.   I noticed a pair of headlights way back in my rear view but didn't think much of it.  Soon I realize they are approaching pretty quick.  Then I look up and see they are approaching like I was parked rather than going 40, and to my growing horror I don't see them changing lanes.  I had time to check my seatbelt and brace for impact, but fortunately it never came.   At the last second they tried changing lanes, lost control, spun 180 degrees, and passed me going backwards, before skidding off into the median, before coming around to face the correct way.    You would think that would have scared them enough to slow down.  Nope, they looked to have accelerated back up to a similar speed as I took my exit."

ProRevenge,30kftv,Fubared259,86,Thu Apr 2 02:37:32 2015 UTC,"About 5-10 years ago, I had a guy tailgating me and just generally driving like a turd. I slowed right down to about 30 km/h in a 60 zone. The driver became exasperated and attempted a stupid overtake manouver with very little clearance between me and a parked car ahead in the other lane. I hit the accelerator to narrow the gap. He panicked and slammed the brake, smashing into the back of the parked car. I laughed. My girlfriend at the time realised I'm a psychopath.   Edit: I was doing 60 in a 60 zone and slowed down to 30 because the douche was tailgaiting."
ProRevenge,30kftv,IncrediblyEasy,58,Fri Apr 10 21:41:14 2015 UTC,"While he probably deserved it, I find it hard to support shit like this. Given the right circumstances and a dashcam he could've proved that you was actually at fault because of driving too slow (considered a hazard at some places when 20km/h below limit IIRC) and especially for speeding up when he was overtaking."
ProRevenge,30kftv,choppysmash,24,Sat Mar 28 04:44:00 2015 UTC,Not if it was icy. Then they can give you a ticket for going the speed limit. (Driving too fast for conditions).

ProRevenge,30kftv,Sadukar09,5,Sat Mar 28 13:57:21 2015 UTC,"If he had a dashcam, it will prove the other guy's tailgating OP.  Guess what? You must maintain a safe distance to the car in front."
ProRevenge,30kftv,IncrediblyEasy,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:33:32 2015 UTC,"He didn't rear-end OP and that's probably the only objective criteria to use for determining safe distance besides those signs which tell you to keep at 30, 50 or so metres away."
ProRevenge,30kftv,Sadukar09,10,Sat Mar 28 14:17:22 2015 UTC,"You still get ticketed for unsafe following distance even if you ""only"" tailgate."

ProRevenge,30kftv,breakone9r,3,Sat Mar 28 14:30:03 2015 UTC,"I'm in the US, I received a tailgating ticket once.  It was dismissed.  I pulled out to pass a guy doing 40mph in a 55mph and there was a car coming, so I held off passing until the incoming vehicle passed.  It was a state trooper,he hit his lights and pulled me over.   Went in front of the judge, explained what happened, and it was immediately dismissed."
ProRevenge,30kftv,Sadukar09,4,Sat Mar 28 14:54:53 2015 UTC,"So the tailgater gets a ticket for unsafe distance and then OP gets into way more mess for deliberately causing an accident.   If the other guy hadn't been tailgating, OP wouldn't need to slow down.  OP has to be sure the car behind won't smack into him, if the other guy won't fall back. The only way he can do that is by slowing down (sure he can pull over, but there might not be space, and/or the other guy might think it time for confrontation). It's the tailgater's fault he pulled out and passed on the right, which is illegal in many places."
ProRevenge,30kftv,IncrediblyEasy,2,Sun Apr 5 15:45:07 2015 UTC,Our argument perfectly illustrates why a good lawyer could be a game changer in similar debatable situations.

In Europe the minimum distance to the car in front of you (and that is being enforced btw, they put cameras on bridges over the highway) is half the speed.

ProRevenge,30kftv,Beautiful_Girlie_Bob,7,Sat Mar 28 20:03:56 2015 UTC,The only safe response to a tailgaiting cunt is to slow down.
ProRevenge,30kftv,chupacuntbra,0,Sat Mar 28 22:37:19 2015 UTC,"No, it isn't. You could either switch lanes to get out of his way or pull off the road and let him pass. Slowing down is just going to anger him and also pose a danger to traffic approaching doing the actual speed limit while you're doing half."
ProRevenge,30kftv,Beautiful_Girlie_Bob,4,Sun Mar 29 03:13:32 2015 UTC,"If there was another lane to switch to, then shouldn't the guy who wants to pass take it?  Drivers should not be required to second-guess the desires of the people behind them.  Also, it IS safer to slow down when someone tailgates you.  It gets you closer to the safe point of having at least two seconds pass before both cars passing the same landmarks.  When someone gets to less than half a car length back, the safe speed drops to zero."
ProRevenge,30kftv,chupacuntbra,4,Sun Mar 29 16:25:37 2015 UTC,"Take defensive driving; you're wrong. Switching lanes or pulling over is the correct reaponse. Furthermore, in my state, driving 15 or more mph under the speed limit is illegal and is a ticketable offense, same as speeding.   If you don't feel safe driving, get a bicycle or use public transportation."
ProRevenge,30kftv,cowjenga,6,Wed Apr 8 05:59:23 2015 UTC,"No, you are wrong.  If you see a car coming up fast from the rear in your mirrors you don't switch lanes, that's not defensive driving, it's dangerously stupid naive driving.

ProRevenge,30kftv,Visualice,6,Sat Mar 28 11:41:46 2015 UTC,"And really, if you're that bothered by the fast driver behind you, why wouldn't you want them out of your hair?   If it's an open road, sure. If it's heavy traffic and I'm already maintaining a reasonable following distance to the person in front of me, why would I let some dickbag cut me off just so he can be 50 feet further ahead? I slowed down because his proximity behind me was unsafe at the speed, not to let him pass. Once he's no longer there, I'm going back to my previous speed which I would have stayed at in the first place if he wasn't making things unsafe."
ProRevenge,30kftv,cowjenga,3,Sat Mar 28 18:33:11 2015 UTC,Agreed. It was a dick move by me. I felt incenssed by his stupid driving and I suppose there's a chance he learnt his lesson.

I'd have thought that it'd be a requirement to be able to judge car speeds well, and I'd imagine you need good depth perception for that.  But in response to your actual post, I agree - if somebody's tailgating you or wants to overtake then just let them through, it'll make both of you happier.

ProRevenge,303cj9,whicker911,90,Tue Mar 24 03:13:52 2015 UTC,"Well played Sir. I once dated a girl for roughly 3 months. She was a rebound from my ex-wife. My ex-wife cheated on me because ""I was never there"", as I was working 2 jobs to support us. I date this girl and we had many fun adventures, including spelunking and sleeping in that cave, camping, kayaking and multiple trips to places like casinos, the beach and even renting a houseboat for a weekend. I was on the rebound and had excess money from the divorce. This girl goes on a out of state trip with her friends and things get really weird when she had returned. I saw the exact same signs that had occurred with my ex wife. I knew. After a conversation which she explained how she wanted to slow the relationship down, I asked her to talk. She did. Upon her arrival, I gave here he few things she left my apartment and told her to get out without explaination. She called me on her way home and stated that ""didn't mean to hurt me."" I told her she did, or she would not have acted like a whore. Later explanation and discovery showed that she had sex with the heir of a massive company that built and maintained vending machines. The worst part is that this guy was 5 foot tall and had a major limp, due to a birth defect. That messed with my ego for a long while. About 9 years later, I run into her at a funeral held for a mutual friend. We speak briefly, where she tells me that she wants to ""hang out"". She married this guy and he passed away because of this disease that gave him the limp. She received nothing, as this guy was actually living on a trust, which she could not access per any death benefits. We were both 34 at the time. She wanted to ""hang out"". To me that is code for her finding a new person to date and take care of her. I simply told her that my current girlfriend would not approve. The look on her face was priceless. I wished her the best and left. Good Riddance."

These separate groups would bump into each other on some occasion. They actually thought her behavior was terrible as well. I was also 25 at the time. Youth has a way of making a person arrogant and vain. Hence, the ego comment. And, it was not a clubbed foot from my understanding. I am not sure what he suffered from that caused him to have limp, but it was ultimately fatal. I am sure the guy was probably a nice fellow and I don't begrudge him for her behavior, as she was looking for someone to sponge off of."

ProRevenge,2zrcn7,Riguy64,20,Sat Mar 21 00:58:22 2015 UTC,I think this may be a good read for you.  Apparently most Indian graduates go throughout uni doing jack until the final exams where they often cheat. This is all under a presumed culture of cheating and is also why India apparently gets some of the highest mean results
ProRevenge,2zrcn7,LumpySpaceOddity,24,Sat Mar 21 02:34:42 2015 UTC,"Right now, I'm an undergrad in an American college, but before that I studied and lived in India.   I'm going to have to say that at least in my part of the country, there was little to no cheating, and cheating was dealt with severely.   We got our grades by working very hard. Hell, I had some friends who I didn't even meet throughout the 11-12th grade because they were studying for their college entry exams all day. I'm not even joking about this, I literally did not see them for two years because they were so busy.   I, for one, worked my ass off and got a 36 on the ACT. So please don't try and undermine my achievements by saying that our high median scores are because of cheating. I'm not going to deny that cheating is rampant in some parts of the country such as the one in the article and a few more, but it isn't in most parts, and generalising all Indians in that way is very insulting to say the least."
ProRevenge,2zrcn7,MrNeverSatisfied,8,Sat Mar 21 17:34:50 2015 UTC,"You realize that the cheating incident doesn't mean it happens everywhere and to that extent, right? That state is known for its lawlessness and has a whole host of shit prefacing its myriad problems (that video is probably the least of it). But don't lump everyone by saying ""most Indian graduates"" don't do shit. Do you know anything about the school systems over there to presume a culture of cheating?"
ProRevenge,2zrcn7,LumpySpaceOddity,4,Sat Mar 21 03:54:54 2015 UTC,Op was talking about international indians that came straight from india. And i was referring to the indian graduates in india.

I also read what you wrote and I think you made a generalization which was my point in the previous comment.   The news story is an accurate portrayal of one incident and not a nationwide shit show in schools (albeit the school systems do have problems in a lot of areas, but this sort of organized cheating isn't common and had a financial motive amongst other things)."
ProRevenge,2zrcn7,Riguy64,3,Sat Mar 21 04:09:49 2015 UTC,"Ofcourse it does not relate to all indians however, I believe it is in fact very common in india. Especially enough to have developed a 'cheating culture'"

Do you think it would be fair for me to advise people not to study in American universities because they have a culture of school shootings?   No, of course not! Those are just a few incidents.

ProRevenge,2zrcn7,testguyaccount,20,Sun Mar 22 01:12:36 2015 UTC,"wow, reminds me of the last class I was ever taking in Undergrad. Very eccentric English teacher visiting from the UK, I thought his class would be fun because he was focusing on an author I'd enjoyed. Guy was NUTS and VERY quick to anger. I and other students would be booted from class for 'looking sleepy' or mispronouncing a name in the text without any previous knowledge. I got my one paper for the class back about halfway through, and discovered I had a 60% with a SINGLE revision chance. Went to talk to him about it, and he was...surprisingly understanding, 'Due to my impending graduation'. He told me he'd ignore the real grade and give me an A- out of respect for my entire previous education. I was stunned, and relieved, but my Parents were convinced I was pulling thier leg. So they called him on the phone.  When my dad identified himself, the prof SNAPPED. According to my father, he sounded like he threw something in anger, and proceeded to RIP my father apart for not showing him respect and 'faith' in his kind gesture, and showing him 'insulting amounts of doubt and distrust'. I received an email that evening ORDERING me to never come back to class, and that I should be glad I'd be still getting the promised grade, instead of an F.   Worst bit, he didn't end up teaching on that author again for years, so I had to eat the cost on the books. Donated em' years later to a charity bookshop."
ProRevenge,2zrcn7,marcusgalen,6,Sat Mar 21 05:29:31 2015 UTC,"No kidding. I'm friends with a few TAs and a prof, and they find it laughable when parents call them, and insulting when parents try to get into specifics of their child's grades.  This is post-secondary education, not kindergarten.  What does your Dad have to do with your grades?  Many students are legit on their own after high school.  Some are thousands of miles away from home and are forging a life for themselves.  To have some parent call and inquire about a grade probably did not fly in England.  The prof did you a solid, you got a nice grade and didn't have to attend class! Bonus!"

ProRevenge,2zrcn7,Dif3r,43,Sat Mar 21 00:46:56 2015 UTC,"Ahh my good man/woman/redditor, I have been here as well and all I can say is well done to you for putting the hard work in and not letting people who are unwilling to contribute to pull you down.  I cannot count the amount of times I had to do group based projects where the members were not of my (or their) choosing and they turned out to be the laziest bastards to ever walk the earth.   On one of my final forced group projects we had a team of six, two could hardly speak English and simply dngaf, two others really did not give a fuck (why spend the money mofo) and left was myself and my friend.   Despite assurances that they were doing work assigned to them and that they understood it we went on a 4 week Easter break.  Me and my friend try to communicate with them, 2 say yeah we have your back and the other 2 simply say 'hey mangs we're on holiday seeing family YOLO :D '.....  Well being right in the head we both pick up on this, do all of the work and they all come back with NOTHING.  Hand it all in and then we have to submit the contribution scores.  If you are not familiar with this, my uni for group work allowed students as a group to mark people up or down for contribution but a consensus must be met, if not it has to goto the professor who then investigates.   As you can imagine these fuckers are now our best friends but we had enough, marked them all down as far as possible and each other up.  They are pissed and it goes to the professor, show him the emails and our commits over svn (we submitted over 90% of the work) and he fails them all, we both get over 80% for that module.  Now the best part is, if you fail over here at uni level (UK) you get one more chance for that module and it's capped at 40% no matter how well you do and as they were foreign students they had to pay another £10k or so to stay back to scrape a pass for that one fucking module.  Don't ever feel bad about it, I don't.  Also when you were told by your professors that 'this is what happens in the real world',  we were also told this but then we were both slightly older mature students and we simply replied 'yes it does and there ass would have been fired asap'."
ProRevenge,2zrcn7,Johnnius_Maximus,6,Sat Mar 21 02:35:23 2015 UTC,Oh man you got an 80 for that? Was it because of you and your friend doing all the work or because it was a quality project. To be honest I struggled to get 70's when I was on exchange in the UK overall I think I got a 2:1 during my semester abroad.
ProRevenge,2zrcn7,Dif3r,9,Sat Mar 21 14:17:51 2015 UTC,"It was a bit of both really. Me and my friend, lets call her L did all of our group work together where possible.  There were people who had better brains than us but we worked like people possessed.   We both graduated with first class honours at nearly 80 percent for the degree in cs from a top ten uni.  I think it helped in some respects that we were both in our mid 20s, we were used to having little time off due to working beforehand so were happy to work through so called holidays. A week at Easter,  Christmas and 2 over the summer was ample for us.  One of our professors to be put it the best during induction,  treat the course like a full time job, put in at least 30 hours every week and you will reap the rewards.   In the last year we were pulling 80 hours of study plus per week to get dat 1st .  No Einstein here but I worked my ass off."
ProRevenge,2zrcn7,Johnnius_Maximus,6,Sat Mar 21 15:23:25 2015 UTC,"Wow... Similar story to me too. I used to be in a program similar to your Combined Cadet Forces (then the reserves for a bit (similar to your TA I think)) and I ended up being very self sufficient and able to live on my own, cook my own food, do my own laundry, etc. I've been living alone for 8 years now.  I worked my ass off during summers and stayed at the library or computer labs (I didn't like using SSH to access the computers at school so I would be physically there) until 6-ish every school night, sometimes in until 10. Ended up with a GPA a little above 3.2 so a solid B/B+ average (and that was considered good at least for my program).  And I don't know about you guys over there but can you tell the people who had helicopter parents or are ""mommas boys/daddys girls"" apart from the ones who are self sufficient? There's a marked difference in the way they work as a team and think they're special snowflakes rather than collaborating and sharing ideas and willing to discuss the pros and cons."
ProRevenge,2zrcn7,Dif3r,3,Sat Mar 21 15:42:05 2015 UTC,"That's exactly it I would say, being self sufficient for all of that time beforehand really helped me in some ways as well, it was hard work but then so is working your ass off in a warehouse for minimum wage with little benefits, having been there and wanting something better I was more than willing to give it my all, especially knowing just how shitty it can get.  My family initially thought I was crazy, no one in my family (extended included) has ever been to university and I left a good technicians job to pursue it, this also pushed me as failure was really not an option.  We could definitely tell those kinds apart as well, little critical thinking skills and worst of all acting like you know everything, promising the earth when in fact you really cant deliver.  The best students in my experience were the ones who worked hard and crucially admitted to their weaknesses, being humble and shoring up those areas.  I met some great people at uni, but also some of the most arrogant narcissists I have ever encountered."
ProRevenge,2zrcn7,SQUID_KILLER,3,Sat Mar 21 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah... Tell me about it.  Although, there's nothing wrong with being a technician/technologist they are needed, an engineer might spec something out to .0001 inch but it takes a skilled machinist to make that part.  To be honest I knew that university was the right choice for me (but it isn't for everyone). I have a lot of respect for skilled trades. I have friends who are Avionics technicians, machinists, millwrights, and one guy who did carpentry (he can do pretty good finishing cuts; he can look at something, visualize it in his head, make some markings, and make a ""perfect cut"" around joints and such or at least trick your mind into thinking it's seeing a perfect cut). If I weren't doing what I do now I think I could probably be a pretty good machinist or millwright.  I can't blame the kids though; I half blame the parents and half blame the kid because they get it in their head that they're a special snowflake and they keep getting told that all throughout life. An engineer once told me (and I don't know how true this is) that in engineering they get cut down all the time and purposely give low grades to prevent people from thinking that they're god and make them double check all their calculations and have a peer check their calculations just in case if their bridge collapses or their highrise falls over and kills a bunch of people (which is what the original Iron Ring was meant to symbolize, the iron workers who lost their lives from the Quebec Bridge). Yeah you might have been a superstar in high school but so was everyone else and engineering is a totally different ball game."

First day of class he sat and looked over the top of his reading glasses at us, I would say sizing us up but he didn't need to size us up. The first words he spoke to us were ""There are two things you need to know about this class: First, you need to pass this class in order to graduate and second, I don't care if you graduate. You will either do the work and apply yourselves in order to get the grade, or I'll see you in summer school. I will see a good number of you in summer school. If you think that you can squeek by and I'll give you a pass, I would refer you to my brother who thought that he would get by because he was my brother. He took it more seriously when he was here for summer school and didn't graduate with his peers."" He was serious and it was a dose of the real world for the first time. Life doesn't care.

Not everyone will get paralyzed by fear, sometimes the opposite happens.  Now, about teachers.  I had a teacher who would fail everyone on a course if even one student didn't pass the exam. Logic: group discipline will take care of it. The group will do anything in their power to coach the lowest performers to pass the exam. Because, you know, the group can magically motivate the ones that don't give a shit and are there just to pass the time. Peer pressure was another argument. Because, you know, the underperformers really give a shit about what the rest of the class thinks of them. Nope, doesn't work. Especially in a country where education is free. Not a way in hell.  Another teacher pre-defines the amount of people who get a certain grade. The grading is from 1-5, where five is the highest grade, so for example 20% of people get a 5, 20% get a 4, 20% get a 3, etc. Fucking excuse me? So even if I know everything there is to know about a subject, work my ass off on an assignment and hone it to perfection, I still might get a 3 since you only give out a certain amount of a specific grade?

Any truth to that in your experience?
ProRevenge,2zh889,Visualice,2,Thu Mar 19 13:37:04 2015 UTC,"It might work.. But if the teacher is manually feeding the sheets, a perfec5 score is silent, while every error has an audible click.no chance you're gonna hear all the clicks for wrong answers and not notice what the score is.  Pretty sure most teachers would notice the chapstick."
ProRevenge,2zh889,dragonet2,4,Sun Mar 22 21:32:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah after doing some research online it looks like your best bet is to buy scantrons online. You can buy the one that is used to make the answer key which looks almost identical to the rest except for the bubble Marked ""key"". Depending on which type of machine is it will register your scantron as the new key and pass it through without marking any answers. Some machines will automatically use the first scantron in the stack as the key and will treat the rest of the batch as regular tests.   Just guessing here,  but it seems like if you could find a way to locate exactly where the ""key"" bubble would be, you could make a oval there with your pencil and make the machine think it's a key even if it isn't the right kind of form.  I'm sure the machine works by looking for penciled in bubbles in certain spots and it either finds them or it doesn't. The empty printed bubble is just to make sure you draw a bubble in the right spot.   The downside is that every scantron that is graded after that will likely get a really horrible score. Kind of a dick thing to do to your classmates."

ProRevenge,2zh889,TibsChris,24,Tue Mar 31 16:10:47 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - Made entire class feel like shit, girl who sat next to me passed because she wasn't a bitch.  Similar situation but not a revenge story. I just didn't give a shit. I moved schools and then back. In the year I was gone I would've been placed a year ahead in science class, at the original school. So I was with all the average kids, and just way beyond them in terms of understanding the material.  I used to go to sleep after I was done with the test and the rest of the class finished. One day I noticed the girl next to me trying to eye my answers. I had no illusions of anything happening, she had a boyfriend. I looked over at her, and from that point on slid my test over easy enough for her to see, then went to sleep. She was smart enough not to copy all of the answers. I basically taught her the lab experiments(chemistry class), I would've been bored out of my mind if I didn't.  Part 2 of the same class. Pregnant teacher leaves after about 3 months and we get this guy with a PhD in for the rest of the year. She had pulled me aside after class one day and said she'd just let me sleep since I didn't even need her to teach me anything. My grade drops from a 90+-100 to a 70something overnight because PhD guy doesn't like that I don't give a shit. NY has regents exams(standardized tests) but because he's a PhD he can rewrite the midterm. Half the class fails, highest grade is an 84. They argue for 20 minutes about grading on a curve, test was too hard, etc... all the while I'm trying to sleep.  Finally he relents, 'Fine I'll give everybody 4 points and /u/ThisVersionOfMyself gets 100 since he got a 96.'  I think to myself, 'ah shit.'  84 girl pipes up, 'He doesn't count, all he does is sleep all day.' (And there were other idiots in the class who would spend more time trying to fuck with me instead of focusing on the material they couldn't learn. The football QB got a little annoyed when instead of replying to him, I made his girlfriend who sat in front of him feel stupid, and that was the last time I ever heard from him after an empty threat.)  I raise my head off the desk, 'If all I do is sleep all day, got a 96, and the next highest grade is an 84, what the fuck does that say about the rest of you?'  And the 20 minutes of wind they've spent building up in their sails for the argument is completely gone.  Teacher, '/u/ThisVersionOfMyself out'  He started kicking me out of class 2 or 3 times a week after that, and never bothered to check with administration that I wasn't going to the principal's office, but hanging out in the band room."

It's based on discredited research about how alpha males will attract women and how they will become alphas by 'not caring about women' while they actually make their whole life about hooking up with said women.  They employ various tactics like 'negging' to get what they want instead of communicating like adults.   They then use these tactics to attract shitty women in bars and clubs which they then start shitty relationships with. Then they wonder why they only attract shitty people while treating said women like shit. Then rinse and repeat whilst wildly complaining about how all women are whores and golddiggers and not actually humans.  And FYI, it's not beautiful women that get ahead in life.

Some women do get special treatment, the benefit of the doubt, more lenient consequences, etc - simply because they're women.  Hired over other candidates to fill the diversity quota; automatically believed on rape accusations; lesser prison sentences;  it's all there, it very much exists. The only thing disputed is its prevalence, but that isn't the point.  The point is that shit sucks, and a sub that accounts for the times that shit doesnt fly isn't inherently misogynistic.

ProRevenge,2zh889,Jamesev93,0,Wed Mar 18 23:38:55 2015 UTC,"Hired over other candidates to fill the diversity quota   I see this claim a lot. Yet I've never once seen it backed up. Usually only employed by MRAs. How can you be sure they weren't hired because they were good and just happened to be women? This never seems to be the case, even though it's far more probable.   automatically believed on rape accusations    Yeah no, the statistics for rape cases directly opposes your  claim here. Men get off with sexual assaults where they've forcefully shoved wine bottles into women and gotten off because they were clearly 'asking for it'. Rape statistics doesn't look good for women no matter how you turn it.  Even though it does happen that women get off easy, I have yet to see any reliable statistic showing that this happens more to women than men, and especially attractive women. What IS a fact however is that attractive PEOPLE get off easier than ugly people. Now this is equally true for both genders.   The very idea of a pussy pass is honestly ass backward. What about all the times life has worked out better for you BECAUSE you were a dude? Do you even realise that this is a constant thing? Should this be called 'cockpass'? Then we'd have a sub reddit with more posts than all of reddit combined.  It's misogynistic because it's based on a false premises.

The Lady Death issues were from the 1998 series, labeled at $40 each and in mediocre condition. No bags or boards since the owner clearly had no idea they were supposed to be in them. Price sticker actually put on the cover of the book.  For funsies, here's what they're worth today: https://www.mycomicshop.com/search?TID=137381  Maybe he thought he had some of the 1994 issues, which only Issue #1 is really worth anything. And then only with a CGC grade and case.  Also, if it's not CGCed, it's worth 1/10th of the CGC grade, full stop. I see places selling them ""guaranteeing"" they'll CGC at a certain grade.

I've been browsing my city's CL listings for a long time now and since it takes almost zero effort to list stuff, constantly see people listing items for years on end, at basically the same price.

ProRevenge,2yrpub,music2myear,5,Thu Mar 12 12:56:14 2015 UTC,"Depends. Sometimes you only need one person selling a large assortment of an item in a category (at good prices) to bring the market to its senses.  9 years ago, our local C-list had hardly any posts in the bikes section, but prices were equally ridiculous.  Around the same time, I started to fix up decent MTB's (nothing spectacular, mostly Diamondbacks before the name was put on department store junk) from yard sales. I'd buy them for around $40-50, service them front to back with whatever they needed (almost always a new chain and small cassette cog), then put them on C-list to fund the classic hobby. I'd shove them out for $75-100 a pop, ready to go, while everyone else was asking $350 for the same thing off their garage rafters.  Within a year, prices on Craigs had smartened up - almost to that of yard sale prices.  About 7 years later, two other flippers tried the same. They jacked up the prices with lesser stock, but they had more of it. I lost sales, and let them have at it.  Now C-list is back to where it was 9 years ago, just with more bikes. It takes more than one to make that much of a difference."

I was about to wind him up some more but couldn't find my phone to video it and in my search he got back into his car and drove away. I wasn't sure which option I was going to use. Insults or to tell him that I love him.  A friend of mine was videoing an enraged guy (with a dead phone) and he told him that he couldn't put it on Youtube because their rules didn't allow for giant cocks. The guy was visibly restraining himself from punching my friend.  After a few incidents like this I really should just carry a dedicated point and shoot camera with excellent low light capabilities (another missed video drives that need).

CPS was called and the kids were taken away. Google for more, but in short, your statement needs a revision.   Well, we have to go on a few pieces of inferred information to get a complete picture. Then make an educated guess. I think in these circumstances, once the situation is though out, we're not talking about a child that was in any way endangered by being left in the car.  OP never mentions temperature, so we can reasonably assume that it is neither too hot, or too cold for a child to stay in the car for any extended period of time. In my state (FL) if the temperature outside is over 90, and the windows are not cracked, a policeman would break a window before waiting for a locksmith. The only thing they might do prior to breaking the window would be to ask the kid to open the door, if they could not open or unlock the door then they would ask the kid to move away from the window (or break an opposing side/ corner of the car), and possibly call their supervisor to get an OK first. Though I do believe that is questionable depending on the situation.  (If the kid is passed out from heat exhaustion, I don't think they would do more than call for EMT's during the initial stages. Due to no mention of any of this, the child was in no immediate danger of life and death.)  Because the kid was in the car, it's presumably daytime, or at least not a much more dangerous time to lock a kid in the car (darkness makes crime committing much easier to conceal, that crime being breaking into a locked car in a store parking lot).  Since it's presumably daylight, there are a lot of people in the area. The store has shopping carts, so it's probably a grocery store. Having worked for a grocery store, I know that there are very few times of the day where no customers are present, or within yelling range. Committing a crime in daylight in an occupied parking lot is not exactly optimal circumstances.  Kids yell and scream (or should be taught to) when they are being taken against their will. Stranger Danger, anyone?  Since this is a parent, you can assume that they care about their kid and locked the car. Especially in this day and age of over-protectiveness and coddling of children (Get off my lawn!).  This kid was not in any reasonable danger. It was more about the parent being an entitled douchebag."

CPS got involved and made a file for them based on ""unsubstantiated neglect"". Your logic sucks - you're saying that because the cops get called and the kids get taken away, that's a good reason not to do it. But the reason the cops get called is fear, not because of increased kidnapping. So, yeah, maybe don't leave your kids in the car, but the reason for doing that is crazies who are paranoid about ""bad parents"" and too lazy to wait around 10 minutes to see if the parent shows back up or if the kid is in distress. Not because of kidnappers or car thieves."

HR directors firing OP and sleeping with former boss has striking resemblance of Salome's Dance of Seven Veils for Herod and it's reward the head of John the Baptist. The end where OP single handedly puts end to his former company comes back to Samson's revenge for the leaders the Philistine,  destruction of the Temple of Dagon and all the people who were in it.

ProRevenge,2yfdcb,themcp,13,Mon Mar 9 18:14:32 2015 UTC,"Hey OP I think a lot of people believe the revenge was a little overkill because you didn't properly discuss the initial infraction by the bad guy. You can't gloss over that part man that's what makes the whole story worth reading.   By saying ""unknown liquid that my buddies decided was better to not think about"" you are actually leaving the audience out of the loop. We weren't there. We didn't smell it or see it. You can't expect us to understand what you did in that moment.  So, while I believe what you did was probably justified, bc fuck that Kid and his aftermarket paint job and stupid truck, maybe just edit the post for grammar and punctuation as well as lengthening the description of what happened to you.   That should help shut some of these haters up. It's certainly not petty revenge tho OP, like some commenters are saying. If anything, it's kindof a semipro revenge. impulsive, not so graceful or intelligent. But not at all petty.   Thanks for the story tho, OP. Nice work"

ProRevenge,2yfdcb,PoopymanV,-59,Mon Mar 9 15:36:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as others have noted this is rather petty and has a far more damaging effect then being sprayed by squirt guns. There's absolutely nothing super unique or clever about your story.   Additionally, if it's 4am, you haven't slept, AND your recognize that there are numerous grammatical and spelling errors in your post... perhaps next time it would be better to wait until you've slept so you can edit before submitting.  Edit: To the downvoters and the one comment I have to base your downvoting behavior on... Pretentious? Perhaps the post has that air, but that was not my intention. First, I was identifying my perspective on his post (basic nature of the act & grammar) and noting what I believed to be the impetus behind all of the negative comments already present. Additionally, the ""semi-pro"" nature of his prank, as noted by /u/MIKE_son_of_MICHAEL, could have been easier to forgive if the post were easier to read, so I suggested next time he wait a little bit longer before posting in the future.  Second, he likely caused serious property damage by vandalizing the car (which is certainly illegal and possibly felonious depending on the final total of damage). This did not sit well with me so I offered that sentiment within my comment as well.   Lastly, Reddiquette asks that we not downvote simply because we disagree with a post. For example,  I didn't even downvote the post despite not believing it to be in the right sub. Rather, I just put in my 2 cents and went about my day. With that said, however, I don't care about Karma so vote how you please."
ProRevenge,2yfdcb,thelandofnarnia,13,Mon Mar 9 13:52:36 2015 UTC,"You're defending yourself against accusations of pretension using words like ""impetus"" and phrases like ""perhaps the post has that air""?   It's not that you need a college degree to know those words, or anything, but your phrasing seems almost like you were trying to be pretentious.   I'm not saying you can't use phrasing like ""asks that we not downvote simply because..."" instead of something like ""says not to downvote just because...""  That's up to you. But if you do, people will draw certain conclusions about you that I thought you should be aware of."

ProRevenge,2y71tm,Ghostalker474,4,Tue Mar 10 21:47:03 2015 UTC,"Some context for my scenario on trucks and tailgating. I own a 2012 Toyota Tacoma Double cab with a short bed and 4WD, I also used this truck almost exclusively for work as a DirecTV contractor (Own truck, tools, ladders, etc.).  I replaced the plastic bed rails that came with my truck with 1/4"" thick diamond plate steel, which carried my ladder rack which has gusset supports to prevent bowing inward. I strap 2 ladders on that rack, a 20' Fiberglass extension with levelers, and a 28' fiberglass extension ladder, both ladders are held down by two 1000 lb test straps and anchored secure enough that they didn't have to be adjusted on a 2500 mile trip across the country.  I had also just moved to Tennessee to pursue (What I thought at the time) a better paying contract and as such was very unfamiliar with the traffic patterns and specific speed limits yet.  Scene: There I am, driving up an on ramp with a nice long sweeping left turn, Monster in hand, phone in GPS mode on the dash, dash cam rolling away (Personal choice, not required), blasting some music as I make my way to my next appointment. I'm at about 65 on this on ramp, and not quite positive on the speed limit on the freeway, it's either 60, 65, or 70 because we can, so I stick to the low end until I see a sign and figure I'll stick to the right lane anyways to make my exit when required.  Up behind me comes a brand new (2014) sleek, black Corvette, and he's just fucking going.  I hold my speed, tap my brake pedal to light up my lights and indicate I do exist... So he proceeds to tailgate me, OK, fine, he'll pull off to the side and pass when we're on, no big deal, my attention is on the road in front of me and not hitting anything there.  Merge over to the freeway, and the Corvette is still just staying about, at most 2 feet off my rear bumper, I see a speed limit sign, and it says 65, sweet! I don't even have to adjust, throw cruise control on, check my GPS, 4 miles till my exit. But the fucking Corvette driver wouldn't back off, or move over (there was room, plenty of room...)  About a mile before my exit, both straps on my 28' Ladder snap, what from I couldn't tell ya, but it was probably a combination of wind shear, sun bleaching, time and age, and when the front went, the ladder lifted up by the wind, which snapped the back... and flew right off... into the Corvette's hood. YAY! Now I get to make half a dozen calls to DTV, my Sup, my Customer, and the cops and insurance, plus I may be out a 28' ladder, and those aren't a cheap little item.  The cop took my statement, and took the Vette drivers statement, who came back and said the ladder was never strapped down and just flew off (Which, if true would have resulted in me being cited for failure to secure a load resulting in property damage to others), I showed the officer where the straps obviously snapped (the ends were pretty jagged and ripped along a 12"" length of the straps on the back, the front was a clean break oddly). And offered the officer my dashcam footage to use to verify I wasn't driving erratically (also claimed) and didn't make any sudden, dangerous moves (Brake checking, which, unsurprisingly was also claimed)  I ended up missing my last appointment, who ended up taking a reschedule from DTV, and my 28' Ladder was destroyed.  The officer cited the Vette for reckless endangerment and following too closely, whether any of those stuck, I have no clue.  My insurance fought with his, but the re-paid me for the ladder I lost, straps, missed pay (not that I missed anything, I went out to that job, just to drive by after, and it wouldn't of gone in, North facing apartment with no drilling allowed) and some additional compensation... Total came out to like 2 grand, which isn't bad for a 350 dollar hit and a few hours..."

I had just come back, with the kids, from one of those stupid, cheap circuses with my two older kids and an asshat neighbor kid.  My husband, in his wisdom, had decreed I take three little kids, one of them a demon spawn th see a motheaten elephant and Tiny Tim.  We parked the car in front of my apartment, I told the asshat kid to go back to his house, gathered my kids to leave the car.  I turned off the ignition and the engine gave a polite cough....and never ran again.  The car waited until we got home, but I always thought it took its revenge on me."

It's much easier to clear the next row of cars if you can start turning sooner without scraping the cars on either side.

And able to see the part of the vehicle that moves more (aka the front end, where the steering wheels are) while maneuvering.  Backing up is the most dangerous part of driving. Period.

You get your ducks in a row, and then you fuck with people.  AND why would you willingly disregard labor laws? This is ignoring the obvious morality of the situation; most labor laws already enforce what is the right thing to do. So there's already a moral imperative to following the law, generally speaking. But even if there wasn't, why leave yourself open to the possibility of large fines and harsh imposition? It doesn't matter if the law is just or not; ignoring it doesn't mean you are immune from it.  It just baffles me why employers wouldn't want to treat their crew well.

In the case where I got to experience this kind of thing it was a mix of ignorance and confidence that no one you hire will have the balls (you do have ample opportunity to choose their personalities in the interview stage) to report you.  The boss was not paying overtime in the US. She was originally a Brit. She had an American husband and son working at the same place of business (small company), so she really had no damn excuse for her bullshittery. She blatantly refused to pay for anything over 40hours even though every single week one of the printers(person) did about 6hrs OT to get shit done.  I finally did an anonymous report. I don't think she took that into account. You do not have to reveal who you are, or you can ask to remain anonymous after filing the report. The DOL has to protect you, and quite frankly it's a cheaper option than required disclosure of the person reporting the problem(s).  I got a whopping $47 from reporting them. A few people got hundreds, and I think the printer (poor loyal abused fuck) got over 1k. They still think someone else reported it. I've been tempted to go back and tell them I did it, but it's just not worth it.   I'm still in casual contact with one of my old coworkers from there, and she routinely calls me ""The Hero of X"" kinda like ""The Hero of Jaynestown"" and goddamn that feels good.

Now, not even considering the fact that this dude was actually rejected for a job based on nothing more than the colour of his skin, the words used in the message were VERY much problematic. A quick word on Dutch: calling someone ""zwart"" (""black"") is not much of a problem here, but calling someone ""zwarte"" (""A black"") on the other hand is borderline racist. Using the term ""neger"" (""negro"") is DEFINITELY frowned upon. And the guy reviewing the applications hadn't used the ""forward""-button in his mail-client, but the ""REPLY""-button.  So, our black friend received the message intended for the company's manager - racist remarks and all.

I was in the Lancaster/Palmdale area. I liked it alright while I was there, I had great neighbours, but I am glad to be back.  One of my neighbours was a former illegal. He now owns his house, put two of his kids through university and helped some of his family through university as well. A pretty stand up guy."

You're neighbor a former illegal, which means he has now obtained legal citizenship, and apparently doing well for himself and his family. I think that's fantastic. I would like to see more of that. it's possible that it's happening and I'm not aware of it.

ProRevenge,2y0bte,Qikdraw,2,Fri Mar 6 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"I personally have a little bit of a bad attitude because I've been in 2 car accidents with illegal people. No insurance, no driver's license, nothing.    I can understand that. My old illegal neighbour hated blacks because back when he was an illegal and coming back from jobs he got beat up and robbed a lot from some black people. No matter which way he went home it happened. Before he moved into the area he sat and watched the area to make sure no black families had moved in. If so he wasn't going to buy a house there. I understand why he feels that way, but its not ALL black people that are to blame and I feel he loses out by being that way. Its never good to hold hatred or fear of other people, it just brings too much stress into your life.   It has been my experience that ""we"" are nicer to people that immigrate from English speaking countries.   I think there is a bit of nationalism involved in that. If you're English speaking, you're alright because you speak 'American' and so are probably friends of America. Add an accent and all of a sudden you're looked at with suspicion, add in some colour and even more suspicion is added.  There still is a large racism issue in the US, not that Canada is really that much better. To most foreigners we are pretty much ok with, no matter the colour or accent, but its our Native population that gets most of the racism against them. Its the one thing I really hate about my country. And it happens with almost everybody."

We were in line at a bank, and I was a little behind her when she was at the teller.  She asked for the balance of her account, so she could withdraw some money.  ""What's the account number?"" Asked the woman teller.  ""Just moment.  I have here.""  My wife spoke as she pulled a slip of paper out of her wallet, where she had written the account number.  She slid the scrap of paper over with her ID to the teller.  The teller picked up the paper and said:  ""Oh good, someone wrote this down for you!""  This made my wife go from distracted and hurried to focused and incandescently angry in a heartbeat.  She started enunciating very clearly.  ""Why do you assume that someone else wrote my account number down for me?  Do you think I am uneducated?  Yes, I have an accent.  How bad is your accent in another language?""

The new phrase introduces a meaning that is different from the original, but plausible in the same context, such as ""old-timers' disease"" for ""Alzheimer's disease"".  This is as opposed to a malapropism, where the substitution creates a nonsensical phrase. Classical malapropisms generally derive their comic effect from the fault of the user, while eggcorns are errors that exhibit creativity or logic.  Eggcorns often involve replacing an unfamiliar, archaic, or obscure word with a more common or modern word (""baited breath"" for ""bated breath"").

ProRevenge,2x26x5,XarabidopsisX,88,Wed Feb 25 14:28:16 2015 UTC,"So in sales you have ""leads,"" which is a consumer who is interested in your product.  When that consumer buys your product, they are converted from a ""lead"" to a ""sale.""    It is my understanding that OP is a sales person for this company, and despite the combining of the three companies into one entity, he and the other sales people were frustrated because they could still only sell products from their original company.    It would be like if pep-boys and autozone joined together to form one company called ""car stuff,"" and if you were one of those sales people from pep-boys you are pumped, because now you have twice as much product to sell and get more commission, but your boss says ""oh no the pep-boys people can only sell what they originally sold at pep-boys, and the autozone people can only sell what they sold at autozone.""  This is probably frustrating because now lets say a customer is interested in a pair of expensive floor-mats that the new company ""Car stuff"" sells, and they contact ""car stuff"" to buy these and get you on the phone.  The problem is you worked for pep-boys originally, and this product was an autozone product.  You have to get that person in contact with another sales person that can actually sell them the product, which creates unnecessary work.  You all work for the same company now, you want to spend your time selling and making commissions and instead your wasting time sending customers to other sales people when there is no reason you shouldn't be able to sell them the product in the first place.    So OP was pretending to be angry and confused  customers, making it seem like customers were having a bad experience because they couldn't buy every product they wanted from any sales person.   OP was contacting sales people under fake names and asking them for products that OP knew the sales person couldn't sell them because of this dumb policy.    OP then threatens lawsuits under fake profiles he made up, and the policy changes.  This new policy change would allow all those customers that OP was pretending to be to get what they wanted, which was to buy a certain product from a certain sales person.  The CEO said to these fake customers ""ok you win, you get what you want,"" which means the customers can now buy what they want from who they want.   After all this happens, OP asks the CEO ""So did any of those consumers convert to sales?"" , which translates to ""so all those people who wanted to buy stuff from us but were upset that they couldnt, now that you changed the policy, did any of them buy anything from us?""  But OP already knew the answer."

I could see agreeing with you if he accepted the job with this policy in place, but when a dumb new set of rules is put in place by someone who doesn't understand your job functions, it can be frustrating.

I was extremely fortunate that my parents had a large umbrella policy on me since I wasn't driving at the time. My friend wasn't so fortunate and had ~$200+k in medical bills. I ended up with ~$350k. Neither of us wanted to go to the hospital since we didn't have any money and I didn't realize I was covered. We got talked into going and didn't find out until a month later about the other guys insurance situation. When we went to the police, they said the best we could do was take him to small claims court.  tl;dr Be sure to get uninsured motorist insurance!!

Have you had your lawyer make a demand for coverage under those policies?  Also, via his personal tax records and via either of his parents' tax records, have they ever employed him in either of their trade or businesses? Oftentimes parents will do that in an attempt to shield a bit more tax money. In this instance, did they ever use him in his vehicle for any business purpose?

Judges RARELY do wage garnishments on accidents, even ones where the other party is 100% at fault.

I'm not speaking for the guy above specifically, but the kid who hit me could afford it. I've dealt with constant level 3-5 back pain for the past 4 years. Injuries that will never heal nor get better. Only get worse over time. I've been through extensive physical therapy twice now.    While I realize that this next statement may seem jaded to your thinking but the idea of wage garnishment is not all that messed up considering what he did and put me through. He goes through a few years of hard times while I have to go through increasingly worse as time goes by.    can't ever lift and hold my kids. can't bend down nor crawl under desks anymore. (Work in IT). on pain killers probably for the rest of my life.   So while this may sound exactly like spite to you, I truly have no malice nor ill will towards the kid who hit me.  In fact, I feel sorry for him. He's probably never had someone there for him help in where he needs it. So, If I had sued him and by some miracle the Judge granted me wage garnishment from this kid AND the kid didn't declare bankruptcy... I wouldn't lose any sleep over it. If he learned a lesson from it or not, not my problem. His hardships would only help him down the road if he ever learned anything from it."

Its Pro because I handled it by browbeating them right back into submission. THEY caved in and gave me what I wanted. That's the revenge."

ProRevenge,2wfuna,alphamale006,22,Fri Feb 20 06:28:26 2015 UTC,"All the claims adjusters I have talked too say they don't get commissions on that type of thing. They get rated/graded upon completed claims in an efficient and cost effective way.  However, some companies (I'm told) offer bonuses and incentives to those that continuously get clients low-ball prices.    The problem becomes that many of these agents start to believe that they MUST get the lowball price every time and resort to shady dealings.  As many professionals in the business have told me, ""they believe that their companies money is their money and they want to hold onto it like their life depends on it."""

ProRevenge,2wfuna,JungleMuffin,8,Sat Feb 21 21:54:33 2015 UTC,"aaaaaye, when dealing with fair value of your vehicle don't expect to get the ""kelly blue book value"" because it is either not enough for your vehicle (you're missing money you could make) or too much (you're expecting more than you can reasonably get) because of regional differences in value.   I wouldn't normally recommend this, but if the vehicle is totaled, go to a car dealership and ask for a valuation on your car in good to fair condition and ask what the value would be. They will give you wholesale value, but it's better than the lowball that insurance companies can give.   This will give you an idea of what it's worth.   If you have a friend that actually deals with the auto industry this would be ideal. Ask him to value it."

I had a similar issue, and said that line, and within 2 hours they offered me the cost to fully repair my car (which was all I wanted) plus an extra $5,000 for ""pain and suffering.""  The funny part was the guy asked me if I was hurt, and I said no.  Then he kept asking me if I was in ANY way hurt AT ALL for even a few seconds, literally asking 5-10 questions, until I finally said something like ""Well, yeah, when your client hit me I felt the jarring effect"" and he said ""THERE!

Then the kicker came: Normally they only update age brackets at the end of the calendar year unless you called or filed a claim. My birthday is in January. Because of that, I was moved from [under 21] to [21-24] 11 months ahead of schedule, still with an effectively squeaky clean record because the other driver got a ticket for blowing the stop sign.

They have a staff lawyer sit in court where they are defending a number of claims – if it is 8 cases or 20, he’s on salary and is paid for the day.  The amount of the claim, if it’s deemed it will be paid, is moved to a reserve account and accrues interest.  The insurance company keeps that interest.

That's where good stories come from, fictional or not.   Anyway, it had this weird top layer that plopped out, then there was increasing resistance and thickness as the lower layers were exposed, as if it got stuck onto the cup and dried. The cup wasn't new. How it landed I can't recall in detail (that phrase came out like a cop in a court case) because I was more focused on getting it done quick and keeping an eye on the door making sure they wouldn't come out to destroy me, and the shit inside it was too disgusting to look at. I can say it was definitely a closed trunk. And the mixture probably wasn't just tobacco and spit,  did see a piece of wrapper sticking up when I peeked in. But I couldn't tell what else was under the top layer. For the sake of simplicity I summarized it as what was on the top layer prominently.   Writing this while eating chocolate.

ProRevenge,2vfz9l,DrinksWellWithOthers,2,Sat Feb 14 01:56:57 2015 UTC,"I found out my ex was cheating on me after she stupidly believed this mutual guy friend who told her I had been cheating on her. She decided rather than call me to talk about it, she would cheat on me with him (no doubt his plan all along, slimy fuck). I found out the next day from a friend who saw them at the bar they were at making out and then leaving together. She usually came home after going out so I knew something was up.  Luckily for me the bitch was deeply in love with me. Past issues led her to act as she did (trust issues) and while I had love for her, it was much stronger on her end. I began planning my revenge and a week later sprung it on her that I knew what had happened (at this point I didn't know she thought I had cheated). She tried to turn it on me by claiming that I had also cheated on her. Unfortunately the guy's story had some holes which I managed to shore up after calling some mutual friends with her on the phone with me.  I had known that her good friend had a thing for me and that my ex was interested in but had never tried anal sex. So I gave her the ultimatum via two options: a) she lets me fuck her friend in front of her while she watches and I get a month of anal sex and no vaginal b) she triples the month to three months of anal only and doesn't have to suffer the shame of watching me fuck her friend while she watches  If she couldn't make it through the three months or couldn't get her friend into it I told her I would break up with her and tell all of her friends that she had cheated on me and why. This would have been devastating to her because she had built up an image of herself as a proper lady and our friends (from other countries mostly) would use that against her if they thought she was slutty.   At first she chose the three months option but after about two weeks she was in some pretty bad pain (again she had the option to leave at any time) so she agreed to try and convince her friend. I said she better make it convincing. Ended up fucking her friend in front of her while she sobbed the whole time. I have absolutely no idea what she said to her, but they stopped being friends afterwards. Then I finished out the month and broke up with her. Told her she was a waste and a cheater and never to contact me again.  The only reason she allowed this was because before she cheated on me she truly did love me and probably wanted to marry me. Its been almost 10 years and I know from mutual friends she still hasn't dated or seen anyone. For the first year or two she tried to contact me a few times, but I just ignored her. Had a few girlfriends along the way, but now im engaged and happy. I would never do this again but just coming out of college and having a woman I did love cheat on me on the word of some fuck head sent me over the moon. Luckily I was able to take my revenge by destroying her mind, without ever doing anything illegal."

ProRevenge,2vdyj0,Mitch_Mitcherson,7,Wed Feb 11 08:21:10 2015 UTC,"Your timeline of events isn't well defined in your post. What I got from it was that the boss and wife treated everyone like shit. The kid took this for two years, but was finally sick of it and told them he was quitting and gave his two weeks notice. After that, the boss got even worse because he didn't like quitters, and that's when the kid decided to get revenge, during those two weeks.  But according to you he started the revenge far before he quit."
ProRevenge,2vdyj0,dalabean,0,Thu Feb 12 07:48:36 2015 UTC,"Who knows when he started.

There is only one person on the planet who knows how long it was going on for. I leave it to your imagination to decide. As the title reads, ""I take no credit.""

The welders start wielding torches.  The machinists begin making weapons.  The mechanics throw wrenches.  The designers try to look hard and pierce their flesh with stationary. Ape like sounds and neanderthal grunts combined with wolf howls fill the building and echo loudly throughout the property. The owners hide in their office.  The police fear the place and don't take phone calls.  Family members fear their loved ones have returned to the wild.  It is as if this place in this moment has been removed from the earth, transported to the Pliocene, where the Australopithecines roamed free to live, yet somehow that would be far more civilized by comparison to this.  For a period of time, it is as if we are in the end times, civilization collapsed.  The sight of grubby, semi clothed men cooking venison near burned out structures over an open fire is a sign that things, for now, are calm.  Do not approach directly.  Do not make direct eye contact. You would not wish to create an episode of tribal food aggression. Soon the beasts will sleep.  When they wake, with bellies full, they will think longingly of the days of good plumbing and return to the fold, their momentary lapse into barbarism forgotten and unspoken of."

I forget the bully's name, but he headed a gang/clique of popular kids that went out of their way to make life miserable for other kids in the school. I don't know what Riley did to irk Whatshisname, but it resulted in constant harassment. Riley swore revenge in as devious and secretive way he could. Riley told me he learned that gasoline would kill grass and planned to wreck havoc on Whatshisname's front yard, knowing the bully would be assigned the task of cleanup. I wasn't witness to the result, but I heard his chemical weapon response resulted in a nasty word that did not go away until the entire lawn was dug up. Riley was never caught nor even suspected.

The father was an alcoholic, the mother was a co-dependent. The kids were products of continuous beatings by drunk dad. The eldest boy (who threw the rock) was my age, but I was an 8 year old city boy newly implanted into backwoods country territory, and I was terrified of the kid. My revenge was bribing my older brother to beat the living shit out of him. Didn't feel bad then, blood for blood. Feels kind of bad now.

It was a really good experience for me because I was able to meet the people in courseware development and it led to some other stuff.  At the time it was kinda stupid because all of the trainers were arguing about who would get to do it. Honestly none of us knew it was anything valuable for our careers.   There were different classrooms, some better than others. I'd ask him to get a certain room.

But the real classic I remember from a local newspaper, involved big sized douche-bag lets call him DBag harassing a little almost homeless little old guy who we can call Loguy in a bar to show off. Loguy finally decided a quiet beer was not to be and decided to quietly leave. DBag followed him outside the bar irked he could not raise a response from Loguy. Physically stopped him using his bigger size to seize Loguy's old bike, grabbing the air pump(bikes used to come with a portable air hand pump) and snapping it in half, and while guffawing asked Loguy what was he going to do about it? Wrong question, wrong time. I took DBag a few moments to realize that while he was laughing his ass off at Loguy, Loguy tiny and old as he was, had pierced many of DBags vital organs with a little home made shank, starting up one leg going up across chest and down to the other leg. Yep DBag did not survive that lesson."

When the adults fail in their responsibilities, there should be no surprise that a young woman evened things out with a weapon.  I know a lot of times bullying takes place where adults can't see, but in this situation, I say, ""You go girl!"" and I'd say it to a boy too.   Why is it shocking that people resort to survival mechanisms when they are LITERALLY under attack by something/one that poses danger?

The second incident shows this, and she also clearly is the aggressor who took things too far in that one.  There's no mention of her ever even seeking the help of teachers, parents, or counselors.  Taking a sharp object, calmly walking over to someone and then cutting their face with it is not defensive, and it's not what happens in normal kids' fights. Think about that: you're giving someone props for slashing another person's face and risking yet another person going blind over the perceived spreading of rumors. The rest of her situational description just sounds psychopathic, which I don't mean as an insult. Plenty of people have psychopathic tendencies and are well adjusted.

ProRevenge,2tp19r,Shezzam,10,Mon Jan 26 19:24:00 2015 UTC,"The fact that the entire class laughed indicates that this behavior was expected, approved, and considered hilarious. Unless that classroom was unsupervised, the teacher failed in his/her duty to maintain discipline. Considering OP was just 'assigned to bring materials', ostensibly assigned by the instructor, then at least one incident of verbal sexual harassment was tolerated.  If OP is correct about the frequency, severity, sheer number of girls he harassed, it seems likely that several incidents were witnessed by teachers.  It seems unlikely that it was common knowledge among the students that he masturbated in the girls' bathroom, yet not a single teacher knew. Even the custodian should have noticed this (if he left 'evidence') and brought it to the attention of the administration."
ProRevenge,2tp19r,donutsandpizza,2,Mon Jan 26 19:58:55 2015 UTC,"I would see her actions as (possibly premature) preemptive battery.  Someone goes around robbing banks in a certain area. The robberies are timed intermittently, and geographically to seem random, but all the bankers, tellers and police know about an odd modus operandi.  This robber runs into the bank, shouts, ""Give me liberty or give me death!"" and shoots the closest person wearing red.   In addition, the police know about the robber, but don't really care because they are busy making the commissioner happy by increasing parking tickets (and therefore revenue) or (i.e. state test scores that affect school funding). The robber hasn't actually killed anyone yet, so there is lots of talk about 'protecting the citizens' and 'defending our town', but no actual action takes place.  If you are in a bank, and you are wearing red, and someone runs into the banks and shouts, ""Give me liberty or give me death!"" it seems reasonable to me that you would not be at fault for some sort of preemptive defense.    OP didn't have a choice of going to the bank daily or not, being a petite female in the orbit of the bully is harder to change than not wearing red, and the bully has established a pattern of verbal harassment followed by physical sexual harassment. Admin doesn't care because, while it will never be stated, the principal is so focused on raising test scores to increase school funding, that students' behavior is overlooked/ignored.  To me, the only differences are that there may be a slightly longer/unpredictable time between shouting and shooting; perhaps sometimes the robber may shoot someone wearing purple.   I actually find it comforting to know that somewhere in the world, a dean is considered helpful & involved, instead of placating (to parents), justifying inaction (to the school board), and outwardly apologetic for inaction (to teachers & students).   The most recent middle schools where I volunteered experienced the following incidents: a student bringing a glass bottle to school with the intention of breaking it and killing someone who 'was talking shit about her', a student trying to hide a baseball bat in a gym bag in order to 'break a mother-fucker's skull', & constant violence to the level that all school restrooms were locked except one. This restroom continually had an adult monitor that signed people in and out and listened for fights.  And that was just incidents that happened while I was on premises two days a week.   Each school has one resource officer (cop) for teachers to call if assistance is needed. Of course, if Bobby & Jamie are friends, Bobby will agree to start trouble at 2:10 pm to cause the RO to respond in room 113, whilst Jamie beats the shit out of some kid on the other side of campus. It was not completely uncommon for a fight to break out on Level 1 in the courtyard, just to cover for bodily harm being done elsewhere.  TL:DR, schools in my area suck at protecting students from violence; kids that want to survive sometimes have to be proactive. It's sad from the perspective of all parties involved."

Students: He likes her!  Me: Now they are around 11 or 12 and he grabs her arm and wrestles her to the ground even though she calls him a jerk and yells at him to leave her alone.  Students: That is just how boys are.  Me: Now they are 18 and he grabs her arm and--  Students: Oh, that's not okay.  Me: Really? How would he know? How would she know? How would you know? You just told me that for the first 17 years of these children's lives that you thought it was cute, sweet, and natural for a boy to grab a girl and be rough with her.  Students: Oh.

When I was a 10 year old, I had a bully torment every time my mom went to visit her friend in a different neighborhood. He was bigger and older than me and I was afraid of him. Finally one day he came walking up to me , talking all crazy and I just snapped. I told him get away OR ELSE. Of course he just laughed and tried to grab me...well I kicked him as hard as I could in his arm. It was some high ass karate kick that I had no idea I was going to do. He dropped to the ground crying. I was stunned and just ran away. All the adults laughed and thought it hilarious and said that he had it coming. I shattered some little bone in his elbow."

Fuck that shit so hard... the world is a fucked up place that that sort of stuff goes on and the girls just think they have to get used to it because no one in authority will ever help them.  I told my daughter if anyone touches her inappropriately (snaps a bra strap, for example) she can punch them right in the nose and she will not be in trouble with me.

I was the only girl in elementary school with a bra, and therefore was the target for all the snappers. I often came home with red lines on my back.

ProRevenge,2tp19r,Green_armour,4,Thu Jan 29 00:24:47 2015 UTC,"I believe part of it was that he was in the school system himself.  If I made waves, it would imply that since he couldn't do his job to protect his own daughter, he would be incompetent as a Safety & Security director for the whole district.   In his mind, if he did make a big deal of it, then any punishment meted out would be decried as 'special treatment' for the relative of an official. Thus interpreted as protection for an official's daughter and not other girls, and uneven consequences for perpetrators of harassment of one particular girl versus punishment for harassing any other girl.   Just as there is a lot of pressure on preachers' kids, there is also a lot of pressure on the families of government officials. The expectation was that I would always be cooperative, kind, helpful, obedient, and a model of good behavior. That's a lot of pressure for an 8 year old.   Eventually I just internalized that I wasn't worth protecting, so future, and more serious incidents, were kept to myself. It was pretty clear that my parents didn't want to be disturbed by any image that conflicted with the public image.  Obviously, I think it was irresponsible & shitty then, and even more so now that I'm an adult and can see the effects. It seems to be part of the US cultural expectation, to protect oneself and not depend on others to do so."

Instead of making an enemy you should tried to change his view of school and have a friend or an acquaintance, you should have studied with him to get to know each other and bond.  If this was too much hassle for you, then just be honest and tell him that you wont help him because of all these years of being bullied and cant expect your help just whenever he needs it.The ""clever"" way you took revenge is not complex, doesn't help anyone and has been done thousands of times before.    Your actions are a reflection of your age and anger towards him (all the curse words used in the story), but maybe I'm going on a tangent here and say that you are a different kind of bully. You undermine others with arrogance and your belief that you're smarter than them. Saying you're smarter is irrelevant to the story, simply say that by working hard you got to be top of the class. You used the word dyslexic and retarded to describe him, while you dismissed some comments here by saying they liked anal rape (wrong and just plain bad) and that reading it made you dumber.

[...] So the car behind me suddenly has to stop. He manages and still keeps a couple feet between me and him until <screeech-thump> I smile as I see the white SUV rear end the car behind me [...] I felt kind of bad for the guy behind me but it's always the fault of the driver in the rear in instances like this and the other driver's testimony to the officer reporting it would have been particularly damning. Enjoy the ticket, the court costs, time to go to court, damages, and higher insurance rates, asshole.   Maybe I'm reading it wrong, but it looks a lot traffic slowed, but OP pulled a full brake check to teach Raging Asshole (RA) a lesson. Driver 2 (D2) passes the full brake test, but RA rear-ends D2. OP then leaves D2 and RA to deal with insurance and cops in the rain, goes home, and posts on Reddit. So OP caused an accident in such a way as to not inconvenience himself, then left the others to deal with the fallout of his revenge. Asshole move is asshole move.  Furthermore, ""not at fault"" doesn't mean D2's insurance rates won't rise. This is especially true if OP lives in a ""no fault"" state (FL, MI, NJ, NY, PA,  HI, KS, KY, MA, MN, ND, and UT) - both parties' insurance will go up no matter what. My sister was stopped at a traffic light in the rain when a drunk driver rear-ended her twice; my sister's car was totaled for less than what was still owed, and her insurance went up.  RA is still a raging asshole, but OP is a passive-agressive asshole, and D2 got fucked by being between the two of them."

ProRevenge,2s0yh6,bilged,2,Sun Jan 11 10:40:02 2015 UTC,"In some US states, you are encouraged to just stay in your lane, passing on the right whenever anyone on the left is slower.  Staying strictly right might even (theoretically) be an offense.  Also surprising: You may pass red traffic lights in some states when making a right turn and there is no conflicting traffic, after you have made a full stop.  On a related note, not being allowed to do this may be surprising to, and expensive for, Americans visiting Europe."

ProRevenge,2s0yh6,Jboyes,2,Sun Jan 11 14:48:15 2015 UTC,"This won't happen because where I live 85 in the left lane is normal and accepted and won't even get you pulled over unless the cop is a dick, and even then you will get a warning.

ProRevenge,2s0yh6,evilbrent,-14,Sun Jan 11 15:37:37 2015 UTC,Nah.  I am the sort of person to cruise in the fast lane at 3km/h over the limit and if people come roaring up behind me at 15km/h faster than me expecting me to get out of their way and relinquish my place in the queue for them they can fuck right off.

ProRevenge,2s0yh6,GenghisChron,11,Sun Jan 11 08:26:48 2015 UTC,"It's not the ""fast lane,"" it's the passing lane. If you aren't passing someone, MOVE OVER. If someone wants (or needs) to be going 15 over, who are you to legislate morality?"
ProRevenge,2s0yh6,evilbrent,-10,Sun Jan 11 15:38:48 2015 UTC,"nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn-nope.  In every State in Australia the rule is that you're to move across as far to the left as practical except if you're turning right, overtaking, or if traffic is congested.  http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_reg/rsrr2009208/s130.html  Nowhere in the Act is ""congested"" defined. Obviously if there is no congestion then I will be moving across to the outside when it's safe to do so (ie, when moving across wouldn't put me into the stopping-distance of the car behind me). But if the traffic is built up enough that I judge that if I move across I'll be achieving nothing but getting myself boxed in............... then moving across is not happening.  And the law clearly states that I'm not obliged to. Rule 130 (2)(f)  It's not that I'm legislating morality. Aside from the fact that I think that it IS an immoral thing to drive at the speeds described above it's completely irrelevant. It's not that I think those speeds are immoral it's that I don't take them into account AT ALL. If someone wants to drive at 150% of the speed limit they are incredibly welcome to fuck off and make their own roads where these things are legal and acceptable. Seriously. I have friends with farms, and they ride their dirt-bikes as fast as they fucking like, there's no rules against it. On the roads that my taxes pay for, and which my friends and family drive on, it's not legal. So get fucked.  It is my right as an Australian to tell people to get fucked. It's also my right as an Australian to obey the road rules as written, not the road rules as imagined by hoons and arseholes."
ProRevenge,2s0yh6,renegadegrey,3,Sun Jan 11 10:31:53 2015 UTC,"That's cool. I'm totally in MA in the US and not Australia though. The speed limit on that road was 65 so I was going about 120% of the speed limit. MA also dictates staying to the right if you can with passing on the left, though passing on the right is legal if you are able. No one in this area follows the speed limit and if you do you are in danger of getting rear ended."

ProRevenge,2s0yh6,RIFT-VR,2,Sun Jan 11 11:27:48 2015 UTC,"That's nice. You're in AUS and not the US. The speed limit on most of the roads here is about 88kph. On this road it was about 104kph. Some places it's even as low as 70kph. Which is, in case you were wondering, ridiculously, ridiculously low. It's literally unsafe to go the speed limit and so nobody does."
ProRevenge,2s0yh6,evilbrent,1 point,Sun Jan 11 11:58:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been on Bay Area freeways. Fucking nightmare death traps. People driving all sorts of break neck speed, traffic coming to a complete stop for random reasons, then it clears for no reason at all and everyone floors it and starts jostling for a lane... it was like 99 maniacs for every normal driver.  I refused to drive and my sister had to do it all.  In Australia, what I'm used to, in medium traffic, is if the speed limit is 100 then you'll have 99 cars going at 99-103, staying in their lane, everyone moving together, no one really making any sudden movements, and one maniac weaving in and out trying to fuck it up for everyone. We've all got our cruise control on. The traffic flows. Nobody ever beeps their horn. Lane changes happen in an orderly fashion.  That one maniac can get fucked. In America I understand that it's the normal driver fucking everything up for the maniacs.   It's like that in China too. I remember how crazy insane it was on their freeways. I mean you had Mercedes treating out like a racetrack, right next to people driving WOODEN VEHICLES and three wheeled trucks and scooters and these weird contraptions that were kind of a lawn mower motor attached to a barrel, and families of five on one motor bike... and everyone just plummeting down the same freeway completely ignoring lanes, not indicating... I didn't the whole time just internally laughing saying to myself ""this must be normal this must happen all the time this is normal they are used to it this is ok I'm going to be ok"".  Came back to Australia and.... all the cars kind of just....  flowed together. It's such a nice safe feeling to be in a group of cars and know that we're all moving the same speed as each other. It panics me on the rare occasions that someone decides they need their car to go at a different speed to me.  (Which is why I hate hate hate hate driving in Sydney! It's utter madness. Their learner drivers are limited to 80kmh, even on a 110 freeway!! You'll be driving along with everyone doing the normal thing, and then all of a sudden everyone is literally swerving to miss this poor learner driver! Scared the pants off me when it happened to me last year with a fully loaded car and trailer! Sydney is stupid.)"

ProRevenge,2rehqj,2OQuestions,2,Mon Jan 5 21:52:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, wine coolers have wine. More here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_cooler  Malt beverages are a different animal."
ProRevenge,2rehqj,KingMong,1 point,Tue Jan 6 07:20:25 2015 UTC,"Wine cooler:       A wine cooler is an alcoholic beverage made from wine and fruit juice, often in combination with a carbonated beverage and sugar. It is often of lower strength alcoholic content, and it usually consumed by females or those with a low tolerance to alcohol.  Traditionally home-made, wine coolers have been bottled and sold by commercial distributors since the early 1980s,  especially in areas where their lower alcohol content causes them to come under less restrictive laws than wine itself. Because most of the flavor in the wine is obscured by the fruit and sugar, the wine used in wine coolers tends to be of the cheapest available grade. Since January 1991 when United States Congress quintupled the excise tax on wine,  most producers of wine coolers dropped wine from the mix, substituting it with cheaper malt. These malt-based coolers, while sometimes referred to as ""wine coolers,"" are in a different category of beverage – sometimes called ""malt beverage,"" ""malternative,"" or just ""cooler."" Bartles & Jaymes refers to their malt beverage as a ""flavored malt cooler"".  In Germany, however, wine coolers became popular in 2004, when the German Government imposed an extra duty on alcopops (pre-mixed spirits) of 0.80 to 0.90 euro per bottle effective August 1, 2004. To circumvent higher taxation, some German producers have switched to wine coolers, which are being marketed in the same way as alcopops.

So many red pillers see women as vending machines...put enough attention & 'helpfulness' in, get the equal amount of everything else out.  I am female and have encountered many assholes who thinks a dinner & drink = a trip to the back seat of the car. I actually had one drunk guy bite my ear when I declined to go to his place!!!!  The using worry happens with a lot of relationships. I have a female friend with a lot more money than me. She always wants to take me to lunch, but I don't want to feel like I'm taking advantage. So I let her pay once a month, and pack my own lunch the other times. Sometimes she'll pack a lunch, often she just hits a drive through.  I enjoy her company as a friend & person, and would never want either of us to wonder deep down if the reason I'm hanging around is for any other reason.   Of course we trade favors, information, etc. freely. I know I'm not supposed to keep a tit for tat in my head, but I do. I never want to be Scumbag Stacey.

Head over to /r/realgirls and find a nice looking chick (7-8, no tens that shit is unrealistic for this) make sure she is 20-21 because THIS!. Now, it doesnt matter if you live in rural Missouri or something, you make multiple ads on craigslist using multiple browsers. You post the ads in New York City, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles, & Dallas. Youre going for max population, and you also want a spread of time zones... see where this is going?  Make your ad a little tasteful, but with implied intentions. I personally prefer the ""Im a flight attendant, who will be in New York City, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles, & Dallas, etc late tonight and looking for a late night meal and possibly, no strings attached fun.""  Attach at least 3-4 pics to give your post credibility. Use the marks phone number but spelled out like Three-1-zero-555-two-eight-three...   Literally hundreds of calls/texts.

To almost all people to begin with, children are sacrosanct, but these people in particular, children are innocents who have a chance to make better choices and decisions, and to live a better life than they did.   A person who feels irredeemable will look on children as bright lights in a dark world- they are the essence of hope.  And to sully that innocence, to kill part of the hope of the world, and to darken what little light they see left, is the most gravest of offenses. Only the purely black hearted could do such a thing, and to those who feel separated from the world by their misdeeds and pasts, that sort of person will be treated as a wild animal dressed in the cloth of humanity, and will be dealt with accordingly."

An employer is responsible for paying its employees on time. In fact, here at least, they can be subject to significant fines if they pay too late. Moreover, as a manager if you don't recognize that you can cause significant problems for employees by not paying them on time, and that this might result in good people deciding to move on to other companies, you're an idiot.  Putting on my manager hat... if an employee of another manager came to me with their timesheet because their manager was out, I'd verify that their manager was out, and then, unless I saw something that stood out as ""significant irregularity"", I'd sign it. (And if I did see a significant irregularity, I'd ask questions and do what I could to verify, and I might very well sign it anyway.) Yeah, I'm risking some of the company's money on the expectation that they're telling the truth about their hours, but that's a measured risk against the fact that the employee knows I'll get them fired if it turns out they lied on their timesheet, and that I know that if I don't see to it they get paid on time a valuable person might leave the company. I also know that I am a valuable enough person that if it turns out they lied on their timesheet, the worst that's going to happen to me is the employer telling me ""please don't do that again.""  And after signing it, I'd fire off an email to their manager to let them know I signed it and why, and that next time they're away they should make definite arrangements for their people's timesheets... which can, if they like, be to have me sign them, but it shouldn't be left up in the air.  By chance, all of this actually happened with me, and I did in fact sign the timesheet and let the person's manager know etc. The result was, the person got paid on time, and the manager and their boss both thanked me for doing it, and I was asked to please sign timesheets for that manager's people whenever the manager was out in the future.   So, WS's job as a manager was to take responsibility for ensuring that people get paid on time.   as for waiting for the last day and running out of money. a lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on WS   Obviously you have lived too privileged a life to understand what it's like to be paid poorly and have to live from paycheck to paycheck."

ProRevenge,2p4gvg,themcp,-4,Fri Dec 26 23:58:23 2014 UTC,Obviously you have lived too privileged a life to understand what it's like to be paid poorly and have to live from paycheck to paycheck.   Or maybe /u/aierce wanted to say that OP should have planned better to get his timesheet signed and already asked his manager for options before they left on a vacation. The user is not commenting on whether OP's lack of planning led to him running out of money by the weekend. He/she is commenting that OP's lack of planning led to this whole fiasco.
ProRevenge,2p4gvg,_no_fap,6,Sat Dec 27 00:04:55 2014 UTC,"It's not your fucking job to work out how to get your timesheet signed.

ProRevenge,2p4gvg,Pinky_Swear,-6,Sat Dec 27 05:40:18 2014 UTC,"Depends on the company. Usually at places where people can get it signed by anyone (like in OP's case), the onus is on the employee.

ProRevenge,2p4gvg,AIWDI,144,Sat Dec 27 07:22:24 2014 UTC,I understand and agree not signing something you're unsure of but this was something every manager there has literally signed thousands of. If there was any fault with it WS could have gone to X Monday and I would have been the one fired if I tried lying to them.

Neither you nor I were there to witness the exchange, so we don't really know the context.  This was either a manager being a bit of a dismissive dick, or OP is too immature in the work force to know the consequences that manager may face if he signs to verify something with an error in it.  I have been in the Army a long time, and I have seen countless guys get hemmed up for ""pencil whipping"" inventories, taking someone's word for it rather than verifying what you are supposed to verify (maybe you haven't experienced it yet, but there are unethical people out there).  If I am supposed to inventory 100 items, and you are signed for 10 of them, I still need to see them, even if you tell me you have them and they are OK and even if you are a super great guy.  If you interpret that as a lack of trust in you then you need to get over it, I need to do my job and I can be held accountable for not doing it.  If you read my comment, what I said was that if you remove the emotions from the situation, you have a manager who is not comfortable signing for something he cannot verify, that manager might have seen a former coworker fired or gotten burned on a previous occasion for something similar.  As I said, it is not an excuse to be a dick.  If you actually have a problem with someone not wanting to put his name on the line to verify something they did not witness, I wouldn't want to work with you, either.  I wish you the best of luck in the workplace and I hope that practice never catches up with you.  Thanks for calling me an asshole, too."
ProRevenge,2p4gvg,courtFTW,2,Sat Dec 27 06:56:09 2014 UTC,Agreed and this company sounds like a shit show. What kind of company doesn't have a time keeping system or at the very least a fucking timeclock with punch cards. The people really at fault is finance for not creating/finding a better solution for the employees. WS was just performing standard CYA and in my industry it's quite common to do so. Look at it from WS's perspective if he signs it and you had been gone all pay period he is helping you commit fraud.

ProRevenge,2nyqg3,TrekkieTechie,38,Tue Dec 2 06:46:31 2014 UTC,"This seems more /r/pettyrevenge's speed IMO, but it's a fun story either way."
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,edderiofer,12,Mon Dec 1 19:46:11 2014 UTC,"Next time, use a more bewildering finger system. He'll never figure out what you mean when you put your index finger into a hook.  In any case, though, having never played baseball and having extremely small knowledge of the game, I really don't see what's wrong with looking at your pitching signs. It might not be good etiquette, but if there are no rules of the game explicitly saying that you're not allowed to look at your opponent's signals, there's really no reason for you to complain."
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,los_rocket_sturgeons,23,Mon Dec 1 20:30:01 2014 UTC,"Baseball has a lot of etiquette / unwritten rules. Sure it's not cheating to do things like steal signs, but you run the risk of stuff like this happening. Also, in my experience, I have found that Umps generally don't give kids playing ""lawyerball"" the benefit of the doubt."
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,CaptainK3v,4,Mon Dec 1 21:07:39 2014 UTC,"True in all sports really, nobody likes a rule bitch."
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,edderiofer,14,Tue Dec 2 00:59:35 2014 UTC,I didnt do anything illegal either
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,CaptainK3v,-2,Mon Dec 1 20:35:26 2014 UTC,"No, I suppose not, but it really sounds like you're complaining about him doing something that's perfectly allowed by the rules of the game. It's almost as if you're playing a game of chess, and you're giving your opponent the finger for castling simply because you've also castled beforehand."
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,los_rocket_sturgeons,15,Mon Dec 1 20:45:58 2014 UTC,"There are a lot of things allowed by the rules of the game that still make you a shitbag. I played tennis for many years and it is perfectly legal to cheer when your opponent makes a mistake. He loses a point like a moron and you can run around with your shirt over your head screaming ""COME ON!!!"" and ""GET SOME!!!!"" as long as you start the next point within 30 seconds(or maybe 90, it's been a while)."
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,Shake25,9,Mon Dec 1 21:04:49 2014 UTC,"I don't have a source, but apparently dunking used to be totally against the unwritten rules of basketball, and typically led to a hard, uncalled, foul on the guy dunking."
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,edderiofer,3,Mon Dec 1 21:09:38 2014 UTC,"It's used to be a written rule, that it was illegal"
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,CaptainK3v,3,Tue Dec 2 06:06:49 2014 UTC,But I'm really not sure why it's considered bad etiquette. It's not bad sportsmanship like your example.
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,edderiofer,9,Mon Dec 1 22:05:45 2014 UTC,"its kind of like looking at another players cards in poker, you aren't supposed to have that information so it breaks the game. I would argue that what is an is not acceptable i.e. bad sportsmanship is dictated by the players who play the game. And i know from a bunch of baseball players that this practice is seen as pretty scummy."
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,Four_Kings,6,Tue Dec 2 00:58:39 2014 UTC,"Ah, now I understand. Very well."
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,nacho_cheez,3,Tue Dec 2 01:02:50 2014 UTC,"Not it's really not like that at all. The entire point of giving signs to the pitcher is to speed up the game. Of course the catcher could go out there every pitch and simply tell the pitcher what to throw, but then a two or three hour game would become a six or seven hour game. That's why this unwritten rule exists. The catcher agrees to just communicate with the pitcher through signs, and the batter agrees not to be a dick and try to steal them."
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,matty86,2,Tue Dec 2 06:27:15 2014 UTC,"Out of curiosity, wouldn't it have been possible to get together with the pitcher and come up with a different system? 1 finger means throw a 2, 2 fingers means throw a 6?  Would that not have worked in fucking up the batter?"
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,bilged,2,Tue Dec 2 14:57:19 2014 UTC,"You've never played baseball.   Don't compare it to chess.   It's a gritty game with unwritten rules, don't try and understand it."
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,netsrak,-1,Tue Dec 2 08:05:52 2014 UTC,Repeatedly flipping off the opposing team could be grounds for ejection.
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,zerj,12,Mon Dec 1 21:06:50 2014 UTC,He isn't flicking him off he is telling the pitcher what to throw ;^).
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,autowikibot,3,Tue Dec 2 04:20:15 2014 UTC,"I agree, but assuming the Ump was watching that would probably have gotten both the pitcher and catcher ejected.  From the umps point of view he'd see the catcher give the finger sign, and then the pitcher throw at the batters head.  Pretty hard to argue that the pitch was an accident when you have a special sign calling for it."
ProRevenge,2nyqg3,LiirFlies,2,Wed Dec 3 21:59:07 2014 UTC,"Chinese number gestures:       Chinese number gestures are a method of using one hand to signify the natural numbers one through ten. This method may have been developed to bridge the many varieties of Chinese—for example, the numbers 4 (Chinese: 四; pinyin: sì) and 10 (Chinese: 十; pinyin: shí) are hard to distinguish in some dialects. Some suggest that it was also used by business people during bargaining (i.e., to convey a bid by feeling the hand gesture in a sleeve) when they wish for more privacy in a public place. These gestures are fully integrated into Chinese Sign Language.
