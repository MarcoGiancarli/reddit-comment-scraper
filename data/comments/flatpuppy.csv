flatpuppy,3aloi8,KHW1959,3,Sun Jun 21 13:02:00 2015 UTC,She started as a foster we took in from the local sheriff's department. Animal abuse for chemical burns. We had experience with treating burned victim's we adopted from house fires. We adopted her too. Her name is Sinder and is a Charpei mix. She does the flat puppy üê∂ all day. But my other rescues say her first name is Hurricane.
