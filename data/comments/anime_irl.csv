anime_irl,3e2fh5,JagYui,4,Tue Jul 21 16:31:43 2015 UTC,"Until I watched the anniemay, I've never heard someone call a euphonium a euphonium. I've been on band since I was in third grade, woodwind though, and I've never heard dining call it that. I've always heard people call it baritone"
anime_irl,3e2fh5,cuntscicle64,5,Tue Jul 21 19:25:35 2015 UTC,"They're similar. The baritone's bore is narrower and noticeably longer than its body whereas the euphonium bore truncates right at the end of its body and is more conical. The baritone's bell also usually points forward for use in marching band. Most schools will only have bell-front baritones so they can be used in both marching and concert ensembles in order to save on instrument costs.  The baritone has a sharper tone, though, and I always loved the mellow sound of the euphonium a lot better. It's not something that's really noticeable in a large ensemble, but it makes a hell of a lot of difference in a small ensemble.  EDIT: Corrected ""bell"" to ""bore"" when talking about the part of the instrument prior to the bell."
