AnimalsFailing,2yik0u,VenetiaMacGyver,2,Tue Mar 10 16:09:00 2015 UTC,"'A great scientist, when he was once asked how he managed to hit upon so much that was new, replied: “By keeping on thinking about it.” And indeed it may safely be said that unexpected inspirations are produced by no other means than by the expectation of them. To no small extent they are a success due to character, permanent inclinations, unflagging ambition and persistent work. How boring such persistence must be! And then again, from another aspect, the solution of an intellectual problem comes about in a way not very different from what happens when a dog carrying a stick in its mouth tries to get through a narrow door: it will go on turning its head left and right until the stick slips through. We do pretty much the same, only with the difference that we do not go at it quite indiscriminately, but from experience know more or less how it should be done.  And although of course a head with brains in it has far more skill and experience in these turnings and twistings than an empty one, yet even for it the slipping through comes as a surprise, it is something that just suddenly happens; and one can quite distinctly perceive in oneself a faintly nonplussed feeling that one’s thoughts have created themselves instead of waiting for their originator.'  -Robert Musil, ""Man Without Qualities"""

The cat then defecates, more rats get infected, etc.  It's fascinating.

AnimalsFailing,274fro,mtnbkrt22,2,Mon Jun 2 16:40:23 2014 UTC,What I like best about this story is it was because the puppy was just is excited to go for the walk. Now many of our fails are from over-enthusiasm? Poor puppy
AnimalsFailing,274fro,The_Rowan,1 point,Mon Jun 2 21:07:59 2014 UTC,Still better than most Masshole drivers.
AnimalsFailing,274fro,ohples,-3,Tue Jun 3 02:58:50 2014 UTC,"The parking break - for when you are parked. If the driver wasn't in the driver's seat, why was the parking break not on?  Perhaps as a driver a driver of a manual, this is more obvious, but still...  The fail is the driver here, not the animal."
AnimalsFailing,274fro,stevekez,2,Mon Jun 2 19:44:31 2014 UTC,Did you actually watch the story?
AnimalsFailing,274fro,SomeRandomMax,1 point,Tue Jun 3 09:50:27 2014 UTC,"No, why would I do that before making an accusatory comment?"
AnimalsFailing,25vyn2,LIATG,15,Sun May 18 20:44:34 2014 UTC,"To be fair that was a decent leap, just started way too early."
AnimalsFailing,25vyn2,camipco,4,Sun May 18 21:54:10 2014 UTC,Kept hold of the chewie though.
AnimalsFailing,25vyn2,shott85,6,Fri Jul 11 21:16:09 2014 UTC,you can actually see the moment when the dog realizes it's not going to make it.

I don't know what it is with some cats, but the lengths they will go to ruin and crap in your flowerbeds/lawn is insane. This guy on youtube set one of these up and recorded it chasing off the same cat multiple times a night for over a month."
AnimalsFailing,25jp4r,MeatPiston,2,Wed May 14 18:49:56 2014 UTC,It is?

AnimalsFailing,25gwxi,leekslap,5,Wed May 14 06:10:19 2014 UTC,"I like how there's no context here. We don't need to know what lead to one cat pushing the other off a bookshelf, because there probably was no good reason.  Also, failcat has a distinct look of ""ooof"" about its face on the way down.  10/10 would watch again, repeatedly."
