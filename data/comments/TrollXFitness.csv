TrollXFitness,3e4bsw,anakim_skywalker,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:07:45 2015 UTC,"Okay, got my real machine cranking here. I started at about 150 lbs, I've been into nutrition and clean eating for a few years. I wanted to tone up and not HATE working out. Most of my life it's been a chore. So I started with just running on a treadmill for 20 minutes with a 5 minute cool down, three times a week.    Then I decided I wanted to do a pull up. Just one. I rewatched Terminator 2 and I was super impressed with Sarah Connor's ability to take care of herself and be strong. So I started with free weights, and assisted pull ups. I got curious and moved to pull down machines, rowing, etc. So I added the arms after the 3 times a week run on the treadmill.   Unfortunately, I injured my back at work, so I was told running was off the table for now. I started walking 3.8-4.0mph on a 10% incline. This torches calories and makes your butt look glorious, and without sprain or heavy impact. I then tried the leg press machine; started at 100 lbs... 4 months later I am at 180 lbs.  I checked my gym's free fitness class schedule (it's FREE SO GO!): I attend Spinning and Yoga class (per my physical therapist's order). I had no idea that I had limited movement/mobility until I started Yoga. It was pretty bad... and it still is (I go 2x a week, since April), but you can't get better if you don't try. Anyway, I love the classes because there is accountability with friends you meet there. We are the goofiest, silliest Yoga class you will ever encounter. We have FUN.... at the gym... Wut.  My routine now is Mondays off, Tuesday Spinning & Yoga classes (45 min each), Wednesday off, Thursday Spinning & Yoga classes, Friday off, Saturday & Sunday, walking incline (25 minutes) and weight training (25 minutes). The only set dates are the classes, but I try to go 4-5x a week after work.   My diet is mostly plant-based. I do eat lean meat like shrimp and grilled chicken in moderation. I try to eat protein from plants, like black beans, lentils, quinoa, but I also eat a lot of eggs. I don't drink soda or carbonated beverages at all. I use MyFitnessPal and FitBit to keep my activity in check and make sure I am eating enough calories each day. I don't go without, eating well is easy and delicious!   If you have MFP: I'm missprecocious on there. If you have Fit Bit, this is my profile.  TL;DR: It's all about routine; and it's not whether I ""feel"" like working out... it's not if you ""feel like"" taking a shower or brushing your teeth, or paying bills... you just DO it. And that's how I changed my way of thinking about exercise. Yeah, it sucks and it's not as comfy as playing video games, but it's just a fact of what being a grown-ass adult and taking care and PRIDE in yourself is all about. Respect yourself, take care of your body. :)"

TrollXFitness,3e32c9,TripleUltraMini,10,Tue Jul 21 17:29:16 2015 UTC,Not to mention that not having to use stabilizing muscles makes lifts easier and less effective for training.

Because you know during those 3 or 4 days you feel like you're ruining everything and the hormones make it seem like the end of the world!   What I've actually done is buy some of those pre-cooked, ready to eat, chicken strips that you can put on salads. A bag of those when the hunger is out of control is super helpful.

Also I can't run because I get immediate shin splints so I work on the elliptical instead or swim, or row. When I did crossfit for a hot minute a couple years ago I subbed my runs for rows.

But this could have been the result of the teacher's style or any other thing. I went with 2 coworkers, one who goes all the time and one who had never been, and the coworker who'd never been before had the same reaction as me. It was weird.   It's always worth a try though!

The people I know who do it daily or nearly daily definitely have a superiority complex about fitness because of it (and the two people I'm talking about are my best friends and I love them to hell and back, but I can't help but roll my eyes when they talk about barre).

TrollXFitness,3bvyyo,orange_teapots,5,Thu Jul 2 20:31:30 2015 UTC,"I really loved my barre class. I went a few times before I stopped because of foot pain. I took ballet for 8 years when I was a kid and it was very similar, then with a few yoga and pilates moves thrown in. I have never sweat so much in my life. It's a great workout. I think you should try it. But you will be sore in places you didn't know could get sore, like your feet and ankles... give it a shot. Also, the class I went to had women of all different shapes."
TrollXFitness,3bvyyo,ginger_mafia,5,Thu Jul 2 18:15:37 2015 UTC,"I go to Studio Barre and love it. There, the classes are small and the instructors are really good about going to each person and correcting your form. Start off with weights way lighter than you think you can handle, because you'll be surprisingly sore the next day! There was a description on Buzzfeed I found hilarious (it's not that bad, though):   Thirty seconds in, and I started thinking that my patronus was the decaying body of a beached whale. I’m pretty sure every single other Lululemon-clad woman in class was a former ballet dancer who quit to become a bellybutton model. The instructor kept telling us to “Contort yourself into a position that is profoundly uncomfortable and inaccessible to most humans. Now, PULSE!” (I might be paraphrasing.) At one point we had to interact with a rubber ball in a capacity that, in certain cultures, would constitute marriage."

Your knees will be pretty ok. Generally speaking, you wot be embarrassed. However, if you are t flexible, prepare for some modifications. I think you'll have a reasonably good time. It's for some people, it's not for others. I have two friends who live and die by barre, but it's not for me personally."

I was so disappointed when I hurt my shoulder and had to start back over with the 25# bar, then stalled at 50# for so long.

TrollXFitness,3bnc8x,mandykat24,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:17:11 2015 UTC,"In short, I have poor scapular tracking on my right side (I'm guessing from lots of poor computer posture - slumping to my right - as a teen plus lots of heavy purses over the years) so my musculature is a little wonky and my shoulders are weak and always tight. I try to foam roll and stretch often and they've come a long way, but it doesn't take much to overwork them.   About a year ago, I had just finished benching fairly heavy (for me) although my shoulders were starting to ache a little bit. When I got up off the bench, and put my arms up over my head to shake them out with a light stretch and heard a loud CRUNCH in my left shoulder. If I had to guess, my left side was probably overcompensating for weakness in my right. Or something. I don't know. I probably should have gone to a physical therapist but at the time, money was very tight.   I had been to a physical therapist about my shoulder[s] before, so I just waited it out to see if it got better with rest. Then, when gentle ROM tests felt painless, I started with the exercises my PT had given me to correct my scapular tracking (mostly wall stretches and movements with low-resistance PT bands). My plan was to suck it up and go to a PT on my credit card if the pain stuck around with unweighted exercises and fortunately it didn't, but I unfortunately never did figure out what the actual damage was. :/"

Then I realized:    MyFitnessPal was showing me my daily average, because it no longer displays 7 day totals and doesn't reset to details for the day, so I was actually way under on fat and right on the edge of sugar, but most of that sugar is from fruit so I'm not really worried about it   and    I HAVE MANY CANS OF TUNA AT HOME.

TrollXFitness,3aqc27,ihaveafajita,4,Mon Jun 22 20:51:32 2015 UTC,"Haha! Well I did the ketogenic diet for a little over two months, which is <20g of carbs a day. That eliminated nearly everything sweet (including fruit!) and I think it really helped break my addiction. And I do consider it an addiction for me at least.  Now I don't crave sweets at all, but since I had to quit keto for unrelated health reasons I've found that bread and pasta are my biggest vices haha."

TrollXFitness,3alqnn,missprecocious,14,Sun Jun 21 13:31:00 2015 UTC,"I have a fitbit (flex) it; serves as a reminder every day that I have an incidental movement goal, syncs to my MFP account to let me know how many calories I've gained/lost from my days allocation due to exercise, and it has a simple user friendly dashboard that gives a sense of accomplishment and lets me track progress over time. I love it. And I exercise more because I wear it.  However, it only works for me because those are things that I personally find motivational and rewarding, I know a few people have bought them and then ignored them/only used them for a week and then threw it in drawer, so, your milage may vary."
TrollXFitness,3alqnn,PixelGlitter,7,Sun Jun 21 14:00:40 2015 UTC,"I have a Fitbit One. I was initially debating between that and the Flex (the Charge, Surge, etc. were not available at the time), but went with the One for several reasons:   It's more precise. I have a program where if I get 10k steps a day, I get points where I can redeem them for other things. For me, because I do take it seriously, the One measures steps more accurately because it can be ""clipped"" on rather than rest on your wrist, which may not provide as accurate a step count. I like it because I can go about two weeks without having to recharge it. It's easy to do so and charges quickly, but it's nice not having to worry about the batteries running out so often. I also have the Fitbit Aria scale, so it's really nice that the two are used in combination along with MFP for tracking purposes. Yes, it does do calorie tracking, but I don't rely on it for food tracking, etc.   If I were to do it all over again, I don't know that I would pick the One. It's nice, but I'd prefer to get one of the newer models with the heart rate monitor instead for a more accurate calorie count. I definitely like it, though, and find that it helps me stay on track. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I like mine.  I have not tried Jawbone or any others, so I can't speak to anything else, though."
TrollXFitness,3alqnn,dutchesse,4,Sun Jun 21 15:02:10 2015 UTC,"I love the One. No one knows I have it on,  and it definitely has helped me move more.  My daughter has the HR Charge, but I didn't care for it.  The challenges are fun too."
TrollXFitness,3alqnn,laridaes,6,Sun Jun 21 16:16:58 2015 UTC,"I have a Jawbone Up3.  I've used a tracker for going on 4 years now (Fitbits previously - I like the Jawbone's app a lot, and its look better than the Fitbit).    Basically, I use mine for sleep tracking and step count, and to remind me to move throughout the day, because I have a sedentary job.  Additionally, I can keep fairly good track of my caloric burn from exercise, which I use to help me stay on top of macro adjustments.  I'm not trying for weight loss, but I found a tracker helpful when I did lose some weight a few years ago.  The biggest thing the tracker alerted me to was how little I move throughout the day, typically.   If it's a lift day for me, and I work from home, I still need to get in a 3 mile walk to hit my 10k step goal.  The sleep tracking tool is also something I've really started paying attention to, because I have a tendency to skip sleep, and I shouldn't.  I like that the app suggests that I go to bed at X time so that I'll increase my sleep duration by 15 minutes; otherwise I won't lay down until I've gotten a neverending list of things done.  I think of mine as a tool for health management at this point, and I imagine I'll continue to use one for as long as they make them."
TrollXFitness,3alqnn,out_stealing_horses,5,Sun Jun 21 15:42:10 2015 UTC,"Love my One.   Accurate on my bra, doesn't advertise my tracking, keeps me honest about my activity level-not just during a workout but all the other hours.   I also track my sleep and have learned what it feels like to get refreshing sleep and how to plan for it better."
TrollXFitness,3alqnn,Pamzella,4,Sun Jun 21 15:43:58 2015 UTC,"I have a fitbit One.  Every week,  I am in a week long challenge with friends. Earn silly little badges and what not, see who can meet their step challenge for each day,  etc. It makes it fun,  syncs with MFP, there are daily challenges as well.  I don't like things on my wrist,  so the One suits me."
TrollXFitness,3alqnn,laridaes,4,Sun Jun 21 16:20:16 2015 UTC,"I have a Garmin Vivofit. If I'm completely honest, I really only use it as a durable, waterproof watch.  To be fair, it does track my movement while I'm sleeping so when I have a bad night, I can get the data points on when. That's a nice perk. Alongside that, it does count steps and calories (though I've found that counter way too inaccurate) and it tells time/date with a visible display instead of LED lights. Battery life is good for a year at least, and it has a red bar up top that shows me when I've been too sedentary and I need to walk around."
TrollXFitness,3alqnn,Gym_Legitimate,3,Sun Jun 21 15:28:08 2015 UTC,"I've been using a One for two and half years and I'm amazed at how tough it is :) I've broken the clips and wristband so many times (thankfully you can buy separate spares) but the device itself has put up with a lot of punishment. The only thing they can't withstand it seems is going through the washing machine which killed my SO's.   I found it a bit of a pain to get set up with having to try and measure my walking stride length and running stride, so I don't really trust it to log runs or workouts accurately and use a Garmin for better accuracy, but for keeping track of every day movement and steps it's great. FitBit syncs with MyFitnessPal too and their apps so you can keep on track easily."
TrollXFitness,3alqnn,TehRen,3,Sun Jun 21 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"I have a fitbit charge and absolutely love it. On my down days it really reminds me to move more. So on days I don't go to the gym I'm able to look at my step number and remind myself. It really motivates me to get off my butt. I take more walks than I normally do, I've lost weight and I am  meeting my fitness goals on the daily. I'm also a data fiend. I love seeing my calories burned, my steps taken and my distances. It's just all around satisfying to me."
TrollXFitness,3alqnn,WhyKnotHesHott,3,Sun Jun 21 16:38:33 2015 UTC,It's a good motivator. Only downside is when i reach a large amount of steps I always feel I should be rewarded with cheeseburgerz
TrollXFitness,3alqnn,Maximus46,3,Sun Jun 21 18:57:03 2015 UTC,"Oooh gurl. I have a Fitbit Flex and I love it. Motivates me to walk more, drink more water, count calories, etc. I will say that you get what you put into it. If you just wear it and sync it then yeah it's a $100 pedometer. But you can sync it up with MyFitnessPal and you can add in food, goals, sleep tracking, etc.  My favorite part is when you have other buddies with Fitbits you can challenge each other. I just got one for my mom for Mother's Day and she and I do the weekend challenge all the time.  If you get one head over to /r/fitbit so we can all add you as a friend!!"
TrollXFitness,3alqnn,QueefMode,2,Sun Jun 21 21:16:23 2015 UTC,I ended up buying a Fitbit Charge! Guess I gotta sync with my Trolls when I get it in the mail!
TrollXFitness,3alqnn,miller69,2,Sun Jun 21 21:28:30 2015 UTC,"I've got the fitbit chargeHR. There are things I love about it and things that I hate about it.   I'm not the most motivated person so seeing how lazy I've been during a particular day definitely helps me to move more than I would without it.   Having the fitbit has also changed my relationship with food.  I'm still not 100% but it's more positive than it was and I'm definitely making better choices. MFP never worked out for me, I just couldn't do it. But, the fitbit one I like and have surprisingly mostly stuck to.   That being said the distance calculator is not accurate for me whatsoever. I'm a slower runner averaging about 13 min/mi, longer distance, but no matter how long I run for my fitbit insists that I've run an 11 min/mi, inflating my distance traveled. Which is really frustrating because one of my current goals is to try to be able to run faster and my tracker isn't accurate.  Also I don't know if it's that I'm being that inaccurate with my food estimations or the fitbit isn't measuring my calories burned correctly but I've been doing this since February with a 500 cal deficit every single day (I almost never go over and when I do calories consumed are never above my total calories burned) yet I haven't lost a single pound. Not one. (It also could be a health thing, both my mother and grandmother have a thyroid problem.) But still I feel like not even 5 pounds? Come on.   In all I really recommend it as a good motivating tool to generally keep track of things like cals burned, sleep, steps etc. but I wouldn't choose it if I needed a more accurate device."

The chocolate is a very rich flavor and the vanilla is lighter and slightly salty (which I actually like a lot).    Some of the reviews I've seen claim that it is a lot harder, which makes sense because they don't use an artificial softeners (a claim they make on the packaging). I didn't find mine that hard and all and would compare it to the hardness of most ice creams when just out of the freezer.

I let myself have about half of my carbs worth of strawberries when I've had a REALLY good day, but there are some fruits I'm just going to have to kiss goodbye (like peaches glglglglglglglglglglg).

They also have a weekly ""Newbie thread"" every Tuesday if you feel more comfortable asking there.  I have fallen out of my exercise habits (depression, yay) and is trying to get back into them again. I am counting my calories and ride my bike or walk as opposed to taking the bus (when possible).

It's less about the caloric amount as it is making sure you're eating the right foods. For a while I used MyFitnessPal but was alloting myself a hamburger from A&W that was ""below my caloric intake"" for the day. Kinda counter-intuitive.

There was also a killer wind and a nasty steady drizzle.   There were a group of us all huddled in the women's bathroom (the only place with walls that cut the wind) trying to keep warm and complaining vociferously. Because after they shut the transition area, all I had left to keep me warm was a towel. I don't use a wetsuit, but today? Today I got it.  The water felt great!   The bike? Kiiiiillll meee. I thought ""must have gone three miles by now"" nope. Mile marker 1. Death. Death. Death. And I'm a swimmer, not a biker, so the bike is essentially a litany of ""on your left!"" Thank god it's only 16k.  The run went well, as when you can't feel your feet, they don't hurt!"
TrollXFitness,37yu5m,side_job,6,Sun May 31 15:48:46 2015 UTC,"I just want to say, you are fucking amazing. I'm a runner, I've run a marathon and a ton of shorter races and I am completely in awe of people who do Tris. I'm over here like ""Oh a 5K? I can push through that, no worries"" and then I think about doing it after swimming 750M and biking 12 miles and just nope the fuck out. People who do Ironmans? They are either gods or completely insane (or both). So, good job! You are awesome!"
TrollXFitness,37yu5m,side_job,3,Sun May 31 18:23:23 2015 UTC,"Aw, thanks! And uh, feeling's mutual, because I'm first and foremost a swimmer by previous training so I look at the really long runs and go ""ummmmm no."" I'm finally no longer looking super askance at a 10k, if I walk/run it. So. Marathons are impressive to me still.   I was especially terrified of the bike for the longest time, and it's still comparatively my slowest. But I'm right there with you on the people who do the Ironmans. Whaaat are they on? My sprint tri was a 500m swim, 16k bike, and 5k run. Non-metric is like... 550y, 10 miles, and 3.1 miles. That is long enough for now. Maybe in September I'll try an Olympic, buuuuttt... um. Only if it's warmer than this, because holy hannah that was cold and awful. Never wanna try that weather again."
TrollXFitness,37yu5m,side_job,2,Sun May 31 18:41:22 2015 UTC,Swimming is definitely where I would be weakest if I decided to do a tri.

TrollXFitness,36sy8e,i-like-tea,1 point,Fri May 22 20:56:28 2015 UTC,"Mine is 100g. I usually end up going to about 115g, though. I eat a lot of chicken, tuna, egg whites, greek yogurt, peanut butter, beans, and rice. I find I end up having to make room for protein supplements because I get so much from food."
TrollXFitness,36sy8e,lookslikewitch,2,Fri May 22 21:07:36 2015 UTC,And they're so expensive! Don't want to waste dat protein.
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,Just_a_villain,24,Tue May 19 20:29:33 2015 UTC,"Open it every day! And log random food. Wait, log only alcoholic drinks for shiggles. Although that might be depressing..."
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,the_fuzztron,22,Tue May 19 20:58:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know why I hadn't thought about that! Family holiday with kids, doubt there'll be much alcohol involved.. but it's in Italy, so I'm going to have ALL the carbs!  MFP would have a field day with its ""your goal for today is to stay under xx grams of carbs"" passive aggressive shit."
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,keto_mel,7,Tue May 19 22:25:27 2015 UTC,"I would just enter something like ""bad day"" (search it-it's in the database) and roughly estimate calories.  Don't lose streak, don't obsess over calorie counting, get back on track later :)"
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,barking-chicken,2,Tue May 19 23:10:19 2015 UTC,I would love every carb. For the pride. And bragging rights.
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,LevyWife,10,Wed May 20 12:54:21 2015 UTC,"you don't even have to log for your streak to continue, it just cares that you open the app every day. I haven't logged foods in maybe a month now because I use a different site, but my streak is still going as long as I go on the site or the app every day."
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,cindythebean,3,Tue May 19 22:49:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, I was away for the weekend and didn't log a thing, just opened the app once a day when it reminded me, and it kept my streak alive."
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,lll___lll,2,Tue May 19 23:21:12 2015 UTC,I used to have MFP as my homepage on chrome so even if I forgot I'd probably still log in. cheater.
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,baconpantaloons,10,Wed May 20 13:57:04 2015 UTC,Im at day 205 on my streak. I was away a few weeks ago and I just imputed quick calories to equal my daily total.
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,baconpantaloons,7,Tue May 19 22:02:32 2015 UTC,205? Woah. My hero!
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,lll___lll,8,Tue May 19 22:25:40 2015 UTC,Honestly even if you just log 1 thing it keeps your streak alive. You can do it!
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,TripleUltraMini,4,Tue May 19 22:37:24 2015 UTC,You literally just need to log on for your streak to be alive
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,makohigh,6,Wed May 20 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"Log 2 weeks of some random breakfast in advance, even if it's just coffee. Open the MFP App every day on your phone. Profit."
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,WeddingShit,5,Tue May 19 22:09:46 2015 UTC,I lost my 200+ day streak when I got blackout drunk at Coachella.
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,sygirl101,3,Wed May 20 15:37:09 2015 UTC,"I go through every week and log my daily gummy vitamins (15 cals) for the next 7 days, so even if I forget a day, I'm covered because I logged something."
TrollXFitness,36jc7p,lightbulb_feet,3,Wed May 20 14:23:11 2015 UTC,"I log in and log some amount like 2500 or 3000 (because let's face it, I'm not going to stick to any macro/plan)."

TrollXFitness,36fzss,Wandress433,1 point,Tue May 19 15:01:44 2015 UTC,It took me what felt like forever.  I hurt my wrist and had to slow down for a while.  Once it healed I couldn't seem to get over the 115 hump.  I decided to just go for it last night and was stoked when I did it.  Not long ago the bar was too much.
TrollXFitness,360jn4,bitchbebitchy,2,Fri May 15 01:54:49 2015 UTC,I know that feeling! I got into a pair of jeans last weekend for the first time in months. Best feeling ever.

TrollXFitness,35v64i,thepoener,2,Thu May 14 17:21:07 2015 UTC,Weighted squats? Also the best way to build muscle effectively is to eat above maintenance.
TrollXFitness,35v64i,pieceolisa,1 point,Thu May 14 17:13:23 2015 UTC,"I do, but clearly not enough weights! Increasing the amount I lift starting with tomorrow's workout (since today is a cardio day).   But fo reals?! I eat like, 1600-1700 cals a day as is! That seems like enough, no?"
TrollXFitness,35v64i,thepoener,2,Thu May 14 17:22:21 2015 UTC,Everybody is different in the amount of calories they need for muscle hypertrophy / strength gains but the rules are the same to for everyone. If you have a coach you can ask   EAT BIG  LIFT BIG  GET BIG
TrollXFitness,35v64i,incrediblythotful,2,Thu May 14 17:30:39 2015 UTC,Goblet squats and weighted glute hip thrusts! Increase the weight as you progress but those have my booty lookin better than ever!

I got one from Anker for Samsung Galaxy S3, and it can go two days without a charge if I'm not using it that much. Before I realized batteries were so cheap, I spent an HOUR at BestBuy trying to figure out how to cash in on my free battery (with insurance) until finally I was like ""fuck it""... they wanted me to call some other number and then have it shipped to my house in 10 days. Srsly just do Amazon."
