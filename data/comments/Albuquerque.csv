Albuquerque,3e2ipx,ellinator,6,Tue Jul 21 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"I know it's just horrible what we humans can do to one another. I recently got into a huge debate in the Denver subreddit about homelessness and our downtown area here. Someone was all mad that our 16th Street Mall is riddled with ""malicious vagrants"" and all because they were going to a nice dinner and had to uncomfortably explain to their kids that not all people have a nice home or dinners like they do. And I get that people might not like being face to face with the reality of homelessness but it is a reality and it needs to be faced head on for any kind of positive improvements to come of it. I was also mad because the OP made it sound like they were second class citizens as well as all being criminals. And the majority of them are honest good people just down on their luck and I hate how ostracized they as a community have become and their predicament will never be solved if people keep trying to act like they aren't people or don't exist. Ok sorry rant over I just get super worked up about that."

People are always talking about how there's nothing to do here. Everyone and their mother would love to have a better nightlife scene here. The problem, like I said, is our size.

Is the rest of the house any cooler?  Maybe set up a fan blowing out the window to pull in colder air from elsewhere in the house and exhaust the hot air that's in the room.  What about running electronics in the room?  People underestimate how much computers, game consoles, televisions, etc. can warm up a room.  My office runs about 10 degrees hotter than the rest of the house just because of all the technology in it.  Turn stuff off when not being used, get creative with how it's arranged, set stuff up so it exhausts towards the windows, with maybe the above mentioned fan to draw the warm air out."
Albuquerque,3dpprx,funbob,3,Sat Jul 18 07:04:08 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the living room feels maybe 5 degrees cooler. Otherwise, not really. D:  I don't have a fan, but I'll look into getting one tomorrow. Usually the only thing on in my room is the light/fan and my laptop. It used to be unbearable when I used my desktop so I always take that into consideration!   Thanks, I'll try some of these when I can! I suppose for now ice water will have to work so I can get to sleep tonight. I was hoping it would rain tonight because that always helps!"
Albuquerque,3dpprx,funbob,4,Sat Jul 18 07:08:44 2015 UTC,"Also, a portable evaporative cooler uses a trivial amount of power, like 60 watts for a small one.  Far less than an air conditioner, and will probably cool the room down to a livable level.  If you have incandescent lighting in the room, swap it out for CFL's and you'll probably have a net power savings plus eliminating a heat source."

If you haven't already, make sure the ceiling fan is going counter-clockwise.  Your AC system should have an option to run just the fan which would bring in cooler air from other parts of the house and be cheaper to run than the AC.  Other than that, do some shading, especially over any windows."

Albuquerque,3dnd6n,pottyglot,6,Fri Jul 17 17:57:17 2015 UTC,"It is the Caliornia based Caprenters Union. They have a building @ I-25 and Montgomery that they spent millions on and quickly found out this is not a union town. They are the worst kind of trolls and will only take those signs away when the protested company gives them money or a contract and signs a statement of intent (which can be held up in court) to only use union labor from now on.   The people who sit there and hold the signs have ZERO awareness of what's going on. They're given minimal compensation, a pamphlet to hand out, and will quite often act in an illegal manner when confronted about what they're doing - but APD has long considered it a civil matter, so unless they assault someone will not get involved.   They are a disgrace to our city and should be ashamed. I've often considered a counter protest at their building, just don't have the time to organize it, but if someone else does, I'm in. *edit: link to google for links to lots of info about it: https://www.google.com/search?q=california+carpenters+union+shame *"

Get a few more quotes and you will know whether or not one is trying to rip you off.   Also, read the quote thoroughly for each place. Chances are, you have more than just the compressor being replaced. A receiver/dryer is a normal part to replace at the same time.

I lived up there in the late 90's, by Ponderosa, we got two 2ft storms within a week or so, lost power, plow came by the house on my dirt road once after each storm was done. Driving 14 you may not need 4x4 but your local road you will if you cant call in. I worked up by Cottonwood and lived by Ponderosa and I was dirt poor (and made poor decisions obviously). I had an old Blazer I drove to my house from 14 where I parked my old 5spd Civic. My Blazer had a 4in lift and I still had snow up to the hood that year. On Friday and Sat nights youd have to contend with the joyriders- kids who stole cars from the city and took them to the land grants in Torreon. Not sure if that still goes on."

I don't think the 4x4 is really a necessity I had an Acura Integra and I can only think of one storm that made me late.   One perk I found was,  once my boss found out I lived in the east mountains,  any small storm in the winter and he would be like ""well cheebahjones, it's getting pretty bad in the mountains better head home."" so I had quite a few early days as a result.  Satellite Internet was terrible back then and I am sure it isn't any better now. I'm really surprised that no one has expanded service out there but I personally know that decent Internet availability would be a big deal for me now."

Don't wait to get settled in - I would HIGHLY recommend calling to make a gyn appointment as soon as you possibly can, and expect it to be a good six or eight weeks out.  My insurance pretty much limits me to shitty Presbyterian which I detest but has a very large network of doctors.  Regardless, getting a GP to see me for a physical and a gyn to see me for a pap both took about two months of waiting after I made the initial appointment.  And making the initial appointment took multiple calls (for the gyn, it took multiple weeks of calls because I only wanted a female doc and the only availability they had for weeks was with male docs)."
Albuquerque,3df9lz,Vanity_Plate,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"So do you recommend the doctor you are seeing for the issues I'm describing? I would love to make an appointment early, but I don't want to go to another useless gyn appointment where they tell me I should try taking advil."
Albuquerque,3df9lz,Vanity_Plate,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:52:41 2015 UTC,"My gyn provider is a Nurse Practitioner, Laura Onorato at Presbyterian Northside Women's Group.  I absolutely love her.  I had a skin rash on my legs at my last pap - since I had my pants off anyway, I went ahead and asked her about it.  She listened carefully, took a close look at it, and really dug deep about the possible causes, things I might be able to try myself, and she offered a referral to an all-woman derm group.  She truly went above and beyond.  I questioned my instinct to recommend her at first because it sounded like you might end up needing a specialist; however, if your issue is just getting someone to listen to you and take you seriously, Laura will do that.  And if a specialist is what you need, she will facilitate that too.  Edit: Pres Northside Women's Group 505-823-8787"

The staff there is very helpful.  Before I knew how cheap it was (or that it even had a gynecologist) I went to Southwest Women's Health. I like them. Big office so you'll have most of your appointment with a nurse normally, though I never went in for anything very serious so you might have better results.  My only problem with them is that they sometimes charged me a co-pay when I wasn't supposed to have one. I haven't disputed it yet but they also haven't notified me either. Co pay for me was 40$"

Thats something you have to concede with him not having the backing of big corporations. This is a huge risk to me. Given how limited the power will be of any dem president working against the do nothing/block everything GOP congress, why should I vote for Bernie? We will be risking giving the white house back to the GOP while they control congress. Scary shit."

Albuquerque,3d7k8y,tysk,4,Tue Jul 14 03:21:03 2015 UTC,It would be easier if you gave a description or posted a photo yourself of the dog.  Then if someone believes it to be theirs they can show you a photo as proof.  Otherwise you could get a million descriptions of various dogs from owners seeking their pet.
Albuquerque,3d7k8y,LifeByTheHornss,-3,Tue Jul 14 03:52:20 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying but I gave the specific area and I  think that's enough. I don't want to give the dog away to the wrong person. If someone believes it's their dog then they have to prove it to me, not the other way around. Hopefully the dog is microchipped and animal control can find the rightful owner in the morning. /r/albuquerque is a pretty small subreddit and I don't think I will get that many people claiming the dog in the first place."

Albuquerque,3dawes,GreySoulx,7,Wed Jul 15 04:01:29 2015 UTC,Well I think we should warn anyone who wants to drive in Phoenix about your elevated traffic fatality rate.  2013 Fatalities per 100k.  Phoenix: 11.8 -- ABQ: 7.6  2012 ............................ Phoenix: 10 -- ABQ: 9.2  2011 ............................ Phoenix: 8.4 -- ABQ: 7.8  2010 ............................ Phoenix: 10.2 -- ABQ: 7.3  2009 ............................ Phoenix: 9.9 -- ABQ: 8.5  2008 ............................ Phoenix: 9.7 -- ABQ: 8.4  2007 ............................ Phoenix: 12.5 -- ABQ: 10.3  2006 ............................ Phoenix: 15.2 -- ABQ: 12.2  2005 ............................ Phoenix: 14.3 -- ABQ: 13.1  2004 ............................ Phoenix: 13.4 -- ABQ: 14.2  http://www.city-data.com/accidents/acc-Phoenix-Arizona.html http://www.city-data.com/accidents/acc-Albuquerque-New-Mexico.html  So there you have it.  You're more likely to die in a crash in Phoenix every year for the past 9 years.
Albuquerque,3dawes,Vanity_Plate,-4,Wed Jul 15 05:07:13 2015 UTC,"Haha, good one.   Its true, Phoenix has a lot of deaths for being so flat and straight.  Of course Phoenix has almost 300% more people so of course their ratio will be larger."
Albuquerque,3dawes,ChorizoYumYum,5,Wed Jul 15 05:19:27 2015 UTC,so of course their ratio will be larger.   Not so.  Los Angeles has a fatality rate lower than ABQ despite being much more populous than Phoenix. http://www.city-data.com/accidents/acc-Los-Angeles-California.html

One thing that pisses me off emensly is that about 1/3 of ABQ drivers never use their blinkers. Its almost as if they don't know they exist. They just weave in and out of traffic w/o a care in the world. However compared to the rest of the world ABQ is pretty mild. Try driving in Tel Aviv, or Mexico City.

Albuquerque,3dawes,GreySoulx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:44:41 2015 UTC,"Well I think it's fine to be mad. I live here now, but have worked all over the country. And my opinion (maaaan) is that Albuquerque drivers are horrible. In fact, hands-down the worst I've experienced in the US. Not all drivers of course. Not even most. But the worst of them are far worse than anywhere else I've lived.  Wrong turn signals, inability to accelerate and merge, blowing through red lights without even slowing down, blowing through red lights while speeding up, not signalling, driving slowly in the left lanes, aggressive driving by parades of idiot racers, not holding a lane, turning across multiple lanes at the last minute, chest-thumping morons chasing each other in a rage.... these are things that I've seen almost everywhere. But I see it almost daily here. The only crappy driving manoeuvre that I've seen more frequently elsewhere is cutting through the grass onto the frontage road when an exit is backed up. DFW wins that one. The closest thing I've seen here is bro-trucks turn across the median up over the curb to turn onto the I25 N ramp instead of waiting to U-turn at the light.  As someone up there pointed out, we're average. But that says nothing about what the distribution looks like. We could have the best drivers in the country, AND the worst. And we'd come out average if the distribution was right. But it's the worst drivers that will fuck you up, ruin your day, and back-up traffic."
