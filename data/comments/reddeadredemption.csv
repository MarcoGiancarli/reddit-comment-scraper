reddeadredemption,3du7sl,in54n3w4yn3,5,Sun Jul 19 14:54:09 2015 UTC,A remastered version of this game would be great. The dueling in this game alone would be worth me buying it.
reddeadredemption,3dpb6t,Iheartmypleco,4,Sat Jul 18 03:45:32 2015 UTC,I think you can find Red Dead at gamestop for like 15
reddeadredemption,3dpb6t,dabisnit,2,Sat Jul 18 22:24:13 2015 UTC,Didn't you just post this almost identical thread a few minutes ago?
reddeadredemption,3dpb6t,chrismichaels3000,-1,Sat Jul 18 05:24:13 2015 UTC,not in this sub  tee hee
reddeadredemption,3dpb6t,chrismichaels3000,2,Sat Jul 18 05:43:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you did. In THIS sub."
reddeadredemption,3dpb6t,Gamer9131,3,Sat Jul 18 05:48:58 2015 UTC,Oh crap.  You are right.  One was supposed to be for /r/gaming.  Sorry. I was a little blazed.

reddeadredemption,3dpb6t,Oldschool64bus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:07:12 2015 UTC,Whoa. Why. Im glad he posted it. If I had a 360 or...RDR Id get right on with him.
reddeadredemption,3dpa6z,Iheartmypleco,3,Sat Jul 18 03:35:27 2015 UTC,You can get GOTY edition of RDR (with UN) for $15 at GameStop.
reddeadredemption,3dpa6z,chrismichaels3000,2,Sat Jul 18 04:03:38 2015 UTC,yeah but amazon gift card
reddeadredemption,3dpa6z,SuperSmith_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:45:24 2015 UTC,Amazon might price match.
reddeadredemption,3dpa6z,Chef_Goldblum,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:55:11 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the 360 crew.  RDR is one hell of a ride, enjoy. I fully recommend Undead Nightmare as well.  I would recommend the Orange Box and Portal 2 to add to your collection.  The Assassin's Creed series is also entertaining."
reddeadredemption,3dpa6z,JeSuisFoxyTrot,3,Sat Jul 18 04:09:27 2015 UTC,"I just got the Orange Box for 4 bucks on the xbox live marketplace, have yet to play anything besides portal"

reddeadredemption,3ddftm,ifaptoyoueverynight,7,Wed Jul 15 12:09:43 2015 UTC,It just needs a cougar getting blown up by dynamite.
reddeadredemption,3ddftm,SuperSmith_,4,Wed Jul 15 16:28:22 2015 UTC,Great picture. Reminds me of Torquemada
reddeadredemption,3ddftm,apricot-jam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:46:22 2015 UTC,Yes! Best sniping spot.
reddeadredemption,3ddftm,Blockcocker4,2,Wed Jul 15 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"This is really the essence of RDR. The atmosphere is so Wild West, it completely takes over the game for me.   A great atmosphere means that the developer was successful in emerging you in their game. I have this with only a few games, but RDR is definitely one of the best of those!"
reddeadredemption,3ddftm,osunlyyde,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:03:12 2015 UTC,"This is a small sub to begin with, and the game is 5 years old--not a whole lot of breakthrough content in here. It's nice to have new things to look at. So speaking for myself, I welcome posts like this. May not be directly RDR-related, but it's relevant, and something that fans of the game can enjoy."
reddeadredemption,3cx5tl,Superheroicguy,7,Sat Jul 11 15:45:45 2015 UTC,"Some of those things you listed are common tropes among tons of Westerns, and many many other Westerns also had influence on RDR.   The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly for its guns, bridge explosions, and government's influence in the West. Unforgiven for its revisionist tone, retired gunfighter character, and disillusionment with the glory of the Wild West. Rio Bravo for some more archetypal lawmen, the John Wayne attitude, and the name of the in-game river. Once Upon a Time in the West for revenge themes, tone, costumes, and more guns. Joe Kidd for some of the Mexican revolution story themes, and the sniper rifles. The Searchers for its incredible landscapes.   There are probably 200 more movies with direct influences on the game. I recommend just looking up the top 100 Westerns on IMDb and working your way down the list!"
reddeadredemption,3cx5tl,Funslinger,3,Sat Jul 11 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"Don't forget 'A Fistful of Dollars' and 'For A Few Dollars More' to complete the Man with No Name Trilogy along with 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly'."
reddeadredemption,3cx5tl,sleepyslim,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:52:44 2015 UTC,"I'd  also recommend McCabe and Mrs. Miller,  Dutch's camp kind of reminds me of this.  Also Jeremiah Johnson."
reddeadredemption,3cx5tl,HolidayCards,2,Thu Jul 16 04:09:05 2015 UTC,This is definitely true but I agree with OP in that rdr has the same sort of ojw vibe. It's apparent to me the game designers have a certain fondness of ojw. Also the the shooting the rope scene is just undeniable.
reddeadredemption,3cx5tl,Bajikenballs,3,Sat Jul 11 21:30:49 2015 UTC,"It's not that the RDR game designers used ""Outlaw..."" as an inspiration for RDR. It's that they used the ""Spaghetti Western"" genre of westerns as an inspiration and model of RDR, specifically the ""spaghetti westerns"" of Sergio Leone. Clint Eastwood used his experience acting in Sergio Leone's ""spaghetti westerns"" as a basis for his direction and acting in ""Outlaw...""  In other words, ""Outlaw..."" was inspired by ""spaghetti westerns"" just like RDR was similarly inspired."
reddeadredemption,3cx5tl,chrismichaels3000,5,Sat Jul 11 22:11:52 2015 UTC,(ง ͠° ͟ل͜ ͡°)ง
reddeadredemption,3cx5tl,I_Like_Spaghetti,2,Sat Jul 11 22:14:14 2015 UTC,And in town design every town in the game is based off of a town in a classic western movie. The most notable for me was the main town in 310 to Yuma is Armadillo in the game and one of the towns in Mexico is the town from Fistful of Dollars.
reddeadredemption,3cx5tl,Waxy473,3,Sat Jul 11 22:18:15 2015 UTC,Did you notice the oil drilling settlement with Daniel Plainview character?
reddeadredemption,3cx5tl,Bajikenballs,4,Sat Jul 11 22:27:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I would spend a lot more time expiring that area if there were less Bobcats
reddeadredemption,3cx5tl,Waxy473,3,Sat Jul 11 22:33:20 2015 UTC,"God damn bobcats. When you're looking for one, they're impossible to find. But, when you're just riding through or picking flowers or whatever, you get attacked by 5 or 6 in a row. Fuckin' bobcats."
reddeadredemption,3cx5tl,chrismichaels3000,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:40:36 2015 UTC,"In the beginning of RDR I got a big ""High Plains Drifter"" vibe but that might be because that's my favorite western."

reddeadredemption,3cturq,ifaptoyoueverynight,11,Fri Jul 10 18:57:38 2015 UTC,This is really cool! The riding in RDR was awesome and really made the game for me compared to other games with riding around that time (looking at you AssCreed).
reddeadredemption,3cturq,what_the_foxhat,8,Fri Jul 10 20:55:59 2015 UTC,"still the game to beat when it comes to realistic horse movement, nothing looks quite right in comparison, even the latest and greatest games like the witcher 3."

reddeadredemption,3chb15,slambojones,9,Wed Jul 8 19:07:54 2015 UTC,Hell of a show. I speed ran it on HBO Go. Ian McShane is sooooooo good. And I agree. I could see that world being brought to life in a big way in the RD way.
reddeadredemption,3chb15,Matt2486,7,Tue Jul 7 23:53:42 2015 UTC,Hell YES. Maybe it could be set it in the California gold rush or something. Perfect setting for lawlessness.
reddeadredemption,3chb15,SEEENRULEZ,4,Wed Jul 8 02:39:33 2015 UTC,"Oh god that would be incredible. Or they could introduce multiple characters like in Gta V, allowing you to either play as a soldier in the civil war era or a native indian during this time in the rocky mountains or such dealing with whites taking your land. I only see the next RDR as taking place pre RDR so this would be a perfect theme to go with."
reddeadredemption,3chb15,ifaptoyoueverynight,4,Wed Jul 8 09:28:22 2015 UTC,It was watching Deadwood for the first time recently that got me back into RDRedemption.
reddeadredemption,3chb15,BookStacker,3,Wed Jul 8 01:21:08 2015 UTC,"You know that in the ""real"" Deadwood the foul language was nothing like it is in the show, right? While the language of the residents and visitors of the real Deadwood was definitely scandalous for the times, their definition of ""scandalous"" was very, very tame by today's standards. The showrunner made a conscious decision to make the language of the characters ""foul"" by today's standards instead so that the viewers would experience that same sort of shock when hearing the dialogue."
reddeadredemption,3chb15,chrismichaels3000,2,Wed Jul 8 05:56:00 2015 UTC,"I get that, but I wasn't talking about the foul language.  I'm just talking about the quality of writing, the extensive vocabulary, and old fashioned style of speaking etc."
reddeadredemption,3chb15,Funslinger,2,Wed Jul 8 21:36:56 2015 UTC,"I love that show, but the dialogue is almost impossible to follow. Maybe one character could speak like that, using those weird forgotten words, and the protagonist could tell them ""I haven't understood a goddam word leavin' your lips, mister."""
reddeadredemption,3chb15,isamlegend,2,Wed Jul 8 04:50:14 2015 UTC,Sounds like Boyd from Justified

reddeadredemption,3chb15,ThePeaceMaker707,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:15:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely agreed. Also like the dialogue in the remake of True Grit.If you haven't seen it, I recommend it. Highly entertaining, and you're sure to love the language."
