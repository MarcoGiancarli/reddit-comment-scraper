Bombing,3dtf4y,qnzkingofcrunk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:50:36 2015 UTC,It depends on what the misdemeanor is for though. I'm not doubting finding work with a felony is harder though.  Edit: oh we're just talking about a writing type misdemeanor.
Bombing,3dtf4y,FUCKCOST,2,Sun Jul 19 23:38:47 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter. You don't have to disclose misdemeanors on a job application. They can only ask if you have been convicted of a felony
Bombing,3dtf4y,redlefthanded,3,Mon Jul 20 16:15:27 2015 UTC,Regardless if they want to submit a background check depending on the company and the job they can also look to see if and what misdemeanors you have been charged with. I'm aware on applications they only ask if you've been convicted of a felony though.
Bombing,3dtf4y,FUCKCOST,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:08:45 2015 UTC,"True, you can find out just about anything if you are motivated to do it. I would guess these days, many employers do it."

Bombing,3dtf4y,AdmiralDan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:48:08 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for CA, but in this state, graffiti is considered a ""wobbler"", meaning it can be charged as a either a misdemeanor or a felony, and it's really up to the judge or prosecutor. Trust me, you can do jail time for both, but in this case you are talking about employment so...  If you have a misdemeanor on your record, no big deal. You do not have to disclose that to employers. Not saying they won't find out if they really wanted to dig, but you don't have to tell them anything.  You DO have to disclose if you have been convicted of a felony, and that can be a huge problem. Many employers just won't give you the time of day. There are ways in this state to get felonies expunged from your record after a certain period of time, and probably hefty fines (don't ask me, I don't know for sure what it involves, only that it can be done) and that can be a godsend when you are looking for work.  If you do have a felony conviction, all I can say is, I echo everyone else's opinion and would suggest going into a trade or the arts."
Bombing,3dtf4y,redlefthanded,2,Mon Jul 20 16:28:16 2015 UTC,"In Australia (At least in my state), there are three types of crime.   Summary offences (Most traffic violations, cannabis possession, possession of graffiti implements etc. Our equivalent of a misdemeanor really)- a payable fine and no record.  Minor indictable offences (Low level DUI, marking graffiti, minor assault, etc.) in which you go to court, face a magistrate and depending on the penalty and the severity of what you did, maybe get a criminal record for it. I know of a few people who've been caught for graff and because they were young (18-21 ish) it didn't go on their criminal record.  Indictable offences (Serious crimes like battery, possessing a traffickable amount of drugs, rape, murder, etc.) which are really serious obviously.  My gut feeling would tell me that an employer may overlook a minor indictable offence depending on what it's for, your qualifications and suitability for the role, and the company itself. I'm interested in studying graphic design and I feel like that field might be more lenient than a more conventional one, especially if you have the right skills. But who knows, anything can happen haha"

Not so long ago the only way to see graff was to get off your ass and explore or look at a mag, movie, etc. Now millions of pictures are at your fingertips.   I use it a whole lot - posting, commenting, following. It's pretty great with a growing community. I also explore a shit ton and put in work. Nothing can beat (nor can I put into words) the physical attractiveness of the colors and shapes, rather than just staring at pixels. On a side note, its a huge advantage if you need to get the gears in your head moving if ideas run out in the black book."

""Heres some tips regarding rustos...  The 2x Painters Touch (2xPT) series are the way to go. Outside of that, stick to basic colors. The basic Red, Yellow, and Blue, cover very solidly and smoothly, but I'm pretty sure the painter's touch series has a more sensitive valve to give you a little better control, plus a bit more solid coverage.  When it comes to black though, I avoid the painters touch. I have had more than a few of them clog up on me, even after a ridiculous amount of shaking (to be fair its usually in colder weather). But, to be safe, I stick with the straight forward rusto glossy black. I've checked out the '25% more' cans of black and i haven't had one clog on me, but they ALWAYS need a good shaking, even after sitting for like 30 minutes, and it makes me paranoid so i just go for the standard glossy.  When it comes to white, 2xPT is great and I've never had an issue. They cover almost as well as Kilz, which is in my opinion the brightest white available, but its formula is easier to work with, less messy, dries faster, etc.  When it comes to caps, you should just get adapters and use male caps. The female caps out there aren't horrible but they usually clog quicker and are more expensive, and you'll start to go through a lot of caps (hopefully). The bottom line with female caps is that they haven't been tested and perfected to the extent and for as long as the good male caps have been.  I like the sekt adapters, but you should definitely get more than 1. I would even start with like 5-10. They're little plastic pieces that fall out of your pocket and can be difficult to find in the dark or even in the light once they're covered with all different types of paint. Once you adapt, you'll never go back(?) but seriously i carry an adapter on me just in case i pick up paint because its that much added over the stock caps.  As everyone has said NY fats are just about the way to go. I use Pink dot fats too. They fit right on a Kilz can perfectly and will give a wider flare than a NY depending on the pressure of the can being used. On most rustos they're just about as fat as a NY Fat but will clog a little quciker with the thicker colors. I also would recommend a few Rusto fats too. They have a thicker downstem that works on some of the other cans, like krylon short kuts and other stuff, but I stock up like 85% NY Fats, 5% pink dots, 5% rusto fats, 5% other stuff."""

Those jackets sold fine because no one buying a North Face Denali jacket on eBay gives a shit about the performance of the jacket; they just want it for how it looks. They've probably never worn a real NF jacket, and don't even know what they're wearing is fake.  However, if you got a MTN can filled with shit paint, I imagine you'd be able to tell the difference.  EDIT: The exception is that sometimes you can find the brand's manufacturer, and get unbranded merchandise at a super low price. The only scenario I'm familiar with is carbon-fiber mountain bike frames. 2 of my friends managed to track down the Chinese manufacturer that builds bike frames for big name manufacturers. The carbon frame would have cost a couple grand locally, they got their frames for under $800. The only difference is that the frames aren't painted or branded."

Bombing,3ckykh,TheRealFlyingFuck,5,Wed Jul 8 18:46:24 2015 UTC,"This is weird... The video is full of really high quality graffiti, a lot of cool and original ideas, but it's failing to transmit it. It's full of unnecesary things that distract me, and there are almost zero takes of the final pieces. And everybody here wants to see the final piece! It's not a video for people who actually do and likes graffiti, but cool video..."
