I am not referring to a free falling object. ex. If an object is moving 100 mph at a constant speed (for this case let us negate the acceleration of the object due to gravity), can it enter a planet's atmosphere, and if so will friction cause the same effects as that when the shuttle used to enter the atmosphere. If it will not, what is the maximum velocity that an object must enter the atmosphere before it's temperature increases due to friction?"
Physics,3e2fb4,urides,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:17 2015 UTC,"I don't have time to go over this in-depth but friction is not the main component in heating. The compression of air in front of the object causes the bulk of the heating. Second, 100 mph is suuuuuper slow. Like, molasses slow. When an object is in orbit around a planet, it isn't just parked some distance in space. For example, the ISS is currently travelling around 17,000 mph. Slowing down an object to around a constant 100 mph would require a ton of fuel/propulsion.    So, assuming you can get an object to maintain a constant 100 mph on reentry, then (at those speeds) you shouldn't encounter almost any heating because there is enough time for the air molecules to be displaced rather than compressed."

I guess I may have the wrong idea of temperature, so first how do we measure temperature?   For simple things, we measure it with a thermometer. It's just a tube of some substance whose density depends on temperature in a known way. When you put the thermometer into whatever you're measuring, it reaches thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. The condition for the thermometer and surroundings to be at in thermal equilibrium is that they have the same temperature. While the mercury in the thermometer heats up or cools down, it expands or contracts, and we can tell the temperature by reading off how high the mercury column ends up in the tube of known volume. The important part is that we measure the temperature of some system by putting something else in thermal equilibrium with it, and that two bodies in thermal equilibrium will be at the same temperature.  For more complicated things, like measuring the temperature on the surface of a star, we look at the spectrum of light given off by the star, fit it to a black body spectrum, and then we can find its temperature using the peak wavelength emitted and Wien's law.   It's just the energy of the molecule, but how is energy actually measured?   The simple relationship between kinetic energy and temperature really only holds true for an ideal gas. More generally, temperature is related to how the entropy of the system changes when you change its internal energy.   I always imagined it as the speed of its random movements, which would mean relativity would make things seem much colder the faster they moved relative to us, right? Where am I going wrong with this thought process?   Nothing is inherently wrong with that thought process. That's one of the viewpoints taken in the Stack Exchange post I linked to. But as they show in the post, how the temperature should vary between frames is ambiguous, which is why you should really only talk about temperature in the rest frame of the system."

Physics,3dylot,jenbanim,6,Mon Jul 20 21:24:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. What happens at the Planck scale, including whether or not force unification occurs is still very much up for debate since most if not all of our current experimentally-confirmed theories break down at much lower energy scales.  A slightly more tangible unification scale, is the GUT (Grand Unified Theory) scale at which all the fundamental interactions except gravity are predicted to be of similar strength, and perhaps unified. This is based on extrapolation on the ""running of couplings"" of the the electroweak and strong interactions.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_unification_energy  What is ""running of the coupling""? Given a Quantum Field Theory description of an interaction, you find that the coupling ""constants"" that describe the strength of the interaction are not really constant. The strength of the interactions depend on the ""energy scale"" or ""length scale"" at which the interaction occurs, and in different ways depending on the structure of the theory. For example, the strong force is strong at low energies, but gets much, much weaker at higher energies, in a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_freedom  Assuming our current understanding of the interactions hold up to much higher energies (which is almost certainly not the case), you find that the electroweak and strong couplings seem to converge around ~1016 GeV. That is what's called the GUT scale."

Physics,3e2am9,Snuggly_Person,7,Tue Jul 21 16:22:27 2015 UTC,"If the resonance is real, then it is possible that it may be formed by a mechanism that is identifiable as ""uniquely stringy"". String theory can be confirmed if this is found, but not falsified if it isn't.  More to the point, asking for low-energy falsification or confirmation of any theory of quantum gravity is just asking to be incredibly lucky, barring some other theory-specific reason to expect it. Nothing we know of suggests that the matter content of our universe is something that's logically inevitable, and we don't know of any mathematical or physical constraints which would force a unique or nearly unique ""reasonable"" completion for the standard model. This is true whether we're talking about string theory or not. Asking a theory to uniquely predict particle content as your criteria for falsifiability is asking for a thing we have no present reason to believe is actually possible. If we lived in a world where telescopes were very difficult to build we wouldn't say that Netwonian gravity is unfalsifiable because it can't compute the distance to the Sun from first principles. If we couldn't build particle colliders we wouldn't say that QFT is unfalsifiable just because it contains a large number of models (far more than string theory, obviously). Saying that the theory must make predictions we can detect when we know that we're practically blind to the entire physical arena of interest seems incredibly strict."
Physics,3e2am9,enslaved_robot_boy,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:45:06 2015 UTC,Exactly true.  The practice of science is the reasonable application of theory and experiment. A framework without meaningful experimental constraints is problematic in the extreme.   How long can a framework be explored without meaningful experimental support before it is time to redirect funding and theoretical effort elsewhere?
Physics,3e2am9,johnnymo1,6,Tue Jul 21 17:07:46 2015 UTC,"You may be surprised to learn this but string theory research is really not swimming in dough these days.  No theory of quantum gravity has meaningful experimental support, nor do we expect at the moment that they will get any for a long time. Does that mean we should not be exploring theories of quantum gravity?"
Physics,3e2am9,Snuggly_Person,6,Tue Jul 21 17:10:09 2015 UTC,"First things first: most research in string theory is, to some degree or other, independent of its role as a theory of quantum gravity. Insights from string theory have done wonders in furthering our understanding of QFT for a while now, and its role in providing new routes for QFT calculations and alternatives for QFT models is not going away any time soon. Most efforts in string theory go toward intrinsically understanding it better, which fully applies to this role.  More in line with the quantum gravity aspect, it's not clear that there is a consistent alternative to string theory. You're free to think that such uniqueness is unlikely, but the fact that it's not a solved problem is important. When people ask for a falsification what they normally mean is ""something which string theory says can't happen, but that isn't already excluded by QM, SR, or GR"" since there are obviously tons of potential falsifications which are confirmed by current evidence of those building blocks. The trouble is that without competitors, we don't know if such a thing exists. String theory might almost be an inevitable conclusion of combining GR and QFT. Whether or not you believe this to be true, we currently can't say that it isn't, and the inability of anything else to step forward means that the lack of falsification is also the responsibility of potential falsifiers. If someone had some logically distinct route that string theory could always match observationally that would be a properly damning sense of ""string theory is not falsifiable"" because it's infinitely accommodating. But we don't have those. The requests for falsification might be the same thing as asking to falsify QFT without falsifying QM or SR: you basically can't do it, since the final theory does essentially nothing more than parametrizing the possible theories which follow both QM and SR. It's not at all clear that the issue with falsifiability lies on string theory's shoulders, since no one actually knows what quantum gravity without string theory looks like, if it exists. If string theory had any competing theories, it would be obviously falsifiable since it would be distinct from the other theory, which would make predictions of its own. The only reason we can even have this discussion is because those alternatives don't exist at present. That's not exactly for a lack of trying, which is a point for string theory's current leading role in quantum gravity research, not against it.  EDIT: To make myself clear: If A implies B, then asking ""give me some potential falsifications of B where A is still true"" is a nonsensical concept. Assuming the truth of A, B is unfalsifiable because it's impossible for it to be false. Any complaint about falsifiability has to distinguish ""arbitrarily flexible"" from this kind of implication (because logical implication from a minimal collection of experimental results is exactly what we want) and you aren't doing this."
Physics,3e2am9,CondMatTheorist,4,Tue Jul 21 18:06:45 2015 UTC,"How long can a framework be explored without meaningful experimental support before it is time to redirect funding and theoretical effort elsewhere?   Um, it kind of has gone elsewhere (unless you mean you want it to go into different theories of quantum gravity, but I'll be charitable and assume you aren't so silly). Contrary to media depictions, string theorists (and other quantum gravity folks) make up a tiny, tiny portion of academic physics, and get an extremely narrow slice of the funding pie. This is probably as it should be! Indeed, it would definitely be shortsighted and serve no one to make that slice zero.  As far as redirecting theoretical effort, there's an art to doing research that relies on elements of creativity and personal aesthetics. If Ed Witten stopped getting paid to study string theory, it wouldn't motivate him to design higher efficiency solar cells. Those epsilon dollars are just gone, man. Nobody wins."

String theory has become a patchwork endeavour since the days it was outperformed by QCD for modelling strong interaction.  Any other scientific theory that doesn't agree with measurements is discarded, whereas for string theory it has only been a series of mathematical patches thrown in to keep it alive.  Why?  I just can't fathom it."
Physics,3e2am9,Snuggly_Person,2,Tue Jul 21 18:47:39 2015 UTC,"What mathematical patches? Have you even read the introduction of a string theory textbook? Let's be honest here: do you even understand QFT and gauge theory? Frankly no one can possibly say this and have any idea of how string theory actually works. The only free parameter in string theory is the string tension. The diversity of solutions is due to the large number of vacua. It was always known that there wasn't a unique solution to string theory, just like there isn't a unique solution to any other theory of physics, and the extent of this was fleshed out into the general landscape concept in the early 2000s. String theory doesn't disagree with any measurements at all, and never has, because there are no measurements that the Standard Model can't handle. There is nothing for any theory of quantum gravity to potentially disagree with, unless it generically requires the standard model to break down very uncharacteristically early. The issue, to the extent that there is one, is that it's possible for it to agree with a large collection of possible measurements, which dashes some hopes for falsifying it based on available low-energy information. Particular models within string theory (like the MSSM) are falsified all the time, much like they have been in QFT. This is known as scientific progress.  If any modifications to GR are true, string theory dies. If any particles are found that do not follow gauge theories, string theory dies. Most of the generic requirements of string theory are already proven true (gravity is the weakest force, gravity is universal, need particles based on gauge theories, fermions exist, SR, QM, and GR are all true, etc. etc.) To say many more specific things than that we'd need to have a better understanding of how to map out the solutions of string theory itself, and we certainly won't get any better at that by arbitrarily deciding to stop looking at string theory."

The lennard-jones potential (not even sure it is correct name) represents attraction at a distance and repulsion in close proximity, making it a good approximation for simulating simple interaction between atoms. It makes it possible for particles to stick to each other at equilibrium distance, and form a crystal. I actually enjoyed playing with such a sim more than with gravity. Because you can see a ""sound"" wave propagation, for example. I need to revisit it, computers are more powerful now :)."

But how can it ever reach infinity?"
Physics,3dxn8y,Yozhura,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:39:15 2015 UTC,"It makes a huge difference.  It replaces your sum in the denominator with a difference.  It makes your final answer larger then the radius of the Earth for instance.  It also makes velocities larger than sqrt(2GM/r) special.  This velocity is the escape velocity, because the solution to your question goes to infinity as the velocity approaches this velocity.  Velocities higher than this give nonsensical negative answers because there is no solution where all the energy is potential energy, since the object will keep traveling with non-zero velocity forever.  To answer your confusion in other posts, yes you can ""escape"" gravity.  Just because the gravitational field is non-zero arbitrarily far away doesn't mean you will eventually be stopped by it.  If you have a velocity higher than the escape velocity, ignoring other stuff like the sun and other planets, you will keep traveling away from the Earth forever, with your velocity approaching some minimum velocity determined by how much higher your initial kinetic energy is compared to the Earth's gravitational potential energy.  Edit:  Looking more at your solution above, you made a mistake in the beginning.  You wrote the formula for the gravitational force and compared it to the kinetic energy.  You should not have little m's in the gravity terms.  This will leave the little m in 1/2mv2 , which makes your units work."

By the way, I didn't say that physics textbooks in general don't deserve such writers, just that such writers shouldn't waste their time trying to reinvent freshmen physics with calculus, which is already described in dozens of well-established books and the topic won't really benefit from another (I'd even suggest that wanting to write such a book already betrays a startling lack of taste).

Physics,3dwedh,grapp,3,Mon Jul 20 02:22:10 2015 UTC,"I'd guess crazy high energy photons that could damage anything near the reaction, or perhaps even at long distances. But if the reaction was between hydrogen and antihydrogen, you won't get radioactive atoms out of the reaction because there aren't enough nucleons in the elements to start with, so the radiation would be created in the reaction and then none after. That's just my guess, but it seems to make sense. If the material was of high atomic number then there could be radioactive resulting atoms. But maybe any matter/antimatter explosion would destroy any atom so there couldn't be any radioactive resultants. Or maybe any matter/antimatter reaction could knock neutrons out of common elements and cause them to become unstable. The bottom line though is we don't know.  The radioactivity from nuclear reactions are caused by unstable nuclei, so if no unstable nuclei are created, there wouldn't be lasting radiation."
Physics,3dwedh,jstock23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:34:59 2015 UTC,wouldn't the whole thing just turn into a radiation shell if in space and into a radioactive pit if planet side.
Physics,3dwedh,KaptainKraken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:01:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you should be specific. There is gamma radiation, beta radiation, alpha radiation... Gamma is high energy photons, beta is electrons, and alpha is 2 protons and 2 neutrons. I said there would be initial radiation, depending on what the reactants were, but it wouldn't leave radioactive residue like uranium most likely, unless the reactants were heavier than uranium. Or at least that's my understanding.  Say if it were hydrogen and anti-hydrogen, you'd get only gama and beta radiation, which can penetrate things fairly easily. But if it were gold and anti-gold, then maybe there is some alpha radiation or free protons and neutrons. Alpha radiation and free protons might not penetrate much solid matter."
Physics,3dwedh,jstock23,2,Mon Jul 20 03:44:08 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you would get beta radiation. For every positron you would have an electron to match it up with and annihilate. I guess I'm guessing that the particles would all totally match up matter and antimatter and annihilate and there wouldn't be any pairs that failed to annihilate. In the same way with the gold and anti gold, why would you have free protons and neutrons ? For every proton there would be an anti proton to match up with an annihilate. Am I missing something ?  What about if particles are created from the energy ? (Like they are in particle accelerators). I'm a bit fuzzy on how this works. It seems I may have forgotten."
Physics,3dwedh,mathematicalcreature,2,Mon Jul 20 04:08:37 2015 UTC,"see this what also how i saw this happening, 100% efficient annihilation would leave no outgoing unannihilated particles of either mater ,antimatter, or parts thereof and anything coming out in that shell of radiation would have been made up on the spot by the crazy high energy levels.  and since no one can truly test this i cant be more specific. Heck maybe a 100% annihilation of matter and antimatter is impossible because the picosecond that the first atom of matter touches the first atom of antimatter the explosion would push both masses away from each other violently and prevent further reaction."

Nambu shared one half of the 2008 Nobel Prize for Physics, with the other half split between Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa.

Generally we don't actually want to quantize the Nambu-Goto action though. It has a square root in it that makes it hard to quantize.

The shit was predicted in a paper put on arxiv about a year ago and everyone jumped on board with measuring the monophosphides and monoarsenides almost immediately. There are multiple groups trying to measure these materials accurately in high fields across the US, but unfortunately these materials are really sensitive and often have antisymmetric  Hall signals and associated MR vs H, and give unreliable oscillations as such; making necessary high quality FIB'ing a barrier to most researchers.

Physics,3dofyy,antihero,0,Sat Jul 18 14:19:06 2015 UTC,The distinction isn't that big. You write the same effective theories for both.
Physics,3dofyy,yangyangR,3,Sat Jul 18 16:04:44 2015 UTC,"Mathematically, sure. Physically they are as different as proteins are to nuclei."
Physics,3dofyy,Fylwind,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:26:36 2015 UTC,"That's absurd. The standard model is also an effective field theory; it admits massless fermion excitations that look like solutions to Weyl's representation of the Dirac equation. That's what these quasiparticles are as well.  They aren't that different mathematically or physically, and that's a lovely thing. Chalk up another for universality. We'd do well to have more Nambus and less snobby fundamentalists in physics."
Physics,3dofyy,CondMatTheorist,3,Sat Jul 18 21:51:56 2015 UTC,"I make no claim that the particle physics is not an effective field theory, and given its incompleteness it's pretty clear that it is indeed.  I'm simply saying that the energy scale of particle physics (GeV to TeV+) is much much higher than the scale of condensed matter (meV to eV), so to claim they are the same is 'absurd', even if the mathematical structures are similar.  In the same way proteins can manifest as strings and sheets in cells, nuclei can also form pasta in neutron stars.  The properties they share are a consequence of their similarity in mathematics, not because there is any inherent link between them."
Physics,3dofyy,Fylwind,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:49:07 2015 UTC,"Energy scales are important only in relative terms. You don't need the LHC to see an electron. Does that mean an electron isn't a particle? Or is it just an electron in a metal that is no longer a particle? I just don't see why this distinction is so important to you.  The experiment this article is talking about has measured a particle that is a massless, helical fermion, exactly as Weyl imagined. The only way in which it's different from a high-energy Weyl fermion is that high-energy Weyl fermions might not actually exist. This is assuredly not the difference between proteins and nuclei."
Physics,3dofyy,CondMatTheorist,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:47:05 2015 UTC,"It's also different in the sense of being a quantum excitation of a many-particle system, not a particle unto itself.

Physics,3dofyy,weforgottenuno,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:22:21 2015 UTC,"Man, that's what we were already talking about...  It wouldn't be ""hypothetically a fundamental particle"" since (unless you have a theory of everything you'd like to share with the class) all of our high-energy theory is also made of effective field theories. Ken Wilson cleared this all up for us decades ago.  So now, what I'm still trying to get at, and am sad that no one seems willing to answer me, is why is this distinction so important to you?  It's obviously not so important to Zahid Hasan (who is already doing pretty well for himself and is on track for probably a lot more awards after this), to Princeton's communications office, or to the editors and referees at Science. If it's just a matter of using the word ""particle"" instead of ""quasiparticle,"" it just seems odd to me for you to accuse them downthread of having zero scientific integrity."
Physics,3dofyy,CondMatTheorist,3,Mon Jul 20 17:17:09 2015 UTC,"That would be very nice of someone.  Well looking around I found Spinor which may or may not make sense to you. It gets at some of the math behind what one of these massless particles is.   Massive particles, such as electrons, are described as Dirac spinors. The classical neutrino of the standard model of particle physics is an example of a Weyl spinor. However, because of observed neutrino oscillation, it is now believed that they are not Weyl spinors, but perhaps instead Majorana spinors. It is not known whether (spin-1/2) Weyl spinors exist in nature. In 2015, an international team led by Princeton University scientists announced that they had found a quasiparticle that behaves as a Weyl fermion.   Edit: not a particle physicist.

If we imagine a 2D drawing of a cube on paper, the space above/below the paper is a 4th dimension, and the flattened cube is a fully expanded 3D cube. This is how it would 'feel', in a true 4D perspective. A 4D object would then be seamless layers of these drawings, that stack up off the paper.   These layers are entire 3D objects, which are mere slices of the whole body. Seeing them in motion, by passing a 4D shape through 3D, is a good way to build up the full picture. It's also very useful to compare the 4D shape with a similar 3D version, if possible. Then, follow the patterns with what the slices of a shape look like in a lower dimension.

Physics,3dqrcq,asksnonsense,3,Sun Jul 19 10:01:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on your choice of interpretation of quantum mechanics. Superdeterminism is the thesis that the experimentalist has no real choice in selecting the type of measurement and that the system being measured ""knows"" (in some sense) what the experimentalist will measure beforehand (to see this, consider measuring linear vs. circular polarization for photons). People have trouble with superdeterminism though, as it seems to undermine the very idea that science is possible. Non-superdeterministic hidden variable theories are not forbidden, but they must be non-local (allow superluminal causes, see Bell's or the GHZ theorem) and contextual (if I measure multiple ""compatible""/ commuting things simultaneously, I get a different answer than if I did the measurements separately, see the Kochen-Specker theorem). These non-local hidden variable theories are somewhat unpalatable because they contradict special relativity prima facie.  In interpretations like many-worlds, Copenhagen, Qbism, there is no posited deterministic mechanism for the selection of measurement outcomes, so you could argue that these are indeterministic. GRW theory says that collapse is an objective process, but I do not know enough about it to say whether or not the collapse is stochastic/ random or not. Some hidden-variable theories, such as Bohmian mechanics, are completely deterministic. It should be clear that superdeterministic theories are very deterministic.  I hope that this is helpful. If you have any further questions, let me know."
Physics,3dqrcq,SofaKingWitty,5,Sat Jul 18 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"Many-worlds is definitely not indeterministic. Time evolution is fully determined by the Schrodinger equation. If you're trying to measure some observable with eigenstates State 1 and State 2 and you find your system in State 1, you might ask ""Hmm, why was it not in State 2?"" But MWI says that there's another, just-as-real you who is probably saying, ""Hmm, why is it not in State 1?"" The indeterministic collapse of Copenhagen is only apparent."
Physics,3dqrcq,johnnymo1,2,Sat Jul 18 16:29:49 2015 UTC,"I understand that the time evolution is deterministic. The time evolution generated by the Schrodinger equation is always completely deterministic, the reason discussion of indeterminism enters quantum mechanics at all is due to the selection of measurement outcomes. The reason that I said it could be argued that it is indeterministic with regard to the selection of measurement outcomes is that there is no way to predict with absolute certainty whether you will find yourself in the world with state 1 or state 2, as opposed to say Bohmian mechanics, where it would be possible if you knew the relevant hidden variables."
Physics,3dqrcq,SofaKingWitty,5,Sat Jul 18 16:37:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced that question has any meaning. Universe 1 me finds his system in state 1. Universe 2 me finds his system in state 2. There is no prediction to be made because both outcomes occur. Neither one is the ""real me."""

The question ""Will my particle have spin +z?"" is well-posed and experimentally accessible. If one adopts your mindset, why should probabilities arise at all in a deterministic theory?  Edit: You should read the top response to this question. This elaborates on the problem of probability in many worlds."
Physics,3dqrcq,SofaKingWitty,2,Sat Jul 18 16:47:53 2015 UTC,"If one adopts your mindset, why should probabilities arise at all in a deterministic theory?   That is actually a good question, and how MWI preserves the Born rule is not really clear at the moment (at least, I'm not convinced that it's clear yet).   As to the rest of it, if MWI is true, the question cannot be answered as posed. You measure both spins! The experimenters of universe 1 and universe 2 are the same experimenter until a measurement is made, and then both outcomes occur. ""Why did I measure state 1"" has no meaning because the other experimenter is asking himself ""why did I measure state 2?""   But the experimenters in both MWI universes are indistinguishable apart from the result of that measurement, so if we reran the experiment and ""swapped outcomes,"" there is no distinction. You can't swap outcomes because it doesn't change anything. One experimenter measures state 1 and the other measures state 2, exactly as before. The question ""why did I measure state 1 and not him"" is ill-posed because I and him are not physically distinguishable."
Physics,3dqrcq,johnnymo1,2,Sat Jul 18 16:57:36 2015 UTC,"At face value, the question appears well-posed, as we only experience one the measurement outcomes. We can alter the question slightly to fit this situation: ""Why did I find myself in the world where I measured state 1 instead of state 2?"". The popular methods of explaining probability in MWI involve applying decision theory to this very question, so I'm not entirely convinced that it is nonsensical. What would be the proper way to discuss experimental outcomes in the MWI framework if this is the incorrect way?"

But you didn't. You found yourself in both. As I said above, the question evidently cannot be answered as posed because if you swap out the experimenters, they ask the same questions and the physical situation has not changed. Neither of them has a claim to be the ""original"" experimenter and if we try to make it into a question about it, you're just getting into philosophy and asking questions about the self. ""Why did I find myself this way?"" Who is I?   What would be the proper way to discuss experimental outcomes in the MWI framework if this is the incorrect way?   I don't know and I'm not sure anyone knows yet, since if we can't get the Born rule out of MWI the point is moot. I'll have to leave it to the theorists actually doing work in the area to sort that out."

Physics,3dqrcq,rantonels,3,Sat Jul 18 23:27:03 2015 UTC,"The point is that a quantum mechanical world is nondeterministic in terms of observables. Interpretations only differ in nonobservable ontology.

The way you measure the distance from any point to the origin in 3-space is with the Pythagorean theorem: s2 = r2 = x2 + y2 + z2.  The way you measure the ""distance"" in (flat) spacetime between an event and the origin is with: s2 = xa x_a = -c2t2 + x2 + y2 + z2 = -c2t2 + r2.  So to go from 3-space to flat spacetime, you just add the notion of time to the notion you already have of space (with a factor of c for unit conversion and a minus sign because of the weirdness of relativity)."

For any observer who's moving at a constant speed, there are meaningful notions of space and time, which are just what you think they are intuitively, which I won't try to explain, so that's the sense in which they are different.   However, if I am moving at some speed relative to you, then I have my own notion of space and time, and they're different from yours. This was the big insight of Einstein in 1905. My notion of space and time is got from your notion by a kind of ""rotation"" which mixes the two together. It's almost as if you and I are choosing different x-y axes on a sheet of paper, my axes might differ from your axes by 10 degrees but they're equally valid. And this is why people say that space and time are two aspects of one unified thing: spacetime, because it wouldn't make sense to mix the two together unless they were fundamentally the same type of thing.  N.B. the transformation that mixes space and time together between different reference frames isn't exactly like a rotation, it's something called a hyperbolic rotation which is essentially the same concept but with sin's and cos's replaced by sinh's and cosh's."

Physics,3digez,Ichi-Guren,2,Fri Jul 17 10:19:29 2015 UTC,"Could you answer a few questions for me?  Why would an accretion disk form at all? Is there some finite amount that the black hole could take in before some arbitrary limit is reached? If not, does the process simply take longer as the black hole catches up?   Also, the video stated that you would not be able to register the event due to how fast it would occur. That makes sense to me due to the immediate influence of gravity, but I was wondering what magnitude of time is required for that hole to suck things in? Would a house, say 1000 meters away, be pulled in within a second?"
Physics,3digez,Stuffe,9,Thu Jul 16 22:15:10 2015 UTC,"I was wondering what magnitude of time is required for that hole to suck things in? Would a house, say 1000 meters away, be pulled in within a second?   In general gravitational attraction is determined by this formula: a = GM/r2  G is just a constant, M is the mass of the object and r is the distance between the object being attracted and the center of mass of the attracting object (here the black hole). Now if you really want to become good at physics I would take a look at this formula and see if I could try and answer some of those questions myself, the most important stuff is all contained in that formula, otherwise just read on for the answers :)  So you see here that both G and M are the same for both the black hole and the earth. That means that the difference is determined only by r. Or more correctly put 1/r2. Think about this for a second, a number squared ""blows up"" really quickly! And then we take the inverse of that, that means that as r grows, the effect of gravity wears off super fast.   Let's do a little math. I happen know that the radius of earth is roughly 6.000 km and now you ask me what the attraction would be to something as massive as the earth, if it was only 1 km away. Well, since all other variables are the same, lets just look at the difference in terms of the only variable that has really changed (1/r2, one over the distance squared, distance here given in km).  For earth:  1/r2 = 1/60002 = 1/36000000  For the black hole:  1/r2 = 1/12 = 1  In other words, since we are so much closer to the black hole the gravitational effect from it would be 36000000 times greater! That means that house 1 km away would be sucked into the black hole in a fraction of a second! But wait a second, the black hole would still fall towards the earths center. Probably a lot of the mass as far away as 1km could perhaps miss this black hole and be flung past it as the black hole falls downwards. The black hole is very small after all. Also the earth and the house on it is spinning, so the house and everything else would hit ""a bit to the side"".  You can imagine how violently this mass would collide with mass coming from the other directions and that some of it would be thrown to all sides. While the black hole is falling towards the center of the earth, the earth is also moving towards it. Since we just established how important the 1/r2 term is and that the gravitational effect of something as close as 1km away is 36000000 times greater, you can imagine how the earth would be pulled unequally and sort of stretch as the closest part move faster and the further away move slower. But there is a lot of things to think about as to how exactly the earth would be devoured by this black hole. For example, how the different layers will be effected at different times. The crust is very rigid where as the core is molten and under very high pressure. Also the black hole will have so much momentum that it just continues through the earths center off mass and is now pulled backwards instead. And all through this there is an extremely violent high pressure environment around the black hole where all the stuff that ""misses it"" collides. Only after the black hole has devoured most of the earth does this violent mass around it calm down somewhat. Much of it will be consumed, but some of it will have found an orbit around the black hole. Of course it will all be orbiting in the same direction, otherwise it would continue to collide. And actually the final spin of this collapsed mass of the earth will be related to the original spin of the earth. Think about how the matter being sucked in hit the black hole to the side. Only, now the disc will be rotating much faster, since it is much closer to the center of mass (just like an ice skater can speed up her spin by pulling in her arms/mass, the same is true here, this is called conservation of angular momentum).  Anyway, this became way too long, but hopefully you understand the concept a bit better now :)"

Physics,3dlz3o,HyperfinePunchline,3,Fri Jul 17 10:12:22 2015 UTC,"For problem two from yesterday, here is what I have been thinking.  The pressure of the system does not change (ie the transformation is isobaric), and there is no external work done, so, by the first law of thermodynamics and the definition of the differential entropy: [;dU = C_pdT = \delta Q=TdS ;].  Thus, [;C_p\frac{dT}{T}=dS;] and integrating we have [;\Delta S = C_pln(\frac{T_f}{T_i});] for an isobaric transformation.  This final temp can be found from the ideal gas law, the result being: [;T_f=\frac{T_1+T_2}{2} ;]  Now here is where my thought process gets a bit murky. Can we just calculate the change in entropy of each body from the above formula and add them together? If that is the case, then we have: [;\Delta S = C_p(ln(\frac{T_1+T_2}{2T_1})+ln(\frac{T_1+T_2}{2T_2}))=C_pln(\frac{T_1^2+2T_1T_2+T_2^2}{4T_1T_2});].  The argument of the natural log is not obviously greater than/ equal to 1 (to me at least), which it must be for entropy to not decrease. To show that it is in fact greater than or equal to one, consider the following:  [;(T_1-T_2)^2 = T_1^2-2T_1T_2+T_2^2\geq 0 \newline T_1^2+T_2^2 \geq 2T_1T_2 \newline T_1^2+2T_1T_2+T_2^2 \geq 4T_1T_2;].  Let me know if this makes sense, I'm not 100% sure about the step where I assume that I can find the changes in entropy separately."
Physics,3dlz3o,hes_a_dick,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:50:20 2015 UTC,This was my solution as well. I agree that the total change in the entropy of the system is the sum of the entropy changes for the individual parts.

For an elliptical orbit, the planet sits at the focus of the ellipse. The focal length is [;c=\frac{L^2}{m k} \frac{\epsilon}{1-\epsilon^2};] and the length of the semi-major axis is [; a=\frac{L^2}{m k} \frac{1}{1-\epsilon^2} ;]  The beginning of the Hohmann orbit is at a distance  (1) [;2R=a-c=\frac{L^2}{m k} \frac{1-\epsilon}{(1-\epsilon) (1+\epsilon)}=\frac{L^2}{m k} \frac{1}{1+\epsilon};]  from the planet, and the end of the Hohmann orbit is at a distance  (2) [;4R=a+c=\frac{L^2}{m k} \frac{1+\epsilon}{(1-\epsilon) (1+\epsilon)}=\frac{L^2}{m k} \frac{1}{1-\epsilon};]  from the planet.

Physics,3dk1qs,hes_a_dick,0,Sat Jul 18 01:57:38 2015 UTC,"That is not correct for part b. You have found the velocities of the circular orbits simply by using the centripetal acceleration of each orbit.  However, this does not give the delta_v that takes you to a elliptical orbit and back again to a circular one. I forget the equations exactly myself, but I remember that Taylor and Goldstein had the equations for the energy of a general inverse square law orbit, in terms of the eccentricity or semi-major axis. I forget what other parameters they could use.  Using that, once can find the kinetic energy of the elliptical orbit at each point, and comparing with the kinetic energies of the two circular orbits (which you can find from what you have already done), you can find the delta_v at the two points."

Physics,3di0zu,ElGatoPorfavor,2,Thu Jul 16 15:24:45 2015 UTC,My background is low energy nuclear astrophysics so my experience isn't really HEP or astronomy so you can take my advice for what it is worth. But I'd choose astronomy over HEP if I was in your shoes.   To me the big data aspect of modern astronomy is really interesting and there seems to be a lot of good work in the intersection of machine learning and observational astronomy. There's some of this in HEP too but I think the astronomical problems are more varied and interesting. Cruise over to David Hogg's blog to see some of this work.

I'm currently an undergraduate (starting my 5. semester) with I think above average but not best grades (average of 1.9 with 1 best, 5 worst grade - don't know what gpa that really is but I think around 3.3-3.5?) and nearly in time so far. I definitely want to start a master and then a phd after my bachelor but don't know if grades and time of graduation really are important, because I think to have a good relationship with a professor and how you really act and work while doing your bachelor/master thesis or projects will be defining if you get possibilities or not, but again I don't really know, or is every scientist who achieves a serious career in science a 4.0 gpa student? Also I considered tutoring next semester but didn't get the job, hopefully I will get one next semester.  btw. I am interessted in quantum information, quantum optics, quantum technologies and particle physics as well as computational physics but hopefully I can narrow it down once I can actually take classes, experience and/or work in one of those fields.  EDIT: Why am I asking? I always hear how hard and competitive it is to work in science and how little money and jobs there are, so I'm a little worried if ""normal"" students even have a realistic chance to get into research."
Physics,3di0zu,CodyBStrange,2,Thu Jul 16 15:34:31 2015 UTC,"For the more experimentally inclined, research CAN be easier to get into (not saying that it is), because you can't really measure experimental prowess. Please note that this isn't me shitting on experimentalists, I have mad respect for you lads and lasses.  For the theoretically inclined, grades make up 99.9999% of your ability to find a PhD place (especially in Europe). Time of graduation isn't important at all really (unless you are like 35 yrs old). To help narrow down what you'd enjoy researching, you should try to read around the subject. This gives a better global view of the subject, rather than the typically narrow view that lectures tend to give you at the beginning of that course.  In Europe, if you want to do a PhD, you will almost certainly need a Master's degree (either integrated like a large part of the UK), or standalone (like large parts of EU minus UK).  Talking to professors in your department can help as well. Ask them what you should read if you are interested in a particular area, or ask them if you could have a quick talk about your possible academic future."
Physics,3di0zu,CodyBStrange,2,Thu Jul 16 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"Reply to the edit: It is difficult to work in physics, especially stuff that is more inclined towards pure maths. Technological advancing PhDs are usually plentiful, but the stuff that doesn't have immediate real-world applications tends to be underfunded.  Work hard as an undergrad, keep your nose pressed to the grindstone, and just try your best. If you succeed, you succeed. If not, ah well. At least you'll have a degree, which is more than a lot of people."
Physics,3di0zu,DerJoint,2,Thu Jul 16 15:47:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your replies! I try my best at grades but know I have to study fast because my parents are short on money and you only get some money from the government if you are fast :/...  What would you consider minimum grades for possibilities in theoretical physics? Are bachelor grades already important or only the grades in your master?  I too know that we have strong quantum information and technology groups at our university but what I experienced from the laboratory lessons is that only experimental things may not be very fitting for me (but maybe I can only judge if I have experienced experimental science outside of lessons?), but I know these groupes often work at theoretical and experimental problems with some overlapping. I too don't really know how I can classify computational physics because it looks like something of a third pillar of physics."
Physics,3di0zu,CodyBStrange,2,Thu Jul 16 16:01:04 2015 UTC,"Bachelor grades matter when you apply, because you are unlikely to have obtained all the grades for your Master's course. Quantum Info theory departments can actually sometimes be found in maths departments (see Oxford University)."

Honestly, you should be fine--just study hard, work hard, don't get discouraged.  Core math classes that you should take: pre-calculus and calculus (up through multivariable), differential equations, linear algebra. You should also take a statistics class, especially if you want to work at CERN (source: I currently work at CERN as an undergrad).  Consider joining your university's Society of Physics Students (SPS)--I'm pretty sure Rutgers has one. Try asking upperclassmen about other clubs (I know someone in ARESTY who's also here at CERN and would probably be happy to answer your questions).  I can't really answer your last question for you. Try going to a bunch of professors' websites and see what looks interesting to you, then go ask them about it (profs loooove talking about their research). Try reading their papers, or others you find (arXiv is a good place to look). You won't understand most of them, maybe even any of them, at first. That's okay. Use Google, try to figure things out on your own, and ask profs questions if you get stuck. It gets easier, and you'll start figuring out what kinds of things are really interesting to you."

I mean it's simple in hindsight, and our universe is only apart of some initial conditions we're unaware of. I could even continue the nonsensical word slew with the term fractal evolution, if we could find the initial conditions of the big bang then maybe we could figure out how whatever came before could predict the evolution of our universe. And when it comes to fractals I'm talking more about how they'er the most efficient way to store something, from a lightning bolt to the evolution of life they appear everywhere not because of divine patterns, but because of the evolution of space efficiency increasing survivability. If you still think I don't know what I'm talking about I understand, because to a large extent how could I without more education.. But I have the interest.  EDIT: I see why we're confused here, GUT seems to be solely about uniting relativity and quantum mechanics, but I still think understanding the fractal nature of even just gravity could fill the gap. What better thing to predict gaps of knowledge then with a self similar pattern occurring everywhere in the universe? We don't even know why gluons carry gravity that has the opposite effect in a sense. Not to mention the electron or dark matter/energy. These are the reasons I want to research the GUT."

You probably need more accurate measurements for a meaningful calculation.

Physics,3degcs,Bromskloss,16,Wed Jul 15 18:58:24 2015 UTC,"I've been going over the mechanics in my head repeatedly. I could have my hands completely off the handlebars, and still make a turn. I'm not counter-steering at all."
Physics,3degcs,katatonos,14,Wed Jul 15 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"I could have my hands completely off the handlebars, and still make a turn.   Right, that's true. What happens then, I would say, still assuming we want to go right, is that you shift your hips left, so that the bike leans left and you yourself lean right. Now, the bike starts turning left, i.e. the wheels (in particular their points of contact with the ground) travel a bit to the left. Once the equipage in its entirety (rider and bike) is leaning right in the sense that the centre of mass is to the right of the contact points between wheels and ground, the turn proper can begin.  The point is that your wheels still need to briefly turn left before everything can start turning right, because you can't easily just start leaning without doing so.  Edit: The difficulty of controlling your lean without resorting to moving your wheels left or right is the same as the difficulty of not falling without moving your wheels left or right, i.e. the difficulty of riding a bike with no steering movement."
Physics,3degcs,Bromskloss,3,Wed Jul 15 19:32:03 2015 UTC,"Correct.  The rider's upper body may lean right, but to maintain balance, the gyroscopic stabilizing effect of the bike causes the lower body (hips & bike) to lean left.  The rider is aware of the upper body lean (I choose to lean right), but may be unaware of the lower body/bike lean.  As physics shows (/u/Bromskloss', /u/wenzela's explanations & the video) it's this unconscious left lean of the bike that starts the turn to the right."

If you can accomplish the lean without using the handle bards, then the bike will turn in the direction of your lean.  With sufficient lean, friction between the tires and the ground combines with the torque from gravity and you don't have to worry about flying off of your bike because of your forward momentum.  So this counter-steering technique is only important if you want to initiate all turns with the handle bars.  You can, of course, not use them at all and still turn your bike in the proper direction."

I mean, technically they would stop the same way normal skateboards do, by dragging the back end on the ground.  Another solution is to step off of the board. It should fly up with a force equal to your weight; you just need to reach forward and catch it before it launches into someone's head. (This is assuming a light board, obviously) It's like stopping and kicking your board up, without actually having to kick it up.  Turning should actually just be fine. If you tip one direction, the ""down"" side will experience more force from the magnetic repulsion than the ""up"" side, which should push it away. If the repulsion doesn't supply enough lateral force to turn, forcing an edge onto the ground could ""drag"" you into a turn, much like a snowboard. I suppose it's an exercise in engineering to make sure that force is intuitive."

Physics,3dcuzx,eewallace,2,Wed Jul 15 22:47:21 2015 UTC,"It's the same exact thing. The E-L equations make the action stationary. In mechanics, the action is the integral of the Lagrangian over time.  In general in the calculus of variations, you start with some infinitesimal variation ds, and make a tiny right triangle with infinitesimal sides. By the Pythagorean theorem, ds2 = dx2 + dy2, so ds = sqrt(dx2 + dy2). Now ds is your ""action"" that you want to make stationary. Let's say you want to find the curve y(x) that makes ds stationary (you want to find the shortest distance between two points). You can factor out a dx, and your action becomes ds = sqrt(1 + y'(x)2) dx = f(x,y,y') dx.  Now all you have to do is plug in your f(x,y,y') (your ""Lagrangian"") into the E-L equations, and you'll find the y(x) that minimized the distance between two points. For this particular one, you'll get a straight line. This is the proof that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points in flat spacetime (assuming it has already been proven that the E-L equation minimizes the action, which is covered in most mechanics books).  The physics case, where your Lagrangian is T-V is a special case of a more general idea. In the physics case, your f(x,y,y') just becomes L(t,q,q'), and the E-L equation is written in terms of t, q, and q' instead of x, y, and y'. Check out Chapter 6 of Taylor if you can."

If it's the angle that a particular radius of the disk makes with the vertical, I guess you could say that it's not one-to-one if the disk is slipping, since a given point on the perimeter of the disk will contact a different set of points on the parabola on each pass.

By Pythagoras we have the following:  (R+h)2 = b2 + R2,  we rearrenge for b:  b = sqrt(h2 + 2Rh)  The angle will be given by:  v=arcsin(b/(R+h))  v=arcsin((sqrt(h2 +2Rh)/(R+h))  The distance we can see in the horizon is then the length of the piece of the circle between this angle. This will be given by:  L=2 Pi v/360     Using this method, we arrive at the same answer for question (a), but have a disagreement with question (b) compared to the provided solution."
Physics,3dcuzx,5secondstozerotime,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:59:39 2015 UTC,"Nice on part (a)!  The reason this probably didn't work with part (b) is that when we know the object is an arclength of 12 miles away, it's out of his field of view. We know this because we can calculate his maximum view on the horizon to be ~3 miles. So we need to define a height of the object, h2, that intersects with the tangent line (you can see my drawing above in the solution)."

Here A is a matrix that represents your Laplacian operator, x is a vector that represents the the electric potential and b is also a vector that represents the right side of the equation (its basically the charge density times a factor).

To be fully candid, I am extremely dubious that your ideas are correct.  To explain where I think your understanding of QM may have gone askew: in Newtonian mechanics, time is a parameter that simply allows one to evolve the system. QM is exactly the same when it comes to how it treats time. Time is not something intrinsic to QM (i.e. it isn't considered a dimension in space-time), instead it is just a parameter in our theory.  EDIT: That being said, I am very open to reading your arguments."

Physics,3df6dv,attofreak,3,Wed Jul 15 21:55:41 2015 UTC,"There's a recent review on issue of time in quantum mechanics. There have been many, but this one might have something you may find interesting, or provide you with some material to test your new approach:  http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-4075/47/20/204004  Free review paper, from one of the leading experts in the field of attosecond physics. Although the motivation for the topic is application to attoscience, they still cover some issues with defining time in QM.  There was a formulation of time operator, that didn't have the commutation relation with the Hermitian as position and momentum have with each other, like you mention for your case. It will very likely be a different approach, but just wanted to mention that there were such attempts, and they might help to know where and how your approach is different. I will have to find in which paper it was mentioned, it has been some time (heh). Here's that paper: http://dinamico2.unibg.it/recami/erasmo%20docs/SomeOld/TimeOpInQuantMechNCA1974.pdf  Check Eq. (3), definition of operator t_{2}, and then, from a relativistic point of view, Eq. (13).  There is also Sokolovski's clocked Schrodinger equation, which takes the approach of Feynman Path Integrals to come up with a definition of time in going from one point to another within the domains of QM (I hope you know a colleague with access to APS journals through their institute/university):  First proposal:  http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R5  Another derivation of the ""clocked Schrodinger equation"": http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.73.012108  Discussions on the measurement of traversal time by Sokolovski: http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.79.4946  And if you like, you can publish your results on http://arxiv.org.

Physics,3df6dv,CodyBStrange,-2,Wed Jul 15 21:32:38 2015 UTC,"Very interesting papers.  Thank you.  Unfortunately, I don't have an APS subscription, so I cannot read 3 of the papers, but the 2 that I can read seem quite interesting.  (Though I've found some info elsewhere on Sokolovski's clocked Schroedinger Equation, which seems very cool, though it seems to involve weak measurements, which I've read are very non-physical)  If I understand correctly, they manage to define a time operator that acts over regions where the energy spectrum is continuous (and the operator is undefined elsewhere).  Unfortunately, I don't understand this generalization they make to define the new type of operators, but the 2nd paper you linked talks about thinking about them as being similar to operators on a potential with a wall (and I suspect they are similar to the 1/x operator, which is undefined on |x=0> and <x=0|)  However, these papers make clear an important distinction between what I'm doing and the usual approach to creating a time operator:  I haven't created a time operator:  Instead I've created a family of @time=t operators.  Unlike the time operators that papers I've seen discuss, the @time=t operators are hermitian, non-measurable (they have no spectrum or average values at all), they square to +1, they don't have [H,@t]=ihbar, and they can act on any other elements in the algebra.  I can use these operators to create some time measurements, but calling them time-operators, I think would be a misnomer.  Either way, I suspect they might be a useful addition to the theory, if just for the fact that they allow me to convert between the Schroedinger and Heisenberg pictures as well as create a 3rd picture where neither the states nor operators depend on time (except for explicit time-dependence of the operators)."

In other cases, computational physics is used to determine what the background mathematics are.  For example, consider a device such as a plastic solar cell.  Well know a lot about the physics behind semiconductors and solar cells, but what about the nature of the disorder present in specific samples?  It cannot always be exactly determined experimentally so the challenge becomes modeling it correctly in a way that is predictive.  Real life tends to be a lot more messy than Feynman diagrams."

The types of problems you'd care about are ones that require massive numbers of iterations for relatively simple dynamics. For example, plasma physics is a crapton of charged particles, but the interactions aren't really that complicated. It's just Maxwell equations at heart. But you have so many particles interacting with so many other particles that you're better served by a computer calculating that for you.  The way I think of computational physics is that it is a middle ground between theory and experiments. You can use computational codes to get you more information to build intuition on nonlinear dynamics which you can use to develop nonlinear theoretical frameworks for understanding whatever phenomena you are interested in. You can use computational codes to understand what the shit you are seeing in an experiment because you can more easily isolate things by ""turning on"" or ""turning off"" effects."

You generally need to be fairly expert at things like parallel programming, algorithm design, you probably know how to program a GPU.  Half of my undergraduate degree was Computer Science courses.  You will often work in either C, C++ or Fortran (rather than something easier like Python or MATLAB) and will actually have to think about, say, how one language allocates an array versus the other and will generally work on problems where getting a little more juice out of the numerics can provide real insights."

Edit2: Anyway , how I interpreted the question was ''find the angle for which the velocity becomes 0'' under the assumption that static friction works like dynamic friction here - that is µF_n is still the friction force. s is the arclength on the circle. This is however under the assumption that it just kind of slides up below 45° on the arc and then goes back down with the friction.  :   http://imgur.com/1wZUXQ6  (this was the solution I was sceptical of, spoilers)"
Physics,3d887j,eewallace,2,Tue Jul 14 14:45:26 2015 UTC,I think the condition should be that -gcos(\theta)=v*v/R which is when circular motion can just be maintained i.e. if the velocity is any smaller it will fall. I got a differential equation for theta with respect to time that can be used to find v.
Physics,3d887j,eewallace,0,Tue Jul 14 19:04:27 2015 UTC,"That's the condition for making it all the way around the loop, so if you solve for v from that condition, your answer will be what the problem is calling v0. See my other answer ITT for my interpretation of what the question is asking for."
Physics,3d887j,Josef--K,0,Tue Jul 14 21:21:24 2015 UTC,"No, making it all the way around the loop is for the special case theta=pi. You have a separate differential equation for theta that you can use to solve for v. Plugging the v (which is theta dependent) into -gcos(\theta)=v*v/R gives an equation for solving theta."
Physics,3d887j,eewallace,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:02:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have said that v2/R+gcos(θ)>=0 is the condition for the car to remain in uniform circular motion. The minimum of v2/R+gcos(θ) is v2/R-g at θ=π, and setting that equal to 0 gives the minimum speed to make it all the way around. If v2/R+gcos(θ)<0 for some θ<π, that indicates that the car will either fall off the track or turn around at some point before the top. But it's still a condition for making it around the loop, not for rolling without slipping."

Physics,3d887j,KKRJ,0,Wed Jul 15 01:06:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I may have a sign error. By my reading, though, where slipping refers to insufficient friction for rolling without slipping, you don't need N=0. N just has to be too small to provide the required friction to maintain constant speed."

Physics,3d887j,Bromskloss,2,Wed Jul 15 17:49:37 2015 UTC,"The problem states that the car is moving at constant speed, so I don't think you want to look for an angle where the velocity is 0. My interpretation of the ""starts to slip"" question is that you're looking for the angle past which the coefficient of friction is insufficient to maintain the condition for rolling without slipping.   under the assumption that static friction works like dynamic friction here - that is µF_n is still the friction force.   For static friction, µF_n is an upper limit on the friction force; the actual magnitude of the force is just whatever it needs to be to cancel any other tangential forces. But setting F_f=μF_n does give you the threshold for starting to slip.  Regarding your spoilered solution, I don't think your expression for the change in total energy (in particular, your integral of the net tangential force) works. In (idealized) rolling without slipping, the frictional force does no work, because the instantaneous point of application of the force is not moving. Or put another way, the two surfaces (of the tire and the track) are not moving relative to one another.  If your y direction is vertical, rather than perpendicular to the track, there's also a problem with your expression of the gravitational force in terms of components."

So what it takes off in rotational energy is added in CM kinetic energy? So neglecting the rotational energy of the weels initially, all we have to consider is the potential gravitational energy?   By the way I do agree that my reasoning is not really correct, I just decided to post it to give raise to some discussion since I wasn't sure how I should proceed.    The problem states that the car is moving at constant speed    All the time? Wow I surely have missed that. The car is forced to somehow move at constant speed by some internal motor?    there's also a problem with your expression of the gravitational force in terms of components.

While fictional, I found it intriguing that Ant-Man appeared to have no affect to the area around him when he shrunk/grew.  Black holes, if I'm not mistaken, operate on the theory that if you pack a bunch of mass into an extremely dense point you will increase the gravitational effect it has on other objects.  In ""real life,"" would Ant-Man's suit cause a gravitational effect to the area around it if a 170lbs (77kg) man were shrunk down to the size of an electron?  Or would the mass have to be substantially greater for the effects to be noticeable because of gravitational influences of other objects like the Earth and Sun?"

You will notice that density is not included in this equation at all. For this reason, he wouldn't have any noticeable effect on his surroundings if he became electron sized. That being said, I did the math for electrons and found that if he stood 7x10-11 meters away from an electron (about the radius of a carbon atom, which is huge compared to the size of an electron) he would exert a force of about 10-19 Newtons. That is really small, but when you take into account Newton's second law, F=ma, and the fact that electrons are about 10-32 kg, he would be bombarded with electrons his size flying at him at 1013 m/s (faster than the speed of light). They wouldn't do anything to him except be annoying because he is so massive compared to them, but I think it would deter him from becoming electron sized ever again."

Just write M=dV, where V is the volume and d is the density. If you approximate the ant man as spherical then V = (4/3)pir3. Plugging that in, you get something like F=(Gmd)r, modulo some prefactors. This is the force in terms of density if you are right next to the ant-man. Thus, if the density is super high, the force would be super high as well. As sluuuurp noted, the body would collapse into a black hole."

I also just don't see any way to write the gravitational field equation using density without using it with volume to find the mass of one or both of the objects. On the topic of it becoming a black hole, I don't think that the force would be strong enough to overcome Coulomb's force, so it wouldn't collapse in on itself. Ant man is just not massive enough to warp space-time in that way at any more than the subatomic level."

The second is ignorance based, i.e. when you lack accessible information. Classical statistical mechanics deals with the second kind of probability. However, to work with the second kind of probability in quantum mechanics and superpositions, you need to use density matrices. The treatment is feasible but more complicated mathematically."

In the derivation we used the energy levels of ''particle in a box'' given by c(n1²+n2²+n3²) to get the state density function. So we used a QM reasoning to find all the allowed energy states. By now doing the canonical ensemble we are assuming that each particle can only have on of those energies meaning we assume it can be in one of the eigenstates of ''particle in a box''.

Physics,3d8zhu,conquerer7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:32:13 2015 UTC,"I believe so. In the semi-classical case, quantum state density becomes the same as classical phase space volume, so you could have gotten that state density function just from doing a phase space integral. Look: the total amount of states is from integrating d3 p d3 x, and integrating d3 x doesn't change; since p2 is proportional to E the momentum integral gives E3/2. Differentiating to get g(e) gives E1/2 as you already know.  (see http://puccini.che.pitt.edu/~karlj/Classes/CHE2101/Shell/Ch18_Statistical_mechanics_of_classical_systems.pdf for more detail)"

Physics,3d8zhu,conquerer7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:54:20 2015 UTC,"In physics, there are two places where one hears things like ""X transforms one way, while Y transforms the opposite way"". Those two places are in the active vs. passive pictures of transformations, and covariant and contravariant tensor components.  Every explanation of tensors I've ever seen has lumped these two phenomena into one, which has really confused me. After thinking about it for a while, I believe they actually have nothing to do with each other. Dropping indices since they're hard to write and generally being sloppy:  Active vs. passive: in an active transformation, we focus on how a matrix A takes the old basis to the new basis. In a passive transformation, we focus on how the matrix A-1 takes the components of a vector in the old basis to the components of that same vector in the new basis. Thus we say the transformations are ""opposite"".  Covariant vs. contravariant: under a basis change, the components of covariant objects change by factors of A, and the components of contravariant objects change by factors of AT^(-1). Thus we say the transformations are ""opposite"".  These are very different, because inverse and inverse-transpose are very different operations. For example, in an orthogonal basis change, the covariant/contravariant distinction is trivial but the active/passive distinction isn't. Vector and covector components will transform the same way, but (passive) vector components and (active) vectors won't.  This really confused me, because one of the simplest examples you can do is to take a 2D vector space, and try a basis change that actively rotates the axes clockwise, which is orthogonal. In this case, the dual vectors will also be actively rotated clockwise (because covariant = contravariant here) but (co)vector components will be passively rotated counterclockwise!  Is this right? Again, I feel like I must be going crazy, because every single resource I can find treats active/passive and co/contra as exactly the same thing, when there seems to be a huge difference and no real logical connection."
Physics,3d8zhu,shaun252,2,Tue Jul 14 18:29:31 2015 UTC,"Firstly things don't transform passively or actively, you don't have 'active' vectors or 'passive vectors. It is just two different ways of considering the same change of the coordinates of the vector.   Either you have changed the frame and left the vector invariant so you have a new set of coordinates relative to the new basis 'passive'  or changed the vector and left the frame invariant so you also have a new set of coordinates but these are relative to the original basis 'active'.  Covariant and Contravariant comes about when considering frame changes or passive transformations. The whole point of co/contravariance is that the basis of these vectors transform one way so the coordinates need to transform the other way to leave the vector as a geometrical object invariant which corresponds to passive transformations."

Physics,3d8zhu,eewallace,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:02:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""tensile force"". There are two forces  acting between the tire and the ground: a normal force perpendicular to the road surface, and a frictional force parallel to it. Here, you're just concerned with the horizontal forces, i.e., friction. The rotation of the tire tends to move the bottom surface of the tire backward across the ground, and the direction of the frictional force is such as to oppose that motion. So the frictional force on the tire by the ground points forward, and the frictional force on the ground by the tire points backward. The frictional force on the tire by the ground is the only horizontal force acting on the car (neglecting air resistance), and it is what drives the car forward.  So you're correct that the force driving the car forward is the frictional force on the wheels by the ground. The only error I see is  the inclusion of an extra force (what you've called a tensile force).  Of course, this is an idealization, assuming no slipping, no deformation of the tires, and so on. But the basic conclusion that the net forward force is a frictional force on the tires by the road is correct. Thinking about it in terms of work and energy also gets complicated."

Physics,3d8zhu,BlazeOrangeDeer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:54:19 2015 UTC,"The order matters because in addition to raising or lowering the number of the state, they also multiply it by sqrt(n) or sqrt(n+1) (for  annihilation and creation respectively). This is why (a_dagger a) is the number operator that takes |n> to n|n>. It's also why the lowering operator doesn't produce a state when it acts on |0>, it returns the zero vector which is not a state. The equation you're looking for is the commutation relation   a a_dagger - a_dagger a = 1  which tells you how to swap them"
Physics,3d8zhu,SireBelch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:29:25 2015 UTC,"An Average Joe here with a physics question about light...  Light is made of photons, and I've seen some conversations that theorized that photons may have mass, but we just don't have a way to detect it because light is never at rest. (I got this from a forum discussion here: https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/do-photons-have-mass.138395/ )  I've seen recent research that mentions that in a lab setting, researchers have found ways to bend light without the use of lenses or physical objects. This might be compared to a flashlight that emits a curved or swirly beam of light instead of one that is exactly straight.  I've also seen some research that has been able to modify light in a way that it lands at its detector before it is emitted from its source... Gosh, I wish I knew where I read this stuff, but they were legitimate news articles when I came across them.  So...  If light can be slowed down, in theory to a resting state, is it possible - in theory of course - that light could have mass? And if that mass were concentrated enough, it could form a solid object?  I know this is all sci-fi thinking at this point, but that's exactly what it is at the moment. I'm doing some research for a sci-fi novel that I'd want to at least in theory be plausible.  Any comments are welcome!"
Physics,3d8zhu,BlazeOrangeDeer,2,Sat Jul 18 21:32:23 2015 UTC,"While light as a single particle does not have mass, a system of multiple particles of light can have mass. In relativity, the mass of an object is simply its rest energy, the energy of the object when it has zero momentum. So two beams of light in opposite directions have a  mass equal to their energy because their momenta cancel each other. However there's not really any way to keep the light bound into an object, the individual particles will just zoom on past each other. The exception to this is if you pack enough light into a small region you can make a black hole."

When Astrophysicists are reviewing data on planets that are millions of light years away; they see the image as it was millions of years ago as the image/light takes so long to get to the telescope due to the distance and the speed of light; whether they've taken this on board as to why they 'can't discover life forms yet' I don't know, but maybe that's another thing we should consider..As we see the planet as it was millions of years ago maybe life forms weren't formed at that time - but they are in this day and age?  Anyway moving on to the time travel, Scientists discovered how to slow down the speed of light from 186,282 miles a second to just 38mph by basically slowing atoms down and making their direction more consistent using photons and kept in a cigar shaped container away from the walls using electromagnetic fields and creating a quantum interference with more laser beams slowing light by a factor of 20 million or so - as they used Sodium Atoms it was specific to that, if they could slow light down at an even quicker rate and hold it for longer, maybe switching from Sodium Atoms to Oxygen, Carbon and Hydrogen they could slow down light so much it could appear paused - maybe for a few minutes/hours and then carried on thus creating a live image of the past?"

I'm not sure what experiment you're referring to, but it's not going to get you time travel. Experiments with ""slow light"" and such involve manipulations of the speed of light in matter, which is generically less than the speed of light in vacuum (this is the origin of refraction and related optical effects). They don't affect the speed of light in vacuum, or provide any way to circumvent causality."

The spherical harmonics might take a bit of trial and error to get the recurrence relation right, but most of us probably remember the bulk of the proof. Indeed, Legendre died in 1833, so good stuff would exist to cite, and also jog the time traveler's memory.  Special relativity would be straight forward enough to start from the light clock for a simple derivation of gamma. The Lorentz transformations and Minkowski metric should be straight forward.

Statistical mechanics could be easy to put on paper, as long as you can remember the basics and work at it. Convincing people atom's exist is another story, and getting quantum mechanics into people's  heads would be extremely difficult. Nonetheless, if you could kick start E&M, bust out the idea of capacitors, inductors, transistors, etc. early, then push the basics of quantum and statistical physics, you could kickstart a revolution.   Another key, I think would be that you'd get assistance from the other great physicists of the era.

The conflation of the two instrument types arises in part because Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault had originally been friends and collaborators, working together on such projects as using the Daguerreotype process to take images of the Sun between 1843–1845. At the instigation of François Arago, they began a new project to measure the speed of light. Sometime in 1849, however, it appears that the two had a falling out, and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this measurement.

Physics,3d4isb,GhostRider22,5,Mon Jul 13 22:23:40 2015 UTC,"For a less snarky answer, yes, you can make a flashlight.   Invent the incandescent bulb. This involves getting a glassblower to make a tiny jar, sealing it with rubber, pumping as much of the air out as possible, and finding some way to oxidize the remaining air. You also need to invent the filament. All of this is fairly difficult, except for the glassblowing part, because you're inventing all the techniques. Invent the electrical stuff. Insulated wires and switches. Pretty easy. Could get someone to make the switch pretty easily; a gunsmith will also mount it in a body. Invent the disposable battery. In other words, make the volta pile small, durable, and cheap. Fairly difficult, especially the cheap part. Also, if you want to sell these you probably want to invent interchangeable parts, so you can mass produce them.   You then end up with a flashlight that probably weighs several pounds and isn't terribly bright or long-lasting, but which works reliably and turns on quickly.  This crude prototype is about as useful as a hurricane lamp. It's not terribly bright, and it's fairly large and fairly fragile.  To make your electric lamp, you invented electric lighting, electrical distribution infrastructure, portable batteries, and mass production. In other words, to make a flashlight you, more or less, kickstarted the industrial revolution.

Theory is built up by many people over years and is designed to explain experimental evidence that is also developing over time.   To just imagine you could put modern theories into a the scientific community in 1800 and see any kind of support is probably optimistic.

First you would develop statistical mechanics so you could show that these electrically charged corpuscles travel further through air than atoms would. Then you can show that hydrogen only has a single electron. Next do the Rutherford experiment to show the existence of the nucleus.

In ""energetic escapes"", you get to think about potential energy and kinetic energy, and how they inter-convert. That leads you onto thinking about actions and their integrals.  In ""block forces"", you're invited to view an object as a whole and also as being made up of two parts, and make clear how those two views are related to each other.

It's fairly intuitive: If you watch someone run up an escalator while you're stationary, the person (seemingly) moves at the combined speed of their running speed and the escalator speed. Strictly speaking it's only true at the nonrelativistic limit, but I suppose your system is presumably nonrelativistic. If you don't want to rely on intuition, it's simple to derive from the Galilean transformations.

Physics,3d23xr,pqnelson,8,Mon Jul 13 00:11:44 2015 UTC,"These are all very good questions.  1) I think it's clearer to think of the ""fields"" as operators which act on the Hilbert space. The fields are not the same thing as the wavefunction. They may be combined into certain observables, which are expectation values of field operators in some state. Does that answer this question at all?  3) The particle interpretation is not necessary, and in fact it is sometimes not useful or meaningful. A strongly-coupled system might not admit a Fock space description. It's only weakled coupled systems where you can build from the bottom up with 0-particle states, 1-particle states, ... n-particle states as n creation operator acting on the vacuum. In a strongly coupled system, this may be impossible.  Furthermore, when you look at QFT in curved spacetime, you find that the particle states depend on the observer and/or the slicing of the spacetime. One observer's vacuum state is another observer's thermal state! That's the Unruh effect. So, the particle description may not be particularly (haha) enlightening. However, the field operators are just the field operators, and mean the same thing to everyone.  4) The way you stated this question may have several possible interpretations. Which do you mean? One possible interpretation is: consider a QFT, then take its continuum limit to arrive at a classical theory. If you apply canonical quantization to the resultant theory, do you recover the initial QFT? Unfortunately, I hardly know where to begin thinking about this question. Sorry!"
Physics,3d23xr,duetosymmetry,5,Mon Jul 13 02:41:29 2015 UTC,Here is what is meant by quantization is not a functor.  I can't take a classical system map it to another classical system by some change of variables and then canonically quantize both in a way that preserves that arrow of classical systems.  This question of getting back the initial QFT first is way too strong. You should only ask for unitarily equivalent. So now you can phrase the statement in category terms. Recovering the initial QFT up to isomorphism would be like even if quantization was a functor and taking classical limit an adjoint for it.

Physics,3d23xr,CodyBStrange,3,Mon Jul 13 03:46:28 2015 UTC,"In reply to (2), different renormalization schemes exist because we can write the Lagrangian in a number of ways (for example bare fields, or using renormalization constants for each term). The terms in the Lagrangian are not physical quantities, including the mass factor in the mass factor of L. They are just parameters in our theory.  Upon applying constraints to the self-energy/one-particle irreducible diagrams of our theory so that the pole of the self energy aligns with the actual physical mass, we obtain expressions for the parameters in L. These expressions depend entirely on which L you start with.  Now, we can equate L's of different renormalization schemes, since the scheme should not affect anything physical.  I didn't really answer your question (with respect to the EFT part), but the short of it is, the different renormalization schemes can be used because the terms in L are just parameters (which can be rescaled), and the choice of renorm. scheme is dependent pretty much on which one is simplest to use.  This is my understanding. Please correct anything that is wrong!"

Peculiarities like this lead me to believe that the Lagrangian formalism is superior.   (Yes, there's Hamiltonian densities.) One way in which the Lagrangian formalism is nice in QFT is that if your Lagrangian density is a Lorentz scalar, your whole theory should be Lorentz invariant. Other symmetries are also easily treated, and Feynman diagrams arise quite easily. However, in the path integral picture unitarity is not manifest. A quantum theory must be unitary to be consistent, and even though it's standard to just give a Lagrangian, it should always be remembered that the path integral represents Hamiltonian time-evolution e-iHt, so there are constraints on what Lagrangians are allowed. Path integrals also obscure a lot of information about the Hilbert space.  So there's a bit of a trade-off - it's harder to see Lorentz invariance for a given Hamiltonian but unitarity is easy to check, but the situation is opposite given an arbitrary Lagrangian. There's a cute story about Feynman getting flustered trying to explain his diagrams at a conference where Dirac repeatedly asked, ""Is it unitary?""

Physics,3cughh,duetosymmetry,24,Sat Jul 11 15:28:01 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Lagrangian emphasizes symmetries, Hamiltonian emphasizes unique evolution and knowing the number of dynamical degrees of freedom.  Some other commenters (/u/0PingWithJesus, /u/CodyBStrange) already mentioned that the Lagrangian makes it easier to see the symmetries of the physics. This is intimately related to the fact that the Lagrangian ought to be gauge-invariant and Lorentz invariant (more technically: it should be in the trivial representation of all the groups which act on the fields)[1]. This is because the action ought to be a scalar (the action appears inside the exponential in the path integral formulation).  However, when the Lagrangian has these symmetries, that means the Euler-Lagrange (E-L) equations[2] also exhibit such symmetries. This means that the E-L equations are not well-posed as an initial value problem! If you start with some initial state of the fields and evolve to a final state, you can freely add pure-gauge modes and still satisfy the E-L equations.  Let's say you want to study the evolution from the point of view of an initial value problem—say you want to slap the equations on a computer to simulate them.  Then the Lagrangian is, sadly, not much of a friend.  Ok, you say, I'll look at the Hamiltonian instead, so you try to perform the Legendre transformation as usual.  Now you find the same symmetries which led to non-uniqueness in the E-L equations leads to non-uniqueness in inverting the momenta in terms of the velocities in the Legendre transformation. Oops!  This is the well-known phenomenon of having more degrees of freedom than needed to describe the dynamics.  It leads to the Dirac prescription of Hamiltonian dynamics, which has a very nice geometrical interpretation. I recommend the nice book by Henneaux and Teitelboim, or the older text by Hanson, Regge, and Teitelboim.  Basically, it means that the physical phase space where Hamiltonian dynamics takes place is really a sub-manifold of the whole phase space, and you need to add constraints. These constraints break up into first-class and second-class, which are distinguished by being gauge or non-gauge constraints.  In the end, you end up gauge fixing so that the evolution is uniquely determined. At the same time, you learn what are the true dynamical degrees of freedom, and how many degrees of freedom were just gauge. You have learned something about the physics through a purely algebraic procedure. Doing so from the Lagrangian standpoint is much more subtle.  As a final note, let me add that this constraint-fixing (including gauge-fixing) can find its way back to the Lagrangian formulation. If you want to generate Feynman rules (as /u/mofo69extreme alluded to), you need to add some gauge-fixing terms to the action, or else you'll get the wrong physics out. Essentially, these gauge-fixing terms break the manifest symmetries of the Lagrangian. You end up with equivalent physics but are restricted to a particular gauge choice. This gets pretty hairy in the path integral formulation of QFT and you start needing Faddeev-Popov ghosts and BRST quantization. Here be dragons.  [1] It should actually also exhibit ""general covariance"", i.e. it should be diffeomorphism invariant under choices of coordinates on the manifold and fibres. This automatically implies local Lorentz invariance.  [2] I'm going to say the E-L equations in place of 'the equations of motion upon variation of the action'."
Physics,3cughh,dp01n0m1903,7,Sat Jul 11 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"David Morin has some notes on Hamiltonian Mechanics (PDF) in which he says:   Although the Hamiltonian method generally has no advantage over (and in fact is invariably much more cumbersome than) the Lagrangian method when it comes to standard mechanics problems involving a small number of particles, its superiority becomes evident when dealing with systems at the opposite ends of the spectrum compared with “a small number of particles,” namely systems with an intractably large number of particles (as in a statistical-mechanics system involving a gas), or systems with no particles at all (as in quantum mechanics, where everything is a wave).   Later on, in section 15.2.4 he adds:   In practice, the general procedure for solving the 2n Hamilton’s equations is to eliminate the n momenta pi in favor of the n coordinates qi and their derivatives qi'. This produces n second-order differential equations in the coordinates qi (as we found in the harmonic-oscillator and central-force examples above), which means that we’re basically in the same place we would be if we simply calculated the n E-L equations or wrote down the n F = ma equations. So certainly nothing is gained, at least in the above two examples, by using the Hamiltonian formalism over the Lagrangian method or F = ma. As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, this is invariably the case with systems involving a few particles; nothing at all is gained (and usually much is lost, at least with regard to speed and simplicity) when using the Hamiltonian instead of the Lagrangian formalism. In the latter, you write down the Lagrangian and then calculate the E-L equations. In the former, you write down the Lagrangian, and then go through a series of other steps, and then finally arrive back at the E-L (or equivalent) equations. However, in other branches in physics, most notably statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian formalism ranges from being extremely helpful for understanding what is going on, to being absolutely necessary for calculating anything useful."
Physics,3cughh,0PingWithJesus,3,Sat Jul 11 02:53:57 2015 UTC,"I believe there's a line somewhere in Peskin & Schroeder that says the Lagrangian is used in QFT b/c it makes the various symmetries obvious, whereas the Hamiltonian can occlude them (though they're still there). Additionally the Lagrangian leads naturally to the path integral formalism. Whereas that is not the case with the Hamiltonian. Though this is all half-remembered so someone can correct me if I'm at all wrong."
Physics,3cughh,CodyBStrange,2,Fri Jul 10 23:22:44 2015 UTC,"The path integral approach uses the exponentiation of the action of the system, which in turn is the '4-integral' of the Lagrangian density."
Physics,3cughh,CodyBStrange,3,Sat Jul 11 00:15:26 2015 UTC,"The Lagrangian formalism is incredibly useful in QFT since it allows you to essentially read off the Feynman rules for any given L. Also, modern QFT uses the path integral approach meaning that we exponentiate the action of the system. So clearly in this case, L is more helpful than H. However, as mofo69extreme said in his post, H allows us to check unitarity quickly.  In either case, it is simple to convert from one to another. It just happens to be the convention that L is used. I believe this is to do with how easy it is to read off the Feynman rules from L as I mentioned above."

I often think about how to capture the essential Physics of the topic to explain to a general audience, and I think it even helps me sometimes to better understand the subject myself. This has become one of the ways for me to even find new research topics as well.  Just recently, I was thinking about how does one explain the fundamental ideas of quantum mechanics. On one hand, I am tempted to go with the concept that ""all potential realities are evolving simultaneously"", but then according to Heisenberg, we cannot say anything about what is going on, in between to consecutive measurements. This caution can be useful for a student, where we can say that if it were possible to prepare several sets of ensemble (not just one), and if at each step of time a different ensemble was measured, then it would appear when all the probability distributions rendered by each were aligned in sequence, as if all possible realities were evolving simultaneously.  But I have lost them by now. We don't have to be absolutely prudish when discussing too abstract concepts with a laymen. At that point, some metaphors or analogies do better job. But for students of Physics it is easier to explain, because then one can talk in more concrete terms.  And I don't know how I got there, but with my previous thought on explaining QM to general audience or an undergrad class, I found a new research topic for myself: application of Bohmian Mechanics in my field of study in conjunction with a recent theory that was developed. So always a helpful exercise, this idea of thinking how to explain it to a laymen, regardless whether one is actually discussing with a laymen or not!"

Physics,3cxw15,TheGreatApe14,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:50:49 2015 UTC,"I hope it's not too divergent from conventional approach, how I was trying to interpret it. I sometimes vacillate between the realistic and probabilistic interpretations. It has been, at times, difficult to accept the probabilistic one, and I used to believe in realistic interpretation for quite some time. There was a paper on arxiv as well, where a thought experiment was said to have shown that probabilistic interpretation fails. But the proponents of that approach did find some mitigating factor in the renunciation. I don't have access to it right now, sorry, but I think you may already know the paper I am alluding to.  With all the uncertainty in knowing which is the right view, I was trying to follow the pioneer himself, Heisenberg, and wanted to be as careful with stating the interpretation as possible, when mentioning the set of ensembles.  As you say, that between measurements the wavefunction evolves by Schrodinger equation, and the wavefunction is known to provide information, inherently statistical in nature, on the results of an experiment. The aspect of the wavefunction that is pertinent to reality is its modulus squared. Even when considering interferences between different states, when we try to get some information out of it, we have to consider the probabilities for various outcomes. If I try to interpret this in classical terms, because that is our only recourse to interpret experiments, while at the same time reconcile the idea of wave-particle duality (knowing that whatever manifests in reality, is not ""wave"" or ""particle"" in the classical sense), then I end up with the view of evolution of all possible realities simultaneously. Not one of them has reached the status of ""real"" in the classical sense, but evolving in a latent manner. I am not saying that this has to be exactly what's going on, but wasn't this the idea espoused in Path Integral formulation of QM, though?  But then, according to Heisenberg, the reason it might sound absurd is that we are trying to explain a quantum mechanical concept with classical terminology. An issue with the fundamental indivisibility of matter (not in the sense of breaking up atoms, but whatever may be the fundamental units of matter, they cannot be apportioned exactly one mode of classical reality). Our conception of classical reality seems to be a consistent hindrance in comprehending the atomic realm.  I would like to try and get as close as possible in understanding the right approach, if there is one. If you would like to share some material on a better way to interpret QM, then please do. That is always a great way to understand the subject thoroughly!  EDIT: This ended up being quite a long reply. Perhaps an exemplification of the incessant struggle in trying to ascertain the true nature of the atomic realm and, in general, reality."
Physics,3cxw15,attofreak,2,Mon Jul 13 11:15:54 2015 UTC,"These issues are tricky, I agree. I imagine the paper you refer to may be the PBR theorem (http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3328), which does indeed rule out interpreting the quantum state as being merely a probability distribution over underlying variables (unless we resign ourselves to extremely unpalatable consequences.)  However, if we accept the wavefunction as straightforwardly real, always, and without any extra ontology (e.g. Bohmian corpuscles), we're led inexorably to the Everett interpretation. Which is, of course, non-orthodox. Rather than try to argue for that move, here's a few comments instead:   Since the early days of quantum theory, we've got a better handle on the kinds of interpretational moves available. Quantum theory is philosophically complicated. Hence, be suspicious of a single ""correct"" interpretation being available in one of the founding fathers. I broadly agree with your gist that quantum theory is largely about the simultaneous evolution and interaction of several ""parts"" of the quantum state, e.g. in the path integral approach. The position you describe sounds close to Bohr's, in which experiments must be interpreted ""in classical terms"". One can debate this, but for what it's worth I don't think this tracks the practice of modern physicists. Attempts to find a deeper theory than quantum theory (e.g. string theory) don't worry about cashing out all their concepts in ""classical terms"", and for good reason. Theories often postulate their own microscopic ontology. Then if the microscopic ontology is found to A) successfully account for experimental results, and B) be indispensible, I think we can justify calling it real. Case in point: quarks.   For one good review of the measurement problem which incorporates discussion of an ""orthodox interpretation"", I recommend http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0149."

But really, enumerating the points made, and cross-referencing them helps reinforce what I just read.  That said, Landau is great for gaining intuition, for using symmetries to avoid complicated calculations, but I felt it was lacking in Hamiltonian mechanics.  For Goldstein, I urge the second edition. Its discussion of the Cayley parameters helps gain greater intuition about spinors; this discussion was omitted in the third edition, for some reason..."

Edit: If you want some evidence my assertion, take a look at Unistats, select a course at a University and then look at the column called Entry Information. If you collate that with the actual entry requirements, you'll notice some top ranked Universities for Physics in the UK accept people who don't make their offers more than others.

The statistics on actual the actual grades with which people enter Universities do seem helpful, but wouldn't it be difficult to see the difference between people having dropped 20 points at AS vs having dropped 20 points at A2 etc? Even so, the raw point values will hopefully be enough on their own, thanks for the suggestion. It seems like most top Universities go with a standard A*AA offer (at least for Physics), so it'll certainly be of benefit if I can figure out which ones will take slightly lower actual grades.  Going back to the original point, it would have been better for me to mention that my motivation is only partly interview based. While going further than the syllabus is what places like Oxford expect from candidates, I also want to do it simply because I don't want to wait any longer before studying the parts of Physics I find the most interesting, at least within the realms of what I can accomplish through independent study.

Physics,3cu765,DontBuyIvory,3,Fri Jul 10 20:28:53 2015 UTC,Depends on what you are charging and what sort of regulator is used to produce the 5v.    In general for maximum power transfer you want to match the source impedence to the load impedence.  6W is actually quite a bit to get out of a standard USB output.
Physics,3cu765,John_Hasler,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:41:58 2015 UTC,"Hi John_Hasler,  I have two batteries. One takes 15-19V:1.3A input, which I can plug directly into the solar panel. The other battery is a standard portable USB battery which I charge via the 5v.   My question is, on a cloudy day, should I have both batteries plugged in, or will the current be so low that it would be inefficient to do so? And if I were to choose one to plug in, which should it be?  Thank you very much in advanced."
Physics,3cu765,John_Hasler,2,Sat Jul 11 06:53:36 2015 UTC,You are probably better off not using the USB output but I don't have enough information to really say.

Physics,3cu765,Iforgotmylastacctnam,0,Fri Jul 10 20:38:46 2015 UTC,"The output of the solar panel is not dependent upon which voltage output you use. The power emitted by the solar cells is entirely dependent upon the quantity of light that it absorbs.  The wavelength matters but there isn't a difference in wavelength from the Sun. Once the light is absorbed and the electricity generated, it is collected in a battery.  The output of the battery is sent to a voltage regulator that determines the level of voltage that is output, but the output voltage does not affect the absorption of the light, the creation of electron flow, or the collection of those electrons in the battery."

So, for 20 billion transistors in 2D, in 3D we'd have 2.82 quadrillion transistors at 7nm. I wonder how they'd get rid of the heat...  My guess is that scientists will have to switch paradigms to make 3D chips really useful. Neuromorphic chips, perhaps?"

I ended up just finishing the math degree, but I can tell you it is more difficult to get scholarships and loans and impossible to get federal aid for another bachelors. So you will probably be funding it alone, whereas you will be able to find funding for graduate work.    Also the better job outlook I thought I would have with a non humanities degree, has done nothing for me. There are a lot of people applying to the same jobs with masters degrees.    I spent about four years getting the second bachelors instead of the two to three I would have spent in law school or a masters and at the end of it, I kind of just missed studying philosophy and wanted to go back to it.    I wouldn't recommend this path. I think your time would be better spent getting a MBA or law degree or even going into philosophy of science. If it is what you really want to do though, none of that should stop you. So, I guess it depends how strongly you are drawn to science."

Learning how to program at a level useful to a tech company is something that takes at least a year or two of hard study and practice."
Physics,3cqsut,baialeph1,4,Mon Jul 13 01:45:07 2015 UTC,you're wrong. you could be employable in 3 months of 3-4 hours a night study. coding boot camps are proof of this.   see you're imagining that you need to know algorithms and data structures and OSes and the network stack and how a compiler works and everything else they teach you in an undergrad cs curriculum. the truth is you don't need to know any of that because modern software engineering isn't that at all. everything now is abstracted away into ready to use libraries. you just need to know the basics and how to read docs. will you be able program very well? of course not. but you don't need to do anything very well these days to make a living at it. will you still be getting paid 60-70-80k/year? absolutely.
Physics,3cqsut,ice109,2,Mon Jul 13 03:14:49 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Opps, sorry, I meant to reply to the OPs post.  Hi.  I got a degree, double major, in applied maths and economics. I've been working part time in finance for a year now.  However, I took online courses from DePaul (not Devry, DePaul is a decent national university in Chicago) University after I graduated to pursue an MS in computer science. The reason being, despite it being a fairly expensive school, is that you can receive more federal student aid after you get your bachelors degree only if you are studying in a graduate program. Now with my applied maths degree I took NO computer science courses. However, DePaul University let's one enroll in its CS program even if your undergrad degree is in a completely related field to CS (I mean the math is good obviously, but they still would have accepted me with a Philosophy degree for instance). You just have to take a sequence of graduate level intro courses to get you up to speed (they are decently challenging usually).  I would have gone forward with the program after the first course (which I got a B in, because working full time at the same time was tough) but I have decided to take as many courses as possible at my local community college to lower costs.  Anyway, my point is, if you can't find a job, there's a good chance you can find some graduate programs that will accept you without having a physics degree. Some of which are probably online and through accredited universities. The only reason I can see you opting for an MS over bachelors though, is to obtain the financial aid. Which this is really the only way."

From the statement above it sounds like right now you are a professional student - no mention of employment goals. This is no good. It is of course nice to know things, be generally well read and smart and have degrees but... without knowing what it is you want to actually do and proactively trying to achieve that none of the degrees or books you've studied will amount to anything more that personal pleasures.  It is good that you are 'still thrilled by biotech' (the way you phrase it makes it sound like a fancy or passing phase rather than a life long conviction) but ask yourself what are the jobs available, what would you like to do specifically in the field and what do you need to start off on an employment path."

As far as I know most Physics students I have met at my university usually understand that moving into a masters program for engineering, or working through their Phd in order to become a professor are really the most ecomical career paths someone getting their bachelors in Physics. If your intention is to generate a decent income from your education then I think moving into computer science as a masters program would again be a good choice.  I also firmly believe that you can teach yourself physics if you want to learn it that badly. Between all the lectures available now on MIT's website, khan academy, etc, you can learn anything you want to know about physics. The Feynman Lectures are also fantastic. Anyway, if you really want to learn physics, just keep reading."

If this is what you definitely want as a career, then again I would follow the computer science path. With that degree there is a lot you can do with it and it seems that there are a lot of jobs in computer related industries (electrical/computer engineering, programming, IT, etc).  I was under the impression you simply just wanted to learn Physics, which you can totally do on your own. I am a Mechanical Engineering major but really wanted to do Physics, which is actually my minor. I have enough of a math and physics background where I can read books, watch lectures and be able to understand the concepts involved and learn on my own when I want to. I just was smart enough to know that a bachelors in Physics can make it tough to find a job in that area, at least on that will pay on the scale of an engineering job.  I would be hard pressed to suggest going back and starting all over getting another bachelors degree, it is basically what I am doing now and to say the least, it is very difficult. Getting financed can be the biggest challenge since most people have their Pell LEU used up from their first bachelors, so that money from the government you are now no longer eligible for. This means that most of your costs are going to have to come from loans, unless you just happen to have a pile of cash laying around to fund another go round at university. I would say this has been the biggest hurdle for me so far. The work itself for me really isn't that hard, but the logistics and financial burden it has put on me has strained almost every aspect of my life. I have almost had my car repossessed on multiple occasions and my credit has basically been ruined, even though I have a job/internship and make some money while I'm taking classes.

Pursuing as science as a civilian is a lot more fun.  Not being able to get the Pell anymore indeed makes it tough. Taking together what you and other have told me, I think what I'm going to do is take the GRE, apply to some grad school programs, but in the meantime take a few physics/bio courses at the local community college.

I'm doing my degree because I want to, I would be glad even to do it and end up not working in it (though I want to).

Physics,3co2l5,oneona,3,Thu Jul 9 12:13:40 2015 UTC,"It is a beautiful idea that we can use cosmology to learn about fundamental physics. Before the Planck satellite there were hopes that we may observe non-Gaussianity in the CMB and hence the CMB would provide information about particle interactions. Last year, there were claims of a detection of primordial gravitational waves. Alas to date, we have no confirmation of any new observables. I guess I'm starting to worry that there may simply not be much more we can detect.   However, despite the lack of a detection of useful primordial numbers, recently discussion relating to non-Gaussianity seems to have resurfaced, in part thanks to a new paper on the subject by two heavyweights --- Nima Arkani-Hamed, Juan Maldacena ""Cosmological Collider Physics"". They reemphasise the theme of this talk --- that we could in principle learn an enormous amount about particle physics from early universe cosmology, but it seems that no one has any clue what is a realistic amplitude for these signals, and hence whether or not this is a sensible pursuit.   In light of this what do people think should be done? Science progresses fastest when there is a dialogue between theorists and experimentalists. But here we have the somewhat awkward situation that theoretical progress is slow in part due to our failing to find new observables. But on the other hand the theoretical status of inflation leaves much to be desired and hence theorists are failing to provide experimentalists with any kind of guidance of what to look for. So now what?"

Assuming the tension is merely the weight seems fallacious to even non-physics people because you can clearly see that both masses are moving.

Arguably OAM got the 2014 Nobel prize in chemistry, but really it was just donut beams, meaning beams with zero intensity in the center (which are a characteristic of beams with angular momentum but can also carry zero OAM). People used a technique of stimulated emission and depletion with these donut beams to do sub-wavelength microscopy. As far as actually using OAM, though, things are still up in the air. There have been plans to use OAM as a new basis set for data transmission, especially in free space. You can use it to impart a small torque to particles, so people have used it to make small groups of particles (bacteria sized, say) revolve around each other. Miles Padgett suggested using it to do precise measurements of rotation, that a beam striking a rotating object will experience a photon frequency shift proportional to its OAM and the rotational frequency (analogous to a rotational Doppler shift). Dunno, it's a property of photons that people are still just starting to exploit after it was basically rediscovered a decade or so ago."

A lot of recent physics (at least at APS april 2015) has been with Einstein's gravitoelectric-magnetic solutions (to his field equations)...from what I could tell, it suggests that spacetime can have an energy density (the reason we're searching for gravitational waves) and that that energy density is in some aspects due to the motion of charged particles. I'm not really sure to take it from there, but if you're interested, check out that gravitoelectric stuff, I think that would be the best place to start."

Attosecond Physics is quite a vast field, ranging from studying the single electron ionisation process in strong fields, the extremely high order harmonics that could be generated from them, to study more intricate interactions of the electrons in the system, tunnelling ionisation, and a very unique kind of nonadiabatic dynamics, that is a bridge between the optical tunnelling and multiphoton regime of strong field ionisation, and also the most intriguing domain of operation."

Physics,3cm0qv,littlegreensir,5,Thu Jul 9 03:01:58 2015 UTC,"I always have to ask this question but have never seen a satisfactory answer:  What does happen to photons that never hit anything? If a photon leaving our galaxy now doesn't have anything ahead of it in the first 45 billion years, then due to space expanding during the flight anything it could have hit will still be over 45 billion light years away right? (Perhaps 45 billion isn't enough, but there will be such a number) So the photon will never hit anything at all. How does that jibe with explanations I hear that all photons start and end at a charged particle?   To make it more explicit, imagine the far future when every galactic cluster besides our own has left the cosmic horizon. Will stars, etc. in the cluster only emit light toward each other?! If not, what happens to photons emitted away from the cluster?"
Physics,3cm0qv,king_of_the_universe,2,Thu Jul 9 15:55:55 2015 UTC,"How does that jibe with explanations I hear that all photons start and end at a charged particle?   That idea started with the Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory, which essentially says that the laws of electrodynamics are time-symmetric. In that case, the emission of a photon is just the time-reversed absorption of a photon.  Here's a post which discusses it: At Least There Is Symmetry. As the post mentions, Feynman eventually abandoned this theory, particularly because of problems with self-interaction of charges.  More generally, the idea that physical laws are time-symmetric is called T-symmetry:    In theoretical physics, T-symmetry is the theoretical symmetry of physical laws under a time reversal transformation. [...] Although in restricted contexts one may find this symmetry, the observable universe itself does not show symmetry under time reversal, primarily due to the second law of thermodynamics. Hence time is said to be non-symmetric, or asymmetric, except for equilibrium states when the second law of thermodynamics predicts the time symmetry to hold.   However, this doesn't mean that someone using time symmetry is entirely wrong - it depends how they're using it. As is often the case in physics, models tend to have a domain within which they work well, but then break down when the domain is expanded or changed. The quote above mentions that ""in restricted contexts one may find this symmetry.""  The early universe exhibited time symmetry, and local systems can be usefully treated as having this property, too.   But at cosmological scales, phenomena such as thermodynamics and metric expansion of space tend to break the simpler properties of local systems.  If we assume time symmetry is not respected at cosmological scales - your example is one case where this seems likely - then what we would expect to happen to such photons is that they would be redshifted to the point of undetectability."

Physics,3cm0qv,antonivs,3,Thu Jul 9 06:43:57 2015 UTC,"They could be relatively at a standstill and still ""move"" apart faster than the speed of light, because the expansion of space is not motion. Space just becomes more in every place, so if you measure again in a few minutes, you'll measure a greater distance even though the objects in question didn't actually move at all.

Physics,3cm0qv,HyperfinePunchline,2,Thu Jul 9 08:20:26 2015 UTC,"Earth would likely be outside the observable universe at that point.

Physics,3cm0qv,Lazarus5214,2,Thu Jul 9 06:32:36 2015 UTC,I'm entirely fascinated with this question. It probably deserves its own post!
Physics,3cm0qv,Adruna,2,Thu Jul 9 06:32:12 2015 UTC,Yes and no. The issue with a vacuum is virtual particles appearing within it. Thus no true vacuum can ever exist. However we can redefine a vacuum to be a region in which the net energy is zero. However even if we were to create a region like this it would be extremely unstable because certain antiparticles would annihilate on the walls of the vacuum chamber and thus increase the internal net energy above zero.
Physics,3cm0qv,A_FLYING_MOOSE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:01:26 2015 UTC,"Consider a region of space with absolutely no particles in it whatsoever except pairs of virtual particles which are appearing and immediately annihilating almost constantly.  Those are the only particles in this region of space.  No oxygen atoms, no hydrogen atoms, not even a single quark.    Now consider this region of space at a VERY lucky point in time when there are not even any virtual particles in it.  Not a single quark or even a virtual particle in this region of space, at this lucky point in time where the most recent virtual particles have just been annihilated and no virtual particles have yet been created.    Would that be a true vacuum, or does the fabric of spacetime itself carry an energy that would STILL make this theoretical vacuum have a net energy greater than zero?  If the fabric of spacetime itself carries a certain amount of energy, regardless of what is contained within it, then does light EVER move at c?  Furthermore, consider the Casimir effect, in which a region of negative energy is created between two metal, parallel plates.  Now consider a region in which the positive energy around the plates PERFECTLY balances the negative energy between the plates.  This region would have a net energy of zero, yet surely it wouldn't be considered a vacuum.  So can we redefine a vacuum to be a region in which the net energy is zero?"
Physics,3cm0qv,Aeschylus_,-4,Thu Jul 9 18:50:49 2015 UTC,That's a really good point.   Most people don't realize that special relativity assumes 1)the laws of physics are the same for all frames of reference and 2) light travels the same speed in every reference frame.   From there it's a bit of algebra to prove that photons experience no time.
Physics,3cm0qv,MayContainPeanuts,8,Thu Jul 9 06:13:55 2015 UTC,It is not a question of being well defined. A photon does not have a reference frame at all.

Physics,3cm0qv,rumnscurvy,3,Thu Jul 9 04:57:03 2015 UTC,Do you know how to do a lorentz transform? If not here's the page on wikipedia with the defintion. The relevant thing to look at is the γ factor out front. Notice how the denominator has this 1-(v/c)2 term. If v=c (e.g. where a photon would be at rest as it's velocity goes to zero) γ goes to infinity as 1/0 is undefined. Therefore the transform makes no sense as the x' and t' coordinates for your new time and space have no meaning as they are now undefined and infinite. Therefore you can't be in the rest frame of a photon.
Physics,3cm0qv,unillhexium,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:47:31 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.  I learned the transforms, but its been awhile, so very rusty."

The photon's wavelength is associated with oscillations in quantities that we observe in our reference frame (i.e., electric and magnetic field magnitude) in which photons do experience time change. This is okay, because the magnitude of electric and magnetic field are not intrinsic to the photon itself. Nothing about the photon changes in time."
Physics,3cm0qv,diazona,2,Thu Jul 9 01:44:09 2015 UTC,"Any Idea why there are there oscillations in our reference frame, and how photon energy is tied to the frequency of those oscillations?"
Physics,3cm0qv,K3R3G3,2,Thu Jul 9 02:08:16 2015 UTC,"Well, remember that light behaves both as a particle and as a wave. In classical physics, light is an oscillating electric field, which generates an oscillating magnetic field, which generates an oscillating electric field, and so on. These fields oscillate with a certain wavelength, and they propagate forward at a finite speed that we know as the speed of light. Electric and magnetic fields store potential energy, so changing them like this requires an amount of energy that increases proportionally to the frequency at which they oscillate. This is the energy associated with the photon.  So where does the particle come in? Well, quantum field theory tells us that not all electric and magnetic fields are possible-- they are ""quantized"" into specific, discrete possible states. A photon is associated with a specific wave of a specific frequency, and all allowed electric / magnetic fields can be represented as a sum of the waves associated with a large number of photons. Mathematically, then, there are oscillations in our reference frame because photons are really just decompositions of fields that we observe."

Doing this in a manner compatible with the error correction is sometimes not so easy. Magic state distillation is a method that has been proposed to get around this. 4: You have your gates, you need to know the best way to apply them in order to run whatever program you are interested in.

Physics,3cfq28,BadgerFlame,23,Tue Jul 7 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"I'm a ""youngster"" at a school known for their high percentage of ""non traditional"" students (adults, ex-military, etc) and the common enemy of coursework brings everyone together and the atmosphere is generally very friendly."
Physics,3cfq28,entreri93,11,Tue Jul 7 20:43:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a 31 year old grad student and I can safely say that it was normal-ish. When I was doing my undergrad (age 26-30), it was a little wierder because there were times (like my third year) where people would say things in class like ""We're going drinking! <x> has just turned 21!"" and I'd feel absurdly old. In grad school, that comes up a lot less since the others are generally at least 23-24ish and a most are in their mid to late 20's (particularly in phd tracks)."
Physics,3cfq28,Avilister,6,Tue Jul 7 20:17:23 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, they forget my age. I'm just one more student suffering through the same class.  I work with a few of them, doing research. The 3 advisors I work with are only 3 years older. They remember my age, and treat me differently, but in a good way. They listen to me much more than the other students, and they ask my opinion on topics other than research."
Physics,3cfq28,uniSean,4,Tue Jul 7 21:05:28 2015 UTC,Yeah this was the general consensus with all our lecturers. They said they would much rather work with mature students as opposed to 'immature' students as they called them.
Physics,3cfq28,BadgerFlame,3,Tue Jul 7 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"Eight years is not unheard of for both, depending on the school(s)/advisor(s)/topic(s), but I don't think it's common either. You should have no problem being out well before then!"

Physics,3cfq28,uniSean,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:31:00 2015 UTC,"Working 40 hrs a week, not taking classes full time, had to repeat a couple classes (that were prerequisites for core classes). I could only do general ed classes the first 3 years because community college doesn't offer most physics courses.  Edit: Thought you were talking about taking 8 years to get undergrad (which I did). Physics PhD program (in the US) typically take 5-6 years. I'm doing a masters first because of my terrible undergrad performance, and will probably have to repeat the same courses in a grad program.  The 8 years assumption came from me taking 8 to get my B.S.  Edit II: You are usually supported through your masters &/or PhD program. Teaching labs, grading, research, etc... For PhD, the program or your PI (primary investigator, or research advisor) pay your tuition."

Physics,3cfq28,BadgerFlame,19,Tue Jul 7 17:48:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it was a huge decision to make but it will be worth it.  To answer your question, zero. I didn't even complete my leaving cert here in ireland (sat's in america i think?). I dropped out of school to do an apprenticeship, and ended up working on building sites in Australia. I say it was a huge decision to make,but it wasn't necessarily a hard one. I knew if i stayed in a career i hated, and never reached my potential i would never be happy. So i returned to ireland and completed a mature student diploma in foundation science. I got good enough results to be offered a place in physics in one of the best universities in Ireland :)"

Physics,3cfq28,crossingtheabyss,2,Wed Jul 8 02:51:09 2015 UTC,"I'm very focused, much more than when I was attending college in my early 20's.  My learning capacity is strong and doesn't feel it's degraded over the years while my memory seems as good as ever.  People tell me that they are inspired by what I'm doing, but don't feel their ""mature"" brains could handle doing academics.  Hogwash!  With that said, I think our adult responsibilities (family, work, etc...) makes it tough.  When I attended college in my twenties I was way too distracted with all the wrong things, and always regretted not finishing.  Now, I have a tech manufacturing job, make a very decent living, but don't feel fulfilled with it.  Sometimes I wonder if anything will become of my degree because of my age - will I be employable or deemed over the hill.  Regardless, I am determined to finish and give a career change my best go. Fortunately I still look very young for my age and have very good health.  Most people are shocked to learn the truth (even the kids at school thought I was in my 30s so that felt good).  Ultimately, I say if you are unhappy with your current employment and are considering a college education then at least give it a shot.  Don't discourage yourself in the process by overloading the first semester.  Take only a course or two depending on your daily responsibilities.  The experience will be rewarding, and doesn't come without it's challenges.  But then, what does?  Edit. grammar"

Physics,3cjmum,iorgfeflkd,8,Wed Jul 8 14:56:54 2015 UTC,"While I completely agree that it's not the way to learn physics, I would like to point out that I've found Wikipedia to be a pretty good source when it comes to referencing physics. When you can't quite remember the proper equation, form, or integral to use, it's nice in a pinch. This also applies to surprisingly many niche topics. Again, this is all just in my experience. I think the reason for this is that only the people who are at least somewhat knowledgeable in these areas are the only ones who would edit it i.e. you wouldn't have a troll high school dropout editing the QFT pages as they wouldn't know it existed and you wouldn't have an undergrad editing them because they would understand they don't know enough to do it, leaving mainly experts who are bored enough to edit Wikipedia being the only ones to contribute.  edit: I'm curious myself as I missed this stage... Would a lay person be able to pick up enough from Wikipedia to learn the physics in a conceptual manner? It seems that through school, half the physics you learn is applying math to concepts, and the other half is drawing the concepts from the math. Would Wikipedia be a good source for concepts only, or does it eventually draw to many from the math for the lay person to keep up?"
Physics,3cjmum,jamese1313,4,Wed Jul 8 22:39:33 2015 UTC,I think Wikipedia would do a good job of bringing someone up to date with being scientifically literate. Someone who's thoroughly read the physics content on Wikipedia can probably answer questions about what's true or isn't true and what the state of knowledge is in the field. But it seems (to me) that they would be unable to perform research or work out a problem on paper. Knowing information is a much different skill than generating new information.
Physics,3cjmum,danielsmw,9,Thu Jul 9 11:33:30 2015 UTC,"Possible? Maybe, with a particularly precocious and motivated person. But textbooks are much more pedagogically focused and suited to learn from.  Look how sparse the QFT page is, compared to the many ~1000+ page textbooks devoted to the basics of the subject. Sure there are other related pages, but you'd have to hunt them down to get a mostly complete picture of it. Not to mention many pages are written at different levels from each other. And QFT has a reputation for being difficult even when learning from a standard textbook."

For Cambridge and oxford you have to fish around a bit as they have not only notes but problem sets as well.  i am a big advocate of self education but you need to be careful with it. It helps to have an outside person to ask questions to so you dont get bogged down in trying to grasp minute and ultimately unimportant ideas. Always focus on the big picture."

Do you want to attain understanding of the well-known mathematical tools in modern physics?  Do you want to use those to derive specific answers to predict the unique results of unique aparati?  In some ways, textbooks have no competition, but ultimately nothing compares with having someone explain to you their thoughts on the fundamentals of something and then develop some implications and explain why they are novel or important for later work.

Physics,3cf6dw,warpod,3,Tue Jul 7 13:02:14 2015 UTC,Why rotating black hole has spherical event horizon? I would expect ellipsoid.
Physics,3cf6dw,mofo69extreme,4,Tue Jul 7 14:20:29 2015 UTC,"Be careful with coordinates in GR. even though in standard coordinates, the event horizons are given by a constant radial coordinate r, this does not mean that they resemble spheres geometrically. See this review: http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0622 which shows that the induced geometry of the horizons is not spherical. The article also shows that the horizons can ""look ellipsoidal"" in a particular coordinate system."

Physics,3cf6dw,mofo69extreme,3,Tue Jul 7 22:53:57 2015 UTC,"What is ""look ellipsoidal"" in a particular coordinate system."" means?   Basically, they find that in a particular coordinate system, the horizons satisfy the equation of an ellipsoid in terms of the spacelike coordinates - see equations 126-128 in the linked paper above.   But since the metric isn't Euclidean, the induced curvature of the surfaces is not the same as an ellipsoid or sphere embedded in Euclidean space. In fact, the paper shows that the horizons have negative Ricci curvature in certain places, whereas Euclidean spheres and ellipsoids have strictly positive curvature.   Observers in outer ergoshpere of Kerr black hole will ""see"" the outer event horizon ellipsoidal? Is a particular coordinate system a certain frame of reference? How is ""standard coordinates"" relate to ""human perspective""?   First of all, measurements are always made locally, and you can only ""see"" objects in your vicinity. Really, every measurement an observer makes in GR is represented by some (or many if you send out probes) worldline which you need to contract with various tensors to form a geometric scalar. Since, as I pointed out above, the outer horizon has regions of negative curvature, then an observer measuring curvature in that region would certainly not want to call it an ellipsoid or sphere.  Think about maps of the Earth for example. You can come up with different coordinate systems or projections which will distort the Earth in various ways, e.g. the common Mercator projection turns the north and south poles into lines with the same length as the equator, but someone traversing the poles will clearly find the the poles are points rather than lines. They will also measure a curvature of the Earth which isn't apparent from just looking at a flat map (though if I gave you the coordinates with a metric, you could determine that the Earth is geometrically an ellipsoid)."

This is unfortunate because, stripped of these connotations, it rather nicely captures the way most physicists actually think about the vacuum. ... Subsequent studies with large particle accelerators have now led us to understand that space is more like a piece of window glass than ideal Newtonian emptiness."" -- Robert B. Laughlin, Nobel Laureate in Physics  ""In cosmology, the vacuum catastrophe is the disagreement of over 100 orders of magnitude between measured values of the vacuum energy density and the theoretical zero-point energy suggested by quantum field theory. This discrepancy has been described as ""the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics."""" -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_catastrophe  Does this mean that the quantum vacuum, the energy as a result of quantum fluctuations even in vacuum, is an extremely dense/rigid medium with basically zero viscosity and mass, while being incompressible and transparent?  Could it be that the vacuum energy is actually extremely high and that the difference in the ""vacuum catastrophe"" is simply a measurement issue? Most fluctuations in the vacuum will cancel each other out so when measured as an average the energy will be very low and space will appear ""empty"". And when measuring the individual fluctuations and summing them together individually without taking into account the cancellation effect of the fluctuations on each other, the energy will be extremely high."

Concepts like rigidity and viscosity have little to no meaning in this context. Viscosity requires the medium to have some rest frame to drag stuff down into, which the vacuum does not have. Rigidity could be said to be very high, but only because disturbances propagate at the highest possible speed, and the mechanism for this is so unlike anything in classical physics that these words only serve as very strained and misleading analogies.    Could it be that the vacuum energy is actually extremely high   The vacuum energy is measurable to some extent, since it contributes to the dark energy that causes space to expand at large scales. So if it were very high we would be able to see it. It's quite possible the low measured value has something to do with large positive energies canceling large negative energies.

It's actually bosonic vacuum fluctuations that cancel against fermionic fluctuations. That's why vacuum energy has to vanish in (unbroken) supersymmetric theories, and also why it would address the Higgs fine tuning problem. But since we don't live in an unbroken supersymmetric vacuum, there's no reason for the vacuum energy to have to be zero.  I'd also hasten to add that the statements about the vacuum catastrophe being the ""worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics"", while correct, is based on a clearly dubious assumption. Namely that the Standard Model is correct all the way up to the Planck scale. Any new ingredients introduced at higher energies will alter that calculation (for example, TeV-scale SUSY lessens the discrepancy by a factor of 1060). So its still quite possible for the discrepancy to disappear entirely when the rest of the picture is known, and that's probably one of our best hints going forward."

Physics,3cf6dw,CodyBStrange,2,Wed Jul 8 02:44:42 2015 UTC,"Excluding dark matter/energy, normal matter is made up of atoms. These individual atoms form structures of all shapes and sizes. A simple example of a typical structure could be that of a lattice. The atoms can form bonds between each other and the strength of these bonds helps determine the macro-properties of the substance. For example, stronger bonds means that atoms want to stay 'linked', meaning that your material might be more resistant to shear stress, etc. In any case, the atoms in the lattice are not static. They all vibrate around the equilibrium point of their position in the lattice, but typically in different/random directions. If we blast vibrations into our material with a certain wavelength, the atoms can fall into what is known as a 'normal mode'. Basically, one scenario is that they can end up all vibrating in the same direction, at the same time at the same speed. If we fix the sides of the material and this occurs, the middle of the material could twist and bend until it breaks. This occurred in the Tacoma Bridge incident) in the 40's, and in the Millenium Bridge more recently. Washing machines also suffer from resonant frequency issues, so require damping mechanisms to stop the whole thing shaking violently."

The EPR paradox is a thought experiment that was originally constructed to show how absurd QM's results were, and to poke holes in the theory. The issue with the EPR paradox is that it relies on human intuition, which breaks down when we work on the quantum scale. Essentially, quantum mechanics is a mathematical theory (based of the concept of Hilbert spaces and non-commutative operators, etc.) that has issues if you ask it questions it wasn't designed to answer. This doesn't mean the theory is wrong. To see an analogous example, ask classical mechanics how we can turn two photons into an electron and a positron.   Heisenberg's UP is a property that is common to all wave-like systems (QM is a matter/wave duality theory), and it is a fundamental concept in QM, regardless of whether an observer is there to perform 'actual measurements'. Essentially, even the particle itself can't know its two complementary variables at the same time (e.g. position and mom, energy and time)."

Physics,3cf6dw,CodyBStrange,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:02:38 2015 UTC,"With respect to your last question - take a particle with position x and momentum p. Now, if we look at x and try to increase the precision of that measurement, HUP says that the precision of p decreases. So one way to think of this is mathematically. x and p have wavefunctions of a certain shape. For simplicity, assume that they are both bell curve shaped. Now if we increase the precision of our measurement in x, the bell curve for x becomes narrower, obviously. But because p is the conjugate variable to x, when we look at the wavefunction of p, it has become wider automatically. I think that James Binney's textbook on Quantum Mechanics covers this quite well, if you are interested in a more in depth discussion.  Precise postion and momentum don't really have any meaning in QM. The whole idea of QM is that we can never know everything about the system to infinite accuracy, thus obscuring the predictive capabilities that we had in CM, and meaning that we can only talk in terms of probabilities of the final state occurring. This doesn't affect cause and effect (at least I don't think it does)."

It's a big trope in ""realistic"" sci-fi right now. There's a big move away from artificial gravity (i.e. Star Trek) and to spinning around.  I have a basic understanding of the law of inertia. I know something will attempt to travel in a straight line when given force, so if you spin something fast enough whatever is caught it in it, cannot get out. The whole spinning a bucket of water around in a circle.  Now here's my problem with building a big cylinder and spinning it around to simulate gravity. I've copied and pasted from what I put on that Goodreads thread.:::  So the cylinder has to be of a specific size to match the gravity created by earth, because if the effects are off at all there will be adverse affects on the body which would ultimately kill anyone who lived in space for years at a time.  How big is that size? How fast does it have to move as well? You can't just build a cylinder and spin it up until someone says ""yeah, that feel's about right"". What kind of affects does it have on children, infants, the elderly, obese, all those not in optimum physical health like astronauts are?  Spinning around to simulate gravity sounds pretty nifty, but it's working opposite of how the gravity of celestial bodies works (i.e. Earth doesn't fling us off into space with its spin), so I'm not entirely sold on this spinning to simulate gravity is a great answer; maybe short months long jaunts it would work, but the adverse health affects are likely to be ridiculous because pressure is being asserted onto the body in a way that we were not evolved for.

What that means is if we were taking a measurement at any point in between the source of the photon, and the two slits, we will always get a distribution of photons in accordance with the probability defined through QM.

Come on there are enormous problems in string theory like in higher genus that you would need to solve if you were to use such a top down strategy."

Physics,3ccpan,dwintz,2,Sun Jul 12 18:40:25 2015 UTC,"Good question--the experiment is actually quite nuanced.  The light is first coupled into surface plasmons--which are kind of a hybrid between regular light and electrons oscillating in the metal.  The surface plasmons are confined to propagate on the surface of the metal.  Logistically, you can see why is this hard for a camera to see--the surface plasmons cannot leave the surface and thus cannot get to the camera.  The trick here is a technique called near-field scanning optical microscopy.  We bring a metallic tip (think a nanoscale needle) so close to the surface plasmons that they get scattered out back into being regular light--which we collect with fiber optics."
Physics,3ccpan,harleydt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:17:32 2015 UTC,OMG that's really cool. I really appreciate your time to answer my question!  Does disturbing the surface cause a (relatively) violent reaction? e.g. macroscopic or human viewable? Does disturbing the surface at one point cause the entire system to collapse? or is the scattering local?  I wonder what the applications will be? Invisibility cloak?
Physics,3cd8jw,Doshypewpew,4,Tue Jul 7 00:25:52 2015 UTC,"I'm going to list some theorems that I frequently use instead, since equations rarely capture the big picture:  Extension theorem: given a local field algebra of observables AV and its norm closure A, the time dynamics at,V=e-itHV is an automorphism on A and therefore extends continuously to an operator at=e-itH on A.  GNS representation: this is an explicit construction of a representation on a Hilbert space that guarantees the existence of a Fock vacuum in a non-interacting picture.  Bogolyubov's edge-of-the-wedge theorem: this allows one to analytically continue a function known on a local spacetime domain O (the edge) into its complexification (the wedge), and that if two functions agree on the edge then they must also agree in a strip of the wedge.   Goldstone's theorem: given a symmetry generated locally, on the time-invariant supalgebra A0 of the field algebra A, by a Noether charge Q and broken on some operator in A0 , the spectrum of the current carries ""Goldstone modes"", i.e. massless boson modes, in the limit of zero momentum.  KMS equivalence: the Green function of a thermal state satisfies the KMS conditions if and only if they define a Gibbs' state. This allows one to construct thermal states from field algebras along.  Classification of topological defects: given a Lagrangean with a Lie group of symmetries G and its stability subgroup H on which state vectors are invariant, the degeneracy space is given by R=G/H (G modulo H) and point-like defects are characterized by the homotopy class π2(R) and string defects by π1(R).  Some interesting ones:  OS-W equivalence: the OS axioms of Euclidean field theory are equivalent to the Wightman axioms in Quantum field theory up to isomorphism.  Kochen-Specker Theorem: this theorem prevents the simultaneous assigning of eigenvalues to self-adjoint Hermitian operators on some Hilbert space and its independence to ""what it's looking at"", i.e. their projections onto invariant subspaces of H don't change on different state vectors. This motivates the development of quantum topos theory, which uses category theory (""topos"" a la Grothendieck) to develop a quantum theory with non-bivalent logic."

Physics,3caqgw,thetorq,8,Mon Jul 6 17:26:03 2015 UTC,"Usually people aren't interested in the slightest with what I'm doing...  What I am doing is a plate model reconstruction of Europa, but instead of a Photoshop mockup, or a purely mathematical method, I'm using some software that is pretty neato to do it. It does two things:  1) The reconstruction is done on a sphere, so it is more accurate than a Photoshop reconstruction, because a flat plane is different than a curved one. If you put a postage stamp on a baseball, it won't fit well. Same principle.  2) It does a rotation pole reconstruction; this essentially is where you put a 'thumbtack' in some part of the globe, and rotate the plate an angle around it.  I was able to re construct two regions from research papers in the software. I cut out the spreading bands, drew boundaries and put them back together  Here's:  The region  The cut away of discrete regions  The final fit  You can evolve the system through time in this software as well. It's super cool  TL:DR: Fitting together plate regions, but on a sphere instead of a flat plane  EDIT: Here are some images without plate boundary lines on them"

Generally I just try to match features, sometimes there are cracks in the surface which can be re-aligned. I started my reconstruction based off of Patterson et. al. 2006, with this image where the cracks are drawn (a matches up with a', etc) and the numbers on the right image represent plate regions.  I ended up redrawing the borders because if you look at an image all day you see new things, but that's an easy way of looking at it."

ICOOL and G4beamline match up perfectly with eachother, but WARP won't seem to agree. Although, I'm using WARP for something it was never designed for, an actual accelerator simulation instead of a simple multi-particle sim.   The end result though will hopefully give some insight into ionization cooling of muons. Naturally, this process creates a plasma, and although most calculations are pretty much solid, the interaction between the beam and the plasma generated by the beam hasn't been studied. The inside math shows that it won't harm the beam cooling, but so far qualitative sims show it to actually help quite a bit. My job is to figure out how much."

Physics,3cee1m,Ooker777,4,Tue Jul 7 06:54:47 2015 UTC,"Your diagram is equivalent to changing your unit system so that c takes a different value. The actual values of the lengths is arbitrary- a universe where c has twice its current value is entirely indistinguishable from a universe where all lengths are multiplied by 1/2. If you multiply all times by some constant factor, no one within the universe would be able to tell, which means you're not actually doing anything to it at all."
Physics,3cee1m,Snuggly_Person,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:57:54 2015 UTC,What I mean in the image is that the universe expands. It doesn't relate to the changing of light velocity (I guess).
Physics,3cee1m,5secondstozerotime,4,Tue Jul 7 15:13:11 2015 UTC,"Expands compared to what though? There is no difference between saying ""everything is getting bigger"" and declaring ""the size denoted by 'one meter' will shrink by 5% each year"". An old ""meter stick"" is now out of date, since the meter has shrunk. Or is it that an old meter stick has physically grown, and so now measures more than a meter (even though it still measures absolutely every single object the same way)? There is no difference. In both scenarios an object that was previously five meter sticks tall is still five meter sticks tall, even if we want to say that the sticks no longer measure the current definition of 'meter'. I can claim that absolutely everything in the universe is uniformly expanding, or contracting, or whatever. There is no distinction between any of these scenarios; the apparent difference is entirely meaningless unless that ""reference meter"" actually has a definition. You are treating the numbers in front of measurements as if they are not tied to statements about real objects. What ""this building is 10 meters tall"" means is ""there is a standard measuring stick held safe in a vault somewhere, and if you stuck 10 identical copies of it on top of each other the result would match the height of this house"". Measurement is defined in terms of how objects relate to each other; the number by itself has no meaning. Saying something is 5 tall says nothing. Saying something is 5 meters tall means something, since it's a physical statement about stacking objects. Trying to give absolute meaning to the numbers themselves leads you out of physics entirely, since it gets hung up on the particular wording you use to describe logically identical scenarios."
Physics,3cee1m,5secondstozerotime,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see what makes it unclear here. What I mean is this happens from the outside observer . This one needs to be from another dimension (think about that ant-man from their line universe and us seeing the expanding of that universe). Both the inside and outside observer have the ruler in their hand. At first, those ruler is the same, but after the expansion, only the outsider can notice what happens. This one communicates to the insider about this. When I say:    Theoretically, the length of the universe is 8 meters, but experimentally, it must be 10 or 11 meters.   , the theoretical part is from the insider, while the experimental part is from the outsider.  So, my question actually is: from the outsider perspective, will the age of the insider's universe gets longer, even if its time doesn't flow anymore?"
Physics,3cavk7,RaoOfPhysics,8,Mon Jul 6 13:53:20 2015 UTC,"Butterworth links to another response by Chad Orzel, and summarizes:   Orzel argues that physics (and by implication science in general) should be open and people should get used to results being provisional, with frequent updates and corrections. I agree. Somehow we have to get beyond the opposing extremes that science is either 100% certainly correct, or else just another point of view to which there are many equally valid alternatives.   This. I like this.  Shaping the public perception of science is of course the responsibility of scientists. If scientific knowledge is qualitatively different from other kinds of knowledge -- and it is! This whole ""provisional knowledge"" thing takes some exposure to appreciate -- then it is pretty unfair to place the blame on science journalists, working from a tradition that is based on a different kind of knowledge.  What we absolutely cannot do is think our relationship, as scientists, with scientific knowledge is too precious, too sophisticated, to share with the public. We need to give them the same medicine we feed ourselves. Shielding them from provisional results does nothing to eliminate the dichotomy that Butterworth points out, it just keeps them on hopefully the ""right"" side of it."

Physics,3c8o56,dragonphoenix1,7,Mon Jul 6 04:42:25 2015 UTC,"Notice how the article talks about a ""nitrogen molecule"" and not a ""nitrogen atom"". If you know a bit about chemistry. You'll know that nitrogen molecule is formed by two nitrogen atom, bonded together by a triple bond. Like so. If you want to be nit picky about it, they are rotating about their center of mass. But, there is essentially nothing in the center of those two atoms. If you want to be really nit picky, the empty space between the two atom can be occupied by some probability that an electron will reside there.   To put it into perspective, imagine if you will, two massive earth-like planets, existing in a true ""empty"" space with no external forces acting on these. Naturally, the two planet's gravitational pull will pull the two planet together, but if they are rotating around their center of mass, they can maintain a orbit-like rotation(around their center of mass). The nitrogen molecule is very much like this, except they are being held together by electromagnetic forces, on a sub-nano scale. Now, it is important to remember atoms are not point charges, so they don't behave like planets, but the theory is similar.   I'm a chemist and not a physicist. The information I'm telling you is base on what I know learning physical chemistry. Molecular rotations, like the ones mentioned in the article, is particularly interesting to chemist, so we can predict molecular interactions."

Physics,3c6tfy,BlackBrane,7,Sun Jul 5 11:45:10 2015 UTC,Ok can someone give me a undergraduate level explanation of what's going on in this article?
Physics,3c6tfy,Globalscree,10,Sun Jul 5 13:22:58 2015 UTC,"Here's my (somewhat limited) understanding:  The easiest way to formulate a theory is not necessarily in terms of the physically meaningful fields. E.g, electromagnetism is more naturally formulated with the 4-potential as the field of interest. However, the potential isn't entirely physical, since gauge transformations can change its form without changing the physics. A path integral over all possible values of A is then not really what we want when computing features of QED through path integrals. What we really want is to consider each physical configuration once and exactly once. The Gribov ambiguity is a barrier to achieving this simply by gauge fixing, where one can show that no gauge fixing procedure can pick one and only one representative from each gauge equivalence class of configurations. Imagine the gauge choices for one configuration as a long strand, each point of which is a possible specification of the field and where all points on one strand represent the same physical configuration. Zooming out to consider all configurations we have a whole sea of strands, which in general may do very nontrivial twists.  A gauge choice is a choice of cut transversal to these strands that cuts each of them exactly once. Depending on the geometry and topology of the space of strands, this may be impossible to do through some local condition on the fields.   In GR this ambiguity becomes a major problem. A naive way of ""integrating over all metrics"" will count reparametrizations of the same spacetime as physical differences. This is particularly relevant for an approach to quantum gravity called asymptotic safety. Basically as we probe a theory to smaller and smaller scales various measurements appear to change; e.g. the apparent mass of the electron changes as we probe it to closer distances. Renormalizing the theory is done by correctly scaling these various parameters as you zoom in; a theory is renormalizable if it's possible to consistently re-scale the theory purely be rescaling finitely many ""constants"" in this way. Generic arguments suggest that gravity is not renormalizable; that the rescaling never stops: you'd need to introduce and rescale more and more constants as you searched for finer and finer effects, which at the very least makes the theory totally non-predictive, and in practice would be suggestive of larger problems. Asymptotic safety suggests that a cancellation between these supposed ""extra parameters"" might occur that is not obvious when you analyze things with perturbation theory, and the theory may in fact be renormalizable when analyzed in full. This is achieved in QCD, for example. The asymptotic safety program of quantum gravity is suggesting that, while the basic attempt at quantizing GR appears nonrenormalizable, such a cancellation might occur letting us turn GR into a well-defined quantum field theory at all scales. The issue being presented here is that various calculations in""partial attempts"" at investigating this possibility are not adequately handling the issues arising in a genuinely global, non-perturbative approach to quantizing GR."
Physics,3c6tfy,Snuggly_Person,7,Sun Jul 5 16:53:53 2015 UTC,"The basic issue has to do with quantizing physical systems that have some redundancy in the description that can't be trivially removed. Yang-Mills theory and general relativity are the most important examples.  There exists an elegant, systematic way to deal with this in the case where you only care about perturbative approximations, or equivalently, only about the local neighborhood of a given configuration. Then there is a clear decomposition of degrees of freedom into the real physical ones and the fake ones  – the ""gauge redundancies"" of your description. I won't go into the technicalities, but the procedure for dealing with this can be summarized by this diagram borrowed from Polchinski. You want to integrate over just the real degrees of freedom, and this procedure amounts to saying that's equivalent to integrating over both the real and fake degrees of freedom and then dividing out the volume of the integral over the fake degrees of freedom (when weighted appropriately).  But there are problems when you try to move beyond the local/perturbative case to the global/non-perturbative case, in theories like 3+1D Yang-Mills or general relativity. The key assumption that breaks down is that each ""gauge orbit"", the space of physically equivalent configurations represented by the vertical directions in that diagram, meets your ""gauge slice"", the space of real configurations you actually want to integrate over (the horizontal line in the digram), exactly once. Globally, they could meet each other zero times or more than one time. This is the basic problem of the Gribov ambiguity that the article deals with.   The basic point of the article is that this is a potentially major issue for the quantum gravity proposal called Asymptotic safety, which asserts that quantum gravity can actually make sense just as a standard quantum field theory. He says that, among other reasons, he's leery of the fact that the Gribov problem doesn't seem to appear in their papers, and that the issue would have to be dealt with if this proposal is to go anywhere."

The Lagrangian is a function R3->R, (x,y,z)->R. x and y are here q and q dot. They are really coordinates and q dot has nothing to do with q.  2) They are considered functions of time once you start speaking about the equations of motion or certain parametrized paths for the action - q(t) and q-dot(t).

Now, on this set acts the operator [;\frac{d}{dt} : \Gamma \rightarrow \Gamma ;]. This operator sends [;q;] to [;\dot q;] where [;(\dot q)(t) = \dot \left( q(t) \right) ;].  In this sense [; \dot q [ q] ;] is a functional of [; q;].  Similarly, the action in a certain time interval is a functional of [;q;] and [;v;], [; S[q,v] : \Gamma \times \Gamma \rightarrow \mathbb{R};]  The question is: why when minimizing the functional [; S[q,\dot q] ;] we can just minimize [; S[q,v] ;] in both variables and then set [;v = \dot q;]?"

As far as I know, we aren't really doing this in the E-L derivation. At the very start of the derivation we explicitly set that the variation in the velocity is the time derivative of the variation in position. From this moment we aren't really minimizing [; S[q,v] ;] in both variables anymore aren't we? Or am I definitely missing something? See the first reply here for example: http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/885/why-does-calculus-of-variations-work.

Physics,3c3qol,Josef--K,2,Mon Jul 6 15:12:43 2015 UTC,"I'm still not sure whether we are missing something or not.  We're supposed to be minimizing the action over the set of trajectories (q,v) such that v is the time derivative of q. But we impose [;\delta S = 0;] before restricting to this subset. Is it automatically true that extremals in a subset are also extremals in the larger domain? I don't think so.  I don't know  EDIT: nah I've thought about it, you're correct, and it's easy  we just compute [;\delta S;] before restricting to the subset, then we set [;\delta S = 0;]. I consider this a proof from a physicist's perspective (but leave the hell of formalization to the mathematicians, since the subset in question is horrendous)."

Physics,3c41oa,John_Hasler,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:36:00 2015 UTC,"Well, the resin looks like a slurry. So epoxy is mixed with silica particles to get the right mechanical and thermal properties. It is placed in an inextensible mold(you can assume it is inextensible because the material has nm scaled expansions at 175 degrees), then baked to 175 degrees and cured to 25 degrees. This makes it a solid with a rather tough bond. So when at a 175deg, the whole thing has no bend. However, it bends at 25 degrees. Further, if it absorbs moisture, it bends more. There is an added issue here, sometimes the moisture causes an increase in the curvature and sometimes decreases. I have no clue why. My idea was to somehow determine the local stress field of the composite material."

Physics,3c3esf,rantonels,6,Sat Jul 4 19:51:01 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the interest!   Sorry about the length of this reply. I’ve tried to make it as succinct as possible. This is the first time I’ve really tried to explain my thinking on this to anyone so I hope it’s at least a bit coherent.  Ok, to back up a bit this all started with the idea that maybe the reason the universe has three spatial dimensions is because any graph can be embedded in R3, so I’ve been trying to formulate fundamental physics in terms of graphs.  The simplest thing I can think of modeling is a QHO. Specifically, one whose base energy level is entirely determined by its mass, using E=mc2. This completely determines the frequency of the QHO, but it turns out we don’t need to think about frequency here, just energy.  So, start with a 2-vertex directed multigraph, with vertices labelled “L” and “R” (left and right). There are m edges connecting L and R, with k of them pointing to the right.   In this model, edges represent mass/energy and position. Each edge is mass M, some super-small fundamental mass, and the mass of the entire oscillator is mM. The position of the system is X(k) = 2k-m. If the directions of the m edges are random, k (and hence X) will have a binomial distribution — the number of ways of having k right-directed edges is just the binomial coefficient C(m,k).  That’s really all there is to the first energy level (n=0) of the QHO — its combinatoric description is just C(m,k). We don’t actually need the X(k) function until we move to the second energy level.  To find the combinatoric description the second energy level (n=1), note that the edges in the two-node graph can be described as an m-tuple whose elements are 1s and -1s; (-1, 1, 1, -1, -1) might describe the edges for a particular graph where m=5. But we can also look at this tuple as an element from C2m, the direct product of m cyclic groups of order 2. This gives us a group operation that allows edge tuples to operate on each other: given two edge tuples of size m, just multiply each pair for a given index to get the new tuple’s element for that index. So (-1, 1, 1, -1, -1)•(1, -1, 1, -1, 1) is (-1, -1, 1, 1, -1).  So edges represent mass/energy, position, and group element.  Now, each time the QHO goes up an energy level, the total energy of the system goes up by 2 times the energy level of the first level. If we’re just dealing with mass, we can model that by adding a vertex to the graph (call it E1) and connecting m edges to L and m edges to R — that is, we’re introducing two new edge tuples. We can then define the position of the QHO at the second energy level as the product of the position at the first level with the two edge tuples that we’re introducing here.  If any pair of E1-to-L and E1-to-R edge tuples was allowed to hook up to any L-to-R edge tuple, this would just create another normal-looking distribution. So if this is going to produce a distribution that looks like the probability distribution we all expect for n=1 for a QHO, there needs to be some rule to filter which combinations of edge tuples are allowed.  Let k0 be the number of right edges at the first energy level, let k1,0 be the number of right edges in the group product of the L-R edge tuple with one of the E1-L and E1-R tuples. Let k1 be the number of right edges when we take this new edge tuple product and find the group product of it and the other of the two edge tuples. (Since C2m is abelian this turns out to just be the product of the (L-R)•(E1-L)•(E1-R), but it’s important to consider the two steps separately.)  I derived my expression by looking at what happens if the rule about which tuples are allowed is that |X(k1,0)| must be greater than or equal to |X(k0)| and |X(k1)| must be greater than or equal to |X(k1,0)| (where || denotes plain old absolute value).  It’s pretty straightforward to show that when you add up all the ways of doing this for a given k, you get the expression above:   [;2\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k} \\ \end{array} }\right)\sum\limits_{j=k}^{m-k}\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {j} \\ \end{array} }\right)\sum\limits_{i=j}^{m-j}\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {i} \\ \end{array} }\right);]  Assuming I’m not completely bonkers and there isn’t something obvious that I’m missing that rules all of this out entirely, my next step is to try to prove that if you turn this into a probability distribution by dividing by the total number of combinations, then change units appropriately, this approaches the usual expression for a QHO with n=1.  At the same time I’m hoping to find a general rule for the nth level of the QHO. Since each additional energy level adds twice the energy of the first level, I think this means adding a new vertex and edge m-tuples connecting it to L and R. The trick is figuring out which edge tuples are allowed for a given n.  Let me know if that helps, makes any sense at all, or comes across as the ravings of a madman. Like I said, this is really the first time I’ve described all of this to anyone.  [Edit: formatting]"
Physics,3c3esf,rantonels,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:15:29 2015 UTC,"I need to think about this.  I would move in this direction: see if you can build the discrete equivalent in your model of the raising and lowering operators; see if they reduce to the differential form of those operators for the QHO.  I'm skeptical there is any interesting physics in this, but the math smells like it is interesting.  EDIT:  having redone the calculation I don't think your distribution for k in the second ""energy level"" is correct.  You have a set of random independent three m-tuples [;t_1, t_2, t_3;] of [;\mathbb{Z}_2;] elements. You want the probability distribution of the number of + elements in the tuple [; t_1\cdot t_2 \cdot t_3;] with the pairwise product. But this is equal to the distribution of the number of + elements in any of the single tuples, and in particular it's equal to the result with only two vertices.  This is because [; a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot a_3 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_n ;] where [;a_i;] are random independent elements of [;\mathbb{Z}_2;] is itself a random element of [;\mathbb{Z}_2;] with uniform distribution, as can be seen for example by induction (or, if [; n=3;], it's straightforward to show by exaustion)."
Physics,3c3esf,deutschluz82,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:57:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll look into this — I definitely want to make sure I derived the right distribution. One thing to note, though, is that the m-tuples aren't actually independent because of the requirement that the |X(t1•t2)| >= |X(t1)|, and similarly |X(t1•t2•t3)| >= |X(t1•t2)|. In other words, the choice of t2 is restricted by the value of t1, and the choice of t3 is restricted by the product of t1•t2. But I'll go through the derivation again from scratch and assuming I come to the same distribution I'll write up what I did instead of glossing over that rather important detail like I did in my initial explanation.  Thanks again!  EDIT: It's worth noting that this only works for the first energy level — to get to the second level there'll need to be a different rule, but hopefully if/when I find that (assuming I didn't screw all this up in the first place), it'll be something similarly simple and there'll be a clear pattern that emerges which shows what rule is required to raise the QHO to the nth energy level."
Physics,3c3esf,deutschluz82,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:14:41 2015 UTC,"Here’s my derivation of the combinatorial function. Let me know if it goes off the rails, but as far as I can tell it’s sound. As I said, this only works with the second energy level — something else has to be taken into account to raise things to the third energy level, which I hope will reveal the general pattern for the nth energy level. (Or I may be totally off my gourd and this is all just a coincidence).  We have three m-tuples, t1, t2 and t3, such that r(t1•t2) <= r(t), and r(t1•t2•t3) <= r(t1•t2), where r(t) is the distance of t from the centre of the distribution, which is just the absolute value of the sum of its components. Let K(t) be the number of right-directed edges in t. Then r(t) = |2K(t)-m|.  Let’s say K(t1) = k1, K(t1•t2) = k2. The question is, given k3, how many ways can we combine t1s, t2s and t3s such that K(t1•t2•t3) = k3?  First let’s look at the number of t1•t2 combos such that K(t1•t2) = k2. t1 is free to be any tuple, but t2 is restricted to being one such that r(t1•t2) >= r(t1). Now, regardless of t1, there are [;\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k2} \\ \end{array} }\right);] t2s such that K(t1•t2) = k2 (since elements in C2m simply perform permutations on each other). Because of the restriction on choice of t2, r(t1) <= r(t2), and this happens when min(k2, m-k2) <= k1 <= max(k2, m-k2). There are [;\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k1} \\ \end{array} }\right);]  t1s such that K(t1) = k1, so the total number of combos here is [;\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k2} \\ \end{array} }\right)\sum\limits_{k1=k2}^{m-k2}\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k1} \\ \end{array} }\right);] (where the summation occurs backwards when k2 > m-k2).  To find the number of combinations of t1•t2•t3, we just repeat this. There are [;\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k3} \\ \end{array} }\right);] ways to pick t3 such that K(t1•t2•t3) = k3, but given min(k3, m-k3) <= k2 <= max(k3, m-k3). There are [;\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k2} \\ \end{array} }\right)\sum\limits_{k1=k2}^{m-k2}\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k1} \\ \end{array} }\right);]ways to pick t1•t2, so this gives us a total of [;\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k3} \\ \end{array} }\right)\sum\limits_{k2=k3}^{m-k3}\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k2} \\ \end{array} }\right)\sum\limits_{k1=k2}^{m-k2}\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k1} \\ \end{array} }\right);].  Finally, this all has to be multiplied by 2, since the t2 edges might be connected to L or they might be connected to R, giving us the final count:  [;2\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k3} \\ \end{array} }\right)\sum\limits_{k2=k3}^{m-k3}\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k2} \\ \end{array} }\right)\sum\limits_{k1=k2}^{m-k2}\left({ \begin{array}{c}   {m} \\   {k1} \\ \end{array} }\right);]"

So the point at which it clumps together it the 'beginning' of the Universe, and it spreads out in two directions, forming two arrows of time pointing in opposite directions."

In those coordinates, 'time' runs forward in our universe, but planes of simultaneity would have time running in reverse in the other universe. I say 'time' because it's coordinate time, not necessarily t-time.   General relativity is full of these sorts of things. Of course, these two universes are causally disconnected, so it's not a particularly valuable prediction from theory. What's the difference between an alternate universe that we can never interact with in any meaningful way, and no alternate universe at all?"

This is persumably is based on a paper somewhere, but the article doesnt really seem to reveal what that paper was about other than this relatively old idea. Perhaps that if you start from a dense to a sparse state, you get more entropy given some likely assumptions..  The arrow of time is not really about anything moving. It is the direction in which the entropy increases.  Now i think about it... Lets say two ""universes"" overlap; have opposite arrows of time, but only have a weak force connecting each other. What civilizations could use the weak force to send information across? Basically the problem is that they can both tell each other about the future."

I just remember thinking to myself exactly how absurd that question is.  Time isn't a static thing, it can compress or expand. Our concept of time is skewed by our proximity to a large gravitational body called our sun. Time doesn't march on, it can stop and restart, but only ever moving forward. Time is like a river. It flows faster in some areas and slower in others. When it joins a lake it can stop, but never move upstream.   One can only judge how old the universe is from our perspective, however from the perspective of the rest of the universe, we might as well not even exist! How old is the universe? The universe doesn't exist inside of time. Time is apart of the universe. Time is a function of gravity on a higher order plane which we know next to nothing about! How can we be the judge of how the universe experiences time when it's actually time that experiences the universe?!"

('theory' is a terribly strong word for silly universes that are created fully formed and run backwards and also can never ever be observed)  Besides no matter which direction the time arrow points, the observers within the universe would always experience time as a progression of events. i.e. there's no difference between time running forward or back. This silly article seems to invoke magic to call into existence a fully formed universe who's history is complete. Then they run the thing backwards.  It also kinda throws thermodynamics out the window with entropy decreasing over time (magic universe's event progression). This kind of thought does not add information. It's philosophy disguised as cosmology."

Regular classical physics is time reversible, but having any finite resolution causes you to lose information as it gets encoded into increasingly subtle correlations that are no longer directly measurable at the original resolution later on (e.g. paint mixing). It's standard for no information to be lost microscopically while entropy increase is still physically meaningful."

Physics,3c0goe,OrganizedChaos,3,Fri Jul 3 19:10:51 2015 UTC,It is a statistical statement that seems completely obvious and ordinary:  The universe naturally proceeds from states that are statistically rare to those that are statistically common.  Locally there are violations of this but this is what you'd expect given the vast size of the universe.    So it might seem at first that this observation is just an uninteresting restatement of well-known statistical laws.  What is profoundly interesting (IMO) however is how the universe got into this low entropy state that seems to have existed at the beginning of time.  That's the part that's weird and mind-boggling and that (correct me if I'm wrong) nobody seems to have an answer for except to suggest maybe it's some unfathomably unlikely statistical anomaly.  The progression away from that state seems to characterize time and so explaining entropy as it was at the beginning of the universe is one of the great unsolved problems of physics.

As a general rule my recommended textbook is the Art of Electronics, which is a gold standard for discussing electronics in terms of practical design decisions, common constructions, and rules-of-thumb. A lot of textbooks prefer to make you solve pointlessly large collections of linear equations that teach you very little about how to design and anticipate the behaviour of actual circuitry.

Physics,3bva1x,squirrel_love,3,Thu Jul 2 14:40:33 2015 UTC,"Depends what branch of nuclear physics you're talking about, whether it be pure nuclear physics, nuclear engineering, radiation detection, medical physics, health physics, etc. it also highly depends on where in the world you live. If you're in the US, it greatly depends on what part of the country you're in. Nuclear engineering jobs are sort of in a transient phase right now as the world determines the energy generation landscape for the coming generations. That being said, those doing the hiring are fairly timid. Health physics is great if you're in an area with a lot of nearby hospitals. Medical physics is similarly great but takes years of school work and residencies to even get into the field.  My background is in radiation physics and I work at a company that makes scintillators for various detection purposes in Massachusetts and I have a bachelors, currently working on my masters. It took a little while to find a job but it was by no means a completely arid market."
Physics,3bva1x,ElGatoPorfavor,2,Thu Jul 2 16:19:25 2015 UTC,"Not particularly good, IMO.   If you want to do academic research nuclear physics is a shrinking field. Faculty retirees are not being replaced, facilities have shut down. The national labs don't sweep up as many graduates as they once did. If you do go down this route the dark matter/neutrino route is probably the best bet.  A focus in radiation detection is a bit better and you can straddle physics and nuclear engineering.

PhD physicists are also highly valued in quantitative finance, although a strong maths and programming background is crucial here.   Management consulting is another option where PhDs are valued.

Yes, doing Physics requires Math, yes it is important to have an understanding of this math, but taking an Abstract Algebra course in the Math Department will not help you do Physics, nor will Real Analysis, or anything of that nature. It will however give you more of a mathematical insight into how the math works.  But most importantly most colleges offer a course called Mathematical Methods for Scientists and Engineers, in it, it will usually cover what you need from a plethora of different mathematical topics, while excluding things that are pretty irrelevant.  While you can certainly gain from doing a math + physics degree, it won't set you back, and unless you have a true calling for math you will get bogged down by the meticulous nature of proof-based math courses."

You'll be responsible for fixing any deficit in your knowledge come graduate school.    Edit: The degree itself is unnecessary.

It just won't nearly as important as the PGRE, and in particular given that you're an American, you'll probably be able to get a fairly decent score provided you do a bit (ie a week's worth) of practice and get a good night's sleep beforehand. Best of luck!!"

The quantitative part should be a piece of cake for anyone who has been actively thinking during the physics and maths classes. The verbal part is mostly just more pattern recognition (but easier if you read enough to get more context for recognizing the pattern). The writing part is.. well, just gotta hope for a topic you actually give a shit about."
Physics,3bva1x,confetti_party,3,Fri Jul 3 23:45:15 2015 UTC,"Hello.  So, I'm the equivalent of a junior going into this fall semester. I'm on track to complete an EE degree in two years. However, I am in a linear systems and circuits class over this summer, and I've realized that I don't like EE as much as I thought I would. I've spoken to a few recent EE grads who are working as engineers in consulting and power engineering, and after interviewing them, I didn't feel any more excited about the field. I also know that I'm not into the competition of most other industry. I'm also not much of a tinkerer (though I still do enjoy hands-on stuff when it comes down to it, I just don't seek it out in my free time). I'm more of an idealist who'd rather read about physics or describe the behavior of quantum interactions via mathematical models.  That being said, I can finish in the same time span in physics, and I'm strongly considering switching. I have an appointment next Tuesday with an advisor. I realize job prospects are not as kind to physics BS as they are to engineering BS, but I am interested in graduate school, too. I suppose that's the only major roadblock I still face, the idea that money would be tight if I sought after physics.  Has anyone else here faced a similar situation, or can you speak to mine? Thanks.  Oh, and I should add that, up to this point, my favorite undergraduate course was physics III/modern physics."
Physics,3bva1x,reddit409,5,Thu Jul 2 14:27:44 2015 UTC,"Many topics in applied physics and photonics exist at the boundary of physics and EE, so much so that photonics research is usually in the EE department of a university of there is no separate photonics department.

Also for reference, my undergrad research was in quantum optics and my PhD is in nanophotonics, specifically quantum information/quantum communication.  From reading what you like, my best advice for you is to try and get some research experience; classes are great at figuring out what interests you, but at the end of the day they're really nothing like actually working in the field. Try to find a lab that will let you work on a small project or work alongside a graduate student so you can get a taste for what it would actually be like going to graduate school in that area, or what it would be like doing industry research in that field."

Again, I'm not at an extreme with any of this, which is why I am having a hard time with this. I also reeeally don't like digital logic."
Physics,3bva1x,reddit409,3,Thu Jul 2 23:17:51 2015 UTC,"I'm only asking because I felt a similar way towards the start of my degree.  I completely agree, an EE degree can seem daunting when you're only doing the basics. I only do the electronics side of things, I completely avoid the electrical (high power) side of things.  Currently in my final year, and I now love it. I'm pretty focussed in instrumentation and high speed data acquisition systems. I plan on going into a PhD late 2016. Running along side science experiments and providing reliable and accurate data from the instruments is a pretty satisfying task. It's tough, and requires a lot a thinking about, but I find it really exciting  It gets much more rewarding the more advanced you are. My point being here is that it's still early days for you so its tough go judge.   If you want to go into research, an EE degree won't hold you back. If you're looking into spintronics or photonics, then I would say an EE degree is more beneficial than a physics degree."

It depends on the cost of living in the region where you attend. But you usually can get a combination of research/teaching stipends to support you.  Nobody gets rich off of grad school though, and some people have to take out loans.  It is also very dependent on your personal costs (single/married, kids, have to live alone, live with roommates, like to eat, ...)."

Some schools offer unfunded PhD programs, but they are really not a good option. (At least in my country, those are seen as less rigorous than the funded programmes and to some extent like paying for your degree).  Generally, money for funding PhD candidates comes from three sources: the schools and institutions you'd be attending, your government (or someone else s' government), and industry. If you are a student studying domestically, your school is most likely to provide the funding for your program. If you are studying abroad, it is most likely that your government is footing the bill (through programmes such as 'Fulbright'). Industry funding is usually reserved for programmes focused on research with (almost) immediate industry applications (so, almost engineering or directly engineering). (This isn't the same in all countries, though. In México, for example, (where I'm from), the government keeps a list of all the graduate programmes they like, from all institutions and schools. If you are attending any of those, the government will pay you no matter what. This includes national and international programmes.).  If you are interested in pursuing a PhD, you should really read a lot on the admissions and financial aid pages of the schools you are interested. You'll see there what funding options are available."

The physic book you use will most likely have an introduction section about vectors, the dot product, and the cross product. These are good to get a jump on as well.

If you can finish and redo it to check your work, even better.  P.S. I found 'early' physics (high school AP / freshman college) a lot harder than high end stuff. It's 'easy' but it's harder to learn because you aren't used to it yet. And sometimes it really does get easier--I find lagrangian mechanics a lot easier to work with than f=ma but you need a certain critical mass of math and physics intuition to start using it."

Physics,3bxxcv,Auphyr,5,Fri Jul 3 08:45:40 2015 UTC,"Croquet is played with 4 balls, if you only have 3 you might as well leave another one behind.    Edit: Ok, I have a solution.  We could just fall slowly while crossing.  Consider the system consisting of us, the mallet, and the three balls.  Now think about the center of mass of that system.  According to Newton's 2nd law the acceleration of that center of mass is equal to the sum of external forces (because internal forces all cancel by his 3rd law).  So we have:  N-Mg=Ma  (where N is the normal force of the bridge, M is the total mass of the system and a is the acceleration of the system's CoM)  -> N=M(a+g) <= 185 lbs (weight limit of the bridge)  The total weight is Mg = 186 lbs, so M= 186 lbs/g   ->   (a+g) <= (185/186)g  ->  a <= -1/186 g  If we cross the bridge at a constant speed, v_x, then we travel L=v_x*T in time T.  If we start with our CoM elevated and at rest (let's say, juggling at the edge of the bridge) then start to cross, while letting our CoM slowly descend, we fall a distance h=(1/2)a*T2 in time T.  Solving our horizontal distance equation for T, and substituting it into the falling equation we have:  h=(1/2)a*(L/v_x)2  -> h <= (1/2)(-g/186)(L/v_x)2  (because a<=-g/186)  Then h <= (-1/372)g*(L/v_x)2.  Let's plug in some reasonable numbers.  If we cross a 10 m long bridge at 3 m/s then we must let our CoM go down by at least ~29 cm.  Not too bad!    However, because this is proportional to L2 we very quickly lose height as the length of the bridge increases.  Once the bridge is at 50 m we must let our CoM descend by at least ~7.3 m if we walk, again, at 3 m/s."
Physics,3bxxcv,Auphyr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:49:29 2015 UTC,"So you're saying if we start juggling before stepping onto the bridge, we can get one ball in the air without transferring its weight downward onto the bridge (it transfers down onto the pavement before the bridge), and thus have that 2 pounds disconnected from the bridge; but that the continuous act of juggling while moving across the bridge will slowly recover that mass and apply ever-increasing force to the bridge, until it's equal to the at-rest mass of the juggler and three balls?"
Physics,3bxxcv,paholg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:54:45 2015 UTC,"Any force less than what I suggested would just lead to our center of mass falling even faster.  My solution assumes that we let the center of mass accelerate downwards at a constant rate, such that the normal force from the bridge can be exactly enough, at its maximum, to support our much lower than g acceleration downwards.  This works as long as we have space to let the center-of-mass continue to fall.  Consider the tension in a rope as you hold an object up with it.  If you let the object accelerate downwards at g, then there is no tension.  If you let the object accelerate downwards at less than g than you are providing a tension that is less than mg"
Physics,3bxxcv,Auphyr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:56:18 2015 UTC,"It would be quite difficult to lower your CoM by 29 cm by juggling, since the vast majority of the mass in the system is you.  I suppose you could just gradually bend over while you walk, or get some stilts that can decrease in height while you walk.  In any case, I think you've got the only actual solution, and it depends on details not supplied in the problem."

Physics,3bxxcv,IntoTheNucleus,5,Fri Jul 3 04:14:41 2015 UTC,"That doesn't actually work.  Let's look at the optimal situation: You're juggling so that two balls are in the air at any given time.  This means that for any ball, you will be holding it for 1/3 of the time, and during that time you need to accelerate it enough that it will spend the other 2/3 of the time in the air.  By symmetry, we can look at just half of that. During the time t0, you are accelerating the ball from rest to speed v1, and during the time t1, the ball is in the air and decelerates to rest.  Then, we will have time t2 = t1 where the ball accelerates back to v1 and time t3 = t0 where you decelerate the ball to a stop and the cycle repeats.  Because of the weight limit of the bridge, the most a ball can weigh at any time is 5 lbs, which is 2.5 times its initial weight. This means that the most we can accelerate it at is 1.5g.  In time t0, the ball accelerates to v1, so v1 = 1.5g * t0.  In time t1, the ball decelerates to rest, so  0 = 1.5g * t0 - g * t1  t1 = 1.5 t0  However, we need t1 to be double t0, as the ball needs to spend 2/3 its time in the air. So, we must accelerate the balls at a higher rate than 1.5g to juggle them, causing us to excede the weight limit of the bridge."
Physics,3bxxcv,paholg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:11:58 2015 UTC,"Let's say we hold one ball (in our pants) and have the other two in either hand. Then we throw them up and catch them with the same hands so that when one is being thrown the other is in the air.  Assuming our human is error free and catches/throws the balls perfectly, then as long as we stay within a certain height (or applied force upwards) then it should be possible.  note: we would have to walk on the bridge with one ball already in the air."
Physics,3bxxcv,IntoTheNucleus,3,Fri Jul 3 02:50:58 2015 UTC,"Then each ball has to be in the air half the time, but we have a smaller weight limit on the balls; they can only weigh 3 lbs, so we can only throw them up with 0.5g.  If we're throwing them up with 0.5g and they're falling at 1g, there's no way they can be in the air half the time.  Edit: there is no way that throwing balls up, so long as you have to catch them at some point, will ever decrease your maximum weight. It can decrease your minimum weight, but to do that it will increase your maximum."
Physics,3bxxcv,paholg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:00:18 2015 UTC,"Of course if I throw the ball up I increase my weight by the same force I apply on the ball. However if I start the first throw while I'm not on the bridge then I'm walking on to it with 2 balls (183 pounds). I then proceed to throw my next ball up which is 2 pounds...and I would require a force stronger then 2 pounds to throw it up thus surpassing the 185 pound limit. Okay, you got me.  EDIT: Deleted other scenario, my mistake."
Physics,3bxxcv,Auphyr,3,Fri Jul 3 03:04:16 2015 UTC,"If you walk onto the bridge with a ball in your pants and the mallet, you weigh 182 lbs not 181 lbs, so you still go up to 186 lbs.  Also, if you're throwing the balls so they apply 4 lbs of force to your hand, then you're accelerating them at 1g, and so they'll spend exactly half their time in the air, which means there are no weight spikes. There will always be one ball in the air and always one ball that you're accelerating; you catch the second one the moment you let the first one go.  If the weight limit of the bridge were a tiny bit below 186 lbs (rather than 185), then juggling like this may save you due to wind resistance slowing the falling balls, but you better be damned perfect at it."

Physics,3bxxcv,paholg,2,Fri Jul 3 06:01:35 2015 UTC,That changes nothing. There is no amount of throwing stuff up and catching it that can help reduce your minimum weight.  The best case scenario is that it stays the same.
Physics,3bxxcv,7even6ix2wo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:11:30 2015 UTC,"What if you start juggling before you step onto the bridge, so that you transfer the weight of two balls to the pavement, and are, essentially, repeatedly catching and throwing one ball into the air?  You step onto the bridge with one ball in hand; you throw that ball upward, and catch one ball.  One would assume the bridge is stiff enough that it doesn't take as long to return to rest as the ball takes to fall:  the bridge doesn't take a full 1 second to flex and return to rest if the ball leaves your hand and falls back into your grasp over the course of one second.  The bridge is, thus, fully unloaded in less time than it takes for a ball to return to your hand; if this is 1/10 the time, you can theoretically juggle 10 balls, so long as you're only ever holding one and you space out the juggling evenly.  This is all a discussion of thrust, same as if we say the kickback from an AK-47 can lift you into orbit if you can fire a thousand bullets per second (rapid-fire AK-47 jump!)."

Physics,3bxxcv,SingleMonad,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:57:44 2015 UTC,"If a ball spends only one-third of its time in the air, then there will always be two balls in your hands.

If you accelerate them at (1/4)g, but they return at 1g, they will not spend 1/3 of their time in the air."
Physics,3bxxcv,paholg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:01:14 2015 UTC,"idk... the normal force exterted by the bridge will spike in conjunction with the impulse imparted by the hand when it catches a down-coming ball.  If the ball is landing at more than ~1.5m/s (while there is a stationary ball in the other hand) the bridge will collapse.  Two pounds is about 1kg so with gravity at 10m/s2, he could only throw the balls up about 11cm or the bridge will collapse.  Seems unlikely given the croquet balls are a few centimeters themselves."

Physics,3bxxcv,Auphyr,2,Fri Jul 3 03:02:35 2015 UTC,"Juggling may work with a decreasing center of mass, like /u/Auphyr proposed, but standard juggling certainly does not.  The best case scenario for juggling (assuming that the balls aren't going to decreasing heights) is that you maintain your non-juggling weight, with anything worse than that resulting in you sometimes being lighter, but sometimes being heavier."
Physics,3bxxcv,thoughtso,2,Fri Jul 3 04:28:32 2015 UTC,"Huh.  What did do wrong?  Let me talk through this and maybe you'll see my error.   The force I apply when I catch and launch a ball is F = m (2 v0 / t) (EDIT: + mg, changes everything), where the quantity in parens is the constant acceleration I apply to reverse the ball during the handling-time t. The air-time T = 2 v0 / g, is the time it takes for one ball to leave my hand, go up, and fall back to my hand. In order to keep t the largest (and hence F the smallest), t should be as long as possible.  So that's t = T / (N-1), where N is the number of balls.  I arrive at this relation by demanding that while 1 ball is in my hand, the remaining N-1 are in the air, equally spaced in time.   Then I solve my three relations to get that F = m g (N-1).  The force I apply to the ball in my hand is same as the force it applies to me.  So the apparent weight of the ball is W * (N-1), or in this case, 4 lbs.  I feel very stupid now.  My only excuse is that it's waaaay past my bedtime.  If you can spot my error, it would be nice to wake up to it tomorrow.  Cheers.  (EDIT:  Damn you gravity, you win again!)"

It's nonsense to say that because light exhibits duality that it must therefore have mass.  Gravity doesn't ""vary speeds,"" whatever that means. Changes in gravitational potentials can be related to changes in kinetic energies, but that doesn't imply that something must vary its speed. Light can have different energies at the same velocity by having a different frequency or wavelength.  tl;dr Shut off."

You might like some of his ideas.  One potential ""risk"" that needs to be taken into account is that doing research at up to graduate or even postdoc level is a learning process, and that learning process will necessarily have to include long periods in which you are stuck and try and learn how to get yourself unstuck. If you simply posted every problem you face online for someone else to solve, you might miss out on that part which would overall lead to a reduction in quality of research. If that would be offset by problems getting solved fast overall, who knows."

I strongly believe that in this case, the edit history (that the platform should have) will provide the means of gauging contributions to the discovery. In some cases, there may be too many contributors to decisively name an author. Nevertheless, does this 'ownership' really matter in the grand scheme of scientific progress?  Other: I'm sure this isn't an original thought. I'm also convinced that this idea has the propensity to bring about substantial change in the way academic progress is achieved.

I would guess that 99% of all published research doesn't actually constitute real progress on anything relevant and important.   So it's not really about making those results happen at an even faster pace, it's rather about slowing down, about shifting focus to the actually relevant big questions of our time. If that happened I would warmly welcome a more collaborative style of research."

I don't agree with this statement either (besides the fact that you're already wrong, a paper a decade that solves THAT big of a problem is a ridiculously optimistic frequency). Mathematicians work on things because they're interesting. These things can often end up becoming tools to solve problems that are of more interest to society, but without the mathematicians playing around in the first place, you wouldn't have these tools sitting and waiting to be taken. In the same way, we shouldn't swarm over some big question that you think is important (because this is what it boils down to.. the funding environment is not conducive to research that doesn't have some underlying theme or big question)."
Physics,3bpi7j,FormerlyTurnipHugger,-1,Thu Jul 2 05:20:57 2015 UTC,"besides the fact that you're already wrong   Based on what? I base my observation on my experience as a professional academic who's been publishing for more than ten years.   Mathematicians   We're talking about physics though. I don't know about the maths publishing space but I can assure you that the publishing frequency is far, far lower than in physics. Maths actually comes closer to what I'm arguing for: people sit down for years working on a problem, and then often end up publishing hundreds of pages long proofs that other mathematicians have to study for a decade before they can decide whether its right or wrong.   the funding environment is not conducive to research that doesn't have some underlying theme or big question   Not true. The funding environment is set by national agenda which changes with politics. I'll give you an example from my field.   One of the currently en vogue things in politics worldwide is national security. So instead of writing funding grants for answering the big questions such as quantum gravity, we need to write funding grants which promise secure quantum communication. No big question, just a promise of more secrecy which then gets immediately undermined by the very same governments demanding backdoors into those supposedly secure networks.  Foundational research funding has always been very scarce, and its getting scarcer these days."

We're talking about physics though.    And then we have people working on toy models of things that they find interesting. Is that so wrong? Some guy looks at Bessel functions for why coffee spills so often, another guy is interested in analyzing the crinkling of chip bags and reconstructing sound from it, and so on. Why does everyone have to work on quantum gravity? I can't think of anything worse than everyone working on the same topic because laypeople think it's interesting.

You don't seem to be. What I was saying was that 99% of all research results doesn't constitute progress.   The ten-year example was merely an idealized version of what I would like to happen instead. If you say that that's not reality, and real progress takes much longer then yes, I fully agree: of course it does, because people are wasting their time with useless research instead of tackling the relevant questions.   Is that so wrong?   What's right and wrong? I don't judge that. But it's irrelevant to true scientific progress.   Why does everyone have to work on quantum gravity?   Oh, there are of course other big questions too. Unfortunately there are far more people looking into your chip bag crinkles than in the big questions, or even just small steps that will eventually lead to progress on big questions.  One reason for this, btw., is that there is very little control over what research is being done by individual academics. Everyone just does whatever the F they want.    I can't think of anything worse than everyone working on the same topic because laypeople   I'm not a layperson.   An underlying theme or big question. Just not the one that YOU think is important.   I yet have to find an academic who thinks that national research agenda is important to progress in science except in very rare circumstances such as the occasional EU framework program.   Sorry, seems like you're making excuses for why you are doing what you are doing   I'm in that field, but that's not what I'm doing. That's where the money is, but it doesn't answer any questions. So I work in foundations instead.  Also, it was merely a single example of how research funding isn't lined up with big questions. There is so many more. I don't know how may grant applications you've written, but I've done a good two dozen across 3 continents. There are all kinds of criteria that you have to try and match your applications to, and hardly any of them deal with scientific progress and discovery. It's all about applications, technology transfer, how will your research benefit society within its 2 year lifetime, yadda yadda."

These are the ones that people had vague feelings but didn't have all the right technical details.  Some examples:  In the 80s before Chern-Simons and Jones polynomial, there were notes by Jones being passed around. In the path integral for quantum mechanics, there was the comment in Dirac's 1932 note 16 years before, but Ito-Doblin calculus didn't come around until the early 40's. Langlands letters to Weil in 67.  There is low hanging fruit which you could measure by how many calculations you had to do yourself vs how many you could pull from citations. Sometimes what you think is brilliance is the fact that you were comparing to an old picture of the tree and you see someone grab a high up fruit when really that picture was so old that by now that fruit was significantly lower."

Doesn't the LHC already exceed all known natural temperatures?  I don't think hindsight has anything to do with it. Some phenomena are more useful than others. I'm skeptical that we haven't found all of the low hanging fruit. I'm skeptical that reaching the higher fruit will ever be practical. I think people assume that we must be able to reach those fruit with ease because they do not understand the difference between the low and the high fruit.

Physics,3bkhnc,musubk,8,Tue Jun 30 17:32:25 2015 UTC,"You're right.  They do.  Most have a short-pass (in wavelength) filter right on top of the sensor, usually above the Bayer array.  No filter is perfect.  They're usually 90% or so.  So if you can block the visible light, and expose for a long time, you can capture an IR image.  But OP's description doesn't seem to match that (they say there was 1s of bright IR+VIS and 3s of IR).  So I'm not too sure what's going on in this image yet.  Edit:  Ah!  The rear-facing camera on my phone is IR-blind.  But my front-facing camera is not.  So, there you go.  At least on my iPhone, you can take IR pictures if you just eliminate the VIS part of the spectrum."

Most silicon CMOS sensors are sensitive there (800 nm or thereabouts) and you can test this quite easily by pointing your TV remote control at the camera (in live view). You should see a purple/violet light from the LED, which is likely a gallium-arsenide source.  With regards to the type of IR that light bulbs and other heat sources emit, you need a sensor that is sensitive to radiation in longer wavelengths, 10 microns (10 000 nm) and above."

Why does it have a cold ribbon shape going through it?"
Physics,3bkhnc,SingleMonad,2,Tue Jun 30 09:54:13 2015 UTC,That's what IR looks like to a camera   Most of the image is white because I started taking the picture just before the light shut shut off   Then the plain IR started coming in and made the pink light   The springy looking thing is actually the reflection of the filament off the back of the bulb and the actual filament is overpowered with IR and just looks like a bent rod   Edit for a tiny bit of clarification  And also look at other attempts http://imgur.com/QVgayr1  Also what is a cold ribbon?
Physics,3bkhnc,bgcamroux,3,Tue Jun 30 02:32:13 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make any sense to me. If you started the image before the light shut off, and the image is white, then it's already saturated. The camera can't pick up any IR because the photosites are already full. The filament isn't darker than the surroundings being lit by the filament, but if your image isn't inverted then that's what it shows.  edit: You must have applied a gradient to fade everything on the edges to white.

Inside this black box a measurement tool would measure (or not) photons going trough the slits ( spectating/causing interference ) however the results of this spectating would be only shown on monitor in above described ""black box"". Since no ""spectator would be able to see the result (and based on known experiments) the photon would retain its probability wave form and hit the wall creating wave pattern....Now here is the question : What if we have sensors on the wall that go out of ""black box"" and tell us the result of pattern on the wall.

Physics,3bml7x,conquerer7,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:49:34 2015 UTC,"There are several different interpretations of QM that give different answers.  First off, every sane interpretation agrees that having a conscious spectator isn't important -- what's important is interacting with a larger system, whether that's a human's eye or a detector.   According to Copenhagen, any interaction with a sufficiently large system will collapse the wavefunction, so there'd be no interference. It'd be irreversibly destroyed the second the detector saw it.  According to many-worlds, the wavefunction would still be in a superposition, but the detector itself would be part of the superposition, i.e. entangled with it. The result is that, in principle, you can ""unentangle"" the detector by having it ""forget"" the measurement result, and then you can observe an interference pattern. But if you just look at the detector, you won't see interference.  For similar things, look up 'quantum eraser' experiments."

For example, people are trying really hard to build quantum computers, which requires maintaining a complicated superposition. The computers don't suddenly start working the second everybody leaves the room!

The intensity of a light source is determined by the number of photons it gives off, and the properties of the E and B fields emerges from the interactions of the photons with fermions. To understand the specifics of the E and B fields emerging from the particle interactions you need to learn quantum field theory. With some pretty rudimentary QFT you can drive the coulomb potential from electrostatics by using certain approximations. With some more advanced calculations you can show how other familiar EM concepts arise from this setup.   This is no accident, the term in the lagrangian for quantum electrodynamics that describes photons is exactly the lagrangian at describes classical maxwell E&M. The differences between the theories arise from demanding certain commutation relations in the field operators.    Basically, the exchange of a photon between two particles can change their momenta. If you look at the exchange of many photons in certain limits, the bulk behaviour approaches that of two particles interacting via the classical maxwell field."

I have some c++ code from an adviser for a physics summer research project. The only language I have programmed in so far is python although after going through the c++ code I think I have a basic understanding of it now.  My question is related to some of the functions of gsl library in c++ and if something similar exists in python. The two functions are used in the code  are gsl_integration_qags which seems to an integration function that deals with functions which have discontinuities and singularities and also gsl_root_fsolver_brent which finds roots using the 'brent' method.  Does python have a similar library to gsl? Also I have just read about cython which seems to be something which integrates c++/c things into python could anyone explain how this works? Thanks

For more general purpose code and / or for numerical work where performance isn't as critical, Python's used quite a bit. Julia's used some, but I haven't seen it catch on too much yet.  Personally, I use Fortran for numerical work and Python for everything else (including prototyping numerical code).

Physics,3bjwy1,matheas57,3,Mon Jun 29 20:46:40 2015 UTC,"Another question is: can a wormhole be used to make a time-machine?   Sci-fi author Stephen Baxter (degrees in math and engineering) proposed in Timelike Infinity a rather interesting time-machine: one end was in orbit around Jupiter, the other end was opened nearby. Both are kept open with exotic-matter. One is attached to an automated starship while the other stays behind. The starship accelerates to nearly the speed of light (rather quickly, since there's no crew). The ship goes on a curved path so that, over about 500 light years, it circles back to the solar system and parks in a similar orbit around Jupiter. Due to relativistic time-dilation, from the perspective of the ship the trip was quite short, perhaps a few subjective years. From the perspective of the stationary wormhole, it remained there about 500 years. So the idea is that a starship at the Jupiter wormhole in ""the present"", knowing how long, subjectively, the other wormhole will take to get back to Jupiter could wait the appropriate amount of time, then go through the wormhole which is now in the future.  Would that work?"
Physics,3bjwy1,SyntheticGod8,6,Tue Jun 30 03:16:53 2015 UTC,An unavoidable consequence of a wormhole is that it's also a time machine. You might even consider this a decent justification that wormholes can never exist.

However just as important is the way the information riding the signal is encoded and processed and this itself is a vast domain that draws on information theory and mathematics among other disciplines."

Physics,3bitcg,zzuum,58,Mon Jun 29 16:04:06 2015 UTC,"This, like almost every article on holography, is very misleading. It has nothing to do with what most people think of as holograms, a somewhat stretched connection with actual optical holography, and there's no reason to call the original or the holographic dual ""more real"" than the other, so saying we're ""really holograms"" comes out of absolutely nowhere."
Physics,3bitcg,Snuggly_Person,-1,Mon Jun 29 17:15:59 2015 UTC,"I realize that, and it is somewhat hard to explain without mathematics. I think that is why most get confused with the use of optical holography, which, when used, effectively, is a good metaphor, but often laymen just think that this means everything is just a weird image in the universe."
Physics,3bitcg,Monomorphic,44,Mon Jun 29 17:54:07 2015 UTC,"Seriously, these 'the universe is a hologram' articles come out once a week. Not a huge coincidence."
Physics,3bitcg,eggoeater,13,Mon Jun 29 19:13:00 2015 UTC,"I've been familiar with this book for 20+ years.  It is AWFUL.  It is well written and convincing.  It's also wrong on pretty much every point it tries to make.  At one point the author tries to prove a point by talking about how a large amount of warm cooked spaghetti appeared out of literally no where and landed on his head while taking a nap on his couch. He seems obsessed with psychics and para-psychology in general.  I've never read a book from the science section that was filled with so much non-science garbage trying very hard to look like science.    Side note: I worked with Karl Pribram in college, albeit for a short while (2 semesters).  This book doesn't come close to what Karl was talking about."
Physics,3bitcg,rsmoling,18,Mon Jun 29 22:42:56 2015 UTC,"Haha, I see, the book by Talbot (first published in 1991!) has absolutely nothing to do with the ""Holographic Principle"" that the article is referring to. A quote from Amazon:  Author Talbot writes that "". . . there is evidence to suggest that our world and everything in it. . . are also only ghostly images, projections from a level of reality so beyond our own it is literally beyond both space and time."" Hence, the title of his book. Beginning with the work of physicist David Bohm and neurophysiologist Karl Pribram, both of whom independently arrived at holographic theories or models of the universe, Talbot explains in clear terms the theory and physics of holography and its application, both in science and in explanation of the paranormal and psychic. His theory of reality accommodates this latest thinking in physics as well as many unresolved mind-body questions. This well-written and fascinating study is recommended for science collections. - Hilary D. Burton, Lawrence Livermore National Lab., Livermore, Cal.  Which is to say, the book is pseudo-science."
Physics,3bitcg,eggoeater,3,Mon Jun 29 19:21:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. In fact, he just co-oped the idea of a holographic universe to justify his delusional beliefs in pseudo-science and other psychic garbage, which is what most of the book talks about."

Physics,3bitcg,MolokoPlusPlus,6,Mon Jun 29 18:28:32 2015 UTC,"There's a pretty smooth series of steps from folk physics (intuition) to quantum field theory or GR. Relativity and QM are weird, but in a pretty localized way (although maybe not if you really understand QM....)   The idea of objects being arranged in a three-dimensional space (or spacelike slice of spacetime) is present throughout, and I think it's at the heart of ""folk"" physics. It's a nice, intuitive, visceral notion -- you may not be able to picture what goes on in a proton, but three spheres arranged in a bigger sphere is a good caricature.  So any mathematical transformation that loses that structure (or hides it) tends to be really disorienting -- people don't really think of the result as the ""same"" universe, so if it's real, ""our"" world must be unreal.  Of course, you could just say ""momentum space is the true space! position space is just a convenient abstraction!"" which would be equally meaningless and equally disorienting :)"

The one thing I will say in psychonauts defense is that there is actually a lot of good ""how to deal with life"" knowledge there.

Physics,3bi8aq,Coach_Carl,3,Mon Jun 29 16:54:51 2015 UTC,lots of great fluid mechanics in a cup of tea or coffee. Add milk and you'll the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in action - the resulting turbulent mixing is much more efficient than if it were just diffusion. (I just found this website which shows some beautiful images/videos of mixing milk with coffee)  Then if you spill a drop of coffee you get the coffee-stain effect as it dries.
Physics,3bi8aq,rumnscurvy,3,Mon Jun 29 18:23:54 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough my undergrad fluid mechanics course had one question that required you to perform a small experiment with a tea mug. If you flick a tea mug, water waves will form at the surface, but the boundary constrains it to be, for a more or less circular cup, a Bessel function. The lower-order modes should decay the slowest (usually the case for Fourier decompositions), but as it happens J_0 decays faster than J_1, weirdly. Given that J_0 and J_1 look very different at the origin, it is fairly easy to convince yourself that this is actually the case.    I am sure there could be other interesting fluid dynamics-y type things to do. A discussion of the fixed point theorem for instance, one application thereof is that if you swirl the tea/coffee, one part of the surface neither rises nor falls, logically."

The effect is actually more pronounced at the base. The huge mass of mountains off to the side deflects a plumb-bob.   The effect was expected by surveyors. But at the time of first measuring, plate tectonics was not yet a theory. It was assumed that the crust had uniform base. The deflection was found but was different* than expected. This helped confirm a dynamic buoyant crust. Like icebergs, mountains float in the crust and have roots proportional to their height. The ""roots"" offset the expected deflection.  *I forget which way it changes from expectation. ""Old"" expectation only needed to estimate volume of mountains above some baseline. But the ""roots"" went much deeper. Yet the roots are less dense material than the mantle they float on...so you've got corrections on corrections etc...  See isostasy discovery...

It uses a different mathematical formalism, providing a more abstract understanding of the theory. Historically, it was an important reformulation of classical mechanics, which later contributed to the formulation of quantum mechanics.  Hamiltonian mechanics was first formulated by William Rowan Hamilton in 1833, starting from Lagrangian mechanics, a previous reformulation of classical mechanics introduced by Joseph Louis Lagrange in 1788.

Yes, very much since for example the hamiltonian operator is one of the first things you see in intro QM. You need concepts like the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to show the classical limit of QM. Just some things off the top of my head, there are really much more.   However the way Lagrangian and Hamitlonian formalisms are usually introduced is through saying that they are elegan mathematical constructions that seem to reproduce Newton's laws and so are as good to describe mechanics. Obviously this is not a requirement and you can skip Newtonian mechanics all together and start with Lagrangian and Hamiltonian but you'd have more trouble with intuition though.

Physics,3bk9z9,LokiWakes,2,Tue Jun 30 13:38:40 2015 UTC,Your link is real.  Harnessing wind power is real.  It is possible to extract wind energy from the environment by putting turbines on a car.  The issue is one of efficiency.  The issue with the turbines on the car is that cars are tuned for minimum drag.  To get any gains from wind (and here I mean air moving with respect to the ground) your turbines must be (virtually) 100% efficient.  That's (virtually) excluded by thermodynamics.
Physics,3bk9z9,CarbonRodOfPhysics,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:40:44 2015 UTC,"The machine in the video clearly produces enough power to offset drag at low speed and the turbine is not 100% efficient. At high headwind speed and low car speed the coupling of the car and a direct upwind system would produce energy.  The issue of moving wrt the ground vs the car is again not quite so straight forward. Weird things can be done with apparent wind. For example if you take a sailing boat and stick it on a river with downstream velocity V and a wind blowing downstream with velocity V the rate of progress possible downstream is less than if there was no tailwind as it would be possible to tack into the apparent headwind which there would be on a windless day.   At the very least the obvious quackery of it all has made people lose sight of the physics involved and post excessively flippant comments. In certain cases it is not breaking the laws of thermodynamics and it is manifestly not ""physically impossible for this thing to do better than a Ford C-Max without turbines"".  Yes in the sense the guy who came up with it thinks it will work it is bullshit but there is some greater subtlety to why than immediate application of conservation of energy or the laws thermodynamics.  I suspect I'm taking this far to seriously."
Physics,3bk9z9,Rbox,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:58:45 2015 UTC,"The machine in the video ...   The machine in the video is manifestly different from the one in OP's article.  The prop is huge.  The cockpit is low.  Everything is optimized for smooth aerodynamic flow.  The tests occur in a high-wind environment, and a top speed of 2x wind-speed is achieved.  The energy for the motion of the car comes entirely from the wind.   The issue of moving wrt the ground vs the car is again not quite so straight forward...   It is straight-forward.  I know what you're saying about gains from tacking into apparent wind on a river.  For OP's car, there is no equivalent to the river's current, and thus the apparent wind doesn't help.  To see this, assume the air is at rest wrt to the ground.  Then it should be clear that, the only source of energy is the car itself.  There is no other energy source in the problem.  [That's what's different about the case of the boat on the river.  There is additional energy in the moving water that can be harnessed by tacking.]  So back to the car:  any energy gained by the turbine came from whatever powers the car.  So anything less than 100% efficiency results in a net loss.  It's a classic 2nd law problem.  It is possible to use OP's car like the prop vehicle in your linked video.  If it only used energy generated from the turbines, then I'm sure it could stop and charge, move, charge, or even move slowly while charging, provide there was wind.  But the article says he's driving across country.  So at freeway speeds the losses due to air friction are sure to be unrecoverable.  Just look at the turbines."

Basically, you can approximate (almost) any periodic signal as an infinite sum of sine waves, each with frequencies that are harmonics of the periodic signals frequency. Here, the series is cut short to a finite number of terms, and we see how we can add up just a few terms to get a fairly good approximation of a square pulse.  As for the radius of the smaller circles, it's determined by the frequency content of the original signal. Every signal has a unique Fourier Series, so if we know the signal, we can determine ""how much"" of the signal is contained within one frequency of sine wave."

By summing harmonics up in the right way, you produce the original signal back!  If you're familiar at all with the way different waves sound (square vs sine), this brings some intuition to the whole thing. The reason no other wave sounds as pure as a sine wave is because any other periodic signal actually has a content consisting of multiple harmonics. When you hear a square wave, you're actually hearing all the different frequencies that go together to make it up. This makes the square wave sound so much more complex."

If you get an infinite amount of these, you can make the function exactly. You can also use the waves to get back the function.  This is actually roughly how JPEG image compression works. It uses a Fourier transform to change the image into sine waves (except it does it in small blocks and separately for each color) and then it cuts off some of the smaller sine waves because they don't affect the result as much. That's why you see JPEG artifacts when you zoom in on some images - they cut off too many of the small sine waves so you can start to see the discrepancy."

This happens when the original function (in the time domain) is periodic.  Also, when the original function is limited to a specific time period (like 0 to 10 s), it's assumed to be periodic in the analysis because it's more general and well-defined than looking for other periodicity.  The Fourier transform has a function defined to time infinity and frequency infinity, and both the time and frequency are continuously-variable real numbers.  Also, the same (or adapted from integration to summation) operation is used in each case, so it can be called Fourier analysis or applying a Fourier transform in either case."

This statement from the paper strikes me as odd:   one approach to answering these questions is String Theory (or, more generally, M-Theory), but string unification models have grown excessively in complexity while producing zero predictive progress. After several decades of extensive theoretical exploration leading nowhere, it is time to consider that the string program may have been a wrong turn. If we backtrack, imagining String Theory never happened, we can go in a new direction, building on the success of Grand Unified Theories and recent progress in Loop Quantum Gravity   ""Let's ignore the last 20 years of quantum gravity research because it's too complicated, dismiss it for not making experimental predictions, and then laud another theory that also has no experimental predictions, and work with that!"""

Physics,3bgo78,SofaKingWitty,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:43:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, your explanation makes sense. Should I take Jaynes' work seriously? Is there any general procedure to incorporate these flux variables into maximum entropy thermodynamics? I have access to online journals, so papers behind a paywall aren't an issue. I found some of Attard's papers on additional entropies, but these look like they aren't within the context of Jaynes' formalism."
Physics,3bgo78,Snuggly_Person,5,Mon Jun 29 04:46:25 2015 UTC,"Jaynes' use of probability is entirely based on the concept that probability distributions encode subjective knowledge, not objective frequencies that actually exist. Maximum entropy is just saying ""subject to the information that I know about the system, what probability distribution (i.e. subjective judgement of validity of various hypotheses) contains this knowledge while assuming as little as possible about the rest of the data?"" If the information you know about the system isn't enough to describe the system adequately then it won't spit out something accurate. If it's incorrect information, then it won't either. If you tried to describe a non-equilibrium system while only knowing a couple of average variables, your predictions will probably not be very accurate, but this shouldn't exactly be surprising. The maximum entropy principle + bayesian reasoning would be argued to be the best inference you could make if that was all you knew, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily a good inference if you had very little relevant prior information.  Jaynes would presumably argue that expecting otherwise is asking for a miracle. On the other hand, there's a general sentiment that statistical mechanics should be derivable from the underlying microscopic dynamics. I.e. that while Jaynes' position may be consistent and more broadly useful, in physics we do know the laws governing the source of the underlying data and we should be able to extract information like that if we had a powerful enough understanding of many-body physics. Jaynes (and I, honestly) would consider that to be an important but separate problem from the maximum entropy principle, since you could still apply MaxEnt to whatever information such a hypothetical procedure gave you. If there's some principle that's powerful enough to totally pin down the only rational distribution to assign on purely physical grounds, all the better. That MaxEnt gives you bad answers if you feed it an inaccurate description of a system is not really an argument against it; this is just a mathematical encoding of how the same thing would happen to any physicist who was only given this information and nothing else.  I would read Jaynes' and Bretthorst's major work: Probability Theory: the Logic of Science if you want to see where he's coming from."

The good thing about doing derivations is that if you get stuck it's easy to find hints online, unlike a problem in a text that may not have a solution manual.

Physics,3bg5wp,ruglahhh,2,Mon Jun 29 00:17:29 2015 UTC,"First up, know that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many students (and academics!) struggle with the fear of testing themselves and the worry that that they might come up short. In fact, there is a whole syndrome named after it, called Imposter Syndrome.  Typically, the student’s like this I've dealt with often feel overwhelmed by the problems set before them, and go into ‘panic mode’ and end up procrastinating and avoidance. But there’s a simple technique to overcome these worries:   Break up the problem. I know that sounds cliché, but instead of focusing on ‘getting the final answer’, concentrate on the next simple step. If it’s a worked problem, just write down the variables for a start. Simple small steps. Non scary, simple steps. Before you know it, the problem will be half done and you'll be amazed that the next simple step is actually the answer. When you encounter a step that is difficult, it’s only a little bit of work to go and find the equation, or the number, the lecture notes on that one small step.   This advice also holds in the lab. Many young PhD students come into a research lab and are so overwhelmed by the experiment they have to perform that they panic, and are overcome with self doubt. But if you break it down: “ok, I have to adjust that mirror” “Ok, now I need to put the detector on the bench”, before they know it, they're taking data.   In summary, don't panic and break up the problem. I've never met anyone with a passion for physics who couldn't progress because of their personality. Sure, we all have our foibles to overcome, but know there is never anything unchangeable about your work style, and that many around you will silently be going through the same issues.  Believe it or not, you may even find the challenging problems fun once you approach it in this more analytical style."

Its pretty common, some of my peers will spend days in the library just making notes and reading, but without actually solving any problems. Just force yourself to do them, no way round it, you need to if you really want to learn. The desire to understand needs to be greater than the fear of feeling stupid."

Physics,3bc674,InfinityFlat,12,Sat Jun 27 20:43:02 2015 UTC,"This seems pretty interesting and I'm reading through the PDF right now. I'll put my thoughts here Section I - Intro  Section II- Model  They start off by promoting the SU(3) group to an SU(4) group, and promoting the quarks to SU(4) as well. They then introduce a quadruplet Higgs to break the SU(4)xSU(2)xu(1) to SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) which returns the standard model.   After the symmetry breaking there are 15 operators from SU(4) that need to be considered, and the theory says that the first 8 stay massless and become the SM gluons, the next six (9-14) become three fields which mediate the interactions between the colored quarks and their uncolored partners, and then makes predictions about the 15th operator, which mixes with U(1) and produces a ""massless state corresponding to the SM hypercharge interaction"" (I believe that should be a photon analog?), and a massive state that they call Z' which couples to ""quarks, quark partners, and all leptons""  The mass of the Z' and mixing angle of the theory are both based on observation alone and not predicted by the thoery.  Section II B - quark partners  It's just a quick bit of math and talking showing that the Higgs shows up correctly and that the lightest quark partner field is stable, and the two heavier fields decay down to it.  Section II C - Higher Dimensional Operators  They're writing out a few of the most significant nonrenormalizable interactions in the theory.  There is one in dimension 5 which involves the SU(4) symmetry breaking Higgs which violate U(1) and Lepton number, leading to a fast decay of (the theories) dark matter particle ((this seems like a pretty big issue)) but they claim that imposing a Z_2 symmetry will fix this issue, and move on.  In dimension 6 there is a pair of operators that violate U(1) and 'conventional' Baryon Number, which are apparently much more difficult to forbid on the grounds of a discrete symmetry. This unavoidably leads to the decay of its dark matter. They claim that it will be justified later on with the dark matter's mass scale ~~GeV.  There is another one in dimension 7 which actually matters, and it mediates proton decay.  The above three also contain terms which characterize the scale where the new physics there operates, and justifies them with observations (again, not predicting anything)  The 6 dimensional term (for dark matter decay) is Lambda_6 > 5 x 1010  GeV, and the 7 dimensional one is given Lambda_7 > 1012 GeV.  Section III - Baryogenesis and Proton Decay   This section is not bad, they make acceptable assumptions and arrive at a prediction for CP violating baryogenesis with their 6 dimensional operators, and the mass of their dark matter particle by the observed ratio of matter density in the universe.  They also discuss a host of solutions to the problem of having their asymmetric dark matter be able to annihilate the symmetric componets away. They discuss quite a few solutions (which to be honest are pretty clever)  Section IV  LHC  I don't know how much commentary there will be about the LHC bit, but they discuss the annihilation cross sections of the Z' and end up determining a lower bound on its mass of 2 TeV, which means that their SU(4) breaking scale is > 3.1 TeV. I'm going to quote the article here ""The quark partners have somewhat more model-dependent signatures.  They typically decay through the (off-shell) colored gauge bosons into two quarks and the dark matter, and thus each one produces a signature typical of a gluino in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.""  TL;DR this is a pretty small change overall (SU(4) -> SU(3) isn't a huge change) that does a decent job of explaining DM and proton decay, but asserts new particles above the EW scale. all in all the theory doesn't make very many predictions, (similarly to how the SM doesn't) so it's not something to freak out about. There isn't anything BLATENTLY wrong (as far as I could tell, but someone whose got more experience will probably correct this), It's just another thing to watch for on the side during LHC2."

Physics,3bde1b,johnnymo1,2,Mon Jun 29 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"Nordstrom gravity was a pre-GR attempt at relativistic gravity, but it predicted that light wouldn't bend in a gravitational field. It also reduces to Newtonian gravity. There are plenty of variants of general relativity, actually. Most of them are not ""wrong"", because they contain general relativity in special cases, but no observable deviation from GR has been found that would suggest these.  There are proposals for modifying quantum mechanics with nonlinearity, or random jumps under various conditions, but consistency with experimental evidence rules them out. They should reduce to Newtonian mechanics properly, but they have a hard time dealing with macroscopic effects that still need a QM explanation (like superfluids, or electron wavefunctions in metals and semiconductors).  While I agree with the sentiment in general (that reducing to known theories is hard enough that the ability to do so should not be taken lightly), this only seems like such a strong criteria because you're learning the highlight reel. Everything that didn't work isn't in the curriculum.  On the other other hand, it's possible that GR+standard model might be stringent enough to cut away the possibilities far faster. Since we don't currently have an exact replica of the standard model + gravity at all, it's still entirely possible that current experimental data is enough to logically pin down a lot of extra structure to energies far higher than we could probe directly. There doesn't seem to be much flexibility to introduce arbitrary phenomena without lethally damaging a theory."

Loop quantum gravity has some adherents who would like to paint it as a better option, but most people don't take such claims seriously.  So why should theorists drop a promising theory to work on proposals which have not been made with no guarantee that they'll even be able to come up with anything useful in the end?

Physics,3bde1b,bechira,2,Sun Jun 28 16:53:06 2015 UTC,"I think you're looking at this incorrectly. If string theory ultimately isn't the final answer then that doesn't mean string theorists are wasting time. Concepts that can be proven mathematically (e.g. geometry relating to Calabi-Yau shapes) would still have scientific value even if string theory in general is a load of garbage (which it's not). If string theory is scrapped in the future, then that would be somewhat disappointing for string theorists, but almost all of their work would still have some role in whatever new theory comes out next."

Debate it all you want but clustering and high performance computing just works better on linux systems. It is easier to implement and far more powerful.   On the user side of things you have the programming issues that others have mentioned, plus you have the Gnu tool set which is far more powerful than any Gui based system I have ever seen. Windows just can't compete.   Really a huge part of it comes down to philosophy. Windows is meant for general computing in a graphical environment for the average user. It excels at that. Linux on the other hand is meant to be a tightly designed work horse which is excels at. Most scientists don't need graphical software or even want graphical software for much of what they do. The graphical system just takes resources and programming time that could be better spent doing other things."

Windows is a pretty unpleasant environment for pretty much every development environment that isn't Visual Studio.  Python kinda mostly works, but it took a long time to get there.  Haskell kinda mostly works, but it took a long time to get there.  GCC and LLVM kinda mostly work, but it took a long time to get there.  Git kinda mostly works, but it took a … you get the picture.  On the flip side, Linux is a developer's wet dream.  If there's one thing you can do REALLY fast on a Linux box, it's compile something and run it.  If there's another thing you can do REALLY fast on a Linux box, it's install whatever was missing without doing any damned research beyond the package manager: Do I need to apt-get install ghc or brew install ghc?   You probably know that before you sit down.  For example, a common thing you might do is write a Monte Carlo simulation.  I can, for example, sit down at any Linux box and bang out a quick Monte Carlo simulation to compute the area or volume of some weird non-integrable shape in a few minutes.  Most Windows boxes wouldn't have Visual Studio, Cygwin, Python or anything else remotely useful installed.  The other thing, which others have mentioned, is that big data and cluster computing is much easier on Linux boxes.  The tools are extremely mature and you get a lot of computational bang for your buck that way.  If you're doing particle physics you're probably going to write some code that runs on a cluster somewhere, and that cluster is going to be running Linux.  There are fields where Linux isn't as common.  These are largely labs where some proprietary and/or ancient software is the only way to communicate with some critical instrument.  LabView is a common sight in these settings.  Most of the companies that make these tools—those that are still in business—have been (painfully slowly) transitioning to building linux tools—such as National Instruments (LabView).  All that said, most physicists I've seen have Macs.  Some run Linux or dual-boot, but most just run OS X with VirtualBox/VMWare/Parallels for any cross-platform needs.  There are a few reasons for this, but basically you get most the perks of a Linux-like development environment with few of the downsides.  Then you get the Mac-specific benefits like stupid-fast PCIe SSDs, all-day battery life, MagSafe, etc.  As a side-note, I think most Physicists and Mathematicians are drawn to good typesetting and fonts.  I don't know if most of them consciously care about them, but bad mathematical typesetting is a horrendous eyesore.  On OS X or Linux you'll get good math typesetting one way or another.  On Windows… shudder…  it's bad.  There's nothing good about doing math in any form on a Windows box."
Physics,3bb3it,daelin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:36:39 2015 UTC,"Monte Carlo method:       Monte Carlo methods (or Monte Carlo experiments) are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other mathematical methods. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three distinct problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.  In physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are quite useful for simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures (see cellular Potts model, interacting particle systems, McKean-Vlasov processes, kinetic models of gases). Other examples include modeling phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs such as the calculation of risk in business and, in math, evaluation of multidimensional definite integrals with complicated boundary conditions. In application to space and oil exploration problems, Monte Carlo–based predictions of failure, cost overruns and schedule overruns are routinely better than human intuition or alternative ""soft"" methods.   In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By the law of large numbers, integrals described by the expected value of some random variable can be approximated by taking the empirical mean (a.k.a. the sample mean) of independent samples of the variable. When the probability distribution of the variable is too complex, we often use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. The central idea is to design a judicious Markov chain model with a prescribed stationary probability distribution. By the ergodic theorem, the stationary probability distribution is approximated by the empirical measures of the random states of the MCMC sampler.

Physics,3bb3it,bobby177,14,Sat Jun 27 15:19:52 2015 UTC,"Depends in what field you work. If you use commercial instruments then the software and computer is usually bought in a bundle and I have never seen another OS than Windows. All the Laptops we can borrow for presentations are running windows and if someone else wants to work on your presentations or posters you'd need to use Powerpoint. (Forget about exchanging documents between MSOffice and anything that complies with any standard, that shit will never ever work correctly. Latex documents can be ported easily, edited Acrobat-pdfs can't.) But that depends a bit on your group and colleagues. If your institute or university offers software like origin, mathematica, labview then I'd say you don't need any Linux skills. For programming there are many development environments that are fine. I'd like to use iPython notebook as a replacement for mathematica, but I couldn't install it on windows (couldn't install readline to be exact), so I have to work in an IDE, but it works. But you might end up in a group which depends on Linux, for a self programmed driver, or simulation software or something. And as far as I know, everybody gives you the opportunity to learn using the shell, but it would be a big advantage if you already knew it, or at least have seen it before. Ah yes and of course Linux is free (of charge) and you can tweak it to your liking, (if you can) and there is lots of software for it, free as well, usually ugly, if there is anything to see but the shell. On my private computer I do use a Linux distribution.    Let me add: In particle physics, like the drunken physicist said, it's common to use unix systems."

Supercomputers/clusters won't be using Windows server, either. Most of your software (with the exception of the big ones like Mathematica or LabVIEW, but those come also in unix variants) will be in form of open source code, that you should compile yourself, so that you can get most of your system resources.

Physics,3bb3it,daelin,3,Sat Jun 27 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"Compilers, libraries, development tools, a powerful programmable shell, and package management (Homebrew on OS X).  This is one of those things that's kinda hard to know where to start.  You can ascribe a lot of it to the network effect—most of the code you want runs easily on Linux and difficultly on Windows.  The reasons all that code is Linux-friendly instead of Windows friendly are many and varied and variable.  For example, you know GitHub?  If you're using Linux or OS X you can probably use 95% of the code on GitHub immediately.  If you're using Windows you can probably use 75% of it with a lot of struggle; more like 40% if you know what you're doing but don't want to work too hard; maybe 10% if you don't know what you're doing.  Now, how about why?  If you want to develop for Windows you historically need to shell out for Visual Studio.  Visual Studio is expensive, it's complicated, you're stuck with whatever features Microsoft provides, and you're mostly limited to Microsoft languages and Microsoft environments.  These days you have other some good alternatives, but they're a bit of work and they don't always interface well with the rest of the world.  If you want to develop for Linux you can grab any compiler for any language you want for free.  You can develop with the most overblown IDE you want or the simplest text editor.  If you want your tool to work differently, you've got the source.  If you want to connect your tool to another tool, you've got the shell.  If you need a library to do something, you grab it and go.  If you write something interesting, you can share it with the world through relatively easy mechanisms (especially since GitHub et al)."

Visual Studio is very powerful and you can indeed to command line programming for more simple programs, it's just you have to go about installing third party tools (like Notepad++). It's a bit easier to start command line programming on Linux since you just have to download a few programs (Vim, Emacs, g++, gcc, etc...) and you can do it from the command line. With Windows, you have to do a little more research on how to do command line programming but it's CMD (Windows command line) has some nice tools for file searching, I/O."

That said, it is pretty much how I'd probably explain it to a relative that doesn't have the background to understand a more complete answer.  (1) Xcode is not usually used in physics because nobody cares about GUI programs most of the time, and they'd want cross-platform programs if they did, and (2) everything he says about the shell contains substantial wrongness.  A lot of the time in physics we care a lot about visualization, but we don't typically wrap visualizations up in neat little GUI programs.  We use matplotlib and write some PNGs, or we use CMSROOT and write some PNGs.  Most of the time there's no point and no time to go make some widget with configurable setting panels with automatic layouts and event-driven MVC blah blah blah.  We just want to understand the data and we don't need widgets to understand the data.  The rest of the time the code only needs to be written once.  As for shells, you don't typically use a shell because it ""allows for very quick editing of source code.""  You use a shell because you can run your programs with configurable parameters, pipe and redirect input and output, create detachable sessions sessions, log into and control remote machines, precisely control your version control system, copy and sync files, and basically control the world.

What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.  Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.  There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux."

Looks based on this paper. Might have some importance for the AMPS paradox.  I think Nathan Berkovitz's work figuring out the worldsheet origin of the pure spinor formalism is pretty important and noteworthy, although his talk seemed to pretty much just summarize the paper which has been out for a while.  Also, based on the title, I expect that lecture by Witten to be mostly identical to this one. It is a pretty sweet overview lecture if you haven't seen it. There's also a second talk by Witten about worldsheet/brane anomalies up there, in case you missed it.  A number of titles look promising. For one, I definitely want to see Dan Harlow's talk on bulk locality in AdS/CFT and error correcting codes when it becomes available."

I'll have a go:  information is encoded into certain frequency's. there's a gap between each band so you can tell them apart. Nonlinear interaction in fibres means that the different frequency's interact. if this happens too much then the information gets scrambled. This means that there is a limit to the length you can send a signal down a fibre before you have to remove the noise and re-send the signal.   To increase the distance you can send a signal without reducing the capicity of the fibre you can reduce the nonlinear propertys of the fibre or predict the nonlinear effect and adjust the signal so that what comes out is what you wanted.   The problem is that nonlinear effects are numerous and become massively complicated. What they have found is that the nonlinear effect is linked to a property (coherence) of the base signals which the information is encoded onto. Using a Frequency comb to generate the base signals so that they are more mutually coherent they are able to reduce the nonlinear effects and propagate the signal over a longer distance.   That last paragraph requires some more explanation but i cant see the paper where, I hope, they explain what exactly is going on."

The Wikipedia-article seems to explain it fairly well, at least qualitatively. It would be a good idea to mention your background, but since you didn't I'll have to assume you are not familiar with Lagrangian mechanics or general relativity. My advice to you is to not bother with this non-standard theory which no one uses. Your time is better spent learning an established theory (e.g. Lagrangian mechanics or GR). TeVeS is based on MOND which is an ""ad-hoc, empirically-motivated"" (and in my opinion, very inelegant) way to account for some of the phenomena that we currently use dark matter to explain. However, it doesn't quite work: From Wikipedia:   The most serious problem facing Milgrom's law is that it cannot completely eliminate the need for dark matter in all astrophysical systems: galaxy clusters show a residual mass discrepancy even when analysed using MOND.[2] The fact that some form of unseen mass must exist in these systems detracts from the elegance of MOND as a solution to the missing mass problem[...].   TeVeS is similar to MOND in that it attempts to account for the same unexplained (without dark matter) effects, but using heavier mathematical machinery. It seems to me to be more complicated than the already difficult general theory of relativity, as it features the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian and not one but two(!) extra terms, and requires you to introduce two new scalar fields and a vector field! It also has some important problems, since stars seem to be unstable in this theory.  TL;DR Don't learn TeVeS."

Physics,3b6x5l,eewallace,2,Fri Jun 26 21:48:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think the mask does any focusing.  At 3:45 into the video, Professor Merrifield says ""... by the time you get to the hard x-ray end and gamma ray end of things, nothing you can do will focus the light effectively ...

They must use some sort of deconvolution algorithm that processes the multiple copies of the overlaid/shifted mask shadows striking the sensor to determine the position of each source.  I imagine without the ability to focus, the telescope's resolution is limited by the sensor's pixel size and is not very high."

Physics,3b6x5l,im_not_afraid,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:53:14 2015 UTC,"The squares in the mask aren't really pixels as such. One way to think about them is as a bunch of small apertures. If you had a light source incident on a mask with a single pinhole in it and a screen behind it, you'd get a single image on the screen with a size and location determined by the size and location of the pinhole and the direction to the source. Add a bunch more identical pinholes to the mask, and you end up with a bunch of identical images on the screen, one for each pinhole. So the pattern of light on the screen is a convolution of the source distribution with the aperture pattern. Given the image on the screen and the known mask pattern, you can then reconstruct the source distribution. In this case, the lead bits on the mask are equivalent to the pinholes. The advantage, as I understand it, is that the angular resolution is determined by the size of the individual apertures, but the collecting area is proportional to the sum of the aperture areas. By contrast, in the single aperture case, a small aperture gives you better resolution but less collecting area, and increasing the aperture size increases the collecting area at the cost of worse resolution (assuming you're not doing any focusing).  So they're not simple pixels in the sense that each one represents some particular spatial region of the image. I haven't looked too deeply into the math, but I suspect that the situation is more similar to radio interferometry, where each pair of antennae measures a particular Fourier mode, and you reconstruct the image from the inverse Fourier transform. Not exactly the same, since in that case you're looking at the temporal correlation between antennae, rather than the spatial correlation, but similar in spirit. In any case, the effective ""focusing"" is done by the apertures, by just cutting out light outside a small region."

Both at rest and in equilibrium. If you disturb the ball on the hill...it simply rolls off, never to return. That's a ""run away"" solution. If you disturb the ball in the bowl..you have to push it slightly uphill and gravity pulls it back down.

Physics,3b6l87,beer_music,5,Sat Jun 27 05:57:40 2015 UTC,Systems strive towards equilibrium. This is one of the basic premises of entropy. Therefore a disturbed system will strive towards equilibrium in the form of a restorative force.
Physics,3b6l87,Craigellachie,2,Fri Jun 26 13:43:00 2015 UTC,"Well...it depends on how you look at it. For one thing, my example involves just a bowl and a ball and gravity. So you only need lots of bowls and balls and a very simple force like gravity. In that example gravity is not special...it's the shape of the bowl.  Your oscillations typically need momentum. That's what allows them to over-correct past the equilibrium point. So you could question why we have momentum and inertia. But that's a ""big"" question.  In my own experience my aha moment came when learning about solving differential equations. When you begin to see that either position or velocity creates a restorative force in your diff eq ...you know you'll get some kind of oscillation as long as there's not too much friction or energy loss. Even when you can't solve the diff eq you can still often see that it will oscillate or run away. (There's really only one more boring solution...exponential decay. When a system sluggishly falls back to equilibrium without oscillating. Think of car with good shocks...you push down on the hood and let go...it comes back to normal height without oscillating.)  So in that respect things get narrowed down. You don't have a lot of options. Run-away, oscillations and decay. Those encompass a huge number of mathematically described systems. And further it's bigger than physics, it's math. You can see it in opinions and economics. The ""pendulum swing"" between liberal and conservative values. Predator-prey curves. Lions eating gazelles results in waves dynamics in their populations.   edit: linked predator prey curves to wiki. It's a great example because it stems from the simple differential equations that describe it. For me, again, that's where I began to see why waves should occur in almost any kind of system you can mathematically describe."

Physics,3b6l87,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:21:53 2015 UTC,"Because if you put energy into something the energy wants to come back out.  If the system is symmetrical and frictionless, the energy will come out then be reabsorbed indefinitely.  Consider a pendulum.  If you raise the bob, you put some potential energy into it.  When you release it, the potential gets converted to kinetic.  At the bottom of the arc, the bob is moving at maximum speed and kinetic is at a minimum.  As the bob moves up the backside of the arc, it slows as the kinetic energy changes to potential again.  Eventually it stops as all the energy is now potential again.  It turns out that the ""simple"" version of these systems (where restoring force is proportional to potential energy) always solves as a sine curve."

Physics,3b6l87,Craigellachie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:13:31 2015 UTC,"Restoring force:       Restoring force, in a physics context, is a variable force that gives rise to an equilibrium in a physical system. If the system is perturbed away from the equilibrium, the restoring force will tend to bring the system back toward equilibrium. The restoring force is a function only of position of the mass or particle. It is always directed back toward the equilibrium position of the system. The restoring force is often referred to in simple harmonic motion.    An example is the action of a spring. An idealized spring exerts a force that is proportional to the amount of deformation of the spring from its equilibrium length, exerted in a direction to oppose the deformation. Pulling the spring to a greater length causes it to exert a force that brings the spring back toward its equilibrium length. The amount of force can be determined by multiplying the spring constant of the spring by the amount of stretch.  Another example is of a pendulum. When the pendulum is not swinging all the forces acting on the pendulum are in equilibrium. The force due to gravity and the mass of the object at the end of the pendulum is equal to the tension in the string holding that object up. When a pendulum is put in motion the place of equilibrium is at the bottom of the swing, the place where the pendulum rests. When the pendulum is at the top of its swing the force bringing the pendulum back down to this midpoint is gravity. As a result gravity can be seen as the restoring force in this case.

The result of such an exchange is an oscillation. If you think of the ball on a hill, you have the exchange between kinetic energy and potential energy, which are exchanged when the ball gains speed when it changes its height. Another example is light, where energy is exchanged between the magnetic field and the electric field which results in the oscillation. Really, any system than can be described by a ODE of a degree higher than 1 should have the possibility of oscillations."
Physics,3b6l87,SwansonHOPS,2,Fri Jun 26 17:21:06 2015 UTC,"This is a really good question and I don't think there is a correct answer to it.  Here is my very speculative answer. I have the feeling that waves are intimately connected to the concept of space and time. Waves are the way in which things in one location (in spacetime) can interact with things in another location, or the way in which things can change location. Assuming that instantaneous action at a distance does not exist in nature, one would think that every particle in the universe would be isolated from every other, so that in essence there would be no uni-verse (but rather a huge amount of independent entities). Waves provide a way in which phenomena can extend their influence through space. For example, electromagnetic waves arise when electric fields in one location generate magnetic fields in an infinitesimally adjacent location, and viceversa, generating a propagating wave that can travel great distances through space and time. The same is true about matter waves. In other words, what we classically think of as ""movement"" (change in position of a particle) is ultimately a wave-equation, in which the wave amplitude at one location is determined by the adjacent locations. Waves are the only way in which one location of the universe can affect other locations. Therefore, the concept of space and time would not make sense without them (in my view).  If you prefer to think it mathematically, waves arise from equations which include DERIVATIVES in space and time. Derivatives relate one location or instant (i.e. space-time coordinate) to its infinitesimally adjacent one (that is the definition of a derivative). Without space and time derivatives, all equations would yield total independence between all points in space-time unless you included instantaneous action-at-a-distance, which is philosophically unpleasant. Derivatives/waves are a way of ""cheating"" and allowing action at a distance (not instantaneous, requiring a propagation time) by allowing each point to affect the infinitesimally neighboring points."
Physics,3b6l87,ChadPUA,2,Fri Jun 26 20:46:21 2015 UTC,"Because of symmetry.  Reposting something I wrote a few weeks ago:  Fourier analysis can be thought of as being based on group representations in an area of math known as harmonic analysis. I only have a limited understanding of it but find it fascinating.  Normal fourier analysis is just the representations of a circle, ie. U(1). [Think of a line as being rolled up to get the circle.] The biggest hint imo that it's related to U(1) comes from the fact that the fourier series includes terms like e-iwt which are members of U(1). Since U(1) is commutative all its representations are 1 dimensional.  You can generalize to compact groups like SU(2) or SO(3), ie. spherical harmonics. In those cases the representations aren't all 1 dimensional, so the fourier coefficients are instead operators on the vector spaces of their respective representations. Since the function you're expanding is a scalar each term in the fourier series is now a trace of that operator times the representation matrix. The exponential terms in the U(1) case just correspond to the characters of each representation. Characters of representations are traces, but the generalization includes the trace of a pair of matrices (operator times rep) which in the U(1) case are 1x1, ie numbers so you can pull the operator out of the trace to get the character.  tl;dr Symmetry => harmonics"

Physics,3b7zc3,rantonels,4,Sat Jun 27 06:40:57 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how or why they should work; if I understand correctly (and it has taken me quite a while) you are simply applying a change of coordinate to a Minkowski diagram such that (t,x) (for a specific frame) are represented in the plane as (distance from O, perpendicular distance from the time axis). This means that constant-t curves are circles and constant x curves are lines parallel to the t axis.  I've deduced this from his derivation of the (t,x) coordinates in the A frame of the ""B"" event (the event right under the letter B in his drawings). Since he assigns to the B event the same A-time as the A event, the coordinates must be non-linear, and the constant-t curves are circles.  Now consider the boost to the B frame:  [; t' = \gamma t + \beta \gamma x \; \; x' = \beta \gamma t + \gamma x ;]  such a transformation cannot ever be a simple rotation, which would need [; t' = t ;], nor can it be rotation + dilation, which would need [; t' = \lambda t;] (since t is actually the radius). So B's constant-time curves are not circles, and the situation is far from being symmetric.  At the most intuitive level, it smells fishy to me because it very evidently breaks down when you add a third frame. First of all, you immediately get an angle greater than 90°, which he admits is bad. Also, you would have:  [; \phi_{AB} + \phi_{BC} = \phi_{AC} ;]  but this implies (taking sines)  [; \sin( \sin^{-1} v_{AB} + \sin^{-1} v_{BC} ) = v_{AB} \sqrt{1-v_{BC}^2} + v_{BC} \sqrt{1-v_{AB}^2} = v_{AC} ;]  in stark contrast with the velocity addition formula (written in rapidity terms):  [; \tanh( \tanh^{-1} v_{AB} +\tanh^{-1} v_{BC} ) = \frac{v_{AB}+v_{BC}}{1+v_{AB}v_{BC}} = v_{AC} ;]"
Physics,3b6t4u,explore_repeat,2,Fri Jun 26 13:02:15 2015 UTC,Hi /r/Physics! What are the best introductory texts for learning Lagrangian mechanics? Having taken both the first and second semester introductory physics courses I learned only your typical Newtonian mechanics. As a newer reddit user I continue to see references of the use of Lagrangians and Lagrangian mechanics and find it both interesting and seemingly necessary to understand them. What are your favorite texts that really taught you Lagrangian mechanics? I'm aware of Leonard Susskind's The Theoretical Minimum for classical mechanics and will most likely utilize these too. Thanks!
Physics,3b6t4u,Aeschylus_,4,Sun Jun 28 19:06:37 2015 UTC,"Morin's text is a good starting point.   There are others that people hear have used, but I can't personally recommend like Taylor.  On a more advanced level roughly in order of difficulty would be Landau's masterwork, Goldstein's tome, and on the most mathematically sophisticated level of any of the texts is V.I. Arnold's mathematical methods of Classical mechanics, which is probably beyond you at this point, but after mastering one of others might be worthwhile to look at if you still want to learn more about classical mechanics.   To sum it up I'd suggest grabbing Morin, or if you're feeling cheap use the complimentary chapters posted on his website straight from his book on Lagrangians and Hamiltonians. Then pick up either Landau or Goldstein if you want more. I prefer Landau, but it seems to me to mostly be a stylistic choice as to which people prefer. If after that you still want more, and are willing to go through some mathematical rigor Arnold is the book to use.   I'd like to emphasize that going through all these books won't happen quickly, for example the ten week introductory graduate classical mechanics course I took didn't even go through all of Landau, which is probably the shortest of these books. Start with Morin and enjoy the ride, classical mechanics is a beautiful thing."

Physics,3b2hdw,chuck2k,4,Thu Jun 25 13:02:11 2015 UTC,"I'm a second year undergrad.

With today's physics job market, should I stay as a physics major and continue on to at least grad school, or switch to mechanical engineering where I know I will have a guaranteed after-school career?"
Physics,3b2hdw,PM_ME_YOUR_TOKAMAK,3,Thu Jun 25 17:45:07 2015 UTC,"""Today's physics job market"" ensures that it is quite difficult to get a job as a physicist, i.e. someone doing high-level physics research, without at least a Master's in physics or some kind of physics-related field.  TL;DR: With the natural sciences and engineering becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, there are a number of different routes you could take to a high-level research position, but virtually all of them involve graduate school.  I did my undergrad at a US university whose (comparatively large; somewhat prestigious) engineering program was often described as ""design-based"".  Most graduates with an engineering degree either go to grad school in engineering, or work in engineering consulting firms, marketing, or software development.  Those I have spoken with who enter graduate programs often say they wish they had more physics in undergrad; this is especially true for grad programs in EE/ECE, Aero/Astro and Nuclear Engineering.  If you like quantum mechanics, take as many QM courses as your physics department offers, and try to get a job as an undergraduate research assistant with a professor you like.  Professors like to hire undergrads, because undergrads only cost $8-$12/hour and don't need benefits, etc.  Experimentalists typically hire a lot more undergrads (and grad students) than theorists do, since there's a lot more mundane work do be done tending to experiments than running simulations or crunching numbers.  If you're lucky, you might even get some design experience working in an experimental physics lab.  That said, you won't get a lot of ME experience taking QM courses and working in a QM lab, and vice versa.  Ideally you will figure out which one of those you prefer soon, but if your university has an ""engineering physics"" degree, I would go for that--it will be easier to apply to graduate programs in either engineering or physics that way.  Finally, a note about grad school right out of undergrad vs. working.  It's usually easier to apply to graduate programs, and take the GRE(s), during your final year of undergrad than any time later on.  However, if you manage to get a job or internship right out of undergrad, that's okay as well, as long as it's in the field you're thinking about pursuing in grad school."

Physics,3b60nr,rantonels,19,Fri Jun 26 10:32:24 2015 UTC,"Recognize the implications of this simple case: a quaternion squared can manage all possible cases of non-inertial reference frames. The third observer could be accelerating in an elevator, going on a Ferris Wheel, hanging out in a different location in a gravity field. All of these will cause the first term of the square to be different from the reference observer.   I don't recognize any implication. He just defined that thing he call time-times-space or whatever, then said some incomprehensible things without proof or any computations, then he derives this gem above that makes no sense and wherever it does, it's absolutely false.  Moreover, this ""invariant"" (which is evidently not invariant) is supposedly computed from an infinitesimal interval. Which interval? Is it between two specific events? What does it mean to have different observers compute it? How can the third observer, which is in general, as he explicitly says, distant from the events, compute said ""invariant""? An observer only has a local frame associated.   Here is my quaternion gravity proposal: the norm of the space-times-time terms of a quaternion squared is an invariant for all non-moving observers in a gravity field.   What the hell is a ""non-moving observer"" in a strong gravitational field? Everyone knows this is ill-defined. Also, again, confusing observers with coordinates.   We know this is approximately true for the Schwarzschild metric of general relativity, but not exactly. Gravity changes the measurements of time and space by factors of GM/c2R, but for one term the coefficient gets smaller (time) while the other coefficient gets larger (space). The product of those two has a squared GM/c2R term, small stuff.   no, I don't really know that to be approximately true, in fact I've never heard of this. He could afford some explicit calculations. Also he proceeds to talk about Schwarzschild r and t as ""space"" and ""time"".   Special relativity has no field equations to solve. Special relativity, as an algebraic constraint, applies to everything. Similar features are true for quaternion gravity. One implication is that there is no graviton. Because there is no graviton, there is no problem quantizing gravity. ""That was easy.""   Holy shit, this makes me rage. He has sneakily introduced a complete alternative to general relativity dubbed ""quaternion gravity"", which is a very serious claim. Of course, he has no intention of ever formalizing this new theory. But what's horrible is this ""as an algebraic constraint, applies to everything"". This is a profoundly unclear statement, let's give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he means that his theory has no propagating degrees of freedom and the geometry is uniquely determined by the content - i.e., there are no gravitational waves. Yes, the quantum version of such a theory would not have a graviton.  But it would still be quantum gravity, with all its nuances and difficulties that professionals have faced for decades. In fact, lower-dimensional GR is such a theory, having no propagating degrees of freedom; nevertheless the quantum theory is extremely rich and studied.   What function - and its inverse - should be involved to conserve space-times-time for a spherically symmetric, uncharged, non-rotating mass?   What does this sentence mean?   We know it must depend on that ratio, GM/c2 R.    Why?   We know it must go to unity as either the gravitational mass goes to zero or the distance gets very large.   Why and what is this?   Gravitational systems are harmonic.    What does that even mean. What the hell is this. What is an harmonic system. What is a gravitational system. What.   Go with the obvious guess: an exponential function of GM/c2R.   How is that obvious?  And then he proceeds to multiply the time component by that function and the space component by that function.  So we have some tangent vector, somewhere, in some locally Minkowski coordinates (because we want the first component of the square thing quaternion to be [;g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu ;] which is modified, in those coordinates, by an absolutely arbitrary transformation that depends on the mass of a black hole (the relation of the aforementioned vector with the black hole is a mystery) and on a radius [;R;] which frankly I don't know where it's from.  And he computes its original arbitrary quaternion square.   In the literature, the interval shown is the Rosen metric.   What literature? I've never heard of a metric with this exact name, and I cannot find anything on google. Also, that cannot be an interval, it's a quaternion. One number vs four numbers. Maybe he means one of those four? Maybe he is making it up as he goes?   It is consistent with weak field tests of gravity to first order Parameterized Post-Newtonian accuracy. At second order PPN accuracy, the two differ by only 6%. I am aware there are reports that confirm the Schwarzschild metric to 2.5 PPN, but I think those are tests of consistency since they depend so much on the model of the far away mass. A slightly different model leads to a slightly different prediction. I am not up-to-date on the current state for second order PPN tests. At least this is a testable hypothesis.  The Rosen bi-metric theory fails the energy loss by binary pulsar tests. The extra metric field provides a means to have a dipole mode of emission, and thus not consistent with observation. The quaternion gravity proposal looks like it could have a problem - no graviton means no energy loss by the field.   Ah ok, he is talking about Rosen bimetric gravity. Which is completely unrelated to what he wrote. And which is also, as he writes, unconsistent with experiment. But nooo, quaternion gravity (which was never defined, ever) is so different.   Remember, there is no field.   Yes, there is, as orbital decay of the binary pulsar by gravitational waves shows.   That does not mean there can be no energy loss. The function and its inverse do not have to be static. For a quickly rotating binary pulsar, there will be a time component.    Yeah of course, if you don't say what this ""function"" does, you can just claim anything.   The energy could be lost via photons whose lowest mode of emission reflects the symmetry of the situation - a wobbling water balloon - a quadrapole moment.   point 1) binary pulsars emit quadrupole gravitational waves because the rate of change of the mass dipole moment is zero by conservation of linear momentum. If the energy was emitted as photons, there wouldn't be such a restriction a priori. He needs to prove this explicitly.  2) we would measure the photons, we don't.  3) gravitational wave orbital decay has a very specific signature. Unless he can do better than this (and at the same time making sense), he's simply ignoring evidence.   The short answer is I don’t know.  Speculation follows.   What a fitting resume.  What he is proposing is an alternative theory of gravitation. Or better, he is congratulating himself for discovering and investigating a new theory of gravitation, but we aren't apparently worthy of being illuminated on any of the details. What he maybe has forgotten is that we have classified (there are theorems, and in fact the PPN expansion that he mentions refers precisely to that.) all the classical theories of gravitation compatible with the equivalence principle - which is for a good part experimentally verified. (First of all, they must be metric theories). His doesn't seem to show up in the list."

Physics,3b60nr,dsweetser,-5,Fri Jun 26 12:00:54 2015 UTC,"Hi, this is the ""well-known crackpot.""  Start at the top.   I don't recognize any implication.   I get that if you don't get this point, NOTHING follows logically. That is the way it goes.  Lets start with what we do know: special relativity. Things with special relativity involve those things that vary, and those things that are invariant. Imagine we have a lighthouse creating evens at a steady pace. The light signals are observed by two inertial observers. The two observers then compare what they got for the difference in time and the difference in space for the signals from the lighthouse. They are different because the two observers happen to be moving differently relative to the source of the signals. Then they calculate the square of time and subtract the square of the distance. That is called the Lorentz invariant interval.  For the two observers, the is exactly the same.  Measurements of time and space can vary for inertial observers, but the calculation of the interval is the same.  What sort of math machinery is used? Everyone gets trained to use a rank one tensor and the Minkowski metric tensor.  I happened to use quaternions. When squared, quaternions have as the first term the same thing as the contraction of two four vectors. It also has the rest of the quaternion product which I gave the label of space-times-time.  Now one observer puts on a jet pack and starts accelerating.  Either: 1. the accelerating observer keeps on measuring and calculating the interval and the interval is the same or 2. the accelerating observer keeps on measuring and calculating the interval and the interval is different.  If you believe 1, then you need to study special relativity some more. I always recommend ""Spacetime Physics"" by Taylor and Wheeler.  Non-inertial observers don't agree on intervals. It is the logical opposite of special relativity. It is easy to do with quaternions.  Can 5 people in different physical situations watch the same pair of events?  Of course you can.  Can any pair of people determine if they are moving relative to each other? Send signals back and forth, and if those signals don't change, then the pair of observers are not moving relative to each other. In a strong gravity field, if I a holding hands with someone, I can say that they are not moving relative to me.  Anyone familiar with the Schwarzschild metric in Schwarzschild coordinates would know it is written as   dtau2 = (1 - 2 GM/c2 R)dt2 - dR2/(1 - 2 GM/c2 R)  See how one is the inverse of the other? You might not have noticed it, but it is there. I did skip the explicit calculation. It is a little bit of uninteresting work with a Taylor series to show the inverse relationship is only approximate.  ""He has sneakily introduced a complete alternative to general relativity dubbed ""quaternion gravity""  Reddit is odd.  He quoted above:    Here is my quaternion gravity proposal: the norm of the space-times-time terms of a quaternion squared is an invariant for all non-moving observers in a gravity field.   Looks darn explicit, out-in-the-open as possible.  Yes, this is an open, direct question of what kind of accounting system we should use in physics. When Einstein asked Grossman, his friend said Riemannian geometry. This is a HUGE volume of historical support for that approach. But physics is stuck on integrating gravity with the rest of physics. I am proposing people consider a different accounting system. You will required to do thinking and reflecting on you own time with your own calculations."
Physics,3b60nr,Snuggly_Person,6,Fri Jun 26 14:12:07 2015 UTC,"What does ""non moving observer in a gravity field"" mean? Non-moving with respect to what?   Can any pair of people determine if they are moving relative to each other? Send signals back and forth, and if those signals don't change, then the pair of observers are not moving relative to each other. In a strong gravity field, if I a holding hands with someone, I can say that they are not moving relative to me.   In a special relativistic approximation, yes. This is only valid for an infinitesimal distance, and is not exactly true over any finite-sized domain, due to the lack of parallelism. Whether or not someone has the same velocity vector as you depends on how you slide your velocity over to theirs, and is not a well-formed question until you specify the path.   Non-inertial observers don't agree on intervals. It is the logical opposite of special relativity. It is easy to do with quaternions.   As in ""it is easy to show that this is true with quaternions""? It's easy to see how it's true with vectors as well; carrying a bunch of extra cross-terms around at best does not seem to be useful.   You will required to do thinking and reflecting on you own time with your own calculations.   ...? To understand an idea, yes I agree that time needs to be spent thinking about it. But that also applies to you; you don't get to skip out on explicit calculations just because you had the idea in the first place. The difficulty is not with the vague concept, it's with the idea that the vague concept actually works as a logical and explicit theory. This has not been demonstrated."
Physics,3b60nr,dsweetser,-3,Fri Jun 26 14:58:26 2015 UTC,"I had a very specific technical point in mind, but certainly did not word it well. I have added this footnote to the blog:   By non-moving observers I mean for a pair of observers, then is no constant-velocity transformation needed to go from one observer to the other. Recall the tests of general relativity where one clock was flown in a plane while the other stayed on the ground. To account for the changes seen, there were two effects: the speed of the plane and the different location in a gravitational field. What I am saying is these pair of observers have no plane or other form of motion between them to correct so it is all gravity. end footnote   This is easy to do in practice.  Set up one observer on one floor of a building, and the other a few stories higher.  Make them sit calmly in a chair with their measuring equipment.  That is all I mean."
Physics,3b60nr,Snuggly_Person,6,Fri Jun 26 17:13:58 2015 UTC,"But it's not true; if you parallel transport the velocity vector of one observer along a geodesic over to the other it will generically be slightly different due to the spacetime curvature between them, at the very least due to the gravity they exert on each other. The effect is very small, but it is there: in claiming that two velocities can be exactly and objectively aligned across distance you are making a non-gravitational approximation. Which is an excellent one here, but is not exact, and of course is only approximate precisely because you have specified a scenario in which general relativity does not substantially deviate from Newtonian gravity. If you can show how to perform such a procedure (i.e. mathematically calculate the results) across large distances in a regime where the corrections of GR are large then there might be a point here, but then again GR says this is impossible so you would have to contradict GR very drastically to claim something like this."
Physics,3b60nr,dsweetser,-2,Fri Jun 26 19:55:45 2015 UTC,"To my ear, it sounds like you are getting lost in the math and forgetting real world physics. Tests of general relativity have been done in different floors of buildings. They are very proud of this fact at Harvard University (I think it was the Jefferson building). Zero is zero is zero. The difference seen in the basement compared to the top of the elevator shaft is only and exclusively due to gravity.  I am trying to isolate the two from each other: Gravity effects happen when you climb the stairs of a building and sit down. Special relativity happens when you keep on walking away from a building."
Physics,3b60nr,rantonels,2,Sat Jun 27 04:11:52 2015 UTC,"I'll just debunk this one section of this wall of text, just to show you are not familiar with the standard theory.   Now one observer puts on a jet pack and starts accelerating. Either: 1. the accelerating observer keeps on measuring and calculating the interval and the interval is the same or 2. the accelerating observer keeps on measuring and calculating the interval and the interval is different. If you believe 1, then you need to study special relativity some more. I always recommend ""Spacetime Physics"" by Taylor and Wheeler.   It's actually 3) the accelerating observer cannot measure the interval if he does not pass close to the two infinitesimally spaced events. If he does, then he measures it to have the same value as the two other observers.  This is because the interval is defined intrinsically, geometrically, independent of coordinates.  Minkowski space, like any other spacetime, is a differential manifold [;M;]. It has a Lorentzian (pseudo-Riemannian) structure, i.e. a metric, embodied by a nonsingular inner product on the tangent space [; g_P : T_P(M) \times T_P(M) \rightarrow \mathbb{R} ;] depending smoothly on P. (Or, better, it's a section of the (0,2) tensor bundle on [;M;]). This is the spacetime interval. There is no explicit reference to specific expression in specific coordinates.  Now, if you have an infinitesimal interval (or tangent vector) [; v \in T_P(M) ;] at P you can define its invariant norm as [; g_P(v,v) \in \mathbb{R};], which is a Lorentz scalar, because it's an element of [;\mathbb{R};] not depending on coordinates. (Or: it's an element of a section of the scalar bundle. Or: it's built by contracting indices on tensors). Every observer will compute it to be the same value. If he doesn't, he's doing it wrong.  Your accelerating observer is in fact doing it wrong. The formula [; ds^2 = dt^2 - dx^2 = \eta_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu ;] only holds in a specific subset of coordinates for Minkowski space (and only existing in general for Minkowski space), that is inertial frames. Your accelerating observer will need to use the full formula [; g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu ;] including the coordinate expression of the metric tensor in his coordinates that he can unequivocally determine if he knows a bit of Riemannian geometry. This expression will not satisfy [; g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu} ;].  This is inertial forces in math language, by the way.   Non-inertial observers don't agree on intervals.    Yes they do, if they know how to compute them correctly, and provided it's actually possible for them to measure them.   It is the logical opposite of special relativity.    Really? I didn't know any acceleration brought me into the full general relativistic regime. That's neat.  Special relativity handles accelerating frames just fine, you just don't know how.   It is easy to do with quaternions.   You should try with normal geometry first, and learn to do it correctly."
Physics,3b60nr,dsweetser,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:48:58 2015 UTC,"Yes they do, if they know how to compute them correctly, and provided it's actually possible for them to measure them.   Let me see if I can restate this assertion (which does sound reasonable to me) for an person in a jet back doing loops far away from the observer. The metric tensor g_{\mu \nu} has 10 slots that can be filled either with constants of functions that can be varied in either space or time or both. There is also a connection that details how the metric tensor with ten slots to fill changes as one moves from the place where the events happened and the jet pack guy. Together, this combination when done correctly will produce the same interval as someone sitting next to the events and doing nothing.  That makes sense to me, I stand corrected.  When doing physics with quaternions, there is no metric. Without a metric, there is no connection. The crazy guy in the backpack only has his clocks and rulers. He can make measurements in space and time. He could report his interval. Without the tools of Riemannian geometry, he would report a different interval. Granted he would be told to do all the work of Riemannian geometry, but if he was lazy, he would just report what he saw and skip all the heavy math. I am dealing with the lazy guy."
Physics,3b60nr,rantonels,3,Fri Jun 26 15:57:34 2015 UTC,"If we work with non covariant observables, all hell breaks loose. The equations relating non covariant quantities cannot be extended from one coordinate system to another. Basically, it is on you the burden of rederiving the form of every physical equation in each coordinate system you're planning to use, each single time. No free switching to Schwarzschild coordinates or even jumping between spacetimes, you start from scratch every time.  Moreover, you plan on doing away with the metric. How did you deal with the well-known fact that the equivalence principle necessarily implies that the theory of gravitation is a metric theory?  You make a very strong claim, attempting to replace general relativity (which works really, really well, by the way) with an alternative theory. Have you detailed such theory and rederived explicitly at least each single one of the experimental predictions of GR which have been verified in the last 100 years, in a peer reviewed publication? Because if you didn't, I think I'm done here."
Physics,3b60nr,dsweetser,0,Fri Jun 26 19:40:12 2015 UTC,"The label I invented for myself is that I am the ultra-orthodox fringe. A fringe physicist is someone who tries to make a contribution to physics but does not have the credentials to do so. The ultra-orthodox encourage all the standard rules of physics be applied to reject a proposal (and I am careful to call it a proposal and not a theory, the highest achievement in science). A proposal is only worthy of public discussion if it is consistent with current tests. All work should be checked in a Mathematica notebook (catches math errors, but not conceptual ones). And I must be precise about what assumption in the standard approach to physics I am challenging. In this case, it is the practice of using Riemannian greometry. It may be possible - and beneficial - to use quaternions instead.  Let us be specific about what is meant by a metric theory of gravity (MTW, chapter 40 if I recall was the ones on the classical tests). One starts with a Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is varied with respect to a symmetric rank 2 metric. The calculus of variations is used to find an extremum which is the field equations. One then needs to solve the field equations to get a dynamic metric.  It is only the dynamic metric which is the subject of experimental tests of gravity. What exactly does that mean? Do a study in constrast: a static metric has constant coefficients. The Minkowski metric of flat space-time is diag{1, -1, -1, -1}.  What happens with the Einstein field equations is that for a very simple system - spherically symmetric, uncharge, non-rotating - Schwarzschild was able to reduce the number of equations from ten down to four, then find a solution to those equations which determined the metric whose coefficients now depend on GM/c2R. How you write that metric in detail still depends on choices one makes.  When it comes to comparing the theory to experiment, one writes the Schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates and takes a Taylor series expansion. One keeps 3 terms for the dt2 part, and 2 terms for dR2 (the details are in chapter 40 of Gravitation if you want to call my bluff). This is all for weak gravity field tests, which include light bending around the Sun, radar reflections off of planets, and the precession of the perihelion of Mercury.  And of course the entire green book by Clifford Will.  Part of the unshakable magic of a metric theory is that light - with no rest mass but does have equal parts energy and momentum - must bend.  I have a deep respect for GR. Really. I just learned about Einstein's struggles to find a field theory for gravity. He apparently did a contraction with the gradient of a metric, which he should have worked with the contraction of a gradient of a metric and two other derivatives of a metric, the three that make up the Christoffel symbols. There is a talk at the Perimeter Institute, worth the hour long listen.  So I don't have a metric. I also don't have 4-vectors which can be added, subtracted, multiplied by a scalar, but not multiplied or inverted necessarily. I don't have the Christoffel symbol or any other system for a connection.  Like Charlie Brown on Halloween, all I got is a rock.    What function - and its inverse - should be involved to conserve >> space-times-time for a spherically symmetric, uncharged, non->> rotating mass? What does this sentence mean?    Here is the square of a quaternion:  (1 dt, 1 dR/c)2 = (1 dt2 - 1 dR2, 2 dt dR)  Putting the 1's does no one any harm. I do it because the first term is exactly the same as the Minkowski metric for empty space-time.  Now generalize this situation.  Put in an arbitrary function f and an arbitrary 3-function g:  (f dt, g dR)2 = (f2 dt2 - g2 dR2, 2 f g dt dR)  Now you can play two types of games. One is to see what it takes to make the difference of the two squares equal in all situations. That is the domain of special relativity.  My quaternion gravity proposal asks what it takes to make |2 f g dt dR| invariant? One answer should be easy: if f is an inverse of |g|.  I said that gravitational systems are harmonic. By this I mean the Earth has gone around the Sun 4 billion times and counting. The apply falling from a tree is trying to oscillate around the center of the Earth can come back in an hour and a half.  Too bad there is a traffic jam of other particles in its place.  Gravity had depended on the ratio of M/R since Newton's time.  In the weak gravity limit, one needs the first term of the square to look like the result of contracting 2 4-vectors with the Minkowski metric.  These clues taken together say, at least to me, that for the quaternion gravity proposal:  f = e-GM/c2 R  g = eGM/c2 R  Plug those functions in:  (e-GM/c2 R dt, eGM/c2 R dR)2 =  (e-2 GM/c2 R dt2 - e2 GM/c2 R dR2, 2 dt dR)  The space-times-time term in invariant no matter how close or far away from M. If you take the Taylor series of the first term, it is consistent with the 5 terms that get tested in weak field tests.  This is why I still think the quaternion gravity proposal is consistent with all weak field tests.   Quaternion gravity will also do what I called the magic of a metric theory and apply to light. Special relativity applies to light. Quaternion gravity is a dual proposal to special relativity - meaning that for special relativity, the interval is invariant but the space-times-time varies in a way to preserve the invariance of the interval, while for quaternion gravity, the space-times-time is invariant while the interval changes in a way to preserve space-times-time invariance.

Physics,3b0uby,Jasper1984,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:43:28 2015 UTC,"There are several ways to construct compressors and stretchers. However, a typical Ti:sapphire-based chirped-pulse amplifier requires that the pulses are stretched to several hundred picoseconds, which means that the different wavelength components must experience about 10 cm difference in path length. The most practical way to achieve this is with grating-based stretchers and compressors. Stretchers and compressors are characterized by their dispersion. With negative dispersion, light with higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) takes less time to travel through the device than light with lower frequencies (longer wavelengths). With positive dispersion, it is the other way around. In a CPA, the dispersions of the stretcher and compressor should cancel out. Because of practical considerations, the stretcher is usually designed with positive dispersion and the compressor with negative dispersion.   Pretty sure the stretcher puts different frequencies at different path lengths, so that the pulse is stretched,(and across the pulse different frequencies) causing less peak amplitude, that the crystals can deal with. The compressor does it again, but oppositely to get all the frequencies arriving at the same time again.  Without knowing that different frequencies are moved back and forth to different time differences, the pulse stretching seems a bit mysterious.(though things are easier said than done, and diffraction grating.. edit: i mean the grating is a story on itself)"

So our  options are A) we can't see all the stuff that makes up a galaxy but that stuff exists so let's call it dark matter, B) Einstein was totally wrong and his theory is no good at understanding gravity on a macro scale so we need to modify gravity (this is the option that fits into your variable in an equation dilemma and we have no other good observations that would challenge our large scale understanding of gravity) or C) our observations are wrong, our telescopes are rubbish and shit just doesn't make sense. The evidence so far all points to there being ""something"" real that adds to the mass of galaxies and since we've ruled out brown dwarfs and rogue planets and dead stars and hidden black holes and a bunch of extra nuetrinos and it can't really be any of those so the dark matter theory now postulates that whatever it is it has to be something we not only haven't seen before but it's very nature must make it really hard to observe, thus the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle theory.

I guess it's more that it seems we tend to think of dark matter as this singular type of matter when I think it could be a number of different things, a complete hierarchy of existence we are currently unable to record or perhaps just a ""spooky action at a distance"" like change in the math caused by something we don't yet understand. Hell, maybe it's even weirder and the act of observation changes the math somehow... Of course, I'm qualified to understand the known and ponder but my wonderings are in no way educated guesses."

You've chosen objectively unsatisfying answers. They would be unsatisfying to biologists and poets and, gasp!, pure mathematicians.   Those kinds of people may make pretty good engineers, but will probably never contibute to discovery in research.   Ah, here's the rub, and why I think you're overstating the problem. Have you contributed to discovery in research? What makes you so uniquely qualified to dismiss the potential of your peers?  Obviously you're right that physics doesn't happen because of math, but it also doesn't happen because of fancy analogies to human-scale phenomena, which is the stock-in-trade of books like ""Fabric of the Cosmos"". I strongly disagree that such books are going to help students do anything other than pitch cosmology to funding agencies.  If we're worried about training people to make meaningful discoveries in physics, I'm of course worried about how their intuition develops. But that said, I see a lot more success from students with a healthy mix of analogy-crafting with the courage to follow the math where it leads, occasionally leaning on a term in the equation being no more than that. I'll bet on a guy or girl with pure math-based intuition over a Brian Greene reader to make new discoveries any time."

If physical concepts are just colourful stories we tell ourselves to help with our intuition, then I'd say mathematical concepts are just more precise, slightly less colourful stories we tell ourselves to flesh out our intuition.  Until we have a firm understanding of how our brains generate mathematical structures at the physical level (or, if you'd prefer, at the mathematical level), the whole Platonic ""math is reality"" sort of jive just seems to be a reinvention of Cartesian dualism -- and susceptible to all the same difficulties that led dualistic notions to fall out of favor."

If two mathematical structures give the same results in all cases, then they're the same mathematical structure.  Anticipating your retort, ""an approximation of what?"", they're approximation of the true reality, which is itself some very complicated mathematical structure (but not something different or extra from a mathematical structure).  I'm not sure why you think this is a reinvention of Cartesian dualism. Perhaps I misunderstand your point, but I'm not suggesting there are two kinds of things here, I'm suggesting that there is just one type of reality, and it's mathematical in nature."

It strikes me as a circular argument to then go and say, ""Yeah, but that mathematics isn't really mathematics.  This is what mathematics really is...""  In other words, it is a linguistically-conflated way of thinking about things.  To speak of mathematics as you do risks projecting the structure of human mathematical reasoning onto the universe at large (and most likely implicitly...), which is not justified (at least not axiomatically).

These aren't categorically different kinds of things; indeed, if we knew the full structure of the universe we would necessarily find in that all the approximations that we've been making.   projecting the structure of human mathematical reasoning onto the universe at large   I'm not sure what this means.

It applies much more aptly to more traditional notions of mathematical Platonism, where there is a concept of our physical reality on the one hand, and the transcendent reality of 'mathematical forms' on the other.  But I can see now that your perspectives do not conform to this traditional line of thought.  A more apt analogy, perhaps, would be a comparison of your notion of “Mathematics as Reality” to the Spinozan notion of “God as Nature.”  In both cases, someone is taking a finite, physical conceptual structure (or network of conceptual structures) and extrapolating its implications to a position of metaphysical priority.  In neither is this extrapolation really justified, in my opinion, except from a metaphorical perspective.   I don't know of any kind of mathematical reasoning other than human…   Exactly.  So why not define “mathematics” with respect to that subset of the processes of human reasoning that is obviously mathematical, rather than with respect to some as yet unknown aspect of the universe at large?  Will there be relations and commonalities uniting mathematical reasoning to the physical order manifest in the universe at large?  Of course their will.  But those relationships are something that should be discovered through scientific investigation.  Not simply assumed as true up front.   …nor do I see any reason to expect ""human"" mathematical reasoning to be incapable of encapsulating the universe.   It is this assumption, primarily, that I mean to call into question.  As a physical postulate maintained with due skepticism, I’d be all right with it.

Not developing physical intuition and rules of thumb would make it nearly impossible to design anything.

Thus, the first five chapters of the book succeed in laying out the fundamentals of quantum mechanics with little or no wave mechanics, so the physics is not obscured by mathematics. <...>""  http://www.amazon.com/A-Modern-Approach-Quantum-Mechanics/dp/8130913143"

Physics,3ayf6l,oh-delay,21,Wed Jun 24 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"Firstly, a lot of theories are driven by other theoretical constraints or thought experiments. Relativity's prevailing over the aether is a matter of theoretical simplicity, not because you can't make the aether theory conform to reality. The Schrodinger equation was invented by analogy to the relationship between ray and wave optics, not extracted from experimental data. Many theories were not motivated by ""direct experiments"", but theoretical consistency conditions on how we can merge experimental considerations together with existing understanding. Maxwell's extra term that completed the equations of electromagnetism was borne from theoretical considerations of preserving Gauss' law when considering how capacitors transferred current.  That being said, here's the basic groundwork for quantum gravity. General relativity is a classical theory, and our understanding of matter is quantum. Since the shape of spacetime is determined by the energy density within it, this poses a basic problem once the energy is quantum mechanically uncertain. A state of definite energy  is not at a definite position and vice-versa, so the concept of evaluating the energy density as a single classical number at a given position doesn't even end up making sense. This is the fundamental mismatch that quantum gravity tries to resolve.  There are two basic initial types of attempts: one is that we make the gravitational field only depend on some 'classical feature' of the quantum field, like the expected value of its position. This ends up just not working out at all. The logical structure of quantum mechanics does not like being modified, and the fact that the gravitational field also carries energy breaks unitarity and linearity of quantum mechanics, since multiple initial wavefunctions can produce the exact same gravitational field. It doesn't really end up working.  The other approach was to try and quantize the gravitational field the same way we did for the electromagnetic field and others. You promote the field to operators, impose the uncertainty relationship between a field and its 'conjugate' that mirrors position-momentum uncertainty, and introduce interactions through perturbation theory. The issue is that the resulting theory appears to be non-renormalizable. What this essentially means is that it can't be a sensible description at all scales; as you extrapolate it upwards various terms start to diverge, and other effects need to come in to soften the problem. There are other reasons to expect that high-energy gravity doesn't really behave like a quantum field theory at all, which suggests that some new sort of structure should be necessary.  String theory is one such structure. When you quantize the oscillations of a relativistic string, you find that various excitations of the string would give it different apparent characteristics when you zoom out and the stringy vibrations look small. The spectrum of the string naturally includes an oscillation that looks like a spin-2 massless particle: this is a graviton! In fact it must be: The classical limit of the equation of motion of a spin-2 massless particle is Einstein's equation. This correspondence was already known from quantum field theory.  The idea that stringy excitations naturally end up including a graviton was the main initial motivation. As people continued to work on the theory, it started to fit more and more features of what we would expect a high-energy theory of gravity to need: you can calculate the entropy of black holes using the statistical mechanics of strings, and find the correct area dependence and connections to Hawking radiation. Also, by making the fundamental elements stringy instead of point-like, we cure the theory of high-energy divergences. High energies correspond to small distances, and so making the fundamental building blocks extended objects effectively means you don't have distances smaller than the string length (though not in the sense of a sharp cutoff), which prevents the theory from blowing up at high energies.  Another main point is that the low-energy apparent quantum field theories that can result from ""zooming out"" on a string theory are not generic: rather they are of the general form that the standard model happens to take; which is taken as a hopeful sign that may partially explain some features of why we have the particle spectrum that we do. The oscillations of a string also naturally represent gauge theory, which is an important part of how fundamental forces work. The idea that strings can represent both the gauge theories in the standard model and a consistent theory of high-energy gravity in one structure is what makes it such a popular candidate for a correct theory of quantum gravity."

Physics,3ayf6l,Snuggly_Person,2,Wed Jun 24 21:25:45 2015 UTC,"This will sound naive (because it is). It sounds like strings easily gives you the graviton, but what about all the others? The standard model particles. Shouldn't (at least some of) those start jumping out of the string theory cake as easily as the graviton, if we wanna take the string-ansatz seriously?"
Physics,3ayf6l,BlackBrane,2,Wed Jun 24 21:26:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, but getting all of the features of the standard model is more complicated. There aren't different types of strings, there's one type of string and the various types of particles come about from different sorts of vibrations. To get types of particles called fermions, which include electrons and quarks, we need something called supersymmetry. The supersymmetric string is what requires 10 spacetime dimensions to live in. The specific particle collection you get depends on the shape of the curled up 6 dimensions (which determine the types of possible vibration), and so generating a large variety of particles relies on getting the shape of the extra dimensions right.   Gravity is then more ""generic"" in string theory than something like the electron. This is understood in established physics as well; a graviton is essentially a ripple of spacetime itself, and gravity is expected to be a universal force that applies equally to everything. I don't really know the details here though. The string also naturally contains massless spin 1 particles (photons!) easily enough, but getting the rest (and tuning their properties to match experiment quantitatively) is a huge undertaking that hasn't been quite completed. The starting point would probably be looking at the minimally supersymmetric standard model (MSSM)."

Correct, but this also applies to every other viable idea in high energy physics as well.  Take a look, for example at this summary plot from the ATLAS experiment, describing the results of searches for several kinds of phenonema that aren't supersymmetry. Each of these models is only excluded up to some particular energy scale. That's part just reflecting a property of how nature works, and in particular the fact that the Standard Model is now a complete theory; that new ideas have to introduce a new characteristic energy scale, and tests of these ideas are not binary, they simply exclude various possibilities up to a particular energy, at least until some new phenomena is actually confirmed.

You're right, that's absolutely is one of the goals of theoretical physics in asking these big questions, or one of the ways we could get a clue that we're on the right track. It's a very ambitious goal though.  A slightly less ambitious sub-puzzle is to say, forget about all the precise mass values, just try to understand in general why there is this huge gulf between the weak interaction scale ~100 GeV (which sets the masses of the SM particles) and the Planck scale or the scale of quantum gravity ~1019 GeV.

We know how much energy a photon has based on its speed relative to the other particles around it, but what if the whole universe was one single massless object of pure energy? It would be motionless according to the laws of special relativity, right? Motionless, weightless, formless. What would even define it? To which qualities could we attribute the values we're accustomed to attributing?  If it was previously a physical object with mass, and is then converted into pure energy, we know it has to be something still because it was something before and the laws of conservation prevent it from no longer existing.

First, a physical object decays as it radiates energy, which means that it is losing its own body in the form of energy, which to me implies it is made of energy. Second, in order for something to have a physical signature it must be vibrating. All things vibrate, and as they do so they are losing energy. The rate at which they vibrate determines their form, and the rate is determined by their energy levels. It's an oversimplification, sure, but if you delve into it I believe this will remain essentially true.

I just don't agree with the notion that energy isn't a thing in and of itself. Energy isn't a quality like the color blue, it's a quantity like weight or length. You can't easily transfer length, but you can transfer weight, so let's use that as an analogy. If I have 10, 1lb weights and I give some to you, it's true that I am not giving you 'weight' so much as I am giving you weights that are objects and happen to weigh 1lb. If I give you 1,000lbs and you can't hold that much weight, you will be forced to drop it and give that weight to something capable of carrying it (i.e. the ground), much like an electron will have to give up a photon if it has too much energy. In fact, I do believe weight is technically a form of potential energy in relation with gravity and mass. When you are talking about things purely on a physical level, referencing forms, then energy is only a property of that form. However if you stop and ask yourself what a form is, like a photon, you'll see that it is a disturbance in a field of electro-magnetic energy. The motion of a photon is actually the motion of an electro-magnetic wave, it's just not observed that way because observation collapses the wave-function. A wave is not necessarily an object, or form, and therefore we're coming to two different conclusions when we look at two different states of energy. In the particle state a wave is always an object, and the energy is always just a property of that object. When we look at the wave state, we can see that the energy is a value domino effect transferring the 'essence' of a field among itself, much like how a sine wave moves through a rope or a pond. Also if you look at something like virtual particles you have what appears incorrectly to be something coming from nothing. How would this be possible if energy could not exist without form as its carrier? The energy, or potential, must be there for the virtual particle to be created from. Yet it has no form.   I think modern science is misunderstanding energy because we're looking at it backwards, from the point of a particle and saying ""Wherever there is energy there is always a particle, so it must be a property of a particle"" instead of saying ""Yes but it's possible for energy to exist and act upon space-time without having a form previous to creating a form, such as a virtual particle"". While I may not have perfectly illuminated the topic with my explanation, I think I at least cast some reasonable doubt on whether or not energy can act upon itself in the ""form"" of information potential without a body."

For example the number 4 carries potential energy to be split into 2 and 2 without ever actually becoming a physical object. The inherent relationship between concepts, independent of an intelligent observer, permits them to exchange energy, which is the implied permutations between states of a field originating from nothingness, or the dimension of zero. All actions are hypothetical interactions between potential energetic values within the field created by the existence of this zero dimension, where zero represents both everything ( in 0 = 1 - 1, everything is all the parts ) and nothing ( in 0 = 1 - 1, nothing is the sum which is divisible by nothing else because nothing beyond the sum of the universe existence and therefore it can not be observed so it has no physical state, only potential ).  Consider the fact that if energy is the transfer of particles carrying momentum from one body to another, yet mathematically the universe does not change its total state of energy potential due to the laws of conservation, then technically ALL actions and interactions are merely taking place mathematically and not physically. They are hypothetical interactions just like you can transform 4 into 2+2 but you haven't actually changed the total value of the equation, just the form. It remains static. If you haven't added energy then you haven't made any new actions possible because there is nothing to excite the potential of 4 into 2+2 unless there is an outside catalyst. So you can observe the two states 4, or 2+2, but you can not ""transform"" 4 into 2+2 through any physical motion because it would require something other than the original sum (4) to do so. There is nothing outside of the universal sum, so how would we possibly explain motion in the universe if not being the hypothetical exchange between potential values collapsed into illusory objects by the observer?   Feel free to point out where this definition is inconsistent so I can help express it better. It makes sense to me because I'm looking at the model it's based on in my mind, but to others it may be like referencing a piece of art when you're not at the gallery with me. I tend to make assumptions that others don't agree with (i.e. information itself has any existence independent of the objects it describes). If you don't agree with any of my assumptions let me know and I'll be happy to defend them as long as you continue to be as fair and polite as you have been thus far."
Physics,3awjdz,jlapointe,4,Fri Jun 26 19:27:23 2015 UTC,"Oh my -- I've given a lot of time thinking about very similar questions! I'm gonna try to answer based on my best understanding.   pure energy   I think this phrase contains no technical meaning. It's a conjunction of two concepts that don't fit together, like ""purple justice"". (Weird example I know, but you try thinking of two words that have no meaningful connection!)   Would it be a vacuum?   By definition a vacuum is a volume of space without any matter, so yes. At least until more matter arose; then it would no longer be considered a vacuum.   what is energy exactly if it's not relative to anything?   What is energy....I like this question! Physics does not seek an answer to this. Physics just brings together observations and tries to fit them together into one coherent picture. But as to what any of it means, physics makes no claims about that. May as well ask what an electron is, too. What is momentum? What is force? You've probably wondered that too. Best answer I can think of is: they're all components of the picture physics paints.    what if the whole universe was one single massless object of pure energy? ... To which qualities could we attribute the values we're accustomed to attributing?   You're firmly in the realm of metaphysics with most of this stuff :). It sounds like you're trying to conceptualize what the universe really is -- first by mentally assembling everything into one grand category (energy) and then trying to figure out what that is.   If you haven't already, I recommend checking out the metaphysics described by Buddhism, Zen, and/or similar bodies of teachings. Often I find their approach is very well suited for people who like to probe ideas and ask these kinds of questions. I wish I could give you a more specific reference, but I'm pretty young in my explorations of that realm myself.   Motionless, weightless, formless.   (I just liked this sentence. Sounds cool.)   But if it doesn't have any external interactions... what the heck is it?   I know right??? For that matter, what the heck are you?  ""External"" is a notion that makes sense to us from everyday life, but breaks down here. The phrase ""external to the universe"" is another nonsense phrase. ""Universe"" literally means ""the totality of all existing things""; so if there were anything external to that, it would be part of the universe too, by definition. Thus, the universe can have no external interactions. Is a thing only defined by external interactions? Perhaps the universe is not a thing at all.  To put all this another way, it sounds like what you're talking about is very much about the big bang. Right after the big bang, for a period of time there was no matter, just as you're describing. Your metaphysical musings sound a lot like what people ask when considering the big bang itself, and what came before it. But most of the questions we're capable of asking are meaningless in this scenario, which is why they confuse us so.   Last thing that might be relevant: matter and mass are not the same concept. If the universe were made into just energy, it would still have mass -- because m=E/c2 . Although, I guess the concept of mass would be meaningless without a way to measure it -- another example of the whole philosophical quandary you're describing in the first place."

Physics,3awjdz,jlapointe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:44:49 2015 UTC,"Allow me to start by saying you're one of the coolest and nicest people I've met on Reddit. I really enjoyed your response.   I think this phrase contains no technical meaning.   Alright, I understand what you mean. ""Pure"" energy doesn't make sense because it's implying a form of energy that doesn't exist. Energy has forms like photons and such, right? Why don't we choose a single energy carrier, like a photon, and ask if the whole universe could possibly be transformed into light? This would bring up a new question for me. Since electromagnetic energy propagates through a different field than say, gravitational energy, does that mean gravitational energy could never become light and vice versa? Can all energy ever be reduced to a single form, or is the universe limited? I guess it's a similar question to ""What is the most fundamental particle?"" but I honestly hate that question because to me it's asking the wrong thing. Particles in my mind are just scales of a field/force perceived by an observer due to wave-function collapse. It would be better to ask ""What is the most fundamental state or form of energy?"" which may just be a personal preference but I feel it makes a difference.    By definition a vacuum is a volume of space without any matter, so yes.   But isn't matter a form of energy containing mass? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think we've actually defined matter or mass effectively yet. To my knowledge we can't create a perfect vacuum, either, because it's a logical paradox. You can't have actual nothingness surrounded by something (Defining the space containing nothing) without the something interacting with the nothing in such a manner that the nothing now contains something (qualities warped/awarded by the something). Correct?   You're firmly in the realm of metaphysics with most of this stuff :)   You will not at all be surprised to hear that once I was a devout believer in God who began using science as a way to prove its existence, only to find out that it ultimately disproved it. I admittedly have an amateur understanding of physics, but I do feel I have a unique way of looking at things that can be of some value. Maybe I won't be the one to write the theory, but I could be the one to ask the question that sparks the theory, if you get my drift.   If you haven't already, I recommend checking out the metaphysics described by Buddhism, Zen, and/or similar bodies of teachings.   Great suggestions. I have studied every major world religion and most major philosophical schools already in the same amateur manner as physics. I didn't really find answers that satisfied me there.   ""Universe"" literally means ""the totality of all existing things""; so if there were anything external to that, it would be part of the universe too, by definition.   Yes, I agree, but think of this not from a physics point of view, but rather from a programming point of view. If you programmed the universe as a cube, how would you render it visually? You can't, really, because in order to render it you'd have to make a background with noise that was equal to zero, otherwise as you said the background would then become part of the universe and you'd have to repeat the question with a larger cube including the background. This leads me to the conclusion that the universe, being information, can not be a physical object because not only can it potentially be reduced to a single substance with no external interaction (yet to be proven, still awaiting your response) but it also can not be rendered as a physical object. In other words the universe must still be in a purely informational form, and the only reason we perceive it as physical is because we too are in a purely information form. Much the way a computer would read a programmed object as physical without ever having to render it on a screen or experience it in any reality. Just mathematically.    Last thing that might be relevant: matter and mass are not the same concept. If the universe were made into just energy, it would still have mass -- because m=E/c2    Hmm. Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't that mean energy can be converted to mass, not that it is currently mass? Isn't it similar to the wave-particle duality, where the state it's in depends upon the observer and measurement? Or in another example, isn't it like any other mathematical equation where both sides are true but only one side exists in a given state? Like virtual particle pairs of equal and opposite charge. They equal zero, but they are not zero, unless you want to get into really metaphysical concepts of entanglement being a manifestation of the unbreakable connection between numbers and their representation.  Thank you for your response!"

Physics,3at926,Statici,5,Tue Jun 23 19:55:28 2015 UTC,Particles have intrinsic parity in the form of 'handedness' or 'helicity' that you have to mirror with everything else when you do a parity transformation.

In fact the weak force is 'maximally' parity violating so it's a pretty striking asymmetry.

This so-called law of parity conservation was known to be respected by classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law.  However, in the mid-1950s Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law.

I'm looking for a better understanding and any and all equations related to how an object behaves when it is flying above the ground due to inertia. A projectile.   The bullet shot from a gun, with the barrel parallel to the ground, is the best example.   How would one calculate how long the bullet stays up, and then when it begins to fall, who would you calculate it's rate of falling and time before it hits earth?  Basically...a projectile remains airborne, (despite not generating any lift) simply because it has speed or velocity. So...how does it fight gravity until gravity becomes strong enough and starts to pull it down?  Thanks!"
Physics,3atqgs,teh_lux,3,Tue Jun 23 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"no it doesn't resist gravity.  it falls all the time right from the beginning. its height y after time t has passed is determined by y = h0 -  1/2 g t2. the projectile is accelerated downwards from height h0 above ground with constant acceleration g = 9.81 m/s2. depending on h0, it reaches ground y this is 0.  on the other hand it moves independently in the x direction parallel to the ground with a constant velocity v, and x = vt. (of course you can assume the velocity decreases due to friction, but let's keep it simple).   if you calculate the time when y =0 and plug it into x = vt you get the distance the bullet travelled above ground.   this is classical mechanics which is linear,  which means that the different types of motion overlap each other independently.   also the bullet drops to the ground after the same amount of time if you don't shoot it out odlf a gun but drop it from your hand.  edit fixed some typos   why does it seem that it doesn't fall? because the velocity in the y direction starts out at zero and is much smaller than the velocity in the x direction (bullet speed)"
Physics,3atqgs,NEVERDOUBTED,2,Tue Jun 23 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"Okay...one other question for you...just to clarify.   Let's say I have two identical objects, (or if you want, the same object). In other words, exactly the same mass...etc.   I raise the first one to a height of 1 foot and then drop it.   On the second object, I raise it to a height of 1 foot, but I send it out, parallel to the ground, at a speed of 30MPH. Same as a bullet from a gun.   The rules of physics tells us that they hit the ground at exactly the same time. Right? Right. Cool with that.   But...do they fall at the same rate? For example, when the first object is half way between the drop point and the ground, is the second object also half way?  In other words, are the two same objects always the same distance above the ground as they make their return to earth?  If not, then how is the rate of fall calculated on the second object that left the barrel of the gun at 30mph?  Thanks again!"
Physics,3atqgs,oldworldavacado,3,Tue Jun 23 19:12:53 2015 UTC,"They fall at the same rate, and this is exactly the reason they hit the ground at the same time. At every moment in time, the bullets are at the same height above the ground. Their vertical velocities are the same, as are their vertical accelerations (g ~ 10 m/s2)  Here's how you can convince yourself of this.  Imagine you have a video camera. You pick up a bullet, raise to it to 5 feet off the ground, and drop it. You record a video of this, and, unsurprisingly, you see a video of a bullet falling to the ground. Cool.  But now let's fire the gun and track the vertical position of the bullet. To do this, let's imagine traveling with the bullet at ~200 m/s or whatever its velocity is. What would we record on the camera?  In fact, this video would look exactly the same as the first (where you just dropped the bullet), with the exception of the background trees or whatever appearing to move in the opposite direction at ~200 m/s.  Why? Because in both situations, you're in a frame of reference in which you measure the bullet as having no horizontal velocity.   Since both recordings--the one with the bullet fired from a gun, and the one where it is simply dropped--show the same thing, you conclude that the horizontal velocity of the bullet has no bearing on its vertical motion!  The physical reason behind this is that gravity is the only force acting on the bullet, and so is the only factor we need to consider when determining it's vertical descent (possible lift notwithstanding). Because the acceleration due to gravity is always ~10 m/s2 (assuming you don't go too far away from the Earth's surface), the vertical trajectory will always be the same.  Interestingly enough, it also doesn't matter whether you're doing this with a bullet or a cannonball. The acceleration due to gravity doesn't care about the object's mass!"
Physics,3atqgs,NEVERDOUBTED,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:36:15 2015 UTC,"Very good stuff. Thank you!  Let me jump into something with a bit more application...but still along the lines of trajectory and mass and falling mass (I think).   Let's say you have your average car or truck.  And let's say you have your average speed bump.   When you hit the speed bump at 2MPH, the entire chassis of the car/truck lifts and almost literally follows the path of the ground/bump. So the trajectory of the chassis is radically altered due to the bump.   When you hit the same bump at 50mph, the chassis has less trajectory change. In fact, it's possible to have no chassis trajectory change, (it stays flat or parallel to the ground).   So the big question is, why is that?  Here's what remains constant.    The weight/mass of the chassis.  The weight/mass of the suspension assembly.  The rate (force to inch) of the spring that holds the car up at a given height. (not always true, but let's say it is).    Here's what appears to be different.    The mass of the chassis has velocity and inertia.  The mass of the suspension assembly has forward velocity and inertia.  The mass of the suspension assembly also has a compressing velocity and inertia with it.  The wheel is rotating faster.  The speed at which the suspension compresses is much faster.  The amount that the suspension compresses is much greater.    BTW - There is always an increasing rate of damping the faster the suspension compresses (this is a given). It does not become less simply because of speed of compression.    With that, I'm not exactly sure why the trajectory of the chassis stays flat (or flatter) or more parallel to the ground when the car has forward speed.   Is is because the forward speed of the mass of the chassis makes it harder for the chassis to moved from it's trajectory?  Or is it because the weight/mass of the wheel assembly has more inertia and is hammered into the shock and spring?  Here's another thing to consider. If the car had no velocity, but you were able to magically smack the bottom of the wheel with a giant hammer (generating the same inbound energy as the 50MPG speed bump hit) would the chassis remain as still as it did when the whole vehicle was moving...or would it lift?"
Physics,3atqgs,oldworldavacado,3,Tue Jun 23 20:24:29 2015 UTC,"I can't go into much depth at the moment, but think about the difference between these two scenarios:  1) You hit the end of a spring with a hammer. The force applied to the spring is over a very short period of time, and you get a strong but easily damped compression wave.  2) You push up on the same spring slowly and, and then slowly let it come back to its equilibrium position.  In the second scenario, there is enough time for the displacement to be carried through the system so that the motion is easily detected--there isn't much wave behavior. In the first, the impulse to the system propagates and dies out much faster, over some N number of oscillations (depending on how good your shock absorbers are)."

Physics,3atqgs,jazzwhiz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"The calculation is pretty straightforward. The first step, which is the most important, is to treat the horizontal and vertical directions separately. The forces and motion in one direction do not affect the forces and motion in the other direction. In both cases, gravity provides a force on the object in the downward direction, so it will accelerate down. In one case there is no horizontal velocity, and in the other case there is. But since the initial velocity is perpendicular to the force of gravity, the vertical motion is completely unaffected.  The key is that the initial velocity is perpendicular to the vertical direction. If the initial velocity was a little bit up or down (or a lot up or down), then the time to reach the ground would be different, and it would depend on its velocity."
Physics,3atqgs,whereworm,2,Tue Jun 23 20:48:37 2015 UTC,"Hi, since I came across this in /r/askphysics, I give it a shot. I am interested in simulating an electrically charged liquid. At the end the liquid should carry both charges, but at the beginning it is enough to consider something like an electron sea. I know the concept is common in solid state physics, but I can't see where to put in the electric charge when I'm considering a fluid simulation which implements the Navier-Stokes equation. Does anybody know a defining equation for that, or an article which leads me a bit further?    The picture in my head looks like a positive point charge (nucleus) attracting a elctrically charged liquid that eventually forms a liquid atmosphre around the point charge. The last step would be to apply an oscillating homogenious field, that the liquid is sloshing back an forth like one half (one club) of a p-orbital. Until now one charge would be even enough. At this point a single charge and an attractive point force is enough, but I would like to see the nomenclature of electrodynamics, not gravitation and everything non-relativistic.    I started with Salome, OpenFOAM and Paraview, but the mesher manuals (i.e. snappyHexMesh) are too complicated for me to get into touch. Then i tried just Blender for everything and it kind of works, but I'm doubting the correct physical backround here. I can script in python though, so maybe someone could hint at how to implement this problem. I already went through this lecture, but i don't want to miss the convenience of the modelling, meshing and 3D viewing tools (GUIs).    Thank You! (Now with better orthography.)"

I understand how it works in the gravity of galaxies, that it represents something like 35% of the universe, how it corrects the weight problem on the galaxies, but, does this dark matter presence influece gravity in smaller scales, like, for example, the solar system?"
Physics,3atqgs,CrankyArabPhysicist,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:16:26 2015 UTC,"Dark matter has no significant impact on orbits within our solar system. The simple reason is that dark matter is (thought to be) very evenly distributed. This leads to relevant things :   The amount of dark matter relative to baryonic matter within our solar system is actually quite small, as the solar system represents a small but particularly dense area of baryonic matter, whereas dark matter, being distributed evenly, does not ""clump up"" within the solar system. Given the difference in net amount of each matter, this factor alone is actually enough to explain why dark matter has no impact on the solar system's orbits (if you run the numbers on this you'll find that there is about 100 million times less dark matter than baryonic matter in the solar system. It's worth noting, however, that an even distribution of matter can also decrease its local gravitational impact. A simple way of understanding this is the following : imagine that you were surrounded by stars that were laid out in an even grid around you. You would feel the gravitational pull of each star on you. Now, which direction would you move ? Obviously none, because the even distribution of stars means that all the different pulls cancel out. For you to be pulled in one direction the stars would have to be clumped up in a certain area, thus producing more pull in one direction than in another. Likewise, on the solar system scale, the gravitational pull of an evenly distributed dark matter would create no net pull. Indeed, if all the dark matter in the solar system (despite being 100 million times less than all the baryonic matter in the solar system) were to be clumped together and placed close to the orbit of the moon, than its gravitational impact on the earth would actually be significant."
Physics,3atqgs,JonasPistolas,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:18:15 2015 UTC,"Hum, just like I thought. But for example, in terms of galaxies, where the mass diferences are really big, and, let's say, the inner space between stars is also a lot, dark matter doesn't have quite a distributed padron, it's just in the gaps, right?"
Physics,3atqgs,CrankyArabPhysicist,2,Tue Jun 23 15:35:35 2015 UTC,"On a larger scale, though it's still not clear what the exact distribution of dark matter is, the density distribution is no longer uniform, though it's probably rather smooth in that, like I said, it's not clumped up into small structures, at least not on the scale of solar systems. Therefore, no, it's not ""just in the gaps"" as you put it. It's spread out all over the place, and the density distribution has no reason to drop significantly at the edges of solar systems."

While it might not be patchy (despite some recent papers beginning to open up to this possibility), it definitely isn't uniformly distributed, in general. Across our solar system the variation is (should be, I suppose) almost nothing. But across a galaxy the variation is considerable. A commonly used distribution is the NFW profile (that is actually starting to lose a bit of its luster lately, but is still very accurate) that puts the majority of the DM in the center of the galaxy."

BTW, I totally disagree that a photon is a particle. I say, it must be a wave that we just haven't discovered it's transmission medium.

Physics,3atqgs,zifn,2,Fri Jun 26 20:24:40 2015 UTC,"Someone else might be able to explain this better than I can but I'll give it a shot.  At a very fundamental level light is the result of an oscillating electric field inducing a magnetic field which in turn induces an electric field and so on. Both the electric field and the magnetic field exist without a medium (two electrons will always repeal each other even in vacuum, and two magnets will attract each other even in vacuum). Since light is made from these fields, light can propagate without a medium. Also, since those fields must oscillate to make light, light is also a wave. Thus light is a wave that doesn't need a medium to travel through.  As an aside, the idea that light needs a medium (or ether) to propagate has been looked into for some time and was refuted in the 1800s.

It is clear that then the binding energy (I think gluons) contains the remaining mass, this one can be lead by the formula E = mc ^ 2 . Now if energy has a mass it has to cause gravity.

Basically solving the Newton-Schrödinger equation for an axionic Bose-Einstein condensate and trying to determine the properties of the gravitational bound states that it forms. I first started solving it in Mathematica because it was easy, but I've since ported my code to C and have seen a speed up of over two orders of magnitude!

Physics,3apgjt,iorgfeflkd,2,Mon Jun 22 15:14:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool. I think I read a paper about this type of thing in Nature Physics a year or two ago. Is the Newton-Schroedinger equation the same as the Schroedinger equation with a Coulombic potential, but a different constant?"
Physics,3apgjt,physicswizard,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:40:35 2015 UTC,"It's like the Schrodinger equation with a nonlocal gravitational interaction. As in the wavefunction is self-gravitating, so the gravitational potential needs to be calculated using m|ψ|2 as the mass density in the gravitational Poisson equation. Axions have a small self-interaction as well which adds an additional nonlinear term, so I'm trying to explore the effects of that as well."
Physics,3apgjt,iorgfeflkd,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's actually something that comes up in my totally unrelated research, except it's repulsive. Basically I can write a field equation for the probability of finding some chunk of DNA at some given location, which in its simplest form is equivalent to the diffusion equation and also the Schroedinger equation with real variables. Then there complexities to add, like the fact that DNA is self-repelling (hence the nonlinear term), and the fact that it has bending rigidity (which now makes the field a function of orientation as well as location, which makes it way more complicated)."

Physics,3apgjt,eewallace,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:07:42 2015 UTC,"Are you looking at length scales on the order of DM haloes? If so, what determines whether you can treat the gravitational interaction as non-local? Is it similar to EM radiation where retarded-time effects only come into the radiation field, so you don't need to worry about them except in potentials strong enough to make GR effects important?   I'm not sure if that question even makes sense, but I'm just going to roll with it for now and come back to it after dinner."
Physics,3apgjt,physicswizard,2,Tue Jun 23 00:42:10 2015 UTC,"Axions are supposed to be created in a bose-einstein condensate after vacuum realignment, so it is ok to treat a gas of them as a single wavefunction. But since this wavefunction is macroscopically large, it gravitationally interacts with itself over long distances which keeps it gravitationally bound. So when I say nonlocal, it's nonlocal in the sense that different parts of the wavefunction are attracted to each other. I've actually been musing on retarded potentials lately; I think the timescale on which the structures I'm interested form is much longer than the time it takes for light to cross a typical galaxy (I hope!), so it should be ignorable. I hope that approximation is valid but if the results of my simulation suggest quick formation times I might have to rethink that."

It attempts to provide a reason why a universe would tend to have three bulk spatial dimensions without invoking anthropic arguments.  They calculate the entropy of de Sitter space (expanding empty spacetime...sort of) as a function of some arbitrary dimensionality, and find that it is maximized when d=2.97, and 3 if integers are demanded. There are a few other conditions they set that allow them to calculate this (RTFP, I guess). I thought it was pretty interesting that they were able to derive this, which is why I posted it.

Physics,3alt66,BlackBrane,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:07:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Glad you posted it.  If you're keen on possibly-satisfying non-anthropic mechanisms that could explain d=3, my favorite is string gas cosmology. If you're not familiar with it, basically you assume that space starts out very small and compact, with closed strings wound many times through the space, which prevents the space from expanding. Then, as you evolve the configuration, the closed strings come into contact and interact (like this), allowing them to gradually unwind, which allows some of the spatial dimensions to expand. And now the punchline: The odds that two closed stings are able to find each other and interact drops dramatically above d=3 to almost zero, so the unwinding process that allows space to expand doesn't continue past d=3.

You can package up a lot of the particle content by making use of the high degree of symmetry the Lagrangian has. Of course, implicitly, the packaged formula kinda assumes you know what symmetries are at hand, what the content of each multiplet is, the version on the shirt is the  verbose one, with each quark, each lepton, each weak boson featuring individually. Also, it is expressing the Standard Model after electroweak symmetry breaking, so it has lots of Higgs related terms. Again, if you put everything in multiplets before the symmetry breaking all the expressions condense a lot more.    Edit: here is the most condensed version I know courtesy of CERN"

Physics,3aih1u,Raphii,34,Sun Jun 21 12:22:53 2015 UTC,"The shirt has a big equation on it. This equation is a Lagrangian. A Lagrangian is an equation that holds all the information you need to figure out the basics of how a system behaves.  This particular Lagrangian is called the ""Standard Model Lagrangian"" which means that it holds all the relevant information you need in order to figure out how the particles of the Standard Model interact.  It looks unwieldy because this version of the equation is very explicit. There are ways you can write the same Lagrangian more compactly and in some sense more ""usefully"".  You might have heard that the Standard Model (SM) unifies Electromagnetism (EM) and the Strong and Weak nuclear forces. Well, the equation kinda works just like that. Here's a ridiculously high level sketch of it:  L(SM) = L(EM) + L(Quarks) + L(Higgs and Quarks Interaction) + L(Higgs)  The whole Lagrangian is just a sum of Lagrangians describing more fundamental interactions. The first chunk describes how strong the EM field is. The second chunk describes fermions, like quarks, which covers most matter. The fourth chunk is the Higgs and the third chunk is the Higgs interacting with quarks, i.e. the ""Higgs Mechanism"". Gravity is completely out of the picture."
Physics,3aih1u,BruisedGooch,5,Sat Jun 20 18:10:28 2015 UTC,"thank you so much for this.  Two more questions:   What unit will the result be in?   How does the equation calculate how a system behaves, is it just the result of all forces?"
Physics,3aih1u,True-Creek,22,Sat Jun 20 19:21:56 2015 UTC,"Good questions!  What unit will the result be in?  Doesn't matter! Units are entirely arbitrary and often theoretical physics is done in natural units to make things ""prettier"", but the units you choose don't matter in the equation. Whatever units you choose to plug in for ""charge"" or ""mass"" will be spit right back out at you. The equation works independent of units.  Though, you wouldn't use this equation to get one numerical result like you would for a simpler physics problem. There are so many levels of abstraction that have to go in to an equation that describes so much, typically you have to make tons of simplifying assumptions to get anywhere.  Here's an example: say you want to find how some electron moves. You could use the L(SM), but in this problem every non-EM term goes to zero, the EM Field tensors (the big F with the subscripts on the mug in that picture I posted) are well defined, and basically the entire Lagrangian would collapse and reduce to Maxwell's equations.  In that case, you're better off just starting out with the assumptions of classical EM and working your problem out from there.  How does the equation calculate how a system behaves, is it just the result of all forces?  After the first couple of years learning physics, forces stop being used so much. It's a vector quantity which depends a lot on how you set up your coordinates and other arbitrary things. Energy is waaaaaay better.  Energy is a much nicer and more fundamental quantity which is more generally useful. If you properly add up all of the energies in a system and assume that everything is trying to take the path of least resistance, you can figure out how things are gonna move without having to explicitly know which direction it will move.  The technique of adding up energies and finding the ""minimum"" action is called Lagrangian Mechanics. It's very math-y, but the gist is that a Lagrangian is just a sum of the energies of a system. Then, you take a bunch of derivatives of the Lagrangian in a particular order and what comes out is equations of motion."
Physics,3aih1u,BruisedGooch,3,Sat Jun 20 20:56:14 2015 UTC,"I have some more questions if you don't mind:   Are there physicists who know everything about the whole formula, or can one only specialize only on a small aspect of it within a lifetime? Is the unification with gravity expected to be describable in terms of a Lagrangian as well?"
Physics,3aih1u,CornCobbDouglas,9,Sat Jun 20 21:35:43 2015 UTC,"Are there physicists who know everything about the whole formula, or can one only specialize only on a small aspect of it within a lifetime?  A globe encompasses the whole world, but a globe is pretty useless for finding directions to the train station. The L(SM) is true and very impressive but it's useless for practical problems that most physicists would specialize in. Someone researching quantum computing, fluid mechanics, or lasers would never remotely deal with that equation. Only specialists in High Energy Theoretical Physics or a few very closely related fields would bother.  The math is very hard and requires years of training, but it's not hard to find someone who knows what they're doing. Any professor and most grad students at your local university working in a relevant field (High Energy Theoretical Physics, Particle Physics, Phenomenology, Cosmology, etc.) will know all about this equation, what the terms mean, how to manipulate it, and the implications of it. This equation encompasses a staggering amount of physics, but it's all a very well defined and structured mathematical model which we humans created. With enough time, any person could understand it.  Is the unification with gravity expected to be describable in terms of a Lagrangian as well?  Almost certainly. Classical gravity is already describable this way. But, uniting gravity and the other forces is really difficult. Really really. It's entirely possible that it won't happen for another several decades or even centuries down the road until some more sophisticated math is invented and turns out to be better than the Lagrangian formalism. But that's getting pretty speculative."

A Lagrangian is the equation that describes a physical system and finding them is a very large chunk of physics, because you can work out everything that will happen by pushing in your setup and doing some straight forward math.  The reason that there is some confusion about the names is that Joseph-Louis Lagrange was a very smart man and has a bunch of stuff named after him.

Physics,3aih1u,TheMac394,4,Sat Jun 20 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"It looks like /u/Marthius hit the nail on the head in terms of what a Lagranian actually means. Here's an annotated description of what's going on in the actual Lagrangian in OP's post, at a level of complexity somewhere between OP's equation and /u/BruisedGooch's equation.  To translate the description more into layperson's terms:   The first line is the kinetic term for each of the gauge fields. These are the fields that ""carry"" the forces between the fundamental matter particles (quarks, leptons, etc.). The U(1) field carries the electromagnetic force, the SU(2) field carries the weak force, and the SU(3) field carries the strong force The second line is the corresponding kinetic term for leptons: electrons, electron neutrinos, and their heavier counterparts, the muon and tau. The reason it's been broken up into terms involving ""eL"" and ""vL"" and terms involving ""eR"" and ""vR"" is part of the strange behavior of the weak force, which treats ""left-handed"" and ""right-handed"" particles differently Jumping ahead, the fifth line is same thing, but for quarks.   These lines, all together, give something like the kinetic energy for all fundamental particles.  Next:   The third and fourth lines are mass terms for the leptons. These can be thought of as giving an additional ""mass energy"" to the Lagrangian. The phi that you see in these terms is the Higgs field, which couples to the matter fields to give mass. Note that the fourth line, with neutrino masses, is generally considered ""beyond the Standard Model"". Lines 6 and 7 are the same thing, but for the quark fields.   This covers all of the terms describing the ""familiar"" particles: Quarks, leptons, and the force carrying particles. Finally, then:   Line 8 describes the Higgs boson. Mass terms for all of the above particles are created using something known as the Higgs mechanism. The theory behind this mechanism predicts that in addition to the familiar quarks, leptons, and force-carrying bosons, we should see an additional Higgs boson appearing. This last line gives the kinetic term and mass term associated with the Higgs boson.   In loose terms, these give something like the kinetic and mass energies for all of the particles in the Standard Model. As /u/Marthius described, we can then apply the Principle of Least Action to figure out how these fields will behave.  If you've been paying attention, it might look like something is missing: The kinetic terms and mass terms for all of the particles are there, but where are the forces? At the moment, it looks like these particles are all just freely flying around without interacting.  The answer is that the forces are hiding inside the kinetic terms, as a result of something called ""gauge theory"". Here's a quick-and-dirty explanation:   Let's imagine you've got a Lagrangian for only matter fields, with no force carrying particles. Suppose you look at it, and see that it has some kind of weak symmetry, called a ""global symmetry"". What we mean by this is that if we take our field and mess with it a little, the Lagrangian doesn't change. In gauge theory, you try to promote that weak global symmetry to a much stronger symmetry, called a ""local symmetry"", which allows to mess with our fields a lot more without changing things. Unfortunately, you can't usually do that - all kinds of extra terms fall out when we start messing with our fields. We get around this by introducing a second field to ""soak up"" the extra terms. When we mess with the first field, we also mess with the second field in a way that matches up nicely. Extra terms fall out of both fields, but they cancel each other out, giving us the nice local symmetry we wanted. In order for the ""soaking up"" to work, the second field needs to interact with the first field, and this interaction is where the ""forces"" come into the standard model. These ""second fields"" are the fields carrying the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, and the terms U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) that came up before are just the names of the local symmetries that they allow.   For notational convenience, we usually absorb the interaction with the gauge fields into the kinetic terms for the matter fields. An ordinary kinetic term has a derivative operator in it, usually written ""d_mu"". We replace that ""d_mu"" with ""d_mu + gauge field interaction"", and call that whole thing ""D_mu"", which you'll see showing up in the kinetic terms. If you want to see what the interactions actually look like, the equations in the pdf I linked to right below the Lagrangian (labelled (2), (3), and (4)) show the explicit form.  In summary: You've got a bunch of ""kinetic energy""-like and ""mass energy""-like terms for your fundamental particles, and interactions hiding inside the ""D_mu"" operators in the kinetic terms. The interactions show up as a result of trying to strengthen the weak global symmetries in the matter fields to stronger local symmetries."

You'd still need prior knowledge of lots of things and/or, at some point, you'd need to accept things without an explanation. Using your analogy with cars, let's say they were to explain the gearbox. For them to explain the metallurgy or making a gear, you'd have to know a lot about chemistry to really understand why gears are made the way they are, then some physics to understand why they work and then still need to accept that the exact shape they have is more effective since that is based pretty much only on math.  My point is, the level of explanation you're asking for is basically that of a degree, with the difference that the degree teaches you things in a certain order that may seem pointless but makes your understanding better down the road, such as having a bunch of classes on electromagnetism before dealing with EM in quantics."

The rigor, importance, and beauty of such an achievement like the Standard Model is cheapened for ""comedic effect"" without a thought as to just how detrimental this kind of idiotic joke is to public perception of/engagement with physics, physicists, and science in general.     To wit, I don't believe knowledge has any intrisic value. The value of knowledge grows as it is shared with the rest of civilization. If the purpose of a scientist is only to discover (or create) new knowledge and add it to the current pool, then I'd say it a worthy cause and one I support 100%. But a noble cause, the kind which propels our society towards a greater ideal, includes the facilitation of knowledge sharing with general public. This runs counter to that cause. It's obnoxious, at best promotes intelligence fetishization (which also runs counter to general knowledge sharing), and at worst it alienates those who might otherwise be interested in learning. As practicing or aspiring physicists we have the responsibility to welcome others to knowledge, not lord it over them.     Let me make this clear, this isn't just about the joke. I get the joke and I get that's it's ""only a joke"". I just don't think it's worth the risk, minimal though you might think it'd be."

Do you somehow think it's beneath science (and scientists) to attempt to have a sense of humor?   Not at all. I don't have a problem with scientists having a sense of humor about science, themselves, or anything else. Part of the reason I love being around physicists is because the large majority of them have a great sense of humor and are friendly, down-to-earth people. My problem lies specifically with this type of joke.     Does it sully the beauty and grandeur of the accomplishment, and somehow despoil all the hard work of the men and women involved to place it on a t-shirt?     Nope. I don't have a problem with slapping science/scientists/etc. on a T-shirt/TV-show/website. And I don't think it takes away from the thing itself. Re-reading my post I definitely see how this question came about, though. My point was more that the value of the information is overshadowed not by the medium but by the context (this kind of joke) in which it is placed. It's the difference between the CERN T-shirt and OP's. Though I guess it's not a good analogy since one isn't a joke.     You need to take a good look around. Science (and scientists) need all the support (and like it or not, this means popularity) and friends it can get these days.    And if that means packaging it and putting it on a t-shirt then so be it.   I don't mind the popularity, whether it's on clickbaity sites or TV or whatever. I understand it's what's necessary if the goal is to make science (and really knowledge in general) more accessible to the general public. I'm thrilled that people got so pumped about the curiosity landing. I'm excited to watch as this subreddit grows everyday, as well. And I'm REALLY happy that I've noticed more (though not many) people respond with ""ooh, I've wondered about..."" instead of ""oh you must be really smart/I hate physics"" when I tell people what I study.     Excuse me, but your argument is precisely the sort of ""placing science up on a pedestal"" philosophy that alienates the public at large.     Quite the opposite. Frankly, what is specially grating about the shirt is that it reminds me of the elitist attitude I see in some folks in the ""hard sciences"" about either the ""soft sciences"" and (specially) about the liberal arts. My goal would be to make science (and arts and humanities) more accessible to the general public. The fault in my argument is that it was geared towards an audience of scientists and those who deal in knowledge acquisition. I did not intend to appeal the public at large and thus didn't expect that it would alienate said public. It was appeal toward our social responsibility to the general public. You may disagree whether or not we actually have a responsibility to make knowledge accessible to the general public; it's an interesting debate. Personally, I think we do have that responsibility, whether or not we delegate the task to someone else, but at the very least we should provide a welcoming environment to that end.   If wearing a t-shirt makes one kid laugh and want to have a discussion about the science behind it, I consider that a victory.    And you really should too.     And I guess this is the crux of the matter. Given the number of upvotes this post has received, I might be wrong about the effect this shirt has on the general public. Or maybe physics aficionados are just more likely to take this shirt more lightheartedly than others. We'd have to run the experiment to find out and I would love if someone actually did it (maybe we can ask someone at another subreddit for help with some sort of survey?). I just don't think this is the kind of joke someone with a responsibility to the public should be wearing. I honestly believe this shirt runs counter to that."

Physics,3alpam,MarkLawrence,5,Sun Jun 21 13:12:46 2015 UTC,"In order to measure distances, you need 2 things: 1) a 'metric' which gives you a distance function: 2) a set of well defined spacetime events which you desire to measure the distance between.   In your example, the universe you describe is still a metric space, so there exists a formal means of measuring distances. However, in a properly 'empty' state, you have no points of reference. There are no spacetime events occurring, and the space is entirely isotropic and homogeneous. In this case, you have a true sense of diffeomorphism invariance, where you could always recoordinatize your manifold such that two arbitrary points are at arbitrary metric distance away from each other. In this sense, although distance exists, it is not a unique measure and it loses meaning.   The issue is in 2). You have no way of making reference to two distinct spacetime points in a unique way that couldn't be turned into two other points by a new coordinate map.   Edit: I forgot to address your question about singularities. In the context of your question about distance measuring, a singularity would violate 1) instead. You can lump them in with anything that doesn't admit a metric description, where you can't properly define a distance function. ""Internally"" is not a well defined descriptor for singularities as they are usually point objects, but the fact that you can't measure distances on/in (whatever that means) a singularity is the same reason (in the context of your question and my two qualifiers) why you couldn't do it for any region of space that wouldn't admit a non-degenerate metric description.   TLDR: universe case has distance but no points to measure between: singularity has no notion of distance"
Physics,3alpam,redditandsuch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:30:16 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm asking two things:  i) can a non-empty universe be homogeneous in the same way an empty one can be? An empty universe would still have fields and particles produced at random - it would be homogeneous in a statistical sense as nothing is truly empty. And similarly an old enough universe where matter had decayed to fields would in time be homogeneous too in a statistical sense?  ii) if distance becomes meaningless because it is not measurable, doesn't it cease to exist (in the same way that separate position and momentum are not meaningful quantum concepts because they cannot be measured separately? And if it ceases to exist then how is it different from a singularity?"
Physics,3alpam,redditandsuch,2,Sun Jun 21 18:50:48 2015 UTC,"i) can a non-empty universe be homogeneous in the same way an empty one can be?   On its face, the answer to this is 'maybe for a global definition of homogeneous, but not locally'. In the same way that we treat our universe as homogeneous and isotropic even though it certainly has matter in it and is for even large local patches neither of those things.    An empty universe...   You're entering into the realm where your language has to be very precise--'empty' can be different things in different contexts. If you are asking whether a hypothetical spacetime which exists in a pure vacuum is the same as one created from some sort of heat death, then geometrically the examples you just gave are usually taken to be the same. We can abstract your question further to just consider any patch of Minkowski spacetime, where whatever situation we have globally or in the past, the local geometry of our patch is usually still treated as Minkowski--there is no local sense of geometric hysteresis. But here we aren't treating how these quantum vacuum fluctuations backreact to alter the local spacetime structure.  If your question is getting into that aspect, you need to appeal to quantum gravity where the 'empty state' is one where there is no metric description--not because of some pathological singularity, but because there simply is no spacetime yet. If you are considering the presence of some particle, you need to consider the fact that it is not only shaping the spacetime around it, but generating the spacetime around it.   Nevertheless, something else to deal with is the fact that your vacuum particles are virtual. You can say things like 'in a highly curved space, there may be more energy density available for larger temporary violations of energy conservation, leading to more energetic vacuum fluctuations', but I don't think you can say too much about the other side of the coin.    ii) if distance becomes meaningless...    Distance is function, and as such it has domains and codomains and conditions on when it can be uniquely defined. ""Ceasing to exist"" is not a mathematically well-defined thing--you are conflating the notions a bit. ""Distance becomes meaningless because it is not measureable"", in mathematical terms, is saying there does not exist a metric. This is opposed to the case where distance becomes meaningless because you can't define your points unambiguously without imposing an external reference, not that you couldn't measure between them. As I mentioned before, regions where there is no metric description (for the purpose of your distance question) is no different from a singularity. There are other situations, however, which don't admit a metric but aren't singularities as you are thinking of them.   Keep in mind, the condition for calling something a singularity has nothing to do with whether you have distances in the way you are thinking about it. A curvature singularity is a point on a manifold where coordinate independent quantities like scalar curvature diverge, leading to a geodesically incomplete spacetime. It doesn't even make sense to take about distances 'inside' a singularity--they have no internal structure, so the comparison you are drawing is faulty there.   TLDR: If your goal is to say that just because you can't make unambiguous distance measurements the space is isomorphic to a singularity, you are mistaken."
Physics,3aiht7,mandragara,14,Sat Jun 20 14:42:41 2015 UTC,"Basically, you know the standard derivation of the fact that particles in 3 spatial dimensions must be either bosons or fermions?  It goes somewhat along the line of: take two particles, perform a continuous rotation that brings them back to their original places; by a continuous rotation I mean a path in SO(3) from the identity to the identity, so a loop with base point 1.  The state must not have changed, so the wavefunction must have at most acquired a phase. This phase depends on the loop chosen. Evidently, the phase is equal for homotopic loops. So we just consider homotopy classes of SO(3). Then we study the map (homotopy class) > (phase), i.e., a π(SO (3)) -> U (1) homomorphism (since composition of loops gives the product of phases).  SO(3) is not simply connected and in fact it has fundamental group Z_2. Equivalently it can be written as the quotient of its universal cover SU(2) by its fundamental group. The two elements of Z_2 intuitively correspond to making an even or odd number of full turns. The two possible homomorphisms are sending Z_2 to {1,-1} or just to {1}. This gives respectively fermions and bosons.  In two dimensions, this is different. The rotation group is SO(2) with fundamental group π_1(SO(2)) = Z, which is infinite, and universal cover R. Homomorphisms to U(1) of the fundamental group belong to two families:  1) an infinite family of semi-interesting Z->U(1) homorphism of the form n -> exp (i n/m * 2π), m integer, which are just Z->Z_m covers. These are particles returning to the original state after m turns. m=1,2 are bosons, fermions; m>2 are weird and I've never heard of them.  2) maps of the form n -> exp (i n * theta) with theta incommensurable with 2π. These are the most likely case. The image of the homomorphism is a dense subgroup of U (1) which is actually isomorphic to Z. For these particles, anyons, the number of turns is completely important. There is no nonzero number of turns that brings the system to the original state. Any turn gives an exp (itheta) phase.  Z is in fact the braid group for two elements.  Generalizing the above to many particles, you get the braid group as the image of π_1(SO(2)).  Why you get braids can be seen by drawing the spacetime diagram (which is 3D) of the wordlines of the particles as they get swapped around continuously. The diagram itself is a braid as defined in the discussion of the braid group.  Since braiding is a topological thing, and the wordlines of braided particles are effectively ""knotted"", they are very stable under perturbations. This makes them very appealing as a possible degree of freedom where to practically store quantum information with less concern over thermal disturbations."

Physics,3ah2wt,dmdbqn,2,Sat Jun 20 03:00:32 2015 UTC,I don't understand how you have gone from equation 1 to equation 2 and you have not defined m in these equations but I think it should be (1+v/c)/(1-v/c) which would mean that it does depend on the relative velocity of the mirrors. But perhaps I have misinterpreted something you have said.  Sidenote: mirrors aren't (generally) 100% efficient so photons would be lost very quickly due to the large number of reflections required to produce the effect. This would make it impractical for real world usage.

Besides that, does Amplitude change while reflection when reflected wave's frequency becomes different by doppler effect?

Are those stuffs are quite different from this situation...?"

Why don't they fade away...? Are those stuffs are quite different from this situation...?   The situation is different because in a lasing cavity, energy is being added to the system by a pump. The energy levels of the lasing medium are excited by the external pump and population inversion follows such that what light is present in the cavity becomes amplified upon stimulating emission of the excited medium. So even though light is lost after each bounce off one of the ends of the cavity, enough energy is being added to the system to increase the number of photons in the cavity, or in the case of a laser with a partially reflective surface, to reach a steady-state equilibrium.  /u/ParagonOfApathy is right. If you simply had light bouncing back and forth in between two mirrors, the light would be absorbed very rapidly, as even after only 7000 bounces half the light will be absorbed using some of the best reflectors (99.99% reflective)."

Physics,3aeczh,SirKashmoney,3,Fri Jun 19 13:02:15 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm a rising college freshman and plan on majoring in physics and have a few questions about textbook choices.    1) Can anyone recommend a good textbook for modern physics?     The course I'm signed up to take next semester uses the sixth edition of ""Modern Physics"" by Tipler and Llewellyn, which is terrible, if the popular consensus on Amazon is to be believed. My math background includes what is typically taught in calc I, calc II, and a first course in linear algebra, but I don't think linear algebra knowledge is expected prior to this course. It would be nice if there is a solution manual available for it too, but I'm not as picky about this requirement. Ideally I'm looking for something that provides solid intuition and isn't hasty with the math in derivations.    2) Does anyone have suggestions for a good mathematical methods for physicists book?    My school does not have an undergraduate level course on this material, and I'm slightly worried I won't be able to keep up with the math because of it. I've also looked at undergraduate research opportunities with several professors in theory and they all emphasize that the math background is just as necessary, if not more, than the physics background. Ideally the book would:     Hold my hand a bit, so to speak. I've seen lots of Dover books in this subject realm on Amazon, and while I can't accurately gauge their difficulty, most seem to be more of a concise review and less of an instructional resource. Have a solution manual available, or at the very least have worked out sample problems and solutions to a lot of problems. Provide lots of intuition about when to use the math and why it is useful, as opposed to presenting information in a cookbook-style format. Be aimed at underclassmen primarily--skimming Amazon reveals that most of the books are written with the senior undergraduate/graduate student in mind, per the descriptions.   Sorry if these requirements are a bit demanding, haha. If they are, I'll take any suggestions, really."
Physics,3aeczh,theCalculator,6,Fri Jun 19 17:15:27 2015 UTC,Tipler is an excellent modern physics book. A close second is by beiser.   The text by Mary Boas is the standard undergraduate math methods text.  It's as good as the you are going to get at the undergraduate level.
Physics,3aeczh,hopffiber,3,Sat Jun 20 02:11:19 2015 UTC,"What exactly is included in ""modern physics""? If I can guess, it'll be some introductory relativity and some introductory quantum mechanics, and perhaps some overview of particle physics, something like that? If so, and if you're interested, it's probably better to get a few proper undergrad-level books about these subjects, rather than some huge book that doesn't properly cover anything.    Does anyone have suggestions for a good mathematical methods for physicists book?   Honestly none of the undergrad books that I've looked at have been particularly great. But a decent one that includes a lot of stuff is the one by Riley, Hobson and Bence. It has pretty much all the math one sees/needs as an undergrad physics student and probably a bit more, and it has a solution manual. Boas is another standard one."

Physics,3aeczh,hopffiber,2,Fri Jun 19 20:10:24 2015 UTC,"This sounds appealing, but I'm concerned I won't have the proper math background to go through them.   Well, special relativity requires no more math than some basic calculus and the concept of vectors, so you should be fine there. Quantum mechanics is linear algebra and a little bit of differential equations. If you've solved second order ODEs and know terms like eigenvalue, eigenvector, you know enough math to properly do quantum mechanics. If you're going for a physics major, you will probably take QM later, so you can just get the book used for that class now instead.   Particle physics is a lot more demanding to do properly, requiring some group theory, representation theory and QFT to do properly. So for such an intro course, you'll probably only learn some basic facts about the standard model and stuff like that, with next to zero math involved.   And no, I don't really have a preference between Boas and Riley et al., they are probably both good and quite similar."

I will be majoring in Astrophysics/Astronomy and I'm just looking for some tips. I'm pretty good at math, I passed my Calculus course this year with a B (only because I'm lazy and chose not to do the homework assignments, though I know that will have to change with college). Anyways, I'm really just looking for tips on the concepts of physics, because that seems to be what gets me. Some units I understand the concepts really well, others I THINK I understand the concepts, but then I don't do well on the concepts portion of the test (our physics class had 2 tests every unit, a conceptual test, and a free-response, math driven test), it was pretty standard for me to get a C on the concepts and an A on the free-response portions. So any tips for concepts? Also, I was wondering if anyone had any ideas or techniques they use for keeping their brain active over the summer. I don't want to lose the ideas and knowledge I already have. I'd rather keep the things I already know about Calculus and Physics, and even learn more, rather than lose the knowledge. One more note, I downloaded Python because my teacher said the number one thing past students said they wish they had learn in high school is programming, because they very much needed it in college Physics and Math classes. Anyone know a good place I could learn a fair amount of programming for free? Actively that is? Python has a manual to read, but I'd much rather actively learn. The manual will be my last resort.

How does the frequency change as he approaches you, and you are stationary."" (Question wasn't exactly asked like this, but same basic idea.) So naturally my answer was that the FREQUENCY did not change. The answer was marked wrong, and the 'correct answer' stated that the frequency was higher.

One of the motion equations, with constant acceleration, is: v2 = 2a(x-x0)+v02 We found this by finding what the derivative of the velocity with respect to motion would be (not gonna lie, we needed the internet to figure out this one, because it was the one equation we couldn't find).

It should be read more as a parable than a statement on the pedagogy of latin america. Memorization is expected in other countries like France, and by and large their students are much stronger and capable than their US peers. This is mainly because it's absurd to think that you can get by in physics purely by memorization, and yet people continue to stress understanding over memorization, as if you can't do both. Memorizing helps you so much because you're able to make connections that much faster between what you're learning."

Physics,3addxv,CondMatTheorist,4,Fri Jun 19 19:22:23 2015 UTC,"Because in France, and Belgium and probably most other european countries, do Jackson level EM, Goldstein level CM, and Sakurai level QM in their 2nd year. They also do baby Rudin level analysis in their first year. By their (terminal) 3rd year, they're doing QFT on hte level of Peskin and Schroeder. They're effectively 2 years ahead of their US peers."
Physics,3addxv,k-selectride,11,Fri Jun 19 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"That may well be, but there's a world of difference between taking a class at a certain level of material and actually developing meaningful competence in it.  Why aren't these brilliant typical French students crowding out those weak US students at Princeton? Making novel contributions to the QFT they've so thoroughly mastered as soon as they start grad school, instead of a couple years in like their American peers do?  Learning physics isn't a sequence of checkboxes next to impressive sounding textbooks, which is why I've been severely underwhelmed by many of the European physics students I've met. To be clear I'm underwhelmed by American ones too, I just don't see much difference."
Physics,3addxv,CondMatTheorist,6,Fri Jun 19 19:56:42 2015 UTC,"This is kind of needless posturing and it's pointless to argue about what happens in the post-doctoral setting when the thread is about physics education. I pointed out that students in European universities (my experience is only in France and Belgium, and I'm assuming the level is similar elsewhere and I have no reason to believe otherwise based on my interaction with students from other countries) successfully complete in 3 years time what US students take ~5-6 years to do. They do so in an educational system that encourages and rewards memorization. I also think they rather than coming out behind, they are ahead and I make this based on my own experience in that system versus my time at a US university.  And frankly, I don't think what I'm saying is outrageous. France and Belgium in particular have disproportionate amounts of Fields medalists per capita so it shouldn't be surprising that the same educational system would produce similar strength graduates in a field like physics which isn't massively different. That, and if you consider the sheer amount of time that's spent memorizing + understanding + doing homework, versus doing homework + reading for understanding, the difference in skill isn't hard to rationalize.  edit: but if you have a different experience interacting with European students I can't really say much to change your opinion. If you have the opportunity to do a year abroad (if you're still a student) or attend one of the intensive schools they like to organize (like Les Houches if you're a PhD or post-doc) I highly recommend doing so."

It would be very important to know if this was the case! But you haven't demonstrated anything to the original claim that the students are stronger, only that they might be faster.  Indeed, I thought you were talking about undergrads (I do know Europeans that did Peskin and Schroeder as undergrads; I muscled through Goldstein as an American undergrad, for what that's worth.) But yeah, American graduate students in decent programs do all of those courses, at that level, in their first two years of graduate school (or not, but take a qualifier exam after those two years, at that level), not spread out over 6. The remaining time is used a little bit differently, sure. I personally think the shorter time frame would be better to adopt, because senior graduate students (in the American system) are often essentially post-docs and should be compensated appropriately.   That, and if you consider the sheer amount of time that's spent memorizing + understanding + doing homework, versus doing homework + reading for understanding, the difference in skill isn't hard to rationalize.   No, I'm not asking you to rationalize the difference in skill, I'm asking you to demonstrate it. Otherwise it's a religious belief."

It must be annoying to have your science defined by a 50 year old opinion and always have to defend yourself against it.

The difference is now students see and understand the problem with ""memorizing"".  They complain about it. They complain that their labs are terrible, and few times do they ever do practical work in them.   I think the problem comes down to professors as govt employees that cannot get fired. They are often arrogant and want to make it stupidly difficult for students and not help them. They don't care so much about keeping up with new tech because it's just about memorizing equations. And so cheating is rampant among students. And professors looks the other way because it doesn't hurt them- just the students- and they are getting paid all the same.   It also comes down the the procurement of tech in Brazil. They don't (probably cannot) manufacture the equipment themselves to set up a high quality lab without importing anything. And the govt is in the way with massive import taxes on everything, especially electronics.  For example, a $2000 computer in the US costs about 2.5x more in Brazil. It's literally cheaper to fly to the US and return with a new computer than to buy it in Brazil. So the labs will always remain shitty especially nowadays when the govt is cutting funding and professors and students alike protest for more money/better quality of education."
Physics,3addxv,dimethylman,4,Fri Jun 19 11:06:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you!    This is, in a way, very encouraging.   I think the problem comes down to professors as govt employees that cannot get fired.    This is even stronger over here: Humboldt's idea of independence of research and teaching is so deeply ingrained in European culture that it shields a tenured professor even from government/employer quite well.   And still, while there's often stories how this makes professors lazy, and some people are quick to point out the absurdities this leads to. And still it's not the cesspool of inability that's often attributed to this independence.   In my experience and those I talked to, it comes down to individual qualities. Some people in teaching and in administration are committed to do a good job, some administrations are better at creating a good environment for them."

Actually I think this is a fairly common personality trait among Brazilians.  The rich and people in power especially love to see others fail.  It makes them feel superior and they are not afraid to shove their superiority in your face.  They like maintaining that distance. I don't know how it's in Europe, but in federal universities in Brazil, it's common for a 5 year engineering degree to take 6-7 years because some teachers literally fail 75% of students in a class every semester. (perhaps this is just secluded to the university where I work, I can't say for sure) There's a lot of favoritism in this, not just lack of effort on the teachers' and students' parts.  I've heard stories of professors watching students on a process to failure, only to mock them when they fail, saying, ""I knew that was going to happen, hahaha!"" and a $50 piece of equipment blows up in a student's face.  There is little to no guidance.  I have a student whose final project was given the go-ahead and told to finish it before returning to his advisor.  When he finished he was told he needed to do it over because it was all wrong, and he was denied help along the way.  These professors seem to be among the majority.  Quality individuals are hard to come by.  At least that's what my students tell me."

But a generous reading of the text would be that the first measurements in the report were done at 10-6 Torr, and only the last few were done at slightly lower than atmospheric pressure (750 Torr).  A pressure of 10-6 Torr is almost certainly low enough to rule out air-currents as the source of thrust.

Physics,3ajad4,iorgfeflkd,14,Sun Jun 21 17:46:24 2015 UTC,"If you have a comment regarding the physics in the linked paper, it is welcome.   Challenge accepted!  The suspicion begins on the first equation when they define conservation of momentum for a photon using the Newtonian formulation, which is not at all appropriate because it's classical, non-relativistic, and depends on mass. For the photon mass they invoke ""MiHsC"" which  means ""Modified Inertia due to a Hubble-scale Casimir effect,"" except it's not due to Hubble-scale confinement in this case, it's due to the walls of the cavity...ok fine...just say ""the photon gains an effective mass due to confinement in the cavity."" Anyway, they claim an accelerating object gains a proportional increase in mass due to the Unruh effect and also a cosmological factor. Ok, but the photon has zero mass anyway so this won't increase it, according to his own equation.   This is possible because the photons involved are travelling at the speed of light and are bouncing very fast between the two ends of seperation s and their acceleration (a ∼ v2 /s) is so large that the Unruh waves that are assumed to produce their inertial mass are about the same size as the cavity, so they can be affected by it, unlike the Unruh waves for a terrestrial acceleration which would be far to long to be affected by the cavity   Ok, what? I guess it's some sort of effective ""expectation"" acceleration for light in the cavity...plugging in some values we get about 1017 m/s2 for acceleration and applying Wien's law to the Unruh temperature (is that what they're saying?) gives a peak wavelength of 1.5 meters. Ok, 10 times the size of the cavity...where does the inertial mass come from? This is not made clear. Nowhere in this derivation does it say where the inertial mass comes from for the photons, and then it continues to use this mass in the rest of its derivations so I can't really follow it. He uses the relation E=mc2 to get rid of the photon mass (again, this does not apply to photons) and handwaves this energy into the time-integrated power. Comparing his equation 9 with his equation 7, he is claiming that photons in this cavity have a rest mass of 832 times that of a proton. Experimental bounds on photon mass are thirty orders of magnitude smaller. I thiiiiink that's where he's getting this force from. This also predicts the photons are propagating at roughly 1 m/s. A rough calculation puts the excess mass due to all these photons at about .4 grams, which is proportional to the square of power. Because the force is linear with power, and the excess mass due to photons increases with the square of power, this predicts that acceleration will actually decrease with enough power  In my opinion if they are going to invoke the Unruh effect which comes from quantum field theory, they should work in a formalism that is consistent with quantum field theory and not use Newtonian mechanics with combined massive/massless particles.  The final result is that they derive a force/power ratio for the system of 216 millinewtons/kilowatt (4.6 km/s). If we compare this to what is expected from radiation pressure, which actually exists, that is just the speed of light so 0.003 mN/kW.  tl;dr the photon gains mass proportional to the microwave power in the cavity, and then gains more mass due to the Unruh radiation from accelerating between the cavity walls.  Why did I spend so much time on this.  edit: I was out for a jog and realized another crucial flaw: it invokes the Unruh effect to explain why the ""cone-ness"" causes thrust. It uses the acceleration c2 / d to get the Unruh radiation. However, the photon mass imposed by the cavity (which is a different effect, in this paper) reduces the velocity to 1 m/s, bringing the acceleration down by a factor of 9x1016 . I think if this were to be propagated through, it would bring the expected force down by the same amount."

But if you look at a two-point function of some variable σ, <σ(x)σ(x')>, it is a measure of how likely it is that the value of σ at x and x' overlaps. For example, in the Ising model where σ = ±1 is the ""ising spin,"" we can say that <σ(x)σ(x')> measures ""given a value for σ(x), what is the probability that σ(x') = σ(x)?"" It turns out that in the ferromagnetic/ordered phase, the two-point function is a constant (and equal to 1 at zero temperature), since you expect all the spins to be in the same direction. In the paramagnetic/disordered phase, it decays like <σ(x)σ(x')> ~ exp(-|x-x'|), since you expect spins close to each other to have a good chance to be in the same direction, but far away it's relatively unlikely due to thermal fluctuations. At the critical point they have a power law, for example <σ(x)σ(x')> ~ 1/|x-x'|1/4 in 2D."

Physics,3aaxjb,mofo69extreme,3,Thu Jun 18 18:50:52 2015 UTC,"It is an expectation value. The variable σ(x) will have an associated probability distribution ρ(σ(x)), and we can define a quantity <f(σ)> = ∫dσ(x) ρ(σ(x))f(σ) where dσ(x) means we integrate over all possible values of σ(x) for all possible x (this can be a discrete sum if the σ and x are discrete). The function f(σ) is any function of σ. The two-point function is defined to be the expectation value of σ(x)σ(x'). It is generally a function of both x and x', but in systems with translation invariance, you can show that it must be a function of |x-x'|.  The precise form of ρ(σ(x)) depends on the context.

Physics,3aaxjb,shinypidgey,7,Thu Jun 18 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"They are incredibly important.   Correlation functions (or Green's functions) are can be useful as solutions to many linear differential equations because you find a solution for an arbitrary 'source' by adding together point functions (since a linear combination of a linear DE solution is another solution).  Green's functions can come in many different forms.  Correlation functions are extremely useful in quantum mechanics, where the propagator (2-point correlation of the wavefunction) is the Green's function of the Schroedinger equation.  If I remember correctly, if you know only the propagator of a system then you can calculate almost any quantity about the system you want, including the energy levels and even the partition function.  Furthermore, on the theoretical side modern Quantum Field Theories (which are used in everything from particle physics to condensed matter physics) need correlation functions of fields in order to do most calculations.  For experimentalists, 2-point correlation functions are valuable as they let you understand and correct for detector effects.  For example, if your particle detector or telescope smears the data due to poor resolution but you know the point spread function you can correct for the smearing and get a clearer image.  Finally in statistical physics correlation functions are useful for calculating transport coefficients like the thermal conductivity using Green-Kubo relations.  I understand I might not have clarified much but at least you know that the topic is very important.  You can also try searching for material using other names like 'Green's function', 'point spread function', or 'impulse response function.'"

The full details are in Sakurai's quantum mechanics book, equations 2.6.20 to 2.6.25.  If you integrate the propagator over all spatial dimensions with x'=x (so that you are essentially looking at the autocorrelation in time only, and make the substitution beta=i*t/hbar, then you recover the definition of the partition function, which depends on the energy levels.  If you take the Fourier-Laplace transform of this quantity, you get a complex function, G(E), that has a pole at each energy eigenvalue.  Thus you use the propagator to calculate G(E) and then study its analyticity and where it has poles to get the energy levels.  You can work it out by hand for a SHO, but for more complex systems I think you would probably have to use a computer."

By measuring the correlation of the noise signal received at different locations, it becomes possible to measure the geometric delay that the signal incurred. With a dense enough sampling of this phase space, one can then reconstruct the original image with a resolution much higher than that of the participating instruments. GPS satellites transmit a signal with a special encoding that has a single sharp peak in its cross-correlation. Finding that peak allows the distance to the satellite to be measured. GPS is furthermore designed such that each satellite uses a different code, that correlates poorly against that of each other satellite (Gould codes).

Physics,3aaxjb,ThickTarget,2,Thu Jun 18 20:06:37 2015 UTC,"I use 2 point correlation functions in galaxy surveys. There the correlation function simply tells you the probability of finding a galaxy x distance away from another galaxy. That distance can be in 3D space, redshift space (where distance and velocity along the line of slight are smeared together) or an angle on the sky. They are very powerful as they contain information about the strength of clustering and can be used for cosmological tests like Baryon Acoustic Oscillations where primordial sound waves are frozen into the galaxy distribution as the universe expanded and cooled and now show up as a preferred separation. The baryon peak can be seen in the cosmic microwave background and in the current day, charting it's size over cosmic time is a powerful test of cosmology.   For galaxies a correlation function is very simple, you just basically measure the distance between each pair of galaxies and bin that distance, and normalise by some factor (usually given by doing the same calculation for random points).   You also analyse the CMB in terms of a correlation function, or power spectrum (basically just a Fourier transform). WMAPs mission was to measure the two point correlation function in the temperature anisotropy."
Physics,3aaxjb,jliebert,2,Thu Jun 18 21:07:37 2015 UTC,"I'll answer from the perspective of many-body physics in condensed matter systems. The correlation functions of various quantities (charge-charge, spin-spin, etc.) are essentially what is measured through techniques like neutron scattering  and inelastic X-ray scattering. That means understanding the corresponding correlation function is critical to relating these scattering techniques to physical phenomena in materials.   The correlation function tells you how a quantity (e.g. spin) at location x affects the same quantity at a different location x' (another spin). You would think this requires both the spin at x and x' to be within the same system (i.e. atoms in a solid), but this is not a requirement. What if instead an atom, or more specifically a neutron, was fired at the system instead? This is the intuition behind why a correlation function not only tells you how particles affect each other in the material, but how the particles would respond to a small external perturbation. In the latter case, the external perturbation takes the place of the second position and interacts in a way proportional to the correlation function. This is why the spin-spin correlation function is also called the magnetic susceptibility in the Ising model.  As far as applications, neutrons can measure spin-spin correlation and can shed light on spin dynamics (magnons, antiferromagnetism etc.) that other techniques just cannot do directly. Neutrons can also be used to map out the structure of lattice vibrations in materials (phonons). How does it to that? There is a direct correspondence between resonances in the scattering cross-section and poles in the correlation function corresponding to excitations."

Physics,3abkdw,endowdly,3,Fri Jun 19 08:44:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know the curriculum. I went to a heavy engineering school and we were embattled with problem sets daily. My HP35s was my battle buddy. I used it in my physics courses just as much. So it'll depend on your school, I think. I use my 50g at work in the lab now. My field is RF simulation and modulation. I use the 35s still for quick work and for my work in the field. So if you want calculators that will last your whole life and perform, those are my recommendations.   RPN is incredible. It takes a minute to learn if you've only used infix your whole life, but when it comes, it'll be quicker and easier. Just think of RPN as how you do elementary math elementary. When you add 234 + 345 you don't write them down that way. You put 234 on top of 345, then the plus. That's essentially the stack. :)   If you want to practice now, if you're on Unix, load up dc in terminal and practice. If you have a Mac, the boxed calculator app can be set to rpn as well. Mac also ships dc in the terminal. I am pretty windows illiterate."

The 50 ships with robust and multiple integrating programs.   The 35 supports unit conversions (and you can easily program extras). But it does not support unit cancellation.   The 50 does both unit conversations and you can add units to your problem and it will unit cancel for you and display in your preferred SI prefix. :)"
Physics,3abkdw,BigBeerBellyMan,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:14:29 2015 UTC,"Reverse Polish notation:  NSFW ?      Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands, in contrast to Polish notation, which puts the operator in the prefix position. It is also known as postfix notation and is parenthesis-free as long as operator arities are fixed. The description ""Polish"" refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented (prefix) Polish notation in the 1920s.   The reverse Polish scheme was proposed in 1954 by Burks, Warren, and Wright  and was independently reinvented by F. L. Bauer and E. W. Dijkstra in the early 1960s to reduce computer memory access and utilize the stack to evaluate expressions. The algorithms and notation for this scheme were extended by Australian philosopher and computer scientist Charles Hamblin in the mid-1950s.    During the 1970s and 1980s, RPN was known to many calculator users, as it was used in some handheld calculators of the time designed for advanced users: for example, the HP-10C series and Sinclair Scientific calculators.

Physics,3a6egs,randonymous,79,Wed Jun 17 17:05:04 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! Heavy ions and even lighter charged particles will give off their energy in a medium as linear energy transfer (LET). When that happens, it leaves what we call a latent ionization trail where the structural integrity of the medium has been weakened. When we chemically etch away surface layers of the irradiated medium, conical pits form at the sites of penetration and leave Ion tracks. They can be circular or elliptical in shape, however sometimes we see some interesting phenomena like scattering or target fragmentation. The plastic used for these track detectors is CR-39; a high-purity version of what is used to create modern eyeglass lenses (you can etch your lenses and see tracks).     You can think of it as an exposure-development process. What you are seeing are not particles themselves, but the footprints left after the etching. Most of the time it is due to secondary alpha particles created in a proton or neutron interaction; you won't see photons here. In this case what has happened is that a whole unstable nucleus nuclear fragment hit the detector straight on while radiating its decay products all over the place. This is the first time I have ever seen this in several years looking at track detectors. The odds are astronomical.     This is an image that I captured today using a microscope connected to a high resolution positioning controller and a top mounted CCD. It is controlled by Samaica software and is used to analyze ion LET spectra."

It's much more reminiscent of the pattern left by a small radioactive particle (many atoms) that became embedded in the detecting medium.

Physics,3a6egs,rageling,8,Wed Jun 17 21:47:12 2015 UTC,"It's on the order of a few microns, although it should not make a difference because the pits etched away in the surface of the plastic will always be far greater in size than any nuclei.

Physics,3a6egs,katatonos,5,Wed Jun 17 19:08:58 2015 UTC,"Sort of. We are looking at the 2D surface of a piece of plastic. Under the microscope you do get a 3D affect as you fine focus deeper into the tracks. Any scratches in the surface look like a canyon by comparison.       You don't worry about running out of space on the detector. We look at areas in square microns, and even then there is a lot of empty space where you see nothing but plastic or defects in the plastic. Someone else recommended I post some other images so I may do that for example."

Physics,3a696r,doesntrepickmeepo,6,Wed Jun 17 17:16:09 2015 UTC,"Flavour oscillations aren't news, but most experiments have been based on disappearance rates, rather than appearance rates. That is, you make a beam of electron neutrinos of known flux and then count how many electron neutrinos you detect at some distance, and compare the fluxes to get an estimate of how many of the neutrinos in the initial beam have oscillated into some other flavour. The earliest experimental evidence for neutrino oscillations (as far as I know) was the solar neutrino problem, which is exactly this kind of thing.  The first appearance measurement, i.e. create a beam of neutrinos of one flavour and actually detect neutrinos of a different flavour some distance away, was done by T2K a couple years ago, detecting electron neutrino appearance in a muon neutrino beam. The news here is a detection of appearance of tau neutrinos, which is somewhat more challenging because the mixing between tau neutrinos and either of the others is much weaker than between the others, and because the tau by which you detect them is much shorter-lived. But basically, it's a matter of closing loopholes in the theory - detecting oscillations in all the ways they could occur, making sure the results agree, etc.  What's sensationalized about it (at least one thing) is that the evidence was pretty much there a year ago, and this is just finally passing some arbitrary significance threshold. Basically, they needed to observe five tau neutrinos to claim whatever detection significance they need for a journal to let them call it a ""detection"" instead of ""evidence"" or ""possible evidence"" or whatever. They had 4 candidate events as of last year and they just found a fifth."
Physics,3a696r,eewallace,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:08:41 2015 UTC,How can the experiment tell the difference between the handful of neutrino detections from the accelerator source and neutrinos from space? Aren't we bathed in all flavors constantly?
Physics,3a696r,mnp,2,Wed Jun 17 23:20:09 2015 UTC,"I believe that most of the local neutrino flux is from the sun. Solar neutrinos are produced as electron flavor, and between about 33% and 60% of them (depending on energy) oscillate to other flavors between there and here. Since the mixing between the electron and muon flavors is much stronger than between either of them and the tau flavor, the majority of solar neutrinos (and therefore the majority of the local neutrino flux at earth) are electron and muon flavor. They have large lead targets between the beam and the detector, which serve to increase the probability of neutrinos actually interacting there compared to in the surrounding material. The can also measure the momenta of the particles produced in the interaction and estimate the direction the neutrino came from, to ensure that it's consistent with the direction of the beam. Since they're detecting the taus through their decays into muons, misidentified νμ interactions are a much larger background than real ντ events from other sources."
Physics,3a696r,eewallace,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:45:41 2015 UTC,"FYI, the lead between beam and the detector is to absorb neutral beam components not increase the MSW effect.

Physics,3a696r,eewallace,2,Thu Jun 18 15:29:56 2015 UTC,"How can the experiment tell the difference between the handful of neutrino detections from the accelerator source and neutrinos from space?   Energy, direction, time and lepton particle type.  The energy of the neutrinos in Opera's beam is larger than that of the bulk of natural neutrinos from the sun and atmosphere.  The directionality of the detected lepton must be consistent with the parent neutrino originating from CERN.  The beam is pulsed so the neutrino interaction must occur in brief moments consistent with the spill of the proton beam at CERN that made the neutrino.    Finally, the tau neutrino is detected via the produced tau lepton which produces characteristic interactions in the Opera detector that look unlike muons and electrons.   Aren't we bathed in all flavors constantly?   Yes and no.  Solar (electron) neutrinos oscillate to muon and tau neutrinos and are fully mixed but are not energetic enough to produce muon nor tau leptons themselves so their oscillations can not be observed in appearance mode.  Atmospheric neutrinos are produced mostly of of type e and mu and are not fully mixed for any given possible baseline between you and their point of origin.

Physics,3a5d7a,mk_gecko,17,Wed Jun 17 10:32:54 2015 UTC,"If dark matter were somehow proven not to exist, the vast majority of physicists and astronomers would be very surprised, very excited, and would get to work figuring out what causes all the things we ascribe to dark matter. Same as when any other well-tested theory is disproven. In that case, people might take MOND more seriously for galaxy rotation curves, but we'd still need to come up with explanations for the Bullet cluster, the CMB power spectrum, etc, etc.  What struck me as funny about this article was the mention of explaining the discrepancies in the dynamics of galaxy clusters with large densities of neutrinos. Neutrinos are dark matter, they just can't be all of it (or a very large fraction of it). Even the MOND enthusiasts end up proposing MOND plus some extra matter just to solve the rotation curve problem.   That's pretty much the core of the objections to MOND. People don't reject it because it's crazy, or because it doesn't explain what it tries to explain, etc. But the choice is between cold dark matter on the one hand, which explains the rotation curves, observations like the Bullet cluster and weak gravitational lensing, structure formation, the CMB acoustic power spectrum, and probably some things I'm forgetting, and MOND on the other hand which (mostly) explains the rotation curves, but then requires some other explanation for all those other things, for which the best candidate we have is ... cold dark matter!  It's not a conspiracy, it's not an unwillingness to consider unorthodox ideas, it's just looking at the theories we have and picking the one that best fits the observations. If people get a bit of flak for clinging to MOND, it's not because kids these days have some dogmatic belief in CDM; it's because clinging to MOND in the face of a much more explanatory theory just doesn't seem like good science."

Nothing. It's a fit, there is no interpretation of it. Dark matter on the other hand is more-or-less ab initio, we don't understand what it is but we understand the affect it has on cosmic structure.

Then you look at the visible matter distribution for a galaxy, calculate a predicted rotation curve, and compare to the observed rotation curve.  With dark matter you also get to pick a distribution of dark matter which is completely different for every galaxy, and that distribution can be basically anything.  That's a lot of extra freedom, and somehow MOND can predict rotation curves without using that freedom.  In other words the dark matter arranges itself to make MOND appear to work.  The $64K question is why.  (Technically I suppose there's a little wiggle room in the mass-to-light ratio, but not a lot really.)"
Physics,3a5d7a,bg2b,3,Wed Jun 17 21:06:36 2015 UTC,"But dark matter also has to fit in what we know of cosmological evolution, which puts serious constraints on it. We know how galaxies form, and dark matter should follow the rules of GR. If the resulting distributions of dark matter in various coalesced galaxies did not provide correct results then dark matter would be falsified. You can't actually just arbitrarily set the amount for every galaxy, there has to be a dynamical reason why particular amounts of visible matter significantly correlate to particular amounts of dark matter. MOND gets to take advantage of this relationship manually, but the extra modification comes out of nowhere. By simulating galactic evolution in the presence of dark matter we can provide a dynamical explanation for its appearance."
Physics,3a5d7a,Snuggly_Person,2,Wed Jun 17 21:21:30 2015 UTC,"There may be more degrees of freedom, but there's still a tendency for dark matter distributions to be similar across different galaxies, just as the visible matter distributions are often similar.

Physics,3a0rcv,DesmondOfIreland,4,Wed Jun 17 08:24:58 2015 UTC,"This is a totally valid question, and my biggest issue with this graphic. It completely ignores the quantum part!  The answer is that the particles don't know how they will be measured beforehand. Typically we are looking at spins. In this experiment, you can think of the particles as little arrows pointing in any direction. We can only detect if the particle is point up or down relative to our detector. If the particle is pointing sideways and it hits the detector, 50% of the time it points up, 50% of the time it points down. So here is the spooky part. Classically, if that first particle was pointing right, your second particle should be pointing left, correct? But your first particle hit the detector and it happens to point up to match the orientation of the detector. The second particle will now point down 100% of the time! If it was still pointing left, we would measure up 50% and down 50% of the time. Classically, your second particle is not correlated with the first measurement. But in Quantum mechanics it is."

If I set my detector to measure 'yellow or purple?' it measures how yellow the particle is. This means that a green particle appears yellow ~70% of the time and purple ~30% of the time. Each time it can only be one colour however, and every single time I measure yellow, my other particle appears purple (and vice-versa) despite the fact that classically that particle was red and should appear yellow at least sometimes.   You might ask then, well how do you know the particles weren't just yellow and purple the whole time? For one, in the design of these processes we know the colour is random. Second, I can rotate my detectors and it still works! If I start measuring blue-orange instead, the particles remain correlated. Finally, the detectors can actually rotate relative to each other. Ie. one measures yellow-purple, while the other measures orange-blue. This case is a little more complicated to work out, but it shows the quantum correlation as well."

You can either first reach your hand into the box and feel the shape of the object, or you can lift the lid of the box and see the color (but not the shape) of the object.  If Alice reaches into the box and feels a rubber duck, there is a 100% chance Bob has a ball.  If she then looks at the rubber duck and sees it is red, there is only a 50% chance Bob's ball is red.  Conversely, if Alice first looked into the box and saw the color red, 100% chance Bob has a blue toy in his box.  If Alice then pulls out the toy and it is a rubber duck, it is even odds for Bob to have a ball or a rubber duck.  Hence, polarization and chosen angle for measuring polarization.  The spookiness is how the universe knows what angle you chose to measure the polarization such that it is 100% anti-correlated if the other guy measures polarization at the same angle two miles away.  e:formatting"

Consider photon polarization and label horizontally polarized with H and vertically with V.  (|HH> + |VV>)/sqrt(2) and (|HV> + |VH>)/sqrt(2) are equally entangled states.

Physics,3a0rcv,tone_,4,Tue Jun 16 15:16:16 2015 UTC,"You wouldn't be able to manipulate one and observe a change on the other, because any manipulation of one and not the other would disentangle the two.  The easiest example is a spinless particle decaying into two fermions with spin 1/2.  Since the original particle was spinless, the two fermions must have total spin 0.  This means they are in a state where each particle is as likely to be measured to be spin up versus spin down.  When one is measured, however, the spin of the other particle is known, since the total spin is conserved.  The key here is everything you do to the particles conserves total spin, so the conservation law is valid.  If you, say, apply a magnetic field to one of the particles, the total spin will not be conserved between the 2 particles.  You could end up with both particles up, or both down.  This is why you can't transmit information using entanglement.  You simply know that a far away particle is, say, spin up, but you can't communicate this fact faster than light to the person far away measuring the other particle."

Physics,3a0rcv,nosneros,2,Wed Jun 17 04:15:25 2015 UTC,"In a quantum computer, you typically create entangled pairs by:   Start with two OFF qubits.   Overall state: OFF OFF  Hit the first qubit with a Hadamard gate, which turns an OFF qubit into an (ON + OFF)/sqrt(2) qubit.   Overall state: ON OFF/sqrt(2) + OFF OFF/sqrt(2)  Use that Hadamard'ed qubit as the control in a Controlled NOT Gate that toggles the other qubit. This toggles the second bit in any parts of the superposition where the first bit is ON.   Overall state: ON ON/sqrt(2) + OFF OFF/sqrt(2)    That's it."

Physics,3a0rcv,nosneros,2,Thu Jun 25 04:26:03 2015 UTC,"A decent stand-in for a Hadamard gate, for the position of a photon, is a beam splitter. It's not exactly identical (I think there's some extra phase factors, e.g. you might get OFF/√2 + ON/√-2 instead of OFF/√2 + ON/√2), but it's good enough.  You can make an operation be controlled by the position by placing it on only one of the paths. For example, if your second qubit is the polarization of the photon, then a half wave plate placed on the top path will do the trick for entangling the polarization with the position.  It's honestly a lot easier, at first, to forget about the physical realization and just think about qubits and quantum operations as mathematical entities. As abstractions a quantum computer will provide."

The particles they hit then start moving at the, now dissipating, shock speed, until they collide too.    So there's the shock wave traveling through the material, and a mass of displaced particles following the shock wave more slowly.  Then shockwaves start reflecting around inside the area if there is still stuff present.  A strong enough shock wave will definitely clear the gas out of an area and leave a temporary vacuum, but I don't really understand your distinction between gas and particle, so I'm not really sure what that question is after.

The Rankine-Hugoniot relations give the conditions of the gas molecules on either side of a shock wave, but this assumes a uniform gas composition (as I understand it, at least). Something different needs to occur when a solid particle is present... The shock wave should have a partial reflection, generate a rarefaction wave, create an oblique shock... something.

Maybe it's that the effects are so small that they are negligible at these scales, but I don't have any information supporting that either.

Physics,3a18sa,FdelV,3,Tue Jun 16 13:02:12 2015 UTC,When dealing with diffraction in the context of Bragg's law no one ever cares about n=2 and always sets n=1 as far as I have seen. Example: indexation of powder diffraction patterns. I've been trying for abit to argue to myself why this could be possible but I can't find it. Yeah you could invoke a convention where you set n=1 by default but in that case your d-values would become smaller than the true ones (rational fractions of the true value to be exact) which would mess up the whole indexation process of setting it equal to h²+k²+l² and such. So I suspect there is some reason for not caring about n=2 that I'm not seeing.

It is a form of S-matrix theory.  In the 1960s and '70s, the ever-growing list of strongly interacting particles — mesons and baryons — made it clear to physicists that none of these particles are elementary. Geoffrey Chew and others went so far as to question the distinction between composite and elementary particles, advocating a ""nuclear democracy"" in which the idea that some particles were more elementary than others was discarded. Instead, they sought to derive as much information as possible about the strong interaction from plausible assumptions about the S-matrix, which describes what happens when particles of any sort collide, an approach advocated by Werner Heisenberg two decades earlier.  The reason the program had any hope of success was because of crossing, the principle that the forces between particles are determined by particle exchange. Once the spectrum of particles is known, the force law is known, and this means that the spectrum is constrained to bound states which form through the action of these forces. The simplest way to solve the consistency condition is to postulate a few elementary particles of spin less than or equal to one, and construct the scattering perturbatively through field theory, but this method does not allow for composite particles of spin greater than 1 and without the then undiscovered phenomenon of confinement, it is naively inconsistent with the observed Regge behavior of hadrons.

Physics,39vl7n,interguru,67,Mon Jun 15 03:58:18 2015 UTC,"Good question, let's run through some thought experiments.  Consider the normal situation where two (spin polarised) photons are created, separated (within each other's horizons) and then the spin on one is measured. We then know for sure what the other's spin will be.  Now what happens if, before the measurement, one photon is allowed to fall into the event horizon of a black hole. Are the two photons entangled? If information is to be conserved, then yes, the are still entangled, and if we measure the photon outside the event horizon, then we know what the spin polarisation of the photon inside the event horizon is. However, that information is simply not available to us. This Wikipedia section explains what might happen to the information.  Now, the juicy part comes when one asks, as you did 'what about when the horizon is cosmological?' Well, now there are further complications. A certain censorship is in place, as we will not be able to measure the photon on the other cosmological plane. Is there any way that it might make its way back to us, as in the case for the event horizon of a black hole? It is difficult to say.  My opinion is that the information is definitely lost. This violates the principle of unitarity, but so does a universe that expands so quickly that parts of it are lost for eternity. People may argue that by turning back the clock, you also reverse the expansion, but this is a tenuous assumption. The Dark energy driving the expansion of the universe is, as yet, untamed by the laws of physics. It may (or may not) be a unitary phenomenon, we just don't know, so we can't justifiably make the assertion that it is, therefore the passing of information across the cosmological horizon may not be a reversible process."

That is, is there any experiment I could do (fly around the black hole, get close to it, etc.) in which I actually observe an object (or photon) cross the event horizon in finite proper (from my perspective) time without committing to crossing the event horizon myself?   No. You cannot measure things that are far from you, as simple as that. You can measure photons that came from there, but it's not the same thing.  You perform local measurements, not global. It does not matter what your global coordinate system is, only your local frame."
Physics,39vl7n,rantonels,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:35:58 2015 UTC,"No, there is no experiment you can do which allows you to observe any object crossing the horizon so long as you remain outside it.  From the perspective of an observer outside the horizon nothing ever crosses it.  In classical GR this a moot point, because there is no observable difference.  In a model where black holes radiate then there is a very serious observational difference, although you have to wait rather a long time to see it."
Physics,39vl7n,one-hundred-suns,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:46:14 2015 UTC,What if you measure the photon and then allow it to fall into the event horizon of a black hole (or move it across some cosmological horizon)?
Physics,39vl7n,zarzak,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:02:23 2015 UTC,"Can I ask a question, I don't think I fully understand it. If you create a pair of entangled photons, and one falls into the black hole... By measuring the one that didn't fall in the black hole you know the spin of the one that did fall right?  Or do they stop being entangled when one photon falls in?"
Physics,39vl7n,b2q,2,Mon Jun 15 16:05:06 2015 UTC,"That's really the crux of the problem. If the entanglement is destroyed when when the photon crosses the horizon, the you have no knowledge of the one that fell in. There are very many arguments for and against the preservation of that entanglement.  The subtlety is the difference between our cosmological horizon, and the horizon of a black hole. At the latter, one can invoke arguments about entropy, thermodynamics, QFT, etc, and use the fact that there exist very strong gravitational fields to preserve that entanglement in a fashion. At the cosmological boundary, no such strong gravitational fields exist, so the arguments about preserving entanglement being to fail."

Physics,39vl7n,sampson158,8,Mon Jun 15 11:17:19 2015 UTC,"The quantum numbers that are entangled are the spin polarisations of the photons. Until a measurement is made, both photons are in an indeterminate state. It is only by measuring the spin of one do you determine the other through the phenomenon of entanglement.  The question is this: is that entanglement preserved when one photon passes over some sort of horizon? That is, if you measure the spin of the photon outside the horizon, do you now have knowledge of the spin of the photon inside the horizon, or is the entanglement destroyed with the act of passing the horizon?  ""Spooky action at a distance"" is not a concept, it's an absurdity, much in the same way that a cat cannot be both alive and dead, which physicists use to reveal the absurdity of rules and laws when taken to extremes. In order to promote 'action at a distance' to a fully fledged concept, you would need to come up with theory to supersede Einstein's relativity, which expressly forbids action at a distance for observable quantum numbers like spin."

You're just somebody who read something about entanglement and now you think your opinions on the matter are valid. But we both know that they are not. I had half a mind to explain what manifolds are and why, when you try to connect two entangled particles across separated manifolds (like across an event or cosmological horizon) you can't even rely on 'spooky action at a distance' anymore. But you're not worth it. You don't want to learn anything new, you just want to feel validated through your hare brained ideas, so I'll save my energy for somebody who actually wants to learn.

I draw my conclusions from the importance of unitarity in quantum field theory and the manifest absence of unitarity in thermodynamics. This question intersects both these disciplines, as well as general relativity. The best clues are coming from the AdS/CFT correspondence (a very well established set of ideas) which incorporates string theory into the mix. It might be possible to preserve entanglement through extra dimensions, so that one Minkowski manifold (our side of the cosmological horizon) is connected to another Minkowski manifold (the other side of that same horizon) but there is no way that the two systems could interact, so there's no way to experimentally verify it, so the information... wherever it is... is lost.  It's good to speculate and theorise one's ideas. I know because I enjoy it too, so much so that I do it for a living. I get paid to do it because I spent 9 years reading about all the constraints one must abide by, learning all the theories that must be subsumed, and practicing all the techniques required to test those ideas. You can either treat /r/physics as a place to learn and expand your knowledge and understanding of the universe, or you can treat as a place to test out your own ideas, both are great ways to go.

Physics,39vl7n,Bubba10000,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:53:46 2015 UTC,"In Quantum Field Theory photons (and everything else) are field quanta. If two photons are ""entangled"", it makes no difference how far apart or where they are; they remain entangled until one or the other is absorbed.  When that happens, if not sooner, they change states or positions simultaneously. Of course this raises about non-locality, even if the distance is only 1 cm.  If I may quote from my book (see quantum-field-theory.net): One of the most troubling aspects of field collapse is that it is instantaneous and occurs at the same time at widely separated points. Physicists call this non-locality. This is especially bothersome when the sudden change involves two entangled field quanta. Einstein argued vehemently against the idea of non-locality, claiming that it violated a result of his Principle of Relativity - that nothing can be transmitted faster than the speed of light. Now Einstein’s postulate (which we must remember was only a guess) is indeed valid in relation to the evolution and propagation of fields as described by the field equations. However field collapse is not described by the field equations, so there is no reason to expect or to insist that it falls in the domain of Einstein's postulate.  Non-locality is a fact; it has been experimentally documented. Nor does it lead to any paradoxes or inconsistencies. Even those who believe in particles as the ultimate reality acknowledge that something happens non-locally. Just as we said, “So the earth is round, not flat; that’s surprising but I can live with it”, so we can say, “Fields suddenly collapse. It’s not what I expected but I can live with it.” There are no logical contradictions involved."

Physics,39xxhd,yangyangR,5,Mon Jun 15 18:22:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the paper. There is a summary posted here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04086  I haven't read this one either but I'll do my best to translate what they say the goals and motivations are based off of what little I know about this area. I'm in math so I can only really speak from that perspective. I'm glossing over some details.  One of the victories of string theory in mathematics has been the conception of D-branes. Given a manifold M, the general idea on how to use D-branes to study M is to consider D-branes to be a submanifold (of any dimension) equipped with additional structure to represent string boundary conditions for open strings ending on that brane (which varies, but typically it is a vector bundle). Once you have chosen a field theory to work in, given two D-branes you get a vector space of quantum states that strings stretching between the two D-branes can be in.  Considering all possible D-branes in a space and all vector spaces of quantum states of strings stretching between them is enough to completely recover the data of the space. This data is given by a category whose objects are D-branes and whose morphism sets are the vector spaces of quantum states between two D-branes. However, this is way too much information and this category is in general uncomputable.  Numerous variations have arisen that simplify this category to be less mysterious (though still only computable in very special cases) and more useful. The most commonly used ones as far as I know come from topological string theory, where there are two simplifications to this category called A-model and B-model. I'm going to avoid saying what those are but I can elaborate if anyone is interested.  This paper seems to offer a new category of branes, using data coming from ""BPS solitons"". ""BPS"" is code for ""most computable aspects of topological string theory"". So it sounds like they have singled out a brane category that naturally only contains ""BPS data"", which is great news because:  ""BPS"" connects string theory to numerous other areas of mathematics. Things like computing knot invariants and enumerative algebraic geometry invariants (Gromov-Witten, Donaldson-Thomas) can be translated into a BPS problem (and probably other things but those are the only ones I'm familiar with). So it sounds like this could be a new background to put BPS problems in that is less artificial than what (I think) people currently do, which is work in the full topological string theory and then zoom in on the BPS portion. This would be a more natural place to work on BPS problems.  Next they mention that they made a 2-category of theories. No idea what that could be about.  And finally they mention categorifying wall-crossing formulae. I don't really know what physicists think about wall-crossing. In math: It's a tool that allows the description of some new types of invariants. Say that you can have an invariant associated to a space that needs some extra structure to be computed. This invariant is piecewise constant as you vary this structure, but suddenly ""jumps"" along some codimension 1 ""walls"" in the moduli space of possible structures. This usually means that your invariant isn't really an invariant of the space since it depends on this extra structure, but some special invariants give you precise formulas on how the invariant changes as you cross these walls. Thus the data of the invariant in one ""chamber"" of the moduli space determines the invariant in all other chambers, and so it actually is a good invariant for your space.  BPS states associated to a space are one such ""invariant"" that exhibits wall-crossing behavior. The way in which knot invariants are encoded in this type of theory is that the walls represent changing the crossing in a knot.  They specifically say ""categorify the wall-crossing formula"". Categorification is a project where you refine invariants by making changes like replacing integers with vector spaces, and relations between integers into morphisms between vector spaces. The classical example is that the homology groups of a space categorify the Euler characteristic (which is the alternating sum of the dimensions of the homology groups). A more modern example is that Khovanov homology categorifies the Jones polynomial. So in general categorification is a good thing - it gets you stronger invariants. It is, of course, more difficult to compute then. So they are categorifying wall crossing formulae somehow. No idea about details beyond that."

Physics,39yz5e,Vallmeister,4,Mon Jun 15 22:49:42 2015 UTC,"Easy: Subjective time depends on how often you create memories of the event you're participating in. These memories could be created when many small and weird events are happening that your brain deems important enough to store or consciously such as when you're bored so your brain kind of ""checks-in"" with the present really frequently. So the more memories your brain is storing, the slower subjective time will flow by for you.  Objective time is even simpler: change. When a particle is changed, time has passed, not the other way around. So if an atom is at absolute zero with no changes happening at all, then time is stopped for that atom. Also, photons are traveling at the speed of light thus aren't traveling through time at all, and therefore can never change or decay.   If you've heard of the heat death, where the universe cools down and time effectively stops, they mean that all the particles in the universe become so cold that no interactions happen, no change. Thus, no time. The same thing can happen on the other end of the energy spectrum. Before the Big Bang, energy density was so high that nothing could interact with anything else because all energy/matter was just overlaid ""on top"" of each other. Again nothing was changing, thus no time. Then a weird thing happened for some reason and sent a cascading effect of change that started time."

The ""standard"" topics (classical mech, E&M, quantum, stat mech -- roughly in that order) are so fundamental that concepts from each one of those areas pop up in almost any area that a physics researcher works in. Furthermore, each of those topics is fundamental in the sense that they each come from a basic set of axioms, without reliance on an external theory.  Fluid mechanics, on the other hand, is ""simply"" the extension of Newton's laws from a particle theory to a field theory. Also, it may be true that the math that you use in fluids is similar to things you'll see in E&M and even GR, but the physical concepts don't necessarily cary over to every other field of physics like the ""standard topics"" do. As such, fluid mechanics is better left to the engineers.  2) It's better taught in conjunction with something else...  Topics from fluid mechanics pop up when you do plasma physics, especially when you get to full MHD, so it's best to save fluids for when you actually need them.

Physics,39yl30,Cataphractoi,2,Thu Jun 18 16:33:20 2015 UTC,"One possible reason, and I could be mistaken, is that in contrast to earlier courses building up background, fourth-year courses tend to focus on different research avenues, e.g. solid state physics, particle physics, etc, and most students don't really go into fluid mechanics research (I mean...I did...but most don't)."

Physics,39rrrn,divinesleeper,3,Sun Jun 14 06:56:37 2015 UTC,It is very difficult to read the penmanship.  It also doesn't help that it's in German.
Physics,39rrrn,dclctcd,9,Sun Jun 14 18:59:12 2015 UTC,"You know, sometimes I wonder if these people who worship Einstein like this ever stop to think if Einstein himself would have done something like this, buying letters for ridiculous amounts of money."
Physics,39rrrn,divinesleeper,13,Sun Jun 14 04:41:47 2015 UTC,"I can't understand your perspective. Do you hold the same superior and negative attitude towards Roman, Greek or Egyptian collections in museums? This letter is just as important as a 2000-year-old sculpture. Museums and private individuals (I'm one of them) are willing to be the temporary caretakers of these artifacts, stewards that will carry them into the future. We make sure that they're conserved properly so that your children, their children and humanity as a whole will be able to appreciate them and learn from them for as long as possible. We're willing to pay for the privilege. What you consider to be ridiculous amounts of money is merely the result of supply and demand. That money isn't lost or wasted."
Physics,39rrrn,dclctcd,-3,Sun Jun 14 08:58:53 2015 UTC,"And where does the demand come from? Why do people want it for themselves rather than have some public museum buy it?  Museums will gladly take care to preserve it and offer it to the public. So why pay more so you can have it? All I can guess is a certain individual sense of pride of possessing it. And yes, I find that odd. Not inferior or negative. Just odd."
Physics,39rrrn,John_Hasler,8,Sun Jun 14 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"Most museums have limited funding and limited display space. More often than not, their store rooms are already full of artifacts that will never be displayed. They can count themselves lucky if all of their inventory is properly catalogued and conserved appropriately. They aren't too keen on spending their limited funds to acquire, conserve and catalogue objects that will never be placed in a display case.  Private collectors are taking extremely good care of the artifacts in their possession since they were purchased with their hard-earned money. There are millions of artifacts on the market and museums simply couldn't take good care of everything. This correspondence for instance would never be displayed in a museum, it isn't poignant enough, but it could be the pride and joy of a private collector. It will make its way back on the market in a few years or decades and if a museum wants it by then, they'll buy it.  How is it odd to want to own and take good care of precious historical artifacts? It's so rewarding to assemble an interesting collection over decades and study it as a whole. Museums don't always have the money and manpower to do this, especially for niche areas of collecting.  It's more and more common for private collectors to display their artifacts online for everyone to see and possibly study. It's also common to loan your most interesting pieces to museums for free. Some collectors even pay for the display cases."
Physics,39rrrn,wrtChase,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:53:18 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't your first paragraph imply that demand is low? You make it sound as if the musea would practically be paying the private collectors to take it off their hands, yet the price is still extraordinarily high.  If that doesn't imply some sort of prestige or individual competition I don't know what does. And there's nothing wrong with that, per se, I just don't buy that it is purely a selfless motivation as you seem to be arguing."
Physics,39rrrn,Eurynom0s,3,Sun Jun 14 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the demand qualifies as low or high, but all you need to drive a price that high is a couple of passionate bidders with deep pockets. Remember that these auction houses cater to an international audience. You're bound to have a few rich people bid on each very interesting artifact, especially since high quality historical artifacts make very good investments. It really is all about supply and demand.  Of course there's prestige in putting together a great collection. I'm proud of mine even though I don't own a single object worth more than $10,000. As I said, it's a very rewarding hobby. It can even make you rich. However, it also does a lot of good for the preservation of the types of artifacts that aren't displayed in museums. The more gratifying aspects don't negate the positive results. I wouldn't spend almost all of my money expanding my collections of ancient and antique sculptures, ancient gold and silver and space-flown artifacts if it didn't bring me great joy."

Nobody studies physics because of external pressure to do so, at least not in my experience. So you don't really run the risk of deceiving someone into studying something they aren't passionate about, and every once in a while, you run across someone that has a predisposition for analysis of the natural world who doesn't realize how much the formal study of physics can benefit them. Those are the people you're trying to convince. I was one of those people and, despite the fact that I loved talking about cosmology and whatnot as a kid, it took some exposure to physics before I really understood that physicists are the people who get really, really into that stuff. It seems so obvious once you're inducted into the culture, but some people just don't realize what we do. That's why we rty to convince people to study physics."

Humanity is about .00000000000000001% of the Universe (not an actual statistic). If you study biology, then what you learn is applicable to all carbon-based life (probably?). This accounts for maybe .0000001% of the Universe. If you study chemistry, then what you learn is applicable to all matter that is in the form of elements in the Universe. This is still a paltry portion of the Universe. If you study physics then what you learn is applicable to all matter and energy in the Universe. Since microscopic quantum fluctuations occur ubiquitously, you can say that physics is applicable to 100% of the Universe.  I don't know if any of this means anything, but this is why I consider physics and mathematics to be the most important subjects."

It seems even more ""universal"".   It's been bothering me lately and I can't defend to myself why physics would be a better to choice to study than mathematics.   When I look at some of the math professors I have they've been able to make contribution to physics (in general relativity areas for one) and yet they are mathematicians.

Physics/a physicist was not needed to invent that area of math.   I'm not saying physicists haven't contributed to math though.  It just doesn't seem to be the case in this specific example.

Physics,39q7fn,Violatic,6,Sun Jun 14 03:01:51 2015 UTC,"The classic math v. physics argument! Nobody's ever going to settle this one.  Physics essentially refers to a set of terms that allow people to exchange and develop ideas about certain facets of the natural world. You can understand basic principles about waves just by watching them, but if you know words like ""wavelenth"" and ""phase"" that have been standardized, you can quickly learn the insights others have had about waves and efficiently collaborate with others to further develop the idea of waves. We build up a vocabulary over time which allows us to all be on the same page regarding pretty elaborate ideas, and as far as I'm concerned, that's physics.  Math is basically the same thing. You can figure out addition pretty well without any help, but if you learn the word other people use for it, they can teach you about multiplication, then exponentiation, then all the crazy shit you can do with those ideas. It's an elaborate set of ideas expressed through a standard vocabulary.  The vocabulary of physics is incomplete without math. We can get by without it initially, but to really develop an idea in physics you have to have math. As far as I'm concerned, this makes math a subset of the vocabulary of physics. Mathematical ideas have to have some basis in physical reality, and when you take the idea far away from its experimental basis, it becomes abstract math. But abstract math nonetheless evolves from physics.  That's my two cents. I'm just praying mathematicians don't read this sub... please be nice when you rip me apart!!"

But abstract math nonetheless evolves from physics.   I'm really lost as to where you draw that conclusion from.  Take number theory and in particular the Goldbach's conjecture for example. I have no idea how you could link that with the physical world or how the physical world could even lead up to that conjecture. That's juts after a few clicks looking around but I'm sure you could find plenty of ideas where they are so far removed that they're isolated and there never was a link from the real world to bring these problems in the first place.   Sure there's some/plenty areas in math where the real world has direct or indirect influences but I'm not quite understanding how you could come up with all of math comes from the real world."

I love physics, I really do, but the amount of misconceptions about maths around here is astounding.  Mathematics is a study of logical curiosities that lead to more curiosities. If we assume such and such, what happens? Physics on the other hand is a study of physical phenomena that lead to models of the physical world. Wait, when I drop something it accelerates, why is this so?    Saying one is sprung from the other is kind of inane, rather, intrinsically Maths will always have some things that apply to Physics because logical curiosities are not exclusive to abstract objects and the other way around the physical world has plenty of logical curiosities."

A physicist is really just using nature to guide his approach to mathematics. Ultimately, if the laws of physics were just random input data that applied only to our universe, then I think physics would be inferior to math. However, I think most physicists feel intuitively that there has to be a deeper truth: that the laws of physics assume their values in the same way that 2 + 2 must equal 4. In other words, no other option can make sense. Assuming this is true, then physics takes on an ""absolute truth"" in the same way as mathematics."

However, it cannot tell you anything fundamental about this or any other universe unless it is used as a tool in service to experimental investigation, which is science.

What I'm arguing and what has been bothering me is that the level of ""truth"" that math offers seems higher.   For example when you read a proof about a lemma (or whatever proof really) It's just true. But for physics you use models which are applicable in certain cases and not in others making it less ""true"". One example I'm thinking about is when you have an object falling towards the ground, with the friction taken into account you have an upward force which is coefficient of friction x velocity2 but that's only for high enough velocities otherwise it doesn't work.   It seems much more messy (perhaps ressembling the real world).   Edit: and this doesn't make physics any less true because then you just use another model but it makes it less ""universal true for all cases absolute truth"" kind of thing. You know what I mean ?"

It's like saying that probability distributions are the required way to model knowledge and uncertainty under fairly mild assumptions (i.e. bayesian probability), whether the world is actually stochastic or deterministic. Their point is that QBism doesn't claim that other interpretations are not true, merely that the wavefunction does not require or even seriously motivate it, and some other interpretations are doing the equivalent of acting like probability theory requires probability distributions to be actual external objects purely because you have to frame the discussion in terms of them. It is an interpretation, but if you're going to give a description of QM that's as agnostic as possible (which is of course not entirely agnostic, but that's inevitable) that seems like a good way to do it."

There are real chemicals and/or molecules in the soil, which enter the plant through its roots, these nutrients are real things which travel through the plant to the leaves and so on.  I dont think that this is ""just"" a predictive model, I think that this is in some sense an accurate desctiption of reality.   Why do we suddenly hesistate to assign the same ""realness"" to quantum mechanics when both are confirmed by the same process (rigerous experimentation)?

Physics,39rhki,NeverMindTheQuestion,7,Sun Jun 14 01:15:37 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, that's one route for developing relativistic QM. Since in a Lorentz covariant theory, time and space need to be treated on the same footing, you can either promote time to an operator or demote the spatial coordinates to parameters. The latter option is what you do in quantum field theory, where the fields become the basic operators, defined as functions on the spacetime coordinates. The former option is the starting point for covariant quantization in string theory.  There are some potential problems with a time operator. Particularly, there's an argument, apparently due to Pauli, that with a time operator obeying the appropriate canonical commutation relation [T,H] = -iħ, the energy of a system can't be bounded from below (i.e., it implies negative energy states). I've seen a couple statements to the effect that that basically just amounts to a limit on the possible accuracy of time measurement, but I haven't worked through any of the details, personally.  Here's a paper on it that proposes such an operator in relativistic QM and mentions some possible applications (I haven't read more than the abstract, so not sure how relevant it will be). This article about the time-energy uncertainty relation touches on the question, as well."

Because I'm dealing with non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the first paper doesn't seem to be relevant, but I'm excited to take a look at the second article.    Particularly, there's an argument, apparently due to Pauli, that with a time operator obeying the appropriate canonical commutation relation [T,H] = -iħ, the energy of a system can't be bounded from below (i.e., it implies negative energy states).   I haven't checked [t,H] = -ihbar, but I'm pretty sure it does not hold in my algebra because the time operator is written, simply, [; \int |t \rangle t \langle t| dt ;]  Only the Schroedinger Equation relates t and H (they're not automatically defined as canonical conjugates because t is just what it is and H is a free hermitian operator), and I don't immediately see any way to derive the canonical commutation relation from the Schroedinger Equation.  However, my algebra contains a left and right inverse to each partial derivative operator, so from the Schroedinger Equation [; i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} = \hat H ;], I do get the following 2 relationships.  [; H \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\frac{\partial t}{\partial}} = i\hbar ;] and [; \vec{\frac{\partial t}{\partial}} H = i\hbar ;]  x and p have a similar relationship, but it differs by a sign.  [; \vec{\frac{\partial x}{\partial}} p = -i\hbar ;] and [; p \stackrel{\leftarrow}{\frac{\partial x}{\partial}} = -i\hbar ;]  So the difference in sign makes me think that t and H are not canonical conjugates."

Their argument is completely general, assuming only that observables are self-adjoint operators acting on a Hilbert space. Trying to add relativity won't save the situation. Usually, the ""way out"" is to try to consider time as an unobservable parameter, and use some form of ""general covariance"", then quantize the system as a gauge system. But then the Hamiltonian is a constraint, and time-evolution is a gauge transformation. See Henneaux and Teitelboim, Quantization of Gauge Systems, the chapter on general covariance."

Physics,39nycn,iorgfeflkd,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:56:09 2015 UTC,"No those are different lasers.  They're description of laser cooling seems a little bit off.

The voltage drop caused by excess electron space charge will inevitably shield the potential between the electron emitting cathode and the anode. Doing some back-of-envelope calculations, at density high enough for the plasma to be Beta = 1, the electron injection potential would have to be 10-100 times the plasma potential.  As I recall, the original spindle cusps researched in the 1960s were found to be only viable with shock heating, and this only differs in field geometry."

Physics,39ldy7,SirBootySnatcher,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:47:09 2015 UTC,"I think you mean pulsed, as opposed to steady state (constant)?  Off the top of my head I'm not certain of any fundamental physics that necessitates a pulsed system being less efficient than a steady state one aside from the energy investment needed to alter the magnetic field. As the diamagnetic plasma excludes the field, energy is stored in the magnetic field (as magnetic field line tension). In a pulsed system this energy must be expended for each shot-- hard to say how significant that is to the overall energy balance though. From an engineering perspective there's a number of downsides to pulsed operation: Power loss to eddy currents being a major one, as well as non-constant structural loads.  None of that is to say that a device like this would be fundamentally better in steady state than pulsed. Some things like ash removal and vacuum pumping could be much easier, in fact. I mention it only because as I understand it the Polywell experiments to date have been pulsed only because pulsed power supplies are vastly cheaper at the subject power levels, and the intention is to build large steady state devices if funding is available.  The fact that there was no plasma potential measurable in this experiment seems to support my concern that anode shielding is an issue."

For several decades the question of the Higgs Field's existence was the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics and ""the central problem in particle physics"".   The presence of this field, now believed to be confirmed, explains why some fundamental particles have mass when, based on the symmetries controlling their interactions, they should be massless.

Physics,39kvdz,nikofeyn,3,Sat Jun 13 04:24:29 2015 UTC,"i asked the following question in a post that got removed. i was looking for a quantum mechanics book that is closest in spirit to the recent quantum field theory for the gifted amateur book. i'll leave the details of the post, the only comment, and my response since i feel they have some useful discussion.   I am a mathematician with some physics background looking for the best quantum mechanics book. Note that I'm not necessarily looking for a quantum mechanics book that hammers on the math. Looking at the book Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur, it looks fantastic, and I like the style and approach from reading the first few chapters, which covers material I am familiar with. But the text quickly moves beyond my knowledge of quantum mechanics and particle theory. Griffiths is a pretty good book, which is what I used in my quantum mechanics course back in the day. I haven't read his particle book yet. Any suggestions of a book that is fresh and really cuts to the core of quantum mechanics and particle theory as the quantum field theory book does? Are Griffiths book's my best bet? Or maybe Feynman's lectures?  I have some good special relativity books in the texts by Tevian Dray and N.M.J. Woodhouse that I'm going to be going through.  Thanks!   /u/Snuggly_Person had this helpful response prior to the thread being removed:   I like Shankar. It covers a similar collection of topics as Griffiths (as do most intro QM books), but I think in better logical order. Like QFTftGA, it starts out at classical mechanics, makes sure the foundations are in place, and logically builds QM up from there, rather than postulating something and leaving its connections to other physics until later. It ends you off at fermionic path integrals and connections to statistical physics, which dovetails nicely with the stuff you get to about halfway through the QFT book.  I also like Asher Peres' Quantum Theory: Concepts and Methods, which tries to take as careful of a logical and experimental approach as possible; motivating some basic logical postulates from experimental results, and trying to show how the mathematical structure emerges from it. I'm not sure I would use it for a first QM book (and Shankar contains a similar discussion anyway), but it helped get a bunch of pieces to fit together for me. I'd also recommend a dash of quantum computing to be honest; that really amounts to ""finite quantum systems"", which are easier to pick apart in detail. Plus the emphasis in most quantum computing books is much more strongly on what logically separates QM from classical physics, emphasizing underlying concepts of tracking information and entanglement over involved solutions to PDEs and perturbation theory.   and here was my response to that comment:   hell yes. thank you so much for beating the mods, as they removed my post. the peres book looks exactly like the thing i was searching for. your comments and this amazon review seal the deal. i recall enough of the basics of quantum and know enough math that i feel i should be okay moving through it. the ""innovative"" and modern approach is right up the alley of what i had in mind and what the qft for the gifted amateur seems to provide.  thanks again!"

The exercises in the third edition are a subset of those of the second edition. The second edition cites a lot more books in the text, and at the end of each chapter has an annotated bibliography for specific topics related to the content in the chapter.

And people seem to be worrying away about such bounces causing enormously energetic events which we don't see, or perhaps we do see, or whatever, and why are there objects which smell like black holes if black holes can't form and so on.  But if such a bounce happens, then presumably it happens pretty close to the horizon (or where the horizon would be if there was one).  In other words it happens at a really huge redshift for any distant observer, and hence extremely slowly.  So no vast energetic event for any distant observer: in fact the thing looks pretty much the same as it would if it wasn't bouncing."

I recall a well-written post saying to think carefully about why you want to do string theory, but not necessarily to avoid it. If you're interested in the mathematical structure underlying physics it might be up your alley. A lot research in high energy theory involves some application of ""stringy"" concepts even if it's not string theory per se (e.g. early universe cosmology, black hole information theory/firewalls, applications of holography etc).  The other big area is condensed matter physics, either in terms of solid state physics or quantum information theory, or some combination. A lot of people in this area are starting to focus on energy applications (like solid state physics of photovoltaics, which is nontrivial), which might be your thing if you're worried about applicability. Personally I study biophysics and soft condensed matter and there's a lot of developing theoretical work that didn't really exist 10 years ago.  What you're asking is almost too broad a question to answer. There's lots of interesting stuff out there, it's a matter of finding what's right for you."

What are some areas of high energy theory where one could pursue string theory type math-intensive work without it actually being considered string theory?

If you are interested in the challenges of particle theory there is no reason why CM doesn't offer as much if not more mathematical and physical breadth and depth. Besides, good physics ideas are often surprisingly universal, and undoubtedly a large number of them come from condensed matter.  I often argue successfully to the PT's I go to school with that you have a better shot at making an impact in particle physics if you work with condensed matter systems. Of course there are people who are more rigid in their ways, but I like to think that good physicists have broad curiosity.  Either way(CMT or PT), you're going to get really good at effective field theories, but with CM you don't have your constants handed to you by god, you can get them from the chemist down the hall..."

It's not well funded and has little application when you leave school. That said, you can pick up other important skills while you're at school (e.g. statistics and machine learning), and your physics background will look pretty good on a resume in those areas.   Honestly, you should pick a field that is well represented at your school. You will probably do very poorly working on ""your own thing"" without a lot of guidance and more importantly a community of people working on the same topic to flesh out ideas with. Even if  you find a very important result, without the backing of some respected researchers, no one will give your paper the thought it deserves. My advice is that you forget about ""what's hot"" in general and focus on what's going on in your immediate area. That's how you'll learn the fastest and contribute most strongly.

Physics,39ftar,PhononMagnon,3,Thu Jun 11 21:29:55 2015 UTC,"As per usual I am late, so I would reiterate that condensed matter is an option. It doesn't have to computational, but can be quite mathematical. I would say about half of condensed matter theory is geared towards computational and the other half geared towards mathematical models that capture the essential physics (e.g. something like the anderson impurity model). My feeling is funding for these is not as good as the computational side but certainly better than in string theory.   Some examples I can think of  Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT) uses the exact same methodology as Quantum Field Theory (QFT), i.e. Feynman diagrams to calculate properties of materials. In some ways it's more rigorous as there is physical motivation for cut-offs of divergent integrals. Heck even in Chemisty, they have a form of Feynman diagrams for non-linear optics.  You want new particles, well in CM there are quasi-particles: excitons, plasmons, polarons, polaritons, dropletons, phonons, skymions, just to name a few.   Often there is overlap with the high energy side, e.g. The Casimir force, usually thought of as a QFT problem, shows up in nanodevices, or the band-structure of graphite or some topological insulators looks like the Dirac cone, or the Kondo effect is similar to asymptotic freedom.   I would say, take a look at a MBPT textbook like many-particle physics by Mahan and see if looks ok."

Obviously the most important thing is to find a topic which is exciting to you, or else grad school will be miserable.  If string theory is what excites you, go for it.  It's not that there is definitively no future in it, we just need the next breakthrough.  Another area getting A LOT of attention from the theory community is supersymmetry.  To me this is definitely the ""hot"" area at the moment, especially with the LHC having just started up at a new energy.  The LHC should be able to test many of the SUSY models being put out there, so this is one of the exciting times where theory will have feedback from experiment.  As far as a long term plan, I think what you are looking for is the Snowmass report (this is the executive summary, but there are white papers on all of the individual topics as well).

I know the first step is emailing potential supervisors, but is it too early to be doing this now? I was thinking I'd get on top of it when I have time to do it properly now rather than when term comes again and they're bombarded. Also, when they make no specific to projects available on their homepages/group websites, should I contact them anyway?   I was thinking that my email will include a basic intro section, followed by an explanation of what I'm interested in relevant to their groups, and close with asking if they might have any projects available next year and whether we could talk more about them.  I know I might be overthinking this, but I don't want to do something now that makes a bad impression and affects my application if I come to make one- I know also they're very busy people and I don't want to waste their time!

Over the past (almost) 2 years, I haven't been able to land a job. I've been really lenient with what I'm willing to do but I can't seem to catch a break. Part of the reason (I think) is because as an undergrad I did astrophysics research. Not really practical when it comes to 9-5 jobs out of college. So I figured instead of beating my head against the wall some more, I could come ask you guys for some advice. I'm ready to get back to doing good science so I'm studying for my GRE that I'm taking in October. Then I'm looking to apply to graduate schools for the Fall 2016 semester.

I recall reading that Einstein tried to, unsuccessfully, describe EM as a curved space geometry.  However, you might be interested in the Kaluza-Klein theory in which GR is formulated in 5D with the cylinder condition and 4D GR along with Maxwell's equations are recovered."

Physics,39ej09,sirbruce,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:15:26 2015 UTC,I agree with you.  Although there's probably nothing that says inertial and gravitational mass HAVE to be the same... but you get rather exotic behavior when they are not.
Physics,39ej09,diazona,4,Thu Jun 11 11:18:41 2015 UTC,"In quantum theory, electromagnetism comes from the variation of the relativistic vector potential (A) with position. So if you had some way to incorporate the vector potential into the definition of a reference frame, maybe you could see it as a fictitious force. But that's not easy, and might be a dead end anyway. I think some people are working on it though.  Realistically, I'd say no, because you don't have anything like the equivalence principle for electromagnetism. Like other comments said."
Physics,39ej09,someawesomeusername,3,Thu Jun 11 13:40:43 2015 UTC,"Yes it is, the Kaluza Klein theory is just that. If you introduce one more compact dimension, then it is possible to reproduce Maxwells equations using just a geometrical construction. In this theory, we live in a 5 dimensional world, four of these dimensions are the usual dimensions corresponding to space and time. The fifth dimension is circular and small, which is why we don't see it. We do however see its effects of this fifth dimension, which is responsible for the EM interactions between particles.  A review can be found here."
Physics,39ej09,NoetherFan,2,Sat Jun 13 19:07:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say no. The intuition behind gravity as a fictitious force is that there exist spacetime paths along which any object moves in the absence of non-gravitational forces, regardless of their mass. This is due to the equality of inertial and gravitational masses removing a degree of freedom from gravitational interactions as compared to electric."

Physics,39h3cm,hopffiber,7,Thu Jun 11 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"So, people are sort of dodging your question, possibly because they don't understand how it would work in a quantum theory. In the language of a quantum theory of gravity with gravitons, the gravitational force exerted by a black hole would be mediated through what some people call ""virtual gravitons"", and others call a disturbance in the graviton field. These virtual gravitons/field disturbances do not have to travel as real, actual particles (like an electron or a photon), since they aren't in fact particles at all. Thus, they can ""escape"" a black hole.  An actual, real graviton (which would exist as well, just as we have both real photons, as well as virtual photons which exerts the EM force) would indeed be caught in the gravity of a black hole and be unable to escape it."
Physics,39h3cm,John_Hasler,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:22:25 2015 UTC,"From what I understand of the Hawking theory, a virtual particle becomes ""real"" (apologies for all the quotes, but I am using a lot of imprecise language) once separated from its antiparticle partner (the one trapped inside the event horizon), thus the radiation created by this process is indistinguishable from ""regular"" radiation. I'm not familiar enough with graviton theory to know if it has an ""anti-particle"" partner.  What is the pathway for virtual graviton production in the theory you are describing?"
Physics,39h3cm,PhysicsToday,7,Thu Jun 11 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"Hawking radiation isn't very relevant to the discussion, honestly. The picture of how it works that you describe is very heuristic and not to be taken too literally: that it happens is a result of an involved computation in QFT on curved spacetime with a horizon. Sure, among the radiated particles (which are real particles), there will (probably) be gravitons, but those are not the ones that exerts the gravitational force from the black hole. For one thing, the heavier the black hole becomes, the less it radiates, whilst of course its gravitational pull gets stronger. As I wrote, the force is exerted by virtual gravitons; which do not obey the same equations of motion as regular particles, since they aren't particles at all but rather fluctuations/deformations of the field. Oh, and gravitons are their own anti-particles, just like photons."
Physics,39h3cm,John_Hasler,6,Thu Jun 11 20:51:23 2015 UTC,"The gravitons don't come from inside the black hole any more than the photons come from inside the electron.  Mass is a property of the black hole itself, not of something inside it."

Even if we haven't really figured out quantum gravity, it is quite inescapable that there are gravitons, at least effectively at some scale (since quantized GR is still a valid effective field theory at low energies)."
Physics,39h3cm,hopffiber,6,Thu Jun 11 20:26:19 2015 UTC,"Entropic gravity is sort of dead, though, and for good reasons. Even Erik Verlinde, the guy who made it popular a few years ago and got a big grant for developing it, doesn't work on it anymore (in fact, it looks like he only wrote the one paper on it). The main reason is, as far as I understand it, that the theory has big problems in how any entropic force can't be properly reversible, which would mess up quantum coherence. But when you study how gravity effects quantum systems, you find that it has an effect on the quantum system but that it doesn't break coherence (eg. by studying interference patterns of neutrons in a gravitational field). This experimental result thus promptly shoots down the whole idea, as explained in http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5414 . I don't think entropic gravity proponents had any sensible answer to this simple argument, and thus the idea sort of died.   And even in entropic gravity, there are still gravitons, even if they aren't fundamental but rather some effective description."

The site you linked does not include any of the relevant data (actually there is no data at all), meaning there is no way to see whether they even accomplished what they claim. Also, since high-frequency radio waves propagate much like light, it is safe to assume that wearing a hat on top of your head still will not do a lot against anything not strictly above you.  I would suggest you save your money, since it has been shown over and over again that RF is not harmful in any way (save for multi-kilowatt transmitters that will just induce an undesirable amount of local heating - an effect that is not strictly limited to RF). You will need to worry more that you might drop your camera on your foot.  I suppose questions like yours arise because there is no widespread awareness that RF and ionizing radiation (X-ray, gamma) are two totally different phenomenons at opposite ends of the electromagnetic spectrum.

I guess the idea is that since your camera is directly to the right of your head the sides of the hat should work to reflect it too--although since some would sneak in under the right side it would therefore go through the skull and reflect back from the left side of the hat going through the skull once more.  It's a very common concern since these transmitters are inches away-- and the uneducated notion is proximity is the biggest issue.  (some video transmitters are microwave as well)  But I appreciate your link and advice that this form of radiation is unharmful so I shouldn't worry about it to begin with!

I know a bit about it.   As I said, machine learning systems (like Watson) aren't even close to being able to do this kind of thing. One issue is that the questions are too open-ended. Even something seemingly simple like item #2, counting ""every statement that is widely agreed on to be false,"" is too vague for a system like Watson.   If you give it a specific statement and ask it to determine whether it's true or false, and if it's been suitably trained on the problem domain, it could do pretty well. But it can't go through an arbitrary text like this ad and pick out the things that count as ""statements"" for the purpose of the Crackpot Index.  You could, of course, predigest the ad and provide Watson with suitably structured input that was extracted from the ad. That would help it reach valid conclusions on some of the more concrete items.

The lost energy in Bismuth-210 to Polonium-210 is 1.16MeV, which this swell guy states is equal to the sum of the mass-energy of an electron (0.511MeV), plus the kinetic energy of the electron (supposed to be 0.649MeV). Observations of the energy or momentum of beta-decay electrons showed that the distribution lied below (or equal to) the calculated values, showing that there must be a particle carrying the excess momentum. The fact that some observations found the electron energy to be measurably 'equal' to the calculated excess energy meant that the particle needed to have mass orders of magnitude below that of an electron, and would thus have to have very high velocities when 'carrying' the energy excess.   So the author of this article ignored the fact that observed values of electron energy/momentum were distributed below the theorised maximum, which is the origin of the necessity of the electron neutrino? Ignoring any observational data, the author's statements on this specific topic are logical, I think?"

Physics,39biy4,broodwich87,12,Wed Jun 10 17:20:06 2015 UTC,"First thing I'll say is physics is hard, I don't know anyone that finds it easy and there isn't anyone who hasn't felt lost at some point during a physics degree. As it sounds like you're taking an intro class, I think the issue you're having is the approach to solving problems, i.e. how to write a word/situational problem as a mathematical problem that you can then solve. Try following the worked exampes step by step, to the letter, see if you can identify the method, then after a few of these try and apply the same method to an unseen problem. Once you get the ball rolling, grind them out until its intuitive, and you should find the whole process a lot easier.   Alternatively/additionally, if you can't solve an unseen problem or can't follow the method for a worked one, the friendly chaps over at /r/AskPhysics are unbelievably helpful, and I'd be more than happy to look at some problems and help as well if you want to pm me."

Physics,39biy4,NonAbelianOstrich,10,Thu Jun 11 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"There are a few things that I've noticed that trip up new students, so I've come up with a checklist of things to note for my students.  First thing, you are not going to learn physics by just reading the textbook or looking at examples. To actually learn physics you need to work out problems yourself. My tip here is to play with the problem parameters once you've solved it, so what happens when you increase/decrease mass, velocity, energy, force, acceleration, etc.  The second thing to keep in mind, do not plug in any numbers until the end of the problem. Keep everything in symbolic form until the end. It will help you to identify any mistakes that may happen, it also makes it much easier for the TA or instructor to award partial credit and pointers if your solution is wrong.  Third thing, write down everything you know about the problem from the given values and clearly label them, for example: a_car1 = acceleration of car 1 = 60 mph/10 sec. This makes the next part of my tips easier which is,  Fourth, identify what you do not know or what is not given. So if you know the mass and acceleration of a projectile, make sure you note that you don't know the initial velocity of the projectile. This helps identify how to get to the unknown that the question is asking.  Fifth thing, all numbers absolutely need units. Attaching units to your numbers will allow you to catch a lot of your mistakes, and helps with the 6th thing.  Sixth thing, know the units and dimensions of all the properties that you are working with. You absolutely need to know that momentum is mass * length / time, or p = mv. This is another thing that will help you catch a lot of your mistakes and even help you get to the answer, if you are writing something like 1 sec + 1 kg you can immediately say that what you've written down is wrong. You cannot add or subtract different dimensions, it doesn't make sense to add a mass and velocity together; you can, however, multiply and divide different dimensions.   Seventh thing, draw diagrams of what is going on and label all of your diagrams. Most of your diagrams in the first semester should end up being free body diagrams, label all of the forces with the proper vectors (direction and magnitude). It is here where the problem solving really starts. You need to make sure that you can identify any and all forces.   Eight thing, once you have your knowns and unknowns identified and labeled, your diagram drawn, and your vectors labeled you can begin to solve your problem. Ask yourself what laws or concepts can be used to fill out your unknowns? Remember that energy is conserved, momentum is conserved, the sum of all your forces equal to mass * acceleration, and that forces perpendicular to each other will not affect each other; a force in the x-direction will not cause an acceleration in the y- or z-directions.  Last (and most important thing), attend your TA and/or professor's office hours. The office hours are there to help students with learning the material. For some reason a lot of students won't go to OH even when they're struggling. Don't be afraid of asking your teacher questions. If you can't make the posted office hours, ask for an appointment."
Physics,39biy4,tikael,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:50:37 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's a lot of advice, lol!  But I'll try to keep this stuff in mind while studying and doing problems.

Physics,39biy4,NonAbelianOstrich,5,Thu Jun 11 03:27:43 2015 UTC,"But when I do some of the problems, I just seem to blank on them.   Doing problems is where the real learning happens, reading the textbook and notes doesn't really do much. The problem is by reading alone, you never identify what the holes are in your understanding. Are there example problems with worked solutions in the textbook and notes? Try and do one without looking at the solution. You will get stuck somewhere, that's the whole point, it tells you what you don't understand. Look at the solution and see the next step, then cover it up and keep going. Do this until you can do the whole problem by yourself. If you do this for enough problems, eventually the general methods should start to sink in.  With the problem sets, try and have a go at them. Look over the example questions and see if any are similar and try and adapt the method. If that doesn't work then go talk to the lecturer. Explain your thought process so far and they will be happy to point you towards what you are missing. Studying in groups is also great, so long as everyone is on the same level, and you don't have someone who is on the ball blazing through and you not having to do any learning."

Of course things like General Relativity (GR), quantum field theory, and statistical mechanics are necessities. I’ll list what I wish I was better at now, as a good guide for what are important tools for a theoretical cosmologist. On the theory side, differential forms and other formal techniques in GR, as well as supergravity to understand string models. I think Bayesian statistics isn’t taught in enough detail at an undergraduate level. This is the key tool in modern cosmology. Good coding practice is very important: learn a language like python and learn how to use high performance computing. Don’t think statistics and computing are something that, as a theorist, you can ignore! You’ll be left behind without them. Finally, don’t neglect presentation style. If your work looks good and reads well, people pay more attention.  Choose an institution and PhD advisor that you can get along with.

The only retro-causality you ""see"" is if you insist on applying a realist interpretation of quantum mechanics, and even then the retro-causality doesn't actually apply to any empirical phenomena, it applies only on the level of interpretation. In other words, the very least this proves (which we've known for a while and of which this experiment is another illustration of) is that when it comes to quantum mechanics breaks local realism, as in you can't have both locality and realism together. The key point then is not that we have just achieved retro-causality, but that insisting on realism when choosing an interpretation of quantum mechanics forces you to give up on locality, but again purely on the interpretive level and in no way would this non-locality (even if realism was the correct path to interpreting quantum mechanics) transfer to any observable quantities. This isn't a particularly troubling thing at this point in the game given that, for a number of reasons I won't get into here, not many physicists still hold onto realism, and so very few people think that non-locality is actually a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, rather than just an interpretive artifact when trying to apply our everyday intuitions (realism) to quantum phenomena."

Additionally, where there is an antinode for displacement (as you see at the open end), there will be a node for the pressure (i.e. zero pressure fluctuation). This is always the case: antinodes for displacement are nodes for pressure and vise versa. And so, in short, ""because it just does"".  There's a writeup on it on hyperphysics I believe.

Physically, this isn't quite what happens.  Consider the air molecules right at the center of the end of the tube. Since they're far away from the tube walls, they have no idea where the walls end, so they can't ""know"" to satisfy the boundary condition. In fact, what actually happens is that there isn't an antinode at the end of the tube; it's actually slightly past the end.

I just wanted to add an aside on the string example. If you take a string that has one end attached to a straight rod or bar (with negligible friction), so that it's allowed to move freely up and down at that end, a standing wave will have an antinode at that end instead of a node, analogous to the open-ended tube. The boundary conditions are a bit trickier to think about (you can think about it in terms of a reflected wave, and conditions relating the incident and reflected waves at the boundary), but the mathematical description is basically the same (both described by the wave equation)."

With those three you get a fairly small choice of possible transformations.  With one more:   the speed of light is constant in all frames;   the Lorentz transformation is uniquely specified.

An example might be something like treating the Lorentz group as not the proper full group,  but instead as a q-deformed Hopf Algebra. In all reasonable limits, the deformation parameter should be close to 1, indicating that we are in the regime of the familiar Sl(2,C), but perhaps on quantum gravity scales where we know less about isotropy of space and the many assumptions that go into the former proof of linearity, the group might become deformed to yield a different structure.   There are other theories, like doubly special relativity,  but for the most part there are massively high constraints from experiment which largely rule out the 'quick and dirty' modifications, so immense care and reasoning is often needed to justify these things (if it can be justified at all)."

This paper here beautifully explains that local gauge symmetry can never be spontaneously broken and it is the global phase symmetry that gets broken. How? as far I understand, we change the vector potential and correspondingly the phase in order to preserve the gauge invariance during a local gauge transformation. However, in case of global gauge symmetry, only the phase changes (independent of time) and is thus not invariant. So that is the way I see it to put it briefly.

(Your paper cites Elitzur in the intro when stating the gauge symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken).  Another argument is that gauge ""transformations"" do not label symmetries, but are actually a redundancy in the description of your system. For example, you can have global symmetries which take your state to another state, U|a> = |b> where <b|a> = 0, but this is impossible under a gauge transformation, which can't change the physical states.

Well, I'm very lay in this things. A car moves a 60 Km/h in relation to the ground. So, if nothing can go faster than light speed, is light speed in relation to what? Also, Earth is moving, so in relation to Earth, you could go faster than light in one direction, and could not reach it in another, depending on which side your ship is pointing to in orbit around earth? Exemple: You are driving a car at 50 Km/h, then you shoot a gun forward. The speed of the bullet is 300 Km/h, so now it is 350 Km/h. But let's assume light speed is 300 Km/h, so the bullet cannot pass this speed. You shoot, and the bullet reaches 300 Km/h, but in relation to your car, it is 250Km/h, it can't go any faster, but for you, it still could go. Now you shoot backward, to the other direction. The bullet reaches 250 Km/h in relation to the ground, but for you, it is at 300 Km/h. Lets say that the bullet have some propellant and can accelerate. Than it reaches 300 Km/h in relation to the ground, but for you, it is now at 350 km/h, faster than ligh! Ok, my head bugged, but I think that this reasoning is right.

And not all the particles that are accelerated are ever actually collided. And of the collisions that do occur, most of the data is promptly discarded.  Moreover, the protons in the LHC don't start at rest, they come from a sequence of smaller particle accelerators.  As for your actual question, how to get more energy in the particles for less electricity from the power plant, they would probably want to make a number of changes that would significantly alter their abilities to do physics. First, you would want to turn off the detectors (immediately there is no way to do physics) and turn off all the higher order magnets (they keep the beam tight and narrow for higher luminosity). You might want to changing the bunching structure, although I'm not sure if that would help any. Finally, because of the large amount of energy lost to synchrotron losses, you would want to just turn off the whole thing and only operate a very low energy accelerator and dump the beam as soon as it got up to maximum energy."

Remember that protons are not fundamental particles so you can't tune them to the on shell resonances of, say, the W, Z or the Higgs. A lepton machine would do that and there is discussion of building such a machine. It goes under various names of the likes of ""International Linear Collider"" (ILC) and so on. I am not sure what its present state is, but obviously they would want to be able to make a 125 GeV Higgs on shell. There is no analog for this for hadrons because of pdfs."

Physics,395ony,jazzwhiz,2,Tue Jun 9 19:04:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, because you can tune leptons, which are fundamental particles, to the energy to create the desired particle on-shell, which is when it has the greatest probability of being created (not necessarily actually a large probability).  The LHC accelerates protons and heavy nuclei. Each are made of partons: quarks and gluons. The LHC actually collides the partons, and each parton carries part of the energy of the total hadron. So when you are colliding at 13 TeV energy, you actually get, say 2 TeV of actually usable energy. Moreover, the energy in each collision is random and given by the pdfs (parton distribution functions) which are experimentally fit functions to the fractional momentum that each parton holds."

I understand water compresses only negligibly and that water pressure at depth is a result of the weight of the water above a point.  My question has to do with what happens if you lower a very strong, sturdy tank into the ocean depths, with a door attached. When you open the door, the water pressure inside is equal to that outside. Now, what happens to the pressure when you close the door again? Does it drop or remain the same? Intuitively, I would say it stays the same, but my question is, if the water itself has not compressed very much, what is responsible for the pressure inside the tank, assuming there are no trapped gases.

Is the entire setup inside a sort of Faraday cage, or am I misrememberimg how magnetic fields work?   When can we probably expect significant (proving/disproving supersymmetry/standard model, etc.) discoveries in the future? Months, a couple years, decades? How long will LHC run at 13 TeV?   This is really more of a discussion thing, but how close do you think humanity really is to finding a grand unified theory? Could it happen soon?  Should a person with a powerful rig be compelled to run LHC at home? Is the benefit that much better for them than mining for cryptocurrency?

Physics,395njc,Javis_,2,Tue Jun 9 17:30:01 2015 UTC,"Whilst the magnets used are extremely powerful for magnets they are no where near so powerful that they could affect the earth. The LHC dipole magnets have a maximum strength of 8.3T (Tesla) which is just 3-4x the strength of a typical MRI machine or half the strength needed to levitate a frog. The strongest continuous magnetic field produced in a labratory is actually 45T and the largest instantaneous field was 2800T (which required destroying the equipment in the process!).  So yes, they are powerful magnets but they are well within the bounds of what we understand and know to be safe. If that doesn't convince you, remember that magnetic fields decay at a rate of 1/r3 so assuming the field is 8T at 1m away (massive overestimate since the magnetic field is directional) then at 2m (around the size of the tunnel) the field would be a significantly smaller 1T.      Any significant early discoveries are likely to be made public early next year. Whilst for many theoretical models the increase in energy makes the new particles easier to spot we still require enough data for the searches to have comparable sensitivity to the run 1 searches and that is likely to require the whole year's data. In addition, there's a large amount of internal review which goes on for any result and this is likely to be significantly more stringent for anything claiming evidence of a new particle which would delay the announcement of anything publicly. For later discoveries.... I don't have any idea (and I don't think anyone else does), if there's something there we will hopefully find it within a couple of years, if not (or if it's very hard to spot) it could be decades or never :(          We plan to run at 13TeV for this year and hopefully move to full design energy of 14TeV next year. This will then be the energy for the rest of the LHC's lifespan, so early 2030s, barring any clever sods figuring out ways to bump the energy by small amounts.       I have genuinely no idea how long till we find a GUT (or even if), without more experimental evidence of physics beyond the standard model we can't even begin to narrow down the field of thousands (if not millions) of models which might provide the stepping stones to such a theory.      Obviously people shouldn't be compelled to run LHC@Home! To be honest though, how much benefit are you likely to gain from mining bitcoins these days? Certaintly an order of magnitude less than the electricity costs. For hardward, I genuinely have no idea..."

There are many detector specific details for every experiment that have been painstakingly explored and included in any internal analysis, but all of those details are usually not presented. For example, it is not uncommon for some electronics to go down during an experiment thus not only changing its effective area, but doing so in a non-isotropic fashion. Another example is the measurement of backgrounds and noise in the detector. The list goes on and on, which is why collaborations have many people and their analyses can usually not be exactly reproduced by interested third parties.  Of course, I am one of those interested third parties. I make sure that the data I'm taking is largely independent of any such systematics, or I carefully account for them in my error analysis.

On top of that, the simulations have to be analyzed by custom written codes that students and post docs spend careers building. Everything from the generation of initial conditions to handling the data is at the ""Prace"" level (Google Prace if you don't know what it is). On top of that, these huge simulations are often made public- placing such data sets on public databases is highly non trivial and usually requires full time computationally minded IT support staff that work in close contact with the physicists.

The equations of QCD are then solved on this lattice numerically. However, things like putting fermions (quarks) on the lattice is an extremely nontrivial and unsolved problem. This is also extremely computationally expensive. This calculations run on the largest supercomputers in the world and large collaborations exist because of the complexity and intensity of these calculations. These problems are highly amenable to massive parallelization, and GPU clusters are used by many groups. This field took a while to get ""interesting"", as it had to wait for computers to get better, but now we're at a place where the best studies of things like elements of mixing matrices in the standard model, masses of highly exotic hadrons, the phase transition temperature for quark deconfinement, etc come from the lattice. Many people do PhDs in lattice gauge theory and then go work for tech companies (even designing super computers), and it's also possibly the only sub area of high energy theory (aside from dark matter) that's actually growing."

OP said he wants to send a rocket there; this isn't a thought experiment.  I'm curious about OP's physics background.

Traveling at the speed of New Horizons (58,536 km/h) it would take around 27 million years to arrive there.  Unless you have one hell of a plan to speed up the ship or freeze yourself you aren't going to be around to see the data start to come back (which is an additional 1500 years after the ship reaches the black hole anyways).  I'm not even certain we could ever successfully pull off a shot of that accuracy, to not deviate from it's path by more than maybe a couple micrometers per second of the trip."

That is, we can only go forward in time.  However, this does not necessarily mean that there is no other definition of time. Our current definition of time, and time's arrow, is a result of the big bang and the universe in which we live. There may exist a definition of time which does not depend upon the speed of light (editorializing: here we are discussing the speed of light as 3x108 m/s, with the implicit definition of a second being the time needed for light to travel 3x108 m), a definition in which there is no arrow of time, or a definition of time where it can move faster or slower (editorializing: probably in inertial reference frames, without taking relativistic effects into account, since we already do have the concepts of different rates of time in different reference frames when acceleration is involved), or a definition of time which lies outside this universe and thus is incomprehensible to us."

But just because we can't see past the veil, doesn't mean that there is nothing there.   or we can think about it another way, A long time ago I read a star trek novel called 3 minute universe.  for some reason a new big bang had happened in our galaxy and a new universe was growing within our own. So say this is what happened to our universe. It just popped up somewhere and started growing and destroyed what was around it as it grew. Nothing within could see or travel out side of it. (if for no other reason than it was growing faster than anyone or anything could travel) From the point of view of someone inside the universe's bubble, time started when the universe was born and started to expand. We have no way to perceive or observe the universe that ours was born into so even though time was going along just fine in their universe, it really didn't have any effect on our own.   then again, I'm not even totally sold on the idea that time is a thing, so take this for what you will."

In this picture, the universe doesn't have alternate times; every new big bang is simply one of a massive amount of other big bangs that happen simultaneously, growing out of the remains of the universe before it, which in turn was simply one of many others from a previous big bang.

So to best answer your question, our time could be nothing more than a waterfall of strongly interacting forces that are constrained by the very fields that make our universe up.

At this scale, you find a funny thing begins to happen to our notions of space and time. In general relativity, space and time are united into a single, mutable fabric called spacetime. As you get down to the scale of the Planck units, you find that your clocks begin to act like your rulers and vice-versa. Or at least, this is according to FLRW cosmology, also known as the ""standard model"" of cosmology.  In the FRLW metric, at the early universe you have what is known as the cosmological singularity, and just as near the singularity of a black hole, spacetime intervals are space-like, meaning that between two events, there is not enough time for light to traverse the distance between them, so there is no causal link between events.  All of this is kind of a round-about way of showing that we really don't know what happened before this time. We're looking for a grand unification of the forces, but we have yet to incorporate gravity into this picture. Once a quantum theory of gravity is made we may have a clue at before the start of our universe, but we may not.  The 'branes' you refer to are part of M-theory, a unification of consistent superstring theories; they are essentially higher dimensional analogues of the strings you may know of. In M-theory, branes can have physical properties such as mass and can interact with each other; there is a theory of cosmology that posits that our universe is restricted to a p-brane and that perhaps, as you stated, the universe was formed from the energy of the collision of two branes, but the simple truth is that we don't know yet.

Physics,3905n6,SILENTSAM69,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:12:22 2015 UTC,"Quantum foam:       Quantum foam (also referred to as space-time foam) is a concept in quantum mechanics devised by John Wheeler in 1955. The foam is supposed to be conceptualized as the foundation of the fabric of the universe.   Additionally, quantum foam can be used as a qualitative description of subatomic space-time turbulence at extremely small distances (on the order of the Planck length). At such small scales of time and space, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle allows energy to briefly decay into particles and antiparticles and then annihilate without violating physical conservation laws. As the scale of time and space being discussed shrinks, the energy of the virtual particles increases. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, energy curves space-time. This suggests that—at sufficiently small scales—the energy of these fluctuations would be large enough to cause significant departures from the smooth space-time seen at larger scales, giving space-time a ""foamy"" character.  With an incomplete theory of quantum gravity, it is impossible to be certain what space-time would look like at these small scales, because existing theories of gravity do not give accurate predictions in that realm. Therefore, any of the developing theories of quantum gravity may improve our understanding of quantum foam as they are tested. However, observations of radiation from nearby quasars by Floyd Stecker of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center have placed strong experimental limits on the possible violations of Einstein's special theory of relativity implied by the existence of quantum foam.  Thus experimental evidence so far has given a range of values in which scientists can test for quantum foam.

Physics,393l02,HyperfinePunchline,2,Tue Jun 9 00:33:56 2015 UTC,"To probe smaller length scales you need higher energies. So the advances in accelerator science have allowed us to have particle accelerators with higher and higher interactions energies.   You simply can't get information at small length scales without using huge energies.   It is not simply like a microscope, where you can get a better lens and look at smaller things. At some point you can not see things because the WAVELENGTH of the light you use is too big and will not interact with, say the structure of a nucleus, but only the structure of the overall atom.   To get smaller wavelengths, you need higher energies. However we don't need to restrict ourselves to light, and can smash stuff like protons together at higher and higher energies. At low energies we will only see the large scale structure of the particles created in a particle acceleartor. To get at the small distance details, you have to increase the energy, this is difficult.  One hurdle for smashing particles together at higher and higher energy is that accelerating particles give off radiation. So we would love to give particle accelerators even more energy but as they go around the ring they give off radiation and lose energy. Trying to build straight accelerators could solve that but then you lose the advantage of being able to give them energy over and over as they pass through the ring many times. Instead of a ~25km ring, you would need a linear one many many times longer than that to get the same amount of energy.  Maybe everything I said here is too simplified, maybe you wanted something more in depth, feel free to ask, but I tried to give it to the layman. TL;DR smaller scales require more energy, high energies are difficult and expensive."

Physics,393l02,plasmanautics,2,Tue Jun 9 05:14:39 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming that when you've heard about ""probing small length scales"" it's been in the context of particle physics, or at least atomic/subatomic scales. In that context, the basic reason is that on the quantum scale, everything is described by waves, and the energy of the waves is proportional to their frequency, or inversely proportional to their wavelength. The distance scale a particle's interactions to are proportional to it's wavelength, and so we need higher and higher energy probes to probe shorter and shorter distances.  For an illustration of the idea of shorter wavelengths probing shorter distances, think of water waves in the ocean. If there's a large rock or land mass, waves coming up to it break; they're partially reflected backward, partially deflected around, partially dissipated. But in any case, they're disturbed, and if you look at how they're disturbed you can, in principle, learn something about the shape of the land mass. On the other hand, if you have something small floating in the water, like a buoy or a surfer, as the wave passes by, that thing will just rise and fall, and it won't disturb the passage of the wave at all.  The difference between those two cases is in ratio of the size of the object and the wavelength of the wave. If the characteristic size of the object is much smaller than the wavelength of the wave (like with the buoy), the wave is undisturbed, and looking at the scattered wave doesn't tell you much about the object. If the size of the object is much larger than the wavelength of the wave, then the wave is affected much more, and looking at the scattered wave tells you a lot more about the structure of the object.  You can extend this to light, which is a wave with a wavelength proportional to its energy. Light in or near the visible range incident on an atom is often of the right wavelength to be absorbed or emitted in conjunction with an electron transitioning between energy states; those wavelengths are on the same order as the size of the electron orbitals. X-rays and γ-rays incident on an atom can Compton scatter, which is much more similar to one particle bouncing off of another; that's because those wavelengths are short enough to be more comparable to the characteristic scale of the electron's Coulomb potential.  At higher energies than that, we start using charged particles, because we can accelerate them using electric and magnetic fields (we can't do that with light, because it isn't charged). Those particles (electrons, positrons, protons, antiprotons) also have mass, which contributes to their total energy. At low energies, you can get electrons and bare helium nuclei from radioactive decay, which is how the atomic nucleus was discovered (via Rutherford scattering). Once you start accelerating them, you can start to probe nuclear scales, and learn that the nucleus is made of protons and neutrons. Then with higher and higher energy particles (of whatever sort is most appropriate), you can start to probe the structure of the nucleons and find the quarks, and start to create lots of other particles that don't exist in our everyday experience because they're unstable.  Another way of thinking about length scales is in terms of force carrying particles. We associate one or more particles with each of the fields describing the fundamental forces (the photon for EM, the Ws and Z for the weak force, and the gluons for the strong force), and the mass of each is related to the range of the force. The photon is massless, and the electromagnetic force has infinite range; if we ever find a quantum theory of gravity, we expect the graviton to be massless for the same reason. You can think about an interaction via one of the fundamental forces as involving the associated particle being exchanged. The higher the energy of the particle, the shorter its lifetime, and the shorter the distance it can travel in mediating the force. So again, to learn about a short-range force, you need a high-energy reaction.   In high-energy physics (which is basically synonymous with particle physics) we usually just talk about specific energies, or masses. That's pretty much equivalent in terms of the physics, but more relevant to the physical quantities we measure in the relevant experiments. But basically, higher energy == smaller distance scale, and the way to learn about fundamental physics at shorter scales is to collide particles with higher energy. That's why we keep building bigger and bigger particle accelerators; that's the technology we have to, well, accelerate particles."
Physics,393l02,eewallace,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:27:43 2015 UTC,"The short answer is wavelength/energy.   If you want to probe microscopic scale (10-6 m), then the wavelegth of visible light (400-700nm) is of the same order of magnitude of the object. At the nanoscopic scale (10-9 m), visible light cannot resolve anything as its wavelegth is huge in comparison. You can use ultra-violet  (400 nm - 10 nm) and X-rays (<10nm) to interact at this scale, but these both have different scatter and penetration properties which produce different results. You can also use low energy electrons (de-broglie wavelength 1.2 nm) as a diffraction probe, or low energy light ions as a scatter probe.   To actually obtain spatial images at the nanoscale, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), Atomic force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (AFM) are common examples. STM is perhaps the most interesting as it exploits the high ratio of tunneling transmission probability to spatial variation (0.1nm change induces x10 change in tunneling current). This is then measureable by exploiting the piezo-electric effect.  Probing pico (10-12 m) or femo  (10-15 m) metre scales is essentially in the realm of high energy physics, otherwise known as particle physics. That's where my crude short answer ends.   Therefore the technological developments which aid these measurements are optical lens technologies (c. Galileo onwards), then low energy scatter on Au foil (Rutherford) followed by solid-state techniques of X-ray diffraction (cathode ray tubes, V.d.G generators) in the 1920's (Compton etc) on to particle physics using cloud chamber to detect cosmic rays (c. 1950s). I guess accelerator technology was the biggest bottleneck to particles physics which has grown over 50 years or so.   From this perspective, it's perhaps surprising that the nanoscale arguably the most recently developed given the advent of SPM in 1985. I presume this is due to a number of reasons such as the benefit of very high vaccums, nC processing circuits and the piezo-electric control of scanning and tip height. You also need an ""atomically sharp"" tip however that's something which either involves a pair of pliers and a knack or a chemical etching. I think IBM were behind the discovery, which makes sense give the extremely low noise components required."

You can see an effect of the wave function, an wave like-property which is impressed on any particle. The amplitude of it describes the (density of) the probability to find an electron at a certain point. Figuratively (in other words simplified and wrong) the particle is small enough to pass through a slit, but the wave it drags along is so big it is not even zero at the other slit and since it behaves like a wave it passes through and interferes with its other part coming through the first slit. But at the end it is still somehow describing the location of only one particle and at the screen this wave has the form of an interference pattern. But on your screen you will only see one single tiny flash at one point, because there is only one single small particle hitting it.

To OP's wife: Also I understand how quantum mechanic hides behind math in Planck's law, in the photoelectric effect and in emission spectra, ... well ok i wanted to link to Rabi oscillations but the english wikipedia article seems unnecessary quantum mechanicly...

Observation of quantum interference with fullerenes is interest- ing for various reasons. First, the agreement between our measured and calculated interference contrast suggests that not only the highly symmetric, isotopically pure 12C60 molecules contribute to the interference pattern but also the less symmetric isotopomeric variants 12C5913C and 12C5813C2 which occur with a total natural abundance of about 50%. If only the isotopically pure 12C60 molecules contributed to the interference, we would observe a much larger background. Second, we emphasize that for calculating the de Broglie wave- length, l 1⁄4 h=Mv, we have to use the complete mass M of the object. Thus, each C60 molecule acts as a whole undivided particle during its centre-of-mass propagation. Last, the rather high temperature of the C60 molecules implies broad distributions, both of their kinetic energy and of their internal energies. Our good quantitative agreement between experiment and theory indicates that the latter do not influence the observed coherence.

We did meet with one professor who doesn't specialize in graphene several months back. His area of specialization is different, but it's still in material science. Our teacher told us how we were well prepared for the meeting, probably to raise our hopes, but that wasn't true. We were absolutely NOT prepared, and as a result we definitely didn't look great. We went, had the meeting, and the professor spent lots of his time explaining things to us and showing us around his lab (definitely one of the best moments of my life). He then suggested he would help us out by looking through the research papers we looked at and telling us if they're bad. At that point we were happy he didn't turn down our idea.   Here's where we made the biggest mistake: our teacher suggested that she should first look over the papers so as to not burden him and take away more of his time (made sense to us back then, somewhat). We gave the papers to her, and then comes Spring Break. She still hasn't replied, and we decided to wait for her. Our reasoning was that she's our sponsor teacher and we should listen to her advice. Well, we tried to contact the professor again, but he ignored us (makes sense). Now it's hard to approach him because I don't want to sound like it's her fault. That would be a childish excuse. It was our responsibility to take action, and it's our fault for not sending the papers to him and to her at the same time.

Because of this, the limit he's calculating would apply anywhere in the universe, even if the universe is infinite, as long as the cosmological principle holds.  Put another way, because of the speed of light limit there's no way to achieve a higher computational capacity in this universe.

However, there exist classical solutions to the Einstein equations that allow values of the entropy larger than those allowed by an area law, hence in principle larger than those of a black hole. These are the so-called ""Wheeler's bags of gold"". The existence of such solutions is in conflict with the holographic interpretation, and their effects in a quantum theory of gravity including the holographic principle are not yet fully understood.   The actual amount of information (Kolmogorov complexity)  in the universe directly following the big bang was much lower than the amount of information in the the universe today. Magnitudes lower.   This has no correlation with the bulk number of particles. (In the extreme case, you could have 1090 bits , which are all zero.)  But what was the entropy of the universe at  t = 1 second after Big Bang?  No one knows.    Seth Lloyd admits:    Quantum gravity provides a maximum energy density given by the Planck scale and a maximum bit density supplied by the holographic principle. Accordingly, the amounts of computation that can be performed in a quantum gravitational context are finite. Indeed, the fundamentally Planck-scale character of the limits derived above suggests that they hold equally in quantum gravity. But whether or not these limits hold for the first instant of the universe’s existence is a question, like many raised here, whose answer must await the construction of a consistent theory of quantum gravity."

You want to solve by plugging in your distance desired into D. There will then be multiple solutions, since you can go slower off a higher ramp, or faster on a less steep ramp ( below 45°) or a combination of any of these factors.  If you plug the equation into wolfram alpha you can get a solution plot of the various sets that will work.  Alternatively, you could make a quick excel sheet and just play around a bit with some reasonable values, like 155 km/h top speed, and ideal 45° angle ramp and solve for the height. Then adjust values to see the effect they have.   You must use SI units here, so convert speeds to meters per second, and distances to meters.

Integrating a constant 23.2 m/s against time is exactly what I did.  I can see what you're getting at.

That answer is how much farther would you have to ""fly"" if you continuously updated your heading to hit Jamaica.  Which is a different answer from ""what is the most efficient distance to Jamaica?"" where you fly to where jamaica will be when you get there.   Once you reach the end of your planned vector, jamaica will still be advancing away from you at 23.2 m/s.

Given the original data the rider would be in the air for ~8 hours. Thus the Earth would experience 1/3 of a full rotation between the time the rider leaves the ground and touches down again and the rider would not be rotating with it.

Also, depending on the lab you are in, knowing some kind of CAD program can be super useful. Is there a machine shop? It might help to get trained there.

If you get through a paper a week you'll be doing great. Don't try to get all the math or work out all the theory. Just try and get a coherent picture in your head of all the basics.

Physics,38xaou,barrelofsquirrels,12,Sun Jun 7 17:08:05 2015 UTC,"Is it required that the electrons move in a circle (like in synchrotron beam lines) for them to give off radiation?   No. Any trajectory in which charged particles (this is not just about electrons, but charge in general) experience acceleration causes the emission of photons. This is not even a result of quantum physics, this process is perfectly fine described by the Maxwell Equations.  Although the processes in and around antennas are quite complex (you're dealing not with a single particle, but with charge densities), it's the acceleration of charges in an antenna (which ultimately results in a nonstatic evolution of the electric field) which is what makes it emit electromagnetic waves.    Would the amount of radiation given off be measurable by a geiger counter or some sort of accumulated radiation counter?   If the photons produced are of the ionizing kind, i.e. have energies above ~10eV, then yes. For lower photon energies you'll need an detector appropriate for that.   How good does a vacuum have to be for the elctrons to fly straight (I'm guessing very good)   The term you're looking for is ""free path length"" and it largely depends on the energy of the particle you're looking at. In air for high energy electroncs the free patch length can be quite long. Several cm (keV) up to some meters (GeV).   I'm also wondering if I could find an old TV that used cathod ray technology to perform the experiement.   Well, CRTs work with electrons of about 25keV typically. And since accelerated electrons are essentially beta radiation they're of course built in a way, that the electrons, and the X-Rays produced by decellerating the electrons (bremsstrahlung) are contained and shielded from the outside. Of course you'll need a very good vacuum in the first place to accelerate the electrons to energies large enough to have a significant free path length in air. Also the electron guns in CRTs are sensitive to Oxygen, so venting a CRT with air will damage the electron gun. So a CRT is not a very good source for an electron beam.  If you want to do experiments with electron beams, like see how they behave in a magnetic field you're far better off with an old analogue oscilloscope. You can get them cheap on eBay; defective units in which either the time base or the vertical amplifiers are broken, while the high voltage and tube are intact  would suffice for you."

I'm most familiar with bremsstrahlung, which is X-ray radiation given off by decelerating electrons.  They are not the result of circular motion. Geiger counters can detect electron radiation, but only at relatively high energies. A better bet would be to use an ion chamber, as they're more sensitive to the lower energies you'd want to be working with. I can't help you on where to get either tho. Maybe a local university/hospital might help you out. Even then, it might be hard to produce detectably large bremsstrahlung. While electrons certainly scatter in standard air, is nearly negligible when compared to the amount they scatter/decelerate in water. I don't think normal air will produce much noticeable radiation due to election decelerations.    Just checking the internet briefly led me to believe that TV cathode rays produce 25 kev electrons, meaning that the highest energy radiation you'd see is 25 kev, which is pretty hard to detect quantitatively, as I believe most ion chambers are calibrated between 50 and 100 kev, and 25 Kev radiation might not penetrate the detector walls."

It is constantly being accelerated towards the sun due to the forces on it. The forces involved in keeping the electron going in the straight line, though, are calculated by quantum mechanics; radiation emitted is proportional to the change in energy eigenstate that the electron goes through as it interacts with all the other electrons performing the magnetic and electric force exchanges (via photons) necessary for angular transport through a particle accelerator. tl;dr: When an electron in an atom goes down an energy level, a photon is emitted. The entire UNIVERSE is a quantum system, and thus any point in time has energy levels which may be traversed.  Going off that last part, we can find out (probabilistically) the state-flow of an electron as it traverses its quantized energy levels, sometimes (probabilistically) jumping down one, probabilities linked to the devices performing the acceleration...mostly. All energy level transitions emit photons continuously; Feynman called these virtual, but in the sense of the theory, they are real. These photons are EM waves which travel probabilistically, collapsing upon ""measurement."" (in quotes because I really dislike the term)  Anyways, if you wanted to construct a device which was able to detect these virtual photons (as Feynman dubbed them) it would take what amounts to a significant amount of processing power. That is, your detection device would line the walls of the vacuum chamber, and have hyperfine electron energy level transitions within it, ones which were sensitive to these EM perturbations, that collapse only to transmit their energy into moving an electron into a different energy level. Or to define it in more detail: As it spreads out probabilistically, the movement of many electrons becomes an entangled structure, states defined by the EM coupling and the field's time-evolution total perturbation. This gets a little weird here, but basically: The structure of the matter which your measurement device is, has to be long-range sensitive to the types of quantum interference effects a single virtual photon presents. This means cold, but it also means organized cold.  We've gotten pretty good, but a lot of what I've described above is purely theoretical. There is a theoretical limit to what your sensitivity could be, but it's on the order of what the fundamental energy level separation in free space is.

Physics,38xaou,dampew,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:14:37 2015 UTC,"Actually in most modern synchrotrons the circular motion isn't too important, wigglers and undulators (I forget which is which) are what cause the electrons to radiate.  One of the problems with measuring the radiation is that it is emitted at all different frequencies.  I don't think you'll be able to find a detector that can measure all of it.  You might be able to measure some fraction of it within a certain energy range...  I thought of a couple of ideas for a slightly different experiment: say you fire an electron beam at a wall.  You can accelerate the electrons across a voltage gap (say, 500V, which will accelerate them to 500 eV which is a unit of energy), so you know the initial energy.  Then when they hit the wall, you'll know the final energy (0 if they're absorbed, or -500 if reflected).  So you know that the electron will emit 500 eV of energy as it decelerates.  How much of that energy will be heat, and how much will be light?  How much of the light will be visible, and how much will be other frequencies?  You might have a better chance of answering those questions...  By the way, you should be able to look up the inensity distribution (as a function of angle) for an accelerating electron in different situations to get an idea of how it should look.  You can calculate the mean free path of the electron at the link below -- if you want to know what pressure you need, just make sure the mean free path is much larger than the path length of the electrons: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kinetic/menfre.html"

It was the first example of quantum dynamics when Erwin Schrödinger derived it in 1926, while searching for solutions of the Schrödinger equation that satisfy the correspondence principle.   The quantum harmonic oscillator and hence, the coherent states, arise in the quantum theory of a wide range of physical systems.  For instance, a coherent state describes the oscillating motion of the particle in a quadratic potential well (for an early reference, see e.g. Schiff's textbook ).  These states, defined as eigenvectors of the lowering operator and forming an overcomplete family, were introduced in the early papers of John R. Klauder, e.g. .  In the quantum theory of light (quantum electrodynamics) and other bosonic quantum field theories, coherent states were introduced by the work of Roy J. Glauber in 1963. Here, the coherent state of a field describes an oscillating field, the closest quantum state to a classical sinusoidal wave such as a continuous laser wave.  However, the concept of coherent states has been considerably generalized, to the extent that it has become a major topic in mathematical physics and in applied mathematics, with applications ranging from quantization to signal processing and image processing (see Coherent states in mathematical physics). For this reason, the coherent states associated to the quantum harmonic oscillator are often called canonical coherent states (CCS) or standard coherent states or Gaussian states in the literature.

There are almost certainly other classical like states but coherent states have some really nice properties. Schrodinger came across it by finding the state with the smallest uncertainty (i.e the most classical like state) and once he found this state he found that the expectation values, <X> and <P>, and their time evolution were exactly same for a classical oscillator.  i.e Classically we have:  x(t) = a cos wt  p(t) = bw sin wt  with a,b some constants related to initial conditions.  Quantum coherent state:  <X> = a cos wt  <P> =  b sin wt  And the formula you should try is the one below the text that reads  'This can be easily seen, as can virtually all results involving coherent states, using the representation of the coherent state in the basis of Fock states'  Basically it's infinite series but it will tell you exactly what coefficients to your eiganfunctions |n>, you need to build a coherent state.

If you're voltage limited (i.e., you apply 12V from a car battery), then adding more loops in series does nothing (except lower the resistive heating in the coils).  This is because your current I is set by your max voltage and Ohm's law: I=V/R.    If you double the length of wire, you double the resistance and get half the current.  That leaves the B field unchanged (because B is proportional to N*I where N is the number of loops).  So, unless you have a current-controlled PS, you probably want to wrap them in parallel.  But be careful, the set of coils with the lesser resistance will draw the greater current.  You should make the two sets of roughly equal resistance.  Then each will draw about the same current, and you will get twice the field of a single one.  Provided your power supply can deliver that much current.  Edit:  TL;DR:  If you are voltage limited (but not current limited), add them parallel.  If you are current limited (but not voltage limited), add them in series.

My senior year i took a math class as an elective. It was a duel enrollment class at a city college called Math 118 Mathematical Reasoning i think it was called (we just always said 118) to be in that class i had to pass a college lvl math class. Idk if that's enough info to go on but i was also elgiable to take Ap Statistics but chose Math 118 not to cry if i didnt pass the Ap test at the end of the year.  Things i covered in Math 118: Permutations Combinations Compliments of a set Cardinal Number Some Statistics   Idk if what i learned in Math 118 would count as anything worth knowing for actual Math. I am taking an extra Math class in the summer at my college to be better prepared for pre calculus
Physics,38x2b8,shockna,3,Sun Jun 7 19:21:04 2015 UTC,"Ok. That's important to know, as it helps to say how much remediation you'd need for a Physics (or engineering) degree.  At the University of Illinois-Chicago (and at most US public institutions; the requirements are remarkably standardized here), the Physics degree assumes that you've already taken precalc, and starts with Calculus in fall of the freshman year. Needing remediation (e.g. taking precalc at University) isn't the end of the world, but without taking a summer class or two, or an extra class in a semester or two, it will delay your graduation by a semester or two.  My recommendation would be to go through all of the algebra and trig you know, and drill down until you have as much of it as possible on instant recall. Your first couple physics classes aren't so bad; they require calculus, but the problems are usually simplistic enough that they're not too algebra intensive if you're setting them up right.  After that, especially once classes begin to use series approximations, you'll need all the obscure algebra techniques and trig identities that most students tend to overlook. If you can get a very firm grasp on these two subjects before starting calculus, you'll be in good shape to start a Physics degree."

Upcoming freshmens have acces to a learning module for math if you want to retake it to score into pre-cal or higher before fall semester. Im thinking of getting some books to go through to understand. I love Trig actually."
Physics,38v7pt,Phsyckystatt2,28,Sun Jun 7 02:50:08 2015 UTC,"Get and work through (a lot of) this book. It's like a problem-solving boot camp, and is commonly used to prep for PhD qualifying exams. It consists of a few hundred problems and solutions, and it sounds like the problems are right around your level (i.e., someone who has taken the undergrad classes and maybe some grad classes, but needs more practice). Since you've been through the usual textbooks, I think buckling down and solving a lot of problems will boost your abilities and confidence a whole lot."
Physics,38v7pt,IcingNine,6,Sun Jun 7 05:08:14 2015 UTC,"The thing that's worked wonders for me is becoming a tutor. At my school, undergrads have a physics help desk, so I work there as well as tutoring highschool and college students. For me, teaching is the best way to really learn the subject. When you can boil down and explain some concept to a kid who doesn't understand physics one bit, it means you know it pretty well  Also, these are the people that ask the strange, almost common sense questions. I feel its easy to get stuck only worrying about higher level physics that it is really refreshing to have people pull up a video and ask how something works. It honestly has changed my perspective to ask more of those pure, big picture and conceptual questions.   I don't know if you have time, but tutoring can be so fun if you get some good kids. And usually it pays pretty well for an hour session once or twice a week. Its more rewarding, funny, and profitable compared to reading textbooks."
Physics,38v7pt,bionic_fish,8,Sun Jun 7 10:00:46 2015 UTC,"Huh, personally I'd try not to force myself at a weakness if it's not something essential. Since I'm leaning towards theory/computation, I have no regrets about being horrible with experiments. ""Yeah, Michelson-Morley showed this and Stern-Gerlach showed that"" but I couldn't even design a decent working circuit this year, so don't ask me to reproduce them.  Well, once I explained to a freshman how to usefully attack a ""University Physics"" problem. I was probably just babbling semi-sense, because it wasn't how I think with my physics classes anymore, at least consciously. But I do think that the important part is that you've devised some sort of algorithm of attack. And you stick to it unless you've developed a good heuristic for a certain problem type, or you have no idea what you just read. You probably know this already, but the best way to develop your intuition and algorithm is to expose yourself to examples and more, more problems. This is what I tried to do with E&M, since I felt shaky with those problems at one point too. (I ended up lucking out from Jackson-caliber exams because my professor was a theorist!)  What I told the freshman, with regards to a simple statics problem, ""First, separate the problem into its geometry, and its phenomenology.""  Essentially, think about the fulcrum and the right triangles independently of the force vectors, and then figure out what's going on. Although, that kind of separation is as artificial as University Physics problems, really. I personally, when confronted with a physics problem, ask myself ""OK, so what are the symmetries?..."" As physics majors may know, symmetries (geometry) go hand in hand with  conservation laws (phenomenology), and enough of those determine a problem.   You have a real upper hand by understanding formalism. My mechanics professor honestly believed ""Get the Lagrangian, and almost everything follows automatically."" And perhaps on the test that is really convenient, but better yet, you have multiple ways of understanding a problem.  For instance, in a gravitational problem, you surely know angular momentum is conserved, and potential energy is rotation-invariant. Reason through both like a ""Newtonian"", (rotational invariant U -> force must be centripetal -> no torque -> bam, c.a.m.) ,and like a ""Lagrangian"", (rotation leaves Lagrangian invariant -> convenient gen. coor.s -> Lagrangian independent of angle -> EL gives c.a.m.) and you have a stronger link between the concepts. And as far as explaining ""real-world"" phenomenon, you probably want to translate from Newtonian.  Ah, my point is, even ""formalism"" is useful for problem solving, if only to reinforce your conceptual understanding, which I believe is extremely important in physics. But the best way to get over ""I can explain Maxwell's equations but what the hell is this Electric field?""-itis and its mechanics cousin is by example and practice. And then, everything you learn, try to explain it to yourself like you're 5. Big pictures, big ideas.  PS: CM by Taylor"

This is what I do and it works really well. I am still working on my undergrad, but I have a secondary education emphasis (so I've done student teaching) and I teach 100 level physics labs.  Forcing myself to step back and think about problems that my students can solve forces me to go back to that same point in my education and look at the tools I had then. I have to stop just using the big words and explain them."

My peers managed the courses by understanding structure, formalism and symmetry of the problem and the language and the symbols - but change one small thing in their algorithm and they can't solve or understand anything.  Solving for eigenvalues for instance, since we obtain it from Ax = bx, we can equally obtain it from either |A-bI| = 0 or |bI-A| = 0. I usually switch between both because I don't like working in negatives and I usually make a mistake.   However - my peers get stumped by my second method and will just refuse to use it because they don't really understand it - they don't trust it and they don't think it will be right if you do it that way. (yes it will)  So do make use of algorithms and symmetries for strategy - but not for understanding."

Endless problem sets build the habit of always trying to force given information into a formula as a plug-and-chug machine, and some folks never learn that problem solving is often just noodling around and trusting your instincts.

Physics,38w1wd,iruchlin,11,Sun Jun 7 13:33:38 2015 UTC,it's the other way around.  special relativity follows from the fact that the speed of light is the same in all inertial frames of reference.   the assumption about the speed of light being the same follows from observation.
Physics,38w1wd,teh_lux,9,Sun Jun 7 09:31:05 2015 UTC,Yep.  In fact Maxwell probably could have formulated special relativity if he would have accepted that.

Which is that without an invariant speed for all inertial frames, all laws of physics can't be the same in every inertial frame. With just that postulate you can derive SR."

The speed of light isn't special to light, it's the rate at which any massless particle will permeate the universe. in that sense c = 3x108 m/s is probably better thought of as the relationship between a metre and a second in our universe.  In my shallow understanding of the history of science, I think the subtle realisation of an invariant value for c came from the observation of quantisation of light. The concept of massless particles challenges classical theories of motion, even though it had been proposed by Newton and others long before, and makes the permeability/permitivity constants in Maxwell's equations seem more profound that first thought.

Half the reason trains don't derail is due to their massive weight, all the adaptations in train wheels deal with handling the massive weight and inertial forces when turning. Train wheels are completely smooth and depend on the massive weight to generate enough friction to move. So in theory normal trains would only be able to go 1/6th the speed around a turn and stop 1/6th as fast.   However I'd imagine alternate rails would be developed, ones resembling rollercoasters with wheels above and below or maybe maglev trains of some sort."

You cannot remove dark matter from the standard model and get the same fit, equating the matter density to the baryon density is wildly wrong.   Then there is his derivation of the Tully-Fisher relation which cannot explain why the empirical formula is non-exact. In his summary of anomalies he doesn't point out that it isn't a range of possible values, the relation is different in different observations.   Lastly his claims of dark matter smell of ignorance of the topic. He claimed it was self contradictory and that cluster mergers should show an extra force which keep dark matter halos from collapsing, but of course CDM has no such force.

On top of that, he did have a derivation to explain the Pioneer anomaly, but recent work suggest waste heat being the culprit which pokes holes in the ambition to explain a lot of different anomalies with the quantized inertia.  I think it's an interesting idea though by the author's admission the equivalence principle is broken so I feel skittish around it--admittedly though, I haven't really figured out a way to outright refute it either, I've read Mike's work before. However, I'm a sucker for weird ideas, so my by the book answer is that I don't think most physicists are aware of QInert and if they are, most would consider it quite fringe.  Edit: I see that second blog post addresses the thermal model for the Pioneer model briefly--and that the rest of the anomalies are tabulated as well, so take my complaint about it with a shot of whiskey. The thermal model still seems more reasonable than a fundamental shift in physics at least at this time.    Edit2: Here's the original idea which did get some attention,     Haisch, Rueda, Puthoff, 1994. Inertia as a zero-point field Lorentz force. Phys. Rev. A., 49, 678."
Physics,38vzsg,AsAChemicalEngineer,5,Sun Jun 7 08:57:50 2015 UTC,"OK, first my comments on the bullet cluster:   The bullet cluster is one example only and you can't defend a hypothesis using one example. Other clusters like the Musket ball cluster and Abell 520 differ: there the gravitational lensing separates from the galaxies, making the whole dark matter hypothesis ad hoc: has to be differently applied in different cases.  http://phys.org/news/2012-03-dark-core-defies-explanation.html So why the focus on the bullet cluster? The bullet cluster is what lawyers would call circumstantial evidence since it requires rather a lot of inference. You have to model the collisions process and make assumptions. As Milgrom says online somewhere: to suggest a change in fundamental laws does not necessarily mean you have to give up all dark matter. There is probably some 'normal' matter that is still not seen, just much less than proposed by the dark matter hypothesis. So why not propose new dynamics rather than new particles (which haven't been seen)? The bullet cluster may be explainable by MiHsC, but I would need to have information about the motion of the matter within it, and this is not available. A cleaner test case would use globular clusters, which show the same anomalous spin as galaxies (Scarpa et al., 2006) but are too small to contain dark matter, as normally applied, and are embedded in too high an external gravity field to be explained by MoND, but can potentially be explained by MiHsC which is dependent on local accelerations.   My criticism of the thermal explanation of the Pioneer anomaly can be found here: http://physicsfromtheedge.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/comment-on-thermal-model-of-pioneer.html  It is true MiHsC breaks the equivalence principle, but in such a way that the difference could not have been seen in torsion balance tests. This is because the anomalous acceleration predicted by MiHsC is independent of an object's mass, so Galileo's two balls would still drop at the same time (both slightly faster). Torsion balance tests of the equivalence principle work by having two balls at either end of a bar suspended from its mid point by a wire, and by the twist in the wire they look for a horizontal differential 'fall' of the balls towards distant masses. MiHsC predict the balls fall equally, so there'll be no twist in the wire and no apparent violation of equivalence, yet still in MiHsC inertial mass is different to gravitational.  The Haisch, Rueda, Puthoff paper was an inspiration to me, but the model they used is different and they needed an arbitrary cut off parameter to scale the zero point field (zpf) force down to give inertia. The way I've modelled inertia is more elegant in that the Rindler horizon that forms as you accelerate makes a difference in the zpf on either side of you so the absolute energy in the zpf does not matter (so no scaling required), only the difference matters, and it predicts the inertial force within 29% without tuning."

Mathematically, completeness of an orthonormal basis (ONB) in a Hilbert space guarantees one to approximate any function in the space with linear combinations of the functions in the ONB arbitrarily well; this makes the analysis of eigenvalues very straightforward (viz. the Rayleigh–Ritz method).

I realized that in the case of electrostatics, the building block solution for voltage is just the voltage due to a point charge.

An MSc masters course here is usually 12 months in the UK whereas in the rest of Europe it's often 24 months. In Sciences the Masters tend to be more vocational - one of the most popular ones at my University, for example, is basically preparation for working in the Nuclear industry. Other popular ones include things like Computer Science Masters degrees whose first subject wasn't computer science.  Part of the reason it's so much shorter here is that we specialise much earlier - you apply to a specific undergraduate degree (say, Physics) rather than applying to a University and picking courses as you go, and you only take courses in that subject (or sometimes closely related subjects but that really depends on the University)."

A basic BSc degree here takes three years, but most people will do an MSci degree, which is four years and then do a PhD. But, an MSci degree is still an undergraduate degree, not a postgraduate. They're also completely different in funding - you continue getting government student loans for your fourth year in an MSci degree just the same as your previous three years. An MSc here, you have to pay upfront normally unless there's some industry funding, so many people take out bank loans or borrow from their parents.   Once you're actually on a PhD course, it doesn't matter what your background is - you start doing a research project. Typically you apply directly to a project so you know what you'll be doing before you start. So they're all roughly the same length - 3 to 4 years - even if you didn't start it with a masters level qualification.

In the quantum eraser case, before I make the measurement to determine the path, I don't know which path the particle took, so I assign probabilities based on that lack of knowledge, and those probabilities display interference. Once I make the detection, I assign the probabilities based on the path I know it took. After the ""erasure"", I'm once again uncertain about the path, and so I have to go back to assigning probabilities based on that uncertainty. In experiments where you manipulate one particle in an entangled pair to create or destroy the which-path information for the other, the QBist interpretation is that you're not affecting the behavior of the other one at all - only your knowledge of its behavior.  I'm not sure if there are versions of the quantum eraser experiment where the which-path information exists, but the experimenter herself can't have access to it, and the interference still disappears. It seems plausible, at least, but I don't remember enough of the details."
Physics,38rq6v,eewallace,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:26:47 2015 UTC,"So it's knowledge of the path, not observation, in the interpretation you're talking about, correct? I.E. it isn't that observing changed the behavior because observation requires interaction, but rather that not observing meant that at the quantum level, no path information exists?   Assuming I understand correctly, that's sort of saying that (again, at the quantum level) taking or not taking a path does not transfer information about what path was taken, so it's as if to the rest of the universe, that you took the whole set of probable paths. That's interesting.  As I understand it, if a quantum level tree fell in the woods, and no other spatial thing could gather information about which path it took, it falls in every direction at once. That does, indeed, make me think I'm in a simulation. If I had to model something this complex, I would render only what created a sort of mesh with everything else, if the path information exists outside of the entity following the path, then where it went is important. Otherwise, an approximation distribution of possible path endpoints will do as long as the correct path is among the paths in that set. Assume space is sufficient, but processing power is limited, and I'm left with the distinct feeling that this universe is founded at the quantum level on something not unlike a computer simulation.  Of course, at this point, because I've said it so much, the word path has lost all meaning.   I find this terribly interesting all the same, even if I'm misunderstanding. Could you perhaps point me in the direction of a good resource? If it's math heavy, all the better."

I.E. it isn't that observing changed the behavior because observation requires interaction, but rather that not observing meant that at the quantum level, no path information exists?   Actually, when I wrote that reply, I thought that was not what Fuchs wanted to say (I thought the proposal was that the information does exist, but that the observer couldn't know it, and the usual quantum probabilities express that ignorance), but I seem to have been mistaken. On the other hand, he wants to go further and claim that what we call the quantum state is just a (subjective) probability distribution of outcomes. They do apparently maintain some sort of 'realism', but it's not clear to me what form that takes.   Assuming I understand correctly, that's sort of saying that (again, at the quantum level) taking or not taking a path does not transfer information about what path was taken, so it's as if to the rest of the universe, that you took the whole set of probable paths. That's interesting.   The interesting thing about the quantum eraser (the actual erasure part) is that you can restore interference without measuring the system. A common setup is a standard double-slit experiment (with light), where you put quarter-wave plates (which circularly polarize the light) in front of each slit, set up to induce opposite polarizations. So a photon passing through the right slit, say, will end up with right-circular polarization, and one passing through the left slit will have left-circular polarization. In that case, the two paths are different, and there's no interference. Now you create entangled pairs of photons, and arrange things so that one of them passes through that double slit, and then some time later the other one passes through a diagonal linear polarizer. What you see is that in that case, the one that passed through the double slit shows an interference pattern again. The interference disappears when it passes through the first set of polarizers, because ""which-path"" information exists, but then when its entangled partner passes through the linear polarizer, it's restored to a superposition of circular polarization states, just as it would have been if the path had never been measured. So performing a measurement on the entangled partner erases the which-path information for the photon that went through the double slit. Here's a paper describing a realization of it.  So whether taking one path or the other ""transfers information"" depends on what you mean by the phrase. The question isn't really whether there's a transfer of information so much as whether the information exists at all.    As I understand it, if a quantum level tree fell in the woods, and no other spatial thing could gather information about which path it took, it falls in every direction at once.   Well, if there's nothing that could gather information about it, how would you know it fell? :) Leaving that aside, though, I think it would be more accurate to say that there is some probability for it to have fallen in any direction, and the only prediction we can make about the observation is the relative probability of finding it lying in a particular direction. The orthodox interpretation is that prior to the measurement, the direction is undetermined, and once it's measured it ""collapses"" onto one of the possibilities, with relative probabilities given by the Born rule. The QBist interpretation discussed in this article is, as I understand it, operationally essentially the same (it agrees that the direction is undetermined before the measurement, and on the probabilities for each outcome), but holds that the quantum state of the tree is nothing more than the probability distribution that the observer attributes to the measurement outcome (and could therefore be different for different observers).  This paper linked downthread introduces some of the mathematical ideas behind it. I'm not sure I entirely understand their concept of observer-dependent quantum states, but it might be a start for understanding it."

It's an interpretation of the established theory of quantum mechanics. As such it's an exercise in the philosophy of science, rather than the science itself. That hardly makes it meaningless.   Nothing to do with physics.   That depends entirely on what you take the goal of physics to be. If you think the goal of physics is simply to describe experience, then indeed, interpretations of QM may well be entirely beside the point. If you take it to be part of an effort to learn about the actual world, then questions about how your models relate to actual things are entirely relevant to (though not part of) physics. Many physicists would share the former view, and many would not.   * I say not necessarily a scientific theory because it's not obvious to me that it's not falsifiable in principle, even if there's currently no clear way to test it.

So not outside the realm of plausible ideas, but not without its problems, either.   There is no actual world beyond what we can measure.   If that's the case, what ""reality"" do you suppose that testable theories are giving us information about? And what counts as something we can measure? To take an example from what I ought to be working on instead of redditting, I study gamma-ray emission from (among other things) quasars, which according to current theory are systems of accreting matter around supermassive black holes. When I say ""This quasar gives off approximately this gamma-ray flux"" or ""That quasar had a period of strong activity at that time"", are those meaningful statements? Are the black holes ""real"", even though the theory that predicts them also predicts that we can never in principle test their essential properties directly? Is the matter falling into them, and for that matter the galaxies they're at the center of real, even though there's no way we can possibly get anywhere close to one of these systems to try to see anything directly? Are the gamma-rays I'm using to get information about them real, even though the only information I can get about them comes from them being destroyed and creating other particles, which in turn I only get information about through the voltages they induce in some bits of silicon in a sattelite in orbit? And even though they things we measure about them may not even have definite values until that interaction happens?  What counts as ""what we can measure""? If you and I come up with different answers for a measurement, is one of us wrong? For that matter, what's the point of measuring something to begin with, if it's not to learn about what's actually there?  None of this is to claim that I have the answers to any of those questions, either. But I do at least think they're meaningful and interesting questions. If you don't, that's fine, you should spend your time thinking about what you find interesting.

Without reading any articles/papers on Triton, I'm going to say that very theoretically we could run a computer model of triton and see what happens, yes. However, if you would want a remotely accurate representation of what is happening, you'd have to treat triton as many billions/trillions/++ of pieces. Calculating all the interactions of these pieces between each other is non-trivial. In the end, even if we have the computing power to do it (which I don't think we do), it's better spent on other things.  You can make simpler models, but these models have a good amount of uncertainty, which is why we're not certain what is going to happen."

The main reason I thought it might be different is because I figured that really large objects with pretty general makeup should(?) be easy to make predictions about.  Another reason would be that, I would assume a large object crossing any kind of threshold would not cross all at once. ""Grinding"" to me makes more sense than just falling, because a sphere's mass won't cross a threshold linearly, either. Or am I misunderstanding something?  Also, do you know anything about gravity communicating angular momentum? It makes sense that it would, because the electromagnetic force does, doesn't it? Isn't that how an alternator works?"

There's a bunch of them, and even though they are tiny they do have an influence over time. The system can't be predicted exactly because it's 10+body problem.  Relative to why triton is slowing down, I assume it's tidal forces (or related). The same way the Moon is slowly moving outward, Triton is moving inward due to the slight deformation caused by the planets mutual attraction.  The way I see it (which could be overly simplified) , the moon creates a bulge on earth which pulls it forward in its motion, accelerating it slightly and pushing it away, and slowing it down on its new orbit. Triton rotating the ""wrong"" way, it is pulled back by the bulge, which pulls it down towards the planet.  Not sure if that's what you're asking with your question about angular momentum  though..."

If you have a spinning magnet, and another magnet comes into it's field, it'll get pulled towards the spinning magnet but it will orbit as the magnet spins. Does gravity do that too? Or is that something to do with polarity or something like that?"
Physics,38mqtg,Kevindeuxieme,2,Fri Jun 5 13:52:55 2015 UTC,"Gravity does do that, yes: this effect is called frame-dragging and appears in General Relativity although not Newtonian gravitation.  There is also gravitational radiation from orbiting massive bodies, which again occurs in GR but not Newtonian gravity.  However in the Neptune/Triton case both of these effects will be unmeasurably small as the fields simply are not strong enough.  What is causing the spin-down of Triton is much more simple: it's tidal forces.  Extended (not point-like) objects like planets get deformed by gravitational forces, and the deformation changes as the bodies move around each other.  As the bodies are not perfectly elastic this causes a lot of internal friction, which turns orbital energy into, ultimately, heat.  For systems like planets and moons the energy lost this way is enormously greater than the GR effects (I have not done the sums for Neptune and Triton but the power lost through gravitational radiation in the Earth/Moon system is several millionths of a watt)."

'Grinding' to me makes more sense than just falling, because a sphere's mass won't cross a threshold linearly, either. Or am I misunderstanding something?""  That is more or less correct.  Eventually, Triton's orbit will decay enough that it begins to orbit inside what is known as the Roche Limit, which is essentially a close enough distance to a large, massive body (Neptune) such that a smaller, massive body (Triton) will essentially be torn apart by the gravitation of the larger body.  As Triton is torn apart into smaller and smaller pieces, it will form a spectacular ring system around Neptune.  I specifically recall my Astrophysics professor last semester saying that if humanity is still inhabiting the Solar System at that time, that Neptune would become the well-known, ""ringed planet"", with a ring-system much more spectacular than that of Saturn."

The individual gauge block is a metal or ceramic block that has been precision ground and lapped to a specific thickness. Gauge blocks come in sets of blocks with a range of standard lengths. In use, the blocks are stacked to make up a desired length.  An important feature of gauge blocks is that they can be joined together with very little dimensional uncertainty. The blocks are joined by a sliding process called wringing, which causes their ultraflat surfaces to cling together. A small number of gauge blocks can be used to create accurate lengths within a wide range. By using 3 blocks from a set of 30 blocks, one may create any of the 1000 lengths from 3.000 to 3.999 mm in 0.001 mm steps (or .3000 to .3999 inches in 0.0001 inch steps). Gauge blocks were invented in 1896 by Swedish machinist Carl Edvard Johansson.  They are used as a reference for the calibration of measuring equipment used in machine shops, such as micrometers, sine bars, calipers, and dial indicators (when used in an inspection role). Gauge blocks are the main means of length standardization used by industry.

Physics,38mek8,BlackBrane,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:44:58 2015 UTC,"Quantum foam:       Quantum foam (also referred to as space-time foam) is a concept in quantum mechanics devised by John Wheeler in 1955. The foam is supposed to be conceptualized as the foundation of the fabric of the universe.   Additionally, quantum foam can be used as a qualitative description of subatomic space-time turbulence at extremely small distances (on the order of the Planck length). At such small scales of time and space, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle allows energy to briefly decay into particles and antiparticles and then annihilate without violating physical conservation laws. As the scale of time and space being discussed shrinks, the energy of the virtual particles increases. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, energy curves space-time. This suggests that—at sufficiently small scales—the energy of these fluctuations would be large enough to cause significant departures from the smooth space-time seen at larger scales, giving space-time a ""foamy"" character.  With an incomplete theory of quantum gravity, it is impossible to be certain what space-time would look like at these small scales, because existing theories of gravity do not give accurate predictions in that realm. Therefore, any of the developing theories of quantum gravity may improve our understanding of quantum foam as they are tested. However, observations of radiation from nearby quasars by Floyd Stecker of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center have placed strong experimental limits on the possible violations of Einstein's special theory of relativity implied by the existence of quantum foam.  Thus experimental evidence so far has given a range of values in which scientists can test for quantum foam.

I'm not sure if these variations in the higgs field would equate to mass? or how they interact with what we normally understand. Maybe the higgs field really only matters at the quantum scale?

Physics,38ildm,wisdom_and_frivolity,2,Fri Jun 5 02:45:35 2015 UTC,"The higgs field doesn't have varying measurements across space.  A change in the value of the higgs field across space costs energy, so the value of the higgs field is the same throughout space.   The mass of a particle is determined by the expectation value of the higgs field and the its coupling to the higgs field.  So a particle that couples strongly to the higgs field will have a high mass, whereas a particle that is only weakly coupled to the higgs field will have a small mass.   If the value of the higgs field changed, then particle masses would change as well.   (For example, in the early universe, the expectation value of the higgs field was zero, and all particles were massless.  Another example)  An analogy is to think of trying to move through a crowd.  The more crowded the room is, the slower you'll be able to move and if its less crowded you'll move faster.  You also are slowed down based on how much you interact with the crowed.  If your a celebrity, you might be mobbed, and have a hard time moving anywhere, whereas if noone knows you, you'll move through the crowed alot faster.  In this analogy, the expectation value of higgs field is analogous to how crowded the room is.  A large higgs expectation value is like a crowded room, and low higgs expectation value is like an almost empty room. So if the higgs field has a zero expectation value, particles will be massless and move at the speed of light, whereas if it has a nonzero expectation value, the particles become massive and slow down.  The coupling of particles to the higgs field is analogous to how much you interact with the crowed.  The more a particle interacts with the higgs field, the slower it travels (ie it gets a greater mass)."

Physics,38ikdn,SilvanestitheErudite,6,Thu Jun 4 15:20:16 2015 UTC,"Here, the eigenfunctions come from the Schroedinger equation:  Hψ = Eψ,  where here we have the Hamiltonian,  H = p2 /2m + V(x),  and the potential is defined as  V(x) = 0, for 0<x<L,            ∞ otherwise,  where L is the length of the box.  Here, we have E a constant, with H a differential operator (the momentum operator, p, can be written p = -iħ(d/dx)), and as such the above schroedinger equation satisfies the requirement for an eigenvalue-vector relationship, with ψ the eigenvector(function) and E the eigenvalue.  If we solve this equation, we find that the eigenfunctions,   ψ = K*sin(nπx/L),  with K a normalisation factor (we must have that the integral of ψ2 over the whole space is 1, because it describes a probability distribution).  As you might have noticed above, we can have a more general equation,  HΨ=EΨ,  where these Ψ can be written as a sum of the individual eigenfunctions ψ above, i.e.  Ψ = Σa_n ψ_n,  where we are summing over the index n (and the a_n are weighting factors to ensure the above normalisation condition). This clearly satisfies the above equation because it is linear.  What the demonstration above is showing is the time evolution of these waves (which is a little more complicated), but can still be thought of as an e-e relationship because the time and space dependences are separable.  Hope this helps!"
Physics,38ikdn,TheMrJosh,7,Thu Jun 4 16:03:03 2015 UTC,"I hope its fair if I explain as if you have some background in math, which it seems you do.  In quantum mechanics, eigenvectors and eigenvalues don't necessarily pertain to finite-dimensional matrices (linear operators), like in ordinary linear algebra; it's only true for simple systems, such as particles with spin in particular.  Instead, the general mathematical strategy in QM is to find eigenvalues/vectors of linear, hermitian operators on a space of functions. Function spaces can have a vectorial structure as good as any finite-dimensional vector space (adding, scalar product, inner products using integrals), but functions have much more ""degree of freedom"", having ""infinite components"", that there are more mathematical subtleties (but all the main ideas of linear algebra still carry over).   Now, in a function space of functions of one variable x, you should note that differentiation, d/dx, and multiplication by x are perfectly linear operations on ""reasonable functions"" Thus, you can expect that combinations of composition and addition to be linear operators as well. So if we wish to solve an eigenvalue problem  H f(x) = E f(x)  We call f(x) an eigenfunction, or eigenstate, corresponding to E. In general, this is tantamount to the analysis of a differential equation subject to some boundary conditions,  C f''(x) = E f(x)  And this is the main mathematical problem faced in QM. Why this is so can be seen from the postulates of QM: Wave functions, the infamous probabilistic entities representing matter at the atomic level, are complex functions living in a linear space of functions called Hilbert space. Hermitian operators represent observables, the physical quantities measured in an experiment. We must deal with hermitian operators because we interpret their eigenvalues to be the possible quantities we can measure, so they must be real. The same idea from linear algebra that we also obtain a basis for the space carries over as well. A basis is important in QM, because measuring a system whose eigenfunction is in that basis will guarantee you a specific measurement, its eigenvalue. However, linear combinations of the basis will result in wave functions in which no specific measurement is guaranteed anymore! This is the idea of superposition.  The most important observable is generally the Hamiltonian, or the energy of a system, because time evolution is easily known once you have the energy basis.   What OP has done is map out the time evolution of certain superpositions of energy eigenstates of a free particle bounded to stay within a certain interval, or more vividly a particle in a box. Admittedly, this is an ABCs problem for undergrads in QM. It's really solving a differential equation like the one I wrote above, with the condition that the wave function vanishes at the bounds of the interval. But time evolution is always fun to map out for some reason, even though advanced QM is concerned with other things, since exact solutions are basically impossible to find anyways."

Physics,38ikdn,wes_reddit,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:52:27 2015 UTC,"So, when I solved the particle in a box/QHO in my QM class last semester, we avoided time dependence. Like, COMPLETELY. We touched on it very briefly at the end of the class, when we worked with spin precession. That was a really simple system though - the expectation value literally precesses based on the time dependence, which is just an e-iEt/ћ function stuck on the end of ψ.  But I'm curious: Having a superposition seems to introduce time dependence. If ψ = 1/sqrt(2)*(ψ_1 + ψ_2) and ψ_1/ψ_2 are time-dependent, then  <ψ|ψ> = 1/2(<ψ_1|ψ_1> + <ψ_1|ψ_2> + <ψ_2|ψ_1> + <ψ_2|ψ_2>)  and while the first and last components will not change over time, the middle two components will; the quantity <ψ_1|ψ_2> + <ψ_2|ψ_1> is a time-dependent thing. That is, as time progresses, the (different magnitude) e-iE/ћ components of ψ_1 and ψ_2 have varying effects on quantities <ψ_1|ψ_2> and <ψ_2|ψ_1>.  If ψ_2 has more energy than ψ_1, then <ψ_2|ψ_1> will have a phase moving forwards, while <ψ_1|ψ_2> will have a phase moving backwards. Plus, since even in a time-independent scenario <ψ_1|ψ_2> != <ψ_2|ψ_1>, this may imply that the time dependence actually changes the probability distribution. Which...it obviously does.  I guess this would explain some of the parity stuff you mentioned /u/SydM107. If the phase movement doesn't affect the commutator [ψ_1,ψ_2] then there shouldn't be any change in the probability distribution.  edit: This is bothering me, so I'm putting some more work into it. Seems like the time dependence is related to the overall parity of component amplitudes, and the symmetry of energy eigenstates (time, for phase) vs apparent Hamiltonians (position, energy, for wave number). How, exactly, is kinda weird, too tired to do it at 4am but will prolly continue tomorrow."

I put this together last night at 4am trying to puzzle it out, only to really confirm that. :P The <ψ_1|x|ψ_2> and <ψ_2|x|ψ_1> components just don't want to get rid of their time dependency, no matter how much I play with them.  Makes me wonder about the role pure states (polarizations for example) have on time evolution in many-body systems (ie polarizing beamsplitters). Is the symmetry of time-evolution (forwards and backwards) preserved in high-entropy states (von neumann) within these many-body situations, or can the slight asymmetry in components be used to ""filter"" out specific parts?"

Currently doing my B.Sc majoring in Physiology and Physics + a math minor (the major is mostly physics with some added health science courses).   From what I've gathered from /r/PhysicsStudents + /r/Gradschool, choosing a supervisor is most important (which I totally agree with) as well as the topic...which is where my problem arises.  I'm currently doing a biomedical engineering summer research internship at my school, which I was super excited for because this kind of stuff interests me (something that combines both math/physics and biology). Unfortunately, my project has little to no math or physics and it's really bumming me out. Should I try something completely different, like particle physics, or not lose hope?

The good news is that a lot of the quantum questions/answers for the test can be memorized (or at least you can get a feel for them) because a lot of the quantum questions are trivia, not exactly calculation intensive. The bad news is that quantum mechanics is hard, especially so if you're going to try to teach it to yourself.   If your school doesn't offer a proper quantum mechanics class see if a professor will let you do a 'reading' course for one or two credits next semester. Get ""Quantum Mechanics"" by Griffiths and read through at least chapter 5 (or all of the 'part 1' on theory), working some of the easy exercises and filling in the blanks in the proofs given in the book.

And this is the third summer in a row where I've applied for relevant work and received no reply! Usually I've gotten at least an interview but this time, nothing!  For some background, I am double majoring in physics and math at an American flagship state university and have a 3.5 GPA. While I'm primarily interested in graduate school in physics, I'm open to going into engineering or just getting a private sector job right after graduating. During my regular academic semesters I work in a research lab that's part of the ATLAS Collaboration at CERN and, on my own time outside of my university work, I've managed to coauthor a paper that made it into a major pedagogical journal. Considering my past failure at getting relevant summer work, I applied to about a dozen REU programs, which, for those unfamiliar with undergraduate STEM internship programs in the United States, are federally funded research internships offered at many American universities. I also applied to several national laboratories through their internship programs, an internship program abroad, as well as around a dozen more applications to private sector companies. Unfortunately though, there are few private sector internships geared specifically towards physics majors in the US and I've gotten the impression that even those that do accept physics majors, are really after computer science and engineering majors. I've also talked to professors at my university. The lab I currently work in does not take undergraduates for the summer and many other labs were fully staffed for the summer by the time I asked.  So now I'm stuck at home, and I don't have many options. I'm trying to figure out a project I can do on my own time, and all I seem to have left to do is study for the GREs.

You can measure down from the rim of the pool and verify its even all the way around.  Wrinkles.  Didn't seem to be a problem. The boundary layer was in full effect. The dye would settle on the bottom and not move. This told me flow was slowest there, and flow increases as you go towards surface. 3 times each in each hemisphere.  Same results every time in each hemisphere. Round I did on the third time.  I waited 7. Same result. I did it indoors. Which way did my valve turn?  Now you're just being rude.  I recommend buying a $10 kiddie pool and running this yourself.  It's clear I will not be able to make you happy with my answers.  Why seemingly faster?  Flow rates."

While it is likely a very small effect, so is the Coriolis effect, so it's conceivable that it could be a factor. There's a number of different ways to deal with it as well, not just repeated runs. For instance, two drain pipes, opposite ends of the pool, both valves opened in opposite directions simultaneously. Not saying it would make a lick of difference, but it would have easily controlled the variable."

Physics,38dpxx,phuicy,2,Thu Jun 4 02:26:35 2015 UTC,"The fact that you intentionally filled the two different pools with two different filling directions lacks a bit of scientific rigor.    I know you filled them in such a way that the final draining direction is contrary to the direction of filling, and I understand that this was your motivation for doing it this way.  The problem is that you've created an asymmetry between the two experiments.  While it is highly unlikely, one could argue that something else within the setup causes the pools to drain in a direction that is contrary to the filling direction, regardless of the Coriolis effect.  I'm not saying your experiment didn't demonstrate the Coriolis effect.  I just think this little detail detracted from your demonstration."

Physics,38dpxx,phuicy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:25:52 2015 UTC,"For those wondering, this effect is proportional to the sin of the latitude, i.e. max at the poles and zero at the equator.  It is very subtle on small scales, hence the effort that was required to demonstrate it in a small kiddie pool.  Typically, the effect only becomes apparent for things that occur over large distances and/or long periods of time (10-100 miles, 8-14 hours) depending on latitude.  It can have subtle impacts though.  For example, it affects currents and sediment transport in some rivers.   You have to do what they did and isolate most of the forces, otherwise those other forces will dominate the system.  Some science museums have a Foucault pendulum which is a good demonstration of the effect.  A simple way to picture the concept of a non-inertial reference frame (which is what causes the coriolis effect) is to imagine sitting in the middle of a slowly rotating record in empty space.  You can't feel the motion of the record or see it because you have not reference to measure the rotation against.  Now throw a baseball out towards the edge of the record.  To you, sitting in the middle of the record, it will appear as though the baseball is curing to the right.  To someone out in space above the record, not spinning they will see the baseball travel in a straight line while you rotate."

But if this effect were indeed too small to make a difference, say the variations in the build of the pool / drain / environment made more of a difference than the hemisphere, and because of that the pool always rotated in the same direction based upon those tiny variables instead.  So in that case the odds of the two pools rotating in different directions would be 50-50 (CW-CW, CW-CC, CC-CW, CC-CC). And for the results to align with the expected rotations, would be 25%. That's a lot of error to consider an experiment 100% definitive, would have made a lot more sense to include many variations of experiments demonstrating the same effect regardless of all variables.

The number of times they run the experiment with the same build wouldn't matter if the build itself / environment it's done in turn out to be the determining factor.  Not saying this effect is not indeed real and more prominent than those variables, just that this experiment alone isn't enough to confirm it."

The boundary layer was in full effect. The dye would settle on the bottom and not move. This told me flow was slowest there, and flow increases as you go towards surface.   The drain is a symmetrical unit. It can be turned either way.  So location is then the issue. Is your hypothesis that there something in the local area of Destin's garage and veritasium's garden (i think) that would cause the effect. Something that cause an unbalanced angular momentum in the water. Perhaps, a B field."
Physics,38dpxx,Simurgh,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:43:38 2015 UTC,"Quite simply that this one individual experiment isn't sufficient.  If it's possible to build a pool to always flow either clock-wise or counter-clockwise regardless of hemisphere with standing water, then it's possible that other variables in the design of this experiment could create the same effect.  Don't want to get into the specifics of all the different variables that could cause these variations as we'd be here all day.  I'd just be interested to hear from him why he thought this one build, one experiment was sufficient to confirm his hypothesis.

I wasn't trying to take a jab at it, was just looking for clarification as usually you're pretty thorough with those sorts of things.  My question was more on the quantification of how much of an effect it has on the water.  I know it does, but for all I know it could be so small that the tiniest variations in the build / other environmental variables could have a significantly larger effect.   Not necessarily that they do, but based solely on this one experiment, it's not enough to discount it."

At least throughout the entire thing.  Making a separated center compartment and filling it with water is probably the best you'll get.

Physics,38cil4,BlackBrane,7,Wed Jun 3 09:39:31 2015 UTC,"I learned about this one from Lubos.  It's mentioned in conjunction with a previously published excess observed by CMS in their search for right-handed W bosons, which was analyzed in terms of possible new physics scenarios in this paper and also discussed on TRF here.  Definitely something to keep an eye on in Run 2!"
Physics,38cil4,sabrepride,2,Wed Jun 3 09:56:28 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by the language here of the last part of the abstract:    Exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section times branching ratio for the WZ final state of a new heavy gauge boson, W′, and for the WW and ZZ final states of Kaluza–Klein excitations of the graviton in a bulk Randall–Sundrum model, as a function of the resonance mass. W′ bosons with couplings predicted by the extended gauge model in the mass range from 1.3 to 1.5 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level.   Basically what I think they are saying is that given final state WZ processes in the Standard Model, and for WW and ZZ in some Randall-Sundrum model with a graviton, the W' mass cannot be 1.3-1.5 TeV, at a 95% level of confidence. Can someone clear this up?"
Physics,38cil4,KillyMcDeath,2,Wed Jun 3 18:15:25 2015 UTC,"So what they're saying is that they set exclusion limits on 3 different final states (WW, WZ, ZZ) to see if there is any excess with respect to the expected background.  In the case of the WZ final state, the analysis also has the required sensitivity in the 1.3-1.5 TeV range to rule out a particular W' model at 95% confidence. If you look at left plot on page 18, the red line (corresponding to a W' model) is consistent with the expected limit in the 1.3-1.5 TeV range, but there is no excess in data."
Physics,38cil4,sabrepride,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:06:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, so the take home is that models with a W' in the 1.3-1.5 TeV have been excluded, but the data shows something statistically nontrivial around 2 TeV which could be a W'?"
Physics,38cil4,KillyMcDeath,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:44:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty much yes. However, I assume there could be other models that predict a W' in the 1.3-1.5 TeV range which are not yet excluded (there are always more models...)"

Physics,388jp6,FongChowPei,8,Tue Jun 2 17:40:53 2015 UTC,"My instinct would be to put a microphone somewhere, probably near a bell.  Then filter the audio so that you get a frequency band where the data is unpredictable.  And then do some thinning down to an entropy stream, via a hashing algorithm, before injecting that into the kernel.  Exactly what bands you extract is a subtle question.  I would aim for either a distinct 'marble hitting bell' in an unpredictable part of the track; or the overall sound from an area with lots of marbles moving about.  Something that has a lot of unpredictability, which is best determined empirically.  This is broadly the route taken by the Lavarand system, if you want some further reading."

Abstract  The question of how much momentum light carries in media has been debated for over a century. Two rivalling theories, one from 1908 by Hermann Minkowski and the other from 1909 by Max Abraham, predict the exact opposite when light enters an optical material: a pulling force in Minkowski's case and a pushing force in Abraham's. Most experimental tests have agreed with Minkowski's theory, but here we report the first quantitative experimental evidence for Abraham's pushing pressure of light. Our results matter in optofluidics and optomechanics, and wherever light exerts mechanical pressure."

There it matters whether the Abraham or Minkowski momentum is carried by the transmitted light, as it affects the net balance of momentum, whether it is positive or negative.

The pressure on the Earth would be quite meaningless since it would be so highly variable everywhere... you could calculate an average pressure across the wetted area of the earth but at that point you might as well just calculate the force and not bother converting to pressure. And that calculation would also be quite complicated, I'd imagine you'd need to model the albedo of the Earth in spherical coordinates to determine how much light is getting absorbed versus reflected and then do some kind of second-order integration over the surface of the Earth facing the Sun to sum up the resultant forces on the Earth from the reflected / absorbed light."

And one, one was written by W. K. H. Panofsky and M. Phillips, who above all else desire to teach students. For within these textbooks was bound the strength and the will to teach electrodynamics. But they were all of them deceived, for another textbook was made. In the land of Illinois, in the halls of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the Dark Physicist John David Jackson wrote in secret, a master textbook, to control all others. And into this book he poured all his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all physics grad students' lives. One book to rule them all. One by one, the free peoples of physics departments fell to the power of Classical Electrodynamics. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of grad students and PIs marched against the armies of Jackson, and on the very slopes of Berkeley, they fought for the freedom of physics departments. Victory was near, but the power of the book could not be undone. It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Griffiths, son of the king, took up the pen.

Physics,388vqj,ChaosCon,8,Tue Jun 2 23:34:10 2015 UTC,"Well this is what is euphoric to me:  -Maxwell introduces the induced magnetic field, and proposed that if a changing B-field creates an induced E-field, and now a changing E-field also creates an induced B-field, then B-fields and E-fields could be completely self sustaining, constantly creating eachother, and showed the wave shape that this would have. I mean hooooly shit.  -ϵ_0 and μ_0, constants derived in expereiments pertaining to forces in electric field and magnetic fields, are seen to reveal somthing remarkable when we look at deriving the Galilean field transformation equations. Through unit analysis, it can be seen that 1/sqrt(μ_0 ϵ_0) = c. I've heard people say that ""light is a wave of the electromagnetic field"" before, but woooahhh now I see.  -Also in deriving the field transformation equations, we can see that magnetic fields and electric fields are not seperate entities, they can literally be seen as eachother, given the contet of the observer.

That's it.... special rel--and this was Einstein's paper.  it doesn't get more lovely....until, you realized the simplest curvature invariant under diffeomorphism (i.e. a smooth change of coordinates) is scalar curvature.  compute  the euler lagrange equations of the integrated scalar curvature. They are the vacuum Einstein field equations. If you introduce a source term (aka stress energy tensor), then to use the divergence theorem you want the div of the source term to vanish--and you then add a term cg to the left hand side of the euler lagrange equation to make div of the lhs vanish. now you have the Einstein field equations in non-empty space.  solve these equations or even the vacuum equations under spherical symmetry to get the thingys called black holes. in particular, the vacuum sol gives a metric with components that  are not constants--yielding the result of gravitational time and space dilation.  you how pretty all this is, when some awful standard book doesn't obscure it.  no riding on light beams, no falling elevators, no mystical mach's  principle etc."

You should know how to take derivatives and do integrals, how to solve some simple differential equations, and how to take limits. Most importantly, you have to be very comfortable with what all these things (limits, derivatives, integrals) really mean.  If you get through all that, it wouldn't hurt to get acquainted with linear algebra. At a high school level they might introduce this as just matrices and vectors (if at all), but as you study physics you'll come to understand that matrices represent transformations on things, and vectors represent the things that are being transformed. But this is not so important. You'll get to it at the college level.  It should go without saying (but just in case, I'll say it anyway) that you should absolutely know all the math that comes before calculus (algebra, trigonometry, geometry).  On the other hand, if your high school physics class is anything like mine, or that of many other people I've talked to, it's not going to be particularly useful. At least, certainly if it's an algebra-based course. If it's calculus-based, it might be of some use, but still, high school level physics is usually so simplified that when you get to college level physics, it doesn't make much of a difference whether you're already familiar with the concepts from a high school class or not."

You'll go over most of the physics again in more detail if you do decide to continue studying it, so trying to remember physical equations and info itself isn't too important beyond HS.

Not good.    Let me expound on this further, because I absolutely agree but I think it needs more emphasis.  Just because you have memorized an equation and can properly manipulate the values to arrive at the correct answer does not mean you understand the physics of what's going on.  Most of the time, you should have enough of a grasp of the underlying meaning to rederive that equation even if you hadn't memorized it!  Equations are just our way to express physically meaningful relationships.  Understanding those relationships is key to building onto your knowledge and connecting to/understanding other related principles that otherwise might seem arbitrary.    This is also part of why I hate algebra-based physics - a lot of it is just presented as ""here you go, use this equation"" because a proper treatment is outside the scope of what you can do there...mathematically but also conceptually.  For a simple example: Velocity as a derivative of position makes perfect sense if you understand what a derivative is conceptually - you'll never have to memorize that relationship, it's just obvious."

Physics,389snp,jimmythefrenchfry,2,Tue Jun 2 20:39:03 2015 UTC,"I got it. Answering my own question here. I think this is right.   Basically, I had to remember the simple fact that the Limit (1/N)N is zero as N goes to infinity. Any N value in the denominator creates a fraction (smaller than 1), which gets even smaller when raised to the N'th power.   The ""last expression"" is the right-most thing in equation 7 (the thing raised to the N'th power. As N goes to  Infinity, the right-most thing in equation shoots off to zero.   Since the limit of the right-most thing is 0, then the second to right-most expression (e.g., 2N (em)LN)  must somehow be equal to it. (where I use lamba = L and epislon=e, since i'm typing in HTML).   The only way  2N (em)LN could be zero is if the number of path reversals is near or at 0 (and thus the L=R/N goes to 0).   So, the only paths that contribute as the number of steps N goes off to zero are paths that minimize the reversals. Paths that don't minimize the reversals are never permitted to enter Feynman's equation since he rigged the game. (Well the game may be set by nature). . .   Long story short, where the change in position increment is set equal to the change in time increment, NO reversals can happen (e.g., R/N = 0/N = 0) and the only allowable path between the two points A-->B is a straight shot at 45 degrees (e.g., the light cone).

He uses rotating arrows (vectors w phase) and draws curves out of many arrows that approximate integrating over many paths, so you can see exactly how various paths interfere and cancel each other out in an extremely visual and intuitive way."

Sure, there are fewer discoveries in fundamental physics than other branches of physics nowadays.  But that does not mean discovery in those other branches is not ""new"" physics.  Even though you could, in principle, derive 99% of the everyday physics from the Standard Model, we are a long, long way off from that goal as the computational expense is far too great with our primitive solution techniques.  There is still much to be learned about how best to solve such problems, because the physical laws can only give us an unsolved equation, whereas the space of boundary values is infinite.  Secondly, even ignoring the difficulty in solving the complicated physics problems, there's also the issue that emergent behavior can arise out of these rather simple laws: a game within a game, so to speak.  The rules that govern these emergent behavior are worthy of study in and of itself, not only because they are useful in practical applications but also because they describe something new, something that is not inherently manifest in the fundamental laws.  They are what give richness to science, otherwise there'd be nothing to learn from chemistry or biology."

Physics,385oj3,datapirate42,8,Tue Jun 2 22:41:19 2015 UTC,... So? The point was that noone's likely to make a gamechanging discovery in new physics with something they could build at home.  I wasn't arguing for or against how well Einstein understood anything.
Physics,385oj3,Quarter_Twenty,3,Tue Jun 2 05:02:52 2015 UTC,"Einstein made his discoveries with a pen and paper. Everyone has that at home. Who's to say the next game-changing discovery won't come from a young prodigy in an impoverished country, or a retired researcher who's been thinking deeply about problems his/her whole life? You can no more predict that than someone could have predicted Einstein. Remember, quantum theory arose from the inability of the physics of the day to explain the results of certain experiments (atomic spectra, photoelectric effect, etc.). Relativity arose similarly from the inability of the existing theory to handle deep questions and thought experiments. Confirmation came later to relativity."
Physics,385oj3,datapirate42,13,Tue Jun 2 05:11:36 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not impossible, but Einstein wasn't as unpredictable as you might think.  There's a reason half of the formulas used in relativity are named after other people, such as Lorentz.  People were already working towards this sort of stuff.  Maxwell's equations were well known, but not well understood and hint strongly at relativity.  And more importantly, you're right that anyone can do math on paper and come up with a new solution or something the like, but it means nothing without the ability to test it.  Nobody bought in to Relativity until Eddington's experiments with the gravitational lensing of starlight around the solar eclipse, and for good reason.  A theory that is untestable is basically meaningless.  It's why noone really takes string theory all that seriously."
Physics,385oj3,Quarter_Twenty,3,Tue Jun 2 05:21:01 2015 UTC,"You're being a bit extreme. Plenty of people took relativity seriously and the race for confirmation was intense. It made headlines in newspapers. Likewise thousands of people have spent their careers on string theory. We have no idea what fruit that may bear. We just don't. They haven't stopped their research, so we can guess that many think it's still worth pursuing. The idea of extra dimensions is tantalizing. What did Einstein or Heisenberg know about that? Lastly, I think it's silly to say that an idea ""means nothing"" without the ability to test it. An idea can change the world. Testing an idea may not require expensive, large-scale devices. It may just fit the new theory to existing measurements. The universe is our laboratory."

We don't know what it is but we infer its presence time and time again. Suppose a new, pen and paper theory of General Relativity comes along and suddenly explains those observations en masse. There'd be no need for any new, expensive tests. We already have telescope data by the petabyte.  Look, we're scientists. It's silly and pigheaded to think we know as much as we're ever going to know, that new ideas we cannot yet conceive are not forthcoming, or that the human imagination and innate problem-solving ability is somehow bounded and constrained by federal budgets.

Even at the time, one of the QM greats, I think possibly Pauli, adviced colleagues that GR is great (he worked in GR, too after all), but he adviced working on quantum mechanics, because in GR you have hundreds of pages of mathematics for each physical insight.  Now all fundamental physical insights are like that. You need the brilliant idea, and then be a technically brilliant mathematician, or acquire billions in funding, too.

Physics,385oj3,leftofzen,21,Tue Jun 2 18:28:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the rate is slowing down; in fact I'd say it's speeding up. As /u/RobusEtCeleritas mentioned, yes, the low-hanging fruit has picked and we understand the basics of most areas of physics and it's now becoming incredibly specialised. Imagine it like a giant knowledge tree. You have the trunk and main branches which could be core concepts like the classical laws of motion or relativity or electromagnetism, and we understand these concepts fairly well. They form the basis of more interesting but ultimately more complex and 'niche' concepts, which would be the outer branches on our knowledge tree. The tree can expand radially (more small branches) as more niche areas of physics are discovered, but the actual knowledge increase overall is small because we aren't discovering new fundamental concepts but rather specialised concepts built up of the fundamental ones.  What I'm getting at is that we have the base knowledge that allows up to discover and understand all the outer branches and leaves of our tree, which are vast in number, as opposed to the main branches which are much fewer. Every day or two there seems to be a new paper that details some specific effect or mechanism that is highly technical and would not be possible even 5 years ago. On top of that, a lot of new ideas are not for new physics themselves but how to better utilise known physics. A prime example would be battery technology or solar power, both of which are seeing incredible advances made possible by a highly specialised understand of the physics of those areas."

On a similar note, expanding computing has vastly increased the amount of data analyzed in basic physics as well, making discoveries like the Higgs boson or new simulations in material physics and cosmology possible.  Stable fusion energy, which will happen in 20-50 years will likely be the most influential discovery in physics ever; it doesn't involve fundamental new theory, but numerical understanding of existing theory so radically beyond anything we have now that no human will ever fully understand it.  While I get that it may seem like Physics had a golden age in the 20s and 30s (it did), I think the discoveries now are just as frequent, but more obscure and (seemingly) less important.

Physics,385oj3,deelowe,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:05:04 2015 UTC,"Computers are still made using transistors. The technology behind today's processors relies on the same fundamentals as the first germanium transistor. Also, vacuum tubes weren't used in computing for very long. They were more of a prototyping phase than what we'd consider modern computer. They were unreliable, expensive, and mostly suited for very dedicated tasks (e.g. cracking code). Punched paper is less relevant. That's storage and a bit of a different paradigm (which is in an even worse situation tbh).  In general, the electronics involved computing hasn't really fundamentally changed much at all since the late 50s. Progress since then has mostly been a direct result of making smaller transistors and better engineering. Sure, there's been tons of incremental improvements, but a computer today really isn't that different from the first transistor sitting on a lab bench.   Everything since then has relied on integration and improvements to manufacturing. Those are starting to hit a wall. 2.5 and 3d manufacturing is all that's left and thermals could be a huge barrier for these."
Physics,385oj3,deelowe,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:05:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah. 3d manufacturing is the next step, but it isn't going to solve a lot of problems. The big benefit is the improvements to io (e.g. memory). Thermal management is still an issue, so its hard to say how well this is going to scale. The first 2.5 d solutions are now hitting the market and 3d will be here in a couple of years. We'll just have to wait and see.  Ray may be correct in that Moore's law will continue to hold, but we've done about all we can with silicon based solutions. Again the only major improvement has been manufacturing teqniques, better integration, and clever engineers implementing these in novel ways. Soon we will hit a wall with lithography. This has already happened with regards to clock speed. At that point, the only thing left is these more esoteric solutions like 3d manufacturing or asics that emulate software on a chip. These may buy us a little more time, but the days of the easy wins are almost gone and I expect we'll see performance suffer as a result (we're already seeing it in some cases like price for performance in memory and ssds have hit a lithography wall, which is why prices are still high on them).  [Edit] my point about individual transitors is that today's CPUs still rely on the same principles. Even if we argue they are different, ICs haven't fundamentally changed hardly at all since the first one. The lithography and thermal wall we soon have to content with are fundamental to performance improvement."

Physics,387nra,S_equals_klogW,6,Tue Jun 2 13:02:13 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain how conventional superconductivity breaks the electromagnetic gauge symmetry? As far as I understand, for the observables to remain gauge invariant under a gauge transformation, the gauge covariants should   [; A\rightarrow A+\nabla\chi  , \phi \rightarrow \phi-\frac{\partial\chi }{\partial t} , \theta \rightarrow \theta-\frac{2e}{\hbar}\chi ;]  but then my question is why do we have to choose a gauge such that [; \theta ;] goes to 0 and how choosing the phase [; \theta ;] as zero breaks the gauge symmetry.  I'm sorry if my question is a bit fuzzy,  been trying to wrap my mind around this for quite a while now."
Physics,387nra,S_equals_klogW,8,Tue Jun 2 19:13:34 2015 UTC,"Dear past self,   The local phase symmetry can be stated as, [;\psi(\vec{r},t) \rightarrow  exp(\theta(\vec{r},t))  \psi(\vec{r},t);] and the trick is you can change the phase by a different amount at each point in spacetime and the physics remains unchanged under such gauge transformation. But for it to remain unchanged, the potentials need to be transformed. So the standard gauge transformation as above should be followed. [; A\rightarrow A+\nabla\chi(\vec{r},t);] [; \phi \rightarrow \phi-\frac{\partial\chi(\vec{r},t) }{\partial t} ;] , with [; \chi(\vec{r},t) =\frac{\hbar}{2e}\theta(\vec{r},t)   ;] The calculation for ref  Now on it is simple, as you know in a superconductor B=0, so to be consistent we fix the gauge such that A'=0 in [; A'\rightarrow A+\nabla\chi(\vec{r},t) ;] Therefore you get the old vector potential A as, [; A=\nabla\chi(\vec{r}) ;] and finally you get the relation between gauge function and the vector potential in a field free region which one uses to derive the flux quantization yada yada but in a simply connected SC as B=0, [;\chi(\vec{r}) ;]=0 and implies [;\theta=0 ;]. Period.   Aand [;\theta=0 ;] means the very factor you had the freedom to change in order to maintain the gauge invariance during a transformation becomes zero. Thus breaking gauge symmetry. Phew.   It's like landing in Russia, to add more drama let's say during the time of cold war, so landing in USSR, ignoring the whole currency exchange thing and trying to pay the local guy with dollars.

Physics,387nra,iorgfeflkd,5,Tue Jun 2 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"When I was learning about quantum mechanics and general relativity, I thought there might be some significance to solving the Schroedinger equation in the Schwartzschild effective potential. Something about how quantum particles would behave in a strong gravitational field, like electrons around a Planck-mass source, without having know the full quantum gravity. I was probably wrong, but is there any significance to that? Has anyone tried calculating it?"
Physics,387nra,mofo69extreme,4,Tue Jun 2 14:13:42 2015 UTC,"My guess is that the small extra term wouldn't change dynamics that much from the standard Kepler problem (""hydrogen atom""). It should be easy to treat it analytically using Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory or other approximate methods (like the large-dimension expansion).  If you want to get more precision in quantum gravity, you should look at computing QG corrections to gravitational bound states the same way that we treat the Lamb shift in QED, using a Bethe-Salpeter equation. In this case, you'd choose a Schwarzschild ""background field"" and expand the fluctuations about that configuration. You'll end up solving a similar Dirac-like equation (if you're using an electron) which should reduce to your Schrodinger equation in the appropriate limit. See that last chapter of Weinberg Vol. 1 for all the gory details, and then generalize it to canonical gravity. Of course, the results will be non-renormalizable.  IIRC, gravity is actually finite at one-loop, so maybe the calculation isn't so bad. In fact, maybe a similar calculation has been done. I remember reading somewhere (Schwartz I think) that the QG contribution to the perihelion shift of Mercury is something like 1090 times smaller than GR's contribution (this could probably be guessed by dimensional analysis too)."

Physics,387nra,VeryLittle,3,Wed Jun 3 07:44:47 2015 UTC,You get the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics
Physics,387nra,autowikibot,2,Wed Jun 3 13:11:18 2015 UTC,"Path integral formulation:       The path integral formulation of quantum mechanics is a description of quantum theory which generalizes the action principle of classical mechanics. It replaces the classical notion of a single, unique trajectory for a system with a sum, or functional integral, over an infinity of possible trajectories to compute a quantum amplitude.  The basic idea of the path integral formulation can be traced back to Norbert Wiener, who introduced the Wiener integral for solving problems in diffusion and Brownian motion.  This idea was extended to the use of the Lagrangian in quantum mechanics by P. A. M. Dirac in his 1933 paper.  The complete method was developed in 1948 by Richard Feynman. Some preliminaries were worked out earlier, in the course of his doctoral thesis work with John Archibald Wheeler. The original motivation stemmed from the desire to obtain a quantum-mechanical formulation for the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory using a Lagrangian (rather than a Hamiltonian) as a starting point.  This formulation has proven crucial to the subsequent development of theoretical physics, because it is manifestly symmetric between time and space. Unlike previous methods, the path-integral allows a physicist to easily change coordinates between very different canonical descriptions of the same quantum system.  The path integral also relates quantum and stochastic processes, and this provided the basis for the grand synthesis of the 1970s which unified quantum field theory with the statistical field theory of a fluctuating field near a second-order phase transition. The Schrödinger equation is a diffusion equation with an imaginary diffusion constant, and the path integral is an analytic continuation of a method for summing up all possible random walks. For this reason path integrals were used in the study of Brownian motion and diffusion a while before they were introduced in quantum mechanics.     Image i - These are just three of the paths that contribute to the quantum amplitude for a particle moving from point A at some time t0 to point B at some other time t1.

If you think this stuff is cool, then read the MultiNest paper:  http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.3437  Basically, it's an algorithm that can find the maxima (plural!) of a highly multimodal function in many dimensions, and does it faster than if you tried using Metropolis-Hastings for that (which is fair enough because that wasn't MH's task in the first place). It achieves this by estimating contours of the function as (d-1) dimensional ellipsoid surfaces and moving inwards. It's a really important tool for global fit people!"

As different amounts of the ""day"" side of the faint star are visible along its orbit, the brightness of the system changes in a sinusoidal fashion. The variation detected isn't large (a few parts per million), but it's larger than the errors.

I suppose it might depend on the problem and/or what exactly you're trying to do with the Fourier transform, but if you're just referring to Fourier transforming a differential equation to make it easier to solve, I don't think you should have any trouble with just using the regular Fourier transform, reverse transforming the solution, and then imposing the boundary conditions. And it's probably easy enough to take a couple derivatives of the solution and check that it solves the problem.   I'm also trying to figure out if that dirac delta function has a residue if it's extended to the complex plane.   I would imagine that depends on how you define the extension. The usual Dirac delta function, defined such that integral[delta(x-x0)*f(x)dx] = f(x0) for integration ranges including x0, is defined on a particular set of possible test functions, which is usually a set of functions on the reals.

At least with the LDA and GGAs you know what's going wrong. Getting a correct, physically motivated prediction for the band gap is going to require G0W0 or better.  [1] Hybrid functionals largely work because local functionals underestimate the band gap, and Hartree-Fock overestimates the band gap. Hence, some arbitrary mix of the two will be closer to the true band gap. However, this doesn't mean it gets the other electronic structure (such as band gradients) correct, and giving first principles motivation for why you've chosen the mixing between functionals is tricky. I've seen arguments for 1/4, i.e. in PBE0. If I had to, I'd pick one, probably PBE0, and not tempt fate trying other ones."

Tools from differential geometry and topology have been imported to complete band theory (band theory!) with a full classification of the many inequivalent insulating states that non-interacting electrons can inhabit. Apparently tools from category theory have been imported to generalize some of this scheme to bosons, but now we're venturing way outside my expertise."

Physics,37zghz,CondMatTheorist,5,Mon Jun 1 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"I certainly didn't mean to be discouraging about physics, generally. I truly believe that there are lots of fantastic mysteries still hiding in nature, and that young people should study physics and discover them. My question is why do you believe the ""next big mystery"" will come from a string theory PhD project?  What I'm very interested in discouraging, however, is unrealistic expectations. You can certainly set wild goals, miss them, and still land softly. There's far less sympathy however for people who actively ignore the bad situations they get themselves in to."
Physics,37zghz,rstanton3,-2,Mon Jun 1 20:13:17 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree that string is not the only place that big discoveries could still be made, not that I really know. What I thought you were kind of getting at is what I see a lot of people saying, that the age of discovery is over and all we have room for now is minor improvements on age old theories. I think the biggest discovery to be made (that we have a question of) is dark energy, whether the universe will eventually reach a thermal equilibrium, and the depressing outlook that that gives to beings of life."
Physics,37zghz,Indaend,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:56:58 2015 UTC,The answer to the thermal equilibrium question is 'no' if you want perfect equilibrium and probably still no if you want pseduo-equilibrium

Is this due to shrinking funding or because the field has reached a dead end and it's time to abandon ship? Are you suggesting that in another, say, 20-30 years, string theory research would have practically ceased?"
Physics,37zghz,CondMatTheorist,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:01:21 2015 UTC,"String Theory just has no practical applications, so the government would rather just build another F-22 raptor rather than fund 3000 string theorists for a year.   edit - This wasnt meant to be a jab our government. I am actually more pro-F22 raptor than I am pro-string theory."
Physics,37zghz,SpacedOutKarmanaut,5,Mon Jun 1 08:59:34 2015 UTC,"This is a bit unfair; the F-22 is of course a well-known flustercluck, but reference to a vague, nefarious ""the government"" is a pet annoyance. The world has many governments, with a wide variety of priorities.  It's also weird to me when aspiring physicists act like the words ""practical applications"" are an obscenity, and that therefore the moral content of a government supporting 3000 string theorists is manifestly higher than supporting, say, 3000+ engineers. If we're going to play that game, then it's fair to wonder why any string theorist should get any funding at all, when that money could be spent on food and housing for the poor."
Physics,37zghz,CondMatTheorist,3,Mon Jun 1 13:11:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, but you've got to convince someone to fund your research somehow, or find funding for yourself. No one is saying ""don't fund it at all,"" but you have to be able to make a case about how many of a certain type of physicist / chemist / mathematician etc. you need versus other types. If condensed matter looks to have many possible offshoots and applications whereas string theory is difficult and involves difficult experiments we can't do yet, it's understandable one preferentially gets funded."
Physics,37zghz,sketchquark,2,Mon Jun 1 17:46:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe I was a bit ranty, but if it wasn't clear, we seem to be in complete agreement.  To put perhaps a much-too-fine point on it though, the tone of the thing I responded to (perhaps I read it wrong) suggested that 3000 string-theorist-years is objectively better, somehow, than yet another stupid fighter jet. I see this attitude frequently, but the ""somehow"" never gets filled in.  I personally think the current level of funding for string theory is adequate for the goal of producing string theory research. It's woefully inadequate to provide job opportunities for every would-be string theory student. This must be disappointing to young students, but it is no more tragic than a government's inability to provide stable employment for any other citizen."
Physics,37zghz,outerspacepotatoman9,3,Mon Jun 1 19:50:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to give a negative tone, but I understand how one could interpret it as such considering the location of the discussion.   I could have certainly chosen a better example, but I found myself amused by the imagery of ""Which would win in a fight, 3000 string theorists or an F22 raptor?"" I think we know the answer to that. On a side note, the price tag of an F22 raptor is seemingly absurdly high in comparison to that of say an F15 Eage (say a factor of 10). But in a battle of ten F15s vs one F22, the F22 is expected to be able to shoot down four or five of the F15s before its even detected (six on average if I remember correctly).   and I agree that the number of employed string theorists vs progress in string theory is far from linear, but I am less certain that the people handing out the money are thinking along those lines. The funding of construction of an F22 raptor ultimately feeds many mouths (possibly 3000 Americans for a year?), but an F22 raptor is produced at the end so it has an actual measurable output with a use."
Physics,37zghz,yangyangR,2,Mon Jun 1 21:29:19 2015 UTC,"well to be fair government funding is only part of the story. Universities are only going to hire so many theorists and there are no large ""string theory labs"" to provide alternative employment."
Physics,37zghz,MedPhysPHD,7,Mon Jun 1 17:01:07 2015 UTC,String theory has a lot of offshoots. You could learn just enough strings to do one of those and not tie yourself to such a risky prospect.

There are two types of curvature, intrinsic and extrinsic, and intrinsic curvature can entirely be detected within the surface itself. You could put an unusual measure of distance on the plane and calculate its curvature easily. There's no need to claim that the curvature is actually because we're jutting out into some higher dimension."
Physics,37yix2,Snuggly_Person,8,Sun May 31 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"There is not evidence that it is, and there's reasons to suspect that it isn't (like Lorentz symmetry).

Physics,37yix2,iorgfeflkd,10,Sun May 31 14:49:19 2015 UTC,"You really should not believe those observational claims. Photons that we're getting from high redshift GRBs have such long wavelengths compared to the planck length that even if there was planck scale granularity, the effects would be completely washed."
Physics,37yix2,duetosymmetry,2,Sun May 31 23:18:09 2015 UTC,Why would any dispersion that ocurred in the first few billion lightyears have been washed out by subesquent redshift?
Physics,37yix2,John_Hasler,5,Sun May 31 23:29:16 2015 UTC,"There are no detailed models which actually predict dispersion. They just add phenomenological higher-order terms to the dispersion relation and put some arbitrary scaling with ratio of granularity scale to photon wavelength in there, and then constrain the extra terms they've added.  I never suggested anything about when effects do or don't take place. I am suggesting that within each wavelength of light, there are a huge number of quanta of spacetime (if that's what you think happens to geometry at some fine scale). And nobody actually has a model in which to compute the dispersion from spacetime granularity, so you shouldn't trust these claims."

Physics,37z21a,sagiwaffles,6,Sun May 31 16:46:51 2015 UTC,It wouldn't change that much. We had an idea where to look for the Higgs and confirmed it. We don't really know anything about dark matter so not finding things only changes constraints on what it could be. So if nothing is found a few theories on what dark matter is could be eliminated but that's about it.

Having extra math background will really help out in grad school coursework especially if you go the theory route and take courses like advanced EM, QFT, QED etc...  The programing skills can be picked up easier on your own time as needed (at least that was my experience) in comparison to Math. Upper-level math courses should give you the necessary foundation in logic to make picking up programing family simple. (As an example I think that I would have had a much much harder time teaching myself group theory for use in quantum physics and quantum chemistry in comparison to teaching myself python for use in data analysis / numerical physics)  I know there's much more to a CS degree than just  programing but if you end up applying for jobs requiring specific knowledge that a CS degree would have imparted I'd like to think that a PHD in physics with a BS in Math as well would let your potential employer know that you'd have little issue filling in the gaps on your own.

And you could always pick up an MS in CS if you wanted a more formal education.   If you could swing it, I'd double in math and physics and get a minor in CS (or just take as much CS as possible).

You will struggle, but that is the process. As a TA I am always astounded by the number to students who simply haven't put in the time. As my QM prof would always tell us, ""There is no substitute for hard work.""     I'm going to tell  you some things that I wish a graduate had told me when I was you:    You're learning how to play a game that we call ""physics"". You're not going to be good at it at first, but pay attention and try to learn the rules. Keep this mindset while you learn and things will be far less ""this doesn't make any sense"" and much more ""i'm beginning to see how this goes together"". Just go with it. Don't write off any of the tools you're learning as ""past"" material. Dot product and Cross product are essential. You need to use them later on.  Use WHITE PAPER! The lines in notebooks are distracting. Don't believe me? Try it out.  There's a difference between finding a solution, and writing up a solution. Finding a solution means you've had that ""AHA!"" moment. You've solved the puzzle. Great! But is it written in an illegible scrawl on one side of the page? Grab a brand new, fresh piece of paper and start at the top. Create Your Own Solution. This is the difference between copying your buddy who already did the homework, and learning (and teaching) yourself the physics.  You literally have to ""figure it out"". Every time you work one of these problems you are constructing a model. What do you know about the problem? Can you draw a plot or a figure to begin? You may be thinking, ""I see it here in the book"", but there's nothing like actually drawing that sphere or that block of mass ""m"". You'll talk about Free Body Diagrams.      A student says to me, ""I need help with this problem.""  Resonant_freq: ""Okay, let's read it from the beginning. 'Find the net torque on a mass with forces...' -Okay, what's net torque?""  Student: ""I'm not sure.""  Resonant_freq: ""Let's check the index of the book...this page; here's an equation for torque and also net torque below. If you don't understand it, read the intro paragraph on torque and explain it to me""  Student: ""Okay got it.""  Resonant_freq: ""Write 'net torque' on your blank paper, near the top because you are beginning this solution. Now write the equation next to it. Okay now what is the torque acting on? The problem says a mass, and it doesn't say where, so we can assume it's at the origin. Draw an X,Y,Z plot with a point at (0,0,0) as the origin. Label the point ""m"".      If this seems obvious, you would be surprised at the number of new students who sit stuck and don't know what to do. Be deliberate in your problem solving and do anything you can to model the situation. Get it started and see how far you can take it before deciding you don't know what to do. The problem says ""A force acts on..."" Alright, so write the equation for Newton's Law.       Formatting: Try to visualize what your final solution would look like. Are you going to draw a figure? Put it in the top right or left quadrant of the page to utilize your work area (you're not padding a thesis).  Try to avoid the word formula. It implies that there's a special equation out there to solve your problem. An equation is a mathematical expression that describes the behavior of the physical world. When we write F=ma, we're making a statement that a force is equivalent to mass multiplied by the acceleration of that mass. The equation for Newton's Law of Gravitation is a good example of what you might call a formula, but it was derived from a series of meaningful equations. If you want to do well, don't let lecture be the first time you see new material. Period. At least look at what you're going to talk about the next day. See what it's about.  Stuck on a problem after writing all over the page? Trash it and grab a new one. Start from the ground up. I always say that learning physics can be thought of as building a mental scaffold, then placing things on it over time as it expands. How you do this is individual to you and is part of the learning process.  Google it! Do you understand how much you can learn from Google? For basic physics concepts, even Wikipedia is a good source. If I had a dollar for every time I told (not limited to students) someone  to ""Google it"" and they replied with ""I didn't think of that"" I wouldn't need another student loan. ""I've never done this before."" Great! Now what? It's not sarcasm, it's imperative! What can be done about it? You can be shown how to do something, but that's not the same thing as learning how it's done. You can't learn physics unless you do the physics. ""I'm not a math person."" Similarly, I am not a grand piano person. In order to learn how to play a grand piano I had to start by learning how to read sheet music and memorized the notes on the scale. I don't believe you.      This conversation happens more than I enjoy:  Student: ""I don't know how to do this""  Resonant_freq: ""No worries, do you have a book with you?""  Student: (some iteration of ""No."")  Resonant_freq: ""Let me grab one from over here.""      On a bad day I'd probably ask you how you expected to do any of this with no reference material. Either way, you can't do anything without a book. A lot of universities are ditching them in favor of online books. If you don't have a laptop, see if you can rent one from the library.     Finally, I'm going to tell you a secret here. If you're stuck on a problem, you've tried everything, and the homework is due, there's no shame in finding a solution elsewhere. The shame comes when you simply copy that solution for what it is and hand that in (see: plagiarism). Using a solution as a guideline to creating your own solution is a different process, the same as if you were to find that problem as an example in your book. Here you've found an example that helps you learn the physics, so long as you actually do it. You may find that you don't understand what happened from step A to step B, and it takes you some time to figure it out. The solution may not list all of the algebraic steps. Do the math yourself and verify it. Think it's bad? Consider this easy mode. You'll probably have one of these homework problems on an exam.   A student who finds a solution to a problem online to help them, in my opinion, and others will disagree with this, is making an honest effort to learn physics. If you follow what I just described, I count you far, far above those who throw their hands in the air and don't try. It tells me that you're resourceful and willing to work at it. You're saying, ""I've exhausted all other resources, but I'm still willing to learn this if there's an example that can help me."" This is what you do when you're not sitting next to a tutor. The problem arises when you make that a normal part of your problem solving. Don't let this become your go-to method of doing physics or you'll do poorly on exams and your retention will plummet.     Long winded, and perhaps more than you wanted to read. However I don't mind typing, and by seeking out r/physics you've demonstrated that you're serious about preparing. I honestly wish I knew these things before learning physics, and given the opportunity to start over I know I would have done much better.     I realize you asked for techniques, so I'll list a few below:   Know the difference between a Scalar and a Vector. Learn how to draw a 3D coordinate system Learn the Right Hand Rule now, instead of later. It's easy. Familiarize yourself with the concept of Vector Components and Operations  A Vector has components, but it also has an absolute value Use Khan Academy for references to Algebra and Physics. I wish this was a thing 5 years ago. Physics 1 and 2 have a general curriculum, and this one is spot on. I watched this guy's videos before he had a website; now it's turned into an entire database. Revisit your assumptions!. When solving a physics problem, you may need to make an assumption or two. For example: A problem tells you that a bullet is fired from a gun with some initial velocity and it wants you to find how far it goes before hitting the ground. The problem only says ""is fired from a gun"". Can we assume that the initial velocity is right when the bullet leaves the barrel? I would argue that is a fairly safe assumption for that problem and it affects how you would solve it. It could very well be a bad assumption and the problem indeed wants you to consider the barrel length. My point is that you run will into issues with your final answer. When that happens, always revisit your assumptions."

You'll go beyond simple algebra. That being said, manipulating variables in a complicated equation is something you should be very, very comfortable with. Interpreting functions from graphs will also be fundamental.  You can definitely expect to see trig functions being applied such as using SOHCAHTOA, taking arcsin(X) to find X, and working with sine and cosine equations (with adjusted periods and shifts) and graphs of these functions. Depending on how rigorous and thorough the professor is, you may see logarithms and exponential functions."

But to give you something fun to think about: All of physics is essentially the same. You have 3 things, really.   degrees of freedom: the part of your system describable by this proverbial manifold. They can be spins on a lattice, each taking a value up or down, or particles in real space who can have values that cooresponding to anywhere in physical space, etc.  map which eats the degrees of freedom and their current configuration and spits out a real number we call energy. We usually refer to this map as a Hamiltonian and a dynamical evolution rule, sometimes explicitly in the Hamiltonian. Based on the energy spit out and the configuration eaten, the dynamical evolution rule dictates how the system can evolve in the next step of time   The diversity in physics comes out of the symmetry properties and essential complexity of these components, plus some other stuff.

When you're asking what spacetime ""is"", I think what you should take that to mean is: what type of functions do we need to have? You can argue that spacetime needs to be a supermanifold since we seem to need a notion of anti-commuting functions (fermion wavefunctions) and I think supermanifolds are the simplest context in which that works.   You also can go further and consider, e.g., non-commutative geometry, in which (roughly) the coordinate functions don't commute with each other. This construction can arise quite straightforwardly, if you take, for example, string theory in the presence of background Kalb-Ramond "" B-field "", which is something you can build on the string worldsheet in terms of old-fashioned QFT on a manifold, but has this peculiar description from the spacetime point of view.  Something else fun which arises in string theory is ""non-geometric backgrounds"" which locally look like manifolds, but the allowed ""transition functions"" are expanded to include fundamentally stringy stuff like T-duality transformations, which are symmetries of string theory but not generally of QFTs."

I have never used it, but the principle of gamma spectroscopy is no different than if you were using a NaI(Tl) scintillator. First off, is your detector calibrated using known sources? This needs to be done so you can map the energies to the channels on the MCA (multi channel analyzer). If this is already done, great!      What you are looking for are the characteristic photopeak energies for the isotopes in these decay chains. Because you're using a germanium detector the resolution will be very fine (as opposed to NaI). You are looking for this. Both Radium 228 and 226 occur in the Th-232 and U-238 decay chains. To find out what is going on, you should look up these decay chains and find their gamma energies in a Chart of Nuclides. For example, for Ra-226 under the decay radiation link, you see a gamma energy of 186.211 keV in greatest intensity. You can double check this data by using the nuclide search. For Ra-226, you will get a page that looks like this. Clicking the symbol will return this page that lists the gamma energies. This is the long way of finding the raw data, otherwise you could research the characteristic photopeak energies for these isotopes; be sure you check your source.     Finally, if you are completely unsure of what you are doing with this spectrometer, or are unsure of whether or not it is calibrated, I have an undergraduate level lab manuscript written up that goes over all of this information and the process.

Old graduate level particle physics textbooks discuss granularity of spacetime, but they were written around the time when high frequency renormalization theories were a new thing.  Granularity of space makes renormalization work, because there's a reason for high frequency cutoffs that get rid of unphysical infinities.    In particular, one of the many grad level textbooks by Bjorken and Drell, spends a paragraph or two discussing the potential granularity of spacetime at the Plank length.  Their particle physics textbook was one of the canonical textbooks before Peskin and Schroeder.  Historically, granularity of spacetime wasn't a completely outlandish idea in theoretical physics, though it was never accepted as a mainstream idea.   They still test whether c is less than c for some frequencies of light by measuring the time evolution of very distant supernovae, after subtracting dispersion related to stray atoms between galaxies, specifically looking for granularity of spacetime at the Plank length.  In all experiments thus far, c is exactly c for all frequencies.  But, these experiments still haven't yet ruled out granularity at the Plank length, though they are getting close.  Modifying SR at the Plank Length isn't any more ontologically problematic then modifying General Relativity at the Plank length.  And, everyone accepts that GR gives the wrong answer for singularities within black holes, assuming that some quantized version of the theory will do away with inconsistencies."

Of course Greeks knew Achilles overtake the tortoise: the whole point of these paradoxes, though, is that they are probing the logical foundations of space and motion, and the Greeks did not have the philosophical tools we now have. The description that a Physics 1 student gives using calculus express things in a way that reconciles the fact that Achilles is at a spot at any point in time and that he is moving at every point in time in a way that can be reasoned about without getting stuck in a paradox.

Physics,37s3m1,MiloshHasCamo,1 point,Sat May 30 05:01:34 2015 UTC,"Loop quantum gravity:       Loop quantum gravity (LQG) is a theory that attempts to describe the quantum properties of the universe and gravity. It is also a theory of quantum space and quantum time because, according to general relativity, the geometry of spacetime is a manifestation of gravity. LQG is an attempt to merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard general relativity. The main output of the theory is a physical picture of space where space is granular. The granularity is a direct consequence of the quantization. It has the same nature as the granularity of the photons in the quantum theory of electromagnetism or the discrete levels of the energy of the atoms. Here, it is space itself that is discrete. In other words, there is a minimum distance possible to travel through it.

I also stumbled into the Heisenberg representation of Quantum Mechanics recently...it seems to postulate that a (valid) representation of quantum mechanics can be defined with a weird Schrodinger equation. It however is still derived assuming time evolution of the wavefunction is described by adding an eiH/t ...so idk.  There was one talk at the 2015 April APS conference which discussed an avenue for exploring quantum gravity through Clifford Algebras...the idea was that a ""time-like"" qubit and a ""space-like"" qubit, when expanded as a geometric series, gave rise to quantities similar to spacetime in some exotic mathematical equivalence.

Information does seem to be a ""real"" feature of the universe for example characteristics of particles. IMHO our ability to store data more efficiently shouldnt lead to a black hole unless massive amounts of energy is required. Blackholes are created when something warps space and times to a certain threshold. I guess that's what you mean by compression. In theory we could maybe create a giant blackholes through particle accelerators but creating one through information storage i'm not sure about.

Physics,37x3da,mathmath12,3,Sun May 31 04:30:08 2015 UTC,"First, there is no excuse for bad grades. You won't get anywhere with bad grades.  If you are curious about more advanced math jump right in and start teaching yourself. Don't let school hold you back. Start reading math books independently right now.  There are plenty of books written specifically for intelligent or skilled young mathematicians.  You CAN and SHOULD start reading math FOR FUN. Don't let school ruin math for you. Because, to be honest, most math teachers at the high school level are hacks and that is exactly what they do.   My degree was in applied math with a focus on physics, so I am biased, but these are my recommendations (you might not be quite ready for these yet and that's ok):  I want to begin by recommending LILLIAN LIEBER. The Einstein theory of relativity.  It is a great book that covers the basic calculus you need to understand relativity ( special and general). It's an amazing achievement. It can really be understood by a smart high school or junior high student. That is who it was written for.   The book that kicked off my interest in science was Rudy RUCKER's geometry and the fourth dimension.  Check out Calculus Made Easy by Silvanus Thompson. Knowing calculus opens up the doors to everything. It is the first step from baby math to the real stuff.  Leonard Susskind. The theoretical minimum also covers basic calculus and then moves on to real physics.  Spacetime physics by John wheeler doesn't have any calculus from what I recall. So it should be accessible to you now in theory. It begins with the Pythagoras Theorem.  (Then there is John Wheeler. Exploring black holes. This one might be a little tough. His style of presentation is somewhat unforgiving.)  and Einstein's  Relativity: The special and general theory was actually written by Einstein for his young niece to understand. It's pretty simple.  But those are just my favorites at that level. Pursue your own interests."
Physics,37x3da,mathmath12,2,Sun May 31 06:28:41 2015 UTC,"So this happened to me at school, I went to a fairly poor school teaching x-5=2x+6 for 3 weeks because people didn't get it. I stopped caring and messed around. I ended up hating education and didn't want to continue. Now I'm 26 and just about to finish my first year at uni -  not ideal....   I thought i was smart just like you so I stopped caring because it was easy. but if your smart like you say you are, you should realise that you need good grades to get where u want to be, even if you put in minimal effort to get top grades, do it! Spend your free time learning more advanced things, watch khan, MIT do anything you want but don't not try at school.  If I could go back in time, I would have put that tiny bit of effort in to get top grades instead of not caring and coming out of school with nothing because I was bored.  When I finally realised what I wanted to do (degree in physics) it was a lot harder to get there than it would have been if I had just not been an idiot at school.  Of course you don't have to listen to me, but this is just from my experience."
Physics,37x3da,johnahh,1 point,Sun May 31 05:48:30 2015 UTC,"If you are indeed that bright then (A) you should know that achieving in school is the key to academic success and (B) achieving in school/doing homework should be easy. Choosing not to do (B) shows that you truly don't understand (A). Or more likely simply lazy.  As someone who teaches Mathematics in school yours is a really difficult attitude to deal with. Working hard is not just about doing something challenging; throughout your life you will be expected to perform tasks that seem trivial and/or mundane. Every adult from the guy working at McDonald's to the PhD's top of their field will attest to this. By refusing work you are building habits of laziness.  For every student that is 'bright' and refuses to work we have another that is 'bright' and works really hard. When it comes to any kind of extra opportunity you can guess which ones will be first pick. Hardworking students are far more resilient to challenges than 'bright' students, and tend to be much more successful. We can't write in references that ""their grades aren't great but I know that they're naturally very bright.""  I see it all the time, a parent calls up and asks why their child isn't in the top set when there are children 'not as smart' in that group. If they aren't achieving what can we do? And if you're already in top sets and you're not getting better grades than everyone in there how can you say you're more capable? Get proof first before you can start to make bold claims.   Perhaps your school truly isn't pushing any of its students, and that may be a failing of the school I don't know, but there's absolutely no incentive to push a student who isn't even doing the work given to them.  TL;DR: Sorry about the rant but I see this attitude all the time and it always results in students achieving less than their potential. If you wish to learn more about your subjects then go ahead, but if you can't handle that on top of your school workload then you just need to focus on school."

I'm thirteen, I don't like bragging about it, but my teachers have always said I was the smartest kid they've taught, my friends call me names like robot, etc. However, since sixth grade (it's the end of seventh currently) I have been doing poorly and getting bad grades because I don't care for it, repetitive nonsense that i already know being thrown at me every day just doesn't provide a challenge, doesn't utilize my full potential, and I know it. I'm not doing poorly because because I can't do any better, but because I feel there is no reason to do good.    If you want to maximize your potential it's better to ""feel dumb"" than to ""feel smart"". I do not doubt that you may be the smart kid in your middle school, but I guarantee there is a room - maybe at your state university, an ivy or possibly a center for theoretical physics - where you are the dumb kid. You always want to place yourself in the mentality that you are at the bottom climbing up.  Another word of advice is that work ethic isn't learned in a day or overnight. It will be difficult to coast most of K-12 and then magically turn it on when you need to. Work ethic becomes muscle memory. You need an absurd work ethic to climb to the top of the totem pole in theoretical physics so I suggest you start now by giving your classes full effort. I guarantee that higher physics education is not all fireside chats with Feynman; there is a lot of dull...exceedingly dull shit you have to learn to progress forward.  The best skills you could pick up in middleschool/highschool would be calculus, differential equations and some programming knowledge. Switch to linux if you haven't already done it.

Do you calibrate based on ""spine"" or ""deflection""?  Byron seemed to indicate there were two different units for measuring.  I know there's an ASTM standard for measuring spine. ASTM F2031-05.  I also found this manual for measuring spine."
Physics,37ml6u,Trickarrows,27,Thu May 28 19:06:08 2015 UTC,"Yes I shoot. I calibrate based on spine. My wooden arrows are spined for 45#.

EDIT: for reference my bow is 35#@62"""
Physics,37ml6u,Trickarrows,14,Thu May 28 19:35:18 2015 UTC,"Another question.  Have you thought about how exactly the spine factors into the flex?  It's a tangential load on the arrow, but from what I can tell a lot of the load during release is due to inertial loading.  The cool thing to thing about is that the loading doesn't obey the normal buckling equation.  The front of the arrow would be experiencing less load than the back.  Correct?"
Physics,37ml6u,Trickarrows,10,Fri May 29 00:13:15 2015 UTC,"And yes the front doesn't load as much because of the bending/ paradox of the arrow as much as the back....because the force of the string pushing the arrow forward comes from the nock end of the arrow.  When picking the correct arrow for a set up we choose based upon a measured static spine. ( on a carbon arrow this is a deflection measured over a 29"" span of the carbon with a 2 lb weight hung In its middle broken Down to tenth a of an inch measurement...500 spine arrow defected 5 tenths or half an inch) We then Make tuning adjustments for our own dynamic spine based upon our particular poundage and release habits...bow center shot...etc. visa vi point weights and overall length of the arrow.

He gives an example of an arrow in flight. He states that in any one (durationless) instant of time, the arrow is neither moving to where it is, nor to where it is not.  It cannot move to where it is not, because no time elapses for it to move there; it cannot move to where it is, because it is already there. In other words, at every instant of time there is no motion occurring. If everything is motionless at every instant, and time is entirely composed of instants, then motion is impossible.

Damped harmonic oscillator of article  Harmonic oscillator:       In real oscillators, friction, or damping, slows the motion of the system. Due to frictional force, the velocity decreases in proportion to the acting frictional force. While simple harmonic motion oscillates with only the restoring force acting on the system, damped harmonic motion experiences friction. In many vibrating systems the frictional force Ff can be modeled as being proportional to the velocity v of the object: Ff = −cv, where c is called the viscous damping coefficient.  Balance of forces (Newton's second law) for damped harmonic oscillators is then     When no external forces are present (i.e. when ), this can be rewritten into the form     where   is called the 'undamped angular frequency of the oscillator' and  is called the 'damping ratio'.   The value of the damping ratio ζ critically determines the behavior of the system. A damped harmonic oscillator can be:   Overdamped (ζ > 1): The system returns (exponentially decays) to steady state without oscillating. Larger values of the damping ratio ζ return to equilibrium slower. Critically damped (ζ = 1): The system returns to steady state as quickly as possible without oscillating (although overshoot can occur). This is often desired for the damping of systems such as doors. Underdamped (ζ < 1): The system oscillates (with a slightly different frequency than the undamped case) with the amplitude gradually decreasing to zero. The angular frequency of the underdamped harmonic oscillator is given by      The Q factor of a damped oscillator is defined as     Q is related to the damping ratio by the equation      Interesting: Quantum harmonic oscillator | Simple harmonic motion | Oscillation | Creation and annihilation operators   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

I took out all of the constants b/c they make it messy, but the problem essentially looks like x''-x''*x'=F, where x'' is the second derivative of its displacement, x' is the first derivative, and F is the constant force you apply to the toilet paper.

Constant angular acceleration (and constant linear acceleration) leads to d being proportional to   a*t^2   Thus, d is quadratic with time, and equal to 0 when t equals 0. d is linear with force, and equal to 0 when F_pull equals F_friction.  Locally we assume that the moment of inertia and the radius of the tp roll does not change significantly with d.  F_friction is probably a function of the angle that you pull on the tp at, and is probably minimized by pulling straight up, but this is neglecting the weight of your arm, and neglecting the weight of the tp that you've pulled off of the roll.   Assuming friction coefficient lower than 1, I believe that if the tp hangs straight down a long-enough length of it will induce spontaneous unrolling, and this might be a fraction of the total length of the tp on the roll. The fraction may be determined by the coefficient of friction."

This contraction (more formally called Lorentz contraction or Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction after Hendrik Lorentz and George FitzGerald) is usually only noticeable at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. Length contraction is only in the direction parallel to the direction in which the observed body is travelling. This effect is negligible at everyday speeds, and can be ignored for all regular purposes. Only at greater speeds does it become relevant. At a speed of 13,400,000 m/s (30 million mph, 0.0447c), the contracted length is 99.9% of the length at rest; at a speed of 42,300,000 m/s (95 million mph, 0.141c), the length is still 99%. As the magnitude of the velocity approaches the speed of light, the effect becomes dominant, as can be seen from the formula:    Image i     Interesting: Trouton–Rankine experiment | Kennedy–Thorndike experiment | Bell's spaceship paradox | Bondi k-calculus   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Physics,37l7et,numbersloth,3,Thu May 28 13:02:13 2015 UTC,"Don't know if this thread is still open, but I'll shoot.   I'm a college student who just finished my first year. I took Physics and multivariable calculus my first semester, intending to be a physics/math double major with a philosophy minor and go to grad school. After getting a B in both classes, I had a complete nervous breakdown and took really weird classes my second semester. I still have a chance to be a physics/math double major but I am majorly questioning my decision.   I'm really good at humanities (esp. philosophy) and I took a practice LSAT on a whim and scored really high, so I'm conflicted. I always imagined myself as a professor, especially one of math or physics, but I'm afraid I'm not cut out for the field. Its very competitive, and not only am I not a naturally competitive person, I also have never had a natural knack for math though I have a lot of tenacity and drive. I've always been capable with hard work (I got a B in multivariable but I didn't study as much as I usually do... I don't know why), but I am afraid that at a certain point I will come to the end of my ability and hard work will no longer be enough, leaving me behind all the kids who have done math olympiad and the likes.  I also could just major in CS (I did like the intro courses), but being a software engineer sounds really boring and depressing TBH... I'm just not necessarily a fan of where I see the tech industry going right now. I feel like being a software engineer is something I would enjoy for like five years and then I would be hitting an early midlife crisis.    Since physics is so competitive right now, I just don't want to put myself in a position where I have a physics degree, a bad GPA, and no job prospects, but I also want to follow my heart into academia.   Any advice? Anyone been in a similar position?"
Physics,37l7et,VeryLittle,2,Fri May 29 21:44:13 2015 UTC,"Any advice? Anyone been in a similar position?   Everyone is always in a similar position. Here's some life advice not related to physics or math or school: what ever you think your plans are, they aren't. There's no way to predict your life years in advance or to control where it goes, so don't worry about it. Also, you've still got three more years of college - relax, breathe. Freshman year isn't that big of a deal.   What you can do is get it on a track in a direction you want it to go. If you think you want to be a professor some day, and if that interests you, then get on the track. You can always get off later if you change your mind, and getting off that track doesn't mean all that distance was wasted. Journey, not the destination.    Since physics is so competitive right now, I just don't want to put myself in a position where I have a physics degree, a bad GPA, and no job prospects, but I also want to follow my heart into academia.    You basically have 2 options at this point: do physics and math for another semester and see how that goes, or don't. I'm not talking about majoring in it, I'm just talking about next semester. If you drop now then maybe your GPA will be better next semester, but maybe not, but if you keep on going then I guarantee you you'll be working harder in even harder classes.   By the way, a B won't kill you- everyone gets a B or C here and there in college. There's so much more to your education than GPA, especially as a physicist."

For rotating planet-like extended bodies, tidal friction is a more relevant source of orbit changes.  For example, the moon causes tides on the earth.  Since the earth rotates about 28x faster than the moon orbits, the tides move from place to place on the earth, causing the earth to lose rotational energy to friction.  The moon-earth orbit actually gains some of that energy: the moon is slowly moving away from the earth.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon#Tidal_evolution"

Physics,37kwo5,ThickTarget,3,Thu May 28 14:34:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right, that is how to do science. The problem Le Verrier had is that he didn't accept the falsification of his theory.

The wikipedia page here looks like a good place to learn more about this."
Physics,37gjai,coav,1 point,Thu May 28 07:56:58 2015 UTC,"So I suppose you must mean the stuff like |ψ> = a|0> + b|1>.  I'm pretty sure he'll go into this at some point, but anything written as |ψ> is a vector, which at first you can think of as a collection of numbers. In this first equation he's just saying that some vector |ψ> is characterized by two numbers, a and b. |0> and |1> are the two basis vectors, i.e. the two basic directions that the vector can point in, and so a and b describe how much of the vector points in those directions. So to make the analogy clearer, we could write a general vector in a 2d plane as |r> = a|x> + b|y>, which is probably closer to something you've seen before. However, keep in mind that unlike in that example, the vectors in QM are made of complex numbers instead of real numbers, and this kind of vector notation is usually only used for these complex vectors. Another point worthy of stressing, which I'm sure the document will get to, is that a vector |ψ> is really something that shouldn't depend on any particular details of how it's represented. So you could also write something like |r> = c|x+y> + d|x-y>, and still be talking about the same |r>, just written in terms of a different coordinate system. That's something that plays a very crucial role in QM.  I'd be very interested in how well this document can teach somebody whose new to this stuff, so by all means let me know how you get on with it."

The delayed choice is important here. Because the choice as to which slit the particle went through (right only, left only, or both) is made only after the particle travels through the slit.

Physics,37i9fy,Synj3d,2,Thu May 28 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"Delayed choice quantum eraser:       A delayed choice quantum eraser, first performed by Yoon-Ho Kim, R. Yu, S.P. Kulik, Y.H. Shih and Marlan O. Scully,  and reported in early 1999, is an elaboration on the quantum eraser experiment that incorporates concepts considered in Wheeler's delayed choice experiment. The experiment was designed to investigate peculiar consequences of the well-known double slit experiment in quantum mechanics as well as the consequences of quantum entanglement.  The delayed choice quantum eraser experiment investigates a paradox. If a photon manifests itself as though it had come by a single path to the detector, then ""common sense"" (which Wheeler and others challenge) says it must have entered the double-slit device as a particle. If a photon manifests itself as though it had come by two indistinguishable paths, then it must have entered the double-slit device as a wave. If the experimental apparatus is changed while the photon is in mid‑flight, then the photon should reverse its original ""decision"" as to whether to be a wave or a particle. Wheeler pointed out that when these assumptions are applied to a device of interstellar dimensions, a last-minute decision made on earth on how to observe a photon could alter a decision made millions or even billions of years ago.  Delayed choice experiments have uniformly confirmed the seeming ability of measurements made on photons in the present to alter events occurring in the past. On the other hand, if a photon in flight is interpreted as being in a so-called ""superposition of states,"" i.e. if it is interpreted as something that has the potentiality to manifest as a particle or wave, but during its time in flight is neither, then there is no time paradox.

Because of that, physicists deny that these particles are capable of impacting the results in any significant way. This same mentality is used to support GR and SR.

The act of creating a low pressure point on one side of something will cause it to move in that direction but the low pressure is not causing it to move. The unbalanced force of the high pressure on the other side causes the movement.

Physics,37bjt9,Hemb,2,Wed May 27 05:39:16 2015 UTC,Yes lower pressure exerts less force than higher pressure. The mathematical definition of pressure is force divided by area.

It pulls the screwdriver up, and it pulls air from the sides in, and pulls air from above down.  You can see this with his example of a bag being caught behind a truck.  The low pressure zone behind the truck is applying a force to the air around it, keeping the bag in; it also applies a force to the truck, which the truck barely notices.

Physics,37bjt9,Watley,1 point,Wed May 27 00:30:00 2015 UTC,"Your source does not make the claim you are making.  The Bernoulli equation is simply Newton's third law applied to an incompressible, inviscid fluid. If real air flow met these assumptions, this equation would completely describe lift generated for uniform flow over an airfoil. Since air is not a perfect fluid, typically correction factors are used particularly to account for compressible flow for relatively high speed aircraft (> 100 m/s) and viscous corrections for low Reynolds numbers.   For proof just watch a plane fly upside down.   Bernoulli's equation is equally valid for an aircraft flying upside down. I think where your confusion lies is that the lift on the aircraft is not completely generated by the camber of the airfoil, it is also a function of the angle of attack."
Physics,37bjt9,El_Q-Cumber,1 point,Wed May 27 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"Your source does not make the claim you are making.   Huh? My point was that the equation is not the full story, then you went on to describe the corrections needed to make it work. I suppose that if we call all compressible flow equations Bernoullie's equation then it would be accurate to say that airfoil lift is due to it, but every equation I have come across called 'Bernoullie's equation' or 'Bernoullie's principle' has been the simplified version.  If I wanted to be completely accurate with my original statement it would be 'lift is not due to asymetric curvature causing different flow rates, otherwise symmetric wing designs would not work.'"
Physics,37bjt9,ergzay,1 point,Wed May 27 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"Well I guess my confusion lies in that you said flying upside down is the case that makes Bernoulli's equation not the full story.  To me flying upside down has little or nothing to do with the limitations of Bernoulli's equation, where as high speed and low Reynolds number applications do.  I guess I agreed with your assessment, but not your example to illustrate your assessment."
Physics,37bjt9,denissimov,1 point,Wed May 27 02:41:18 2015 UTC,Bernoulli's equation is completely invalid for aircraft. It accounts for very little of the lift force and is mainly caused by the effect of the angle of attack of the aircraft wing. The angle of attack of the aircraft wing re-directs air flow downward with laminar flow along the top of the wing also angling the air downward. It's wrong to teach it and doesn't explain wings at all.  Good article here: http://amasci.com/wing/airfoil.html
Physics,37bjt9,El_Q-Cumber,2,Wed May 27 04:21:37 2015 UTC,The source that you provided is confusing. First it says that there is two sides of the story aka Bernoulli and Newton. Then it says that neither contradict each other. So I'm right.
Physics,37bjt9,deathmaster4035,1 point,Wed May 27 05:26:02 2015 UTC,"From your source that you provided:   Air velocity and Bernoulli's equation also explains 100% of the lift.   Please note that his ""popular explanation"" is not the position I hold and is very flawed (as he points out).  I'll provide another source that explains common misconceptions of lift. From Anderson, Introduction to Flight Seventh Edition page 410. Note that the square brackets are my words explaining what he is referencing.   The following alternative explanation [to the Bernoulli equation]: The wing deflects the airflow so that the mean velocity vector behind the wing is canted slightly downward. Hence, the wing imparts a downward component of momentum to the air; that is, the wing exerts a force on the air, pushing the flow downwards. From Newton's third law, the equal and opposite reaction produces lift...   This seems to be your explanation, correct me if I'm wrong. This is a completely valid way of looking at it, however, Anderson goes on:   ... However, this explanation really involves the effect of lift, not the cause. In reality, the air pressure on the surface is pushing on the surface, creating lift in an upward direction... the pressure distribution itself is the fundamental cause of lift.   Now, how does that pressure distribution get there? Well, let's get to your point:   the lift force and is mainly caused by the effect of the angle of attack of the aircraft wing.   Yes, this is accurate 100%. The angle of attack has more of an influence on lift than the camber of the aircraft (hence why aircraft can fly upside down. You can see this by looking at a lift-curve slope. The camber of the airfoil is responsible for the α_L, which causes some lift to occur at zero angle of attack. As you can see, the angle of attack primarily causes changes in lift coefficient.  However, the following was not correct:   Bernoulli's equation is completely invalid for aircraft. It accounts for very little of the lift force and is mainly caused by the effect of the angle of attack of the aircraft wing.   Bernoulli's equation is valid for aircraft (assuming incompressible and inviscid flow, which is a reasonable assumption for flight less than 100 m/s). Bernoulli's equation makes no assumption about the shape or angle of attack of an object, or even if there is another object at all.  Just so we're on the same page, let's define the Bernoulli equation.   pressure + 1/2 * density * velocity2 = constant along a streamline   That is all it is. This equation predicts the pressure on the airfoil if the pressure and velocity are known upstream and the velocity is know at every location on the airfoil. If the air speeds up, the pressure decreases. If the air slows down, the pressure increases. A combination of the shape and orientation of the airfoil (camber and angle of attack) cause these velocity changes.  This works for any angle of attack as long as the flow doesn't separate (causing stall).  Source: Am aerospace engineer."

On re-entry the speed of the vehicle will reach supersonic levels , so a shockwave will form instead. This will cause immense drag and if the shape of the vehicle is like the one shown here, the vehicle would probably disintegrate from the drag and the generated heat. This is probably the reason why you see most spaceships to have pointed noses and have such streamlined profiles. They are literally built to avoid this."

Yet, after the discovery of the Higgs boson, the time scale for major experimental results is growing to be fractions of a lifetime. The next major collider after the LHC will begin in 2040 — at the earliest.  This is a long time to wait for a theoretical physicist who needs experimental results to validate theories.   Source: https://www.quora.com/How-did-Jay-Wacker-get-recruited-to-Quora  Now, in some sense, ""high energy physics"" is ""true"" physics, in the tradition of Newton and Einstein: it's where we learn what the fundamental ""laws of physics"" are.  Other areas of physics, in principle, take current our current understanding of the laws of physics as granted and work out the consequences.  (This is of course an oversimplification of what actually happens in real life, but it's morally true.)  Of course that leaves other areas of physics, and of course there are people who are more optimistic about the potential for experimental results in high-energy physics or about the potential to progress purely mathematically."

Phenomena in condensed matter physics are usually either very difficult or impossible to predict from ""basic"" theory. Also, condensed matter and particle theory are mathematically closely related. For example the Higgs mechanism comes from the theory of superconductivity.  On the other hand, we know that what we consider particle physics is just an effective theory at the energy scale of our biggest collider. So high energy physics is not what you would call ""true"" physics, as long as we cannot unify particle physics and gravity."

Things like solid state physics, including both solid state electronics and material research are extremely unlikely to ""die"" due to the gigantic range of applications in all of modern technology.  The same goes for ""quantum electronics"" aka laser physics.  Nuclear physics won't die as long as the military wants weapons with which they can wipe out all life on the planet within seconds.  Various subfields of physics have found important application in medicine, now referred to as Medical Physics. As long as people use MRIs, this subfield cannot die.  A lot of chemistry is dependent on physics, e.g. NMR depends on strong superconducting magnets.

However, the probabilities that these properties take on certain values may be predicted. So you're right, given QM (which is what is currently accepted as true), no deterministic outcome of the fate of the universe or anything in it can be computed.  However I'm not sure if determinism should be considered a ""high school level understanding of physical reality""; remember that we stand on the shoulders of giants when learning about QM today."

Put it this way, in every simulation of a quantum systems variation over time you will likely have a different outcome, BUT, every single one of these simulations is of a singular system, disregarding potential influence from external systems.

Physics,37fj8h,david55555,-2,Wed May 27 12:19:38 2015 UTC,"Does QM assert the universe is not deterministic?   Asking if the Universe is deterministic is a fundamentally counterfactual question.  In order to answer it I have to posit (what for me and anyone in the universe) is a counterfactual, namely the existence of another universe identical in all respects to ours. And then compare the evolution of the two universes over time to see if they diverge from each other or not.  A slightly different phrasing of the underlying intended question is: ""Are the laws of physics deterministic or non-deterministic"" and in that case the answer (for now) is that one can interpret the equations pretty much however they want. You can have a non-deterministic view of QM such as the Copenhagen interpretation, or you can throw out various principles like locality or realism and have a deterministic interpretation of those equations. Which you prefer is kinda up to you.   Isn't the uncertainty principle just a statement about interference of a measuring device with that which is measured?   It can be interpreted as such. In which case you are headed down the road of tossing out locality. I can't repeat an experiment because the measurement is entangled with the experimental apparatus, and the apparatus is entangled with previous instances of the apparatus, or with some other thing... in other words the entire notion of a ""controlled experiment"" is a bit of a red herring. We can try to limit the degree to which our experiments fail to be ""controlled experiments"" but whatever slight failures we make might cause a particle to measure as spin up instead of spin down."

Physics,37bnep,WhatWouldIHavetoDo,3,Tue May 26 15:48:56 2015 UTC,"you can have fast fission too.  It depends upon the particular nuclide.  U-235 likes thermal/slow neutrons but U-238 likes fast Neutrons.    Each nucleus has a specific cross for absorption for each energy of the neutron, where the cross section for absorption is like a target or dart board of a particular radius.  For U-235, that radius is bigger for slow neutrons than it is for fast neutrons.  For U-238, that radius is bigger for fast neutrons than it is for slow neutrons.  Fission reactors use u-235.  When U-235 fissions, it emits fast neutrons.  However, the reactor contains a moderator(typically water) that the neutrons collide with and that slows down the neutrons to thermal levels.   Water works as an effective moderator because hydrogen is similar in mass to neutrons, such that you get maximum energy transfer from each hydrogen/neutron collision.  The moderator also cools the reactor and carries heat to a steam generator.  The steam generator has tubes which transfer heat from the moderator and provide it to secondary water in the steam generator.  The secondary water boils and creates steam, which is fed to turbines to create electricity or motive power.  The steam is condensed and fed back to the steam generator.  When the steam generator cools the moderator water, it makes the moderator water denser, which cases it to become a more effective moderator (slower downer) of neutrons and thereby provides positive reactivity to the reactor causing the reactor to become super-critical (its reaction rate increases).  The increased reaction rate heats the water and reduces the reactivity, allowing the reactor to self control for small power changes."

Now if instead of having a spring we consider the gravitational effect of the two masses, do we have 3 or 4 terms i.e two kinetic terms + the gravitational potential of mass 1 and the gravitational potential of mass 2.   Or in the same way we talk about the spring having the potential do we just attribute one potential term to the field. I'm pretty sure its the latter but I am not sure of the justification."
Physics,37bnep,eewallace,3,Wed May 27 00:03:45 2015 UTC,"If you're only talking about the gravitational interaction between the two masses, there's a single potential energy associated with that interaction, so it's three terms in the Lagrangian. When you talk abou t a mass in a gravitational potential, you're implicitly talking about the gravitational interaction between that mass and another one (at a fixed position). Potential energy is always associated with an interaction between two (or more) objects."
Physics,37bnep,shaun252,1 point,Wed May 27 00:24:21 2015 UTC,So is right to talk about the potential energy of a single spring in the original example I gave?
Physics,37bnep,eewallace,1 point,Wed May 27 23:01:12 2015 UTC,"In that case, you've got an idealized spring (massless, exactly obeying Hooke's Law), which is basically just a representation of a particular force between two masses, so ""the potential energy of the spring"" is essentially the same as ""the potential energy associated with the linear force between the two masses"", just a lot less cumbersome. If you want to be a bit more careful, I'd call it the potential energy of the system of the two masses and the spring, but that case is usually pretty unambiguous, anyway; if you wanted to deal with a massive spring, it might warrant some more careful thought.  The important point in both cases (the gravitational interaction between two objects and two objects connected by a spring) is that the potential energy only depends on the distance between the two bodies (not separately on their coordinates with respect to something else) and that there's a single potential energy associated with the system, not a separate one for each body."
Physics,37bnep,Mister_F1zz3r,1 point,Wed May 27 23:34:53 2015 UTC,"Would this analogy be accurate?  Potential energy is the energy stored in the interaction of two objects, and kinetic energy is (kinda) like self interaction, where it only depends on itself.  Potential energies such as springs, gravity (inverse-square laws) work this way, potential scalar and vector fields also follow this. Are there exceptions?  (Also could this analogy be extended to energies/interactions dependent on three bodies?)"
Physics,37bnep,eewallace,2,Thu May 28 23:04:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think that's a reasonable way of thinking about it. The idea of kinetic energy as a self-interaction is more accurate than you might expect in some ways; that's very similar to how it's treated in particle physics.  That picture should be valid for any force that can be described by a potential energy. If you've taken vector calculus, you've probably encountered the idea of a conservative vector field, which is a vector field that can be described as the gradient of a scalar function, has no curl, and it's path integral between two points is independent of the actual path taken (those conditions are equivalent - any one of them implies the others). Whether that sounds familiar or not, you can apply that definition to a force, and say that a conservative force is one that can be described as the (negative) gradient of a scalar function (which is what we call the potential). So for the inverse square law forces, the potential goes as 1/r, and the force goes like the ""charge"" times 1/r2 in the radial direction. The ""charge"" is the actual electric charge for electrostatics, the mass for gravity, the spring constant for Hooke's Law, and so on. Generally (with a caveat below), any force that conserves the combined energy of the objects involved in the interaction satisfies those conditions, which I believe is the origin of the ""conservative vector field"" terminology.  Any force that explicitly doesn't conserve energy, such as frictional forces, collisions between solid bodies that lose energy to heat and sound, etc, cannot be described in terms of a scalar potential and therefore doesn't have a well-defined potential energy.  The Lorentz force on a charged particle moving in a static magnetic field is an interesting case. It doesn't obviously meet the above criteria, but it does conserve energy. You can define a scalar potential for permanent magnets, but that doesn't work in the general case. In terms of the fundamental interaction, relativistically , the scalar electric potential and the magnetic vector potential are described as a spacetime 4-vector, and with the appropriate 4D extensions of the gradient, curl, and so on, the above relations work out.  tl;dr there is that the idea of potential energy as the energy involved in an interaction between two objects is fine for any interaction that can be described by a potential (which basically means any conservative force).  For many-body interactions, you can take the potential energy of the system as the sum of the potential energies of the interactions between pairs of bodies, as long as you're careful not to double count. That is, if you have three bodies, you have 3 terms in the sum, not 6."
Physics,37bnep,Mister_F1zz3r,1 point,Fri May 29 00:47:33 2015 UTC,"Cool. I'm glad my intuition is on track. (I got my bachelor's already, but I never thought of potential and kinetic energy this way before.)  Is there a well-known conceptual way of looking at the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian that I'm overlooking? The Hamiltonian is obviously just the total energy of a system, so changes in time of H mean that energy is flowing into or out of the system (also Schroedinger). The Lagrangian always seemed like the balance between the two energy types, such that derivatives of the Lagrangian wrt q and q_dot give the position and velocity responses to shifts between potential and kinetic energy. Sound about right?"
Physics,37bnep,eewallace,1 point,Fri May 29 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"I don't have any particularly good conceptual explanation for the Lagrangian. In quantum field theory, there's an analogy to stat mech, where qft path integrals in Minkowski space are related to partition functions in four spatial dimensions, and there the Lagrangian plays a role analogous to the Helmholtz free energy, but I don't know how well that carries over to classical mechanics."
Physics,37bnep,Mister_F1zz3r,1 point,Fri May 29 16:49:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I suppose actually grokking what the Helmholtz free energy is would help too. It's futs, right? F = U-TS? I suppose that kinda works like a balance between internal energy and temperature energy. Internal versus external. Hm. Intensive versus extensive? Nah.  Looking into Helmholtz Free Energy again, (hey it's been a year) the free energy is a tip off. The way I see it, F is the amount of free energy or usable energy attainable from the system. When F = 0, no work can be done without inputting and equal or greater amount. If F > 0 it can be used until F = 0.  The Lagrangian is used with the principle of least action, such that the integral of L wrt time is called the 'action'. Euler-Lagrange equations minimize the integrand, and therefore L is minimized for natural systems. Following from the Helmholtz Free Energy definition above, the Lagrangian can be thought of in terms of available action to be minimized. If L = 0, does that mean that the action is minimized no matter what happens in the system? Then again, the constraint that T = V is very restrictive."
Physics,37bnep,eewallace,1 point,Fri May 29 18:12:51 2015 UTC,"I'd be a bit careful about putting too much weight on the free energy analogy. I'm not really sure how deep a connection there is, but they're certainly not the same.  Remember that in Lagrangian mechanics, you're minimizing the action over paths in configuration space. If L=0 for all configuration space, then there's no minimum of the action. But I think the only way that can happen is for the kinetic and potential terms to vanish separately, so it's the Lagrangian for a ""system"" of no particles."

I usually personally recommend knowing c++, python, and, possibly, a symbolic language (probably MATHEMATICA) for group theory type stuff. Also, you shouldn't be afraid by FORTRAN as a lot of code was written decades ago, and no one is going to spend time to rewrite code in a slower language (FORTRAN is pretty much the fastest at everything).

If you're looking at a course on them, out on group theory generally, I'd say it's probably worthwhile, especially if you're planning on grad school in physics, but not essential. Group theory is also useful in solid state and chemical physics for understanding crystal structures in terms of their symmetry groups, but those aren't generally lie groups.  How useful it would be may also depend on what particular areas of physics you're interested in and what upper level electives you think you might want to to take.

Assuming it is a theory that unifies the two branches and that provides testable predictions and easier means for calculating orbits"
Physics,37bnep,eewallace,4,Tue May 26 17:40:20 2015 UTC,"Depends what you mean by ""know"". It certainly wouldn't take long to hear about the candidate theory. Theorists don't tend to be bashful when it comes to advertising their work, especially if they think it's a promising candidate for a major breakthrough.  As far as actual experimental confirmation, most likely years. Given how well the standard model and general relativity describe known physics, and how high the expected energy-scale for unification is (usually thought to be the Planck scale), it's unlikely that any predictions would be immediately testable. If it offered a nice explanation for some outstanding anomaly (I can't think of any good candidates - maybe something to do with ultra-high-energy cosmic rays?), that would certainly give it a boost, but it would almost certainly not be enough of a smoking gun to consider it a solved problem.  As an analogous situation, think about general relativity. When Einstein first presented it as a full theory in 1915, it provided a unification of Newtonian gravity and special relativity, and it correctly predicted the anomalous precession of the perihelion of Mercury's orbit, which was a known outstanding problem. But it was 4 years before there was any real experimental confirmation, and only that soon because there happened to be a solar eclipse soon enough in a place that was accessible for observation. And even that was relatively weak evidence, and the precision tests that led to it being accepted as firmly as it is as didn't start coming for another 40 years after that.  Granted, a lot of the predictions of particle physics have been able to be tested much more promptly than that, but those are much stronger interactions, with productions at much more accessible scales. Quantum gravity effects are likely to concern phenomena at much higher energies (likely beyond the reach of manmade accelerators) and/or in much stronger gravitational fields than we can easily probe. So you'd probably hear about the theory pretty quickly, but not see any firm experimental confirmation for a long time. It may even turn out that one of the candidates that's been around for decades (like string theory or loop quantum gravity) will turn out to be right."

As I understand it, the Rieman tensor can be seen as a set of partial differential equations with a wave function solution, where gravitational waves are waves of curvature. However, it is hard to see how curvature can be a medium for wave propagation.  Accordingly, I think that there must be a more fundamental wave that curvature waves are a representation of.  The medium for gravitational wave propagation must be energy density and gravitational waves must correspond to the more fundamental waves of energy density. The two sorts of waves should have some type of transform to shift between the two representations.  Indeed, energy density waves could have all the qualities of sound waves. You should be able to have P and S type energy density waves.   Also, an oscillating energy density will necessarily provide an oscillating space curvature.  Indeed, It may be that each elementary particle is a solution to the energy density differential equations and that the particles' true nature is as standing energy density/gravitational waves."

Its called higher curvature because it involves higher powers of the Riemann tensor and its contractions.    Some words about the theories.  These theories generally involve third or higher derivatives of the metric.  Often the higher curvature terms represent ""topological data"", this means that they don't provide dynamical degrees of freedom but instead tell you something about the overall ""shape"" of spacetime in a very general sense, i.e. is it a ball, a doughnut, or something.  Often the identification of these terms as topological terms depends on the dimension of the spacetime you're looking at.  Because of this higher curvature gravities might give the same degrees of freedom as standard GR in 4 dimensions but behave differently in higher dimensions.

The first point being, when I first saw that box in E&M, I had no clue what it was. A lot of people still don't - it's not all that common in literature. Maybe it'll help someone smarter than I figure out what's going on in those equations. The second point being, we often see derivatives of metric tensor in context of the EFEs.

Just for the background, there's literally thousands of those theories, including f(R) gravity, Gauss-Bonnet, bimetric gravity, Brans-Dicke, massive gravity etc. Each of them tries to explore the consequences of modifying the GR Lagrangian that is still consistent with current observations. The goal is usually to explain dark matter and/or dark energy. This is a very active area of research in classical GR and cosmology, and the models get progressively constrained by the observations of the CMB, large scale structure, black holes and other strongly gravitating systems.  This particular theory seems to predict an additional longitudinal mode for the gravitational waves. I'm not sure how viable this actually is, but in principle the first detection of the pure GR waves is expected within 2 years by the LIGO collaboration. One of their long-term goals is also to constrain modified theories, such as the one argued by Nash. I think he was interested in all this from the viewpoint of the PDE analysis, however his understanding of the physics behind the equations seems quite lacking (to which he openly admitted in the papers)."

[...]     Then MAYBE our Lagrangian, dependent simply on Rij and R, could be rederived or re-interpreted in terms of the new Rij, etc. And then also a system of equations COULD derive as Euler-Lagrange equations derived from that. Or a favorable FORMAL generalization might exist.  In any case, it seems interesting to consider what sort of equations for the electromagnetic field would be derived AND whether or not a natural sort of gravitating action of the electromagnetic fields would appear.   I think he was trying to draw logic from the Einstein—Maxwell equations (self gravitating EM waves) to spit back out a new wave equation. From the image you can see it's a vacuum equation, as there's no stress-energy content involved. His notes confirm that Gab is the Einstein tensor, so that explains why we see squares of the Ricci scalar in the Lagrangian.  Found the PDF writeup of the ""general equation""    Here's an interesting tidbit,     But since the equations describing electromagnetic waves do admit of the consistent possibility of non-transverse waves one is thus given a clue to wonder about the possibility of equations formally admitting the possibility of compressional gravitational waves.

Realistically there is a slightly different psf for each point in the field of view.  If you're just out to have fun, I wouldn't worry about it, just blur, bin, and add noise.  But if you want to get into it, it's a very rewarding field, good for hours of enjoyment.  ps.  Convolution in position space is multiplication in spatial-frequency space.

So if your aberration functions can each be expressed as convolution (which yours can't) then ... well ... you know.  edit:  thinking about it, I bet you're trying measure the systematic error on your fitting SW--good on you.

Honestly, soak up as much as you can during the summer while having fun. You'll learn the material in class regardless, but the more you see it, the more you internalize the concepts.

So go to your local library and check out a calculus/physics book or buy a cheap one at a garage sale/used book place. Watch lectures from MIT or stanford. Do lots of problems, get to know the material well.  But don't wear yourself down over the summer. Always keep it fun. The biggest thing to do over the summer is to keep the motivation and drive to do what you want to do."

Physics,37938c,Jupednine,2,Tue May 26 01:10:55 2015 UTC,"Math recommendation:  Get a solid handle on precalc (what I was taught as ""precalc"" is essentially a mix of college algebra and trig; I've tutored math and this seems to be the case at a lot of US schools) first, then learn calculus or linear algebra.  Most students learn calculus before linear algebra, but it doesn't really matter which comes first. MIT's OCW has excellent resources for both. My personal recommendation would be to go through both calculus and linear algebra before differential equations, as most differential equations courses include a segment on systems of equations, and that particular section is much more satisfying if you understand linear algebra already."

It's goal is to eventually collect introductory guides for any and all subjects, but right now contains guides for basic math and physics.  You can use these bibliographies to find useful books, notes, and videos on elementary calculus, general physics, and some of the basic subtopics.  Take a look - you might find it useful.  If you've never taken university-level math or physics, then I would recommend starting with calculus (assuming you've taken high school-level algebra, trigonometry, and analytic geometry) and then moving on to calculus-based general physics.  You should find old editions of the standard textbooks, read through them, and spend time solving most if not all of the problems at the end of each chapter.  Stay motivated, do a little bit each day, and have fun with it.  You'll be surprised at how much progress you can make."

It's a bit hard knowing what advice to give because I don't know how old you are and what stage you're at.1 But if I'm allowed to assume you haven't applied to universities yet (but will reasonably soon), I'd start keeping an eye out for what universities seem to have good research groups, good people, and the resources to support solid project work when you do start. University-hunting is fun (until you actually have to start making decisions!)  My main advice: do some of these problems, if you can, and any others like them you come across. Now these are university-level problems, so they are going to be hard. But you seem to have drive, so I think you'll appreciate them.   1 I understand if you don't want to give out your age, of course."

It doesn't all seem literally trivial, but the results seem a bit inevitable given the basic mathematical structures involved. It's not crackpot stuff or anything, but I'm not sure that it actually gets these structures out in an interesting way. What about how those structures are derived prevents it from 'only' being a repackaging of the old insights into gauge theory and ordinary QM?

They haven't derived the standard model, nor general relativity.  And the nerve to add a closing section of philosophical implications for your own theory you're presenting right now. How fucking deluded do you have to be?  I'm sure Finster is a reputable mathematician, but in all honesty in this article they just say ""and then here we plug in the leptons of the SM"" or ""and then here we plug in Einstein's field equations"".
