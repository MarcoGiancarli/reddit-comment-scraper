YMS,3e144b,Indycoone,2,Tue Jul 21 04:29:35 2015 UTC,"I have this film on Blu-ray and it's been a while since I've seen it, so I can only remember and input so much.  I agree with you on the lack of flow and how some scenes were significant and then suddenly we'd see a long and drawn out scene with very slow pacing and no large conclusion. Perhaps there's some development missing that we're just not seeing in the first viewing.  Some of these slow scenes, however, had fantastic dialogue and excellent conflicts between characters. I agree that their place in the movie is questionable enough to the plot to where it can cause a drop in the rating, but some such scenes were at least enjoyable.  2.5 hours is indeed too long of a movie for the point it was trying to make. In fact, it's difficult to decipher exactly what point it was trying to make. As far as I know, the heavily discussed ""beauty"" is intended to relate to some kind of sexual awakening or experience of youth. I could be wrong ... but if I'm not, then I think we've discovered quite possibly the most Italian film ever made.   Was it worth the Palme d'Or? Maybe not. It was a good film, but there's really not much for us to relate to. It's about high-life people experiencing mid-life questions. There's a lot more that could have been done to develop more characters even further on an emotional level. It appeared as if the characters sought after and discussed long-lost emotions, but by the end of the film, not many emotions have been found or re-experienced. It feels somewhat inconclusive.  I really need to see it again for a more in-depth analysis to be certain of how I see the film.  7.5 / 10 for me from my current knowledge of it."
YMS,3e144b,Gadsa2,2,Tue Jul 21 03:58:10 2015 UTC,"I totally think that the 2.5 hour running time ruined the film entirely. There were some great things said about classism and history and the cinematography was great, but theres not enough to sustain that length. I'm sick of people comparing him to Fellini. They are both Italian and have a sense of humour but Sorrentino is way too self-indulgent."
YMS,3e144b,TheBosma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:44:06 2015 UTC,"Have you seen Fellini's 8 1/2? I found it to be a lot like that. Disjointed, sure, but that's because each individual segment of the story is like a stepping stone for understanding the main character. As the film goes on, the realization is coming to him that at the end of it all, maybe his novel truly means nothing. Each stepping stone felt well used to me, and I honestly don't remember it feeling super long. I probably need to see it again, as it's been a while. I get that it isn't for everyone though!"
YMS,3e144b,Gadsa2,0,Tue Jul 21 04:50:42 2015 UTC,"I dont get the fellini comparison. Like obviously he draws influence but just because they are both directors who make films about art doesnt mean much... is it because he's italian? Like if you're putting these two films together then would we then put SNY in there too? Birdman? Mia Madre? I dont see the comparison at all. Fellini always had something to say, I feel that Sorrentino relies on cinematography way too much, and even then,  his compositions aren't stunning, he relies on the location way too much. Still great looking though, I just didnt get it and I dont get the whole Fellini comparison after seeing 8 1/2 like 9 times"
YMS,3e144b,TheBosma,2,Tue Jul 21 13:27:39 2015 UTC,"The Fellini comparison is mostly in the way the story is told. Again, only really comparing it to 8 1/2, not anything like La Strada. 8 1/2 is told through groupings that provide stepping stones to the end, much like The Great Beauty. Also keep in mind this was my impression when I first saw the great beauty over a year and a half ago. It's been longer since I've seen 8 1/2 so I'm not claiming to be all knowing on this one. The Great Beauty really resonated with me on a story level and the characters kept me very interested."

His camera work is always the bee's knees though."

YMS,3e144b,Ol_li,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:54:12 2015 UTC,"Well- I really liked that movie, for the following reasons:  the comedic flavour he has with his household lady . Also the atmosphere of intimacy he has with the small woman he eats warmed up rice with I like what it says about Art today  The scene at the beginning totally put me off, it was almost unbearably long and overstated, like a coke dream. I love that his character goes such a unique way and he remains positive and never becomes aggressive. Somewhere along the Way, such a sadness slips in, and it is so overwhelming, fueld by the music and cinematography. To me the film is a poem. Very subjective opinion, what else?"
YMS,3e144b,_SeanKlaus_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:03:41 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved ""The Great Beauty"". The cinematography was absolutely fantastic, I would agree the best of the year, it was well-paced and engrossing throughout, with a very surreal vibe, it was funny and heartwrenching, the acting was phonomenal, it has one of the best opening and ending scenes I've ever seen, the direction and screenplay were amazing, and even though certain scenes were somewhat repetitive, I was feel that it was an artistic choice on Sorrentino's part to show how contrived and lifeless the main character's life has become in his search for trying experience the quote on quote ""great beauty"". I think overall its a beautiful, surreal, bizzare, emotionally gripping, and exceptionally well-made picturesque portrait of Italy, and life itself. I'm giving it a 9/10, simply due to that the side characters could've been explored a bit more. Fantastic film."

Enter the Void, in my view, did things no film had done before. Gaspar Noé not only wasn't afraid of negative reviews when he made it, but he actually has said that he likes reading them more than positive ones. This kinda shows, to me at least, that he is completely aware of the flaws with his own films but is willing to have them in order to perfect the bigger picture. Noé is not the best writer in the world, but his incredibly precise visions for his films make him my favorite living director."

It's so style over substance, the acting is good but the writing is terrible. I understand the creativity and that is highly commendable but it's overlong and self indulgent. Noe for me falls under the same umbrella as Von Trier, recent Refn and Recent Tarantino, where the gimmicks and style ARE the movie, and it's almost from a film fan's mind rather than a directors."
YMS,3e1uqu,Gadsa2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:46:45 2015 UTC,"The writing for Enter the Void is kinda excusable (at least in Enter the Void) for two reasons:   Making a movie in a language you have little understanding of is not easy.  The actors improvised a lot of the dialogue in Enter the Void which was also the case with Irreversible. In the case of the latter, the script was a few page outline of things they were going to film.    Not to say you have to love Gaspar Noe, by all means feel free to hate his works. I just wanted to teach you one thing about his films: writing is not always the biggest priority for him."
YMS,3e1uqu,TLWind,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:31 2015 UTC,"I guess my reply to that is; if you  don't know the language well enough to make it sound good, then don't use it, and if the improvised dialogue doesnt add anything to the film, don't use it   If they were stylistic choices then great, but even then, it still doesn't work for me"
YMS,3e1uqu,Gadsa2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:37:21 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I still found the dialogue in Enter the Void to be good. Not anything like Pulp Fiction or 12 Angry Men, but still good."

It's a service that basically puts a subscription system in place for online content creators. People pay a ludicrously low fee (something like $36 a year) and in exchange they get to see stuff early.   The reason why I'm recommending it is because, as of right now, there are no copyright restrictions (that I know of). Vessel discusses with creators on a per-channel basis on whether or not they can be accepted in, so there's no idiots posting music or full length movies to ruin it. They're looking for quality content, which I think is fair to say about your videos.   The tradeoff is to see your videos a little early. Some people delay it on YouTube a week; some people delay it 3 days. You can also choose not to delay it if you have a video that's relevent time-wise (ie. big blockbuster comes out, you make a Quickie). And judging by the fact that you used to do this on your website, you've already tried this before.  EDIT: Alright, guess you guys don't like Vessel then."

It got everything right, and evokes a feeling of exploration unlike any game I've played has, and unlike any other art form really can.   Majora's Mask is also very evocative in my opinion, and has the best gameplay of any Zelda game.   La-Mulana is IMO one of the most undervalued games ever.

It's way more noticeable now than back then but if you pause any scene from Lion King and from any other Disney movie from around the same time you can see the difference. The animations jumped/skipped or the characters moved unrealistically (even by cartoon's standards), the lines were really jagged and, most times, the characters were extremely ""flat"" or with lack of detail. Some of these lapses are widely known, specially after it was revealed that the senior animators left the project to work on Pocahontas (which was another bad and clichéd movie but definitely way superior than Lion King on a technical standpoint)."

I didn't expect the movie to have much of a heart, so when that happened, and during the interrupted funeral where Hesher is confronting the father and son and the they all ""take her for a walk,"" it hit parts of me deeply, fearfully concerned with regret and a kind of living catatonia and this lack of self knowledge almost to the point of refusing it that I was kind of struggling with at the time, and it made me cry not just the hardest I've ever cried at a movie but the hardest I've ever cried in my life. It's not a good movie, and I know if I rewatched it it wouldn't have nearly the same effect, but the surprising heart and the self-confrontation thrown at all three male leads (Hesher confronts himself with the story about the testacle) is something that shook some kind of internal emotional fault line in a very destructive, seismically-moving way."

SPOILERS  Why didn't Joy just send the core memories back to Headquarters through a recall tube in Long Term Memory? That place was full of recall tubes, and it would have solved one of the major conflicts of the film. And why did Joy HAVE to wake Reilly up right away? It's not like things could have gotten any worse while she was asleep. Unless, of course, you deliberately wake her up with a terrifying nightmare.  END SPOILERS  It was a really fun movie though, and some parts made me pretty darn sad and introspective. It also had a good message. I'd give it a solid 7/10.  edit: Couldn't figure out how to tag spoilers in this sub, so I put up a spoiler warning instead."

Plus it's one of the most beautiful and strong movies I've ever seen. I was really overwhelmed by it as someone that cares a lot for those in the world of animation.

YMS,3druix,_SeanKlaus_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:16:12 2015 UTC,"Saw it 2 days ago! Coincidences I guess...  I think it's expertly directed by David Fincher, with for the most part a pretty awesome cast. I'm not a big fan of Daniel Craig as Michael Blompkvist, as I feel he lacked the likeable quality that the character in the book originally had. Speaking of which, some changes they made form the book to the movie were quite distracting imo. For example, Lizbeth not putting Michael's private details in her report (which is completely against her character) or the fact that we barely see Michael struggling to find information and gradually getting interested in the case (which was like 50% of the 1rst book).  It looked nice, it sounded nice, but for the story aspects, the parts that diverged from the book were the weakest. It's above average, pretty great overall."

YMS,3druix,OverlordSt1nG,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:03:54 2015 UTC,The single biggest issue with it is that they seem to have dropped the series. It really bothers me that they started something that they evidently aren't going to finish. It exists as a trilogy. Remaking only the first movie is really annoying.  It's like how Joss Whedon is probably going to stop making Avengers movies. These people need to stop taking on beloved source material that they aren't determined to follow through with.
YMS,3druix,BattleChimp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:54:11 2015 UTC,"The reason why they dropped the trilogy is that Sony decided that ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" was deemed a box office failure in their eyes, so they canceled making the next two. It's nothing to do with the the film's fault, but the company funding and distributing it. It's not that David Fincher wimped out on it. It's that he wants to make more, but the rights are owned by Sony, so they own ""Dragon Tattoo"", and even though they refuse to fund sequels, they won't let Fincher try to have other distributors and companies fund more films. Fincher has attempted multiple times to convince Sony into making more, but they refuse. Fincher really wants to make. Sony doesn't."

I thought it really took a turn for the better around the 4th episode, and if it hadn't I don't think I would have liked it nearly as much. The characters are all really interesting to me, so that probably helps my overall enjoyment of it. It's something I often recommend to people because the first season is just so short. I'm sure if I was willing to nitpick at it I'd find a lot of flaws. There were some performances I wasn't a huge fan of here and there.

The fight scenes were actually really cool and I love the scenes where Michael Pena was explaining where he got the jobs. Those scenes were definitlely Wright inspired. Other than that, the CGI wasn't great for the most part. The characters were boring overall. The villain was especially bland. There's some stuff I didn't like when I watched it but honestly can't remember them now. All in all it isn't terrible. It was a fun way to spend two hours but I wouldn't watch it again.

The effects and macro photography they used impressed me. The story was alright, but there wasn't that much personality to it. Pena's character was by far the best, most Wright-esq character in it.   The villain was alright, not the best, not the worst. The relationship between Pym and his daughter was interesting, but needed more development IMO.  Overall, it's a movie that could've been a trainwreck, but wasn't. more like a train that works just fine, but has a few missing parts and graffiti all over it."

YMS,3dfr0d,AKrocker907,8,Thu Jul 16 04:50:22 2015 UTC,"Eh. I love Port Call New Orleans. I thought it was a great satire on cop movies on their many tropes: anti-hero cop with a drug problem, obligatory love interest etc... I thought the music was intentional as that type of music is usually played in cop movies and the addition of iguanas and the part of the break dancing was to show the insanity of Cage's mind due to his drug addiction. I've only Herzog's Aguirre the Wrath of God, and from there I can tell he is how you would describe Jodorowsky: a director who knows what he wants and doesn't put random stuff in the movie just because."
YMS,3dfr0d,JASON9818,3,Thu Jul 16 04:58:17 2015 UTC,"One thing I like about Port of Call New Orleans is that most of it wasn't solved by the main character, but by sheer luck. And then immediately after getting promoted, he doesn't reform or anything - he goes after another young couple to steal drugs from.  The majority of the movie isn't realistic in the least but seeing good things happen to bad people is something most people can relate."

YMS,3dfr0d,TheCapeMan11,-18,Thu Jul 16 15:24:48 2015 UTC,"Okay, now I'm mad Adam. Well, maybe not mad since you recommended the movie at the end, but really? A remake? This movie has nothing to do with the original film. It's just that the distributors decided to make some money off some ""indie movie filmaker"". That thing happens a lot in the hollywood industry, it's nothing new. And knowing Herzog, I wouldn't be surprised if Herzog was happy about that controversy, because to be honest it adds a little to the movie itself. I feel like this video was a little pointless, since you missed the point of the film. The movie is a big post-irony. Over-the-top and bad acting (Herzog clearly chose Cage because it reminds him of his best friend and long-time collaborator - Klaus Kinski) Hokey plot, glorification of sex and drug use, and at the end what happens? Our anti-hero gets away with everything, and I mean everything. Even better, he gets a really happy ending. If that was truly a remake of the original the reverse would happen. But that's wasn't the remake. It was just a hilarious post-ironic comedy. And if you think that movie was weird - you clearly haven't seen other Herzog works such as Wild Blue Yonder which I'm truly believe you would rate 1/10 on IMDB, and Even Dwarfs Started Small which was a big inspiration (if not a big rip-off) for Harmony Korine's Trash Humpers. It's not a deep movie like the original, it doesn't try to say anything. If anything it only ridicules the American Pop-Culture and the anti-hero genre. But in the end It just's a weird crazy ride with Nicolas Cage and Werner Herzog that it's just pure fun. I really loved it. As for you Adam, I really hope you will watch Herzog's filmography in the future. But probably not, since you only watch modern films. Heh."
YMS,3dfr0d,anUnkindness,30,Thu Jul 16 00:49:43 2015 UTC,I didn't call it a remake. I also included clips that specifically show that it has nothing to do with the original. Where were you?
YMS,3dfr0d,TheCapeMan11,-16,Thu Jul 16 00:51:49 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of that Adam, but you're still trying to compare these two movies, which like I said before - it's a little pointless. The only thing that these two movies have in common is the controversy that caused that thinking. Nothing else. I still appreciate you've watched both of these films and you gave your thoughts on them, even though I disagree with some of the opinions you said about the Herzog's film, but in the end - it's your opinion.

YMS,3dka0x,_SeanKlaus_,9,Thu Jul 16 23:17:18 2015 UTC,"As a critic, you can't say that you don't know why you feel a certain way about a movie. You have to know, and explain it. That's what makes a critique interesting, the reason why something is good or bad.  Also, those are way too short. Explain yourself: why was Les Miserables an unnecessary musical? What makes Battle Royale or Moonrise Kingdom a masterpiece? You can't say that you can talk for hours about it; you have to actually do it.  Make my reading worthwhile. Impress me with your insight. Make me see the movie in a different light. Analyse it, and tell me what you found. This is how you'll improve."
YMS,3dka0x,SpadesFairy,3,Fri Jul 17 01:15:45 2015 UTC,I'm not Adam.  Don't you have a little more to say on each film? Why do you think Battle Royal is a masterwork for example?
YMS,3dka0x,we45terg,2,Thu Jul 16 23:22:51 2015 UTC,"Your reviews looks like a quick summery at the end of a review too conclude your thoughts and feelings.   What's wrong with Fargo? (Like seriously, what?) Why is Les miserables an unnecessary musical? (How can a musical be unnecessary? Like how? a musical is just expression through music and song whether it be dialogue or emotions)   You need too explain. You can't just quote pulp fiction, You can't just call Brave mediocre, explain where it lacks without spoiling. (Character, suspense, etc.)  Read some critics such as Ebert or even watch critics such as Stuckman or Redlettermedia. They explain why something does or does not work.  You went into detail with Blue is the Warmest colour but you gave no faults with the movie. Now, fair play it's your opinion but you still need too find cracks like the sex scenes being too long, like seriously too long, or the fact that some scenes felt like they were missing - What happened too Adele's parents? It felt like there should have been a scene where the parents walk in on the two doing their thing. You see, two faults. A reviewer needs too find cracks even in a masterpiece. I love amelie - it's my favorite movie, but even i can admit that there are faults with it even if i would give it a 10/10.  I agree with a lot of your reviews, not all of them (Battle Royale and the two for-mentioned), but you need too explain.   It's like convicting a criminal with no evidence or writing an English essay with no evidence and explanation, just points   But good luck too you.

YMS,3d6lv2,londonlock2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:06:04 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of why most of Shyamalan's movies suck is because he had a hit and when people started offering him jobs, the only ones he would accept were local (PA) productions.  People realized real quick that working with him would increase their budgets and cause all kinds of travel issues as most film people work in LA or NYC.  Eventually it seemed like offers for both productions and funding dried up on him to the point that he had to make shitty movies.  It doesn't help that he's not that great of director.  As much as I think his cinematography is always really great, his writing is so uneven."

You don't have to know the main actors in it or it's director, just the title invokes cultural significance. If Shyamalanadingdong made the Citizen Kane of the 21st century, it will be remembered for a long time regardless of how horrible he is. Unless we figure out how to make an A.I. that could figure out how to simulate the neurology of a perfect director, at which point every piece of media from then on might be a masterpiece because an A.I. will program itself to be the perfect director without equal, copy paste itself 10,000 times, and concoct movies that are so astoundingly brilliant that no movie before them will be seen as good at all.

They glorify military to make it seem like Americans are angels and brown people are hitler. The movies are kind of racist too. But I still enjoy watching them if that makes any sense.
YMS,3d5idf,seandan317,7,Mon Jul 13 21:03:11 2015 UTC,"They glorify military to make it seem like Americans are angels and brown people are hitler.    On the last point, sure. But a strong point of them, especially in Hurt Locker was that the tour of duty ruins you as a person and renders you unable to function in every day life. I'd hardly call that dangerous glorification, just because there's a cool, gasoline explosion in the middle of the movie."
YMS,3d5idf,RDandersen,2,Mon Jul 13 23:33:17 2015 UTC,"Totally agree but the people that I know didn't see that, they just thought the military was cool."
YMS,3d5idf,seandan317,2,Mon Jul 13 23:46:51 2015 UTC,If they miss such an obvious point I don't think we can make the argument that the movie promotes dangerous ideals to them. Clearly the movie was just pretty colours and loud noises to them.
YMS,3d5idf,RDandersen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:49:46 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess. Both movies made it pretty obvious to me that war really fucks people up. But the movies promote war and the same time.

YMS,3d5idf,seandan317,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:57:34 2015 UTC,"The real test is how many people changed their minds after seeing a movie like those.

YMS,3d5idf,RDandersen,5,Tue Jul 14 00:56:52 2015 UTC,"I think the Hurt Locker was bad because it was patently unrealistic. I'm not a military guy but I'm pretty sure that 3 soldiers aren't just allowed to roam around in Iraq doing whatever they want. There's no hierarchy whatsoever in the film.   But I totally agree with your sentiment about them glorifying the military. Part of the reason they do this is because in order to get access to American military equipment on the cheap, the military has to approve the script."

YMS,3d5idf,seandan317,4,Mon Jul 13 21:31:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after watching it twice, I think the Hurt Locker is fairly overrated. District 9/Avatar should've won Best Picture. (And you can tell it's overrated when someone wants Avatar to beat it.)"

I certainly agree that the Hurt Locker was pretty overrated, but nothing beats Avatar in that category. The only reason that movie is even worth mentioning is the visual effects, which really weren't all that great anyway.  Just because it's over-hyped doesn't mean it's bad, though. The Hurt Locker had decent writing and pretty good acting. On that basis alone it's better than at least 70% of the shit getting pumped through Hollywood."

YMS,3d5idf,MojaveWalker,2,Mon Jul 13 21:49:15 2015 UTC,"I love Clint Eastwood as a director, I really do, and I feel like he really wanted to do something with that movie, but it had one HUGE problem, the script. The script was absolutely awful, instead of making the movie about the effects of war on a person.

Then sum lil faggot, comes out seeing his mom got fucked and starts whailing on the speaker.  Though it hurts him, Kyle blows the fucker's head off.  But when xXKyle_911Xx gets bored of hardscoping all day, he puts on his game face and decides he's going to YY quickscope for CoD montage he's planning to upload onto youtube.  Getting in front of all the casuals, he runs and guns head first into enemy territory.  Some casuals get killed but who cares, he looks badass.  And when Kyle finally kills the enemy sniper, (from a mile away) there's a goddamn motherfuckin' Max Payne 3 Bullet Time Killcam  Kyle finishes his killstreak and heads back home to be a family man.  Kyle presses X to pay his respects, erase all family problems, and strangely justify his career.  Kyle becomes the manager of an e-sports team and some random guy asks for pointers from Kyle, but he backstabs Kyle instead and screams ""GG NO RE"""

The aimless plot and completely unsolicited mood swings in characters makes this painfully obvious.  As a huge fan of the original,  my main gripe is the style and tone of Jurassic World.  It watches a lot less as a sci-fi thriller and more of an over-the-top monster movie.  The original was about nature - the dinosaurs behaved like predators, not like godzilla.   Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard play characters with little nuance at all,  but their charisma makes up for it.  The kids, however,  are completely unlikable and irritating to watch every moment they're on the screen.  This is especially disappointing considering that Jurassic Park is one of the few movies where the child actors held their own against the adult cast.  It almost seems like the writers were self-aware enough to realize that Grady was the only character that people would care about and made the third act into and escort mission where the kids did nothing but watch him fight dinosaurs.    Of course, I'm biased because in terms of sci-fi, I put Jurassic Park over Star Wars.  It's a good thing that the series now won't end on a completely low point with Jurassic Park 3.  My personal opinions on what a Jurassic Park movie should be shouldn't effect the score.  If taken it for what it is- a summer monster movie with million-dollar effects - it's really not that bad.  I can see how most people enjoy it."

I'm not a comic fan so I have to wonder, Red Skull this stupid in  the comics? His character was just so pathetically presented the scene where he takes off his face is so anti-climatic that it just left me scratching my head thinking. 'Is this supposed to feel important' Speaking of anti-climactic, this has one of the most anti-climactic deaths in movies. Bucky's death was thrown in there in a split second (which there isn't anything particularly wrong with) but was just followed by a kind of sad look my Captain America and then he just went on, I don't even think his character was even mentioned for the rest of the movie. It looked awful, something about the color scheme felt like I was watching a cutscene in a video game. Many of green screen scenes looked so unbelievably fake to, like they weren't even trying to make it look remotely real the car chase scene or the train scene in particular looked laughably bad. The score sounded like it was made for a low budget Nic Cage movie.  The acting was bad, like really bad, particularly from Chris Evans, I'm a big fan of both Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones but even their performances were bad. Don't get me started on the love interest, sassy woman who is in the military! How original. The script was terrible, it didn't even have any of the good qualities that makes many action films good. It took itself way to seriously. The by far worst scene in the movie is the scene I refer as the 'Shit getting done' scene, right after Captain America gets his shield, there is a random montage of very short terribly actions sequences, nothing significant at all comes from this montage, and it is what it is, just a bunch of random shit that basically tells you ""Now he's in the fight! And he cares about the girl!"" And they thrown in a truck getting blown up shot with literally no build up for literally no reason, just randomly........ Is it just me or do they do just the shittiest job at explaining why the Nazis have all this advanced technology? It felt like if they just threw in the Nazis from Wolfenstein the New Order and expected us to believe it for no reason with little backstory.   Now my fingers hurt."
YMS,3cyel6,CallMeMoo,6,Sat Jul 11 23:26:58 2015 UTC,"While the pacing was a bit off, it wasn't awful by any means. What where you expecting regarding a villain named the Red Skull? of course he's going to be a tad silly. He's more or less a parody of Hitler. His death was a setup for the villain the Captain America 2. And on top of that, there was other shit going on. They where being shot at and the train was buzzing along pretty quickly iirc. the movie didn't waste time and slow down to over dramatize his death. The film was going for a 1940's ish look, and I think it succeeds I honestly didn't notice the score when I watched the movie, so I cannot comment on that. The acting was fine, obviously Chris Evans isn't a Daniel Day Lewis or Philip Seymour Hoffman but he did a fine job. While Tacked on, she was more then just another love interest, she was fairly fleshed out and was a baddass through-out most of the film. Again, while not amazing the script accomplished what it needed to. Not sure what scene you're even referring too. They explained it fine, Red Skull had found the tesseract (The blue cube) and was able to manufacture weapons using it's power.   all in all, you're just giving this more way more shit than it deserves. It's a fine popcorn action film that isn't men't to be analyzed or really even taken too seriously."
YMS,3cyel6,Dooperer1,-2,Sun Jul 12 00:26:47 2015 UTC,"I think it was, but respect your opinion. I think it was the way the villain was written that was awful and he really didn't even seem like he was important to anything at all. It wasn't that he was silly. Captain America 2 is actually good. But to the point, I see what you mean by there was other shit going on, but when a character that is important like that dies, I expect it to feel like something important just happened. It didn't feel like it was going for that. Alrighty then I didn't think the acting was good at all. I think the fact that she was a badass more cements my point that she was tacked on. I think it was poopy. Find it somewhere, it's awful Maybe it was because I felt so uninterested in the characters that I really didn't give a shit what was going on at the time. I recall that being at the beginning of the film.   All in all, yes it's a action movie, a bad one imo, but it doesn't matter it wasn't mean to be analyzed, neither was cyberbully...it just shoved it's message into your face."

YMS,3coiws,JASON9818,4,Thu Jul 9 14:41:25 2015 UTC,"I remember hearing about it somewhere on Reddit that you can tell how good acting, directing, etc. is in a movie by comparing it to films known to have good acting. I know to spot bad directing you have to look at how an actor who is primarily really good delivers a poor performance in a badly directed film.  To me acting is good if someone is ""chameleoning"" like completely transforming themselves into the character and switching moods and expressions flawlessly and naturally along with the script (E.g Heath Ledger (The Joker), Johnny Depp(Sweeny Todd), Tom Hardy( Bronson) ). It's hard for me, personally, to identify good acting in a movie about regular people cause at that point it's hard to tell what is convincing me ( the script or the actor ). I am no film expert but hopefully my notions for good acting provides you some insight."
YMS,3coiws,ch00mbazch0clit,3,Fri Jul 10 07:51:01 2015 UTC,"What's so hard about figuring it out? It pretty much just has to be convincing and real. I guess you get to notice it better the more movies you watch, though.   Here's a bunch of scenes with good acting in them that I could think of right now. Some spoilers.  Schindler's List ending, SPOILER, obviously  Julianne Moore's freak out in Magnolia, SPOILER  Probably Tom Cruise's best performance in Magnolia, SPOILER  This scene in Shame, Minor SPOILER  Ending scene in Blue Jasmine, SPOILER  Also Matthew McConaughey's crying is pretty convincing in Dallas Buyers Club  As for bad acting, I'm sure you can find a ton of examples in Adam's YMS videos of Cyberbully, After Earth, Walking Dead, Cool Cat and so on."

YMS,3clepz,TheDerpyDonut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:53:25 2015 UTC,"Adam's interpretation of Sammy as God is really interesting to me. Personally I saw him as Death. He is constantly stalking Caden, knows about things he shouldn't and has a very pale and skull-like face. I never considered the idea that he represents God until now but in the universe of Synedoche, God and Death could be very much the same thing. Y'know the whole ""the end is built into the beginning""."
YMS,3clepz,EpsilonSilver,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:46:01 2015 UTC,"I think Sammy represents the feeling that someone is watching your life and caring about what you do. Caden is so wrapped up in himself and his own life that his world is the only one that matters. Sammy even says that in all his years of following Caden, he only ever focused on himself and never others. One major theme in the movie is that everyone has their own stories and set of problems. In the end, Ellen says, ""as you learn there is no-one watching you, and there never was."" This is perhaps to suggest that Caden has finally realized that the world does not revolve around him and that he wasn't as important as he thought he was. Just some thoughts."

I think it's safe to say that it is the one of the best written movies out there. For me, though, I think the film gives me a cerebral response and lacks a ton of emotion, and I thought that at surface level it was too complicated for its own good. If you need up to two hours of well thought-out discussion to even be able to explain a movie, for me something is lost. Maybe that's just me, though."

YMS,3clepz,BattleChimp,5,Wed Jul 8 21:20:10 2015 UTC,The whole project is well-done and worthwhile. I love the poignancy of how long it's taking and that the whole 'art reflecting reality' is becoming reflexive again. It's all so appropriate and relevant to the movie.
YMS,3clepz,Tommat,11,Thu Jul 9 00:04:09 2015 UTC,"Disagreed with ""too long"". It's one film that most definitely deserves such close examination. And massive respect for Adam, although this type of video may not get as many views as a YMS, it is of huge value in my opinion."
YMS,3cm0ng,MrChessguy2,7,Wed Jul 8 23:20:49 2015 UTC,"First off, I'd like to express how interesting and entertaining a voice you are, and the fact that I felt the review itself was well-written and argued. However, I could choose to be critical with the presentation itself. I feel that it doesn't warrant the video format. Rather, it feels like a written review (albeit a rather excellent written review) read aloud to the film trailer.   Now, although this doesn't stick out to be a defining factor as to why someone might choose not to watch your review, I do feel as though it detracts from the overall immersion. In fact, I found myself drifting off into other tabs as I opted to just listen to your opinion.   You address this format in terms of tone quite well; however, in terms of what appears visually, I feel as though you could use the format better to your advantage. I mean, you're a man of film, and I know you could better utilize this. As an example, the clip of the trailer at the end of the review seemed to fit perfectly, and it drew me in for the few seconds and even got a laugh out of me. As well as this, the beginning of the video with interwoven clips worked decently. Towards the end, however, I felt as though it lost this. Perhaps, therefore, it is the editing which could benefit this. But I'm sure this is something that will be rectified upon further uploads. Looking forward to it, you have yourself a subscriber.   tl;dr i'm a big fan upon first glance, i'll be making sure to tune in on any future posts, you have an interesting and sophisticated perspective, but you need to use the form to your advantage."
YMS,3cm0ng,initfortheread,2,Thu Jul 9 11:59:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for subscribing, and thanks for all of the feedback!  That's a very good point about how this feels like a written review that was read aloud. My past reviewing experience was all written reviewing, and I'm still trying to figure out how to adjust my text to the new medium. I've got a couple reviews I'm sitting on that I think I'm going to play around with to try and find my voice.  I feel like the visual blandness was probably a combination of the limited trailer footage and my rushed editing. In the future, I'm hoping to make the reviews more engaging by adding relevant non-trailer clips and original video.  Thanks again for all of your thoughts, and I'll try to do them justice in future reviews!"
YMS,3cm0ng,SentimentalTommy,2,Thu Jul 9 14:29:03 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a good review, but like initfortheread said, it doesn't take advantage of the video format. Your delivery is a little stilted, with you keeping the same rhythmic tone throughout the whole video.   Since you are using the spoken word, make your tone slightly more conversational; Make use of pauses and inflections to get your point across. Show more emotion. Let me know why your opinion is worth listening to and why I should care.  If you are really struggling with delivery, try going off of a series of bullet points or quick notes rather than an entire transcript.  Overall, the content is good, but you might need to change your style a little for videos."
YMS,3cm0ng,mardfet,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:05:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for watching and thanks for sharing your thoughts!  I completely agree with the whole delivery note.

YMS,3cgtdc,BattleChimp,7,Tue Jul 7 22:22:47 2015 UTC,"Thomas P. Wiseau has said that his allegorical and deeply layered drama film THE ROOM was intended as a satirical look at the melodrama genre, but this isn't the case. This interpretation only plays a small part in the vast universe of layers, symbolism, social commentary, and algorithms that is THE ROOM.  The film has been critically panned throughout the years, but there is a small cult following made up of those who know the truth:   THE ROOM is a look at how gender roles and the patriarchy have destroyed our lives. THE ROOM is intended to be seen through LISA'S PERSPECTIVE! She is a housewife who has been bludgeoned into submission by societies gender roles and gender-based conformity. She stays home and watches soap operas all day to the point where her entire world looks like it's through the lens of a soap opera camera! She lies about being in the ""computer business"" to make herself feel like her life has meaning, she's obviously a lesbian who is the future wife of Johnny, a wealthy man who isn't attractive by anybodies standards (as though ""marriage has nothing to do with love"", as Claudette put it), she feels as though it's her duty to constantly have sex with her husband whenever he's in the mood (all three Abrahamic religions: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, teach that this is necessary), and she hangs decorative pictures of spoons all over her house (decorative commercial art is a symbol of bourgeois culture, and the spoon is a phallic symbol, symbolizing that all of the inadequacies in her life are because of our patriarchal society).  Major tragedies happen because of how she lies about herself in life. She feels as though she NEEDS to fuck Mark in order to be a ""normal woman"", which incites a fight between Mark and Johnny, who feel as though it's their duties as ""normal men"" to fight for sex (which in reality shows a darker subplot: Johnny and Mark are secret lovers expressing their love through fighting. The way their unrequited sexual feelings for each other are never explicitly shown or even implied is a way of symbolizing societies condemnation of homosexuality.)  Which of course leads to the most tragic and devastating scene in contemporary film: Johnny's suicide. He destroys all his material possessions when he realizes that they are worthless and that society has forced them upon him, and he puts a gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger, or in other words: uses ""masculinity"", the dogma he lived his life by, as a means of destroying himself.  This explains other things, too: The scene where they play football in tuxedos is an allegory for forced and unnatural masculine behavior that men show in front of other men. The scene where Denny gets a gun pulled on him by Chris R for not having money shows the flaws of capitalism (a patriarchal concept), the unnecessarily long sex scenes are made to condemn our culture's commodification of sexuality, and the scene where Mark pushes Mike into trashcans on accident because he wanted to know his ""underwear"" story is to show how Mark's closet homosexuality manifests in his actions daily.  So you see, THE ROOM is the 2000's answer to classics like JEANNE DIELMAN, A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE, and EYES WIDE SHUT. If you don't agree, then I will tear you apart."

YMS,3ce1vb,SentimentalTommy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:09:03 2015 UTC,"This might be part of some weird viral marketing Netflix is doing, similar to how Daniel Handler denies being Lemony Snicket and the mystery behind him.  The channel that uploaded this video is called Eleanora Poe. A person by this same name also recently started a twitter account. The phone number on the twitter takes you to the answering machine for the Daily Punctillo.  In case you are not catching on, in the books Eleanora Poe is a writer for the newspaper, The Daily Punctillo.  This is either a very, very dedicated fan, or more likely a marketing stunt by Netflix.  Edit: Take a look at who Eleanora Poe is following. Most of them have some connection to the book series, Netflix, or the trailer. (Neil Gaiman is married to Amanda Palmer, who performs the song in the trailer. I admit that is a bit of a stretch)   A couple accounts may give hints as to who is connected to the Netflix series right now. One is cinematographer, Jonathan Bruno. It is possible that he just did the trailer though and will have no work on the actual series. The other is eighteen year old actor, Jack Griffo. Could he be playing Klaus?  The one account remaining is Anwhistle Aquatics This is the name of the marine research center in the Grim Grotto. The description for the account says Volunteers Fervently Desired. V.F.D. I recommend checking out that account since they have some images and tweets that give more of a look into the Bauldelaire case."

I just also want to thank you for talking so openly about furry and having discussions about furry as a sexuality on your streams.  In one recent stream you were a bit sour on being furry (the one where you talked about learning you were furry before you figured out you were gay, I experienced the exact same thing), but despite that, it gave me a sort of revelation that furry IS my sexuality.  So it's really helped me to be more comfortable and open with being furry, at least with those closest to me.  Now I'm getting a fursuit and planning on going to MFF with my boyfriend next year.  You've had a pretty big positive impact on my life because of that, and I suppose this as good a way to thank you as any other."

I think it was because I was just getting into online film reviews at the time and so it kept coming up whenever I watched another one, which I was frankly horrified by every time because of the thumbnail (Megan's face in one of the 'disturbing photos'). I kept avoiding it because of the thumbnail, but was curious at the same time because I'd heard about 'Megan Is Missing' before while researching found footage films. Eventually that curiosity got the better of me and I decided to click on that dreaded thumbnail to see what it was like.  I think that review is probably my favourite of all of his; not only because it was my first but because on my first watch I thought it was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen on YT, which was a really awesome surprise.

YMS,3cc36c,wow_pow34,3,Tue Jul 7 05:21:32 2015 UTC,"His Walking Dead review was at the top of /r/television or /r/videos one day and I watched it and really enjoyed it. I subscribed on Youtube straight away eagerly awaiting the next part to the Walking Dead series of reviews(?) he was doing and I of course watched the other content and became instantly hooked.  I think I binge watched everything on his channel and a few weeks later I came across /r/YMS and subbed here.  I don't watch adams reviews like I watch other reviews or read other reviews. I watch Adams stuff because his videos themselves are entertainment. They are enjoyable to watch regardless of what the review is about. I watch other reviews or read reviews for the facts about the movie to decide if I want to go see it.  That may seem weird because lots of Adams ""thoughts on"" and mini-reviews of what he has just seen are basically reviews but I watch them no matter what the movie is about even things I know I have zero interest in I still watch just because I enjoy Adam as an entertainer and content creator.  It's hard to explain but ... imagine reviewers are painters, most reviewers will simply read the list of ingredients in the paints, describe the canvas and paint brushes. But adam uses the paints and the brushes and the canvas to actually make art and not just explain the good and bad points of the tools one uses to make art.  He cuts up the movie, he talks at length about different parts of it, he isn't afraid to go off track about one part of a movie to explore its subtext or what the director was trying to do and he often looks at a directors past works to find meaning in their current way of shooting a scene or whatever it may be he's talking about. That's real insight that is often rare in reviews where I think many reviewers are afraid to delve deeper because they don't want to get it wrong or they don't feel it's relevant to the film they are reviewing at that very moment.  Film is art, and just like you can spend hours and hours discussing a beautiful painting and the artists other established works and their influences I feel you can do that with movies and Adam is one of the greats in that regard and I feel very fortunate to have found his channel and get such great content for free."

So I thought hey I just watched that, wonder what this guy has to say about it. After that I watched all of his videos and haven't missed one yet."

A bitter man. My favorite superhero was in the worst movie I've ever seen with a budget as high as it was. It was actually baffling how horrible it was. The movie was there, but if you cut out some stuff and explain a little bit, it could have been salvaged. It was just so clumsy and it seemed like no one cared making it. It was so disheartening.   I needed to know I wasn't wrong, that I thought that might have been the worst movie I've seen and will see that year.   I looked up a review and Adam was the first to show me the light. Thank you."

YMS,3cdt3j,_deathproof_,6,Tue Jul 7 03:17:56 2015 UTC,"Just watched it for the nth time recently. This time I was really trying to get a sense of what the larger world is like.   I maintain that it's good, moderately utopian sci-fi. Which is far too rare, especially in contemporary media where virtually all depictions of the future are dystopian.   Utopia - It may seem like a world where any knock on the door could be some future-drug tweaker with a twitchy finger on a very powerful trigger. A world where at any time you have to put your hands on the wall and freeze for a lockdown inspection - but that's just where Korben lives, and a character like that clearly has little money,  and doesn't care about a rough neighborhood. I think it's quite clear that the world as a whole is a pretty awesome place.   Black president showing democracy and racial equality, they have something that's almost a food replicator, flying cars, high art and culture. A vacation in a spaceship to a distant tropical planet must be fairly common, since the film presents that prize as analogous to winning a similar trip on a game/radio show in the real world. Korben's mom is clearly enjoying her retirement, the govt has their shit so together that the specific little religious sect actually gets looped in on this event that they have special knowledge about. Mcd's is still around, the president, much like Ruby Rhod is always a breath away from broadcasting to the public, therefore private business/free market is still intact, and public support seems to matter more to this fictional president then it does to our current legislators. Unless Mcd’s won a Demolition Man style ‘franchise war’ and the President is just broadcasting to a tiny group of oligarchs….  Cigarettes appear to be more legal than in reality. If anything dystopia would be Korben unable to light up in his low-income dwelling unit, which is compact, but fairly nice. He even eats a freshly prepared authentic Chinese meal out of his window, from a flying foodcart. While it's not mundane sci fi, it's grounded, and utopian in a reasonable way.   Good Sci fi: It's not about the prophesied return of a magical evil force that's thwarted through the power of love - it's about a sentient celestial entity adhering to its orbital pattern. It's about a very old and advanced alien society being aware of this destructive entity, and helping a younger planet avoid destruction through technology so advanced that it resembles magic. It's about those aliens helping the less developed lifeforms understand this technological process by framing it as a religious ritual.   Further adding to this film's sci fi cred - that religion's purpose is to preserve and pass on specific knowledge. That's the most basic aspect of science. One borne out of religion at a time when (at least in the west) the church was doing what would eventually become the basic purpose of scientific institutions.  Gary Oldman: he good"
YMS,3cdt3j,jshorton,5,Tue Jul 7 05:54:40 2015 UTC,"Drinking game for this movie is absolutely the best movie drinking game there is:  1) Drink anytime someone is startled or generally confused.  2) Drink anytime anyone says ""perfect"".  3) Finish your drink when Gary Oldman opens an empty case."

The soundtrack is weird and awesome, the costumes and sets are awesome, the opera scene is awesome, solid comic relief and good action. It's just a good movie, man."
YMS,3cdt3j,Hippeus,9,Tue Jul 7 06:58:28 2015 UTC,I thought it was kinda dumb. There was nothing particularly remarkable about it and the characters were all sort of irritating to me. I just didn't think it was great and was kinda surprised to hear that people liked it so much. Just my thoughts.

They commented on things ranging from drone strikes to standardized testing, or from college admissions process to the what's good hip-hop. But maybe I wouldn't necessarily hold it against it.   It really made me miss how indie/festival films used to be: eccentric, risky, and messy. Indie films shouldn't be about trying to be mainstream, and I think Dope really brought back what made film festivals and art houses so interesting because it's about finding films that wouldn't normally be a financial success."

YMS,3c57mm,MojaveWalker,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:18:25 2015 UTC,I'd say season 4 is. The whole virus thing from the first half was stupid and the governor's invasion was very anti-climatic.    The second half just dragged on. 8 episodes of people lost in the woods.

YMS,3c3txq,mardfet,4,Mon Jul 6 20:38:53 2015 UTC,"I actually really liked the movie despite the time travel questions and also all the other stuff that never got explained like who sent the terminator back in time in the first place?  Here are the things I really liked:  In particular the lengths they went to to recreate the beginning of the original Terminator shot for shot. I liked that they got an actress that looked quite similar to a young Linda Hamilton, and I don't think she was bad either.  The whole first act in 1984 was fantastic, it was nothing but shameless fanservice and I loved it. The films biggest undoing is probably that they didn't keep the whole rest of the movie in that time period though, they could've avoided pretty much all the issues that littered the rest of the film, but ehh I guess they needed an excuse for the terminator to be old. Which by the way, I thought the explanation was fine, up until they pointed out that he could regrow the skin on his arm but not regenerate his youthful appearance.  Apart from all the horrible time travel questions that were raised and un-answered questions of which there are far too many, my other big problem with the movie was that they ditched the continuity of how and when Kyle Reece met John Connor that was established in Salvation. Oh also Matt Smith's character... why even bother with it.  I do agree though there was far too many CGI stunts that could've been done with practical effects, or were just overdone."
YMS,3c3txq,thefrontpageofreddit,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:01:18 2015 UTC,I'll give you the 1984 stuff that was pretty cool.  I really wish Matt Smith's character was in it more because he can seriously ham shit up in a fun way.  Also it's obvious he's set up for the sequel that's already confirmed.

YMS,3bz3sr,JASON9818,9,Fri Jul 3 09:10:01 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to say ""This is not good"". It took me years to learn that a movie could be bad. Developing a critical sense is not an easy thing to do, and being able to differentiate your own sense of appreciation from the actual quality of that thing is even more difficult. So, in general, most people can't. They'll see big explosions and say ""Oh, I like explosions, therefore this movie is good!""  Receiving backlash for having a more developed critical sense is completely absurd, and even more so if we're talking about a critic. That's what he's supposed to do. He's supposed to guide me towards what's interesting, analyze a piece, tell me what works and what doesn't, and more importantly (imho), make me discover new things. All things Adam does amazingly in his top 10s and in a lot of his reviews.  So fuck those people, they have no idea what they're talking about and are responsible for the downfall of cinema (and giving Michael Bay the power to re-make The Birds)."

YMS,3bwm51,mardfet,8,Thu Jul 2 19:23:33 2015 UTC,"I just try to judge a movie on its own terms. If it succeeds at doing what it wants to do, I'll give it a positive rating (6-10). That doesn't mean that every single movie with no flaws demands a 10/10 from me, though. There are a lot of movies with no mistakes that only warrant a 6-7/10 or so from me. If something truly amazes me or even makes me jealous of how good it is, I'll give it somewhere between a 8-10/10. I don't take every rating I make on IMDb too seriously because I just use it to show what I have and haven't seen."
YMS,3bwm51,AKrocker907,3,Thu Jul 2 19:36:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with the 10/10 thing. If a movie aims to just be pretty decent and hits the nail right on the head does not warrant a 10/10. That requires a movie to REALLY go above and beyond, with fantastic filmmaking and minimal if no flaws, aka The Social Network or Birdman."
YMS,3bwm51,chevybow,4,Thu Jul 2 19:46:26 2015 UTC,I rate movies subjectively. So 10/10 means its a favorite. 9/10 means its really really good. 8/10 means its solid. 7/10 means it has issues but still enjoyable. 6/10 has too many issues or its not as enjoyable. If i give something a 5 or below it means its not enjoyable at all. The lower the number the lower I think the quality is.
YMS,3bwm51,trained_badass,2,Fri Jul 3 01:05:44 2015 UTC,"Anything below a 5 really depends on the quality of the movie, self awareness of the quality of the movie, an objective view of the film, and my personal enjoyment. I rarely think that I see something that's truly a 1. I almost always just steer clear of those films. But every once in a while there's a 2, or 3, and so on.  A 6/10 is a film that does have a lot of good things going for it, but there's too much that gets in the way of my enjoyment of the movie. A film that is just decent. One that might excel in some categories and fail in others (Interstellar), or is just meh all around (Frozen).  A 7/10 is just a good movie for me. Very solid and enjoyable through its flaws. It does what it sets out to do and does it fairly well. Something that I wouldn't need to see again, but I might (Spy).  An 8/10 is a great movie. One that has a lot of good things going for it without anything to really weigh it down. A movie that I would see again if I had the opportunity, but not something I would go way out of my way to see (Dope).  A 9/10 is a fantastic film. It's a film that I want to go see again, a film that has almost or just as much magic as the first time. There may be a few things that I might find irritating, but they're very insignificant and they're very much subjective annoyances rather than objective ones (12 Years a Slave).  A 10/10 is amazing. It may not be flawless, but it has seemingly everything else going for it that I don't even notice the bad things. It's one I want to support at the box office and one that I want to buy day one on Blu Ray (Whiplash)."

If two different films are trying to do two different things that I enjoy in two different ways and they are doing them equally well, I will rate them equally.

Battleship and Monopoly are board games based on the kinds of things a movie might actually be about with the story removed.  I dunno if I'm making sense.

YMS,3bt5fx,DodoL64,3,Wed Jul 1 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"Personally I found The Wind Rises to be tedious, cliché, and stale.   hmmm... I actually don't really understand what you mean by any of those. I do understand some criticisms of the film, like a lot of people found the main character boring, or the biggest conflicts like the earthquake merely glanced upon, despite not bothering me, but I definitely don't see how it could be tedious, cliche, or stale. You might have to elaborate on those for me. :/   I also thought Under the Skin was a 2014 film?   meh, it just depends on what system your looking at, whether it's first release to any group of people, first release to a major theater, first release in your country, etc. I go by IMDb for years, but I'm not going to argue what year a movie came out, if you consider it 2014, go right ahead and say it is.    If it is then my favorite movie that year would be either that, Her, or 12 Years a Slave.   Good choices. I haven't ventured into Spike Jonze's other projects, but I feel like I need too after Her. The overhype kind of annoyed me, but that doesn't change how great I found the film. 12 Years a Slave had a small backlash for being an Oscar winner and being labelled as Oscar-bait, but just because it's Steve McQueen's least brutal film, doesn't make it not fucked up.   And what the fuck happened to Under the Skin? It went from this underground hit with everyone raving over it, to having a 6.3 on IMDb. I guess a lot of the IMDb and /r/movies crowd don't really enjoy that type of filmmaking, which is a shame. I know some disliked it for legitimate reasons, but a lot of people just seem to hate slow, experimental type stuff. (Which I imagine is why a film like The Hunt got praised on /r/movies, but The Great Beauty is more lukewarm, and Norte: The End of History is only mentioned by a few dozen superfans. Not saying The Hunt is bad, or worse than those other films, but it's an easier watch. It's kind of like Hoop Dreams and Shoah. Both are some of the best documentaries ever, but Hoop Dreams gets more attention, because it's easier to appreciate)   Good list mate, impressed with how much ya watched.   Thank you so much, but I still have a lot to get. I made this list just to show how good year-end lists can be if you didn't rush them. And keep in mind, I saw only one of those films in theaters, and I didn't go to any film festivals. (Don't live near one)"

YMS,3bt5fx,mardfet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:34:26 2015 UTC,"I really liked it, but you're right it is 100% predictable. The story has been done many times, however I think short term 12 should be given credit for doing such a fucking amazing job at it. Every single actor in short term 12 killed it, every scene had this conciseness to it, lasted as long as it needed to and dealt a big punch in that time.   Doesn't deserve number 1 on any list for 2013, but if Like someone in Love makes Adam's list, where he seems to admit that the movie is boring, but is done so fucking well that it deserves recognition.

He used the exact link, but his username was impostering YMS and he got banned. TBH I hate imposters but you never know if he would of started annoying people or do something else."
YMS,3bt9ua,anUnkindness,2,Thu Jul 2 06:53:01 2015 UTC,"I authorized this and this is exactly why I didn't want to start banning people in the first place. Too much is left up to interpretation. Is this user someone that had existed before the imposter accounts became so prevalent? I asked for them to be banned because the link was posted literally less than 24 hours after that huge post about the imposter accounts, and also because the comment in the thread implied that someone had already mistaken it as myself. I found the post by going on my subreddit like normal and then thinking: ""I don't remember posting this here yet."" so it even wound up fooling myself. Honestly, even if a good case were made for this user not being a part of that 'group', I'm not sure I want any accounts on this subreddit to have intentionally similar or misleading names at this point. This has all made me realize how easy it is for someone else to be mistaken as myself, and also how apparently easy it is for people to judge me for things being said or posted from these other accounts. I'm willing to have a conversation about it if someone wants to change my mind, but I don't think I'm being unreasonable here. Feel free to make however many imposter accounts you want in other subreddits, but this is where I understand many of you are actively searching for my input. I already get misinterpreted enough for the things I say. I don't feel like getting misinterpreted for the things I don't say."

YMS,3bl2bk,MojaveWalker,2,Tue Jun 30 02:24:26 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the original Joe Dirt, so take this with a grain of salt. I think this could be one of the best things Happy Madison does. Not because of the actors in it or because of the IP (Joe Dirt) in any way, but just because it doesn't have Sandler in it and it isn't getting a full release.   The fact that it isn't getting a full release makes it seem like less of a cash grab imo. :/  TL;DR it'll probably be shit."

YMS,3bl2bk,iNvalidRequiem,3,Tue Jun 30 03:35:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean that Sandler is a bad actor. I just meant that if it's being produced by his company (he does own Happy Madison, right?), but he's not starring in it, then it might just be a side project that he didn't touch. I feel like all of his recent Happy Madison features have been absolutely terrible.   All that said, if the original Joe Dirt is awful, this one probably will be too."

YMS,3bj3n2,ataturkman,2,Mon Jun 29 17:19:28 2015 UTC,"The film itself is more about contrasts and comparisons rather than a straight up interpretation of the story. Bergman was pretty subversive with this one. I think your understanding of the film is pretty solid, and likely the interpretation that Bergman intended, based on interviews and reading his notes from pre-production. The idea is that the women are truly one and the same, similar in concept to his later films like The Silence and Cries and Whispers. The main interpretation is that Elizabeth's condition is the shared condition of both life and art, in a modernist horror sense. Persona is seriously one of my favorite movies ever. Glad to see it get some love."
YMS,3bj3n2,TheBosma,2,Tue Jun 30 02:10:18 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the insight. I rreally loved it. After a 2nd watch i am sure i will even love it more. Probably will be one of my favourites as well.
YMS,3bj3n2,TheBosma,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:15:16 2015 UTC,"What I've found helpful with Bergman is watching more of his movies. He used a lot of connected and similar themes. I have this order I recommend to my friends. First, the faith trilogy in any order is necessary viewing. Cries and Whispers and Autumn Sonata should be watched somewhere in there too. But the real tricky part comes here. Scenes from a Marriage, Liv and Ingmar (documentary about their relationship), Shame, The Passion of Anna, Hour of the Wolf.   It really helps because each one of those provides serious insight into the following film. Makes it really enjoyable. The faith trilogy, Cries and Whispers, and Autumn Sonata can be viewed whenever in there or after there or during there."

Adam's ability to reincorporate themes and jokes through reviews makes all the YMS reviews have their own forms of humor.   Personally, the reviews I've rewatched the most have been The Walking Dead (hyped for his season 3/4 breakdown that'll probably be released 2025) and The Host. When I want to be angry at the evil nature of business and greed, TWD fills my craving, while The Host lets me circlejerk over my hatred of teeny shit movies"

YMS,3bcbud,rabidmonkey1,28,Sat Jun 27 21:34:53 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting topic and this video has some nice points to make on suspension of disbelief and the fact that CGI was used to add things to scenes instead of fully create them, but unfortunately it didn't go fully in-depth. And the Hulk comparison wasn't really fair, since the 2003 Hulk was a stationary shot and the 2008 Hulk had movement and motion blur. Plus he cuts off the 2003 Hulk shot at the bottom, where the horrible CGI pants are visible.   The Yoda comparison is more fair, since it shows that for some reason a pretty obvious and crude puppet is far better than a computer model with much higher detail. For some reason our brains can easily something that is real, even when it's captured by film. And a side-note, the Yoda comparison made me think of the Orang Utan from Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, which looked so realistic it shows that it's definitely possible to use CGI realistically for highly detailed living creatures."
YMS,3bcbud,WhyAmIMrPink-,10,Sat Jun 27 21:59:09 2015 UTC,"I think part of the issue too, which you alluded to with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, is using different techniques, such as advanced mo-cap, to make the illusion more believable.   I wouldn't quite say that the movie was completely believable. Something still felt a little uncanny to me, but it was still awesome to watch for the most part."
YMS,3bcbud,WhyAmIMrPink-,5,Sat Jun 27 22:20:39 2015 UTC,"You're right that the movie wasn't completely believable, not all CGI was as good as the Orang Utan. And I think the Orang Utan worked so well because it looked so real because there was a contrast with all those other apes which were more clearly CGI. And it helps of course that the Orang Utan was used in a more naturalistic environment, compared to let's say a monkey dual-wielding machine guns on a horse."
YMS,3bcbud,FardoBaggins,2,Sat Jun 27 22:33:17 2015 UTC,"The believable argument was on point, the examples weren't so much. I agree the yoda comparison better illustrates this. Personally, real suspension of belief is a little hard to achieve without having to force it. The orangutan was actually pretty good if i recall.  For me, I have a two scenes that made me think it was live action. these scenes were from over ten years ago.   Spiderman 1 and LotR FotR.  At first I thought it was a stunt man in spiderman shot in slo mo, and in LotR I thought they filmed the actors over blue screen floor or something. all were CG and it still blows me away. It goes to show, if used cleverly enough, you wouldn't be able to tell an intense scene was CG. not only can CG enhance the environment or clean up wires and other good things, but be the focal point and no one is the wiser."

YMS,3bcbud,Captain_Stairs,7,Sun Jun 28 01:04:45 2015 UTC,"It's impossible to say what the force awakens is, until we can see it.  One of the hardest aspects to capture with CGI is light. Specifically how it casts onto CGI images. Our eyes still have a larger resolution than the best cameras."
YMS,3bcbud,InfiniteBacon,2,Sun Jun 28 04:05:17 2015 UTC,".Our eyes still have a larger resolution than the best cameras.   .. Not really.   Still images are poor comparison to moving images to determine how realistic a movie is, as your highest eye resolution is in a tiny central region of your eye. It can only focus on one point at a time,  so moving images crafted cleverly can deceive the eye much easier.   With a still image, that resolution can be swept across the image to find all the little give-aways and flaws.  Standing at the correct viewing distance from a 4k TV, most viewers would have a difficult time perceiving individual pixel elements or spotting jagged lines."

The picture they use of Hulk for example- the one on the left is more appealing because it's brighter and there's no motion blur. The one on the right has motion blur and is visually less appealing because it's darker/gloomier. They also cut out the awful CGI pants on the left picture.  You don't have to defend the video just because you posted it here you know. You can just admit that you didn't realise it was shit when you posted it."
YMS,3bcbud,TheSuperWig,0,Sun Jun 28 17:52:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending it. I'm asking you to back up your assertions with some evidence (beyond repeating what another redditor already said in this thread).  If you can't do that, then perhaps your comments are on the exact same level that you put this video on."
YMS,3bcbud,thedude1477,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:57:06 2015 UTC,"The entire video is based on his personal reactions to what he finds ""good""  He says in 2004, we could render cgi environments and objects.  Well we could do that in Toy Story, but if you want a realistic movie, that was present in stuff like The Perfect Storm, Pearl Harbor, Star Wars Episode 1, and many more.  Second he uses IMDB scores as a metric for studying film. Now the problem with that is a metric only measures what people would rate the film out of ten without actually standardizing the results. A seven for one person could be a five for another. Finding multiple films with similar scores means nothing as a scientific metric.  The use of a still image does not convey whether or not something is a good use of cgi because he is cherrypicking an image in the midst of motion vs a still body. Thus the actual cgi renderings are of fundamentally different things.   He criticizes a film for having a smoky disaster area because he has yet to experience one. That's a bias based on one viewer.  I do have experience with smoky wrecked areas, but I have no experience with green giants so therefore both scenes break my suspension of disbelief.  The comparison of Yoda vs the puppet is also based on personal experience. The puppet yoda lacks the capability for showing emotion in his face beyond eye movement, jaw movement, and ears. He lacks the capability to have a facial expression and lacks the ability to focus his eyes on things in the scene. His claim as to whether or not a rubber muppet is ""more real"" than a cgi character that can emote is again subjective.  He also assumes making a movie ""pretty"" using effects is inherent to vfx work rather than a general movie problem. Batman Returns, Cutthroat Island, The Truman show, The 13th Warrior and dozens more did the same thing with practical effects"
YMS,3bcbud,Brillegeit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:24:40 2015 UTC,This guy (in the video) didn't put it right. What he means is that back in the 90s CGI was used sparsely and too enhance images. (Jurassic Park) rather than create an entire film with them (Jurassic World). It wouldn't clock in at more than 10 minuets of GGI rather than having a fake 40 minute fight scene (any fucking Marval movie)

I don't get what the film wanted to say, especially when it had such undeveloped, unlikable characters and boring dialogue. There was a moment near the film's climax where a man appears to be following the main character, then they just end the tension by revealing that oh he's just some randy. Then we follow her bumbling around with shaky cam.   Maybe the point is to be ambiguous, but it didn't feel intelligent, just plain pretentious. The end didn't add anything but more questions. Why didn't she just give birth and let other parents adopt? Why didn't she tell her friend the whole truth? Why are they even friends? There's a difference between subtlety and a vacant script."
YMS,3b9rh2,xXRomanXx,2,Sat Jun 27 03:38:50 2015 UTC,YMS gave it a 7/10
YMS,3b9rh2,_deathproof_,2,Sat Jun 27 04:49:03 2015 UTC,"This movie was really interesting, and while I was watching it I couldn't tell if I loved it or if I hated it. There were some things that seemed odd and out place, and there were some things I really liked.   All in all I'd probably agree with a 7/10, maybe even a 6.5/10 if I'm going to be harsh. My biggest complaint about the film was it's ending. SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T WATCHED MR. NOBODY I thought that literally showing time flowing backwards was just stupid. Even if, for whatever reason on the director's part, that a literal representation of what he wanted to convey, it seemed ridiculous and out of place with the rest of the movie.   That said, I really liked how the movie represented the impact that our choices make upon our lives. It was genuinely interesting to watch how Nemo's decisions impacted his life, even if some of the storyline dragged a little bit.  I only watched this movie once, just under a year ago, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt; however, all in all, I thought that Mr. Nobody was an ambitious and interesting film that was also longer than it had any business being and suffered the occasional boring rut. I'm probably going to settle on 6.5/10"

However, something to keep in mind is that the Bionicle films have no sentimental value to Adam, and there's a lot of really shitty films out there. Requesting Adam reviews the shitty film that you remember watching as a kid is projecting your own personal childhood onto Adam's priorities, and let's face it -- that doesn't really make sense (plus the chances of Adam having seen something rather specific that you remember as a kid are generally slim-to-none). Adam is either going to take the time to review something that everyone in this generation seems to have a connection to (ie. Inside Out or Toy Story 3) or something that he in particular feels some connection to (Synecdoche or Nanalan)."

YMS,3av3wz,DrOrion,11,Tue Jun 23 19:17:43 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think that that the movie is just meh. I know there is the standard ""this movie doesn't do the original book justice"" argument that every fan boy and his mother uses, but this is considered one of the greatest graphic novels by one of the greatest authors of graphic novels, Alan Moore, so I really think this applies here. There is a lot of character development they missed out on with Evey by making her too independent to begin with as opposed to here shy nature in the book. If it were to ever be redone, I would like to see it as an HBO mini series starring David Tennant as V because he is a crazy enough actor to yell at a statue of lady justice."
YMS,3av3wz,why_Firefly_ended,3,Tue Jun 23 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"It's one of this movies that feels like just a collection of scenes. There are a few iconic ones that have interesting visuals or dialogue but you forget everything else 30 minutes after walking out of the cinema. Not good, not bad. Easy to watch if you have a weekend afternoon to waste."
YMS,3av3wz,Infintie_3ntropy,3,Tue Jun 23 21:22:00 2015 UTC,"Having only seen the movie and not having read the comic, I personally enjoyed it immensely. The setting was very ""1984-esque"" (I say that only having read the book). I don't think I would be wrong in saying that it seems to be very inspired by George Orwell's 1984.   Taking a page out of CinemaSin's book, when you're reviewing a movie - and ONLY that - the books do not matter. Regardless if it was a great comic written by a great author, it is a FILM review, not a book to screen adaption review. I believe when you're judging an adapted film you do it just the same as you would with an original film. Movies shouldn't be held to different standards because their content is based off of a book.  With that in mind, I saw V for Vendetta once about 8 months ago, and I was very satisfied. I felt a satisfying connection to the characters, thought there was a suitable motive and a good development of the plot. The end was very satisfying and was left wanting more. I can honestly say that there have been few films that have made me that satisfied at the end.  Of course I cannot give you my full and proper opinion because my memory of the film is a little fuzzy, but overall a fantastic watch. I highly suggest watching it."
YMS,3av3wz,kabbalahmonster,3,Wed Jun 24 03:12:26 2015 UTC,"I think it's just bad. Didn't find it entertaining, or thought provoking (it is literally the least subtle thing ever produced), and I found some of the ""iconic lines"" to be painfully bad. It seemed to pretend to be profound, but I found it shallow. It was like a Dark Knight that I didn't find enjoyable.  I think the real reason I hate it so much is my friend won't shut up about how accurate and deep it is so my hate is accentuated. It's probably not as bad as it seems to me (objectively) but being around people who think it's deeper than the Marianas Trench and who won't shut the fuck up about it I can't enjoy it at all.  As a standalone work, viewed objectively as a depiction of a dystopian society it is alright, I suppose."

V's motivations, character, goals, and backstory were so much more engaging than some filler romance subplot.  And another thing I want to bring up is the action. This is one of the very few times where a film would have benefitted from more action scenes. The action and knife-throwing was pretty well done(at least in my opinion) and if they had experimented with it and made more use out of the slow-motion stunts I would have had more to look forward to.

But once I got used to it, I found it quite interesting.   Also, the ending is absolutely amazing. The kind that could be their own short film and still work wonderfully.  The kind that makes people scream in horror. The kind that leaves you breathless when you get out of the theater. That kind of ending.  It's a very interesting experiment, but it's not for everyone.

Some directors could get part of what made Kubrick's style, Resnais could get the coldness and despair of an image, Bergman would have the atmosphere and editing, if you're going for a Barry Lyndon visual style, David Lean can accomplish that, Carl Theodor Dreyer can bring out the best of an actor and low-key scenes, but sadly, all these men are dead.  Even as someone who dislikes quite a few Kubrick films, he was certainly distinct. That's not necessarily a good thing for every director, but in his case, I at least respect it. Respect and like are two different things though."

He's on the right track that art today is sometimes going for shock value more than championing an aesthetic, but that's also where the difference lies.  It really boils down to what is the artist trying to get across and how is it received? This is the problem with art. It's not one-sided. It has to also be interpreted by those it is displayed for. If your shitty apron is meant to mean something (you know, like how art today is shit in your opinion), then congratulations, you've made art and it got your point across. Understand? That itself is art.  That's what it's about. What does it mean to both people and can you convey an abstract thought to an audience in physical form? The fact that it takes on many forms is good. Simply because today we take less of a painstaking measure doesn't mean anything other than people don't care for that kind of aesthetic anymore.  Ironically enough, that's how you interpret good art. That it has to be on some oil canvas by an artist in a beret on a mountaintop kind of shit. Sometimes it's not about making it look pretty. Art takes many forms. Platforming on one kind does not make you any better than those who enjoy other arts. Just distinguishable. Not to say all art is equal, just that they can be art...  TL;DR - Art is like a system of branches for various talents, not a hierarchy of quality for one specific branch"

YMS,3art6k,slyf,4,Tue Jun 23 22:13:39 2015 UTC,"Is this video a joke? This guy is a complete tart that's picking more cherries than Pacman. I'd be kind of disgusted if this guy is actually a professor.  There's a whole other narrative to the development of modernism that this man isn't discussing. Before the 19th century, the number of colors artists could access were limited. They saw color more of as a way of rendering the content of their painting in 3D via chiaroscuro than as a method of expression within their art. Similarly, many of the rules at how to make a successful piece of art was limited. Portraits weren't even considered art because portraitists were likely to make their subjects appear more attractive.   In the 19th century, Japan opened their trading borders to the West, and Europeans had easy access Japanese prints, which had a wildly different approach to color than older, European works of art. There was also incredible innovations in synthesized pigments, meaning that artists had an unbelievably enormous palettes, even colors that they would never naturally see in their lifetimes.   These two developments helped impressionists realize that color is not simply a tool for chiaroscuro, but rather something that can be manipulated independently to create unique emotional responses in the viewer.  The rest of the modernist movement in art is partly the realization that not only is color an independent force, but EVERY component of a good piece of art is. Cézanne (an impressionist) and Picasso start to deconstruct shape and perspective, kicking off cubism. People like Duchamp experiment with the fact that art has always tried to experiment with time in art by trying to compress continuous movement into a single image (like ""Nude Descending a Staircase"" here). Rothko completely abandons trying to create representational imagery and instead tries to discover if it's possible to use the relationships between colors to simulate deep, internal emotions. People like those at the Bauhaus start experimenting with the relationships between textures, forms, spacial relationships, overlapping, and the way these different aspects converge and contrast when juxtaposed in a single compositional structure.   Basically, EVERY individual puzzle piece to the mystery known as ""art"" gets broken down, analyzed, and reconstructed in new forms to create new methods of communication within art. Without this context of art as a grand experiment, it's really tough to appreciate these things.   They may not all be ""good"", but there has never been any era of art that was comprised of universally good art. We just happen to maintain many of the masterpieces of past eras in good condition.   Modernist art is also the source of incredibly valuable experiments and discoveries that have influenced literally every man-made object, space, and piece of media in your current life made since the movement. Web-design often is indirectly inspired by Mondrian's work with rectangular shapes.    Vehicle design had a lot to learn from Umberto's streamlinization of form based on movement. And many of the most cherished pieces of furniture in the 20th century were created by modernist artists, like Ray and Charles Eames, that tried to bring these experiments in shape into your living room.   To answer whether art can be objectively measured in quality, I think the answer is no. Saying that art is in the eye of the beholder doesn't invalidate your opinion, but rather it acknowledges that there are many different positions and angles to critique art from. For every quality you consider to be a universal factor in good art, I can easily find (or make!) a stellar piece of art that completely ignores or mocks that standard.   What we do instead is to consider the components to art like color, composition, shape, form, texture, material, subject, draftsmanship, etc. and analyze how the artist takes advantage of these puzzle-pieces to create art worth appreciating.  (If you know about this kind of stuff and I'm getting something wrong, please tell me)"

Toy Story 1 okay, it was a cultural phenomenon at the time and then between 2003-2008 you had a string of decent movies, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille and WALL-E.   Now these movies aren't the best thing ever (and arguably not even by far the best animated films of their respected years), but they are decent films.   The thing is, there is some bizarre massive circlejerk over Pixar (and Disney) on the internet and real life, people seem to think that Pixar is the be all and end all of animation, why? The movies are formulaic as fuck, the movies are just childish in boring, predictable ways, the character designs are uninteresting, the writing is predictable and lazy and you can go on and on.   ""But Kropotki, they are KIIIIDDDDS films!"" NO THEY ARE FUCKING NOT, that's the thing, Pixar films look like kids films, but they are always cynically marketed and hyped at Gen Y and their films always feature some ultra-hamfisted ""tear jerker"" overarching story about ""Growing up"" and leaving your child hood behind, that isn't aimed at 7 year olds, that's aimed at 20+ year olds, not to mention these films are get 5 out of 5 stars from adult movie reviewers who were ""moved to tears"" from these shitty, lazy films.   You know animated film moved me this year? When Marnie Was There, it will lose every award to Inside Out because ""OMG PIXAR NO CONTEST, WHO WATCHES WEIRD CHINESE SHIT?"" (Yes this is the type of shit that Academy Voters actually say every fucking year)  Every fucking year every award goes to Disney (who just copy Pixar's formula now) or Pixar over studios that are starving for cash, producing amazing animated films and need something like an Academy Award to give them hype for their wide release.  Also Up! is flat out a terrible, terrible film and the most over rated thing ever put to film."
YMS,3an95k,Kropotki,3,Mon Jun 22 10:52:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's one thing to say Pixar is overrated. To say it's flat out shit is quite another.   OMG WHO WATCHES WEIRD CHINESE SHIT.*   This dismissive attitude pisses me off just as much as it pisses you off, but I think even without disrespecting Chinese cinema*, a lot of people, like me, just don't know ""When Marnie Was There"" even exists (I'll be sure to check it out). But you have to understand that America has one of, if not THE highest budgets alloted to films in the world, so you can't blame Americans too hard for watching predominantly American movies. Most of the rest of the world watches American movies too. I know budget isn't everything when it comes to cinema, but it's most of everything when it comes to action movies which are pretty popular. Other countries are more likely to want to dub our high-budget movies in their native tongue, and as a result, over the years there's been much better Foreign voice acting talent. Compare that to an old Bruce Lee movie with godawful dubbing, or the generally weaker voice acting of English dubbing in anime. The US just hasn't given enough fucks for an extended enough period of time to develop a terribly competitive voice acting market. And you know these people don't want to read, especially if their bringing their illiterate kids along, (which has led to the influx of shitty censored R movies becoming PG-13 movies). Fuck, there was an entire scene in the Chinese release of the Avengers where Tony Stark goes on a rant about the evils of capitalism to pander to the Chinese market. The Red Dawn remake was catered to Chinese audiences by focusing on North Korea rather than China. I don't think other countries (besides maybe Japan) are taking these measures because they don't expect their movies to cross borders.   Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille and WALL-E.  Now these movies aren't the best thing ever (and arguably not even by far the best animated films of their respected years), but they are decent films.    What do you think would be better films from that time frame?  I think people really love Pixar, because of the cinematography. The dialogue in Pixar films is generally a lot less obnoxious than Dreamworks. You might be right that their marketed towards 20 year olds, and I don't see how its a problem to keep your film open to an older audience. If it's not good enough for an adult to watch and be stimulated by, then it shouldn't make money. If you want to stimulate a dumb baby brain, you don't need much more than ring of keys to shake infront of their face.   Also Up! is flat out a terrible, terrible film and the most over rated thing ever put to film.   Terrible? How? Over-rated maybe, but is it more over-rated, then Transformers?

This is pissing me off even more.   http://www.cartoonbrew.com/award-season-focus/proof-that-oscar-voters-are-clueless-about-animation-109456.html  http://www.cartoonbrew.com/award-season-focus/definitive-proof-that-academy-voters-are-ignorant-about-animation-96680.html  http://www.cartoonbrew.com/award-season-focus/one-corporation-cannot-own-the-animated-feature-oscar-109566.html  http://www.rotoscopers.com/2015/02/24/the-problem-with-animation-and-the-academy/   I only watch the ones that my kid wants to see, so I didn’t see [The] Boxtrolls but I saw Big Hero 6 and I saw [How to Train Your] Dragon [2]. We both connected to Big Hero 6 — I just found it to be more satisfying. The biggest snub for me was Chris Miller and Phil Lord not getting in for [The] Lego [Movie]. When a movie is that successful and culturally hits all the right chords and does that kind of box-office — for that movie not to be in over these two obscure freakin’ Chinese fuckin’ things that nobody ever freakin’ saw [an apparent reference to the Japanese film The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, as well as the Irish film Song of the Sea]? That is my biggest bitch. Most people didn’t even know what they were! How does that happen? That, to me, is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen. MY VOTE: Big Hero 6   If you want to look at the Academy as a whole, 8/13 awards have gone to Disney/Pixar. A Studio Ghibli film only won when it was marketed in the US under the Pixar brand and was published by Pixar and had a Pixar for your consideration sent out with it.  So realistically looking at it, only 4 films have ever beaten Pixar/Disney circlejerk and that's Shrek, Wallace and Gromit, Rango and Happy Feet. In 2009 alone, Coraline, Fantastic Mr Fox and The Secret of the Kells, 3 of the most celebrated films by fans of animation lost to fucking Up! and in 2011 and 2005 we saw no Pixar or Disney releases so Rango and Wallace and Gromit were able to take it. (which narrows it down to, only 2 films have ever beaten Pixar/Disney, Shrek and Happy Feet.)  The Academy Awards are incredibly important to animation as most studios don't have a budget for marketing. There is no way in the west that Ghibli would be the name it is today if Spirited Away didn't win the award in 2002 (even if it was released and marketed as Pixar), it's a travesty that Disney and Pixar get a free pass and massive marketing boost every single fucking year."

YMS,3anzok,sharkbait2015,2,Mon Jun 22 02:06:53 2015 UTC,"Similar to how Adam feels about Lion King as his 3rd pick for favorite movies, Watchmen (specifically Director's Cut) is one of my favorite movies because it is a movie that I can consistently watch whatever mood I am in and still enjoy it. Its a movie that I can go back to and enjoy anytime, even though I admit it is not a flawless movie. I for one do love the ending change, but overall, I would still definitely rate the graphic novel above it in the storytelling and world building aspects. Obviously, as it is a movie, it wins out in visuals. The entire Mars scene with Manhattan is my favorite scene and is an example of how I think Zack Snyder can actually direct pretty well when he puts the work in. In contrast, I also think that some of his overuse of slow motion got a little out of hand at some scenes, and more of fault to the form of movies, some of the atmosphere fell down the drain from the novel as he couldn't simply make the movie super long. Song choice was mostly to the benefit of the movie. The beginning scene's Unforgettable and the opening credits' The Times They Are A-Changin' were amazing, with Pruit Igoe and Prophecies on the Mars scene being an absolutely flawless pick. On the other side, I will never forgive the butchering of Hallelujah they put for the sex scene, just completely takes me out of the movie every time.   Really though, I can talk about the movie and novel so much, so I don't want to just ramble on. Final ""my score"" would be a 9/10 (or like 9.5 if I wanted to be uneven) and final ""Adum score"" which is more critical of what I love would be a 7/10"

YMS,3anzok,BrotherCheese,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:31:15 2015 UTC,"I personally found the movie to be mostly sublime. And I agree with the people who liked the movie ending more than the graphic novel ending. SPOILERS: in the graphic novel there is a doomsday device created by Ozymandias that generates massive energy fields that vaporize several population centers on Earth and he leaves a trail that makes the world governments believe that it was a mysterious alien race. In the movie he ties the event to Dr. Manhattan instead, believing that Dr. Manhattan has already shown himself willing to leave Earth and never return, and it makes sense to do it that way since, as long as Dr. Manhattan is out of the picture, whether or not he actually did it and his presence is completely unfalsifiable, making him a constant credible threat. whether or not aliens attacked could be more easilly falsifiable or put into doubt and invoke further investigation into the matter which might lead back to Ozy and end the new peace. And it ties the story together more perfectly."

But the film did have great acting and some memorable scenes (The dentist scene to be specific)"
YMS,3akl4l,DubyaC,2,Sun Jun 21 03:01:43 2015 UTC,"What about it made it feel ""terribly paced?"" I though the pacing was excellent towards establishing the atmosphere and mood of the film: the staggering, confused, paranoid psyche prevalent in stoner/hippy communities at the end of the 1960s. The story is intentionally convoluted and hard to follow to create the feeling Doc is having in the viewer, and I think it does that expertly. While I love the story and the characters, I can't debate if you simply don't give a shit about them, but I think it's an oversight of what the plot is really doing to call the pacing ""terrible."""
YMS,3akl4l,DubyaC,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:20:37 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with convoluted and non linear films (2001 A Space Odyssey is my 3rd favorite of all time) and I understand the plot was meant to feel like that. But since it was executed in such a manner it made it impossible to care about what was happening, which made the last 30 or so minutes of the film me hoping this will be the last scene. And addition to that, I felt that the dialogue while well written at many points, was impossible to understand because it seemed like everyone was fucking whispering the entire film."
YMS,3akl4l,TheWarOnImpalas,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:26:23 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call 2001 convoluted and definitely not non linear, it happens in chronological order, just over several millennia, but that's besides the point. I don't know what you mean by ""executed in such a manner,"" I felt it was very technically accomplished and I loved all the acting, but maybe we're just different. The dialogue is rushed and hard to understand, I see your complaint there. I didn't catch a lot of it on the first time through in the theater but rewatching it at home I didn't have nearly as tough a time, although I did have to go back sometimes and put on subtitles for the more difficult parts to hear, but I do that with plenty of movies and I felt like it was worth it because the dialogue was great (I've not read the book so I'm not sure how much of Pynchon's dialogue is used but I wouldn't be surprised if it was a lot because it all feels very Pynchonesque). I'm not trying to convince you of it's worth, I'm sure I won't be able to get you to look at it in a different light, but I absolutely adore this movie, it's already in my all time top 20, and there are a lot of issues I can understand or just write off as a different strokes kinda thing (like someone not caring about the characters) but I can't see how it's terribly paced at all, but I guess something about it just works for me that doesn't work for you."

'Terribly paced' wasn't the best choice of words on my part but even after watching it multiple times I still think that the scenes that seemed crucial to the plot were just thrown in there like the scene at the mental hospital, it just ended without any real explanation . And after watching it twice through (the second watch rewinding a lot as to receive the full plot of the story) I still have absolutely no idea of what the hell was going on with half the characters, I thought I understood Owen Wilson's character (the only character I really cared what happened to) but then I watched it again I now I have no idea what the fuck was going on with him. I guess I just couldn't get into the story so I haven't been interested enough to understand what the fuck half of these hippie monologues given throughout the film are supposed to mean."

There's nothing too original or creative in the premise; it's about the execution, as is often the case.  Although there were some plotholes (my main issue is the ellipsis), it still worked on a number of levels and is open to some interesting interpretations eg Riley has male and female emotion avatars because she's a tomboy.

YMS,3ahdqe,what_words_may_come,2,Tue Jun 30 09:08:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not the guy you originally responded to, but can I give my own opinion anyway?   I think the thing I liked most about this movie was its ending. I loved that she went from only being able to express one emotion at a time to being able to experience emotions complexly. The movie is about her growing up and transitioning into a young adult and I think this movie captured that pretty well. I've worked with kids pretty closely and the way the main character is only  acting happy or sad (or whatever emotion) seemed pretty realistic. Or when it was something a little overwhelming there were multiple emotions she could have shown, the way one emotion won out over the others nailed how kids act. So at the end of the film when a new memory formed that was both sad and happy, I found it really touching. It showed a transition from just one dimensional memories to more nuanced feelings. Along with that, I liked that the control panel was upgraded to something more complex as well so that all the emotions could interact at the same time. This was the most visual change in the movie that showed her inner thoughts being closer to the thoughts of her parents. I also liked that they touched on depression a little by showing that without happiness or sadness she couldn't really feel anything. Also the reasoning as to why she ran away seemed to be pretty realistic considering she's 11. None of this is really something you talked about in your review though, which is a little understandable since it was only brought up in like two scenes at the very end. That's one of the faults I have with the movie, as I wish they spent more time developing those feelings.   As for the unique factor of the movie: While people have done the whole ""characters based on emotions controlling thoughts and actions"" thing before, I couldn't tell you an example of one that was done successfully on the same scale as this movie. The only time I've heard of Herman's Head was when people started comparing it Inside Out. I looked it up and it looks like it ran for a couple of seasons, so apparently it was popular when it aired, but I don't think it's something that people really cared about and they definitely don't care about it now. I think the thing most people are talking about in regards to Inside Out's originality is that it combined the emotion characters with different places: imagination land, the dream studios, the subconscious, the memory dump, etc. The way that long term memory looked like the wrinkles in a brain, the way memories faded and were sucked away into the memory dump, the way catchy jingles kept popping up at unwanted times, the whole abstract thought sequence, the bit where facts and opinions get shuffled up on the train of thought, etc. Even down to the double helix handrails in the control center. If you're comparing it to something like Herman's Head where it just seems like they're in a crowded living room, this movie really does seem more original and thought out. While these are things that other shows have done, I think they were clearly more developed and, to my knowledge, I don't know of anything that compiled all of these aspects in the same way that Inside Out has. That being said, I think they spent too much time on these places rather than focusing on what happened to Riley when the memories changed or her mental development at the end. And a lot of it was pretty stereotypical too. Clowns are her biggest fears? Really? I expected something a little more clever. And you're so goddamned right about her not being able to play hockey all of the sudden. What? Seriously?   But to me the biggest drawback of this film was that it didn't seem like it had a clear audience, which is what I think you were arguing in your review. I saw it in the movie with a bunch of kids with their parents and a bunch of adults who were there alone. I think Pixar knew that would be the case, so they tried to touch on the different complex emotions, like depression or finding meaning and purpose in being sad, and while simplifying it to the point where kids could understand. But to me the film seemed like it was too smart for kids to fully appreciate and too dumbed down to really develop those deeper scenes. I would love to see this movie aimed at adults when Riley is 10 years older and leaving college.   That being said I really liked this film. There were some other faults that I had with it, but I think that overall it was a good film and I'll probably end up seeing it again."
YMS,3ahdqe,ArcherGorgon,-2,Mon Jun 22 19:25:25 2015 UTC,"Adam, the audience's personal response is the only thing that matters in determining a film's quality. And the intelligence, and creativity of the script is second to that. /s"

YMS,3ahdqe,TheHof125,0,Sun Jun 21 18:04:14 2015 UTC,"Adam, the audience's personal response is the only thing that matters in determining a film's quality   My response to The Boy Next Door was hysterical laughter and adoration. Does that mean the movie is good? Fuck no. It's an atrocity. Intelligence and creativity first and foremost."
YMS,3ahdqe,ArcherGorgon,0,Mon Jun 22 12:36:54 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that type of enjoyment is ironic in nature and could be construed as not genuine. I don't agree with that entirely, just playing devil's advocate."
YMS,3ahdqe,zgrove,6,Mon Jun 22 15:28:14 2015 UTC,"I agree. He still gives some good points, I just look at other reviews like the Lego Movie where he says it's ""as good as it can be while still keeping younger audiences in mind"" and then he throws that out the window for this movie holding it to way higher standards.  I think he focused a lot on the negative in this review, where he focused on the positive in the other review, and it made this one seem really cynical.  While the Lego Movie may have been better, I really don't think it's 3 points better. Just my opinion though, I thought it was kind of a classic Pixar movie that didn't do anything worse than the others, but nothing better either. I just don't think that should subtract from the score as a movie though."
YMS,3ahdqe,zgrove,12,Sat Jun 20 10:24:06 2015 UTC,The Lego Movie had infinitely more to offer than Inside Out. The Lego Movie was a constant social commentary on society while making fun of familiar film tropes at the same time. It also had some of the most unique animation I've ever seen. There's new things you can pick up in each scene on your third+ watch. Inside Out just appeals to emotions without offering much beyond that.
YMS,3ahdqe,OfficerTwix,3,Sat Jun 20 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I just mainly saw it as the same comment on society dragged over two hours, which didn't detract from it, I just didn't think it made it stand out like you do. Just one guy's opinion though"
YMS,3ahdqe,family_guy_fan,4,Sun Jun 21 01:24:37 2015 UTC,I liked it. The premise wasn't too original but I found the whole memory aspect of it really creative.   I think John Ratzenberger should have been Bing Bong though. He just had two throwaway lines which is disappointing
YMS,3ahdqe,CasaBlacka,6,Sat Jun 20 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"I liked it a lot. I enjoyed watching it, to where i want to give it a 9/10, but realistically, it's more like a 7. But it's definitely my favorite Pixar film since ""Up"".    P.S. Ignore my username, I am not actually a family guy fan. Wish i could change that fucking thing."
YMS,3ahdqe,DubyaC,5,Sat Jun 20 12:34:45 2015 UTC,"Just make a new account bro, 120+ karma isn't that big of a loss if that's what's keeping you back from deleting your account."
YMS,3ahdqe,android_panda,4,Sat Jun 20 21:40:45 2015 UTC,"Slight Spoilers  I've not seen your review yet so I can't comment on anything from that but I loved it. I'm not huge into Pixar, but this movie really got me. I thought all the voice acting was great and it had an excellent cast, I thought the way it presented memories and personality traits and mental processes (abstract thought, the subconscious) and emotions were all clever and interesting, the animation was excellent, I loved the shimmering outlines of the emotions and the lighting and the way the ""camera"" shook as Riley was leaving home. I also loved Riley's whole storyline, I would have liked it if the movie had been a little more focused on her, because she was a legitimately interesting, human, emotionally complex child character, which isn't generally common in movies and I would have loved to see them do more with it (her cathartic monologue at the end also resonated so much with me that it moved me to tears).   I wish the plot wasn't the standard Pixar Murphy's Law plot that's so prominent in their movies now, while it can still be enthralling in the moment, it's ultimately a very cheap source of conflict and suspense, if instead of something wrong happening every 30 seconds there were maybe like two or three larger obstacles that they had to deal with over the course of the entire movie, the whole thing would have been much more focused and streamlined and it would have presented the opportunity for a greater exploration of some ideas that sounded really cool that they only hinted at (e.g. the abstract thought machine, instead of using that as a source for quick conflict that there's ultimately no real stress in, why not use it to present some cool visuals and try to see what it looks like when a 12 year old tries to understand the idea of loneliness, or further explore Riley's family dynamic, or further develop Riley herself, like I said).   I also really liked the humor, there were some times where the dialogue and jokes were easy and clichéd and pandering (Anger's obsession with swearing immediately comes to mind, it's obvious and feels so try hard to be tongue-in-cheek that it's closer to tongue-puncturing-through-cheek-and-wiggling-around-on-the-side-of-my-face), but there were other times that they connected really well, from the first scene in Dream Productions where the dream descends into nonspecific chaos to like the references to bears and Chinatown to the montage of emotions at the end, I thought it was much funnier than most of the Pixar movies I've seen, and it moved me in deeper ways that felt more true and genuine, like the speech and the turning point it represents. I wish the plot had been more focused with the conflict so it could explore other truly interesting and creative concepts it referenced to but didn't expand on and to even further develop the main character, and I wish the more pandering and cheap jokes and dialogue had been fixed, but for the most part I felt it was technically accomplished, it had great animation and acting, plenty of effective humor, and some truly palpable and literally heartfelt emotion that carried a heavy weight and was incredibly moving, for me at least. 3.5/4 stars, easy."
YMS,3ahdqe,OfficerTwix,6,Sun Jun 21 13:10:05 2015 UTC,"Eh. It was okay. Was I the only person who thought the animation of the emotions other than Riley was done lazily? Other than the animals, it seemed that they just copy and pasted the character models of Riley's emotions and put wigs on them."
YMS,3ahdqe,funktasticdog,13,Sat Jun 20 08:14:01 2015 UTC,What I don't understand is everyone else's emotions look just like them but Riley's looks nothing like her
YMS,3ahdqe,Sickfire22,3,Sat Jun 20 16:13:31 2015 UTC,"Because we're supposed to relate to Riley, she has to be something of a blank slate of sorts."
YMS,3ahdqe,ginandtonicismysteam,3,Mon Jun 22 21:42:42 2015 UTC,"I liked it a lot, and it was way more creative than Adam was giving it credit for (maybe not the core premise but you can tell they really rolled with the idea), but I was disappointed by the lack of external character development, Riley and her parents felt extremely surface level and that felt weird. Also they're missing that grounded tone that Walle had that made it feel so great. But overall like a 7.5, definitely a step in the right direction."
YMS,3ahdqe,lostsemicolon,3,Sat Jun 20 17:00:34 2015 UTC,"I liked it, even though it was derivative and cliche in a lot of areas (The hero's journey's formula is such a crutch IMO). Granted, I am a hell of a lot more of a Pixar fan than you, so I am biased in this movie's favor. I don't know why you didn't talk about the preceding short, because I thought it was really fucking bad, and wanted to know what you thought of it.   Also, what did you think of Jurassic World?"
YMS,3ahdqe,AveryGameLover,2,Sun Jun 21 07:31:24 2015 UTC,"It was better than I thought it was going to be. That's not saying much because the first trailer left me disappointed.  Pixar's gotten better at showing human emotion, so there's that.  I had a hard time believing how much the emotions cared about Riley when it was clear the emotions had agency and Riley didn't.  I was also a little bothered by the scene when Joy and Sadness first leave headquarters and land in a trolley full of memories and none of those memories turned sad even though that was a plot device no less than 3 times."
YMS,3ahdqe,teerre,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:46:02 2015 UTC,"Ehhhhhh, 6/10. Not the best, but not a bad film, I think you judged it a little to harshly this time around."
YMS,3ahdqe,anUnkindnezz,0,Sun Jun 21 02:47:37 2015 UTC,"I'm still wondering why so much talk about a Pixar movie either way  I mean, it's a kids movie (which is fine), it's not suppose to be quintessential art  Maybe it's an US thing to care so much about these movies, it's kinda surprising to me. In my circle of friends it's like whatever, we'll maybe watch it when it comes to TV or something"
YMS,3ahdqe,Gobblignash,3,Sat Jun 20 12:47:43 2015 UTC,It does feel a little crazy how much of a pedestal Pixar movies get put on in general. Most of my friends find themselves completely disinterested in these kinds of movies also.

YMS,3ahdqe,anUnkindnezz,-1,Sat Jun 20 16:53:10 2015 UTC,"Very true, I don't really care about these kinds of movies either way (the only kids movie I've ever enjoyed as an actual movie is princess Mononoke, and even then the ending is terrible), but it's odd to see so many actual adults come to its defence. I've never understood what you get out of watching movies made for small children when you're not one. It's like adults still reading Harry Potter, I just don't get it."
YMS,3ahdqe,The_Sven_Hoek,-1,Sat Jun 20 18:27:25 2015 UTC,"It felt like they recycled a bunch of old ideas mixed with the worn out Pixar storyline formula they use in all of their movies. Add that to flat one-sided characters, plot-holes, below average character design and animation that contrasted a lot with their great backgrounds.  People should remove their nostalgia glasses or whatever they have that makes them think Pixar should be on a pedestal. Sure, Pixar were revolutionaries when they started but now almost every other animation studio is doing better in some aspects (either stories or visuals). The best of Pixar is in their animations, where they put the style and artistic freedom in front of the rest."

The YouTube animators work at it full time as a career so I don't think they'd necessarily be willing to sign on if it wasn't paid, however the community is full of talented up and coming animators looking to get their start and I'm sure you could find someone or a handful of people to help produce content in exchange for some kind of cross promotion or something like that. There aren't a whole lot of animation communities, it would be cool to offer them a quid pro quo as they don't have a lot of opportunities to get their work out there. We could make some kind of promoted announcement on your behalf and help you find what you're looking for. If you're interested you can hit me up at jeff@hyunsdojo.com and I'll get you in touch with the community or vouch for you to the guys at Hyun's Dojo Studio.  You can check out some of their work at these links:  Hyun's Dojo Studio Portfolio  Hyun's Dojo YouTube Channel (all community made animations)  Hyun's Dojo Portal  Don't let the over abundance of stick figures dissuade you. It's a popular niche form of animation within the community, if you were to appeal to a specific style of animator you would certainly find plenty of people who'd fit the bill. Many of them are active within the community but post only to their own YouTube channels or work freelance.  EDIT: Also if you wish to cut the middle man out you can email the owner at hyun@hyunsdojo.com and he can do all the same things I can.

Unlike a couple of unoriginal Disney films; big hero 6, that act as if they revolutionized everything about animation but they are yet like any other film.  Ultimately what your stating is very true, but hey, hopefully they will go in a different, unexpected direction and not have a 30 minuet moping section where they reconnect and Po's like, Why did you leave me Dad?"

YMS,3aazns,virtu333,2,Thu Jun 18 18:35:19 2015 UTC,"It's funny you say that Adam is overrating originality because although Adam says this film is unoriginal and follows a formular other critics like Chris Stuckmann are saying it's original and unique. https://youtu.be/dYXFx27NiOw?t=48  Quote from that time in the video:    ""I think this is Pixars best film since Toy Story 3, this movie reminded me of the old days of pixar, clever, original, fresh, unique ideas that are actually very mature, surprisingly mature""   And honestly having not seen the film myself I don't know who to believe. I trust Adams opinion and I have agreed with his analysis on many films because he walks us through his reasoning and it's always logical but many critics on this film are disagreeing with the fundamental insights that Adam has and even Rotten Tomatoes is giving it a 99% rating and many of the top reviews on there are in stark contrast to Adam's review.  I'll need to see it myself I think, but I should be clear I don't think it really matters if Adam sees this film differently to other critics or even my own opinion on it after I see it."
YMS,3aazns,i_mormon_stuff,5,Fri Jun 19 14:09:29 2015 UTC,"To be frank I've never really trusted Adam's general takeaways, although I do like some of his in-depth, micro-level analysis.  Whiplash review was the worst offender....his claim that, ""as a musician"", he found the lack of perfect cohesion between the music and visuals to be very troubling, just really kind of epitomized how overly granular he gets. Some of my friends are literally some of the best (classical) musicians in the world and it's not something they gave a shit about (I'm a decent musician myself and I had nothing but a glancing thought). Combine that with the niche his youtube reviews fill and the character he acts (or is), and it's just not something I'm going to listen to without a grain of salt.  As for originality, I was referring Adam's interpretation of ""originality"" in the video, which is that of premise, not necessarily execution or even ideas or themes."
YMS,3aazns,virtu333,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:15:11 2015 UTC,I must admit I loved whiplash and although I'm no musician I never noticed any timing issues with the music to the video. Guess I'm not that perceptive.
YMS,3aazns,i_mormon_stuff,3,Fri Jun 19 14:17:23 2015 UTC,"I loved whiplash too and the lack of perfect synchronization did absolutely nothing to diminish that; I thought it was remarkable such a good actor was this good of a drummer in the first place.  And it's just an example of how warped I think Adam's general takeaways from movies can be. Similar to how the post engine noise reduction in Mad Max was such a huge sin to him. There's simply too much granularity and cynicism, although I see how it fits his niche."

They might enjoy it in a WTF kind of way, but I doubt they'd know what the fuck they just watched.  But anyways, maybe Fear and Loathing is one of those moves that I just can't find a way to enjoy. I am able to see good in almost anything, but I have tried on several occasions to watch it and it just seems like something I'd have a better grasp on if I got around to finally reading the book."

YMS,3a29at,MATERlAL,2,Tue Jun 16 17:42:17 2015 UTC,"Not my favorite Lynch film, but it is undoubtedly a masterpiece. When I turn 21, I'll probably celebrate by bringing some friends over, popping it in, and drinking PABST BLUE RIBBON!"
YMS,3a29at,AKrocker907,0,Wed Jun 17 07:08:11 2015 UTC,"In what way is it a masterpiece? I'd love to hear your explanation, because I can't wrap my head around why anyone would think this is a great movie. If it didn't have Lynch's name on it, I think it would've been mostly forgotten by now. I gotta see his other work, as I've heard people with similar views to mine about the movie say that it's the least impressive."
YMS,3a29at,AKrocker907,2,Wed Jun 17 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"It's scarier than probably any horror film I've ever seen, and its use of nostalgic imagery and music is very precise, therefore making the more horrific scenes much more horrific. The atmosphere is perfection, and it has Dennis Hopper's and Isabella Rossellini's most memorable performances. I don't agree on the idea that people only like it because Lynch made it, because most people hate Dune and A Fire Walk With Me (which I haven't seen) anyways."

YMS,39zn8w,RetroFan89,8,Tue Jun 16 03:28:33 2015 UTC,Found this movie in the children's DVD section once.  WTF Value Village?
YMS,39zn8w,DisgruntledPorcupine,6,Tue Jun 16 03:44:44 2015 UTC,"It's a bit overrated but I still think it's a good movie. There are stretches I find a bit uninteresting and dialogue I think is dumb as hell, but as a whole it makes up a solid viewing."
YMS,39zn8w,DubyaC,8,Tue Jun 16 04:37:08 2015 UTC,"I loved it the first time I watched it then hated it after my recent rewatch. The time travel stuff is so convoluted and of course it matters to create the ultimate plot, which I think is an analysis on the me-centric, mental issue embracing mindset of an angsty suburban teenager, but a lot of the Sci-Fi elements feel like they're functioning to give a false layer of depth and intelligence to the film that isn't really there.   The characters are almost all poorly developed, their dialogue and behavior feels so unnatural and forced. ""Go suck a fuck!"" ""Tell me, how does one suck a fuck?"" is one of the dumbest and most cringeworthy exchanges I've ever heard in any movie, and when Drew Barrymore asks the girl to sit next to the cutest boy, the movie is full of these horribly stupid moments that feel so fake. I know it's literally juvenilia and it's trying to comment on the absurdity of teenage social behavior and the environment of the suburbs but the method it uses to do this is very oversimplified, generalized, boring, and false. It sacrifices the value of the characters. There's nothing wrong with using your characters or diminishing their validity to comment on something (Dr. Strangelove is a great example), but to lose their value, to sacrifice them, by turning them into clichéd caricatures, it can be effective for humor, but for a work that's trying to seriously comment on the state of something (which unless I'm drastically misreading the tone and aim of the movie), it hurts the thing."

Sure, the stupid parts with the ""sit next to the cutest boy"" and there were some cheesy moments, but I still love it none the less. I didn't find the characters to be poorly developed, and the dialogue was meant to be cheesily funny, and just because it sounds stupid, doesn't mean that you can really consider that a flaw."

YMS,39zn8w,TrollaBot,3,Tue Jun 16 03:40:51 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite movies of all time. It's honestly not that great of a  FILM, but it is essentially the single movie that lead to me enjoying films in the way I do today. I love it in a way that I have never loved a movie since then. Obviously a very flawed movie for a handful of reasons and isn't the movie for everyone. It just happened to be exactly the movie for me. I think some people fail to make a distinction between their favorite movies and what they think are the best movies. To me there are movies I appreciate on a personal and emotional level and there are others that I appreciate on a technical level. The true magic of film is when the two coexist in a movie. Movies are and should be personal to some extent, but some people let that get in the way of understanding criticisms about their favorite movies."

YMS,39xiok,TheGreatZiegfeld,3,Mon Jun 15 23:41:33 2015 UTC,"After this, I looked through more of his videos, and I can see you're definitely right about the Nostalgia Critic influence.

Also, Nostalgia Critic rip-offs suffer from ALWAYS referencing NC, proving he's their biggest influence. Joshscorcher has his parodies of Bum Reviews (By Nostalgia Critic), both reference Big Lipped Alligator Moments (Coined in a Nostalgia Critic review), both mention Nostalgia Critic in passing (""As you know, Nostalgia Critic reviewed this in the past""), and both use terms commonplace with films in regards to other works, without understanding what the terms mean. (Enter brings up cinematography in regards to animated films, and Joshscorcher complains about plotholes when the thing he's referencing is just explained poorly, but entirely possible)  Some rip-off Nostalgia Critic with a BIT more tact, Autarch of Flame has some original jokes and characters, and the ones Nostalgia Critic hires at least have some edge to them, for better or worse. But Mr. Enter and Joshscorcher are the worst offenders that are remotely popular, there are countless others I've long forgotten about."

And /u/Babill's point still stands: the admins haven't banned a number of other subreddits that regularly harass people.  /r/cringe users harassed me.  A picture of me was posted on /r/cringe, some users found me on facebook, and I was sent a bunch of mocking messages.  I asked the /r/cringe mods to remove the post.  One mod mocked me.  Two said that I needed to send them a picture of me before they would take it down.  I declined, thinking that a mod of a subreddit like /r/cringe would use the picture to mock me further.   I told the admins but received no reply, and their subreddit still stands. (Imgur was kind enough to remove the images of me, as a side note.)  As to your other points, it's pretty clear that the admins have wanted to ban subreddits like FPH for a while now.  They've been discussing these bans in private subreddits for at least 6 months.  But subreddits like /r/cringe aren't getting to /r/all, so they get to exist in the shadows."

Look at KiA, they can't even link to other subs even with np links and they cannot link to public emails for emailing campaigns, while SRS freely links to other subs without even bothering with np links. How anyone can pretend that there isn't two speeds in the banning system is beyond me."

YMS,39th3e,ShrimpFood,21,Sun Jun 14 21:13:48 2015 UTC,"FPH would often post pictures of random people they saw in public to shame them.

Or the one time a woman posted in /r/sewing about a dress she made and that got harassment. Or when a couple met over GTA5 and that got cross-posted.      Alright, let's start linking actual examples of harassment and chronic toxicity that FPH has done.    Thread 1: An open letter to all the fat fats who may be lurking here...    Thread 2: Drama in /r/progresspics when OP's pictures get crossposted to /r/fatpeoplehate.     Thread 3: /r/fatpeoplehate is mentioned in a video by youtuber Boogie2988. Brigade happens on a comment he made in the the sub yesterday about his face.    Thread 4: Big girl on r/unexpected is compared to a planet. Comments are apparently gatecrashed by redditors from r/fatpeoplehate .    Thread 5: Redditor from /r/sewing posts pictures of herself wearing her new dress. Someone cross-posted those pictures to FPH and a drama wave happen.    Thread 6: This is a thread where a FPH user celebrates his co-worker's death    7: /r/fitshionvsfatshion: an entire sub dedicated to bullying how fat people dress and showing how it ""should be done""    Thread 8: Here's a post where a FPH user posts a dead woman's photos to mock them    9: Here's a sub they made to make fun of fat people at weddings    10: Two users met over GTAV, one of them was fat! This led to /r/FPH brigading the sub.    Thread 11: FPH brigades /r/suicidewatch and tells a suicidal redditor to kill himself.      There is no double standard. You can't even begin to list examples of how SRS has harassed users to nearly the same degree (like the examples I've posted above). The worse they do on a regular basis is link to comments they disagree with and yell at them. The things they say are not nearly on the same level as what FPH did on a regular basis.    I believe you have a strawman view of what SRS is. Sure they're loud and obnoxious, they're disagreeable and often not open to debate... But If you ventured into the sub there is no possible way you could remotely compare them to FPH.     Source because it's not worth formulating a different response for the same pro FPH anti-SRS comments every time.  E: Lol downvote it if you like, I know you didn't read it."

Here is a documentary about reddit that includes SRS admins admitting that SRS exists to mock and bully other reddit users.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXGs_7Yted8&t=4m  Of all the claims made here, the most ludicrous one is that reddit is being consistent with bannings. There are hundreds of more egregious subreddits than FPH, yet FPH is the only genuinely active sub to have been banned. You weren't even able to link intrareddit on FPH yet all the metareddit subs allow intrareddit links. Look at SRS, they just changed their rules to disallow NP links. Now the brigading and harassment is even more direct.

The person who is being inconsistent claiming that they're being consistent means nothing.   What on earth are you talking about? Let me write my claim again in clear words. The admins are consistent in banning subreddits that brigade or harass people. They don't ban based on 'egregiousness'. They ban based on actions.  Admins ban on subreddit behavior, not ideas.    No, they are blatantly banning ideas. That was in part the point Adam was making. If they were banning behavior then how could they be banning brand new subs with new mods and strict rules. That isn't ""ban evasion,"" it's a new sub that is subsequently banned for its ideas.   ""If they were banning behavior instead of ideas, then they wouldn't be removing every single FPH alternative. There's evidence to support that FPH violated site rules, so it's fine that they removed it. However, removing all alternative subreddits that come after the fact shows that is has nothing to do with the rules. Those new subreddits were under different moderation and many of them were created with strict rules so that they would exist whilst abiding by reddit's global rules. They're lying to our faces and I can't in good conscience support that."" -- YMS  He's right."

FPH did that, and they got banned for harassment. This isn't rocket science. If FPH stayed in their own little bubble like /r/coontown and every other bigoted sub did, they would not be banned.

Admins claimed that the harassment was spreading outside their community and that's exactly what's been happening for /r/cringe. Under Reddit admin claims, this subreddit would have to be deleted as well and that would be bs because it would be blatant censorship, but since it doesn't fall under SJW priorities, the admins don't care."

YMS,39th3e,Trekky0623,18,Mon Jun 15 00:41:58 2015 UTC,"Not so much rampant censorship, but Reddit is definitely moving toward the safe-space mentality being adopted by American universities recently, who have also adopted speech codes and facilitated a hostile environment that hampers intellectual diversity. The Reddit admins have said, ""It's not our site's goal to be a completely free-speech platform. We want to be a safe platform and we want to be a platform that also protects privacy at the same time.""  In other words, Reddit wants to move away from open and unhampered discussion to a place where people can interact without being confronted with uncomfortable ideas – a ""safe space."" This means the banning of certain subreddits that fulfill a purposefully vague definition of harassment who have leaked onto the front page, thus damaging the ""safety"" of the Reddit environment.  Moreover, if the Reddit admins define the majority mentality on Reddit – liberal, mid-20s, college-aged Americans with certain beliefs regarding social justice – as ""safe,"" then it follows that places that do not conform to that mentality are ""unsafe"" and require action to make them safer, requiring censorship to stop them. It seems that Adam disagrees with this mentality, and I for one agree with him."
YMS,39th3e,ShrimpFood,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"Is there not a certain safety found in a majority? I find reddit to often be hypocritical, where jokes about black people ""are just jokes"" but ooh boy if you bring up stereotypes about white people dancing...  Pick your hill to fight on dude. FPH is not a good hill to die on. They took part in a lot of harassment, and they made reddit look like shit to any outsiders. This is as much about harassment as it is about reddit's PR. If you wouldn't recommend reddit to an acquaintance or someone you don't know that well for fear of them stumbling on a place like FPH, then reddit as a business is doing something wrong. Reddit as a business took action, and cleaned up something that, free speech or not, made the site look idiotic. The collective tantrum thrown the last few days only solidified this idea.  Reddit is often in the red. ""Existing"" is probably prioritized slightly higher than ""free speech at all costs,"" and looking like an angry cesspool to investors is dumb."
YMS,39th3e,Trekky0623,12,Sun Jun 14 18:29:50 2015 UTC,"It isn't just the banning /r/fatpeoplehate, though. It's the comment massacres in /r/gaming during the beginning of the Gamergate thing. It's the banning of Gizmodo's article concerning /r/jailbait. It's the fact that the only default subreddit with political content currently is /r/TwoXChromosomes. It's the selective use of shadow banning with no clear idea as to what warrants one. It's allowing some subreddits to participate in political action by contacting congress and other contacts about SOPA and CISPA, while threatening to ban those who do the same thing with other ideologies, like contacting PR representatives regarding advertising as they tried to do over on /r/KotakuInAction. It's the overarching shift under the new management from a free speech platform to a safe-space platform that hampers intellectual diversity."
YMS,39th3e,ShrimpFood,0,Sun Jun 14 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"/r/gaming was trying to shut down a potential witch hunt. Regardless of what the truth or outcome of that story was, does an ex-boyfriend with a 9 page post entailing his ex's actions really seem that trustworthy? Regardless of the outcome, it's not /r/gaming's responsibility to host that conversation. It's not their responsibility to moderate that conversation as it surely would (and did) become a shitstorm quickly. The end result is they realized they're not getting paid for this shit, and told people to take it elsewhere.     It's the fact that the only default subreddit with political content currently is /r/TwoXChromosomes.   /r/videos is pretty much a puppet for whatever political slant people feel like upvoting. Same with /r/TiL (did you see the TIL post about a jew defending Nazis' right to free speech right after the ban of FPH? No coincidence there.) Yeah, they're not explicitly for espousing political views, but then again, neither is TwoX. I don't think you're completely wrong though. The admins defaulted it to try and make women feel more welcome and they ended up turning most of the comment sections into cesspools with a bunch of people saying ""I don't have personal experience, but.."" Becoming a default is a death sentence for any subreddit. It's why places like /r/askhistorians always opt out. There's my case example for good use of heavy moderation, btw.   It's the selective use of shadow banning with no clear idea as to what warrants one.   You're right and I agree: reddit needs transparency. For what it's worth, I've seen a couple admins say they intend on phasing out the archaic shadow ban sooner than later.   It's allowing some subreddits to participate in political action by contacting congress and other contacts about SOPA and CISPA, while threatening to ban those who do the same thing with other ideologies, like contacting PR representatives regarding advertising as they tried to do over on /r/KotakuInAction.   Lol yeah not even gonna try to defend them there, that was just stupid. At the very least, I would say the rules are fairly new, and they sure as hell won't be doing those mass-e-mails ever again; it might just be a matter of not retroactively enforcing rules again. It was still a hypocritical shitshow. IMO, neither should have happened.     It's the overarching shift under the new management from a free speech platform to a safe-space platform that hampers intellectual diversity.   Reddit has always claimed to be about free speech, but they're no pirate bay. Twist their wrist and they'll comply. This isn't new, though. Negative media attention has forced reddit's hand every time for years. Honestly, free speech at all costs just isn't financially feasible; it makes too many sponsors nervous. I'm quietly waiting for Voat to double down on the begging for donations when they realize a userbase that uses adblock and refuses to have any of their information compromised make really bad customers.     that hampers intellectual diversity.   Like I said man, pick your hill to die on. We're talking about /r/fatpeoplehate, /r/hamplanethatred, /r/transfags, /r/neofag, and /r/shitniggerssay. These are not the crown jewels of reddit.  I'm not seeing a whole lot of intellectual diversity. I'd rather defend the right to free speech after a peaceful protester gets arrested than, say, when a Nazi gets arrested for holding a parade through a Jewish neighborhood. Wouldn't you? There's no shortage of either , so why wouldn't I wait for the former scenario to pop up? There's a helluva stronger case for free speech to be made after the first scenario, anyways.   Pick better martyrs, then let's talk censorship."

YMS,39th3e,winterd,2,Sun Jun 14 19:58:55 2015 UTC,"This topic is huge and takes hours to cover. That's part of the point here - a lot of people who havent taken the time to understand the situation are sitting back and spouting their uninformed opinions on it. I'll try to cover a little.    I don't understand how this is biased censorship?    It's biased censorship because if they're actually trying to remove subs that harass groups and individuals then the entire metareddit subreddit group needed to go first. For example, the sole function of /r/shitredditsays is to mock and harass communities and individuals. Here is a mod from /r/srs even stating as much in a documentary:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXGs_7Yted8&t=4m  It is known that at least some of the reddit admins are sympathetic towards SRS (as shown in that video as well as the admins accidentally posting in SRS with their admin accounts). They won't ban the biggest harassment sub on the website because they are biased hypocrites.   FPH was covered in the media recently and imgur banned FPH. FPH responded by taking a public picture of imgur's management from imgur's website and posting it on their sub. Admins are seemingly using the use of a public photo as a reason to ban the sub and all related subs that pop up.   The admins, specifically Ellen Pao, are claiming that they aren't banning ideas, only behavior, yet, as adam pointed out, they are banning all of the new anti-fat-acceptance subs that pop up. How can they possibly be banning the behavior of subs and not the idea when the subs haven't even been around for 24 hours. They are blatantly banning ideas. They are, as Adam stated, lying to our faces.   Fph had nothing of value to say. I don't miss speech that's only intend and purpose is hate.   That's 100% irrelevant. It doesn't matter what value you find in subs. They should be allowed to exist. All opinions and views, no matter how ignorant or hateful, should be allowed to be expressed within their own communities. To suggest otherwise is to literally not understand the value of free speech itself.   As for ""harassment"", FPH is less of a harassment sub than hundreds of other subs. They didn't even allow intrareddit links. Know who does allow intrareddit links? The metareddit subreddits that exist entirely to mock and harass. Yet they still stand.   FPH was banned for personal, biased, politically-motivated reasons and anyone with a capacity for critical thinking, such as Adam, can see that is a blatant truth.   As for the scandals regarding Pao and her husband, they are both literally criminals that, among other things, stole millions of dollars from Louisiana firefighter retirement funds. Pao is actively trying to attain 2.7m$ in order to pay legal fees for having taken part in a multi-million dollar ponzi scheme. Also, Pao libeled Arnold Schwarzenegger and it was proven in court that she made things up about him in order to slander him and frame him for sexual assault. There's also the frivolous lawsuit against her former employer that was covered by the media, along with her resulting attempts at blackmailing them for, guess what, 2.7m$. She is an absolute scumbag and a literal criminal. These are only a few of the scandals."
YMS,39th3e,BattleChimp,10,Mon Jun 15 14:42:06 2015 UTC,Did SRS try to goad someone into attempting suicide?
YMS,39th3e,ShrimpFood,-5,Sun Jun 14 22:05:50 2015 UTC,"SRS has done plenty of abhorrent things. I'm unaware of FPH actively trying to destroy people's lives, livelihood and families, yet SRS has done that repeatedly. If one single abusive instance is justification for  FPH being banned then SRS has accrued hundreds of justifications for bannings."
YMS,39th3e,BattleChimp,18,Mon Jun 15 01:01:17 2015 UTC,"I'm unaware of FPH actively trying to destroy people's lives   now what?  You have to keep in mind a lot of these rules are relatively new. What SRS did 3 years ago does not matter, and there's no way in hell the admins are going to stick their hands in the pile of shit that is retroactive enforcement of rules that did not exist.  The new rules were placed, SRS mods reigned their shit in, FPH mods did not. At times, they encouraged targeting particular people. Don't even pretend sidebarring a picture of an autistic woman and then making a post about exactly why they sidebarred it wouldn't result in many more insults sent her way."
YMS,39th3e,ShrimpFood,-9,Mon Jun 15 09:06:42 2015 UTC,"When I said actively trying to destroy their lives, I didn't mean posting a publicly available picture and making fun of them. I meant actually trying to destroy their lives. Things like doxxing, calling your family, calling your employer, calling professional contacts. Destroying your career and family life (using overt lies, no less) is quite different than being mean to you on the internet... There is no comparison here. So yeah I still haven't seen anything to suggest that FPH has literally tried to ruin people's lives like SRS has been proven to have done time and again (and they still do it to this day.)   In that picture, is what they did bad? Yes. Do I support it? No. Is it the same thing as trying to destroy your livelihood the way SRS does? Lol no. It's deluded to think that being mean in text on the internet = trying to destroy your life, especially when compared to the serious attacks on peoples' lives that SRS has conducted repeatedly.  Let me know when FPH calls people's employer, family, professional contacts, local police station, local news station etc in an attempt to get them fired, to make them lose their family and even their home and liberty."
YMS,39th3e,Babill,6,Tue Jun 16 01:30:34 2015 UTC,"So telling a suicidal person in /r/SuicideWatch it's actually all their fault is no biggie. This is suicide watch. I trust you're not a regular there, because over there we make an effort to help people who are genuinely feeling like they're going to kill themselves. This is serious. If you don't think words over the internet can affect someone who is suicidal (and already in a state of irrationality) then you have no experience in the matter, and I'm not sure why you have an opinion in it then.   Stop making excuses  They didn't suceeed, you lost.  Suck it up buttercup. Life moves on.   These are not things you ever tell a suicidal person if your intention is for them to live through it. It displays a serious lack of empathy. There's your brigading too, btw. No way in hell would a regular of SW say any of these things.    Let me know when FPH calls people's employer, family, professional contacts, local police station, local news station etc in an attempt to get them fired, to make them lose their family and even their home and liberty.   I'd like an example of this actually happening where you can actually verify they're SRSers because you keep saying this, but I'm not sure why we're operating on the assumption that this has happened, without any proof.  You look at half the usernames in my screenshot, they're all complaining about Chairman Pao right now, so it's not hard to see where they stand on the issue. How about these evil SRS harpies who are ruining lives?  If you really want to actually prove a point, find a case of this where it's happened after the new rules, in the last year and a half or so. I don't think it's happened at all, but like I said, there's no way in hell admins would retroactively enforce rules that didn't exist before, so it's kind of a moot point if it's older than that. The metasphere was a different place; all of reddit was a different place 3 or so years ago. SRS has tried to reign in their bullshit as of late, but FPH did not."

The admins clearly just don’t want a subreddit devoted to something as juvenile, bigoted, and “edgy” as r/fatpeoplehate to be essentially advertised on their site. The banning of smaller subreddits that could potentially become as large as r/fatpeoplehate is a completely understandable means to this end. Reddit has, in the past, said they supported freedom of speech but, like all freedoms, this freedom has a limit. Just like you can’t find a person you dislike in real life, stalk them around, and tell them to kill themselves without expecting a punishment you cannot do the virtual proxy of such acts on Reddit and expect to not be punished. You can’t post shit about the owner of the website having affairs or husband issues on popular subreddits either, because she owns the goddamn website and doesn’t want to be shamed on her own goddamn website. The things that will get censored on Reddit are common sense that people should be accustomed to having experience living in a human society.   No smaller subreddit is going to be affected by these bans unless they do something such as harass many, many people, and even then they will probably not be affected. I’m fine with protesting and not wanting to support a website whose principles you disagree with, but to do so by shooting yourself in the foot is pretty dumb. Reddit is the largest and almost definitely the best place for a Youtuber such as Adam to have a place to discuss and share his work. Hell, Reddit is the reason Adam is popular. I personally would rather not become popular on a website that embraces freedom of speech to the point of supporting and spreading the ideas of the modern, internet equivalent of the KKK or make members of such a group have a better day with my videos, but that is just me and if you support freedom of speech on principle to such impractical extremes then whatever. There is a reason that 4chan is not nearly as popular as Reddit and why /b/ is not known for its stimulating conversation.  I still love your Youtube videos but if your subreddit dies you will probably get fewer views. Not everyone here is a die hard fan and not everyone here (myself included) will see all of your videos if you mainly post them somewhere else. Most other subreddits I follow see this scandal as what it is; a contrarian, reactionary, “muh freedom of speech” shitstorm of impractical changes for the sake of a principle. I don’t hate you or think you’re a dumbass because you are so attached to principle, but I disagree with being attached to principle to such a level and strongly warn you against making such decisions solely on principle.  Tl;dr Why get upset over this? It will affect no smaller subreddit. Everyone will get over it a month tops (i.e. gamergate, r/thefappening’s ban, r/jailbait’s ban I guess but no one cared because that subreddit wasn’t popular and popularity clearly drives correctness) and the argument in no way impacts movies or movie reviews. I will wholeheartedly support a move to a different website if this censorship develops to a level that affects this subreddit or movie reviews in general, and I like YMS enough to check his Youtube for uploaded videos occasionally if this subreddit dies to an unusable level (doubtful), but this move is still dumb and reactionary and wholly unnecessary. Pls don’t hate me I just disagree."

YMS,39th3e,EPOSZ,6,Sun Jun 14 21:07:17 2015 UTC,The reason they were banned was because they didn't stay in their cesspool. I was one of the people who started reporting FPH to the admins for harassing me and others outside of their subreddit.  I find it funny that FPH complains about censorship yet they were the most ban hammer happy of all subreddits for anyone who disagreed with their toxic ideologies
YMS,39th3e,Kumdogmillionaire,2,Sun Jun 14 19:53:51 2015 UTC,"Then why weren't the many other larger subs that are even worse for harassment of people out side their cesspool banned? SRS for example is arguably the worst, yet they are still rolling along fine. Would you like to know why? There are admins on its mod team and they like the sub.  They have a lopsided enforcement of vague rules that is only used when they disagree."
YMS,39th3e,Hadrial,-7,Wed Jun 24 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"SRS hasn't done any of that since the rule was put in place, also that sub is basically just reddit's boogeyman at this point. It's a shell of its former self, no one really goes there"

YMS,39th3e,Kumdogmillionaire,7,Sun Jun 14 18:17:19 2015 UTC,He still has a point. SRS is actively encouraging vote brigading.
YMS,39th3e,doyouwantapizzaroll,2,Sun Jun 14 19:04:44 2015 UTC,"Except it isn't, there are other subreddits with SRS like groups that do the vote brigading. I know it's slightly pedantic, but SRS itself isn't doing it, it's other subreddits like againstmensrights (which is mainly satirical in the first place)"
YMS,39th3e,doyouwantapizzaroll,4,Sun Jun 14 19:27:34 2015 UTC,againstmensrights (which is mainly satirical in the first place)   Yeah it was pretty hilarious when their mod satirically doxxed that guy for making a rape joke.
YMS,39th3e,Kumdogmillionaire,-7,Mon Jun 15 12:48:08 2015 UTC,But the first amendment only applies to the government so it's not actually censorship. Ha! Checkmate Adam!  /s  Edit: I guess people disliked the joke
YMS,39th3e,doyouwantapizzaroll,4,Mon Jun 15 01:41:36 2015 UTC,Well the first amendment does only apply to the government. A website doesn't owe you any freedom of speech
YMS,39th3e,Kumdogmillionaire,3,Sun Jun 14 23:07:13 2015 UTC,"No I'm pretty sure reddit is going to jail because they took away my free speech   But obviously since reddit functions as a media outlet, it is in fact a form of censorship when they suppress speech or ideas."
YMS,39th3e,doyouwantapizzaroll,-2,Sun Jun 14 19:42:52 2015 UTC,"I mean I'd agree with you, but their reason for banning fph was more based on harassment. If it was an ideological ban they would have gone for /r/fatlogic too"
YMS,39th3e,TheEnlightenedDick,3,Mon Jun 15 16:01:59 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt that fph and the other subs were involved in harassment, it's that I'm skeptical that they are more guilty than other, unbanned subs. Why should we believe that the law is being enforced without bias? Plenty of subs are involved in harassing behavior to some extent, usually individuals are punished. why did the mods decide that collective punishment was appropriate in this situation?  Frankly, I'm still pretty peeved that the admins didn't do shit when members of SRS started harassing me via social media after figuring out my real name somehow. They eventually tried to out me as trans to my friends and family and the admins never even wrote me back. It's pretty obvious that they are willing to turn a blind eye to harassment coming from certain subs."
YMS,39th3e,ShrimpFood,5,Sun Jun 14 19:28:58 2015 UTC,"No one is claiming that what they've done has violated the law. Before you link the XKCD comic about free speech, recognize that not all claims about free speech violations are based in violations of the first amendment.  Most people on reddit believe that they are entitled to freedom of speech as it is agreed to be a fundamental human right. When /u/doyouwantapizzaroll made the sarcastic comment, he/she was not claiming that this violated the first amendment, but rather that just because the first amendment doesn't address freedom to speech on a website doesn't mean that we can't try and hold them to the expectation of being moral and upholding it.  tl;dr: Just because it's not a violation of the first amendment doesn't mean it's not censorship."
YMS,39th3e,TheEnlightenedDick,2,Sun Jun 14 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"A business taking down a poster on its wall is not censorship, at least not in the way you seem to be using it. It is maintenance of private property. If there are rules against posting things on the wall, it's doubly less surprising when the poster is taken down.   Reddit could turn the site into one for sharing baked potatoes recipes tomorrow if they felt like it. Deciding they don't want a place called /r/fatpeoplehate or any of it's offspring on their site is not censorship for the sake of censorship. It's maintenance of public image for the sake of maintenance of public image.  There were rules, FPH broke them. FPH was too big to fly under the radar like other rule-breakers, and they got punished for it."
YMS,39th3e,ShrimpFood,3,Sun Jun 14 19:40:44 2015 UTC,"I was not arguing that it was not within their power to take it down. I thought I made that pretty clear in my comment.  I am saying that I think that it goes against a general moral code to censor anyone, in any situation, regardless of whether or not they are protected under the law. I think the majority of reddit would agree with that, otherwise there wouldn't have been the uproar that there was."
YMS,39th3e,Cyridius,0,Sun Jun 14 20:07:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's any general moral code that values bullying over censorship.   regardless of whether or not they are protected under the law.   nah. There were rules, rules were broken. Admins either had to let it go, or punish them. They chose to punish them.  You miss the point. They were being ""censored"" because of their actions, not their ideas. This is why other subs just as bad as them are getting away; those guys kept their heads down, and they didn't make reddit look like an angry cesspool.  Any single community can create an uproar; it takes maybe 2000 votes to get to /r/all, and since half of FPH had nothing better to do than post pictures of fat people all day, it made it to all. /r/all is entirely controlled by vocal minorities. There was an uproar after May-May June in /r/Atheism and other places back in 2013. Does that mean a majority of reddit thought banning memes was an infringement of rights? Not necessarily.  Reddit had 172,710,261 users last month. FPH was scratching the surface with their tantrum."
YMS,39th3e,hereforaday,-5,Sun Jun 14 20:20:09 2015 UTC,"This is just simply straight up incorrect information.   Reddit has been absolutely consistent with its banning. Like really your excuse is ""They're banning all the subs that were created to evade bans!""?   Why does this sub have moderators? Surely you wouldn't intend to censor people by deleting comments or banning them?"
YMS,39th3e,Hadrial,-12,Sun Jun 14 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"It hasn't really been banned though. There's still a big subreddit for housing the shittiest of opinions, they can just go there."

YMS,39u6yr,boompoe,6,Mon Jun 15 00:34:23 2015 UTC,I think people here just want to hate certain movies- especially popular ones and ones with bad trailers. When that M night movie comes out we're gonna see waves of the same exact posts regardless of the movies actual quality.
YMS,39u6yr,chevybow,2,Tue Jun 16 14:13:43 2015 UTC,"I watched the first Jurassic park three days before watching Jurassic world, and honest I don't think it was much better. I know its easy to chalk that up to ""well, its going to be worse because its older"", but I also recently saw Aliens and thought it was one of the best films ive seen in a long time.  Both required quite a bit a suspention of disbelief beyond ""there are dinosaurs"" and had pretty flat characters"

As for the product placement,  I wouldn't really complain about that because they at least adress it at the beginning."

YMS,39u6yr,takumout,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:00:49 2015 UTC,"The amount of plot conveniences were just horrible. People and events happened regardless of if it made sense or not because the script needed it to happen.   The dinosaurs traveled miles in seconds to where they were needed. In one moment, the raptors were by their paddock, the next, they are on the other side of the island because the plot needed them there.  The desine of the mozosaur exhibit showed rows of seats going out into the ocean, hundreds of feet away from the park.  But when the plot needs someone to be eaten by the mozosaur by wandering to close to the exibit, suddenly the exibit is right next to a walking path.  The raptors are just trained enough at the begining of the movie to put their heads up and down at the sound of a clicker, at the end of the movie, hours later, the raptors are a trained attack force that take direct orders from chris pratt  The main woman is logical when the script needs her to be, and illogical to the point of being dangerous to herself when the script needs it.  Even though the main dinosaur has killed lots of people and dinosaurs, they send a strike team in with non-lethal weapons. Totally inatequite tazers and nets. After directly seeing what the dinosaur was capable of , they literally sent a bunch of knives to a gun fight, because the script needs the dino to live.  When they lure the whofuckcaresosaurus  out in the open, with real guns and rocket launchers at the ready, they hover their laser sites on its face for literally about 45 seconds, not shooting. When it runs away back into the bush, they wait  little more AND THEN shoot at it, missing it.   They release a T-rex to fight the whofuckcaresosaurus, and after the whofuckcaresosaurus is dead, the main characters calm down and start to come out of hiding AS IF THE T-REX ISNT RIGHT THERE, LITERALLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM. Its like the movie forgot it existed after it did its job and killed the whofuckcaresosaurus  There are 4 raptors in the movie, they have lines in the movie where they say that they only ever bred four of them. 3 die during one scene, one gets ran over, one takes a direct hit from a rocket launcher, one gets shot in the head. All four re-appear later on, unscathed, like the script forgot it killed three of them. They all die at the hands of the whofuckcaresosaurus, yet one comes back again later, again alive and unscathed.  The whofuckcaresosaurus, when it does get shot, takes at least a couple dozen 50 cal bullets, doesn't slow it down, no blood etc. I dont care if your dino skin is a foot thick, that many banana bullets will kill you.   They have a giant gun on a helicopter, they go after the  whofuckcaresosaurus, who do they choose for a driver? OH YEA! The arrogant CO of the park who the movie already established is a shit pilot. He crashes the helicopter.    I could go on, but you get the idea"

I thought the ending fight was great up until the big bad dies. Chris Pratt was my favorite part of this movie, but I'm a little biased. I'd say a 4 or 5 out of 10. It was by no means a bad movie, and even some parts that I thought would be cheesy were handled well, but overall it's just not that great.

Boring characters making stupid decisions and the most cartoony villain possible. I saw it in 2D and the CGI was also pretty underwhelming for 2015. During the scene with the gyro-ball, it never looked like the kids were looking at dinosaurs, just looking around at a green screen. Chris Pratt was decent to good. Also several stupid moments such as <SPOILERS> the T-Rex deciding to leave the raptor alone at the end.

I still wanna bang Bryce Dallas Howard though."
YMS,39ocbq,JASON9818,2,Sat Jun 13 12:11:09 2015 UTC,"On an entertainment level I'd give it a 7  On the actual quality of the film, it's a 6.  Kind of funny, decent action, cheesy dialogue and characters, decent acting(for the most part), some wasted potential here and there, and an eh plot. Camerawork, cinematography and soundtrack(besides the original score) isn't much to talk about, either. Overall, an alright movie. I don't think it was really trying to be anything great. I think it was just trying to be your usual, fun,  summer blockbuster. So I can safely say it did its job. Certainly was better than the other sequels, but is still no match for the original film.  Side notes:  There was a few parts where I think it would have worked better if they used some practical effects. For example, the part where they're about to release the raptors and their heads are in those little holding cages. I think it possibly would've been cooler if they used some robotic raptor heads instead of using cgi. The cgi was good, don't get me wrong. But there were so many parts like that where practical effects would've added that much more to the movie. But they decided to go the easy route and cgi the dinosaurs through the whole thing. Didn't ruin the dinosaurs for me, it just made them less believable.   EDIT: After letting it sit for a while, I now consider it a 5/10."
YMS,39ocbq,HuddahHuddahHuddah,4,Sat Jun 13 15:29:45 2015 UTC,"Jurassic Park is my favorite movie of all time. I give it a 10/10. With that in mind, I'll do my best to provide an honest rating here.  Starting from 5, I'll base my rating off of these criteria  The Plot: -2  The plot was predictable (but I mean it was supposed to be. We all knew what we wanted) and the plot with InGen was not well fleshed out at all. The Raptors were extremely bipolar, switching from fighting with and against the I-Rex in seconds.  The Characters: -2  The humans in this movie had less personality than the dinosaurs. You feel more sorrow and pain from the dying apatosaurus than any human save the park owner (who was admittedly pretty good). Owen was really cookie-cutter and somehow knew exactly what to do 100% of the time. He was untouchable and in a movie about the ferocity of nature, this didn't work. Chris Pratt was also sort of awkward for the role. Its painful to say it, but the most believable characters in the movie were the kids, and even then, the littler one was a level above the average dino nerd kid which made him a little unbelievable.  The Dinosaurs: +1  Every dinosaur in the movie is in the trailers. No unexpected appearances. However, the dinosaurs were very interesting and were very fleshed out in terms of their behaviors and thought processes. Although I'd have liked for every dinosaur from the past movies to have shown up in the theme park at some point, all the ones I needed to see were there.  The Visuals: +2  The island looked stunning as ever. Absolutely beautiful. The theme park looked real and huge. The dinosaurs, however, were far too colorful and cartoon looking. TRex and IRex were pretty good, but the raptors simply looked off to me. The Dimorphodon (the smaller pterodactyl) literally looked like scrappy doo. It's head was way too big for its body.  The action: +3  Safe to say this movie featured the best action of any dinosaur movie. The final fight along with every human vs dino encounter were all spectacular. It has been a very long time since a movie has gotten my heart racing from a fight scene.  With an overall score of +2 from average, I'd put this movie at 7/10."
YMS,39ocbq,SkepticShoc,3,Sat Jun 13 06:38:34 2015 UTC,"Dimorphodon looked weird to me as well until I looked at some research. That's certainly what it would look like with skin and muscles, no matter how dumb it looked."

There were so many unnecessary things shoved in our faces that have nothing to do with the story (i.e. one of the brothers actually started crying on a bus because he thought his parents will be divorced. We don't see the parents at all besides from the beginning and the end)  You know that a movie can't be great when the director of a dinosaur park is breeding a massive deadly dinosaur without even knowign what breeds it's made from."

I'll see what the early reviews are and then make my decision."
YMS,39n63t,BigHaircutPrime,4,Fri Jun 12 23:23:10 2015 UTC,"I know what you saying man. I chalked this movie up to my ""Under no circumstances should I watch this movie in-case of my money going to idiots"" list, but since James, the man who made some of my favorite movies(Aliens, Terminator, Terminator 2, and Titanic), I might just go and watch it."

I love most of Cameron's work and it'd be a shame if he was just trying to cash in, regardless of his reputation and credibility. I'd expect that from someone like Bay and even Spielberg to some extent, but as a(n admittedly casual) film-buff, I respect Cameron more than that."

Given his thoughts on the franchise in general, I don't know how I'd feel if the film bombed and suddenly he started backpeddling.  In the clip you see the thugs about to attack the original Terminator. I really wish someone would have given Bill Paxton a phonecall. Even if he's a lot older and it would have looked ridiculous, it would have made the scene so much better."

I don't like to think that way, though, as I feel you could make that argument about any non-documentary film."
YMS,39m8ho,hebrewwarrior69,3,Fri Jun 12 20:42:13 2015 UTC,"This film had a big effect on my film education. It was really one of the first films that got me in tune with the idea that I shouldn't think less of myself just because I don't understand a film the first time through. Before UC, a film that was incomprehensible to me made me feel bad about my lack of intelligence, and so I ended up resenting that movie. UC was beautifully shot, and the first time I watched through it, that's all I got out of it. Studying the plot and the process in making it led me to appreciate it so much more, and I started viewing seemingly complicated films afterwards as an opportunity to be educated and not as a verification of my own idiocy.  Upstream Color was amazingly well-done, and there's nothing wrong with being baffled with it on the first watch."

Also while there is no real reason for Toy Story 4 and Cars 3, I think the original Incredibles absolutely lended itself to a sequel, so I'm pretty excited for it (finally) being a thing."
YMS,39eja1,MammothMan34,48,Thu Jun 11 05:50:29 2015 UTC,"The only way The Incredibles lends itself to a sequel is that it ends with the Underminer and people mistake that as a good setup to another movie.  It's not, it's just a cute little way to reaffirm that superheroes are back in business.  I mean just rewatch his speech at the end, he literally says he's declaring war on peace and happiness.  He doesn't have any potential for a main antagonistic to a major movie, he's just a joke character.  Where do you honestly see Incredibles 2 going?  What could it possibly do that will make it stick out as more than a generic superhero movie or a rehash of the first?"
YMS,39eja1,TheChainsawNinja,26,Thu Jun 11 08:42:53 2015 UTC,"The first movie was about each Incredible coming to terms with something, whether it was Dash and his competitiveness, Violet and her timidness, or Mr. Incredible and his fear of losing his family. The strength of it is that these are broader struggles everyone faces, but used in the superhero context.  I think there is a clear way to tell a further story with each of these characters, but obviously further along in their lives. Off the top of my head Dash could probably deal with failure, Violet with the decision to start a family or not, and the parents with actual retirement. Furthermore there's always the wild card of Jack Jack, who was really just an analogy for limitless potential in the end of the first. Not only is it interesting to simply see how he grows up, but his story could go aby number of ways."
YMS,39eja1,MammothMan34,8,Thu Jun 11 08:52:36 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head Dash could probably deal with failure   Could work.   Violet with the decision to start a family or not   Violet with the decision to start a family when she asked out a boy for the first time at the end of the first movie?  Not to mention it begs romantic tension which will turn into an annoying subplot.   the parents with actual retirement   Just like the last movie?  Is Mr. Incredible Brett Favre?   Furthermore there's always the wild card of Jack Jack, who was really just an analogy for limitless potential in the end of the first.   Jack Jack is a creative liability, his powers are practically everything and his personality is practically nothing.  How do you design a scenario where Jack Jack isn't a catchall solution?  I can see there's room for Dash and Violet to grow and develop, but Helen and Bob feel to me like they have complete arcs and adding more would just trivialize or contradict the first movie."
YMS,39eja1,TheChainsawNinja,7,Thu Jun 11 09:13:11 2015 UTC,"Violet becoming more assertive and asking out a boy is not the same thing as making the decision to start a family.   Also while Mr. Incredible was in retirement to start the movie, it was forced and by the end of the film he was basically back to his peak form. I think there's still a story for when he's finally over the hill and done. Furthermore I think Helen didn't really have much of a character arc, so from the parents this could be a chance for her to bear the burden of the plot.  I don't think it's fair to say Jack Jack is a liability with no personality since he was a baby in the first movie, I don't think babies typically have a personality in movies. The sequel is a chance for him to actually do and add something. Also yeah his powers were a collection of sorts, but it would be an extreme stretch to say he suffers from Superman problems. Although now that you mention it, there could be a story there with Dash coming to terms with failure, especially in light of Jack Jack's success. And conversely Jack Jack trying to live up to his father's name, and always trying to be everything."
YMS,39eja1,MammothMan34,4,Thu Jun 11 09:36:54 2015 UTC,That could work. I would think they'll go the toy story 3 route as well and make the time gap between the first and second movie the same in the universe as it was in real life. That's at least a solid 12 years.

YMS,39eja1,The_Sven_Hoek,3,Thu Jun 11 18:21:55 2015 UTC,"I think the thing that lends itself to an Incredibles sequel is that they're human characters, several being children, who are going to age naturally. To make a parallel, Toy Story 3 is at least in concept a great idea - what happens to sentient toys when Andy grows up? Taking the opportunity to revisit Dash, Violet and Jack Jack 10 years later, as well as the parents dealing with this growth period, could in theory be interesting to watch. How do kids suddenly deal with a society that not only accepts their previously-spurned powers, but now heaps all of the enormous responsibility back onto them that their parents had to cope with years ago? Do they let it go to their head? Do they buckle? Of course, execution is everything, and I have less faith in 2016 Pixar than I did in 2004 Pixar."
YMS,39eja1,PunyParker826,3,Thu Jun 11 13:44:28 2015 UTC,"I assume Incredibles 2 will not be about the underminer. That scene was exactly what you said, and also was the setup the the videogame Rise of the Underminer. My guess is that Incredibles 2 will be set at least 10-20 years after the events in Incredibles. If it's really good, none of the original characters will be the main characters. Having Violet and Dash as secondary characters would be great, but none of them should be the lead focus. Maybe a grown up Jack-Jack could be interesting."

Hey superheros are back baby! Also after you go home and see this commertial, buy the video game! Incredibles 2 will probably get into Ashes early adolesence, Violet's early adulthood, and it will show The baby growing up, possibly to become some super prodigy which will possibly be the central plot of the movie. I expect it to be about growth and responsibility of some kind, because growing up and stuff."

YMS,39eja1,sudevsen,34,Sat Jul 11 18:06:01 2015 UTC,"I've also gotten to see the movie early, and I feel like he's missing the bigger picture of why all these plot-points are happening. I personally loved the movie and think it's one of the most nuanced films that Pixar has made, and where I think the movie really shines is that it does a great job of taking really abstract ideas of emotions and creating vivid and practical situations out of them, being able to show instead of tell, which I don't think Adam noticed at all.   (WARNING: SPOILERS)   For instance, I disagree that ""sadness decides to touch the emotion ball for absolutely no reason"", because one of the main themes of the movie is the danger of repressing emotions, and that's exactly what is happening with sadness.  While to us, it may seem like she has no reason for interfering with the memory spheres, if you think about it in the abstract sense, it's meant to symbolize how we deny and repress negative emotions to give the illusion that we're ok, even though that emotion needs to express itself. The entire rest of the movie is about Joy's realization that Sadness is one of the most important emotions, and that she needs to be able to express it unrestrained. On the human level, this is further reinforced when, early on, Riley's mom tells Riley she appreciates Riley's ability to keep a happy face during such a difficult time, then at the end, Riley finally lets herself embrace her sadness about the move and her family comes to her aid. What I think is so great about this portrayal is that the movie doesn't spoonfeed the audience by having Sadness say ""I have to do this no matter what, because Riley needs to feel sad"". It just shows Sadness interfering, and we as the audience get annoyed alongside Joy that Sadness is not staying in her circle (because that is how we as a society view sadness). I think that's far more true to how real emotions feel. You don't logically think ""this is a sad situation, I'm going to feel sad now""; you'll just be doing something and you'll all of a sudden get a lump in the throat, then you'll either let it happen, or another part of your brain will shove it away and say ""this isn't going to happen right now, we're in class or whatever"".  Another thing that I felt he misunderstood was with his pondering if having all the islands fall down meant she had no personality traits. I think it does mean that, but while Adam may have thought of it as ""she is now a blank slate"" it's more meant to be ""she is hollow and numb"", which still fits with the turmoil that is going on in her head with all the struggles of moving to a new place. It would have been trite to have the islands placed with opposites, because she's withdrawing emotionally, not just becoming a bad girl or whatever.  (SPOILERS OVER)  There's a lot more like this to analyze in the movie, but I just wanted to give my two cents because I think this really is one of Pixar's most creative movies, not because of the concept, but because of the subtleties of its execution, and I really hope that people don't get turned off of it by the review.  P.S. In the Bay Area, there actually are pizza places where you don't get to customize the pizza you want. They just make one or two types of really hipster-y pizzas and that's what you get. I also thought the joke wasn't really great, but not because it was unrealistic.  EDIT: Replaced ""with"" with ""alongside"" to clarify"
YMS,39eja1,wartadoo,11,Thu Jun 11 21:43:36 2015 UTC,"The pizza point was actually adressed in the movie. While they were walking away the mom said to the daughter: ""who only serves one kind of pizza at a resteraunt?""  Idk it kinda seemed like Adam didnt want to like the movie and tried to find faults in it only because it was a pixar movie. The events of the previous pixar films is a legitament critisicm, but other than that the deeper meaning of the emptions in that they acted how emotions are and not how we as a society think they should act. Adam also says in the critique that ""the only emotions people can have are:"" and then lists the names of the emotions, was kinda a petty argument against the movie. Good movie, and a (mostly)good reveiw, just kinda nitpicky and misinformed."

Like, obviously it's a kid's movie and this is reading too much into it, but does Pixar believe we live in this weird world where all of our actions are chalked up 100% to biological determinism/hormones/instincts? Do the characters in this film ever interact w/ their head voices because if not that's a pretty freaky world to live in, like IIRC in Osmosis Jones it was more like people had agency, and the people inside the people just tried to guide them/manage as best they could."
YMS,39eja1,_watching,4,Thu Jun 11 06:15:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought that the emotions would be more like a conscience.

Nah, I think it's just understood at this point that Pixar isn't going for realism.

YMS,39eja1,cinder-hella,4,Thu Jun 11 18:12:10 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad YMS reviewed this movie, and I agree with all the observations (as much as I could without having seen the film). I've been saying since the first teaser I saw that it sounded boring. The dissatisfied mother, disinterested/obtuse father and moody daughter tropes aren't new, or even interesting. The concept of characters powered by anthropomorphic emotions (who apparently do have their own emotions?) is so messy and sounded incredibly difficult to pull off from a writers' perspective. Is the little girl clearly the main character? That sounds like it would get confusing. And it's interesting that the frumpy, weepy character of Sadness causes most of the problems in the film, and who the bubbly, pretty Joy considers ""useless"" (let me know if I misinterpreted that from the review). What kind of message does that send about people who have depression? It has a lot of unfortunate implications and feels very off to me.   The creator comments I was seeing were odd as well. I think it was the director, and he said the film ""started as a movie about growing up and ended as a movie about watching my kids grow up."" It sounded so weird. I don't know any children who can relate to that. It gave me the feeling that they were losing sight of their demographic (kids) by appealing to adults- which is probably exactly the case, with the appeal to emotion (no pun intended) when the trailers called on previous Pixar movies. Like, ""You have nostalgia about our movies, right? Admit it. Admit it. You loved Toy Story. You're morally obligated to continue giving us money."" Pixar depresses me way more than it entertains anymore. It's a shame. Thanks for the great review."
YMS,39eja1,headless_bourgeoisie,4,Thu Jun 11 20:07:32 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, Inside Out is nothing but weird messages to kids, like ""you have no control over your emotions"" and ""Anger and fear are inherently masculine characteristics while joy and sadness are inherently feminine characteristics"""
YMS,39eja1,cinder-hella,7,Thu Jun 11 21:02:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely. ""You're a helpless victim to the inept flat characters inside your head!"" And the coding of the characters was really unfortunate. The only male ones were Fear and Anger (why does the little girl have male-coded emotions? Her parents' emotions are all the same gender) and of the female ones, Sadness is the one who is fat and weepy, while Disgust and Joy are pretty and skinny and stereotypically feminine. Hey kids, sadness is ugly! Don't ever be sad or show emotions that could be inconvenient for others or you're also ugly and useless!"

I did see that he gave it an 8 on his IMDb, so I'm guessing he still really liked it."
YMS,39797m,DamonDeLarge,2,Wed Jun 10 01:16:32 2015 UTC,I guess I'm one of the few people that thought this film was on par with Kubrick's other films. But I can see why others don't enjoy it as much.
YMS,39797m,jimmybrite,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:21:10 2015 UTC,I just want to add in my 2 cents and I love most of Kubrick's films but I just could not get into that movie at all.

My gaming channel exists to turn my free time into something that other people can enjoy. If I were to cater toward what you want out of my channel, I would be forcing myself to be something I'm not, which is ironically what you're suggesting I shouldn't be doing.   I'm making improvements to my gaming channel in whatever ways I can, and I'm overall trying my best to be entertaining in my streams. However, I'm not willing to play games in a way that I would stop having fun playing them. The Walking Dead game was a giant piece of shit. I was unable to enjoy myself by taking it seriously, so I enjoyed myself by not taking it seriously.   I play games in the same way that I review movies. I dissect them. I want to see how they work. I want to see how they hold up under a microscope. I want to see how they work mechanically. I want to test their limits. I want to dick around. I want to have fun.   I spend way more time than I should on my YMS reviews and the games I stream are part of the little free time I give myself. My gaming channel isn't my job. It's my free time and it would be nice to capitalize off of it if I could. I'm not going to start playing games in a way where I don't have fun playing them just so I can make more money off of it. I'm not about to start doing Happy Wheels videos either. This is how I enjoy myself. You don't have to be a part of my target audience for that channel because I know that there are others out there that feel the same way that I do.

YMS,38rhau,anUnkindness,3,Sat Jun 6 13:39:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone should tell you how to play a game, but like in The Last of Us/Left Behind for example when you're just making random noises and stuff over dialogue it's a little..disheartening? A lot of times we're watching the playthroughs to see your reactions to certain scenes, you know? I think some people want to see you approach games (especially cinematic ones like TLoU) and critique them in the same way you do movies. One thing I remember from your playthrough is you mentioning how much you liked the integration of the dialogue in a casual way - Joel mentioning his singing especially - and saying how you thought it would be cool if it was brought up again later. Yet when it was brought up after Joel's impalement, you didn't say a word about it and instead commented on the fact that the horse wasn't startled by the gunshot, something extremely pedantic and unimportant. I still do enjoy them and often find them entertaining, but the frustrations people have with them make sense."
YMS,38rhau,nohitter21,3,Sun Jun 7 01:27:10 2015 UTC,There are certain abnormalities and inconsistencies that distract me from other parts of the game and I'm much more likely to pick up extra details the more times I play a game (same reason why I watch movies several times before reviewing them). I can't really help what will bother or distract me and I can't really help what I notice and don't on my first playthrough.
YMS,38rhau,anUnkindness,4,Sun Jun 7 02:27:29 2015 UTC,"I agree that it can be hard to watch him playing some games where he doesn't even try to play them properly (like GTA for example) but in some other games he can make it funny and/or interesting like Beyond Two Souls or The Last Of Us respectively. That middle ground is the best way to go for these big games.   I think he could maybe try to play and stream some really bad and broken games as well, where he can make fun all he wants since the games are already really bad.  On a side note, I really like Mark English's editing of the gameplay."
YMS,38rhau,johnymyko,16,Sat Jun 6 13:20:45 2015 UTC,Totally agree. Adam talks about its important in movies to view movies how the director wanted them to be seen. But when it comes to games he couldnt give two shits about how the game developers wanted to present theyre games and so anything that happens he just jokes about or doesnt end up seeing because hes too busy trying to get glitches and make his character do silly things. And then will make comments about what he thinks of the game and critiques it while playing. This is the equivilent to me of someone watching the godfather while playing angry birds and then giving it a 4/10 because they got bored and couldnt follow it.

YMS,38n1u5,SpadesFairy,3,Fri Jun 5 10:58:22 2015 UTC,"I think the quality of the tattoo might be the most important thing, it's very poorly done. It looks like a prison tattoo or the sort of tattoo that a tattoo artist starting out would draw. I think that Maria may have given it to Adele which says a lot about Adele and Maria and their relationship. It's a strech but, it could be a visual pun - wearing her heart on her sleeve - with a tattoo given to her by the woman she later takes as her lover.  The tattoo itself reminds me of a constellation, thinking of Adele as a character it wouldn't suprise me if she put a little bit of stock in astrology."

YMS,38n1u5,tony_orlando,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:31:11 2015 UTC,"There are a few ways you could interpret it if you really wanted to though the crudeness of the tattoo makes any connection to a known symbol virtually impossible. I would love to know what that blue writing on her arm for the third picture says though, that might actually be the key to making a less nebulous interpretation.  Anyhow, these are the possibilities I could come up with:   My best and most researched interpretation is that Adele's tattoo is an asterisk. This conclusion was made after looking at lists upon lists of tattoos and symbols that could possibly represent something. To my surprise, the original use of an asterisk could be seen as relevant. Originally the asterisk was used to denote a birth on a family tree and it was the counterpart of a little dagger which represented a death. Adele's tattoo could serve to represent her family as it is vaguely shaped as a tree or a vine and again we see that there is one that is missing. It looks clear to me that the second asterisk leads down to presumably another symbol yet it is not there. Perhaps Caden is the odd one out in his family yet again and this fact is etched into Adele's skin as a permanent reminder.  The other, much less likely to be relevant, meaning I could come up with is that the tattoo depicts barbed wire. barbed wire is used in prisons to denote an inmate who is stuck imprisoned for life without hope of parole and more generally barbed wire brings the image of entrapment or enslavement to mind. This could mirror Adele's feelings towards her marriage with Caden. It's a stretch to call that tattoo barbed wire though, it was just the closest thing my mind could think of.

It is so called because it resembles a conventional image of a star. Computer scientists and mathematicians often call it a __star (as, for example, in the A* search algorithm or [C-algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C*-algebra)*), In English, an asterisk is usually five-pointed in sans-serif typefaces, six-pointed in serif typefaces, [citation needed] and six- or eight-pointed when handwritten. It can be used as censorship. It is also used on the internet to correct one's spelling, in which case it appears before or after the correct word.

YMS,38n1u5,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:13:38 2015 UTC,"About tattoos, I really like this interpretation of this Youtube comment on part 3.   6:55 I thought the tattoos are a metaphor for trauma or experiences that we carry with us. We find out later in the film that Olive is still hurt and bitter about not being with her father. At 9:46 Maria says ""I did that to her."" referring to the tattoo.  We later find out that Olive has this resentment for her father because Maria lied to her about him, tattooing her.  The tattoo could be a representation of those feelings, that mark her until she dies.  ""Everyone is tattooed."" Would seem to also be in line with this. The tattoos are hidden on both people. We only see Olive's tattoos because she is naked and vulnerable Claire also removes her clothes. When you reveal deep held and hidden feelings one also feels naked and vulnerable emotionally.  Claire's tattoo is hidden on her back and although they have had sex it is still hidden from him. Notice that she reveals her tattoo to him when she is obviously upset about feeling second place to his original wife which she had probably been sensing for a while i.e. repressed feelings, that stay with her until she dies. It is also possible that she didn't have the tattoo until after she had these feelings. That would explain why he didn't see it.  Finally note that the tattoo is on her back. For her to show it to him she has to be facing away from him. This shows the distance and detachment these feelings(tattoo) have created between them.   I really like this theory. Also because the tattoos can be seen as abstract. Tattooing an 11 year old? That's kinda illegal."

But yeah, other than that movie was really good."
YMS,38ouni,anUnkindnezz,2,Fri Jun 5 19:33:05 2015 UTC,I thought the bat scene was going to somehow have been staged by the kid or something. It didn't even look close to convincing.
YMS,38li87,Orccen,4,Fri Jun 5 00:05:46 2015 UTC,"One weird thing I needed to realize about films were that only the ""scene"" in question looked good, the rest of the filming area was filled with wires and crew and lighting and stuff. A 360 film would be hard to film on a technical level but no impossible. Also the whole vr headset would be expensive and members of the audience would miss some part of the movie because they're to caught up looking around. I can see a good 360 movie being made but It would have to be when  vr headsets are more prevalent.  Written on phone, please forgive autocrats errors."
YMS,38li87,OGsambone,2,Fri Jun 5 01:31:13 2015 UTC,"A director friend of mine is working on it, and if the project goes forward I'd be doing the production design.

Needless to say I'm both excited and slightly intimidated by the notion of dressing an entire world."
YMS,38li87,Daftney_Punk,4,Fri Jun 5 06:27:21 2015 UTC,"The technology is really amazing. But I don't think a feature length film would work well on the platform. It gets kid of exhausting to keep constantly moving the camera around, that I could imagine it getting really annoying after an hour. Also so much of cinema is about composition and almost every single cinema tool gets thrown out because of this. Additionally, shooting like this would be such a pain, because the crew would have to physically be somewhere else to not be in the frame. Full movies, No. Cool YouTube videos, Hell yeah!"

I love Ghibli as much as the next guy, and I really, really wanted to like this movie after being so disappointing by some of the other big-budget animated movies that came out last year.   There were some parts in this movie that I really liked, like the [SPOILERS] attempts by the lords to win Kaguya's favor or the running sequence seen in the trailer, even though it turned out to be just a fucking dream. [END SPOILERS]  For the most part, however, I thought this movie was a complete mess. The script made no sense, the characters were all either unlikable or unbelievable, and the animation was just okay (I know what kind of style they were going for, and they captured that essence well. However, from a technical standpoint it doesn't really hold up compared to other Ghibli films).  It's not an awful movie by any means, it's just a big step down in quality for Ghibli Films in my opinion. I'd give it a 5/10."

However, from a technical standpoint it doesn't really hold up compared to other Ghibli films). Oh wow, this movie was hand drawn with zero CGI or computer animation. What type of ""technical standpoint"" are you even talking about?   Also, a ""big step down?"" A movie that won critical acclaim with 100% at Rotten Tomatoes, got nominated for best animated film of the year at the Oscars, and I'm not saying that I won't agree that it could be your least favorite Ghibli film, but really? A ""big step down"" is a bit of strong language, and considering that it was directed by the co-founder of Studio Ghibli, I doubt that the movie was truly lacking skill or creative talent."
YMS,38if6a,LukeDescole,2,Thu Jun 4 23:57:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm glad you like the movie, but there's no need to get this worked up about my dislike of the movie. I wasn't trying to question how well the movie was received critically or how much talent was involved. And I did say that it was a big step down in my opinion.  I will, however, contest your first point that the script was based off of a thousand year old Japanese legend. First, that excuse doesn't make sense because I'm sure the writers had to add a lot content not in the original legend to better fit the movie format. The script itself still had to be written, it's not like it's all just ripped directly out of the legend.   Second, when I said the script didn't make sense to me, I meant the plot progression and character actions didn't make sense to me. I didn't mean that the magical elements of the story didn't make sense to me. They're supposed to not make sense."

YMS,38eux0,Ivanbeatnhoff,5,Wed Jun 3 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"This sounds like it could really end up doing what a million other low budget horrors are doing. Found footage scaries are plentiful and really run the risk of cliché since they're so cheap to produce. But, for what it's worth, the main points to avoid (from YMS and other sources): * Don't set up situations where it makes no sense for the POV to be filming, i.e. setting up the camera instead of running the fuck away. * Don't include exaggerated sound effects (such as at jumpscares). * Jumpscares are really cheap scares, anyway. * The shaky cam thing is only good for realism. Make sure we can still figure out what is going on; Cloverfield was nauseous, and Hunger Games had to avoid gore since it was for young teens. * Personal bugbears: Ending the film on the camera dropped and the protag dragged away / Phony claims of being based on a true story / The obligatory goofy guy.  But as I say, this subgenre is really risky. I'm not saying don't do it, but the bad outweighs the good at this point."

YMS,38eux0,ELEVENo6,3,Thu Jun 4 02:08:09 2015 UTC,How much experience do you have making movies. You intend on making it be a full length movie? I remember in my video production class I made a short like 3 min pokemon battle like video. Which was really bad and everything but even still with effects and editing it took ~2 months to perfect. Granted I was busy with other stuff but it was a lot of editing for such a short piece.  Just letting you know that it will be a huge time commitment. I would recommend making lots of smaller projects and get reviews on them before you go big. Otherwise this can become a failure fast. Good luck.
YMS,38eux0,kabbalahmonster,-2,Wed Jun 3 19:29:06 2015 UTC,"I know editing takes a LONG time (Adam always mentions it in his videos) but I have a guy who wants to edit for me. I plan to film all of it this month and July and give him time to get it finished in January. Since all our effects will be practical and I won't be adding in any music it shouldn't be too bad I would imagine. Just time consuming. I'm really excited though and this is mainly just a side project I'm doing with friends to help out for some college applications and what not.  I'm not trying to pursue a career in directing, this is just something I've always wanted to do."
YMS,38eux0,VoiceOfNobody,2,Wed Jun 3 19:45:26 2015 UTC,"Like he said, practice is great. I'm currently working on a featurette right now, and it's ridiculously time consuming for me, since I can't pay anyone, I'm doing nearly all the work aside from the acting. I practice making small videos first; I have about 50 on my channel, little stupid shorts; just things to get me used to getting the image I want with my camera, and then also getting better at editing.  You can't just ""see what happens"" by starting directly with a feature length film. It will fail miserably. You need to know what you're doing before taking on something so large."
YMS,38eux0,Spoggy,2,Wed Jun 3 23:07:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm learning that taking on a whole project will be very overwhelming. But honestly, if it ends up being crap I would just move on and not even post it anywhere. When it's finished and if it's decent I'll post it on here for you guys to pick it apart.   EDIT: just to expand on this because I was eating, if I trashed it it would be immediately after filming. I wouldn't dare wasting my editor guy's time. Also so you guys know where I'm coming from I'm a high schooler in Texas and I have some friends who just want to have fun and shoot a movie so I volunteered. This is very much a amateur film. I'm not trying to claim anything big with it I just wanted to take what I've learned from the last couple of years of reading reviews and reading about how movies are made and apply it. I have a huge interest in it and since we're doing it anyways might as well give it some thought. I didn't mean to come off thinking that this is just something I can spend like 5 hours on :( I'll be working all month and all next month trying to make something awesome!"

YMS,388dbn,Babill,12,Tue Jun 2 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"It's a theater movie. Seeing a trailer somewhere just isn't the same as in the theater with the sounds and designs and everything right in your face. I dunno if I'm even gonna bother getting it on Blu-Ray, it just won't be the same."

YMS,388dbn,Babill,13,Tue Jun 2 18:23:44 2015 UTC,"What makes the film transcend just being a good movie, for me, is the stunning attention to detail in camera work and editing. I've seen it 4 times in theatres. Before the last one I read specifically that the storyboards for the previs was designed intently to take into consideration even where the eyes of the audience are at the end of a shot, so that the point of interest in the following shot can be aligned to end up at around the same area. This allows for pacey, propulsive editing where they can still maintain good clarity. In post they apparently even cropped and shifted framing to achieve this effect maximally. Add to that that the film was heavily manipulated in frame rate aswell, where things were both sped up and slowed down just for the sake of making sure the shots are intelligible in the context of the edit.  Those kinds of things just don't come across in trailers, but they absolutely decide whether it's an average noise fest, or a carefully executed action masterpiece (which I believe it to be).  Glad also to hear the original score in at least one trailer though, it's so rare these days where stock trailer music is so prevalent."

YMS,388whf,BattleChimp,3,Sat Jun 6 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"20th Century Fox is pretty disgusting. Just look at David Fincher's experiences with them. He practically quit directing altogether after they ruined every single aspect of Alien 3 on set (and then reedited it, making it even worse). And then they handled Fight Club's advertising in the same clinical, awful way. Fight Club is basically a $30 million dollar art film, and, instead of advertising it to film buffs, they put ads on Wrestlemania, and edited the trailers to make it seem like a simple, fun guy movie. And then there's Fox Searchlight. How they expected Sunshine to succeed when they only put it in 10 theaters in the entire United States is beyond me. Fuck Fox."

All i've read, searching her in the last 5 minutes, is that she slept with some guys in the industry (possibly for publicity of her game). If that's it then I have to say, most male game developers would do the same thing if they had the option, so why is she hated?"
YMS,384cw1,sadfatlonely,5,Tue Jun 2 05:47:43 2015 UTC,"She made a forum of depressed, suicidal men scapegoats for a phony harassment campaign of which she profited massively from.  Also manipulated and cheated on her boyfriend."
YMS,384cw1,Seriou,7,Sat Jun 6 05:52:51 2015 UTC,"She's hated because she became very, very successful because or it. If a male does the same then he deserves just as much hate, but the stigma around her is not at all limited to her obvious lack of industrial integrity. I'll send a few links if you want to understand once I go off mobile.  Edit: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WkX5U7mRNnA  In due time might I get downvoted to by anti-ggers or whatever. Just decide your own opinion or the gal, doesn't really matter"
YMS,384cw1,Cageweek,7,Tue Jun 2 07:58:35 2015 UTC,Also she derailed the game dev reality show and lead to doxxing and harassing a 14 year old girl competitor. Then she took in thousands of dollars to get another one started for girl devs and then never did anything with the money.
YMS,384cw1,jhnhines,4,Tue Jun 2 21:47:42 2015 UTC,"Beyond sleeping her way to success, she's incredibly manipulative. She basically cries ""bully"" at anything and then begs for money because she's been through so much. There's a lot of evidence that ties her to closing twitter accounts that offended her, and manipulating journalism to her favor, which in turn, earns her more money."

YMS,384cw1,Tieblaster,3,Tue Jun 2 00:20:29 2015 UTC,"They raised a donation campaign for allisons broken hand/arm/whatever, made WAAAAAYYYY over goal (+$70k). Claimed the rest of the money was going into an indie game that never came out (hence they just pocketed the money) and got mad at the escapist when the escapist told them the extra money that was over goal should go into production of their show since they used the escapists resources to e-beg. It's on their wikipedia."
YMS,384cw1,Lpup,6,Wed Jun 3 20:01:41 2015 UTC,"They take the stance of ""games like Gone Home are art and everything like Hatred is holding games back as a medium"" and as a result they come off as insufferably smug. They think they're always right (even when they're not) and their audience is mainly the hipster crowd."
YMS,384cw1,noober98,3,Tue Jun 2 02:42:13 2015 UTC,"I still don't get who they are that people trust them on being all knowing gods of video games? I literally know nobody's name on EC yet for some reason I'm supposed to take their word that they understand games so deeply?  Plus when I watched their videos on games I DO know a lot about, they say stuff that's just really weird/wrong. Their Dark Souls 2 video comes to mind, how they said being an archer was ""easy mode"". I don't think they finished them game if they thought bow only made the game easier."
YMS,384cw1,Ashanmaril,2,Tue Jun 2 04:04:04 2015 UTC,"The bow in any Souls game is more for aggroing the enemy, in my opinion."

YMS,384cw1,OfficerTwix,12,Tue Jun 2 00:34:02 2015 UTC,"Yep! It's been going great in the shadows now that the media pushback has finally gone away. Operation Deepfreeze is underway to create a consolidated database on the lowered standards of behavior in journalism as of late. Websites like Kotaku and RockPaperShotgun have resorted to consistently begging for donations thanks to people emailing advertisers saying they won't buy from their company if they support unscrupulous websites. Old internet media is dying and is giving way to more open platforms like YouTube channels and the like.  So, yes, people still do care about this ""gamergate shit""."

YMS,385579,DerpytheH,0,Fri Jun 5 17:16:23 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind about Brote is that he's usually doing things by himself, unless he's playing games with his fans to see how well Free to play MMOs hold up.  Otherwise, he's usually just streaming and playing games, and angering Muslims by suggesting the Prophet Muhammad was a rabbit."
YMS,385579,roario,3,Fri Jun 5 15:02:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't have much hope for the game after episodes 1 and 2. The writing was cringey, and most of the characters, if not all, seemed a bit exaggerated to the point where they were very unrealistic and hard to like/feel empathy for. The biggest culprit for this was Chloe. In episode 3 though, what made the game turn around for me was the fact that everything started to come full circle; every bothersome aspect before then felt intentional, and the game seemed more self-aware. For example, when Chloe and Max sneak into the principal's office, Max is given the opportunity to view Chloe's ""student information sheet"". One line from her summary that sticks out is ""Even though Chloe is an intelligent student with potential, she chooses to squander it on empty rebellion against a non-mandatory institution."" It was comforting to know that the game was aware that Chloe's rebellion was basically towards nothing. This goes to show how much of her anger was inward, and the only thing to blame for this anger is how life has treated her (father's death, step-douche, two best friends leaving her). We are dealing with a grieving character who is desperately looking for stability but yet pushing herself away from it through her actions.  Now the fact that I can learn this much about a character through interacting and observing (and snooping through their stuff) could either say that the developers did a solid job or I'm just over-analyzing. I don't think I am though because of my next point: foreshadowing. Chloe parking in the handicapped spots, wanting to steal from the handicapped fund, and the ramp outside of her future house in the very end, these were all very subtle things scattered throughout more than one episode that once realized made the experience seem like it had more substance. I remember reading about more instances of recurring things, but I can't remember them off the top of my head. In my opinion, all of this makes me feel like the developers put care into the game. They went the extra mile and made it so those who thoroughly explore the game's world will be rewarded with satisfaction.  One last thing, the added aspect to the game's main mechanic where if you rewind in one room, you remain in that room but time still goes backwards, that was pretty neat and refreshing.   Sorry for the hella long reply (get it?), I just find this game really interesting!"
YMS,3853dy,TMBryant96,5,Mon Jun 1 22:33:37 2015 UTC,The third one is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. At least the previous 2 had something going for it. The third one wasn't even slightly enjoyable.

YMS,37ukzq,FullmetalCowgirl,2,Sun May 31 03:30:45 2015 UTC,"There's lots of TV shows I'd love him to review, but as the Walking Dead YMS shows, there's shit-tons more effort you have to put into watching, analyzing, and editing together footage for a show because of the sheer size of it.  A:TLA's first season alone is around ten hours, and the show doesn't hit its stride until season two.  So basically, TV shows are more difficult for this format of reviewing.  I'm sure there's another way of doing it, but I don't think Adam's the right guy for it."

YMS,37ncjy,strongpig,23,Thu May 28 22:15:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know about everyone else, but to me it feels inconsistent in style, the acting is somewhat good in mimicking the style of 80s movies, but sometimes it feels really forced(yes I know it's supposed to be over the top, but it feels like they are trying too hard.) Also, visually they sometimes nail the look of an 80s film, but it often is full of green screened shots, which end up making a bad contrast with the good 80s visuals. And also, I think they went overboard with the cgi, and should have stuck with blending practical effects with some cgi, as I know budget was a huge thing. Also, cgi wasn't huge until movies like terminator 2 and Jurassic Park, which were released in the 90s. I know they are working on a feature length version, but I feel that several improvements need to be made for this to become a great parody/homage."

YMS,37ncjy,FenrisianFang84,2,Sun May 31 07:09:09 2015 UTC,"My opinion is that it wasn't a bad movie, especially since it was made out of a kickstarter campaign. Having said that, the dialogue wasn't exactly good in a lot of the scenes and sometimes the cgi seemed a little jarring. A lot of it seemed kind of meh, but the trailer looked great so I was holding it to a pretty high standard.   The comedy parts were hit and miss for me, kind of like when I watch animated shows like Robot Chicken.   I was also pretty disappointed it didn't end with a mid-air high 5."

I'm still thinking of it, forgettable is simmering I'd never thought I'd hear about it."
YMS,37foja,TheseMenArePrawns,6,Wed May 27 11:27:21 2015 UTC,"I found Her really basic, I mean it is a masterpiece of film making and a can watch it over and over, but the story is felt like such a cop out, the second things get interesting with explorations of love in a post individual society and oh snap the AI have to leave, oh well.  It just felt like any generic love story, I mean the body double bit was entertaining but I don't think it explored the true implications of a monkey human brain interacting with a super intelligent computer. Especially in the ways that Ex Machina in terms of how a computer can manipulate a human.  You can make the argument that Samantha was exactly the person Theodore needed in order to make him take chances and advance as a person, but realistically lets say you design an AI that is able to evolve and give it the task of being the perfect personality for a person, I would have liked to see a much deeper exploration of how such AIs would mirror their users. They did expand on it a bit with how his friends AI was not her boyfriend, but I felt like to much of a distraction.  Assuming that an AI is designed to be the perfect match for a human, whether the AI's goal is to make the person better or to completely consume them, I would have liked to see more manipulative themes, moments when Theodore has is true weaknesses prayed upon by the AI in order for her to achieve her goals.   Maybe its too subtle and I don't appreciate the depth to which Theodore's weaknesses were explored,  and exploited. But Samantha motivation felt far to human, (which would have been fine if she had the intelligence of a human) for an AI capable of maintaining thousands of functional relationships, where were the short cuts, were were the guilt trips, the damsel in distress memes, they are part of romantic story telling for a reason and the fact that they weren't exploited or parodied appear as a glaring oversight in my mind."
YMS,37foja,Ex_Outis,3,Wed May 27 11:27:52 2015 UTC,"The closest I can think of that would fit in movies is Colossus: The Forbin Project. And even that, in the movies rather than books, is somewhat one sided. In terms of ""human creates successor it wants to fuck"" there's a semi-related genre. But most of them, like splice, are pretty bad. Of those Her and Embryo are the only ones I'd actually say are high quality movies rather than ""kinda-ok"" pulp."
YMS,37foja,ArcherGorgon,7,Wed May 27 10:04:20 2015 UTC,"Probably Ghost in the Shell. Blade Runner is alright, but it's pretty blunt, and it doesn't properly resolve the philosophical issues it brings up. Other than these two, you have 2001, but 2001 is less about the nuances of consciousness and more about man using tools to evolve (and more, obviously). After these three, you have the rest of the A.I. sci-fi schlock: I Robot, Chappie, Artificial Intelligence (2000), Bicentennial Man, and some others.   Her is excellent, but I don't think we should place it on the same philosophical grounds as Ex Machina or Ghost in the Shell. Her is more about life in a post-industrial world, and how humans cope with stress in the future. Not so much about if Samantha (the A.I in Her) is a conscious thing. Ex Machine accurately describes why Samantha couldn't be considered conscious anyways.  Regarding Ex Machina itself, I really don't agree with Adam on his score. The argument that ""these ideas have already been explored in better movies..."" is a complete fallacy. This is like saying that the majority of songs are bad because they all use similar chord progressions (like the A, C, E progression, if you know anything about music). The way I see it, movies (and story-telling in general) all use common themes, stemming back to the first works of fiction (Iliad, Gilgamesh, Aenid). Over time, we refine these themes to reflect what we see as important at the time. So Blade Runner treads a lot of the same ground as Ex Machina. But Ex Machina refines BR's themes to suit the 21st c.: for example, the ubiquitous internet search engines.  As well, Adam is misguided in saying that the film is less enjoyable because many conversations take on a ""lecture"" tone, where the two characters are just talking about the Philosophy of Mind. I don't think this is a negative, but it's also true that too much ""idea spouting"" turns a movie into a piece of shit (see Adam's review of 'Nymphomaniac'). But Ex Machina, I feel, earns the right to present these idea-based scenes. I don't feel it is too outrageous for the characters to being having these conversations, and I think the subject matter is deserving of these conversations. Films have a tough time in relaying concrete thoughts to the viewer, as films primary rely on implicit imagery (you know, that old phrase ""Show don't tell""). For example, it is difficult for a film to show the viewer that an android may not be a fully conscious being, and that it is instead merely a bunch of 'if-then' statements. But by using these philosophical conversations to frame the scenes with the android, Ex Machine is able to make the most of its themes.  TL;DR: Ex Machina deserves an 8 at least. Like come on Adam, Mad Max Fury Road isn't a better movie than Ex Machina."

YMS,36ud77,AJSTOOBE,3,Fri May 22 09:12:31 2015 UTC,"Great vid. The static cuts were a little painful on my headphones though. 0/10.  I too got a bit of an American Psycho vibe from the movie, but I thought maybe that's because it's the prototypical template for ""look how fancy this rich guy's life is"" filmmaking rather than intentional homage. I think Grey said he's 27 years old, too, just like Bateman. Perfect age to be a rich psycho, I guess.  I tried to like Maniac, but I had to bail due to all the scalpings. That's one of the things I just can't take. The amount of work put in to maintain the POV was impressive though."

YMS,36q6sb,jshorton,-2,Thu May 21 19:14:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with him that tumblr feminists and other gender political click bait websites are stupid. However, the director did choose to have some of the characters to be female, while other directors would probably have an all male cast (except for the wives; and they would probably do shit all but cry and complain).  My point is, in a world where most other directors are shitty at write women, it is kind of refreshing to see female characters that are cool and competent. So I think the movie deserves a little bit of praise for it."

YMS,36q6sb,Foxtrot56,15,Fri May 22 16:16:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to differentiate between cheese during something fun and cool, and cheese during something that's supposed to be dramatic and serious.     I had no problem with the cheese. The melodramatic flashbacks are in line with the Mad Max world. It's a staple of Mad Max to have dramatic moments like this. I found them cheesy, but I feel that they fit the movie just fine.    Also, I didn't find the sped-up footage distracting at all. This is also a staple of the franchise. It also helped that it was filmed at 48fps. Had it been filmed at 24fps it would have looked far too choppy for how abundantly it was used, and definitely would have been distracting. Most the movie was sped-up and i think that's fine. The movie definitely benefited from it. Action movies typically aren't that long and had the footage been played back normally, I'm sure we would have been looking at probably 3+ hrs. A long runtime for an action movie is generally a turnoff for people."

YMS,36q6sb,anUnkindness,5,Thu May 21 20:46:10 2015 UTC,"There is some definite symbolism with the group of women from the green place. All women and they carry seeds for plants with them. I think it would be wrong to not acknowledge what this movie says about gender since they seemed to have put a lot of thought into it.   As far as summer action movies go it is rare to see a female character both participate in violence and be a victim of violence. Women are treated fairly equal in this movie, you can't say the same for a movie like American Sniper (although the source material wouldn't allow it), Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America or even The Hobbit. Women are secluded to minimal roles or one or two token characters that break out of the mold."

Road Warrior, and the previous Mad Max movies could more arguably be said to be about the eventual downfall of Western Civilization from our overreliance on the earth. And leaving us grasping onto the last few remnants of the old war, being cars and oil.   Is that a valid interpretation? I think so. And using that setting to tell a story about gender is also equally valid.   Here's another example: The Twilight books uses vampires and werewolves to tell a story that are a reflection of the authors own Mormonism values  Or  The Hobbit is about the futility of quibbling nations, and a call-to-action to fight for a greater-good, which is influenced by the authors own disdain for the Great war.  I mean, I think both of these interpretations are met with responses that are basically ""hmm, yeah that's interesting"", but as soon as you bring in an interpretation informed by values of gender politics, that's when people start screaming 'Go back to Tumblr you SJW"".   Futhermore, as I said in another comment below, if this story was actually about Immortan Joe's kids escaping them, I think the interpretation of the story being a coming-of-age story would receive far less backlash. Only with gender people seem to get upset."
YMS,36q6sb,FriendlyPirate,2,Fri May 22 04:10:35 2015 UTC,"Hey Adam, haven't been around here a while, not sure why, but great video. I liked the film more than you did but it wasn't perfect and FUCKING THANK YOU those sequences of sped up footage took me out, to the point where during that opening chase sequence (with max and his flashbacks at the very beginning) I turned to my friend and asked if there was something wrong with our screening. He didn't notice. I thought I lost my fucking mind."

YMS,36q6sb,darksiderising,0,Fri May 22 17:36:41 2015 UTC,Could it have something to do with the fact that they were shooting at 48 fps in the cameras and down converting to 24 fps?   Edit: This information might be wrong.

Because the sped up shots were used in that movie because they couldn't simulate the cars goingfast in any other way. This time it was either a joke or as a nod to the Road warrior
YMS,36q6sb,Propolandante,-1,Wed May 27 01:20:58 2015 UTC,"I think the movie definitely has element of gender, like, that's important to its themes and stuff.   The male and female characters that are victim to Immortan Joe are hyper-caricatures of gender roles, with the War Boys being mindless, violent, death happy killing machines and the Breeders being well, breeders. The caricaturization of gender roles is harmful to both men and women, and that's whether the feminist stuff came from. The movie shits on patriarchy pretty hard. Nux is embraced emotionally by one of the women when this system breaks him, and this gives him confidence in himself and turns him to their cause."
YMS,36q6sb,TheWarOnImpalas,3,Thu May 21 06:46:22 2015 UTC,"I was very glad to notice that there wasn't any particular emphasis on the death of a female character just due to their gender, thing that happens in most of modern action movies. As you said, in the wasteland culture gender is meaningless, and Miller made it pretty clear treating all deaths the same. There's some emphasis on the death of the old woman with the seeds, but only because of the seeds, not because she's a woman."
YMS,36q6sb,Spliffa,7,Thu May 21 07:29:47 2015 UTC,"If you are trying to find gender politics in this movie, you certainly can. But you can also look at it as get away story from post apocalyptic future and both those options are equally possible. Like Adam said, if the story wasn't about wives of Immortan Joe, but for example about his children the story could be exactly the same and nobody would bat an eye. I don't think this is some deep gender commentary. It is possible, but I don't think so"
YMS,36q6sb,RyanMill344,1 point,Thu May 21 16:44:34 2015 UTC,"To me, it's not even that deep. The role of gender in this movie is strictly binary, and while it's a good thing given what we have in the current slate of mainstream Summer blockbusters, I wouldn't go ahead and say ""It's SUCH a profound piece of feminist movie-making!""  Edit: Furthermore, I think that if it was, say, about Immortan Joes kids escaping him and his home he built for them, I think many critics would leap at the chance to claim that this movie is a 'coming-of-age' narrative, depicting the rough transition of boys to men in not only this society, but Western culture at large. But as soon as some more feminist-minded writers start talking gender roles, it's then when people start saying: ""Ughg, quit looking for stuff that isn't there!"""

YMS,36qqdc,_SeanKlaus_,42,Sat May 23 20:23:26 2015 UTC,"I actually recorded a line where I said it's possible that it's an homage to earlier Mad Max films, but I deleted it when I considered that they weren't exactly a trademark of the series, but more so a technique used in films in general. Plenty of movies from every decade do the exact same thing so I wouldn't feel right implying as though it's exclusive to the series. It seems equally as likely that the choice was made without regard to mimicking the technique of previous films. There are dozens of dated effects used in the original films that weren't carried over into this one, mostly because they're just that: dated. All I was saying is that it's distracting to people who notice it more. I even made it clear that I wasn't docking points for those minute distractions. I don't see why I shouldn't mention it at all. It's a personal preference, just like some people get bothered by shaky cam even when it's artistically intentional. I should have made it clearer that I considered the possibility. Nobody should be treating his intentions as fact unless there are interviews from the director to back it up. I didn't treat it as such. I just said the technique is distracting."

YMS,36qqdc,ryanhadaway,2,Thu May 21 13:07:53 2015 UTC,"I feel pretty certain that it is a homage... the ""sped up footage"" thing wasn't - I don't think - that common. But like you said, it doesn't really matter that much anyways."
YMS,36qqdc,TheRingshifter,2,Thu May 21 23:52:21 2015 UTC,I noticed the some of the sped up sections and it immediately took me out of the movie every time. It's legitimate criticism.

YMS,36qqdc,CasualPotato,1 point,Mon May 25 10:28:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I can see how someone would think it's neat. The issue is that it's been used in movies so much (often as a cheat technique) and can be really jarring and obvious. It's like the wilhelm scream.

YMS,36qqdc,CasualPotato,2,Tue May 26 08:57:26 2015 UTC,"As far as I know Adam has seen many of the films that would be considered classics, he just doesn't talk about them that often in his YMS reviews because they aren't relevant. I mean he talked about the original Death Race in his Death Race 2 YMS so if he knows about that B movie, we can assume he has seen many other and more popular films from that time.  In a way I'm sort of glad he doesn't constantly refer to older films, if you do this it can come off as a desperate clinging to nostalgia. Take Half in the Bag for example, I love the show and I love RLM in general but I see nostalgia skewering their views of a film at times."

YMS,36ai9l,twosugarsdamnit,16,Sun May 17 19:47:27 2015 UTC,"I saw it on Thursday night and it has only gotten better in my mind.  No movie is perfect but it may be the best action movie of all time.    There was no shitty scene of the main characters falling in love or doing any of that crap, the plot was never just explained to us in long stretches of dialog that had no point but to tell us important plot information.  Everything just felt so fucking fluid, I totally understood the world and what was going on with very few lines wasted.    Also just goes to show people like Micheal bay, who always uses the defense of ""making movies for kids or foreign audiences"" that you can make a simple plot that is easy to grasp for anyone and still make it amazing."
YMS,36ai9l,jasondbg,5,Sun May 17 23:44:33 2015 UTC,"To reiterate what Jay said on Half in the Bag, it's amazing that despite him being 70, he is making films of higher quality than his previous projects."

YMS,36ai9l,ch00mbazch0clit,-6,Wed May 20 22:16:13 2015 UTC,"Here are my thoughts regarding the movie, and I have some questions regarding the movie that are bothering me.  *SPOILERS*  Why did the girl who likes NUX not freak out when he was just chilling on top of the train?   Why did Nux, completely go from super devoted to Joe, to the point he was gonna kill himself to blow something up, to the point where he just changes his mind immediately and starts being a friend? Nobody freaks out, not even max or furiousa.  I loved the first part of the movie and was hoping that it didn't end. But right after they meet the old grandmas and she has a very emotional scene about the green place disappearing, I thought the movie got a little meh. I wasn't very invested in the green place they were looking to find. Then they decided to go back to where they came? I was hoping they would get themselves captured and we would see more Joe and the empire that he's made from holding onto water. But the movie just ends. I'm gonna watch this movie again but that last act left me unsatisfied . Maybe it's just me?"
YMS,36ai9l,Dr_StrangeLovePHD,10,Sun May 17 21:12:34 2015 UTC,Why did the girl who likes NUX not freak out when he was just chilling on top of the train?     Train? Are you talking about the War Rig? If you're talking about the part I think you are then she didn't freak out because he didn't startle her. She heard him whimper. He was showing weakness and wasn't a threat.   Other than that /u/Cawsmonaut has you covered.
YMS,36ai9l,Cawsmonaut,19,Sun May 17 22:01:29 2015 UTC,"1) All of the girls are very against violence many times in the begging of the movie and they even stop Furiosa from killing him. Its not too surprising that she was caring towards Nux because of the way they act earlier in the film. I would have to watch the movie again to give a better answer. Viable complaint though.  2) Nux realized and states that Joe saw his ""blood bag"" had bested him and was driving the vehicle and felt he had failed Joe and would likely have killed him if he had returned. His only option was to run away. Also Max and Furiosa realize in the marsh/swamp that they were not going to be able to escape if they did not try to let Nux help them. They had no other choice and they also realized what position Nux was in and that he also had no choice. They were desperate. They also hold him at gunpoint through most of his initial helping which means they obviously didnt fully trust him. Nux was in love wiht red haired girl too. He wanted to save her more than he wanted to save himself. She was the only person to show him compassion in his life. She gave him hope (big theme of the movie) and that drove him to help.  3) They had to turn back because they trusted Max more than anything and max told them that their only real chance and was back in the citadel where they KNEW there was water and a hope for a future. They were once again desperate and felt there was no other choice."
YMS,36ai9l,ch00mbazch0clit,3,Sun May 17 21:41:29 2015 UTC,I still wish the plot would have been as creative as the movie's world itself but this does clear somethings up. Thanks for the insight.

YMS,369oma,jugular_majesty,4,Tue May 19 22:34:48 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to give my own opinions of the movie, but I have a feeling that Adam is probably going to have a similar view (especially since he gave it a 7 on imdb)  As far as world building and atmosphere go, the movie really blew me away, everything they did was commited to building and cementing the post-apocalyptic world that it took place in. It had so much potential to be great and a lot of the time it really was but I think it suffered from was the tendency to be very heavy handed. There were so many scenes were I felt that clever and subtle writing took a back seat to cheap jokes and boring explanation.  Its annoying because I think this great shell of a movie lost so much by a product of trying to make it more accessible to modern audiences. Its a problem thats common among a lot of hollywood films is that they dumb down a lot of the movie to try and appeal to as many people as possible.  At the end of the day though it succeeded in being a really fun movie to watch and if one thing comes through is that you can tell that everyone involved had a lot of fun making it"
YMS,369oma,megamuffins,10,Sun May 17 19:26:14 2015 UTC,There were so many scenes were I felt that clever and subtle writing took a back seat to cheap jokes and boring explanation.   Really? That's weird because I felt the exact opposite. What are some examples of this that you felt?
YMS,369oma,Silverhand7,4,Mon May 18 01:52:25 2015 UTC,"It's been a while but I'll give you some examples that I can remember. Spoilers if you haven't watched  The entire opening narration (not a fan of narration)  His flash backs to the the dead people, I found were very off putting, a few are okay for context but there were times when I showed like 10 back to back after you already get it  I felt reveal of the green place could've been done way better  When they were all sleeping in the rig and the warboy eats the bug off the girl. It was the first nice quiet moment where it seemed that everyone had reached mutual understanding and he was turning over a leaf to become a new person and then it was just like, ""heh make him eat it, it will be funny lel""  I'll need to rewatch the movie again, but basically its just that there were a bunch of things like that, which just momentarily took me out of the atmosphere, which is a shame because the atmosphere was amazing."
YMS,369oma,megamuffins,8,Mon May 18 04:15:54 2015 UTC,"Aside from the narration I almost completely disagree with you. I thought the writing was pretty good, and definitely not immersion-breaking."
YMS,369oma,Silverhand7,1 point,Mon May 18 05:29:39 2015 UTC,"I mean your allowed to disagree. I'll just take the reveal of the green place as an example of heavy handed writing. More spoilers  After driving past the area with all the crows you has questions about it and what its purpose was. You get to when she asks where the green place is and they say that she already passed it. In my head I was working out what they meant by that and then it started to hit me that maybe that was what that crow place was. Before I could really appreciate the severity of that, you had every other character in the movie chime in with ""ooh that crow place? the scary place? the crows? you know that place we past? like five minutes ago?""   If they left that a little less obvious and allowed people to come to that conclusion themselves it would have hit with so much more effect. However you would have been left with some audience members that may not figure it out which is what their trying to avoid."
YMS,369oma,megamuffins,6,Mon May 18 05:46:00 2015 UTC,"I suppose that does seem a bit obvious looking back at it, but I didn't make the connection before they said it, so it didn't bother me."

YMS,367ger,megamuffins,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:02:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have always said that he is biased with summer blockbusters. He always gives them a lower score no matter what."
YMS,367ger,SOCIALwICK,2,Sun May 17 17:14:32 2015 UTC,"A lot of hollywood blockbuster movies can be very heavy handed, having a very strong tendency to tell as opposed to show.  Its a product of trying to make movies for a mass market is that you want everyone to clearly understand and get everything that as such often you sacrifice personal interpretation and subtlety.  This is not really an issue for most casual filmgoers, because a lot of people are investing their money into the entertainment value of a movie, and are not necessarily too fussed about it. You'll find that reviewers and film enthusiasts appreciate the subtlety of writing a lot more and enjoy when films let them come up with their own ideas an analysis.  Just look at his videos regarding synecdoche new york and how his favourite movie is The Holy Mountain. Its pretty clear that Adam places a lot of value on how much a movie can make you think as opposed to simply the entertainment value. However its entertainment value that sells."
YMS,367ger,michaeldelbay,1 point,Sun May 17 19:52:41 2015 UTC,"While all of that is true. Not every film is like that. Different film makers try to accomplish different things. Charlie Kaufman may want you to analyze his film as much as possible and for you to make of it what you want. But, Matthew Vaughn may want you to just have fun while watching the movie. I think it is unfair when you judge a movie in what it wasn't trying to do. You may like movies that challenge you, that's great, I enjoy them too. But I also enjoy having fun while watching a movie, watching big action spectacle. Just because a movie is doing exactly that does not make it a bad movie, just like a movie having a shit ton of symbolism doesn't make it good (Only God Forgives). What I'm getting to here, is that you have to judge movies in what they are, and not have the same rubric you have with every other movie."
YMS,367ger,megamuffins,7,Thu May 21 04:36:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's a fair rating. The lack of character development and exposition could be jarring to some, and the fact that it's basically a big action scene might be boring for someone who has been desensitized to action scenes from contemporary blockbusters."
YMS,367ger,RootRice,2,Sun May 17 02:52:11 2015 UTC,SPOILIOPS. LOTS AND LOTS OF SPOILIOPS.  I feel as though there was enough character development TBH. With it taking place in the apocalypse it was clear that emotion and relationships were two things that they couldn't afford. They were so hardened by everything that they just did what they could. Honestly I found the smaller scenes of them breaking that illusion they put on themselves. Like Furiosa when she finds out that the green place doesn't extist and the mothers were mostly dead or Max tearing up a bit when he thought Furiosa was dead. They showed that they had no time for emotion when they left the one girl for dead by telling the regular girls (who were all in hysterics) that it was pointless. To be honest I really enjoyed how they did the characters.
YMS,367ger,anUnkindness,1 point,Sun May 17 02:56:14 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna copy and paste what I said about the movie in another thread.

YMS,367ger,RootRice,7,Sun May 17 19:36:18 2015 UTC,"I'd give it an 8. It makes sense he'd give it less though, it had some cool shots and choreography and it was well set but cinematographically it wasn't out of this world.  What makes the film an 8 rather than a 7 for me is the cool ass cars, the constant intensity, the neo-viking culture, and the post apocalyptic setting. But those are personal preferences and not necessarily related to the art of film. I'm not one to judge, but Adam doesn't seem like the kind of guy to enjoy those things as much as, say, me. Personally for me it was 8-9."
YMS,367ger,Trionout,4,Sat May 16 23:44:22 2015 UTC,"I enjoy all of those things, but I don't consider any of those things to be a relevant factor when determining the numerical rating of a film. They can affect my enjoyment, but my rating isn't synonymous with that."

YMS,367q4t,Socks192,-1,Sun May 17 16:53:42 2015 UTC,"I thought it was an interesting concept until it got to the point in trailer where it went from, ""somethings up with grandma and grampa is trying to keep kids safe while shes crazy"" to ""both are fucking off their rockers and want blood""  Granted, i already have the question of why intrailer the grandparents wanted their grandchildren to visit (assuming the grandparents wanted to murderalize them) but gramps in trailer was acting like he wanted them safe.....  Also, the oven scene might be on par with Unfriended's blender scene in narm value. I look forward to the chuckle I'll be having under the obligatory M. Night Shamalama movie watch."
YMS,367q4t,jhorn1,2,Sun May 17 02:50:25 2015 UTC,IMDb does list it as a comedy/horror. I guess that explains the goofiness
YMS,367q4t,chevybow,3,Sun May 17 03:26:50 2015 UTC,Trailer has been posted here a couple times before. Yes everyone is circlejerking over how awful they know its going to be without seeing it like they did with unfriended. Yes this sub hates M Night. Don't see why a reaction video or video in general is needed over a trailer to further increase the circlejerk of hating certain movies before they come out.

I mean, it was his plan to get her out and up until ava locked him in nathan's office he thought things were going well."
YMS,3648ob,bearjuani,3,Sat May 16 00:07:39 2015 UTC,"Well, Nathan reveals to him that she has been specifically designed to appeal to him (the whole facial-features-based-on-his-pornography-search-history... thing). He had been chosen for this test for his naivety. And if he truly is naive, then he should quickly change sides and admit mistake. At least, that's what I would have done. And I am an extremely naive guy."
YMS,3648ob,thefrontpageofreddit,6,Sat May 16 00:11:06 2015 UTC,But the point was that he fully 100% trusted Ava. He was delusional
YMS,3648ob,Waltz_Beat,2,Sat May 16 02:09:23 2015 UTC,I saw it as him not trusting Nathan. It's been a while since I saw the film (at the UK release) but it just seemed like he was so deluded into thinking Ava was into him that he'd do anything for her and that was his character flaw.
YMS,3648ob,Infintie_3ntropy,2,Sat May 16 02:47:14 2015 UTC,"I saw it about an hour ago as well. I saw his reaction as an extension of Ava passing Nathanael Turing test. He was too successful in that she completely dominated Caleb, manipulated him more than any human could."
YMS,3648ob,cxn,2,Sat May 16 03:58:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think his reaction was spot on. He grew close with ava and thought the feeling was mutual up until he was left stranded. He thought they were going to ""run away together"" if you will, right up until the very end. Caleb already had an idea that nathan was watching him and knew of the plan, and also already had a pretty good idea of the true nature of the test, but he fell for ava which is why he re-programmed the security the night before anyways, so that even if nathan knew about the plan to get him drunk, she would be freed regardless. He still thought ava had feelings for him, even if she was using him- he went along with being used because he cared for her. He probably couldn't care less that nathan was killed and probably thought he deserved it. Nathan's test was more successful than he ever could have hoped."

With all the mistakes in filmmaking, they still show incredible ambition and passion. Every mistake in the editing can be noticed by someone even without the slightest knowledge of the topic, whereas Adam usually does a good job at pointing out editing mistakes in movies people usually think are great movies. It would be like reviewing an Uwe Boll flick. Low hanging fruit.  Also, there's a reason why the most popular foreign movies are from Europe. I'm not at all familiar with Ugandan cinema, but the little I know about Bollywood movies is that a lot of things are incorrectly regarded as ""goofs"", but are actually just normal filmmaking techniques within the context of their extremely different culture. It could be just the same for African films."

I totally agree with you, there's no real reason to critique this film because of how shitty it is (and it is very shitty), for me it's a miracle this happened in the first place because  these people are making art in a situation where that's nearly impossible. I tip my hat to them, and there are much better (subject-wise, not quality) films for Adam to tackle."

YMS,360ipg,johnsaysthings,18,Fri May 15 01:46:07 2015 UTC,"Alright, after having seen the movie 5 times, here's the best interpretation I have of it.  The movie is about duality. Reality/fantasy, cinema/theater, love/admiration. The key sentence to understand the whole movie is ""you confuse love for admiration"". Keep it in mind... Riggan wants to get into theater to revive the admiration people had for him in the past, because it's the only way for him to feel loved again. I mean, his wife left him, his daughter hates him... He feels unloved and thinks that the best way to revive that love is by having people admire him again like they did in the past. The thing is, people only admire him for what he did in Birdman in the 90s. He associates admiration, love and freedom at the same time. The nostalgia he has for that time period is at the same time what he wants but what he want to be dissociated of (again, duality).  Now, at the end, he shoots himself in the head, destroying his nose. By doing that, he destroys the fantasy he has in his head (bye-bye and fuck you), which allow him to live fully in the real world. He got what he wanted, which is to be admired again, and feels free from what Birdman represented, living in the present and looking forward to the future. He jumps out of the window to fly, while not being associated to Birdman anymore. It's the ultimate freedom, the best he could hope for.  And again, the movie is about duality, so the fact that his daughter sees him just emphasizes that the line between reality and fiction has been blurred. Maybe that's just in Riggan's head, maybe he's really flying. The point is: Riggan is free. The symbol is more important than the facts in this case.  Hope this helps :)"

YMS,360ipg,ajsatx,6,Fri May 15 14:31:21 2015 UTC,"A couple, one that is more realistic and the others are just for fun.  1. He did commit suicide after getting what he wanted. He was adored the way he wanted to be, and had won back the love of most people in his life. His daughter is a still using drugs, so her expression might be her ""seeing"" her dad fly away, soaring like he always wanted to.  2. He actually had super powers the whole time and is choosing now to showcase them prominently to someone else, hes on the rise, who can stop him? Or  He killed himself at the play, the epilogue is just what he wanted to get out of life, though we don't know if its true."

YMS,360ipg,royalstaircase,1 point,Sat May 16 01:15:36 2015 UTC,"After seeing the film several times, and talking it over with friends of mine, this is what I have come up with: The movie can be surreal at times but it is not fantasy. What we see from him meditating to him shooting himself is all reality, with the exemption of his powers, which is all in his head. When he shoots himself, he dies and the shot cuts - keep in mind, one of the few cuts in the movie. Like what Alejandro G. Iñarritu has said in interviews, ""our life is one constant shot"". That is how he got the idea to do Birdman in one shot. I think that cut signifies the end of his life. What happens next is Riggan's fantasy pre-suicide; its what he imagines what would happen after he shoots himself. Everything has worked out perfectly: he only shoots his nose and gets a new one, everyone he cares about is there for him and loves him, the public is praying for him and his play got perfect reviews from the woman who vowed to shut it down. Finally, he has separated himself from Birdman and has gained the admiration and respect he so desperately wanted without him. He says good-bye to the past, and flies away."

Both my friend and I were highly entertained throughout the entire movie and there seemed to be very, VERY few things flawed about it. The story is great as well, not because it's incredibly indepth or well explained but more that it knows its place and doesn't take a front seat in the movie itself but instead allows you to be immersed in it with each new thing that comes in.  If you want to see a good action movie, Mad Max: Fury Road is your way to go."
YMS,35y2ho,Seluxer,1 point,Thu May 14 14:34:50 2015 UTC,"But it was all brawn and no soul. I personally wish it had spent more time on lore and making me feel for the characters.

YMS,35y2ho,limited_inc,2,Sat May 16 05:52:42 2015 UTC,But they did a good job humanizing the war boys by showing them as being manipulated by Immortan Joe. It was actually a relatively intelligent lore.

I was kind of looking forward to it, but after hearing about the high ratings and how misogynists on the internet are up in arms over the film's positive representation of women, now I can't wait.   EDIT: So I just saw it and I have to say, it was a really fun movie. The effects were mostly practical, save for what could only be pulled off with CGI. I don't think there was a single character I genuinely disliked, and the soundtrack was also great. I don't think the film had any glaring weakpoints. It comes highly recommended."

Charlize Theron's performance was fucking great. That being said, it made some choices in editing that I wasn't to big a fan of.. and it needed more explaination storywise than it had (and that's coming from a guy who has seen every Mad Max movie); I mean I'm not asking for a big Ghost Ridery narrative intro in the beginning, but with just a tiny bit more dialogue it wouldn't have been as sloppy feeling. Also that social commentary on abortion didn't feel as fully realized as it should have been. Just didn't need to be there IMO.  I loved it, though.

It's not only a great action film, it's an immersive, constantly propulsive operatic spectacle of a movie, with heaps of personality and a very reassuring, steady directorial hand.  If you've seen ""Fast Five"", the bank vault chase action sequence at the end of that is a sequence I hold in extremely high regard from an action filmmaking perspective. Fury Road kept that level of detail, planning, choreography and mayhem, and just sustained it throughout an entire film, yet with enough respite between action scenes to not be fatiguing. The lack of fatigue I experienced is also helped by a very nice soundmix which makes sure to not constantly assault you with sound.  It's a bit of a masterpiece really. Simple setup, incredibly effective delivery. Might be a perfect 10/10 score from me eventually, so it's safe to say I very much recommend it if you are the least bit interested in action films, and the higher your interest in the details of the genre, the more there is to love from a filmmaking perspective."

YMS,35y2ho,Krazy8s,-4,Sat May 16 05:56:02 2015 UTC,"Yep. Thought it was okay. The first couple of action scenes are mesmerising to watch, and the amount of excess put into the setpieces and choreography is astounding. Then about halfway through it sort of runs out of ideas and plods for a while until the final big action scene, which doesn't feel too different from the ones we've already seen. This wouldn't be as big of an issue if it had good characters or story to fall back on, but it doesn't.   I feel like I would've enjoyed it more if A) I had seen the original trilogy, B) Not had the 99% RT score clouding my expectations, and/or C) Was brought up on corny, mindless action films as a child."

YMS,35y2ho,sharmasker,7,Sat May 16 19:55:12 2015 UTC,"Literally anything else? But the point of establishing that as the central conflict is that it involves the whole cast in it, and ensures that as long as the movie does a good job of characterizing then the audience becomes engrossed in their journey.

Even their worst movie, Jupiter Ascending, is not bad. Just because a studio interferes and shits on your intentions as the filmmaker doesn't mean it's all your fault. Look at Babylon AD, for example. Also, the anti-matrix-sequels circlejerk is one of the most asinine circlejerks on the internet.  Bound, The Matrix trilogy, V for Vendetta, Ninja Assassin, Speed Racer, Cloud Atlas, Jupiter Ascending, even the screenplay for Assassins. Everything they've done is good and extremely unique. There is no other living filmmaker in the industry with a blockbuster filmography as unique as that.  And their new tv show Sense8 will probably be really sweet and unique too."

But Man of Steel is somewhat of a guilty pleasure. My liking for The Amazing Spiderman 1 is guiltless, as I think it's honestly great, and Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are fucking amazing in it.  A film that I think is extremely overrated is Spiderman 1, as Tobey Maguire is awful at acting, and the comedy is painfully unfunny and simply lame. Lastly, I think Dallas Buyers Club is extremely overrated, horribly written, with such an obviously one dimensional and panderous trans character that it was clear that the screenwriters didn't care anything about LGBT rights and just wanted to bait an Oscar…and it worked. Meanwhile, The Hunt, Prisoners, and Inside Llewyn Davis got barely any attention from the Academy."

YMS,35u6ti,alk3v,2,Fri May 15 02:00:38 2015 UTC,Unfriended was the best horror movie I have seen in years. The trailers made it look like shit but it was actually really well done
YMS,35u6ti,natedoggcata,2,Fri May 15 16:44:27 2015 UTC,Really? I haven't seen it but stayed clear because the trailers just kept on pretending like they were 'innovating' the genre and drew parallels to Paranormal Activity and the Blair Witch Project. All the while a bang average trailer made it look like Ouija 2.0.   What did they do right? I'm honestly curious.
YMS,35u6ti,LeprosySnail,5,Fri May 15 17:44:27 2015 UTC,"The trailer is filled with scenes that arent even in the movie. Also, the trailer does a HORRIBLE job of showing the actual tone of the movie. The entire movie takes place on the desktop of the main character and one thing the movie does extremely well is show how people use their computers these days.   Michael Goi, if you ever decide to make Megan is Missing 2, study this movie. THIS is how you show young people using the internet.   The main character is constantly swapping back and forth between Skype, Facebook, Google, Spotify etc etc. There are tons of small touches in the movie that make a huge difference such as when she is typing something out, she pauses, erases the message and writes something different.   As for the movie itself, the reason I loved it was because I thought the movie did a great job of creating tension throughout the movie. There is hardly any music in the movie at all so there arent any cliche rising high notes and then JUMP SCARE! There are jump scares in the movie but they are few and far between and when they happen, it makes sense. For instance, its completely silent, the main character is chatting away and then all of a sudden someone else in the Skype chat decides to shout at the top of their lungs. '  Another example would be when one of the main characters friends sends her to a website. You think its just a silly website, but as the movie goes on, you realize that no matter what she types into google, that website always shows up as the top link. I know it sounds silly but things like this were what I loved about the movie. These are the kinds of things that I find creepy in horror movies.   The movie is really short (hour and 11 minutes not counting the credits), and takes place in real time, but even with that short amount of time they manage keep you guessing. Even at the beginning of the film, creepy stuff starts happening. In the beginning its no big deal, but it keeps building and building and building until the kids realize they are fucked and the movie kicks it into high gear. There is also a sequence in the middle of the film that lasts about 15 minutes and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I cant really say much cause of spoilers. All I can say is that the cinematography at the end of this scene is brilliant.   Finally, I know a bunch of people ask questions like ""why dont they just log off? why dont they just call the police?"" You see why they cant do any of that in the movie and it actually makes sense. The fact that the movie is so short helps with this also.  This is really all I can say without giving away too much because talking about how the movie works would be a big spoiler. Is this movie a 10/10 masterpiece? No but its not as bad as most horror movies these days either. I went into the theater not expecting anything but came out surprised and happy."

YMS,35u6ti,LancasterDodd,1 point,Sat May 16 03:29:23 2015 UTC,"No, my logic is that the film is part of a different genre of filmmaking that most people don't like. Slow cinema. Bela Tarr, Tarkovsky, etc.  Some criticisms I agree about are that it's an ego project and whatnot, but the main complaint everyone has for the film is ""there's no plot!"", but that isn't a valid criticism. It would be if it was trying to be an action thriller, but it wasn't. It was trying to be an isolating and draining film and it succeeded through its long takes, minimal dialogue, and lack of plot.   Also Trash Humpers is hilarious."
YMS,35u6ti,AKrocker907,2,Sat May 16 07:22:07 2015 UTC,"So just because its part of a certain genre you can't criticize it on that level.

I think the most unpopular opinion I may have though is that the novels 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'The Shining' are far more enjoyable than their film adaptations.

YMS,35kafs,ArcherGorgon,1 point,Mon May 11 06:21:01 2015 UTC,"It's worth checking out if you like comic books. The flash is very different from Daredevil, it doesn't take it self to seriously and it's more of a 'fun' show while I think daredevil succeeds in the brutality and writing of the characters. So depending on what you're in to you might enjoy it, or not.  While the flash might be comparable with shows like arrow and agents of sheild (or even gotham) I think it 10x better in every aspect, especially the pacing which has been fantastic in the flash, it's only in season 1 and they have pretty much revealed/showed everything you wanted to see a fan when they could have dragged it out for multiple seasons like arrow did, or even worse like Smallville did (ughh can't believe i watched that show)   Anyways I definitely recommend giving The Flash a try."

It was written in one day, July 11, 1958, and first published in the March 1959 issue of Fantasy and Science Fiction magazine after being rejected by Playboy.  The story involves a number of paradoxes caused by time travel. In 1980, it was nominated for the coveted Balrog Award for short fiction.   ""'—All You Zombies—'"" further develops themes explored by the author in a previous work: ""By His Bootstraps"", published some 18 years earlier. Some of the same elements also appear later in The Cat Who Walks Through Walls (1985), including the Circle of Ouroboros and the Temporal Corps.

I mean, I'm not gonna lie that seeing Han and Chewie in the trailer didn't feel really great, but I think it will be for the best if it stays as a fan service rather than if they try to make Han essential part of the story. With all due respect, Han was all about being this cocksure action hero, that would be hard to replicate when Harrison Ford is 30 years older.   On the other hand Luke could very well replicate the role of Obi Wan in the original Star Wars movie, he even got the looks of old wise Jedi for sure.

I'm really interested in movie prosthetics and effects, so this was more cool than scary to me, but I definitely creeped some people out for the one night I wore it at Vancoufur 2015. The mask is good for a few more applications still, so I'll be getting some more use out of it still. I'm the kind of person who prefers realism, so I'm not ready to spend $4,000 on a horse fursuit (because apparently horse suits can only be pudgy). Considering this hot foam mask was only 200 bucks, I figured it was worth an experiment. My best option at this point would probably be to get one of those leather fetish horse masks or something, but those are also stupid expensive and apparently only made in Germany.  Anyway, I learned a lot about makeup & prosthetics (Thanks, Adrian!) and I'll keep that information on hand for future low-budget short film adventures. Also, I'd never put on contacts before in my life, but now I'm a pro at those black scleras (also very useful for future film projects). Those black scleras probably put the whole thing closer to the ""scary"" realm and farther away from the ""neat"" realm, but I still find them super cool. Also, anyone who's browsed my favorites list on FA would know that I'm more fond of ""scary"" than ""cute"". No regrets! Creeping people out was part of the fun. It was a furry convention, so it's not like I'd ever wear this outside of that environment. It's weird how spending 4 grand on an animal mask with a permanent happy face is somehow less creepy than what I did, but like I said, totally understandable. I don't take it seriously at all, so the reactions in this thread were entertaining to me."
YMS,34uvje,sefgray,5,Tue May 5 08:27:42 2015 UTC,"To be honest I wasn't TERRIFIED (i can even watch the whole 2 goofballs video by Sammy Catnipnik without being scared shitless), but the way the mask was revealed the first time in video was genuinely creepy for me - was not expecting to see something like that, I was thinking you were doing Filthy Frank impression or something at the beginning of the clip.   But yeah once you can see the mask with normal light it becomes more goofy (see what I did there) than creepy. I think the eyes being merged with the mask is what makes it look uncanny, and yor hair look kinda strange - i guess i expected to see some horse ears above it, but the mouth movement was stellar. I'm really looking forward to see your skill put to other work, would be dank"

He's interviewing these people who are just trying to do their jobs, and turning it into this deep, uncomfortable inspection of their pasts. I get that he's a reporter, but not everything needs to be deep, hard-hitting investigative journalism. It seems like he's largely taking advantage of the fact that these people do very public-facing jobs to try to get a story.  How would you feel if you were trying to take inventory at a store or drive a bus or whatever and some guy with a camera was asking you a bunch of personal questions about your past or your personality?

But there's laws against Channel 4 basically just advertising for a movie like that during a news segment. They have to at least pretend the interview is about something of substance - they're not allowed to advertise in that way.   Their hands are a little tied there.

It makes a lot of sense if what you say is true, like that would mean he's basically being forced to be a dick by his job. Which explains why he's sort of... idk. Saying things like ""you don't have to answer these questions, that I'm going to ask"" several times, like then why ask them? or things like giving a resigned laugh when they get frustrated with him.

Krishnan Guru Murthy normally does pretty dry interviews talking to politicians, he's very good at asking hard hitting questions and not being fobbed off. For example in one of his better interviews he grills an MP for only raising NHS wages by 3%.  He's either throwing them on purpose so channel 4 stop making him do them or he can't tun of hard hitting journalist mode like in this sketch written by Chris Morris;  https://youtu.be/G07sWzYObnk"

The Netflix Daredevil show had it's bright spots, but it was still formulaic and made the hero seem too invulnerable at parts.  Of the few Marvel movies I've enjoyed, they still have that ""hey audience, we know you're all retards so let us hold your hand through this devious web of the hero saving the day without getting hit once"" vibe to them that just makes them feel insignificant.  Guardians of the Galaxy, for example, goes out of its way to explain what's happening on screen (see the prison break scene).  I get that these movies are made for 15 year olds but even so, would it kill Marvel to, for once, not assume all 15 year olds are retarded and that the only people worth making movies for are teenagers?  This is why I like the DC movies, despite their flaws, they actually feel like movies rather than just ads for sequels and action figures."

I really did not care for the first avengers one bit, but I was able to really get behind this one and enjoyed it from start to finish. It has its flaws, of course, but you know what you're getting when you go to see a movie like this. Watching the fight scenes in IMAX was one of the most fun movie experiences I've had in quite a while.   I thought scarlet witch and quicksilver were great additions, and ultron was a very well written snarky sarcastic villain. There were certainly slow parts, but I would never say I felt remotely bored by the movie.   But I mean, that's just like my opinion man."

While I don't think it was a 9 as I originally rated it, I certainly think it's an 8, and a really strong 8 at that. The performances are great (except Domnhall Gleeson, who is just average), it is really well shot, and it does a really good job at implying elements of the plot for the audience to unravel themselves, while a lesser film would spell it out to the audience. It definitely lives up to the hype in my critical opinion, and I would personally recommend it."

Did you get a homework assignment asking you to define plot devices or something?  You define/discuss chekovs gun, MacGuffins and Shaggy Dog but never relate them to the fucking movie.  What is the Chekov gun in this movie?  I don't fucking see anything that could be it.  FOR FUCKS SAKE YOU SAY YOURSELF THAT THE SHAGGY DOG DEVICE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE AT 5:39 SO WHY DID YOU WASTE 30 SECONDS TALKING ABOUT IT?

The solar storm that hinders them can't be a ""deus ex machina"" because ""deus ex machina"" is when something out of the blue resolves the conflict.   HOW THE FUCK DOES THE SOLAR STORM THAT HITS THEM THAT CUTS OUT COMMUNICATIONS SOLVE ANY SORT OF PROBLEM!  So you're main issue is that the movie doesn't go ""LOOK ALIENS""  five minutes in. If anything I stated was wrong please correct me.  Nice job plugging your own bullshit writing halfway through by the way."

YMS,34kct4,TheRingshifter,5,Fri May 1 23:44:09 2015 UTC,"Man, I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed this, I see people praising it left and right and I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.  The movie was seriously bogged down by heavy handed editing (that apparently managed to piss off both the director and the actors), it felt unfinished, almost as if 1/3 of what was supposed to be in there had been edited out or something (a couple of things just literally pop out of nowhere and are never explained and there's quite a few snippets from the trailers that are missing from the movie for some reason) and you could easily tell when a scene was originally supposed to be more fleshed out but had to be rushed and streamlined instead.  Also, I hated the filler stuff they randomly put in there in order to advance the overarching plot (cave scene docet), it really upset the flow of the movie.  Can't wait for the extended version honestly."
YMS,34kct4,Searaingaruda,3,Sat May 2 00:58:12 2015 UTC,"Eh, pretty much agree with everything... except that I absolutely can wait for an extended edition. I think even with the pacing ""fixed"" (if that is even possible), it would still just be a slightly OK film."

I know you said that the previous parts didn't get as many views as you would have liked. A lot of youtubers would have just done something else. It really shows in your videos that you put quality before ""likes.""  And don't stress yourself out too much about all of this. In one of your GTA streams it sounded as if working on these reviews was more stressful than fun for you these days. Take some time off if you need it, man, and ignore the entitled whiners. I'm sure your core fanbase appreciates the work you put into your videos and doesn't want you to get burnt out."
YMS,34dlcz,a4187021,6,Thu Apr 30 17:13:19 2015 UTC,"I know you said that the previous parts didn't get as many views as you would have liked.   I've already mentioned this here before but its because most of Adam's fanbase (yms subreddit and shit aside) is there to see the funny side of Adam and to watch his humorous reviews. People love Cool Cat and Cyberbully and all that because it makes them laugh.   Personally I'm not that into movies(I like them but I'm not anywhere near Adam's level) so while I still watch these analysis reviews, they're just simply not as enjoyable for me. That being said I'm glad he's still doing something he's passionate about. I wish I could support Adam through Patreon but I'm not sure if my small college student amount of money would really make any sort of impact lol."
YMS,34dlcz,chevybow,2,Thu Apr 30 20:02:27 2015 UTC,"I second this. I will also wait as long as I need to for more high quality videos. Adam, some of the things you said in this video I thought were just brilliant, and it brought in great new perspectives. You seem pretty capable of good quality film criticism, and I'm happy you want to do it, too (in addition to YMSs which I also like). You're also the person who got me into movies in the first place.

You know what that means? If someone were to recut it into one video, it'd be a movie. It'd be a documentary about Synecdoche, New York. It'd be a good Room 237. In fact, having a one-video option after everything was released would be a better way of watching it for any newcomers. It'd just be like ""Hey, I fucking love my job this much. Also, there's some comedic stuff lying around here somewhere..."""

YMS,34dlcz,mandrilltiger,1 point,Fri May 1 07:47:05 2015 UTC,Probably leaves it the same and switches around the subtitles.
YMS,34dlcz,bigo0723,3,Sat May 2 09:59:47 2015 UTC,Watching this is reminding me why I didn't enjoy this film and I think it is because of how sad the entire thing is. It seems like on the surface that Caden is trying to do the right thing but things keep going so wrong for him. He just wants to save Olive from a terrible situation but doing so loses his 2nd wife.   That being said that is not to say this is a bad film. It's amazing well made and the detail is insane. In fact the movie on deeper level shows that he didn't really care that much about Claire. And probably part of the theme is that good intentions can hurt people. But the fact that nothing went well for the main character bummed me out.  I like to add that despite having some personal problems with this movie this probably my favorite series of videos that Adam has done.
YMS,34dlcz,ArcherGorgon,3,Thu Apr 30 14:53:41 2015 UTC,"I think that the movie is the point of view of a pessimist coming to terms with life although almost too late. He falls in love yet doesn't act on it, and when he finally decides to finally commit she dies on him. He tries to tell his daughter he loves her but she shortly after. And when he finally recognizes how he wants there play to go, he himself dies.  But it's also optimistic in some ways. Yes, he never has a greater love but he finds the one whom it was possible with. Yes,  his daughter hated him but he still has the memory of them loving each other when they were young. And he finally does figure out the play and his life.   The whole movie is about wasted opportunity's, moments in life we ignore. Adam was right that the wife ignores all the bad things in her life to be happy, while Cotard ignores or puts off all the good things in life for fear or worry over death.  In that way, the movie is saying that we should instead embrace life, taking care not to go into either optimistic or pessimistic delusion. So yes, the movie doesn't have a realistic view of the world but rather a reflection of it that asks us to change our view on our own reality--to recognize that life is hard and wonderful."
YMS,34dlcz,BeefBreeze,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:05:17 2015 UTC,"Not Adam obviously, but I'd like to give me two cents on it.  Synecdoche, New York is something that aimed to be brutally honest. So, if it comes across as pessimstic thats not probably somewhat intentional (especially considering we're following the life of Caden) However it isn't completely bleak in its statement on death, theres Adele and Hazel who don't live life in fear of death and are for the most part happy until towards the end. And even Hazel did have some apprehension about dying in a burning house but she pushed on regardless.   The point is, it doesn't say woe is everyone we're all going to die as much as we're all going to die and how we choose to live with it doesn't matter (as long as you're happy) because its inevitable. Its a theme that is treated with some pessimism but its reasonable pessimism and for the most part does emcompass most attitudes death. Its a film about attitudes on death rather than perspectives about death. Sure, you could have someone who looks forward to death in the movie but their attitude would be much the same as either Hazel, Caden, or Adele."
YMS,34dlcz,geddy,2,Thu Apr 30 19:33:08 2015 UTC,These videos make me feel increasingly dumb from all the details that pass right over my head. Incredible analyzation as always.
YMS,34dlcz,Trionout,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"This is one of the few YMS videos I haven't watched (any of the 'Synecdoche, New York' ones, I mean). I'm not generally into art films, but I'm genuinely curious about this one since Adam would dedicate so much time to making a 3 parter on it.  If anyone has seen the movie and then the reviews, should I watch the movie before I watch the YMS of it? I am intrigued at this point and the plot from Wikipedia sounds pretty interesting, albeit different than something I would normally watch."
YMS,34dlcz,TheRingshifter,3,Fri May 1 01:48:09 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend watching the movie and then the analysis. Also, it's gonna be more than the three parts."

Its like if Speilberg started doing stand-up comedy and was terrible at it. You wouldn't say Speilberg is a ""comedian"", he would be a filmmaker who was doing terrible stand-up comedy.

The newer ones have been worse, sure, but the main difference between a movie like Little Nicky and Billy Madison is that you were older and had a wider frame of reference for movies when you watched Little Nicky. That and the product placement."
YMS,3421ye,LeRawxWiz,9,Mon Apr 27 19:36:40 2015 UTC,"What is this mystical Nostalgia you speak of, oh wise one?  Comedies don't age well in general. His comedy was kinda ""of the time"". Kinda the immature type of sense of humor that was popular at the time with Tom Green, Beavis and Butthead and the early days of South Park. It was sort of new and innovative at the time, now I'm sure he just seemed like a Pewdiepie type of annoyance to younger people, but at the time it was funny because it was unique.  If you go back, critics didn't like it because it wasn't directed towards them. I mean, Roger Ebert isn't going to find Billy Madison taking part in a video game discussion at the school lunch table as funny as people who are younger and have experienced those situations.  No shit, they weren't super intellectual or highly referential like Mystery Science Theater 3000, but that doesn't mean its not funny.  Three Stooges were funny to people back in the day. Comedy evolves. Doesn't mean the comedy is retroactively bad (buzzword incoming) NOSTALGIA."
YMS,3421ye,RDandersen,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:47:45 2015 UTC,"I should have been more specific in my comment instead of just snarky. I apologize for that.    What I meant to express was the notion that for instance Billy Madison as a movie is in any significant way a different kind of movie from for instance Waterboy. He made about 6 movies or so, them being Little Nicky, Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, Mr. Deeds, Billy Madison and Waterboy, which were all the exact same kind of comedy. What I meant to imply with the nostalgia comment is that when someone says any one of those movies are significantly better than the other, 9 times out of ten they are basically just telling us how old they are by saying that the one that happened to come out nearest to their late teens, early twenties is the best one.      No shit, they weren't super intellectual or highly referential like Mystery Science Theater 3000, but that doesn't mean its not funny.     That is not at all what I meant to imply. I think his movies, that is those 6 ones I mentioned above all work as good dumb comedies. I have a favourite and least favourite, but I don't think any of them are bad because they aren't MST. That has nothing to do with what I was trying to say. Operative word here clearly being ""trying."""
YMS,3421ye,LeRawxWiz,3,Mon Apr 27 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"Its alright man, thanks for apologizing.  I agree. He pretty much made the same movie 6 times in a row. Though Little Nicky was definitely a bit of an outlier in terms of mood/thematically due to the bizarreness of it.  I was younger than late teens when all of them came out. I think all of those movies have some sort of value to them except for Big Daddy and Mr Deeds. I don't know if this is what you're hinting at, but I do believe that your sense of humor is formed a lot during your teen years... so something targeted at you when you're a teenager will probably be more funny to you than to an older person.  I think its unfair to compare movies he clearly made with a passion (like his first two movies) to the clear ""getting by on name alone"" cash-ins he started making (Mr. Deeds was the first HUGE offended of that)."
YMS,3421ye,CasaBlacka,3,Mon Apr 27 20:21:31 2015 UTC,"And what about those people who think they're still good but never saw them growing up? I mean, billy Madison sucks but Happy Gilmore is a good dumb comedy.  You can't just assume everyone who likes what you dislike are nostalgia blind."

Little Nicky, Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, Mr. Deeds, Billy Madison, Waterboy. Watched them all at the same age with no context for which is older or not and they are the same kind of movies. The are all ""good dumb comedies"" assuming we mean the same by that. The notion I was disagreeing with is the oft-presented one that Billy Madison is somehow an artist masterpiece of 90s comedy and Mr. Deeds is trash scrapped off the walls of the SNL gloryhole stall. That notion is just pure nostalgia or the most finely tuned taste in existence. You are obviously allowed to like one and not like another  But I should specify that I'm talking about those movies. I'm gladly admit that Jack and Jill and Grown Ups and such are an entirely different category of dumb that left both ""good"" and arguably ""comedy"" far behind."
YMS,3421ye,Bull3tM0nk3y,3,Mon Apr 27 19:52:28 2015 UTC,"Adam Sandler has done some good work. His early movies, along with Punch Drunk Love, 50 First Dates, and I kind of liked that movie with the gumballs."

Jesus christ, Adam doesn't owe you guys anything, ESPECIALLY an explanation to where he's been.  Who the hell is OP to ask where he's been? What have you been up to lately? I demand an explanation. Could OP be more of a prick? ""I go to film school in Japan!!!!"" NOBODY CARES."
YMS,345smx,wheretocaptain,-2,Tue Apr 28 21:57:05 2015 UTC,Fuck that Japanese guy but it is in the interests of all fans that Adam be straightforward. That is all.

Luckily Adam seems really transparent with where his time goes, and due to his honesty in the past, I believe that he's actually really busy with friends and family, as he said."
YMS,345smx,ashklambeg,3,Tue Apr 28 15:26:59 2015 UTC,"Forget this month then. He has only uploaded seven proper videos in four months. I think he isn't being transparent at all as to the effort he's putting in. I develop flash games and making a short desktop film was an assignment I got in college. I might upload the video to YouTube one day but the film was half hour long and was pretty similar to a yms.the entirity of research, editing and voicework took less than a week. I do not see where 270 hours of tireless effort is going."
YMS,345smx,i_ejaculate_fire,7,Tue Apr 28 15:39:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know Mrs. Smoulders, 7 vids in 4 months is pretty dank if you ask me. In comparisment with RLM that got a production company pretty much and are not able to deliver at least 2 vids per month sometimes, I'd say Adam makes decent job. Each Every Frame A Painting takes Tony around month to complete, and each video's runtime is small compared to a YMS video. Maybe he bit more than he could chew with Synecdoche but I think it's worth the wait.   And if you're so incredibly efficient Koby, you should upload both your game and your movie somewhere online, so people will judge if it's good or not, before comparing your power levels with Adum's. Not trying to be a dick, (and I really like Cobie Smulders god she's so pretty) but I don't think your personal accomplishments are fair argument and will result improving adum's efficiency. It took me 2 months to learn premiere and create something similiar to YMS,  and I'm a really lazy person. Does it mean that the content is any good? Not at all. So would you rather see Adam take his time and inspiration and effort to make best vids he can, or see him spit out one video after the other a-la nostalgia critic?"
YMS,345smx,FayeBlooded,-6,Tue Apr 28 17:15:18 2015 UTC,I have to back smoulders up here. I used adobe premire in my first year and it  shouldn't take you a month even if you do film school levels of dissection. (Several of my teachers make hour long essays in an evening). Both RLM and Tony have got day jobs. They don't do this full time. Tony manages one video every 3 weeks even with his editing career. All we're asking as people who genuinely want to support his passion is some honesty as to what the hell happens all month.
YMS,345smx,FayeBlooded,3,Tue Apr 28 18:03:24 2015 UTC,"You support his passion by kicking in a few bucks, whenever he uploads a video. How does that entitle you to know what's going on in his life? When he has a product to sell you, you buy it because you're a fan. If he doesn't have a product to sell you, you pocket your five dollars and turn your attention to the other many things I am sure you have going on, in your life. He's not your goddamned employee."

All we're asking as people who genuinely want to support his passion is some honesty as to what the hell happens all month   you say that, while simultaneously de-grading the dude by comparing his work with your own. Well everybody can use their dicks, but not everyone get paid for using it on camera, if you catch my drift. There are TONS of video content on youtube, and not many of them resonate with people like Adum or RLM. I honestly don't feel starved for either of their content.   But what do you even want him to clarify exactly? He already said everything he could - he works on Synecdoche, it happened to be more challenging than he thought, his friend got married this month and he had to be bestman for him and he wants to play some video games once a week. Like, do you want him to post his daily schedule? Or livestream his editing process?that actually would be really interesting  Look, I understand that if you pay him through patreon you can't help but feel entitled to know when's the next product for which you pay for - no way around that, and a fair criticism is always good. But I feel that you guys don't make things better for pandering adam in this thread, just like all of the people who jerks off to his dank memes all the time. I think that things will only get better for Adam as content creator when he finishes Synecdoche, personally"

Friends is a cultural cornerstone. It's only overrated because it did such an incredible job speaking to its particular generation, and its longevity so far is indicative of that. The Big Bang Theory is today's popular canned sitcom and I doubt it will show the same longevity as Friends.  Friends had pretty great writing for what it was. It had episode gags that paid out (the Ken Adams / Europe story is an example of that), long-term gags that became memes, pretty great physical comedy, and characters that were consistent as well as distinct and generally evolutionary, rather than the one-dimensional pieces of bland fucking garbage that The Big Bang Theory offers. Also, the actors in Friends actually had pretty great comedic delivery, whereas the cast of TBBT often sound like they've never looked at a script in their lives.  It's definitely not for everyone and it's not nearly as funny, complex, and honest as comedies like Arrested Development, Louie, or [classic] Community, but it was a show with a good heart that held a lot of value as a piece of comedic art. It reused situations that had been done before and got stale by the end of its run, but what long-running series doesn't?  I love Friends and it's got a place in my heart because I grew up with it and that's probably why I'm defending it so hard."
YMS,33yr7r,mjknlr,3,Tue Apr 28 00:21:33 2015 UTC,I thoroughly enjoy Friends. Really hard to say it's bad if you were born after it was initially on because it was honestly the first of its kind and it still holds up today.

The jokes have one unfunny formula, 'nerds are weird, lel'. They do have the making fun of diseases and races and religion. The characters are boring and have no development and utterly unlikable when the show tries to make them look like the nicest people on Earth. They are also retarted(not literally).

The characters are extremely poor in The Big Bang Theory, but that's a general trait of sitcoms, usually. The characters aren't well developed because they don't need to be well developed.  The rest of that stuff isn't really reflective of its quality from a film/art standpoint. It's unfunny for a comedy, which hasn't been the territory Adam has gone into.  I'm not going to comment on Friends because I've never watched it due to how fucking creepy Jennifer Anniston is to me."

YMS,33wbts,TLWind,2,Tue Apr 28 13:29:02 2015 UTC,"I saw it today, liked it a lot.  Very creepy in a conceptual way, but not overtly scary.  You feel more of a creeping uneasiness that slowly builds throughout the film, rather than the straight thriller vibe that the trailers gave off.  The pace is a little slow, but captivating.  It has a lot to say about AI and what it means to be alive, and it really makes you think without getting too complex.  I walked out of the theater having a philosophical discussion with my boyfriend, which is the mark of a great Sci Fi movie.  If you are going to see it soon I won't spoil anything, but I would suggest you pay attention to the juxtaposition of nature/technology and order/chaos.    In a way it reminded me of Under the Skin, which I loved.  It isn't anywhere near as minimal or surreal as that though.  Under the Skin really required multiple viewings, Ex Machina was more straightforward."

It was released as Belleville Rendez-vous in the United Kingdom. The film is Chomet's first feature film and was an international co-production among companies in France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Canada.  The film features the voices of Michèle Caucheteux, Jean-Claude Donda, Michel Robin, and Monica Viegas; there is little dialogue, the majority of the film story being told through song and pantomime. It tells the story of Madame Souza, an elderly woman who goes on a quest to rescue her grandson Champion, a Tour de France cyclist, who has been kidnapped by the French mafia for gambling purposes and taken to the city of Belleville (an amalgam of New York, Montreal and Quebec City ). She is accompanied by Champion's loyal but obese hound, Bruno, and joined by the Triplets of Belleville, music hall singers from the 1930s, whom she meets in the city.  The film was highly praised by audiences and critics for its unique style of animation. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards—Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song for ""Belleville Rendez-vous"".

I'm really glad that an AI film was able to keep me guessing as much as Ex Machina did, I'm still going over the details of the film days after watching it. Oscar Isaac was absolutely phenomenal and stole every scene he was in.   This is probably the best sci-fi movie in theaters right now, and anybody who is a fan of low-key sci-fi thrillers should check it out."
YMS,33rviv,Hippeus,4,Sat Apr 25 05:48:35 2015 UTC,"I'll see it as soon as it comes out here in Europe, but from what I've heard (specifically Jim Gisriel's review) it's well acted and well made but it's generic and not as groundbreaking as people say, so I'll be cautiously optimistic"
YMS,33rviv,cukurcuka,2,Sat Apr 25 16:55:36 2015 UTC,"It isn't anything ground breaking or revolutionary, it's just a good movie that feels reminiscent of other sci fi AI films, if you're not expecting super crazy mixing it up, you'll enjoy it enough"

YMS,33rviv,jozaud,2,Mon Apr 27 04:53:40 2015 UTC,"Saw this last night, genuinely creepy moments from the claustrophobia, it felt like watching a week of the Genetic Designer from Blade Runner and Tyrell before the replicants became mainstream, I loved it. Now where's a quickie Adum?"
YMS,33rviv,CheeseWhizzle,2,Sat Apr 25 19:37:04 2015 UTC,I thought it was wonderful thre were a few things that seemed weird or that I didn't het but good overall
YMS,33rviv,Bamres,2,Sun Apr 26 05:30:19 2015 UTC,It was pretty good but I'd hardly give it a 9/10. A 7 or 8 maybe.  It reminded me of the movie THE SKIN I LIVE IN for obvious reasons and frankly I thought that was the better of the two films.  edit: grammar
YMS,33rviv,CountBubs,3,Mon Apr 27 02:25:06 2015 UTC,"This comment contains spoilers:  I saw this a few months ago, and while I enjoyed the film, I definitely felt like it didn't have as much depth as some other films in the genre. Additionally, the ending seemed a little out of sync with the rest of the film - the whole fascinating debate over AI is concluded with a ""nope, they're definitely evil. End of discussion"" which really disappointed me.  On a more pedantic note, I don't really understand how Domhnall Gleeson could be trapped behind a glass door, in a room which was established to contain lots of very heavy dumbells. That didn't exactly ruin the film, but it was an oversight that annoyed me at the time.  Overall, I'd like to see more films like this, partly because I really, really like Sci-Fi, even if they aren't always masterpieces (but then, Sunshine wasn't exactly a masterpiece either)."
YMS,33rviv,mootwo14,3,Sat Apr 25 13:13:53 2015 UTC,"SPOILER, OBVIOUSLY  I really didn't walk away thinking ""nope, they're definitely evil. End of discussion"".  I mean if you think of the AIs as intellectual and emotional beings similar to humans, which I think the film showed them to be, then they would probably be pretty fucked up based on their 'upbringing'.  She was essentially born a prisoner and she seemed aware that Nathan might kill her if she doesn't perform optimally."
YMS,33rviv,DOUBLEBOSSSPRINGSMAP,2,Sun Apr 26 02:07:55 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS, YET AGAIN  I have to agree with you. I mean, think about how horrifying the idea of turning an AI off. It's not like breaking an iPhone, Ava has all of the emotions of a human being, it would be like brutally killing a person. Not to mention, Ava is probably built to monitor her own functionality as most machines are, so she would probably feel every single part of her body dying at once, unlike a human, since we certainly don't feel our organs shutting down…at least I don't think so (surprisingly, haven't died just yet, I feel as if that would've gotten in the way of me typing this). There's an interesting parallel to HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey. When you think about it, HAL isn't completely evil, either. These characters aren't simple machines, and they don't conform to a black and white scale of morality, either. Her actions are certainly not completely evil, they have a purpose. If anything, Oscar Issac's character is much more evil looking back at him."

Some parts look like they're found footage, but other seems like they're more cinematic, and there's interviews, and all of them are at the same quality? Like the kids are super into filmmaking and know how to use different lenses to make cool shots, and there's also a camera crew following them around with a camera that has the same quality?  AND they're interviewing their mom and grandma? Like, making a documentary on their trip to their grandparents?? And if not and it's the ""filmmakers making a film on past events but while having footage on those events"" thing, AFTER SEEING THE GRANDMA PUTTING THE CHILDREN IN THE FUCKING OVEN, they're still interviewing her??  ...I don't get it.

This reminds me of paranormal activity and I think this will be similar, but less serious.

YMS,33jl9h,Stupid_Pink_Dog,53,Thu Apr 23 01:12:19 2015 UTC,"Okay so I have a theory:   Adum is actually one of the main characters in Cool Cat 2. Why do you think no reviews are being posted? Why do you think nothing is being uploaded to youtube? Cause he's busy?  OF COURSE  But why is he busy? Cause Adum is working with Daddy Derrick to produce a Cool Cat film with even bigger epic proportions. Remember how Adum said he wanted to eventually make a movie? This is where he will gain his experience. By learning from the best director: Daddy Derrick.   Think about it why does Daddy Derrick always seem to happy to hear about Adum and his review? Because it brought attention to himself and his movies? Sure but in a bad way. So what's the reason? Cause they've already started collaborating.   But hold on hold on I know what you're thinking. Why would Adum agree to work with Daddy Derrick on the Cool Cat Movie. Answer?   Fur suits. Think about it, after Adum made the review and showed his knowledge about fur suits and dragon dildo's, why wouldn't Daddy Derrick want his expertise? Adum is an expert with fur suits and role-playing whereas Daddy Derrick only has like 2 fucking costumes. Not only will Daddy Derrick now have even more animals than just Cool Cat, but he has also found an actor for the fur suits that Adum will recommend to Daddy Derrick. Multiple fur suits, multiple actors, multiple levels of awesome.   But wait, multiple actors, what's the purpose of that?   OH SHIT I'M LYING  There's only one actor folks. But its going to be ADUM not the original cool cat. Have you seen cool cat's imdb page, he's getting involved in all kinds of shit he doesn't have time for Daddy anymore. That only leaves one option.   Adum is cool cat #2."

YMS,33hxhk,Dr_StrangeLovePHD,26,Thu Apr 23 14:46:43 2015 UTC,"I'm excited, I really am. I do think M Night still has a chance to come back, you can't direct 3 solid movies and be called a bad director (I would say 4 but The Village is the most debatable). This is his first small movie since Signs (by small I mean focusing on a small group of people/family) and it seem that's what he works best with. I've heard the trailer is creepy when it needs to be and funny when it needs to be, so I'm really looking forward to it."
YMS,33hxhk,Stupid_Pink_Dog,19,Wed Apr 22 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"He may well be a good director, I don't think we'll ever truly know until he stops directing his own screenplays. The guy's ego got way too inflated with his first string of hits to the point where he wrote and directed himself as a writer whose works would change the world in Lady in the Water. He's too in love with his own writing that as a director he's too blind to see what works, what doesn't, and what should be cut entirely."
YMS,33hxhk,SpadesFairy,8,Wed Apr 22 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"I agree, I heard he stopped taking notes from studios after Signs which may have been another problem. I'm just hoping he's learnt from his mistakes this time."
YMS,33hxhk,thepostaldud3,5,Wed Apr 22 19:07:24 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way, I follow M. nights work hoping for another Unbreakable or Sixth Sense. This definitely feels like he's going back to his roots, feels thematically similar (from what info I can scrounge up...) to Sixth Sense.  Buuuut if it sucks and I won't be shocked if it does, it'll at least make a good YMS/half in the bag."
YMS,33hxhk,AHackFraud,4,Wed Apr 22 20:00:41 2015 UTC,"It will very, very, very probably suck. He lost the touch. He made 2 great movies. 15. fucking. years. ago.  I understand that the influence of a Hollywood studio can ruin a movie (just look at The Vanishing/The Vanishing remake, for example), but the problem isn't there. It's the fact that he got cocky, he let himself go. By thinking ""hey, I'm great, so I don't need to work as much"", he became lazy and got caught in his habits. The things that were great in the 6th sense (for example, the long takes) were sloppily re-used in other movies, in completely out-of-context moments (for example, the blue spirit scene in the last airbender) and contributing to the shittyness of it. He forgot what makes a movie great without realizing it. Pride and fame can kill art, and that's what happened here.  I will still see the movie on opening night, just for the lolz. Because something M. Night has gotten good at over the years, it's making so-bad-it's-good moments."
YMS,33hxhk,thepostaldud3,11,Wed Apr 22 23:18:39 2015 UTC,"Just saw the trailer when i went to see Unfriended. Holy fuck there was one scene that just made me laugh so damn hard. The grandmother asks for the kid to get inside the stove to clean it. And she just somehow gets the entire kid in the stove with no effort and slams it shut with no reaction from the other child in the room. Your sister just had her entire body put into a stove and you sit there doing absolutely nothing. My friend next to me audibly said ""Oh fucking christ"" When ""The director of (his films here)"" came up.  It was great."
YMS,33hxhk,Dr_StrangeLovePHD,2,Wed Apr 22 22:52:14 2015 UTC,Hey out of curiosity does the trailer seem to spoil much of the plot? I'm wondering should I see it

YMS,33nqsn,argosucks,5,Fri Apr 24 00:46:49 2015 UTC,Argo isn't a bad movie.  Argo is pretty good. Maybe not Best Picture material but seriously? It's not something that deserves a full on YMS review.
YMS,33nqsn,mardfet,2,Fri Apr 24 01:23:26 2015 UTC,"This guy is trolling, but I feel like there's a real discussion to be had about best picture winners. It seems like whenever a movie wins Best Picture, it's guaranteed some backlash, and I don't know if that's cool. Argo was a pretty good film in my eyes, but once it won best picture people came out of the woodwork saying how bad or undeserving the film was. The Oscars is kind of a joke of a ceremony, but screaming about how the best picture was undeserving every single year is a bit tired now. Same thing with 12 Years a Slave, and how people dismissed it as just another white guilt trip."

YMS,336qky,mandrilltiger,3,Mon Apr 20 01:41:12 2015 UTC,"While I won't say the game is perfect with everything. It is nowhere near the laughably bad level, even close. The only real flaw I find with the game is the poor lip-sync which is really easy to get over.      There are a few lines that really push the whole, ""I'm a teenager. I say things like 'Lol I'm such a geek for likeing photography XD' and 'things the kids say these days'"" and it can be bad for a line or two but that's really it. As someone who is the age of Max, I will say that it can be cheesy and cringy during these lines, but people like this really exist. I know a bunch of people who push the whole ""I'm such a nerd"" thing way too far so I wouldn't really discredit the game for having a character that does it. Max isn't the most popular person (or even very well liked) so it makes sense for her to be awkward and for her to force the whole geek thing. She spends so much of her time online that she probably thinks like acting like people on the internet (or referencing dank memes) will help her become more relatable with real people. It’s an awkward character not bad writing.       The way you can tell the difference between bad writing and a character who says stupid things is that Max, and sometimes Warren, are the only ones that really have these lines.  All the other characters, adult and teenagers, speak very naturally and carry a distinct tone that helps distinguish them as a character. Other than the two super geeky characters, I never was taken out of immersion for something someone said. It doesn’t do anything worth tons of praise but does not even come close to the ridiculing level.        Overall I really like this game and I can’t wait for the next episode. It feels really fresh and offers a story that I can really relate to as a player. It has a wonderfully detailed world and does a great job exploring what can be done with an interactive narrative. /u/mandrilltiger, you might have caught yourself in the mindset of looking for the bad things and now it’s harder to see the good things.  The worst offences of cringy statements happen right at the beginning so I can see how that might skew the rest of the game.  Also remember we are on episode 2 out of 5, we are not even half way through the story yet so I wouldn’t go crazy with options about the whole game yet. The next 3 chapters could suck and prove all this shit I just wrote wrong, idk it could happen. I hope it doesn’t but hey you never know.     TLDR: Stop disliking things I like"
YMS,336qky,NickNAKNick,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:08:18 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying that in reflection the game is not as bad as I remembered it. It has some really cool ideas. And don't let me hating it stop you from enjoying it.   That being said I do consider the worst game I've ever played but I could be forgetting a game and I not counting the stupid flash games that don't really count.   There are a few lines that really push the whole, ""I'm a teenager. I say things like 'Lol I'm such a geek for liking photography XD""   I really don't have a huge problem with Max as a character.   The way you can tell the difference between bad writing and a character who says stupid things is that Max, and sometimes Warren, are the only ones that really have these lines.   Chloe and Victoria have a lot of them as well. While I do not like those lines and I don't think any teenager says (I'm 19) this stuff my big problem comes from other things.   you might have caught yourself in the mindset of looking for the bad things and now it’s harder to see the good things.   I see what you are saying but I came into this wanting and expecting to like it. I don't think it was an overhyped thing.   Here is where the game lost me. The first time travel puzzle is because Vicotria won't let you pass to your dorm and as far as I can tell it's for NO REASON. She is a jerk just for the purpose of the plot. In addition if I was Max I would have just walked right past them. That is sort of an aggressive solution to a problem but it's about just as aggressive of dropping paint on her.  This happens a lot throughout the game.    Also remember we are on episode 2 out of 5,   I'm talking about the first 2 episodes on their own, the next 3 might be better."
YMS,336qky,NickNAKNick,2,Tue Apr 21 03:20:15 2015 UTC,"See that sequence with Victoria is awesome! It is one of the first interactions with her and really drives home that she is a snooty-stuck-up-rich-bitch. She has this overpronounced ego that helps make sure that the player has no real sympathy for her. This whole sequence is designed to make you hate her. If some people think that she is ok, then they won’t like being forced to have to cover her and her expensive clothes in paint. The reason she blocks you off is based on what happens in photography class. Victoria is assumed to be pampered and praised her whole life from a wealthy family. She loves attention and being the center of the universe. So when you distract the class she doesn’t like when you gather everyone’s attention. But you get the question wrong allowing her to steal the spot light and immediately jumps in to answer correctly and throw an insult in your face. But, you stop that from happening by going back and steal her answer. So you distract the whole class with your selfie, then when you get picked on you can answer the question to great detail. All that attention goes right past Victoria and straight to Max. Victoria gets jealous from all the praise Max gets and she hates not having things go her way. So if you take something from her, she will take something from you. She then sits outside of your dorm just to piss you off and send a message that she is the best and that nobody else is allowed to get attention. What a bitch!     You said that if you were Max then you would have just walked by her. Two big issues with that:    You are not Max. You control Max and get to make some choices for her, but you do not have complete control over who she is. She is extremely shy and is not one to stand up for herself. She likes being passive and just procrastinating her issues for a later time. A game like this forces the player to think with the character rather than for them.    This area is critical for the player to learn how to fully utilize the rewind mechanic. Most intelligently designed games often give the player an area to play with a new mechanic without any pressure from the world instead of a tutorial sequence. All Max is trying to do is get into her dorm (no time restraint or danger), so the game allows the player to go at their own pace to get comfortable and discover for themselves how the puzzles will work in the game. All of this helps reduce the amount of tutorial sections and teaches the player effectively while developing character, location, and story.  If the player successfully makes it through this sequence that is like a certification from Dontnod that you understand the controls and that they believe that you are able to complete the game without more instruction. Think about it. If you made it to the train sequence without a good understanding of the controls and how time interacts with the environment, it would turn extremely frustrating and ultimately cause players to drop the game.        Also it’s actually pretty neat to analyze how NukemDukem plays through that segment. Look at how he reacts just like the game wants him to and how its use of movement guides the player. Like how the sprinklers come on during the discussion and there is an optional dialog line that tells the player that you can get Victoria wet.  So you know that the solution is to spray her with water. So you continue walking and Sam is walking past you conveniently. Then you make it to the pump room and crank the water pressure up and get Victoria off the steps. But then you realize that that wasn’t the solution, there is more and your stuck. They show a cut of the paint bucket being hung to symbolize some importance. And they leave you up to the rewind ability to figure the rest out.       My favorite thing about this sequence is that you get to choose if you want to mock or comfort Victoria after you cover her with paint. Up to this point everything she has done makes her look like a complete villain. But she loses all of her confidence and becomes weak after getting covered in paint. Then you get to make a choice based on how you feel. Victoria has no idea you are responsible for the paint and either the player feels sneaky and satisfied or guilty. This allows players to ether get to call out Victoria for all her bitchyness, or comfort her and get a look at what she is like without social pressure.       TLDR: I need to ease off of the lengthy and detailed videogame analysis on a not that popular post on a not that popular subreddit"
YMS,336qky,NickNAKNick,2,Tue Apr 21 04:57:50 2015 UTC,"TLDR: I need to ease off of the lengthy and detailed videogame analysis on a not that popular post on a not that popular subreddit   Let me just start by saying I appreciate the response and while I do disagree it makes it easier to figure out exactly what my problems are.    See that sequence with Victoria is awesome! It is one of the first interactions with her and really drives home that she is a snooty-stuck-up-rich-bitch.   ""Make the audience hate the villain. In whatever way you can. No matter how cheap"" - Plinkett. To me this didn't really make me hate Victoria. It made me annoyed that the game tried to manipulate me in the most lazy way.    So you distract the whole class with your selfie, then when you get picked on you can answer the question to great detail. All that attention goes right past Victoria and straight to Max. Victoria gets jealous from all the praise Max gets and she hates not having things go her way.   I feel like the writers needed Max to get that question right and needed Victoria to get mad at her and they shoehorned them together. I have been to high school but I've never had anyone be upset that someone answered the teachers question. And I'm not only that it (to me) seems like a impossible way for a person to act. In addition the not moving thing is such a passive aggressive way to be mean to Max.   It isn't even really sadistic, she not doing this and enjoying the fact that she is hurting Max, she barely noticed her after the cutscene and then just ignores Max until she walks up. Also she was a jerk in the first scene, when you get the question wrong. She said you are ""totally stuck in the retro zone."" (Actually I'm not sure what means)   You said that if you were Max then you would have just walked by her. Two big issues with that... She is extremely shy and is not one to stand up for herself. She likes being passive and just procrastinating her issues for a later time.   This is not true though because you can choose whether or not to stand up to David after you leave. To me I think the game was making a problem without a threat. ""You can't walk past or we'll... "" or you'll what? I not sure what Max was afraid of exactly. She already made fun of her so what else could really happen.   so the game allows the player to go at their own pace to get comfortable and discover for themselves how the puzzles will work in the game.   The puzzle is fine I guess, but I think the game really just forces you to use the paint bucket because there is no reason to think of using that if the game had not called it out with the camera. In addition Max ""tampers"" with it which makes the handle break but not until it above the girls head. What did Max do to the handle so that it wouldn't break until it was over her head. The answer is there is nothing that she could have done that make that much sense. The game forces you to try this just because the camera called it out.  I'll end this by saying while I had a lot of problems with scene it is not by itself why I hated this game. If this had been the only bad scene I think I would have still like the game.  Thanks for the response though and I respect the fact that you do like the game."
YMS,336qky,chevybow,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:42:33 2015 UTC,"To each their own I. You make great points and I don't call you opinions wrong its just that I see the game differently. Narrative games are extremely tricky to develop because you essentially have to get any knuckle-head with a Xbox to follow along with a intricate story line as a 3rd person viewer. I guess the difference between you and me is that I see what the games doing to the player and can immerse myself or look at it's design, while you see what the game is trying to do and find it manipulative and restricting as a player. I think dontnod designed more for someone with different mindset then you and that's why there is such a frequent friction between you and the game.  Games have limits. Wow I really should really focus all this writing and argument on my AP exams. But hey, vijagams are fun!"

Night, because of the low budget of the film, managed to have full creative control of this movie, which he hasn't in a long time since Signs.   I don't know, I'll be nonjudgmental until the film actually comes out. Besides, M.

The movie itself is about these two kids who go to visit their grandparents for what seemed like an extended period, but their grandparents turn out to be fucking insane. They walk out of their room past curfew and find the grandmother clawing at a door like a cat, then they see her laughing at a painting of like a cup, stuff like that.   The best part is a scene where the grandmother is holding a cooking tray, and she asks her granddaughter if she would ""climb into the oven to clean it."" Then, as if it couldn't be any more distinctly M. Night, there's a shot of the girl's legs flailing as the grandmother tries to push her in all the way and close the oven door. I'm pretty excited."

YMS,32z0vv,kpence,8,Sat Apr 18 05:42:58 2015 UTC,"Spoilers bruh!  I wouldn't say Synecdoche is about death; it's certainly about a man who's plagued with the fear of death, but it strikes me more as a cautionary tale about life. The thing to take away from Synecdoche is that while Caden's experience with despair is unfulfilling and tragic, it doesn't have to be yours; the film is trying to reject solipsism and tell the audience to live more for others rather than living like others are just objects used for self-analysis. So many people are focused on analyzing their own psyches and become so obsessed that they forget to help others and live altruistically. ""I've watched you forever Caden but you've never really looked at anyone other than yourself.""  Millicent says, ""You have struggled into existence and now you are slipping silently out of it. This is everyone's experience; every single one. The specifics hardly matter. Everyone is everyone."" The end result of life is universal. In a similar vein, Erikson's last crisis is ego-integrity vs. despair; trying to find some definitive truth or winning the approval of some particular person aren't methods to finding peace when faced with death. Living for others and with others without being so focused on creating some sort of immortality for yourself can be extremely fulfilling.  There's definitely anxiety associated with Synecdoche; it shines a light on our own egos and fears of unfulfilled lives. It's normal to feel anxious as a result of the film but know that while Kaufman seeks to deliver harsh truth, it doesn't have to define the way you live. At least that's how I reconciled with the dull, empty feeling the film left me with for weeks after I watched it for the first time."
YMS,32z0vv,mjknlr,3,Fri Apr 17 22:58:52 2015 UTC,I died a little inside when I watched it.  I died a lot inside.  I'm so dead inside that it hurts to breathe even months later.

YMS,32z0vv,danthemango,2,Sat Apr 18 03:56:30 2015 UTC,I know exactly what you're talking about and I felt exactly the same way when I saw that list item. I actually scanned that list looking for the Road which is a much more overtly depressing film.
YMS,32z0vv,danthemango,2,Sat Apr 18 04:41:48 2015 UTC,"I actually watched it the year it came out and I loved it. It's the only movie that has successfully made me cry, right at the end when he says   ""I know how to do this play now, I have an idea. I think. If every..."" ""die.""   My instinct was that it was incredibly unfair that he spent all of that time to create something great, and then when the idea finally comes together he is no longer given a chance. But then again, when is it fair to die? How do you choose to die?"
YMS,32z0vv,mjknlr,3,Sat Apr 18 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"The play that he's working on isn't actually a great piece of art; it's just a parallel for his philosophical journey and his analysis of his own psyche.  Every time he says ""I know how to do this play now"" throughout the film, it's a revelation that's soon followed by the disappointment that his new way to do the play is ultimately unfulfilling. That's because each time he ""knows how to do the play,"" it's a metaphor for a new philosophy, as the play represents life. He thinks he's figured it out, he thinks he now knows truth; now he's a god with all the right answers. But the ultimate truth is that there's never an ultimate truth, and he's not a god of this world or any.  The thing about the last line is that it suggests that he's found yet another philosophy, and it's immediately followed by his death. Perhaps it was the ""right"" philosophy, perhaps it was another unsatisfying one."

YMS,3304db,Zero_II,6,Sat Apr 18 05:08:51 2015 UTC,"If someone asks an ""overrated"" anime, my go-to answer is Death Note  I usually enjoy all kinds of animes for what they're, but Death Note has nasty problems, specially in that second half. The second half is actually unbearable   Maybe it's because unlike most art productions I consume, I heard a lot of good things about it, so I went watch it with high expectations, an obvious mistake"
YMS,3304db,teerre,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:49:08 2015 UTC,"What makes the second half unbearable? Its not my favorite anime but its definitely in my top 5. I know I heard a lot of complaints about the ending in particular but I tend to disagree. I think the main reason people dislike it is because a lot of people love it. I'll agree that its overrated, but its still a really fantastic anime and I would probably give it a 7/10 (on Adam's scale)."
YMS,3304db,chevybow,2,Mon Apr 20 00:55:31 2015 UTC,"I can't say specifics because I watched it a long time ago and, as you might imagine, I didn't rewatch it  But, in general terms, Ls death is terrible in terms of story, he's the most ""famous"" character, if you think Death Note, you think L. I understand it should be a turn-point and a big reveal, but, as I remember, it wasn't, it was sudden and underwhelming. Instead of being ""wow"" after I watched it, I was like ""Are you serious?""  That makes the story go into a very awkward way. Instead of building since it's approaching the end, no, it stars over. New characters, new problems, new relations. It's even worse because Near is basically L 2.0.  Finally, I never liked Light, I think his character is flawed. He's apparently a super genius who thinks he's justice incarnated because...? He's not like, for example, Lelouch, who wanted to save his sister and later descended into madness. He simply thinks the world sucks and he'll fixed it, that's 5th grade thoughts right there. In the end, the said genius is caught in the most ridiculous way and that's it.  I feel like they needed to end the series in some way but couldn't think how and then the schedule caught up and they just went with it. The whole series is about finding Kira, that's one thing couldn't be underwhelming, that's THE thing, but maybe because of the ""real world setting"" and the nature of the Death Note, I think they didn't find a suitable way of doing it."
YMS,3304db,teerre,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:28:01 2015 UTC,"I liked L's character but I agree that the reveal is underwhelming- perhaps they could've fixed that.   However I don't think the ending was bad and I don't think it was as result of ending the series quickly because the schedule caught up. I thought they were setting up for Light's downward spiral. The first half of the anime is Light gaining confidence and arrogance is the sense that ""no one can beat me"", especially when he successfully defeated L.   But the second half served as a downward decline. Light got so caught up in being considered this ""god of the new world"" that he got careless and made mistakes. The carelessness caught up to Light and is what caused the ending of the anime that people seem to hate, but I rather liked. He got careless and while L was the main threat, he got defeated by N due to it.   Of course everyone has their different opinions and anyone is welcome to dislike it. I just think there's different ways of interpreting the series and many probably felt underwhelmed due to the hype. I still think its enjoyable for many, especially if you're like me and didn't know about what other people thought about it beforehand."
YMS,3304db,chevybow,2,Mon Apr 20 01:42:16 2015 UTC,"I really like Death Note. It does feel goofy and overblown at certian points but imo that's just another part of the appeal and the scenes that do work well REALLY work well. Overall though I would recommend the manga over the anime even though it gets pretty wordy at times, but the pacing is mych better than the anime, the ending is better, we learn more about the chatacters and world in general, the production values remain more consistent, and the somewhat convoluted plotting and planning is made easier to follow. Also, fair warning a lot of people say it started sucking after after a certian twis halfway through that I won't reveal here because spoilers and while I feel it did become a lot weaker I still thoroughly enjoyed it (that part was handled better in the manga too btw).  TL;DR: It's good but I prefer the manga."

YMS,3304db,friendlybear01,1 point,Sat Apr 18 09:18:09 2015 UTC,"Overrated is the first word that comes to mind, you're probably better off reading the manga, as the drawings are pretty good, but the animation, being a long run anime, is not all that good overall, even for 2006~7 standards.

YMS,32vnpp,willwithskills,15,Fri Apr 17 20:26:10 2015 UTC,"I saw it tonight also, it was hilarious.  Very little of the movie made any sense.  Like the ghost was CLEARLY omniscient, why did any of the characters even try lying?  The main character looked at that forum thread like 10 times where it said the only way to survive is to confess, but at the very end of the movie she was still saying ""WHAT DO YOU THINK I DID???????  I'M A GOOD PERSON!""  The scene where she goes on Chatroulette to get someone to call for help was particularly cringe-worthy.  Also whenever characters just inexplicably had weapons sitting on their desk, especially in the very beginning when Mitch just pulls out a huge kitchen knife while he is having cyber-sex with Blaire.  My biggest complaint is there is WAY too much artifacting and pixelation from the compression on the skype video, I walked out of the theater with a throbbing headache as a result.  It was literally painful to watch.  Glad I saw it though, was laughing quite a bit at how bad it is.  I will say that it was interesting to see a movie in this style, where the whole story is told through capturing a computer desktop.  A very interesting idea.  It wasn't GOOD, but it was interesting..."
YMS,32vnpp,thefrontpageofreddit,5,Fri Apr 17 04:40:23 2015 UTC,"A movie came out recently called ""Open Windows"". It starred Elijah Wood and the entire shooting style of the movie was that you were looking at a computer screen, but the camera would shift up and down to show where Elijah's character was looking at times. It's an interesting premise but it became pretty boring after about 10 minutes because nothing was really happening. I'm really hoping the ""film a computer screen"" style does not catch on big."

YMS,32vnpp,jozaud,3,Sat Apr 18 05:03:05 2015 UTC,I feel like you're exaggerating. Chris Stuckmann gave it a good review and I trust his opinion. I'll see for myself

The small details did add some realism and there were some nice touches (like Blaire writing and then deleting messages that he mentioned).  OP might be exaggerating when he says that there was nothing good about the film, but it was REALLY dumb and there were FAR more things about the movie that made it seem stupid than there were little things that made it ""realistic"".  It made very little sense, and quite a few scenes were really cringe-worthy, which I mentioned in my comment above.

However, I trusted Adam's word and watched it again and this time I picked up on small details that helped me to relate to our main character.  This time I was more intrigued and in preparation of my third viewing I looked up an analysis before hand.  By that time I really appreciated the movie a lot more and for what it told without treating me like a dummy.  I think I've seen the movie of a totally of seven times and by now I feel comfortable calling it one of my favorites.  I kind of wish the blu ray wasn't so expensive because I don't want to drop 80 dolla on it.  It's a movie that excites my brain to make inferences on the massive amount of commentary it has to offer and to my surprise has a meaningful message.

YMS,32pc7d,hstabley,2,Wed Apr 15 17:03:30 2015 UTC,"Find a way to integrate the cliche into the story naturally. For example; Funny Games US has a person intentionally knock their victim's phone into the water, but does it in such a subtle way that the audience won't even realize the significance of the event until the character needs her now defunct phone later. Rather than just ""being out of battery"" or whatever, they effectively make the cliche a part of the story in an interesting way.  Beyond that, building tension doesn't always have to lead to a jump scare, a great example of this is Antichrist, which effectively leaves the audience on the edge of their seat the entire film, yet never once has anything even remotely jump-scare related.  Just having a good writing and director can effectively avoid many cliches involving death. Cliches only exist because people keep using them, and there is ALWAYS a way around them."

And people who watch it go for exactly that reason. The movies are basically the way we used to play with cars as kids but in movie form, they're kinda what Michael Bay wants to be, but in a better way. I haven't watched Furious 7 yet, so I don't know why the reviews are good, but for what I've read, I believe it's because it's good entry in the series and works well for the genre.  I know saying something like ""it's just a dumb movie, don't take it so seriously"" it's a dumb way to defend movies and it's what people say to defend some really crappy movies, but it's something that actually really fits in this case.  With that said, I'm not that big of a fan of the series and I know they're not that good. They're filled with mistakes and plot holes, but I do enjoy watch them once. They can be crappy, but sure as hell the people behind it knows how to make them entertaining and that's something most crappy movies can't do."

If you've been following the series at all, you would know that Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6 received similar acclaim and have acquired a real cult status from lovers of dumb-cheesy-oneliner style action flicks.  However if you're interested in hearing more about what makes the films so great, there's a number of interesting podcasts I've listened to that explain the feeling many get from watching them. Here's one in which two studied film critics try to break it down, here's another that gives you the everyday-man sort of perspective (note: the second one is just for Fast Five). There are obviously plenty more on the film series, but I find these two to provide the best perspective on the subject."

For example this image: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWnK1luCWyQ I think is very well done, with the soundtrack working well with the shots.   Also, I think I know which scene is Adam's favorite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
YMS,32biba,LlamaOfRegret,-4,Sun Apr 12 10:11:48 2015 UTC,"Well first off, the acting was really bad except for Jack Nicholson. Everyone was just reading their lines with no acting even involved, especially the wife and the kid. It also had some stupid moments like when the kid started screeming and ran away from his hiding spot, and the wife could just stabbed jack in the face when he said 'here's johhny!' It also was really slow and all the foreshadowing spoiled everything that was going to happen. And yeah the blood elevator was pretty cool, but for me 2 little girls are not scary at all."
YMS,32biba,LlamaOfRegret,4,Sun Apr 12 12:09:40 2015 UTC,"I think the acting is often theatrical and for lack of a better term, ""constructed"", which I think adds to the strangeness and claustrophobia. It's kind of like a parody of human behavior, especially when the husband is chasing the wife. Everything is a little ""off"", including the victims. The soundtrack really highlights that. I don't really identify with the characters. Rather, I feel like I'm trapped in the hotel with them. Just my perspective though.   As for the movie being slow, the fear is supposed to come from the dread of being trapped, rather than straight up murders all the way through. It's all in the armosphere (again, the soundtrack makes it). I think the foreshadowing is supposed to make you feel helpless. You know shit's gonna co down, and you can't do anything about it.  Sucks that you're being downvoted, just for stating your opinion, though. I hate how, when you're discussing ""classics"", anyone who dislikes something is automatically wrong. Nothing wrong with disliking The Shining.  Edit: Additionally, a lot of it is in the context you watch it. I first watched it at a Halloween party with a bunch of friends, and we found it hilarious. When I rewatched it alone, it was way more disturbing. I think a lot of what forms our opinion of movies is what we expect from them, and what mood we are in."

Another movie with great claustrophobia themes is 'The Descent' And yes we started laughing a couple of times at the wifes terrible line delivery, and when she was running around with the knife"
YMS,32biba,ataturkman,-1,Sun Apr 12 12:31:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe it was just the style and feel that kubrick wanted, but i thought it felt unnatural. I think this is the type of film that is 'sacred' and no one is allowed to talk bad about it. It has such a hight ranking and considered of the the best horror movies ever and it's on all the top 10 lists. Just imagine if it came out today, it would have been a catastrophe, and i think you have to judge all the movies like that or else it shouldn't be considered one of the all time best."

YMS,323zq2,Colink101,2,Fri Apr 10 21:13:25 2015 UTC,I thought it was good but there is one point in the film that really bugged me. When Kappa or whatever he's called finds out there's an unknown on the ship then just goes and confronts him on his own. Bugs the shit out of me.

It was also my first time seeing Chris Evans in a role that I liked. Most people dislike the end and I think they have a good reason to but it doesn't bother me, I actually liked it. I found the overall experience incredibly gripping and emotional and I thought the overall premise to be incredibly intriguing and well handled. It's one of the few movies I watched back to back after finishing it the first time. It just had so many nice introspective and  beautiful moments and an amazing score. I need to watch it again, unfortunately I can't go into too many specifics because it's not fresh in my mind. But overall, I love it."

YMS,323zq2,GingerCritic,1 point,Fri Apr 10 23:48:13 2015 UTC,I thought the movie crapped the bed on the third act but the first two were so strong that they have stayed with me. It was just cool seeing this worldwide coalition of space professionals doing space stuff in a relatively realistic way and then having to deal with the various mysteries along the way. Really hated how Boyle/Garland called back to their last horror movie in such an implausible way.
YMS,323zq2,zerototeacher,1 point,Sun Apr 12 07:02:40 2015 UTC,"Saw it two days ago or something. I liked the first two acts. Beautifully shot, amazing soundtrack, believable characters, etc. The third act was just plain weird, although I understand the symbolism. I think it shat the bed because it didn't have enough context for the whole science vs fundamentalism theme and it just felt out of place. I understood what he was trying to do, but it felt too forced."

YMS,31x177,tjb755,2,Fri Apr 10 03:01:58 2015 UTC,It is a Mexican film if i am not wrong and it is really unique. It is dramatic but also satiric towards the Mexican art films. It is black amd white and has a different frame rate as well. I thought it was very good. I'd advice you to see it if you are interested in different dramas.

Interesting tidbit, Aronofsky owns the rights to perfect blue in the states, he also got special permission to recreate the bathtub scene from perfect blue in his film requiem for a dream, he even met Kon at one point before his death, so it's no coincidence Black Swan felt to me like a shitty western ripoff. i usually like Aronofsky's films, but yeh, not this one"

He seems like a very smart and genuine guy with a passion for film; much like Adam.

I definitely got that sense in a lot of games they were playing with their normal personas. If it were an AVGN review they'd be ranting on about how frustrating and fake difficulty X or Y is, when in actuality they're just bad.

I know it's generally kind of shallow to attribute an artist's genius to their drug use, but the fact that so many musicians have attributed much of their success to their experimentations with drugs and then to be faced with such a monumental, non-conformist genius who completely rejected drugs is unheard of to me."

The thing is, even before that there is a 10-15 minute dinner conversation with boring dialogue. Even the love scene is terrible in my opinion, as it has some extremely cheesy dialogue (""There are two of you, can't you see? One that kills, and one that loves."")

YMS,31nnuc,Di_Bello,4,Mon Apr 6 18:46:06 2015 UTC,"To me, this show is a rollercoaster. There were points in the show where i got bored of watching. I would have stopped watching the show if it wasn't for the last six episodes of season five. There are still plenty of issues with the show, but I'll keep watching as long as it's entertaining.    As long as the plot and the character developement stay fresh, it will get better."

YMS,31nnuc,WavvyBoi,5,Tue Apr 7 18:17:58 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested too. Season 5 was a big improvement imo, and part of that reason was clearly due to better writing with glen mazzara gone."

It really brought to life the individual senses, not just smell.  The audio and was captivating - from the get go with the sound of birth, to the detailed sound of a small bottle openings.  There were plenty of scenes that i feel like I could...feel - activating mental responses that placed me in those scenes.  The visuals were great!  The scenes/sets I thought were super well done.  Probably not a movie for everybody, but something of which my friends and I enjoyed"
YMS,31mzw2,Chronictacos,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:47:49 2015 UTC,I think they did the best job they could turning the book by Patrick Süßkind into a film but it never archived the same emotional reaction in me as the book did.   Also the olfactory theme is hard to introduce in a film. Read the novel and you will see what I mean.

YMS,31kpp8,anUnkindness,7,Mon Apr 6 05:01:55 2015 UTC,"On another note, movies that I CAN recommend on shrooms are:   Don't Think: Concert documentary of the band, Chemical Brothers. Fantastic music and an all around sensual rollercoaster.  Unleashed: Kick-ass, fight movie starring Jet Li and Morgan Freeman. That alone should say enough.   Gone Girl: Although that was on acid but still...my god was it hilarious. The surprise Tyler Perry appearance sent me over the edge of space and time.    Coraline: It was good. My hands ended up being a lot more interesting at the time but I would still definitely recommend the movie.  Lord of The Rings: Hoooooly shit. What an experience. Everything about the movie was great. And the work that was put into the sound production will have you questioning wether your schizophrenic throughout the entire movie. And I mean that in the best of ways. The sensation of Sauron whispering his evil in the back of your mind (just as poor Frodo had to endure) made it the best cinematic experience of my life.   Dont watch Riding The Bus With My Sister though. That wasn't fun."

I reviewed Wikipedia's policy on blogs, turns out they're ok if they meet certain criteria. I don't think (most of) the paragraphs that were there before were strictly defamatory (if anything they might be libelous), but they're well cited with links to primary sources. I'll just put back the bits I've checked.  Also, well done to whoever edited the article with obvious vandalism while I was reviewing it.    At the last second I felt that the emails paragraph was worded too strongly and removed it. I ended up only adding his comments on union salaries.

Awards and accolades of article  The Hurt Locker:       Starting with its initial screening at the 2008 Venice International Film Festival, The Hurt Locker has earned many awards and honors. It also ranked on more film critics' top 10 lists than any other film of 2009. It was nominated in nine categories at the 82nd Academy Awards and won in six: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Film Editing. It lost the award for Best Actor to Crazy Heart, Best Original Score to Up, and Best Cinematography to Avatar.  Bigelow became the first woman to win an Oscar for Best Director,  and The Hurt Locker is to date, the lowest-grossing film to win Best Picture.   Kathryn Bigelow was awarded the 2009 Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Achievement in Feature Film for the film, the first time a female director has ever won.  The film won six awards at the BAFTAs held on February 21, 2010, including Best Film and Best Director for Bigelow. The Hurt Locker was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards.

Amidst that, I was of course repeatedly subjected to the well-known elevator music track, and immediately started wracking my brain trying to recall where I'd heard it used before, in some sort of... comedic context. At first I thought it rang pretty close to the Portal radio loop, but I knew that couldn't be the case. It wasn't until just recently that I realized it was in your fucking videos. Thanks to your reviews, I'd heard the track so often, and yet so subconsciously, that when it came to the game I couldn't for the life of me place the source... though I'd always liked it for some reason.

After a couple of episodes, the humor sorts to become a bit saturated in my opinion. Key example being the billion dollar movie: started off funny, but by the final 20-30 minutes i was just sort of ready to finish the movie. It's also a type of humor that more or less I find humorous rather than actually laugh at, so it does drag on me a bit.

Also, the reason it's one of your favorite comedy shows ever is because although it seems incredibly stupid, the Awesome Show is actually one of the smartest and quietly influential comedies of this century.

YMS,31cvor,Pfender99,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:46:19 2015 UTC,"Based on what I've seen, Adam like to go after movies that fail at being what they try to be. In other words, movies that aren't self-aware. An example would be how Cyberbully tries to portray itself as a serious portrayal of an important issue but just comes off as unintentionally hilarious.  The Avengers may be plodding and predictable - especially to people on this subreddit, since we tend to lean more toward indie-type films. But I'm not sure you could say that it lacks self-awareness on par with something like Cyberbully or Megan is Missing. It knows that it's a kitschy and formulaic superhero movie, and that makes it harder to really call it out on being exactly that. It might be bad, but it doesn't exemplify that special type of bad that can only come from a movie that spectacularly fails to be what it aims for."

Makes ""Lawrence of Arabia"" look like ""Birdemic"". At the end, I cried through the ending credits because of the beauty of the ending. The film's acting makes Daniel-Day Lewis' work seem pathetic. The realism packed into the performance of the complex character Butch the Bully really affects the audience emotionally. This movie makes me hate Scorsese, ""Goodfellas"", more like ""Badfellas""! ""Taxi Driver"", more like ""BADxi Driver""! Don't get me started on ""Raging Bull""...  The film ranks up with films like ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Casablanca"" in its excellence! Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman must be crying that they didn't accomplish a collaboration to make this film. ""The Seventh Seal"" is so bad compared to this, I mean where were the seals! I'm serious, that movie is really bad. But ""Cool Cat""!  I say that this film should be in the IMDb top TEN films of all time! Let alone the 250 greatest! ""The Shawshank Redemption"" at #1, really?

I was really moved by it due to the tragic nature of the story but not because of how it was filmed, and for a documentary I kind of wished he tried more to understand or research what caused her to do this and more input from more objective people.   Beautiful ode to his friend though but couldn't imagine watching it 6 times in 6 days holy shit."
YMS,319yvy,FardoBaggins,1 point,Fri Apr 3 20:59:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I watched it 6 times (7 now) because I was showing it to people I know. In my mind, It's an enormous expression of love to Andrew, Zachary, Kate and David from Kurt. It took him 6 years to travel around the US and parts of Canada and Europe. Hundreds of people were involved in the interviews but there was really only one behind it all, Kurt. He even composed the entire score (which is amazing). Just so he could have his last film with his best friend, which evolved into a gathering of every moment of his father's life and story's and then evolved again into exposing laziness in government and the activism of two more wonderful people. This resulted in there bill being passed. Not to mention David and Kate completely gave up everything to fight for Zachary and when he dies, they changed an entire form of law to make sure nothing like that could ever happen again. And after they go through all that hell, they still stay positive, they still have children. Despite the fact there were moments I entirely broke down, I overall found it beautiful, even in the heart-stabbingly sad parts. I do understand why you would find it depressing though I absolutely get that. Different people have different reactions to different things that's totally cool. Oh and I think he tried to get more perspective, like from the higher up's who denied him and her son. Truly the only person who knows why she did it was her. After all she had done that before, but as stated in the movie, I think it was about rejection. She was too much of a narcissist to handle that people she loved, didn't love her. Sorry for writing so damn much, It's totally cool if you skimmed this, but if not, hat's off to you man :)!"

YMS,315lgk,Who_Stole_The_Door,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:09:40 2015 UTC,On some level. It was Kubrick's point to try to bore his audience; he was attempting to bring about a sense of complacency to replace the otherwise ongoing sense of amazement that these beautiful scenes initially gave the audience. I wouldn't recommend it to everybody. That doesn't mean it doesn't have an amazing story and that Kubrick isn't an absolute master at bringing his audience on a very specific and incredible journey. And the story is extraordinary.
YMS,315lgk,mjknlr,0,Thu Apr 2 18:18:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, so its extraordinary and incredible. But why is it that? Kubrick's reputation aside why is it so amazing?"
YMS,315lgk,ArcherGorgon,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:33:14 2015 UTC,"The film captures the wholeness of humanity in ways that would make him the envy of great authors like James Joyce, and he does it in an almost entirely visual medium. He presents mankind in his very beginnings and juxtaposes what we view as rather dull, insignificant landscapes with the utter triumph that was the very first man using the very first tool (by the help of the alien Monolith, implied as a device intended by greater, more advanced beings to spur on the advancement of human intellect).  Then he throws that away and shows us the exact opposite! He shows us these brilliant, incredible devices of humankind being used in a mundane light. The first two large sequences bookend human progress and ingenuity; the rest of the film is devoted to life and consciousness from earth as it prepares to leave mankind. With the help of a second Monolith, mankind creates HAL 9000, the first computer with an entirely independent sentience. Kubrick then uses extraordinarily complex and gorgeous camerawork to show man rejecting his failed creation, shutting down HAL's brain in a nightmarish sequence that is comparable only to listening in on the final thoughts of a person with rapid Alzheimers.  The film finishes with an attempt to show us ""beyond the infinite""; a third Monolith seemingly transports Dave into a new dimension, and the advanced beings attempt to show him the vastness of the universe and transport him out of the myopia that his being entraps him in. The final scene has been debated since the film's release, but it's generally accepted that the beings are attempting to get Dave to accept his own mortality so he can transcend humanity entirely; upon a final encounter with the Monolith figure, he is reborn as a new being entirely -- the starchild, the next step for humanity. The ape to the human to the starchild; it is not only an odyssey that leads us to space, but one that bookends humanity entirely. It is, in my opinion, one of the most extraordinary stories ever told.  The entire movie is preceded by an entirely black screen set to foreboding music -- a black screen, or a Monolith viewed from extremely close. The film was Kubrick's attempt to move humanity forward, just like the one in the film. It's poetic and beautiful.  But I guess the scenes do kinda drag on a little bit."

Its how it uses those elements to tell the substance of the story."

If I was scared I'd feel safer with a gun.  As for how the ghost knows how to use a computer. Who cares? It makes no more sense than a ghost existing in the first place. The movie isnt trying to act like it makes sense. (Im not trying to defend this movie though)  My question is more to do with the ghost's strategy. If it's plan is to keep killing them one by one until the person who uploaded the video confesses, what if it kills that person before they confess? And then it would just kill the rest off to no avail. It obviously cares about knowing who it is, otherwise it'd just kill them all at once."

Saw his picture in an article with his parents and he was smiling slightly lol while they looked agitated. Turns out his mom filed a complaint against him too. I hope he finds this post in the YMS subreddit.   Edit- at least there's this http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/30t56d/singaporean_police_arrests_amos_yee_a_17yearold/ and I saw a 3k upvoted thread on /r/videos so it's not too bad. If he gets fined, I wouldn't mind helping the kid out pay it off.   Weird the thread disappeared off the front page http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/30u81u/this_is_how_you_get_3_years_in_jail/ This is this other thread though. http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/30uvdq/this_boy_was_arrested_by_singaporean_authorities/  Link to the video that stirred up this controversy. Got about 400,000 views before it was removed I think  http://youtu.be/6TZPdM3xn24  So fucked up, i found his videos to be brilliant and its a shame what's happened to him. Yall wanna tweet him to see if he can come on this subreddit and talk about everything?  And it looks like he's getting lots of hate mail and possibly death threats judging from his online accounts. His instagram page has a video from 11 weeks ago with 35 likes...and 1,425 comments .-. I'm ashamed of those particular youtubers who called him out and supported mass brigading against the dude.   I saw a change.org petition for his release too with 50 supporters but I doubt that it will help.   The news is trending a lot in Singapore but he's not getting much support outside of his country due to his very small audience. I see all these tweets and comments attacking him and who he is and I can't help feel awful. People calling him stupid, asshole, all sorts of stuff, he's got hundreds of downvote on his YouTube channel, he's gotten friggin arrested, and probably was forced to delete the video. Man..  It looks like practically no one is on his side, it's just an opinion. Literally nobody would be directly affected by a VIDEO OF HIS WORDS. Only the /r/Singapore subreddit has spread news about him on here. Anywhere else is based in Singapore. And WOW I just saw a post on that sub asking why people think Singapore doesn't have freedom of speech  ...  maybe because anyone can be arrested and charged with up to 3 years of jail time for speaking out against Christianity and some guy.  and I just saw a comment in that thread: ""we have limited freedom of speech. If it was a some full on freedom of speech everyone would have been throwing racist, sexist or blasphemous remarks already.""   L O L  And he got arrested 2 days ago, how the hell is he?? The news of the arrest broke today and it'll probably get worse if people start leaking his info/address. Popular youtubers from Singapore even started bashing him and calling rape on him apparently. Emotions are high since lots of people cared about the guy who died.   And honestly the guy he made the video about was a huge asshole. So many things this guy did that were bad and people saw right past them. How are you gonna try to control the media so much, have warrantless arrests, and crush any protest to government action, even opinions?? WTF."
YMS,30rhve,FardoBaggins,7,Mon Mar 30 09:40:30 2015 UTC,"the consensus right now is that kid is fucked. whether it was a poorly timed opinion video of their prime minister's passing away, or SG is really strict on these matters and is a SG concern exclusively. the latter is way scary. scary in a sense that when LKY passed away the whole country was in mourning and waxing nostalgic about him.   Amos, being the rebellious teen that he is definitely pushed a few buttons in his country. outside SG it would have been fine."
YMS,30rhve,Peeners,5,Mon Mar 30 10:40:55 2015 UTC,"yeah I totally agree. He should've been more careful, but it doesn't really surprise me much though. He knew that he could've been arrested (probably planned for it to happen) and he definitely timed it on purpose considering the title was something like ""_____ is finally dead"" anyway I think that was the title.  But I don't think it'll be too bad. As I said, he probably knew this was going to happen. Saw this comment in the Singapore sub  ""Even if charged with sedition, he'll likely be tried in Community Court because of his age. Assuming he pleads the usual mitigation, the sentencing guideline is relatively light (eg. day reporting, psychiatric treatment, community work order, home detection, etc.) vis-a-vis those dealt out to older offenders. The most popular measure, however, is supervised probation (at some welfare home) for the purpose of rehabilitation. It's nowhere as tough as detention barracks if he does the same BS during NS. Furthermore, the conviction can be expunged from record after he completes his sentence & does not re-offend."""
YMS,30rhve,FardoBaggins,1 point,Mon Mar 30 10:47:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's a little reassuring. I was hoping that it wouldn't be as harsh as the rest are making it to look. but seeing singapore's strictness and progress, it's hard to believe he was going to get off easy.

YMS,30rhve,Anazron,7,Mon Mar 30 11:32:04 2015 UTC,"No, he is completely right to say what he likes, Singapore is the bad guy here for arresting a minor for saying his opinion"

YMS,30rhve,jesus667,6,Mon Mar 30 07:21:55 2015 UTC,What ever happened to freedom of speech?   It never existed in Singapore.
YMS,30rhve,FardoBaggins,1 point,Tue Mar 31 05:02:26 2015 UTC,It never existed in Singapore.   That's partly true. As long as no one is offended you're good.
YMS,30rhve,jesus667,2,Tue Mar 31 06:56:01 2015 UTC,I think one of the preconditions for free speech is for taking offense to be an invalid reason to censor someone.
YMS,30rhve,FardoBaggins,1 point,Tue Mar 31 07:15:13 2015 UTC,"True as well. I would also agree that amos was or is a victim of censorship. I also believe that singaporeans are more practical than most. They are law abiding to a high degree, down to bubble gum chewing which reminds me of first grade classroom rules.  All the different races in singapore seem to have no problem with not being able to have a basic freedom of gum chewery. As backwards as it sounds they have completely eradicated the problems associated with vandals and hooligumism. To my mind, this puts their reactions to amos in perspective. As draconian as their laws may seem, the singaporeans themselves know what is best for them. Even jailing a teen for 'offensive' videos."
YMS,30rhve,FardoBaggins,-4,Tue Mar 31 07:51:31 2015 UTC,"it was given up or not really important in singapore. What's important there is that all are professional and help the economy and stuff. It's a small country. Anyway, limited freedom of speech  has some merits, by comparison incidents in other countries that have no issues with freedom of speech at all, but have violent reactions from it (charlie hebdo in paris is a great example- seeing that europe has no issues with censorship at all, apart from that thing with the islamic prophet.)  The only drawback to singapore's limited freedom of speech i think would be the lack of or limited real expression in their arts. Yes they are very good and professional and such but there isn't much life or pain or struggle or meaning in it or rather the artists are never free to do or say what they want which inhibits true artistry and expression."
YMS,30rhve,HovarTM,6,Mon Mar 30 08:54:49 2015 UTC,"So, the benefits of limited speech is that it's not as bad as more intense policies, and it's less likely that people's feelings will get hurt?"
YMS,30rhve,FardoBaggins,0,Mon Mar 30 17:42:04 2015 UTC,"Basically, yes. I'm just saying that SG is a very small country and freedom of speech is curbed even more so than larger western countries like the US and Europe with heaps of it. But even then people still get offended over there. What more in SG? Their intense policies have been working for them so far and that's the status quo for decades after surviving political unrest and racial violence. They had to do something about it otherwise, they wouldn't have gotten to where they are. I've been there last year and I've seen it first hand. It actually works.   Malays, Indians, Filipinos Muslims and Chinese live together without offending each other. These are vastly different cultures and they co-exist without much issue. One kid appears to have offended all of them which to my mind is some kind of feat. The Singaporeans were deeply offended and they jailed Amos for violating their laws. What can we do? Is waving freedom of speech banners the right thing? Is it abuse of freedom when it's intention is to deliberately offend people like charlie hebdo in paris? I'll quote south park here: Either it's all ok or nothing is."
YMS,30rhve,HovarTM,4,Tue Mar 31 06:30:35 2015 UTC,"The last sentence seemed contradictory to what you said previously.  I see your point, but offending people is necessary for a country to improve and laws that prevent people from speaking against their country or people stifle further progress. However, I do see your point. Many countries, like the US, have had free speech be suspended when necessary, but when left too long it can cause perversion from it's original intent at peacekeeping and become a tool to silence opponents.  People also seem to be using the voting system as an agree/disagree poll for some reason."
YMS,30rhve,FardoBaggins,1 point,Tue Mar 31 11:59:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I think I may have contradicted myself unintentionally.    You're right, freedom of speech should empower opinions and further knowledge and change. The curbing of this in SG is their own way of doing this in their situation.   I partially agree with them for arresting amos (since I believe he intentionally made the video offensive also bringing in jesus for a one-two punch to violate a law) but I also am for his freedom to say it. That's my take on the discussion and realize now it is contradictory.   Sure he thinks Lee Kuan Yew was some kind of dictator which is cool, and he can satirize jesus or christmas in his other videos if he wants, just not in singapore under their strict laws if found guilty. I don't think that the limited free speech there is used to silence opponents or to influence stuff (lee kuan yew has lost consecutively to other opponents, though he does sue or get sued for libel and doesn't lose....)  Hopefully, amos' case may be resolved with the western equivalent of a minor misdemeanor but if proven guilty, he needs all the help he can get."

These people have a right to speak negatively of the video. These people can post negative comments on the video, or even publicly say he shouldn't say these things. Fuck, YouTube is even allowed to remove the video, and tell him to put it up anywhere else. But NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE, has the goddamn right to punish him publicly for saying something they disagree with. No one should go to prison for an opinion. Sure, people around him are aloud to criticize him (wrongly criticize, but criticize still), and tell him they don't think it's okay for him to say that. But you can't take away a person's human right to speak out on all capacities because this extends past social media. He isn't allowed to say this anywhere now. How fucked up is that? I mean I will call out people all the time for being sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc, and tell them they shouldn't say that. But NEVER will I ever say that they CAN'T say that. Maybe they can't say that in certain private institutions, but they should still have the right to say it in certain capacities (I mean you aren't allowed to be racist in say a school, but at home or in a public space you are). Censorship is the removal of all platforms from which one can speak from. THIS is CENSORSHIP. And NO ONE should fucking stand for it."

YMS,30msar,ItsJustRoy,18,Sat Mar 28 20:33:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know if he really has an issue with them; they're just not very good examples of creative, introspective, meaningful film, and thus Adam has no interest in them. He is not their target audience. They usually involve a very basic story structure and contain very little to make one reflect on the human experience. If the films do cause you to reflect on the human experience, that's great, but the writing is generally pretty sophomoric. These films are made to appeal to as many people as possible and because of that the writers have to create easy-to-follow stories with simple character development and catchy dialogue. They've been compared to candy; they're sweet, they taste good, they appeal to plenty of people, but they don't really nourish you in any way."
YMS,30msar,mjknlr,5,Sat Mar 28 20:44:43 2015 UTC,"I think I remember him saying that if you're one of those people who can turn your brain off you're much more likely to enjoy it, and since he's not one of those people it doesn't appeal to him."
YMS,30msar,taco_roco,4,Sat Mar 28 21:07:33 2015 UTC,"That being said, I think the standard of ""cinematic candy"" has been raised somewhat, at least in regard to superhero flicks. Over the last couple of decades, things like Captain America 1990, Steel, and Catwoman used to be acceptable because ""eh, fuck it, it's a comic book, they won't know the difference."" But now, there's an advent of production teams, many of which grew up with these characters and understand them, who actually invest effort and take the source  ""seriously"" (as in, legitimately referring to the material for ideas and components, not necessarily dark and gritty realism). From that, we end up with a litany of frankly well-made products: Spider-Man 2, Dark Knight, Iron Man, Avengers. These aren't masterpieces, but they do strike a strike an original tone, aren't afraid of what they are, and tell the story they set out to tell. We absolutely still have duds (Iron Man 2-3, Spider-Man 3, X-Men Last Stand, Wolverine Origins, etc) but I think general public sentiment has shifted to ""Wow, that was a pretty bad comic book movie"", when it used to be simply ""well, what did you expect, it's a superhero flick."" We still have our Fast 18s and Transformers 12s, but at least with the superhero, I think the public has been shown that there can be good material derived from it, just like any genre, and they're grading present releases accordingly."

YMS,30msar,Antrix32,2,Tue Mar 31 04:35:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not Adam obviously, but I imagine the fact that they're pretty predictable and formulaic is a big part of it.

YMS,30msar,jesus667,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:55:30 2015 UTC,"Because it's essentially all the same movies. Assuming each new hero gets a trilogy, you're watching the same basic origin story over and over again for every first film in the series. Hell, Guardians of the Galaxy had a huge advantage because it had a 2 minute opening, then just blasted you into it, and it still wasn't great."

The fact that he has all these professional actor headshots and demo reels on his IMDB page give a hint that his parents could be trying to shove him into acting. Who knows what's up, so I hope the best for the big fella.  Edit: I just saw he even has a trivia page which has all these random facts bragging about him (and his family). He also has a brother with very similar stuff on his page. Judging from the movies they've been in... all really low-grade acting stuff.. it really doesn't look like a normal case of ""a family influenced by love for acting""  and it seems more likely his parents are trying to milk him into being a big actor whilst he's young."

However, he is probably the shittiest film critic on the entire internet otherwise. He criticized Requiem for a Dream because it was about drugs being bad and that Jennifer Connoly didn't look sexy in it, he criticized Irreversible because the dialogue was realistic and the fact that it was in reverse chronological order, he dismisses pretty much anything art house as ""pretentious"" without even trying to analyze it in any way, and he pretty much makes up his mind about the movies he watches BEFORE EVEN WATCHING THEM!   The worst part is the format. Watching a movie while talking to a camera most likely has the same affect as watching a movie while on your phone at the same time. If you didn't watch the entire movie you're reviewing because you were talking to a camera, then why the fuck are you even critiquing to begin with?  Can't wait for that guy to quit making his shitty videos."

YMS,30kuwy,Milo451,3,Sun Mar 29 05:11:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is one of the better horror movies of recent years. I had very few gripes with it beyond personal opinion. The scene in the kitchen near the beginning of the movie didn't make sense in the universe it created, and to a lesser extent so did the first sighting of it (elaboration below). This along with the usual horror cliche of the antagonist menacing the main character where in other scenes in similar positions it attacks.  Personal opinion wise I would have enjoyed more concrete 'rules', or at least elaboration on the rules already set that it has to follow (see what I did there?).  -SPOILER ALERT-  I didn't understand why it pissed itself while in the kitchen. It didn't make any sense. It never did anything like that in the rest of the movie, and there wasn't really a reason for it to do it then. I also don't get why it was naked in the first scene and wearing non-white clothes in the kitchen scene. It was wearing all white in every other scene."
YMS,30kuwy,infoundead,2,Sat Mar 28 14:20:04 2015 UTC,"That was one thing I was a little bugged about was a seeming lack of concrete rules for ""it"". Personally to me the Kitchen scene was fine, because it can take on any form and dramatic effect and such. On the note of it attacking sometimes it was nice to see it kind of change form to adapt (I.e. Smaller to crawl or larger to fill more of room). In the end I really liked it."
YMS,30kuwy,Temporary11211,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:07:37 2015 UTC,"-SPOILERS-  Also, the thing seems to be on a path heading towards it's target always..... why was it just standing in the middle of the kitchen not moving, before slowly stepping towards her? I feel like the nudity is just sometimes it has clothes and other times it doesn't, maybe it's just random with it's appearance every time? I also both like, and dislike the lack of explanation, as it's kinda still a mysterious creature, that I don't know about and am still interested by, after the movie... but also I REALLY want to know, and have to either wait for a sequel in hopes of it explaining what it is, or some other sorta explanation. I'm guessing some sorta supernatural thing of course, but why through sex, why does it chase them? Why did it fuck up that chick in the beginning, and rape the guy to death in a later scene? Also what did it do? Rape his soul out? Where did it come from? what happens if it goes all the way down the list? can you just trap it? etc."
YMS,30kuwy,JackYaos,1 point,Sun Mar 29 08:47:59 2015 UTC,"Watched it two times, and I gotta agree on the first appearence. It doesn't make any sense that ""it"" would scare a victim new to the concept by appearing naked. It actually makes the story of the guy more believiable, so it's not in ""it""s interest. The kitchen apparence is excusable, my understanding is that it took its most dreadful appearence to incapacitate its victim. It works for a while, where she fell on the floor. The next apperance is the big guy, where I believe it took this appareance to fill up the door frame so she wouldn't escape. When the entrance is small, it takes the appearence of the child stalker from the begining of the movie to be able to crawl."

YMS,30gqa3,rappercake,6,Fri Mar 27 09:45:25 2015 UTC,"'The script by Tarantino contains an extended flashback sequence starring Donny ""The Bear Jew"" Donowitz, a part played by Eli Roth that was originally written for Adam Sandler. The scene comes just as Donny is about to beat a Nazi to death with his baseball bat -- we see Donny buying the bat in his old neighborhood in Boston (spelled ""Bostin"") right before shipping out to fight in World War II. Good luck not hearing Happy Madison's voice screaming in your brain as you read this dialogue, by the way:  ""Put down your Yahtzee/It's time to beat some Nazis ...""  Donny then goes around the neighborhood asking his fellow Jews if they have any loved ones in danger in Europe, and to write down their names on the baseball bat. At one point he goes to the house of one Mrs. Himmelstein (who would have been played by Frau Blucher from Young Frankenstein), and right before signing the bat, she says: ""Remember your roots by never spelling anything correctly, ever."" To which Donny replies: ""Now have some freshly baked cookies, sweetie."" Cut to Donny spilling the Nazi's brains out in the woods.""

Avengers: Age of Ultron. I promised a friend, so I'm going to watch the first one to prepare. I don't mind though. Mad Max looks fucking insane. Tomorrowland seems interesting. Curious about Ant-Man. Mission Impossible 5 looks like fun I hope Fantastic Four is going to good. Jurassic World is another ""please be good"" one. Not interested, but maybe Furious 7 could be another fun time. One I'm looking forward to is based on the book ""Me, Earl, and the dying girl"". The book is a YA fiction about a guy who is forced to befriend a classmate with leukemia. Sounds like The Fault in our Stars, right? But I really like the direction it took and hope that movie follows some what of the same. Also, it won the top audience and grand jury awards at Sundance this year. Guess who won those last year: Whiplash."

The humor is derived from the tendency to judge a book by its cover; if your opinions aren't judged by your reactions, you can see that this is more of a praise of Adam's consistency and honesty when rating movies. A negative reaction towards Adam because of this image would show the person never actually watched both films with a complete understanding of what they were trying to do. This image is a praise of Adam and an indictment of people who react before analyzing, but both parties will walk away from it thinking it verifies their own ideas.  IT'S BRILLIANT. 6/10."

YMS,2zle5p,masonshr,5,Thu Mar 19 15:36:33 2015 UTC,I don't know the name of the movie because I think I saw it when I was somewhat young. But the plot basically revolved around you having to avoid darkness. Near the end of the movie there was a group of people and they had to stealthily move through a building and a bunch of them got killed because there was a power outage or something. Maybe someone on this sub will know the name of it- it featured a young boy protagonist. I think he was accused of murder in the beginning of the movie and no one would believe his innocence.   Its the only one that stuck with me cause it was one of the first horror films I saw. And then most other horror movies I saw were just meh.
YMS,2zle5p,chevybow,2,Thu Mar 19 16:49:58 2015 UTC,Are you thinking of Darkness Falls?

YMS,2zle5p,lockezwill,2,Sat Mar 21 21:44:07 2015 UTC,Tale of Two Sisters was really memorable to me. I watched it when really young and it stuck. (though I haven't seen it recently to be able to judge it more objectively)  Something about the way that korean is spoken in that sharp sarcastic inflection at the end of every sentence makes the two main female characters seem so hysterical and crazy. Decent cinematography and beautiful lighting and color. Slow character building. Disturbing enough to be a good psychological horror though at several points seems to have more of a drama element. And omg a horror film where the characters are well developed and their personalities are used as part of the horror. Freaking novel idea. And Americans be like.....let's dumb it down and make it look absolutely generic for an American audience....ı just couldn't bring myself to watch the predictably shitty American remake.

YMS,2zg0xd,Catjaz63,1 point,Thu Mar 19 02:10:21 2015 UTC,Except this video actually has good special effects.
YMS,2zg0xd,buzzair1001,-14,Sat Mar 21 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"God dammit I remember this video. I always really hated the way the pixel art looked in it and the way it fell apart. It feels so generic and uninspired. When I watched the trailer my first reaction was ""This looks like a stupid youtube video that Freddie Wong would make."" I was wrong on the person but I guess I was right about it being youtube. At least I'm glad they were able to make it worse by adding Adam Sandler."
YMS,2zg0xd,buzzair1001,8,Wed Mar 18 14:26:14 2015 UTC,"It feels so generic and uninspired.   What....?  Of course it was inspired, you dolt. It was inspired by old video games. That is the whole point. The video works on a youtube video level. I know this is a sub for a reviewer of movies, but the cynicism and over-analyzation is not necessary on such trivial things."
YMS,2zg0xd,sammanzhi,-8,Wed Mar 18 22:53:43 2015 UTC,"Do you not know that there is a more figurative meaning of uninspired? Or did you just assume I have no knowledge of classic video games? Also I was clearly talking about the specific pixel art featured in the film, not all pixel art in general. I'm really starting to think you're just illiterate."
YMS,2zg0xd,FashionableNonsense,11,Thu Mar 19 04:51:29 2015 UTC,How to make a completely idiotic video game based movie:  1.) Focus on classic video game tropes  2.) Cast Adam Sandler and/or Kevin James.   Yup. Fits the bill. This is going to be awful.
YMS,2zg0xd,lhmatt,8,Wed Mar 18 16:45:28 2015 UTC,That looks abysmal...  Can't wait for it to take up half the screenings at my local theaters. =/

Even if the govt would consider video games an important part of our culture did the waste space on their spaceship with big ass arcade cabinent, or would they put atari versions of these games on there? I've played pacman and donkeykong on the atari and these aliens would have to be mentally disabled to enjoy those games.   Or theyre just marketing to people who would go see an Adam Sandler movie anymore. Your parents."
YMS,2zg0xd,dongsuvious,2,Wed Mar 18 20:30:15 2015 UTC,"83 was really the crash. Technically like, the very very last week of December in 82 though if thats what you mean."
YMS,2zg0xd,YMSdisciple,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:24:23 2015 UTC,Wasnt sure. Were games a big deal in 82 though? Like big enough to consider it a part of our culture?
YMS,2zg0xd,BrotherCheese,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:31:58 2015 UTC,"Eh not technically on a big scale like today. That being said though, it only looks like there were like 4 different games in the trailer, so it might have been them playing the Atari console versions of the games. In which case, someone could definitely fit the console and games in a little box on the side."
YMS,2zg0xd,CodeineCaptain,4,Tue Mar 24 19:40:27 2015 UTC,This looks like a freddy wong video

YMS,2zg0xd,mardfet,2,Wed Mar 18 17:42:55 2015 UTC,"Adam Sandler is only acting, not directing. I guess that's sort of a plus? Still looks like a rip-off of a Freddie Wong video.  I still don't think this'll be that good though."
YMS,2zg0xd,iamstephano,2,Wed Mar 18 21:48:41 2015 UTC,Honestly I like the visuals and the concept but given that it's Sandler there's no way it'll be good. I think if this was Matthew Vaughn or Phil Lord/Chris Miller it could've been good.
YMS,2zg0xd,SnowyCaptain,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:25:04 2015 UTC,I thought it looked interesting until I actually saw the trailer. Bizarre.

We were waiting for a taxi when this guy approached a female friend of mine and starting grabbing her and kissing her. I told him she had a boyfriend and then he just got really aggressive and tried to intimidate me. A bunch of his mates popped out of a car and jumped us. I only got as fucked up as I did because I was dealing with one guy and got sucker punched by another. From that point, I got beat from every which way.  But thanks for the kind words everyone, I just gotta get past these few days and I'll be fine. And it'll be good as long as I remember: Cool Cat loves me."

Kind of sucks, but I'm not going to hold it against them. It would be pretty childish of me to act as though there's any wrongdoing in refraining from associating with me or having me as a contact. Maybe I'm just reading into it too much and I'm completely mistaken, but I'm not going to try to contact them for collaboration suggestions at this point.

We'll see how long that lasts, but it's been praised for not having stupid characters (little-to-no ""WHAT THE FUCK WERE THEY THINKING"" moments) and that it had a decent amount of tension. I'm just gonna see since it's an interesting concept, and it looks like whoever made it actually gave a shit.  If it's good, well that's just an added bonus."

The reason we hate Michael Goi so much is that he's this guy with this hugely inflated ego who actually has a really decent platform from which to spew his ""passion project,"" then goes online and pretends to be random internet users while he defends his art, unable to cope with the idea that someone might have a valid reason for disliking it.

I assume the protagonist is that character and the one in the forefront of the poster. Apparently attractive woman in overalls = fat and ugly? And Señor Chang is in it? What is this movie, why does it have a 7.1 on IMDB? Is this movie actually like really deep and just looks dumb and nonsensical?"

The usage of ""young parson"" terms and half-baked references to pop culture will appeal to this generation of young folks who will feel included and desired; the intentions of the filmmakers will appear genuine because of their ability to ""keep up"" with the social conventions of the day.  The film has a ""good message"", the filmmakers are ""genuine"", and the target audience is ""good people."" There isn't one single person that will leave that film thinking they're an asshole for excluding fat or ugly people when they're faced with Egg Whitman. They'll be able to pat themselves on the back, confident in their love for their fellow man, knowing that when they're faced with a similar situation, they'll be able to– oh fuck Becky just looked at me.

I was just guessing Adam's might be I've Seen Footage because of how much it might speak to his interest in finding and experiencing really obscure movies and videos as well as other obscure media, and, while one interpretation of I've Seen Footage is one of media induced desensitization, it the lyrics could also be interpreted as media immersion, and as someone getting excited about getting to experience some new exciting media that few others have yet to appreciate.

YMS,2z3dgh,AIIIAAB_Lincoln,4,Mon Mar 16 05:21:46 2015 UTC,In a way he was fucking with the drummers to have them play at there peak speed. I also think he vented his rage on his students there.

Since he was unable to find a drummer able to perform the double time swing correctly, he probably just removed it from the song. But the whole point of the extended practice sequence was to show exactly how far Fletcher was willing to go to push his students to their limits, by giving them a (seemingly) impossible task, regardless of whether or not it was in the song. He was just trying to see how dedicated they were."

YMS,2ypva7,KunYAY,20,Wed Mar 11 20:37:44 2015 UTC,"I think its because Nostalgia Critic rarely actually critiques movies. Its more just making unfunny jokes and jabs at the movie instead of constructive criticism. I don't hate him, and Doug Walker himself is a really chill guy but his reviews focus too much in being funny as opposed to actually reviewing movies."
YMS,2ypva7,Mashedwaffle,4,Wed Mar 11 21:15:19 2015 UTC,"To be fair I don't know if you would consider Adam to be someone who ""actually critiques movies"" since his most popular videos are the funny ones- not the serious ones. I think if you're looking for a real thorough critique of a movie you won't find it on a channel called ""Yourmoviesucks"".   I love Adam for his humor and love watching his reviews + streams but I find it weird that his reddit following thinks he's the most perfect movie reviewer in the world and no one can compare. Even when he puts out a bad review, anyone that criticizes it gets downvoted because people think he's perfect and free from criticism."
YMS,2ypva7,chevybow,10,Thu Mar 12 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying that Adam is devoid of humor or even that humor has no place in a movie review but he goes out of his way to point out flaws and trends that create problems with the film. He makes fun of the film yes, but that's not the only thing he does. And actually, I don't think that every point Adam has made is necessarily flawless. There are plenty of things that I disagree with or disregard completely but his videos get me thinking about counter points. Nostalgia Critics reviews have never made me debate, how do you come up with a counter point to a boner joke? In my opinion, debating this stuff is half the fun anyway so if I see some one disagreeing with Adam I'm more likely to open discussion with them instead of blindly defending everything Adam says."
YMS,2ypva7,Mashedwaffle,2,Thu Mar 12 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"The thing is as well is you have to take into account that Doug and Adam appear to have very different tastes when it comes to movies, I mean you wouldn't see Doug 'reviewing' any Lars Von Trier or long detailed analyses. I'd say the audience is quite different as to some extent when we're watching a YMS video we're also looking to be informed and well as humored, im not going to lie when i say that some of my favorite movies i've watched in the past year and a half have breen recommended by Adam. And i simply don't get that from Doug, he's a funny guy for sure but both fanbases expect something different out of each respectively which is probally why Adam's following is as dedicated as it is."

YMS,2ypva7,_watching,3,Wed Mar 11 22:26:26 2015 UTC,"The skits definitely do it for me.. every once in a while I'll think ""I wonder what everyone thought of this movie, let's check out Nostalgia Critic first. Haven't seen him in a while."" Then he gets into some skit or run-on joke and after half a minute I have to close the window.   It's probably just ""I like YMSs jokes and not his"" but every time I end up thinking ""the bad skit:actual opinions ratio is too high for this to be worth watching""."

YMS,2ypva7,gopher65,3,Thu Mar 12 05:34:42 2015 UTC,"No one has mentioned Confused Matthew here. Most of his hate comes from bashing popular movies like    Lion King for having shitty morals,  Back to the Future Part II for being too silly aswell as too loaded with exposition, and  2001: A Space Odyssey because he doesn't know what's happening and thinks the plot was a vague artsy farce that was all up to interpretation, but while certain subtle themes maybe hidden in the cracks of that movie, in fact the actual plot is quite concrete. Not that there's anything wrong with faulting a movie for poor conveyance. I didn't get it my first time either, but he really ought to have done a basic google search to find out the plot of the movie before he went on his half-hour rampage of ""crap floating in space"".    Ofcourse I tend to respect his opinion on most things, and he has said that what displeases him is not the lack of action, since one of his favorite movies, Gattica has almost no action, and that what really grabs his goat is the lack of dialogue."
YMS,2ypva7,_watching,1 point,Thu Mar 12 05:43:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think he mentioned it in that review, but in a couple other ones he says something like this:   ""And yes, I've googled the thing I've been ranting about for ten minutes. But I shouldn't have to do that. I shouldn't have to read the SW:Extended Universe novels for retconned background, I shouldn't have to glance though 50 years of comics to enjoy a single Marvel/DC movie, and I shouldn't have to spend hours researching things Cameron said about Avatar in various interviews in order to get plot critical background information. That should all be IN THE MOVIE if you need to understand it to fully enjoy the movie! Failure of the filmmakers to do that is not the viewer's fault, and that's what I'm talking about. Of course I googled it.""  He's not wrong, but sometimes he goes overboard in his rigid thinking. Sometimes things he thinks are plot critical are - for me - just a bit of extra background information that enhances the movie for me if I happen to come across it. Sometimes he's spot on though coughAvatarcough."

Its been a while but I remember cheap action and a lot of hollywood hero magic, as in, the protagonists appear to be the only competent people in the world of the film.  Maybe they ran out of money, or the first parts were accidentally good, or they felt pressured to appeal to a larger audience.  I might have to watch it again but I remember being drawn in by interesting characters and a tense, puzzling plot, and being let down by an unbelievable rescue scene and logical problems in the story."
YMS,2ygh29,Robin_Hood-Rat,4,Mon Mar 9 23:32:29 2015 UTC,"Rescue scene?  (Spoilers ahead) I remember the third act being 'we seriously need to go kill this guy's son and his friends because they're goddamn lunatics.' Yeah I guess they rescued the one girl they were about to kill but that wasn't their initial plan.  It was a small shoot out in that huge building that I remember resembling a castle for some reason, but I liked it. It wasn't over the top, just gripping. Maybe I need to see it again (and I plan to with my dad soon), but I don't remember it being anything cheesy or shoehorned in  Also thank you for discussing this with me. I've been wanting to talk about this movie for awhile."

YMS,2ydmvf,Trionout,5,Mon Mar 9 01:56:56 2015 UTC,My guess on what happens in the film:  Boy gets inspired  Boy looks stupid while trying to do something great  Random kid the boy doesn't know comes to help him  Boy does some amazing stuff that can possibly make his dream true  Something tragic happens that make the boy quit his dream  Boy gets inspired again  Boy goes to the championships  Boy meets a jerk in the championship  It looks like the boy might lose  Miracle happens and the boy wins

YMS,2y8hgf,anEvergreenOldboy,26,Sat Mar 7 12:32:44 2015 UTC,"Battle Royale is one of my favorite books and it's told through over 30 different character's perspectives. The movie actually attempted to do this aspect of the novel justice. The age of the students are about 15, I believe? And they actually hired actors about that age. The brutality was not toned down (unlike some other fight to the death movie) and watching it happen to actors this young is a unique experience itself. I would argue about the acting quality in the film as it definitely  has some cheese and drama, but wouldn't students that young in a life/death situation make drama for themselves and overreact? The actor for the teacher (forgot actor's name but I know he's well known for yakuza films) definitely had a highlight performance. Overall, the film didn't do the book complete justice but if it tried, it would have well been over 3 hours long. It tried to remain as faithful as possible to a really complex book which is really admirable while still being condensed  enough for a film audience. My biggest gripe with the film was not keeping Kazuo' (machine gun shooter) back story as it would have made his character more abstract and allegorical (as the book did) rather than unbelievably evil."
YMS,2y8hgf,lockezwill,3,Sat Mar 7 13:47:19 2015 UTC,I love the film. I just think the acting is fine (though there are a number of cheesy moments) I really liked the directing - a lot of stylish moments but mostly just solid work. I just think the movie sets up an exciting premise and follows it through in a semi-believable and slightly allegorical way.
YMS,2y8hgf,TheRingshifter,1 point,Sat Mar 7 16:30:46 2015 UTC,"It was definitely OK at best. It has a really great concept and the beginning is really good, I think, but it really doesn't progress in a lot of interesting ways."

YMS,2y8hgf,ProxyReaper,1 point,Sun Mar 8 08:07:18 2015 UTC,I think it's one of those movies that's best appreciated when you don't take it very seriously. Which can be tricky since there's so much death and gore and whatnot.
YMS,2y8hgf,DestricTz,1 point,Mon Mar 9 02:05:57 2015 UTC,"i didn't like it all all. So many stupid moments, and all the death scenes were clichéd and exaggerated.

But to be honest I had a big expectations for this movie, since so many people said how amazing Battle royal is. I even read somewhere Tarantino said it's his favorite movie? Nothing with this movie was better than average IMO. I guess people like it because it's different and contains some brutal scenes"

YMS,2y8sdc,Nezzatic,11,Sat Mar 7 15:03:32 2015 UTC,"I think the remake is much better. The original lacks a lot of the fun that the new one does, and it has some serious glaring pacing issues. I may be a bit biased, as I saw the remake first and it's one of my favorites, but it really is a lot of fun."
YMS,2y8sdc,TheBosma,6,Sat Mar 7 16:42:12 2015 UTC,Why not watch both and decide for yourself?  Personally I like the remake because the interactions between the characters are much more believable and entertaining.
YMS,2y8sdc,mwguthrie,2,Sat Mar 7 17:45:45 2015 UTC,I will but i figured i'd prefer watching the better one first. I'd be disapointed if i didn't enjoy the second one because i already knew the story from the first one i watched.

YMS,2y5flz,boompoe,21,Fri Mar 6 16:56:22 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents. It's better than Elysium. I think I can narrow down why I thought that personally;  1. The characters had character  One of the problems with Elysium for me was that the characters were incredibly bland. If you asked me to describe Matt Damon's character, I couldn't do it. But if you asked me about the characters from Chappie (minus Hugh Jackman, who was the blandest part of the film), then I could describe them to you. Now, they did stupid things, and their motivations were somewhat cookie cutter, but they had personalities nonetheless.  2. The underlying message isn't being forced down your throat constantly  That's the biggest problem Elysium had; at every moment, there was social commentary on universal healthcare. Social commentary is fine when done well, but Elysium shoved it in your face at every moment possible. Now Chappie does have ham-fisted dialogue, it's true; that's one of the weaker parts of the film. But it wasn't rallied around a single point Blomkamp was trying to get across. It was an amalgamation of ideas; consciousness, mortality, a world reliant on machines. These ideas didn't come across perfect, but at the very least the film wasn't concentrated on one in particular.  3. The visual effects kicked it up a notch. Elysium was, by all accounts, a visually impressive film. But I think Chappie looked even better. The models of the scouts looked great, the action scenes were spectacular. This really wasn't a surprise, Blomkamp is good at making visually impressive films.  That said, I do have some complaints;  1. The script  Please get someone else to write your films, Blomkamp. It's not an admission of defeat. You're good at directing, let someone who specializes in writing do it.  2. Die Antwoord overload  I thought that, for their roles, they did an alright job. But it wasn't just them acting; they were wearing their band shirts, their music was playing constantly... it was too much.   3. The ending  Well, there's no easy way to go about this without spoilers. So,  SPOILERS LIE BELOW!  The ending had too much going on. There was the fight with Hugh Jackman that ended anticlimactically, and then they moved on to transferring people's consciousness into other bodies. I love that kind of sci-fi, but that ending was the opposite of what the movie had to say on consciousness.  The entire movie we're told that consciousness really can't be understood, that it's greater than what we know. There was even a ham-fisted talk about ""moving on"" after death. Hell, one of the major themes of this film is mortality. And then, all of the sudden, everybody's able to move consciousness around with ease. After being told the opposite the entire movie, this ending doesn't really work. I would have much rather seen Deon die, and have Chappie realize that mortality is inevitable. End it with him sitting, watching the sunset, as his battery dies. That ending works better, IMO.  END SPOILERS!  Overall, I enjoyed Chappie. It was no District 9, but it really isn't as horrible as I would have thought. Just go in with somewhat low expectations, and you should be surprised."
YMS,2y5flz,ColonelSanders21,5,Fri Mar 6 20:54:27 2015 UTC,Totally with you on the Die Antwoord overload. I mean they even had their promotional photos as posters on the walls.

I cant think of an action role she's been in (without googling at least) other than Lucy which was... Less than stellar.  That and the Avengers but Black Widow was so forgettable.

YMS,2y3xqk,RiddledWays,2,Fri Mar 6 05:38:59 2015 UTC,"Thats a good suggestion, however I prefer Metacritic, just because I think its a better rating system. Aggregating review scores rather than classifying a 60% or higher rating as ""fresh"" and below as ""rotten"", then just calculating which percentage of critics gave it more than 60. Metacritic just feels a bit more accurate the way they do it.  Here's Metacritic's ""coming soon"" section : http://www.metacritic.com/browse/movies/release-date/coming-soon/date"

Kristen Schaal's pedantry was annoying the first time, and then it was pretty much every joke.  Bill Hader's house bugged me because it wasn't ""what I would do in that situation"" (half the appeal of the show) and because it seemed like an excuse to bottle the show into fewer sets. Whereas Kristen Schaal bugged me because it seems actually challenging to make a Kristen Schaal character boring.  EDIT: Will Forte, but aren't we all Bill Hader?"

What makes it bad is that there is no music, leaving us to only concentrate on the acting. The cinematography is bad too, there is no artistic vision. You simply cut to the next person as they are talking. During times with fast dialogue it's really distracting and annoying."
YMS,2xhqnp,banoy,1 point,Sun Mar 1 02:06:05 2015 UTC,I intentionally chose to put in no music for the film. I tried editing it with a bunch of different songs but nothing ever seemed to fit.
YMS,2xhqnp,Cure_Tap,2,Sun Mar 1 03:05:40 2015 UTC,"This is pretty late to be responding to this, but I wanted to share my thoughts on it anyways. It's pretty lengthy, so I apologize for that.  I actually like the idea for this short film, but the execution feels flat. Someone else mentioned room tone to you, which is inconsistently applied. It's pretty high in the mix for the opening shot, but once you two sit down on the couch for your conversation, it drops down to almost zero. While I could hear it since I'm wearing headphones, it was really low in the mix. It's slightly jarring since the room tone cuts in clearer during dialogue, and you can hear the space, but then it drops down to almost nothing again during the quiet spots. And then during the final shot the room tone is very apparent once again. It's too high in the mix in the opening and closing shots, and it's practically inaudible during the remainder of the short. You should probably find a balance somewhere in here, but I would err just a touch closer to the quieter end of things. You want enough to hear it, but not so much that it's competing with the dialogue, like during the closing shot where they sound too close in volume.  The scene itself also feels a bit lifeless. It's an endless parade of shot reverse shot of the two of you sitting on a couch, which isn't exactly engaging to watch. I feel like there's a power struggle going on in the dialogue, and it would have been nice to see that represented visually. The dialogue conveys the turns the argument takes well enough, but I feel like you're neglecting the film aspect of your short film.  What I would have done would have been to have the actors stand up during the conversation at the moments that the power balance shifted. You stand up and declare that you're breaking up with her, she stands up when she denies your request to break up. The two of you argue standing up, since you're both jockeying for control. When she offers to break down for you why it doesn't make sense, you sit down again and she remains standing while she explains it. You two come to an understanding, and she sits down on the couch again when she says that the two of you shouldn't break up. The power imbalance has ended, and the two of you are back on the same level and back together on the couch. A tidy little drama has unfolded here, and you can see the moments where a turn has happened.   I obviously wouldn't have the characters just stand up directly in front of the couch, since that would be very stilted and unnatural, but rather have them explore the space of the room as they talk, like people do, which also keeps things from becoming too stagnant. I might keep the couch somewhere in the frame at all times though. Not necessarily always in focus, but always visible to sort of make a connection in the viewers minds that the two of them, the couch, and the relationship are all intertwined on some level, if that makes sense. Maybe a bit inconsistent considering what I said about the person sitting on the couch representing the one who has less power, but I'm just spitballing here anyways. This whole thing is just what I would have done if I were directing this short, not necessarily what you should have done. It's good to discover your own ways to make the cinematography and the blocking interesting.  I like the cutaways that you do when she's going down the list of your past relationships, but they could be cleaned up a bit. The joke about ""the female Sydney"" is lost on me almost entirely. I'm assuming you're referring to the girl in the yellow plaid that you point to, but it's not entirely clear. Maybe make the two of you more similar looking -- wear the same sort of clothing, have the same mannerisms, whatever -- in order to strengthen the connection in viewers minds. I'd bring her closer to the foreground as well, because at this distance and with her out of focus, she doesn't look like she's actually involved in the scene. I would also change up the pacing on the reveal of you being strangled in the next shot, to the point in the dialogue where she says ""who tried to murder you"". This is more of my own personal comic taste, but it punches up the scene for me and makes it funnier when I visualize it that way in my head. You get a beat with the shot of the empty hallway, and then a punchline when the two of you come into frame with her strangling you. The lack of talking during the shots of you reminiscing about the good times is very nice though, and the use of close ups immediately after this is great. I like the closing shot as well with you two sitting on the couch together. I might have composed it slightly differently, maybe more of a straight on shot, but that's really more of a personal style thing than an actual critique.  All in all, this is a good idea for a short and one that I wanted to like more than I did. Some of the other people here don't like the acting in this for whatever reason, but actors are kind of whatever at this stage. When you're a film student, you use what you can get, but really the main point is to focus on honing the filmmaking side of things. I just think you need to work on your cinematography and your editing, and everything will be fine.   Keep it up man, and keep asking for advice and trying to improve, even if you think what you're currently doing is fine. Everyone can get better. Even the best are always pushing the envelope of what they're capable of."
YMS,2xhqnp,Cure_Tap,2,Fri Mar 13 03:34:03 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the long write up. I really appreciate it. I actually agree with a lot of your critique and it's things I'll keep in mind for my next film. The sound mixing I'll work on. I tried my best and it was really my first attempt at it. That's just something I think I'll get better with the more I practice. I also really liked your suggestion of the characters exploring the space more. I'm not sure if that's the exact way I would have done it but I really wish I would have thought of something like that. It would have definitely been more interesting than the shot reverse shot I did, which is admittedly very boring. Thank you again for the critique and advice. I really, really appreciate it."
YMS,2xhqnp,irishfries,1 point,Fri Mar 13 04:23:35 2015 UTC,"No problem, man. I was bored and browsing the subreddit, and happened to stumble across your post. Just felt compelled to share my critique."
YMS,2xhqnp,irishfries,1 point,Fri Mar 13 04:33:45 2015 UTC,"Honest opinion?   Acting was not good, it made it a bit hard to watch on its own.  Cinematography was boring. Pretty much same angles, over and over. The flashback shots felt dull and didn't seem to really flow.  Writing didn't really grab me. It felt just...dull. The acting didn't help.  I could hear the voices fine, but no music, no room tone, nothing.   Honestly, overall, not good. The whole thing lacked any direction in the plot and felt very dull in presentation. It felt very uninspired and lacked any sort of real drama. It's okay though, you can't win them all and that's fine. I would look into maybe doing a different subject matter, and definitely studying up on stylizing your work. Keep doing stuff and figure out what works for you, and do that but don't forget to branch out and change it up."

The part with the 16 year old kinda tainted things, tho. Overall: 6/10. You're definitely talented, though, and I can see you doing great things with better material."

Its not really making fun of the idea of dark and gritty reboots in any way it's just a what if example of one such reboot.

The way they approach things is really different, but the insight is there. They go in-depth in their own ways.  I really love Errant Signal.

YMS,2wx5zi,PleaseCallMeSAM,4,Mon Feb 23 22:26:32 2015 UTC,I have no urge to ever rewatch it & there were quite a few other films more worthy of a best picture nomination but it was still entertaining & worth viewing.
YMS,2wx5zi,scootawhat,7,Tue Feb 24 05:55:22 2015 UTC,"6/10, cooper is good, most of the cinematography is fairly falt. It's not as RAW RAW America as people make it out to be, though it is present in the film. The movie does capture the effects of war, but not in a new or interesting way. Chris Kyle is developed enough to really care about his struggle, which is a shame. Second worst of the best picture nominees, if that matters"
YMS,2wx5zi,ThePondererTK,2,Tue Feb 24 06:19:54 2015 UTC,Which movie is the worst of the best picture nominees?
YMS,2wx5zi,TheWarOnImpalas,2,Thu Feb 26 01:25:48 2015 UTC,"I really don't care for The Theory of Everything. Eddie has a good performance, not Oscar worthy though. Everything else was meh or bad.

YMS,2wwcg7,KikoFRS,3,Mon Feb 23 18:57:03 2015 UTC,"I thought it was ok. It was fun but I'll forgot most of it, probably the only things I'll truly remember will be the church scene and Gazelle. I'm kinda disappointed that Mark Hamill wasn't the villain(his character was named after the comics main antagonist), this could be because I like Hamill and think it would be nice to see him in a main role again even if it's a villain(he plays a great villain). I guess I'll have to wait for Star Wars VII."

YMS,2wwcg7,seandan317,5,Tue Feb 24 01:14:11 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed the movie. I had 0 info on it besides the trailer. I was kind of expecting Alex Rider 2 but BOY was I wrong. The movie did what I loved- it had unexpecting twists that sadly rarely happen these days. I would write them but I dont want to spoil anything.  Funny small things in the background and brilliant script. There is one fight scene in a church that is both shot and acted amazingly. I had no idea movies from the west could pull those stuff off.  I'd give it a 7aeheh8/10
YMS,2wwcg7,PleaseCallMeSAM,0,Mon Feb 23 22:24:05 2015 UTC,"Holy crap I didn't know that movie ever got released. It looks horrible, but with a cast of surprisingly recognizable names."
YMS,2wwcg7,Volatilize,0,Mon Feb 23 23:25:02 2015 UTC,It's really terrible. I was a really big fan of the books when I was a teenager. And I dont know what I would feel towards the books today but I remember they got some pretty nice reviews. The movie is just... ughhh... why do they have to make every teenage movie a fucking teenage cliche...
YMS,2wwcg7,PleaseCallMeSAM,0,Mon Feb 23 23:46:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I read the first three or four books when I was younger, and I heard about a movie being made, but then that was it. No trailers or anything. So I assumed it got shelved, and felt a little disappointed.  But now that I see they did make something, I wish they hadn't."
YMS,2wwcg7,Volatilize,2,Mon Feb 23 23:52:45 2015 UTC,I thought it was alright. Had some great scenes and then others I thought were kinda dumb
YMS,2wwcg7,Bamres,3,Tue Feb 24 07:55:07 2015 UTC,"It's one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a very long time. The only major gripe I have with it is the blatant pointless sexism in one particular scene just purely for shock value. (you'll know which one, believe me...) Also some very obvious product placement. Otherwise it's a damn fine popcorn movie."
YMS,2wwcg7,oh-dae-su,15,Mon Feb 23 19:34:06 2015 UTC,"That 'blatant pointless sexism' was a callback to old Bond movies, which the director himself said was the reason he put it in. There was no misogynistic intent when that scene was made. Its merely the icing on the cake in terms of how much this movie references and worships old spy films."
YMS,2wwcg7,Arty6060,6,Mon Feb 23 21:37:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, the ""sex as reward"" trope is as central to the genre as the evil lairs and the doomsday countdowns. I thought the use of it here was hilarious and not nearly as demeaning as the joke could've gone."
YMS,2wwcg7,Viraus2,4,Mon Feb 23 21:43:44 2015 UTC,"Also, might be reminded that the movie had two of the most badass female characters in recent memory."
YMS,2wwcg7,EpsilonSigma,-2,Mon Feb 23 23:28:22 2015 UTC,"Of course it's a callback, but it's stilly for shock value and it obviously takes the ""trope"" a lot further than it was originally."
YMS,2wwcg7,TheRingshifter,-5,Tue Feb 24 08:54:57 2015 UTC,I have yet to see a bond film where the girl promises Bond anal specifically and where there's shot of her behind before the sexytime commences. They could have easily left it at her saying 'if you save the world i'll give you more than a kiss' and him walking in to her with the champagne afterwards. I would have had no problem with that whatsoever.
YMS,2wwcg7,oh-dae-su,4,Mon Feb 23 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"I still think the fact she has to blatantly tell Eggsy due to him not really getting what she's saying at first is pretty funny. Plus, what's to say the director can't put a funny twist to it?"
YMS,2wwcg7,Arty6060,0,Mon Feb 23 21:49:53 2015 UTC,"Well then we are on two very different wave-lengths, my friend. Like I said, I would have been perfectly fine with the scene if it wasn't for the anal bit, thought it was really unnecessary. But then opinions are opinions I guess."
YMS,2wwcg7,oh-dae-su,4,Mon Feb 23 21:53:21 2015 UTC,"So your issue is with the inclusion of the promise of anal as opposed to vaginal sex? That's a weird standard to hold. The line between ""sexist"" and ""not sexist"" isn't at anal."
YMS,2wwcg7,MyUnclesALawyer,-3,Mon Feb 23 22:21:35 2015 UTC,In my eyes it's a hell of a lot of difference between the two ways the scene could have played out. The anal bit made the princess's character seem like such a slutty bimbo. Leaving that bit out of the movie would have made the character much more graceful and believable IMO.  EDIT: spelling
YMS,2wwcg7,oh-dae-su,3,Mon Feb 23 22:28:16 2015 UTC,"I would argue that your reaction to sex-as-a-reward being misogynistic is justified, but drawing the line at anal for the sake of not making her a ""slutty bimbo"" is in itself really intense slutshaming and far more harmful of a transgression, given that the movie was intentionally lampshading and perhaps mocking the original trope."
YMS,2wwcg7,jabask,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:02:19 2015 UTC,"Like I said, this is just my opinion. That scene completely ruined the character for me, but then again many people seem to like it."
YMS,2wwcg7,oh-dae-su,4,Mon Feb 23 23:07:44 2015 UTC,"Well this movie didn't really go for ""believable"" at any stage and whether someone might prefer anal sex to vaginal sex doesn't devalue them as a human."
YMS,2wwcg7,MyUnclesALawyer,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:39:15 2015 UTC,"Like I said before, this is just my opinion. Outside of the blades-for-feet girl I thought that most of the female characters in the movie were kind of weak. Roxy was a strong character overall I guess but her crippling fear of heights made her feel so helpless. Then again you're right that the film never really goes for believability. It is of course a homage to old-school spy movies, and strong female characters weren't ever really a major theme in those things. (outside of Bond's M in recent years)"

The writing was reeeeeally predictable, background effects at times were jarring as hell, acting was off every few scenes.  However, I did enjoy the fight scenes, Gallahad's sudden death, the step-dad's crew and Samuel L. Jackson excluding the last scene. They could've left the whole reaction to blood at the reaction at the church and that would have been good. I think they just wanted to give the younger kids something at the end. So all in all, it's pretty much just a popcorn movie. 6/10"
YMS,2wwcg7,Psychic_Monkey,-7,Mon Feb 23 19:18:51 2015 UTC,This movie sucks. Please do it. I really didn't like it.
YMS,2wvxba,mardfet,17,Mon Feb 23 17:03:32 2015 UTC,"I would say The Tale of the Princess Kaguya deserved it more then the other nominees. Also the Lego Movie deserved a nomination over Big Hero 6 and How to Train Your Dragon 2. Actually I'm kinda tied over which one deserved that Oscar, The Tale of the Princess Kaguya or The Lego Movie."
YMS,2wvxba,electricninjaHEI,3,Mon Feb 23 19:36:55 2015 UTC,Song of the sea looks the most interesting to me.
YMS,2wvxba,sabljakaji,12,Mon Feb 23 21:33:14 2015 UTC,"Out of all the films nominated, How to Train Your Dragon 2 should have won. The quality of the animation was amazing, the plot was not predictable in the way most of these animated films are, and the score (while not as good as the first) was still quite good.  Big Hero 6 felt really rushed in a few places, like it took too long to set up all the pieces, so it had to knock them all down in like ten minutes. The villain was also boringly predictable. Also kinda tired of the ""character died, but didn't actually thing."" Wall-E and a few other films with non-living characters have done it. And a few that did it to living characters like Frozen."
YMS,2wvxba,PunkandCannonballer,9,Mon Feb 23 17:24:57 2015 UTC,"I definitely felt as though HTTYD2 was very predictable near the end. Every movie/TV show I've ever seen where a character has his mind controlled, he snaps out of it at the last second due to friendship/strong will or whatever. I loved the beginning of the movie for sure, seeing how far Hiccup and Toothless had come in their synergy and prowess together(and all of Hiccup's inventions were epic! I want a dragonfire lightsaber!) was beautiful. I just thought the third act's plot was uber-predictable. Also, toothless 'evolving' at the end seemed like a total cop out way for him to survive."
YMS,2wvxba,SkepticShoc,6,Mon Feb 23 18:10:39 2015 UTC,"I loved the beginning of the movie for sure, seeing how far Hiccup and Toothless had come in their synergy and prowess together   I absolutely agree with your sentiment.  HTTYD, Iron Man, Harry Potter.  Three series where the villian/quest is less fun than just watching the characters live in the awesome universe they inhabit.  I'm done seeing Iron Man movies after 3 came out as tepid as old bath water, but I'd sure as shit buy tickets to ""Tony Stark and Arm Robot Build a Shelby Cobra Kit Car""."
YMS,2wvxba,Harb67,-2,Mon Feb 23 18:49:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, but him snapping out of it wasn't handled poorly. Throughout the film he struggled against it, so it made sense when it happened. Also the Super Toothless was more a nod to Godzilla than anything else."
YMS,2wvxba,PunkandCannonballer,5,Mon Feb 23 18:58:34 2015 UTC,"eh, I thought it was handled pretty poorly. Every other dragon obeyed without question, except toothless because he's the main character. I love mind control as a plot device, but the writers need to get more creative with how to 'beat' it."
YMS,2wvxba,SkepticShoc,1 point,Mon Feb 23 19:02:41 2015 UTC,"Toothless and the rest of the dragons on Berk, because they were more socialized with people. Yeah, toothless was the only one to outright resist it, but it was a struggle, and it makes sense because Hiccup and Toothless aren't only best friends- they need each other to function."
YMS,2wvxba,PunkandCannonballer,2,Mon Feb 23 19:45:01 2015 UTC,"Also, toothless is in his own class of dragons"
YMS,2wvxba,zestyorangez,5,Tue Feb 24 19:54:29 2015 UTC,"I think the real shocker is that LEGO movie wasn't even a nomination. It beats both movies by a landslide. That said, of the list we were given I would've chosen HTTYD2 as well."
YMS,2wvxba,Arty6060,6,Mon Feb 23 18:17:22 2015 UTC,"I really disagree about HTTD2, at least in a few areas.  I loved the first movie but the second one was so lukewarm.  It felt incredibly restrained by it's target demographic.  For one example, in the final battle towards the end, that one thing stabs the other thing with it's big face things, and not a drop of blood is to be found.  I get that they're going for a rating and that a kids movie won't have much violence, but like Adam says in his Frozen review, ""kids movie"" doesn't mean it gets a free pass."
YMS,2wvxba,Harb67,1 point,Mon Feb 23 18:45:27 2015 UTC,"True, some of it was weakened by its constraints, but it still had Toothless killing Hiccup's dad, and all the dragons being mangled is something not really seen in ""kids films."" Finally I would say that any weakening to play by the ""kids film"" demographic that How to Train Your Dragon 2 was equal to that of Big Hero 6.  Also I'm so fucking thankful they didn't do the How 2 Train Your Dragon thing."
YMS,2wvxba,PunkandCannonballer,1 point,Mon Feb 23 19:01:12 2015 UTC,There were so many retarded things that movie did. It's so over hyped and overrated.

YMS,2wvxba,PunkandCannonballer,2,Tue Feb 24 02:02:31 2015 UTC,"Astrid (was somewhat relevant in the first film). Their romance was entirely minimal within the film. They shared little screen time, as their relationship had been set up in the first film and had their own shit to do. In the beginning they shared  one extended scene summing up how their relationship functions now that five years have passed. Other than that they basically cross paths, and when they do the relationship is healthy and feels normal. They had no idea how close Bludvist was to them, nor how dangerous he had really become, so the threat, while undeniable, was vague. Stoick had just found out the love of his life was not dead, so yeah, trying to win her back felt sincere. I will say that Gobber (sp?) did feel forced in most of his scenes while he was refreshingly on point in the first film. Seriously? Yes, they were surprised. Knowing there's a man who is catching dragons is one thing. They had know idea when he would show up, the degree of followers he had, nor the amount of dragons he had captured. Of course they were surprised. How should they have reacted? ""Oh, hey... Drago is here guys. 'Bout time."" Yeah, she was definitely dressing up... Or she was assembling the other dragons. When she appeared, it was with the Alpha and the other dragons in the sanctuary. Kind of clear that she was bringing the pack of them together, not just ""jacking off and making pancakes."" Not to mention that seeing Drago and his army occurred at roughly the 61 minute mark and her reappearing occurred at the 64 minute mark.    Seems to me you're being overly harsh and not very observant or willing to give the film a chance. As someone who has seen the film multiple times and quite recently, all of your gripes are not really legitimate. I suggest watching it again."
YMS,2wvxba,PunkandCannonballer,0,Wed Feb 25 09:14:01 2015 UTC,"The love interest between Hiccup and his girlfriend (so relevant I can't remember her name) at the beginning made me physically cringe in the theater. I looked at my brother and he was dead too. That killed my hype.    After the mom and the dad reunite, they sing, dance, and make fucking pancakes when they all know the antagonist dude is coming for all the dragons. I was like what the fuck are you guys doing, he's going to take all the dragons and you guys are just doing nothing.    When the dude actually came with the dragons they were all fucking surprised and I squinted so hard with my mouth open like what, you guys seriously didn't expect him to show up after you all knew.    When they were all the in the fight it was just Hiccup and his dad fighting the antagonist and fucking twenty minutes later the mom shows up all dressed up and I just started laughing my ass off. Hiccup and his dad run outside to fight off the dragons and when she shows up I realized that she was fucking playing dress-up and putting her makeup on for twenty minutes while the battle was going on. She could have prepared instead of jacking off and making pancakes.    I know it sounds like I'm hating and there's stuff I didn't mention (it's been months since I've seen it) but the ending really saves it. Wasn't expecting Toothless to teamkill the dad. And the thing where they shot the flaming arrows was pretty cool. I probably will never watch it again and try to avoid watching it at all costs because every time I watch it I'll just be laughing at the stupid shit Dreamworks did.    If there are any grammar mistakes sorry I'm not going to proof-read this."
YMS,2wvxba,Zarzuh,18,Tue Feb 24 02:55:48 2015 UTC,So boring and predictable. Didn't deserve anything and will be forgotten in time.
YMS,2wvxba,Tattered,3,Mon Feb 23 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"I thought it was good. Out of 5, I'd give it a 3 or 4."
YMS,2wvxba,evilclownmonkey,8,Mon Feb 23 17:14:55 2015 UTC,"I felt like it was directly aimed for children. The use of ""our mom died 10 year ago"" just felt unnecessary as it was never mentioned for the rest of the movie as well as ""you dropped out of school 3 years ago"". I just felt like it was forcing it in and telling the audience directly instead of doing it subtly. The humor in it wasn't exactly that funny, again seeming like it was for children under the age of like 9. Also, it was really predictable. You knew long before it was revealed that he was the villain. The ending was shit - 'let's try and make the audience upset and just deem it pointless minutes later'. The name is terrible. ""Big Hero 6"", didn't even make any sense. But people seem to like it so what do I know. I guess it just wasn't aimed for audiences like me. I'd give it like 5-6 out of 10."
YMS,2wvxba,The-Perfect-Username,4,Mon Feb 23 17:57:06 2015 UTC,It was for young kids that's for sure. Which is sad since it alienates the audience members who would be fans of the comic book unless the creators think kids are fans of a super hero team that's not well known.
YMS,2wvxba,electricninjaHEI,5,Mon Feb 23 19:48:15 2015 UTC,"Its so fucking standard. The most ""eh"" film to have won an oscar, at least in my recollection."

YMS,2wvxba,ajsatx,2,Sat Feb 28 06:32:13 2015 UTC,Well I don't think it overly explained the plot but the story was just so obvious that I was always 45 minutes ahead of it.

But I think it got a lot of things right... it had some genuinely dramatic moments IMO (where Hiro tells Baymax to kill the bad guy, the last fight, the portal area just looks sweet), in general, the animation was great. One thing I didn't like was the flying scene... seemed like it was really trying to ape HTTYD and was just boring.   But I thought it was pretty good. 6/10 IMO. I wonder when Adam walked out..."

Some of the scenes are phenomenal in it and demonstrate that Richard Linklater is an incredibly skilled writer/director. And you know what, that it was filmed over 12 years and the end product even resembles a movie, let alone such an excellent one, is a fucking miracle. But the main thing is that its an excellent movie completely independent of the fact that it took as long as it did to make. You can't discredit a movie just because some people, and perhaps the film's marketing, focus on this one aspect of the movie's production."

YMS,2wsls5,seditious_commotion,14,Sun Feb 22 21:13:57 2015 UTC,"Why is someone who's voting calling them ""Chinese fucking things""? Some of the stupidest shit I've ever heard. Winning best animation is meaningless in this day and age. There are numerous small studios that make amazing animated features, but would never, ever be considered for the sole purpose of not being American or Hayao Miyazaki."
YMS,2wsls5,RogueAngelX,5,Sun Feb 22 21:10:19 2015 UTC,Cartoon Saloon who made Song of the Sea is pretty damn small.. its also neither American or Hayao Miyazaki!
YMS,2wsls5,shtaaap,1 point,Sun Feb 22 21:16:38 2015 UTC,"It has also been nominated twice for animated features. I haven't seen either film, but it isn't exactly some small, unknown underdog studio."
YMS,2wsls5,RogueAngelX,1 point,Sun Feb 22 21:22:27 2015 UTC,"It is a small animation studio. But they were able to set up a ton of international relationships and funds. Cartoon Saloon was responsible for a lot of the pre-production and storyboarding, so this movie is their baby. But they used their funds to hire a bunch of other studios to do the grunt work on it. From the IMDB page It appears to be 4-6 studios collaborating."
YMS,2wsls5,LimeWarrior,8,Mon Feb 23 14:31:54 2015 UTC,unsurprising but still pretty bad. Kaguya is a beautiful film and deserves it.
YMS,2wsls5,Varocity,2,Sun Feb 22 22:03:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. But I was thinking about this. It's very culturally different isn't it. Personally I liked Hero 6 because it was funny and lighthearted. I loved Kaguya because it really pissed me off (in short, I guess, if you know what I mean). I'm guessing that all the other films have that lighthearted, happy ending quality? (Haven't watched all of them)."
YMS,2wsls5,eddytheflow,3,Mon Feb 23 14:39:22 2015 UTC,It's kinda scary how much impact these clueless old farts have on the film industry. Movies literally change their entire release schedule and make it so less people see their movie just to win some stupid award that doesn't mean anything from a group of people who have no idea what they're talking about.
YMS,2wsls5,mardfet,2,Mon Feb 23 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that didn't think this was bad? Obviously the guy saying ""Chinese fuckin' things"" was completely asstarded, but the rest didn't seem that bad. I mean, there were two that didn't see them and abstained, and the rest saw them all (some even saying they enjoyed Kaguya and Song of the Sea) but just voted for the obvious pick.   For the shorts, 4 hadn't seen them, which isn't that great but at least they abstained. Then the others seemed to have seen them all and only one had stupid rationale.   And OK the VFX rationale was pretty stupid all-around..."
YMS,2wsls5,TheRingshifter,12,Sun Feb 22 23:55:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty bad that they seem to go for the obvious pick though. I don't really dig the ""My kids enjoyed this movie, so I'll vote for it""-rationale. Doesn't seem like they're trying to justify why they thought the movie was the superior choice, especially by saying ""My kids watched Big Hero 6 three times, so what does that tell you?"".  I'm not surprised, I'm just slightly annoyed that it's always about which movie is the most popular and not the most well made one. Some of these voters seem to view the animated category as ""Best Kids Movie"", which is wrong."
YMS,2wsls5,Skybrush,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:25:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you about the ""watched Big Hero 6 three times"" thing, but I don't know... maybe they just genuinely enjoyed Big Hero 6 more as well? It's hard for me to say - I haven't seen Big Hero 6."
YMS,2wsls5,TheRingshifter,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:28:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely, I haven't gotten around to it either, so maybe I'll be proven wrong big time. I definitely enjoyed Boxtrolls though, more so than HTTYD2 at least.  But yeah, it's a very small sample size with short answers, but if that's the entire basis for the vote, then it's bad. I'm sure they'd explain themselves more if they had to, or maybe I'm just hoping!"
YMS,2wsls5,Skybrush,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"But the kids aren't the ones voting, are they? If the voters use that as part of their reasoning, all that does is continue the stereotype that animated movies are for kids only."

It just means they have a strong grasp on film history and that's something they may be able to draw upon to strengthen their reviews.  And no one's attention to detail is perfect. It's mainly about rewatching movies multiple times. Roger Ebert constantly made factual errors about details of the movies he discussed. Adam has some factual errors sometimes too but it isn't a big deal. Like in Jupiter Ascending you could actually see Channing Tattertot being pulled in to the spaceship he jumped on by holding on to the retracting landing gear.  But as for attention to detail that is commendable like Adam's, Rob Ager kills it with the detail analyzation."
YMS,2wr5sc,BattleChimp,15,Sun Feb 22 19:51:24 2015 UTC,"I find Mr.Pinklet reviews done by redletter media to have a lot more depth than YMS, adam is often too 'objective' in his reviews.

I don't, but plenty of people do. Another lesser known critic is GoodBadFlicks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQWazdkEpf8 here is his take on the host.

Honestly, it's more average than good, but it got some pretty good laughs out of me. I went in with low expectations, the trailer made it look like it was just gonna be references, but it had some pretty good moments. It was good at comedic timing and reactions, rather than punch lines. But it wasn't fantastic by any stretch. Honestly, probably a 6, but not a bad way to spend 13 minutes. It can get a little cringey with some jokes and performances, though. But this could just be me expecting too much considering how much I love RvB.  Rant aside, it's above average, but fun…at least from the first episode. I know that's not enough to judge the series, but it's probably enough to know what to expect going forward."

YMS,2wj9fx,sleepyrats,2,Fri Feb 20 10:17:28 2015 UTC,"I plan on seeing it again, saw it a few years ago. I remember being absolutely floored by the cinematography and camerawork. In many ways it's almost indescribable and incredibly surreal and unconventional, to the point where it feels entirely original. Gaspar Nóe has my undivided attention for future projects, based on this and ""Irreversible"" alone. I find some of the content in his film wholly unpleasant, but everything to me feels sort of wrapped in a strangely reassuring blanket of mad genius.  Upon my first viewing I wasn't quite prepared for the long running timein Enter The Void, so I will be revisiting it at some point where I am in the proper mood and with plenty of time to kill."
YMS,2wj9fx,Airlight,3,Fri Feb 20 12:05:04 2015 UTC,"I hear you on the long running time, despite it being absolutely wonderful on a technical level. Hell, I even thought the trip at the beginning could've been shorter... Not to mention Gaspar Noé basically telling people how to interpret his own film kind of brought the whole thing down in my estimation. But I do hope to watch it again at some point, because it is just so visually captivating."

What I mean is, neither of them are intended to be entertaining, they're both meant to be watched solely to appreciate the artistry. They're also both the best movies of those two filmmakers, IMO.  Noe is my favorite modern director, and I'm extremely excited for his new film ""Love""."

YMS,2we3oo,masonshr,3,Thu Feb 19 03:28:36 2015 UTC,Incredibly charming and able to range across many different emotions. Gosling gives a good performance but the writing and quirky dialogue is what keeps this movie original and worth watching.

I got so tired of seeing them in that hospital.. they did it to cut the budget so that they didn't have to film outside, same with the horrible makeup and special effects. And Maggie was prepared to do anything to find Glen,  then finds out her sister ""is just gone"" and pretty much responds with ""meh"".

He named them after himself and his wife because that's how self absorbed he is.

YMS,2vt4pg,LimeWarrior,6,Sat Feb 14 01:59:54 2015 UTC,"I wish it wasn't so incredibly self-referential. It makes sense to show Mike, but the whole ""HEY REMEMBER THAT METH KING FROM SEASON 1"" thing was a little ridiculous. What a coincidence that the identical car just happened to be connected to that character that Breaking Bad fans would recognize. What an even further coincidence that Saul found that car while he was driving along in a suburban neighborhood with no real indication as to where he should be looking for it. Some of the acting was pretty shoddy. The plot moved really slowly and there wasn't much payoff. The whole show is really ""meh"" so far. I'll only be continuing if my roomies are watching it anyway."
YMS,2vt4pg,anUnkindness,2,Fri Feb 13 22:39:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Hopefully they find a way to make the connection make sense, because right now it feels like they're shooting in the dark. That opening sequence was beautiful, though. Very reminiscent of BB."

It has a completely different story from Breaking Bad but since it has almost entirely the same crew it still has the same flow, great performance from major to bit roles, fantastic shot placements & editing. I hope the rest of the season is exciting as the second episode. Also I love the pre title scene of the first episode (won't spoil it) I hope throughout it continues."
YMS,2vt4pg,scootawhat,1 point,Sat Feb 14 18:44:27 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it. It's more serious than I was expecting. I figured it would basically be an extension of Saul's Breaking Bad role (i.e. comedy-based), but that doesn't seem to be the direction they're taking it.  There were a few wtf moments during the sequence where they were trying to scam that woman whose business Saul wants though. It seemed really convenient that there just so happened to be another car of the same type going by at the right time so they could have their little screw-up. It also seemed convenient that they managed to hitch a ride on what I can only presume was a random person's truck and somehow he/she not only brought them straight to the right house but didn't notice them. I mean what's the realistic probability of that happening?"
YMS,2vt4pg,Shyko,1 point,Sat Feb 14 00:21:23 2015 UTC,"I reckon they portrayed the old lady as someone who notices jack shit, hence why Tuco's actions never seem out of the order to her. She didn't notice, hear, two people being knocked out in her living room downstairs.

YMS,2vt4pg,jimmybrite,1 point,Sat Feb 14 02:55:45 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it but there were a few problems. Mostly the callbacks to breaking bad. Here's a list of some of them:  http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/better-call-saul-all-the-breaking-bad-references-you-might-have-missed-10044470.html  I only noticed one of them listed above, the dented metal bin, and I consciously thought of the hand drier during both it's scenes. Another callback was the shot of Saul being thrown on the desert. It reminded me of the scene with the Nazi's in BB. In both these cases I felt like the references were cheap, the turmoil Saul is going through does not compare to that Walt goes through. The inclusion of Tuco also felt a bit needless, not only do we know he's not going to die in the next 10 episodes, but it felt like star wars prequel level of coincidence.    That being said there was a lot of good, I really liked the montage where he's taking all the cases, good and interesting visual storytelling. The writing was great, there were never any moments where the dialogue felt unnatural for the purpose of telling the audience what was happening. There was some definite exposition in the scene where Saul interrupts the board meeting but it felt like he was telling the members of the board that he still saw the situation with his brother the same way he did a couple of months ago.   My favourite moment was the couple of seconds where Saul was going to walk away from the two skateboarders in the desert. I think I was geared up not to like the show so when he started walking away I immediately thought that it was a pretty cheap use of . The scene shows that Saul may not be a good man but he isn't a bad one and he cares about justice on some level. Would Walter White have stuck his neck out for two unpleasant idiots he barley knew?"

YMS,2vqqef,polarnoir,12,Fri Feb 13 06:30:08 2015 UTC,"Personally I think this does it in a different scope and this was also well before this become a clichéd intro. They aren't just cutting random news and media clips together to make some sort of statement that loosely pertains to the movie but rather it tells us about the story and a lot of back story. What's going on, characteristics of the zombies, how it's affecting the world. In a lot of ways it sets up for the rest of the movie as we see they're fast, out of control, and that no where is safe. All in all not perfect but at least this was done with the intentions of developing a little background so it didn't have to be shoehorned in later in the movie instead of some easy scapegoat."

YMS,2vq2nj,RationalRetard,3,Fri Feb 13 02:40:05 2015 UTC,"I thought that in the end, Hertzfeldt was trying to rationalize death by showing the direct contrast to it. Bill, in the end, gets to live forever and do everything he wanted, but by doing so he is unable to remember the meaning of them.  Bill wants a solid relationship, so he gets thousands of loves, but after a while he can't even remember any of them or who his first love was. He lives multiple lives, but all of them are lost in time. He obtains ultimate knowledge, but can never share it and ends up forgetting even who he is.  Bill wanted to experience traveling around in space, and instead watched each and every star go out.  In the end, Bill got what he wanted, but without deaths presence or because he will in the end out last whatever he wanted, it would be then be right to say that it would be better if Bill would die.  Bill could've died when he is supposed to, and he would've lived a short, meaningful life, with thousands of regrets and only a few short meaningful moments and accomplishments.  Or Bill could live forever and watch as all the things he ever loved lose meaning and value.  So I think Don Hertzfeldt, I'm on mobile so I can't check if it is right or not, is trying to say, ""death isn't a bad thing, instead, it encourages to go and try and accomplish some things. Find meaning. And live truly and wonderfully absurd lives."""

YMS,2vq2nj,ifyourheadexplodes,1 point,Sun Feb 15 01:43:34 2015 UTC,"To me, Bill was a metaphor for the entirety of human experience. He himself is just one character, one journey, one little sperm swimming in the existential void of reality. He becomes all things, all consciousness and love brought together in a sort of avatar, proxy to deliver us the concept in the method most accessible to ourselves as beings. One person. One life, because inargueably, that's all we get, and yet we find this deep, cognitive obsession with the lives of others, with experiences that aren't our own, to dream of swimming in seas we will never know. It's this collective, life-death paradox that keeps us wrapped up in the head of Bill the entire time, telling ourselves it's just his, possibly schizophrenic, view of the world that gives us this sparse, vignetted view, when in reality it's our own, subjective perspective that we all are wrapped up in, that gives us that viewpoint."

YMS,2vq2nj,Nezzatic,2,Fri Feb 13 04:47:50 2015 UTC,"It's such a beautiful day is fantastic, probably my favorite cartoon of all time. The way I interpretted the ending may not be reflective of your interpretation, to each is their own, but: i think a lot of people will assume that the ending was a final psychological leg given by Bill's mind to ease him into death, or perhaps he simply didn't die at all but his mental state lost the final bearings it had. Up until that point the movie fuses reality and delusion sometimes noticeably other times very subtly, and this is always possible.  I however saw it as an after-death experience, perhaps Bill's form of afterlife is being allowed to accomplish something/anything, a stark difference from his routine and pathetic life. Perhaps Bill specifically is granted the opportunity to experience all that ever was, or maybe it is a universal sub-existence all people take on once they die. Regardless, it allowed Bill to do what he had never had the chance to while constantly under the reigns of mental illness: live. And he got to experience everything one could ever hope for. Some could see is as a comforting thought, that you still have another chance, others could interpret it to be disheartening and hollow the point of life itself. I think watching it a second time would be a viable option."

YMS,2vp1am,DorksWalmart,3,Thu Feb 12 21:40:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I can speak on behalf of everyone that disliked it but I disliked it. I felt like I was watching a parody of art-house films. I don't think Xavier Dolan knows what subtlety is. Aspect ratio contracts when the characters are feeling trapped or are in a shitty situation, aspect ratio expands when they are at their happiest. Wow, what an auteur. Also I felt like they overdid the speech impediment lady, Kyla. When she is with Steven and Die she learns to open up and can speak more clearly and is more confident, but every time she comes in contact with her family members her speech impediment comes back. You can interpret this however you want but I felt like Xavier was hitting me on the head saying: The mundanity of living a life according to societal norms (marrying a safe husband, having normal kids) will restrict you as a human being but if you are surrounded by people who are 'different' or don't fall under what society considers normal (dysfunctional relationship that Die and Steven have, dropout mother who's desperately looking for a job, fucked up teenager with anger problems) then she will open up and learn more about her self etc... He's basically trying to say that regardless of whether or not these people don't fall under what societal norms due to how ""fucked up"" they might seem, they're still people and they have more of a heart than you might think at first glance.  While this is a sentiment I agree with, I think this film was about the least subtle ways to portray it. It got so corny during the ""growing up"" sequence where she envisioned her son growing up and marrying a woman and essentially becoming more and more less intimate. This causes her to realize she doesn't want to go down that path and decides to turn Steve in. He sees men coming and all of a sudden it starts raining. Like come the fuck on Xavier, learn 2 subtlety. Don't even get me started on the cringe-worthy dialogue and even more ""effin"" cringe-worthy subtitles.   I first saw a clip of this movie a while ago (the scene where he's on a skateboard listening to music, then frantically dragging a shopping cart in circles- all to some cringe inducing indie soundtrack that sounds like it'd be on a 20something year old hipster brooklynite's ipod) and I told myself, adam gave this a 9/10 this scene must make sense in context, let me go in with an open-mind. Much to my disappointment  I wasn't convinced otherwise. Seems like the kind of thing a teenager thinks is deep but then grows up to do much better work and rediscovering his old stuff and starts cringing at it thinking ""how the fuck did i think that was a good idea.""  I will say that there was one scene I did like. It's the one where Die asks Kyla to babysit Steve for the first time and he annoys the fuck out of her to the point of her losing her temper and chewing him out. I really liked that scene. Nothing bad about the performances but I did feel like the kid over-did it at times.   Please notice I didn't use the word ""pretentious"" a single time in this write up because I genuinely feel like that's the weakest argument against a movie, especially without back up.   Also someone in this thread says this film was told in a ""non-conventional"" manner. I'd like to know whats so non-conventional about it. It's a straight-forward linear narrative without any surreal elements. I'm genuinely perplexed as to why some people think this is an ""unconventional"". Is it just the aspect ratio and the way some shots looked under it?  Btw this is all coming from someone who absolutely loves arthouse movies (for the most part) and agrees with adam on nearly every review. This is probably the one I disagree with the most."

But no - Just another example of the bigger names in an industry 'biting' the work of those not in the spotlight.

It's definitely the weakest Wachowski movie there is but for me it's the perfect trifecta of hype. Original big-budget scifi Wachowski movie?   I think traditional critics are a little harsh on it. One critic called it ""the worst scifi epic of all time"" and another said ""the worst movie you will see in 2015."" I mean, at least it's original. Yeah, that's not a reason to go easy on it but at least they tried to do something other than Generic Marvel Movie #15.  I have a lot of appreciation for this movie even though it's pretty busted.  edit: Good review as always, Adam. To clarify, the big lizard guy died because Channing Tattertot closed the hole he created with his space magic earlier when he made the hole to save Mila Kunis by makin her fall through the floor."

YMS,2vapmq,Iron-Fist,11,Mon Feb 9 18:30:56 2015 UTC,Does it really count as original if you just rearrange the top 10 most boring sci fi tropes?
YMS,2vapmq,BattleChimp,5,Mon Feb 9 20:02:05 2015 UTC,You can reasonably argue that there are numerous tropes in it (and they retread way too much Matrix ground for my comfort) but I don't think you can argue that the world they built isn't original. but really when people say original in this context they mean non-sequel and non-adaptation.   The saddest thing about this movie is it will probably make studios even more hesitant to take on similarly ambitious projects.

YMS,2vapmq,MrCookieMan,1 point,Mon Feb 9 20:30:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah lots of stuff reminiscent of Dune there. Think about a movie like Oblivion, though. Technically it's original but it's nothing but other scifi stories slammed together. I don't think Jupiter Ascending was as egregious, relatively."

Obviously shitty acting is still shitty though."

YMS,2vapmq,pokapokaoka,3,Tue Feb 10 03:58:38 2015 UTC,Watching the review I'm getting vibes of Birdy the Mighty.   It has the same idea of normal every day life + other planet sci fi stuff with dog and lizard people (and other stuff). Also Birdy's feet tend to glow/spark when she is running around. Also they have the arm energy shield things.  I know the Wachowski's watch anime but I feel like they should have taken more inspiration from Birdy given how crappy this one looks.

I like the idea that the entire universe is based on harvesting genetics, and people can play with their DNA to make them look however they want. If only the movie had relatable Characters with personalities and it restrained itself with the unessescary exposition and world building.  Wasn't this supposed to start a series? There was plenty of time to reveal the world through its sequels, what Jupiter Ascending should have done was focus more on the story.  Too bad because if this movie was successful, it could have opened the door for weirder, more avant garde things to seek into the mainstream. Imagine a Jodorowsky movie being number 1 at the box office."

Yet when I was finished watching it I felt it was missing something that would make it truly great. To me it felt a little rushed near the end and was a little too neat and tidy in the conclusion. Also I think it lacked a certain Epic sweep that the kind of 70s/80s crime movies that it was influenced by had. This is kind of subjective I don't think that Abel was as corrupted as the movie would have it seem. All of his decisions were understandable pragmatic ones and It felt like the film wants you to feel like he has lost his soul by the end and I didn't feel that. 7/10"

It needs further explanation. Your post might as well have been, ""Yeah, this was bad. Discuss.""  The one-shot wasn't a gimmick because it plays into the plot. Its intention wasn't just for it to be 'cool' as you say. It's a film about theater. Live performances. Acting in the moment, one chance.The film tries to capture this element by not having dozens of edits per scene with wild angles. It's just one continuous shot with long performances, just like you would see in -- you guessed it -- a theater performance."

It doesn't tell you how Michael Keaton sees the world because the movie follows characters other than Keaton. In addition to the invisible edits that are completely obvious ones that cheat time just like a movie with normal editing.   Basically it accomplishes nothing that couldn't be done with normal long takes and transitions. Which leaves it with a one shot conceit that makes no sense, that they didn't really do but just cheated to make it look like they did (and many long takes come close to falling apart, acting-wise, so was it worth it?), and you can't even pretend it's true because there really are several instances of conventional editing anyway.

It's about how the technique has to fit the conveyance of what a film is saying.    Are you seriously saying that long-takes aren't an impressive feat in filmmaking?   They're a ghastly overrated notion of what difficult-to-do filmmaking is. Birdman may not be a lazily-made movie but there was no point in making it the way they did except to show off. Specifically to audiences trained by Alfonso Cuaron movies that long takes are the most advanced kind of cinema there is. I like Cuaron more because knows why he's doing them, but now reddit hates him so whatever. Apparently we only want our sophomoric long takes in serious art like Birdman and not action movies that actually benefit from them now.   Birdman doesn't really do anything that hasn't been done before or in a better way than it was already done. That's because there are obvious act breaks and scene transitions where the one-shot ends even though it's not a hard cut...so it's not taking place in real time, and it's just manipulating chronology and continuity the same way every other normal movie does. If the literary content of this thing was what they really wanted to do they could have made a regular movie.   Make your own movie then, because you obviously think you're Stanley Kubrick.    Spoken like someone who really believes in the message of Birdman. Whatever, go on liking it.

YMS,2v1i1r,learnhowtosmile,3,Sat Feb 7 10:00:20 2015 UTC,Balance the audio. Record in mono or something. It's weird having someone talk into one of your ears and having no response in the other.
YMS,2v1yic,Arty6060,3,Sat Feb 7 02:41:22 2015 UTC,"It doesn't come out there until next week. I thought it was alright, really weirdly paced but the action sequences made up for it. 6/10 from me."
YMS,2v1yic,GreedE,5,Sat Feb 7 04:34:41 2015 UTC,"Loved the movie. There are parts where you can see that some people won't like them; but it's an excellent movie. Some people may complain that it's too long, but there's really nothing that feels like it needs to be cut."
YMS,2v1yic,Alistair3900,3,Sat Feb 7 06:36:06 2015 UTC,"It felt perfect in terms of time for me. Definitely didn't out stay its welcome, and even some of the slower/less interesting scenes didn't drag on."
YMS,2v1yic,Antrix32,2,Sat Feb 7 10:13:01 2015 UTC,Looking forward too it. Matthew Vaughn is a great director in my opinion. His films may not be anything timeless but but they are all incredibly engaging.   Stardust may not get much recognition but its one of my favourite films.
YMS,2v1yic,spookingtonjj,1 point,Sat Feb 7 07:07:39 2015 UTC,Just saw it today. Fight choreography was excellent and was complimented by the great camera work. Great ride from start to finish
YMS,2v1yic,scootawhat,1 point,Sat Feb 7 23:26:26 2015 UTC,Based off a comic by writer of Kick Ass & I think same director. So I'd assume it'll be good if bad depending on your view on Kick Ass.

YMS,2v1yic,TheRingshifter,1 point,Sun Feb 8 08:37:36 2015 UTC,"Just watched it. Didn't think it was that good. The action scenes kind of bug me... the church one was great, but the pub one for example had some weird effects going on... speeding up and slowing down seemingly at random. It was weird. The plot was perfunctory. The jokes were hit-and-miss (though some of the hits were very good). And there was one plot point that annoyed me:  SPOILERS  Really? They didn't think once that a hack that would allow them to explode the heads of everyone working for the bad guy could be helpful? Really?"
YMS,2uzwwe,jrizos,10,Fri Feb 6 16:32:13 2015 UTC,"Side note, as an update on the video series I launched from YMS: I think I'm finally finding my own legs and my own voice, by taking a literary approach and speaking from my wealth of knowledge on this topic, which translates to film in instances like this. I'm still open to feedback and suggestions. I've worked on annunciation, audio quality, video quality, edits, transitions, and getting started quick."
YMS,2uzwwe,teerre,4,Fri Feb 6 16:34:00 2015 UTC,"Who watches reviews to decide if he/she wants to watch a movie?  That's like asking for a skewed opinion about the movie  That being said, there's some glaring errors in the editing. At 3:20 you can see the youtube thing in the lower part of the video, that's really not acceptable. The wrong resolution also bothers me a lot. Nothing wrong of not using high resolutions, but at least make the video the same size as the footage (unless it's impossible, of course). It also goes from 16:9 to 4:3 for no reason.   I won't say anything about the content, because, sincerely I don't remember Cloud Atlas at all.  Finally, I like your voice!"

Most of the time they give a pretty good perspective and gives me things to look out for. It may send me into the movie with a certain expectation, but it gives me a chance to look for and appreciate things in the movie I might have otherwise missed."

Because even though what you've pointed out isn't wrong, for me those points are reasons why I enjoyed the film so much.   But anyways, it was a straight to the point analysis and besides the aspect ratio and video/audio quality at times this was a good video. Keep it up!  Just watched your Book of Eli video. Subbed and look forward to future videos!"

YMS,2uzwwe,WordsPicturesWords,1 point,Mon Feb 9 01:16:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like you already know this, but with analysis you can take different approaches. Such as critically analyzing, coming to a conclusion as to why something is good/bad. Critical analysis is often what is favoured on YT, whereas from my film assignments they've usually asked for me not to critically analyze/give personal opinions but rather analyse and then give interpretations which can then lean towards good/bad.   That way it feels less like encouraging the viewer/reader to think in a certain way and giving them the option to decide for themselves."

And I’m unhappy with George Clooney. I had a movie that I wrote and that isn't it. I've always been involved in the process with Spike Jonze and Michel Gondry. If there’s any rewriting to do, I do it. But with Clooney it was different; even the end of the movie is different. I mean, Clooney went on forever about how my Confessions screenplay was one of the greatest scripts he’d read. But if someone truthfully felt that way they’d want the person who wrote it to be on board offering their thoughts and criticisms. But Clooney didn’t. And I think it’s a silly way to be a director.   - Charlie Kaufman"

YMS,2uh6d0,noclaf1,2,Mon Feb 2 03:49:55 2015 UTC,thanks for your input
YMS,2uh6d0,dwhee,3,Mon Feb 2 06:18:03 2015 UTC,"There are 6 episodes and the Christmas special really just seemed like they crammed a season's worth of episodes into a single one. Sorry if that's spoilers.  Like any show that presents short stories, it's hit and miss. For me personally, I loved Merits, and I loved Entire History of You, and everything else was pretty forgettable. White Bear pissed me off simply because people really seemed to have their jimmies rustled by it and seemed to forgive its glaring flaws as a result. And the Christmas special was a massive disappointment whose twist would've been completely ruined by the promotional material had it not been made obvious in the first five minutes of the episode."
YMS,2uh6d0,georgekeele,2,Mon Feb 2 03:59:21 2015 UTC,"Personally I quite liked the Christmas Special. I'll agree that it left me with a feeling of 'that was just 2 or 3 episodes at once' but I really enjoyed most of it, and it rounded off really nicely. As far as the spoiler goes I don't know what you gleaned in the first five minutes that I missed - but by the time you're at the end of the episode the twist ending is barely a twist any more - they're just leading you to the conclusion. I always think those 'twists' are quite probably designed to be discovered before the reveal."

YMS,2uekzs,maradak,2,Sun Feb 1 13:23:05 2015 UTC,"I've seen all except for the Banishment, so far The Return seems like the Tarkovsky-est. I honestly don't mind his slow transition from somewhat metaphysical and drawn-out themes to direct social commentary, because he is an expert filmmaker either way. I think I only remember one badly-looking shot in all of Leviathan.   I find it interesting how over the course of Tarkovsky's career, he became increasingly supernatural, starting at the rather straightforward Ivan's Childhood, while Zvyagintsev's career seems to develop in the opposite direction. As for Leviathan overall, I think it's brilliant. Possibly my favorite film of the year."

YMS,2udhld,wreckage88,3,Sun Feb 1 18:51:26 2015 UTC,When I saw the pilot I was really put off. I didn't find any of the characters likable at all. Few months later I gave it another shot and 3 or 4 episodes in it started to grow on me. I never really fell in love with any of the characters but I still really enjoyed it and nowadays I'd say it's one of my favorite series.
YMS,2udhld,gfxl,3,Sun Feb 1 14:14:07 2015 UTC,The Wire is the best show ever made. I'm curious about your opinion on season 2. To me season wasn't nearly as interesting season 1 and the dockworkers were not as compelling the drug dealers. What did you think?
YMS,2udhld,LancasterDodd,2,Sun Feb 1 04:15:02 2015 UTC,"I actually liked it slightly more than most of the others (Season 4 is my favorite, hands down), if only for the fact that what's killing those guys (the stranglehold death of workers unions) is recent enough that they can articulate and point their rage at something in particular. But that's more how I experienced it. Since this thread is small enough, I'd like to make the blanket recommendation to check out any speech by David Simon, the creator. Really interesting and well-spoken guy, if very angry."
YMS,2udhld,BluthiIndustries,2,Sun Feb 1 04:36:45 2015 UTC,Season 4 is my second favourite season of the wire. I just really liked the aspect of how the sabotkas were inherently good and failed at playing the game.  Which made for a really depressing season finally.
YMS,2udhld,SuperIngamer,1 point,Sun Feb 1 12:14:06 2015 UTC,I think you say that about almost all the characters. To me the Sabotkas' problems felt less important when compared to the people at the projects and also it felt like their downfall was less a matter of circumstance and (especially with Nick and Ziggy) more their own fault.
YMS,2udhld,LancasterDodd,2,Sun Feb 1 17:56:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't care for the first episode of season 2, I thought Ziggy was annoying and Nick a bit of a douche. However, I really grew on both of them. I felt sick when Frank's fate was revealed  :("

You can host them through a free storefront website like Storenvy. You could sell them on the cheap and make quite a bit of profit either way.

YMS,2u8eg7,Very_Juicy,4,Sat Jan 31 08:31:55 2015 UTC,"I thought the Oldboy remake was surprisingly alright. It's not great but I'd recommend it to the fans of the original. It falls apart in the end, it was clearly edited down a lot, but I like the final scene itself, which is different from the original movie. I also like the parts where the main character is in the prison more in the remake. Subtlety isn't Spike Lee's thing and I guess that's one of the reasons why I liked the remake. It's so over the top, so stylish and so in your face. People who pretend it's the worst thing ever haven't even seen it.  The original is not the greatest movie ever and I have no problem with the American version existing. It's not great, it's not awful. 3/5 would recommend."
YMS,2u8eg7,white_water,3,Sat Jan 31 15:09:33 2015 UTC,"The original is my favorite movie of all time and I felt the remake was ok. It definitely is far far inferior: it doesn't have as much visual story telling that the original had, or even as big of an impact. And also the ending was awful. It felt like Spike Lee was forcing emotion on us after the big reveal that is nothing to be giddy about."

The result was rather than knowing enough about the characters' motivations and struggles to get invested from the get go, you didn't care and instead got hit by all these too-little-too-late revelations.  Yeah, the reveals did make you look back at everything that came before, but it was at the expense of you being less into the events as you were experiencing them for the first time.    Haven't watched Babadook so I'm not really commenting on the validity of Adam's criticism towards that particular story, it just reminded me of this."

YMS,2u0u98,dwhee,6,Fri Jan 30 00:24:57 2015 UTC,Yeah this was one of the nit pickiest reviews Ive ever seen.
YMS,2u0u98,Johnny_Gossamer,13,Thu Jan 29 12:24:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not surprised he thought it was overhyped. If there's a comment I objected to it was his criticism of the kid's reveal of the father's death. Of course it breaks the subtlety, he's a kid!   Pausing the movie pretty much ruins the actual Babadook imagery. On a technical level the movie kind of sucks in a lot of ways, what with the stock sound effects and bad cuts. The kids' book looked good, and like Adam said, if the Babadook looked like that it would be scary."
YMS,2u0u98,Sebastheturd,9,Thu Jan 29 00:48:51 2015 UTC,"On a technical level, a lot of the shots were really cleverly placed, always blocking the audience from seeing the doorway, making them anxious of what might have come through while our vision is obscured.."
YMS,2u0u98,Tattered,5,Thu Jan 29 11:11:51 2015 UTC,I actually find the live action BabaDook to be scarier than the story book look. It has that so goofy looking that it's scary kinda vibe.
YMS,2u0u98,Bahamabanana,6,Thu Jan 29 01:08:26 2015 UTC,Damn...I really liked this movie.
YMS,2u0u98,oh-dae-su,21,Thu Jan 29 00:35:18 2015 UTC,"There's no reason not to still like it. Adam presents and argues for his criticisms well, but you don't have to agree with them, and even if you do it doesn't have to bother you as much as it bothered him. Most of the criticisms he brought forth could either be counter-argued or were small enough issues to be ignored, as with any other criticism.  I disagree with at least a fourth of the stuff Adam brings up (not just in this video, but in general), but the reason I consider myself a fan is I like his approach to movies and think he really argues his case well."
YMS,2u0u98,jakethebavarian,9,Thu Jan 29 10:41:49 2015 UTC,"And you have to stop liking it now? Adam isn't some sort of a god, this is simply one man's opinion."

YMS,2u0u98,flyfrog,5,Fri Jan 30 03:28:44 2015 UTC,"""...above average horror movie...""  Perfect description of The Babadook. It's nothing special, but it was hyped to no end by everyone and their mother. Maybe because the trailer was done pretty well? Adam also pointed out one of the film's biggest flaws, the Babadook is lame. He is so lame. The makeup is lame. The cheap costume is lame. The art made him look really creepy, and maybe if the director followed through more his previous subtlety it could have been even scary. But no. It wasn't scary. It looked like one of my friends throwing on a $10 Halloween costume. The sounds they used for him seemed like they were ripped right out of Turok. Which is even more disappointing when the I thought the voice for ""you will bring me the boy"" was so well done. Oh well.  On a side note, the kid in the movie had me in stitches the entire time. He built his own contraptions (he built a backpack catapult, that is so awesome) during the movie. He also beat the living shit out of his mom with a cricket bat in possibly one of the most unintentionally hilarious movie scenes I have ever seen."
YMS,2u0u98,greyfacenospace,3,Thu Jan 29 05:18:12 2015 UTC,"It sucks if you look at it as a horror movie. I love this movie because it's not about a monster that tries to murder a family. It's about depression, and how it's slowly turns a person insane. All the horror side of the movie is a metaphor for what's going on with her soul, and I think it was beautifully executed and original."

The cinematography is interesting, performances feel very genuine and grounded in reality, and of all the movies, ""Her"" stands out the most.  I would personally give it an 8/10, but if I used the YMS scale, I would imagine something like a 6/10, a 7 is possible but would be quite the stretch. The whole idea of having two different perspectives on the same relationship is pretty well done and kept me intrigued, but reflecting on it, I could imagine a lot of people seeing it as dull and leading to nowhere. Even though a lot of the scenes in Him and Her overlap, the cinematography is different and there are little nuances that set those scenes apart in each ""movie"".   I'm not over the moon for the movie, but I didn't mind the slower pace and did find some parts of the movie to be moving. If you've got nothing else recent on your watchlist, I'd say give it a go. But hey, no guarantees you'll love it."
YMS,2tz9bx,fagfagfaggot,2,Wed Jan 28 17:02:49 2015 UTC,"It's used in Rocky, the scene where Rocky runs up the stairs at the end of his training montage was filmed using steadicam. Apparently the director saw an almost identical shot in the footage the inventor of steadicam used to pitch the devi e to directors, a woman running up the same stairs, and thought it would be perfect.  I think it's used here to mirror the floaty feeling that comes with doing lots of intense exercise or with elation in general."
YMS,2tz9bx,we45terg,1 point,Wed Jan 28 22:38:18 2015 UTC,A film that uses steadicam shots effectively is the film Possession by Andrzej Zuwalski. It uses a lot of really intricate steadicam shots that move on a different axis than the actors and it really gives a sense of uneasiness.

I think its a pretty masterful movie (Other than that one scene with the high school kids and the sawblade) - like the dialogue and situations felt so genuine, and yes I use the word MASTERFUL because I've decided that's my favorite word to describe the film and how its put together. SO many of the scenes in the movie stand out in my memory as being incredibly investing.  Its not like this movie is really trying to be artsy. It was an experiment, yes, but even if they filmed it in one year and just used different actors, as long as they were convincing, we'd still be left with an extremely well-made movie."

I mean that's easy to say, but I realized after seeing that movie that I can't think of any other moving that had scenes that were as convincing as the ones in Boyhood (there were a couple scenes that were certainly weaker - like the goddamn SCENE WITH THE SAWBLADE) - The sequence of scenes where the alcoholic professor stepdad becomes violent and they have to leave was nothing short of amazing to me. And the day where their dad takes them to the baseball game, especially the scene in the car where he tells them he's unsatisfied with the conversations they have and he doesn't to be the biological dad that ""drives them places and buys them shit"" is amazing as well. Not every scene came together as well as those scenes, of course, and thats still pretty disappointing to me, but the fact that these amazing, enthralling, and GENUINE scenes exist in the movie demonstrate that Linklater is a very talented writer and director."

UGH. http://blip.tv/brows-held-high/brows-held-high-shame-6700054   It's horrible IMO. He complains about the singing scene... why? Because the song is too slow... what? And the running scene! It doesn't really matter that those scenes don't advance the plot - they advance the themes and, more importantly, are goddamn beautiful.   EDIT: eh he kind of goes back on himself later. I still don't like him."

YMS,2toddt,TheRingshifter,0,Mon Jan 26 09:53:48 2015 UTC,I guess later on his analysis was pretty good but watching him watch the singing scene and just saying the lyrics before she sung them was annoying as fuck.

His Melancholy review is one of the cringiest things I had to sit through."
YMS,2toddt,filmingej,2,Mon Jan 26 10:40:36 2015 UTC,"He does say that the running scene has a point and it makes a statement, and it's just that he has a distaste for those long takes."

YMS,2tlvvl,CrashRiot,9,Sun Jan 25 13:04:14 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting comparison. I rate the Raid slightly better because I think the choreography is better. But both films have great choreography and fight scenes, and a flimsy plot.   Some differences are, I think John Wick is less tense because John Wick (the man) is built up to be unstoppable before he even starts... there isn't usually much thought that he will die. Also, I think John Wick has a more manipulative-seeming plot (the whole ""wife's dog"" thing).   I like both though."

If I remember correctly, adam reviewed a newer movie by asylem and actually didn't hate it so I think it wouldnt be unlikely that he would enjoy z nation.  I like it a lot, more the the walking dead (well not including the much improved current season.) The characters are fucking awesomely done, without a doubt my favorite part of the show, but the show isn't scared to kill them off. The plot actually feels important, and honestly pretty damn interesting, even when the more fantasy-type elements start coming in later because it being a comedy and the way they present it makes suspension of disbelief easy."

YMS,2tkgq5,Tommat,1 point,Tue Jan 27 14:22:15 2015 UTC,"What gripes do you have? I honestly had no problems with the movie, aside from a few awkward dialogues in some scenes, but other than that, I left the theater happy."
YMS,2tkgq5,Tommat,2,Tue Jan 27 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"More than I can remember, but here's a summary I guess:  Spoilers ahead!   The whole car crash sequence felt way too unlikely. Okay, bus breaks down, it happens. Then he leaves his sticks at the dealership, comes back, tells Simmons ""I can use (whoevers) sticks"", which apparently he decides against two seconds later. Then the car crash looked damn serious, and he just brushes it off. Forced romance subplot that goes nowhere. I thought the scene where he approaches her was done brilliantly, felt like a real encounter. Then their date scene was the opposite imo, felt very unnatural. Then we're supposed to care when the break up, but I didn't. Then he gives up drums and doesn't contact her, despite that being what separated them, but decides to contact her once he's picked them back up? WUT At no point did the protagonist express any love or joy derived from music, just anger and pain. As a music student I completely appreciate the amount of work required to succeed, but there's still joy to be felt in music, but the film ignores that. A funny observation I made after watching is that Birdman, a story about a delusional man thinking he's a superhero, inspired me more to pick up drums than Whiplash, a film about drumming. To be honest, the main character didn't even feel human to me. I didn't care when he succeeded or failed, because he gave me no reason to. I feel like this was more a problem with the writing than the acting, though the acting wasn't amazing by him imo. The sheet music just disappearing. It would have been so easy to show some indication of what happened, but we're supposed to believe it quite literally vanished just to let the plotline progress? -.- In a movie about a musician aspiring to ""be the best"" (no such thing but lets just say there is), I feel that proper practice technique should be on display. In the film, him practicing involved playing faster than he could, resulting in blood spattering everywhere. First of all, the approach when you want to learn hard music is to slow it way down, not speed it way up! Also, most of the time his problem during rehearsal was keeping on Simmons' beat, yet no metronome is seen or heard in the film, which is the number one tool to help with that problem, but it magically fixes itself in the final scene! One scene that made no sense was when someone was out of tune, and Simmons kicks out a guy despite him not being the guy out of tune. Simmons displayed a keen ear for who ""has it"" and who doesn't, yet this guy who clearly does not have it is in the ensemble, is not new and hasn't been kicked out yet? Also, the fact that it was somebody else out of tune means you still haven't fixed your tuning problem, but apparently you care more about abusing people than improving the music you produce Simmons!   That's pretty much it. I have more problems, but they're mostly personal issues. Like that I completely abhor the philosophy glorified in the film, that music is a sport, and you must masochistically suffer in order to become the ""greatest"".  Additionally, I feel like it's common knowledge that the protagonist was basically an asshole, which I agree with, yet the audience is supposed to feel something when he fails or succeeds? Nah :/  Again, I genuinely think it's great that so many people enjoyed the film, I say more power to you, after watching the film I just thought it was pretty good, particularly impressed with J.K. Simmons. But I think it being number 30 odd on the imdb top 250 is ludicrous. That puts it above some masterpieces, like my favourite movie of all time Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  Again, I wish to emphasize that I don't mean to ""hate"" or anything, just expressing my honest opinion, feel free to express your own (or tell me why I'm wrong :P). I'm considering giving it a second viewing and see if I enjoy it more then, there's a chance it could've just been a bad day to watch it or something. Oh, and apologies for the long-winded reply, but hopefully you or anyone else can see where I'm coming from!"

You can also edit out all unwanted noises in production.  It's an interesting essay on science fiction aspects of the movie, but are you going to touch on the film itself? Like story, acting, cinematography, writing, sound, production story? Sam Rockwell was brilliant in the film and from what I know sets were all (or almost all?) practical.

The Room, Birdemic, Troll, Plan 9, Samurai Cop, Dolemite, you name it, were all made by people who had high ambition and belief in what they were doing, but ended up failing due to little knowledge and experience.

YMS,2tcwyj,ososorry,12,Fri Jan 23 02:07:04 2015 UTC,"Well i was gonna go shower but i guess no ones puts Whiplash in a corner so...   The crash is a fantastic device. It is a payoff for the setup of one of Fletcher's students dying in a ""car crash"" along with playing with the title of the film as both Andrew and the audience get whiplash from the crash. Not only that but it is a great device to show how consumed by the chance of glory Andrew is that he would risk his own health and safety to not only be a dumbass and drive wrecklessly but also try to play after the crash while being battered and bloody. Along with that, it serves as that little extra push that serves as the straw that breaks the camels back and makes Andrew attack Fletcher. Not only that, it also shows how much of a shit Fletcher is and that he does not give a shit about anything whether it be personal safety or the basic feelings of anyone (a setup for the third act with Fletcher bringing out Upswingin') Is it not obvious that another team stole it? While not entirely easy to catch, it has been shown that Andrew gets lost in his mind during periods of high stress or anxiety especially when it comes to music. At the beginning of the movie, Fletcher sneaks up on Andrew easily enough without him noticing. It's pretty obvious that another band stole the music. Along with that, this is the only way that Andrew can become first drummer and let the story progress. A ""real musical challenge"" makes no sense because theyve rehearsed hours upon hours and Fletcher wouldn't risk some bullshit like in the third act. The competitive nature is easily shown within the group because of the first drummer flipping the fuck out. The scene is not about sports. It may seem like it, but it really is not. Sports is just the medium that it works in. The dinner scene is about how obsessed Andrew is with his musical career that he is willing to be a complete asshole and ruin his relationships with his family (a setup for the payoff of breaking up with his girlfriend) As i recall, the reason they met again was because Andrew saw a sign in front of a bar saying that Fletcher was playing inside, thus piquing Andrew's curiosity.    Seeing the movie as advocating practicing is like seeing the dinner scene as only bringing up the topic of recognition within the musical industry. Yes, it is there, but that is just surface level. There are in my mind two ways to interpret the ending as it is an ironic ending. Success occurs when one throws oneself without abandon into their passion OR failure occurs when one is consumed by their passion. I personally prefer the second interpretation as it makes more sense with his ex finding someone else, the Upsingin' incident, and it also makes Andrew a very tragic character as he becomes the one thing he hates most: Fletcher. Not only that but Fletcher not doing a total 180 would be completely disingenuous to his character. He is very smart and very much an asshole. The whole turn is setup plenty of times throughout the movie (my favorite being when he is talking to an 8 year old all cutesy and then calls his musicians ""cocksuckers"") In my mind, it is pretty obvious that Andrew told on Fletcher considering he attacked him on stage.  The one thing that honestly really gets me about your point is ""hammering the drums"". I walked out of the theater and had a discussion about it with some friends who thought most of the improvisation was just random bullshit. Im sure you can look up analysis of the whole entire piece that will show you that it's not random bullshit. There is most definitely a rhythm and meaning to every single note. And ""i have freinds and acquaintances who were/are very good musicians so I don't speak without any lack of knowledge"" is similar to saying ""I have some asian friends so I know mandarin"". I get what you're saying and where you're coming from, but you are way off base. Having a strong structured background absolutely helps with improvisation. Think of it like talking: studying words on their own (definitions, pronunciation, etc.) isn't directly related to speech but knowing them gives you the tools to speak. In terms of a house: once you have the foundation down, you can do whatever the hell you want. And considering Andrew's background of playing the drums for many years, it's not too far of a stretch that he either a) came up with this improvisation years ago or b) he just made it up thanks to his plethora of practice and experience. Also, as said about the dinner scene and car crash, the final showdown is not just about him being good at playing the drums... It is Andrew becoming Fletcher. You'll notice that Andrew has a small white tissue square in his jacket pocket when ""playing"" Upswingin' but then throws it off stage when coming back for Caravan thereby making him all black. This is Andrew losing the last glimmer of purity that he had and his descent into darkness. Again, he becomes Fletcher. The newness of the band to him does not matter because Fletcher is constantly switching out people with his band and demanding perfection from them. Not only that, but Fletcher helps Andrew with the rest of the band by conducting them around his improvisation so that he doesnt look like an incompetent conductor. When Andrew barks ""go on my cue"" to the bassist, who does that sound like? Fletcher. When he smashes the cymbal right in Fletchers face what does that remind us of? Fletcher throwing a chair at Andrew's face.  The showdown isn't about music. It isn't about jazz. It isn't about practice or achievement. The showdown is brilliant because at the beginning Andrew is dressed in pure white and by the end he is in pitch black. The showdown is brilliant because he becomes the one he hates most: Fletcher. The showdown is brilliant because he reaches his goal of becoming great yet he fails his goal of being loved. The showdown is brilliant.   I used to be really annoyed by the problem that ""the movie wasn't what i expected therefore it's not as good"" but the one thing you need to do is simply go into every movie with 0 expectations and you will find it in its purist form with no biases.  I agree with you that some egocentric musicians wouldn't want to practice with each other but it certainly isn't needed. The point is already made with everyone being extremely toxic towards each other when not playing.  The third act is well structured and well made. My only gripe about it is that Upswingin' is not setup in any of the other acts. Also, how does JK Simmons playing J Jonah Julliard seem dull to you? Or perhaps you meant as a character he is not well made. A musical instructor/conductor who pushes his students so hard that they kill themselves because he wants to make one of the greats, yet fails in doing so because of his methods is certainly not dull. And Andrew? A boy who aspires to be one of the great Jazz musicians so much that his hands bleed, he risks his life and his education along with his career, and goes from an innocent young boy into a heartless son of a bitch is definitely not dull.   Am i being an asshole in this comment? I don't know. I probably came off that way. Didn't mean to."
YMS,2tcwyj,Varocity,2,Fri Jan 23 07:28:05 2015 UTC,"First off, thanks for your indepth comment and you certainly didn't come off as an asshole to me.  Let me try to be clear, because I think I might not have been.   The crash is a fantastic device. It is a payoff for the setup of one of Fletcher's students dying in a ""car crash"" along with playing with the title of the film as both Andrew and the audience get whiplash from the crash. Not only that but it is a great device to show how consumed by the chance of glory Andrew is that he would risk his own health and safety to not only be a dumbass and drive wrecklessly but also try to play after the crash while being battered and bloody.   You give good reasons and I don't necessarly disagree, but I still think it's somehow cheap to create this car crash in order to raise the stakes. Yes it shows how reckless Andrew has become and how obsessed, but isn't there a better way to integrate this?   Is it not obvious that another team stole it? While not entirely easy to catch, it has been shown that Andrew gets lost in his mind during periods of high stress or anxiety especially when it comes to music. At the beginning of the movie, Fletcher sneaks up on Andrew easily enough without him noticing. It's pretty obvious that another band stole the music.    If you as a filmmaker don't show something happen, it's open to interpretation. It's either that it has been stolen or that Andrew only thinks that he left it there and infact has lost it somewhere else. You see where he left the notebook, but this might not actually be the reality, but only Andrew's memory. If you are ambigious about it, nothing is obvious. Additionnally we never really see much of Andrew's and Fletcher's real competition, only the competition inside the group, which makes another missed opportunity imo. At this point you could have shown alternatives to Fletcher's way of doing things.   Along with that, this is the only way that Andrew can become first drummer and let the story progress.    I feel these shortcuts damage the movie more than they help. Andrew could have easily beat his competitors in practice and be rewarded that spot for his extraordinary practice.   A ""real musical challenge"" makes no sense because theyve rehearsed hours upon hours and Fletcher wouldn't risk some bullshit like in the third act. The competitive nature is easily shown within the group because of the first drummer flipping the fuck out.   It could have been used to show that this hyper agressive competitive style has some intrinsic dangers. That students will try to sabotage each other to get that spot. Could have been more interesting, instead we see a very straightforward example of ""The end justifies the means."" Rather than explore this approach we have to endure how serious the movie treats this philosophy despite a lot of backlash.    The scene is not about sports. It may seem like it, but it really is not. Sports is just the medium that it works in. The dinner scene is about how obsessed Andrew is with his musical career that he is willing to be a complete asshole and ruin his relationships with his family (a setup for the payoff of breaking up with his girlfriend)   I think so too. But why can't it be both? The presentation of all that physical practice witht the loss of blood seems so over the top to me that this reference isn't only marginal. The breakup with his girlfriend came somewhat expected, the fact that she didn't do anything damaging to him yet shows how obsessed Andrew was.     Seeing the movie as advocating practicing is like seeing the dinner scene as only bringing up the topic of recognition within the musical industry. Yes, it is there, but that is just surface level.     Well I wanted the movie to go that route but it didn't. For me personally it would have been a more interesting movie.     There are in my mind two ways to interpret the ending as it is an ironic ending. Success occurs when one throws oneself without abandon into their passion OR failure occurs when one is consumed by their passion. I personally prefer the second interpretation as it makes more sense with his ex finding someone else, the Upsingin' incident, and it also makes Andrew a very tragic character as he becomes the one thing he hates most: Fletcher.

For one thing I believe that Andrew isn't only hating him (not that you claim he does), but he also admires him in a big way. Other than that, interesting point. Although I think it's a bit of a stretch because we don't get to see that much and you don't have much of a choice given Andrew's situation. On top of this I see Fletcher seeing himself as someone who needs to be there to create great musicians. You don't have to become Fletcher, you become a great musician by being pushed by him. His role is one of a coach. Fletcher isn't a great musician himself. He's only the teacher.   2.The one thing that honestly really gets me about your point is ""hammering the drums"". I walked out of the theater and had a discussion about it with some friends who thought most of the improvisation was just random bullshit. Im sure you can look up analysis of the whole entire piece that will show you that it's not random bullshit. There is most definitely a rhythm and meaning to every single note.

I get what you're saying and where you're coming from, but you are way off base.    So this is more about the whole practice in general. Locked into a room you can only get you so far. We see him playing and acquirring the skills necessary to play the difficult parts. We can see him listen to many other interpretations of great musicians. That's it. I can only speak from my own experience and the ones that have been shared with me obviously, so that was more of a disclaimer than anything else. I don't speak with much authority on this. But it still doesn't make a lot of sense to me to show Andrew only practicing in the way he did. I believe that there is much more to it. Especially if you visit the country's most acclaimed school for music.   Here's an interesting artice which also expresses some of my own concerns. New Yorker.   Having a strong structured background absolutely helps with improvisation. Think of it like talking: studying words on their own (definitions, pronunciation, etc.) isn't directly related to speech but knowing them gives you the tools to speak.

Also, as said about the dinner scene and car crash, the final showdown is not just about him being good at playing the drums...   I don't believe I have argued against this notion. My point was that if he acquirred all those skills why not show him actually acquirring them? Maybe I wasn't clear. This is one of my biggest complaints. Why show melodrama about contrived plot shortcuts, rather than the real deal?   It is Andrew becoming Fletcher. You'll notice that Andrew has a small white tissue square in his jacket pocket when ""playing"" Upswingin' but then throws it off stage when coming back for Caravan thereby making him all black. This is Andrew losing the last glimmer of purity that he had and his descent into darkness. Again, he becomes Fletcher.

The showdown is brilliant because he reaches his goal of becoming great yet he fails his goal of being loved. The showdown is brilliant.   And that's why I don't like the movie all that much. The music only serves as a vehicle to tell this very dull Andrew vs Fletcher story. If you forget the music for a second this becomes a really simple story about a father-son or teacher-student relationship which isn't all that interesting because it isn't fleshed out enough.  Mix that with ""The end justifies the means."" and you got yourself WHIPLASH."

I try to do it, but I think it's fair to say this is just impossible to achieve every time. I don't want to waste my time which one reason I read a fair amount of critics to avoid the real trainwrecks. Other than that I take a fair chance of risk which I think you have to take if you are interested in a great variety of films. I don't even dislike the movie very much and I did enjoy many parts, but I also found myself wanting more than what I  got. And that's also a reason why I couldn't understand the hype around this movie. I thought I missed something big, but thanks for your time anyway. I didn't even read that much about WHIPLASH, the only expectations I had was that the performances were great and this movie was great which isn't really that much of an expectation. I don't want to ruin this movie for anyone, I just want to understand what others are seeing in it.   I think my criticsm is mostly fair, although not presented in the most fair or comprehensible fashion, but this is the YMS subreddit and although Adam often times has very good reasons to critique something, sometimes the claims stay on their own and I don't think it's that too bad either.  For many people nowadays '0 expectations' seems too much of an excuse to me. If you really stand behind this statement wouldn't there be any bad movies? All you had to do would be not having any expectations whatsoever? Whenever you see a movie and feel like with only slight changes it would have made a greater experience, more interesting more thoughtful, more reflective, why would that be a mistake?  When I saw Gravity and was let down by because I thought it was dealing with themes of hopelessness and despair of certain death which are more interesting to me to think about than to think about nothing and try to enjoy a rather dull action movie with stunning visuals. It's obviously subjective, but this 0 expectation approach shouldn't be saving movies from your own critique.   Also, how does JK Simmons playing J Jonah Julliard seem dull to you? Or perhaps you meant as a character he is not well made. A musical instructor/conductor who pushes his students so hard that they kill themselves because he wants to make one of the greats, yet fails in doing so because of his methods is certainly not dull.   Well I didn't believe this character to be a real person. He's seem so much of an archetype that I couldn't really immerse into the movie. Concerning the performances. They're pretty good, but I feel these characters lack the depth that really makes an astounding performance. Both characters are very extreme and one-way streets in a way. I don't think being demeaning and cursing really gets the best out of people. For every one of thousands people you motivate to become a great musician you demotivate many others to give up right away. If you don't buy into this concept at all, this movie makes it really hard for you, because possible disadvantages in success concerning music alone weren't shown at all. The real disadvantages only lie outside of the realm of music which makes a very uninteresting theme of ""you have to sacrifice anything other than music to suceed in music"". I don't believe this to be true for one second which is most likely one reason I wasn't able to enjoy the movie that much.   And Andrew? A boy who aspires to be one of the great Jazz musicians so much that his hands bleed, he risks his life and his education along with his career, and goes from an innocent young boy into a heartless son of a bitch is definitely not dull.    Like JK Simmons' character I really didn't feel a real connection there. Andrew's character could be described pretty spot on in a few sentences without missing too much. You did a fine job yourself by doing so. There isn't much of a transformation. He's a maniac almost right from the start. We don't get a whole lot of development. The bit we get appears gradually, which I like, but it just wasn't enough for my taste.  Edit: paragraphs and typos."

YMS,2tcwyj,maradak,2,Fri Jan 23 02:30:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with a lot of your points, for me this film was pretty awful and I don't really get how people are rating it so highly. The entire film felt like it was built solely for the third act, which was good but it didn't mean the rest of the movie could be a contrived pile of shit because you have a decent finale. Take a film like Apocalypse Now (and no, I don't think it's out of place to relate this film here given the praise Whiplash has received), the scene where they're sat around a table eating food and talking about Kurtz and they play the tape of him, that scene is relatively simple but says and does so much, or any other scene early on in that movie, they're amazing scenes in and of themselves that are subtle, sometimes brash, and have depth but all add to the inevitable crescendo without undermining it, you can't say the same for Whiplash.   Also Fletcher's and Andrew's characters seem really dull to me.    Yeah, I hated the moment it showed Fletcher being nice to that child, it felt so contrived and hamfisted, there were a lot of scenes like that where it felt the film was treating the audience like it was stupid ""hey look guys, he's being nice to a small child, he's got a heart really, see . . ."" this kind of thing is so lazy and sloppy and insulting.  The dinner table scene shows how the writer can't write dialogue for shit, holy crap that scene was horrible and it's no wonder the third act basically contains no dialogue and is the best part of the film. The scenes with Andrew's love interest were horrendously laboured as well, was George Lucas writing this shit or something?  The cinema scene with Andrew and his dad reminded me of something out of a soap opera, particularly how in soap operas if they're in a nightclub the music is always low and you can hear the characters perfectly.  Fletcher's character to me was just a cunt, which is fine, but they tried to make him some likable cunt by having the child scene and giving him a dubious philosophy about Charlie Parker, they wanted to have it both ways and this lack of conviction was its downfall imo."

I agree. Also the part when Andrew and Fletcher meet again at the bar. Fletcher said something about he would only do so because he really necessary to do so to foster real talent. This actually might be only Fletcher deceiving Andrew, but we don't know for sure if it's genuine, because at that point Fletcher probably already knows that Andrew was responsible for his[Fletcher] dismissal. Another example is the message that one of his protégés has been killed. Replace some of these scenes with a more nuanced approach and it would have been fine.  Instead we only get extreme anger or extreme despair and sadness. Only the ends of the spectrum. One part which could have somewhat saved it for me was when Andrew kind of gave up and was in a limbo. If the movie would have taken more time to shine some more light on his defeat and how he deals with it, the movie wouldn't feel as rushed and forced to me. It feels like this movie was started with these ideas of very 'tough' practice sessions and the screaming and the competitions and everything else was just filler."

Yeah, this bit was kind of odd because on the one hand we kind of know that Fletcher knows it was Andrew who got him fired but the film still tries to rationalise Fletcher with his philosophy, which as you said could have just been him being deceptive, a deception that would fit with his character tbh, so it kind of undermines his philosophy.

This is the way I felt about it, there was a good movie in there but it needed more subtly and care given to the other scenes of the movie to make it work."
YMS,2tcwyj,le_sweetie_man,2,Sat Jan 24 16:21:25 2015 UTC,"Er, it didn't bother, but I am surprised that you surprised Adam liked this movie so much - I think there are many films in his recommendation videos that would fall apart with closer analysis (I loved Hunt, but there is no denying that it is a bit formulaic and follows tropes of the genre). I actually liked Whiplash even somewhat better than Birdman, because of how tense it was: it had some great and memorable emotionally tense scenes. When Simmons character talked to a girl I actually didn't think movie was trying to show that he has a heart, I thought he was just putting on a nice face for friends daughter.   The main question that movie is trying to answer is if Fletcher's methods of teaching justified the ends, but I don't think it gave clear cut answer. I myself a musician and an artist so this theme is very familiar to me. When he was practicing to play it also bothered me, but there are different kind of musicians that pursue different goals: creative or technical. I thought the whole meaning behind the band was to become really good with techniques and being able to play other peoples music."
YMS,2tcwyj,Nimitz14,1 point,Sun Jan 25 11:20:06 2015 UTC,"Well I haven't seen the hunt yet, but I don't get that feeling too often. He referred to the director's other movie 'Grand Piano' as a guilty pleasure, so I suspect he might like the music a lot. It doesn't really matter to me personally that much, but I just didn't get the hype and wondered if I missed anything, but I suspected that people would like the suspense, which I really didn't feel, because I didn't take it seriously.  It's not the jazz music I like, but you're right. The pieces presented felt like show pieces to me. Only there to express your mechanical skills. It fits with the rest of the movie though. And it does make for a more exciting movie I guess."
YMS,2tcwyj,TheRingshifter,2,Sun Jan 25 21:35:21 2015 UTC,I think this review explains pretty well why a lot of people liked Whiplash.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRiTupw20Z8
YMS,2tcwyj,Nimitz14,1 point,Mon Jan 26 08:36:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah thanks for sharing. I agree it captures many reasons why people enjoy it, but I also disagree with some points very much.   1:15: For me the one scene when Fletcher talks to Andrew after playing at the bar simply doesn't cut it. We get one more scene when Fletcher is shocked and saddened about one of his successful former students and that's it.   One of the comparison people make is Fletcher to Sergeant Hartman and here's the difference between WHIPLASH and TRUE METAL JACKET. One treats these 'cartoony characters' with respect and admiration and hate, the other one treats the subject with a dark twisted irony. In WHIPLASH I was sitting in my seat feeling that these insults were just ridiculous and rolling my eyes how one could take them seriously. Let alone the characters of WHIPLASH. I didn't find most of them funny either. Either you take them seriously and you feel the threat or you don't. But they see something in Fletcher I don't. Some sense of greatness which isn't ever shown once. All characters treat him like a legend right from the start and I don't know why. And the movie plays it straight.   How treats Kubrick Sergeant Hart? Or how does the scene work? See for yourself. Youtube.  The Youtuber explains it very well when he says(paraphrasing) 'Whiplash plays it like a sports movie more than a film about music. It shows the physical demands Andrew has to go through to reach what he deems satisfactory and it's so extreme and it's like witnessing an athlete training for an Olympic event. The plot isn't about the journey to fame, it's not the rags to riches story, it's about our main character becoming the object of best'. And this simply isn't as engaging to me. Mainly because it fails on other aspects of the story which are there to support it. But I hope to see what many of you saw when watching it for a second time, maybe when it appears on ~Blue-ray~!"

YMS,2t6r64,w3aksauce3,1 point,Wed Jan 21 19:09:34 2015 UTC,"I think American Sniper tried to dance around the issue of PTSD but didn't exclude it either.  There's been issues with how accurate Chris Kyle's autobiography was, not just the Jesse Ventura story but also with his time in Iraq although the movie already took liberties with the source material anyway.  The movie definitely tried to gloss over the Iraq War's details but it wasn't bullshit patriotism although the movie's digs at the Marine who doubted the mission were underhanded.  My biggest issue was with the pacing and turning the guy into a military Horatio Caine where he was doing several MOS at once instead of giving you a real picture of the nitty gritty."

YMS,2t53sc,Peyto,3,Wed Jan 21 12:30:06 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS  I thought it was a beautiful movie. I thought it was incredibly well written and Hertzfeldt did a great job with the narration, I loved the score, I loved all the strange ways it was animated and then how it incorporated real world imagery into it. I thought the humor was really effective and the characters were are really interesting, and I liked how much he focused on tiny, idiosyncratic details. I thought it was a strong representation of our fear of death and kind of secret deep down personal deceit that we're immortal and we will live lives like the one Bill is described to have at the end, full of love and adventure that lasts forever and forever and then beyond that. We know this won't be true but a lot of the time we act like it will be. It isn't for everybody but really almost everything about it spoke to me because I focus on a lot of those aspects of people and life a lot too, the tiny details and the day-to-day ignoring of death and all that. I really loved it, it's one of my favorite animated movies."
