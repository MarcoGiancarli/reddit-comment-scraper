gayyoungold,3e2cuf,tigerwalks,8,Tue Jul 21 12:37:30 2015 UTC,"It's a bit scary, but you'll have to make the first move.    Older guys tend not to hit on younger guys because they don't want to make them uncomfortable or be perceived as some ancient perv.    But the complicating factor is that older guys are going to be wary of advances from younger guys because they have most likely been burnt before and think it might be some kind of scam - so you will have to be convincingly genuine."
gayyoungold,3e2cuf,darknessvisible,5,Tue Jul 21 14:06:20 2015 UTC,"depends on the venue but in general, chat with him and ask questions about him - most people like to talk about themselves. it's also a good way to see if he is interested, has a partner, etc. if you are just looking for sex, be honest about it. if you are hoping for more, be honest about that too."
gayyoungold,3e2cuf,PirateCodingMonkey,4,Tue Jul 21 14:00:49 2015 UTC,"Personally, I get interested if a younger guy starts small talk, expresses an interest in similar activities or lifestyles, then talks about coming to visit.  It will work with me, and if there's no interest I'll be less forthcoming with small talk or info."
gayyoungold,3e2cuf,FriesBaconNaked501,2,Tue Jul 21 12:50:01 2015 UTC,"For starters, to see if they're interested, eye contact is huge, maybe a smile or a subtle nod. Remember that before apps and online dating there was only in-person cruising, so older guys know how to take hints. If you do get a connection, treat him like any other guy you're interested in. Act interested, you can make compliments, etc. From my experience, older men also like younger guys who are mature and can hold a conversation. It can make them less uneasy about the age gap. Good luck"
gayyoungold,3e2cuf,SFyoungerguy,4,Tue Jul 21 18:05:55 2015 UTC,Start talking about sex and rubbing your crotch.  That gives a strong signal.
gayyoungold,3e2cuf,willilikeit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:09:59 2015 UTC,"Eye contact... I've found looking and staring, or noticing frequently tends to get there attention... almost every time. (not creepy stalker staring) Obviously you have to make sure they're gay, or interested, but in person, eye contact-once you're both staring just go up and say hi, if he's kind of an asshole he might've just wondered why you were creepy staring and I'd take it as he's not interested. If you're online, grindr and craigslist is huge for older people."
gayyoungold,3e0djn,lrivera095,3,Tue Jul 21 00:03:00 2015 UTC,"It's not very good. The main character is kind of a tool, the ""message"" of the film is pretty repulsive (to me, at least), and they couldn't even be bothered to make up for the monumental flaws in the movie by having any hot sexy scenes!  Heh.   I'd say skip it, but if you're also a masochist in addition to being a fan of older/younger relationships, maybe you'll enjoy it!"

gayyoungold,3dvk1c,dreezius,5,Sun Jul 19 21:56:16 2015 UTC,"So a while back, I made a post here with a slideshow video with my boyfriend from London when he came here (Texas) to visit me. Now this is us, at 6 months together - me visiting him in London. I went for 20 days; first time on a plane, away on my own, had an awesome experience. Sadly, we are no longer together, he decided a long distance relationship is not ideal for him and I respect that. We have become best friends though and lived it up while we were together. This video is my experience with him, we made one hell of a couple. Cheers everyone."
gayyoungold,3dvk1c,jh89th,2,Sun Jul 19 21:57:02 2015 UTC,sorry it did not work out; being across the pond is not ideal. My partner used to live 1hr 30mins from me which I thought was too far!

gayyoungold,3dx2jz,YoungerGen95,3,Mon Jul 20 06:31:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a lot like your friend, so let me give you my perspective.  First, about the phone.  Don't discount that issue.  For those of us of a certain age it's hard enough to text even with the latest and greatest smartphones.  With an older model phone it's even more frustrating.  Keep in mind that this is something you grew up with, but for us it will never come naturally.  To be honest, the whole idea of carrying on a meaningful conversation via one sentence or shorter texts seems kind of lame to me.  But here's the other thing I want to say.  I also have a younger friend that I rarely initiate messages with.  The reason is that I know he has a lot of friends his own age as well as school and work that keep him very busy.  My fear is that if I send him that first text I will be interrupting his day.  Maybe that seems irrational to you, but I know him well enough to know that he always drops what he is doing when his phone beeps and feels guilty if he can't respond right away.  I'm busy too, but I prefer to treat text messages like email that is meant to be read and replied to at my leisure.  So I suppose that is an age thing.  Obviously I'm not him, so it's your call, but I hate so see you give up on him prematurely."
gayyoungold,3dx2jz,MellowDad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:04:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly! That's why I don't blame him for not wanting to constantly text me back. As he told me, I'm the only one he texts and this is all very new to him. I would much rather call him over the phone but he tends to be busy most of the time so I text him out of convenience.   I make an effort to reply right away and if I can't, then I let him know that I was busy when he sent the text. He always encourages me to send him emails as well and he reads them but he can't reply to them right away because he doesn't have a computer at home.    I'm busy too, but I prefer to treat text messages like email that is meant to be read and replied to at my leisure.   I'm thinking he is the same way and he's not necessarily trying to ignore me but rather just takes his time to reply.   I really do not want to give up on him. He means a lot to me and I feel like giving up on him because of this small issue would be a mistake. I should be thankful that he has stepped out of his comfort zone and began texting me in the first place."
gayyoungold,3dx2jz,FL4Polar,2,Tue Jul 21 08:23:27 2015 UTC,"If it were me I would stop texting him/initiating the conversations. Friendships and relationships are a two-way street and he should put in some effort. If he wants to text you he will - if not, then at least you know."
gayyoungold,3dx2jz,OhDear3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:08:27 2015 UTC,"True, I decided I won't be initiating the conversations for now. He only seems to text me after I haven't texted him for a few days..."
gayyoungold,3dx2jz,hairybearlover,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:44:11 2015 UTC,"It can be that it's hard to text for him and so on, but in my opinion you deserve someone who cares about you more than to let you initiate every conversation. It's up to you whether you want to stop, maybe give him a call, see how you both like that, but I wouldn't put much hope in this one. As you said you can just stop texting and see if he contacts you, it can go either way. Good luck to you."
gayyoungold,3dx2jz,hairybearlover,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:39:49 2015 UTC,I really do care for him but it gets frustrating when sometimes it seems like I'm the only one interested. I'll stop texting him for the time being. Thank you.
gayyoungold,3dx2jz,hairybearlover,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:45:30 2015 UTC,"It's kind of hard to say. Without knowing his personality, it is not that fair for us to judge him. He could be a shy person that is more submissive and would rather be quite until spoken to. Or he could be the exact opposite and is blowing you off until you start the conversation.   If he is someone more reserved, then perhaps jumping to the conclusion that he is not interested in you may be a bit too hasty. Other things play a factor too, is he openly gay? Is he an active person that is out and about on his own a lot? Is he quite or more of a loner? It's a bit harsh to judge him based on the little bit of information you gave about him.   If he is someone that is active and such, then perhaps you should hold back on texting him and see if he will start being more active in starting the conversations. But only you can really tell if that is the case.  Overall if you are really unsure of his interests in you then perhaps just asking him flat out may be a good idea so you are not wasting your time chasing after something that has no interest in you."
gayyoungold,3dx2jz,hairybearlover,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:23 2015 UTC,"He's an openly gay man and can be very busy at times. He's not necessarily out and about all the time but he seems to be a lot more busy now. He's definitely more reserved and I'm the only person that he ever texts.   I stopped texting him once and then he began to start texting me first. Of course, that didn't last long...  Honestly, I cherish the friendship that I have with him but sometimes I wonder. Should I just move on?   Anyway, thanks for the reply."
gayyoungold,3dx2jz,TProphet69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:13 2015 UTC,Perhaps just ask him if he feels like there is something more or if he wants to move into a more serious relationship then. If you are unsure then he is definitely not communicating enough to you if he is or isn't interested for something more then the occasional 'hey whats up'.

gayyoungold,3dovws,Wheresdaddy,2,Sat Jul 18 01:20:32 2015 UTC,"Some years ago I had a young friend who lived about 20 miles from me.  I didn't mind at all driving to see him.  If it was a date for dinner or a movie or such we would stay in his area.  If we wanted ""private"" time together I would drive us back to my place.  A few hours later I would make the round trip again to take him home where he lived with his parents.  It did grow tiresome I will admit, but I did it for him.  So don't hesitate to contact a daddy type thinking he would never do the same for you.  All you have to do is ask.  edit, adding this:  Don't think that because someone drives that far to meet you the first time that you will be obligated to do anything you don't want to do after you meet him in person.   For that matter the same goes for him.  Expectations can run high on both sides until reality hits.  Make you sure you are both clear about that before you meet."
gayyoungold,3dovws,MellowDad,2,Sat Jul 18 15:55:35 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  If I found a younger man that I genuinely liked, 20 miles is nothing.  I've driven farther for less."

It was never in their interest to be anything more serious.   I resorted to meeting people online. Which is where I met my current partner of two years.

All of Europe is more at ease with showing affection and being more 'touchy' between men than in the US (I'm assuming you are based in the US). I never felt any negative vibe from anyone. Honestly, it's hard to tell who is gay and who isn't since everyone is amazingly 'spirited' haha...and not worried about what others are thinking about them.    While I didn't see a lot of gay men holding hands in public (everyone is too busy giving kisses to say 'hi' and 'bye'! haha), I don't think you'd have any trouble. Just like anywhere in the US, there are areas that you might be more conservative / careful....especially at night in some of the more 'off beat' areas....  One word of advice, be careful not to trip and fall while you are staring at all the AMAZINGLY attractive men!! Have fun!!"

I would be a little discreet about holding hands but you shouldn't have to hide your relationship. It's just a little more conservative than the other parts of Europe because the Vatican is situated there.  If you haven't booked any tour guides or whatnot, I STRONGLY recommend the company Rome In Limo. They had a driver shuttle us around in a Mercedes Benz minivan and we booked a guide through them for the Vatican museum and it was just amazing to have our own personal tour guide plus we got to cut through the lines."

Older people may look at you two and try to figure out what's going on but nothing more. I think nobody will directly ask you about your relationship. If they do and you tell them the truth the worst case scenario is that they will find the whole thing strange and tell you (especially older people). Remember that the city center tend to be much more tolerant.  I can't tell you about gay places or areas (there are many gay bars but I'm not much into Gay bars, sorry!).  Hope you will enjoy your stay :)"
gayyoungold,3dnaf6,_heyitsme_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:36:47 2015 UTC,"I visited both Florence and Rome last year.  Of the two cities, I like Florence a lot more.   Florence is pretty hilly. Be sure you're both in good enough shape for it! It's worth spending more time there than Rome. The air is cleaner, less traffic, and it's generally slower paced.   I didn't enjoy Rome as much. It's interesting to visit, but there is a lot of traffic--you're constantly dodging cars. Also, it's very spread out (Florence is more concentrated) so you'll spend a lot more in transit and will see less stuff.  Gay places - honestly you can do ""gay stuff"" anywhere in the world and it's largely all the same. Why bother? Just spend time soaking in the local Italian culture. Lots of really interesting stuff to see and do.  With that big of an age difference, whether gay or not, you're going to raise eyebrows making out in public anywhere in the world. If you're just holding hands people will probably assume you're from southern Europe and he's your grandfather. Normal for families and friends to hold hands, doesn't really mean anything (although it's much more common for women to do so)."

Either way it is very unprofessional especially for his line of work. That could be EXTREMELY damaging to someone that is in a very vulnerable state.  If you are looking at it as something you would be interested in pursuing, think about this.. if he was that immediate to start flirting with you, how many other people has he done that to? Let alone how many more people is he going to keep doing it to? What's to say you two land up in a relationship and hes not at work basically cheating on you every day.   I would steer clear of the situation entirely, have him mail the papers (I would not give him your real address if he doesn't already have it.) and just be done with the situation. If you truly feel his intentions are toxic, report him as well."
gayyoungold,3dk3ee,hairybearlover,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:41:49 2015 UTC,I never thought of the situation like that. I guess it's pretty foolish to think I was somehow special or unique when he is quite possibly doing it to everyone else. Thank you for you insight!
gayyoungold,3dk3ee,dudeokie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:17:30 2015 UTC,Don't take that the wrong way though. I am not saying you aren't special or that he did feel something with you enough to test the waters. He could be very professional and just had a soft-spot for you specifically. It is hard to say though.   Just be cautious with things like this.
gayyoungold,3dk3ee,SilverDad,2,Fri Jul 17 03:00:09 2015 UTC,Walk away and report him to your state licensing agency.

gayyoungold,3dk3ee,k7jx6kq,2,Fri Jul 17 23:26:45 2015 UTC,Alot of people choose their careers based around their sexual attractions. Sorry but it's true. This guy sounds like he put himself into LGBT counseling because it gives him a hard on hearing about confused young guys.
gayyoungold,3dk3ee,Whitedragon2,2,Fri Jul 17 04:08:45 2015 UTC,Nope to the nope guy. This is abuse of power and position at its finest. Don't fall for that trick.
gayyoungold,3dk3ee,MarknDC,2,Fri Jul 17 10:54:32 2015 UTC,"Man on one hand I'm thinking this sounds like a fantasy I've had and I want to say give it a shot, but that therapist wasn't really appropriate with you.  I mean some of those comments are obvious pick ups, to me at least.  Probably should have stopped the sessions sooner yet the attention he was giving you probably felt pretty good.  Part of you likely also thought he was helping.  I'd just wonder if he really did help you in the sessions if he had an alternate motive.  Kind of changes his ability to, in my opinion, give you the proper support and help a therapist should if hes thinking about getting into your pants.  I'd try to ask him to mail you the paperwork to be safe because of the state you are in (you had a bad life event so thats why I say that).  If you meet with him face to face after he is no longer your therapist two things will likely occur; one is that he will use his charm/speech to get you into bed with him and two is that you might not have the will power to resist his charm in person where he is at his best.  You have a weakness for him as you did say you have a crush on him, it might be hard to resist him when he is right in front of you flirting with you.  You need to take care of yourself first and to me that sounds like finding a better therapist before going any further with T."
gayyoungold,3dk3ee,random-throw,2,Fri Jul 17 14:37:20 2015 UTC,Yeah he sounds like a perv. I had a boss like that who made similar sexualized comments as your guy.  Ended up he had a record of inappropriate harassing behavior.  It would be different if he was approaching you from a place of respect but he's really focused on the sexual.  And withholding your records? That is creepy and probably illegal. You should actually report him to whatever board would take away whatever license he has.  You deserve better than this jerk. For real.
gayyoungold,3dk3ee,MellowDad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:12:21 2015 UTC,Definitely breaking code of conduct. Therapists aren't friends and you they don't have dinners with clients current or former
gayyoungold,3dk3ee,cheroses,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:17:13 2015 UTC,"I just want to point out that developing a crush on your therapist is extremely common.  After all you tend to share your innermost thoughts and feelings and it begins to feel like you have developed an intimate bond with him.  It will pass as time goes on, so my advice would be to ask him to mail the paperwork."
gayyoungold,3dk3ee,jay4812,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:59:39 2015 UTC,That is very unprofessional for him to do that. That is like breaching the ethics and code of conduct to patients.   I guess you should stop seeing him especially the way he was around you when you had a therapy session with him.
gayyoungold,3dk3ee,youyouyuyu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:07:27 2015 UTC,"It's unprofessional and he's crossing a line. Also, how did you find out your professional therapist is into younger guys?"
gayyoungold,3dk3ee,youyouyuyu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:01 2015 UTC,"As unprofessional as this guy is, I think you have a small degree of fault in the whole situation as well.  How did you find out he liked younger guys in the first place? If he acted inappropriately, why didn't you say something or stop going to him?  It's undeniable that you want something with him as much as he does with you. Problem is, it feels as though he's taking advantage of you in more ways than one. This should have stopped from the moment he made any sort of inappropriate comment/action and most likely would have saved you a lot of stress."
gayyoungold,3dk3ee,youyouyuyu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:44:45 2015 UTC,"I understand this and have never faulted him for the behavior or thought I wasn't involved somehow. I even mentioned in my original post that I was crushing on hi, I was told by a friend that he likes younger guys, and I never knew it was true until he dropped not-so-subtle hints during sessions. I was supposed to go for 10 sessions. I stopped it at 7.   I guess I really should have stopped it from the get-go. I felt like the therapy was beneficial regardless of the remarks though."

You don't need to be putting in a conscious effort to give him signals if you were crushing on him. Sometimes body language and the way you speak can give all the messages even when you don't mean to or realize it.
gayyoungold,3dk3ee,nutsaq,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:10:30 2015 UTC,"It's easy to condemn the Therapist, but they are people too, and suffer from human reactions like anyone else.  He wasn't trying to seduce you while you were in therapy, as near as I can see.  While it's just so perfect for some of us to jump up on the soap box and declare the Therapist to be a predator, he's probably just a human that is attracted to another human.  Cops sometimes find prostitutes attractive.  Politicians and other public figures have relationships that some of us uppity types don't like.  Those who advocate burning the Therapist at the stake need to move out of the world of academia and spend some time in the real world with the rest of humanity.  Yes, it appears he's attracted to you, it's not a bad thing and you should have dinner with him."

See how things go while talking and if it works out well, then plan to try and meet in person. Be it one taking the full trip to the other, or splitting the trip cost-effectively to meet somewhere together.   My partner and I met online as well, which was over 2,700 miles apart. He is from the west coast, and I'm from the east coast (USA). It was definitely something we feared at the beginning of our meeting, but we discussed it. We agreed that if after talking we really felt interested in taking things further that we would travel to see one another. We talked for nearly 2 months every day, and he made the first move to come see me.   He came and visited where I lived for 4 days and had to return home due to work and some other personal life things, but I surprised him with a plane ticket back to spend more time with him since I work from home and can work from anywhere.  Two years later, I never left after flying back with him and we are now engaged to be married. :) So yea, distance is never too much. It is just a obstacle that needs to be overcome."

gayyoungold,3cz917,Darth_Algebra,2,Sun Jul 12 04:14:36 2015 UTC,"While I agree with /u/youyouyou's comment, I have a few things to add.   Definitely try to have a serious conversation with your friend. Going through these feelings that come with coming to terms with your ""nonstandard"" orientation alone is not a healthy thing to do. Be frank and tell your friend what's going through your head and what your feelings are. If he's a true friend of yours, he'll be supportive and help you manage these things. If you have other closer friends who are reliably progressive people about homosexuality and (in particular) paraphilias, talk to them too. They're going to provide crucial help in building your confidence in this matter.   As for coming out to your parents, I would say wait a bit and do it in phases. When I came out to my parents as gay, it also came with the information that I was starting to see a 63 year old man who is HIV positive, and they freaked out. It's been nearly 3 months, and the only things they have to say are discouraging, and they just want to attack my boyfriend's character. Having only put myself in the dating pool on Silverdaddies a short time before I came out to them, I really wasn't ready for what was to unfold. You have to be secure in your sexuality, and you need to be in the state of mind that you are certain and confident in yourself and your identity. You are probably not in that state of mind this early in the game, I would guess. So, keep it among friends right now.  Also, look for a boyfriend, but be smart and proceed with caution. Evaluate what you're looking for, create a thoughtful profile on SilverDaddies (or other sites) that communicates these things and gives an honest and holistic picture of the kind of person you are, do your best to filter through responses, talk on the phone and on Skype with potential matches, and (if you think at that stage you've found a catch) meet in a public place."
gayyoungold,3cz917,Darth_Algebra,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:43:49 2015 UTC,"I actually did have a Silverdaddies account, but I don't have it anymore.  I had gotten a lot of messages and it was getting overwhelming.  I've stayed in contact with a few, though.  But all the ones that treat me as a friend, and not just an ass to fuck, live far away.  But one of them I was able to meet, and we met in a park.  I think I'll wait until after the semester starts to tell my parents.  I was thinking of making a Facebook post to come out to all my friends, but my brother would see it and tell my family.  Thanks for your answer though, really helpful."
gayyoungold,3cz917,WhiteMike87,2,Sun Jul 12 04:56:49 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you. I decided to just go the long-distance relationship route because the quality of the individual who contacted me really stood out. It can work, though it's difficult. I am a graduate student (guess which discipline...) on the other side of the country from my boyfriend (who lives about 60 miles away from where I grew up), so I can at least support myself and afford to meet him every few months, but in between is a bit difficult.   I hope things work out between you and that guy you met in a park. Depending on where you are mentally, try to take it slowly and communicate with your man that's what you want to do.  Coming out as gay when the semester starts might be wise, though it's really a question of where you're at mentally before you come out. Are you ready to be preached to (""gospel of pussy"" talk from dad; the irrationality of the age difference; etc)? Are you ready for your parents to question your sanity? Are you ready to deal with your parents' disappointment? Are you ready to talk about sexual things clinically (and perhaps graphically) with them (this is especially important if they discover your boyfriend has STD's)? Are you ready for them to attack your boyfriend's character? Also, as I said, it probably isn't wise to do everything at once."

gayyoungold,3csm7u,k7jx6kq,8,Fri Jul 10 13:11:06 2015 UTC,"I'm 68 myself so this hits home for me.  I think you both need to sort out what those feelings are, and then you need to figure out what constitutes a relationship.    We talk a lot here about daddy/son relationships, but lately I've been starting to think more in terms of being a grandpa.  How do you treat a grandpa?  You love him and spend time with him when you can (never enough), and you're there for him as the years go by.  Sex is great too while that fits into the picture, but you both know that part can't last forever.  Still you will both have fond memories to cherish after that ends, even as your friendship endures until death do you part.  Does that complicate a potential relationship with someone closer to your age?  Perhaps.  I would like to think that jealousy would not be an issue on my part.  Most of all what a grandpa wants is your happiness, so I would be thrilled for you.  I would just hope that you would never choose as a new partner someone who would resent my being in your life.    So maybe that doesn't fit at all for you or for your friend.  Take it for what it's worth.  I wish you well."
gayyoungold,3csm7u,MellowDad,2,Fri Jul 10 16:18:38 2015 UTC,"Well in a way I see what you mean, but prefer to have an equal, fulfilling relationship."
gayyoungold,3csm7u,Robolabo,3,Sat Jul 11 11:57:16 2015 UTC,I'm curious why your first relationship didn't work out. Is it possible the same issues could arise with someone else?
gayyoungold,3csm7u,hairybearlover,2,Fri Jul 10 19:56:41 2015 UTC,I hope not. My ex was a lying cheating bastard.
gayyoungold,3csm7u,pan_away,3,Sat Jul 11 11:58:15 2015 UTC,"Dating someone much older has it's ups and downs that you do need to think about before committing to the relationship. For one, you really need to be sure you are willing to be there for the long-haul. It is not fair to the older party if you just want sex and will land up leaving them in 5-10 years down the road when they become much less able to do things they can do currently.   I'm in a relationship (engaged to be married as well) with my partner whom is twice my age. I've committed to the fact that I understand he will land up passing before me. It is not something I ever want to have happen or want to think about but it was something we both discussed before becoming more serious.  Something to think about is that a relationship is much more then just sex. There are the common interests, the differences that make him unique, and all the other things you have mentioned that complete the package. Are those things enough to keep you interested in him when the time comes that he cannot do much sexually? Do you two do other things together besides sex or chatting? Have you met up and spent time together? Personalities online are much different than in person. Also keep in mind that people looking for a relationship or friend typically put up a front that is partially artificial. While they may seem like the most wonderful person in the world online in a chat, being with them for a few months can show some sides of that person that you did not know about or saw the full image of."

He's currently 81 years old and it's the best thing that ever happened to me.   I think you should go for it, since you two have feelings for each other. It might work out in the end or it might not.

If he just had went the extra step of actually asking me out instead of just beating around the bush things would have turned out differently.  He was about 5' 10"", mid 50s, bald, broad shouldered, overweight, hairy everywhere, did oldies karaoke at seniors homes as a singer (one time he asked me to go with him to roadie or play the piano for him, should have said yes).

gayyoungold,3cc13v,thistime_neveragain,2,Tue Jul 7 01:57:19 2015 UTC,"Here's a slightly different take...    I'm the older guy and everywhere I end up, I seem to attract attention so I'm usually pretty ready for it. I had some gay neighbors and one night, I was smoking a cigar on my stoop when one called me over. I didn't want to go over and talk to him since I was still hard from a hookup who had just left. He nagged and so I finally went over. He saw my endowment in my sweats and his eyes widened, but he didn't mention it. I should have known, however, that word would get out.    Two doors down from me on the other side was a young couple - a tall handsome boy, and his wife. We'd always hang out and talk and they knew full well what was going on when I had a visitor. It wasn't until after Sam had seen my endowment, however, that things got sexual. It all started with the wife suggesting that her husband felt a bit inadequate, endowment-wise, and asked me if dick size mattered to me. I said, truthfully, that it didn't, and that I actually prefer smaller cocks. When I said that, her husband was walking up, and he heard and went red with embarrassment.    She said out loud, ""see? Even Thistime_Neveragain says size doesn't matter! In fact, he likes smaller dicks more"". The poor boy was beyond embarrassed, but I could tell through the embarrassment that he was also pleased. That set my radar off.    Later that evening, I was out watering my plants out front when he walked by with his dog. We struck up a conversation about a video game we were both playing and I decided to ask him over. He accepted quickly, and about 20 minutes later we were gaming.     He sat very awkwardly next to me whereas usually he was very comfortable. I was wearing basketball shorts and you could see a bulge, but I wasn't actually trying to seduce him that night - just trying to get a feel for things. Suddenly, he said ""Sam says you have a massive cock. Is that true?"" I replied, ""naaaw, it's big, but it isn't massive"". He then proceeded to reach over very nervously and rub my leg quickly. I took a that as my cue and asked if he wanted to play with it. He nodded and said, "" Annie thinks I should"". I laughed, hauled it out, and he looked at it, licked his lips, and laid his head in my lap, and swallowed my cock.     I was super surprised, but didn't move and I let him explore. I pulled him to his feet eventually, pulled his pants down, and started sucking him. He came in about 5 seconds, and then he leaned down and asked me to fuck him.    I took him to my bedroom, had him straddled the corner of my bed, got between his ass cheeks, ate his hole for about 20 minutes until he was hard and his hole was open, and then started nosing my cock around his opening. I started to lean down and get a condom when he pushed against me, and with a moan, his ass swallowed my cock.     I rode him for the next 30 minutes and busted inside him. He kept grabbing his dick while I was inside him and came twice more, the last time with me. He was one of the most natural bottoms I've ever met. I asked if he was going to tell his wife, and he said he was and that she wanted to know everything that happened. I continued fucking him for the next three years until they moved."
gayyoungold,3cc13v,hairybearlover,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:42:37 2015 UTC,"Growing up my dads best friend was a 5'8ish chubby hairy bear that I was so attracted to. He was in his mid 40s while I was growing up and I constantly had fantasies about him. He lived across the street from us. I would do everything I could to be around him as much as possible, going to his house by myself to hang out and listen to music. I don't think he was gay or bi, and nothing ever happened. But as bad as it sounds, being a little kid, I always wanted something to happen with him."
gayyoungold,3cbzp9,the0theraccount,5,Mon Jul 6 18:57:43 2015 UTC,"This was written with a lot of self-awareness and grace. For what it's worth -- and I understand that this situation is very nuanced and your feelings are complicated -- it really sounds like your friend gave you the best advice, and you dodged a bullet. Your fears and insecurities about R's HIV status and homemade porn collection would probably have grown had you pursued your affair with him. On top of that, the way you describe his interactions with you post-breakup make him seem... if not immature, then certainly emotionally manipulative. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but since you haven't been in a formal long-term relationship with him, how do you know the relationship wouldn't have been a disaster?  The only thing you can be sure of is where you stand now. You're currently in what sounds like a very healthy and fulfilling relationship, and I fully encourage you to invest all of your emotional energy in that.  Thanks for sharing your story."
gayyoungold,3cbzp9,SuperExtraGravity,5,Tue Jul 7 02:38:05 2015 UTC,"I'm happy you were able to make a decision not to see him, however I hope you will work on your communication skills as you continue to grow. If my understanding is correct, you had a few main issues with him:   He's HIV+ He has taken and distributed pictures/videos of himself You're afraid you'd be just another notch in the belt with him.   The first issue is a big concern. PrEP is readily available and HIV is not a death sentence anymore however that doesn't mean you can just brush things off so good on you for the concern for your health. Regarding your lecture about telling before you made the trip, I'm not quite sure if I agree. Did you express you're traveling 1 hour+ while on a limited budget? But honestly, my contention is that you ""told him beforehand that [you] didn't really want to get up to anything frisky with him, that [you] just wanted an old-fashioned date."" If that's the case, I think bringing up status over the course of that date or the next one (i.e. before entering the bedroom) is perfectly acceptable. Sure it's wonderful to come in to meeting someone armed with all the knowledge, but instead you'd be judging him not as a whole but based on one specific aspect; for having a old-fashioned date that's a bit unfair, if you were on a hookup I'd agree whole heartedly but you set the stage for something else which I don't think you truly gave a chance.  The second issue I think you could handle better. One thing to keep in mind when entering a relationship is previous action is not indicative of future actions. Yes, you have an absolute valid concern regarding videos (that'd be an absolute no no for me) but that doesn't mean he did so without the consent of the others (or did he say he snuck them?). I know you expressed concern (good!) but how serious was it? Besides the joking comment I think you opted to avoid this concern than confront it. What if he was totally cool with not taking any videos just that the guys he met before were turned on by it and agreed?  End of the day, I do think you made the correct decision. Hearing about how he acted after you told him no second date, that's disappointing to hear. On that aspect, sounds like he is very much used to getting his way and wasn't prepared to be turned down. Dealing with that would be difficult in the long run, so good job. Enjoy your current relationship, make the best of life. Your comment ""I will never know if I passed on something that could have given me life-long happiness"" is very true but that's called life, every day you will be faced with little and large decisions that will shape your life, that's no justification to freeze, just realize that you will look back and wonder ""what if."" Go into life with an open mind, make the decisions your most comfortable with (seems like you're on a great track here!), and enjoy"
gayyoungold,3cbzp9,woofmuscle,2,Tue Jul 7 03:55:57 2015 UTC,"Pretty interesting to see everyone comment on his reaction to being rejected as if it's a total bad thing.  Could it be a case of the baby throwing his toys out of the crib? Maybe. Could it be insecurities? Maybe. But it could also be that he cared a great deal and that's how he naturally expressed it at the time.

Here's my input: your initial concerns about online photos and his HIV status are valid, but not as big of red flags as how he handled rejection. He's pushing 50, with an ex wife and a son. There exists a very specific type of older man who dates younger, who does so because of his insecurities. Looking for validation via photos and dealing with rejection from a guy you've been on only one date with, and who is decades your junior, by ""balling"" on skype is another way these insecurities surface. In a relationship, it's those insecurities that turn into control issues, sequestration from friends and family, and physical and emotional abuse. Us young guys who date older need to be especially aware of this. Even though he seems like a catch from his looks, I would be happy I got away early if I were you. I have experienced almost this exact same scenario enough times to spot it from a mile away. PM me if you'd like to talk more in depth."
gayyoungold,3c88sn,heyyouyeahyou55,6,Sun Jul 5 20:44:31 2015 UTC,"Anything is possible. First step is to put your needs / desires / intentions out there. Which you already have (here). Also include your desires in any online profiles, if it's what you really want. Be as clear as you can be too in your description.  You will find out in short order. I'm sure there are older couples looking for a younger third. You don't know until you ask, & or get invited in. Good luck!"

gayyoungold,3c88sn,youyouyuyu,3,Sun Jul 5 22:39:23 2015 UTC,"It can work in short term like 3 to 6 months, but after that you will end up developing an affinity to one of the guys in the couple and when that happens it's all down hill. Resentment/Jealousy and either you leave or they end up breakjng up.  That being said it is a whole lot of fun while it lasts. If you plan to be there with amy frequency it will be difficult to mannafe the emotions of everyone in the situation.  Please dont let this deter you from trying to find one. It has been some of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Just prepare yourself for the consequences of inserting yourself in an already existing relationship."

gayyoungold,3c88sn,kintotes15,3,Mon Jul 6 00:31:42 2015 UTC,"I...guess.  I haven't been in a committed 1-on-1 relationship myself. And to be honest, most of the time with couples I usually find myself attracted to both because I see them as one.  I don't know if it's correct to call is a polyamorous relationship because I wouldn't necessarily see myself as an equal to them. If anything, I would almost prioritize the importance of their relationship first over my own interests. I can't imagine stepping in between their relationship. I'd feel pretty ashamed.  And the chance that I might find myself my own boyfriend might actually happen in the future.  I'm...essentially seeing them as parental figures.  That sounds kinda fucked up, doesn't it? haha :("
gayyoungold,3c88sn,GayAuroch,2,Mon Jul 6 02:52:05 2015 UTC,"I'm in a triad with such a configuration, as it were... Me and E. call each other ""daddy"" and ""son"" as terms of affection, and I call D. ""Mama Bear"". The terms have naturally come about, with respect to E. and D.'s personalities, and also as a way to respect and celebrate the age differences of our relationship (20 years in between me and them).  They were together when I first met E., though because of some medicine D. is on, E.'s sexual needs were not being met. With me in the picture now, my direct relationship with E. is much more sexual, compared to my relationship with D. which focuses more on companionship and sharing in our mutual interests.  So yes, it is possible."

A few points...  1) This tells him your orientation  2) Without being overly aggressive by directly hitting on him, you give him the choice of whether he wants to make any advances towards you.

I asked for his help in the electronics department a few weeks ago and went above and beyond to help me find someone that had a key to the glass case where they hold the expensive items so I figured I would be able to ask for his help with finding some good fishing stuff.   It would be a good chance to strike up a conversation about fishing, I could ask if he fishes, if he does I could express my desire to pick up the hobby and could innocently ask if he knows of any good fishing areas and if he'd like to go with me sometime.   That wouldn't be strange to ask an employee you've had a few encounters with right?"

gayyoungold,3c0s0m,throw123awaydnm,7,Fri Jul 3 18:44:57 2015 UTC,"I sympathize with you, however, your partner seeking to take out a life insurance policy is something a lot of people do for their loved ones. Someone of any age should consider taking out a life insurance policy for a loved one especially if you or they have any financial commitments. In fact, most mortgages etc. make it a requirement.   We can die at any age and at any second, dwelling on that fact restricts you from living. Concentrate on the hours you spend with him every day."

gayyoungold,3c0s0m,MellowDad,4,Fri Jul 3 19:47:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can repay him.  You can repay him by staying with him and loving him for the rest of his life, which, I hope, will continue for many, many more years."

As long as what you are doing is perfectly legal, there is no harm in enjoying it the way you want to.   It is actually a very common fantasy to have in an older/younger relationship. Typically it is seen as a father/son type thing and in many cases, the older is turned on by the younger calling him father or daddy, and vise-versa with being called son/boy by the older."

gayyoungold,3bsygq,themajig6,11,Wed Jul 1 22:03:14 2015 UTC,"1)  on line.  Start a silverdaddies.com and end there (hopefully).  Phone apps like Mister specifically target older men (Daddyhunt on a phone).  2) The best way to go is face to face.  When you talk to guys  on silverdaddies ask them if there is a bar in the area that caters to older guys (a wrinkle room) and go there.   3)  Check to see if there is a Prime Timers group in your area.  They are a social group for older gentlemen and if you are 1/2 way decent looking they will be lining up to meet you.  If you are under 21 the bar may be impossible, but Prime Timers is a great option.  Actually meeting and talking to men is way better than dealing with texts or emails in the online world.  Also, don't be afraid of asking any older guys you are not interested in when you talk to them about places you might meet men who are right for you.  You will also likely have to go up to them and introduce yourself.  Many older guys don't think a younger guy would be interested in them and have been around longer and have experienced more soul killing rejection.  So don't be afraid to talk to them.  Try and pay your own way as much as possible, don't take advantage of anyone and also you won't feel 'obligated' to do anything you don't want to do.  Be careful, you don't want to pick up anything (HIV obviously, but other STDs are no fun either) that would make you less attractive when you find Mr. RIGHT.  A nice case of cold sores is never attractive.  Don't rush into anything.  You are worth the wait for your older suitor.  Just like paying your own way, taking things slowly shows your gentleman that you are not just a trick, but boyfriend material, assuming you are not interested in just sport fucking.  If you are interested in just sport fuckiing, install grinder, scruff, growlr, and mister and buy a case of condoms and have at it.  Also, older guys are more prone to erection issues, just goes with the liking older guys,"

When I'm in the gym and a younger guy comes up and starts talking to me, I find that confidence very appealing. Young and knows what he wants. If you wanted to take a more IRL approach, then just strike up conversations. Just see where it leads.... cause you never know. And even if they are not gay, a lot of older guys love giving younger guys advice and other forms of support as well. They can be great friends too."

gayyoungold,3bsygq,hairybearlover,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:06:48 2015 UTC,"Online is a great place to start finding people and getting more comfortable with talking to older guys. There are tons of websites dedicated to younger/older men. Keep in mind some of them do tend to have specific cliques and such on them in terms of types of guys. So you may land up finding a site that is stated to be one thing but is more of another. Also look on sites that cater to your preference in men. Just because the site does not specifically say it is for older/younger relationships does not mean people with the same interest don't exist on them.   Check Craigslist for your area as well. While in some areas it is not the best place to meet people, it is a good place to find out where people of like-mindedness hang out. Be it at certain clubs, book stores, or other locations, it can help you find out more about your area and where to find others that may be interested in your age group.   I totally agree with thehogdog about meeting in person. It is definitely the best way to really get to know someone truly. Online, just reading words behind an alias does not really paint the whole picture for you. Getting to see their reactions during conversations and their body language can really speak a lot for how they really are as a person. Always meet somewhere public though, never invite someone to your house or somewhere private for the first time. Meet in at a bar, a restaurant, etc. Do things for the first few dates/meetup's in public areas. While the rate of meeting something that is a potential hazard is low, it is better safe then sorry.  Take things slow. Do not rush into a relationship. Get to know who you are talking to and spend time together before making any life changing decisions and jumping into a relationship. Moving quickly can lead to very heartbreaking things as well as major financial issues. (I rushed into my first serious gay relationship and landed up losing pretty much all of my savings after finding out my ex lied about everything.)  Look for local groups, gatherings, events and so on for anything gay related. Don't limit yourself to looking for things that are specifically for older men. You could meet the man of your dreams at a simple gay fund raiser / rally. (Not to say thehogdogs suggestion was bad, just keep an open mind and explore all the events and groups you can.) Older men go to all kinds of events for LGBT related things. For example, there is a mens group where I live that myself and my partner are part of. I'm the youngest member of the group being 28, while more then 75% of the group is over the age of 50. There is also a prime timers group that mingles with us too where most of the men are in their 60-70s."

I'm always trying to find the right single player game he can get into and I can just be there behind him and try to give him hints but video games just simple aren't his interest.   Now the other side of things, he tried getting me into his old 80s action movies he has watched of the years. As well as some 80s bands.

I love this time together because he puts his computer and phone/tablet down while I put my videogames away so we can chill.  We each get a glimpse of shows the other grew up on while also finding new shows to watch.  Just wish we watched them more often in bed instead of in our matching lazy boy chairs but with Chromecast in the bedroom now we'll be in there more often (YAY!).  I have tried so, so many times to get him to play videogames but he just wants nothing to do with them.  Best I can do is get him to play Mario Kart once every blue moon with the kids and I.  The man won't even play chess with me anymore because I always beat him.  Games in general he is not a fan of.  He'll mess around with a free phone game every so often but that lasts maybe a few days.  He did manage to get me into golfing so he gets major points for that since my father never could after years of trying.  I think it really is an age thing.  I'm much calmer and more settled down now so I enjoy zening out to keep my composure so I make decent shots.  Probably helps I get spend the entire 18 hole course staring at his butt in those sexy golf pants XD  But we have both been taking lessons for about a year now and we actually find it fun to swap training notes with each other and play a course together.

I thought I would just continue to hook up and never be able to pursue a real relationship, but I did end up meeting the man of my dreams. It is possible. He has an ex-wife and kids from a previous marriage but he's completely out now and even though we're long distance we make it work. I absolutely adore him he is the most amazing person in this world and I am his world. I still pinch myself because it's actually real. You'll find him. I promise."

gayyoungold,3b4mgp,50shadesofLife,5,Thu Jun 25 22:47:30 2015 UTC,"Good for you for beginning to get comfortable in your own skin.  I must say I wouldn't be totally comfortable in your position but I also don't believe in seeing/fucking different people at the same time. Even if I were, I would caution you and tell you that it is not the best way to start a relationship. The red flag here is the part where you say that you guys had a conversation and, from what I gathered, he likes having casual sex (a lot) whereas you like to settle in with someone before doing so. And I haven't even brought the other ""boy"" into the equation yet either...   If I feel like I can't stop thinking about him, and so badly want a life we could have together, does this mean I am am falling for him or am I just desperate for something else.   Be careful especially in your circumstance as it is probably easy for you to fall in love with him. At this point, I'm not exactly sure if you like him as a whole rather than the idea of being with him. Either way he isn't going to speed up so you can really figure out if that's the case.  Would I say you're a couple? No. Unless you've talked about it.  Would I say that he wants to be a couple? Maybe, probably not.  Not to be a buzzkill but I think the majority of guys nowadays want a relationship, but, want sex with whomever, and whenever they want, more-so. Unfortunately, it reads like that's what your guy is like.  As for your mental block, maybe it's just the case of you not being real comfortable with what's going on. Are you actually having an orgasm at some point? If so, what are you (you or him) doing to achieve this. Are you thinking about reaching an orgasm while having sex? If so, try to just relax and enjoy whatever it is you're doing, or focus on pleasing him or getting pleased. It's also possible he sucks in bed. :P  Communication should be the #1 aspect of a relationship. You should communicate on all aspects: when you're happy, when you're sad, when the other person makes you happy, when the other person makes you sad, what you're in the mood to eat, etc. Strained communication doesn't make anything easy.  For all I know I could be totally wrong about all of what I've analyzed about your situation so forgive me if that's the case, I surely don't know enough about you or him to give you any 100% accurate statements. What I do know is that relationships are worthwhile, but they are also difficult; if this one doesn't work out it doesn't mean it was your fault and it certainly doesn't mean you should stop trying."
gayyoungold,3b4mgp,youyouyuyu,2,Fri Jun 26 00:56:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for replying, your feedback was extremely useful honestly. I think your mighty cool. :) Looks like the answer is I was just really unhappy with myself, and D made me feel awesome. Even though he approached me, I gained what feels like a lifetime of knowledge and quite a bit of self confidence.... So you may be right, if I'm just infatuated with the idea of someone making me happy, or just being with him it's wrong.  I believe I like D for who is he, he did let me get quite the intimate view of his daily life. He has shown me enough to know he is a good person that is capable of letting someone in. Because of me being a bit late to the party, I don't have any prior experience so i'm just going on my gut.  When it comes to the other man, I admit it makes me feel a bit like a fool. He was upfront about him, which was very honest and the right thing to do, but it also kind of warned me, that maybe he wouldn't have the balls to tell me he didn't want to see me anymore if the time came, like this other guy. I don't regret it however, it was hot and i wanted to do it, felt a kind of liberation.   It just left me with more questions, questions I eventually decided he would deem dramatic and to serious. He isn't a bad guy at all, he has a big heart, I just don't want to be naive. If he sucks in bed I wouldn't even know :P dear god!  I didn't write this to thrash D, It just made me feel good to write it.  Still, my gut tells me two things:  While me and D were getting to know each other, I think we both saw a glimpse of it going to fast, or somehow, one of us fucking it up. So instead of trying to improve things, were got scared and don't want to change anything. If we both are feeling this way, we just need to break the ice again, right?  OR  This guy isn't for me, and I should stop trying and see where the chips falls.  PS it's late and that may not make much sense, but like I said. Damn it feels good to get this shit off my chest. :)"
gayyoungold,3b4mgp,youyouyuyu,2,Fri Jun 26 03:44:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think you were thrashing him, but what you say or think of him can reveal a lot to a third party who is looking from the outside in. All relationships are a learning experience and they will never cease to be.   I know I say this a lot in this sub, but sit him down and have an earnest conversation. It's not dramatic if you go about it the right way."
gayyoungold,3b4mgp,MellowDad,2,Fri Jun 26 04:25:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it might be better off if you ease up a bit and let things play out before worrying so much about what your future with D holds.  Keep in mind that he is your ""first love"" so to speak.  As such you have invested a lot of your hopes and dreams about the life you have imagined for yourself into a relationship with D.  On the other hand, you are not D's first love.  He is in a very different place.  He's been there done that, and one of the things he's probably done is to have another young man fall head over heals for him, profess all kinds of love and commitment, and then quickly check out when the initial infatuation faded.  Let me confess as well that I am probably on the same page as D regarding exclusivity.  I think that monogamy is highly overrated.  You may feel very differently and I respect that totally, but please don't expect D to change in that regard - certainly not in the short term.  And you are NOT that late to the party. I was in my 40's. Why not give yourself the opportunity to have other sexual encounters and see what you've been missing?  Explore a little. Just be safe.  On the other hand if that's not something you feel comfortable with, don't change your standards to accommodate D's, and don't expect him to change.  It will end badly.  I wish you well. You have an opportunity to have something beautiful.  Just don't expect it to happen over night."
gayyoungold,3b4mgp,themcp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"like a lot of inter-gen couples, the communication is what is strained.   Communication is generally strained because people aren't communicating. You know what makes strain in communication go away? Talking. Don't just say ""oh well, communication is strained,"" and give up. Open up and discuss what you feel needs to be discussed and things can be a lot clearer."
gayyoungold,3b4mgp,hairybearlover,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:13:24 2015 UTC,"First and foremost it is great to hear that you are becoming comfortable in your own skin and truly getting to know yourself better. Nothing is better then really understanding what you want and who you are as a person. With being newly out and exploring, it is best to really focus on yourself first to find what you really want in life, in a man, and in a relationship. Which so far it seems from your post, you seem more interested in having a serious relationship with someone and not just weekend sex.  From how it sounds with what you said about D, he is someone whom is not looking to settle down with one person. He is more of an adventurous type that is interested in connections and not relationships for the long haul. He sounds more interested in being friends with benefits then he does about getting serious with you, and you alone. I would say that even if he were to take your relationship more serious, he is still going to want to have an open relationship since he even said himself he enjoys sex with different people and in different ways.   While we can only build so much of an image of this  guy based on what you have told us, it does not seem like he wants a serious monogamous relationship. If that is something you personally want, then perhaps it is something you should really think about before continuing to have a sexual relationship with him. Your emotions and feelings for him are not going to change much if you continue to play around together. It is something you should really have a talk with him about if you want things to be more serious.   I don't think he would get upset with the post personally, I would see it more as a flattering thing. But it's hard to say since we don't know his personality too much. While talking may seem difficult it is really the only option you have to see where things are currently in his mind, as well as where they may/can be in the future and if there is potential for a committed relationship down the road.   The best bet you have is to talk with him and find out where things stand in his point of view. Keep in mind, depending on how things are worded and brought up, it could cause a strain in your current relationship or even end it altogether. Rather then pressure him into the conversation, try and bring it up casually. Ask questions in a manner that does not seem like you are insecure or anything, but rather truly interested in his opinion about the two of you. The only way you will find out how things stand though is by him telling you his point of view."
gayyoungold,3b4mgp,hairybearlover,2,Tue Jul 14 10:24:57 2015 UTC,"Massive thanks to everyone who has wrote such brilliant response. One of them was so well crafted, I thought it might have been D himself.  I've come to many conclusions regarding my feelings toward D, how he has changed my perception and what I want going forward.  Here is the thing, definition for ""relationship"" are so bizarre. It could be anything right? When someone tells you i'm not ready for a relationship, isn't it to late? Haven't you related enough to be concerned it might be turning into something you don't want?  D Had a long relationship, one where him and another man his age shared a whole life, a house, friends...for reasons I don't even care to know, it didn't work out, and he still talks about it with guilt and disdain. I think this plays on him a lot. Regardless of what he defines a relationship as, in a short period of time it's become one of the most important relationship of my life.   I want to try to show him that our relationship is like no other, and we can choose to make it what we want. This scares him I think. He said me being 25 scares him, he's told me he can be demanding, grumpy....selfish. All of these things I knew about D very fast, I've listened carefully to what he has said.    So...I've told him again, that if he couldn't tell me he was interested in someone else it would be a problem. I'm not going to go through any shit, I'm not the kind of person like that. I said if he really does like me, he would have to tell me he wanted to end it before he chased some other desire....the look I got...  D doesn't know what he wants, and I think it's because he has found it ;)  I need a good way to ask him...no bullshit, are you fucking with me? Or are you just seriously confused. I've known I love older men for a while now, but it is all new to me in practice. I think D has liked younger guys for a while too, but has no clue how to do it in practice. He isn't exclusively attracted to young guys, but I just don't see him going for someone his age.   I know we agreed no expectation and to move slow, but those rules don't make any sense anymore. The relationship is what it is, I don't want to move in, or get married, just to acknowledge that we are both enjoying this and it's a real thing to US. That it means something.  In the back of his mind I can see the anxiety building, telling his father he's dating a boy, meeting my parents, one moment of judgement to another. I understand that we have different generations and different anxieties with being homosexual, but at this point in time, shouldn't D not be worried about this, and how can I show him? I'm afraid he may never find happiness if he doesn't try. And I'm here, were doing this...it feels amazing and yet we stop each other.  I know there are to many angles and not enough info. Hope this glimpse of my life can entertain or help someone. Individually I know me and D are having a fucking blast, that he probably can't wait until the next time we can sneak away from our work lives, drink some wine and fuck all night. That we both know the excitement is almost to much to handle, and we don't want it to fade or go away or even change at all. The understanding we have of each other isn't absolute, nor mysterious. But, together, it would be nice, to just look at it the same way :("

In that way we definitely had differing roles, as he was absolutely more experienced , but enjoyed making me his ""top-boi"" so that's what more or less happened over some months.  But there was a good deal of ""control-play"" where he definitely had as much fun as I did. He was a very ""aggressive"" bottom you could say, so this made the basic top/bottom relationship crystal clear. That said he had a series of ""rules"" that I had to follow, and among them was a ""if I was horned up at all, I needed to use his mouth"" , ""if I wasn't horned up, I couldn't say  no either"".   This definitely had some interesting dynamics, but I wouldn't say we had a very deep relationship outside of the sexual aspect of things."

He is super submissive and refuses to even consider leading. He loves being tied up though! So I tie him up with a hood on, play with his body and when I am ready I climb on top of him so he can fuck me. He loves that part! I have a strap-on, but he doesn't want it as he says anal hurts too much. That way he is still sort of the bottom sub. It works for us!  The rest of the relationship is pretty similar. I take care of him in all of his affairs (including supporting him financially) as he has no patience for the day to day business of life and has MAJOR anxiety problems that make it hard for him to work. And we are both masculine. Outside of the bedroom, about the most I get is a hug. But we do love each other.   Good luck!

gayyoungold,3b3rzg,boystyx,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:54:19 2015 UTC,"When I met my partner, we discussed top/bottom roles as well. We both also came up with being vers. Me being more vers/bottom, while he stated he was vers/bottom as well because he was mostly a top in his last relationship and wanted to be a bottom more. As our relationship has grown over the last few years, he has become a much more dominate top but he still bottoms anytime. I see myself in the relationship has a submissive person. I'm very quite, shy around new people, and more of a follower then a leader when it comes to making decisions. He usually takes the leadership role in the relationship. Not so much because of his age, just because of how I am personality wise.   If you are looking to get him to top more often, have you tried talking with him about it? Is there a specific reason he prefers not to top outside of the getting soft quickly? There is medication that can assist with that if he has issues performing. (Be sure to talk with your doctors before taking anything though as it can be hard on older men.)  As for sustaining, it is more depending on how badly your bottom side wants to shine. In some cases people that are versatile can handle never being one or the other again in a relationship, but it is entirely dependent on the person. In other cases people enjoy both worlds and want to satisfy one or the other from time to time.  Definitely try and bring up a conversation with him about topping, possible alternatives such as medication or toys. Don't pressure an open relationship if he is not ok with it though. If one person in the relationship has any issue with it, it will never work out. But try and get to the reason behind him not wanting to top. (Granted, don't hound him to a point that he gets annoyed with you over the subject.)"

While it sucks, it does make travelling to see each other a very special time. But, this is also complicated by the fact that there's a whole ocean between us that adds a 5 hour time difference.  Some of the things we do include sleeping with Skype calls on, timing our meals to eat with each other (my lunch can be his early dinner at times), and generally just allowing each other to be there via video call throughout our mundane tasks. I work from home so it's not unusual for him to come home and go about his routine with my face on his screen; he'll also stick his cam pointing out a window so that I can watch him garden.  We also try to Skype when we're out in town doing whatever, whenever possible, at least for a couple of minutes. If not, then we take photos of what we're doing or eating sort of like a ""this is what you'd see if you were here"" type of concept.  My favorite thing though is our little whistle. We saw a Cirque du Soleil together during our first in-person meeting and one of the clowns would do a little whistle throughout the program. It amused us to no end and we started using it as a way of saying, ""I'm here"". So sometimes he'll be gardening and I'll be on a mundane work call when he walks into his house for something, whistling the chime as loud as he possibly can; and I'll burst into a fit of giggles because it reminds me of all the fun things we've done together... Then he'll blow me a kiss hello.   Probably sounds stupid but it's what we do."
gayyoungold,3aoosx,youyouyuyu,2,Mon Jun 22 10:48:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, I am very envious of that relationship right there. I have to ask.. Because of the distance do you guys keep an open relationship? Only curious because I have chatted with a few guys that were over seas and I usually end up breaking it off at some point because it just never seems realistic to me. But what you described here sounds very sweet."
gayyoungold,3aoosx,daddysfriedchicken,2,Mon Jun 22 12:04:41 2015 UTC,"We are monogamous.   It helps that we are identical in the way that we approach relationships. While both of us are pretty flirty and charismatic, we value each other an insane amount and see sex as an extremely intimate and personal act. Not saying we are prudes or whatever, that's just how we operate."
gayyoungold,3aoosx,youyouyuyu,2,Mon Jun 22 12:25:35 2015 UTC,Do you think you will ever be together full time?  You over there or him here?
gayyoungold,3aoosx,thehogdog,2,Mon Jun 22 20:52:26 2015 UTC,"Eventually, yes. At least we hope so."

gayyoungold,3aoosx,SieurLamond,3,Wed Jun 24 01:14:39 2015 UTC,"My guy and I are about 200 miles apart, which is not too far of a distance compared to others that I've seen here but it can still make things difficult at times. We've been seeing each other for about a year and a half and I make the trip to see him around once per month but every now and then he'll come see me (it's much harder for him to come to me because I'm in college and can't really host him.)   When we're together, we always make sure to fill the time spent with each other with fun activities such as nice dinners, gallery/museum visits, exploring the city, etc. - I was just with him last weekend and he surprised me with a cute riverside picnic lunch. Since we do not see each other too often, we try to make the most of our time spent with each other.  Our relationship can be somewhat difficult when we're apart due to a variety of factors. Both of us have fairly busy schedules so we're not always available to text/call each other, which has caused some strain in the past but we managed to work through it. He doesn't really like using Skype either - I don't really understand his reasoning behind it but I respect his wishes and stick to just phone calls when we get the chance. Still, I care a lot about him and despite a few difficulties here and there, we're really happy with each other. There's a chance that I may be in his city for a 6-month internship within the next year, so I'm hoping that we'll have the chance to eliminate the distance and spend more time with each other in the near future."
gayyoungold,3aoosx,MrPrez0,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:04:17 2015 UTC,"Because I'm not in a relationship but still in the trying-to-meet-people phase, that's where my perspective is coming from with this reply.    I think you've gotta have someone who has some experience with travel or at least doesn't have a mental block about it.  I actually can't stand it when I'm 50-100 miles away from someone and they say ""I don't know how that's going to work?""  Dude, 100 miles is nothing when on a regular basis I'm driving 300 miles each way to see my family every month.    Also when you travel a distance you both have to be willing to plan in advance and keep those plans.  It can't be, ""I don't know what I'm doing yet this weekend, I'll let you know"" because you can't plan a 2-hour or 3-hour drive on the spur of the moment.   I think in a lot of ways it can be a better relationship bc when you're together, you're going to be really present for each other because you want to make the most of the time you have with each other."

gayyoungold,3alzu5,sdcrow,3,Sun Jun 21 17:56:44 2015 UTC,"66 here.  Sweet spot, hmmmm maybe 30-45 but to be honest it depends on the guy.    Was in my current house for the first Christmas alone and had been flaked on by a 48 year old who was supposed to come for the weekend.  Got messaged by this 23 year old on Silver Daddies and we chatted and the topics covered the gamut and very little of it was the normal, ""what are you into?"".    He asked if he could come over and I immediately started to say no and they thought to myself.  You spent 2 days cleaning the house, bought all this food for a guy who didn't have the decency to say he was flaking.  It's Christmas Eve, what the hell do you have to lose.  So he came over and we sat in front of the fireplace and conversed non-stop for 3 hours talking about religion, politics, food, science, music.  He was working on a double Masters in physics and music, taught himself Chinese so he could travel to China.  Finally he said, ""can we go upstairs?"".  He kissed like an angel and fucked like the devil.  We've seen each other a couple of other times when he comes to visit his parents nearby.    So I try not to judge books by their recommended age levels."

gayyoungold,3ahyvv,Mygaythrowaway_,3,Sat Jun 20 10:23:30 2015 UTC,"I'm going to throw my vote in for doing it.   Obligatory meet in a public area, inform a friend where you will be, and if possible your situation.  The longer you avoid it the worse it's going to be. You are young and have nothing to lose. Even if you find that you are not compatible with this man you still will have gained from the experience. The next time you go to meet someone it will be a little easier  Make sure you stress to him the importance of you feeling comfortable. Go as slow as you can. And if you decide to get intimate with this man do it safely!   Go forth my brother.. Step out of repression!"

Older guy here, remember that this can be intimidating for both of you.  In fact, I will suggest that the 'experience' gap is more important than the age gap here.  OP, If the older guy seems to be the sort who connects with younger guys in this way all the time,  be prepared to keep this pretty casual.  If, however, you both seem to be excited to be connecting on this level for the first time, and he is as inexperienced as you in establishing an older/younger relationship, then, hey, the stars may have just aligned!  Good luck!"
gayyoungold,3ahyvv,pizzaforce3,0,Mon Jun 22 03:58:32 2015 UTC,"Do it. If you love him and he loves you and if he is retired, you could always move together in your state or in his. If not, you could always find other men in your area easily.  If you are into older men you'll find your way by yourself. Just know its not the easier way to be gay. 31 with 67 here, we are planing to buy a house just to prove its possible."

gayyoungold,3ahyvv,SieurLamond,3,Sat Jun 20 14:19:35 2015 UTC,"Just seems a bit a heavy to talk about love and moving in. I think OP is more in conflict about starting to meet older men and feeling comfortable socializing.  I think OP should go for it as far as meeting the guy and take it from there. He needs to become comfortable and the only way to do that is to try it out. He needs to understand that there will probably be several older men he will meet in his future and there will be some awkwardness, some success, some failures. The important thing is that he will learn from it and feel more confident and have more clarity about himself.  I (27) met my partner (52) three years ago. We're very happy together but it takes work. Before that it personally took me several sexual encounters with other older men to feel more comfortable and enjoy my sexuality."
gayyoungold,3ahyvv,foreskinwaffles,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:33:50 2015 UTC,You are totally right and my post was just to encourage him and to show its possible to be in love with an older man. But your post is much more complete.
gayyoungold,3ahyvv,SieurLamond,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:38:23 2015 UTC,"I think it was more that you gave the impression that since they both love each other than they should meet up. Which doesn't make much sense they just started talking a week ago.   I'm assuming you meant to say that the possibility of love is possible so he should go for it?   Personally I think he should. As long as they meet in a public place first and feel out the situation. A coffee shop is the perfect place to do so :)   There are some really damaged people out there so you should always be careful. On the other hand there are also so many amazing guys out there to meet, older and younger :)"
gayyoungold,3ahyvv,RustyGuns,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:47:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comment rusty  So reasuming the story :  Throwaway and older dude met on silverdaddy last week.  Throwaway is an anon but also an adult who could read all the other threads on this forum about how to meet an older dude. Older dude is into younger men but also could be a rapist pedophile.  We all think its safer for Throwaway to meet older dude in a public place but we secretly all think that the meeting will probably end in a sauna or in an hotel. Older dude wont do all this travel for nothing in return...  With time, Throwaway will be in love with older dude and older dude will also like Throwaway. After a couple of back and fort between both states, older dude will be tired and less interrested and will probably ask to Throwaway to come to his state. Throwaway's parents will probably still don't know that he is into older dudes so Throwaway will be heartbroken.  Does Throwaway and Older dude will lived happily and have a lot of children? Stay tuned for the next episode.  jk  In my very personnal opinion and after a day of reflexion, Throwaway should stop to try to connect with this guy cause to far away. Ok, internet could be an option to meet men and often just for sex but to really develop a steady relation, its preferable when the two guys are in the same city. There should be plenty of older dudes in his city that could be interested in him. Go to the bar friday during the happyhours, go to the gym, find other internet sites where there is more activity...  I met my actual bf on gaydaddy but he lives 15min in car from my house.  IMO, just a face in an email is not enough too.  To end, you will probably meet a lot of men in your life and if you choose to meet him, take this as an experience to put yourself more confident next time but I see a lot of difficulties you'll probably face with the fact you are both far away from each other.  have a nice father's day everyone"
gayyoungold,3ahyvv,SieurLamond,2,Sun Jun 21 12:47:13 2015 UTC,"Older dude wont do all this travel for nothing in return...   He has friends in my home town, so we established over the phone that if I don't want to take things further, he can leave me and visit his friends for a nice weekend on his own. This won't end in a sauna or hotel room unless I want it to.   IMO, just a face in an email is not enough too.   Hence the phone call. We had a very easy time talking to each other and we both like the pics. Meeting up seems like a reasonable next step to take.   I see a lot of difficulties you'll probably face with the fact you are both far away from each other   A couple things here: 1. I'm a student, so I don't want to be devoting all of my time to a relationship anyways. I'm going to need to be free during weekdays to keep up with my studies, so I don't mind not seeing him every day. 2. It's very easy for him to travel. I go to school very far away from him, and he even mentioned that it could be possible for him to visit me there too. I think we would be able to see each other often enough for us both to be happy.  Overall, I think this is a good idea. I'm going to try it."

gayyoungold,39zww3,sdcrow,4,Tue Jun 16 03:28:48 2015 UTC,"You should have a discussion about it but it seems like you already know how he's going to react. To me, this is something worth confirming and laying out on the table.  Personally, I think that if he will be hurt about this (no matter what he says) and you know it, yet still want to go through with it, it's better to end the relationship. A discrepancy on a subject as intimate as sex and/or sex with other people never bodes well for a relationship. It will save him, and you, a lot of stress in the long term.  Opposite of that, have his doctors flat out said he can't use Viagra or something of the sort? It's also quite possible the stress from having two jobs and perhaps your expectations are making him nervous to the point that he can't perform or doesn't feel up to it. You say everything but sex is great, but has the dynamic changed?"
gayyoungold,39zww3,youyouyuyu,3,Tue Jun 16 03:46:30 2015 UTC,"I've got him to admit be would be  hurt, but he still feels like I deserve to have some sex. I don't consciously put any pressure or expectations on him, always let him know that I am not worried about sex, we'll figure something out, and that I love him. He was texting me saying I should consider finding some other guys to play with, to which I replied    if I started playing with other guys I'd need assurance that you were okay with it. And not just because you think I should be getting fucked more at my age , but because you are actually okay with it. I need to know that if you are having problems with it you would come to me. I'm not sure I would have that level of assurance over text or the phone or whatever.    He replied with    To be honest, I guess it would hurt part of me to have you giving of yourself to other guys, but...I have to change my way of thinking and feeling because of how I feel about you...how much I care about you...since I can't really give you ALL of what you need, then I have to ""let you go"" to pursue others who can.  But that's MY stuff, babe...not yours. Bottom line is I want you to be happy and fulfilled...   I think my issue isn't opening up the relationship, but knowing that he wouldn't suggest it if he didn't feel like he had to. I've assumed he's asked about Viagra, but don't actually know. I'll ask him about that next time I can."
gayyoungold,39zww3,dadnme,3,Tue Jun 16 04:13:59 2015 UTC,"It sounds like he really cares about you, and you care about him. Even if the sex is failing, would you want to stick with him?"
gayyoungold,39zww3,youyouyuyu,3,Tue Jun 16 04:50:51 2015 UTC,"We really do love each other, and I really want to be with him love him more than anything. I'm able to make it through the school year, I can do summer with minimal sex. Just wish he didn't seem reluctant/distant during sex recently."
gayyoungold,39zww3,RustyGuns,3,Tue Jun 16 06:01:54 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing that you probably already realize.   It's not only his thing; because you're a duo.  That kind of hurt will affect him in a big way, judging by what he's said. It might have a large effect on your relationship or not, but it will in some way.  And maybe he will change his way of thinking but it's entirely too soon. If you want to keep what you have I'd look at other options and let this issue evolve more naturally."

gayyoungold,39zww3,dadnme,3,Tue Jun 16 05:57:09 2015 UTC,"I dunno. To me it feels like he is setting you guys up to fail and sliding the problems onto the fact that YOU are not being satisfied.  When you mentioned how the last time you had sex HE made the effort to buy the dildo yet didn't execute any passion which left you unsatisfied. It made me think that he wants to show that it isn't working and at the same time show you that he is ""trying."" (sorry if that sounds blunt)  I could be way off with my opinion but that's what I am seeing. This may sound harsh but I think you may need to end it before he does get hurt from being in an open relationship. I feel like he could become resentful and it will change the dynamic of your relationship.  I hope you make a decision that is best for you. I'm sure you are an awesome person and you deserve that special someone."
gayyoungold,39zww3,youyouyuyu,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:48:00 2015 UTC,"I dunno. To me it feels like he is setting you guys up to fail and sliding the problems onto the fact that YOU are not being satisfied.  When you mentioned how the last time you had sex HE made the effort to buy the dildo yet didn't execute any passion which left you unsatisfied. It made me think that he wants to show that it isn't working and at the same time show you that he is ""trying."" (sorry if that sounds blunt)   Don't be sorry, I've thought the same thing. I do worry a lot though so I thought that was why. He may have been distant just because his libido is so low, but if someone is thinking the same thing I might need to be worried. I think, or thought, that our relationship was good besides this. I plan on talking to him the next time I see him, just not sure what to do. Thanks for the advice!"
gayyoungold,39zww3,daddybearsftw,2,Sat Jun 20 02:27:19 2015 UTC,Just remember. You deserve to be loved and to have someone that would do anything for you. You deserve someone that makes you feel happy by just being in their presence. :) hope it all works out!

I'm french and its hard for me to write things. I decided to close the account along with a daddy blog under a sudden impulse after a discussion with my partner. We felt it was a sterile hobby I got when I prefere doing internet things with multiple users like a forum. Afterward I though it would have been much more intelligent to tell everyone I'd close the account but you can't reopen your account on tumblr. Also, tumblr is not a place to discuss. I never found how to reply to people that was replying in a post...  So, all in all, I don't regret my decision but I'll surelly miss the interraction I got with some people and the 1300 followers."

I'm the kind of guy that close his account when he leaves somewhere to end business. I've grown tired of building a blog alone and felt that could be a better experience if that was not my main blog. Finding that forum, I realised there is a lot of other people, like you, that has different thoughts about AGR so I felt upset with the fact my blog was just representing my only voice answering questions and comments. I've also closed it cause I wanted to leave the place free if someone else want to take the flag and create a similar blog with a similar name. What I wrote could still be rewritten. The pictures I posted are all on the net somewhere else. The links I shared are easilly findable on google. If I restart a new blog with other guys, I could restart with the background of the first one and make publicity for the migration. Also, on tumblr, your main blog could not be shared between different users and you can't take your main blog and change it to the other kind of blog. To end, if I was just leaving the blog here, no update, I'm the kind of guy who will eventually be temtepted to return on the blog and restart that sterile hobby..."

I would soon after give him a chained gold necklace (nothing fancy).  For our wedding we had matching silver bands interlayered with a gold knotted pattern.  My husband has to wear his ring around a chain on his neck now because he has lost so much weight since we got married.  Got to get him to have that resized at some point."
gayyoungold,39r0tj,Whitedragon2,2,Tue Jun 16 14:36:05 2015 UTC,"hawwww, cute! How much does he lost and was it intentional?"
gayyoungold,39r0tj,Whitedragon2,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"I met him when he was over 400 lbs and he is now down to a little over 200lbs.  After about 2 years together he became very self-conscious about his weight even though it never bothered me.  I always found him sexy & beautiful but for health reasons he chose to have bypass surgery.  It went ok for a few years until he noticed weight coming back so he saw a post surgery specialist.  They set him up with vitamins, supplements, and suggestions for meals.  Now he eats mostly all protein and veggies/fruit plus he doesn't ""dump"" (a term for a sick feeling that comes on in bypass patients after they eat certain foods) as much anymore.  His whole change inspired me to start exercising regularly and eating better.  His goal is to get down to my weight and my goal is keep making it more difficult for him to reach my weight ;)  Though to be fair at this point I'm just shaving some fat off a little at a time and putting on muscle instead so not really losing weight anymore."
gayyoungold,39r0tj,Whitedragon2,2,Tue Jun 16 20:40:20 2015 UTC,Sorry if I was afk for a couple of days!!! Does your lover minds about his extra skin after loosing weight? My man went from 170bs to 131 at 67yo and he is really upset about his belly extra skin. Have you any suggestion to loose this hanging skin other than by surgery? We are doing gym together and he is doing a lot of abdominal exercieses already.
gayyoungold,39r0tj,Whitedragon2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:26:30 2015 UTC,"My husband has always been self conscious about his weight and body.  Even before he had the surgery he was not comfortable taking his shirt off in front of me and would always keep a white under T on at the very minimum.  But I try not to be pushy and force him to remove his shirt if he doesn't want to.  He trusts that I find him attractive and that seeing him without a shirt on won't change my view of him, but bearing that side of himself can be scary for him.  It might be the same way for your man.  Keep letting him know how hot you find him and I think he'll be less bothered by his extra skin.  My husband hasn't had much surgery to remove excess skin since the surgery (only a small neck one) and sadly doesn't exercise so he just puts up with it.  That fact that your man is exercising should help tighten up that skin over time.  Just know it will take months.  I know a guy who hits the gym 5 times a week to tighten up his excess skin and has been doing it for about 6 months now.  Its not a quick process.  For health reasons, my husband could probably get his arm fat removed or whatever and part of it would be covered by insurance.  But he hasn't and it doesn't change my view of him.  I still get caught staring at him all the time and that makes him feel good so I don't think he is in a rush to get that fat removed if he knows its not an issue to us.  I'd support him if he wanted to, but its his choice.  For now I'd just support your man and make him feel like this isn't an issue to you.  That you'll support him if he decides to have surgery and if he doesn't you'll still find him attractive.  Sorry I don't have more answers for you in dealing with loose skin.  Hopefully at least you have a little more insight into how he might feel about himself at least."
gayyoungold,39r0tj,mr_bartuc,2,Thu Jun 18 14:32:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Yes he is upset but we live naked together  and he knows my feelings for him and he knows I accept this. I think his problem is more in the eyes of any other persons (familly, friends, strangers) who might see him shirtless or naked (we are doing nudism no swinger). I'll try to work on his own perception of his body like you suggested. Thanks a lot."

gayyoungold,39gy6p,n_irish93,11,Thu Jun 11 17:23:25 2015 UTC,"I've had two boyfriends who introduced me to their parents. In both cases, there was a lot of initial doubt and turmoil, and then there was a lot of acceptance and love.  Just keep in mind that a lot of what your parents might say that seems hurtful is being said because they're trying to protect you. From the outside, an intergenerational relationship seems exploitative by default. It might take them a while to see that he genuinely cares for you and wants to make you happy.  Expect awkwardness, but just listen well and stay calm and remember that everybody there cares about you and it'll go great."
gayyoungold,39gy6p,Avunculous,3,Thu Jun 11 20:33:55 2015 UTC,"I introduced my bf to my parents in approx September or October of last year. In December we had a four-person sit down to address the elephant in the room--my mother's inability to accept my bf into our lives. It didn't go terribly, but my bf was caught up on my mother's belief that his being with me was ""immoral.""  Things have since cooled down and my mother seems to be warming up to him and the situation. So I'd say be patient. I know from experience how hard it is, but your family may surprise you."
gayyoungold,39gy6p,bisensual,3,Fri Jun 12 04:57:33 2015 UTC,Hope it goes well and expect some awkwardness at first.  I think you will find things go better than you expect since you already had your other sister meet him.  My older brother met my husband first before my husband met my parents so I imagine my brother told my parents about my husband.  I'm pretty sure that helped calm my parents and made the dinner with my husband easier.  Hopefully your other sister did the same so that perhaps the meeting this weekend will go better then you both expect ;)  Oh and my husband was my boyfriend at the time he met my family.  I think I might have made my comment a little confusing.

gayyoungold,39egdp,undercoverdudelover,6,Thu Jun 11 04:46:00 2015 UTC,"Congratulations, you've just taken your first step.   The safest way to explore your feelings is through online sites, and you literally did so writing this post. Whether that be dating sites, cam sites, chat rooms; these are the best places to start--and you don't even have to put your picture out there (although that probably makes it 10x easier in a lot of case). Remember, you're anonymous and you don't have to share anything your uncomfortable with.   Be genuine. There are a lot of older guys out there who do just want to chat. On the other hand, be warned, there are even more men who just want to get off. My advice would be to stick to what you're comfortable with and go slowly and cautiously. You're 18, there's time to grow and you most likely don't know exactly what you want. Hell, many of the men you encounter won't know what they want. Don't get pressured into revealing or doing anything you don't want.  I know you probably want to just meet someone you're attracted to, get it on, and go from there. In some cases that might be the best thing for you, and in some cases it's not; but that is a huge step to take. You'll get there eventually.  I can't say when but you'll grow into being comfortable with what you're attracted to. You already know it's going to be difficult but finding happiness isn't easy for anybody."

gayyoungold,39egdp,youyouyuyu,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:59:58 2015 UTC,It might be easier to just watch at first. But really a polite greeting is a great way to start talking to someone. Don't share anything other than a name and general location.
gayyoungold,39egdp,TProphet69,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:52:46 2015 UTC,"Don't do anything on chat and cam sites you don't want someone selling on a porn site. Also, there are a ton of people who will catfish you on snapchat and then post your pictures. Best to keep it PG-13 so you don't get blackmailed by revenge porn scammers later."
gayyoungold,39egdp,Avunculous,2,Sat Jul 18 22:15:43 2015 UTC,"It seems like you're a bit worried that older guys wouldn't be into guys your age. Some of us really, really are. You know how you have had crushes on your teachers? Well, I can't count the number of times I've been handed my change by some beautiful young guy who was making me weak in the knees.  Believe me, there's someone out there longing for you too.  In my experience, it's a lot easier meeting people online. Try the dating sites from the FAQ, but don't neglect Craigslist. In my experience, Craigslist is where people who don't really use the internet a lot go first, and a lot of people in the demographic you're interested in aren't particularly computer-savvy.  Here's the weird part. You're going to have to convince people that you're for real. Finding a beautiful young guy who's looking for an older guy is sort of like finding a unicorn in the housewares department at Sears. It can take a little while for some of us to come to grips with the fact that you exist.  (Posts like this really make my day, by the way. You really are out there! You're actively looking! You're adorably shy!)  I really hope you find who you're looking for. I think it's going to be wonderful for both of you."
gayyoungold,39egdp,Avunculous,2,Thu Jun 11 14:04:43 2015 UTC,"Aw, thanks! Glad my post made you happy (your comment definitely made me smile :) )  Visibility is probably my biggest problem right now. I'm somewhere halfway out of the closet (friends and family don't know, but I wouldn't mind presenting myself as gay to the outside world) so I'm still trying to figure out how to indicate my interest to guys I'm attracted to and develop a plan for coming out completely. Its good to hear though that there are older guys out there that would be interested in someone my age (for the sake of reassurance, let's just pretend I'm a stud). Just wish it were easier to find them!"
gayyoungold,39egdp,Kkokonut,2,Thu Jun 11 15:40:08 2015 UTC,"The question of how to get to a level of being out that you're comfortable with is something you'll be working on your whole life. As you move from job to job, place to place, or just get into different social situations, you'll be faced with questions about coming out over and over. It gets easier. But give up on ever coming out completely, unless you've got a major network TV show.  And about being a stud... there's no such thing as a universally attractive man. Some people would kick Chris Pratt out of bed. Some people (ehem) watch Supernatural for the incredibly sexy Osric Chau. You can find John Goodman porn without even trying. Personally, I've got a major thing for skinny guys. And short guys. And really tall guys. Average guys. But muscular studs are kind of meh.  I say this because I spent way too long at about your age convinced that I was totally unattractive. Whereas I see pictures of myself back then and realize that I was not only attractive, I was an idiot. I thought guys wouldn't be interested because I was all burly and hairy.  I'm still kicking myself. If I'd believed in myself at all, I could have found someone who was completely into me.  Go forth. Be your sexy self. Make some old guy ecstatically happy."
gayyoungold,39egdp,Avunculous,2,Thu Jun 11 17:13:26 2015 UTC,"burly and hairy   ahem um. H-hey.  Seriously though, thank you so much for your extremely kind words. I've heard the thing about having to continue to come out for every social group you join, and I've gotta be honest, it kind of bums me out. I'm dreading the day where I come out to my family and friends, not because I think they won't approve, but because I've seen the subtle differences in how they treat people they know are gay. It's weird. It's in the way they laugh a little too much every time the person says something sarcastically. It's how ""sarcastic"" becomes ""sassy."" It's in how my mom, an accepting lgbt supporter, laughs at Cam's antics on Modern Family and exclaims ""oh my god, he's so queer!"" I feel bad worrying about these things that are really quite insignificant when viewed with some perspective, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried. I'm grateful to live in a tolerant environment, but the prospect of coming out honestly paralyzes me.  Anyway, thanks for the vote of confidence. I can't stress enough how much this thread is lifting my spirits. You guys are some of the kindest and most sympathetic people I've ever found online, and it's nice to find a community where I don't feel like such a sexual aberrant for my tastes. You guys are the best."
gayyoungold,39egdp,Bearlvr,3,Thu Jun 11 18:09:59 2015 UTC,"Hey bud :) I'm 21, with two wonderful boyfriends in their 40s... I think I may be able to unveil some of the mystique about coming out in most social situations for you. I was in your shoes three years ago myself. :)  The long and the short of it is is that you will not have to come out everywhere. You're meeting with your boss about a work project? It probably doesn't matter that you like older men. You're spending some time with your friends, beating the crap out of each other on Halo? It probably doesn't matter that you like older men. You're spending time with your girl friends complaining about men? Well...it may be a bit more relevant then... ;)  It comes down to social context. I'm comfortable letting people know I'm gay, but that's not the first thing I try to let them know when they're getting to know me--it's simply not their business and usually has no place in our relationship at that point, professional or personal. If it becomes something I want to share with them, they're usually in my life longer than an evening and I have a chance to get to know them further, making the news much easier to share overall.  Now, if you're spending time with your man, yes people may pick up on you. But that's also out of how openly affectionate you are in public, whether they're really paying attention and whether they really care. Most people have too many troubles to worry about besides the young/old gays at table six bringing about the apocalypse. :) But even then, expect people to assume that you are anything but romantic partners--we are a minority of a minority community, I'm sad to say. But it's the truth.  <hugs> Congratulations to you!!! I know how scary it is starting out, but believe me when I say you are on the best path for your own happiness, my friend. I'm very happy for you."
gayyoungold,39egdp,Avunculous,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:31:18 2015 UTC,"ahem um. H-hey.   That's how you do it. ;)  So, you know the absolute worst you're going to be subjected to by your family when you come out. I mean, if that's how they behave when they don't know you're gay, it's not like they're going to get worse when you come out. They love you, after all.  Their perspective on you is going to change, and their perspective on gay people in general is probably going to change as well. It'll be a process that takes some time, but it sounds like their hearts are in the right place.  If you give them a chance to get to know who you really are, they have a chance to show you how much they really love you.  Yeah, this is a great place, isn't it? Makes you proud."

gayyoungold,39egdp,AZCigarGuy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:48:03 2015 UTC,"Haha, my high school was near a public pool, which we would sometimes visit in gym. All of my guy friends would joke amongst themselves about how gross it was to see all the older patrons disrobing in plain view of anyone in the locker room, and I feigned disgust along with them. But damn if that wasn't the best part of my day ;)  Not sure how I'd actually meet people there, though. As i mentioned in another comment I'm pretty timid about going up to older guys because I'm afraid they'll prove to be straight and react negatively to flirtation.  It also might help if I didn't look about 15 years old :/  Thanks for the advice though!"
gayyoungold,39egdp,pizzaforce3,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:08:08 2015 UTC,I would say it depends on what you are comfortable with. I met lots of guys your age on dating sites and for the most part had fun and met some really great people. I'm 44 and my bf of three years is 21...so he was your age when we met...and we met thru Jack'd. Most of the time my experiences with both Jack'd and Grindr were just one time hookups but quite a few developed into friendships (with benefits) and several boyfriends.  At your age the options are somewhat limited to dating sites and who you meet in public such as the grocery store etc...I would encourage you to speak your mind if you meet an older guy you think is gay that you have an interest in. Lots of times we older gents shy away from being forward with the younger crowd for fear of being rejected. My experience with younger guys has been very positive and rewarding for the most part and I am glad that I spoke up when I did. You will always have a 50/50 chance when you say hello and no chance at all if you stay quiet...just my 2 cents. Best of luck to you :-)
gayyoungold,39egdp,pizzaforce3,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:33:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I think my gaydar must be severely impaired, because I'm horrible at guessing whether someone is gay, especially with older fellows. I'm also a naive sucker who's fallen in love with strangers on public transportation more times than I can count, but I'm always afraid of the extreme likelihood that they're straight or in a relationship and would be offended by my advances.  So the fear of rejection goes both ways! How would you suggest connecting with people in public?"
gayyoungold,39egdp,alexvadaddybear,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:13:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's the art of cruising... there's this thing where you look at someone, then they look back and then you kinda do this for a few minutes until one person speaks up and says hello. Then you feel out the other person by dropping hints into the conversation and/or steering it towards the kinds of activities /bars the other person likes and drop in a gay bar or area you like to hang out in.  It's actually very scientific, based off of a hypothesis (I think this person is gay/interested ), a series of tests (if I smile and nod, will he nod back? If I say I like going to Chelsea , will he say he prefers the village), and small confirmations of results  until you have a large enough body of evidence to say one way or the other.  It's probably best practiced first in a safe space where you know there are gays before ever trying it in riskier traditionally straight settings."
gayyoungold,39egdp,Elusive0327,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:12:53 2015 UTC,"You could try looking in your area for more gay oriented public things like Pride Fest or a local Ren Faire that does a Pride Weekend, that sort of thing. Then at least you can be fairly certain about their sexuality and from there just be yourself. Say hello if you see a guy you find attractive. Even if they aren't interested in you it's a nice compliment to have someone flirt a little and maybe you will make a new friend or two. Lots of cities have online sites (for specific groups like gays and lesbians) that you can join and they meet up once a week or a couple of times a month as a group and do different things, go to museums etc...another good way to meet people. The more time you spend out and the less time you spend on the couch the more people you will meet :-)"
gayyoungold,39egdp,Elusive0327,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:09:44 2015 UTC,"Older guy here, niceta meecha!  Seriously,  You'll meet us older guys the same place you will meet normal, everyday people, because we are normal, everyday people, too.  We just happen, some of us, to be into younger guys.  Remember, with a little more life experience, we have learned patience and a willingness to let things work themselves out instead of jumping head-first into romantic ( or other) situations.  So, if you are looking for a romantic relationship instead of straightforward sexual encounters, take your time.  Remember, we rarely find men your age in our social circles, either.  Just develop interests, hobbies, and activities that cut across generational lines. (A good example is the kind of things that send men of all ages to the local Lowes, Home Depot, or other big box hardware store early on a weekend morning - woodworking, mechanical repairs, home improvement, gardening, yardwork, painting, etc.  Have you ever thought about getting a summer job doing 'odd jobs' and labor on people's yards, houses?  A lot of us older guys don't have the time to get these kinds of things done, and well, if you could come over and help...  But I digress.)  Sooner or later, you'll meet people of all ages who share your skills and interests.  Obviously, coming out makes things easier, but if you aren't ready, you aren't.  It's a big decision.  Meanwhile, just be yourself, enjoy life.  A little self-assurance and a little bit of a positive attitude go a long way.  Thanks for posting."
gayyoungold,39egdp,youyouyuyu,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:33:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!   I'd say I'm not really a ""home depot project"" kinda guy but that's certainly a good idea for a hobby that one could share with older men (and I won't lie, there's definitely some allure to a romance forged over power tools and work jeans ;) ). One of my biggest fears is that I'll click with a guy sexually but we'll have very few shared interests due to the age difference. Think I might take your advice and look into developing some more ""mature"" hobbies."
gayyoungold,39egdp,Whitedragon2,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:51:57 2015 UTC,"there's definitely some allure to a romance forged over power tools and work jeans ;)    And, there you go.  Picture your ideally outfitted male other.  Is he wearing jeans and a work shirt, sweating over a hand-hewn carving of wood?  Is he wearing a tailor-cut grey wool suit, as he drives his Mercedes to his job as investment banker?  Is he wearing a pair of swim shorts and a tight-fitting t-shirt as he suns himself at the beach?  Is he wearing a theatrical costume as he declaims onstage at the local playhouse?  Whatever your fantasy man, these are the hobbies you should aim towards cultivating; tools, stocks, surfing, or acting, respectively.  Also, remember that some of us older guys are not particularly tech-savvy, so retro activities such as board games and books would work, too.  As far as fears that you won't have shared interests with an older guy, remember that the idea is to have complementary talents, where one of you can mentor the other, rather than identical talents.  It would be unrealistic to expect that two guys with a wide age gap would have the exact same approach to work and hobbies, whereas it would be sweet to be able to help each other out in areas where the other is lacking.  For whatever it's worth, you sound like a real catch.  I would love to meet a guy like you.  Of course, I'm a bit shy too, and have this terrible problem of 'day-old gaydar.'  I'll have this random conversation with some cute young guy, and a day later, I'll come to the realization that we were checking each other out.  By then it's far too late.  So hang in there; sooner or later (I'll bet it's sooner) some guy will come along, you will click, and things will start happening.  Thanks for the reply."
gayyoungold,39egdp,Whitedragon2,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:37:08 2015 UTC,I met my hubby on silver daddies.com. He is 15 years younger than me. We've been together 7 years and married almost 4. My best to you!
gayyoungold,39egdp,WildlifeAnalysis,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:17:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a 19 year old gay guy. I recently met with older guys (only 2 by now) through some apps on my smartphone. They are in their early 40s, but I suspect the other one is more than that. Anyway, I met up with them basically just for ""fun"". My experiences with them were just till the third base... which was kind of frustrating because I felt like I was tricked and they pretty much did what they only wanted to do (very selfish of them LOL, or we were just really not a match). LOL. But they were actually nice, it's just I never really felt happy after it, it just felt like, ""oh ok, I just did that"". Do you think it's ok and just move on and forget about it, I'm not really regretting it but I kind of feel like I need to get with a younger guy just to make my self feel a little bit better.  Anyway, neither one of them is my first sexual encounter. I was always hesitant about meeting people from online but, I probably just got over by just really trying cause my testosterone was skyrocketing. I suggest you go for it, and just be direct with them with what your preferences are. I'm just sharing what I experienced and I wish the best of luck for you! ;)  P.S. This is my first Reddit post. I felt like doing an account for this thread. :D"
gayyoungold,39egdp,WildlifeAnalysis,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:49:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing! I appreciate the account of your experiences, as I don't really know what to expect. Obviously I'm no expert but it sounds to me like you just didn't click with the guys. I wouldn't worry too much about it.  Quick question: Do you feel comfortable uploading photos of your face to your account on these dating services? I'm just ultra paranoid that somehow my family, friends, or employers would find out. Do you have any advice on how to represent yourself on online dating profiles?"
gayyoungold,39egdp,TProphet69,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:19:40 2015 UTC,"I don't usually set my profile photos with my face on it. If I'm using an app which is sexually charged like Grindr or Jack'd, I just don't put my photo on it. What I do is I initiate conversations and if they're not an asshole(bunch of them on it), I do send pictures.  But if you're going to use a more wholesome dating services like Tinder, I'd say it's ok to put pictures on it. And if you see your family, friends, or anyone you know on any app you use, you should wonder why they're there. ;)  You can represent your self briefly like what your preferences are and probably a little bit about yourself. Because for me, I prefer chatting with the guy to get to know each other.  Here are some apps that I have used:  Grindr - Probably the easiest if you want to get laid ASAP. Jack'd - Hmm. It's ok. Haha Planet Romeo - Plenty of older guys checking out my profile. I have my face photo on it. Recon X - This is basically for the ones who are in BDSM and very kinky. Deleted mine after few days... but it was very interesting. LOL  And if you're going to be in college want to stay discreet, then don't put your face photo on it. But who knows, your professor might be on one of those. ;)  x, Elusive0327"
gayyoungold,394r8f,ShyLeoGing,4,Tue Jun 9 06:36:58 2015 UTC,"I suggest you just move on - stop the weekly dinners since they are keeping you trapped.  You loved this guy - great - but reality shows that he's just too complicated to deal with.  Don't try to figure out why- anyone f..ked up at 56 is not going to get it tigether.  You,personally, have nothing but good options going forward : get out and meet new people and give yourself a chance at happiness."
gayyoungold,394r8f,2scompany,5,Tue Jun 9 18:09:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry to ear about that. My opinion is you've been manipulated by an older dude who doesn't love you as a lover; he loves you cause you support him and his problems, carrying a bit on your own shoulders for him. The worst of your story is he still try to catch you via your naivity/lack of experience cause he knows you'll come back like his doggy. He probably still needs support of someone else to face his own life problems. You want to decrease your stress and anxiety and you want to get a life, forget him, he'll only lead you in the same toxic relation. It will be hard the first weeks/months but when you'll find friends or someone who loves you for what you are, that relation will already be far away in your life. Life is better when you are not manipulated, trust me. Finally, personally I won't go into an open relationship until years in a steady relation."

While this doesn't excuse his actions, I'm sure it has a part to play in his psychology with you.  I'd say the best thing to do is stay broken up with him as cheating is unacceptable, especially when you both discussed it. It's going to be harder to get over him if you keep seeing him on a friendly level,  and I might be taking pity on him, but I think what you're doing is appropriate--as long as you keep it on a friends basis and you're in the mindset of being friends and friends only..."

My advice to you then is to find a woman closely approximate to your age, marry her but don't have sex before the marriage, have 2.5 children, go to church on Sunday and make sure you mow the grass once a week.  There will still be people who don't approve so be sure to change to accommodate them as well.  That this won't make you happy is of no concern as long as the strangers around you approve of their choices for you.  My oldest sister thinks I should date men my own age since it would make me happier.  She's entitled to her opinion but I am sure not going to live my life to please her.  I like younger men because of what they have to offer, knowledge of the now world.  I have to offer experience from the then world.  Together we compliment each other's skills/knowledge and both grow.  It's a win, win.  Leading your life because of what others think/might think is a lose, lose."

His children (my age) were understandably upset when he first came out, but they came around. And if they hadn't, then fuck them too.   I had terrible social anxiety well into adulthood, and I think meeting my partner cured me of that. Yes, I was very uncomfortable at first, but once we found people who accepted us for who we are, I slowly but surely came out of my shell and now I wouldn't ever have done if differently even if I had the chance to. It's not always easy, and not everyone will accept you, but the right kind of people will.  Like I said, one life, one chance to live it the way YOU want to. If it wasn't meant to be, ok then, but if your just breaking up because of what others will think or what his kids will think, then that's very sad."
gayyoungold,392fmd,Buckwinn,2,Tue Jun 9 00:01:45 2015 UTC,"""as in people would not understand us as a couple because of our age difference.""  who cares? I mean you two do obviously, but generally, why do you guys care about what other people think?   I used to joke around with mine when I was 36/37, and he 18. The joke was ""they probably think you're my body guard..."" but that was just it, we joked about what we thought people would think. We actually didn't care. To me, on this subject, the only opinion that matters was his (and mine), well ours. I'm sure there were a lot of different combos of who we are to other people, but we weren't going to rack our heads trying to figure what those were. Why? What good would it do to wonder what other people think, with the very limited information they have. Or go out of our way to please strangers that we'd probably never see again by denying ourselves.  I'm actually surprised he felt this way too, seeing he's the older one. So unless these concerned people are contributing in your lives in a positive way, and what their offering you is more valuable than your love, well, here we are. The only people that make a difference in my life get a say in it."

You can't imagine how stressed I was. You know what? Everyone accept us for what I know of. Well, at least they are all very friendly with me and considere us an happy couple. The thing I can't understand here is you both choose to lose your wonderfull love relation cause of his familly. What is love? What was the real problem? Are you independant? Does his children are adult and independent? He was out? You already met his children? Well, I can't understand everything of your situation cause this is just another forum post and I don't know your real life...

A certain amount of hesitation is normal, but once you've visited a bathhouse you'll more than likely return.  It's been my experience that there are usually good numbers of daddies at the baths.  I agree that some of the bathhouses in the US are a little seedy; some really nice, some aren't,  but I've visited many baths-----scores, maybe hundreds of times----- and have never seen anything that approached unsafe.

Sure, there might be some clues that would lead you to believe they're kind of jerky, but we tend to give people the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he's having a bad day. He's never going to be like that to me.  We figure it out eventually, and move on. Give yourself credit for getting out of there before he turned his jerkiness on you."

On the outside he was this amazingly sweet, sexy, muscular guy who had it all. After moving in with him I realized he was a self centred, manipulative, insecure, controlling, psychopath. Slowly the picture he painted of himself came apart and I saw who he truly was.   He also helped me realize that age does not mean a person is mature and is guaranteed to have their shit together. I used to view age as this pillar of wisdom. But thankfully I now know age has nothing to do with it and it's all about the person and their values."

His douchebaggery behaviors could be just a cover for an internal avoided questions. In countrepart, he enjoys to spend time with a young man he could had maybe as his son or could have been with in a relationship instead. A guy who shares the same interest. Not sure if he was assuming he was gay he were treating you like he does with that woman. But ""straight"" like he is, sure you probably wont see him having an introspection on his sexual orientation cause too homo.   I don't get why you says you are always attracted to jerks. What attracts you? The body, the personality or the way he acts in public (like very manly)? There, imo, you have to search in your own values what you want in your life. Like youyouyuyu says, if you like the bodybuilder type of men who cares a lot of his body or the guy who loves to show pictures of him naked on the net, you could also fall on someone more or less egocentric.

gayyoungold,37yf5z,dogbrainv,3,Sun May 31 14:51:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly. We really can't approach young guys, because if we're wrong and they're not checking us out, it comes off as super-duper-intensely-creepy-weird.  Whereas if a hot young guy makes a pass at an older guy, it's a compliment."

That being said, I get myself to a point where I could talk to a 10 and still have confidence to talk to him, and then I make my move.  Haha, I recently met this guy. I had to come over and talk to him twice before I let loose (he was very drunk, while I sort of out there). That night in particular isn't very interesting, but the following weekend, we had a lot of smoking hot activities all night long.  If I wasn't half the globe around for a year abroad in my studies, I'd man up and ask him out on a proper date....  He was a truly 9 in my book and I'd be lucky to have him :'-("

There was that man  at work I noticed, he works in a complete different department with nobody I know. The spitting image of Hugh Bonneville somehow and with a terrible voice that made me melt in my underpants. We exanched long glances a couple of times at the cafeteria during lunch time and that was awkward... his eyes were sometime saying ""I know what you want"" and other times ""stop that, you disturbe me, I'm straight"". So, I found my actual partner and this man is still working at the same department, have done babbling on me but I don't care much... That explain how I work to attract men.

One time I saw this 10/10 daddy at a bar. Hottest man EVER in my book. We'd chatted online before and he thought I was hot too. Before I went up to talk to him I was sitting down with my friends and I was so nervous my lips started quivering. To which my friends openly made fun of me for and still do til this day. BUT I did go up and talk to him and had a really good time once I did. For me it's everything before the actual approaching/initial talking-to that is the worst."

I didn't know what to do. We were in a shoe store, so I continued browsing with my smile that wouldn't go away.   I regret very much not going up to talk to him. I had posted on Craigslist missed connections, but no luck. I will take this as a lesson that when a gorgeous daddy locks eyes with you and shares a big smile with you, its a pretty damn good time to go up and talk with him."

Maybe it's easier because I'm always think of ways to serve random guys before I chat them up ... so that usually leads to me thinking of small things to do for them as a way of introducing myself.

I had my older partner passed earlier this year and it was pretty terrible, basically just dropped dead from a heart attack one day with no indication beforehand. My biggest lesson is enjoy the moments and days you are together. Don't stress on the future and what might happen, just enjoy what is happening. Because you never know what's to come.   Watch ""A Single Man"", it's a great movie about the opposite senario of an older guy losing his younger partner."

I just don't spend my time worrying about it.  We took steps to ensure a good life for our kids and each other if something should ever happen so that gives me some comfort.  Plus I'd rather go spend time with my husband or plan stuff for us to do instead of worrying about what might or might not happen one day.  There is always the chance I could go first so I would suggest you not focus on that sad thought and find more positive things to think about instead.

He is in his early 60's, so in about 10 years there might be some trouble on the way. I choose this, and I love him so dearly, it's accepted by both him and me.  In the past weekend I was at a party where I met a straight couple who differ only (lol) 20 years. She is 55, he is 75. He was declining, fast. Last year that I've met them they both seemed fine and happy. At the party he was only able to sit and listen. He gained a lot of weight, doesn't walk that easy anymore. Seeing this made me scared as hell, like, there is a chance I might be in the same situation. It scared me.   I know that because of our love for eachother we accept this, but it got us talking about it again, making preparations. We might even move to a house with just 1 floor, just in case. It was a wake up call, but not in the sense to end it. Scary thoughts, but we realised we must enjoy this while it lasts, do superfun stuff together and enjoy every minute of it. Hope this helps."

The idea that we cant spend our retirements together unless I dont work or science lets people live to 130 years old is scary. Living without him is scary since I moved out of state to live with him (to live in a city with a great job market for myself so its good anyways) and as a result lost a lot of friends I havent regained. I fear being alone without him.  What gets me through is realizing that i will make more friends, i could always find a second love, I could always die before him, etc. But i also have to think, im only attractive to guys over 45 usually, im going to potentially be hurt by death unless I just have flings until im the same age as my potential partner and sacrifice any relationship happiness in the meantime.

It's worth preparing for this (and it's likely to happen with a 20 year age gap), but it's not always a foregone conclusion. That being said, it's something that needs to be accepted by both people in a relationship or it's not going to work. Major consideration for me, usually dating guys in their 20s."
gayyoungold,37h4nc,TJRhymin,3,Wed May 27 16:23:19 2015 UTC,"Just did my shot at this, I'm a big fan of flags so this was fun for me and my man. Drawing on  SieurLamond's design with green and blue meeting at turquoise. The turquoise bar is largest signifying that the relationship and what's been created by the two colors meeting is the most important part.   For firewerx's comment on colors, the green and blue are from the current Pride flag and the Turquoise is taken from the original pride flag. The top and bottom are Hunter Green, which is the color that symbolizes Daddy and Daddy's Boy in the Hanky Code.   To address the need for a symbol, I went with a Greek concept to show that our kind of love in the community has always been around. It also represents the relationship in ancient Greece between Erastes (older male tutor and suitor) and Eromenos (younger male student and beloved). Olive wreaths symbolize both peace and victory. We have to fight for people to see validity in our relationships that bring us so much external and internal peace.  Both branches are interconnected to symbolize the union between the generations at the bottom and reaching toward each other at the top. The circular nature of the wreath is a suggestion of an unbroken bond. The larger of the two has 8 leaves with the colors representing the original 8 on the first pride flag. This represents the history of our GLBT community as a whole that the older in the relationship has lived through and passes on to the younger. The silver color denotes stability, wisdom, and age. The smaller branch has the colors of the modern flag and less leaves, showing that they are the next generation and still have room to grow. Gold symbolizes the boldness and exuberance of youth and how they are treasured by their older counterpart.   What does everyone think?"
gayyoungold,37h4nc,firewerx,3,Wed May 27 16:34:06 2015 UTC,"I like the multiple stripes of varying sizes and the colors you chose, but I don't like the olive wreaths.  I think they're a over-the-top and unnecessary; the flag would look good without it.  I also think they make the flag too Western-centric, when our community is world-wide and any flag or symbol for us should be as universal as possible."
gayyoungold,37h4nc,firewerx,1 point,Wed May 27 16:47:45 2015 UTC,"I had also played with one solid silver and one solid gold. Using the different colors was to address the issue of inclusion across all societies, like the Bear Flag has colors for every color of bear with the sole purpose of being inclusive.

gayyoungold,37h4nc,SieurLamond,1 point,Wed May 27 20:30:02 2015 UTC,"For some of us this is a community and how we live our lives, not just a sexual preference. We see the need for a flag the same as every other part of the GLBT community and the GLBT community as a whole did and do."
gayyoungold,37h4nc,505yawaworht,2,Wed May 27 20:38:02 2015 UTC,Interesting. Don't take this the wrong way but I like how it doesn't define me.

Don't get me wrong, I turn my nose up at some of the shit he likes and vice versa, but we can find common ground in some things. And it would seem that love fills in the rest. I watch vapid TV for him and he watches boring European indie films for me.  How do you feel towards him?  It took me a while to know I was in love and then everything fell into place.

gayyoungold,37baq0,Whitedragon2,1 point,Tue May 26 23:23:17 2015 UTC,"I like the simplicity of an hourglass, and the endless Days of Our Lives references you can imbue that with. But it kind of implies that time is running out, too. The main purpose of an hourglass is a countdown."
gayyoungold,37baq0,CatbellyDeathtrap,2,Wed May 27 16:40:49 2015 UTC,"Indeed it does, reminding us how precious our time with loved ones is so we can cherish it.  I know the mortality an hourglass implies might make some uneasy but I always felt it reminded me to enjoy the love I have now.  All good things come to end which is why our time is precious.    Appreciate the perspective you gave.  I probably have been thinking about this hourglass symbol all the more recently because my husband's younger sister is not doing well health wise so time is something we have both been discussing often as of late."
gayyoungold,37baq0,TJRhymin,1 point,Wed May 27 17:04:02 2015 UTC,Sorry to hear about your husband's sister. I guess there's two ways to think about time as something to be cherished or worry about.

It wasn't offensive or hurtful, but it was distracting and not humorous. The third time is a charm and all, but perhaps you should reevaluate what you offer as humor.  Learn your audience. People come to this sub seeking advice and a community for relationships that do struggle for social acceptance. Often that's because of age disparity and occasionally it's because of racial concerns. Perhaps even both. It's seems fairly obvious that folks will read your post with concern and immediately seek to consider similar experiences and offer advice. They'll likely not be in a state of mind to recognize your joke, nor to find it amusing when you reveal it to be an adolescent bait and switch.  Generally speaking, if the only thing that differentiates your post from a serious matter is a ""ba dum ba"" at the end, it's not a joke that's going to land. There's a reason that the rimshot you're emulating with that phrase is classically associated with bad jokes. They're bad."

gayyoungold,376d0f,RustyGuns,-2,Wed May 27 22:16:52 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but I disagree. Life is not as serious as you seem to think. I offer my experience on a regular basis. Often, nobody seems to give a fuck but I can tell you that I have been in a successful ig relationship with a 40 year age gap for 10 years now.   I've lived through shame and guilt etc. I came out to my family. I'm out at work. I've lived with the shame of my partner and helped him to incrementally overcome it.   The most important factor in the success of my relationship is not caring what other people thought about it. Genuinely not caring at all. Luckily we live in a time where our lives aren't in danger and we are really unlikely to be discriminated against (at least in the Northeast USA).   But yeah, my experience is valuable too. And humor is a critical element so fuck off."

gayyoungold,36xk1d,srslyflustered,10,Fri May 22 23:10:35 2015 UTC,"It does seem to be all the rage these days, and it leaves monogamists like you and me feeling frustrated and left out in the cold."
gayyoungold,36xk1d,footnotefour,6,Fri May 22 23:23:09 2015 UTC,"When I was younger I though that monogamy was the only way for me.  It was because that was the way I was taught growing up as a norm for heterosexual relationships.  In my early 20s I met the man of my dreams and we were very much monogamous. After 15 years it didn't seem so important anymore.  I think a lot of people eventually break up because they want more sexually but the relationship doesn't permit it.  There is nothing wrong with monogamy. But I think the older you get, the less you tend to be tied to it.  So, its not surprising that a younger man wanting monogamy is frustrated by the lack of older men who want the same thing."
gayyoungold,36xk1d,buscoamigos,3,Sat May 23 05:09:45 2015 UTC,"This. I can't stress enough to my straight friends that a homosexual relationship is not the same as a heterosexual one.   We have been together for nearly 10 years, the first 6 monogamous. I was 24, he was 34. (9 years, 10 month age difference).  We went on a gay cruise, there were many older couples. After making friends and talking, we discovered that a lot of the issues we had was because we were a gay couple specifically, and were trying to fix them with the morality compass of heterosexual standards for relationships.   Our relationship flourished since then. We are in an open relationship of sorts, which has been for the most part one of us going ""want to fool around with someone?"" about every 6 months.   Removing the worries about potentially cheating has been amazing. He doesn't come home looking guilty because someone gave him a number. Instead we discuss it, like rational adults."
gayyoungold,36xk1d,motionmatrix,1 point,Sat May 23 13:39:59 2015 UTC,"This I think is the biggest blessing that we're given as gay people, we get to create our own mold we don't have to ascribe to all of the dogma and expectations that heterosexual couples do. And the best part is, if what you want is the heterosexual mold, you can do that, too!"
gayyoungold,36xk1d,TJRhymin,4,Wed May 27 20:32:19 2015 UTC,"I'm completely with you on this. It's the most frustrating part about being a gay male for me. That and I find it impossible to find a date, but that's just me.  A couple of times good friends of mine in open relationships have shown interest in me but for some reason this depresses me and accents my own loneliness. That and I really can't do sex casually like that."
gayyoungold,36xk1d,kuroguma,2,Sat May 23 00:07:40 2015 UTC,"Could be lots of reasons.  For some people, they're just naturally aware that they're horn-dogs and want to be up front about it rather than rope you into a relationship only to have you find out later when you're invested.  At least this way, you know what you're getting into.  For others, it could be a ""lesson learned"" kind of thing.  A friend of mine was in a relationship with someone for 17 years, until he found out the other guy had cheated on him.  Though they broke up, it made him change his ideas on relationships.  He now feels that he'd rather give others (and himself) the ability to find sex outside a relationship than potentially ruin a good thing over a fling.    There are a thousand different reasons why people might want an open relationship, just as there are reasons for them to vehemently be against them.  As with everything, you just gotta find the lid to your kettle!  As an aside, I've found many couples who spout off about how bad open relationships are and how ""those gays"" are ruining the community, only to have them both secretly proposition me later without their partner knowing.  People are complex and weird and in the end, you never know what you're getting with someone until you really get to know them."
gayyoungold,36xk1d,NotRemotelyTiredzZzZ,2,Sat May 23 12:15:48 2015 UTC,"Well I don't think you are being silly at all.  My husband and I have been in a monogamous relationship for 14 years now.  We both originally met as just a hook up, but that quickly blossomed into a very deep connection that neither of us expected.  He asked me to go steady and I agreed without a second thought.  Now with two kids we both still feel very attracted to each other with no urges to play around with others.  We have talked about this issue so if either of us ever felt unsatisfied we would discuss it, but for now the only guys we are interested in is each other.  And we couldn't be happier :)"

gayyoungold,36xk1d,Deiterrc,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:20:39 2015 UTC,"I've found the opposite really. That most men I date are completely appalled of the idea of having an open relationship. I think it comes down to it being an excuse really. I found that throughout college I wanted a man but ""all of them are boring/not hot/not enough in common/don't want what I want in a relationship"". I'm not saying it is for you, but I found that the reason I noticed so many things about the dating pool I didn't like was because I was unhappy with myself and it made it easier to feel justified in why I was involuntarily single.  Then I found a man I fell in love with and still hated myself and had to accept what I've said above. Like I said I don't mean to imply that that's what's true for you, but in my experience there are WAY more men complaining that no one wants a monogamous relationship than there are men who want an open relationship."

Note that not every relationship will last through every change that the participants go through, though some do. This is as it should be."
gayyoungold,36jlko,nutsaq,8,Tue May 19 21:52:33 2015 UTC,"You guys need to sit down and discuss this.  As you age you are going to get hair where it never grew before and will thin out in other areas.  He should know that this change is natural and your body is yours.  He needs to adjust, you can adjust if you choose.  As an older, I prefer smooth, but if the younger decides to go hairy, it is his decision."
gayyoungold,36jlko,FriesBaconNaked501,2,Tue May 19 22:56:34 2015 UTC,"We have talked about it a few times, but as I've mentioned, he likes me smooth, dislikes it openly when I'm not. I really can't change the way I look (I would if I could!). I can trim every so often but would hate to do it every week or so. Plus I'm beginning to like hairy me, just the way that I like the hairy version of him.   : /"
gayyoungold,36jlko,FriesBaconNaked501,2,Wed May 20 20:02:56 2015 UTC,"I understand how you feel.  I went hairy for the winter, then, for trips to Palm Springs, Phoenix and Las Vegas starting in late February, I went smooth, shaving completely most days.  This week I decided to move back with haired, with a little shaving.  Shaving all-over, all the time, is a serious undertaking and is expensive when you consider blades and lather, especially gel.  I'm quite comfortable with hairy, but smooth sometimes satisfies me.  Some how, some way, he is going to have to accept your decision.  Constant bitching and snide remarks are an indication of contempt, which is a sure-fire destroyer of a relationship."
gayyoungold,36jlko,RustyGuns,3,Wed May 20 21:39:35 2015 UTC,"I can see where is he going with that. I mean, if my partner shaved all of his chest and arm hair I would be kinda disappointed. I usually always make a silly joke whenever he trims since I prefer more hair but when you are in love those kinds of changes are pretty insignificant. I would talk to him about it and tell him how you feel. Personally I would like to shave if I did grow some hair because I like to make my partner happy, and it's hot to me to be more attractive to him.   The thing is, if I didn't want to shave I would just tell him how I feel about his comments and that the hair is going to stay. If he loves you it will just be a little speed bump in your journey together."
gayyoungold,36jlko,Robolabo,2,Wed May 20 01:11:58 2015 UTC,"Talk about it. Is there a potential middle ground? Shaving is a lot of work and takes a lot of time, could you trim instead?"

gayyoungold,36btn5,3wrquest,3,Mon May 18 02:56:41 2015 UTC,"This is something I have a lot of experience in. I was in a three way relationship for two years. I was 19 and they were 50 and 54. It had its ups and downs but honestly it takes three really strong individuals to make a three way relationship work, which is why mine failed. The two older guys had been together for 15+ years and fallen out of love and I was essentially the glue that kept them together.   The sex was super intense and hot. They were into dominating me and making me their ""boy"" in the bed. I had never tried that before and immediately fell in love. We used ropes, bandanas and various types of gear. That feeling of totally giving up all your power and trusting it into two older masculine guys that you love is really powerful. They were the first people I felt 100% comfortable in bed with. Again, the sex was crazy, passionate, and daily (my ass was so sore but I loved it. It was like a reminder of the night before).   On the down side there was jealousy, fighting and this constant unsettling feeling because you wanted to make sure everyone had received equal attention. One of the guys turned out to be extremely insecure and quite full of himself. If he wasn't happy, no one was. This created a really toxic environment.   If you have any questions relating directly to my history I would be more than happy to answer them. :)   Make sure you really understand what each person wants to get out of the relationship and see if you entering into their lives will ""complete"" them.    Edit: I just read that you are not really into one of the guys. This relationship will not work. The younger guy will eventually see that you favor the other and you will run into complications. Unless the younger is ok with you showing his older partner more attention."
gayyoungold,36btn5,RustyGuns,2,Mon May 18 22:47:44 2015 UTC,"They can obviously work, because there are people in successful polygamous relationships. However, the question you mean to ask: ""Will it work for me"", is less optimistic. You're less attracted (if attracted at all) to the younger man, and that's going to impose an unhealthy dynamic to the relationship. That's not to say it's impossible for the relationship to work, but it sharply decreases the likelihood of it working, while also increasing the difficulties that'll be involved (jealousy)."

Refusing to discuss it however, is ignoring one of the most important skills in a relationship: communication. I know how hard it is to believe that he'd let the relationship die on the vine like this, but that's precisely what he's doing, actively and through neglect. My recommendation is to make it clear that you are making the moves to leave and why. Then, do it.   Edit: misspelling"

Usually we only had sex on the weekends, at that point.  Eventually, I got a little annoyed at it (at both he and myself, since we were both to blame) and talked to him about it.  We both promised to stop the self-pleasure and only get off with one another, and since then, our sex life is back to being awesome.  Point I'm trying to make is, when you bring up something that's bothering you about the relationship, whether it be about sex, chores -- whatever, your partner should be willing to listen, understand, and hopefully work toward a solution that is fair to the both of you.  If he's not, that's a sign of an underlying issue that far outweighs not getting laid.

You really need to talk to him about opening things up for more excitement.  It's your idea, as I understand it, so you'll have to own the jealousy and manage the drama.  This issue isn't uncommon in young/old relationships because the fact is that as we age our ability to obtain/sustain does typically diminish.  Consider how you would react when you're older."
gayyoungold,367j1b,FriesBaconNaked501,1 point,Sun May 17 11:48:39 2015 UTC,"For me, this statement stands out more than anything else, when you say ""I'm still so young and not super experienced and comfortable as a gay man."" If you're not comfortable yet in your gay skin, you'll never be able to be the partner that someone else deserves.   As far as an open relationship and being sexually adventurous in general, (Full Disclosure: My SO and I play together with others, but not separate, and we have far from a perfect relationship) If it would give you that - punch to the gut - I can't believe you would do this to me - I'm so hurt - feeling if he were to be with someone else, than that gives you a good idea of how he'd feel seeing you with someone else."

I have been looking for a long time where I am and I have a hard time finding youngers who are interested. 😢 Personally I am very against open relationship. If your basis for an open relationship is because he cannot get hard, you know there is something called Viagra or Cialis ,  eh?  He just needs to go to his doctor for a prescription. In his case, he has every legitimate reason to get some. There are also many herbal supplements out there that are as effective as Viagra but much cheaper."

gayyoungold,363xpj,dogbrainv,3,Fri May 15 23:21:40 2015 UTC,"There is always the Viagra, Levitra and Cialis option.  The main difference seems to be the duration of their effects.  Viagra, allegedly last like 8 hours......longer for me.  Levitra; longer yet, and Cialis is supposed to last a few days.  In a lot of cases they actually do work.  Now the bad news.  All three have side effects like headache, stuffy nose, upset stomach, poor night vision.............I get all of the above, so it's not so pleasant.  The best option is Viagra because the effect doesn't last as long.  The over the counter remedies actually work:  This includes ""Super Hard"", ""ExTenz"", etc, etc, but they seem to have the same side effects.  For special occasions I sometimes take about a fourth of a tab of ""Super Hard"" and a quarter of Levitra, and if the sex is especially stimulating it works nicely.  Take it a few hours ahead of time, spray your nose with Afrin to keep from being all stuffy, take a couple Tylenol for the headache and have a full stomach or at least some food.  See how it works.  Good luck; he's not alone on this."

Improved my staying power & no to less anxiety induced ED. Of course I watch almost zero porn too. But the only downside is that cannot get a BJ before fucking.

Enjoy his friendship and advice (and hookups) even if it doesn't become anything romantic. You're young enough that there are PLENTY of other guys in your future, and you still have so much exploring and living to do. Who knows, maybe you'll become friends with his new man, too. I was in your position not too long ago...I was dating a daddy-type when I was 19 and wanted to steer the relationship into more serious waters. I'm glad my guy put the brakes on it, because even though we still remain close friends to this day and I know he always has my back, being single during those years allowed me to explore life in invaluable ways."

The boyfriend, Bill, said that he thought it was great that the daddy was being a mentor for a ""good cubby like me"".  He seems like an okay guy with the very few messages we sent to each other. He sent me this message also:  Well, just remember that one of the best things we can do in this world is to spread wisdom, compassion, and love :-)  So he seems nice. I dont know what the daddy told him about me."
gayyoungold,35wx3b,FriesBaconNaked501,4,Thu May 14 14:36:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I can tell you from my experience with older guys. I started meeting guys in their 50s when I was your age. And I got pretty attached to a few and I would be very hurt when they wouldn't want something more serious (I'm kind of a romantic). But now, at age 35, I understand where they're coming from. People in their 50s most likely are looking for something stable, someone they can settle down with, travel with, build a life with. From your daddy's perspective, he probably feels like it would be unfair to put you in that position. You're just starting college, building a life and career of your own. To expect you to drop all that to dedicate yourself to a life with him probably feels wrong to him. And rightfully so. If you guys are meant to be together, it will happen, but in the meantime go to college. Build your career. Have fun, but create a situation so that when you reach your late 20s and 30s you'll be be financially and emotionally secure enough to really build a life with someone; things like buying a house together, traveling the world together, creating long lasting memories together. I wish I could go back in time and tell my younger self this. At 35, I have a very fun and rewarding life that I share with my 51 year old partner. But it took many years to get to the point where this was really possible; more than it should have. Anyway, sorry to ramble. Hope some of this helps!"
gayyoungold,35xjay,Xthreat,9,Thu May 14 10:14:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah fair enough, makes me uncomfortable also, there is no place for it in my life either etc  You don't relate to this dynamic...therefore... you do not have to call your partener daddy. Case closed. I don't even know why you lead with this.  Looking for a 'rational reason' regarding anything sexual is a dead end. You clearly don't understand the appeal, neither do I, but somehow i refrained from shitting on people's tastes because of it.  Tell me you see the irony in someone like YOU actively ridiculing what is essentially a harmless variation of sexual dynamic because it makes you uncomfortable.   Half the planet thinks you kissing your old man bf is really strange and creepy... cut it out son."

I see it as a dominant term that is kinda hot. But as others have mentioned different strokes for different folks.

gayyoungold,35xjay,serisho,1 point,Thu May 14 17:46:55 2015 UTC,"My older half is Latino, too. And you're right it does mean something very different calling them Papa, Papi, Papito, it's actually a very high compliment of your affection for someone and should only be taken as a compliment. Not going to lie, when I first moved to Miami years ago, this was something that bothered me as a gringo. You only call one person in your life Papa or Mama as a white person and it's a very loaded term."

I personally don't care for being called ""daddy"" and being called ""hun"" doesn't set well with me.

gayyoungold,35xjay,samuel33334,2,Fri May 15 00:43:52 2015 UTC,"The way I understand and explain is fairly simple. In English, words can have multiple meanings. In a relationship, some people call their significant other 'daddy'. Weird, taboo, whatever, we're adults here and we're moving past that.  In this context, ""daddy"" doesn't mean your paternal figure. It's just a pet term, perhaps with feelings attached. A similar (and more accepted term, by the way) is the word ""baby"". Now, it's easy to explain that when people call their significant other ""baby"", they don't literally mean their significant other is a baby. They don't mean they're a pedophile. It's just a pet term. Sure, it's a loaded term, that denotes attachment, a bond, sexual energy, whatever, but it isn't a literal term.  Hopefully this explanation helps.  Edit:  PS, you don't have to call your partner baby, daddy or ANY pet name you don't want to. You can also request a partner to not call you a certain name, if you'd like. There's nothing wrong with that. However, the point of this post is that pet names aren't a huge deal, and to understand that they shouldn't be taken literally."

Even before I met my husband I would ask the older guys I met not to use those terms.  That might be due to me having a good relationship with my Dad but who knows.

gayyoungold,35oyo7,FriesBaconNaked501,2,Tue May 12 13:05:53 2015 UTC,"Partner (65) and I (28) have been together for about 2 years.  All of our professional, personal, and familial relations know we are gay and in a relationship.  Reactions are mostly supportive, overwhelming accepting, and sometimes indifferent.  Was initially surprised because we live in Oklahoma but we are both heavily involved in community development projects, nonprofit boards, civic orgs, church, CoC, and are outspoken in our careers (I'm a lawyer & he is a financial advisor).  I'm sure there are people who have objections to our relationship but their distorted conception of morality doesn't feed homeless people, provide shelters for battered women, rehabilitate drug addicts, restore historic buildings, build community centers, etc.    So yeah...I agree with /u/FriesBaconNaked501...if someone's lazy, ill-informed opinion is that we are disgusting, they can fuck off."

gayyoungold,35oyo7,Chris-in-WA,2,Tue May 12 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds like me, OP! Except my friends know about my 40 years older BF, and have said hi to him. Most of my other friends know I'm gay and into older guys, but not how old. Nobody seems to have an issue(most of my friends are male creative types), or at least don't tell me so to my face. It seems more like it's a personal quirk to them and nothing to care about beyond being gay,which seems to be the main issue if we talk about it. I think you can let it slip if it's natural in conversation without feeling too self-conscious."
gayyoungold,35oyo7,unironedelephant,2,Tue May 12 12:07:21 2015 UTC,"I'm very happy with my situation because my family and friends are all well aware that I'm married to an older guy.  My family welcomes him to all events and gatherings.  He gets along well with just about everyone and nobody has ever said something insulting to us or made us feel like we are doing something wrong.  I find that impressive since my father's family are very catholic.  I'm sure my mother would be the first one to verbally rip them a new one if anyone made us feel unwelcomed.  I was not willing to come out to my family or friends until I found a guy I wanted to have serious relationship with.  Before that i kept my love life to myself and everyone was okay with that.  My now husband made me feel so wonderful that I did get inspired to tell my parents and let them meet him.  My friends...well I never really told them I was gay but they kind of started to figure it out after we had been living together for over 5 years.  Some I have told directly but unless it comes up I don't outright say I'm gay.  The must know from the way I talk about my husband and our kids that we are a family.  Plus I did tell all my friends when we got married, legally, in our state a few years back."

gayyoungold,359oql,Panasianman,7,Fri May 8 23:39:00 2015 UTC,"There's really nothing wrong with accepting the position and seeing how it works out.  It could be a win-win.  Obviously, because of their ages (both are younger than me), the job won't be for the rest of your life, but they will benefit by your being there.  If you decide to move on and start a family, the option will be there and keeping in mind that nothing is forever.  It may be prudent to get the arrangement in writing.  Realistically, there's no reason for house guests to be made aware of the relationship.    I think accepting the arrangement, getting it in writing, maintaining privacy and having a trial period would be a good way to go."

No self-worth, nothing gained for yourself, nothing earned, nothing worked for. A waste of a human being. You will regret it.  Short-term it's a fantasy, but long-term it's a disaster.  This comes off as one of those things that sound like an awesome idea while you're horny, but the moment you masturbate or get a release, it doesn't seem so great anymore.  They have families to take care of, who says you'll actually get anything? Pass. Fuckin' pass. My life is worth more, personally."

gayyoungold,354hk9,Texanyounger4older,13,Thu May 7 01:03:10 2015 UTC,I find it odd that there seems to be a second coming out for some people when they like older men (bears sometimes too).    Just own it. There should be no more shame or guilt for that than there should be for the fact that you are gay.
gayyoungold,354hk9,tdbutler,7,Thu May 7 04:01:18 2015 UTC,"No, it feels like the most natural and right thing to me."
gayyoungold,354hk9,youyouyuyu,4,Thu May 7 02:43:49 2015 UTC,"This same feeling hit after my first gay encounter. You go through your whole life hearing how one should act and go totally against the societal norms. Not only for being gay, but liking older guys to boot, gasp. It gets easier with some good soul searching and time. Easier for some then others, but in the end you've got to go with your heart. Else you're just living your life as society/your parents/family want or how you feel they would want. The guilt, shame goes away the quicker one can come to terms with this. You may or may have not had this when you first realized you were gay, but it's pretty much the same thing imo."
gayyoungold,354hk9,Okiedustdevil,2,Thu May 7 15:01:34 2015 UTC,"You learn to grow out of it. It obviously is not the norm but it's what makes us happy and as corny as it sounds that's all that matters.

gayyoungold,354hk9,RustyGuns,2,Thu May 7 04:27:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's a common feeling; the attraction may not be a social norm, but it is natural for you.  As an older, I've noticed that most younger guys disappear after being with us/me.  That said, us olders very often get very attached to the younger guys and feel badly when they don't recontact.  Like I said, all of these feelings are perfectly normal and I think will lessen when you come to accept that fact.  Just relax and understand that your feelings are something we all endure to one degree or another."
gayyoungold,354hk9,FriesBaconNaked501,1 point,Thu May 7 11:48:43 2015 UTC,"As an older, I've noticed that most younger guys disappear after being with us/me.   Why do you think this is? I mean, I know I haven't reconnected to some men I've been with, but I think this is because there just wasn't a connection (they haven't reconnected as well). Some men I can call my friends now, some I see regularly for the naughty. I am wondering about your view on this."
gayyoungold,354hk9,blatiebla,2,Thu May 7 19:52:49 2015 UTC,"I attribute some of it to the ""post ejaculatory guilt"".  But I'm sure it's also because the mood just passes and they move on to someone else.  Then there are guys that want a specific ""daddy"" type; big belly, lots of body hair, beard...........etc, but are horny enough that they'll have sex even when their favorite attributes aren't present, then not return.  I can't really explain all of it.  But there have been times when I was very attracted to a young man, we seemed to get along fabulously, then they never make contact again.  I feel badly, fearing I'd said or done something they didn't like.  The short answer may be that there are many reasons. Another being that being young and hot they have so many options that they move on to a new man, again and again.  I know this isn't much of an answer, but in my case I'll just keep looking."

gayyoungold,354hk9,funky_ass_flea_bass,1 point,Thu May 7 16:41:33 2015 UTC,I can relate to that feeling as I felt the same way early on when I explored this desire I had.  Most of the first few guys I hooked up with weren't really more than FWB so in my whorish stage that feeling was probably natural.  But after meeting my husband (who started off as a hook up) and cuddling often with him afterwards that feeling begin to lessen.  It also probably helped that meeting my husband prompted me to come out to my family and introduce him to them.  After that it no longer bothered me.  OP I think when you find the right guy who makes you want to share your true self with those you love than that feeling will no longer nag at you :)

I like guys 10-15 older than me and now date with guy who is ""only"" 7 years older than me, he is 31, but anyway I feel very ashamed. I think that the main issue is not after-sex guilt but the common guilt that I am into older guys. My family and friends know that I am a gay but I am not going to share my preferences with them at this time."

gayyoungold,34trvf,Texanyounger4older,1 point,Tue May 5 14:48:28 2015 UTC,Sounds like a shitty situation. I think the first thing you need to do is work on your agoraphobia. Have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor?
gayyoungold,34trvf,Robolabo,1 point,Mon May 4 16:25:54 2015 UTC,"With regards to the see two guys... Did you make it clear what you wanted etc? Also you really really need to talk to someone, maybe go on some medication (it can really help and positively improve your life).   It kills me to read this because I used to be like you when I was maybe 8-14 and I know how stressful and horrible life becomes. You deserve to be happy like the rest of us and you deserve to have the opportunity to find someone who will love and care about you.   I hope things work out for you and you can find your niche solution. I'm sure you are a sweet guy that just needs to have things work for once."
gayyoungold,34trvf,RustyGuns,1 point,Mon May 4 18:53:07 2015 UTC,"It kind of sounds like you want someone for your own, or a family type relationship consisting of a few partners. If you really want to play around and be ""young"" again, then have an open mind about engaging in such aspects. Threesomes or more require you to put yourself in the situation of engaging with all the partners. Even if you feel left out or out of your comfort zone, throw out some moves, tantalize them and just remember to enjoy and have a good time.   Your biggest enemy here sounds like yourself. Being young is a state of mind. Don't let your condition define who you are and what you do. Nor shall you let it stop you from anything. You're in charge and you're the one that will ultimately go out and get what you want. But remember this, there will be times where panic is warranted, times where you feel helpless, and or embarrassed regardless of your condition. But you have a supportive friend to back you. It is just a matter of how you handle the situation, laugh it off and continue on with your life and learn from it, or clam up and forget whom you are. Maybe what you need is some coaxing into going to a bathhouse if that is what you want. It sounds like you really want to experience the fruits of gay life as depicted for the masses. Ie. gays always have massive orgies every second and have Donna Summer monuments in their home. Silly examples but you get the idea.   With the two guys, try and take a page out of their book and enjoy simple pleasures. Sex is just sex but making love is different, what are you looking for really is the question. As you said, ""Sex is just fun."" So why are you not having fun? Do you just want to have enough sex for three lifetimes? Or...  You're single I assume, and you say you want to have fun with ""someone new,"" so go find them. Go and get your cravings filled and stuffed pun intended. Go out and make an effort out of it, you may get shot down a few times, but as long as you get back up with your eyes on the prize, you're fine."
gayyoungold,34trvf,Trublooiskoo,1 point,Mon May 4 23:02:15 2015 UTC,"Agoraphobia is in my family, so I understand how crippling it can be and how it keeps you from the exact situations that you need to experience to realize they're not as dangerous as your mind is telling you they are. That being said, group sex is probably the worst thing you could be doing if you're agoraphobic. If you tip toe around and feel anxious with one person, the more you add to the dynamic the worse it will be for you.   I do also think you may not understand where you stand in regards to this guy who's already in a relationship. You're not his relationship, his partner is. You're side booty to him, but you're making him you're one and only and that is so fucking dangerous to your well being. If they're off at the bath house, they're not the one man man type. You're putting all your eggs in his basket, his basket has a huge hole they're falling out of and his reaction is ""oh well, I'll get another chicken"" Main point I'd want to say to you, is that with your agoraphobia, you need to be selective about who you let in. You need someone sympathetic and sensitive to how delicate you can be. This doesn't sound like that kind of guy.   You're also putting way too much emphasis on your hard on in these situations. There are plenty of guys out there that are interested in ass only and want you to keep the dick tucked away and out of sight (if you're bottoming). And something tells me you're not the only stocky pale red head in rural Newfoundland. You're being your own worst enemy."

It is a pay site which gives you unlimited messages, ability to see guys galleries and videos.  I paid for a few years but stopped since most of the guys from the Dallas area are married and mostly too scared to meet.  I used to get a lot of scammers from this site but apparently my warning message made them assume I am a waste of time."

gayyoungold,34hz7e,ward-92,6,Fri May 1 08:59:48 2015 UTC,"I am in the exact same position you are in. First I will tell you what I think you should do :) have you brought it up to your partner? Does he know how you are feeling? I think as long as he is ok with it you should try to swallow some of that pride and understand your situation. It sounds like you are heading in the right direction. You are educated and working towards a career. That alone is amazing. It is also expected that at your age you will not be making that much money. Again I would bring it up and see what he has to say. Maybe he can help you feel less like a ""sugar baby."" To me, that term is for someone who is only with the person solely because of their money.   For me I have always had money engrained into me. My parents divorced when I was in maybe grade four and my dad would always tell me how much I was costing him. No matter what I was doing. I used to be so passionate about competitive trampoline and all he cared about was telling me how much lighter his wallet was. He also is a doctor and helps deliver babies on call so I know he makes a decent amount of money. Yet, he would make me feel so guilty for succeeding in my sport regardless of how little it was actually hurting him financially.  When he would bring up the child support it would always make me want to disappear. I even felt guilty for existing and thought he only saw me as a monetary expense.   My current partner of three years is pretty successful. He is smart and has made the most of his engineering degree which has made him quite a lot of money. Currently I do chip in monthly from ""rent"" that my parents give me and pay for things once in a while but generally he pays for stuff.  It's hard for me because I feel so guilty whenever he buys me a really nice birthday present (like new ski boots and skiis) or pays for groceries and dinner. I have talked to him about it and he said he totally understands my situation (I'm in school and only working part time). That helped me a lot to kinda look at the big picture and realize he was more than happy to help.   I just landed a really sweet internship this summer that pays $20 an hour so I'll be able to help out more. I was thinking of buying him a ring or something sentimental before I start school in the summer :)   Sorry for the long post and I hope this was helpful!! It's always refreshing for me to see older younger relationships. (I'm 23 and he's 56)."
gayyoungold,34hz7e,RustyGuns,1 point,Fri May 1 10:04:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice!  Best of luck with the internship :)
gayyoungold,34hz7e,SalaciousSarah,2,Sat May 2 10:25:56 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with the others. I understand because my partner makes three times what I make, but I still feel like I should contribute half of the rent and bill money. My parents brought me up to be very worried about money so I'm really tight, which has made this even more conflicting!   If I was going on dates or hadn't known someone long, I'd insist on paying half. But I think that if you're in a mutually respectful relationship, it is fair that the person who is paid more pays more, so long as you've talked about it.  I feel bad making my partner pay more, but he can do so and still have the money to splurge on unnecessary stuff for himself - I couldn't.  For things like meals, I find it best to know what the situation is going in. I wouldn't want to eat a meal I knew I couldn't afford without first checking that it's 100% fine for them to pay for it.  DON'T jeopardize your future career to have more money now, especially if you'll be earning a little more by doing a phd anyway. I seriously doubt he'd want you to take a lower pay in the long run just so you can pay for dinners now.   As the others have said, try to have a full and frank discussion of how you both feel about your joint money situation. If the relationship continues you may need to start thinking about things like joint bank accounts fairly soon, so it's good to know what you're up for going in. If he's happy to pay extra because he earns extra, and won't make you feel guilty or hold it over, or expect anything back, then you've got a winner =)"

gayyoungold,34hz7e,FriesBaconNaked501,2,Tue May 5 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're ever going to have put as much money towards a relationship freshly out of college as a man who has been working 30 years.  You just have to accept that you need some time to establish yourself and contribute what you can.  In the mean time he probably enjoys the same idea of ""being successful picking up the bill and buying drinks"".  As long as your primary interests in him aren't his money he's not your sugar daddy and the fact that you're asking this question should prove that."

Personally, having the friendship of a young man who is doing his best to do things right has great value itself and I'm willing to provide what a can.  He's lucky to have a partner like you."
gayyoungold,34hz7e,Robolabo,1 point,Sat May 2 10:27:05 2015 UTC,I totally understand what you are going through but on the opposite side of the coin. I am 33 dating a 22 year old. He is struggling with trying to get back into school while I am a teacher. I don't make tons of money but I want him to have whatever he needs. I fear that I over reach with help. When I flew us to Vegas I had to pay for everything and I am not sure how it made him feel. I know sometimes he seemed sad about it. I which there was an easy answer to it. I would suggest just being honest with your partner. Anyway your post was very insightful for me... I often wonder what is going on in his head and I think this lets me have a peak.
gayyoungold,34hz7e,dudeokie,1 point,Fri May 1 14:28:45 2015 UTC,"Despite being the younger one in my relationship - I make more than him (and well, he's now unemployed - but that's another issue).  But, given where I'm going in my life - I'll always make more than him. We have both come to realize, that being 'fair' or 50/50, doesn't always mean an 'equal split'. But more, a split that is in proportion to what we are making.  For example - when he did have a job. If our rent was 1,400 a month - instead of paying 700 each and being '50/50' - I'd pay 1,000, and he'd pay 400.   Things like this would start to be based more off of '% of our paycheck' type of thing - than the final total bill. I could pay 1,000, and still have money leftover for spending, saving, etc. 400 left him with extra money also. But, if it was 700/700 - I'd be rolling in extra cash, and he would be paycheck to paycheck type of thing.   At the same time, had we got a place that was $800/month so we could be at a 50/50 that he could afford - we'd be in a crappy place. But, I couldn't afford a $1,400 place on my own at the time. So, even though he was able to contribute less than me - it still let us afford a place nicer than I could on my own.  Be grateful, but don't take advantage. Toss in a bit of what you can now and then, or show a bit of appreciation by buying/giving him  a token gift/gesture/something nice. When you start 'expecting' to be covered all the time - is when it becomes an issue IMO. Show a bit of appreciation, and now and then  - if he's covering the night/weekend out - the gesture of buying a round or two of drinks can go a long way to the other person not feeling like they are being taken advantage of.  But, from the side of the 'person who makes more' - I just booked a vacation for me and my BF, of which I'll probably pay for most, if not all of it. On one hand - I'd rather not cover everything, on the other - I want to go on vacation, and I want to spend it with my partner. The alternative would be doing nothing for the summer - so in the end, I really don't mind."
gayyoungold,34hz7e,TProphet69,1 point,Sat May 2 17:31:17 2015 UTC,"Do what you can, and don't stress over it. Try to pick up the tab every so often, but I don't think he's expecting you to split things 50/50.  He knows he makes more money than you and I would bet that he'd rather enjoy nicer things with you, see you learn and have new experiences as a result.  It might be worthwhile to talk to him about this too, he might not realize that you feel this way. If he's making good money he probably doesn't think about it as much."
gayyoungold,345gon,cheroses,3,Tue Apr 28 13:30:31 2015 UTC,"I think you are jumping to the conclusion after having just met once. I'm sure you meant it politely that you'd like to get to know him first before letting him know other details. He understands the situation and knows you are just being cautious. Stop over-thinking the situation for you to get a skewed view on what he thinks about this or that. You are trying to think that you know the guy already inside and out after having met once. And if you keep thinking like this heading into meeting tomorrow, you'll be the awkward silent sour grape with 500 different conclusions. Enjoy how life play's its role and be yourself around him minus the expectations. You're already shooting yourself down on the chance that he may really be into you after meeting a few more times. Or it may be the other way around that you just actually don't really see it heading into more. Etc etc even more variables. I'm rambling  In short. Meet him a few more times and really get to know him in person and not over a phone. Relationships start with engagement in person, not over a digital screen. It may have started it, but the latter is a must if you really want to be with him."
gayyoungold,345gon,Trublooiskoo,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:08:04 2015 UTC,"the more I think about it, I realize that I shouldn't jump into conclusions having just met him once.

gayyoungold,345gon,Trublooiskoo,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:35:48 2015 UTC,"As with any internet meetings, there is always distance. Luckily not across the globe for your case.

Hell, I drove back and forth 2.5 hrs from meeting my hubby and that is without traffic. Best of luck to you two and have fun, smile, laugh tomorrow.

Maybe he does just want to be friends. I wouldn't dig too deep into it."
gayyoungold,34117l,throwaway_gyo,10,Mon Apr 27 13:37:27 2015 UTC,"Short and simple.  Don't do it.  He's not worth it just because he's a pretty face. Seems like that's all he's got working for him. Don't go and get yourself hurt and ruin a potential relationship for a one night stand. I mean, what would you be hoping to accomplish? Tame him and make him yours? One good fuck session? To me, nothing beats out a love making session with someone you care about. Don't be afraid to bring the discussion up again or just be more affectionate, within reason. Two months is a good time when things start to flesh out more and a couple is able to evaluate their emotions.  I've ""been"" with a guy like that before. He was 44 and still acted like a frat boy. One who works the field because they are ""hot and charming"". Then when you get close you find out they are just a pig (not in a good way) who makes you feel insecure and like you're not good enough because they are always talking about guys they had."

When the 10 asked me and I told him that I'm seeing someone I said he'd be the first to know if things didn't work out. Guess I'll just stick to that then ha.  Just to clarify though...   I've ""been"" with a guy like that before. He was 44 and still acted like a frat boy. One who works the field because they are ""hot and charming"". Then when you get close you find out they are just a pig (not in a good way) who makes you feel insecure and like you're not good enough because they are always talking about guys they had.   The 10 isn't really like this, at least from what I can tell. When I was seeing him he was really kind. Took me out to dinner, was really nice to me, etc.. He seemed like a genuinely nice guy."
gayyoungold,34117l,youyouyuyu,5,Mon Apr 27 15:06:21 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter that he's a really nice guy if he's using you. And maybe you want to be used.

gayyoungold,34117l,averroes86,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:13:48 2015 UTC,"I think you honestly need to talk to the guy you are currently ""seeing"" and clarify where you two stand. Is it monogamous or open? Who knows if he is truly just seeing you unless you have talked about it. I personally like monogamy but it seems unfair how your main guy is indifferent yet wants it to just be you and him? (Not sure if that is true or not)."
gayyoungold,34117l,kingwi11,3,Tue May 5 07:47:16 2015 UTC,"I think I know the answer to this - sort of been through what you're now going through.   First of all, the ""10"" isn't necessarily a dickhead or anything negative. He's probably just a nice guy, although I can see his arrogance in him asking you to travel to see him. But if you fall for that and get into something more serious with that guy, I fear that this action would become a template in your relationship. i.e. you will end up putting in more effort than him. Which might be great for you, if you're into that sort of thing, but just be aware of that thought process.  Another thing to consider; are you really questioning monogamy in itself here, albeit indirectly? Because you having sex with the 10 isn't necessarily a threat to a relationship. If there's trust, little insecurity, more communication and transparency, then really, would a one night stand hurt a relationship? I am beginning to see that fidelity trumps monogamy. The two are very different things.  Finally, consider the fact that the 10 is coming now to talk to you? It could as simple as him being horny and flirting with you. Why are you giving it so much importance? Play the flirting game. See where the chemistry takes you. Perhaps you would enjoy this guy more than what you have.  I guess essentially I laid out an argument for each other alternative. See what suits you the best at the moment and go for it. Keep us posted with how it goes and best of luck!"
gayyoungold,34117l,Robolabo,2,Tue Apr 28 04:25:02 2015 UTC,Follow Up/Update  We both had a heart-to-heart talk and decided that we both genuinely care about each other but for the time being should just be friends as opposed to trying and forcing a relationship. Does that mean I'm clear to start seeing another guy?
gayyoungold,34117l,2scompany,2,Wed Apr 29 14:39:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, your ""friend"" is giving you the option to sleep around. I would hook up with the 10. Just hook up with the 10 though, he seems like he likes to pursue , isn't into being pursued."

I've personally looked in every place I can think of, trying to find the ""ideal"" son/partner without much success; most younger men are looking for hookups or a sugar daddy.  Plus, I admit to being picky, preferring slender, athletic, healthy young men that aren't covered with tattoos and hair.  That's just my preference.

gayyoungold,33tvqv,young_pup,5,Sat Apr 25 16:12:54 2015 UTC,"As we age there's no doubt that the libido slows and there comes a point where sexual activity looses some of its attraction.  Physical exercise seems to help a lot.  Tampering with the testosterone level is a controversial frontier since there are unintended consequences including, but not limited to, elevated risk of prostate cancer.    Ideally, we all live in to our golden years with rock-hard erections and a lust for sex a couple of times a day, but it's not realistic.  At some point the younger partner needs to expect that the older will start to decline, and decide what he will do.  Your choice.  I am 67.  Younger men have always been my passion and their youth and beauty is still a big part of me.  But I've noticed that my focus is more and more on their companionship rather than physical sex.  That said, when I get out in the sun, step up the workouts and become more active, the desire for physical intimacy increases dramatically.  I think getting your partner to be more active and diet conscious is the way to go, and I'm very impressed that you're sticking by him."
gayyoungold,33tvqv,FriesBaconNaked501,2,Sun Apr 26 15:39:53 2015 UTC,Thank you for you perspective and wisdom. You are really helping me better understand my man's perspective.

gayyoungold,33tvqv,Schippyluminal,3,Tue Apr 28 06:43:35 2015 UTC,I found out that after a rough workout we tend to get more horny. Maybe both going to the gym and then go home and shower could start something. Good luck!
gayyoungold,33tvqv,Schippyluminal,2,Sat Apr 25 16:49:27 2015 UTC,Thank you! We'll have to try it.
gayyoungold,33tvqv,ReverendEntity,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:51:02 2015 UTC,No problem. Of course if it's been a while for both of you is recommend to take it slow and find a routine that fits for both of you. Don't want any injuries. :)
gayyoungold,33tvqv,Whitedragon2,2,Sat Apr 25 18:10:48 2015 UTC,He may need to have his testosterone levels checked.  http://www.webmd.com/men/features/low-testosterone-explained-how-do-you-know-when-levels-are-too-low
gayyoungold,33tvqv,harrisonishere,2,Sat Apr 25 19:29:14 2015 UTC,Good idea. I will suggest that he gets that checked and maybe getting some testosterone will help.
gayyoungold,33tvqv,rdox,2,Sat Apr 25 19:51:46 2015 UTC,"Working out and physical activities together are a good start.  My husband and I have been together for 10+ years and have kids now so sexy time is hard to find.  We started working out together at one point and that did help.  We also both took up golf and that gets us out and active.  Can't wait to hit the links with him now that the weather is getting warmer and see him in his golf outfits ;)  Another thing to work on is intimacy.  I've mentioned this to others who have made similar posts to yours.  Intimacy does not always entail sex but it gets you both being physical with each other which can at times lead to sex.  Now I know you said he doesn't seem to want to do anything physical but does that include back rubs, foot rubs, and cuddling?  My husband digs a good back rub or foot rub so I started surprising him with nice long rubbings after he would come home from work some nights.  Maybe use a little oil in there to also touch upon the sense of smell.  Try lighting a few candles or burn some incense as well to set the mood.  It'll relax him and maybe you'll get him excited too.  BUT, and this is important, don't go into it expecting sex.  Instead go into it looking to relax him so that he can be put at ease and get you both physically closer to each other.  Strike some conversation up while rubbing if you can mange to, but don't start off with sex talk.  Try asking about his day, something from his past, or another topic that shows interest in him but not overtly sexual.  Maybe you two could even switch and let him rub you.  The point here is to share an intimate relaxing session with each other that brings you both closer together.  Bonding like this might not always lead to sex but it'll help get the motor going and at least he might start fantasizing."
gayyoungold,33tvqv,Robolabo,2,Tue Apr 28 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"I apologize, I wrote out this long, thoughtful comment on my phone and for some reason the app I was using only picked up the first sentence. So I'm trying again (on a computer).   I think everyone has mentioned the big ones; exercise, diet, intimacy without sex, etc. I have some experience in this area. I met my husband when I was 19 years old, he is about fifteen years my senior. We used to have sex frequently, sometimes twice daily. Then his health took a turn for the worse (he has a brain cyst that causes a lot of pain and is linked to other problems).   We haven't had sex in over five years now. FriesBaconNaked is right, as you get older, companionship becomes paramount, and sex becomes a little less important. However, it's a personal decision. It was extremely difficult for me to adjust the first couple years, since I've always been an extremely sexual person. But eventually I decided that I wanted to grow old with him, and being with him and having him as my best fried was more important than the sex I missed so much.   It's a choice only you can make. Perhaps at this stage in your life, the sex is still important. Perhaps that will change in time, perhaps it never will. But it's only a decision only you can make."
gayyoungold,33tvqv,harrisonishere,2,Wed Apr 29 14:17:19 2015 UTC,Are you me?  I'm having the exact same issue. I posted about it once here: http://www.reddit.com/r/gayyoungold/comments/2vyr3k/togethor_three_years_as_of_feburary_dead_bedroom/  I didn't update it but it wasn't testosterone as his was very high.

gayyoungold,33rz30,GerontoMan,4,Sat Apr 25 01:29:31 2015 UTC,"Just something I've found from my own life experience, if you're ashamed/afraid of your family knowing that you're gay you're unlikely to resolve that with only a change in scenery.  Personally I found the only way to relieve myself (mostly) of shame I had as a homosexual was keeping no secrets from close ones. Those who had issue with it were out. It's not something I thought about so consciously but feeling like I had to keep it a secret was causing my shame.  I understand that not everyone can take such a hard line approach but it has worked for me and I've been able to put the pieces back together into a better whole as a result. YMMV.   As far as places to live go, I've always imagined the Pacific NW to be a nice place. I've always thought I'd like Seattle but it may be humid there but at least it's not sweltering like Texas. Chicago also has appeal."

Continue to find help and support; just keep trying to find answers.  NEVER EVER EVER trust your doctors, medical pros, etc. at their word; it's up to you to check for you and your partners best interest!!!  Do your own research, cross check, etc. and validate what's being recommended, said and done.  That's 1 of 2 important lessons I've learn that from an older friend with a disability.  The other is below.  As tough as this is for you, PLEASE do not avoid making sure you stay healthy during the process!  It's going to take everything you've got, but you both will make it thru this.  Believe you're far stronger than you realize; so is he, but it's a choice to be stronger.  Here's to him being as good as new!  One day, if/when he is not as ""good as new"" (because we like older men, it's going to happen), I've learned another important lesson from my older friend.  He said, ""You learn to live with it.""  Accepting it and learning how to live with it helped him live a much more content, satisfied, and often happy, life.  His words stuck with me, so I'm passing them on to you.  He helped me understand a lot about disabilities (eye opening stuff).  It's not the end of life; it's simply a different way of life, but you're still the same inside.  Unfortunately, people treat them different out of fear - and that's the frustrating part.  That fear comes from a variety of internal places.  One example: Many (speaking specifically about gay men here) are so afraid - fear - of aging, losing physical ability and death, they avoid it.  This avoidance is at the cost of 1.) being prepared ... and 2.) a truly supportive, helpful community.  I've done A TON of research in this area and it's very disappointing all around.  I stopped further investment in this direction because the results, behaviors and attitudes were so unfortunate.  Human behavior never ceases to amaze me!  It was a tough decision to stop, but you can only help those who want it.  PM if you need.  Write here or post new.  Do whatever you feel will help ... because it will (even if it might now feel like it).  Any questions, PLEASE ask.  I'll do what I can to help.  How are you doing?  Keep us updated."

You certainly are not alone in what you want and there are oceans of us older guys that appreciate and are looking for the younger partner in life.  Sometimes the sites work, but generally are best for hookups and the same is with the bars.  All you can do is try until you find him.  We do exist."

I met my current partner of 5 years off grindr and we are in an open relationship where I've met others through grindr and silver daddies so yes, I would say they are successful in finding a date or a sex hookup. Like always you should be very careful with who you chat.  There are a few bars in London which are generally catered for our crowd specifically ""The Quebec"" although I wouldn't go there. The others are mostly bars for older guys but younger guys are obviously welcome! I'm not sure about other places depending on where you are but I've found that a bear bar or leather/amsterdam style gay bar caters for an older crowd.  Again like you I've had this double taboo but I've always took it one step at a time. I came out to my friends then it wasn't till a while later, even a year, I came out that I was with my partner who I have an age difference of 38 years.

I'm going on 13 years with my husband and we have adopted 2 children who are now teens.  My family knows about all this and is very accepting and supportive.  I really lucked out and found my husband via a hook up site.  Actually he found me and I wasn't interested in starting a relationship until after the first date with my now husband.  But I def had some fun experiences before settling down so enjoy yourself.  Have fun with SD and other sites but also check out some of the apps out.  I recall hearing Scruff is a good app for older/younger but I don't know from experience.  Back when I was dating, websites where my only choice for meeting guys so can't speak about apps from experience.  I also have no clue about meeting guys in bars/clubs as my husband and I both are not real big fans of those types of places.

It can be a bit of challenge in a relationship like this though because as I get older I know I'm aging out of the group my husband prefers while he only gets better and better looking to me as he ages.  We are always complimenting the other on their looks and we keep the fun going in bed, but its so much harder with kids and both of us working full time.  Enjoy the freedom you have now and take your time to find the right one for you because once you settle down with kids, alone time and sexy time are a challenge to find.  Thankfully I can count on my parents to watch the kids every so often when we need time to just be a couple.  Good luck to you!"

The definition mentions young-looking, 18-23ish, slender, ectomorph type, little or no body hair, no facial hair.  Obviously, this could include some guys into their late 20s or some in their mid teens, but it would specifically exclude a lot of non-twink, handsome young men."

I don't have anything against it, after all without a bear or daddy types I guess I would feel alone as I feel more comfortable with bears than twinks."
gayyoungold,32kvyx,sdchaser,2,Tue Apr 14 19:37:48 2015 UTC,There just labels. My boy calls me Daddy and I am only 33. I tease him and call him a twink. Just a word for under 24 skinny boys.
gayyoungold,32kvyx,dogbrainv,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:11:46 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of a twink in appearances, but I don't really get any identity from it. The gay community is great with labelling every body 'type', so I guess I should just be happy my body type isn't named after an animal, haha."
gayyoungold,32kvyx,Curiousforolder,1 point,Sat May 2 17:32:46 2015 UTC,Personally I don't like the word twink. It just has a negative effect on me and kinda reminds me of a kid who is feminine and stupid. (Nothing wrong with being feminine).   If someone called me a twink I wouldn't feel like it was a positive comment and tell them off lol..

gayyoungold,32jf6s,gyotasrs,5,Tue Apr 14 07:22:52 2015 UTC,"That is a huge breach of trust, especially given that you've had a conversation about it. I think it's time for another very serious talk. Regardless of what I or anyone else says, if you're not comfortable with having your photo posted anywhere and your significant other goes against that--I think you should evaluate why you're with him and if you want to continue to be.   Honestly, I'd tell you to try to find out exactly what he has done in terms of what's been posted and where, and also what other photos he has. You can't really do anything about it at this point but it might help you prepare yourself if you know what people have seen. Look up privacy laws in your state and see where they might apply for a worst case scenario. You can also contact whoever is in charge of wherever the photos were posted to get them to take the photos down. Explain the situation, say that your permission wasn't granted for them to be used like this. Usually they will be cooperative.  Approach the conversation with care. I realize you're probably embarrassed and angry but letting your emotions boil up won't solve anything. I can't speak to Mike's nature, but I hate to think he could post much worse if provoked. I'm giving him the benefit of doubt and thinking that he's posted these photos in order to brag about being with you...but taking and posting photos of someone sleeping is sorta creepy...  Without revealing what the forums are, what's the background? Is this akin to the local gay community type of board or something more widespread? Most likely anyone who could be offended and cause you trouble isn't going to see the images, especially if it is in a gay specific site. I would try not to worry and calm down."
gayyoungold,32jf6s,youyouyuyu,3,Tue Apr 14 08:59:22 2015 UTC,"1) I don't think you need to worry too much about the photos. If they're on a gay community site, it'll be gay or gay-friendly people seeing it.   2) It's still not cool of your BF to post them without your permission. Infact, its a creepy and a breach of trust to post pictures of someone sleeping if you now it could upset them. Ask him to take them down.  3) If you want your relationship to last you should make a plan to come out. It doesn't have to be an immediate decision, it could be a 2 year plan where you find a new job and get yourself in a place where you can be comfortable."
gayyoungold,32jf6s,Robolabo,2,Tue Apr 14 13:34:28 2015 UTC,"Hey,  Obviously I don't know all the ends and outs of the situation, but I agree this is a hige breach of trust. However, job wise you're still just fine as long as you take them down asap. I doubt your employers are just scanning websites looking for queers they employ, but again I don't understand the whole situation.   This is what I'd do. Talk to him asap, and make sure he realizes both the implications for you professionally and how he hurt you personally. I guess I don't know how much you like the guy (you must have some feeling for him or you wouldn't have posted) so I can't really tell you to break up or not.  I really hope things go as best they can."
gayyoungold,32jf6s,botanicalpilot,2,Tue Apr 14 12:19:10 2015 UTC,"I'd be very annoyed by someone taking pictures of me sleeping and posting them online, even though my family, friends, and coworkers know about my husband and I.  That is a breach of trust and you should discuss it with him.  You should tell him that bedroom time together is private time for you both and that you don't want pictures of those intimate moments shared with others.  Its one thing if he thinks you look beautiful/handsome while sleeping and takes a picture to keep private, but it becomes a privacy issue when he starts sharing that online.  There should be some expectation of privacy in a relationship which allows both people to get to know each on a deeper level.  If you have to worry all the time about napping around him or that he might snap a photo at any moment to post online than you are forced to keep your guard up constantly around him preventing you two from truly connecting with each other.  This is all stuff you should talk to him about, though I'd do it in a calm, soothing manner.  Raging at home might have a negative effect or worse; you are the best judge of that so handle it however you see fit but definitely talk to him about it.   I've taken a few of my husband napping with our dogs or children, but I'd never post those online or show them to other people unless I knew he was okay with that.  My husband has a few of me too I'm sure, but again I'm not worried because we have an understanding of trust and privacy between us.  It is important Mike learns about this trust and privacy matter so that you guys get along better.  Oh and if you don't want those pictures up online, than ask Mike to please take them down.  If he won't or you two have a falling out I'd get in touch with the sites moderators or administrators to have them removed.  I'd only make this a legal matter as a last resort."
gayyoungold,32jf6s,Whitedragon2,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:03:03 2015 UTC,"To me this would be a deal breaker - its irresponsible behaviour from a 50 year old, as well as a breach of trust. This guy is not as mature as his years - and may lose his appeal when you realise you're more adult than he is.  All that said you have to recognise that you can't live gay and appear straight to everyone. You're going to have to address this conflict sooner or later."
gayyoungold,32jf6s,2scompany,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:19:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what he was trying to achieve here. Maybe he was just happy and proud of his relationship. Posting the pictures was dangerous, risky, and against your negotiated agreement.   However, I wouldn't be quick to throw in the towel. If someone at work noticed then I would hit the ceiling. It sounds like no real damage has been done yet and relationships are complicated (mostly by things like this). If you want to have a relationship then tone down the reaction. Relationships are constantly tested by this type of thing. This is a serious issue for you, not so much for him. You and he need to talk, in order to understand that difference. Let him know you are upset, and why you are upset. Let him know [calmly] how this makes you feel.   This is not a deal breaker in my book since no damage has been done.   The pictures should absolutely be taken down, without question."
gayyoungold,32jf6s,dadnme,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:02:33 2015 UTC,"Some great advice already given.  Age rarely means little as far as maturity.  Boys will be boys.  If I could debate one thing: closeted vs coming out ... dude, it's not cowardice to be discreet.  'Some people' - whoever they are - should really focus on themselves more.  On coming out quoted from other comments ...   ""If you want your relationship to last you should make a plan to come out.""  ""you can't live gay and appear straight to everyone. You're going to have to address this conflict sooner or later.""   These could be, IMO, dangerous assumptions.  I've observed and lived every side of this choice.  Nobody guesses me as gay until I'm with a group of gay men ... and then, especially if you're in a large diverse metro area, it still wouldn't be clear.  I'm the straightest gay guy - even gays and lesbians - have met.  It's allowed me to learn a lot about making big and/or subtle life choices.  So, to the OP, there are many ways to a content, fulfilled life.  This isn't one size fits all (ask bisexuals, because they really do exist; a large majority of the men are discreet, many very content in life).  We're all very different, so being closeted or coming out is relative to your comfort.  Where you live does play a major role.  Just do what's best for your life goals.  Back to the can of worms.  This pic thing is not cool.  Get the pictures taken down ASAP.  Anything online, even in a private community, is not really private anymore.  Only takes one person to copy, paste and share.  Everyone has a varied idea of privacy; just ask Zuckerberg.  This is a major trust issue, IMO.  Hopefully this will all work out for both of you."

If you're living with a man - especially one old enough to be your father ( and he isn't) - and you're going about life in a community (especially a non metropolitan one) observers are going to get the 'right' idea. Not everyone is a total fool.  How cool you are with that reality is the question."

I e-mailed the webmaster on the website and after proving my identity he said to just say the word and they'll be gone. I've asked Mike to meet up with me after I get off work tomorrow and I'm going to try to work things out.   On the topic of coming out though - I have a very different opinion on the subject than most people. Nothing will change about me if I ""come out."" I'll still be the same person. I'll still have the same personality and feelings. The only thing that would change would be me telling people who I prefer to bed. I'd keep that information private if I was straight as well. I'm not lying to myself or to anyone else by not coming out, I just keep my sex life private like I think most people do."
gayyoungold,32jf6s,2scompany,1 point,Wed Apr 15 07:06:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with this stance, which I have taken my whole life. Who announces that he is straight ; or what straight person tells you about his sexual practices??  There should be areas of reserve in life - and, frankly, in modern life there are not enough of them : far too much 'oversharing' in my view.  But it comes down to what I said above - not everyone is a fool. Many people are going to perceive rightly that you are gay - and at some point someone will ask you point blank. What do you say?  And more importantly, how comfortable are you?"
gayyoungold,32jf6s,mark_with,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:24:07 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly honest, I've never understood the ""coming out"" thing. I make a point not to share very personal information with my co-workers, it's not relevant to my job - in any way, and as far as my cohort of workers is concerned, whether I am gay, straight, or into whatever I like it's entirely my business, provided that nothing illegal is going on, I have fetishes and whatever else and I'm sure other people do too. So, kind of I feel that unless I'm asking, I don't want to know, really...at all, and if I'm being asked, I'll make things friendly and change the subject, when is it important, when I want to fuck you, otherwise, it's like asking about my 10 inch penis or something - it's just not relevant to the topic.  For family however it's a different matter and every inch the dilemma one could imagine it to be.  The bottom line here, is that your partner decided to act against your explicit interests, and basically it's a passive-aggressive thing against your expressed wishes, like not wearing a condom or lying about your status, so I'm not sure you have a viable trust relationship here. Good luck with your decision, whatever you decide.  There are better candidates, and given the demographics, a variety of choices available."

Facebook is great for people you haven't seen in years (classmates, etc) but ever since Facebook became so pervasive - it became the only way to contact people.   Then friends stopped accepting calls and preferring text messaging instead. It's the saddest shit ever. I know sometimes it's nice not to have to answer the phone and talk but how close can you be if you can't speak with your friends? It is indeed aggravating but now that I've got something of a career I'm building, I wouldn't really have time for socializing anyways...  It is funny how older generations generally use technology in different ways. I won't mess with Skype or FaceTime but a few of my older friends use it every chance they can. It's kind of funny, you would expect me being the younger/""Millenial"" partner to be fucking about with the phone constantly but I don't use mine nearly as much as my partner and he's in his 60s.   Hopefully at some point people will rediscover face to face socializing & actually doing things again. I'm sure part of it might just be my age. Everyone's getting married, having kids. No time and still, all the time in the world. Carpe diem, I guess!  Sorry for rambling. In other, shorter words: I feel you!"

gayyoungold,32d3ng,Petubed,3,Wed Apr 15 01:26:52 2015 UTC,"If you have that mindset, then it's more than likely that someone else has that same mindset, and there's no doubt you'll find that someone with it if you keep trying.  But it's unfair to relate that to classical conditioning - that makes it sound like it's involuntary for someone to say, check their phone on a date. It's not involuntary, it's more curiosity of whatever their phone is alerting them to. But that doesn't excuse the fact that it's rude to look at their phone on a date - it definitely shouldn't be happening.  Someone who checks their phone from time to time even when they are with you isn't incapable of doing what you described. They're not mindless drones to their phones. I just thought I should point that out."
gayyoungold,32d3ng,throrowaway,2,Sun Apr 12 20:23:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not here to disagree as much as point out that checking one's phone has been linked to poor impulse control, and that can be seen in other areas of one's life, too. A recent study has shown that children with greater impulse control tend to do better in school, are more successful into adulthood, and are happier and healthier. I bring this up because there is a component of mindlessness that goes along with poor impulse control.    You may find it interesting to read some recent studies about impulse control and will. Essentially, everybody has a limited reserve of will that becomes depleted as you go about your day and there activities, such as brushing one's teeth with your non-dominant hand, that increase your reserve of will."

The formula for misery is trying to make things last forever...or, more exactly,  to last in the same format forever.  Water reaches its own level, and relationships become what they are.  If you guys are meant to exist together you will - but artificially trying to hold something together if its not there is really futile.  Who knows?  Of course common sense tells us that people change and grow - young people doing moreso than older folks.  This is a 'risk' ( or rather a reality) when there is a big disparity in age -but you knew that going into the relationship.  Whatever happens it sounds like its been a great 5 years, which is  to be appreciated....and which may continue....in the same, or another format."

It's no secret that gay relationships are commonly more open than straight relationships and I'm sure the debate as to why will continue to go on and on for a long while yet. I'm sure you realize that consenting to an open relationship and being comfortable with one is two totally separate concepts; but just because you thought you would be okay with it doesn't mean that you can't express that your sentiments have changed.  While I agree with what 2scompany has said, there are a lot of things that can lead to how a relationship transitions. Are you being totally honest with him? Does he know what your expectations and desires are? Do you know his? To me, it sounds like none of this was discussed or even hinted at before all of these things happened and a lot of it still hasn't been talked about.  I wouldn't say you have the right to prevent your partner from doing anything, but he should know of what you truly approve or disapprove of. Should he choose to betray that and hurt you is the point where you should reevaluate. To make it extremely clear: Just because someone might be older or younger than someone else doesn't make them any more or less significant. He doesn't get a free pass because he's younger and in an exploratory phase. And you shouldn't feel as though you should sacrifice your feelings to be with him.  Whether you stay with him or part ways, be honest with yourself and him because it's the only way you're going to be happy in a relationship--the only reason (past real world responsibilities, I suppose) to stay in a relationship is because it makes you happy."

Everybody deserves to be respected in their relationships: young or old. You have every right to voice your objections and especially your feelings about his deceit. Feeling hurt by those you love isn't something that tends to go away on it's own so it's important that both of you be self aware and discuss your feelings. Resentment finds a way to bubble to the surface if feelings are not addressed.   I don't think this is normal or expected of intergenerational relationships specifically. You have every right to be confused and concerned. He lied to you and invested himself emotionally with another man. I don't really know what your relationship is built on (I'd imagine not that) but I know I'd be really hurt by it. Still though, I'm also pretty strictly monogamous. I don't get into open relationships and my own particular opinion of them is that they are prone to instability.   You'll have to decide for yourself what you need/want to do but I can tell you definitively that everyone deserves respect in their relationships, regardless of their age. You should never feel like you're ""not allowed"" to have objections.   Hope this all clears up for you! Just do some reflection on what YOU need & tell him."
gayyoungold,32bvj2,GerontoMan,2,Sun Apr 12 14:48:12 2015 UTC,"It may be simply the guys I've met on Daddyhunt and Silverdaddies, but it seems that there are younger guys out there who are not sexually satisfied by the older man. Some these have 'permission to play' and others do not. I have been the 'boy on the side'.  I do think it is incumbent on both partners to keep the sexual relationship fresh and interesting. Even in the last two weeks, a younger man approached me because he's not getting enough or the right stuff from his older partner. It's not for me to sort it out but for them.  I'm not so sure about open relationships. They can work for some. Mostly I think that energy that could go into the relationship is going into searching for and satisfying partners outside. It would be too easy for me to fall in love with someone else that I have made love to. I don't think I'd make a good candidate for an open relationship if I had 'permission to play!'."

gayyoungold,32bvj2,sdcrow,3,Tue May 5 07:55:22 2015 UTC,"I think most m4m couples (any age combo) tend to lean toward open relationships ... and let me emphasize this next part: whether they discuss it or not.  A great problem we all have is being trained to default to a pop culture ""ideal"" relationship.  This is why so many relationships fail.  Many quickly form relationships when they shouldn't or stay in relationships that aren't working ... all while comparing it to popular ideals.  This causes all sorts of dynamics problems, but mostly stops everyone from finding a GOOD ""works for us"" relationship (which is individually ideal).  Older / younger monogamy is possible, very much, but you have to find another guy who 100% absolutely thinks the same way.  Easy to tell if he does, because of his actions.  Typically, you'll both want to spend all your time together (I was lucky enough to have this in the past; it's so good when you find it!!!).  To be honest, most guys in their 20's just don't have enough experience to know what they want.  Life stages, we all have'em.  In my 20's, I wanted monogamy.  Got it, but with a lower libido, older partner.  After a few years, I asked to open it.  I didn't sleep around or actively seek sex, so it was more if opportunity shows up, we could.  It was rare, but it happened and it really helped.  Now in my 30's, after he cheated by building another relationship (open or closed, cheating happens) and I broke it off, I would still like monogamy ... yes, even knowing all that I now know.  I'm not opposed to an open thing like I had before.  I'm not even opposed to a triad.  Why?  If I found another miss-match libido partner (or I'm the lower libido to him one day), then we'd make the choices that are best for us as individuals at that time.  It's possible to have strong emotional attachments to more than one person and for very different reasons, so live and let live.  I believe, have practiced and have seen how well it works, that if you really care about about another, then their happiness is more important than your own ...   BUT ...  Not at the sacrifice of your own happiness.  That second part is very important.  Control what you can, and that means your life, not theirs.  It's all about choice - only your choice.  If you seek to control or limit another's joy, is that really a relationship worth keeping?  Would you want to be controlled by someone else now?  Your daily contentment, because you made choices for yourself, is a better way to live life than living with daily worry, fear, stress, etc. trying to control someone else or think ""what are they doing?"" all the time.  This stuff isn't easy, so focus on how you're feeling.  Then make decisions based on controlling your actions, not his.  Just an opinion."
gayyoungold,32bvj2,Okiedustdevil,2,Sun Apr 12 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"Like people have said, it's not uncommon. Reading the first part of your story reminded me a bit of my relationship. I'm 20 and my partner is 54. We met on growlr, I was the one who messaged him last summer. We chatted for quite a bit, and fooled around, but it wasn't until I went back to college that we both realized how in love we were. He's never been into younger guys, and had been cheated on in the past. This was my first relationship, and I had only been sexually active for a few months. He was worried that I wouldn't like long distance monogamy, said if I needed to find a fuck buddy close to me he would understand as he didn't want to 'hold me back' or anything. I couldn't do that to him though, I knew he was just worried about losing me and I loved him too much to do that to him. We've been happily monogamous for almost a year. The time between visits can be hard, but its always worth it when I'm back with him again. If any of this sounds off topic or rambling I apologize, it's 4AM"

That's true of inter-generational, straight, gay, bi, cuckold, etc etc etc.   I have noticed that more gay relationships tend to be monagamish which is great if thats what people want.   Personally my partner and I are monogamous because, quite simply, that's what I need in a relationship and its part of the package.  I have seen a lot of people argue that the more liberal partner sets the boundaries, I think it should be the other way."
gayyoungold,32bvj2,Whitedragon2,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:26:03 2015 UTC,"I can see how the exchange in bed would bother you.  That doesn't seem like the proper time or place for that.  I also think you have every right to speak up when something bothers you in a relationship, especially when it comes to open or monogamous relationships.  From what I have seen, open relationships only work when both partners are very honest and upfront.  Its the sneaking around and lying that can ruin it.  Though I can't speak from a place of experience.  I've only been in monogamous relationships.  But the reason for that is that all my partners have wanted a monogamous relationship.  You have to make sure you and he want the same thing out of relationship or else it could become an issue down the road.  You two should probably do some talking/thinking about what you want and what you expect from each other in a relationship.  Best of luck to you and hope you find happiness."

gayyoungold,31suzl,Timmy_Bean88,9,Tue Apr 7 22:12:14 2015 UTC,"You should think about what's most important to you. If your marriage and the vows you took are most important, and if they are in conflict with fucking around with an older man, then I'd recommend the following:     Open a dialogue with your spouse If you can't, seek counseling to discover if you can put words to it and discuss it with your spouse If you can't then, I'd recommend examining your relationship critically, and determine if you did the right thing.   I'm an older man, and I have sex with married younger men, but I'm not sure how anyone can compromise someone they're supposed to love as deeply as what you're suggesting without considerable destructive tendencies."
gayyoungold,31suzl,thistime_neveragain,3,Tue Apr 7 23:18:34 2015 UTC,The guys you sleep with are they happy after the sleep with you? Is it a one time thing? If it's self destructive should I talk to the counselor about that instead of what to say to my wife?
gayyoungold,31suzl,thistime_neveragain,6,Tue Apr 7 23:23:55 2015 UTC,"Of the married guys I've slept with in the past ten years, three have told their wives eventually and tried to negotiate a new relationship with her. Of those three, two were successful and have open relationships, and one divorced but they're both now much happier. Of the married guys I sleep with now, none have the inclination to tell their wife, but all have spoken to me about the relationship at least once, and most of those conversations I've had with them start with a guilt-ridden telephone call to me to discuss ""something important"".    I don't know anything about you or your relationship, but you call it cheating, and therefore my suspicion is that you'd have some amount of guilt. I have met the occasional guy who doesn't give a fuck about his vows, or the fact that he's getting fucked by a gay man who has multiple partners, but almost everyone ends up giving some amount of fucks and feels guilt.    The guilt sucks and I know because I spent seven long years fucking around on my ex-husband. By doing so, I corrupted my sense of self and what was most important to me. It doesn't matter that he didn't love me like a husband should (and I'm not referring to sex), the end result was that I ended up destroying something important...I destroyed my understanding of my Self by being unfaithful. Frequently. With men and women. And frequently doesn't even begin to describe how much I fucked around.    Before i started fucking atound, I never thought of myself as someone who would break my vows...someone who'd cheat in a marriage. I'm a monogamous guy, and that was part of my identity. Cheating changed me.  Now, I've told you about why it sucks to cheat (my perspective). Now I'll answer your other question. Yes, the guys leave happy. The married 23 year old I fucked today walked out laughing because he was so high from our sex. I have a lot of sex and I'm good at it.    If you seek counseling, the first thing out of your mouth should be the central problem statement, which is: I'm married and I have a crush on an older dude. And then, take it from there. Discuss the destructive aspects of cheating. Discuss how you might bring it up with your wife. Discuss everything because you have multiple chances not to fuck up your life and hers by acting responsibly.    Let me know if you'd like to chat some more."

Great post, but I think he has to think about something else before he tackles these issues.   OP ends his post saying that he doesn't agree with cheating but that the idea of cheating excites him. Now I could be over analyzing this, however this seems like a greater problem than being attracted to or having feelings for another person. This is where it starts going into the territory of hoping something will happen and where he won't be able to stop himself from trying to make it happen. Destructive aspects of cheating aside, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that his brain will underestimate them even after a discussion because he wants something to happen--and it's entirely possible that it could be with someone other than this older man."

Thanks for pointing it out though; I couldn't find a way to transition from or to your point in my own post. At this point, I'm certain he would like the decision taken out of his hands by having the sweet older man making the first move, but my reaction to that is that OP really needs to confront things in a more head-on fashion. Thanks for your great post, too."
gayyoungold,31suzl,2scompany,2,Wed Apr 8 17:28:46 2015 UTC,"At this stage of the game there's not much to get concerned about...unless there's more to the story.  With this 'sweet older guy' maybe nothing will ever happen - and if it does you may find it a big letdown, leading nowhere. On the other hand....  If, in general, you have a very strong gay sexual urge perhaps you're a lot less straight than you and your wife think, and that can have consequences.    You need to figure out how strongly same sex oriented you are, which will indicate whether you should act on it or not."

gayyoungold,31pg4m,KngHrts2,3,Tue Apr 7 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think it makes you a gold digger. I think it means you have an attraction to people whom you can learn from to emulate in your own life. It's a kind of mentorship that's very common in young-old relationships. I think for a lot of older guys too there's a certain attraction to providing guidance as well as affection to their younger partner.   In fact, in Ancient Greece most homoerotic relationships began with a master-apprentice relationship, the younger man was expected to learn from his older partner as well as provide him with  sexual contact. It might be something innate in people with a predisposition towards an older partner.   The only thing I would caution about is falling in love with the success, rather than the man. What happens if he loses it all? Or there is someone more successful who comes along? You have to be willing to stand by him, otherwise, then yes, you are taking advantage."
gayyoungold,31pg4m,PrinterRepairSpec,2,Tue Apr 7 13:21:41 2015 UTC,"I'm actually the opposite. I like an older man who, for lack of a better word, isn't a tryhard. I'd rather a guy who can't stand suits and wants to go around in polo shirts, shorts, and sandals all day, and who isn't a total mess but never put his career first in his life. I don't like goal-oriented, or guys who like to impress others. Much more impressive when a man is at peace with himself with no regard for what society values."

We only see each other maybe every 6 months or so, so it's a big deal when we're together. I think we do two things specifically every time we get together. Whenever we're in private for the first time we melt into an extremely sensual hug--it was the one action when we first met that made us both feel as though we were made for each other. The second is an expensive dinner where we can get all dressed up and stuff ourselves silly. These might sound silly but I cherish them.  A new one that we recently started is swapping a bracelet we bought for each other whenever we see each other in person.

gayyoungold,31h2hb,youyouyuyu,19,Sun Apr 5 00:37:42 2015 UTC,"For me, it isn't necessarily about age. Mature men just tend to have more of what I'm attracted to in terms of physical attraction and personality. Keep in mind that emotional attachments are supported a great deal by whether or not you're actually physically attracted to someone; at least in the beginning.   I'm a very picky individual but I'll highlight some of the things I know turn me on. I'll also put in a disclaimer that these aren't universal-- it really depends on the specific person. In general, I'm attracted to men with a bit of meat on their bones. Whether that means muscles or the weight that comes with age, as long as he wears it well. Chest hair. I love chest hair. A beard is a bonus as well, although nowadays everyone seems to have one if they are able to. A hint of grey here and there also gets my juices flowing.  Older men also tend to have their own way of being calm and confident, their demeanor usually oozes masculinity without a conscious effort. Not sure if this is true for everyone, but I have a perception of the ""perfect"" guy being strong and rugged and older guys usually show that without trying or flaunting it. The funny thing is that I also like guys who know who they are, and aren't afraid to show sides of themselves that might contradict the typical macho image.   Obviously there are a lot of other things that forms my attraction to a guy. And I'm sure there are lots of men that will both support and contradict what I've written, but I think older guys tend to have these qualities at least moreso than younger ones."
gayyoungold,31h2hb,MTmind561,7,Sun Apr 5 01:40:09 2015 UTC,"The hell? You're basically saying everything (including the little bits and pieces) that Id find attractive in older men. You pretty much just saved me the effort of typing out a reply lol.  The only thing I'd add is how much more experienced and mature older men are compared to young men. They carry this hint of knowledge or experience (of sex, wisdom, or relationships) that really keep me attracted to an aura of them. Their hearts have also been softened up by the years too. I cherish that."
gayyoungold,31h2hb,Stephanick,4,Sun Apr 5 05:58:25 2015 UTC,you both nailed exactly what i thinking aswell. I think the last big take away for me is life experience.

gayyoungold,31h2hb,throrowaway,2,Sun Apr 5 11:00:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's about it for me.   I've always been attracted to more masculine guys that are basically the farthest thing from femininity possible. Beards, chest hair, larger bodies, gray hairs, lumberjacky type guys.   I haven't been in many relationships yet so I can't exactly tell what I appreciate mentally/emotionally yet. The establishment and experience that comes with it doesn't hurt, though."

It's like the older you get the more masculine you get. Receding hairlines are even a sign of masculinity, and most men don't get that until they're middle aged. I like emotionally mature people too, and it's just natural for wisdom to come with age. Although not in every case, unfortunately. lol.   For straight men it feels like (i could be wrong, since I'm not straight myself) that feminity focuses on younger women and innocence rather than experience and age. At the very least, so much of our media focuses on the fear of aging which is especially relates to women."

Emotionally, I never felt attracted to guys my own age because they were never ready for a real relationship, they hadn't figured out who they were yet, and I just instinctively liked older men from a young age.   Older men tend to be more secure with who they are, they don't seem to care so much about what people think. And just like youyouyuyu mentioned, they tend to look and act more masculine. I love heftier guys with a more meat and muscle. Body hair. And sexually they typically know what turns them on and aren't shy to voice it.   For me, I love older men who are more dominant in bed. A guy who takes control turns me on. And I agree with pBert, that there might be a paternal component to it, but I don't consider myself to have any ""daddy issues.""

gayyoungold,31h2hb,sub_woofer,1 point,Sun Apr 5 06:27:40 2015 UTC,"here's some of the things that i like about older guys. i like silver hair. idk why but it is visceral. i like white moustaches. very, very much.  i agree with what youyouyuyu said about bigger guys and about how older men are unconsciously masculine via confidence. i also agree with hairy chests.   i never got any affection from my dad. i think that might be part of it. i'm really after affection more than anything else. i know people get defensive when it's brought up that there might be a paternal component to our sexuality but that's what i believe. i've been thinking about this for 20 years now.   i've been with my partner for 10 years and all the guys i'm attracted to look like him. because i love him so much, he's what i notice in other guys."
gayyoungold,31h2hb,pBert00,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:46:21 2015 UTC,"I hate the idea that you have to have daddy issues and that your father had to be distant for you to to enjoy paternal people, sexually and romantically. I don't disagree that there's a paternal component to sexuality though. I just don't think daddy issues are the reason.That could just be your preference because you enjoy it and it makes you feel safe. I feel like there are a lot of straight couples of the same age who take care of each other in a similar way that isn't as obvious.  I think the reason other people say daddy issues makes you like older guys is because it's subtly homophobic, and they are trying to find literally any reason to justify something that does not need to be justified because they find it gross but can't think of a better reason why it would happen.  It was meant to be condenscening at first.  People seem to think that you're trying to find people that are older because they you remind him physically of your dad, which is horrible.  Literally everyone who wants romantic relationships desires affection.   Just my two cents. I know you're not saying this, a lot of my opinions have been formed from what I feel is the stigma of my own preference. I'm sure you must have gotten worse comments about it which is why you said people get defensive. :P Sorry if this comes across harsh or angry, I just like talking about it."

I'm also now extremely interested in more aspects of different cultures and languages even though I'm from a pretty ""exotic"" background.  I'd say he's gained an interest in sports, mainly soccer, as he's never really found them to be interesting before he met me. He has also become almost as much of a foodie as I am. As with a lot of others on here, he picked up more of a desire to watch television and movies.

Years ago as a kid my dad attempted to have me play every sport under the sun so golf was one he attempted to have me try.  I ended up hating it as it required too much patience and I couldn't stop swinging ""like a baseball player"".    My husband started golfing because he knew it would help him rub elbows with higher ups in the charity he helps over see and had me do a little practicing when his sessions ran long.  He bought me a set of lessons for my birthday and also bought our oldest child a set of clubs to use (which I can also use as we about same height and lefties).  I was surprised how much I started liking it and the coaching really helped.  Been practicing all fall/winter and I'm excited to see how I will do.  Too bad I have a bad back issue currently and have to stop golfing for a few weeks while it clears up.  I don't want to miss out on golfing with my husband and our 2 kids for the first time :(  I'm not sure what, if anything, I've gotten my husband into.  The only video games he will play is ones on his phone and that's very rare.  Most shows I turn him onto he loses interest after a few seasons (Walking Dead, Elementary, House, and others).  I think I motived him to start eating better and taking care of himself more.  He was very over weight when me met and has lost about 300lbs so far.  He wants to lose more to hit his goal but I love him no matter what he looks like.  And I'm sure to tell him that often."

If you think your co-worker is mature enough, willing to give it a try without promises or expectations, and working in the same place might not create an awkward atmosphere, try it out but do it step-by-step.  Meet somewhere neutral and talk it over.  My only concern is that he said you have to ""have to"" identify yourself.  At this point you don't.  I've had things like this happen to me and it takes both sides to agree that if things don't work out there'll be no guilt trips, embarrassment and the like.  This part is easier said than done.  If there's a genuine concern that a hookup or relationship would be disruptive in the workplace, go no further.  Back to the ""have to tell me who you are"" remark; it sounds a little pushy.  If he'd said something like  ""I respect your caution and will not pressure you to tell me who you are""  I'd be more comfortable with divulging your identity to him.  Bottom line:  Sexual relationships are easily gotten into, but never easily forgotten and 99% of the time it's a bad idea in a close-quarters workplace.  Stay anonymous and move on."

What I've found is that it's easier for you (and others like you) to accept and embrace your gay side when I tell you what I want you to do rather than expecting you to initiate.   In my dom scenes I also use blindfolds and bondage - again, the idea of being 'forced' to be gay is more of a turn on than vanilla sex.  In addition to the blindfold increasing sensory feelings, I've found that some guys in denial about their gay side prefer to do, and not see to whom they are doing it.  You'll find guys on CL advertising as dom dads looking for boy toys.   I don't use CL, but I use the other sites that have been recommended here.  Feel free to pm if you want more help.  Good luck.  P.S.  I don't mean to say that being sub implies that you are in denial about your gay side.   Being sub is a hot experience all by itself.  So, rest assured that you are in good company and completely normal."

gayyoungold,30qnir,toolz0,2,Mon Mar 30 04:35:52 2015 UTC,"I can certainly relate to what you're seeking, both from the point I'm at now (an older guy) and when I was younger and wrestling with my own desires and emotions connected to my sexuality and sexual orientation. It can often be a struggle, but I agree with you -- better to explore and see what happens (safely and in a healthy way) I don't think you're being stupid. You're taking the right precautions. I don't think you're in denial either. You seem to have a good understanding of who you are, what your desires are, the extent of those desires, and what you're looking for. I've been in a similar position, but from the older/dom side. I've played around with a two different guys recently who seemed to be in a similar state of mind. They weren't romantically attracted to men, but they got turned on by the thought of being dominated and sexually controlled by an older man. They weren't sure of their sexualities beyond this immediate desire. And that's perfectly fine.   Overall, I think you're fine. I would add two pieces of unsolicited advice: (1) meet in public first, even if just over coffee; and (2) very, very clearly communicate what you want to do and do not want to do. Any decent dom is going to talk to you about that anyway, but be very up front. Even if you have to admit you're very nervous, shy, uncertain, or whatever and you need some help talking out loud. Take whatever steps you need to make sure he understands exactly what you want. And take it from there.  But, of course, we expect you to report back after the fact.  :-)"

My father doesn't want to meet him either, he says I'll regret it. My boyfriend's family, however is great. I've been over for xmas and his mother loves me!

Here is my experience in telling my family and their reaction:   Well I can tell you from my experience that not all families and friends take the news the wrong way. My husband was the reason I came out to my family and he is 24 years older then me. I came out to my parents first, who gave me nothing but love when I did. I told my older brother and sister a few months later via email while away at school. But I never told my family how much older he was then me, just that he was older. We (my husband and I) decided it might be easier for both my family and him to slowly introduce my husband to my family. First he came with me to meet my older brother for lunch, then he met my parents at their home for dinner with me, and finally we all gathered for a holiday where he was welcomed by all. To this day he is still amazed how accepting my family is, but of course that also makes my family weird to him, HA!  The best was when my husband came to one of my big family gatherings for the first time. When we arrived my god father walked right up to my husband hugged him, kissed him on the cheek, and said how glad he was to finally met him. After that, the ice was broken so everyone started to greet him and chat him up. He is a great talker so it didn't surprise me that he took to striking up conversations with everyone so quickly.  I think the reason it went so well was because of how happy I had become since meeting my husband. My family saw how much better my life became after I came out to them and how I improved overall as person after meeting my husband. I know not all families are like mine.   EDIT= I should mention my husband has never come out to his family and never will. They have met me but its unspoken in his family that he and I are married with kids. Its hard but he is not close with his family and they live far away from us so its not really an issue.   I'll never forget the hug my mother gave me after I told her I was gay or the back slapping hug my dad gave me right after she hugged me.  I knew right then that things would be ok."

gayyoungold,2zwjtz,throwaway_gyo,2,Sun Mar 22 14:07:02 2015 UTC,"I remember watching this movie when I was younger. I can't remember the part about the age disparity in that character's relationships. I must have been too young to understand fully. I'm a severely depressed young guy who is into older guys which caused a lot of problems in my life when I was younger, so yeah I think this movie would hit too close to home if I tried to watch it now. Maybe it hit close to home back then too because none of this is new in my life, and I just blocked it out/forgot.   Are there any other movies with gay/young old couples or subplots that are subtle? If anyone knows they should post them. It's really interesting.  I think there was an younger/older couple in Sherlock but I can't remember if they were younger/older or just that one guy was bigger and hairier. It was hilarious because they kept thinking Sherlock and Watson were a gay couple.  The only example I have is from Pokemon of all things. There was a really strange part of Pokemon Black/White where you go for rides in in a ferris wheel with random people, which is a Japanese thing apparently, and you meet this Hiker class trainer who is older and bigger and harrier and he has the most awkward sexual tensioned filled conversation with  your character who is a little kid, but only if you choose a boy. Then in Pokemon X and Y a random assed NPC says something like ""I know a Hiker[the region the hiker from Black/White takes place in] who found true love!"" Leave it to Japan to put this in a Pokemon game.  Sorry I don't have anything more profound to list, lol.  Oh lord have you seen Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt? It's on Netflix.  There's a goddamn musical about this called Daddy's Boy. There's a whole musical number about it. It's absolutely hilarious. I was in shock and then I died laughing. The way they lead up to it is hilarious too. You just need to see that show. I don't want to give too much away."

It sounds like you have a good family and there is a good chance they'll be supportive in your decision. It might be wise to wait 'til you're over 18, then gradually expose them to your preferences and choices. These things take time, acceptance is slow, and sudden revelations often result in words that can't be forgotten easily. Good luck.   I do have a good family, I'm very lucky to have 'em. As I've wroten on my other comment, I will indeed wait until I'm 18 or over due to the legal concerns to the other party and also I'll have time to prepare and open myself to the idea of dating and such if I do so. My only concern was/is in fact my family and 3rd parties opinions' since I unfortunately care way too much for them and let them control my life.  Thank you once again."
gayyoungold,2zaafi,dadnme,3,Mon Mar 16 23:15:32 2015 UTC,"Coming out as gay and coming out as liking older men are two separate things you will have to figure out how to deal  I came out and came out as liking older men at the same time. I wish I didn’t. The age of my partner really doesn’t matter. If anything it clouds the meaning of the relationship. Most people don’t understand the an attraction to older men. They immediately jump to conclusions and start trying to ‘fix it’. They may start with questions like “why do you like older men?"" Some people believe it’s not right to have such an age difference. It's easier to simply not give them the option to think about it.   I'm sure your family is great, but they can learn certain things in time. They don't need to know it all as it is happening. You are becoming a man, and you have a right to certain privacies, there are things you don't have to share.   Tidbit: you are growing and every year that goes by, the percent older your partner is gets smaller and smaller. When you're 30 and your partner is 55, that's a lot different than when you 18 and your partner is 43..."
gayyoungold,2zaafi,youyouyuyu,2,Mon Mar 16 23:39:21 2015 UTC,"Firstly, thank you a lot for taking the time to comment.  I've got both parts covered, I just don't have the how to deal with people's oppinions covered, which is something that has always affected me in literally everything.  I guess people just forget that we can not choose what we're attracted to, and that's why they ask such things, and even if we could, what's the big deal about feeling phisically attracted to a certain group of individuals? That's something I can't quite understand, but that's some people I guess.  My family is great indeed, but I'm sure this is something they don't see coming and probably will affect them in different ways, I'm just wondering what I can do once I feel ready to let them know that my partner might not be my age or anywhere near it. It's just hard to deal with what they expect from me, atleast when it comes to a SO, they couldn't be any far away from what I'm attracted to, but that's still a long way from now.  Thanks again for your comment! You were very helpful and I'm the type of guy that won't definitely give them the option to say towards it since it's my life, but at the same time will give them space and time to get used to it, if that makes any sense."

I think your rant is unjust and you need to mellow out :) Life isn't just about how many guys you can fuck.
gayyoungold,2z0sf8,heyyouyeahyou55,4,Tue Mar 17 16:53:21 2015 UTC,"Because apps aren't just for hooking up.   Some people (especially the younger generation) also see it as a social outlet. I don't have shirtless photos or extremely descriptive info on my apps because a lot of guys I see there are openly gay friends that I meet on a weekly basis.  Bars are also a social environment AND a pick up spot. Just because I am partnered, should I not go to a gay bar?

In a conservative town it's one of the best ways to meet other guys and couples.   We don't have a gay bar or GSA or any LGBT related events. It's really easy to feel like we're the only ones here, but that's not the case. With all the current political aggression against LGBT lately it's good to build a support base.  However, I make it clear on my profile and immediately in conversation that I am taken and happy and not looking for sex. I've never had anyone complain yet.   What irritates me is the profiles that say partnered or looking for friends that immediately try to fuck me. That gets old."

Consequently I've never been in a ""relationship"" in the traditional sense, and my sexual experiences with men I'm actually attracted to have been almost entirely physical and superfluous with little to no emotional investment.

Not ever single person you're going to meet is going to be a romantic interest so meet people for who they are and enjoy their company.  As for having the intergenerational group of friends.

There are exceptions but usually not.  Best of luck and just enjoy yourself!"

Just be very plain and ask: ""do you have any interest in having a relationship?"". If his answer is ""yes"", then clarify if he has an interest in having a relationship with you. If he says that he doesn't have an interest in a relationship, then you have your answer.     Only you know what boundaries you have emotionally, and it's up to you to assert those boundaries, but to assert boundaries, you must first be operating with the same goal in mind.

Be as passionate as you've ever been in bed whether he is erect or not, don't overdo it but make sure he knows it doesn't matter. If you find yourself being frustrated, just stay patient and try to get him to relax. Have a talk with him outside of sex about it, that may also help.  Look into cock rings.

I told him about some of the recent posts I'd seen in this sub and he said,   ""Stop comparing us to or sizing us up to other couples you read about.  I love you and love me and we're happy so that's all that matters.""  Yes there are plenty of liars and cheats out there but there are wonderful guys too.  I've been cheated on, my husband has been cheated on, but now that we have found each other and because of how our past relationships have effected us I think ours will continue growing stronger.

It's most likely just a combination of inexperience but there seems to be something deeper in it. To me, there's something objectifying of using the term ""daddy"" for an older man. It seems so archetypical/shallow. As if it wouldn't matter who it was, just so long as he was older/younger and erotic. I hope I don't sound like an asshole but it shouldn't be a surprise that the ""perfect daddy"" or ""perfect son"" isn't much more than a fantasy.   Different strokes, I guess... I just can't imagine calling my partner daddy or him calling me son. I know in my teenaged years, experimenting, I didn't really know what I wanted in a relationship so it was shallow. In my defense, some of the older men that I encountered seemed to only want the dynamic & not much more. They want the taboo but not an actual relationship. I know I found it unpleasant. I'm just attracted to older men, not the daddy/son stuff. I've got not rights to judge though... As I said, different strokes. Still though, I've been around the block enough to know that if you build your relationships on such fragile foundations, they don't stand up for much else."
gayyoungold,2y1odf,GerontoMan,3,Thu Mar 5 19:57:27 2015 UTC,"I personally like the Daddy / boy relation a lot...it's fun when there's mutual respect + when I care about someone. I like having a mentor, etc., so this sort or relationship has worked for me. It adds another level to things intellectually and sexually for me. I do agree that it can’t just be about age + aesthetic. That’s why I don’t think you can just go out and find a daddy, it has to be something that happens organically. You also have to want it.   Just because someone is older means that they’re a daddy – it’s a state of mind. In fact I think that the younger person in the relationship can be the daddy. This concept took me a long time to understand"
gayyoungold,2y1odf,numbtoes41,3,Thu Mar 5 21:30:48 2015 UTC,"41 yr old here, recently out < 2 years. But I knew for a long long time. I am partially disabled. I prefer older men - am attracted to men 15-20 years older than myself. I dont call them daddy, its not my fantasy, just a physical attraction. But I also feel more emotionally satisfied with an older man. I am not really a sub but I spend all day making tons of decisions for kids (teacher) and when I come home I want someone else to take charge at times. I also am not that experienced and like a guy who is more emotionally experienced, has more dating experience, and experience in the sack.  It doesnt hurt that I can usually stay hard longer in bed and as someone with a disability, its nice to feel physically stronger. I cant keep up with guys my own age physically, and usually when they see me, they see my cane. With an older guy, this isnt the case as often."
gayyoungold,2xw74f,handsomepurple,2,Wed Mar 4 10:13:23 2015 UTC,"Best advice I can give you; don't rush to find a bedpartner.  My bf and I sometimes takes months and months before we find someone we are both comfortable with. Though usually it's someone younger (he likes bottom-twinks, I mainly like older-tops), it's always someone we can both have fun with.  You just need to find someone you both find appealing. It might not be the looks, for you it might for example be someone younger, but he might be appealing to you in a different way. Very dominating or submissive for example. Or does certain things in bed your bf wouldn't do. That kind of stuff.  Just take your time in your search, you have the internet and its billion users as your database. There is without a doubt a guy you both like and is into the both of you, somewhere online :)"

By no means are we rushing into this, so will definitely keep it on the back burner till someone pops up.

As mentioned in another post, I may have overthought the idea of an threesome. Should look at it for what it just is, sex.

gayyoungold,2xw74f,PirateCodingMonkey,-5,Thu Mar 5 08:31:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry to apply judgement here. Am I the only one that feels three ways are sort of the demonstration of failure in a relationship?   I concede, 3ways aren't right for me, and they might be fun for others. But what do they accomplish? Are 2 person relationships just boring? I know of so many three ways that end up threatening the core of the relationship. It's really common... So why risk it, unless the core relationship isn't that serious in the first place and therefore is worth risking?"
gayyoungold,2xw74f,Robolabo,2,Wed Mar 4 15:26:47 2015 UTC,"My bf and I have been together for 4 years now, and are still happily counting.  We've had multiple threesomes over the years and are still looking for a third every couple of months. I know for a fact that looking for a third says nothing about the status of your relationship.   As what they accomplish? It's pure fun. Like adding a sex-toy to your sex life. Using a dildo on your bf says nothing on how well you perform in bed without it, or how well your relationship is going. The only difference is that this sex-toy moves on its own, doesn't need batteries and makes the occasional hot sound. Hell, it even cleans itself afterwards.  The only way it can ruin your relationship is if there are already problems. But then again, going on holiday will ruin it just the same."
gayyoungold,2xw74f,dadnme,0,Wed Mar 4 16:05:45 2015 UTC,"In your metaphor the third person is a sex-toy. The problem is the sex-toy is a person just like you. I get your point.

I could tell I had hurt him, so I apologized and I reassured him that I don't hate him or think he's a monster. We've agreed to be friends or whatever we decide to call our relationship.

I recommend finding a fun hobby to fill some of your extra time. By the time you've processed all of it and you're ready to move on - you'll have developed a skill/hobby to enrich your life.   Part of the grief in the dissolution of a relationship is feeling lost in yourself. Without a strong sense of self (particularly common in the young), it's easy to forget that you can make it OK on your own. We forget what we did by ourselves. Try to embrace it, make it your bitch and come out the other side smiling."

It's entirely okay to only be attracted to older men simply because they're older.  Young guys just don't do anything for me sexually 99% of the time, and I won't pretend otherwise.    That doesn't mean that the sole reason I'm with my husband is that he's older than me.  Sure, that played a role in the initial physical attraction, but every aspect of his personality was what made me fall in love with him.  People like what they like.  Some people call it a fetish because it's easier to make sense of the attraction if they label it.  ""How could they like someone who I'm not attracted to?  Must be some weird fetish, since I know I'm normal!""  If anything, you should be more annoyed at that."

gayyoungold,2wujqo,FriesBaconNaked501,2,Tue Feb 24 02:10:17 2015 UTC,"I like older men because I do. It makes me wonder why anyone would like younger men. I consider liking someone the same age a 'fetish'. Even though the true definition of a 'fetish'; is an attraction to inanimate objects, like shoes.   When someone calls an attraction to older men unnatural or abnormal, I can question their attraction to someone younger, with the same logic and quickly leave them without retort. Once we get past their initial bias their is very little logical argument standing against the basis for intergenerational relationships. In fact, they make quite a bit of sense in this day and age."

(also, a mental illness but that's another issue.) when something is not mainstream, it is something that other people will comment on and try to marginalize.  the more important question is, why are you letting other people's opinions bother you? yes, i know it's hard to set-aside what people say, but in the long run it is your relationship and your life. if you are happy, ignore the haters (and hum Taylor Swift.)"
gayyoungold,2wujqo,PirateCodingMonkey,1 point,Mon Feb 23 14:05:07 2015 UTC,"I think everyone has a different interpretation of what constitutes a fetish.  There are also differing views on whether a ""fetish"" should have a negative or positive connotation.  And (insert witty reference to ""Inception"" here), there are even fetishes within fetishes.  For example, if an intergenerational relationship is a fetish then I have a sub-fettish where we contribute equally in terms of finances, chores, grocery store runs, etc.).  Fortunately, I'm dating a man who is also into this kind of lifestyle.  Kinky, right?    Could be wrong, but I think what OP is bothered by are the relationships that exist for what seem like wrong reasons (finances, psychological instability, etc.).  I used to be bothered by this, too, because if I was making these assumptions about others, they were probably doing the same with me.  However, I second /u/piratecodingmonkey...it's not important what other people think about someone else's relationship.

Prime Timers has chapters all over the place, and ask around to see if there is an older social club or wrinkle room bar and go there.  A real time saver over weeding out flakes online, plus most older men are NOT technology friendly so your happy hunting ground may not require wifi."
gayyoungold,2w96wy,thehogdog,1 point,Wed Feb 18 00:38:46 2015 UTC,"It's common for people who have little experience dating or self control.  Dumping a bunch of big feelings on someone you've recently met is a red flag for so many.  It basically screams ""I'm needy and probably irrational."" Even if you aren't.  What I suggest is looking for some other gay guys your age to be friends with so you can talk to someone about your newly freed emotions and keep them entirely separate from romantic feelings as the two don't mesh very well.  While your reasons may not stem from crazy, not many people looking for romance will see that.  They'll see you as someone who will depend entirely too much on them emotionally, instead of grounded and a potential partner.  And next time you write an email and it is longer than a few sentences, save it and reread it the next day to see if it looks like a good idea to send."

I think I just got carried away. I did look into an over 40 gay meetup in my area. They have potlucks twice a month. I am going to go and check it out. They also do a lot of other things. Thanks for the suggestion about Prime Timers, there is a chapter in my area."

gayyoungold,2w5psl,Robolabo,3,Tue Feb 17 22:05:42 2015 UTC,"Well, for one, a lot of dating websites geared towards the younger/older crowd require you to be a paying member to get access to many features like sending multiple messages a day. I literally get 1 message I can send on silverdaddies and 4 messages on daddydater.    I think by having a subreddit geared towards us here is so much better since we can already PM each other. It's just the pictures part that poses an issue."

There's a big problem of anonimity here. unlike other websites and apps, the unknown factors on reddit are much higher, and it's easier to create a false persona."

gayyoungold,2vyr3k,rdox,5,Sun Feb 15 12:02:37 2015 UTC,"I suspect, and this is based on my own experience, that the situation is largely age-related.  I'm 67 and noticed declining desire after 50.  Rather than being the most important thing in my life, sex has fallen behind a good night's sleep, workouts, diet and domestic chores.  Maybe you should discuss a more open relationship with him"
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,FriesBaconNaked501,2,Sun Feb 15 12:31:27 2015 UTC,I've thought about that in the past. But I don't think it would work out in the end. I feel like it would be the cause of more problems and lead to a break up on a really bad note. He's really against them too.  I appareciate the thought though. Thank you.
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,FriesBaconNaked501,3,Sun Feb 15 12:46:05 2015 UTC,"Good luck.  Maybe some day I'll find a young partner that's as considerate as you.  While it may not be the top thing on my list, I'm still enjoying the occasional sex with much younger men, but I doubt I could handle a daily romp."
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,mick_dog,1 point,Sun Feb 15 13:02:56 2015 UTC,Hah. I'm not really interested in a daily romp either. Once a week would be good for me but if he feels up for it I would certainly do more. :D
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,Robolabo,3,Sun Feb 15 13:14:09 2015 UTC,"my bf (57) and i (26) have an open relationship (with the stipulation that we play safe and tell each other about every encounter) so we've never had a problem like yours. i'm not sure how ANY couple can expect to be 100% sexually matched and meet each other's needs all the time, with that age gap and constant contact it seems like you're asking for trouble.  i think you're spot on with stress being the issue. work, family, money, partner stuff all piles on and elevates cortisol and norepinephrine all day long. so sleep sucks, waking up sucks, even diet and workouts lose all their savor. and your weenie can't get hard.  so you could work your ass off and reduce his stress in any way you can for a few weeks before you try to discuss it with him. and just jerk off in the mean time. i don't have any other advice."
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,mick_dog,3,Sun Feb 15 16:27:45 2015 UTC,"I really agree with your comment about compatability. My partner and I are both more top than bottom, so we've starting having guys over. We both enjoy it, but it can be hard to find someone into both of us, we both have pretty broad taste and that helps.    This next part has no bearing on OP's situation but just general commentary: I hear from a lot of guys who say ""You're both tops?! How did you end up together?"" and my interal response is always ""Is a dick in an ass worth more than happiness?"" I'd much rather be with someone I love than have the greatest sex in the world."
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,youyouyuyu,3,Sun Feb 15 17:37:04 2015 UTC,"i don't have much experience but i'll discuss it anyway.  it's AMAZING to me that people will commit to each other sexually (like when they get married) and not think of it as some sort of sexual bondage. i have buddies that got married at 20 after knowing their wife for less than a year... how are they supposed to promise lifelong monogamy at that age, or at that level of experience? if they ARE supposed to promise that... way too kinky for me."
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,RustyGuns,4,Sun Feb 15 18:18:15 2015 UTC,"Everyone has their own comfort levels with sex, and monogamy is, at least for the majority of people, the safest and most conventional. I personally don't have anything against open relationships. I see the appeal and I know why couples do it, and I also know its becoming increasingly the norm in today's society.   But I prefer monogamy through and through. Whether I've known the other person a year or 20, it's just better for me. I feel as though it allows me to connect with that person more. Sex is special to me, love heightens it of course but as much as I can lust for someone other than my boyfriend... I see sex as something I should only share with him. That sort of intimacy isn't something I think everyone should be privy to. It's not bondage, to me it is more respectful. Call me old fashioned."
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,MoonAsMyWitnessLOVE,4,Sun Feb 15 18:49:19 2015 UTC,"That is exactly how I feel about relationships. If I am with someone I only want to be with them (emotionally and physically). Personally I love being the one guy for someone, I find it makes everyone feel special.   I have seen many relationships deteriorate after the bored couple brings in randoms to sleep with. It just doesn't feel right to me.   Everyone is different though which I respect."
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,mick_dog,4,Sun Feb 15 21:32:57 2015 UTC,"This. For me personally, I can confidently say my boyfriend is the only one I want. Do I see other attractive men through out my day, yeah. Do I have any desire to have sex with them, nope. When I'm in love, other people just lose their appeal and I find myself only wanting to be with my man. Open relationships will only work if everyone involved is on bored and okay with it and with no doubts. I personally don't like them."
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,Robolabo,2,Sun Feb 15 22:45:49 2015 UTC,"Sex is special to me,    me too.   love heightens it of course   yep, same here.   but as much as I can lust for someone other than my boyfriend... I see sex as something I should only share with him.   it's an old fashioned kink alright."
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,2scompany,2,Sun Feb 15 19:17:14 2015 UTC,I've never thought about it that way. Haha!
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,Whitedragon2,3,Sun Feb 15 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"Some people's interest in things - including people and sex - just exhausts after a period of time. Why?  Its probably their nature. Also, living and growing together causes relationships to change : you're different from 3 years ago, as is he : and the obligations and stresses you have are constant, apparent and perhaps a bit resented.    Personally I think when sex disappears from a homosexual relationship there a 3 choices 1) end it 2) live as friends (forever...) and / or 3) be non monagamous.  But at your age I'd be considering my best option...."
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,Whitedragon2,2,Mon Feb 16 15:17:30 2015 UTC,"Expecting sex can put unnecessary pressure on your boyfriend that will cause him to not be that excited about sex.  Don't resent him for it either as it just makes things worse.  Try to approach this in a way that you are seeking more intimacy, not sex.  Sex is important in a relationship IMO, but without intimacy sex dose not often happen.  Do you guys do any intimate stuff together besides sex? Back rubs? Foot rubs?  Massages?  Shower together?  Curl up to each other while watching TV/movie?  How about cuddling together in PJs or underwear?  From my experience with my husband, massages can be super enjoyable to older guys.  My husband has even admitted to me that he kind of likes it better then sex.  Which is totally ok, because sometimes during a massage he suddenly wants more.  It's all about setting the mood and making that special connection between you two.  How about surprising him with a candle lit dinner?  From my experience my husband likes to come home from work some days to little surprises like that or candles lit in the house.  Maybe dress up nice and greet him when he comes in with flowers.  Put a little mood setting music on and slow dance together.  I have no idea if your boyfriend will like this stuff but my husband seems to think these shows of affections and it makes him feel special.  Just don't do it every day, it makes it less meaningful I learned.   The thing to remember is don't expect him to have sex just because you do this.  Yes you are doing it as a show of flattery to him, but if he associates gestures like that with an expectation of sex it will build resent me and take away from the fun you two are supposed to be having.  Before all this though talk to him about the need for intimacy and connecting with him on a personal level.  Something that is special to just you two.  Yes this is tied to sex, but sex will come when you two spend more intimate time together.  Have meals without taking cell phones out or other distractions and just talk.  Maybe plan for a short get away (a day or 2) with just to the two of you and make that time matter with conversations, intimacy, and avoiding outside distractions like work.  Oh and in regards to his family, if they are toxic (as in he is in a bad mood after speaking/dealing with them) then you have to talk to him about how its affecting the relationship between you two.  My husband has some nutter butter family members in another state and he learned long before I met them that they will ruin his relationships if he lets them.  Sometimes you just can't be an enabler and you have to just cut people off.  I have no clue the kind of relationship your boyfriend has with his family but if they are having an effect on your relationship you have to talk to him about it.  Its not about him cutting ties with them but about the negativity of them seeping into your loving bond.  He has to find a way to not let that happen.  I wish you both luck and hope this helps.  My husband and I have been together for about 13 years now and in the last 2 years I've never been happier because we started doing things like I mentioned above.  Hopefully they work for you 2 as well :D"
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,Whitedragon2,2,Sun Feb 15 18:19:07 2015 UTC,"You made me realize that what I am really missing is intimacy. Sex comes with it but not the only thing. It seems like we have lost our intimacy.  I do not expect sex from him any more. I haven't for a long time. Occasionally I'll make a motion if I get the slightest hint he could be interested but I don't think about it as much any more. We'll be cuddled togethor when we watch TV. We did rubs and massages in the past but it's hard for him to let me give him them any more! If he's stressed and we're lying down in the bedroom just talking, I'll try to give him a back rub and he'll freak out he's not doing work and start working.  We often go out of our way to surprise each other and that hasn't changed. He usually works from home during the week so I am usually the one to come home after a long day of classes to a dinner he made. I do the same when he's out driving and comes home late.   His family doesn't know about us. Too risky. The issues with them is over his mother's money, his inheritance and his siblings trying to take from him. Nasty stuff and has to be taken care of.   I'll keep what you said in mind. <3"
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,youyouyuyu,2,Sun Feb 15 20:12:44 2015 UTC,"It bothers him that much to not be working?  That to me sounds like an issue of his that needs to be addressed because it seems to be connected to other aspects of your relationship.  If you aren't relaxed then sex and the other stuff is never going to be on your radar.  Being with someone you love should be enjoyable and allow you to unwind, not worrying about getting back to work.  Dose he always have difficulty just not doing anything?  Dose he take time to relax?  When is the last time he took some time off?  My husband is a workaholic too between his high stress job and the charity work he dose outside of his full time job.  Getting him to just let go and relax is difficult, but it is important that he dose that because he understands my desire for intimacy with him.  Stress shortens your life and makes it difficult in general to have a loving relationship.  Have you approached him in a manner that you are worried about his health because of how little he relaxes?  We have 2 kids and health is an issue we both take very seriously now because we need to be around a long time for the kids.  If he is the one bringing up the fact that he feels bad for not having more sexy time with you then at least he knows the problem.  The issue seems to be getting that fire lit in him again.  When was the last time you two took a break from life and had a vacation together?  Is that even something you can both do or dose his work prevent that?"
gayyoungold,2vyr3k,youyouyuyu,2,Sun Feb 15 21:00:27 2015 UTC,"He's definitely not relaxed. The business is selling on eBay so the work is mostly buy things and make a listing, fire it and forget it. Of course that's my mentality on it.   I wouldn't say he's a workaholic, but he has to work. And if he only has X amount of energy in the day, he has to prioritize how he spends his time. His relaxing time is usually in the evening watching British TV shows I download for him.   It's hard for us to take a break. I go to school full time. We both work on the weekends plus our home business. We did take a short trip about 6 months ago. We made a conscious effort to do any work. No real intimacy was had on that trip. It would be nice to take a trip again. I'm not sure where. But it's difficult to get our both our weekend shifts off and would make him uncomfortable and worry about his job security.  Pretty much all his stress comes down to money. But he is not good at managing the stress. I handle probably over half of the home work load + my own school work."
gayyoungold,2vocgb,grandpa_h,-2,Thu Feb 12 18:25:37 2015 UTC,This is awful. I'm pretty sure you just made me straight.
gayyoungold,2vmoj0,gosutag,2,Thu Feb 12 06:56:24 2015 UTC,"He wasn't good to you. You are better off with out him. Eventually you'll find a really hot older man that's interested in you, and he will start to care for you. This guy you speak of now, he didn't care about you. He did you a favor by ending it ending so you can find some one better. I'm not gonna lie it takes a while to get over some guys. Go one a date or two with some nice hot older guys."
gayyoungold,2vmoj0,dadnme,1 point,Thu Feb 12 12:36:01 2015 UTC,"I want to believe that, but why did he go through so much trouble? That's what gets to me. Why would he get me to pa, and dc and then suddenly disappear after a month or two of conversing. . ."
gayyoungold,2vmoj0,dadnme,2,Thu Feb 12 14:13:47 2015 UTC,"Some guys are weird and manipulative. Some guys are afraid. Some guys are just in it for the chase, when you go for it they aren't interested any more. It could be a combination of all of the above. People are weird.

gayyoungold,2vmoj0,dadnme,1 point,Thu Feb 12 16:51:55 2015 UTC,That is some seriously weird shit with people being in it for the chase? Self-esteem issues perhaps?
gayyoungold,2vmoj0,Robolabo,1 point,Thu Feb 12 18:27:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all sorts of issues, but there is a lot of self-esteem issues too. Older guys really do like the idea that younger guys who could have anyone are crazy about older. So there is a big esteem thing going on with some guys."
gayyoungold,2vmoj0,FriesBaconNaked501,1 point,Fri Feb 13 01:20:29 2015 UTC,"What seems like a lot of trouble to you may not be to him. Buying a train ticket or showing you aorund was probably very easy for him.  Remember that he's approaching this situation from a different standpoint than you are. You're in school, traveling and enjoying these kind of luxeries isn't easy yet. Maybe someday you'll be in his shoes, but will know to act with more compassion."
gayyoungold,2vmoj0,2scompany,2,Fri Feb 13 15:06:18 2015 UTC,"If he's misrepresented where he lives and stopped communicating with you, it may be a lost cause, and a young/old relationship could be a problem..............I should state that it isn't my issue, but it seems to happen a lot."
gayyoungold,2vmoj0,2scompany,1 point,Thu Feb 12 13:09:52 2015 UTC,"Young guys' expectations have changed enormously in the last 10 years - and for guys formed in an earlier period this can be a turnoff.   Dudes by age 20 now are looking for 'the one' - husband potential they can settle into the suburbs with for the next 50 years.   Nobody - absolutely not one gay person - was expecting this from the get go 25 years ago.  It would have seemed ridiculous - just as it does to me today.  Lighten up.  If this form of commitment is a requirement go for a person of your generation.  Or someone who is desperate ( and who you won't want).  Hot (older) guys are used to playing the field and will do that until they fall head over heels... That happens rarely...and even then rarely lasts.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but its the fruit of my experience."
gayyoungold,2vmoj0,RustyGuns,1 point,Thu Feb 12 17:40:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think that gives him the right to ignore me though. Honestly, if he would just say I'm no longer interested I'd say that's fine, be upset for awhile and move on. But what hurts is the unknown. Also, him saying he was interested in an LTR then that doesn't make sense."
gayyoungold,2vmoj0,RustyGuns,1 point,Thu Feb 12 18:27:03 2015 UTC,"From what you say he doesn't seem like a very nice or mature person - despite his years.  I agree he should have the decency to tell you where he stands.  But moving forward you will learn that a lot of people - and situations - disappoint, mostly for lack of courage, ethics and morality.  While we can both be sorry for this all we can do is try to keep our own standards.  And avoid those who don't stack up.  Good luck on the road ahead : there are good people, but they, unfortunately, seem to be in the minority."
gayyoungold,2vmfr5,randomplot,3,Thu Feb 12 05:16:51 2015 UTC,"I don't have/can't get kik, and I'm not sure a lot of us older guys have it.  Have you checked sites like SilverFoxies and SilverDaddies.........I assure you; we are out here."

gayyoungold,2vjbn2,Noremac1992,10,Wed Feb 11 14:11:22 2015 UTC,"Ah, the perfect topic for me to weigh in on.    I'm in my early 30s, my husband is in his upper 50s, we have been together going on 13 years now, and the cherry on top is we have 2 kids.  Man I wish I could tell you I could get my husband to want to make love at least once a week, but that is not true.  There are those magical few times every few years where he is suddenly horny for like 2-3 days and I pounce on those.  As time progresses the sex drive dose go down in most older guys, but there are other factors that effect his drive which can cause him to not be in the mood as well.  But sex is important and it can be difficult figuring out how to improve things.  Sex is not all a relationship is and yet it is an important part of it.  My husband took on a much more demanding position at work about 5-6 years ago and the stress level shot up.  Because of this he not only started to have no interest in sex weekly but he would even go a full month without getting in the mood.  With 2 kids it made it that much harder to find time.  Then he even took up more work outside of his job and that's when we needed to talk.  It lead to a lot of lonely nights where all I saw him was at night coming home.  The first thing we did to fix this was make time for each other.  That meant a date night once a month and more alone time with each other after the kids go to bed.  Or I'd wake up early with him while he gets the kids ready for school to just hangout before he leaves for the day.  Maybe sometimes you could make breakfast or something to let him sleep in.  I also started surprising him at night when he arrives home with flowers, candles lit in the house, and even being dressed up in a suit to greet him.  Little surprises like that make him smile and feel special.  But those things do not always guarantee sex, which you have to be ok with.  See if you start resenting your boyfriend for not having sex or initiating sex you will make things worse.  Just because you do something to show him you love him doesn't mean he owes you sex.  Owing sex is like one of the worst feeling and it makes the sex feel so dull to me.  Intimacy on the other hand is ok to expect, but you have to find ways to do that.  Try talking to him in a manner that isn't demanding of sex but is looking for special time with him.  My husband absolutely loves a good back rub or foot rub with some nice oil or lotion.  He loves it so much I can actually make him drool in ecstasy after years of practice.  He moans more from that then from sex at times.  And I get so turned on by making him feel that way which he usually notices.  There are times this leads to sex, but not always and you have to be okay with that.  Its the intimacy you sharing that is important.  Maybe you two are watching TV or a movie.  Get close to each other and cuddle up but do it in underwear or PJs.  Hell maybe try doing it naked, but I caution against this because it can make him feel pressured to do something.  Don't let him feel that way, tell him its something fun you like to do only him and even you don't have sex you guys are still creating an important bond as a couple.  It feels so good watching TV with my husband in our underwear in bed and every once and awhile I feel him get in the mood.  Even if nothing happens the closeness I feel to him in those moments is wonderful.  Have you tried changing up the time of day you have sex?  I've actually set an alarm and woke up early to get my husband's motor started before we wake the kids up.  Sure the session is much quicker and feels a bit rushed but it can be a pleasant surprise.  You could also try changing up your own routines.  For example I took up exercising regularly about 2 years ago and it feel great.  I'm healthy, look better to him, and that sexual urge/drive I have can be used to help fuel a workout.  My husband has been giving compliments almost daily now for like the past few months about how good I look and much he enjoys wrapping his arms around me.  The guy can actually still make me blush after all these years.  Another thing you can try is doing something new together.  We took up golf.  You can even do this in cold months, just find and indoor faculty.  We bond over discussing how each of us is doing or supporting the other when they have a bad session.  Experiencing these together as a couple can really be fun and lead to much more.  The final thing I'll touch upon is the fact that it could be a physical issue.  My husband suffers from BPH which can lead to similar issues caused by ED.  He was not happy to deal with matter with his doctor but I kind of pushed him to plus tried my best to reassure him.  It took awhile, but he is fine now.  Actually, discussing sex in general with his doctor was very uncomfortable to him.  It was challenging to try and get him to do this and I found telling him that he needed to discuss his health so I won't worry about him and that we can satisfy each other to help.  There are other health issues that could be bothering your boyfriend like bad knees, back problems, or soreness and all of those he should see a doc about to discuss what to do.  Sorry I kind of wrote a paper here for you but I have had years of experience with this and I'm very happy in my marriage these days so I try to share what works with others so they can work things out.  Good luck to you two."
gayyoungold,2vjbn2,Whitedragon2,7,Wed Feb 11 17:18:36 2015 UTC,You sound like a normal 22 year old.   He sounds like a normal 58 year old.

gayyoungold,2vjbn2,Kaique94,2,Wed Feb 11 20:27:17 2015 UTC,I disagree. A normal 58 y/o would not make him feel guilty.

gayyoungold,2vjbn2,footnotefour,2,Fri Feb 13 12:09:02 2015 UTC,"It's not unheard of to see a guy's sexual desire or performance deminish with age, weight gain, health, stress or other reasons, but 58 is definitely on the younger side. Can you think of any possiblities related to those that could be affecting him?  I would try to talk to him about it but maybe find a different way of talking about it.   and for what it's worth you shouldn't feel guilty at all."
gayyoungold,2vjbn2,Robolabo,2,Wed Feb 11 15:05:10 2015 UTC,"My experience is that most older guys only want to get off once every 2 weeks or so. In the beginning of a relationship a 60yo can and wants to cum every 2 days or so. It's hot but that slows down as the relationship ages. Now that I'm 35, I'm starting to understand the slow down. Meanwhile, a younger guy wants to cum once or even 3 times a day, and that maintains through their 20s.   The only solution is that the older partner is GGG. They don't have to initiate but they should be willing to participate, otherwise the relationship is going to be in trouble."
gayyoungold,2vjbn2,dadnme,2,Wed Feb 11 15:46:53 2015 UTC,"yes, the male sex drive decreases as you get older. however, it sounds like there may be more going on. have an honest talk with him about how you are feeling. don't make it anyone's fault, because it's not, but make it about what you are feeling and thinking, and find out what he is thinking and feeling. it's possible that you will have to make some hard decisions - for example, if he is unwilling or unable to meet your sexual desires, is he willing to open up your relationship? if he's not, are you ready to be frustrated sexually and stay in the relationship? when he says that ""a relationship isn't just about sex"", that is true, but it also sounds like this may be his way of trying to break up with you without being the ""bad guy."" if that's the case, it's better to be honest about it and try to end in a healthy way.  you are 22. this is not going to be your last relationship, but that doesn't mean that it has to end now or because of this. if he is wanting out, be ready for that but this could just be a bump in the road.  best of luck."
gayyoungold,2vjbn2,PirateCodingMonkey,2,Wed Feb 11 16:04:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely talk to him, but don't start by talking about sex. Ask him what's wrong. There's something bugging him, and he's not talking about it.  When he says that a relationship isn't just about sex, try to gently let him know that sex is an important part of an intimate relationship, and that your needs matter too."
gayyoungold,2vjbn2,Avunculous,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"In a nutshell, as we age our sexual drive does diminish.  It may return in brief flashes, but it is unpredictable.  I've been lucky to meet some very nice young men, but generally,  they want more sex than I'm up to providing.  I've really tried to keep up by switching from being a total top to bottoming, improving my oral skills (swallowing with gusto), more cuddling, kissing........whatever I can throw in the mix.  My passion for young men is still with me, but the sexual athletics aren't what they used to be and I think it's just a fact of life.  Like I've said before; there's a very good chance that the olders will have to accept dying alone..........I'll turn 68 this year."

I don't know what but it just feels like a red flag.  I know the government is flawed and fucks up a lot though so I might be wrong. You're only 19, you really need to find out how long he's there. It might be better to move on if it's long term incarceration."
gayyoungold,2vf8gr,myaltreddit,7,Tue Feb 10 23:53:42 2015 UTC,"I don't want you to take this the wrong way. I'm 25 and have been dating substantially older guys since 17. But you are way too young to be dealing with this. Not that there's really any age that this would be okay at. Your guy is older and should know better and not put himself into situations that he knew were illegal and likely inappropriate. A grown man has no business with a high school student, perhaps with the rarest of exceptions. You've only been dating this guy for a year, half of which was long distance. You won't regret finding someone stable without such insane drama. And you won't have difficulty doing so.  And it might be hard to imagine now, but one day you might be open with your family. I never thought it possible, but it's worked out really well for me. Dating someone with stat rape charges would make the situation pretty dire.   Again, you can find someone who will not bring an unnecessary level of crazy to your life. He is 56 and you are only 19. Please do not feel obligated to accept his craziness into your life."
gayyoungold,2vf8gr,StrappedJock,1 point,Wed Feb 11 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"Just lending my support!  This would be tough to weather under normal circumstances, and not being out just ramps up the pressure in my experience.  Don't forget to keep an eye out for your emotional and personal health!  Eventually you'll know how long it's going to take for him to get out, and you'll figure out if and/or how the relationship will work with him behind bars — it's just going to take time."
gayyoungold,2vf8gr,firewerx,0,Tue Feb 10 17:28:02 2015 UTC,"Can't solve this problem for you, but I might have a few suggestions to make things easier.  First, are you able to visit him and get phone calls from him?  If not, find out from the jail how to visit--getting visits will help you both out tremendously. The phone thing is going to be expensive (calls are all collect and the jail phone companies are greedy bastards), but it's a way to maintain contact when you can't visit, esp. if he's moving out of state. The jail should also have info for you on how to set up your phone to get calls from him.  Depending on how deeply you want to get involved with his criminal case, you can also try to talk to his lawyer.  You might be able to help his lawyer get evidence of his taking those classes, etc.  Good luck!"

Pointed comments will probably persist...I've gotten to the point where I respond in kind and it turns into amusing banter.  I think you'll get there, too.    Boyfriend ( my ""man-panion"" is what my father calls him) and I have been looking after my father after a torn achilles.  He's been doing PT for a couple weeks now and isn't happy about it.

gayyoungold,2vdpld,wumpkers,1 point,Tue Feb 24 07:00:34 2015 UTC,"Well, they are acting as if nothing is wrong, and I'm not sure if it is because I'm in recovery mode for my leg. My dad has made a couple of comments about not doing anything else wrong this year for (Chinese) New Year, and something about me finding a woman. This sort of set me off and I'm becoming angrier and angrier because it feels like he either thinks I'm going and trying to be straight or that I've broken up with my boyfriend; neither of which are true. It's like I can't live my own life and make my own decisions.  I'm not sure what to do. Nothing is sort of keeping the issue at the surface so I can't tell if they are still digesting it or if they just believe I'm going their way. I still talk to and see my boyfriend every day via Skype and I don't want my parents to think that we've separated. There is going to come a time when I want to visit him and this will boil up again. Should I just deal with it then?"
gayyoungold,2vdpld,wumpkers,2,Tue Feb 24 14:50:00 2015 UTC,"My SO is a few years older than my father and they grew up about 30 miles away from each other.  I'm sure at one point my father expected I would grow up to be successful, marry a woman, have kids, a house in the suburbs, and so on.  Instead, one of the 'older kids' from the next town over ended up dating his son (me).  I have no doubt he struggled with that realization.  Introducing my father and SO was helpful in overcoming that obstacle, though.  My father gave up on the erroneous perceptions he concocted in his mind once he actually met my SO.  Now they act like best friends.  They talk endlessly (truly feels that way sometimes) about their hometowns, mutual friends, landmarks, etc.  They're friends on FB, too.  I even told my father to stop trying to steal my SO once (jokingly, of course).    For now, I think you should just let your parents continue processing their thoughts and feelings.  They are rewiring their brains probably in a somewhat similar manner as people grieving in stages after losing a loved one:  (1) denial that you are gay and attracted to an older man; (2) angry that you are and that you told them; (3) bargaining with you and themselves to get you to ""be straight again""; (4) depression due to the realization that you are who you are and it's not going to change; and, finally, (5) acceptance of who you are.  The time spent going through this 'rewiring' is different for everyone.  If you recognize which stage and emotion they are facing when making a comment to you, act accordingly.  Don't respond to irrational anger.  Establish your confidence in your life if they try to bargain.  Show them how happy life can still be when they are depressed.  You'll get there.  And then you'll be complaining like me about your father and SO hollering like magpies outside after you're nephew has gone to bed on Thanksgiving."

I'm honestly not sure what stage they are in, they were very angry at first, and it's quite possible they are in denial now.   I'm struggling with whether or not I should make it known that I'm still with my boyfriend instead of hoping that they aren't thinking I'm changing for their sake--because that's what it seems like."

My guy is always checking on me and making sure I'm getting what I need. He's pushing me to do my therapy and being very supportive when he sees me in pain. My life is good for the most part.  Hoping to be off crutches next week, or so my PT says. Full recovery is gonna be 6 to 9 months though. What did you have operated on?"

After the surgery the knee quit locking up and didn't have the extremely sharp jolts of pain.  The running days are over, for the most part, and I doing the mountain bike now.  Like I said; you are very lucky.  I was basically alone during the recovery, which, living out here in the mountains, can get restrictive.  Anyway, that surgery went well doing ok."

gayyoungold,2v5zq4,100and8,5,Sun Feb 8 07:12:01 2015 UTC,"No; you're not weird.  Most of us are bi to one degree or another, with preferences.  The idea that 3% (or whatever) of the population is gay and 97% is straight is utter BS.  It's been my observation that the sexuality spectrum isn't black and white; it's a little black on one end, a little white on the other end and a great big grey area in the middle.  Your attraction to older men may not be the most common preference, but I assure you there are oceans of us older guys with a passion for younger guys.  Welcome to the human species."

So thank you young guy for sharing your body! ;) We compromised. He still gets to do his thing with a stern warning that any meeting of locals will result in immediate eviction from my home ( he is penniless so a BIG deal!), and I still get to fap to my boys. He has assured me he has no intention of meeting, it is his turn on just like yours.  My point is, I did my thing with his knowledge and usually beside him in our shared office. He hid his intentionally. I call that cheating. Now that is out, I don't consider it that anymore. It is simply our turn ons. Hell, email is how I met him in the first place!

gayyoungold,2v5zq4,2scompany,0,Sun Feb 8 18:46:52 2015 UTC,"How would you feel if you checked your girlfriend's chat logs and found conversations like the ones you've been having?  I don't know if I would technically qualify it as cheating, but it is the kind of secret that breaks relationships. And of course, if you meet someone it's definitely cheating.  Being bisexual means you're always going to have aspects of your sexuality that are unfulfilled in a monogamous relationship. You're going to figure out pretty fast if you're going to be able to swear off those temptations, or if you'll find a way to integrate them into your life.   Whatever you do, keep in mind that lying to a significant other on a long-term basis is just a recipe for unhappiness and breakup. Find a way to be honest with the people you love."
gayyoungold,2v5zq4,Avunculous,3,Sun Feb 8 15:58:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think being bisexual means he will automatically struggle with monogamy or automatically unfulfilled desires. I'm gay and I loves muscle guys and twinks, but that doesn't mean dating a twink is going to make me ""automatically have unfulfilled desires"" or struggle with monogamy. I see what you said as very similar to that: a bisexual person dating a woman won't automatically have trouble with fulfilling desires because the aspects of a man are missing. Even if you defend the route of the whole not sexually having everything you want satisfied, that literally has nothing to do with being bisexual. Everyone has to deal with that, bisexual or otherwise. I don't mean to be confrontational or rude I promise! I just don't think what you said is helping the OP who is having a tough time and looking for positive helpful advice. Making him feel like bisexuality means you will always be unsatisfied with monogamy isn't very encouraging. Like I said, that has nothing to do with being bisexual."

Give yourself some credit.  Many don't even take the first steps.  This alone means you're a fighter and it'll take you far.  First, any social animal (we humans) will be most comfortable with like-kind.  Even though we're all human, age, gender and race play a role.  The more sub-groups you can create, the more like-kind will attract to each other and away from differences.  For the most part, this is natural behavior, but there are enough exceptions.  First step: Fully accept that, so you can focus on the right men - those men who are interested (or even curious).  This is a tough topic.  Usually, there are two opinions: those - any race including white - who understand it and those who believe almost anything racial doesn't exist.  Racial preference exist in ways most will never fully understand.  No matter the race, people tend to only believe something different once they experience it ... and even then, some will deny that experience.  Crazy, I know.  Just don't waste time on guys who aren't interested; find the ones who are.  Second step: Never, ever, ever base your self esteem on the opinions of others!  You're not attracted to every guy, so you can't expect every guy to be attracted to you.  Since we're talking interracial, the pool is smaller, so don't let that larger uninterested pool control your emotions. Basically, don't beat yourself up if another guy isn't attracted to you.  Don't feel guilty if the family and friends of a guy you're dating doesn't like it.  These are the biggest traps you can fall into.  It's a false negative for you and causes even more problems further feeding the negativity and low esteem.  There will always be someone, but you'll have to do more work simply because of your race.  Patience.  Time.  Another guy will show up, but only if you don't sit around and wait.  Keep working at it like you're doing and do your absolute best in learning how to accept these things!  Life will be infinitely better and you'll create more opportunities to find compatible hot older men!  They are out there."

A few of the boys lived with me for years, and I still have contact with just a couple, but most have gone on with their lives.

My partner and I have a dog that we, stereotypically, spoil with attention & treats. I think I'm comfortable not having kids but I'm in my early twenties & I'm still figuring a lot of things out. So naturally, there is wisdom & experience that he has and that he can share. Most of the time, my stubborn ass just wants to succeed or fail on my own.   I know that intergen heterosexual relationships are not uncommon at all. You don't need to look very far to find evidence of it. I'm more likely to lean towards the idea that gay relationships are effected by an overall difference in dynamics. All polls would have me believe that homosexuals are a much smaller percentage of population compared to heterosexuals. Considering the very nature of homosexuality is breaking a societal, cultural (and possibly biological) norm - what's the worry about disparate ages? At least, I think that's part of the psychology of intergenerational dating in the gay community.   I guess everyone finds a way to preserve their experiences & wisdom and pass them on to another person whether it be their child or someone else's."
gayyoungold,2upsl2,GerontoMan,3,Wed Feb 4 16:54:24 2015 UTC,"In my case I don't think that statement is true since I always planned on having kids somehow when I found mister right.  Very early in our relationship, my husband & I both discussed the idea of having kids one day (yes we wanted more then one).  We both saw it as something we would like to do though we were never sure if adoption or having a surget was the best thing for us.  Several adoptions have occurred in my family and sometimes it was due to the fact that the couple could not have children.  I say this because to me, even if biologically you couldn't have children, adoption was always seen as another means of having children so that was a never a thought for me when I started dating older guys.  Years later my husband approached me about adopting and while nervous as hell about it things have worked out well.  My husband and I both pass on our wisdom to our two adopted children, but I don't think his mentoring of me ever stopped nor has my ability to surprise him with my perspective on things.  Hell even the kids have taught us a thing or two over the years.  Its funny how my kids will talk to my husband about sex but they'll talk to me about love.  Both my spouse and I can offer a wealth of information to our kids because of our different backgrounds and ages.  I'm still shocked when my husband confines in me that I've taught him something new because 80% of time i have no clue that I am doing it. We all know that one day we will pass on from this world so we pass on wisdom and information through the sharing of information and perspectives.  I'm not sure about how much more common older/younger relationships are in straight couples but one of my siblings is married to someone 10+ years older then him.  In my family marrying an older person isn't really a taboo or something like that.  I believe I have cousins as well who have married older or younger people, but I've never asked for details as they never asked for details about mine.  Not disagreeing with your point but simply figured I'd offer a flip side to what I was reading in the comments."

gayyoungold,2upsl2,daddybearsftw,1 point,Wed Feb 4 17:54:40 2015 UTC,"Sure I can answer those.  We meet when I was 20 and he was 45 which is about....wow, 13 years ago now.  We adopted our first child 8 years ago and the other 4 years ago.  We adopted both when they were 9-10 years old (met them at 9 but were not placed until they were 10)."
gayyoungold,2upsl2,Whitedragon2,3,Wed Feb 4 18:02:03 2015 UTC,"Not really. Both me and my partner don't want kids, even though we can adopt - we just choose not to. We love our corgis better.  I think the whole ""mentor"" role exists in all relationships in varying degrees. Not so much as one specifically teaching the other one, but both equally wanting to share their experiences, stories and opinions with the person they love, so they have more communication and also help them. It just so happens that in most cases the younger one in the relationship isn't quite so experienced in life, and they have more questions and troubles, whereas the older partner doesn't, and since he's more experienced, he's of more help. Of course, things work the other way around, too - I for one constantly do things/help my SO with his iPhone and electronics.  The same goes for every relationship. Yes - even those where there's no love interest. Of course, some of those relationships have a more predominant mentor role, but I don't think that would be the case with romantic relationships - at least not with all of them, or to do with our kind, specifically.  For instance, you can teach a kid a thing or two about how to live life, but that kid can also teach you a few things about imagination, kindness and simplicity.  It's inherent of the human being to want to share their wisdom, experiences and information, with anyone we love, needs our help or just for blatant entertainment. Sexual attraction is irrelevant for that matter. Even though the mentor role happens often with our relationships, I feel it's just due to the younger partner most likely not having much to share, although some couples do enjoy that dynamic.  I do agree it happens more often with gay folk. We are - mostly - more open minded and sexually due to the nature of our upbringing.  That's my two cents, anyway."

I live in a backwater town in northern England, and the straight people I know were absolutely aghast when the news story broke recently about Stephen Fry marrying his much younger partner - they were mortified, and just couldn't get their head around why a young man might fancy a much older guy (while I, as a confirmed daddy's boy, was just going awwww, how sweet!)  I agree about the passing on wisdom thing, too - that's definitely part of the appeal for me as a younger partner, and as I get older (nearly 34 now, eek!), it's part of the allure of having a boy of my own."

I go into a relationship with the idea of being a friend, lover and basically shouldering my own deal.  I have a 20yo and we hang out when we can.  Its cool, its chill and we can hang out naked or go out and chill -- its all just fun.  I think with ppl my own age (im 41) they have a ton of emotional baggage or some sort of hangup that makes them very incompatible with me.  My work is fairly structured, at home I just want a young guy that goes with the flow :)"

I tried to teach him about saving, budgeting, investing, didn't work that well but maybe it will rub off eventually.  Guys my age, for the most part, are set in their ways and not very adventurous.  To me life is about learning new things everyday, experiencing things you haven't yet.    We stopped being bf's after 9 months but turned into good friends which is a nice outcome."

gayyoungold,2ubisj,gyobreakupthrowaway,2,Sat Jan 31 17:23:51 2015 UTC,"The dissolution of a relationship is always painful. That's absolutely natural. Don't feel like you should feel a certain way. I personally have a tendency to associating normality with happiness. As a result, in the past, I ran away from momentary unhappiness and found myself in situations that were not good for me. Anything to feel better in that moment.   It's a bad cycle and I'm sure you know that. Let yourself feel shitty for awhile, that's the healthy, normal & logical thing to do right now. Mend and rebuild. Grow as a person. I think you'll find that you're far stronger than you think, right now.   You can do this. Find that sense of purpose and happiness within yourself & you will rarely be lost. I know it sounds like something of a fortune cookie... But it's true. If you neglect your desires for momentary comfort - you don't actually get any further addressing the problem. Stand strong and you come out the side a stronger, wiser, more experienced person.   A day at a time, friend. Hit me up if you ever just want to chat. I've been through a few rough patches myself."
gayyoungold,2ubisj,GerontoMan,1 point,Sat Jan 31 22:35:03 2015 UTC,"I just don't know how to feel. I'm almost relieved that it's over. Mad that I let myself get this far with him, knowing goddamn well that it wouldn't work out. Mad at him for the same reason (he's been through this with other guys, none of which worked out). And at the same time I'm fucking miserable because I can't stop going over all the good memories in my head. I wanted this to work out so fucking badly. I love him...I really do. I would've married him if I could've. I've never been in a relationship that's gotten this serious...so I've never been through a breakup this bad. I didn't know it could feel THIS bad.  Sorry, just venting a little i guess. I know you're right...you hit the nail on the head with what you said about momentary comfort. You have no idea how much it helped just to read your post. Thank you!"
gayyoungold,2ubisj,GerontoMan,2,Sun Feb 1 04:22:30 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad to hear that it was helpful. Breakups are a bitch and it'll feel very strange for awhile. It's a serious loss and grief comes with it. Sometimes it's easy to associate our own sense of worth in relation to other people, as opposed to independently. Part of the grieving process is learning about & living with yourself again.   The first man I fell in love with was married too. He was always upfront about his marital status but I fell in love with him anyways. I didn't really see it then but that relationship was keeping me from developing into my own person. I wanted so badly to make it work that I didn't even realize the damage it was doing to my self-esteem.   Everyone deserves a lover/partner that can truly be there for you. Some people are capable of finding happiness & fulfillment in an open relationship. I know I'm not one of them and I would have to guess that those individuals are the minority.   I'm sure it's exacerbated by the unique nature of our relationships and our youth/inexperience. There's no Sex Ed class for us about what a healthy relationship looks like so it feels something like uncharted territory.   Anyways, just keep your head up and do your own thing for awhile. Cultivate/hone some hobby to put your emotional energy into.   In the event that you are a student, most universities have either free or low-priced counseling services on campus. It should be free but maybe it's not everywhere. I actually didn't do this myself but hindsight tells me it would have helped me. It can be very helpful to have an uninvolved opinion to keep you on Earth when it feels upside down."
gayyoungold,2ubisj,Avunculous,2,Sun Feb 1 04:56:07 2015 UTC,"Please remember that as bad as the pain is, it will pass. Soon there will be a day when it doesn't hurt this badly. Then there will be a good day. Then there will be great days. You just have to get through this rough spot.  And if you go back to him, you'll just have to face it all over again.  Try writing yourself a letter going into detail as to why you've broken up with your partner. If you get tempted to go back to him, get that letter out and read it. See if you can talk your future self out of taking him back.  There's something better out there for you, but you have to get out of this first."
gayyoungold,2u5f7i,Boylovesdaddy,4,Fri Jan 30 01:49:51 2015 UTC,"Here's how I found my current therapist.  In Portland, OR, there's a LGBTQ center called the Q Center.  I went there and they had a list of all of the therapists that have been recommended to them by people in the community.   Then I went to the Psychology Today website and cross-referenced that recommendation list against their website and narrowed it down to the top three.    None of them felt like a match.    I kept reading through the profiles of the therapists that I found on the Psychology Today site and found a therapist who identified as:    1) LGBTQ oriented and 2) Kink knowledgeable    When I read through his profile, I realized that he was the best fit and I called him and met a week later.    You're at university. Almost every university has a counseling center. Most are free. Call to make an intake appointment and when you do, let them know that you have a desire to discuss LGBTQ and intergenerational relationships. They should pair you with someone who is good for you.    If you don't like the person they pair you with, tell them and keep looking until you find someone who can be radically honest with, and comfortable with.    Good luck and PM me for additional help."

All of us are wired differently, thank the goddess for that, it would be a boring world otherwise.  But none of us asked to be wired the way we are.  A good therapist will help you better understand who you are, why you are wired the way you are and give you coping skills to add to your tool belt.  That said, finding a therapist who isn't going to try and change you (they can't) and won't be judgmental isn't all that easy.  Do shop around, do leave if you feel uncomfortable and judged.    In my late 20's I went to a feminist, therapy collective (yeah hippy towns are great) and spent 1 1/2 years in therapy with a wonderful woman named Pat.  I was sexually abused by my mother and physically and mentally abused by my father.  I was an angry young man.    Now in my 60's I still get angry but know how to cope.  I gave up murdering people years ago (jk).  Pat helped me get through the anger, focus it where it belonged and gave me tools to use to control it.    Liking older men isn't sick but it is a preference that you might want to explore and find out why you have it and understand it.  You don't need ""fixing"" anymore than queers need fixing because they are queer.  But spending time learning to understand yourself, is always time well spent."

It will only help you through the process in my opinion."

Please do your partner a favor and find a way to move out as soon as possible when you break up with him. Being broken up with is awful, and if you stay he won't be able to move on. He'll be stuck in that horrible just-post-breakup state of mind for as long as you're there. Every hope he has that you guys will get back together will be ripping the scab off the wound. Every conversation between you will be weighted down with the dead relationship.  He was good enough to be there for you when you needed a place to stay. Now that you don't love him anymore, be good enough to give him the space he needs to heal.  Moving is a pain in the ass, but it will be a lot easier than reliving the end of a relationship for the next three months. At this point in the semester, someone's bound to be looking for a roommate. Hit Craigslist and see what you can find.   It's pretty cruel to break up with someone and stay on, knowing that your presence there is hurting them. You both need to get on with your lives.

We lived together for 9 months after the breakup.  We owned the house together and needed to get it ready for sale.  Funny thing is once we decided to break up the tension left the room.  Was it easy, no but it wasn't awful either.  The lack of privacy was the biggest burden and saying ""I won't be back home tonight"" was awkward.  Finally since neither of us were doing the work to get the house ready for sale, I bought another place and moved out.    4 years later we still occasionally talk on the phone, he moved back to Meechigan and I stayed in Texasss.  It is always easier when the guy you break up with moves.  In fact I think I will add it to my next prenup."

I can guarantee you that there's a world full of guys like that.  I'm incredibly happy with my partner. We both thought we were out of each others leagues.

gayyoungold,2tq3vv,wumpkers,2,Mon Jan 26 16:15:38 2015 UTC,"I was a long-time lurker on reddit until one of your posts prompted me to submit a picture of my SO and me.  I've always admired your thoughtfulness, sincerity, and kindness.  Believe me when I say that seeing you faced with this situation is upsetting.  At the risk of sounding presumptuous or rude, I assume from what you've posted here and in the past that the different experience in terms of culture and expectation relate to your family's ethnicity.  Although I can't relate to your particular situation exactly, I've had many gay friends in similar situations.  And living in Oklahoma, I can at least personally relate to the hurtful and illogical reasoning of some family members and friends.    Your parents, I think, take a lot of pride in their cultural values.  My parents are similar in their own way.  They ""found out"" before I came out.  I was a teenager.  They confronted me and tried to understand ""what they did wrong” and/or “who was to blame.” I was distant in matters pertaining to my love-life after that.  I told myself that if they weren't comfortable with that part of my life then they wouldn't hear about it.  Other family members took it worse, typically echoing the opinion of their preacher on the subject.    After graduating law school, my job became time-consuming and I was even more distant. Then I met my SO and had no time for my parents at all.  I think it was around then that they truly realized I was more concerned with my satisfaction than theirs’ when it came to my life choices.  Suddenly, the off-limits topic of my love-life became all they were interested in.  They constantly wanted to know more about my SO, what we did for fun, and when they would get to meet him.  Other than a few awkward (but slightly funny) conversations since then, it has consistently been an uphill slope.  We even stayed with them last weekend to help take care of my father after a foot surgery.    I understand I can’t speak for my parents or your’s.  I also understand that each of my parents had individualized, separate concerns about my love-life and came to terms with those issues at different times and for different reasons.  The only thing I was able to do during this whole process was love who I am and love the life I’ve chosen to lead.  Others, particularly family members, will always have an opinion about your choices, but your choices will always be your responsibility and not theirs’.  They don’t have to overcome your obstacles and live with the outcomes.  Given time, I think they’ll realize that.  They’ll also realize that their success as parents is and should be measured by how fulfilled your life is…not their and/or others’ opinions of your life.    It would have been easier for me to just say stay strong and give it time, but I wanted you to know you’re not alone and my guess is that you will get through this and have a better life because of it."

They were really putting on the pressure last night and giving out threats, etc.  If I may ask, how old are you and your partner?"
gayyoungold,2tq3vv,thehogdog,2,Mon Jan 26 16:36:46 2015 UTC,"I'm 28 and he is 64.    My hope/guess is that their initial reaction will have been the most severe.  I had a close friend in law school who received a similar reaction from his parents when he came out.  His parents had moved to Oklahoma from Vietnam shortly before he was born.  He explained to me what he called a patriarchal culture whereby he was subject to a number of expectations:  excel in academics, get a respectable job, live with and help support parents until marriage, have family of his own, and move parents in with him when parents are in their later years.    He came out to them during undergraduate school and their reaction crushed him.  He continued living up to their expectations but helped them to understand, over time, that the only expectation he was never going to fulfill was the marriage part...at least not to a woman.  His understanding was that they had never conceived of the idea that they could still be just as proud even if he deviated from the norm.    Don't know if that is similar to your situation but from what you've described, it made me think of his story.  Although a big part of my job is adversarial, there are just as many moments of mediation.  In your case, I can understand that your parents are upset because the fear their expectations have to be substantially altered if not discarded.  I can also understand that you are who you are and everyone deserves to live a life of fulfillment according to their truth.  There is compromise to be found but, like with any disagreement, it takes time and effort.  They love you, it just takes a while to incorporate this new information.  And you love them, it will just take time for you to show them that you are still the son they love and will continue making them proud...but in your own way."
gayyoungold,2tq3vv,IDontGiveAFuckOrShit,1 point,Mon Jan 26 20:14:27 2015 UTC,"Everything you've described here is spot on. It's comforting to hear this, and all the other things that have been said here.  A big struggle is the age difference. It seems to be the one thing they might not ever understand--thus their reaction in wanting me to end things swiftly and coldly. You mentioned you had a realization that you had to put your own satisfaction above that of your parents. Would you say your parents realized this as well? What was the turning point for them in beginning to accept your partner and his age?"
gayyoungold,2tq3vv,Whitedragon2,1 point,Mon Jan 26 21:25:55 2015 UTC,"They realized it, albeit slowly.  My father was never short on opinions about what I should do with my life.  My mother usually just agreed with him.  When I chose my own path and it became evident that I was happy and successful at it, they seemed to understand that I was capable of finding satisfaction on my own.  Afterward, they were more deferential to my choices about my life.  They still offer advice but know I won't always take it.    Regarding the age gap...shortly after my parents found out (during my teenage years), my father expressed a concern about me being ""taken advantage of"" by older men well-versed in exploiting naivety.  He was right about this.  Dated a man 30+ years my senior for roughly five years before my current SO.  The former relationship ended after I loaned him a substantial amount of money (for outstanding tax liabilities) and caught him naked in the pool with a ""job candidate"" for his engineering firm.  A costly life lesson but one I needed.  I know the age difference concerned, if not disgusted, my mother at first.  I think meeting my current SO put her at ease.  She always thought I acted rather ""grandfatherly.""  Seeing us together and hearing us playfully bicker about a game of Bridge probably helped her realize that I wasn't likely to find that kind satisfaction with a man close to my age.    I think you've opened the door for your parents to entertain many new possibilities.  I had what I'll call the advantage of being ""found out"" at a younger age and, thereby, probably avoided a lot of grief.  Either way, it takes time and understanding for anyone to process this information.  Satisfaction is a life of fulfillment where you get to have it all - family, friends, and an SO of your choosing.  There may be others that achieve this through luck, but my experience is that you have to work at it and be patient.  From what I've seen you share on here, I think you are working at it and I think you'll get there.  Just know there will always be the occasional hurdle but you're more than capable of overcoming them."
gayyoungold,2tq3vv,FriesBaconNaked501,2,Mon Jan 26 23:55:03 2015 UTC,"I've never made my parents happy in their life.   This part stuck out with me.  It isn't your job to make them happy. If you being gay makes them unhappy, then so be it."
gayyoungold,2tq3vv,2scompany,2,Tue Jan 27 02:43:49 2015 UTC,"Sometimes in life it is time to cut and run.   If you are in a position to leave (what is preventing you from leaving and starting out on your own?) do so.  If they want to have a relationship with you make it on your terms, not theirs.    They probably had to give up things to appease their parents, stop that cycle.  You only get one life, living it to make someone else happy is a waste.  If they really love you they will cave, if they don't then consider yourself lucky to have found this out at such a young age.  don't give them a chance to talk to your partner until, they come around.  But seriously, my siblings and I cut ties to our mom before my sister had her first kid 22 years ago (our dad was collateral damage, he made his choice and knew the showdown was coming, always encouraging  us kids to stay together as a group).  Best thing we ever did.  None of it was gay related, but sounds similar to your parents wanting you to live life the way THEY want.  If they are good people they will come around, otherwise, you have a supportive partner and this group behind you."
gayyoungold,2tq3vv,daddylover112,2,Wed Jan 28 01:39:18 2015 UTC,"I can't really say anything other than that I'm sorry that they were so hurtful to you. They're bad parents for reacting in that way; my parents reacted similarly. I'm in the process of drifting away from my parents because I've realized that they cause more stress and guilt than happiness in my life and I don't really need people like that in my life. I'm not sure if you feel the same, but it's always an option once you think about what affect they have on your happiness."

My mental fortitude is all over the place and every day brings a new struggle. I'll be going into minor surgery on Monday and will be dependent on the very same parents who are not supporting me through this process. I'll have very limited contact with my SO for a while.  So it's been two days since I've told my parents and I'm afraid things are getting worse. They are becoming more and more ashamed of me and it's turning into paranoia. They fear one of our neighbors has been avoiding them because they might have seen me with my guy. My mom keeps telling me that I'm extremely stupid for being both bi or gay and moreso for being with someone much older.  They keep saying that they can't accept this and hinting at being able to force me to break up with him. How? I'm scared to think. But to show the kind of extreme thought I'm dealing with, an ending statement I got was that they would rather me be single than with a man.  I have little pockets of support from places other than here. The time I'm spending with my SO has been a very emotional one. I can tell he is preparing for the worst and it is heartbreaking to see. We cry and try to remember how much love we have for one another. I'm scared for him moreso than for myself."

As a parent myself I could never imagine saying such wretched emotionally scarring things to my kids.  Parents are supposed to support their kids, no matter what.  They are supposed to love them and embrace them in times of peril and great danger.  I read your original post and others, but most of posts I type out are very angry and you don't need that now.  Man you need love and support more than anything right now and all you get hit with are barbed comments.  It just frustrates me to no end to see parents treat their child like this.  Be strong and just know what they are doing isn't the way a good parent should act.  Parents are capable of mistakes though, and I just hope with some time and patience they come around.  I really hope you and SO are not pulled apart from this and that somehow things can be resolved.  Do whats best for you, do what makes you happy."

I would be very skeptical to anyone you meet over here. Now, aside from that there are many hot guys here and you will constantly drool at the guys in Manhattan, such as Penn station, grand central station, etc. Here's the big problem. Most of these older hotties that you'll find are either married, liars, or afraid to commit. You will find the few who are very honest and whatnot but because of your age, which I assume is very young if you just graduated, is going to play against you every time. The older guys in NYC have a lot of experience with younger guys and there will be many assumptions made about you. Aside from all that negativity. You will definitely find great guys to have sex with, but unless you have something to offer you may not find much. Another thing I've noticed is that sex is just about everything in this city because it's so easy to find it. Also, most older guys here are tops, so unless you're a total bottom sex, a big factor in relationships , will lessen your chances of finding anyone worth your time."

I think the last thing you need to do is just drop him because of his age, because you'll probably always wish you had gone forward in getting to know him.  I'm saying this as the ""older"" guy; you need to do what makes you happy and comfortable and you are not required or obliged to explain anything to your friends and family."
gayyoungold,2tj2ew,Boylovesdaddy,3,Sat Jan 24 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"You need to slow down a bit.  Your situation is fairly common since right now your sexual focus and attention is the daddy-types.  Sooner or later you'll find the daddy that will love you and not be just looking to fuck you.  Speaking as one who loves young males as more than a sex object, I think you are probably somewhere in that vast, gay,gray area and it's part of you.  Avoid the guilt trip; there are oceans of guys that feel the same."
gayyoungold,2tj2ew,FriesBaconNaked501,4,Sat Jan 24 22:25:13 2015 UTC,"Chill out.   Maybe your gay, maybe you're not? Try not to feel obligated at defining yourself or fitting yourself into a neat category. I know it's easy to feel a rush to ""find yourself"" or whatever community you are a part of, categorically. The thing is, there's no way anyone can predict the kind of life or the kind of friends & family you'll have in the future.   If you're sexually active with men, you should at least be in consideration of the fact that you might be a homosexual. I understand that there's a difference between sexual & emotional need/want but sex is an important part of a relationship. I can only go off my own experiences and observations.   I've really only been attracted to older men. I never became attracted to women or peer-aged males, despite feeling at the time that it would have been easier for me. Ultimately, forcing myself into a heterosexual relationship wasn't for me and honestly, I don't think forcing is in anyone's best interest.   You've got ages to learn to get to know & love yourself plainly. Try not to feel rushed. You've got an entire lifetime!"
gayyoungold,2tj2ew,GerontoMan,1 point,Sat Jan 24 21:34:11 2015 UTC,"What specifically about sex with a guy twice your age makes you feel scarred? Men tend to have more specific and broader fetishes than women which is completely natural. Some guys fetish big boobs/cocks, blonde hair, occupations, other guys fetish older, younger, hairy, smooth, and so on. It's actually more alarming when a guy has no fetish at all. Experience your sexuality freely and safely and you'll figure it out as you go along. Don't set up distant relationship goals such as marriage so early on it's gonna happen eventually you only have to live through it. I wish I could put my brain in your head for a couple of seconds for you to understand most rules of society such as don't skrew your hot gay DILF Neighbor change when you don't follow them. Social protocol is meant to be broken and when you do break it a whole vast subculture you always thought was small turns out to be bigger and deeper than you ever imagined and welcomes you in.

The way I've seen them grieve and cope for the loss of someone so close is that they do whatever they think and feel they need to do.  Feel like you want to leave some trinket at his grave or memorial? Do it.  If you believe he remains near you in spirit and can hear you talking, then talk out loud to him.  Feel like doing your own documentary about your life together? Go for it.  Think you'd be helped by a binge weekend in Las Vegas? No one should stop you.  I don't know any techniques or mechanics when it comes to grief. The only thing I know is that we all grieve and cope in different ways, and we should be allowed to grieve and cope the the ways we want.  And I hope you endure. I'll light a candle for you, and you have support and empathy from me, some stranger on the Internet, for what that is worth."

gayyoungold,2tchfb,FriesBaconNaked501,2,Fri Jan 23 00:11:32 2015 UTC,Fuck. I'm sorry. You're doing the right thing by reaching out to people who would understand the pain you're in. Seek counseling. Be with friends. And make your grief known to those that love you. Don't hesitate to ask for support from them.
gayyoungold,2tchfb,thistime_neveragain,2,Fri Jan 23 01:37:32 2015 UTC,"I'm very, very sorry for your loss. Unfortunately, the hurt just takes time to lessen.

gayyoungold,2tchfb,anxiousbp2,2,Fri Jan 23 01:38:03 2015 UTC,"the best way to cope...i don't know.   Death is a very abstract thing to deal with.   I've dealt with many deaths in my lifetime and it's never something I could ""cope"" or get over. Sometimes, the best way to deal this with is by talking to others who have went through the same ordeal. Hell, not even talking...just BEING with them.   I lost my dad a few years ago. My cousin passed away two years ago from a drug overdose and last year, I lost a very close friend of mine. We spoke together online for almost a decade but I never had the balls to meet him before he passed away. After seeing my dad pass away I thought if I came across any more deaths that it would be easier, but it doesn't. It doesn't necessarily get harder either. It just is.  Personally, I haven't really found a way to dealing with their deaths. I could just be walking to work and all of a sudden, the thoughts overwhelm me...but being with the people who have been affected by their deaths kind of help. I don't exactly know how to explain it."

Distract yourself with the arrangements (making the funeral program helped me not think to much). Make sure he has the best send off possible.

Since I asked he has been acting exactly how my ideal partner would but I just can't get the other guy and our past out of my head.   Part of me feels like I shouodnt have had to ask for certain changes and the fact that I did means it's over, another part of me is saying he's trying to accommodate my desires and I need to give him the chance"
gayyoungold,2sv280,Orvil_Pym,2,Sun Jan 18 22:09:49 2015 UTC,"If you hide your feelings about something, how could he know what needs work. Things usually do not get better with the next guy. Relationships always take work and openness from both sides.  Are you certain, your quiet but unspecific dissatisfaction isn't part of why he, too, had been checking out other guys? If he felt you were withdrawing, he too might have felt abandoned... And you say, you shouldn't have had to ask - but are you certain, he couldn't say the same thing...?  If you're truly in love with someone new then that's that. But make certain you aren't just projecting your dreams on someone you barely know, and who makes a great blank screen for your desires because of that. It's always easier to dream than to live.  I think it sounds more like you and your bf need an honest talk about needs and limits - and for that you both have to be honest with yourselves first.  (Even if you switch partners, you'll still need that honest exchange, and that self awareness, just with someone else.)"

gayyoungold,2sv280,PirateCodingMonkey,2,Mon Jan 19 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a pretty shy guy who really doesn't like confrontation so I never really brought up issues to him until a month ago when things blew up.   whether you ""move on"" or stay with him, this needs to change. when you are in a relationship, you need to talk about things that are bothering you - when they are happening.  speaking as someone who hates confrontation, i know this is hard to do, but it's worth it. when something happens - whether it's with the guy you are seeing now or someone you see in the future - take a minute to feel what you are feeling, then when your feelings are under control, say something like, ""when you do this thing/say what you said/whatever, i feel..."" and then ask him to not do it again. for example: ""when you make a rude comment to me, i feel hurt and angry. please don't say those things to me."" if he cares about you, he will stop. if he doesn't stop, he doesn't care about your feelings.   After our fight last month he has been trying to I guess win me back, and a part of me wants to give him a last chance, but another part just wants to give up. Unintentionally I've been a prick after realizing I have other options in the relationship department   i doubt that you have been ""unintentionally"" being a prick. you are angry with him and you want to make him feel it. it's understandable, but it's also unhealthy.  the best advice i can give you at this point is: sit down and write out a list of the things that you would like to see changed. be honest but not vindictive, and make sure they are realistic things. then make a list of the things that you can do or change to make the relationship better. when you have done that, sit down with your guy and calmly talk about both things. if you can both come to an agreement on fixing the relationship, and you both agree to working on it, then give him another chance. if you can't agree to it, move on.  remember, every relationship ends. as long as you learn from the relationship, it was a success."

gayyoungold,2stgdj,thistime_neveragain,3,Wed Jan 21 00:42:00 2015 UTC,"No, you're not supposed to forget your memories of him or the good times you all had. The good and bad memories are there to inform us of how to act in the future.  The point of grieving is to learn a lesson - a life lesson. Let me share some of the ones that I think you might be able to learn from your recent experience and see if they resonate with you.   Could you have communicated better? Could you have been part of a more communicative relationship? For instance, when he invited you on the cruise, what did you say? Did you say the radically honest thing such as, ""it sounds very exciting but I feel as if I just met you. Do you think you could ask me in a month?"". I would be far more understanding if someone said this to me rather than a week and a half before the cruise, expressing an interest in going on a trip that had previously been refused. I would have said ""no"" because I would have been offended/incredulous. It takes a lot of planning to go on a cruise. Adding someone a week before? Airfare, tickets, passports... Dude...c'mon, that's just uncool. I understand that you were feeling insecure, but that's not the best tactic.    Lesson 1: Learn to communicate. You're in college. Take a communications course. I did just recently. It was a great refresher. Learn to be radically honest. Say the hard stuff but think ahead before saying it. Ask for time to consider something; only a jerk wouldn't give you time if he could.   I've been a CEO. It isn't all fun and games. Some of us don't pay attention to our personal cell phones the way a 20-something does. Also, you might want to take an alternative view of why it took him until Monday to return your call about adding you to the cruise. Yes, it could be that he was ignoring you, but what if the travel agent doesn't work the weekend? My best friend's wife doesn't and all she does is book cruise travel.    Lesson 2: Learn what empathy is and employ it to change the narrative. If you can change how things look to you...for instance, instead of feeling slighted by how long it took for him to respond, try to understand other reasons why he might not be responding.    Many older gentlemen who are fortunate to have their looks, who were insightful enough to care for their bodies, were fortunate enough to see success in their careers...they know they're in short supply and in relative high demand. There were probably 10 more guys right behind you who would have really wanted to go on a cruise. Sometimes, people don't need a complex relationship in order to pay thousands of dollars to treat you to something. Sometimes your companionship is enough.    Lesson 3: Yes, you're unique, but... This is probably the most difficult realization I ever had, myself. I come from a family of long, successful marriages, so I had a somewhat skewed point of view. I didn't realize that, in the end, people may miss us if we're not part of their lives, but people move on, find new loves, and that's part of life.   Start seeing a counselor/therapist. It's good for you. Start reading ""The Ethical Slut"" by Dossier Easton and Janet Hardy for valuable communication techniques. Take a communications class. Learn what active listening is. Get rid of whatever emotion/thought-process it was that said it would be okay to ask him to include you on the cruise a week and a half before it set sail. Allow yourself some time to grieve before you date or have sex - it distracts you from learning your lessons. Contact me if you'd like more information on what I said above or want to chat.   Edit: made one of the lessons a lot less about me, and more about people in general."
gayyoungold,2stgdj,Flcl90,2,Sun Jan 18 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"I think what really got me wasn't that he was ignoring me but rather that it has never happened. I normally don't use my phone to text, I really hate it, but it was the main form of contact with him, unfortunately, because we had trouble syncing our schedules for voice. What I told him when he asked me to go on the cruise was: ""I want to go, but I just met you and I want to spend the time with my family.""     Edit: also, I tried really hard to justify his situation in my head, but that just lead me to wonder more, which actually made it worse for me."
gayyoungold,2stgdj,thistime_neveragain,2,Sun Jan 18 17:59:10 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you on communication and not asking for a cruise a week before. But your ""info"" about older guys who looks good is seriously just... sad.   Sure it's up the the guys you see to decide if they want to be with you or not even though you got a few other guys you see as well. But if that's the case the guy OP was seeing should have been honest about it. Just because you look good doesn't mean you should act like a douche.   This goes for both younger and older guys though. There is too much ""I do what I want"" mentality going around. It's like people can't see their actions might hurt someone.   Just be honest from the beginning and communicate and see if you are on the same page. If not, someone has to change OR both need to move on. Also treat others as you want to be treated."
gayyoungold,2stgdj,headShrinker,2,Mon Jan 19 08:27:33 2015 UTC,"My entire response to OP's post assumes that he's gotten things backwards. As such, I'm not looking for flaws in the older man's behavior - I'm looking for possible misinterpretations made by OP. We can't truly offer advice unless we treat him as completely incorrect in his interpretation or we have the older man's side of the story. Anything else is sympathizing with OP.  Further, I don't suggest that good looks excuses anyone's behavior, and I don't make a judgment as to whether either party is in the wrong...because we only have one side of the story. Therefore, I was offering an alternative view of most of the points OP made. I'll go back and edit in order to sharpen my point and make it less about me. Thanks for the feedback."

Sounds like while you like him, you two were on different schedules, with different temperaments. Oh well there are even better guys out there. It just takes time to find them.

gayyoungold,2shrls,waha501,2,Thu Jan 15 07:15:56 2015 UTC,"..............fairly typical hookup, if that's what you're wanting.  But if a longer-term relationship has any appeal, there are a lot of us out there, and it most likely won't include strip clubs or groping in a bar; more like cuddling in bed, breakfast the way you'd like it served by a naked old guy, swimming in a mountain lake, watching TV, working out together, dinner at the local grill..............boring shit like that."

So, I'll start with how it started.  I had the day off, and my roommates were at work. I was feeling horny so I hopped on craigslist to see what was available. Nothing.  I decided to post my own listing and within a few minutes, I had several responses. Only one was worth my time, as they followed my requests, seemed polite, and were willing to work on my tight schedule. I only had a two hour time frame to work with, so that was a lot to ask all things considered.  He sent me a pic of his cock and I was... impressed to say the least. He's taller than me by a lot, but we're ahem... gifted the same. In my past attempts, this is where I'd back out. Instead, I sent him my address.  I know, that was dumb. Very, very dumb. I couldn't believe I had pressed send, and wanted to do anything to take it back. In too deep now, I told myself.  Eventually, he gets here and I debated whether or not to go out to meet him. He arrived a lot later than planned, and I had already jerked off. Also, since he was so late the risk was very high that my roommates would be here any moment. He respectfully waited outside for my response, and I decided not to let him in.  I don't know why, but I thought about it some more. Before I knew what was happening, I went outside and asked him to come in. We went straight into my room, barely saying a word.  We started out kissing for a few seconds, felt each other up and then took off our pants. He started off by sucking me and it felt... ok. Not spectacular, not terrible. Just ok. The last blowjob I got (from a girl) felt so much better to be honest. Since I had already jerked off I thought I wouldn't cum, plus I've never really cum from blowjobs before. I knew it wasn't going to happen, so we switched spots.  I sucked his cock without hesitation, but I honestly wasn't feeling into it. It was just there in front of me ""in too deep,"" I reminded myself, and dutifully went about my business. The texture surprised me the most. It was exactly like licking the hairless part of my arms. He was very clean, so it smelled like soap, and didn't taste like anything.  I felt bad, since I'm sure I wasn't doing a fantastic job and I wasn't very into it. I felt my teeth hit his cock a few times (it was very large, in my defense). After a few minutes of that we went into 69. I began to go soft, but he was ready to cum in a few short seconds. He fucked my throat and came, I was gagging but I kept it all down and swallowed.  I let him know I probably wouldn't cum, but he tried anyways. By this point, I realized this whole scenario wasn't for me. Sure, it felt good, but I didn't feel that same desire I feel with women. I decided that I wasn't going to try this again, and told myself ""Ah, fuck it. No need to impress him then."" I let myself go for the first time while receiving a blow job, and pushed his head down at the pace I wanted, and thought about fucking a cute girl I've been seeing. For maybe the third time in my entire life, I was able to cum.  Honestly, I'm unimpressed. It didn't live up to what I thought it would be. I find wayyy more excitement with women than I did with him. I won't be repeating this experience, even though it wasn't a bad one.  However, I will say this awakened me to an important part of my sexuality. Climaxing from receiving oral sex has always been extremely difficult for me. Don't get me wrong, they almost always feel amazing, but I just couldn't ever finish. It has happened before, but it was extremely difficult and not enjoyable overall. Until today, I figured I was just cursed like that. It wasn't until I decided that I wasn't going to repeat this experience that I was able to relax and just let myself enjoy it the way I wanted to.  So, now I just need to find a special lady friend who will let me fuck her face like that guy let me fuck his :P"

My only observation is do you think the fact that you jerked off shortly before he arrived had something to do with your difficulty in climaxing?  I certainly have issues climaxing if I have jerked off a short time before getting down to business.

You get a gold star for giving it a shot."

gayyoungold,2s0v5u,ianw339,3,Sun Jan 11 02:35:17 2015 UTC,My first time was with my partner.  He is 8inches 6inches round.  It worked out fine for me because he took it slow with me.  I was excited for his size. I went in with that mind set. The negative aspect is I'm a size queen now :p
gayyoungold,2s0v5u,GerontoMan,1 point,Sun Jan 11 03:25:52 2015 UTC,Jesus Christ! Yeah... I don't know if I could do that! Large penises seem kind of frightening to me. It's probably just because I've never had sex with somebody who was like 8 inches. Sheeeeeit.
gayyoungold,2s0v5u,RustyGuns,1 point,Sun Jan 11 03:44:29 2015 UTC,Jeez that sounds amazing! lucky you!
gayyoungold,2s0v5u,youyouyuyu,1 point,Sun Jan 11 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly you just have to have a lot of lube and take it really slow. I have taken months off being fucked to let my ass heal and all you gotta do is take it slow.   I remember my first time and the guy was huge. I was legitimately scared, yet extremely turned on lol. It will hurt at first no doubt. But that pain will turn into some incredible pleasure ;)"
gayyoungold,2s0v5u,YesAn0therthr0waway,2,Sun Jan 11 19:55:48 2015 UTC,"Try starting off with a buttplug and graduating up to different sized dildos. If you're not used to it, having something up there can be pretty uncomfortable and warming up to that feeling and size will help a lot."
gayyoungold,2s0v5u,Avunculous,2,Sun Jan 11 03:58:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but i dont think i have enough dildos for that!"
gayyoungold,2s0v5u,Cedricbond,2,Sun Jan 11 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"I only have a couple years experience with getting fucked, but here's my thoughts:  Try to have him play with your ass with his tongue (if he's comfortable with that) and then fingers with lube.  Start with 1 finger, have that eventually go all the way then and then try two fingers.  If his finger nails cause you sharp pains tell him.  If it feels like his fingers feel really hot like a burning sensation, tell him you need more lube.  You'll probably clench down on his fingers for a while, but just remember to focus on breathing and your ass will relax.    When you feel ready to take his cock, lots of lube, and just take it slow.  Remember to breathe out.  Breathing can take your mind off the initial shock and again for when he's all the way in you.  I'm thinking if you transition from fingers (1, 2, 3 fingers) to a 9 inch cock there's going to be pain.  If there isn't some initial pain (since you're a virgin) then damn well done!  Oh and in regards to being clean, some will say a healthy digestive system and a shower is all you need, but if you want to be sure, you could look into cleaning your ass out with an enema bulb.  If you have questions about cleaning feel free to ask.  Have fun and play safe!"

gayyoungold,2rzq5u,throwatwataway,2,Sun Jan 11 10:02:50 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend (47) and I (24) hold hands in public, but that's about it usually.  Sometimes we'll do a peck, but that's usually in NYC or when we're with a big group of friends.  When I'm with a group of people I know I'm usually not worried about anyone's reaction.  We live in North Jersey so there's really not much to be worried about usually, but some places we err on the side of caution, e.g. when we're at a bar that has more backwoodsy clientele.  To tell you the truth, I don't really worry about the age difference that much, but I know people are forming their own judgments when they realize we're dating.  When we actually meet people and get to know them, though, they realize that what we have is real."
gayyoungold,2rzq5u,bisensual,2,Sat Jan 10 22:13:10 2015 UTC,"Recently kissed in the middle of an airport surrounded by people. Got no negative reactions but it felt as though a thousand eyes were staring at us. Just something we have to get used to I guess, and definitely wouldn't be something I'd do everywhere. I'm not really concerned with what people think, but I am concerned with some people becoming aggressive."
gayyoungold,2rzq5u,youyouyuyu,2,Sun Jan 11 04:01:20 2015 UTC,"I've hugged, kissed, held hands, cuddled up on a park bench while people jogged past... if anyone cared, they didn't say anything.  Everyone's got their own life to worry about, only a few people are going to give you a second thought. You're simply not that important to them. People you actually know can be another story, but they should hopefully realise that it IS a real relationship.  Of course, you should only do what you're comfortable with blah blah blah, you know the drill. It'll probably be fine, but it only takes one arsehole to cause issues..."
gayyoungold,2rzq5u,8Adnihilo8,1 point,Sun Jan 11 06:51:26 2015 UTC,"The young man I'm dating has stated that he has trouble with PDA, so it was with some surprise when he kissed me at the bottom of the ski run the other day. He also surprised me by squeezing me from behind later. He also kissed me that day out at the car with several families getting ready to leave.   It felt as if he was becoming more comfortable.   He's also reached out and grasped my hand as we took a walk through town (very liberal college town), but when we drew near to other people, we would disconnect.   All this is leading to my assertion that PDA is probably something that becomes easier over time."

gayyoungold,2rziau,gosutag,2,Mon Jan 26 21:25:51 2015 UTC,"How are you approaching these relationships?   Is it a hook-up first situation? While I know we live in a pretty sexualized society where people are fine with casually having sex with each other; I really do believe it's a little detrimental towards finding real and genuine relationships. If you're trying to find someone to settle down with in a long-term relationship, there's no reason to rush sex.  I also noticed you mention distance, depending on your personal situation that's not a total bad thing. The internet is an amazing tool, and while it definitely doesn't beat being able to touch the other person...it does help. I know plenty of people who were far from each other and either visit frequently or end up moving."

gayyoungold,2rlwgf,ThePassions,9,Wed Jan 7 07:25:17 2015 UTC,"One of my friends is 58 and picked up a date who was 22 who didn't drive. It's really not a big deal to most older men, they've been there and they're more understanding of situations than many men our age. I also suffer from anxiety, so I know how hearing that won't change your fears once a thought enters your mind... and honestly you'll still be sweating and heart pounding every time you meet a new guy... It's just the reality. If he's okay with driving you, it sounds like he's interested and understanding enough, so try to counter the intrusive anxiety with the knowledge that your situation is not an issue for him from the sound of things."
gayyoungold,2rlwgf,IDontGiveAFuckOrShit,5,Wed Jan 7 08:01:39 2015 UTC,When it comes to actually meeting we all have anxiety; it's completely normal and even expected.  Go to a coffee shop and meet the guy.  There's nothing wrong with two guys having coffee.  You are not alone on this and if you live your life being afraid of the age difference it's going to be a miserable time.  Go meet him and see where it goes and let us know how it goes.  Good luck:-)
gayyoungold,2rlwgf,waha501,2,Wed Jan 7 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"This is one of the hardest parts of being in older relationships. I was dating a guy who was 45 when I was 18 and I would have to constantly make up stories as to where I was spending the night or where  I was. One time it caught up to me but I brushed it off. I was good at hiding it.  It was kinda awkward at first though because he knew my dad from the gym. I remember our second date he asked me ""is your dad x.? We had a good laugh and dated for a year until I found out he was fucking around on me.   Oh and he would always pick me up. I would have him get me from down the street and say I was taking the bus. They honestly don't mind, as long as they can see that you are a good person and that you are into them.   My next relationship was with a guy four hours away and I would fly there a bunch to see him. Now that one was hard to hide lol.   You just gotta be good with your stories and make sure you remember everything you say. It sucks but sometimes you gotta keep some aspects of your life private."

The pictures don't give any indication that the two even look like they know each other. It's a very unflattering picture of fry and his man doesn't look too happy in that one."
gayyoungold,2riq4m,IDontGiveAFuckOrShit,1 point,Tue Jan 6 21:40:46 2015 UTC,You make a good point.  Most of the pictures I see going around today are ones where one or both don't look all that happy.  It is almost like they looked for photos that were unflattering...although a quick image search I did didn't show any super happy photos of them together either.    I mean maybe Elliott just isn't too happy about the star attention Fry gets so thats why he isn't smiling when they take pics in public.  They could be all smiles behind closed doors for all we know.  The two should maybe post a little happy photo together on instagram or something to off set the sour ones we keep seeing.

I actually already loved him and thought he was hilarious and smart, but it was great seeing him talk to younger artists and collaborate with them as people. It's like... When you worry that someone older who you look up to is going to be patronizing toward you because of your age (I wrote to Frans de Waal once, for example, and he was very short with me). Stephen Fry seems like he appreciates cool people at face value."

It's not everyday we hear of something like this. Hopefully they have a meaningful and long relationship. I would kill to have a conversation with these two.

It happens to everyone (like he said, it happens to him too!). Don't let it get to you. Try not jerking off so much if you wanna cum to him."

It was amazing money at 18 lol (300-500 a night). And yea... I never showed my face or junk on cam4, just my torso and upper butt :)"
gayyoungold,2r21cy,throwawayprofile1985,5,Fri Jan 2 01:25:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course it is risky. The men who buy you are under no obligation to tell you the truth about their sexual status and you can easily be exposed to diseases. They can take a condom off or violently attack you and you will have no option for recourse because you are a prostitute and no one will care unfortunately. This is not something to take lightly, you may ""like older men anyway"" but do you like scat? Torture? Rape? All of these things are very  possible when you let yourself defenseless into a stranger's home."
gayyoungold,2r21cy,100and8,1 point,Fri Jan 2 01:49:20 2015 UTC,Ah ok but to be honest the few older men I met were from online chatrooms. They came with similar risks as I'm not out and turned up at strangers houses. I know it's foolish but I have met guys hammered drunk before.   It's both for the possibility of money and fantasy.. just makeing sure I know what I could be getting I to if I do it.
gayyoungold,2r21cy,GerontoMan,2,Fri Jan 2 01:55:51 2015 UTC,"You'll never be able to know if the guy you're seeing is a potential rapist or a cheat. Sure, the money might be fast but it never lasts. Escorting/prostitution is one of those things that people rarely manage to do lifelong.   Many have issues with their self esteem (probably before they started) and I imagine sex work doesn't help that along any. Considering you've given us nothing in the way of information about you - I would say no. Especially if your ""client base"" would be people you've spoken w/ on chat rooms.   Wake the fuck up, that's crazy. You know how many deranged people there are?   I'd say no. Considering these are going to be men you would find yourself (on chat rooms!) I wouldn't expect such a high return & thus it isn't worth it. There's a personal cost to everything but I'm confident you would find this to be surprisingly exhausting in multiple ways.   Stick to role play with one trusted person. Don't involve money. Trust me"
gayyoungold,2r21cy,youyouyuyu,3,Fri Jan 2 16:47:08 2015 UTC,"I'm saying this with the risk of sounding like an asshole but honestly, it is people like you that make intergen relationships so hard.  Older men who are legitimately attracted to younger guys get called perverts and are labelled as predators. Younger men legitimately dating older men are automatically prostitutes.   Like it or not when sex turns into a money situation it gives off a sleazy vibe and has a hand in turning things that are natural to that of taboo. You say you like older men? Don't whore yourself out to them unless it's the difference between living on the street or sleeping in the safety of a home."
gayyoungold,2r21cy,Robolabo,1 point,Fri Jan 2 03:47:42 2015 UTC,"No experience, but there have been some AMA's by male prostitutes. If you are seriously considering this (you shouldn't) go read them to understand the situtation and how to make yourself safer.   As others have mentioned, there are tons of risks. Violence and abuse, disease, robbery, and more. You say in one of your replies that you are not out, and I think being a rent boy is going to cause some serious problems for you.  If this is a fantasy you have, try to find someone who you can share it with safely. met and set up boundaries before hand, than act it out the next day."

gayyoungold,2r21cy,aron2295,2,Fri Jan 2 01:32:14 2015 UTC,That's for reply. Some part of it is to be submissive masochistic sex at someone else's behest.

Reminds me of what it was like falling in love with my husband and how wonderful everything was.  It sounds like you two are having a wonderful life together.  Enjoy and keep working at it.  There are always ups and downs in relationships but nobody is perfect.  All that matters is that you two make each other happy.  Enjoy the new year together!
gayyoungold,2qt61t,Whitedragon2,2,Tue Dec 30 16:23:38 2014 UTC,"I totally agree, as much as we want to avoid fighting, the little things that set me off (it's usually me and my fault is that im very temperamental) but no matter how much i am angry at him, i still want to see him no matter what. i remember one time i drove all the way to his house an hour away just to talk with him and see his side of the story even though i am super mad. I've never done that to anyone but we both don't want to lose each other so we have to adjust to make our relationship work. I don't know it's just I can't stand a day without seeing him or talking with him.   We're both very discrete and I think that's what we love about our relationship. Our families, friends and anyone we know don't know we're both gay but we plan to open up as soon as we can. Were both very introverted and our family's both very traditional so we're taking baby steps.   Thank you and happy new year to you and your husband! :)"

Sometimes we do better if we sleep on it, but most of the time it is best to talk it out before bed.  Glad to hear that being with him makes you both want to take steps to open to family more.  My husband set my off on doing that to my loved ones.  He made me realize that if I really love him and want to spend my life with him then I need to be honest with my family/friends.  Very happy to say everyone accepts us and we never have issues with any of them.  He has chosen not to come out to family and friends but I gather they must have figured something was going on by now. It his his choice though so, just a little tip, let him decide when/if he wants to open up.  Never push him to, its something he must decide to do with you on his own.  Hope the year is good to you both!"

I know from your earlier post that you're hesitant to post a picture of you two, and that's OK, but I'd still like to see a pic.  And I can totally relate to you calling him ""daddy."" I call my bf ""Papa"" and he's only a year and a half older than me!"
gayyoungold,2qt61t,samuel33334,1 point,Tue Dec 30 19:38:10 2014 UTC,"Awww :) It's really amazing. I can't believe we ended up with each other! It was serendipity I guess. The first time we met up, the way he takes a day off from work just to take care of me when I'm sick, all the little things.   I wish I can show you how handsome he is, how cute he is for a daddy bear :) He's chubby but he isn't obese he's just the right amount of daddy.   He dresses like a daddy so I have to sometimes buy him clothes and teach him color combinations. It's funny he said that every time he looks at his closet after meeting me, he makes sure to put on the clothes that would be ""passable"" for me. He's just innately sweet and innocent.   We have a good laugh every time he mispronounces something like when I buy clothes at ""Uni Glow"" instead of Uniqlo, etc.   I thought 2014 was the worst year of my life until I met him! I hope and pray that 2015 and from now on the succeeding years, will be the best years of the rest of our lives :)  Happy new year!"

You'll learn ( each of you) if this 'friendship' can be a full fledged relationship.  I don't think the age difference is of much import.  Perhaps part of the attraction is his ""frenchness"" - which is distinct in many ways from American lifestyle. You may find this quality of life more to your taste - I did - and choose to live there. Sounds pretty appealing to me."
gayyoungold,2qqvvm,throwawayyor,1 point,Mon Dec 29 21:08:59 2014 UTC,"I agree, excerpt for the fact that it runs the risk of breaking up. If they have been together two years I doubt him looking at his emails will be the breaking point.   I personally would find it frustrating that he is lying like that. It would make me wonder what else he has hidden. Generally guys like that are good at covering stuff up. (The whole friend date sounded weird to me)  Be honest and you will never have to lie and if the person can't cope then they aren't the right person for you :)"

And the other fucked around by picking up guys on manhunts I remember asking him why he still had it and he had said he would go on when he was bored...

Just say for the first time you two meet its established the two of you will just masturbate to porn or to each other. This will allow for there to be an established limit to what will be going on. If you're comfortable with the situation make a move or let him make a move. This will allow you to both engage with each other and build on to the experience. First jerking then hand jobs, oral and so on.  Also, make sure someone knows where you will be and maybe meet for lunch or something in public first."

In terms of personality type, the top qualities I adore are a sense of the world outside himself, compassion for others, a good sense of humor, and some qualities that are different than the qualities I embody. Adventurousness and a willingness to move a bit outside a personal comfort zone is key, too, but not so far that he's a wanton, reckless, jerk. Intelligence and smarts are good, but I don't equate those to education. Some level of emotional awareness and maturity helps. And so does the ability to speak openly and directly.  In terms of physicality, I tend to go for guys who are slender to skinny (not really attracted to the muscle-bound gym bunny or linebacker build, but there are exceptions), smooth, and dark-haired. I find a lot of Asian and Latino guys very attractive, but I don't think I fetishize them. Or at least I hope I don't so.

Thing was, I wasn't expecting him at all.  Asked several times but his roomie was being his usual passive/aggressive, self-centered, narcissistic self (can you tell how much I like him) and would say if he wanted to make dinner or not.  So after asking several days what he wanted to do, I gave up, went out and got stuff for lasagna and was going to make it for myself.  Not a Christian so December 25th is just a day for me and besides Jesus, if there was a Jesus was born in July so go figure why we celebrate his birthday, if he was born, in December."
gayyoungold,2qcurg,txholdup,1 point,Thu Dec 25 19:12:12 2014 UTC,The early Christian church made the celebration of Jesus' birth around the pagan holiday of winter solstice to try and get the pagans to switch over to Christianity.

During the 2nd Vatican Council they eliminated a bevy of saints who never really existed but were transformations of pagan gods into saints to make Catholicism more palatable.

Regardless, I've been fortunate to have made a new family. It's a cliche, I know but life definitely ""gets better"". Not too many December's ago, I could not perceive a future where I was surrounded by people that loved me but more importantly, loving myself. I could not imagine a future where I was not miserable.   As for the holidays, I'm spending it in my partner's state (U.S) with his family. All things considered, I have a lot to be happy about. It's been a good year.   I'm glad you made this post because I was also curious about the holiday plans of our members. I also wanted to say that I'm so glad that this subreddit exists & that we have tons of posters who are actively contributing to constructive discussion. I think we have a really sweet thing going here. Having spent a number of my adolescent years struggling to come to terms with my sexuality, it feels good to have an inviting community that can generally relate.   I'm thankful for our group & all of you, I hope everyone is having a good time during the holidays with their loved ones.   <3"

You're young and will change a lot over the next 6 -10 years.  You might want to wait a while to discover if this bf is a keeper long term. Then will be the time to inform the parents.

gayyoungold,2q8mi9,100and8,1 point,Wed Dec 24 06:29:51 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't get too wrapped up into anything, especially if the thought is unsettling. I think a lot (and this is gay & straight) of people have found themselves at least curious of the sexuality of those older than them. It seems to me like it would be perfectly natural to be curious. It's also somewhat common to experience arousal alongside that curiosity.   The ""lightbulb moment"" for me was when I realized I had no interest in either women (both peers and older women) or males my age (or even slightly older). All of the porn I used featured older men as the common variable. I sought out relationships with older men. I want to clarify that this wasn't just sexual. I'm sure some men find themselves attracted to older men sexually but have no desire to actually have a long-term relationship with one.   For me, it's really all I know. I definitely attempted to be in a heterosexual relationship (sexual component never worked for me, nor was I emotionally involved) & I could not perform sexually with a similarly-aged male. Completely flaccid. I don't think sex is the most important part of a relationship but it is definitely a factor.   Regardless of one's particular libido, we are sexual animals by nature. As a result, for most people - it's a big deal.   Sorry to ramble with my own shit, just trying to offer my own experiences.   1). You mentioned you never felt these feelings before. Do you mean you've never felt attraction to an older male or that you never felt like you wanted to be sexually involved with one?  Sometimes it takes time and experience to make sense of your feelings. Try not to worry about it but definitely mull it over. In the event that any of this sounds familiar, try not to feel like it's impossible to live, love & work like everybody else. It's really not a big deal but I know I was very insecure about my sexuality for a long time."

gayyoungold,2q8oh0,Sinuext,3,Wed Dec 24 02:59:21 2014 UTC,"It is possible for a human to alter their behavior if they really want to?  Yes.   Is it at all likely that someone will suddenly stop an deeply, deeply ingrained habit just because you want them to?  Almost certainly not.   I personally don't understand your relationship with him. You seem to expect monogamy (calling what he does ""cheating"") but imply that he wasn't really in a mutually agreed upon monogamous relationship with you at the time.  You seem to expect a lifelong relationship, but he broke off a connection with you, you haven't even been dating him for some time, and he now seems willing to drop his relationship with Person 3 at the drop of a hat. (But he hasn't done that yet either.)  I feel as though there's an enormous gap between your expectations and his expectations, and it doesn't sound realistic to me that you won't get seriously hurt emotionally unless you really work on building trust that you can both actually fulfill each other's expectations beyond momentary promises."
gayyoungold,2q8oh0,StrappedJock,1 point,Wed Dec 24 08:03:10 2014 UTC,"Ah sorry. Seems like I missed a lot. You are right.  He also wants a monogamic relationship. He can't stand just the thought of me having sex with another. He is thankful to me showing him what monogamy means and that he really wants to change. He never wants to visit these dating sites again, cause he says hes unstable there. I just don't know if he can do that for a really long time.  He also lived straight for 45 years and lives a gayy live for a short time. I understand his situation, that he missed much in life and wants to live that out. Trying out lot of stuff. But I don't know if he is able to change now that he tried that stuff out. He is pretty pretty active sexual wise. Sometimes more active then me.   He wants a long term relationship. He is a relationship guy. He is so happy with someone arround.   And the connection didn't really break. We write, we phone from time to time and we met few times.  He tells me he still loves me, misses me and he doesn't know if person3 really is the right choice. But he said that he has to find that out, cause otherwise he could not determine completly to me. And he does not want a relationship with me when person3 is in his mind.  Aaah it's probably way to complicated for you to give me an advice. But It's good to get this out of my head once in  a while.  But if he really wants to change in being loyal. Deep from his heart. Can you change to live a monogamic relationship? Or is this like an addiction you can never get rid of?"
gayyoungold,2q8oh0,GerontoMan,1 point,Wed Dec 24 13:42:42 2014 UTC,"People can change but most people don't. I'm not saying run at the slightest complication but be realistic and respect yourself. You clearly have issues with this & you want a monogamous partner. He's probably never going to change. At a certain age, it's clear. You know?  You probably don't want to hear it. Just try to be aware of your feelings."
gayyoungold,2q8oh0,daddybearsftw,1 point,Wed Dec 24 18:37:30 2014 UTC,This sub is a perfect example of people with long term relationships with age differences of even greater than 34 years! Totally doable.

Long term relationships work because people work at it. It seems like a poor comparison to say that because some here have long term relationships with large age differences, anything can happen. ""If they can do it, so can you!"". That's bullshit.   All long term relationships require dedication. It's not always easy but it works because people try.  :-)"

And there seems to be a grey area on the cheating part? Complications in relationships will turn nasty and this sounds complicated.
gayyoungold,2q8oh0,2scompany,1 point,Wed Dec 24 17:19:39 2014 UTC,"Sorry what do you mean with NPD? And yeah.. They grey area on the cheating part is that we never really were in a relationship. So basicly you could say he did not cheat. But we were in a relationship more or less. It were just the complicated circumstances which did not led to a ""real"" relationship. But he felt really rellay bad everytime that happened and.. yeah. God damn its so hard to explain his behavoir when you didnt see it / when you dont know him.  I know it sounds like I dont want to accept he is an ""asshole""... But .. I dont know.."
gayyoungold,2q8oh0,toolz0,1 point,Sat Dec 27 02:32:34 2014 UTC,I don't think the age difference is a big problem.  You love him ( in your way) but does he love you - in your way or in his way?  And is what he is able and willing to provide in that department enough to satisfy you - for the very long term?  'Love' in the gay world is not the same as in the straight world - there are fewer conventions that aid things to work. If you can be comfortable to roll with the punches in this relationship it might work.  But from what you tell us I think it will be tough sledding.

He got a boyfriend and now we hook up about once a week, I blow his mind, he goes home, I do my thing, and then a few days later, he wants it again. He's made it clear that he wants to date around his age; let him reach out to you."
gayyoungold,2ptieq,thistime_neveragain,2,Fri Dec 19 21:09:02 2014 UTC,"I agree. He's made his thoughts clear and you need to respect that. If something is going to change it needs to be on his part, and trying to force it could make him push back harder.   Keep doing what you've been doing."

How you doin'? ...  Now back on topic! From what I understand from your story I'm guessing your assumptions are right. He is most likely into older men but doesn't want to give in to that... yet.  I went through a similar phase when I was a bit younger (22-23), me liking older men just didn't seem realistic. After a while I caved, guys my age did nothing for me.  My advise would be to give him a call and just ask him whatsup. Maybe he'll be honost, maybe not. I'm guessing you can tell how he is feeling by his reactions.  Hope this helps!"

There are aspects of my life that are still in the closet and I dearly wish that they weren't. Maybe it's because I'm not ready or I'm simply a coward but I do think about completely coming out of the closet every day.  Might be what you already know but you just have to be honest with yourself first. It sounds like you're beginning to realize that your attraction to (older) men is A. actually real; and B. larger than your attraction to women. The sooner you're comfortable with that the sooner your life will seem more stable.  If you want to experience more with a man, and even love with a man, then the best course of action would be to break up with your girlfriend and even be completely honest with her. It probably won't go down well especially if you don't explain it but it's much better than leaving one lie to live in another lie. Unless you've discussed an open relationship with her then don't fuck around behind her back--that's just scummy and in this case even more extremely selfish and exploitative/manipulative. It's not about her or anybody else letting you live your life, it's about you allowing yourself to live it."

gayyoungold,2pmtqp,dudeokie,2,Thu Dec 18 04:30:34 2014 UTC,Don't cheat on your girlfriend. Start with that. If you want to explore dating men then you need to break up with her.
gayyoungold,2pmtqp,KoolAidCrisis,2,Thu Dec 18 01:16:50 2014 UTC,"Okay so you're only 19 now. 90% chance you'll break up with your girlfriend over something stupid because that's what you do when you're 19; no offense.   After that happens just play the field a bit, have some experiences and learn a little more about yourself and what you like.   The other option I might propose would be to confide this information to your girlfriend, see what she has to say. Maybe you're both into hot daddy types ;)"
gayyoungold,2pmtqp,thistime_neveragain,1 point,Thu Dec 18 03:37:41 2014 UTC,"I'm going to recommend you get the book ""The Ethical Slut"" by Dossie East on and Janet Hardy. It's a book that I recommend to just about everyone because it outlines the necessary communication for polyamorous/polysexual relationships. That might not be what you're going for, but that level of communication is what most people (and relationships) need. Good luck."
gayyoungold,2pezq9,Sluts_of_Chernobyl,9,Tue Dec 16 00:33:19 2014 UTC,"I really don't know how to respond.  Some of the older folks, like my age, are full of tricks.  Personally, I don't do tricks, lie, misrepresent or kiss and tell.  I have great admiration for younger men.  However, there are those who have only sex on their mind and will go to great lengths to get it.  Maybe he hasn't had the car with electric locks very long.  I got my first vehicle with those damn things 3 years ago and I still walk up to the driver door sometimes and fumble with my keys before realizing I just have to push a button."
gayyoungold,2pezq9,waha501,6,Tue Dec 16 01:22:25 2014 UTC,"Hmm, I don't think I like that test.  As you pointed out, if you've developed a system like that it (weither or not you actually are) implies that your doing this a lot.   I don't think I would have opened the door, because to me it could come off as impatient. There's a ton of different ways people could interpret a lot of different ways."
gayyoungold,2pezq9,Robolabo,7,Tue Dec 16 03:11:27 2014 UTC,"Your assumption that it was a test does not mean that it indeed was. He may simply have been observing how considerate you were at the moment. And he might not have been fumbling for his keys in order to unlock the door, but to have them ready to insert in the ignition. It's certainly easier to get them out of one's pockets outside the car, than after sitting down.   When I go out with a younger guy, I'm not really interested in testing or tricking them. I would, however, decline future dates with a younger man who was constantly making the assumption that older guys are up to something shady all the time."

There could be tons of reasons why he had difficulty getting his door open, other than some weird little mind game. He might have been nervous, maybe he wasn't used to RFID keys. Maybe he's had them & he never uses the ""clicker"". Who knows. Maybe ask him and gauge his response?  Just sounds to me you're overthinking it.   Hell, I'm younger & I'm just physically clumsy. Lol"
gayyoungold,2pezq9,GerontoMan,4,Tue Dec 16 20:38:51 2014 UTC,People will actually do these tests? Maybe you just misinterpreted what he was doing? Maybe you're just giving it too much thought. I would have just opened the door and wouldn't have thought much about it...even if he praised me for opening it.
gayyoungold,2pezq9,thistime_neveragain,3,Tue Dec 16 04:45:31 2014 UTC,"I always unlock the lock of the driver's side door if he had the manners to unlock and open mine. I don't open the door specifically (I unlock) because I may open it into traffic or another car door parked next to us. But I do unlock it. If I'm the driver, I always unlock and open the passenger door. Sometimes I close it. It seems the thing to do.  As for litmus tests: everyone has criteria by which they decide if someone is going to be a good match. Whether his was seeing if you'd open the door, so what? I understand your point about seeming like a player, but people with more age under their belt, tend to have more experience, and what does experience tell us?   Experience tells us what we want, how we want it, our boundaries, what constitutes the exceptions we'll make to our boundaries when someone is worth the effort, and the list goes on.  Point is, you were assessing him just as much as he was assessing you."

But I do tend to evaluate the status of a relationship based on his reactions in three environments: (1) a semi-divey brew pub; (2) a cigar bar; and (3) a road trip lasting at least 2-3 hours.   If he's comfortable and we're having a good time in all three, he's probably a keeper.  :-)"

YOUR litmus test seems to be whether a guy use a litmus test or not. Every date has an element of judgement by certain standards, you passed his but in passing his he didn't pass yours. I'm calling it the Intergen-Homosexual Litmus Paradox, I'll credit you when I publish it.   You're painting him as some calculative 'player' who contrives these situations for young men regularly. If you have an issue with it, don't see him again. Personally, it wouldn't concern me."

It must be very tiresome - for yourself, and for everyone else.  The stance I often see here that older guys are somehow 'taking advantage' of younger guys is a pile of crap. I've been with a plethora of younger guys my whole (longish) life and it was never me who initiated the adventure.  The truth is young / old is not rare or particularly pertinent in sex  - and for a great many young people, being more hormonally charged, they are the ones coming onto attractive older men."

A large community isn't going to help you be a ""proper gay citizen"" anymore than a small one. Trust me, you're not exactly missing out on things by having been unable to visit the bars. I suppose this is subjective - I'm not very fond of bars & I haven't met any people I'd want to spend my life with there.   If you're looking for dudes on grindr, growler & scruff & LGBT bars (admittedly, they are probably better than just Craigslist) to get laid - that's what you're going to find. Do you know what you were looking for? That's not sarcasm, it's an honest question.   Sometimes it's easier (because of the lack of experience, naturally) to know what you don't want than what you do. Use this as a sense of direction. You don't like your campus politics, cool - don't go. Don't force yourself into doing things you don't like to do. Your local bars/LGBT environments filled with people you've already fucked, don't go."
gayyoungold,2p9n1h,GerontoMan,1 point,Sun Dec 14 18:38:25 2014 UTC,"Do you know what you were looking for?   I've been around the block enough, literally, to know that I'm looking for friends. Literally everything else comes out of that--sex, platonic friendship, long-term partners--and the bar is simply the best place to do that, next to the apps. Gay people are spread out and dare I say ""unique"" enough that the process of finding someone alone is more arduous than getting to know them, wining and dining...Blah blah blah.  My frustration is centered around that. It's tremendously easy to flake when you're just a name on the phone, and it's so much harder to get to KNOW someone when you're not face to face."
gayyoungold,2p5hc1,linemancub66,3,Sat Dec 13 05:55:10 2014 UTC,"It's true that a considerable number of older guys will be focused only on sex, sad but true.  But there are those of us older guys out here that appreciate a young friend for something other than that.  If you decide to meet an older guy, meet in a public place and talk; get to know each other until you are comfortable.  Seek advice."
gayyoungold,2p5hc1,waha501,2,Sat Dec 13 14:00:35 2014 UTC,How will I be able to tell if the dude is talking for general interest or just to get me in bed?
gayyoungold,2p5hc1,waha501,2,Sat Dec 13 14:40:29 2014 UTC,"I'll tell you what I do:  I sit and chat and talk to see if he will start pushing for a hookup, then, I'll change the subject and see if he comes back to sex.  After a while, it will become apparent what his main goal is.  If you want to hook up, that's fine; go for it.  I've done that many, many times.  But if he's looking for something more meaningful that may evolve into having a sexual aspect later he won't show signs of distress when you don't express an eagerness to go for immediate sexual gratification.   I met a guy off CraigsList last week and we sat and chatted in a restaurant for 3 hours.  No sex, but we covered a myriad of subjects and we're going to meet again , soon I hope.  We'll see where it goes."

I completely agree with his approach to meeting guys.  Two additional thoughts, though ... .  Keep in mind that a lot of us older guys have the same sorts of anxiety and trepidation but for different reasons. You're suspicious that older guys just want you for sex. I'm suspicious that younger guys just want me for money. You're not looking to be a sex toy, and I'm not looking to be a sugar daddy. You're nervous about not being able to find a good relationship with someone older, and I'm nervous about not finding a good relationship with someone younger.  I think we're all a bit nervous about meeting someone, dating, romance, etc. I think the trick to finding a good relationship is to bring that nervousness out into the open at the right time. So, don't be afraid to talk openly about your suspicions and concerns at the right time. Maybe not the first meeting, or even the first date, but if you're concerned that some guy is after you just for sex, you might talk about that openly with him before you have sex.  Second, you said that you're just going to be ignored or overlooked. Anyone who is attracted to you and into you won't ignore or overlook you.  :-)  When you meet the guy who talks to you for 3 hours (like waha501's experience), that's when you'll know you're not being ignored or overlooked.  Or in my case, I use a road trip as a test. If I can take a drive with a guy for at least 2-3 hours, and if we're able to both chat and sit in silence comfortably, then I know I'm not being ignored or overlooked. If we have that nervous, uncomfortable silence, then I know something isn't quite right.  Maybe you can find your own yardstick to measure that same factor."

I could not help but notice the eyes on me as I entered a gay space. These glaring men usually were not my type (older white haired men with glasses), so this one made me feel more like a piece of meat. It still happens to me but I have learned to expect and ignore it.   My advice is having open conversations about sexual desires/expectations and money sooner than later. My ex was a wealthy ER doc and I was still in undergrad. So I felt guilty for going to expensive restaurants and on weekend trips that I couldn't afford my share. Our society constructs a masculinity on being able to provide for a spouse. But us that are in intergenerational relationships have to understand that we are entering the partnership at different levels. But these differences do not have to define how sex and intimacy are negotiated."

I made my husband promise to not leave me hanging as I only spoke English and didn't want to be left alone with her.  My husband also never came out to his mother, but she must have known.  I mean we adopted kids together so in his family it was like an unspoken rule.  They were all nice to me but lived in another state so we didn't visit them much.  My family was pretty opposite as I came out to all of them and they were very accepting.  To ease the nerves of my husband and my family I slowly introduced my husband to them.  First we had lunch with my older brother and when that went well we both visited my parents for dinner.  And finally, my husband joined my family for a holiday gathering and met all my immediate family.  Not one of them has ever tried to separate us and they all have done a wonderful job making him feel welcomed.  The best was going to a large extended family gathering for the first time.  My husband was walking up to the out door event with me and my godfather came over and gave us each a strong hug and kiss.  My husband was a little taken aback by this but he soon realized that's just how my family makes you feel welcomed.  Good luck to you, hope it goes well."

All nice, he has a nephew my age that I can talk video games/school/guitar with. His middle nephew i bond with over video games and card games, plus he has an interest in computers and possibly going to uni for it so as a Comp Sci grad i can offer guidance. His youngest nephew is awesome, and hugged me when i left.   Now, his sister was awesome. Welcoming, she probably knew how hard it was for me to visit and made it very easy. Plus, she probably knew it was hard for my bf to bring me so it was just a very welcoming place. His dad is a grumpy old man (95) but likes me because i talk with him unlike my bf.

gayyoungold,2p0dxv,RustyPeach,2,Fri Dec 12 16:42:07 2014 UTC,"I totally understand. Last year, I celebrated Christmas with my partner's family. One thing that helped me is that a few months before we (my partner & I) went to the state he is from, I met his niece and that went really well. I guess we both had crazy mothers and used electronic cigarettes. That really helped ease some of my anxieties, knowing that I at least knew one person that was receptive was really helpful.   My partner's sister is batshit crazy though. Lmao. Oh, the stories! I try not worry about that though because everyone else has been really welcoming. You'll feel so relieved after you have met them though! It's a nice feeling.   One thing that I've found to be really helpful with easing the socialization along is to ask your partner for topics that individuals of his family are interested in. This Christmas, I'll be going down there again and I'm actually looking foward to it!  I can be a really socially anxious person (panic attack level anxious) so I'll just say, if I can do it with a reasonable level of comfort, I bet you can too. Just take a short mental note of conversation topics to press or avoid. That definitely helps me but similarly, I'm a ball of stress until we've arrived & settled."

I dated a friend of mine and fell in love with him, but insisted on continuing to be friends with him despite being in love. It worked out in that I got over him and now he's one of my best friends 4 years later, but in no way was that a smart decision for me (it was difficult to see him interested in other men, and I didn't really let myself get interested in other men because I was saving myself in the back of my mind for him, it was a rough time and I'm very fortunate that my feelings disapated) and I would recommend that someone in a similar situation make the same decision, I just got very lucky. In a similar way, a lot can change over the course of college and it's difficult to really know someone without meeting them in person, so while it has a chance of working out, I think it's a very unwise decision."
gayyoungold,2ozpo9,IDontGiveAFuckOrShit,1 point,Thu Dec 11 19:15:09 2014 UTC,I wouldn't say it's an unwise decision.   It's a very rare occasion that two people have a really great connection that can turn into a romance that works. Just giving up on it because of a temporary situation or something such as distance is what I consider as unwise.  There are people that go through life without knowing what it is to connect with another person and feel love. There are people who become so desperate in the search that it makes it impossible for them to actually find it. Why throw that small chance away because of distance or something such as school where emotional support is always welcome?
gayyoungold,2ozpo9,youyouyuyu,1 point,Thu Dec 11 19:32:59 2014 UTC,"Because you haven't met the person. You don't really know if you have a connection with them, and you're throwing away the chance at meeting plenty of other men that you could connect with. It can turn out that you have good chemistry, but you're putting all your eggs in one basket for a pretty low chance, it's only been a few weeks of online chatting for OP."
gayyoungold,2ozpo9,IDontGiveAFuckOrShit,1 point,Thu Dec 11 19:37:53 2014 UTC,"While I agree that meeting the person is the most important step, taking precautions to prevent getting catfished is pretty much imperative to carrying out an online relationship.   In this day and age there's no reason to avoid video chat. They might be slightly different in person but it's not going to be a complete difference from what you get on Skype or Facetime. I don't know about OPs situation but a lot of men who are interested in intergen relationships don't even get the chance to date around unless they are in a big city.   Either way, I'd rather take my chances at finding love and happiness than being scared at the low chance it succeeds. If you think about it, in today's world there's often very little chance that any relationship will last the long haul--distance or not."

It's fine that others want to keep their options open or whatever but if I'm romantically interested in someone and they in me, I'm not going to date other men. At the same time, being friends with someone prevents me from knowing them as a love interest. Casual sex isn't among my interests."
gayyoungold,2ozpo9,gosutag,2,Thu Dec 11 20:00:18 2014 UTC,"I think your biggest issues are going to be trust and patience.  Long distance is a big test of trust as there are so many opportunities for both of you to give in to temptation. There are a lot of times where you might be wondering what the other person is doing, it can corrupt your mind quite quickly.  Patience, though, is another beast. For me I struggle with not knowing when the next time we'll be able to be in each other's arms again is. We do a lot of Skyping and even this is difficult because of time difference. It's extremely frustrating when the other person is multiple hours ahead or behind you. Video calling is the only way you can be with each other yet there are other responsibilities in life that stand in the way whereas a ""normal"" relationship you'd be doing these things together. It's really great when we are with each other in person though because stupid tasks such as grocery shopping is extremely fun.  But you're in the very early stages of getting to know him. There's no reason to rush things and give what you have a title. Make sure the connection you're feeling is genuine and could be something that may last through difficulties and time. Meeting in person is very important as well, while you might know everything about him your dynamic could change for better or worse when you actually meet."

gayyoungold,2oya3b,Mossy-Toes,3,Thu Dec 11 07:03:51 2014 UTC,"I've met a few young men this way, but usually I'm very open and prefer meeting in a public place.  Since I'm no longer married, associating with younger guys is no longer a concern and I keep waiting for the right one.  A handful of meetings resulted from SilverDaddies and I confess that I'm a little bit selective.  Finding the right young man when you've crossed into the 60s isn't easy.  Good luck with him."

Do a lot of older men do this? As in, they're married but still sleep around? I'm not trying to be negative either. Just curious. He sounds like an awesome guy though! Hopefully you do get to see him again. :-)"
gayyoungold,2oya3b,kre8tif,4,Thu Dec 11 07:14:29 2014 UTC,"It is really sad actually how many married guys out there are actually gay. I feel bad for them. You only have one life.   Also have fun! And be safe, I suggest telling someone where you are going. Also make sure it's a public place.   It does sound a little weird if he wants to go somewhere alone like that."
gayyoungold,2oyaf5,RustyGuns,3,Thu Dec 11 07:08:03 2014 UTC,"Most of those sites are for hookups. Sometimes you can find someone that is looking for a relationship though.

gayyoungold,2oyaf5,waha501,1 point,Thu Dec 11 07:25:30 2014 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I personally don't think there are any gay bars around where I live but I'll see if I can find something.
gayyoungold,2oyaf5,youyouyuyu,2,Thu Dec 11 08:11:21 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the sites tend to be for hookups, but there are those of us looking for a more permanent relationship.  I have the same problem with guys living so far away.  I have a profile on SilverFoxie, but so far nothing at all has happened.  SilverDaddies has been slightly better, but I think most I've met came from Squirt or CL; but they were all looking for short term contacts.  My plan is to enroll in college and attend more events with fingers crossed and a rainbow wristband."
gayyoungold,2oyaf5,waha501,2,Thu Dec 11 14:17:35 2014 UTC,Have you tried MISTER? That's actually pretty good for being minimally hookup oriented.

I do see a lot of older men but I never actually talk to any because most of them have a ring on their finger. Not to mention, I don't know how I would approach them if they possibly are gay. Good luck! I'm sure you'll find someone. :-)"

I'm so afraid to ask that to him,none of my collages at the program had an opportunity like that, pretty much I'm the one who actively trying to build a social connection with him. and also he's my head of program. And in his facebook account it said that he's in relationship but I dont know with whom. I accidentally send a friend request to his profile, and then I erase the request right away.    No dignity at all for me, LOL"
gayyoungold,2oooss,IDontGiveAFuckOrShit,1 point,Tue Dec 9 01:38:01 2014 UTC,"Well how about you start asking him about his personal life a bit? Sneak in questions. You don't have to ask him straight up are you into men? You can ask him if he has any kids or about something tangential that will answer the question or give strong hints. But if he's in a relationship, honestly the best you can hope for is some action with him if he's gay and in an open relationship (or with him and his man)... Which is super fun and I recommend it but you may get hurt if you're interested in more."

gayyoungold,2oox21,dudeokie,1 point,Tue Dec 9 08:01:58 2014 UTC,"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Condoms are used for sex between two people so if you see one in the garbage can with cum in it literally anybody would assume it was used for sex between two people. After OP explained it his BF was cool with it too, so it's not like he was just wanking willy nilly without a condom on his willy."
gayyoungold,2oox21,sub_woofer,1 point,Tue Dec 9 08:45:48 2014 UTC,If you think that's the only thing a condom can be used for you are wrong. It can be used to cover a toy. It can be used to finger yourself. It can be used to catch the ejaculate from masturbation.

gayyoungold,2oj8rk,youyouyuyu,8,Wed Dec 10 18:14:38 2014 UTC,I always wonder how people who think that way will deal with the inevitability of getting old.  Maybe that's why body waxing and tanning is so popular - anything to look younger.
gayyoungold,2oj8rk,ReverendEntity,10,Sun Dec 7 12:42:38 2014 UTC,"Which is a bit ironic because tanning eventually catches up with the skin and makes it look older.   But a lot of people don't really think about getting old or adapt to it till it's 'too late'. It's probably the reason the perception of creepy old men is still prevalent. Older guys who are actually mature about approaching a younger person aren't creepy whatsoever, it's the ones who can't control themselves and take advantage or throw money at the situation that spoil things."
gayyoungold,2oj8rk,waha501,2,Sun Dec 7 12:50:27 2014 UTC,Not to mention the other people who choose to view older men interested in younger men as creepy.
gayyoungold,2oj8rk,RustyGuns,2,Sun Dec 7 12:58:08 2014 UTC,"So true.  In the tweens it was and is incomprehensible that aging would ever occur.  When someone starts expressing that concept I remind them that there was a time when they could easily stick a toe in their mouth or shit in their pants and not worry about it.  It's all about maturing and aging; it is happening and will continue 'til death.  By the age of 20 we were all told about the things that would lead to health issues; smoking, diet, lack of exercise, etc............But, the warnings were ignored for the most part.  If one is worried about the ""creeps"" or ""trolls"" right now, just wait; your turn is coming.  I confess to having a great appreciation for younger men, and if I say the wrong thing, I do hereby apologize:-)"
gayyoungold,2oj8rk,RustyGuns,2,Sun Dec 7 13:52:47 2014 UTC,"Thank you, I appreciate it kind man. Why can't more people be like you?"
gayyoungold,2oj8rk,RustyGuns,1 point,Sun Dec 7 14:22:02 2014 UTC,"It's funny that you mention this, because aging does eventually come and some will always try to run away from it. I have a friend who is 53 and he still feels his looks are the only thing that matters about him. I feel so bad because eventually those will go and he will have to accept the reality of getting older. :("

gayyoungold,2oj8rk,GerontoMan,1 point,Mon Dec 8 03:35:02 2014 UTC,"I'm going to go on a short rant about it :)  So yea, honestly it really is sad. He will do stuff like get super self conscious before we go to the bar because he feels that he needs to look better. He will go through 5+ different shirts etc etc. While we are at the bar he gets upset when no one comes up to him. He expects everyone around him to do all the work.   When he was younger he was hot shit, super muscular, masculine, and had an amazing face. This made him the Center of attention whenever he would go out. That is now fading and he knows it. The sad thing is that he doesn't know how to adjust. He is so self-entered that he as I mentioned expects guys to always come up to him. Even when he is in a relationship he expects them to do all the work. He acts like a spoiled child who wants the cake and wants to eat it as well.   He can't take any criticism from anyone without him feeling like it is a personal attack because of how self conscious he is. This causes everyone to censor themselves around him. And makes people avoid his company.   I wish he would learn to be a better person and accept the whole getting older concept. But I feel he will never change. It will be really sad when he is in his 70s."
gayyoungold,2oj8rk,samuel33334,1 point,Tue Dec 9 21:33:11 2014 UTC,"It annoys me because a lot of these men never will change for the best. The youth has made older men sound like demons. People tell me not to date online because only old creepy men do that. They tell me no to date older men because they're all creepy. They claim that older men are unwanted because they're all ugly and creepy.   I know that if I was an older man and after hearing all of this negativity I would feel pressured to keep up with looks because that's all that people care about now. I can only imagine so many older men are lonely because all of the young people can nonchalantly bash on them without realizing how much it can hurt them. It truly makes me sad when an older man admits that he's lonely and just wants to find someone to be with. So many of these men become distorted in a bad way just so that they can appease all of the people that bash on them. They finally feel accepted for the wrong reasons.   I can only help but appreciate older men. For I know, that my looks won't last forever and I'll be their age one day."
gayyoungold,2oj8rk,SylmarByNight,1 point,Tue Dec 9 21:50:43 2014 UTC,"This isn't really the case at all. He isn't pressured because of how he thinks younger guys perceive him. It is much deeper than that. Also younger guys who like older men generally are looking for the mature look. Again, it has nothing to do with how younger guys look at him."
gayyoungold,2oj8rk,samuel33334,3,Tue Dec 9 22:27:49 2014 UTC,I always feel bad when friends of mine make fun of anyone that's old because one day we'll look the same. They just can't admire how handsome older men are. 😳
gayyoungold,2oj8rk,mick_dog,3,Sun Dec 7 14:25:25 2014 UTC,"Youth-obsessed culture.  That's probably also why people have so much trouble dealing with death - they push it all down the road.  ""Oh, that's a long ways off, I have my whole life ahead of me, I'm young and free and HE'S GOT A GUN"""
gayyoungold,2oj8rk,GerontoMan,2,Mon Dec 8 03:24:02 2014 UTC,"I agree. I definitely think society has a strange obsession with youth. I don't think this is necessarily a new thing but I think the symptoms of it are. Maybe it's just a human, fear of the unknown sort of thing.   In mainstream LGBT culture, it can be pretty bad. I guess we're something of the foil for that.   To aging with grace!"

gayyoungold,2oie18,YoungCuban,18,Sun Dec 7 01:28:14 2014 UTC,"That's a terribly seedy and trashy first date, it's no wonder you felt uncomfortable. From the location of the date to the way he acted is just off-putting. It sorta pisses me off that he would even find this as appropriate for an initial meeting.  This guy just wants to fuck. If you want something more meaningful I'd look elsewhere. It seems like you enjoy the physical parts of it but you can really find that anywhere and probably in a more private setting. Your first time should definitely be somewhere you're comfortable and where you can take your time."
gayyoungold,2oie18,youyouyuyu,2,Sun Dec 7 01:49:32 2014 UTC,"I don't have a huge problem with harmless sluttiness like grinding and groping if both people are into it, but taking a guy (who seems to be into older guys, not gogo dancers) to a strip club is a huge turn off. The insult is another red flag that this guy is shallow and not worth OP's time.  If you want an casual thing with this guy than go for it, but from what you've said in your post I think you should back off."
gayyoungold,2oie18,Robolabo,7,Sun Dec 7 22:29:23 2014 UTC,"Yeah, trashy first date.  He just wanted sex.  If I have real feelings for a young man, and I almost always do, I invite him to have dinner, a movie, a drive, hiking.....................If he wants sex he's going to have to let me know, and I'm not going the strip club route or groping him on the dance floor."
gayyoungold,2oie18,waha501,3,Sun Dec 7 02:12:43 2014 UTC,"Ditto to others said, trashy first date and looking for sex.   My advice, you dictate the terms of the next date, if you are so inclined to do so. If he wants something more than sex, he will show."
gayyoungold,2oie18,ChopstickAKAJames,2,Sun Dec 7 03:58:13 2014 UTC,"If you feel as though you're both compatible then keep chatting with him. Next time you meet up though, maybe meet up at a place that you're more comfortable with. Also, since you just started dating. If you feel uncomfortable at any time then just explain that to your date. He should understand."
gayyoungold,2oh4hn,Daddyadvice,3,Sat Dec 6 18:03:11 2014 UTC,"My take is that he may be interested in something more since he said you can just stop by anytime, but it could also mean he trusts you as a friend and wants you to feel welcomed in his home.  Try seeing if he'd like to do more then just hangout and have great sex.   Ask if he might be interested in going out for a bite to eat or some other activity with you. You both could visit a museum, walk in the park, catch a movie, or see a show.  Not sure what each of your interests are but if you want to test the waters find something for you both to do and ask if he'd like to join you."

gayyoungold,2o8q65,fbimale,11,Thu Dec 4 07:40:34 2014 UTC,There's no need to be ashamed as long as you're both consenting and in legal age. Nothing more to worry about.  But use a condom and get yourself checked. HIV and other nasties are still around.
gayyoungold,2o8q65,nightlily,6,Thu Dec 4 07:47:33 2014 UTC,"This is who you are and it's nothing to be ashamed of.   You say you're trapped by desire, but from here you sound trapped by an upbringing that denies what is natural for you. Its hard to fight that nature as you've discovered. So, don't. Just accept it."
gayyoungold,2o8q65,Whitedragon2,2,Thu Dec 4 07:59:55 2014 UTC,"Poor guy, you shouldn't feel that way just because you are enjoying yourself.  I mean do be safe, use a condom and get tested, but don't hate yourself for doing this.  That desire is strong likely because you kept it pressed down for so long by your up bring.  I'd keep having fun for awhile if I was you.  Maybe this is something you should explore a little more.  Sounds like you like it a little rough, but if at anytime it becomes painful or uncomfortable be sure to speak up.  You shouldn't suffer for some else's pleasure."

I'm not sure what I could get him, but he's kind of geeky so I was thinking maybe something like a nice mechanical keyboard or something Star Trek related (but I haven't watched enough Star Trek to know what I could get him...).  Grr somebody help."
gayyoungold,2o77hc,pattch,2,Thu Dec 4 05:38:36 2014 UTC,You could always try buying a gift from him from  ThinkGeek  They have tons of interesting science/geek things. I haven't really watched Star Trek either but they have plenty of Star Trek related items. Hope that helps out a bit. :)
gayyoungold,2o3zsh,Twinkiezy,7,Wed Dec 3 02:00:12 2014 UTC,"And I'm not sure why they picked me   You weren't picked.  It just happened.  And since it just happened, going with the flow is the best course of action.    Don't assume that Chris and Ryan are under some sort of illusion, they are probably completely aware that you are exactly who you are - a young guy who could probably use some help getting his feet on the ground after getting evicted.  Be yourself, be open to new experiences, and most importantly, accept that youthfulness and excellent coffee-making are just fine when it comes to positive attributes.  Especially when you are trying to be a good person overall.  Don't overthink this.  Your 'triangle' may not last forever, but it could be a very good experience overall if you just look at it as a blended family instead of a relationship.  You deserve every good thing that happens to you."
gayyoungold,2o3zsh,pizzaforce3,3,Wed Dec 3 08:19:49 2014 UTC,"Aww, thanks for your response and kind words. I really am overthinking things, aren't I? I'm afraid it's a bad habit of mine. I believe you made an extremely valid point in saying that I could consider the relationship as more of a blended family. I never considered the possibility of having another family again, or that I could make one of my own accord."

gayyoungold,2o3zsh,youyouyuyu,1 point,Wed Dec 3 14:14:52 2014 UTC,"I'm worried when the point comes and they realize I'm a real person and not a schoolboy or a puppy that the illusion will be broken and things will change. The novelty of my existence in their world might wear off. I know that's a bit overly dramatic, but I don't have anything to offer aside from my youth and excellent coffee making skills and they're up in here with like masters degrees in mathematics and accounting and a combined 6 figure salary. I try to do everything in my power to be a good person to be with but I'm no confident that will be enough. And I'm not sure why they picked me. Chris told me he loved me last night while we were having sex and I couldn't even respond to him and I am such an asshole. He didn't even seem phased or care that I didn't like say anything. He said he just wanted me to know? And this isn't making a lot of sense, so I think I'll just leave it at that. I'm not entirely sure why I'm telling the internet this to be honest.   They are well aware of your situation, whether it's an illusion or actual feelings I don't think anyone outside of it can say.   This is really a conversation you should have with them. Are you even comfortable in a relationship such as this?"
gayyoungold,2o3zsh,youyouyuyu,1 point,Wed Dec 3 03:49:28 2014 UTC,"I have had this conversation with them several times, or at least renditions of it. They seem perfectly comfortable and understanding of my concerns, but I feel as though they kind of nullify any input I have by saying something along the lines of 'you're so cute when you're flustered' or otherwise alluding to the way I appear when I'm trying to eke out the right words.  I'm actually pretty happy where I'm at right now. It just feels a bit... dishonest? I'm struggling not feeling very strongly for Chris while he's grown extremely attached to me in a short period of time. I can't make myself love him more or faster and he know that I think.I guess it's more of a thing where I get things from each of them that I can't get from the other alone, which I think is the point of it all.... But it's the underlying thing in that they don't seem interested in fooling around with eachother. Just me, and in turn usually-- Which I find really weird.  So, to answer your question, I suppose I am comfortable with the idea, but I'm a little.... neurotic? about everything that's going on."
gayyoungold,2o3zsh,youyouyuyu,1 point,Wed Dec 3 04:15:06 2014 UTC,"Well really, pushing you off that way is extremely disrespectful and I see where you're getting the idea that they are sort of illusioned. Unfortunately there are some men who will use you for your youth; although I don't think this is exactly that.  I would honestly feel uncomfortable if I were you but I'm not sure if it's because of the number of people in the relationship, how they are sort of making it two separate relationships within one, or simply the fact that you aren't really connecting with either of them fully. I guess I'm a bit turned off by the fact that this sort of just happened to come together (seemingly behind your back) and Chris has spilled the love word so quickly."
gayyoungold,2o3zsh,samuel33334,3,Wed Dec 3 05:09:57 2014 UTC,"Well, I did give the super abbreviated version of things. The whole development of us three in a relationship was happening from pretty much day one, it was just never outright stated and I am really, really, really oblivious to a lot more stuff than I try to let on. To give a better idea, Chris and Ryan are like two sides of the same person. They're pretty much inseparable. I noticed that Chris would come over nearly every day, or at least five out of the seven, just to shoot the shit with Ryan and he would always acknowledge me, but insisted on calling me by a name that's not mine (My name is Svien. He cannot pronounce it; so I've been Scott, Brian, Andrew, Seth, ect). I thought he was just doing it to my annoyment and because I'm too polite to correct him. I was also raised not to correct adults, so if my name was 'Seven' or Sebbin' I just smile and go with it. Turned out he was trying to get me to open up (and stand up for myself, which I never did). He also pushed for a lot of time with me to hang out and get to know eachother, which Ryan strongly encouraged by saying ""You should see what Chris is up to tonight"" or (when Ryan left on a business trip) stating that I could ""stay the night"" with Chris ans ""see if he needs help"". I totally didn't get it. But Chris was remodeling the master bathroom, so I did help him do a ton of that. I am never laying tile ever again. It was just a weird progression because it like never escalated. I thought Ryan just wanted me to be friends with his best friend, so of course I made a concerted effort to do so. Chris finally broke it to me after a month :(."
gayyoungold,2o3zsh,Orvil_Pym,2,Wed Dec 3 18:39:31 2014 UTC,"Makes more sense and feels more organic now that you've explained it. I still get the feeling that you'll continue to struggle with the fact that you aren't ""100%"" with either of them. While it's not for me personally, it's not a bad thing--and it's good to see other people posting very positive things in this thread.  As I noted before I don't think these guys are exactly using you or whatever but I think it's important to keep in mind that you are young and in a vulnerable position. Don't let it poison the well or anything but look after yourself as much as you can. If you're uncomfortable with anything then tell them."
gayyoungold,2o3zsh,Orvil_Pym,0,Wed Dec 3 19:03:02 2014 UTC,"This doesn't seem right, I'm an 18 year old guy and I like guys who are 40+ and I wouldn't want to be in a situation like that at all. I would get out and try to be more independent for awhile or move back with you parents man. This doesn't seem healthy for you from my perspective and could possibly ruin a lot of things in your future and stunt some growth that you should be having at your age. I'd say that they know your dependent on them and that they can take advantage of you and I'd be wary of their true intentions. I know how you feel about a guy saying he loves you and not knowing what to say I have been chatting with this guy on growlr and he won't even send me a face pic or anything and we have talked a lot and he told me he loved me and it was very confusing for me so I just said it back because I didn't want to hurt him. You shouldn't worry about how they feel. Your a young guy and still figuring out what you want and I'm in a similar boat but this guy most likely isn't your soul mate or the person you want to spend the rest of your life with especially if your not compatible sexually and need a third. I know it may sound selfish but you need to do what is best for you Bud an what will make you feel good and something that won't stunt your development as a person. You need to reconcile with your parents if you can and get back under their wing. You don't have anyone to talk to besides these guys and they likely don't want what's best for you they want what they want and you should want what you want and not care how they feel. You need to figure things out and maybe stay with a close friend for awhile who your not sexually involved with. It's to early in your life to be tied down like this man. I hope this helps you and you get out of this situation because it doesn't seem healthy and If its your first relationship it could sour you to having a boyfriend again if it doesn't go well. I think you should try to find somewhere else to stay at least. Are you still in school?"
gayyoungold,2o3zsh,Orvil_Pym,1 point,Wed Dec 3 05:04:02 2014 UTC,"I don't have the option of going back to my parents. They aren't currently acknowledging my existence at the moment. It's a really messed up situation. We had just moved from Nebraska to Illinois about two months before we had our falling out. They had suspected I was at leas 'queer', as they put it, for awhile before they outright found out and refused to help me pay for university in late July (about 3 weeks before I was due to start). Unfortunately, they make enough money that I didn't qualify for any grants and my scholarships wouldn't cover nearly enough. Since they also wouldn't cosign a loan and none of my other immediate family is really in a good position, I lost out on that. I took the money I did save up from working last year and I'm putting it towards community college for the Spring 2015 semester. Hoping to get a fresh start. I don't really have any friends here and haven't really developed any long-term friendships since I've moved states every ~16 months for my dad's job since I was in middle school. I do work full time though, so that's a plus.  I'm not really sure what to make of life at the moment. I mean, I really couldn't ask for the nicer pair of guys. They're fantastic, really. It's just that I'm fairly positive I'm not even emotionally capable of reconciling my feelings for them. They don't seem to have many expectations, which really makes me paranoid. It shouldn't, but it does. I can't deal with someone loving me when I don't understand why I'm lovable to them in a non-superficial way."
gayyoungold,2o3zsh,samuel33334,1 point,Wed Dec 3 05:17:31 2014 UTC,"I can't deal with someone loving me when I don't understand why I'm lovable to them in a non-superficial way.   I can see why the situation concerns you. It's certainly somewhat unusual, that sort of threesome. But could it be that given your family experience (not just now, but all your life) taught you that love is always conditional? That you always have to earn it? That it comes with a price? And that you're therefore asking yourself ""what price am I paying here?""  It's something I had to struggle with all my life. The question ""Why would he/she love me?"" Basically: Where's the scam?  I cannot guarantee you that there isn't some (emotional) scam. But I urge you to ask yourself honestly if your suspicion may not be caused more by the expectations trained into you by your family than in the current situation.  If you like these guys, if you enjoy your time with them, if they allow you to find your feet and set out to rebuild your life, allow you to reestablish your independence, well, maybe just take it for now?  As long as you're honest about what you're willing to do and don't change yourself in an uncomfortable manner to suit their expectations - an nothing you wrote suggests so far that that's the case - just enjoy that you found them.  I'm sure nobody is planning for the next decade."

gayyoungold,2nhfxp,kmadfresh,4,Wed Nov 26 15:28:06 2014 UTC,"if you haven't already, talk through everything with your guy. then together, find help for your addiction. if you have to, get into a treatment center.  as for the DUI, get a lawyer and see what can be done about it. obviously a lawyer is going to cost you money, but it will be better for you in the long-run.  finally, i hate to say it but you are going to be in your situation for a while. if it's truly an addiction, that means you need to be aware and work at controlling it for the rest of your life. the financial situation and other stuff will also take time and work to take care. there are no quick solutions, but if you have learned from this situation and don't repeat it, then there is a lot of value in it."
gayyoungold,2nhfxp,PirateCodingMonkey,3,Wed Nov 26 19:25:38 2014 UTC,"My advice would be to seek professional help and to keep communicating with your hubby about what it is you are going through.   I don't know you, but from what you have posted I can only assume that you are feeling overwhelmed. There are so many things going on in your life right now, things you can fight by yourself, but help from your partner might make things easier to deal with / tackle.  Try to always treat your partner right, despite of all the problems you have, and you both can get through this."
gayyoungold,2nhfxp,blatiebla,3,Wed Nov 26 15:44:12 2014 UTC,You mentioned you gave him your card so you couldn't use it anymore. Is his reasoning for taking your name off the bank account solely to limit your addiction? I guess it points to him not trusting you but have you had a conversation about it?
gayyoungold,2nhfxp,youyouyuyu,1 point,Wed Nov 26 16:31:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah that kind of hits close to home to me. I'm suffering mental illness agoraphobia, autism which can be similar to addiction in a few ways.  I kind of got stuck with my friend, I have support from my family but it's very shaky.  I don't know what to call my relationship with my friend, thats' where a lot of the emotional problems might be coming from. The feeling of being stuck in your life in general is bad, not so good relationships is even worse. But, your situation is slightly better. You are able to get professional help and there's a lot of help for people with addictions that is much more straight forward. I wish I could give you more advice on how to get that help specifically. You need to know how to reach out and what supports are available and I don't know enough to help you, but maybe this post will help you find the next answers."
gayyoungold,2nhfxp,sub_woofer,1 point,Thu Nov 27 04:06:56 2014 UTC,"Have you told your friend you feel stuck?  It kinda sounds like you're using ""stuck"" as a nicer word for ""trapped"".  I've helped others that were pretty much stuck and it sucks until they get back on their feet. I have them pick a direction and we'll work together to get there. Your illness makes staying focused on a direction more of a challenge, so regularly talking about the state of the situation and just acknowledging that it's unbalanced and unfair can help ease the stress.  It's OK to not have a good solution -- nobody has to supply the right answer. Just agreeing that the situation isn't ideal can help."

gayyoungold,2nhfxp,Dustin_00,1 point,Mon Dec 1 16:51:06 2014 UTC,"I don't see the age difference being an issue here.  It sounds like he's taking steps to protect himself from you and you should recognize that is a good thing as that will enable him to stand by you longer, giving you more time to search for the solutions you need.  At no point do you express concern/regret over your addiction or interest in getting over it. Most likely he isn't prepared to help you with that, so you both need help in figuring out how to get you out of this hole. Most people that recover have to go through a number of AA groups before they find the one they click with; you'll only find the right one if you start attending them.  After you can stabilize yourself, then you can look at repairing your relationships (with him and your family), but for now focus on getting yourself well."

gayyoungold,2nhfxp,waha501,1 point,Thu Nov 27 18:41:44 2014 UTC,"All of the advice here seems good.  I'm suspecting that your partner took your name off the account to keep you from draining it, and that your family turned their back on you because of your behavior,  not necessarily your older partner.  You can make things right, but it will take time and it's all a matter of your willpower.  Addictions never really go away; you just learn to stop it controlling you.  Focus on getting right, and you KNOW what that means, I don't have to explain it to you.  It sounds like you have a partner who cares and you're lucky.  As corny as it sounds: ""One fucking day at a time""."
gayyoungold,2nhfxp,RustyPeach,-1,Thu Nov 27 12:50:40 2014 UTC,"No, I havent been in the same situation. You moved too fast. 2 years and you were already financially dependent on him? Thats not what a relationship is. Especially when you are only a freshman in college. He is just as much to blame, trying to share everything with you to help keep you with him.   My advice, get out, finish school. If you want to be with him fine, set yourself some limits. Dont depend on him financially, get a job and support yourself. Especially when you have an addiction. How is it fair to this guy that your blowing all your money on your addiction then he is supplementing the rest for you? Grow up, if you want to be in a relationship and have it be respectful to both parties, you need to be more mature.   As for the family, if they dont want you in their lives, you dont need to be. It sucks, its something we all struggle with. It took me 3 years to feel comfortable telling my mom about it, when i was sure i wouldnt need to depend on her. Its sucky to think about, but there are merits to staying in the dark about certain topics. Best option is to just get over your addiction, go to therapy for your depression (its the only way). Most universities will offer assistance in that department, whether it be free or reduced. Talk to somebody. And then try to re-establish contact with your family, if they still dont want to listen to you, then you dont need them. But you need to be in a clear mind-body to have a good conversation with them."
gayyoungold,2nhfxp,sub_woofer,2,Wed Nov 26 15:43:22 2014 UTC,"Well I fell hard, we didnt have this dependence at the beginning. I was working but school has become tough.

So, as someone who's (sort of) been on the opposite side of your situation, this is what I think: you should leave him.  People with mental illness can be incredibly selfish. And most of the time, it's not their fault. But they need to realize that and work on getting better, and not expect other people to just deal with it. Before I met my boyfriend, I was on the brink. I was smoking, drinking, and didn't care about life or anyone else. But after we started dating, I realized I couldn't do to him what I was doing to everyone else. I was scared to push him away, to snap at him and lose him. I already was going to therapy and taking meds, but not really caring about getting better. Then, I actually wanted to. Bottom line is, I was trying to get better. I'm not 100% better, but I am better than I was. I don't believe there's a cure for my issues, but they are manageable now. I can be bitter, angry and cranky when I get up in the morning, but at least I'm getting up. And sometimes after I have coffee with him, he talks me out of it and I feel a little better. Sometimes it doesn't work. But at least there's no drastic mood swings anymore, I'm not yelling at him, pushing him away, and using chemicals to make me feel better. Of course there are things you should put up with, be there for him and offer support, but your boyfriend needs to grow up and actually deal with his illness and issues, for his sake and yours, and not expect you to just deal with it. He's being selfish.  About the house: another incredibly selfish act. He bought a house without even talking to you about it first. Thus, he completely disregarded your feelings about the house, the location, or how you even felt about moving. He expected you, again, to just deal with it and move along with him, not caring about how you feel at all. He bought that house, he made that commitment, not you. You don't owe him anything. He, on the other hand, after six years, owed you at least a goddamn conversation about taking such a big step. When he bought that house and didn't talk to you first, he took the risk of losing you by doing so. He bought it for himself. Not for the two of you.  Now, this is a stretch because I don't know this man, you, or your relationship.. but it sounds to me like he's being a manipulative ass. He bought the house when he knew you disliked the location, hoping you would move in with him anyway. And when you didn't, he says he regrets it and that you were right to make you feel bad and move in with him anyways. I might be wrong, but as you say, there are more issues, and you broke up twice. He's almost 50 fucking years old and been with you for six years. He's a goddamn adult and should act like one. He is not a child and knew exactly what he was doing.  You have your own problems. Your own life, bills, and feelings to take care of. He didn't care about that. All he cared about was himself. This may be hard to realize, because you really seem to love and have deep affection for this man, but he's being a dick. And I think you're realizing it now. You made the right decision by not moving in with him.  So, I think you should leave him. Being with him will only cause great turmoil in your life. You'll be in a relationship with a man that does not seem to care for you as much as you do him, in a home that you hate (that house will always remind you of the things he did and you'll just end up resenting him greatly), in a place that you hate, with no prospect of the lifestyle that you want, or a job, with his mom and having two student loans to pay off. Sounds like a lot of cons to me. And, to reiterate, he did this to you. After six years, he should be more considerate to you than that.  Now, if you really don't want to leave him (which I strongly advise you do) here's what you need, at least: a break. Go to his place, and have a long, deep conversation about everything that has happened. Tell him you're insulted, hurt, and feel left out by the things he did, and that you need a break. A year long break. Tell him that he needs to go to therapy, deal with his depression, get his life straight, reflect on how he hurt you by all the things that he did, and really want to change if he wants to be with you. Then you have a year free to decide what you want as well. Pay your loans, reflect on the relationship, see if you really want to go back to him and if it's really worth dealing with everything to try again, for the third time.  I really think after six years and two breakups, it's lost. You're better off without him. You shouldn't need to deal with all that crap to be in a relationship. You seem to be the one putting all the effort into maintaining it. You deserve someone better, someone that actually loves you, and wouldn't put you through all that.  But then again, it's your call. Whatever you do, I wish you good luck."
gayyoungold,2n5fln,Kaique94,1 point,Sun Nov 23 18:15:38 2014 UTC,"I agree with you in your outlook on it, its just difficult to follow through. Part of my issue is that I have grown to be sort of co-dependent in the respect that I crave that love and affection.  I have always been a very independent person. I moved out of my house at 17 and have worked very hard to get an education and exist in an area where most have my friends have left because of cost of living expenses.   I look at this draw to him as a sign almost. I haven't been this attached to anyone and I worry that I may not find this type of relationship again if I do end things. When things are good, they're great-- When they are not, im miserable. I almost feel like an abused spouse in some ways. I see the problems, ive had the discussions, things dont change but I still love him."
gayyoungold,2n5fln,Kaique94,1 point,Sun Nov 23 18:46:23 2014 UTC,"To be honest, you kind of are being abused. Like I said, you seem to be the one putting all the effort into maintaining this relationship, he doesn't do anything to change and while still miserable, you still love him. That's not a healthy way to be in a relationship. He should be willing to change a little in order to make you happy, if he truly loves you. He's not respecting you at all, not like a spouse, lover, or even friend would. He seems to be just dragging you around for his emotional and sexual needs.  It can be really difficult, but you can find someone else. Someone that will truly love you, respect you, and show you a better kind of relationship and love. This man isn't willing to give you that. Try and put yourself out there, you don't even need to go straight to start dating. Make new friends, new relationships. Once you're over and ready to move on, you can start dating - and who knows? Maybe you find someone already along the way!  Remember, the only way out is through. You can get through this. And in the end, things can only get better.  Best wishes. :)"

It's been a few months, and I'm with someone absolutely wonderful now.  While I'm not guaranteeing that's going to happen to you, you can't find anyone better when you're still with him."
gayyoungold,2n5fln,samuel33334,1 point,Tue Nov 25 19:13:20 2014 UTC,That really sucks dude. I'm 18 an have no perspective on any of this for I don't have a job or pay my own bills or do I have a boyfriend. But I would say that he made his bed and if you don't like the way he did then you don't have to lay in it. And fuck livin with his mom what the fuck is up with so many older gay guys living with their mom. I've encountered a lot and this is anecdotal I know but Jesus I would never subject myself to that. Your bf sounds a lot like my mom actually lol. I feel that you should probably move on and try to find someone new. It probably sounds hard to hear but you probably shouldn't tie yourself to that wagon. It seems like you don't get as much as he does from the relationship and it seems like your being used as a punching bag of sorts to so it also sounds somewhat abusive. Also there clearly isn't much communication from his end and your communicating so you say so I would break it off because he sounds immature and impulsive which are two qualities someone like me should have and not someone in his position.
gayyoungold,2n5fln,youyouyuyu,1 point,Sun Nov 23 07:37:17 2014 UTC,"Pretty big issues here, but I think the biggest one is caused by his decision to move on a house without discussing it with you.   To me, it seems like he was being greatly influenced by his mother on this decision. This doesn't make it any better but it does complicate things. Obviously I don't know their family situation but if it is anything like mine the expectation as a son goes far beyond the usual American convention, whether it be cultural or other reasons. Maybe he was trying to appease his mother without really thinking it through?   That said, it's completely understandable to feel the way you do. There is no excuse for him to leave you out of a life event such as purchasing a house, especially when there are so many factors involved. This is probably hard to do, but don't let the feelings of betrayal turn into anger as you've noted that he does regret his decisions.  Would it be best if you went separate ways? Yes. But you don't really have to. These issues are big enough to cause problems and end any relationship but from what you've said, you both still feel really strongly for each other, which is ultimately the reason to be in a relationship.   The first step would be getting past feeling insulted by his actions. You won't be able to compromise on a living situation (which sounds like its going to be a lot on you) while on a negative path. Which leads to the second step of finding a happy medium: Where are you living now? How often are you seeing each other? How is the interaction when all these problems aren't at the bubbling surface? You mention not liking the area, why? Etc.  Step three is all him. He needs to involve you in everything from here on out to avoid getting into shit like this and, more importantly, actually make you feel like you're a significant portion of his life. I might sound like I'm making excuses for him and that I'm on his side but I'm just a halfway Devil's advocate. He's done a lot wrong and/but they are pretty permanent wrongs from what you've said.  That's a LOT to figure out. Is it worth it? Only you can decide that.  P.S. - If you really care for him like it sounds like you do, help him with his depression--don't leave him for it. It might be a hard battle for you but trust me when I say that it is hell for him and he needs your support.  Tldr; Your feelings are justified. Relationship still salvageable IMO, if it's worth it to you."
gayyoungold,2n5fln,atwthepig,1 point,Sun Nov 23 12:43:20 2014 UTC,"My first boyfriend was 43 ( I was 22) He was a lazy dreamer that had all of these awesome ideas, but never put 2 & 2 together. Eventually I started stepping out on him and eventually left him after he continuously called me."" The trick that never left."" All in all, I guess what happened was, I was too old for him,"" After we broke up he called me because his 18 year old twink hook-up was having a seizure and I was an EMT.)   With that out of the way I 'm going to the points.  . With him having major depression, you have too make sure that you are mentally prepared for that. Can you be there for him when he is experiencing the highs and lows.  Is he actually doing everything he can to not be a task on you ( including, still being helpful around the house, staying on schedule with medications, TAKING medication). Is he willing to go to therapy to get a handle on it.  The biggest thing, snapping at you because of the depression is NOT acceptable. If he loves you and cares for you, then he will do everything in his power to make sure he quells that.    I know that were i to commit to a life long relationship with him that this is one of those issues I would not be able to change. The question is -- can I live with this?   Yes, you can live with this, but why should you?  If he gets upset, takes it out on you, then comes to you, apologizes, recognizes why he does it, then repeats it, It's abuse and you are in an abusive relationship.  . I hate to be blunt about this last point, but he doesn't want a life with you. by buying a house, without your input, literally buying a house with his mother, in a town you don't want to move to and allowing her to move, is a strong sign that he doesn't want you in his life or in his house.  Also, if he truly can't afford a house and he bought it anyway, why would you want to hitch your wagon to a financially unstable middle aged man?  The reason I brought up my relationship earlier was because I was in the same boat as you. my boyfriend used excuses to verbally abuse me everyday;""The trick that never left"", was the mildest. I made many excuses ranging from his depression, to stress,yadda yadda. at the end of the day, it was abuse, I was being abused and him using his depression as an excuse is abuse.  Later,  he started to do things with out me. we talked about buying a house, he bought one with one of his friends, no discussion of me moving in. he took vacations without me. one time I came home from work to find out him, his friend he eventually bought the house with, and his friends boyfriend went to Chicago for 3 days. those are the tip of the iceberg.  Think about what you want from this relationship, then ask yourself if he is willing to provide it, then ask yourself,"" If he's not willing to provide it, can I live without it?"""

This is a guy who makes bad decisions - one after another : he doesn't even factor your 'sensible perspective' into the equation.  For me, I would have seen enough.  It might be time for you to move on ( but certainly not to his house and mommy)."
gayyoungold,2n5fln,Whitedragon2,1 point,Mon Nov 24 14:55:03 2014 UTC,"As much as you care about him and are open with him, I don't think you are ever going to get a real loving relationship from him until he gets some help.  If he is not willing to get help the help he needs because of how he has hurt you, then I think its best to move on.  You seem like a nice guy who made some reasonable requests to a loved who didn't respect them.  You tired so much to help him make better choices for the house and he didn't listen and now regrets it.  You were so nice to him helping him get out and live even when he venomously assaulted you with his words, which he also regrets.  But even with his regrets he doesn't seem to want to change or get better.  When you love someone, truly and deeply, you love everything about them; even their imperfections or flaws.  This guys doesn't seem willing to change and you have expressed a desire for him to because of how it effects you.  By that I would conclude that you will deal with these issues for the rest of your life with him.  If you can't see yourself loving him through all that forever, then it might be time to break things off.  You could still try to be friends if you still care about him.  But don't confuse friendship and relationship.  You need a better guy who will treat you better and who you will love everything about.  Granted your situation seems more complicated then one post so I'm only judging by what I have read here.  You have spent 6 years with this guy so you both have been through a lot.  But it sounds like you will go through much more heartache if he keeps acting the way he is and not seeking the help he needs."
gayyoungold,2n56a4,malwin10,16,Sun Nov 23 05:09:23 2014 UTC,"Definitely don't have sex with him and then break up with him. That's fucked up. I'm not saying you shouldn't break it off with your boyfriend but don't fuck him right before doing so. It creates confusion for both you and him. Sorry if my post sounded harsh/terse. I meant to edit it right after but went out to dinner.  Good luck!  Make sure to post again later to let us know how you're doing.   You're going to have to do your own thing in relationships. I'm a pretty strong believer in that people only learn many of these things by personal experience. That said, I strongly advise against having sex so soon before or after a breakup. It tends to seriously complicate things."

We cuddled on the couch for a bit and he wanted to head to the bedroom but I said there's something we need to talk about. Said the long distance relationship is difficult and so is keeping a relationship when I have to focus on school and work. We talked it out, he teared up a bit, and after a bit of talking we decided to turn it into an open relationship. At least until we can see each other again in around 4 months or so. Went a lot better than I expected."

gayyoungold,2n3w0y,truck999,4,Sat Nov 22 20:43:51 2014 UTC,"Don't take this as gospel, but you are 17. You are very young. You should ask your boyfriend how he would feel if one of his kids disappeared and wouldn't tell them where they are. It might feel like you're right on the border of that independence but your parents are always going to worry about you, even after you turn 18.  I think you need to figure out how you can be at least a little more honest with your parents if you want to continue this. At least be able to tell them you have a boyfriend and that you trust him. If they ask his age tell them he is older and be honest in that you're afraid to say how old until you're ready to reveal that part.  Be honest doesn't mean telling them everything. Sometimes being honest is telling them when and why you feel you can't reveal everything. But hiding where you are should not be part of that."
gayyoungold,2n3w0y,kuroguma,2,Sat Nov 22 22:29:02 2014 UTC,"That is true, I think I probably over estimate my age, or like to think that I'm older than I really am, especially since the two of us have questioned on multiple occasions whether this relationship is actually 'right' in the sense that, he is 49 and in a relationship with a 17 year old and vice versa. It's right in the fact that we fucking love each other, but just socially, I don't think that it is going to be accepted or ever will be... oh well.  I understand that my parents will worry about me yes, it's just more that they were not satisfied with me just texting even though I was updating them as to where I was. I haven't even come out yet so that's something I should do soon, and then I guess that I will tell them that I have a boyfriend and am not confident enough to reveal his age for the time being. That was actually really good advice so thanks for that, I actually talked to him about it last night to him and he agreed that it was a good idea."

I have no friends in this other city unfortunately. If it wasn't so far away it wouldn't be too bad cause I could leave at 4pm, which is the time I leave the day after and be back home by 5-6ish, I end up being home 8pm every time cause it's such a long train journey. I just have to make up shitty excuses that I can just tell aren't going to last. If I had my own place he could stay here every other weekend but obviously I don't, and the only other option is to get a hotel here or in a city between the two of us.

Also, he may want others to see he is taking care of you properly (so don't be thinking you are going to steal this fine young thing away from me) since they can't see how well he treats you in the bedroom (things are good there, yes?).  Just don't plan any round the world trips or ask for a German car for christmas.

If you don't take on his hobbies and interests you can at least be curious about how he feels about them, even if only sometimes.  Sounds like you're both going through a lot to be with each other and it says a lot that you're both willing to. It seems to me like you care a great deal about each other. Are you sure you aren't getting these feelings because it is getting increasingly difficult to be with him?  At the end of the day if you're not happy with him then by all means have a discussion and move towards ending things, but I'm not getting the feeling you are dissatisfied with him by your post.  I think you should also keep in mind that he may also be holding back given your circumstances.

gayyoungold,2mv2ra,Suirou,5,Mon Dec 1 13:35:09 2014 UTC,Have you guys talked about your expectations for the relationship? Have you agreed to be monogamous?
gayyoungold,2mv2ra,WildlifeAnalysis,1 point,Thu Nov 20 20:24:42 2014 UTC,"I would expect a relationship to be monogamous unless explicitly stated otherwise, and he has not stated anything about being non-monogamous."
gayyoungold,2mv2ra,WildlifeAnalysis,4,Thu Nov 20 20:59:43 2014 UTC,I would talk to him about it. Couples should always make these things explicit with each other. Have you two at least agreed that you are indeed in a serious relationship?
gayyoungold,2mv2ra,2scompany,1 point,Thu Nov 20 21:03:00 2014 UTC,"Yes, it is definitely a serious relationship."
gayyoungold,2mv2ra,sub_woofer,3,Thu Nov 20 21:05:04 2014 UTC,A lot of guys are addicted to grindr etc. It might be innocent - but perhaps not.  The trouble with older guys is they have well ingrained habits that are hard to break. You guys need to state what each is prepared to put up with - and your requirements are just as important as his.
gayyoungold,2mv2ra,2scompany,1 point,Thu Nov 20 19:36:31 2014 UTC,"I have a hard time understanding innocently browsing a dating site... Even if you convince yourself that you're only doing it for fun, there's some lingering feeling that made you actually do it."
gayyoungold,2mv2ra,Suil_Amhain,2,Thu Nov 20 20:59:00 2014 UTC,"I had problems like this with the person I'm with now, although it's not a typical relationship. We're in the middle of nowhere so I believe  he was honestly just lonely and looking for friends. But he still ended up taking it down after I was talking to him about it since he said he was thinking about it anyways. I have a lot of jealousy issues and he tried to understand. You should try talking to your guy and try to work something out or come to some sort of understanding somehow."
gayyoungold,2mv2ra,Robolabo,1 point,Fri Nov 21 11:05:26 2014 UTC,"I don't disagree.  Some guys are incorrigible cruisers - because they have done that all their lives and may not be able to stop.  They are addicted - to the chase and to the rush of a 'hit'.  Not, perhaps the best monogamous 'husband' material.  But if that's the case its better to know now - and either adapt your expectations or draw a line in the sand."
gayyoungold,2mv2ra,Robolabo,1 point,Fri Nov 21 03:01:42 2014 UTC,I wouldn't get too worried about it two of my friends only chat via a similar app and aren't in the slightest interested in each other.
gayyoungold,2mv2ra,Flanaganm,1 point,Thu Nov 20 09:37:39 2014 UTC,I would assume it's probably chatting or innocent flirting. I don't think it would be a problem to ask him to set his status to something other than single.

gayyoungold,2mkia6,jyiannako,8,Mon Nov 17 16:18:33 2014 UTC,"That seriously sucks hon, I'm sorry to hear it. Only you can know what is best for you with this relationship   The one caution I have for you is to be wary of falling into the trap of desperately trying to make a relationship work even when things get unhealthy, because it's the kind of relationship you're looking for. Not saying that it's happening here, just that it's something I've personally struggled with. Make sure you base your decisions on you and him, not you and being with an older guy. Stay for the man, not the dynamic."
gayyoungold,2mkia6,wintertash,2,Mon Nov 17 17:30:48 2014 UTC,"yes I agree.  I'm not with him because he's older, but because I love him. I've been feeling that way because its still so raw, but I guess I'm gonna have to move on now"

gayyoungold,2lsgv2,PDXHusker,3,Tue Nov 11 00:22:45 2014 UTC,"I think the ""show off effect"" can be true for any relationship. There are just some people out there who date others to make themselves look better, not because they're actually into the person they're dating.  Or taking the old/young dating dynamic, I can turn your question around to wondering if some of the guys I've dated really liked me or were just interested in the idea of stability and financial support.  Trust your gut instinct. You'll know when a guy really likes you for who you are and is able (and willing) to meet your emotional needs in the relationship."
gayyoungold,2lsgv2,RustyGuns,1 point,Sun Nov 23 17:08:16 2014 UTC,"I agree with this, regardless of the age you will see the ""show off effect."" I do notice though that people assume that you are showing off your younger guy that you are with before seeing the actual depth of the relationship."
gayyoungold,2lsgv2,blatiebla,2,Mon Nov 10 06:13:29 2014 UTC,"I understand OP's question, I've noticed it with some previous dates/relationships as well. Some guys just date purely based on age / looks. Some guys kept messaging me when I was 18/19, and when I got older they lost interest.  Well typing this I noticed I'm a bit of a hypocrite... my dating profile states ""Looking for men aged 45+"", because experience learned me that that is what I like. HOWEVER: not purely because of the looks (I've dated really hot men of 35-40) but mostly because of the mindset that people of that age are in / the lifestyle.  So yeah, I feel the same way as you do, but I guess its understandable to some degree. It's what you like / are looking for and what gives you pleasaure.  You will notice it when you've found a guy that is interested in YOU, and not just your ... uhm... ass ;-). It might help a bit if you make it known in your hunting spree for hung hairy males that you're not just looking for a one night stand, but are looking for something serious."
gayyoungold,2lsgv2,republicoflove,2,Tue Nov 11 07:40:10 2014 UTC,It's complicated but you have to understand that your liking for older men causes exactly the same issue in reverse. I think we have a preference that we indulge whenever we can but then other factors kick in. The preference is the catalyst but chemistry is the glue (or not).
gayyoungold,2lsgv2,mick_dog,3,Mon Nov 10 16:50:13 2014 UTC,"it's dating. you'll be in public. if you want someone to get to know ""who you are"" you don't go to a restaurant or bar anyway. if you're insecure about being intimate with an older man in public, work that shit out in your own mind before blaming it on your date. (personally, i'd be way more pissed if someone was hesitant to be seen with me instead of relishing in being seen with me.)  find guys you like and like you back for substantial reasons. it works for old guys too, they're just like everyone else."
gayyoungold,2lsgv2,txholdup,3,Fri Nov 14 21:29:58 2014 UTC,"There are plenty of older guys out there who want a younger guy because it makes them seem younger, more attractive, more desirable and they lose interest the second past their bf's 23rd birthday.  And no doubt you are arm candy in a relationship with them so you aren't being paranoid, you are being perceptive."
gayyoungold,2lsgv2,505yawaworht,1 point,Sun Nov 9 22:03:28 2014 UTC,"Never felt ""shown off"". The guys are usually too self conscious about being creepy to really revel in any public glory that my youth might bring for them. (The creepy thing is a vocalised concern from many guys I've met)  I've definitely felt like guys only want to see me because I'm younger. Then I remember the only reason I want to see them is because they're older :P   Just get to know them better... prior to anything sexual, meeting for beers or coffee or at restaurants  and just shooting shit is probably your best bet to gauge whether or not this person likes you 4 you or 4 ur age."

I really had no idea why he had any interest in me or wanted to be around me irl. I do think you hit part of it on the head; getting shown off is a part of it, but it's kinda nice. I mean, he's saying he likes going out with you and being seen. He's at least confident about it and not hiding you away for one reason or another.  Have you tried talking to him to ask him about the issue? If he's cool, then it shouldn't be a problem. I had to have the same conversation myself because I was having crippling self-doubt and anxiety attacks that were being brought on by it (I've never had them prior). Things went well in my case and I got a lot of positive feedback to work off of. I hope the same would work in your case!"
gayyoungold,2lsgv2,paralapapa,1 point,Mon Nov 10 04:47:49 2014 UTC,"I, at the very beginning of my relation with my BF, was thinking that. I'm 29 years old, exercice quite often (during the summer, I try to get on my bike everyday, etc.), football player type of guy. He is 63 years old, he also exercices each day (gym + bike).  I was wondering if he was with me for the ""look at what I can have in bed"" effect.. but, after talking with him, I realised it was ALOT more than that.  But, let's be honest, at some point, we all do that. We want to ""show off"" our bf, to let the world know that we love him and that we find him really attractive.. I know I do."
gayyoungold,2lsgv2,waha501,1 point,Tue Nov 11 04:48:59 2014 UTC,"My passion for younger men extends over several decades.  Initially, I'm attracted by their age and physical appearance; generally, I'm put off by facial hair, overweight or smokers.  That said, once/if we develop a mutual attraction I stick with them even if/when they age or grow facial hair.  Interestingly, the attraction wains if he gets fat and sloppy.  I will always be courteous and loyal with the weight gain, but the passion looses intensity.   I think this kind of thinking and feeling varies widely, but for me, getting older doesn't mean we would ""age out"" of the relationship. Lying, cheating and stealing, along with drugs are a quick relationship-killer, but everyone is probably different."

gayyoungold,2lf9e0,RustyGuns,2,Thu Nov 6 03:13:05 2014 UTC,"That was really hard to read. In all honesty there is a general pattern to these kinds of relationships. He is still young and has some growing up to do. From what it sounds like you did mostly everything for him in an almost parental way? It confuses me personally that he married you and then decided to move out,  I don't find that ok and I'm sure he knew what he was doing when he made the commitment.   This may sound harsh but you need to talk to him, tell him how you are feeling. It's not fair that he gets to grow up and leave you there alone. If things don't work out I would say you should move on, as hard as that sounds because it seems like he already has.  I know I repeat this in many posts but I am 22 and my partner is 56. We talk a lot about our future and he and I know that somewhere down the line we could or will go our own paths. Currently in our relationship I have a hard time going one night away from him. I love when we cuddle and spend our days together. I couldn't imagine moving out with a ""best friend"" and leaving him alone. That just sounds awful and selfish for me to expect our relationship to continue even though I have moved on.    Please don't waste your days feeling this way and create a plan of action. Curious as well, are you paying for his school and for him to live at this other place?"
gayyoungold,2lf9e0,youyouyuyu,1 point,Thu Nov 6 23:22:11 2014 UTC,"No, he is paying his friend rent.  Incidentally, this isn't the same friend that he was/is sensitive about my reactions to.  He has paid for all of his own schooling.  There has been an economic impact on me because he isn't contributing to our (my) household expenses right now.  It's not going to cause me undue hardship or anything, but it will cause things to be tighter.  I haven't been his parent, but I have helped him figure out how to be an adult in a lot of ways.  I don't do things for him aside from some household chores so that he can spend his time working on school.  This is at my insistence.    It's an evolving situation between us.  He's been moved out for three weeks.  Things are stable for the time being and he doesn't have plans to be apart for more than the rest of this school year.  We spend time together and text/snapchat many times per day.  There is much sincere affirmation of feelings and love and we are physically very into eachother.  There is a plan to officially re-evaluate where we are at his Christmas break.  He may move back at that point.  We have also talked about me moving in with him at his friends house (it's large and has an unused master suite) while we look for a new place if the house sells sooner than we anticipate.  There are a lot of things up in the air.  The complicating factor is that his friend has said to him ""thank goodness you're here (and paying rent).  I would have probably had to drop out of school to work more otherwise.""  He feels that this person has done so much for him that he needs to be there for her until she moves out of state right after the completion of school in May.  I feel like he has agreed to give this person thousands of dollars in rent that could be put toward our marital home.  I'm trying to take the long view.  If he is going to come back a happier person then I'm more than willing to invest resources and time in helping him along that journey.  The truth is that we are at very different places in our lives.  This is the case for a lot of older-younger relationships.  For right now, I feel like it is my responsibility to allow him room to grow.  Am I being a pushover?"
gayyoungold,2lf9e0,dadnme,2,Sat Nov 8 00:03:34 2014 UTC,"First off I wanted to say thank you so much for the reply. It gave me a better idea of your situation.  For me and my partner I chip in about half of what I make, it goes to food, house hold items, and whatever else we buy. I always felt that I should also pull my weight financially, even though I don't make close to what he does.   It sounds like even though he is moved out you are quite connected with him which is a good sign in my opinion. That still must be hard to go to bed alone and not have him there with you physically.  Also it does sound like he feels like he owes the guy which makes sense. But I don't think he should be investing that much financially into his other life away. If he is serious about moving back in with you he needs to have that talk with his friend and let him know the situation. This will allow his friend to know where your partner is at and when the time comes he can find another room mate.  I feel like you guys should be either together or not, the whole limbo situation seems like it only complicates everything.  I really hope it works out for you and honestly I don't think you are being a big pushover, but you are giving more room than I would given that you are married to him (so a little bit of a pushover)."
gayyoungold,2lf9e0,Iwearsandalssomtimes,1 point,Sat Nov 8 18:33:14 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't know what to tell you as I can't sympathize with your husband's feelings or thoughts of wanting to experience college life and such. I'd understand where he was coming from if he didn't have a husband (or significant other) or a place to live with someone already. It just seems like a very drastic move for very little reason.  The only thing I can think of are things you probably don't want to hear, and I'm sure that being positive is the better option in this scenario. If he tells you that he misses you, then you've got to believe him and try to make it into a situation where you guys can both air out your feelings.   You note that you don't have much success in talking to each other about things that upset you, but that really has to change if he is to come back. At the very least, you two need to sit down and talk about what's causing a rift between you--and if that has a part to play in his moving out."
gayyoungold,2lf9e0,Iwearsandalssomtimes,1 point,Sat Nov 8 21:55:12 2014 UTC,"You're right.  We both want to be better communicators.  Interestingly, we have been better at it since he has moved out.  That along with things like sex and conversation have improved.  I am worried and scared too.  If I was reading my story (and it wasn't my story) I would think that he doesn't know if he wants to be married any more either.  I think that's why I'm feeling the way I am.  Thanks for replying."
gayyoungold,2lf9e0,jay4812,1 point,Thu Nov 6 01:15:31 2014 UTC,"Sounds like he is exasperated... is that possible? Or maybe he honestly just wants to live the college life. Do you tend to be over barring or controlling? He may really like that, but at times it could be too much.   We are not good at talking about things that bother us and have only argued 4 times in the three and a half years that we've been together. There is a wall of text that I'm leaving out here   Huh... Well I would guess that's where the problem is. I would suggest couples therapy. If you guys can't talk, then there are problems that likely go unresolved.   Sounds like you are willing to own up to some of the problem, is he? If so then talk, or get help to learn how to talk to each other.   One thing. Marriage is a commitment, and people aren't supposed to just walk away from it. That is the point of marriage. On a personal level that bugs me."
gayyoungold,2lf9e0,jay4812,2,Fri Nov 7 21:20:35 2014 UTC,"He might be exasperated.  That's a good word for it, actually.  I don't think I'm controlling, but that said it's really hard to have perspective on your own behaviors sometimes.  I want him to have good friends and to have a life outside of our relationship.  Co-dependency wouldn't work long-term for us I don't think.  We are planning on therapy before he comes back.  I don't think that people should walk away from a marriage either and for a while that's exactly what it felt like he did.  I've been working through my feelings of anger to try to get to the point that I can think rationally about what we are going through.  He has made it clear (almost daily actually) that he wants us to be a part of each other's lives.  We talk on and off throughout the day and meet up for cuddles and sex and bonding.    It has been a nice affirmation that we are still very much in love."
gayyoungold,2lf9e0,jay4812,1 point,Thu Nov 6 02:32:20 2014 UTC,I would second this.  If you two are feeling so much anxiety being in the same room over what's going on in your hearts but you can't fight you probably should seek a professional to help.

gayyoungold,2lf9e0,jay4812,1 point,Thu Nov 6 23:24:42 2014 UTC,"I applaud him for wanting to experience everything on his own and experience college. But, I believe that he should also try to invest time in you. It's a shame if he decides that being without you is better because he's not going to know what he had until it's  gone. I know for a fact that college can be very stressful with exams, projects, essays, etc. He should be glad that he has you. I know that I would be glad to have a partner who could be there for me when I felt down. Rather than asking him when he plans on coming back, you could always just ask him about how college is going and what his thoughts are so far. I would sit down and have a serious conversation with your husband. You need to get answers from him. It would be bad for you to continue your marriage if he secretly doesn't want to. I understand that it can be scary but explain to him how you're feeling. Worst case scenario, you could always try to take a class that he's taking so that you can spend some time with him. Again, that's last resort. I really hope that everything works out, you seem like a very good husband. :)"

I mean I guess she was trying to relate to you or make some sort of connection but the awkwardness that must have come after that story gives me douche chills X-D  I got that question once from my parents, the one about why not date somebody your own age or do you find guys your age attractive.  I told my mother that none of my friends were even good looking to me.  So she says, ""Oh, so those guys who you brought home with you from college were just friends?"" ""Yes mom."" ""...huh...good, thats a relief.""  O_o WTF what was she relieved about?!  None of my friends or family have ever tried to talk me out of my relationship or made comments like the ones you mentioned.  All of them, for the most part, like hanging out with my husband.  Oddly enough 2 of my husband's friends commented to him (shortly after meeting me for the first time) that he should date somebody else, that I wasn't right for him.  Though when pressed they wouldn't reveal why.  Those people no longer hangout with us but they are FB friends with my husband so they see the life he and I have together...so suck on that friends of my husband :P"
gayyoungold,2leru3,Whitedragon2,2,Thu Nov 6 02:14:07 2014 UTC,"I kind of told them when I came out to them in my early 20s.  But I simply said he was older.  My older brother meet him first at a lunch with the 3 of us.  After that we moved up to dinner with my parents and finally a holiday gathering at my parents with some extended family.  My husband has asked me not to tell them his age and I haven't.  Funny thing is my family wants to know his age.  They don't care about the number they just want him to tell them haha.  My parents were loving and supportive.  My husband is actually younger then both of them so I kind of had it a bit easier.  Plus my brother married a woman 10+ years older then him so having another older in-law wasn't a big shock to them.  I just dived in one day and told them after they were pressing me over and over about the ""woman"" I was dating and living with.  Went better then expected, I got hugged."
gayyoungold,2leru3,Whitedragon2,2,Thu Nov 6 15:31:18 2014 UTC,That was so sweet to read. I have a hard time trying to hide my relationship with my partner since we live together.  I know my mom would get it but it just seems like a hard concept to explain. :(
gayyoungold,2leru3,RustyGuns,3,Wed Nov 5 22:42:40 2014 UTC,"I know it sounds cliche but you'll never know until you go for it.  I'll admit I was scared of the reaction I would get from my parents since my father is a devout catholic.  He surprised me with how he came around.  The bigger shock was my mom getting up and hugging me.  My mom NEVER hugs first (not that she never hugged me but I always initiated it) so I was stunned.  Then she told me something I'll never forget, ""I'm sorry for how hard you will have it but we love you.""  Meaning she was sorry for the difficulty I'd experience in life for being gay.  My dad joined her shortly after...oooohhh the feels T_T"
gayyoungold,2leru3,Whitedragon2,2,Sat Nov 8 00:07:43 2014 UTC,That sounds awesome :) I have came out to my mom already and she didn't have a problem with it at all. She was more concerned about having grand kids lol. I haven't talked to my dad yet but I will someday.
gayyoungold,2leru3,RustyGuns,1 point,Sat Nov 8 15:11:24 2014 UTC,"Well if you want them, there are ways for her to have grand kids.  Don't assume because you are gay and in an inter-generational relationships its out of the question.  Hope all goes well with your father someday."
gayyoungold,2leru3,Whitedragon2,2,Sat Nov 8 18:25:52 2014 UTC,"I'm 29 years old.   Told my mom I am bi in march of this year. Told her, at the sametime, that I was attracted to oldermen (of her age).  It was a shock for her. Both being bi and attracted to oldermen.  I am now in a relationship with a 63 years old man (3 years older than her). She met him a couple times. The first time, it was hard for her, to see her son with a guy her age. But now, it's all good.  Funny things is.. my friends dont give a shit about the age of my bf. I was pretty happy about that (most of my friends used to be homophobic when we were younger...)"
gayyoungold,2lerwo,GayAuroch,7,Wed Nov 5 22:01:41 2014 UTC,"I'm really sorry that you are going through this and I understand that you are pretty broken up and angry by it.  Unfortunately it looks like you took the relationship much more serious than he did. I agree that you should break up with him, but I advise you to do so without the drama.  Just a simple, ""I can see this isn't working out so I think its time we move on"" is sufficient.  Sending the email you have prepared isn't likely to get you any satisfactory response from him.  You've already written it out, you've already gotten it off your chest. Don't waste your words on someone who doesn't deserve them.  You sound like a decent guy and will meet someone who deserves to have a guy like you.  In the meantime, dust of that little black book. ;-)"
gayyoungold,2lerwo,buscoamigos,1 point,Wed Nov 5 22:20:29 2014 UTC,"Thank you for your response :) Maybe a shorter response would have better long-term effects, but I wrote this message to him bearing in mind that I don't know for certain what's going on...so I went to the trouble of making my intentions very clear. And there is the matter of the plane ticket that he already paid for, haha.   Sending the email you have prepared isn't likely to get you any satisfactory response from him.  You've already written it out, you've already gotten it off your chest. Don't waste your words on someone who doesn't deserve them.   Again, I still respect him enough that I don't want to leave him guessing. Part of this is me trying to assuage the feeling of...indebtedness?...to him that I feel, seeing as he paid for everything when I went down to visit, including my ticket then. I agree that any response isn't likely to be positive, but ""Why"" is a question from him I don't want to hear."
gayyoungold,2lerwo,buscoamigos,2,Wed Nov 5 22:28:18 2014 UTC,"You should ask him directly.  ""Hey, haven't heard from you for a couple of weeks.  Starting to think that maybe you don't want to continue with me.  What's going on?""  Seriously, you aren't indebted to him. He gave to you freely and without obligation. He certainly got something out of it."
gayyoungold,2lerwo,buscoamigos,1 point,Thu Nov 6 00:08:43 2014 UTC,"To me, sending a text that...abrupt feels too impersonal. He's had two fucking weeks to answer my question of ""what's going on"", and clearly doesn't feel the need to respond.   Seriously, you aren't indebted to him. He gave to you freely and without obligation. He certainly got something out of it.   However, on this you're absolutely right. Doing what's right for me is hard...but he's an adult, and knows how to live with the consequences of his choices. This, unfortunately, is one of them."

I don't think I will be able to count on a response from him, maybe I'll get one maybe I won't, but at that point it will not matter to me anymore."
gayyoungold,2lerwo,RustyGuns,2,Thu Nov 6 04:19:55 2014 UTC,I still think that he owes it to you to tell you and let you go.  Good luck.  You deserve better and hopefully you find it next time.
gayyoungold,2lerwo,thistime_neveragain,2,Thu Nov 6 04:30:51 2014 UTC,"sends hugs I can imagine how you must feel. It hurts horribly to be abandoned like that. And I can totally understand the desire to enforce closure, to write something in the hope to provoke some reaction, and be it only anger or guilt. Send it by all means, just be prepared that it is met with the same silence. I'm also going through heartache right now (different sitch, but also feeling abandoned and left standing with plans and hopes I put a lot of effort into), and the only things that seem to abate the pain a bit is spending time with friends, throwing myself into work, travelling - anything that keeps me from being alone with my thoughts. Wishing you all the best!"

Enough with the fucking games."" I decided on a two week grace period after talking to one of my friends,    Send it by all means, just be prepared that it is met with the same silence.   Honestly, the thought didn't even cross my mind. Thank you for telling me this.   left standing with plans and hopes I put a lot of effort into   :( I'm so sorry. My hopes and expectations for this relationship were not as high as they might have been--I've learned not to count my chicks before they hatch--but I know very well what that feels like. hugs Best of luck to you, brother."
gayyoungold,2lerwo,Namodacranks,2,Wed Nov 5 22:33:01 2014 UTC,Not to sounds like a jerk but there might be more to this since it has happened before. I think you may have jumped into this further then he did unfortunately. (You mentioned only being physically together for a week)   Bottom line though is You don't deserve to feel that way about someone and not have them reciprocate that emotion back. I hope you all the best and be careful with who you open up to with. Also don't cause drama and be the bigger man with your text. I feel he didn't own up to his monogamous part either. Not cool.

gayyoungold,2ldqlo,Elandiga_Varg,5,Wed Nov 5 17:34:28 2014 UTC,"We have him in therapy and yes they increased hours for therapy because of this.  The harm he is causing is not too extreme.  He was keeping them locked in his room and preventing them from leaving.  Hugging them too tight.  Thankfully he has not gone over what I call the deep end with breaking bones, cutting, or something to that extreme.  In fact we have our son set for specialized child therapy app now to get a handle on this before it becomes worse.  Our therapist thinks the he might have a bi-polar or split personally issue.  A specialist is what we are going to line up for him.  Provided the doctor seeing him actually has an opening."
gayyoungold,2ldqlo,Elandiga_Varg,2,Wed Nov 5 17:38:34 2014 UTC,"I'm glad that you're already making the right steps.

I never told them about my attraction to older guys, how it was confusing me, or that I was fighting against admitting that I was gay.  But it did get me to open up to my parents and, years later, open up even more to them about me being gay.  Its why I tell my kids to be honest and open in therapy.  Anything they don't want to talk to him about they can always come to me about or my husband."

This is probably the key IMHO. I'm pretty sure you can read about this pattern even in Dickens and similar: he grew up in a place (be it orphanage or problematic family) where he wasn't loved and he didn't get anything for nothing. He still doesn't understand your love. He's still convinced the only way to survive is to game the system, and probably that you want to earn something from his (looking as) ""behaving well"". Things like that.  Now, how to fix that I have no idea... But thanks for doing this job of parenting. I hope your older son can help, or the young will feel wronged."
gayyoungold,2ldqlo,waha501,3,Wed Nov 5 21:07:07 2014 UTC,"Yes our oldest also had this issue for awhile.  He had 2 failed adoptions, one of which had him living in the home already.  School was the reason DYFS told him the adoption failed so that lead to A LOT of issues with school and our oldest.  But he was in need of making a genuine loving, stable, relationships so he finally took a chance on us...and we exceeded his expectations =)  What makes it harder for the younger one is that unlike our oldest, the younger one had 40+ placements.  Meaning he bounced around 40 different homes all over the state.  A family was fostering him, but the head of the house got cancer and had chemo on the weekends.  That meant every weekend our youngest had to be temporally placed with a family while the person spent the weekend under going chemo treatment.  His ability to form loving lasting relationships has been severely damaged.  It makes it so hard to bond with him at times.  You can tell when he is forming a real one because he gets very giggly and smiles a lot.  You can tell he is having trouble processing the emotions in him but hey hes happy at least."
gayyoungold,2ldqlo,dadnme,5,Wed Nov 5 21:18:01 2014 UTC,"I've come to believe that some children are anti-social, devious, untrustworthy and tend to migrate to criminal and self-destructive behavior no matter how hard we try to save them.  I know there are oceans of PhDs out there that want to think otherwise, but that hasn't been my experience; bad kids turn into bad adults."
gayyoungold,2ldqlo,waha501,2,Wed Nov 5 17:10:45 2014 UTC,"I believe bad adults can almost never be turned around, but a bad kid can be.  If my parents had taken your attitude then I wouldn't be here now.  As a teenager I went through a very dark phase were I hated my parents, actively tried to get them to kick me out of their home, was destructive,  and contemplated suicide (well planned is probably a better word to use).  My parents never gave up on me, got me the help I needed, and made the effort to show they cared for me and wanted what was best for me.  I had a serious heart to heart with my mother that turned me around. My father also made an effort to take more time for me and that also helped strengthen my bond with him.  I came to terms with what i hated about myself and that eventually lead me to discover my true self (like the fact I am gay and like older guys).  If I can just get my son to finally tell us how he really feels, what the real root of this problem is, then I think we can start making steps towards a better life for him.  As hopeless as I feel now, I think he still can be turned around."

Yes, there are some bad kids that evolve to bad adults but this is hardly a situation that needs your case study as evidence. I have seen many bad kids turn to good adults. I think it's a bit reckless to suggest that this is the beginning of the end and cast aside a child at such a tender age."
gayyoungold,2ldqlo,buscoamigos,2,Wed Nov 5 20:54:15 2014 UTC,"To be honest I had a similar reaction to their post at first.  But rather then ride the white hot limo of heat I was feeling I waited and read it again later after my anger had died down.  There are a lot of shitty parents out there.  And why did I not turn into a bad adult?  Well because I had good parents who cared and right now my kid needs that.  Going through the adoption process with DYFS taught me that there are some real bad parents out there.  They deserve much of the blame for how their children turned out.  If this poster works in that field or in corrections, I can see why they would have this opinion.  But things turned around so no worries IMO."
gayyoungold,2ldqlo,sub_woofer,2,Wed Nov 5 21:24:44 2014 UTC,"You're absolutely right.  My experience is prejudiced and it's showing.  The truth seems to be that some boys that are labeled ""bad"" are just challenging and often times end up being the ones that advance society.  So, yes, my view was reckless, but it's equally reckless to assume that all bad boys turn out to be good.  It's just so hard to tell, and the only way to tell is to handle them with love and patience, assume they are the best and most challenging of children and see how they are after time passes and they mature.  Thank you for your comment."
gayyoungold,2ldqlo,sub_woofer,3,Thu Nov 6 00:18:21 2014 UTC,"The kid has no hope, and for some reason is very hurt, angry, and might feel abandoned. The kid needs leadership, and he will find it somewhere, it just depends where.   This kid has tons of feelings and no vocabulary to parse them. The only ones he seems to show is rejection and anger. This is an important age so act now. Open the can of worms that is his feelings. It's important that you do not react with anger and hostility to his outbursts. He needs to see leadership, and strength in a calm cool manner.   There is a good chance people that love him won't help because they are too close, and easily manipulated. What they can offer is unconditional love. When in doubt, defer to unconditional love. Leadership and love are not mutually exclusive. My guess is you don't yet have the training to walk that tightrope. For that, seek professional help. The best help; a licensed cognitive therapist, or Phd psychologist. This is way too big for a social worker or life coach. Don't mess around. This situation can get better, but it won't be easy."
gayyoungold,2ldqlo,paralapapa,2,Wed Nov 5 21:08:10 2014 UTC,"I guess I should clarify that our in home therapist is a licensed psychologist.  Both of our kids have been meeting with him weekly since they were placed in our home so he is well aware of their lives, growth, and needs.    His recommendation currently is to increase therapy hours but to also have him seen by a Specialized Children's Hospital that has psychologist on staff who deal with special needs kids like our children.  Both kids have already been evaluated by the center and we were waiting for an opening to occur (a doctor to have room in his schedule for our kids) that would have us taking our son there on a weekly basis.  The therapist is going to ask that this get fast tracked now to see if we can get our youngest in sooner.  You sound like my husband telling me to be calm, approach this with strength and not anger.  That is hard for me, but you and him are right.  I have to find a place of zen in my mind to be calm and talk to him rather then yell a lot.  He craves attention, good or bad.  So when you don't blow up on him it actually helps.  Hearing it from somebody else is helpful, thank you."

gayyoungold,2lb8dp,youyouyuyu,3,Tue Nov 4 23:26:52 2014 UTC,"From my experiences through undergraduate and graduate degrees, older men are usually fine with dating younger men in college. They've been there and they know what it's like--and it usually impresses them that you're advancing yourself. While money can be an issue, not everything comes with a cost and there's certainly plenty of things you can do that are low cost.  As I see it, there's no reason to hold yourself back in terms of a love life just because you want to pursue an education and career. If you find the right person who shares a solid connection with you, it's more probable that they will be your biggest supporter and stick with you rather than break up with you. If distance becomes an issue, then reevaluate but nothing says that just because you move away means your relationship won't work out. To be frank, I've ran into more older guys looking to settle down than fuck around. If the fact that you're currently pursuing education is a turnoff, then he's most likely not the right man for you anyways.  My boyfriend saw me graduate with my Bachelor's and my Master's in the US despite him being in the UK. He was my greatest support when my classes were hard and my internship was demanding. Just because you're physically apart doesn't mean you can't be together."

I honestly do want to start dating. I know that there are men who are willing to fully support me throughout my time in college but the hard part would be finding the man who's willing to deal with such a situation. I personally thought that more older men wanted to be settled down.   Reading how your situation was really does give me hope that I'll be able to find an older man. Thank you for the advice, it really helps me. Especially since you've actually experienced this. :)"
gayyoungold,2lb8dp,RustyGuns,2,Wed Nov 5 06:16:08 2014 UTC,"It may not really be what you want to hear, but most older men don't really want to be in a serious relationship with a college student. I tried searching for a relationship throughout my schooling and ran into that same problem over and over so I decided it was just easier to have older friends and fuck buddies because I expected something deeper from dating older men while they just wanted to meet someone new, have fun, and fool around. It became pretty emotionally difficult to constantly have my hopes crushed.  So I slept around (safely) and had a ton of fun being unattached during school and within half a year of graduating, I started a relationship and living with an amazing man in his 50s. Your experience may very, but don't get too hung up on finding a partner during college. Dating and fucking around can be fun and a necessary experience, and experience is what men want a million times more than supposed maturity."

That's exactly what worries me, that I'll end up an emotional wreck. I'll prioritize college then. I was hoping that maybe the first older man I do anything sexual with will be the one I stay with. After all, I can only assume he has the experience so I would learn more from him as our relationship progressed. But, maybe that's asking for too much. Anyways, thanks for the advice."

Silver hair, hairy chested etc. I LOVE the way he looks. His blue eyes, the grey hair, cute face! Major turn ons. However, it is his personality I love the most. He also struggles with why a 26 year old could find him attractive. I keep telling him it is just. what. I. like. I kept telling him over and over again that guys my own age do nothing for me. It's the package of a mature man, the lifestyle, his intelligence and his looks that do it for me. I think he got the message as he stopped talking about it anymore. I also noticed a boost in his self esteem.  Listen to him when he tells you he likes your looks, really listen to him. Talk about it.   Not everybody likes the 25 year old muscular hairless models you see on TV.   Hope this helps."

When we met, we both were insecure about the perceptions each other had of one another.  With me, it was easier after I met him. I had always been ashamed of my body. Thought I was too skinny, too thin, and just plain too ugly for anyone to be attracted to me - body or personality. When he met me, the first several days I didn't believe him - no matter how much he flattered me, I still felt that way. At first I didn't even think I would be able to communicate with him, I never gave myself or my english enough credit. Fortunately, it wore off. I saw his eyes shine when he looked at me. He really did think I was beautiful. I saw his eyes lust after me when I shyly exposed myself at his request for the first time. And I was sure of it when I felt his hardness against me when we kissed. When he complimented me then, I believed him. I allowed myself to feel adored. And I felt better.  With him, it was a little tougher, but it's better now. I, too, always complimented him on how beautiful he was everyday, but he struggled nevertheless. He didn't feel I could be attracted to him, or even love him, because of how old he was, and how fat he was. I didn't care. That was exactly why I was so attracted to and in love with him. Then we had a conversation about it.  He said he wished he was younger and that he wanted to lose weight so I would be more attracted to him. I told him that was nonsense. I loved him exactly the way he was and I couldn't care less if he was fit or fat, or old - he didn't need to do absolutely anything to get more handsome to me - those were reasons why I was attracted to him, how dare he want to change them for me? So I told him, if he wanted to lose weight for himself, to feel better about himself and whatnot, he could go ahead. But if he wanted to do it for me, I would smack his face. And I adored him old the way he was. I wouldn't make him a second younger.  It ended up that he went to the gym and lost weight - for himself, not for me. He felt more confident, pretty and healthy. I honestly didn't care about how he looked, he was handsome to me either way, I just felt happy for him. He now accepts and smiles every time I tell him he's the personification of absolute perfection.  Believe me, your partner is with you because he finds you handsome and loves you. If he didn't, he wouldn't be. Have a talk about it - learn to allow yourself to welcome his compliments. If you don't like your body, look at yourself - what can you change? Is it worth it to, or should you just deal with it? Work on it. But whatever you do, work on yourself so you will feel better. Not anyone else. And keep in mind, somethings you just can't change: like your age. Accept your partner loves you just the way you are, and move on.  Remember, the world does not see you through your eyes. We never see the best in ourselves. The ones who love us do. :)"
gayyoungold,2l2ltz,Caporn,3,Sun Nov 2 18:36:16 2014 UTC,Hey I'm 23 and I don't like my body.   I'm sure you'll fit right in with the rest of us.
gayyoungold,2l2ltz,GiveMeDaddiesPlease,4,Sun Nov 2 23:22:29 2014 UTC,"As a younger man who is attracted to much older men, this is how I'd describe it:  My attractions are the opposite of the social norm. While most guys have preference for signs of youth, I have preference for signs of aging. Every wrinklle, grey hair and other sign of aging make a man more attractive to me. Based on your post, it seems like your partner has a similar preference. I wouldn't worry to much about it. To me, there is absolutely no attraction to 99.9% of guys under the age of 50, and I'd much rather am older man to that .01%! The maturity and life experience of older men is also a major attraction."
gayyoungold,2l2ltz,waha501,2,Sun Nov 2 16:38:52 2014 UTC,Thanks my friend it's good to hear what you say
gayyoungold,2l2ltz,thrvwawvy,2,Sun Nov 2 16:44:55 2014 UTC,"I think we all have that worry when we have a really good boy.  It doesn't help when we can tell that we are aging rapidly and have previously had a boy just walk away.  I have no boy at this time and I'm 67.  I workout regularly, stay active, still have my hair and have an intense appreciation and loyalty to and of young men.  I'm hoping I'll find another.   I suggest you enjoy it while you can, since you can't control everything.  Good luck."
gayyoungold,2l2ltz,mick_dog,2,Sun Nov 2 19:14:06 2014 UTC,"I'm 20 and my partner is 56, 170cm, 75kg. He is perfect to me though, because I love him. He's always trying to keep fit and get a better body but as I tell him, I really don't care either way. We have an emotional connection so the physical attraction kind of just happens."
gayyoungold,2l2ltz,RustyGuns,2,Sun Nov 2 22:59:59 2014 UTC,"My friends will constantly ask me what men I find interesting. I just tell them that I'm attracted to older men. Usually they end up shocked  and ask me why not younger hot guys my age. I tell them that I'm only attracted to older men. In short, I find them attractive. Don't worry too much about your partner finding someone else. I'm positive you and your partner have a strong physical/emotional bond. Personally, I wouldn't want to date an older man based on pure appearance but also look for a man with a good personality.  With that being said, try to keep your self-esteem up. It will make your partner happier knowing that you're happy with yourself. Also trust is key in a relationship so trust him when he says that he loves you."
gayyoungold,2l2ltz,Whitedragon2,2,Mon Nov 3 00:37:50 2014 UTC,"i'm 26 and madly in love with a 56 year old. we have a fuckbuddy that's 65.  he was extremely worried about his attractiveness when we started dating. even when he put extra effort into looking good, he felt fat and unattractive. when we were together, he would be very careful to not display any affection in case it ""made me uncomfortable"".  we're all insecure sometimes. i tell him every day we're together how sexy he is, and i try to be specific. his face is beautiful, his eyes are caring, his chest and shoulders are broad and strong... even his beer belly is great when we're cuddling or in bed! if he doesn't believe me, i remind him that our backgrounds and personalities (he was law enforcement, i was military) have really resonated and now we're beyond the physical attraction stage anyway. i grab his hand or put my arm around him in public because i know that initial discomfort eventually becomes peacefulness and pride, for me at least. and who gives a fuck what the people at the grocery store think?  he has a ""normal"" body too... don't we all? we're not attracted to ""bodies"", we're attracted to men. that's why we're gay. and we can be as weird and beautiful as we want."
gayyoungold,2l2ltz,Mossy-Toes,2,Mon Nov 3 01:00:15 2014 UTC,"Hey man! I wanted to say that my partner says the exact same things. I am 22 and he is 56 and we have been together for almost 3 years. Over the course of our relationship he has some tough times accepting his age. If we ever go out he will stare at himself at the mirror and feel ashamed of himself. As his partner it is really hard to see. I am always telling him how sexy he looks (because honestly I can't get over him physically) but he still will not accept it. He sometimes wonders why I am even attracted to him. He will also see other guys his age and wonder why I am with him as well. Which I always reaffirm him that I find him the most attractive, and I honestly do.   My advice to you is to come to terms with yourself and with your body. We all age and get old. And with getting old you start to degrade physically. Clearly you're physically attractive since you have landed a sweet guy who is 27 and loves you a lot. Many guys your age don't get that. I am sure you are a sweet attractive guy and it's clear that your partner thinks so as well. Hope you can come to terms and accept yourself physically. You will be a much happier person inside and out. :) Goodluck!!"

About the shyness, if the guy's interested in you they're probably just as shy as you are. I feel like the younger men in situations like these would be more nervous and intimidated due to the older guy being more experience and well..much older. I may be wrong but this is definitely true for me. Was very very nervous on my first date with an older man."

I used to be a much angrier, anxious person before my partner. Although he's made me calmer, I still lose my mind over little things sometimes. He's the older and definitely the calmer one in the relationship.  He thinks the younger is the calmer one in the picture. I think it's the older."

Have a good sense of humor.     this is my first relationship ever   Be open in your communications -- both ways.  That topic that either or both of you seem to be avoiding (whatever it is), that's the one to explore.  Let each other talk."
gayyoungold,2kike0,funchords,2,Tue Oct 28 00:51:07 2014 UTC,"You seem anxious and that's totally normal. Wow, being so young and there's someone so much older than you, successful, etc? It can feel intimidating. I've been there too. But to be honest, that's where you are at your life. And he knows and understands that. He's not expecting you to be stable with a career or other ""adult"" stuff. You will get there when you get there, and he wants to be part of that process as you get there.  Good. Take care of that small stuff while you can. I'm sure he appreciates it. Just offer what you can, and he will offer what he can -- that's what a relationship is! And if you have any insecurities, talk to him -- that's also what a relationship is for!  I might be speculating, but are you anxious about just dating an older person? Or are you anxious about dating an older person and feeling you're not at a certain point in life? If it's the latter, don't worry about it! You're 17! Just try to focus on school and if you have any jobs, on that too.   tl;dr  Try not to be anxious. It's normal to be where you are at your age. Be open and help one another in your relationship."
gayyoungold,2kike0,nruel2,2,Tue Oct 28 21:20:40 2014 UTC,It's rare in this sub to find a guy with the same exact age gap as me and my bf. I was 17 when I met him. He was 30 also. Now it's 19/32. I'm a full-time student and can't really contribute. He pays bills and sometimes takes me out to dinner. Whenever I feel like I'm not pulling my weight he laughs and says he's happy to do it and that no relationship is 50/50 all the time. I guess when we're old I'll have to take care of him. But I advise just have an open dialogue about concerns like this. Maybe he'll tell you something to make you feel better
gayyoungold,2kike0,gayboy95,2,Fri Nov 7 16:46:28 2014 UTC,"It's nice to see someone else that started in the same place as I did! Unfortunately, my guy isn't terribly interested in talking with me most of the time, which is a little off-putting. We don't have much in common, but to be fair,  I'm easily discouraged and after falling to ignite a conversation a couple times, I give up. We have it worked out where I clean ALL THE THINGS and run errands and cook (badly) and I recently got a job in hopes I can save for community college and start pulling my slack. Did you two hit it off immediately or did it take time?"
gayyoungold,2kike0,gayboy95,2,Fri Nov 7 18:17:19 2014 UTC,"We hit it off right away. With us it was just a hook up (although he saw potential in me). Our second date was when I realized we have a lot of similar interests and that the age gap wouldn't stop us from at least being friends. But as far as our communication and senses of humor, that came with time. I always felt comfortable with him, but it was a couple months before our communication was great, and even now it's getting stronger.   With you, are you on an equal step in conversation? Even though you're doing the house stuff and he's working, are you equals in the house?"
gayyoungold,2kike0,taway673,2,Mon Nov 10 02:46:55 2014 UTC,"My favorite thing about dating my s/o before we were married was the fact that he was 19.  No one has their shit together at 19.  I was awkward and didn't know what to do with myself most of the time.  Those qualities are part of what drew me to him.  I say that if he seems into you he probably is!  Just be your teenagery self and let him love you for being who you are.  It's really sweet that you're concerned about ""pulling your weight"".  If he's anything like me, he enjoys being able to provide some things for you.  I would just make sure that you acknowledge when he does things for you.  Don't take him for granted and remember to say thank you.  I love it when my husband (he's 22 and I'm 37) does something thoughtful for me.  It doesn't take money to show your love."

Don't let that anxiety get the better of you, TRUST me I've been in that low feeling spot and let it get the better of me and I'm not proud about who it turned me into to. It will make you crazy and push him away possibly. Just be yourself and just make sure you're taking care of yourself and making yourself better so that you can be supportive for him and be able to stand on your own two feet, that's what he'll really appreciate. Along with maybe trying to help out around the house and maybe pay for what you can afford from time to time."

It's not really anxiety so much as I don't know what to do cause I kinda want to do everything at once but can't decide on the very first thing to start with. I'm pretty positive most of the time and I do take care of nearly 100% of the household chores cause it's what I used to do at home anyway and I'm still looking for a job that isn't volunteer work. I have some money saved up and I've been living off of that, but I am a little afraid that I'm turning into a kept boy, cause that's not really what I want. I feel like I owe him more than I know how to give."
gayyoungold,2kike0,MoonAsMyWitnessLOVE,1 point,Tue Oct 28 00:15:04 2014 UTC,"I understand of you feel. One thing you can do really is just be open and honest. Sit him down and tell him how you're feeling. Tell him that you feel bad that you can't provide more for him and that you really appreciate what he has done. Even make him a card with a little note of affection and maybe a rose or something. Show him that's he's on your mind and that you're aware of the situation and now just being ignorant or taking advantage or anything. I know he hasn't said you are or that you were doing that, just helping you cover your bases."
gayyoungold,2kike0,youyouyuyu,2,Tue Oct 28 00:18:24 2014 UTC,"I try to do a little something extra for him everyday like making surprise breakfast (he normally doesn't eat before work, but always is hungry) or the like. We've talked before, but he didn't seem too concerned about anything and told me to 'take my time', but I'm not sure what that meant given the context, but didn't want to seem dull by asking. I'm kinda worried that out age difference is kinda keeping him from doing some of the things he wants to, at least fully. I am not sure how to address that."
gayyoungold,2kike0,MoonAsMyWitnessLOVE,2,Tue Oct 28 00:34:40 2014 UTC,"Well that's quite possible but I wouldn't take that personally as it's probably more so a general reservation (let's say) that some people usually have when going into relationships of varying kinds. He might just want to hold off on doing special things together until he feels more comfortable and secure with where the relationship is going. That has nothing to directly do with you, more so just a personal thing. To address, all you have to do is be yourself, and don't let there be any pressure on you, or him. Just let things flow and you'll be good. Don't be afraid to ever ask him to clarify or elaborate on something, it doesn't make you dull, it makes you smart and prepared. Good communication is a huge key to a relationship."
gayyoungold,2kike0,Justunluckybutin2it,2,Tue Oct 28 00:44:51 2014 UTC,"Wow, that's actually a really, really good viewpoint. I hadn't thought of it that way before. He does a lot of stuff with me, to my surprise, and his closest friends know about me. We've actually known each other for a couple years (we were in the same group on an MMO) and he happened to live close by, but we never met before recently. I'm not sure what I expected, but we're not super stranger-y. I think he holds off on more intimate stuff cause he remembers me being like 13 years old and annoying him (because I was a little shit). I try not to bring it up cause he gets so close to doing something then pulls back."
gayyoungold,2kike0,Justunluckybutin2it,4,Tue Oct 28 00:54:05 2014 UTC,"Honestly, if you're at the stage where you call each other boyfriends, you shouldn't worry about what you ""bring to the table"". He likes you and is doing an awful lot for you. Do you and remember what he's done for you if you guys ever get annoyed with each other. I don't think he's looking for you to pick up 50% of responsibilities just yet, but it's really great that you're thinking of that.  You aren't doing anything wrong, try not to second guess yourself and let him know that you're comfortable with him. Have an honest sit-down and talk with him...it might help a tremendous amount."
gayyoungold,2khf5t,100and8,8,Mon Oct 27 17:53:35 2014 UTC,I think you should introduce him and not make a big deal about his age. If you do tell them about your future partner's age I think you should make it about him as an individual without saying that you're only into older men in general. If you continue to date older men they're going to notice the pattern without you pointing it out.  Just be aware of not making it sound like a fetish. If it's normal to you then speak of it as such.
gayyoungold,2khf5t,killquota,3,Mon Oct 27 18:06:53 2014 UTC,"Thank you, that's good advice. I just don't want to shock them, like, ""here's my boyfriend"" and then this old man (their perception) walks in. I don't want them to think I'm being taken advantage of, you know?"
gayyoungold,2khf5t,Kaique94,1 point,Mon Oct 27 21:52:24 2014 UTC,"That's why you need to talk to them and make them realize it's a normal relationship, no different than anyone else's.  I say you take this guy's advice - introduce him like it's no big deal, because it really isn't. But also, only introduce him when you've been dating for a while (like after a year, it will lessen the judging on their part and they'll realize you are serious about it). Keep in mind in the end, they're just worried about you and want the best for you, but I think you're mature enough to know that. And if you talk to them and they still have a problem with it, it's their problem, not yours.  Best of luck, always! :)"
gayyoungold,2khf5t,youyouyuyu,3,Tue Oct 28 19:24:38 2014 UTC,There probably isn't a need to specifically say that you're into older men but it would probably help their perception of the idea and the older man if you were in a serious relationship with him.   Not sure if you were thinking of introducing your current guy but I think the fact that he already has a partner would turn your parents off to it a great deal.
gayyoungold,2khf5t,samuel33334,2,Mon Oct 27 20:01:04 2014 UTC,"I agree, the open relationship thing is complicated for many people. That's another big reason I don't think it's really necessary or even appropriate to tell them.   I also feel like I should add that, even though I say I'm not in a ""serious"" relationship with him, I still hang out with him almost every day and I like him a lot. He's my best friend right now. It's just that, with his partner especially, the future is uncertain, and I'm trying my best not to set expectations."
gayyoungold,2khf5t,GerontoMan,1 point,Mon Oct 27 21:56:31 2014 UTC,I'm in the same position as you and I told my my mom but only because she married my dad who was 20 years older than her so I figured she would understand.
gayyoungold,2khf5t,PirateCodingMonkey,2,Wed Oct 29 07:20:45 2014 UTC,I would just introduce him (or another man that you happen to meet) as a friend. They will probably know what you mean & but will ask you about it - giving you the opportunity to tell them.
gayyoungold,2khf5t,Whitedragon2,2,Mon Oct 27 19:09:34 2014 UTC,"i personally would go ahead and introduce a guy that you are serious about (whether it is this guy or someone else later.) i don't think you need to drop a bomb on them that you are into older guys, because really is it any of their business? think of it this way, if you were an 18 yo woman, would you go to your parents and say, ""mom & dad, i really like guys who are a lot older than me""? what is the point? if they love you and want the best for you, all you need to do is show that the guy you like is worthy of you and your trust. (in other words, don't bring home a guy who is obviously using you or whatever.)"
gayyoungold,2khf5t,Whitedragon2,2,Mon Oct 27 19:21:14 2014 UTC,"It is a hard choice to make but it is a personal one that only you can really decide on the right course of action.  But IMO I think it is a good idea to tell your parents.  It lifts a large weight off your shoulder and can bring you closer to your family.  Everyone's family is different though.  I came out to my parents after I was already dating & living with my now husband for a few months.  I did say his was older but I never told them his age and my husband asked me not to tell my parents his age (he is actually 10+ years younger then both of them).  So we decided to introduce him slowly to the family.  First having lunch with my older brother, then dinner at my parents house, and finally a family gathering during one of the holidays.  All went well and things are great with my family.  You might want to try doing something similar.  Talk to your parents (or maybe meet with them one at a time) about it and simply say you are dating a guy who is older then you.  I wouldn't give his age and if your parents press you simply say, ""I'd rather not, but I would like you meet him.""  Plan to have your mom meet him first before having your dad meet him since she already seems to know you are gay.  If things go well with mom she can help out when dad meets him.  Hope this helps and good luck with your choice."
gayyoungold,2khf5t,RustyGuns,2,Mon Oct 27 19:23:42 2014 UTC,"I'm happy that it went well for you! That thing about not specifying age is a good idea. It shouldn't be a big deal even though it is, why blow it up?"

My household growing up was rather polar opposites with my mother being an atheist liberal and my father being a christian republican.  My I suggest maybe waiting to introduce a guy to your parents until you are sure it is someone you want to have a serious relationship with?  I can't tell from your post how much this guys means to you but if you feel strongly enough about him to come out and introduce him to your family by all means go ahead.  Someone suggested coming out to both your parents first then having the meeting later after it sinks in, I agree with that.  Take your time and don't rush it."

I feel that me being 22 and him 56 would cause some interesting reactions. I have been with him for almost three years and had no problems so far. It is kinda sad though because I really love him and would love to show him to the family. Maybe someday. It's is all up to you and how you feel your parents would react.
gayyoungold,2khf5t,Chris-in-WA,2,Mon Oct 27 23:52:34 2014 UTC,"it's cool to tell them, but just make it seem unimportant and just a simple personality or mental description if you will. My parents know that I'm into older guys. They aren't too keen about it but they understand and ACCEPT it, that's the difference. They're totally cool with my being gay and everything though."
gayyoungold,2khf5t,aron2295,2,Mon Oct 27 23:56:29 2014 UTC,"If you tell him, your dad is going to want to fix it.  So if you tell him, best to tell him about it conceptually.    Dad, I tend to be into older guys.  It's not unlike girls who like older guys.    Let him get acquainted with that idea for quite a while before you introduce someone to him.   Then, before you introduce someone specifically, let him know   - how you met  - how you feel about him  - that he's older  Then, days later, introduce him."
gayyoungold,2k80fx,GerontoMan,2,Fri Oct 24 19:07:32 2014 UTC,"I think you've got the right idea. Find common ground for them and it should all go ok.

gayyoungold,2k80fx,Robolabo,2,Fri Oct 24 21:53:43 2014 UTC,"My husband is 38 years older than I am, so when we go to family functions (I'll get to that later) he is the eldest. The first time was nerve racking to say the least, but my husband and I had a talk before traveling back the family farm. Yes, literally a farm, in rural Gerogia. Our deal was I wouldn't leave his side and if it got weird or hostile we would simply leave. We didn't need their approval. So we get there, my sisters and mother had met him but not the extended family, and my late aunt screams from the front porch swing, and I am not joking, ""Hey there ChopstickakaJames's friend!"" I quickly in front of everyone on the front porch said, ""His name is XXXX, and he is my fiancé."" From that point on, there were no questions. And they all came to our wedding and include us both as a couple. So we were at a family wedding, and someone made a comment of my uncle being the eldest there. My husband, now a part of the family, is confident enough to correct them when wrong.   If my redneck family from rural Georgia can accept us, then anything is possible. Just be yourselves and be confident. If you seem wavering then they will think that even you question your partner selection, which is not the case.   Congrats on reaching out to reconnect. It takes guts."

Feels great!  We just got back and it was really really nice. Feel nearly like a normal person! Definitely a huge weight off me now that I've done it! It was my first time introducing my partner to anybody other than a friend or an acquaintance.

I am betting the last thing you want is to get something stuck up there and have to go to the hospital about it...it happens more often then you think XD  Your going to want to get a fair amount of lube, both for practice and for the actual ""show.""  A cucumber comes to mind, but that is an object you may have trouble removing and its kind large to start with.  Maybe carrots, but those tend to be kind of rough even lubed up...perhaps you could get a fairly girthy pen/marker to start off with.  I'm kind of grasping at straws here because I never practiced relaxing my ass before my first time and instead had my partner help open me up and relax me.  Have you discussed with the guy the fact that this would be your first time being penetrated?  You should so he can help get you ready.  Having him take the time open you up will help you relax and reduce the pain.  It probably will hurt a bit your first time, but ask him to go slow and gentle to reduce that feeling.  Honestly, if he isn't willing to accommodate you and help this be an enjoyable experience I'd be cautious about meeting up with him.  I know some of us enjoy an older guy taking control, maybe being a bit rough, and dominating us at times but for somebody like you who is being penetrated for the first time should be treated with some TLC.  Keep that in mind when talking about this with him.

That said, I'm in an increasingly long-term dating relationship with a guy who lives two hours away, and we don't get to see each other, casually.  Prior to meeting however, and even in the first few months we knew each other, I had seven ""boys"" who served me sexually and nonsexually. I have been having a party every couple of weeks since I started becoming serious with my dating partner, and the purpose of those parties is to introduce my ""boys"" to other handsome men who I believe would be good sexual partners for them.   The point of the story, I guess, is to create the scene or party that you wish for. I have been very fortunate to have had a relationship, of sorts, with all of these men in my life, and I want the best for them - ""daddy"" or ""boy"". It's empowering to all of us, I think. It acknowledges their contribution to me, and gives a platform for finding men who are like-minded. I bet you could pull together a party with about two weeks of casual planning. Granted, I'm a project manager in my career and know how to get people together, but I think you'll be happier with the quality if you pull it together yourself. Just my two cents."
gayyoungold,2jphrw,NaverNothing,8,Sun Oct 19 17:58:01 2014 UTC,"It kind of depends on the country to start with.  In my country we also have a statutory rape law, however it's only used in extreme cases. When they know the guy has done something awful, but can't prove it cause of a technicality, they arrest him/her for statutory rape. So check the state/country this happened in and how they deal with the law.  The kid might have consented with it, but you have to understand there is a reason that law exists. Older men have a lot more life experience. They can use that plus their natural authority that comes with age to pressure and manipulate someone into sleeping with him. That's always a big risk when you are dating someone a lot older than you. Especially in your case, being a virgin and all.  He may tell you he won't pressure you into doing something, but he still could without ever saying it out loud. I've experienced this first hand (didn't fell for it thank god) and some guys are as smooth as silk. You won't know what he is doing until after the fact.  So yes, it's a red flag. If you go for it he'll be your very first. That's really a special thing. Something you'll remember for the rest of your life. So really be careful with this. If you are really not sure about this, wait for another guy. Trust me, it's better to wait 5 more years for your first than to regret it later."

Most of those 19 years you shouldn't have been having sex, so I feel like that's a skewed way to look at things.   That said, if you've decided that you're ready, then do the safe things: talk to him as long as you need to before you're comfortable (is a month long enough for you?), meet in public, let someone know the details of when and where, and maybe talk to him about this concern of yours.

I don't think anyone is going to be able to tell you what to do here. Meet him in public a few times, see if he's normal or not. No harm.   Or don't. That's also an option.   Personally no one who's met me in public a few times has been crazy or weird. I can usually sort them out from the first few messages. Maybe I have unrealistic experiences."
gayyoungold,2jphrw,Caporn,2,Sun Oct 19 18:24:07 2014 UTC,"First, meet in public and get to know him if he freely meets in public and you enjoy his company and are comfortable with him, move to the next step.  Second:  ""convicted sex offender"" includes but is not limited to people that engage in consensual sex with someone under the age to have sex with someone who's an adult, but old enough to give consent.  In some places it is 12, in others it may be 21.  In some places ""convicted sex offender"" includes a misdemeanor conviction for skinnydipping and nude sun bathing.  The criteria for committing a ""sex offense"" varies widely and rarely involves anything beyond getting caught in a sexual situation with someone under age, whatever that is.  It's easy to say that you should check someone's ID if you have doubts.  The other side of the coin is that by doing an ID check you could kill the mood.  But, realistically and using hindsight-it's always 100% right-check the ID.  The legal risk is catastrophic.  I digress.  Anyway, if you've met the guy and you're comfortable with him, having met and associated with him in public, see where it goes.  The simple truth is that, like I said, there's an enhanced likelihood that the guy just got caught with his hand in a willing cooky jar of freshly baked cookies.  Nothing's perfect, especially with online dating.  The risk is there, extremely small, but it exists.  But, by meeting in public and getting to know the other person you've gone a long way to insure your safety."

My college is full of rich private school kids who's parents are all bankers/lawyers, one is even the CEO of a major bank here in oz. ANYWAY. The whole weekend is 40-60ish men (and women I guess) roaming around the college dorms and eating areas, seeing where their kids spend most of the year. It is my favourite time of the year bar none! Older exec type grey haired men strolling around with tucked in shirts, eye candy extravaganza !   I was behind the bar/waiting for the private dinner the college puts on for them and I just stare at this room buzzing with tipsy older men in suits. Had a few chats with a couple of them, no where near confident enough to test the waters. All I want to do is grope them though drooool."

I have seen them in some bars though but I think it's pretty rare now.   I'm too pee shy to be able to do any business with one of those things but I'm imagining it's quite a sight though. You'd think given the historic important of stockyards in this region - I'd have seen it more often. It's possible there are different laws here regarding what kind of facilities a certain type of business has to offer.   My post was relatively short because I was fucking tired afterwards. I'm not sure if this is because I'm not hormonally crazy anymore but I'm not necessarily talking about something obviously erotic. At least - I don't find myself magnetized to their penises and I'm thankful for that! Lol.   It's just more of a general appreciation of the form of the contemporary older male. I guess that's just a roundabout way of saying the curvier older male, in my case. Haha.   Do you ever have fleeting thoughts that you might do something dangerous? It's hard to explain but it's more like being afraid of spontaneous lack of control of your behavior. It's not that I would actually do something - just a thought & subsequent fear that I might. I'm sure to those who haven't experienced it (or if my wording of it is awful), I sound insane.   Anyways... I imagined myself slapping this man's ass and being like, ""Yeah!!"" and then I imagined being punched in the head. Obviously I wouldn't actually do this, just have a vivid imagination that's not always close to the realm of reality.   In my defense, it was just like this revolving door of cute so maybe I had been made retarded by it. Lol."

Conversation can be more organic in person and chances are you'll end up talking a whole lot more about tangentially relayed stuff.

Whenever I run out of stuff to talk about with my husband I find asking him about his past is good way to restart the conversation.  Basically my go to whenever we run out of things to say is to get him talking about himself.  EDIT= Something I used to to do with my husband when I was away at school was to send a few questions via email or text.  These questions could be like, ""What is your happiest memory from your childhood?"" or ""What skill or hobby do you wish you could get into?""  We then only answered those questions when we met face to face.  Made for some good conversation starters.  I was nervous when we first started dating and I would write out my answers beforehand so I could read them to him. He thought it was so cute that I had to write out my answers but he loved them because they were so well thought out in written form."

We sometimes have to just do things we don't want to make our partner happy. You have done that for him by hanging out with his friends. As long as it's mutual, I think you guys will be fine.  For me and mine. We argue a lot, but when we hang, we have a good time. I think when I was courting him, I spoiled him a little to much. Now he wants everything provided by me which is taking it's toll. Is he a gold digger? No, he's just been taken care of all his life.

You could also cook him a nice meal as putting the effort in will show how special he is to you.

His idea for a weekday meal was at a four star restrauant. We had a frank conversation at the beginning about money. He was happy to treat me to nice meals and big trips. First real trip was to Shanghai. Obviously, I couldn't pay for my share. So instead I treated him by small hand made gift I made in the studio and would save up for bigger gifts for birthdays and holidays.   Current relationship, we share our money and operate on a budget. But every now again we get each other gifts of appreciation. Like today, I got him his fav candy bar."

That he grabbed it impressed me and then when he told me he was a Sapiosexual I was even more impressed and got a big smile on my face.  We dated for about 8 months and are still friends.

I try to cook for him as much as I can, usually once or twice a week. It's fun because he can help out and I get to impress him with my cookery. I prefer cooking at home because we can be ourselves (ass grabbing in the kitchen is my bread and butter), and it's cheaper so even if he grabs half the ingredients we need from the market, I can still feel like I contribute."

I'm sure it's going to be hard for me to deal with and I'll probably cry a lot. I just plan to be as strong as I can be and keep telling him how much I love him if things came to something like that. Thinking about the future is normal for people to do, but to react and fear it means fearing something that hasn't happened yet and does not actually exist in reality. Things can happen in a variety of ways. And I don't like to talk possibilities but he could just die in his sleep for all I know. Alternatively, something could happen to me. Who knows? Once he had to go to hospital because his back had locked up and was unable to move. I couldn't resist crying when they took him away. He wanted me to visit, I felt afraid of the hospital. So many mixed feelings there. Seeing others in such a state that you dont see on the outside. I went and although I felt tense, I was able to be there for him. He got out the next day, and life has been fine since. Ideas about the future are always harder than the reality. And I dont think it's unusual either that most of us underestimate our own ability to cope."

He's a big fan of classical and choral music (he pretty much exclusively listens to BBC radio 3) and doesn't really bother outside of that sphere. I can listen to that stuff but I wouldn't say I was a fan. I Ike lots of other types of music though- right now I'm listening to a lot of Bill Withers, John Grant, Bahamas, Caribou and Run the Jewels.

I like going to shows whenever possible; there are a couple of little venues in town where I've seen acts from Gregory Alan Isakov to Rich Aucoin to Tokyo Police Club.  I'm 49, so I'm always the creepy old guy at shows. But I buy merch, so I figure that makes up for it.  I'm addicted to discovering new music. Sure, I'll go back and listen to Nick Drake or vintage Portishead now and then, but there's so much great new stuff happening these days, and it's so easy to listen to all of it on subscription services, why not go exploring?  I've had one boyfriend who shared my taste in music, a few years ago. We could sit and play songs for each other for hours at a time. I do miss that.

gayyoungold,2iypor,IDontGiveAFuckOrShit,1 point,Tue Oct 14 14:44:27 2014 UTC,"Music is very dear to me.  I don't want to be that guy that says music saved his life, but it did provide me a very much welcome distraction to silence my inner demons. Music sooths my anxiety, it caresses my brain with waves that distract the depression, it fights the shame of self and shows it's okay to be whatever you want to be, it pushes your feet when you no longer want to walk, it dissipates the anger and makes things okay. Music gives my life more colour and motivation. I'm not quite sure I would've made it without it.  But anyways, to the point of the question: I mostly like Rock. Of all kinds. Metal, folk, classic, progressive, alternative, indie, you name it. I also like a little jazz and electronic music.  Music is very extensive and it's hard to pick favourites, but I would say, as of October 14th, my favourite musician is Elliott Smith. His music has resonated to me in a very personal level for the past four years. Other musicians/bands I enjoy are Metallica, Arctic Monkeys, Led Zeppelin, The Cure, Red Hot Chili Peppers, System of a Down, Dire Straits, The Beatles, Oasis, Nirvana, The Strokes, Peter Frampton, Mudvayne, Daft Punk, Buckethead (if you like his music, consider yourself my friend) - just to name a few out of the top of my head.  My partner however has a very different taste to mine. He likes pop music - Shakira is his favourite, and also Madonna, Kylie Minogue, Beyoncé and the like. I don't mind some of that music, I actually can enjoy it, but mostly it doesn't do anything for me. But on the same token he really enjoys when I play guitar for him or show him some music I like or ramble on about music in general. And I giggle when he hits play on Hips Don't Lie for the thousandth time just to make me laugh. So I don't mind."

gayyoungold,2ixffp,iknowimnotcool,6,Sat Oct 11 06:48:07 2014 UTC,"depends on the two men. could be sex drive. could be genuine attraction. the biggest question is: does it matter? if both men are consenting and above the age of consent in their area, does it matter if it's ""sex drive"" or whatever. just be kind to each other and honest. if you are the older man, remember the camp-site rule: leave him in the same shape (or better) than when you met him - so no STI's, no emotional issues, be a responsible adult in how you treat him. if you are the younger man, treat him the way you'd want to be treated. be honest about your intentions and genuine in your feelings. if you are neither, butt out of other people's relationships unless they ask your advice.  best of luck."
gayyoungold,2ixffp,PirateCodingMonkey,3,Sat Oct 11 22:50:52 2014 UTC,"It depends on the people involved. If you really are looking for a serious long term relationship then you should be able to find someone else looking for the same thing. I genuinely want to find an older man that I will love and share my life with. I want to share a physical and emotional bond with him. If you're looking for a quick hookup then go for it. I'm 19 and know that I'm not looking for anything short term. It seems like a lot of people like doing quick hookups for sex but then again, I'm not too experienced in this."
gayyoungold,2ixffp,Whitedragon2,2,Sat Oct 11 07:19:45 2014 UTC,Without more information it is hard to say.  My go to answer is sex drive but I didn't even come to terms with being gay and wanting older guys until I was 20.  I def did a bunch of hook ups at first so I assume if this is early on in the 17 year olds exploration I'd say its sex drive.    But really who am I to judge?  If the two of them are happy and enjoying life together then have at it.  Maybe its something more and both will realize it the more time they spend together.
gayyoungold,2ixffp,biggguy,1 point,Sat Oct 11 16:20:50 2014 UTC,"Could be sex drive, could be actual attraction, could be searching for a father figure. As you already realized, without context it's pretty meaningless."

gayyoungold,2ixgmo,Whitedragon2,4,Sat Oct 11 07:11:07 2014 UTC,"First off, the title to your post...might be off putting to some people.  I was nervous even clicking on this TBH X-D  But since you asked about having children while in a intergenerational relationship, I have 2 kids with my husband of 10 plus years.  We adopted our children after about 4 years after our relationship started.  He was the one to present the idea to me (he didn't want to feel obligated to leave anything to his sister's bratty kids and also wanted to raise a child better then her kids) and while I was very nervous if I could be a good parent, things have worked out well.  Being a parent has been a lot of fun at times, but also a challenge.  Like right now both my kids are in the dog house for missed homework and attempting to take over our cell phone account (that is a long story for another time).  But there are times like playing video games together, playing chess, teaching them how to raise our dogs, and seeing them accomplish goals that its truly wonderful being a parent.  Our age difference has never been an issue to our kids.  To others is has.  A few times in public people have mistaken me for also being one of his kids.  I'm in my early 30s now so I guess I could see people making that mistake, but I look nothing like the 3 of them.  They are all Hispanic and my pale-as-a-ghost skin makes me look like the odd one out, haha.  But at home, I know I'm the one enriching their lives and helping them become good people so stuff like I said doesn't get to me, usually.  If it dose my husband always sticks up for me by correcting the person or comforts me at home later saying I'm a great dad and these kids are doing better in this world in large part due to my help and that he could never do this without me.  He means every word of it...and it really dose help =)  The issue of us being gay has been something the boys dealt with.  Of course they were afraid to reveal to their friends they had same sex parents so we never pushed them to.  They have a whole set of other issues to deal with after going through the foster system so this pales in comparison to some of their emotional trauma.  Hence why we leave it up to them to decide who to tell.  But our kids know that neither I nor my husband will deny being the spouse of the other so they keep their circle of friends small and tight knit.  The oldest has been with us 7 years now and the younger one has been with us for 4 years so both are at different stages of bonding.  The older one has pretty much forgotten or shut the door on the past before living with us and has a great relationship with our entire family.  The younger one is almost there but at times a desire for their sister bubbles to the surface and we must deal with it.  The younger ones siblings are younger and both families have a do not contact order so its a bit hard for them to deal with.  We show lots of love though and push our kids to be great so they know what good parents are and that the family we have built will always be there for them.  But being the youngest in our house has certainly been a change for the younger one.  We are strict and BOY did we have some clashes for the first few years.  Thank goodness for therapy...  I'm sure I could ramble on but I think you get an idea of how things are with us.  I think we are kind of unique situation as I haven't seen many in this sub mention having kids with their partner.  For a bit more about us check out this previous post by me: http://redd.it/2bc8kw"

I'm really glad that you and your husband are living happily with your children. The whole reason I was asking this was because it is a unique situatuion.

I did feel it was a bit soon as I wanted more time with him before starting a family life but things worked out.  I should mention that when I am out alone with my oldest I get some shocks because people will do the math and I think I had my son when I was like 16 or 17 LOL.  Sometimes its fun to roll with it."

I don't exactly see a set in stone qualifier for these things but if I had to choose one it would be that of inter-generational lines. The difference between 20 and 30 isn't as large as say, 20 and 50, but it's still a significant gap. Anyhow, I'd much rather include someone than exclude."

gayyoungold,2isyu4,newageoutlawguy,3,Fri Oct 10 05:29:07 2014 UTC,"i don't see any reason that you wouldn't be ""qualified."" other than the fact that i hate that gay men see anyone over 30 as ""old"" but that is a completely separate issue. i am pretty sure that i have seen posts from guys who were in relationships where one was 18-20-is and the partner was in their 30's (and ones where the younger man was in his 30's and the older partner was 50+.) i didn't create this subreddit, but for me it represents a place for support and discussion of men who are in cross-generational relationships, whatever that means to you."
gayyoungold,2isyu4,PirateCodingMonkey,2,Fri Oct 10 12:33:09 2014 UTC,"I feel the same way. The other day, i was thinking to myself, ""I have to wait 15-20 more years for younger guys to be interested in me..."" Is there a group for not so old & younger men?"
gayyoungold,2isyu4,jay4812,1 point,Fri Oct 10 17:11:56 2014 UTC,"32 is young, don't let ""the gay community"" push you into an early midlife crisis. You can still be a daddy or date younger guys though. It's mostly a mentality, and not anything actuall specific. It's really silly that there's all these terms and stuff for being gay. IF you were straight you probably would just try to date younger people without caring about labels outside of concerns of younger/older dating. It does make it easier to talk to and meet up with people but it gets REALLY convoluted. Just have fun, date some guys younger than you if that's what makes you happy."

Are you looking forward to being there when he needs you? Do you trust him with your heart?  There aren't black and white answers to any of those, of course.

I immediately tried to oops it back in, but he chuckled and sheepishly said he was getting those same urges. We moved in with each other about 8 months later. That was almost 7 years ago.  So, yeah, no rules. If you feel it, you feel it. If you want to say it, you say it. Play it by ear, and remember you can say all sorts of things that lead up to the word itself, like ""I'm really loving the time we spend together and hope there's more of it"" and so on.  In any case, enjoy those early days of exciting tinglies! It's certainly a sensation not everyone gets in their lives--cherish it! Keep a journal! Take pics! Yadda yadda!"

gayyoungold,2il2wl,GiveMeDaddiesPlease,4,Tue Oct 7 19:02:41 2014 UTC,"The best thing to do here is to have a talk with him about these issues as he's probably wondering the same things.  It sort of seems to me like you're not ready for a relationship, especially looking at that last statement you wrote. If this guy is saying that he'd rather be with you than continue with life as he's known it, he might be looking for something more long term and probably monogamous. You're not going to know until you talk to him."
gayyoungold,2il2wl,youyouyuyu,2,Tue Oct 7 19:11:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I was waiting to talk to him in person about these things but the opportunity to meet at all hasn't arisen, and I can't see it arising in the near future.   He never mentioned stopping his life or activities for me, and I would strongly disagree with him if he did. What I meant by that was that he wanted to spend more time with me, not that he wanted me to take over his life haha"
gayyoungold,2il2wl,GerontoMan,3,Tue Oct 7 21:55:53 2014 UTC,"You've known him for a little more than a month, don't worry about betraying his trust. You haven't signed a contract and nether has he. I say, go with the flow.   Do you think your parents would disown you/not support you if they knew you were gay? If so, keep it secret - milk them for school and GTFO. If they are cool, you're going to have to come out sometime. They will wonder why you haven't brought anybody over to meet them. Those sorts of things are better done sooner than later.   Coming out to friends & family is something I've only done in the last 2 years. I didn't realize it before but keeping it all hidden was limiting my ability to grow emotionally as a person. I thought, well who cares, it's my business - they don't need to know. Upon coming out, I've realized that doing so had nothing to do with them but all to do with myself. My unwillingness to hide anymore.   You're still 17 - so this isn't that big of a deal. Hell, you will still probably change a great deal in the next few years. Experiment safely. Chill!  Don't needlessly tie yourself to a man you barely know before you've had the chance to really experience these things.   Something I should have probably payed more thought to, when I was 17 - was the fact that many men you meet at that age are not looking to marry you. I'm not saying that all men don't want a long term relationship. Some of them don't know what they want - some of them do - but it's just sex. This is something you'll probably just have to see for yourself to understand but try to understand the difference between love and lust.   When you're young (and/or) desperate, it can be very, very easy to get the two confused. Try to be self-aware, friend!  :-)"
gayyoungold,2il2wl,GerontoMan,1 point,Tue Oct 7 19:49:16 2014 UTC,"Thanks! Going with the flow is pretty much what I've been doing,  and it seems that's what he is doing too. Pretty much nobody in my life at the moment would have an issue with me being gay as far as I know, apart from the few people who I avoid anyway. I'm waiting until I am out of school and into college where I can have a wider control on the people I spend my time around until I come out. Better safe than sorry I guess! I deliberately used the word feeling instead of love, lust etc. in the post because I know I probably don't have enough experience to understand or recognise. I just know that at the moment I'd like to spend some time with this man! :)"

I was just going back in time and thinking of myself when I was 17. I found myself in one long extremely drawn out version of confusing lust for love. If I had been able to recognize it for what it was - I would have saved myself a ton of grief.   There's nothing wrong with short term things - just so long as both parties are clear. Given that we are the younger parties, we are often the ones who don't fully understand that. I guess in shorter terms, maturity in age does not equate to emotional maturity nor does it mean they'll have all of your best wishes in mind.   I guess I just want people on here to be careful - that's all!  Have fun! Come back and post sometime, we can always use regular posters!"

I am not calling you a slut.  This book will go into details of how to carry on a partnership, honestly and openly, with someone when you're interested in experimenting. I appreciate that you're only 17, but if you intend to have a relationship that's satisfying to you and your man, you have a lot of emotional exploration and thinking to do.   I'd also take a course in communications. Seriously."

gayyoungold,2i7fg9,foxboi84,2,Fri Oct 3 17:38:32 2014 UTC,"So, I am about to turn 30 myself, and when I was younger, say 16 through about 26 I found myself attracted to men older than myself.  And I was looking for men at least 20 years older when I was looking for a partner sexually, and I always wondered the same thing, so I can relate.  The one thing that I will say is that sexuality and who you are attracted to is a fluid thing - it will change over time.  I know you may not believe that now, but as you grow and age, the things that your mind and body are attracted to will change.  Simply to use my own life as an example, where I started out only being attracted to older males, (and spending a large part of my 20's in a relationship with a man in his 40's for almost six years) I am now about to turn thirty, and find that my attraction to people is much more my age group.  And when I look at porn, all of those pictures of 'twinks' and such tend to turn me on a lot more than they did when I was younger. Don't get me wrong, I still find daddy's and bears and older men hot, but I am more expansive in what I find attractive.  Not saying of course that that will be the case for you, but just keep an open mind.  You don't have to worry that who you are attracted to will always be that same age gap older than you.  As you grow and mature more and more, you will find exactly what your heart desires.  Just listen to your instincts.    (Also, I would just like to point out, because you will feel this too someday, that even though I am 30, I don't consider myself an older man....I still drink and party and think like a 21 year old, and someday I know you will too.)    The most important thing to remember is that your sexuality -will- change over time, whether that is the age of men that you are attracted too, or any other variable.  Don't be afraid of it, embrace it.  It is part of who you are."

One of my friends hadn't had sex with anyone under his age until he was 35, the primary reason being that he wasn't attracted to anyone who wasn't significantly older than he. One very persistent youngster finally got him to think outside the box. It helps that the youngster was fucking hot.   Another friend is content with the age difference between he and his longtime companion...30 years.   Another friend finds a certain age 46-60, very sexy, and that's who he dates.   Another friend dates guys who are increasingly older.  From my perspective as the older guy: my primary attraction doesn't seem to be dependent upon age, but rather someone's activity level and athleticism."

These are the things that help him confirm and feel that he is desired. You shouldn't hold back expressing your love for him because others might think it's weird. Put him, and yourself, before what others might think."

gayyoungold,2i6799,malwin10,3,Fri Oct 3 17:04:11 2014 UTC,I hold my partners hand in public but I still get kind of nervous when kissing him in public because I don't want to draw too much attention.  I think it's just something that you have to get used to. I know I was nervous to hold his hand in public for the first time but now I don't really mind. Fuck what other people think. That's what I say lol.

If you guys want to so affection in public go ahead, screw what other people think.  My husband and I don't really feel comfortable being affectionate in public, we will hold hands sometimes and will def kiss if we are saying goodbye (like at an airport or train station).  I have felt never ok with being all lovey dovey in public with anyone I have dated (including woman when I was much younger) but in private I'm so huggy wuggee I may given my husband diabetes because I am so sweet on him.  My husband feels the same way so it has not been an issue with us.  Talk to your SO about what he would be ok with and go from there."

gayyoungold,2i6799,Segay,1 point,Fri Oct 3 17:04:27 2014 UTC,It personally depends what you and your partner decide. I remember I was at the beach once and a younger and older man were holding hands then they kissed. A lot of people said that they should be ashamed and that it was gross. Even though they got all these negative remarks; they were still happy and smiled. That's the most important thing. You just need to do what makes you and your partner happy. It's not hurting anyone else so you shouldn't have to care about what they think about you.

My partner and I met when I was 18(he was 63) and he was the first person I had sex with. But a few years down the line I felt like I wanted to experience another guy. I didn't want to end our relationship so I ended up having a one night stand. He found out and we ended the relationship for a month but ended up getting back together. We are still together now, (I'm 25, he is 70 in Dec) but he does let me go and see other guys as long as he trusts them. He also likes to join in sometimes as well :P"

We both realized long ago that we both are far too jealous to allow the other to sleep with another man.  Plus we both believed that if you found that one great person to spend your life with that it would be a monogamous relationship.  I'm sure it would be a monogamous relationship.  It's not like either of us didn't try having an open relationship in the past before we met.  We both have tried threesomes before we meet each other and funny enough we both didn't like it.  I mean in the moment wow it is hot, but that feeling afterwards; nope not for us.  I even had fun screwing around with like...4 other guys at once one time and while the attention was great, I just didn't feel great about it afterwards.    We both were also cheated on by our previous BFs before we met so that might something to do with it as well.

You just need to do what makes you happy without hurting anyone else. So for me, a monogamous relationship would be the thing I would want.

He gets to see the world all over again through my eyes, gets to see what it's like to do the things he used to do alone as a couple, etc.    If you're lucky, your partner feels the same way, and no matter what you end up doing, he'll enjoy it more than he ever has because you're there with him, this time."

One of the primary reasons that I'm so attracted to him is that he wants to experience all sorts of things that we both find intensely interesting - except with me. We had an amazing summer fling that is turning into a dating relationship. Nothing's off the table. Hiking, camping, snowboarding, dining, traveling are all part of the deal. So many guys my age can't keep up or are nesters. I'm not. But I sure as fuck enjoy his company, his eagerness, his ability to equal me when it comes to enthusiasm, and his ability to open his heart to me. Count yourself blessed because I bet he does as well.  I know I'm a catch but so is the boy I'm dating. ...and we have an amazing physical relationship too.  (M45/M23)"

And romanticizing the past is not limited to those who have lived though it.  Don't compare, identify.  Look at who your partner is, today, and ask yourself what you can do to make the bonds between the two of you stronger, despite the differences in experience.  Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but of looking forward in the same direction.  Sappy, I know, and I can't tell you who I stole the quote from, but I need to remind myself of that sometimes.  Being attracted to people very different from myself is, in my opinion much more of a blessing than a hindrance.  Altering the direction of my focus becomes a necessary part of love."

gayyoungold,2hz2cb,luv2diaspora,2,Wed Oct 1 10:40:46 2014 UTC,"So true.  I'm 68 and looking for a young man to share life with, but on the other hand he needs life experiences that I've already experienced.  It would be very easy to find a fine boy and try to dominate his life but it wouldn't be right.  The flip side is that I don't need to re-experience some aspects of my life.  I am still discovering and doing things that involve calculated risk, but young men tend to avoid some things that are physically demanding, don't involve drugs or video games or are ""scary"".  So I too, am in a little bit of a dilemma.  My passion and respect for young men is absolute, firm and respectful but the differences are bumps in that road.  I am still looking for a young lover.  I should explain ""life experiences that I've already done"";  I do not need fist fights, car wrecks, war/military, terrible decisions, being victimized, cancer, marriage/divorce, broken bones, surgery and things like that.  They are going to happen to most of us, but I'd rather not go there again.  I'm happy with hard physical workouts and work, road trips, nude runs, making new friends-cautiously, a new vehicle, working on the house and property, backpacking hunting trips and the like.  If he's out there, I hope to meet him."

Honestly, it is what it is, you're attracted to what you're attracted to. I've been seeing a 42 y/o guy lately and honestly its amazing. I have no fucking clue how I'm going to go about telling my friends and family but I'm enjoying it for what it is. My advice, do what makes you happy and don't worry about what people think. Yeah, its going to be difficult telling my family that my SO is way older than me but, like I said, it is what it is.   There's a ton of great, older gay men that'd love to have a younger partner. I say go for it if you're up for it. I used Grindr to find my guy and it worked out pretty well.

From the month that I've used the app I could probably count on 1 hand the amount of times I've just been blatantly asked if I want to have sex. 95% of the time its good conversation with good people. Doesn't hurt to at least give it a try!  Edit: If you have any specific questions feel free to PM me. After reading your comments it sounds like I was in your identical situation about 4 months ago.

I just recently came out about my bf to my family, and my parents know knows my bf.  They said - they're not oK with me being gay and having a bf, but they're OK with my bf, because he's so caring to me. The overall feeling is of acceptance, and we go next year with the whole family (sisters and their husbands and kids) to holiday together.  So i think it depends if your BF prove himself to your family, and if your family OK with the general Idea of being gay and alternative forms of relationships."

The only issue is that many older guys are not comfortable with being seen with younger men and are just looking for one-time discreet hookups.  On the other hand, some of us have always enjoyed associating with younger, are loyal and not-controlling and aren't all that concerned with some ridiculous social ""norms"".

I understand that it will be harder for me to be in a relationship since I haven't been in a relationship yet or even kissed anyone for that matter.

Well, its taken a few years to understand but i am attracted men older than I. And now im okay with it.   Every time an older guy figures out that i feel the same way as they do to me, they are ecstatic. Its common for there to not be a lot of guys who feel the same way.

I said to him that it's not definitely going to happen but I think we both knew we were going to do it. We kissed for a very long time before we stripped naked. I sucked his cock for while to get him hard. He then put me belly down on the bed and rimmed me for a while and it felt great. He then started fingering me as I lead there on my belly. I stayed belly down while he put the condom. Then he got on top of me, I could feel his cock resting against my butt hole. After some probing he finally pushed his cock in and I'm not gonna lie.....OUCH!! I let him rest there for a bit while the pain subsided. He then slowly thrusted deeper and it actually started to feel good. He didn't last very long but it was still really fun and not as painful as I'd imagined. Being on my belly I think might have helped ease the pain and so far is our favourite position.  Thanks for all the help guys :)"

gayyoungold,2hok9n,rxshea,2,Tue Sep 30 02:14:10 2014 UTC,"Teachers and school administrators (ex: principal) were the ones who caught my attention in my younger days.  None of my friends parents were that attractive to me...wait no, there was one I forgot about him until just now.  On the short side, in shape, no belly just a nice stomach, and a few grays.  But the ones who I really liked had a bit of a belly and def had salt n pepper hair.  Plus I think people in positions of power are soooooo hot which is funny because in high school I was a total punk who didn't listen to authority."
gayyoungold,2hnrtb,joshuanone1,5,Sun Sep 28 00:43:34 2014 UTC,"28 yo happily married to a 66 yo man. I also research LGBT aging. Congrats on receiving positive support from your family. May I ask why your wife wants to continue the relationship? There is a new body of research exploring the effects of coming out late in life on social networks. In a nutshell, it is not the individual that comes out but the entire social network. Some embrace the process and others can't due to many factors. And there are multiple cases in the literature of opposite sex couples remaining married after one comes out, so know that you are not alone. I could keep going but I digress. Good luck on finding your balance in life and have fun exploring your sexuality."

gayyoungold,2hnrtb,FredericChopin,2,Sun Sep 28 10:17:23 2014 UTC,That is why I love this subreddit. Bc it is rare to find other relationships with an age difference greater that 20 years outside the interwebs.

We also decided to stay together but separated when, nearly four years later, I fell in love with a man (and he with me). My ex-wife and I remain good friends. Leaving the relationship has had pluses and minuses. It would have been much more difficult if my wife and kids had not been understanding and supportive.

gayyoungold,2hnrtb,itsaqueerlife,3,Sun Sep 28 03:28:30 2014 UTC,"My wife , at the age of 73 feels that she wants to continue with our relationship, after 42 years because at her age, she is not interested in looking for another partner.  Also, we do love each other.  The physical part of our relationship has always been there.  Gay men can be sexually active with women.  Being gay is not just about sexual attraction, but also about emotional attraction. I can tell you a lot about the ""outing of a social network"".  I have told my brother and my mother, both of whom, surprisingly to me, have been extremely supportive.  Outing myself is outing my wife and so we talk about everyone I tell, before I tell them. We agree together to include new people into the ""knowledge group.""  I do have younger friends.  That seems to be easier than finding friends my own age.  I don't know why but it is.  These guys seem to want to find an older man who is stable 9 not rich) and can talk to them honestly."
gayyoungold,2hnrtb,ChopstickAKAJames,1 point,Sun Sep 28 13:47:04 2014 UTC,"So many parts of your comment made me smile as a person and as a researcher. Historically, identifying as ""homosexual"" usually resulted in hard breaks of social ties throughout one's social network. Now that gender, sex, and sexual minorities are slowly gaining social acceptance, there remains a lot to be explored in how social networks, and especially sexual and romantic partners, negotiate ""coming out"". Coming out doesn't have to result in a drama fueled life event that shatters relationships. But most importantly, y'all are doing your own thing that seems to be working for both despite the conventional ""coming out"" process.  Y'all keep doing y'all (as you can tell, I am a Southerner).   Personal question, don't have to answer: You stated that you identify as gay but also sexual active with your wife. Would you consider yourself bisexual leaning towards the gay end on the sexual orientation continuum?   Thanks for sharing."
gayyoungold,2hnrtb,itsaqueerlife,1 point,Sun Sep 28 16:28:43 2014 UTC,"It is true that when we come out of the closet, our families go into the closet.  I envisaged that if I did ever leave the relationship that I would be more likely to find myself with someone of similar age and experience. That has not been the case at all! It is certainly my experience that it has been easier to find younger friends than friends of my own age. It is not that I was more attracted to young men but simply that they are more likely to approach me.  There is a lot to relationships other than sex. Simple touch can satisfy 'skin hunger' even when the sexual attraction is less. (I could see myself again with a woman for that reason.) Then there is the emotional connection which we seek as gay men which is not necessarily the same as the emotional connection we had with our wives. There are many issues to negotiate."

I assume you are into older guys because your on this sub. I'm up to chat if you have questions: )  Are you onto seeing other guys? One thing I have to say is if you do make sure you let them know what you want out of your relationship, I see a lot of younger guys getting in over their heads when the other just wants a friend.

gayyoungold,2h1qru,auchentoshn,12,Sun Sep 21 17:25:27 2014 UTC,"It's just natural, for me. I can't speak for everyone, but like most people find flawless, youthful skin, a full head of naturally colorful hair, and so on super hot, I find wrinkles, greying/grey/balding/bald hair, and other features of older men really hot! It isn't for any special reason or justification that I can think of. From my perspective, I'm wondering what the attraction is for young guys (which makes me self concious at times, because I don't really naturally get what guys see as attractive in young guys).   And again, this is just for me, but I definitely look for some sort of paternal relationship with a man. I like to hear all the stories they have to tell, often from  long before I was born, and getting to know their friends is such an expanding experience in terms of friendship because i wouldn't normally meet so many interesting friends from another generation, with their own formative experiences, bands they like, etc that are so different from mine.  But physically, it's not something I can really explain any more than you can explain what you pike. I wouldn't question it if I were you, just enjoy the attention if it's mutual! It's no different than you liking younger men."
gayyoungold,2h1qru,luv2diaspora,3,Sun Sep 21 17:36:43 2014 UTC,"This might be the most accurate description I've read to date. Just as most others find features of youth attractive, I find features of aging attractive. Things like glasses, wrinkles, white/grey/naturally bald hair are all a bonus, and I just don't have any discernable attraction to younger guys."
gayyoungold,2h1qru,GiveMeDaddiesPlease,1 point,Sun Sep 21 19:56:55 2014 UTC,"Agree with this post, it is just natural for me.  I always seemed more interested in my older male teachers and administrators but it wasn't until college that I decided to act on those feelings.  I wish I had been honest with myself sooner, but being away at school made it easier to explore since none of my family or friends where near me.  After my first time I knew I was gay and that these would be the types of guys I go for.  No guy my age makes me give them as second look nor guys younger then me.  I have never dated anyone who is not at least 15 years older then me.  Sure its odd but everyone has a type they go for.  Mine just happens to be guys who have a little gray or white, a bit of belly, are much older then me, and doesn't look like they just stepped out of the pages of model magazine."
gayyoungold,2h1qru,Whitedragon2,7,Mon Sep 22 19:33:02 2014 UTC,"Physically, I like older men because I just do. It's natural for me as well. I find the features of grown men much sexier than those of my peers (I'm 19). These features (wrinkles, greying hair, aged look) are what other people view as imperfections but I find them cute/sexy. I personally think a man is in his prime after his 30's, age just looks great on guys for some reason. Some examples of older guys I like are Hugh Jackman, Anderson Cooper,Phillip Crangi, and Bryan Cranston. I would go on but you catch my drift :)   Emotionally, I feel older guys tend to be more grounded to what they want and how they act. Maturity, is the key I guess. I don't view older guys in a paternal way, but I do appreciate the stories/experiences they have to offer."

I love their guidance, their stability, their experience and the fact they seem to act as i guess guardians or at least leaders if that makes sense. someone i can look up too.  I am 6 foot so Im kinda tall and I love that with older men, I can kinda fell small. haha if that makes sense. Physically, Ive been with many men and I don't mind a little weight but ideally, Id like a fit man with a little tone. A stomach that is kinda sticking out but still fairly firm is attractive as is a broad chest and shoulders. Their i guess older skin if that makes sense with some stubble and that salt and pepper hair.I love that we can share experiences and ideas and thoughts. Im  not one of those ""born in the wrong generation"" people. In general i do like being around older people, I grew up going to a lot of events with my parents and meeting their co workers and friends so I'm used to interacting with much older adults. Ive also always been a bit of an entrepreneur Ive loved learning from older folks carries and i guess that all carries into my love life. and I'm not gonna lie, older men seem to know how to fuck and i love that. I lost my anal virginity to a 45 year old man when I was 15 and the way he was so caring and sweet with me was amazing and he took his time to teach me. Since then I've loved being subserviant to older men and pleasing them. have fun OP! I can't wait till I'm older, hopefully ill get to make some young guys happy."

gayyoungold,2h1qru,funchords,2,Tue Sep 23 01:37:59 2014 UTC,"For me, it's not so much the fact that I find older men more attractive, there are some guys my age who I find equally as attractive, it's the emotional maturity that gets me. I, for one reason or another, am more self-aware than a lot of my peers. I see so many people my age get caught up in the drama of life; the little things that ultimately mean nothing that people drive themselves insane over. Older guys tend to ignore that stuff (though not always) and they can be just as sexy as younger guys. Why settle for less?"

gayyoungold,2h1qru,BiDadFan,1 point,Thu Sep 25 17:16:59 2014 UTC,"I thought about this a lot. For me the attraction is extremely hard to explain. I think that everybody with an attraction to anybody or anything would find it almost impossible to explain too. But I think there is probably some sort of logic to it. If I were to simplify it I think femininity is about being young and innocent and masculinity is the opposite. It's about being more experienced and mature and wise.  On a physical level I think the more men age the more masculine they are, and I am attracted to masculine men, therefor I am attracted to older men. Growing up a lot of kids my age didn't have chest hair, or body hair, or beards, it was their dads that were extremely hairy and woodsmen and into hunting and taking care of their families. I hit puberty too so the difference was really noticeable.   For me personally I am going through an extremely difficult time in my life right now, I have severe depression and a lot of other issues I probably shouldn't get into. I need somebody who is emotionally mature enough to deal with the most severe depression. Having an older friend take care of me as a paternal figure is pretty amazing. I'm close friends with an older guy who does pretty much everything he can to help, he's helped me work through some of my worst days. I never really had a friend like this before. I know it's not exclusive to older people, but I think it's more common. A big thing that helps too is that older people are a lot more stable in their life which helps a lot.  The more masculine you are the more stronger you are. I think it's pretty normal to want to feel safe and protected by a strong man. Gay people in general don't have mentors, or even friends they can form some sort of camaraderie with based on their sexual conquests. You know like kids growing up in college and experimenting for the first time. It kind of makes sense that it feels more common for gay guys even if it is confirmation bias on my part. It feels like I run into people who like older guys exclusively all the time online and offline.   tl;dr: Being older makes you more masculine, and gay people love masculine guys. It's like having sex with a king instead of a prince or princess. At it's core my attraction is a very primal thing. That primal thing was probably nurtured due to circumstance."
gayyoungold,2gp4zk,thistime_neveragain,5,Wed Sep 17 21:13:47 2014 UTC,"I'll be 20 years old in 2 months, and my boyfriend is 46. I've been dating him for over 2 years now (I met him when I was 17 and he was 44, and started liking him a lot as we talked more and more - I never thought that I would fall for someone 26 years older than me, but I guess that's just how life worked out). My own family has met him, and so has my best friend; they don't have any issue with my relationship. If anything, they like him better than anyone else that I've dated.   But my boyfriend is not even ""out"" as bisexual, and he told me that he probably never will be. He says that he's not embarrassed to be seen with me or anything like that, but that he could never tell any of his family or friends that he's dating me. He did, however, say that maybe one day he will tell his daughter about us when she's old enough to understand. I have no plans of ""forcing"" him out of the closet so to speak, and I don't think that it takes away from our relationship. But there are unique issues that arise from this arrangement: openly discussing sex with girls with his friends, in front of me. Complaining to the world that he is single, doesn't have a woman to give him head and have sex with. Openly flirting with women (borderline trying to ""pick-up"") right in front of me. The list goes on.. It is upsetting at times, and I've told him many times how I feel about it but he says that ""That's just the way things are and that [I] should know that by now."" I don't think that it's fair, but I still love him.. I certainly don't want to break up with him over it, especially that it only happens maybe once a month and he always gives me a long hug and a kiss on the forehead when we're alone and he notices that I'm upset."
gayyoungold,2gp4zk,Elandiga_Varg,2,Wed Sep 17 22:34:02 2014 UTC,"I can offer my opinion.   I'm 23 and I'm a rather discreet person when it comes to my interest in older men. My family doesn't know I'm gay, mainly because 3/4 of them would never talk to me again if they knew. I've a handful of very close (older) male friends who are gay and that are kind of my mentors who offer advice on subjects such as this one.   I will say that if I was in your significant other's position, if I was really interested in you and had to tell my parents that I like older men, it would be one of the most difficult things I'd ever have to do. I'm sure it would help a lot if you were there in person so that his family can actually see who he's interested in, and to see that you're interested in him as well. Everyone's family is different, and by the sounds of it his is more tolerant of homosexual behavior. Treat this like any other situation where someone is bringing home a significant other to family. Describe your intentions (non-sexual) and assure them that their relative won't be taken advantage of.   Hope this helps."
gayyoungold,2gp4zk,GayForOlder,2,Wed Sep 17 21:47:56 2014 UTC,"I've considered this, but I think he's going to have to ""come out"" to his family without me there, if for no other reason than his comfort."
gayyoungold,2gp4zk,Whitedragon2,2,Wed Sep 17 22:12:54 2014 UTC,"Well I can tell you from my experience that not all families and friends take the news the wrong way.  My husband was the reason I came out to my family and he is 24 years older then me.  I came out to my parents first, who gave me nothing but love when I did.  I told my older brother and sister a few months later via email while away at school.  But I never told my family how much older he was then me, just that he was older.  We (my husband and I) decided it might be easier for both my family and him to slowly introduce my husband to my family.  First he came with me to meet my older brother for lunch, then he met my parents at their home for dinner with me, and finally we all gathered for a holiday where he was welcomed by all.  To this day he is still amazed how accepting my family is, but of course that also makes my family weird to him, HA!  The best was when my husband came to one of my big family gatherings for the first time.  When we arrived my god father walked right up to my husband hugged him, kissed him on the cheek, and said how glad he was to finally met him.  After that, the ice was broken so everyone started to greet him and chat him up.  He is a great talker so it didn't surprise me that he took to striking up conversations with everyone so quickly.  I think the reason it went so well was because of how happy I had become since meeting my husband.  My family saw how much better my life became after I came out to them and how I improved overall as person after meeting my husband.  I know not all families are like mine so I'm not going to tell you to expect a similar reception if you do what I did.  But if your man's friends and family see how how happy you make him, I think it makes it a bit easier for everyone to be accepting of you two.  That is, if they really love him and care about him.  I hope they do welcome you when you meet them.  I should clarify that when my husband met my family we were not married yet.  EDIT= I should mention my husband has never come out to his family and never will.  They have met me but its unspoken in his family that he and I are married with kids.  Its hard but he is not close with his family and they live far away from us so its not really an issue."

We both meshed quite well on our world views. We both were intellectuals, though our interests were nearly polar opposites.   We aren't monogamous, so nobody initiated an exclusive relationship. We did shoot around the idea of moving in together, and when the time was right, we did it. That's when I count the start of us as a couple."

gayyoungold,2g93ok,cchuckerman,8,Sat Sep 13 01:00:17 2014 UTC,"It doesn't matter what I think. It matters what he thinks.  It's really hard to find someone you can trust that deeply no matter what age they are. And there's no way to know that when a relationship starts.  You're going to have to get to know him. He'll show you how much he really cares. Someday, you'll talk about this, and you'll find he's really aware of the issue, and he's trying to figure out how to approach it too.  In the meantime, just try trusting him as much as you can for right now."
gayyoungold,2g93ok,Avunculous,2,Sat Sep 13 03:05:45 2014 UTC,"My partner and I have talked about it because it is a real concern. I am 22 and he is 56, a pretty big age difference. There will be a day where he is 80+ and we will run into some lifestyle differences. The best thing you can do is have a real talk with him and voice your concerns because honestly he probably has the same ones.

If the bond is there and the communication is both open and honest, and if the sex is good.... By all means go for it. Love is love.

gayyoungold,2fysvv,GerontoMan,5,Wed Sep 10 01:51:29 2014 UTC,"I've been through that before, believe me. Lasted for far too long and I was very bruised for a while.   You made the right decision. It's not something you'll regret. It'll be painful for awhile but believe me - you're feelings  & attachment would only grow. It's tough giving up on a relationship. I know in my personal situation - it was something I had to rip myself out of - or I probably would have eventually killed myself.   You deserve a relationship with a partner who can devote themselves to you. Somebody you don't have to sneak around with. It doesn't matter how loving they are, how honest/how close, it's unhealthy. In the rare situation where a person is capable of keeping an affair as a simple friends-with-benefits thing with no big emotional attachment - the guilt will still occur.   I can't say this enough: you did the right thing. It probably doesn't feel right now but you'll heal. I was in your shoes a few years ago and all that pain is now, just a memory."

gayyoungold,2fysvv,RustyGuns,1 point,Wed Sep 10 02:20:06 2014 UTC,"Hey man, gotta say this will be one of your biggest lessons learned. Being with someone who is already commited to their wife is always going to end badly. I am sorry that you are going through with this and can only hope you can solve it the best way possible. I had a friend who was in the exact same situation as you were in.  You need to talk to him and end it, clearly you are getting too close and he can't commit that much. Also the hiding and lying must be really hard on you and him. My buddy that had the same problem basically met up and did the normal breakup where you tell them you can't do it anymore. I suggest you break all ties because you really need to move on. Again I'm sorry and hope this is a lesson learned. ."
gayyoungold,2fysvv,Avunculous,1 point,Wed Sep 10 03:16:24 2014 UTC,"You did a very difficult thing, and you should be proud.  Remember, the pain will fade in time. Give yourself a chance to recover, some time and some quiet in which to heal.  What comes after that will be better."
gayyoungold,2fdu2e,mbarrassed,6,Wed Sep 3 19:29:17 2014 UTC,"you've met him 5 times, you've made out with him, sucked cock, and even had him top you. at this point, i think you can trust he is not out to kill you and wear your skin as a costume.  for many guys, staying over is the next step. they want more than just a kiss and fuck; they want to cuddle and feel that emotional connection (whether it leads to anything more permanent or not, waking up next to someone is nice.) plus maybe he wants to have more than one go at you - have sex at night and again in the morning.  the point is, yes it's normal. if you feel comfortable with staying there, then stay over. if you are not, simply be honest with him that you are not comfortable staying the night. he's not asking you to marry him, so do what you feel comfortable doing."
gayyoungold,2fdu2e,PirateCodingMonkey,6,Thu Sep 4 12:54:18 2014 UTC,"I think it's quite normal even for NSA sex.  Some guys get bored of a typical fuck and crave some passionate cuddles.  :D  It seems he trusts you enough to have you stay the night, so if you feel very comfortable with him, I'd say give it a go.  Waking up next to your older friend can be very rewarding!"
gayyoungold,2fdu2e,YesAn0therthr0waway,4,Wed Sep 3 20:30:58 2014 UTC,well if you feel comfortable around him why not? if you enjoy his company then what is holding you back? Have fun :)

People want sex, and people want human contact/companionship: but they don't always want a lasting relationship with that person.  Try to take it less seriously and just have a good time. You have nothing to lose :)"
gayyoungold,2fdu2e,Maple_Hill,1 point,Fri Sep 5 05:27:04 2014 UTC,"It's perfectly normal, and I say that as an older guy. There are different versions of casual sex, and anything more than completely-anonymous, bang-and-yer-out-the-door sex carries some emotional component. He wants you to stay over to cuddle and have some basic human contact and interaction. That's perfectly normal for anyone."
gayyoungold,2fdu2e,PDXHusker,1 point,Sat Sep 6 02:08:39 2014 UTC,You've gotten to know him and I'd say he's emotionally attracted to you.  Staying overnight seems to be the next step and I think you'll both enjoy it.

I am 23 and my partner is 56 (doesn't look it though). I am happier than I ever have been and he really has changed my life for the better. I hope you find that in this new guy you have met.

gayyoungold,2f7xvu,Namodacranks,18,Tue Sep 2 03:04:08 2014 UTC,"You wait until you graduate so you don't fuck up his life and land him in jail. Flirting is fine, texting nudes isn't. Then make a plan for the night after graduation."
gayyoungold,2f7xvu,pbnc,1 point,Tue Sep 2 02:25:52 2014 UTC,"so much this. even if you are 18, he is a teacher at your school. if you do anything and it gets around, he will lose his job (and in all likelihood will not work as a teacher again.) you can definitely let him know you have an interest, but do not do anything with him until you are no longer at the school.   Flirting is fine, texting nudes isn't.   i would amend this to ""flirting in private is fine, texting at all is probably not. sending him nudes is definitely out. once again, if it came out that he was hitting on a student (even one who is 18 and legal) will mean his job is done. i can't emphasize this enough. for his sake, don't go there."

gayyoungold,2f7xvu,seriouslyrelaxbro,3,Tue Sep 2 06:20:29 2014 UTC,Honestly it just seems like you are looking for a god fuck. I'll be blunt and say look outside. Don't shit where you eat or fuck where you live. Especially if you are only interested in the sex.
gayyoungold,2f7xvu,Oshi105,3,Tue Sep 9 10:35:31 2014 UTC,I start school on Thursday and I have 10 months of it.. I'll just find another older guy to fuck until I graduate.
gayyoungold,2f7xvu,PDXHusker,4,Tue Sep 2 19:34:40 2014 UTC,"Having read the entire thread, I agree with most of the other posts. This is your wisest course of action.  He'll be around after you graduate. And he'll appreciate your respect in understanding his dilemma.   Plus, the world is just filled with older guys willing to fuck 18-year-olds, so you'll have plenty of options until then."
gayyoungold,2f7xvu,waha501,1 point,Sat Sep 6 02:11:29 2014 UTC,"Yeah, hooking up with him or having a relationship could be catastrophic for both of you.  Absolutely; do nothing until you have graduated and are gone and on your own.  That you are both adults is irrelevant right now since the school policy strictly forbids relationships between employees  and students.  Extreme danger!"

We alternate between rimming and me sucking his cock and balls.  In the past he had trouble finishing when we got together. Recently I've found that if I suck/jerk him while on my knees and let him finger me, he gets hard as a rock and I can make him cum easily.

I also discovered I'm a bottom and love being his boy etc etc. It's so hot to be tied up and smacked around while me plays with my ass. I also love sucking him off. We also get into role playing modes where he is a business man or someone with authority that punishes me.   Overall he is pretty amazing in and out of bed, I'm 22 and he's 56."

gayyoungold,2eso7o,iamtheboomboomgun,3,Thu Aug 28 05:07:12 2014 UTC,"We met on silverdaddies.com in a chat room there. He lived across the U.S. but was an employee of an airline at the time so 10 days after meeting online, he flew out to meet for a weekend (told his wife he was doing a training at the airport where I lived.)  How it ended? Long story short, the culmination of the 3 years being together and dealing with his life, family, long distance, etc and him not wanting to change and be with me and just how toxic the relationship and situation as a whole was why it ended. The first year or so was incredible. I was head over heels in love with him and he was too (still is) but I just had too many blows to the heart to keep going with it.  I ended it back in April of this year.  I'm much better and a lot less miserable after I ended it. We still communicate frequently/daily only because he still needs me in his life. And he has now become close friends with my parents, which makes cutting ties with him more difficult.   I've made it perfectly clear that we are only friends now."
gayyoungold,2eso7o,GerontoMan,4,Thu Aug 28 05:23:26 2014 UTC,"Good for you. I think a lot of us here have been there, in love with a married man. Everyone deserves to be in a healthy, loving relationship with somebody that is not already devoted to someone else. At least for me, it was just a tangible affect of poor self-respect. It was certainly a larger issue than the fact that I was tangled up with a married man, but it certainly did not help my overall quality of life at the time.   It's been a few years now. I never really had any closure, I just changed my number & moved. I know it's not the bravest thing to have done but I was pretty beat up IN the relationship. It was something I had to rip myself out of."
gayyoungold,2eso7o,GerontoMan,2,Thu Aug 28 16:18:25 2014 UTC,"Right there with you man. I started to hate women. And I was just so angry at everything all the time. Once I ended it and stopped thinking about him and his bitch wife my life has improved a lot. I don't have hostility towards women anymore which I'm really grateful for. Sure, I can't stand certain women that are money grabbers. But I can now imagine myself and actually having the desire to date and eventually marry a woman"
gayyoungold,2eso7o,MASSsentinel,3,Thu Aug 28 16:47:33 2014 UTC,"I never really had any antagonistic feelings towards the man's wife. Apparently, she knew about us but that could have very well been a lie. She was basically in the same situation as me: fell in love with a man who couldn't be monogamous. That's all him. As a sort of retrospective thought: say, even if it had worked out - that he divorced his wife and we were a couple, who is to say he wouldn't do with somebody else what he was doing with me.   No judgement on those who chose to love/involve themselves with multiple partners - it's just not my thing. I know I don't have all the details but it to seems, to me, that focusing on his wife does you the disservice at not identifying the real issue. Like I said, I don't know the situation.   So you eventually plan to marry a women? Or just that you could now, as opposed to like hating women as a result of the messy affair?"

gayyoungold,2eso7o,Whitedragon2,1 point,Thu Aug 28 14:43:16 2014 UTC,"Well, before I met him, they slept in separate bedrooms. And he was rather good at lying. For her at least. She just thought I was a friend he met through the airlines (I'm in the aviation field myself)  She's the absolute worst woman I have ever known though. Very manipulative and was only using him for his flight benefits and the image of being married to a respectable man in their church. Made me sick thinking about it. Still do get sick actually.   She found out he was gay when I outed him to her via text right before they went on a family vacation for Christmas. Very satisfying ruining her vacation. Since that has happened he still flys out her about once a month because he doesn't like being with her and where he lives. I allow it even though I should know better.   Its a rather messed up situation still but it's leaps and bounds better than it was since I no longer yearn to be with him. He still intends on moving out here one day. We'll see if that happens. Once upon a time I would've moved in with him if he did buy a second home close to me. Now, I don't think I would."

gayyoungold,2eso7o,sub_woofer,-10,Thu Aug 28 20:02:11 2014 UTC,He lied about what he was doing for Christmas. Planned this whole elaborate vacation for him and his family and more or less acted like I was scum. And his bitch wife started flaunting it on her facebook page and had the gall to text me before they got on their cruise. So I told her that I've been having an affair with Her husband for the past 2 and a half years. Pretty sure she suspected he was gay but not sure she knew of us. She defintiely does now. And he had it coming. Trust me. I don't regret doing that at all.

If at that point she didn't know you two were together what is wrong with her bragging about a nice trip? The wife could be awful but it's not her fault her husband stayed with her. If he was brave (or stupid enough depending on how you look at it!)  enough to have an affair with you he should have been brave enough to end it with her long ago."
gayyoungold,2eso7o,thehogdog,-7,Fri Aug 29 19:25:07 2014 UTC,It's one thing to be excited for a vacation and sharing that with others. It's another to flaunt it on facebook. She knew what she was doing. And the cherry on top was her text to me right before she left to rub it in my face.

And I'm sure he came up with another complex lie to explain what I did. All I know is the bitch spends a lot less time with him. She is gone for weeks and weeks at a time (still taking advantage of his flight benefits) and when she returns home, it's only for a week tops. So I think that's rather humorous. She still paints her life as this amazing one on her facebook. It's pretty pathetic and sad."

I've found that for a lot of older men, overtly going after significantly younger guys can be considered taboo in many social circles and I don't know how many quality mature men would attend a mixer like this one.   If you want to meet older men, might I suggest using a number of apps like Mister, Growlr, and Scruff and contact the ones you like directly.   What also works is doing things you normally like to do but with gay groups. Like soccer? Join a gay team. Or gay book club, gay rugby, gay gamers, gay leather, gay dog owners. The list goes on and on. Have fun and you'll find daddies everywhere. I joined a gym and met my daddy there. It's such a pleasure meeting over a shared interest and a very natural way to develop any kind of relationship. I still make friends with daddies at the gym as well as at wrestling."

(gone cruising, picked up (or been picked up by) a random stranger, had sketchy sex in a gay bar's bathroom, blah blah blah...) if your reaction to that is, ""well then let's invite someone else into our bed"" you are playing into his fears.  he is concerned that you are ""missing out"" on experiences that he had. as long as he isn't pushing you to go do things, just tell him that you are happy the way things are with him. then demonstrate that. and tell him again. and keep demonstrating it. say what you mean, then do what you say."

I am personally so glad and lucky to have a boyfriend that wants me to experience the world and to really just live. To experience what life has to offer. I think it is very unselfish of him.

So, I guess you guys were apart (him at work, too, maybe?) and you contacted him and asked him to take a pill so he'd be ready for sex when you both got home.  He agreed, but when he got home, he said he didn't take a pill because he didn't feel like having sex after all?  If that's the case, I can sort've understand that, because it does kind of help to have both people in the mood, and maybe he thought he'd be up for it initially, but changed his mind as the day went on.  However, calling you clingy is kind of a huuuuuge jump.  Where in the heck did that come from?  Is that something he's said before?"
gayyoungold,2e5q0p,NotRemotelyTiredzZzZ,5,Thu Aug 21 11:10:40 2014 UTC,"your post is difficult to understand, so let me try to parse out what you are saying.  you have a 40 year difference in age (not a big deal), live together, and have for 9 months (how long did you know each other prior to moving in together?) you initiate sex on the weekends (is it always you who initiates? is it only on weekends?)  so, last night, he left for a meeting. you had a hard day at work and wanted to relieve the stress by having him top you. (did you ask him before he left for the meeting? call him in the middle of the meeting? when did you ask him to take the pill?) he agreed to take a Viagra, but when he got home he said that he was not up for sex. you got annoyed and you had a fight.  1) it sounds like he did tell you that he wasn't up for it when he got home. when was he supposed to tell you if not then?  2) you say that he referred to your behavior as clingy. is this something new? if so, it is probable that in the heat of the argument he said something that he has been feeling for a while but hasn't wanted to say for fear of hurting you. if that is the case, you both should sit down and talk about your relationship and what you both want and expect, including expectations for sexy-times.  3) is he always the top when you have sex? does he always require Viagra to get/maintain an erection? if so, it's possible that it takes a lot out of him to do that, or that he feels inadequate for having that problem.  4) you need to realize that it is ok for your partner to say no to sex, just as it should be ok for you to say no if he wants sex and you don't. you are both individuals with the ability and the right to choose whether you do or do not engage in an activity. if you get angry or upset because he decided he was too tired, didn't have the stamina, or just wasn't in the mood, stop and think about what that says to him. it says that your feelings, moods, and needs are more important than his.  the main thing is this: you and he need to sit down together and talk about all of this. do it at a time when you are both rested and calm. talk honestly with each other. remember to listen to what the other person is saying. don't listen with the intent to defend yourself or to rebut what the other person is saying. if you have trouble doing that, ask a neutral third-person to come in and mediate the discussion."

You should definitively talk to him about this.  It might be as simple as going out for dates more. The romance and sexual aspect could come naturally from this, or you might find connections outside of sex that will strengthen you're relationship in other important areas.   I'm fortunately enough to be with someone in his 50's who hasn't had that issue much. But we only get together at most two times a week and don't live together. We talk everyday so it never feels like it's only sex. Sometimes I get insecure about things being purely sexual. I don't know why."

Things went well at first, but after a while the sex sort of dropped off and we would have it once a week on Saturdays (ie - the only day that isn't a work day or night leading up to a work day).  I resented it, but (for the most part) I guess that's what you get with an older man. I brought up the issue a couple of times but things didn't really change much. Suffice it to say, sex wasn't the reason we broke up but it is important to me.."

gayyoungold,2dtib4,Karfunkley,11,Mon Aug 18 07:01:51 2014 UTC,"the ""hook-up"" rules:   meet in a public place the first time. don't go to his place or have him come to yours. if he doesn't look like his pics, or his pics are really old (and he's changed a lot - gained 50 pounds, is 20 years older, whatever) then that should be a red-flag about him. when you meet him, trust your instincts. if he doesn't seem right or genuine, then don't do anything with him. be polite but firm. before you meet him, make sure you tell someone you trust where you are going and who you are meeting. you don't have to say, ""i'm meeting this guy and plan to let him fuck me"" or anything explicit. something like, ""i met someone online and we are meeting for the first time in person."" give them as much information as you can (email address, name, phone numbers). if you are DL, leave the info somewhere they can find it, but make sure they know you are meeting someone. if you do decide to go with him, make sure you let your friend know that as well. establish a ""danger"" code with your friend. for example, if you call or text them and say something like ""will you watch my cat for the night"" it means ""send help now!"" make it something that is plausible and that you can send without alerting the guy in case. i don't want to sound scary, but there are scary men out there who abduct and kill. it doesn't happen often, but it does happen. before you meet up, or at the very least, before you go somewhere to have fun, establish base rules for what you are willing to do with the guy. talk about what you might consider, and what is definitely off the table. also find out what his interests and ""won't do's"" are. example: ""i would like to suck your cock"", ""i would consider topping you if you have condoms"", or ""i won't do anything with restraints or bondage."" when you are done and back home safely, notify your friend to let them know that you are back and safe."

gayyoungold,2dgmx5,gaythrowaway104,19,Wed Aug 13 18:42:50 2014 UTC,"Enjoying the fact that someone takes care of you when you need help isn't a bad thing.  Everyone likes to be taken care of now and again. I think the idea of daddy issues is more that some people exclusively want to be taken care of (like a child expects from their dad). As long as you're reciprocating when you can, I wouldn't worry about it.  If he's doing all the work, all the time, you might wanna pick up your end a bit."
gayyoungold,2dgmx5,Masa45,5,Wed Aug 13 19:05:03 2014 UTC,"My daddy is the different kind I guess, he insists on taking care of me even though I can take care of myself. I did have distant issues with my father but not enough for it to be a problem of mine since ive been independent for most of my life...  I love that my daddy takes care of me, he insists that he just wants to show how much he loves me. He drops me up at work, drops food in my apartment and waits for me to be home so we can eat out, he buys things for me and rarely buys things for himself because he said he just wants to take care of me.   I guess this stems from the fact that he's a pediatrician so he is naturally good with kids or he is naturally caring about everybody. He takes care of his parents even though his other siblings can, he's just an all-around good son... and dad."

He drops me up at work, drops food in my apartment and waits for me to be home so we can eat out, he buys things for me and rarely buys things for himself because he said he just wants to take care of me.   I have severe depression and anxiety, so I can understand this really well from experience from areas outside of being in an older/younger relationship, and I also understand older/younger relationships too. Most people don't want to be completely dependant on someone else, so when someone takes care of you too much it can make you feel uneasy or not satisfied. You need to just have a talk with him and tell him that you want to be more dependant and do things on your own so you can build more self esteem and so when eventually he's no longer around you'll be self sufficient. This might sound like daddy issues but it's not. This has nothing to do with age. Many couples have really traditional gender roles. The woman worries about the cooking and chores while the man can't cook and clean, the man worries about finances and the woman doesn't know how to do taxes. Notice how the further back you go the more tradition people were, and as time progresses we want to be more modern so women, for example, are independant.  That proves it's not an age thing.  Maybe plan to take turns getting groceries, get your own car eventually, stuff like that. Basically take turns and balance it out.  With my mental health issues I have to rely on a lot of support from my friends and family and it just crushes me sometimes. There was a cracked article I read that made me realize this was going on. It talked about a family in poverty who felt depressed when someone else bought them groceries even though they didn't have any food! It can be that extreme. It's a far more broader issue than ""daddy issues"" The phrase daddy issues is a crock of shit.  If I had to say it succinctly: Having someone like that in your life is an amazing thing and you should never feel ashamed that someone wants to take care of you. You just need to talk with him about doing more stuff  to make yourself happy and dependant. ."

gayyoungold,2dgmx5,Avunculous,6,Wed Aug 13 19:19:05 2014 UTC,"Two thoughts on this:  One - being taken care of doesn't mean he is your 'daddy'. But others already explained this.  Two - 'daddy issues' is a label that is usually used out of spite. When gays see a young hot stud walking with an old men they often use that label. oh, he must have daddy issues. Which makes it sound like a disease or a fault.  What you shouldn't forget is that every attraction we have towards another person is a mix between just basic hormones and our sub-conscious being. Some of it is just pure instinct. Most gays like blonds. It's a fact. Though not many people ask the question why? Answer is easy though, a blond person has genetically speaking a higher fertility.  There is a second and more powerful force that controls our attraction. Our subconscious being is always trying to survive and doing everything to increase our survival chances. So a big part of our attraction is based on survival chances. So your subconscious is always trying to force you to go to a person that either strengthens your strengths further, or has something that you need to survive.  A dad is a powerful thing in our lives (especially for men). When we (or our subconscious) believes, notices or thinks we have missed out on the dad part of our lives, our subconscious is going to force your attraction to older man. Because somewhere in our mind we think/believe that we need a dad to survive in this world. Or at least have had a dad. Thus in order to survive your mind is going to find another dad. In other words, a big (if not the biggest) part of your (and everyones) attraction to others comes from our subconscious trying to 'heal' us.  Does this mean you can't love older men? Of course not. Cause in the end it doesn't matter who you are going to fall in love with, there is always some 'issue' behind it. It will not make you love him more or less. I have always fallen desperately in love with nerds/geek/introverts. I have long figured out why that is. But that doesn't mean I can't love my geeky (sorry) bf.   And the same goes for you. Even if you love him because a part of your soul needs a dad. Fucking go for it. He'll still give you what you need and you'll love him for it."

I've probably had to do something along these lines twice for him.  But what you described is not something that screams daddy issue to me.  Taking care of someone you care about when they aren't feeling well, are having a bad day, or are upset is totally normal so don't worry about it. If you are worried, ask your boyfriend if he feels that you are taking care of him.  If you are happy with the relationship don't go over thinking it too much.  Just enjoy the time you have together and keep the lines of communication open between you two."
gayyoungold,2dgjhb,hammanu,5,Wed Aug 13 18:12:19 2014 UTC,"How old are you? Depending on your age, it's quite natural to have some uncertainty regarding sex & sexual orientation. Attraction doesn't necessarily always manifest itself in obviously sexual ways. As an example, I was verrrry interested in my friend's father before I understood what it meant. It wasn't recognizable to me as (sexual) attraction.   For a fair length during puberty, I thought of myself as asexual (save for a clear ""fetish"" for older men, I thought). So if you're quite young - try not to worry about it too much. I am positive that you're not the ""only one"" though. I spent my entire teenaged years losing hair/stressing over my attraction to older men. I'm sure I felt like I was the only one, or something.   Do you look at pornograhy or masturbate? What do you think about while you're masturbating? I wouldn't say that a person's mental spank bank is proof of sexual orientation but it will probably point you in the vicinity.   Don't fret over it.   :-)"

gayyoungold,2dgjhb,Avunculous,1 point,Fri Aug 15 21:43:43 2014 UTC,"Not to get too graphic here, but what do you jack off to? What goes through your head when you're wanking?  Usually those are pretty good clues as to what you're looking for.  It's also possible that you're just not set up for short-term liaisons. Appearance isn't everything for most people, and for some people it's way down on the list. You may be turned on by the kinds of things that only really come out in long-term relationships; personality, caring, strength, love. Some people are really built for long-term intimate relationships.  I was always kind of confused when I was younger, because I really didn't want to just have sex with someone. I wanted to get to know them, find out what they're really like, learn about their flaws and foibles and weirdnesses. It was only when I realized that that meant I was really monogamously inclined that I started getting really comfortable with my sexuality.  Your mileage, of course, will vary."

If anyone, whoever they're attracted to, keeps looking until they've found someone honest, and considerate, and loving, and then puts a ton of effort into keeping the relationship strong and supportive, they've got a good shot at being happy in that relationship.  Everything else is just details.  Love who you love, do it honestly, do it well. People will either come around or they won't and they'll leave; it's like having an automatic douchebag filter for your life.  If people love you, they'll get past this.

gayyoungold,2d6x24,Avunculous,4,Mon Aug 11 14:29:23 2014 UTC,"You are who you are. Your attractions are what they are. You can choose to act on your attractions or not, and either choice has its own rewards or consequences. It just depends on what you're willing to put up with the most and what you seek the most.  From my perspective, I really don't care what most other people think about me. The people that are closest to me, that I value the most, my close friends and loving family members, they know me for who I am. I listen to them. I care what they think. And the fact that I'm attracted to guys roughly half my age (I'm 46 years old) is just a quirk. They know I'm a good person and they love me for who I am, proclivities and all. If they ever warned me against dating someone, wooing someone, or being in a relationship with someone, I would very, very closely listen to them and assess what they have to say. But so far, they just look at me and think that I'm a little eccentric for being a daddy to younger guys.    But I'm not going to sit here and tell you that you should do the same thing. I don't know you, I don't know what is most important to you in life, nor would I presume to tell you what your values, ethics, and desires should be.  The best I can tell you is be true to your heart. Once you know that, once you know for sure and without a doubt where your heart lies, then all you have to do is follow the compass direction its pointing to."

A big part of my maturation in regards to my sexuality was just being me, regardless of what people thought. I'd keep all my flings or boyfriends very secret for fear that people/friends/family would react negatively to it or judge me.   I'm kind of fortunate in the sense that I haven't seen my mother in years & I am in a more unique position to not give a fuck what their opinions are. That might not be so easy if they were a big part of my life & a traditional support system. Alas!   That being said - if they are indeed involved in your life (and sane), they will eventually respect you for your honesty and your desire to be yourself. Yeah - being judged (or the fear of judgment & ridicule) can be very discomforting but ultimately, you'll have to not let that get to you.

It's even more complicated when they find themselves attracted to older people (particularly in this day and age of OH NOES OLD PERVERTS ARE TRYING TO DIDDLE OUR INNOCENT CHILDREN).    I have been where you are, and I had similar conversations with my parents.  Ultimately, this came to a head with me moving out of my parents' house and driving 1000 miles to the Midwest - with an older man - to start a new life without being in their shadow.    For what it's worth, he and I have been together for 18 years now.  It's kind of a co-dependent relationship, but everyone is different.

Once he's 18 he may be screwed but he's also got an older and presumably more financially stable partner if they're ready for the relationship to progress to that point.

If you feel that strongly about him, and he about you, why are you letting that slim chance of love walk away from you?   I've said this countless amount of times in this sub, I'm in a relationship with a man on another continent. We've been together through my schooling, job changes, surgeries, illnesses, etc--just like any other couple. Any relationship is going to have its obstacles, they are things that involve work and responsibility. But for me, that's no reason to turn my shoulder when there's even a tiny sliver of hope that I'll find happiness in love. You'll spend evenings together on Skype, sometimes you won't get to see each other every weekend or so...I would kill for the ability to see my guy even every month. Don't get me wrong because long-distance is certainly a toll; college doesn't have to be completely stressful as a lot of people make it. You can still have a social life while maintaining a long-distance relationship. Just communicate.  If you ask me, you're sacrificing a chance at true happiness for convenience.

First off: We are going to need some information, like what body type and celebrity does this 55 year old man most resemble, you know, to help us think better...   Also, is he LTR oriented, or does he just like to play the field.  He was on a hook up app, but Mister seems to be a little more than a 1 night stand app.  Seems like you have only been seeing this guy for 2 months right?  It might be possible that the Indigo Girls were right in their song ""Least Complicated"" 'It isn't love, it's only something new'.  2 months is a short time to know someone and it seemed like you had only spent one weekend together before the trip, so not much physical contact.  It is VERY EASY to think 'new' is 'love'.  You really need to spend long stretches of time together to really see who he 'is'.  BUT I AM ALL FOR YOU PURSUING THIS GUY.    Any man is going to feel flattered when anyone shows interest in him.  From harmless flirting to straight up propositioning for sexual contact.  EVEN more so when a 55 year old is getting attention from an 18 year old (not to say older men are not valued members of the community, I have been in a 12 year relationship with one, just that the gay community prizes youth for some reason).  He may be buffering himself from the time that you lose interest in him and move on.  If he doesn't let you get too close he wont feel too upset when you find a newer 'new'.  I have seen this happen plenty  I know several older guys that are adamant that they don't want a relationship, but most of them are just afraid the wont ever find one at their age and it helps them sleep at night.  Sad.  Advice: 1)  Keep a watch on his Mister Account and any other dating sites he uses, you can for damn sure know he is going to keep an eye on yours.  2) Give him some space.  When you left it off was it that you were going to keep in contact, possibly see each other again, what?  Hopefully you left it with the possibility for a future in person, and at least keep in touch via the phone.  3)  Did you let him know that you are only interested in older men (I am assuming you are, I am not the least bit interested in a man under mid 50's) and that your 'golden years' at college would not be the same as Porn Videos have shown him.  Depending on where you are moving (big city? Big School?) there might be a Prime Timers club (Old guys meetings) or a Wrinkle Room (Gay Bar for older men), but even with those there might be slim pickings based on where you are going.  If you let him know you are only into older guys and that you wont be doing it in the dorm showers with Chad from the Lacrosse team he might feel a little better about keeping going.  4)  If you left it at communication (or possibly meeting again) give it a month or two at school with benign contact and then invite him to your school's town for the weekend.  Obviously get a hotel room as dorm rooms probably would not be a great place, still some hang ups in the world, but your 18 is way different from my 18 (Knew AIDS existed, no on knew how to help prevent it and there were not any drugs to help control it so I stayed in the closet for my 20's).  Take him around town and show him you are not scared to be seen with him (even if you are, grow up, this is your life, don't worry what total strangers think, who cares).  Tell him that you have missed him and you have gone out with some other men but it just wasn't the same (even if you haven't been with other guys, make him a little jealous, it works).  By then hopefully he will realize a) that he is missing you and a chance at something real, and b) you are not giving anything up but a broken heart to be with him.  A lot for you to consider.  Give us some concrete info on where you left things and what he looks like (new love, or what ever this is, is exciting and some of us like to live vicariously through others stories).  THEN GIVE IT SOME TIME.  You may get to school and fall hard for the World Literature Professor, some guy you see at the grocery store, someone you find on a hook up ap.  Or you may have no interest in any of them and still pine for Mr. 55.  Keep in mind he may move on, so if a few months in you still have not gotten anywhere, realize that it wasn't meant to be, no matter how much that hurts, and take some time and move on.  YOU are very lucky to be turning 18 and moving to a new town in the time you are.  SOOO easy to meet people on apps (even if there are a lot of flakes on them) that are in your age range/body type.  Even when I did come out in my early 30's it took me a while to find the wrinkle room in a VERY GAY city to meet older men.  BE SAFE, you dont want to pick up ANYTHING and then go back to Mr. 55 and have to inform him that you have an STD you got while apart.  Keep us updated.  Love is a great story, especially when it ends happily.  Hopefully some time will get you your happy ending."

Somewhere along those lines.  He still worries that he is 'stealing [my] best years' and worries whats going to happen later on down the line. I worry what's going to happen down the line too, after all despite my predilection for dangerous activities (motorcycle, skydiving, scuba, etc) I have a life expectancy that goes past his. that's a fact of life for all of us in this sub (who are younger).  On the other hand.... we have once chance. We aren't going to make it out of here alive so when you have the chance at happiness you better fucking grab it and hold on to it as tight as you can because we only come through this way once.  Its not easy. It takes work. Its takes trust. It takes sacrifice. And the rewards are worth more than gold. You can live in fear of what might happen or you can give a shot and see what actually will happen.   If you want to be with him and he wants to be with you, be with him and see what happens. It might explode or the rewards might be gold. No way to find out other than to try."

gayyoungold,2cwjvv,dadnme,10,Thu Aug 7 19:05:26 2014 UTC,"Agreed entirely.   I'm sure he wasn't intending to offend anybody. Before I really came to terms with my sexuality - I could relate. It's hard to meet people in your day-to-day life if it's not clear to anybody that you are gay. At this point in my life though - I wouldn't have told anybody that I was gay, so it's really no surprise that I'd have trouble finding a relationship!  At one point I was pretty adamant about ""just being myself"" and that I didn't want to be defined by my being gay. Still - I think it's important that gay people be proud enough to be honest and open. That way, future generations won't necessarily grapple with the same issues.   In the past, it was crucial for not just your career but possibly your life - that people not know your sexuality. Now - not so much. I didn't really know how much of my life was repressed because of my insecurities regarding my sexual orientation until after I came out.   :-)"
gayyoungold,2cwjvv,GerontoMan,5,Fri Aug 8 04:06:10 2014 UTC,"It's hard to meet people in your day-to-day life if it's not clear to anybody that you are gay.   Thank you, this is what I was trying to say. I know that for myself with school, work, and sports keeping me busy it's tough to meet an interesting guy.   At one point I was pretty adamant about ""just being myself"" and that I didn't want to be defined by my being gay.   This is what I'm struggling with now, unfortunately. I find myself over thinking  things about my sexuality, especially when I'm around my friends from high school and family. One day I feel confident enough to come out to them, and other days I second guess myself and I end up doing nothing."
gayyoungold,2cwjvv,SpikeNLB,7,Fri Aug 8 14:13:53 2014 UTC,"Hopefully in time his older friend will better educate him as to history of the LGBT community and those flamboyant, purse-wearing guys with a lisp who led the fight for the equality and civil rights that he enjoys today.  While I suspect he meant no insult, his ignorance and mindset that led to such a statement is unfortunately typical of most gay teens and 20somethings that I have met."

gayyoungold,2cwjvv,dadnme,0,Sat Sep 27 00:50:34 2014 UTC,"I am out and while I do agree that OP came off quite gauche, I still agree with him.   Why not just say ""I'm offended"" rather than coming off as an arrogant arbitrator? I mean for fuck's sake, your flair or whatever it's called it states ""young but mature."" It might as well state ""I'm a special snowflake here to tell you why I'm right and you're wrong."" You never even addressed OP's topic, but only delivered your self righteous attitude for all to see. If for one second you think that it's easier for gay men who are out to meet other men than it is for a straight man to meet a woman, you're in denial.   Statistics are not in our favor. According to a recent study by CDC, less than 3% of the population is estimated to be gay. Even if you want to extremely inflate that to 10%, that's still 90% of the population that's straight. Cut than in half for males, and that's only 5% of the overall population that is a gay male.  Most women who are hit on are either flattered, or brush it off. You can't say the same for a male flirting with a straight male. Imagine that happening in the workplace. That can be a career killer, not just a stigma floating around water cooler conversations for being the creep that told Jenny she has a nice rack.   Have some respect, maybe eventually you will also respect yourself.    OP basically said the equivalent of ""flaming faggot"" but you're just as bad with your holier than thou attitude. I have no interest in the stereotypical flamboyant types. It's quite a turn off for me. Does that mean I have no respect for myself because I could describe them the way OP did?"
gayyoungold,2cwjvv,seriouslyrelaxbro,2,Sat Aug 9 05:38:57 2014 UTC,"Everything is wrong with this statement not just the way it was said:   if you're not a flamboyant, purse-wearing guy with a lisp; it can be difficult to meet guys in real life.   If you agree with it, then I think you have some self exploration to do as well. Regardless of what my flair is, I am older than you think. I have lived in some of the most repressed redneck areas of the country where guys carry guns on their belts, and some of the biggest most liberal cities in the world where guys hold hands and walk down the street. I'm sorry you were offended by me acting like I know what I'm talking about. I'm not going to act differently, just so you can feel more comfortable... and you shouldn't be offended because of it. I wasn't offended by the OP, but I thought his statement was disrespectful to a group we owe respect to. I think I made that clear in my original post.  Those flamboyant, purse-wearing guy with a lisp were the first to put up a fight and stand for something and they were unwavering, and strong! In the 60s, 70s, and still today. We owe them a lot, and at least our respect. Flamboyant gays are part of us and we are in this together.   To address your and the OPs point; flamboyant, purse-wearing guys with a lisp have a hard time meeting guys too, not just you and the OP, because life is hard for everyone.   For someone to limit themselves and say they are not a flamboyant purse-wearing guy with a lisp, as if there are only two options, man... the world is so much bigger than that, and you and the OP are somewhere in-between. It's not black and white. But what really registered with me is the OPs fear of who he is and at the same time being reduced to CL, the dark seedy back channel of the Internet...     Does that mean I have no respect for myself because I could describe them the way OP did?   Take it for what you want, I say you have a lack of respect for yourself. Your not liking the flamboyant is about you being uncomfortable, not them. The flamboyant don't have to change for the OP. They are being themselves, and they can be happy and proud to be who they are. You and the OP wish they would act differently... for the same reason straight people don't like the idea of gays, it makes them uncomfortable. The flamboyant make you uncomfortable because you are afraid you will be judged with them, as gay, like them. You are afraid... Not them. Your fear is a representation of your self judgment. I think you don't have pride in being gay, and don't have pride in being yourself, and are somewhat afraid of what you being gay means to other people. It comes through very clearly in the way you write about it. Judging yourself is far more harsh, painful, and damaging than any breeder culture could ever do to you.  Be comfortable with who you are and have pride in that. I don't mean it to make it sound easy. It's a hard thing to find yourself and then have pride in that. It's hard to love yourself when half the world is telling you you're going to hell, and the other half resents you because they think you make them look bad.    Most women who are hit on are either flattered, or brush it off. You can't say the same for a male flirting with a straight male. Imagine that happening in the workplace. That can be a career killer, not just a stigma floating around water cooler conversations for being the creep that told Jenny she has a nice rack.   We are all aware of this here. We all have jobs, and we are all gay. A lot of us are out at our jobs, some of us have hit on straight guys at work, some of us have been hit on by straight guys at work, and some of us have lost our jobs for being gay. You don't have to underscore the threat we all face as if we didn't know it existed.  To be clear, your insults mean nothing to me. However your defensive nature might keep you from seeing, you started insulting me when I defended a group of people from insult... because I insulted your intelligence when I was actually addressing the OP? Defensive indeed."

Let me start off by saying the flamboyant purse-wearing guy with a lisp part was simply saying that if a guy doesn't talk/dress/act like what most straight people identify as your ""stereotypical"" gay, then it decreases the chances of someone identifying them as gay. For example, it would be a ton easier for shy and reserved people like me to approach a guy if I had a hunch that the guy is gay.   But what really registered with me is the OPs fear of who he is and at the same time being reduced to CL, the dark seedy back channel of the Internet...    Really?! I mean come on, man. Two things.  One. I have zero fear of who I am. I'm guessing you said that due to the fact that I'm not out..? Well when you live at home with your family and aren't able to provide for yourself financially yet, there's really no other way to go about it imo. You never know what people's reactions might be. I want to be in a stable place in my life when I'm ready to come out.   Two. Given your description of CL, why in the hell would you click on this post when Craigslist IS IN THE TITLE?!

Maybe you remember that, because that is what I did and said, which I had every right to do, and my actions make very good sense. You are being defensive.

I myself never used CL for meeting a guy, but I understand what you mean about the stigma associated with CL.  Still I'm sure there are others who have said (and I believe one comment did) that they met a great person like you did through CL.  The site I met my husband through is no longer around but it was def more geared towards hook-ups/one night stands.  We both started off just wanting to meet up for fun but we found such a deep connection through our conversations and emails that we decided to become exclusive shorty after our 2nd date.  One of the best choices I ever made.  I guess the point I am making is that even if the site/app has a stigma of being for those who just wanna have ""sexy time"", you never know who you will meet."

I cannot go off and advertise myself, but I do adore intimate, discreet, sensual encounters with young gay men.  Not unsafe, and not usually one-nighters, I prefer to build a friendship and enjoy all of him, more than just the sex.  CL gives me the opportunity to reach out and find younger men like this, and with some works, affords me the opportunity to weed out the sketchy unsafe people and also differentiate myself from others by being conversant, intelligent, normal and sane in my writing.  It doesn't work nearly half as much as I would desire, but when it works its fantastic and I lament the fact that it gets such a bad reputation because of some bad seeds.  By the way, as way of comparison, I have been on squirt.org and on silverdaddies.com, and CL is much, much better.  Good luck and be safe.

It's entirely possible that even though you might not realize it, it may be coming across as something he should be defensive about. You've said that you only approach the subject when you're in private, but what are you guys doing in private? Is this while you're watching tv? Getting ready for bed? When you're being romantic?  I suppose it sounds, to me, like a two part problem. The title already indicates that he doesn't want to try or perform in positions other than his back; but the bulk of your text says that sex in general is somewhat of an issue as well.   Fucking, sex, making love are all two way streets, just like communication. It might be selfish but you might want to convey to him that although he's everything you want him to be, he's not satisfying you 100% in the bedroom. You may also already know this but it might be worthwhile to ask him what his fantasies are and what he enjoys doing in the bedroom. You're already cognitive of this, but be honest while not being pushy--hell, show him what you've written here. He might understand and want to come out of his comfort zone when he realizes that you're dealing with a frustration that a little compromise can solve."

I'm not gonna show him this post, but you might be onto something with writing him a letter about this.  As I mentioned in a previous response, he has enjoyed my hand written notes more so then emails or text.  Even reading him messages out loud has gotten me better responses then messaging him.  I too also do better writing my thoughts out instead of verbally telling him.  Me being an introvert and us always talking better use writing or text is probably the way to go.  I just have to find the right time tell him.  Thats the tricky part I think.  I posted that I was thinking of talking to him tonight when he gets back from a 2 day golf outing but perhaps I should wait?  We both are busy for the next several days after today so I feel like tonight might be the best time, but I don't want to overburden him after he gets home from a 4 hr drive.  Sat might work when we are at our summer getaway place but I'm afraid we both are going to arrive home late from the afternoon BBQs we are attending and he will be too tired to chat."
gayyoungold,2cq23y,quasipaleo,1 point,Wed Aug 6 15:04:55 2014 UTC,"Hmm I hadn't considered that the sex itself was not satisfying me.  I actually thought it was the frequency of it that was the issue.  This is kind of my fault in a way because I always keep reassuring him that the sex is satisfying when we have it.  But maybe I'm not being honest with myself and therefore not honest with him.  Lately I have been doing a lot of writing both about our relationship and myself to try and understand myself and us more (plus I majored in the subject and I have let my practice of it slide in recent years).  I think that has what has lead me to posting here now.  To get some perspective from other people in similar situations.  Let me see if I can hit all the points you brought up...  When I approach him about the subject we are maybe watching TV, or I ask him to put down his laptop for a bit to talk,  or laying down in bed for the evening.  I do try and bring it up playfully when we are having a romantic moment like say a back massage or over a candle lit dinner.  It doesn't really seem to work any of those times because I think I do it too much and have kind of brought it up too much.  Well I shouldn't say any, he has had good conversations with me about this with no distractions and us just talking in bed.  But I think I end up going on too long with the subject when I should just stop, kiss him, and thank him for talking to me.  I have kind of obsessive personality, you know in case you can't tell from all the writing I do here.  Recently, when we were slow dancing in the backyard, alone, with music playing softly, I whispered in his ear to tell me what he has been fantasizing about us lately.  He kind of giggled it off and wouldn't answer.  I tried again and he kindly asked me to stop in this tone that I know is him being kind of embarrassed but also cute. Like, ""Yeah I have been but please don't push me to tell you, lets enjoy this moment because its so wonderful.""  So I let it slide. We had a fantastic conversation that night over drinks and cigars plus we made out like a new couple several times.  Unfortunately, we both had a bit too much to drink and had to end the night curled up hugging each other which while it made me happy, I so wish we had made love :-/  The next day he said he was sorry for that, the too much drinking because he too had really wanted to have sex because of how good I looked and the effort I made to be romantic.  He told me that it was really nice what I done so much so that he went ahead and ordered us nice lights to hang in the backyard so we could do that more often. That evening we did make love, but it wasn't that great I have to admit and only now looking back on it can I see that.  He was tired, we waited too late, and other stuff...but in the moment it felt great of course.  I'm a bit to blame for this because I think I kind of pressured him into making love to make up for skipping it when we were so romantic.  I should have been patient (something I'm awful at when it comes to sex) and waited for the perfect moment again.  See the problem with writing to him is I have done that, a lot, in the past. I do find it as one of the best ways for us to communicate but things have changed over the past few years and its harder to catch his attention with an email or text.  Because of husband's more demanding job and goal of winning the election this coming year to head up the charity we both belong to he is getting bombarded with emails and text everyday.  He is usually good about answering my text and I do understand that it can take time for him to respond, but some of the long emails I have written him have not gotten much of response.  Not even a comment from him, but that is usually because he actually hasn't read it yet and I make the assumption that he is ignoring it.  Hand written notes and reading out loud too him work much much better so perhaps thats the route I will take.  I've only recently tried doing both of those and it seems to make him happier when I dot hat plus he pays attention and gives me a response, usually.  He drives home tonight from a two day golf outing with my oldest (about a 4 hr drive) and I was thinking of maybe sitting down and chatting about this over whiskey.  Get him to let his guard down a bit with the drink, maybe pipe some music in that we like from my phone, light incense or candles and tell him what I said here.  That the frequency of our sex is not the issue but the fact that I only am now realizing that its not satisfying me 100%.  Ask him if he is satisfied with our love making each time, maybe ask him to tell me what he thinks I like in the bedroom, do the same for him with me telling him what he likes, talk about how I don't want him telling me to do whatever I want in bed but to tell me what he desires.  Do you think I maybe should wait a day or so before having this conversation?  Our weekend is pretty jam packed and Thurs we both have something to attend together at the charity so we will likely be home a bit later then usual.  BTW thank you for your response and seeing something that I had not noticed in myself."

And personally I cut out grains too and over 8 or 9 months I lost 70 pounds and it's stayed off for the past 5 months at least without trying. But adding in animal fats like grass-fed butter, lard, duck fat, etc. made all the difference... you are so much more full after each meal that cravings for junk disappear, at least for me they did, and to me that's a signal that the fat is really satisfying a basic requirement by the body. And I honestly think eating a nutrient-dense diet with organ meats too like liver and heart could potentially help with the BPH. I'm not at all positive for that specific condition but it's possible! I do want to make sure by high protein you mean that he emphasizes animal protein in sufficient amounts and that he's not overdoing it? Since you only need so much protein for satiety and basic maintenance and overdoing it depletes vitamin A, just something to think about. Moderating protein, eating more fat, and eating fewer but higher quality carbs (potatoes, carrots, beets, plantains, etc.) I think could really help and I can personally attest to it, and if you wanna know more check out Balanced Bites or Real Food Liz. I read the update though and things seem to have picked up for you guys but still, I recommend looking into it!   Also bacon pancakes... yes. Best combination ever."
gayyoungold,2cq23y,quasipaleo,1 point,Sun Aug 17 01:39:06 2014 UTC,"My husband's diet it a bit more complicated then my post lead on.  See, he had gastric bypass surgery about over 8 years ago (maybe over 10, I can't recall at the exact amount of years it has been).  He has gone through a roller coaster of going down in weight, then back up, and now he is finally coming down and staying leveled  The reason for it leveling now is over the last 2 years he has found a specialist who he meets with 1-2 times a month to get weighed, discuss his diet, and go over his prescribed vitamins/minerals.  What he eats is something the doctor and he have gone over to see what he needs more of, what to avoid, and what can he treat himself to in moderation.  Within 3 weeks of him seeing the specialist the first time he had more energy, got more sexually active with me, and got the rest of us in the house into paying more attention to what we eat.  Sadly he then got that BPH diagnosis about a year after things picked up plus stopped using his sleep machine so his energy level went back down again.  But he is working on it after our recent discussion so I have high hopes things keep getting better.  We even have a kid free weekend coming up that should give us the time we need to talk and be physical.  When I say proteins I do mean mostly animal protein, and most of it is organic meat with little additives to it or the animals its comes from.  His intake is more then the average person due to the change up in his stomach from the surgery and how his body now absorbs nutrients.  Plus he dose get protein from other sources such as bars, veggies, and beans.  I'm not sure about the fat thing though because since he had bypass surgery sugars, fats, and diary items have been known to give him trouble.  Sometimes a small amount will bother him (or cause him to dump, as bypass patients call it) while other ones will have little effect on him even after a few servings.  But I'll inquire what he thinks of the idea.  He dose often times after a meal still feel hungry but usually has a protein bar and greek yogurt.  The animal fats might help remove those cravings.  Thanks for the suggestion as I had never heard of this idea before."

My partner is 70 in December and we've been together for 7 years, we met via Caffmos.  It hasn't always been easy to have an older/younger relationship, I was unfaithful about 4 years ago but we worked it out and have been very happy since.  If you ever want to chat or add me on fb just drop me a message, don't know many other guys in younger/older relationships."

I think this falls into the category of a good dom needs to know what it feels like to be a good sub to learn and expand his skills. Kind of like a good top needs to know what it feels like to be a good bottom to improve his skills."
