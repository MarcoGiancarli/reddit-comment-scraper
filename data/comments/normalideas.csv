Food is a great way to replenish your energy while at the same time sustaining that oh so delicate homeostasis that we humans strive for. Food can be found most anywhere in society and at the price of some money (dictated by quality and/or quantity of the food) you may be well on the way to getting rid of that rumbling."

Ladies and gentlemen of the class of '99 Wear sunscreen  If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable Than my own meandering experience, I will dispense this advice now  Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth, oh, never mind You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth Until they've faded but trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back At photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now How much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked You are not as fat as you imagine  Don't worry about the future Or know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind The kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday Do one thing every day that scares you  Sing Chorus  Don't be reckless with other people's hearts Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours  Floss  Don't waste your time on jealousy Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind The race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself Remember compliments you receive, forget the insults, if you succeed in doing this, tell me how Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements  Stretch  Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't Get plenty of calcium Be kind to your knees You'll miss them when they're gone  Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the 'Funky Chicken' On your 75th wedding anniversary Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much Or berate yourself either Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's  Enjoy your body, use it every way you can Don't be afraid of it or what other people think of it It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your own living room Read the directions even if you don't follow them Do not read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly  Sing Chorus  Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good Be nice to your siblings, they're your best link to your past And the people most likely to stick with you in the future  Understand that friends come and go But a precious few, who should hold on  Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle For as the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young Live in New York City once but leave before it makes you hard Live in northern California once but leave before it makes you soft  Travel  Accept certain inalienable truths Prices will rise, politicians will philander, you, too, will get old And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young Prices were reasonable, politicians were noble And children respected their elders  Respect your elders  Don't expect anyone else to support you Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse But you never know when either one might run out  Don't mess too much with your hair Or by the time you're 40 it will look 85  Be careful whose advice you buy but be patient with those who supply it Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past From the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts And recycling it for more than it's worth  But trust me on the sunscreen"
