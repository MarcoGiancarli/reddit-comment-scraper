Brawlhalla,3e2n83,DogWalk13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:08:05 2015 UTC,"Hattori currently is pretty weak. The meta is sort of favoring High force and guns and Hattori has neither. She has trouble against most characters right now since her kit just can't stack up against faster signatures from some other characters like Cassidy, Scarlett, or Lucien. Idk about Thatch being S tier either since he can't take much damage in general and also due to his start up times for some signatures being nerfed. However, he's still fantastic so I'd say A+ probably. Lastly, Nai is not in a bad spot right now, in fact she was more or less brought in line with the other legends and, if played properly, can still be a huge force to contend with. Foda just took 1st place in the rankings AND in the ESL cup last Sunday with only Nai."

Not to mention I have made a friend who I would never have meet without the game. Finally the game can go into so much depth with the different weapons and I can always find new ways to play that I enjoy.

Brawlhalla,3e42uk,thedoggeh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:18:57 2015 UTC,"You could absolutely get to gold without a main but it's gotta be more difficult than having a main. When you main a legend you learn the legend inside and out, even top players are learning new strategies with their mains. Its gotta be extremely difficult to understand 14 different legends on a competitive level."
Brawlhalla,3e42uk,eleetpancake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:46 2015 UTC,"I'm low gold. See flair. And I'm slowly rising and improving. It's definitely more difficult, but switching to randoming actually boosted the rate I got better. A while ago I played Nai exclusively and hit a wall low silver. Since I started randoming, I've been rising fairly consistently."

One thing I remember from a few years back is the 40-40-10 split of TF2.  40% of your potential comes from your mechanics. Being good at aiming, moving, and more. 40% comes from game sense. Reading the map and knowing when and why you should act. And the last 10% only appears when both aspects synergize.  The same could be said for this game. 40% for knowing your own character. 40% knowing the others. 10% from using both.  edit: I'm a dumbass, my memory didn't have the right numbers. It's 45-45-10."

Brawlhalla,3e42uk,_Cha0s,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:04:24 2015 UTC,"I mean, Raidhyn is one of the best players in Brawlhalla and he didn't pick a main until very recently. I main Hattori, but I can play almost all characters and go random pretty often."
Brawlhalla,3e42uk,bluetiger6001,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:44 2015 UTC,"As long as you have the skill, you can make it all the way up to any rank. However, having a main helps since you can learn the intricacies of certain characters after you play them for so long. However, there's really no reason not to play random as a couple players broke through the top 100 by doing just that IIRC."
Brawlhalla,3e42uk,UGotFrohned,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:11:24 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing about having a main is decision making. When things come down to a split second to figure out what to do next, knowing exactly what options you have available to you is the difference between success and failure. Different legends have different hitboxes, reach, startup lag, end lag, etc. It's difficult switching legends constantly and getting a masterful grasp of all those intricacies."

Brawlhalla,3e4kr0,IshThe2nd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:04:47 2015 UTC,"Advice? Punish. Any player that spams Sigs becomes easy to read, and you need to bait them and punish. This is the difference between playing the game and playing the player, which is SO important. I can't even begin to explain why you need to learn it. In fact, I doubt anyone can get beyond Gold5/Plat1 without learning to play the player, not the Legend.  I'm a Plat Cassidy main, and I can hold my own. I beat a lot of people... but people like Tybo, Kratos, Flesh, ETC start reading my spam patterns and punish accordingly. They know mechanics well enough to start playing the mental game, read me based on spammy patterns, and punish me for it.  I'm not saying it's easy. I'm not saying it's fun. But if you want that Diamond rank, that is what's holding you back. Spam players are predictable. They spam... so bait them into a spam, and punish accordingly."
Brawlhalla,3e4kr0,Zechert,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:24:29 2015 UTC,"i actually hit diamond today and dropped below that.  i have also beat people who have pretty high ranks and lose to them more. my entire point is simple. the sigs are unbalanced, and the damage needs looking into.  im not just some low level player complaing, im a top 100 player saying what i noticed about the game"

Brawlhalla,3e4kr0,thedoggeh,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:24:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a problem with spammed signatures or gun Sairs. Is it unfun to play against? Sure, and I totally agree. However, these strategies are totally beatable with some patience and some reading. Odds are they'll use the same sigs in predictable situations and you can dodge in or up or where ever and counter their move, then punish them for spamming moves with recovery times.   Some signatures and moves need changing, I agree with that too. Lucien Ssigs as one example. But until then, just providing your feedback to the devs is the best you can do outside just learning to counterplay and anticipate those moves.   Basically, just try to play safer, get your attack ranges down, and get your hits a bit more precise so you can out range those sigs with your own moves."

For a little sneak peak to me & Raidhyn's tier list coming soon:  Coming in as our last A+, Thatch made his way to the top of this tier list by sheer power alone.

Long combos maybe but long combos without airgame how woud it work And you still need knock out potetial   I dont see it working but maybe  someone has a idee
Brawlhalla,3e2t2n,Xenatra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:52 2015 UTC,"Well, in terms of range, the range would be larger than unarmed, as you can add spark effects with the swings which essentially let the devs create a bit of range for something like boxing gloves. In terms of getting in to do damage, I would expect plenty of quick, low codlin attacks, with fast gap closing moves which would be difficult to punish. Also, the weapon doesn't need to aggresive, it can actually be quite passive, waiting your time to punish, where you close the gap and hit a crap tonne of damage."
Brawlhalla,3e2t2n,xKholly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:30 2015 UTC,Just think playing against a gun legend. It would be impossible to play against. For this the developers should create some animation to get more range with gloves. As you said.

Most low rank players use her to rank up fast because she has too much speed and low rank players don't know how to play against and avoid her movements and attacks.  In my honest opinion she is an easy legend, good for players who are starting to play the game. In addition to his high speed she has 1 dash-attack with sword and 2 ""teleport-attacks""; 1 with sword and 1 with spear. Guys, he is totally impossible to hit, mostly if the player is also good with her.  If there is a good player playing Hattori he will never get hitted by the enemy. I'm a plat 1 player but everytime I play against Hattori with a any legend I always get my ass fcked up by her speed.  It 'also true I can't play high speed legends, like Lucien, very well. Actually my 2 main are Thatch and Scarlet.  As Thatch I have a 50 - 50 chance to win using guns and sword (2 fast weapons) but with Scarlet I have to focus myself at 100% because is so hard playing against Hattori, using hammer and rocket lance (2 ""slow"" weapon) and just in rare case I win the game.  Maybe you are thinking I'm a raging player who gets is ass always fcked up by Hattori's players, maybe you are right, maybe not but is always beautiful when I rekt them when they know that Hattori is an easy legend; because they know it, and after they start randomly to flame me.

Brawlhalla,3e0mfc,Tho76,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:23:48 2015 UTC,"Basically, the hammer wants to Stomp -> SAir you (of you don't know any terms, just ask. Just going to assume you do for now). The trick is that it's not very good on the offence, and this is even more true for Scarlet. She hits hard, but slow. Also, the stomp is ground only and limited area - jumping and staying clear is smart. I imagine playing against a Scarlet like fighting against a guy with a big 2 handed sword. You can dodge and dance around it, but get caught and yer fucked.   So:   Attacking from the air is good, but be careful of the SAir.  Long reaching attacks (Lucian's Guns Side Heavy, Vraxx Lance Down Heavy) Speedy Light attacks to evade punish   If you have any questions, go ahead and ask!"
Brawlhalla,3e0mfc,Tho76,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:02:00 2015 UTC,Thanks! I've been playing a lot of Vraxx and I never realized how good his Lance Down Heavy was.  If I'm supposed to be careful of SAir I should use the pistols (on Vraxx) to attack vertically right?
Brawlhalla,3e0mfc,JustGabriel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, using the DLight into SLight combo is a really good idea when she wants to stomp. Be careful though, she can hit you with a NHeavy with the hammer and like I said, it hurts.   The thing about the Lance DHeavy is that it does tiny damage, but it has a large force (aka low damage but really far pushing/throwing). So you don't really want to spam it, just use it if she is in the dark colors and rushing at you. It also is pretty safe to use. The recovery isn't too long and the hitbox start right at your hurtbox (so you hit stacked enemies) and it extend pretty far.  If you need any Vraxx help, go ahead and ask! Also, if you want, you can hit me up on steam (see flair). Be sure to send a message, I have a lot of people and I forget who wants help, just send it any time"

Brawlhalla,3e0uww,DogWalk13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:25:44 2015 UTC,Play to win. If a certain weapon gives you an advantage then use that when you can. Running away until you get that weapon is perfectly acceptable on high movespeed characters.
Brawlhalla,3e0uww,ImTybo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:30:47 2015 UTC,I feel that if you think that you are significantly better with one weapon only using that weapon is a legitimate strategy.

Brawlhalla,3dyoar,eleetpancake,5,Mon Jul 20 16:40:05 2015 UTC,"Warning Crummy Microsoft Paint Edit!  Wally is definitely my favorite map out of the test maps, but it's not without its problems. Look at my edit while reading or everything I say will sound like gibberish.  Red: What I think should be removed.  I think the chunks of the map labeled Red 1 and Red 2 should be removed. I like the large size of the map and agree with the praises other commenters have made on its size, but it's just a tad bit awkwardly big. I very rarely found myself in Green 1 or Green 2 and when I did i was hit there. I think in a situation where you are hit into Green 1 or Green 2 you should be punished and what's a better punishment then not having anywhere to land?   Blue: What I think should be added  Blue 1 would add some vertical map size and I think it would make up for getting rid of Red 1 and Red 2. It would make a Green 3 jump / Downward attack possible and that would add to better map flow. Blue 2 would make a Green 4 knockout much more likely which would also add to game flow. With the maps size knockouts take longer and I think this would speed them up a little bit. Blue 2 would also allow for a Green 5 wall-jump which I think would be interesting. It would make it harder to climb to the top and it would add a lot of horizontal combat in an area where mainly down heavies would be used.  Yellow: Aesthetics  I fell like a cyberpunk / Ada theme would suit this map well. The background could be a downtrodden neo-city while the foreground could be very metallic and computeristic. Yellow 1 could be almost holographic and have a tron-grid feel.  I know a lot of the things I suggested are nitpicks or unnecessary  but I felt I should share just in case you like even 1 of the ideas."

The problem with it for a 1v1 setting seems like it could get incredibly campy if it's too large and would make for some annoying matches against fast players who run away. However, for a 2v2/FFA style map I believe it could be perfect with the dynamic angles and space to set up team plays."

The moving blocks add a challenge and make it very unique. /u/harrell03's analysis is very on point - it really is Pinball Reborn, and its very cool because of that. My one problem is that the map is not balanced - there is nothing going on the left side of the map.

It feels smaller than thunderguard by longer than mammoth which is good. But it might be only good for 1v1 and not as great for 2v2.
Brawlhalla,3dyoar,deluxejoe,2,Mon Jul 20 19:10:02 2015 UTC,Decent 1v1 but Not good for Brawlhalla since we utilize ledges as parts of the map. This map seems like it'd be binary and make games more like smash but with the 1st one to get knocked off losing.

Brawlhalla,3dyoar,jaxnif,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:18:34 2015 UTC,Rather than make it an entirely new map you could add an option that lets you turn off platform movement. You could then take maps that are too hectic such as Enigma and make them competitive. This could also let you make Wally and even possibly Pit competitive. though of course Mammoth Fortress and Blackguard Keep are perfectly fine for competitive with moving platforms.

Could be improved by lowering the upper portion, incresing the angles on the side walls about 45*, making the top platform static, making the lower ground more of a box to promote fights on the walls, and removing the lower platforms I think.

Neutral light spear has pretty good range and can block someone rushing you from the ground.   Side sig has longer range and can zone them out way better.  Neutral sig is great at picking people out of the air if they try to jump over your side/down sigs.  Really, you just use your superior range to punish if they come close to you. Make sure you're always ready dodge because people tend to throw items at you if you're playing defensive like this.  Low gold experience here"

Brawlhalla,3dzjvu,Tho76,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:56:51 2015 UTC,"Some more info from my experiences:  Some abilities are really good against the down heavy. Specifically sair and dair from lances, because they will carry them over hit box and are generally fast enough that you're stuck in the animation and can't dodge.  Air heavies, if dodged, can be punished pretty easily. They're annoying to dodge because they hit multiple times so dodging trough is pretty specific timing and hit pretty wide so dodging to the side takes some good reaction. They leave you somewhat vulnerable, so be cautions. If you start spamming it, you can be punished even more because you get fairly predictable."

Brawlhalla,3dxsmk,bluetiger6001,3,Mon Jul 20 12:43:35 2015 UTC,"Certain weapon skins should be released by gold only, and perhaps limited edition. I say this because weapons are a small design aspect of the game as opposed to a whole character model design. I'm assuming that more time is spent on character models than weapon models so it would make sense that character skins cost money but at least having weapon skins obtainable through gold makes sense.   I think in game tournaments is an excellent idea. Using gold for tickets is a great idea. Maybe even have a large yearly tournament where the winner gets to design a skin for their character of choice and when that skin gets released it can be bought with gold but only for a certain amount of time before it's money obtainable only.   Also, somewhat small but perhaps gold used to buy background music? Opens opportunity to having a killer soundtrack :D  Question to the devs ::  Think about having a global chatroom for the server? That way more users can meet each other and create custom rooms for certain fun random matches. Gold could also be spent used to pay for font colors, backgrounds colors, random badges next to their name, icons, character icons.  Maybe use gold to create in game guilds? Users have to pay x amount each to start a guild which can help make guild rankings easier. Guilds can use gold to upgrade in size, change their icons, etc etc."
Brawlhalla,3dxsmk,soupysauce,2,Mon Jul 20 23:55:38 2015 UTC,"you cant release an unlimited amount of legends in a fighting game   Just look at league of legends... every role is fulfilled many times over. No reason they can't release a bunch. But you're right in that I don't think you can release anywhere near as many. The way the game works means a lot of legends will end up being incredibly similar if you create a lot.  Either that or the way the game plays will change a lot as other weapons are introduced.  I'm always a fan of things that show dedication to a game though. Stuff that purchasable only with gold along side the other cosmetics. You don't really want them competing though (for marketing reasons mostly).  Like you may be able to acquire some crazy weapon skin, but not a legend skin.  A tournament/arena (e.g. what hearthstone does) would also be interesting. Put in a bet/entry fee, 8 games random vs random (or choice of three). Need 4 wins to make back your money."

Brawlhalla,3dxsmk,mongelonas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:41:21 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with Frank Xenatra here. Right now, we have no use for our gold, and the only use once it's out of beta is going to be getting characters. Maybe adding the second option for items, except it costs a lot more compared to mammoth coins? (i.e. 200 mammoth coins are worth 200,000 coins) or maybe a transaction system. Or, like Xenatra said, tournament tickets (I honestly never would've thought of that) So yeah, cool ideas."

Brawlhalla,3dy43d,Pieisgood45,3,Mon Jul 20 14:34:12 2015 UTC,If you actually jump off the stage to edge guard anything can be a knock out.
Brawlhalla,3dy43d,ImTybo,2,Mon Jul 20 15:08:38 2015 UTC,"Right right, I read, played a couple games and realised how little I really jump of the edge to edge guard, thanks tybo"
Brawlhalla,3dy43d,yaroto98,0,Mon Jul 20 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"Easiest way is to spam sigs and hope one hits.  Next is to hit them with a bomb, mine, or spikeyball (charged up).  A more elegant maneuver is to know a sigs hit box, the reach of the hit box, and to lure the opponent into a trap. Knock him off the platform. Any direction. On their way back, they have limited movement as to where they will land. Position your guy so they will land in your hit box. Charge the sig. Don't let it charge so long that it goes off prematurely. Hit them with the sig before they hit the ground."
Brawlhalla,3dy43d,electricblackcrayon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"The EASIEST and I mean easiest ways to knock out and can be applied to all characters is.....  Uppercuts (up heavy) and also Down Heavy. Up heavies are fast but need a little setting up, bait your opponent above.  Down Heavies are easier to do in a edge guard situation but don't use it too much or they will expect it and dodge.   Since your flair is lucien. You should go for side light airs as the gun's have a very potent side air knock back at red/high orange.  Your katars can knockout if they stand sideways or if you can manage a quick combo."

Brawlhalla,3dy43d,Tho76,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:50 2015 UTC,"I assume you are a Lucien main because of your flair, right? Sair Sair Sair Sair. Both of Luciens weapons have incredible side airs, which can allow for an ez ko. Also, listen to tybo and go off the stage to edge guard."
Brawlhalla,3dy43d,pab9ab,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:35:39 2015 UTC,"Something a little different, think of it this way. Don't spam Heavies to get a KO, play normally until you see q n easy opertunity. If you are wrecking your opponent, they'll Kill themselves basically. This does require a bit of prediction though, imo.  Does the opponent not have a weapon? Stand on the weapon pickup and watch for divekicks - if you have the Gun, easy NHeavy KO. Just an example."
Brawlhalla,3dy43d,KowtowRobinson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:06:51 2015 UTC,"Easy knockouot with any weapon: Side Air Light (sair). Most weapons can easily do ground side light into sair. Weapon tosses and sword sairs for edge guarding. My fav way to kill is on the very side of mammoth fortress, for example. Down weapon toss into ground pound. Great for bronze, silver, and most of gold."

Brawlhalla,3dxnq8,yaroto98,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:37:25 2015 UTC,Are they using the tactic to deprive you of weapons? I've thrown weapons just to pick up another one so the person i'm 1v1ing doesn't get one. This gives me reach and helps keep him from landing a hit.
Brawlhalla,3dxnq8,yaroto98,2,Mon Jul 20 12:07:15 2015 UTC,"No. They dont light attack, ever. They only throw stuff and sometimes use signatures. rarely tho , its mostly just running around throwing."

Brawlhalla,3dxnq8,electricblackcrayon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:45:36 2015 UTC,"First, the throw itself doesn't do a lot of damage so they will never kill you only using that.  When they throw their weapon, they become less powerful (except if they're really good with unarmed) so you have the advantage as soon as they throw their weapon.  You just have to be able to get closer to them while they are unarmed. One way could be to dodge straight through their throw. You can also play with jumps in the air to make them waste their throw.  You could also try to throw your weapon and try to pick it up again while running towards them."
Brawlhalla,3dxnq8,Buucrew,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:04 2015 UTC,"Just dodge them lol, ESPECIALLY IF YOUR sentinel you dodge and you hammer their asses to the ground. or even just go in deep with katars"

Also, dodges don't really cover enough ground to escape, and hammer throws are wide enough to fill up the pit between the two solid platforms. The platforms aren't wide enough to accommodate even just 2 players and it results in a never ending edge-guard or a stalemate where neither is willing to move because moving gives the enemy an advantage."

Brawlhalla,3dv0ze,Limeskyinfo,2,Sun Jul 19 19:14:44 2015 UTC,They changed it in this patch now you only see your wins and elo but wen you go on the brawlhallawebsite and /ranking you can search for your name and see your win/lose
Brawlhalla,3dv0ze,Xenatra,2,Sun Jul 19 19:22:56 2015 UTC,Damn. I hope they add back that feature. I like seeing that all in one place.

Brawlhalla,3dv1sn,clippershipEleGiggle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:42:28 2015 UTC,Is there a reason I should use the side sig instead of the down sig?  Down sig puts some extra space in between

Hattori is pretty UP at higher levels this patch, but she will almost certainly get buffs in the future to make her more viable. But at the moment, it is a lot of work to play Hattori. I feel like I have to play twice as good as my opponent to win, unless they are Hattori, too. Though, it's a great feeling when top tier characters cry about you rekking their asses with Hattori xD."
Brawlhalla,3drwi7,Tho76,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:40:06 2015 UTC,Maybe she's the Lee Sin of Brawlhalla? If you can play her you can play anyone :P  Won't mind a Hattori buff though

Brawlhalla,3drwi7,Tho76,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:06:24 2015 UTC,After that Kappa vs BMG battle I think a lot of people are going to come around to the idea that Vraxx is only bad aesthetically.

Of course, Tyveris isn't as good as Milo (no offence), so he had an upward battle, but I don't know if Vraxx barely beating another low tier Legend (especially one as slow as Gnash) makes him considered better"

Brawlhalla,3dq6ui,phobed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:07:55 2015 UTC,"To me it feels a bit more natural to use a gamepad. A lot of keyboard users use up as jump (I think it's possible to separate them now, but not sure) which makes it hard to throw up or diagonally without jumping. That's also the main reason there aren't any attacks like up air, or up ground. But there are not really any big differences, it comes down to personal preference"
Brawlhalla,3dq6ui,Jeltrix,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:24:01 2015 UTC,"There is no advantage, it is just preference. But I recommend putting you jump on a different key to up (I use WASD to move / aim and spacebar to jump)."
Brawlhalla,3dq6ui,bluetiger6001,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:44:53 2015 UTC,"that was VERY helpful thanks alot, throwing is so much easier :D"
Brawlhalla,3dq6ui,plzgivegold,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:36:34 2015 UTC,"In theory, there should be no difference, as there are no directional inputs that could only be input with a game-pad. There are some arguments between the use of thumbs versus the use of all fingers for movement, and whether than provides an advantage, but it is a a very tiny difference, so in general, feel free to use whatever. However, many people feel more comfortable on a game-pad, meaning it makes sense to use a game-pad as they already posses the basic muscle memory. However, if you have the same/more experience with a keyboard, it makes sense to use a keyboard.  If you are going to use a keyboard, I recommend checking your key bindings to make sure they are optimal, and allow you to do all the key combinations which make sense in game.   Also, I'm very salty that after a few games your in silver 5, I'm still stuck in bronze :)"
Brawlhalla,3dq6ui,zeloxory,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:47:33 2015 UTC,"There isn't really an advantage or disadvantage between the two, except that the keyboard can let you change direction quicker but even then that doesn't come into play till plat and up."

Brawlhalla,3dofg9,Picklesaur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:52:40 2015 UTC,It's a normal thing I think.  Dunno.
Brawlhalla,3dofg9,xKholly,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:22:17 2015 UTC,does the dodge cooldown reset when you hit the ground?

Brawlhalla,3dnuex,TechaMaki,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:45:18 2015 UTC,I still find Orion a pain in the arse since his buff.
Brawlhalla,3dnuex,eulerhopepunk,2,Sat Jul 18 09:44:47 2015 UTC,you meant to post this in /r/Jokes
Brawlhalla,3dnuex,rafaelcg94,2,Sat Jul 18 05:33:38 2015 UTC,You're not wrong.
Brawlhalla,3dnuex,Coffeechipmunk,2,Fri Jul 17 20:07:48 2015 UTC,can confirm from experience this is the official tier list as of now
Brawlhalla,3dnuex,plzgivegold,0,Fri Jul 17 20:24:21 2015 UTC,I still have hope in my Samurai dreams.
Brawlhalla,3dnlf9,ZombieSlayer5,2,Fri Jul 17 18:58:28 2015 UTC,"YES PLS. Doesn't he have wings? Because if he does I feel like Katars would be more fitting, as there is a lot of air potential such as divekicks and recoveries that would look amazing on a winged legend. Haven't seen many of these, but this is certainly my favorite. Amazing concept!"
Brawlhalla,3dnlf9,harrell03,2,Fri Jul 17 19:24:42 2015 UTC,"I was considering adding wings, but I didn't want the character model to deviate too much from a the current form of the other fighters. I could imagine a move where wings magically appear during a recover then fade away. Also I decided against wings because they're really show-offy, and I imagine Phobos has a more mysterious and progressive personality.   I'm really glad you like the concept though. When I was making it I thought to myself ""What kind of character would I have liked to see when I first played the game"" and this is basically my dream fighter."
Brawlhalla,3dnlf9,harrell03,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:59:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess wings would be pretty out-of-place since all legends have a similar (or identical) skeleton. But still, awesome concept!"
Brawlhalla,3dnlf9,MrN829,2,Fri Jul 17 20:35:01 2015 UTC,Would you be interested in refining the weapons and character design? I would be able to easily help with the art.
Brawlhalla,3dnlf9,bluetiger6001,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:37:59 2015 UTC,"I think I could have done much better myself if I had blown the reference fighters up, I ended up working with a really low resolution with the size I chose. I think it looks better because of it though. I may do a ""remastered"" version sometime soon."
Brawlhalla,3dnlf9,bluetiger6001,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"Cool idea.  One problem though is that the light attacks (and air heavies) are the same for each character using the same weapon. So Phobos would have to have the same light attacks as Thatch, Lucien etc on guns and Nai, Sentinel etc on katars."
Brawlhalla,3dnlf9,MrN829,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:28:43 2015 UTC,"Really? Well at least the Scythe is going to be unique, which is good. I thought the characters were the same except stats and item moves, but maybe that's just aerials? Yeah I don't know. The design itself should sell the idea."
Brawlhalla,3dnlf9,MatthewAV,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:47:14 2015 UTC,Only the ground heavy attacks are different (that's why they're called signatures ;)).
Brawlhalla,3dnlf9,pab9ab,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:07:14 2015 UTC,Well thanks for clearing that up.

Brawlhalla,3dnrs1,xKholly,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:17:47 2015 UTC,Are you serious? I never met anyone like that. Which rank are you playing on?
Brawlhalla,3dnrs1,xKholly,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:24:39 2015 UTC,Gold 3 lol
Brawlhalla,3dnrs1,ArcaneZorro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:01:38 2015 UTC,Ive only met 2-3 people in my climb that were super salty and that was in silver/gold.    Then again my name is a link to my stream so maybe they're afraid to make an ass of themselves in front of people.
Brawlhalla,3dnrs1,xKholly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:29:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, probably."
Brawlhalla,3docod,exsuprhero,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:29:24 2015 UTC,"Who cares what their elo is, it'll change when you beat them ;)  Also, I think it has to do with how many matches you've played. As in a person got to silver but in fewer matches will have a higher rating than a person who did it the hard way... But that's complete speculation and someone smarter than me will probably give you a better answer."
Brawlhalla,3docod,Designated_Asian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:42:01 2015 UTC,Get a pic of it next time. That sounds weird as placement is based just off of elo.
Brawlhalla,3docod,PotsNPans,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:45:52 2015 UTC,Just posted this after I went up against a 1258 silver and I was a 1278 bronze. I'll post a pic if/when it happens again
Brawlhalla,3docod,SuprisinlgyCoolKid,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:53:17 2015 UTC,"It's to protect against immediately getting dropped out of a new division. Say you got into silver then lost your next game, it would lower your elo, not your placement. But if you lose enough you will be demoted to the previous division."
Brawlhalla,3docod,Exodromos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:00:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think they have protection systems available, this isn't league of legends.  Might be a bug in general."
Brawlhalla,3docod,SuprisinlgyCoolKid,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:11:24 2015 UTC,"It could possibly be a bug, but I've dropped multiple times under the elo it took me to get into a division and still stayed in. However this is my particular experience and it may not be the norm."
Brawlhalla,3docod,Epindary,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:15:16 2015 UTC,"Yes there is a protection system, since when you get to a new tier you get placed into Silver 1, Gold 1 etc. after that you still have a way to drop down to Silver 0/Gold 0"
Brawlhalla,3docod,Exodromos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:18:23 2015 UTC,"Probably, but ELO is unaffected, just ranking in general."
Brawlhalla,3docod,Epindary,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:48:35 2015 UTC,Yeah
Brawlhalla,3docod,eulerhopepunk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"I've noticed Silver 0 and Gold 0 are the same ELO range as Bronze 5 and Silver 5 respectively. It's just a weird ""I was in gold and lost."" thing."
Brawlhalla,3docod,harrell03,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:25:26 2015 UTC,"Quick question: Are you Bronze 5? Because Silver 0 is a placeholder for Bronze 5 and if that is what you are matched against, you have an answer. I don't remember the exact threshold, but you will rank from bronze 5 straight to silver 1."
Brawlhalla,3docod,bluetiger6001,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"Silver 0 is the same as bronze 5. When you get to silver 1 and lose to go back to bronze 5, it has it at silver 0 to make you not feel so bad or whatever."
Brawlhalla,3dokze,ryangames90,3,Fri Jul 17 23:41:11 2015 UTC,No Spikeballs/bombs/horns? What?   Not a fan of this set up.
Brawlhalla,3dokze,Tho76,0,Sat Jul 18 01:22:44 2015 UTC,"Its called skill bro hence the name ""Tournament"" Items give the player an advantage and more of a quick kill.  But there fine on online just not the tournament scene"
Brawlhalla,3dokze,Magmabob,3,Sat Jul 18 02:08:01 2015 UTC,Except we deal with them fine in the tournament scene.
Brawlhalla,3dokze,Tho76,2,Sat Jul 18 04:57:36 2015 UTC,"How does it give an advantage? It's part of the game, and to use them it takes ""skill bro""."
