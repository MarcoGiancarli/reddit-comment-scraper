The Confederate Flag isn't necessarily a racist symbol, but it's certainly become a symbol for racists and racism.

InsaneCringePosse,33s0la,BitchesGetStitches,7,Sat Apr 25 16:22:44 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your interpretation of the Confederate Flag being a symbol of failure. I'm a history teacher and perpetual student of history, and I note a particular bias in American historical interpretation against the South when it comes to understanding the causes and results of the Civil War. We uphold Lincoln as a champion of equality and justice, even though he violated the Constitution on several occasions (nothing against the man, whom I uphold as one of the great transformative figures in American history).   We teach that the Civil War was a battle fought over the singular issue of slavery, and the protection of racist systems. This, like OP's link, is not right,  nor is it wrong. We fail to consider that at the time of the Civil War, the Union was only about 100 years old. It had undergone a tremendous change in structure, size, scope, and culture since the 13 original colonies. The expansion of the frontier meant that the reach of the Federal Government now extended from one great ocean to the other. The military, once a small band of freedom fighters, was now an institution which fought on behalf of the imperial interests of the nation (see: Barbary Wars).  In short, the Southern secession was, in large part, a natural progression of the American Revolution a century earlier. Virginians understood themselves as Virginians, not as Americans. They believed, as their interpretation of the Constitution implies, that the People have a right to self governance and self determination. In this case, they wanted the right to determine, as Virginians, how they wanted to govern the evil of slavery. Were they wrong? No. Were they right? I don't know.   In the end, we as historians know that the South had little hope of winning the Civil War. They were a disparate, agrarian union waging war against an organized, industrial central government. Indeed, the only reason the war was as drawn out and bloody as it was is due to the lack of competent, willing military leadership in the North for the first half of the conflict.   Now, to brass tacks. Is the Confederate Flag, and by proxy the Confederacy, inherently a symbol of racial hatred? Not necessarily, but that is what is has become. Just as the swastika was once used as a symbol of peace and fertility, the meaning of such symbols is fluid and dynamic. Where once the crucifix was merely a symbol of violence and Roman oppression, it has come to represent hope and love to Christians. These things change, and to try to cling to outmoded interpretations of symbols is simply kicking against the sea.   Also, my screen name is a reference to a Reggie and the Full Effect song. I happened to be listening to the track when I made my account, and here we are,  3 years later, talking about it."

In college you learn that the civil war was caused by cotton speculators, diminishing power of northern states, global trade policies, constitutional rights, interstate commerce, and many other factors.   In grad school you learn that all of those things were ultimately caused by slavery."

They were happy to use the aggressive power of the federal government when they disagreed with Minnesota's refusal to capture runaway slaves."

Here's a little story: Every year my college (Youngstown State - yes, the one which had the ""straight pride"" posters and has an ongiong sexual harassment investigation) has an English Festival where kids read a list of young adult books and then go there in April and play trivia games, write essays, etc. It was actually the first program of its kind when it was founded. But last year, a kid came - on one of the days when 7th-9th graders come, not 10th-12th - in full Juggalo makeup. I just stared for a minute and was baffled as to who let him out of the house like that, let alone what school would let him go like that. Then I realized he must have either put it on during the bus ride there or in the bathroom once he arrived but I still don't understand how he was allowed to go to the activities with it on (I saw him a few times throughout the day)."

InsaneCringePosse,2x6abq,Superman_does_good,5,Thu Feb 26 04:57:05 2015 UTC,"TLDR version- I'm amazed at the difference in their fan base then, and now. I think some just don't make it obvious. I think that they're great to their fans, which goes a LONG way with me. Plus they're helping out a local rap outfit that should've made it huge a long time ago, but jail ruined it, The Dayton Family is who I'm referring to. I have a lot of respect for shaggy and J. When I was younger, very early 90s, you didn't get laughed outta the room for enjoying their music. Their music always sounded great with a crazy audio system. I won't lie, I still listen to their CDs up to Great Milenko I still think Carnival of Carnage is the bees knees. Anyway, there wasn't such a thing as a Juggalette. I don't even remember anyone calling theirselves such til maybe later 90s. In Michigan they got much love. I don't know when things went awry. Mainly I disliked a certain lyric to a song they had ""fuck Ted Nugent, fuck Fred bear"" I didn't lose my mind over Nuge, he can handle himself, but why the hell they ripped on Fred bear was infuriating, he's dead.To explain, Fred Bear, is a legendary Bowhunter, here in Michigan. Mostly it's a personal thing I have going with ICP. I still listen to their stuff, I just don't run round with hatchetman, ink, or ICP tees on. To each their own. But it's such a different fan base today than when I was in HS. If their music makes them feel better, that's all that matters.  I had a lot of fun going into AOL chats for ICP, just to troll the hell outta the room and punt people. (If you remember punting people, high five lol) and I'd go in with the name em came up with, ViolentGayFaggy2Dope or a variation, I think you got 15 characters for a username. Either way, they'd get so upset. I was a full fledged alcoholic then, I wouldn't do that today. I did the same to limp bizkit fans. It was so easy, they fed the trolls well, lol"

InsaneCringePosse,2v08p7,Kaffiene6,3,Sat Feb 7 07:24:57 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Facial features of article  Fetal alcohol syndrome:       Several characteristic craniofacial abnormalities are often visible in individuals with FAS.  The presence of FAS facial features indicates brain damage, though brain damage may also exist in their absence. FAS facial features (and most other visible, but non-diagnostic, deformities) are believed to be caused mainly during the 10th and 20th week of gestation.   Refinements in diagnostic criteria since 1975 have yielded three distinctive and diagnostically significant facial features known to result from prenatal alcohol exposure and distinguishes FAS from other disorders with partially overlapping characteristics.   The three FAS facial features are:   A smooth philtrum — The divot or groove between the nose and upper lip flattens with increased prenatal alcohol exposure. Thin vermilion — The upper lip thins with increased prenatal alcohol exposure. Small palpebral fissures — Eye width decreases with increased prenatal alcohol exposure.   Measurement of FAS facial features uses criteria developed by the University of Washington. The lip and philtrum are measured by a trained physician with the Lip-Philtrum Guide,  a 5-point Likert Scale with representative photographs of lip and philtrum combinations ranging from normal (ranked 1) to severe (ranked 5). Palpebral fissure length (PFL) is measured in millimeters with either calipers or a clear ruler and then compared to a PFL growth chart, also developed by the University of Washington.   Ranking FAS facial features is complicated because the three separate facial features can be affected independently by prenatal alcohol. A summary of the criteria follows:     Severe — All three facial features ranked independently as severe (lip ranked at 4 or 5, philtrum ranked at 4 or 5, and PFL two or more standard deviations below average). Moderate — Two facial features ranked as severe and one feature ranked as moderate (lip or philtrum ranked at 3, or PFL between one and two standard deviations below average). Mild — A mild ranking of FAS facial features covers a broad range of facial feature combinations: Two facial features ranked severe and one ranked within normal limits, One facial feature ranked severe and two ranked moderate, or One facial feature ranked severe, one ranked moderate and one ranked within normal limits. None — All three facial features ranked within normal limits.   These distinctive facial features in a patient do strongly correlate to brain damage. Sterling Clarren of the University of Washington's Fetal Alcohol and Drug Unit told a conference in 2002:     “I have never seen anybody with this whole face who doesn't have some brain damage. In fact in studies, as the face is more FAS-like, the brain is more likely to be abnormal. The only face that you would want to counsel people or predict the future about is the full FAS face. But the risk of brain damage increases as the eyes get smaller, as the philtrum gets flatter, and the lip gets thinner. The risk goes up but not the diagnosis.”     “At one-month gestation, the top end of your body is a brain, and at the very front end of that early brain, there is tissue that has been brain tissue. It stops being brain and gets ready to be your face ... Your eyeball is also brain tissue. It's an extension of the second part of the brain. It started as brain and ""popped out."" So if you are going to look at parts of the brain from alcohol damage, or any kind of damage during pregnancy, eye malformations and midline facial malformations are going to be very actively related to the brain across syndromes ... and they certainly are with FAS.”      Interesting: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder | National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome | Palpebral fissure | Upper lip   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

InsaneCringePosse,2uh9ul,Ddickerson03,11,Fri Feb 13 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"basically they were 2 young girls that got sent to the scared straight program because they thought they were both thug juggalos that could beat up anyone.  they lived with their aunt and would wear juggalo makeup and their aunt and her son thought it was weird and it made the aunt uncomfortable and the son just made fun of them.  while in the jail the cops basically made them rub jelly on their faces and one said to them ""thats how you like to do your make up right?"""

InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,DonWonDellanooch,27,Sun Feb 1 23:18:53 2015 UTC,"Lol, I knew this one was coming eventually. That lyric is actually a perfect and probably the most popular example of the glorification of ignorance in the juggalo subculture."
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,J_Briarwood,9,Mon Feb 2 01:41:22 2015 UTC,"As a former juggalo myself, do you listen to any of the music anymore?

InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,domaa,13,Sun Feb 1 17:03:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with your stance on Twiztid, but I find myself listening to them less and less. Also, I was not impressed with A New Nightmare. As far as the rest of the artists go, aside from a handful of songs, I don't listen to them anymore. I think that after I got over being a juggalo, I just couldn't convince myself that most of that music had any merit. The skits are still funny, for the most part, but that's about it. However I do find snippets of their lyrics popping into and becoming stuck in my head occasionally. It's maddening."

InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,ThreeLZ,9,Sun Feb 1 20:30:12 2015 UTC,In the photo album there is a girl that isn't completely unattractive. Was she lost or are there actually decent looking chicks that hang out with these clowns?
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,flaminhotcheeto,22,Sun Feb 1 19:55:03 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to the girl that isn't wearing facepaint? One of the juggalos is her brother. The majority of ""juggalettes"" are ""tore up from the floor up""."
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,AnarchistTrotskyist,6,Sun Feb 1 19:58:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah she's the one. That makes sense, my brain was having a hard time trying to compute why she would be associated with them."
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,Mockymark,17,Sun Feb 1 20:05:39 2015 UTC,"OP, what made you decide it was time to hang up your face paint and give your final ""woop woop?"" Was the experience overall positive? Would you recommend it to others as a sort of fraternity experience?"
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,portlandburner,32,Sun Feb 1 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"I guess I gained some self respect and a better sense of self worth. I know that all juggalos aren't idiotic trash, but the majority of them are. I came to a point where I didn't need to feel like I ""belonged"" badly enough to be associated with a group of people like this. I suppose my experience was positive because it's hard to find a negative when you don't give a shit about much at all, which is a requirement for being a juggalo. ""Oh, I don't have a job? Whatever, proud to be a scrub!"". This culture glorifies ignorance and social alienation. In the juggalo community, there is pride in being a failure. Would not recommend."
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,megatron37,12,Sun Feb 1 18:08:45 2015 UTC,"What was the best part of being a Juggalo? Also, as a community, does the family ethos translate well into actual practice? Do Juggalos really have a tight bond of family? How did that  bond (or lack thereof) express itself within your community?"
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,picardi,34,Sun Feb 1 16:45:24 2015 UTC,"The best part of being a juggalo was getting together with other people who shared an interest, even if that interest was rapping clowns. It was a place to belong when I felt there was nowhere else. The ""family"" bond was there, but was often defeated by laziness and inconvenience. For example, at an ICP show, I once became very faint as a result of being extremely hung over. Another juggalo noticed this and barreled his way through the crowd with an arm around me so I didn't pass out and get trampled. It also meant I could strike up a conversation with a total stranger on the bus who was ""down"", albeit a conversation about, you guessed it, rapping clowns. On the other hand, if I had a really shitty day, was pretty depressed and needed some company, most couldn't be bothered to drive 20 min to hang out. That is unless booze or an equivalent was offered. Also, they were not all accepting as they would have you believe.  They are just as conformist as other groups, just in their own way. God forbid you listened to any other music that wasn't related to ICP. You had to mindlessly love every turd of an album shat out by Psychopathic Records, ICP's self made record label. Also there was major discrimination against newer juggalos."
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,Arachne93,4,Sun Feb 1 16:58:19 2015 UTC,Who was the weakest artist on the label and why?
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,Arachne93,9,Sun Feb 1 23:01:59 2015 UTC,"I personally think that ABK is the weakest artist. I got away from it before their newer artist, Big Hoodoo I think his name is, came around and I hear he is terrible. At the beginning it was hard to tell who was actually the worst because all the artists were helping  the new inexperienced acts get started, writing each others lyrics, music, etc. After a while it became clear who actually had some talent and who just got lucky knowing the right people and slapping on facepaint."
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,SheikDjibouti,29,Mon Feb 2 01:38:00 2015 UTC,"They do have a mob mentality. They basically want to be gangbangers, they just lack the money and organization that actual gangs have."
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,Mockymark,5,Sun Feb 1 17:37:43 2015 UTC,What are your most positive and negative experiences with this subculture?
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,Mentalpopcorn,9,Sun Feb 1 18:01:42 2015 UTC,Most negative was the glorification of poor life choices and failure. Most positive was the sense of belonging and it was something my cousins and I bonded over.
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,Mentalpopcorn,6,Sun Feb 1 19:35:00 2015 UTC,Have you been to any of the Gatherings?
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,squirrelmonkie,28,Sun Feb 1 20:13:09 2015 UTC,"I have never actually been. Thankfully, responsibility ""got in the way"". Work, family. You know, thug shit. I'm glad I never went. It's expensive as hell, and just a filthy, filthy breeding ground for various diseases, rampant drug use and unappealing nudity. A cesspool of degeneracy. I hear the nightly concerts are great though."
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,Mech528,6,Sun Feb 1 17:00:43 2015 UTC,What was the craziest shit you ever saw at a Juggalo event?  Most disturbing?  Funniest?
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,duffmanhb,11,Sun Feb 1 17:05:54 2015 UTC,"I think that link has all three of those requirements rolled into one. Here are a couple more involving my cousin. At one show an opening act called Wolfpac had dancers on stage and he had the bare breasts of one of them shoved in his face. The girl was actually really hot. I'm pretty sure this was his first experience with a pair of real live breasts. After, he proudly proclaimed ""I sucked her nipple!"" This same cousin, at the same show, actually, being hung over, broke free of the crowd, stumbled over to the wall and promptly vomited. Most juggalo experiences are crazy, funny, and disturbing all at the same time. Also, my cousin may or may not be included in these pictures."
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,alittlebigger,7,Sun Feb 1 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, a really close friend of mine is one of the Wolfpac dancers."

InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,dunndeal,3,Mon Feb 2 06:02:48 2015 UTC,Probably not the same girl.  I don't imagine the Lette I'm thinking of letting people get that handsy with her anyway.

InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,smoke_ring,5,Mon Feb 2 08:10:38 2015 UTC,Did you find that a lot of Juggalos had proclivities toward violence? Did you feel unsafe often.. like were there a lot of people you felt like could just bust out and start stabbing people? Like 4-5 people every day?
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,smoke_ring,6,Sun Feb 1 20:06:34 2015 UTC,"I was never worried about stabbing. Lol, love the song reference. It was more a worry of what kind of dumb shit will happen next to get us in trouble. Who is going to start a fist fight with a random person who looked at them wrong? Who is going to get caught walking out of Wal-mart with a bottle of booze stuffed down their pants?"
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,smoke_ring,4,Sun Feb 1 22:11:25 2015 UTC,How big is meth as part of the subculture?
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,KateKillz,7,Mon Feb 2 01:29:00 2015 UTC,"I personally never saw any meth being smoked/snorted/buttchugged or however else you partake in such a drug. I was never actually a part of the drug scene. I didn't smoke pot for the first time until last year. I have seen pills being ground up and snorted and lots of pot being smoked. I'm not saying the use of meth is nonexistent, I just never saw it. I know my ex-brother in law, who is a juggalo and around the drug scene more, was hooked on meth at one point."
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,acrolos,4,Sun Feb 1 22:51:13 2015 UTC,"How did you and your friends deal with it when the 6th joker's card dropped, the dark carnival failed to arrive, and all that weird Christian religious shit came out?"
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,foodang36,4,Mon Feb 2 01:33:38 2015 UTC,"Meh, we never really expected anything. We ate up Violent J's explanation that the world as juggalos knew it was over and a new world was beginning, our world. I was Christian at the time so I was cool with the religious overtones. Now they have apparently started a new set of six jokers cards and the gimmick continues."
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,CoruscantSunset,7,Mon Feb 2 22:45:20 2015 UTC,"Oh wow that's hilarious they're continuing with that.  I was a big ICP fan for a few years when I was 15, but never got into the subculture.  After I moved on and after the 6th card dropped I'd give my juggalo friends tons of shit about nothing happening and you could tell they were visibly annoyed with me.  But now everyone's moved on and we like to look back on those times and laugh about it.  I still pop on Milenko every once in a while too, great album."
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,boddahfly,9,Mon Feb 2 23:04:23 2015 UTC,I think juggalos are constantly defensive  because they are taking what is essentially a gag band extremely seriously.
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,boddahfly,4,Mon Feb 2 23:12:15 2015 UTC,"Personally this is my favorite ama that ive read. Id like to say you are very well spoken for a person that hung out with people that i generally considered idiots. You said you stopped listening to them at 29, so what was the deciding factor that made you want to leave the scene? Did you have other friends that didnt listen to icp, and was that a factor in what kept you into their music for so long?"
InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,GunnieGraves,5,Mon Feb 2 23:22:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the compliment calling me ""well spoken"". You could say I didn't really fit in with juggalos either. Which brings me to one of my responses to your questions. It occurs to me that I actually didn't have many close juggalo friends when I lived in Chicago, my hometown, just my cousins, who are quite intelligent. I only actually encountered other hard core juggalos at concerts, and I went to many. At the concerts it wad easy to write off the idiocy. My rationale was ""Everyone likes to cut loose at a concert"". It wasn't until I moved to Nebraska that I started hanging out with juggalos regularly as it was an easy in to make friends. This is where the disgust began. I was able to witness the way juggalos outside my family's upbringing conducted themselves in their daily lives.  Needless to say, it was off putting. As for why I ultimately left the scene, I guess I gained some self respect and a better sense of self worth. I know that all juggalos aren't idiotic trash, but the majority of them are. I came to a point where I didn't need to feel like I ""belonged"" badly enough to be associated with a group of people like this. Also, to answer two of your questions,  I actually enjoyed their music. ICP is irreverently humorous. Also, there is heart behind much of their music. No, they are not making Grammy award winning albums by any means but they were fun and catchy. Their last couple of albums have been absolute dogshit in my opinion. That helped push me away as well. Nine Inch Nails has always been my favorite band, long before I started listening to ICP and now, long after. Treat Reznor is my source for brilliant music. ICP was my source for funny and fun music. No longer. It's not fun feeling like nothing but a marketing target."

InsaneCringePosse,2uezpg,simpleGizzle,21,Tue Mar 3 01:12:20 2015 UTC,"If you change ""occasionally"" to ""often"" then your statement is true. I think if you take all the social rejects that lack shame and put them in a group, you would get juggalos. I was ""in"" from the ages of 16 to 29.
