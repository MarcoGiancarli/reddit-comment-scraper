hardwareswap,3e2y19,TheNannerBeans,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:08 2015 UTC,"I kinda have to use tools. I just can not tighten fittings well by hand. Tried many many times, and always causes a leak. Now, I use tools with cloth to keep that from happening."

Once the bottom G1/4 stops spinning while you are spinning the top, it is tight enough."

hardwareswap,3dzw10,SoldierFall,-5,Mon Jul 20 22:00:02 2015 UTC,I reevaluated the prices based on eBay listings. I imagine if I wanted to sell them here I'd have to take off at least $20 on top of that. I don't think I'm ready for that. I'll probably come back in a couple weeks with appropriate prices.

hardwareswap,3dzw10,JustAnotherINFTP,3,Tue Jul 21 02:04:36 2015 UTC,"did you base them off of Ebay sold listings, or just ebay listings?  A lot of listings on ebay are ridiculously high, and they never sell.

hardwareswap,3e239z,Ejekt,3,Tue Jul 21 14:06:22 2015 UTC,I thought the architecture had to match so you could only mix Hawaii with Hawaii. So only the r9 290 family not the whole r9 crew

hardwareswap,3e239z,Ejekt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:34:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that will work. You cannot crossfire any R9 card with any other R9 card (280 crossfire with 290 won't work), but you can crossfire a MSI 290 and an XFX 290x, for example, or even a 7970 and a 280x."

I'm sure if you looked around on some forums on what kinds of clockspeeds people were able to achieve with this card you would get an idea of what this bad boy can do.

Shipping was free and fast - two days. I 'deshell' external drives to use in hot-swap bays, making one GPT partition on the drive - it comes to 3.63 TB formatted. The drive is actually a WD Green - model WD40EZRX Cons:none Other Thoughts:As to why the drive sells for much more without the shell, I have no idea. That is just the way it is.

hardwareswap,3e09m6,akaisei,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:43:51 2015 UTC,"PayPal won't default the payment to friends and family. I actually don't think PayPal has the option to default to friends and family for you to mess with. You should be protected if you just pay it like that, but you should write in the notes and be detailed about the transaction so you have record of it in case you need to dispute. Also take pics of convos and such for further proof"
hardwareswap,3e09m6,usyed1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:29 2015 UTC,"Yea, I usually keep a history of the post and conversation (in case they delete their account and thread) but if I could do one more thing to prevent even the hassle of dealing with a scammer then I will.

hardwareswap,3e09m6,akaisei,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:53:54 2015 UTC,Lol proof. That won't help you with jackshit. Buyers always win sellers always lose. Unless you have an illiterate backwards terrible English scammer... you will always lose. I had a scammer actually say F U and very broken english to me via PayPal resolution claim... that was the only claim in years of selling I've ever won.
hardwareswap,3e09m6,NOTASOUND,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:13:49 2015 UTC,Sounds like you haven't had a very good time with them. I'll admit usually the claims department is very difficult to deal with but I've yet to lose a case knock on wood it could probably be bc I try to choice trades carefully and document everything that happens in detail.
hardwareswap,3e09m6,theonedub,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:39:35 2015 UTC,"When its not an invoice, but is goods and services, it'll tell you you're protected for however many days on the details, closer to the bottom. However, I would ask for an invoice, it'll be a lot easier to prove your case if you're scammed"
hardwareswap,3e09m6,Rathkeaux,0,Mon Jul 20 23:34:44 2015 UTC,"Seller sends buyer email address, buyer pays as goods and services. Transaction done. I don't get everyone asking to be invoiced or sending money requests, keep it simple."
hardwareswap,3e09m6,theonedub,2,Mon Jul 20 23:36:05 2015 UTC,"You can also choose pay after delivery with an invoice, so you send me an invoice, and I pay you, you receive your money immediately but I don't actually pay it for 14 days.  If I am sent an invoice, I get an immediate email notification, click one button to get to paypal, and one button to pay, it is very nice and convenient, and you have a record of the transaction on Paypal, what is not to like?  The other more obvious bonus to it is that I don't have to type your weird email into paypal and possibly type it wrong and send some yahoo $200, If you send the request to the wrong person they just won't pay, no harm no foul.  So invoices are actually a much safer way to use paypal for all parties."
hardwareswap,3e09m6,Rathkeaux,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:55:09 2015 UTC,"You get a record of all PayPal transactions, invoice or not. Copy/paste email, I don't think in over 150+ transactions I have ever sent money to the wrong person. Back in the day, generating false invoices was a common PP scam. Maybe there are less clicks, but as far as payment security- there's nothing invoices provide that sending a normal G/S payment doesn't."
hardwareswap,3e09m6,theonedub,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:01:58 2015 UTC,"The seller providing an invoice makes it easier for the buyer.  Do you know what buyers do when things are easier?  They buy more.

hardwareswap,3dyo3l,iTzLazyGenius,0,Mon Jul 20 17:03:42 2015 UTC,"You'd be looking at around the $1400 mark. I bought an Alienware 17 R2 recently with the 980m, 4710hq, 16gb ram, 1tb HDD, and touchscreen for that much. Used, but in immaculate condition. I changed out the hard for a 1tb 850 evo ssd, and it's doing great. In the past Alienware has always been the more expensive tier of gaming laptops, but this year with the R2 models they somehow turned out to be one of the cheapest ones, price wise. If you're looking for one, I'd suggest buying from eBay instead of dell's website. The chassis is still pretty much top tier, I have one little concern with the hinge compared to last years model but I haven't had any problems yet. If you decide to go for a gaming laptop with a 980m, I definitely recommend the AW 17R2 or the Asus g751jy. Other laptops for the price just isn't worth it IMO on build quality alone. I'm speaking this from my own experience having owned; sager, msi, Asus, Alienware, and even the gateway fx gaming laptops."

The aluminum overhaul painted over it was nice and price of MSIs were rather cheap, I paid $860 for my new GX70, around 2.5 years ago."

hardwareswap,3dy2pu,veam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:20:47 2015 UTC,"They feel pretty solid overall. I think the keys are printed and not etched, and they feel slightly lighter than the ones on the Logitech G710+ and Corsair K70, but i haven't actually weighed them to see if they are actually.  Kailh browns feel pretty much the same as Cherry browns, apart for some keys being a bit firmer or having a more/less prominent tactile bump than others. (larger variance in the keys that get through QC)  You really have to be looking to notice though. Adding the O-rings definitely helped it feel more solid and not have the rough bottoming out.  Basically, pretty much everything in the anandtech article is accurate."

hardwareswap,3dyg06,TheNannerBeans,0,Tue Jul 21 05:52:57 2015 UTC,Oh Amazon got them back. They were gone from Amazon and Newegg for a long time so I assume they just stopped carrying them. It's still a lot more expensive than Massdrop though.
hardwareswap,3dyg06,RackyBolboa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:54:13 2015 UTC,"If your hands actually are gigantic, the Naos probably won't fit you too well. I have right at average size hands and the ring+pinky finger rest on the naos is too small for my fingers to actually rest on it. I'm waiting on a Func MS-3 right now because it looks like it'll fit a larger hand better than my Naos. Might be worth checking those out."
hardwareswap,3dyg06,TheNannerBeans,0,Tue Jul 21 05:50:35 2015 UTC,The pinky isn't really suppose to rest on the mouse. There's a slight indent on it but it's different from the ring finger since you're suppose to grip the side of the mouse using the pinky where as the ring finger you rest on it.
hardwareswap,3dyg06,RackyBolboa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:56:57 2015 UTC,"You're right, I just don't really know what else to call it. For me, the rest is too small for my ring finger to actually sit on it and the pinky finger indention is a very awkward shape.  I think the Naos is a good mouse and is more comfortable than a lot of what's out there, but I really can't see it working well for someone with larger than average hands."

That board is only worth the premium over a B or H series board if you're into overclocking or multi-GPU setups.  And an i5 is much more preferable if you have the budget.

hardwareswap,3dwc37,ThatGuyqwq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:44:46 2015 UTC,"With the research I've done there is a noticeable difference between different brands, drive sizes (5.25 and 3.5 inch), manufacturing methods, materials, and time made.   These variables are known to make very discernable differences such as the stepper motor being louder/quieter, vocal range, etc.   I use an IDE and Arduino program called Moppy compiled by Sammy1Am. How it works is it converts MIDI files into various electrical pulses and signals that is sent to the Arduino, and sent in the drives, producing a frequency that resembles a note."

hardwareswap,3dvor4,yepdude,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:46:46 2015 UTC,"The RAW's an ambidextrous mouse, and whilst the switches are nice and responsive, it wouldn't live up to my consistent gaming. The button placement is a bit weird on the right hand side with the two extra buttons, but overall it is a well made mouse. The G502 in my opinion is ton better. It's a very, very solid mouse, albeit a bit heavy on the braided cord. The adjustable weights are a very nice addition for a mouse in its price range; the button placement is nearly perfect, but it was a bit too narrow for the way I grip my mouse (full palm grip). The sensor is called a ""flawless sensor,"" and it tracks accurately on nearly any surface aside from ones with rough and etched patterns. Overall? It's a far, far better mouse."

Still priority but will get you out around 7 bucks priority instead of the medium flat rate price. Flat rate is better for unusually dense things like a PSU.

hardwareswap,3dtgh2,infinity526,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:58:31 2015 UTC,He has it listed as medium flat rate for the 500gb platter drive and the cpu in the OP. He has the SSDs listed as small flat rate.

Evga so then at least two years left. Just search the classifieds here you'll see they go for $325 and less and any other 780 Ti $250-$300. eBay prices can give you an idea but considering you don't take a 10% cut here prices are usually lower. The higher 780Ti prices I've seen is a $350 kingpin. These are cards I've eyed in the past two weeks. Good luck with the sale.
