(at present, no way to figure out what under-cabinet lighting would look like / how it would influence the somewhat cramped feel of the kitchen design)  Inventor is also crumby for fabrics / organic modeling, so trying to add pillows / sheets / whatever to get a more complete sense of the scene will be nearly impossible, where as something like Cinema 4D it's a matter of drawing a square, applying a texture, and letting it drop.

InteriorDesign,3e3c1k,xdpmk1,2,Tue Jul 21 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"I have to start this by pointing something out. This isn't a personal attack on you it is something almost every poster does. A dimensioned floor plan isn't a plan with the total area indicated. It is a floor plan that has everything dimensioned i.e walls, walk ways, spaces between windows, depths for built in items, etc. This is what an actual dimensioned floor plan looks like  http://imgur.com/TXuwLyJ  Of course, that one is a construction document and quite extensive, but you get the idea. The reason these dimensions are necessary is because it is the only real way to give advice for someone who needs help space planning.   So, when you're placing furniture you want to keep adequate walk ways. These walk ways will determine the shape/dimensions of the furniture that you chose. You can see examples of these walk ways in the floor plan that you posted going around the living room furniture. Most designers stick to codes when it comes to keeping proper circulation around the rooms. Of course the codes aren't legally necessary in personal residences but they are a good starting point when you're space planning.   Some examples include keeping a 5' main circulation path if you have disabled people in the family or will have disabled guests other wise 4' main circulation paths are fine. Even 3' works but it can feel a bit closed off. If you don't have a ton of room 3' works. Other examples include 18"" clearances between chairs/sofas and coffee tables, 2' clearances between the backs of chairs and walls, etc. etc. etc.   That is how you begin to actually space plan which gives you an idea of the size and shape of furniture that you can comfortably fit into a room. That is also the reason it is actually important to have dimensioned floor plans because it is impossible to adequately tell if you have proper clearances.   One thing I like to do is take the floor plan on paper, cut out different sized pieces of paper to represent the furniture I want and move them around on the floor plan to get different configurations. That way when you find something you like if everything is scaled properly you can determine if you have proper circulation paths in the space."

High End Furniture Sales / Design Consultant (1.5 years) Workplace Designer (4 months)   Getting your dream job straight from school isn't very likely. Everybody has to start somewhere - I sold furniture for a year and a half (non-commissioned based) for Residential Design before I finally had a chance to transition into Office Planning. The crap jobs are just something you have to get through.   What is your overall goal? And, if you don't mind me asking, pay? I've noticed Technician jobs pay MUCH better than Design Firms."

InteriorDesign,3dy3bx,toekneewitt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:18:02 2015 UTC,"22k (22,000 US.) is roughly $11 an hourly. On average, fresh from college, interior designers are closer to 35k to 42k. Research your area and see what the average is! Know your worth!!   Get involved with either IIDA or ASID in your community. Get your name out there! A lot of places don't post that they are hiring; they hire from people who have left a positive impression on them. I wouldn't recommend switching to Residential if your goal is Commercial. What does experience in Residential bring you in Commercial? That CAD Tech position sounds like it is a much better entry position!  Follow firms you like on FB! On Instagram! If you are particularity interested in a firm and they post an internship, TRY TO GET IT! My internship wasn't the best experience in the world; but it did give me the knowledge to land the job I currently have."

Residential offers the similarities of space planning, specifying finishes and furnishings, actually talking with clients and working with GCs, budgeting, working with codes, DESIGNING! Many more similarities than a cad tech!  I have been in the industry over 11 years and my goal was commercial as well but landed into a residential firm first.  I was doing way more earlier on in my career than others I knew who graduated at the same time that went into commercial.  Granted it is hard to make the transition from residential to commercial but what I recommend you do definitely get licensed (if that is available in GB) and stay up to date on your continued education and accreditations like LEED.  I would not stay with cad tech.  You need to build your portfolio and confidence with meeting with clients, city officials, contractors, and engineers."

InteriorDesign,3du136,thingthangnyc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:14:30 2015 UTC,I would be willing to start crossposting decorating questions from this sub to /r/decor if people would like that. I'm not sure if it violates any Reddiquette or posting rules or anything though. It'd be like a once a day thing.
InteriorDesign,3du136,xoceanblue08,0,Mon Jul 20 13:18:16 2015 UTC,/r/decor is an interior decorating sub so the posts there don't belong on this sub. Interior design and interior decorating aren't the same thing. We get a lot of decor posts that we remove and refer people to that sub as well as /r/home and /r/furniture depending on the content.
InteriorDesign,3du136,thingthangnyc,2,Mon Jul 20 13:29:32 2015 UTC,"Yes? I'm saying if people post things here that belong in /r/decor, I'd be happy to repost them over there before they get removed from here."
InteriorDesign,3du136,maowsers93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:30:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry i didnt get your question. Yeah you can if you want. When we remove posts we always tell them which sub to check out. I've seen a lot of them cross post after we tell them about the subs but if you don't see them being cross posted you could do that. Some posts we get also belong on /r/diy. We actually get a lot of ""help me fix this specific item"" posts."
InteriorDesign,3du136,KonigTX,2,Mon Jul 20 13:35:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. I try to add comments here and there, like ""This might be better suited for /r/designmyroom or /r/decor"" or whatever, but I am not sure it's always welcome (it's been downvoted a few times when I've done it).   I think there's still a lot of confusion from the subscribers about what this sub is. Might be useful to have a refresher post about it or something."
InteriorDesign,3du136,themaincop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:44:51 2015 UTC,I've seen people posting suggestions like it and it is most welcome! I very much appreciate the effort and agree that many people don't understand what this sub is for.

InteriorDesign,3du136,maowsers93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:00:56 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see this sub slower than filled up with garbage posts that are NOT interior design related.   Watch how you speak about the mods, I have no problem deleting negative posts that do not contribute to the sub."
InteriorDesign,3du136,KonigTX,-1,Wed Jul 22 00:04:49 2015 UTC,"The reason this sub is amazingly slow is because you're far too concerned with these rules.  Just let posts that crossover occur and things will sort themselves out.  Also, let's face it...99% of the world thinks that interior design...is, in fact, decorating.  Educate people to the nuance and difference and allow for growth.  70,000 users here and I see 50 or less active too often.  When things arent working...reshape."
InteriorDesign,3du136,amkftb,2,Tue Jul 21 20:59:12 2015 UTC,"What the rest of the world thinks interior design does not negate what interior design in fact is. This sub is for interior design. Period. End of story. That is why the sub is called ............ are you ready for this ........... Interior Design. I know, it's a mind blowing concept.   Furthermore, we've put resources into the side bar that clearly state what the difference between design and decorating is. People don't read the side bar as you just conveniently demonstrated. I'm not in the business of making daily posts reminding people of what design is and why this sub follows its name sake. Frankly, I'm sick of working a thankless job that pays nothing only to spend half my time constantly having these conversations."
InteriorDesign,3du136,maowsers93,10,Tue Jul 21 21:10:02 2015 UTC,"I subbed to this sub because I thought it'd be filled with pictures of nicely done interiors.

InteriorDesign,3dui53,bradroepke,25,Sun Jul 19 16:34:23 2015 UTC,All of the posters are a little much. I went through this phase in college as well so it's totally understandable. Your living space (and frequently the way one dresses) can represent something about you without being so 'on the nose' or ham fisted if that makes sense. In other words you could reflect that you like these various movies or series in a far more subtle way than literally plastering the walls with posters.
InteriorDesign,3dui53,innanetz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:36:38 2015 UTC,"I was definitely headed down this path. I totally get what you mean by ""a little much"" but I don't what the alternative would be. With that in mind, let's take OP's post as a basis, how would  you approach fixing it?   I'm just trying to think of what would  be the more subtle way to to reflect these interests. Let's say I were to really liked Wes Anderson movies as an example. Instead of just putting up posters of his movie would the better approach ideally be to just try and replicate and incorporate the style and color of Wes Anderson movies into my own rooms?   Also is there a better alternative to movie/TV show posters? Like let's say I really like breaking bad, would getting something like this be ""too on the nose"" still?"
InteriorDesign,3dui53,GutsPunchBallsThrwUp,11,Tue Jul 21 20:03:41 2015 UTC,"I actually like the posters and how you've unified the look with matching frames.  But as a woman, of course it's my job to advocate for throw pillows. ; )  It would give you the little pop of color that's missing.  You could do something like this  http://st.houzz.com/simgs/0a917284033a0bf8_4-8781/contemporary-outdoor-cushions-and-pillows.jpg   or pick out the red or yellow from the text on the posters, or go with a neutral grey or tan.  And a plant or two."
InteriorDesign,3dui53,skizethelimit,7,Mon Jul 20 05:44:08 2015 UTC,"Too many posters, but if you're going to keep them at least make sure they're level.  Add a bit more texture, blinds will help.  Ceiling fan looks old and out of place.  I'd make the neon light less visible so you can't see it at all when the lights are on. Keep it only as mood lighting for when you are gaming, it looks tacky/childish if you use it like a man-cave accessory."
InteriorDesign,3dui53,DreamSandman,9,Mon Jul 20 08:00:47 2015 UTC,Plants and color.
InteriorDesign,3dui53,soal1,9,Sun Jul 19 21:25:05 2015 UTC,"A nice window blind or a set of subtly patterned curtains instead of the bedsheet on the window would refine your look, other than that, quite nice - clean and simple minimalism is never a bad choice."

Would it be possible for you to replace the black curtains with lighter colored ones, as well as your sheets? It's just so dark because of the black 'blocks' in the room, black furniture, bed & curtains.  just some neutral/warm creme color will do. I like the posters, but again, they form more black blocks."

Replace the two rugs with one larger one as an accent color.  If you want to keep the posters then tie the color in.  You could pick up on the deep red in most of the titles or the blue (that seems overkill with that light, though)."

InteriorDesign,3dv8lv,mrs_shrew,2,Mon Jul 20 11:22:22 2015 UTC,"That's a small space indeed.  Tbh you probably don't have enough room for all that you want so you must compromise. Tv/monitor is easy with cables, two desks is out of the question.    I'd consider swinging the sofa round so it's facing either the outside or the trendy brick wall, depending on your space you could have a bookcase behind to separate the kitchen/bed. The desk area might turn out to be a waste of space, so consider buying folding tables.  Go through all your stuff and be brutal.  Only keep the best furniture that complement each other, ditch all your old clothes ( aim for a capsule wardrobe), and only keep the necessities. Sell the rest on gumtree. Think very carefully about buying anything else from now on - you probably won't have space for it - no clothes,  shoes, toiletries,  kitchen pans. I will say buy a mini dishwasher cos that helped me a lot to keep the kitchen good.  With this small space it's vital you keep it tidy. It's small so it'll be a piece of piss to clean, an hour max. Always put your stuff away and make your bed every day (buy matching bed covers or it will look crap), make sure you keep your kitchen area spotless. You need to get into the habit of five minutes each day to clean up.  I really like the website smallapartments.com. Just pick a picture you like and copy it. Buy all your furniture off gumtree second hand, if you don't like it just sell it again.  I love gumtree."

InteriorDesign,3dlppp,lordnecro,2,Fri Jul 17 14:27:32 2015 UTC,It's interesting to me that you see this completely differently than I do. Especially the wood. The only thing I maybe agree with you on is the couch--it needs some pillows and/or a throw.
InteriorDesign,3dlppp,mullacc,2,Fri Jul 17 14:47:46 2015 UTC,Do you think a paint job would fix it or is it the design itself that doesn't appeal to you?
InteriorDesign,3dlppp,Audreyu,2,Fri Jul 17 17:20:21 2015 UTC,"I think paint would definitely go a long ways. Not necessarily something outlandish, but something to give it some color and keep it from being so stark. Paint the walls (and maybe some of the white cross beams), couple paintings and a couple of accent pieces would go a long way in adding color."

InteriorDesign,3dk75r,keefed,14,Thu Jul 16 22:54:04 2015 UTC,"It seems empty because the furniture is all small for the space.  The red area rug is also too small.  If you look at the model space, the rug is going from the couch to the other side of the coffee table (defining that space as a living area.)  The rug might be better closer to the couch or somewhere else in your place.  Try moving the white shelf, table lamp etc. to the other side by the couch.  Consider adding another chair, a big one.  I'd put it on the other side of the couch, by the guitars.  Art will help a lot here too."

Centre the cabinet on the wall it's currently on and put the reeds either side (if the speakers aren't there). Move the large picture to above the lounge. Get rid of all those crates or at least put them in the shelves. Put the amp in the shelves (even if only whilst not in use). Move that white cabinet to the opposite wall (although I personally wouldn't keep it). Bigger rug. Bring the lamp further towards the lounge so it's not jammed up in the corner. Cushions on the lounge. Centre the group of frames above the (now centred) cabinet. Put the blue lamp on the timber cabinet (it's too big for the white one). Here are some more parentheses for you (hi!)."

InteriorDesign,3dk75r,soawhileago,2,Fri Jul 17 00:03:01 2015 UTC,"It looks like in the model, the sofa isn't centered with the alcove/shelves (where you have your TV).  Put the TV on the media center (thing with your speakers on top) you have, center it between the patio door & the alcove. (and align the sofa accordingly).  Put your records and speakers into the alcove.  The area in front of the alcove is now an open for you to put a small dining area. Or you can leave it open. The space is more accessible than it was when more extra space was closer to the patio doors.  Bookend your media center with the crate shelves on both sides, and get rid of that small white shelving unit (it isn't filled up even half way to look it has a proper purpose), or use it as a shoe rack."
InteriorDesign,3dk75r,Lady_badcrumble,6,Fri Jul 17 00:06:41 2015 UTC,No speakers in alcoves!  This is bad for acoustics.
InteriorDesign,3dk75r,ConvertsToMetric,2,Fri Jul 17 00:26:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone else - Tv on a stand (probably the wood stand, but located where the white stand is), records and nick nacks in the alcove. Larger rug, additional comfy chair. Set up a side table by the couch - possibly the white shelf length-wise with the couch like this with lamp and record player. Would it be possible to hang the guitars on the wall? Maybe frame a few of the records and make it into an art feature above and around the couch.  More on the walls and on the floor will actually make the place feel more put together. If you want to go wild, dark curtains on the far wall around the door hung really high."

Get fabric and make covers for each chair at the table sort of like how chair at weddings have covers all the way to the ground. use trendy fabric in the style of chevrons or anything Kate spade-esque  Depending on if you need that much furniture just throw out or donate that plaid couch and wicker seats and get a rug and some beanbag chairs instead.  Cover all wall space in some type of art, working in schools I would suggest you do not use student art, instead thrift some canvas art or cute things you can put on the shelves.

I like the idea of a rug as mentioned earlier, but a rug under a lunch table will get messy. Instead, focus on the sofa area and go for a cheap big coffee table + rug underneath to create a nice sitting area. get rid of broken chairs. pull the room together with plaids/pillows matching or complimenting the rug.  I see you have a board, could that be used as some sort of message  board for teachers-only stuff? Non-school art + plants are a good idea too."

The biggest challenge was not having a place to relax that was not the bed, since we didn't have a living room. Some Sundays were spent all day in bed (bed made, reading on the bed etc, then sleeping in it at night).  The kitchen was ok for that sometimes.  Also even though we had ample closet space, it was hard to keep the place tidy. Our apartment had a washer but no dryer so clothes were draped all over the place in the winter when drying outside was not an option.  I could see how this type of apartment can work for one person but for two people it was difficult to feel like it was really a home rather than just a crash pad.    Edit:  Also want to add that even though we could be in two separate rooms while both at home, the sense of privacy and personal space was still difficult."

InteriorDesign,3da6to,jedrekk,3,Tue Jul 14 20:57:11 2015 UTC,"I think you're misreading the market. There is a massive need for cheap housing for people who immigrate relatively short distances (200-400km) to large cities for college or work. People who don't make much money, go ""home"" every weekend (so they don't need space) and hate the constant game of finding roommates, moving from flat to flat, etc. An alternative to renting a room and having roommates.    They're for people living in the country, their parents' backyard, or moving around.   This looks like a flat in a pre-WWII apartment building.

I don't understand why you think I am misreading the market when we seemed to have defined it in exactly the same way. If anything, you're over estimating the size of the market.

InteriorDesign,3da6to,mrcloudies,20,Wed Jul 15 02:24:59 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the hammock was an awful choice. Should have had a couch that opened up for storage. There's overall very little storage space for clothes and miscellaneous items. There's just the dresser and the closet with the washer.  There's no comfortable space for watching anything.  And absolutely forget about any form of entertaining.   This is for a single person with no friends or family and very little belongings. I'm not seeing practical use of space, and there is no way to comfortably have more then one guest over. Ive seen micro houses that have met these issues much better then this example.   And to top it off, if doesn't look comfortable or inviting, its very stark and boring."

Either make your ""designer"" do what you asked of them, get a refund from the company, or dispute the charge with your credit card company."

Its inly thing to pay a designer for some scheme ideas but to try to get a ""full"" service designer offline seems really silly to me. Part of the reason people go to designers is that it makes it way easier.  For example, with yoh artwork,  its hard to say where exactly itll look the best, even if you do rendering/drawings, some of that stuff is just easier to do in person.

Plus, we live in a city where there aren't very many designers here who are into modern/contemporary.  You're absolutely right though; I'm sure we would've gotten a more comprehensive idea if we went with a local designer.  At this point, I almost want to scrap the entire look.  I do like the bookcase she listed, but I can re-create it with Ikea's Besta shelves for about $500.  I saw this living room on /r/roomporn the other day, and it's very similar to our home.

(About half the price in tuition of Pratt or NYC.) When setting up payment for my loans, I had to pick the 25 year plan to start. It's rough. On that note, I was employed 3 months prior to graduation. I make roughly 41k annually. I am also on the higher end of things. I make $20 an hour - where as a long of the girls I graduate with are closer to $13 - $15. It's just how the industry is trending.  One of my friends has been with a small boutique hospitality firm for about a year now. She doesn't get paid a lot, but enjoys the creative freedom. I get paid relatively high, but do much more office space planning and logistics. (More CAD work / renderings, etc.)   Entry level for Interior Designers is roughly 34k to 43k. It doens't - and will never - have the most glamorous pay. BUT the rewarding feeling of getting to do something you love, EVERY. DAMN. DAY. is worth all of it.   The large schools are great because they provide you with all the basics, a solid education, AND opportunities to network and know the industry. (That's half the battle of getting a job!)

InteriorDesign,3d8xsp,maowsers93,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:41:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, hospitality design is absolutely a viable career option. I don't work in it but I know some people who do. I live in Texas and here it is a some what sought after angle in Interior Design so it can be competitive but it is absolutely possible to become a hospitality designer.   I don't think it is necessary to go to a flashy fancy school in order to become one. You do, however, need to go to a school that is CIDA certified. Most commercial design firms, hospitality included, are going to require a designer with an education from an accredited school. These schools can be found pretty much in every state. You don't have to go to the most expensive art school to obtain this degree. I assume you live in New York so here is a list of schools that are CIDA accredited there:  http://accredit-id.org/accredited-programs/  It is worth nothing that hospitality design can be a bit more involved than other types of design because you end up designing a lot of commercial kitchens. When you're a commercial designer you have to know city, state, and federal building codes and be able to design in compliance with them. Commercial kitchens have a fair amount of responsibility with them so it is important to understand that you're not just going to be ""decorating"" dining rooms. You're actually designing the entire interior of the restaurant including the electrical plans, plumbing walls, lighting plans, etc.   It really is a fun niche in the design industry. I too really want to be a hospitality designer. I'm a senior at in my interior design program and out of the 13 or 14 who just graduated I'd say like 4 or 5 of them landed hospitality jobs. My class that's about to graduate has around the same amount of people who've landed hospitality internships.   As for how long you'll have to be a CAD drafter. From what we've seen as interns, most of the CAD drafters are intern level. Everyone I've seen who has been offered a job from the internship were brought on as jr. designers so procuring an actual design job happens pretty quickly if you're at the right place at the right time. Some people end up being CAD drafters for a few years but you can attempt to avoid that. That's at least from what I've seen.   As for salary it depends on where you live. New York designers are going to make more than Texas designers because of the cost of living. I can say that here entry level designers make around 30-45k Depending on what firm takes you on. The larger firms like Gensler or Lochgroup are going to pay more."
InteriorDesign,3d8xsp,maowsers93,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:32:53 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the reply!  I guess a lot of it is location-dependent. I don't live in NYC but I was assuming that would be the most logical option to work in a firm catered to fine dining clients.  Would you say the rest of the class before got job placements? I'm also curious as to where you are in texas. I see Austin has an accredited program, that would be an awesome place to live."
InteriorDesign,3d8xsp,thetroubleis,2,Tue Jul 14 21:58:09 2015 UTC,"I live in Austin. I'm from here and I fucking love it. I go to Texas State University in San Marcos which is about 25 minutes south of Austin. Texas State University, the University of Texas, and the Houston Art Institute are the biggest producers of interior designers in this state. The two most reputable programs are Texas State and UT.   Everyone who graduates from my program gets a job at an interior design firm or architecture firm when they graduate. I've never heard of anyone who didn't and that is largely because Texas State has the most respected program in Texas. UT is up there too but the general consensus from firms seems to be that they prefer Texas State students. When ever there are student competitions students from UT and Texas State dominate the top place holders. The two schools have different focuses on ID so which school you want to go to depends on what you want to focus on.  That's why I always drive home that a reputable program that is CIDA certified is a must for anyone who wants to become a designer. If you go to an accredited school you'll get a job when you graduate. If you don't there isn't any guarantee that you will. Since my program is so respected within the industry when we start getting internships we get to really pick where we want to go in terms of specific areas within the field. I mean if you wait until the last minute to get an internship you don't and you have to take what ever you get but I know of a few people that have had 2 or 3 internships throughout their schooling career. They get to sample a little of everything."
InteriorDesign,3d6ihf,maktub123,9,Mon Jul 13 22:21:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think you necessarily have to go for your masters. I have my Bachelors in Interior Design and it's allowed me to work in a lot of different areas. I started with custom tile/flooring/counter top designs, moved on to custom window treatments and now I run my own small residential design firm. Masters will allow you to teach so that is something to consider.   Salary wise, it depends on where in the country you are located. Starting salary here in the Northeast can be anywhere from $35,000 - $50,000 (if you can get in with a larger firm). For me, it's never been about the money, I took a pay cut by opening my own business, but I build closer relationships with my clients than if I worked at a large firm.   The things I find most fulfilling are just getting to do something different and creative every day. Getting to meet lots of new people, either clients, or other people in the industry. And I love being my own boss. I get to take on the jobs I know I'll enjoy, which always seem to end up much more successful than those jobs I've been forced to do.  Also, the most important tip I ever learned in school is to network, network, network. You never know when you may need that random contact you met 5 years ago in some obscure industry. It's always good to have contacts you can reach out to for help on a project!"
InteriorDesign,3d6ihf,kel-c,5,Tue Jul 14 02:00:38 2015 UTC,"OP might not need to go for a masters, but they should really have some sort of education on the subject. I suppose it depends on whether or not they want to do residential or commercial design. I feel like with residential you may not need as much schooling, especially if you're looking more to decorate than actually design and place partitions, etc.   OP, please make sure you understand the distinction between a designer and a decorator. They are two very different positions and being a designer requires some level of knowledge and in many states, NCIDQ certification, which requires you to have 4 years of schooling or something equivalent to that, plus a certain amount of work hours. Education will hep you immensely when taking that test.   It's always frustrating for designers/ interior architects to explain to people outside the industry that no, I'm not just ""picking paints and fabrics"" (but let's be real, that part is petty fun sometimes), but that I'm actually doing real work like space planning and interior architecture! Good luck! :)"

My school offers a BS, but every other school I looked at (Pratt, Suffolk, Endicott, etc) offered a fine arts degree. Look into different programs and how they teach, what they teach, and what their reputation is in the surrounding area. My school has a great reputation for graduating very well-prepared students and it shows when we start looking for jobs after graduation."

InteriorDesign,3d6ihf,kel-c,2,Tue Jul 14 02:57:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely go with the BA- I'm pretty much in the same boat.  I had a lot of trouble finding masters programs that would accept me without any type of design background.  I think I found one Architecture program for returning students, but I quickly realized that the BA was a much, much more affordable route to go.  Look into what the best programs are in your region (or the regions you'd like to move to after finishing).

In the end it has all worked out, but it was only because of an unexpected inheritance that I was able to finally pay off the loan. Only in the last few years have I been able to actually start to build up any sort of savings, and most of that has gone right back into my business. There is a lot of sacrifice in the beginning, but overall I think it's been worth it. I once had an instructor tell me that it took her 15 years of being in the industry before she finally started to make any real money, but she's so happy she put in the work because she's always loved what she does.

These solutions are functional, enhance the quality of life and culture of the occupants and are aesthetically attractive. Designs are created in response to and coordinated with the building shell and acknowledge the physical location and social context of the project. Designs must adhere to code and regulatory requirements, and encourage the principles of environmental sustainability. The interior design process follows a systematic and coordinated methodology, including research, analysis and integration of knowledge into the creative process, whereby the needs and resources of the client are satisfied to produce an interior space that fulfills the project goals.  Interior design includes a scope of services performed by a professional design practitioner, qualified by means of education, experience and examination, to protect and enhance the health, life safety and welfare of the public. These services may include any or all of the following tasks:   Research and analysis of the client's goals and requirements; and development of documents, drawings and diagrams that outline those needs. Formulation of preliminary space plans and two and three dimensional design concept studies and sketches that integrate the client's program needs and are based on knowledge of the principles of interior design and theories of human behavior. Confirmation that preliminary space plans and design concepts are safe, functional, aesthetically appropriate, and meet all public health, safety and welfare requirements, including code, accessibility, environmental, and sustainability guidelines. Selection of colors, materials and finishes to appropriately convey the design concept and to meet socio-psychological, functional, maintenance, lifecycle performance, environmental, and safety requirements. Selection and specification of furniture, fixtures, equipment and millwork, including layout drawings and detailed product description; and provision of contract documentation to facilitate pricing, procurement and installation of furniture. Provision of project management services, including preparation of project budgets and schedules. Preparation of construction documents, consisting of plans, elevations, details and specifications, to illustrate non-structural and/or non-seismic partition layouts; power and communications locations; reflected ceiling plans and lighting designs; materials and finishes; and furniture layouts. Preparation of construction documents to adhere to regional building and fire codes, municipal codes, and any other jurisdictional statutes, regulations and guidelines applicable to the interior space. Coordination and collaboration with other allied design professionals who may be retained to provide consulting services, including but not limited to architects; structural, mechanical and electrical engineers, and various specialty consultants. Confirmation that construction documents for non-structural and/or non-seismic construction are signed and sealed by the responsible interior designer, as applicable to jurisdictional requirements for filing with code enforcement officials. Administration of contract documents, bids and negotiations as the client's agent. Observation and reporting on the implementation of projects while in progress and upon completion, as a representative of and on behalf of the client; and conducting post-occupancy evaluation reports."""

InteriorDesign,3d6ihf,scottperezfox,3,Tue Jul 14 09:34:30 2015 UTC,"It shows that you are familiar with safety codes (fire safety, egress, etc) as well as knowing about how design works in practice (interacting with clients, the entire design process from beginning concepts to final work), and things like space planning and knowledge about materials and stuff.   Basically it shows people that you have the knowledge necessary to practice correctly. Not all states require it, but it's good to have anyway since it's basically a universal marker that you actually know what you're doing and have been educated properly. In my opinion it's probably more useful for commercial designers but residential designers should have it too if it's not already required."
InteriorDesign,3d6ihf,maowsers93,-4,Tue Jul 14 11:38:30 2015 UTC,"Listen to the latest podcast from Big Design Small Budget, where Betsy talks about be[com]ing a designer, largely by being self-taught. She encourages schooling, but doesn't rely on it to automatically get you a job.  http://www.bigdesignsmallbudget.com/so-you-want-to-be-a-designer/"
InteriorDesign,3d6ihf,scottperezfox,4,Tue Jul 14 02:21:53 2015 UTC,Be ware of these posts. Many states require a degree to become licensed in order to call yourself an interior designer. Interior design is very technical and requires a degree in almost every case. Some can get away with not having one for residential design but if you want to go into commercial (which holds over 90% of the jobs and money) you will absolutely need a degree and in some cases a license. Most interior design firms thst do residential design will also require a formal education.
InteriorDesign,3d6ihf,maowsers93,-2,Tue Jul 14 02:38:49 2015 UTC,"I guess that's the difference between architecture and decor. If someone is selecting paints and furniture, and not even modifying the building (as is the case with many renters) you don't need a license."
InteriorDesign,3d6ihf,scottperezfox,3,Tue Jul 14 13:52:07 2015 UTC,"That is interior decorating not interior design. Interior designers modify the entire interior of the shell of a building and change not only walls but electrical work, re-route plumbing, and lighting.   No, you don't need a license to pic furniture or paint colors but you generally do need a license (or you need to work underneath someone who has a license) to do what an interior designer does. Licensed interior designers create their own construction documents to send to the city for building approval."
InteriorDesign,3d6ihf,maowsers93,-2,Tue Jul 14 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"I guess you have to know your market. When most people renting an apartment in New York think of interior design, they generally mean decorating, rather than remodeling. When embedded with an architect or construction firm, it's something different."
InteriorDesign,3d6ihf,Laureltess,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:03 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with a market. Decorating is interior decorating not interior design. Period. End of story. That is just a fact. You don't need a degree or a license to be an interior decorator so if OP just wants to find furniture for rentals then they don't need a degree or license.   If OP wants to be an interior designer they're going to need a degree and often times a license. You keep using the two terms interchangeably. They are not the same thing. Your first post states:   Listen to the latest podcast from Big Design Small Budget, where Betsy talks about be[com]ing a designer, largely by being self-taught. She encourages schooling, but doesn't rely on it to automatically get you a job.   This pod cast isn't about becoming a designer. It is about becoming a decorator. You use the term designer incorrectly as does the person who posted the pod cast if they in fact are encouraging people to become ""designers"" to only decorate rooms.   Edit: And by the way I'm listening to this podcast now and it is trash. I mean pure trash. She is saying that big designers don't know how to use AutoCAD and just farm out their jobs to people who know how to do it. This is so irresponsibly incorrect that I don't know where to begin. I don't know a single designer who doesn't know how to use AutoCAD among other things. Big designers hire other interior designers who are starting their careers to do their CAD drawings for them so they don't have to do it. That doesn't mean they don't know how to use it. This podcast is wrong, uses the term designer when they should be using the term decorator, and quite frankly is irresponsible when putting it out into the stratosphere for people actually looking to get into the field.   TLDR: This podcast is pure trash and shouldn't be taken seriously by anyone who actually wants to be an interior designer."
InteriorDesign,3d6ihf,maowsers93,2,Tue Jul 14 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"Small firms might not use CAD or BIM that much but the larger firms definitely do. In my city you really won't get hired unless you know AutoCAD, Revit, or Sketchup."
InteriorDesign,3d6ihf,Laureltess,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:02:06 2015 UTC,"Yup, in my city you won't get hired without knowing BIM or CAD. Revit is important to know but to a lesser extent. The larger Firms use it, but in here (Texas) everyone uses CAD, even the small residential firms.   I wish Revit were more widely used but a lot of the smaller firms get priced out of it. That sucks because I really hate SketchUp."
InteriorDesign,3d6ihf,xoceanblue08,2,Wed Jul 15 00:40:22 2015 UTC,"I'm in Boston, here it's different from firm to firm, but the larger ones are starting to adopt Revit. I taught myself Revit and my school taught me Vectorworks (thanks..) but I have a super basic knowledge of AutoCAD and I'm hoping to teach myself a bit more. Most places use Revit to some extent, so right now (and in the future here) it'll probably be the most important, with AutoCAD as a second program."

So as to make the most of it, I would suggest you get to know what you like and you don't like. Make a Pinterest page and start pinning into albums. It's ok to not like one particular style as sometimes a location will demand one style of architecture over another. I am building in Canberra in a mid-century modern style because that's perfect for the location and the block, but I'm going super modern on my Sydney penthouse because that works best and I really do like the different styles of architecture. Houzz is a great app as well that I can recommend.   Next, I would start looking around for a good architect. Get recommendations or search for architects based on the style of architecture you want. they should give you some questions to answer that will help you to put together your project brief and elucidate what it is you love / want / need / can afford."
InteriorDesign,3d4643,doomfront,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:08:56 2015 UTC,"First of all, congrats on building in Canberra, really lovely place and lots of growth! I 100% agree, it is a fantastic opportunity, but in that way I also feel more pressure in the sense I don't want to screw it up haha. I've always admired the really modern, contemporary themes people incorporate into their homes. When I think of contemporary though (this is with my limited knowledge mind you), I picture porcelain tiled bathrooms and kitchens contrasted with areas of timber, all of which are premium materials that have the price to match so I'm not really sure I could really get something like that and still build a large house within my budget.   I have been looking at some Georgian styled houses and they have a really warm feeling about them which I cant really explain haha. Is this the type of style you are going for with your home in Canberra?"
InteriorDesign,3d4643,doomfront,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:13:03 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I'm reading this correctly because that is a lot  of land. Either way seems like you need to get with an architect

I was hoping that I could gather some ideas that appealed to me before seeing an architect so I don't seem completely clueless haha"
InteriorDesign,3d125o,livingsituation1234,5,Sun Jul 12 17:12:09 2015 UTC,2K isn't a lot. Get fewer high quality pieces that'll last rather than more cheap furniture like you got in college. I'd personally start with a couch that you like and build around that.
InteriorDesign,3d125o,mcthiel,2,Sun Jul 12 21:12:21 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with this. Hold on to most of your existing furniture and invest in a nice sofa. If you'd like to spend some of the rest of that budget (if there is any left), then spend it on soft goods and decor that can kick your existing furniture up a notch in terms of style and class.   My spouse and I bought a terrific sectional sofa from ikea, and believe it or not, it was a great investment. It was one of their higher-end products and fabrics, and no one has guessed it is ikea yet. In all, it was ~$1,500.   If you'd like to get something from a store of more repute, I think CB2 or West Elm have great products that may look great in that style of loft. Good luck!"
InteriorDesign,3d0mqw,Gmania3790,4,Sun Jul 12 14:49:10 2015 UTC,"Hi looks like you have a great place.   I would suggest that you buy 3 desk/tables that can be used as desk for the working station and for the dining area. When you have visitors you can easily put them together and have a long table for parties and dinners.   Also buy the same chairs for the working station as the dining area - gives a more balanced picture.   Think more about m3 than m2 - by this I mean think wall space more than floor space - make some books selfs that goes all the way to the ceiling. Stack away things you don't need on a daily basis in boxes that match your interior.   A big carpet by the sofa area will make an livingroom area maybe with a small table on the back of the sofa against the work area. Here you can have a lamp, boex with stationary and stuff.   Good luck decoration...   All the best Malene/Deerstedt"

InteriorDesign,3d0mqw,TheDivergentStars,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:56:03 2015 UTC,Whose ever desk will be under the window will hate it. Nothing like sunlight shining into your face and baking in the sunlight/heat even with the curtains drawn. Try wrapping the desks 90 degrees into that corner.

The fully-closed counter front is the universal visual signal for the separation of an otherwise open space into 'employee' and 'customer' sides.  Using the open front makes it look like a table that customers are allowed to circulate on all sides of."
InteriorDesign,3cyyxx,Jordanis,3,Sun Jul 12 07:40:57 2015 UTC,"Eh, I would expect the customers know what's up in this case."
InteriorDesign,3cyyxx,D_Livs,2,Sun Jul 12 22:04:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, sure, most of them--don't underestimate how oblivious some customers can be.  But it creates a moment of confusion while the customer's hindbrain works out the conflicting signals (open table legs vs the scale, particularly).  It will create a slight negative association with your business for a certain number of customers--the momentary pop out of the comfort zone gives people the impression that they don't belong there, because people who belong there would have been in their comfort zone the whole time.  If it had some other benefit, then sure, fine, s'cool.  Tradeoffs.  It wouldn't even have to be much of a benefit, because it's not like this is some huge effect (probably).  But I can't help but figuring that if they extended the wood paneling on the front of the counter down another 50%, it would read seamlessly as 'retail counter' without compromising their aesthetic vision for the space."

InteriorDesign,3coyb7,kfemeyer,8,Thu Jul 9 16:39:09 2015 UTC,looks great. I would consider changing the hardware to a bronze and maybe painting the strip of drywall above the cabinets but other than that I can't think of much else to do.

InteriorDesign,3coyb7,ChrisWithanF,3,Thu Jul 9 17:43:40 2015 UTC,I would go with a light gray to match your backsplash and counter tops. Dark enough to distinguish it from the ceiling but not so dark to make the room feel smaller. If you do paint that you may need to consider painting the dividing wall on the right too although I can't see the rest of the room so that might not make sense.

InteriorDesign,3coyb7,dlev_,16,Thu Jul 9 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"No I actually did it with a brush. so it took forever, but gave it that grain texture. For newbies I would recommend the Rustoleum cabinet kit that I used. Its 100% satisfaction so that helps put you at ease, but in no way is it quick. It took me a looooong time to do all the cabinets and frames. Also the top coat they provide sucks so I had to use a different one which takes some time to learn to apply to avoid streaks. I'd recommend you watch rustoleum cabinet tutorial on youtube and multiply it by 10 to get an idea of how much work it will be. The video makes it look too easy. Expect your kitchen to be a mess the entire time during the project."
InteriorDesign,3coyb7,Bermnerfs,4,Thu Jul 9 17:41:18 2015 UTC,"This is great advice. I want to paint my cabinets. What did you use for the top coat? And what color is the paint? I want my kitchen this color! Also, did you have to sand the cabinets or anything? I have ZERO experience in painting furniture. Also, how much did it all cost you?"
InteriorDesign,3coyb7,JohnLeePettimore,3,Thu Jul 9 20:32:19 2015 UTC,"Usually when you paint furniture/cabinets you want to do a light sanding between every coat of paint and top coat. At the end, give it a rub down with a scrap of paper grocery bag-type paper to get off any remaining rough spots without ruining the finish."
InteriorDesign,3coyb7,Um_nothankyou,5,Fri Jul 10 04:32:15 2015 UTC,"actually the point of the rustoleum kit is that it cuts out the sanding, so I didn't have to sand I did however have to do almost the same amount of work but with something called the Deglosser, which stripped the cabinets cleaned and made them very dry so the paint stuck. No harm in sanding tho, I would recommend it to anyone who wants longer lasting paint."
InteriorDesign,3coyb7,rac3r5,2,Fri Jul 10 13:43:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, neat! I didn't know that, I've never used one of those kits. Definitely helps make a better and longer lasting finish when you're just going at it with your own supplies though. Little tedious, but always worth it if you want your work to last. If I ever redo a kitchen again I'll definitely have to look into that rustoleum kit, sounds like it's probably a good little investment."
InteriorDesign,3coyb7,rac3r5,3,Sat Jul 11 03:52:45 2015 UTC,"I used Rustoleum cabinet kit, comes with multiple color choices. Just ask the paint department to color it for you once you've paid for the kit. Do it one trip to save time. I went with Espresso. I used Minwax water-based Polycrylic Semi-gloss Protective Finish. I think I couldn't find it at Lowes but my homedepot had it. Sanding is not necessary with the rustoleum product but it doesn't harm the process. It will help the paint stick better. They provide a deglosser and scrub pads which should help sort of clean/dry and scuff up the surface so the paint sticks. I recommend you watch the rustoleum video and then multiply the work by 8 because they make it look too easy and it is a lot more then that. Plus you have to repeat the process for each cabinet door front and back and the frame."

They give 100% satisfaction so thats good. I would not use their topcoat. I would use something else. Glaze at your own risk, when I was buying the kit some other people who bought it told me not to glaze if I am doing light colors since they turn a little yellow.

InteriorDesign,3coyb7,NightsToo,4,Fri Jul 10 03:50:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would take off a week from work. I did this during a full 9-5 and a million other things going on like birthday parties and buying a motorcycle. This kitchen is the central part of my house and having it in project phase for 2 months was not good. But setting a deadline to have it done for a party at our house helped get it all pulled together at the end. Also I would do the cabinets first, then backsplash then flooring. I did flooring first then cabinets then backsplash. I realized later that during the project so much stuff fell on the floor it would have been looking much newer if I did it last. I would also not use Rustoleum protective coat (and I didn't after reading forums). I used Minwax water-based Polycrylic Semi-gloss Protective Finish and maybe would have used the spray can version of the top coat so that it would have been more even and easier to apply. The shine is very visible but so are the defects then, I think a can would have made it an even application. Other then that no. I've done the flooring before in my foyer, so I knew what I was working with and had that done in 2 days. The backsplash would have taken 2 full days as well if I was dedicated. Cabinets are a 2 week long project due to drying time and application. You need to have a ton of space set aside for these cabinets to lay and dry. Also I highly recommend a mask. I was working in a well ventilated garage but after like day 5 my brain felt like jello and I was really feeling the affects of the fumes. Took me like 3 days of not painting to feel normal."

InteriorDesign,3co8hk,spvcejam,17,Thu Jul 9 13:12:43 2015 UTC,"I would start with taking down the heavy drapes. Leave the upper windows uncovered. Hang some sheer half curtains on a spring rod on the lower windows. (If your windows are double hungs and you like to open them, you may have to double rod the sheer curtains one at the top and one at the bottom and position them a little higher on the window so that you can both open the window and gain light and privacy. Depending on how figured or sheer the curtains are, you may not need anything else, but if you find you want more privacy at night, then you might have to rehang some drapes."
InteriorDesign,3co8hk,cicalino,5,Thu Jul 9 13:46:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion. The one big problem I just realized I left out of the OP was heat.

But if you need to block out the afternoon sun, then I think I would also put up some of those lighter weight drapes that slide easily on rings and then you could adjust for the bright sun as needed without a lot of work."
InteriorDesign,3co8hk,rsxstock,6,Thu Jul 9 14:15:06 2015 UTC,i believe there are blinds/shades that are bottom up
InteriorDesign,3co8hk,cicalino,2,Thu Jul 9 13:27:49 2015 UTC,"I like bottom up shades, but I find they are a little different style, more modern, than this old bay window calls for.

InteriorDesign,3co8hk,districtly,6,Thu Jul 9 14:25:49 2015 UTC,"I have the frosted film in my bedroom. You cut it with a box cutter to align with your windows perfectly, so it's not unattractive.  Bottom-up blinds are another option but more expensive."
InteriorDesign,3co8hk,dubsfan,2,Thu Jul 9 13:45:37 2015 UTC,I would also suggest that you look into frosted film. The sunlight still comes in and you still have your privacy.
InteriorDesign,3co8hk,cocomoto,2,Thu Jul 9 14:22:10 2015 UTC,I second the frosted film. Have it in my house and it works great for letting light in while keeping privacy.

I finally saw it in person about a month ago on a friend's window and realized it looked really good. I got a totally different design for myself, and am in love. I'm in a basement apartment and the amount more natural light we get now is astounding, plus, it looks good both from the inside and the outside."

You cannot see a person inside of a room in the daytime unless they happen to be standing right at the window. At night when there are lights on in the room they can indeed see in, so that is when you need to draw the blinds or curtains or whatever. If I really thought I needed to half cover the windows I would use café curtains on tension rods to go with the style of the architecture. You don't have to do frilly ruffled ones, they can be tailored and hung with rings. For the heat problem the only thing I can think of would be the light reflecting film."

Edit: I did start to listen to it (and I'll finish sometime) and she says ""one night"" (maybe evening). OP wants light in the daytime. In the evenings when no light is coming in he can close the drapes and be fine."

Peace of mind and laziness I guess."
InteriorDesign,3co8hk,alickstee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:55:32 2015 UTC,I'm confused. I guess I'd have to be in your apartment to actually see the problem.  I suppose I'd have to go with sheers that would let light in during the day but obscures the view. I feel for your situation as I prefer to roam the house in a state of undress myself from time to time. Fortunately the views out my windows are all just big lovely trees. Wish I could think of a better idea for you.
InteriorDesign,3co8hk,andtheodor,4,Fri Jul 10 11:19:59 2015 UTC,"What about a layered solution?  A set of sheers for the daylight with a thicker, lined layer of curtains on top."
InteriorDesign,3co8hk,growamustache,2,Thu Jul 9 18:29:32 2015 UTC,"I just installed new windows with interior bottom-up cellular blinds. I love them because when I pull up the blinds it almost gets brighter because instead of all coming in and hitting dark wood floors or rugs, all the light gets scattered throughout the room. I keep the bottom shades up almost all the time for privacy now because there's very little impact on light."
InteriorDesign,3co8hk,Keilly,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:50:32 2015 UTC,I also loved out cell blinds.  They opened on both ends too.
InteriorDesign,3co8hk,pixlfarmer,2,Thu Jul 9 17:25:59 2015 UTC,"Are you sure those neighbours can see in clearly during daytime? The position of the sun, and relative brightness from inside your apt may make this less of a problem than first thought.  I can only make out dark shapes and no real detail though my neighbours windows in the day.    Also, I'd imagine most AirBnB people are tourists, and so are out seeing the sights most days. Still, if it makes you more comfortable, cafe style sheer curtains are one cheep good looking solution as otherwise noted here. I wouldn't stick anything to the window pane if I was renting it. conversely if I was an owner I'd go for a better looking solution.    For a quick cheap solution: Ikea sells sheers, rods, and an iron-on adhesive tape. So cut them to size, use the tape to fold the edges back on themselves for a neat edge. Dyeing white sheers would be simple too."

I agree that the tile is nice, but I might suggest switching out the toilet and sink just to break up all the blue.  As for storage, add some more hooks to the back of the door, especially since you want to get rid of the towel racks. Then add a small towel bar or ring to the wallnon the right of the sink. Is there space to add a hook next to the shower? Add some shelves above the toilet. As for your actual shower, one of those hanging caddies be the best solution."
InteriorDesign,3cok6l,dino_snack,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:08:56 2015 UTC,"Adding something to look at on the white half of the walls will help direct your eyes away from all the blue, which is kind of overwhelming.  That could be framed art, but it could also be a storage cabinet.  I would buy a larger, closed-sided basket along these lines to put on top of the john for the TP etc, which again will help to break up all the blue.  In the shower, your best storage option is a pole style caddy for shampoo etc."

InteriorDesign,3clmvi,akaltyaz,58,Wed Jul 8 21:34:30 2015 UTC,"You need GREEN! Get some plants in there for sure. Don't overcrowd the space with furniture, as you don't want it to take away from the fact that it is outdoors. I'd re-arrange the seating so it's more open diagonally as opposed to facing directly.  Maybe get a colored ceramic garden stool, some big hurricane candles and/or lanterns for the corners?"
InteriorDesign,3clmvi,SilverKnot,3,Wed Jul 8 21:45:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been meaning to re arrange the seating or replace the furniture altogether, it feels too closed off/crowded as it is.  any recommendations on simple low maintenance outdoor furniture? Plants are in the works as well. Thanks for your response!"
InteriorDesign,3clmvi,Big_Pink,3,Thu Jul 9 00:46:24 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are suggesting to get new seating, but I disagree. I think rearranging it would suffice for now. The armchair can move back toward a corner which would free up room for a fun swing chair or hammock chair. It will make the space more inviting and they're sooo comfortable to nap in. What about replacing the table in the corner with an outdoor bar? You can have a lot of fun with this space! At the moment, if you focus more on making it enjoyable than a showcase, you will get more use out of it. Start with some pieces off craigslist or garage sales so you won't hemorrhage money while you try out different purposes for the space.  Once you get a feel for what activities you actually enjoy out there the most, only then should you start plunking down good money on permanent pieces and decor. They should fit YOUR lifestyle, you shouldn't have to live your life around the decor. Like you said, it's a new place, you haven't figured out what to do with the space quite yet, but you were drawn to it enough to buy this house. Make it your sanctuary. Good luck and keep us updated!"
InteriorDesign,3clmvi,DTDTD,13,Thu Jul 9 04:17:05 2015 UTC,"I'm scared to go out there.  Do I have to stay on the squares?  Is the gravel barefoot friendly?  It seems very formal with that grid on the ground. Could you take that out and carpet it with moss or some sort of ground cover but still have a rocky path?   And add a bunch of potted plants?   Can you hang a bunch of stuff on the walls?  And add some variation to the colors and textures and patterns on the furniture?  I like the idea of adding fairy lights, and candles. It's not cozy yet.

InteriorDesign,3clmvi,funnyredditname,7,Thu Jul 9 00:47:51 2015 UTC,Like others have said - green! I'd do tall narrow planters (bamboo or boxwood maybe) or a wall planter (http://www.sowanddipity.com/succulent-planters/) against the walls since they are a bit depressing. Soft patio lights strung across. Small scale furniture or just a bar and reading chair. Small scale plants on a side table.

InteriorDesign,3clmvi,prancingbadger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:04:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the hanging light is enough lighting currently, I'll see what else I can add."
InteriorDesign,3clmvi,goodeyesniperr,5,Thu Jul 9 00:52:15 2015 UTC,"Okay, slightly different take here. I think the space is almost unusable with three sides being sliding door access. You need to remove the sliding doors on at least two sides and preferably all of them. Replace with glass accordion doors.   Dig down the rock and dirt enough so that you can build a wooden deck that level to the floor of the house.  With the space open from three sides or even just two you are free to place a central feature in the courtyard(like a small fountain). Plenty of greenery, a lattice on the wall beside the window, and you have enough room to move furniture around at will."
InteriorDesign,3clmvi,SarahMakesYouStrong,2,Thu Jul 9 00:22:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm planning on changing all the glass in the house in the next year or two bc of the heat in Houston summer. Accordion doors sound interesting, but I think I like the unobstructed view of the glass doors better."
InteriorDesign,3clmvi,goodeyesniperr,3,Thu Jul 9 00:51:58 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have mentioned plants, which are important, but I think the most important thing is the ground covering: you should consider placing some decking material in, say, a chevron pattern over the cement to make that space more user-friendly. Next, I think the furniture that is currently there is too bulky/large for the space and should be replaced with something lighter with more negative space like this. Next, you'll need some planters and a central table; I like these ones because they are both warm and nature-colored. I'd also string some outdoor lights across the space for atmosphere. Lastly, I think a water or fire element would increase that zen feel you're looking for - make sure you can see this element from all directions!"

Plants are vital, of course, but you need to group them organically rather than formally. You also ought to use them to obscure, but not block entirely, the view from one side of the house to the other. I would definitely avoid any sort of central planting or fountain -- start with dense, assymetrical plant groups, let furniture follow.  Would you believe the Kickstarter offices in Brooklyn have a similar courtyard? Here is what they did, which I thought was stunning."

InteriorDesign,3cmupo,IntDesignQuestion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:23:54 2015 UTC,"I think once you get some furniture in here and define living vs. dining using rugs, you'll see it's not that weird.  I assume that dining goes to the left of the fireplace.  For the nook to the immediate right of the fireplace, either a floor lamp and potted plant, or a narrow bookshelf (depending on your storage needs).  With just the two photos I can't see the rest of the space, but the living room goes where you were standing when you took the pics.  If you have a sectional, it will probably float into the middle of the room rather than being pushed into a corner, but that depends on the size."
InteriorDesign,3cmupo,Petit_Hibou,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:26:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply!  See, that's the strange thing. I would normally agree that you'd put a dining set there, but directly behind where I'm standing is a decently wide area that I think was moreso intended for that purpose:  http://i.imgur.com/LFO0n7P.jpg?1  I've seen other suites staged by realtors that placed a table + rug there to great effect. In fact, that's one of the things that drew me to the condo in the first place; you can't see them in that photo, but to the left is a wall of three-quarter windows that look out towards a large field. It's a nice view, and if I'm going to sit down with people and eat I'd rather it be there than facing the wall.  I suppose I could do something else with that area, but I'm not sure what."
InteriorDesign,3cjnwe,MacEwanM,3,Wed Jul 8 12:56:13 2015 UTC,"It is hard to tell, is the empty space beside the fire place supposed to be for wood storage?

A red something on the kitchen counter and a green plant on the coffee table, everything else is brown or beige. I could see interesting uses of color in those recesses if there was more color about the place."
InteriorDesign,3cjnwe,gzpz,3,Wed Jul 8 18:57:09 2015 UTC,"I would completely eliminate the alcoves. It would be very cheap and easy. Just have a contractor (or IDY if you're so inclined) to stud out each opening and sheetrock over it so it is flush with the surrounding walls. Texture, paint and you're done. The only hiccup is the mantle. Is it wood or just bumped out sheetrock? If it's sheetrock then it would be easy to tear it out and and flush up with the wall and you can go and buy another mantle that fits just over the fireplace. If it's wood then it may require a little more work, but still shouldn't be a big deal."

For some reason interior designers LIKE to be called interior decorators there. That is New York specific so don't take that understanding and apply it to other states.   Here is the curriculum and it looks like it's focusing on decorating https://www.nyiad.edu/courses/interior-design/outline  That's fine if you want to be (as it is known in New York) and interior decorator, but the curriculum doesn't look like it has a lot to do with building structure to me. If that's what you're looking for you might be disappointed.   But like I said, New York's environment for decorators/designers is different than that of the rest of the United States. You should know that with this degree and any future experience you have in the field may not qualify you to work as a designer in other states, especially if they have practicing acts.   It really all depends on what you want to do. Here is a list of CIDA accredited schools in New York if you want to look at other options.   http://accredit-id.org/accredited-programs/  Even with all that said CIDA accredited schools all focus on different things. I live in Texas and here our two big design schools are the University of Texas and Texas State. I go to Texas State and while we have a foundation in structural understanding my school focuses on business. The University of Texas on the other hand focuses on the architectural aspect of design. Their design program is in their architecture department. If that's something you're interested in I'd just shop around and see what the different schools offer. You'll find that ID programs are in different departments in different schools and those departments dictate the specialty that that school has in interior design."
InteriorDesign,3cg4f9,maowsers93,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I was looking through the accredited list before, it's how I found out that NYIAD's program wasn't CID-accredited.  I'm also not in NY. I'm in VA ... but I liked the fact that with this program I could get the education at my own pace/online.  I like the fact that the modules teach you about floor plans, lighting, etc., but I guess that's more design-based and not local codes and whatnot. So that could be problematic ... but since I mostly want to focus on the decorator aspect, I think that it's probably worth it for me.  I just don't know how having that on my resume would look for potential client or employer.  Thanks for your reply and input! :)"
InteriorDesign,3cg4f9,maowsers93,2,Tue Jul 7 17:54:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you're into the decorating aspect then it sounds like a good program for you. You're correct about the codes aspect. CIDA programs require a heavy code based curriculum along with a lot of tech classes and miscellaneous things like HVAC. A decorating course isn't going to teach you that because it isn't necessary for that field.   As for jobs and resume info here is what the licensing act in VA looks like for interior designers:  ""VIRGINIA  Type of Act: Allows for Sign and/or Seal Title: ""Certified Interior Designer""  Post-HS Education & Experience Required: Education: 4 years Total Education Plus Experience: 6 years  Examination Required: NCIDQ  Continuing Education for Renewal: None  State Board or Agency: Virginia APELSCIDLA Board 3600 West Broad Street Richmond, VA 23230-4917 T: (804) 367-8512 or (840) 367-8506 F: (804) 367-2475""  https://www.asid.org/content/state-licensing-regulations#.VZwTt_lVhBc  So, if you graduate for that school in that program it may prevent you from taking the NCIDQ which is the licensing exam. Also, many employers look for people who've graduated from CIDA schools so that could impact your ability to work under a licensed designer or work in commercial design.   Again, all of that may not even matter if you're wanting to just be a decorator but if you're wanting to be a designer you may look for a different school."

InteriorDesign,3cfzgd,nahuatl,6,Tue Jul 7 16:49:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know how other people will feel, but I think this is starting to border on asking for free professional services.  A lot of what I see in this sub is ""hey help me lay out some furniture in my apartment"" or ""hey how do I not look like a socially inept bachelor"" and those seem fine.  But if someone who wasn't family came to me and asked me to design a kitchen for them I would send them a contract and fee proposal...  That said:  1) I see lots of successful kitchen design with either all white or with the contrasting black countertop.  Both can look great, just depends on what you like.    2) I kind of like the peninsula from a design side, but from a practicality side I'd probably install something with cabinets.  The way it is now would be great for someone in a wheel chair (speaking practically) but unless that includes you or your likely guests, then getting more storage would be better.    3) Continued flooring is typically better, in my opinion.  I think it depends where you are though.  I lived a few years in Florida and the way you have it now is very typical there.  It's cool tile underfoot, durable, looks nice in a tropical aesthetic, and is easy to clean.  I'm in Chicago now and hardwood is more common, with maybe a tile transition in the kitchen.    4)  You really need a cohesive plan here, and how you do the rest of the apartment (since it's an open plan) will affect this too.  This could go a lot of different ways, I'd have to sit down with you and go over options."
InteriorDesign,3cfzgd,PostPostModernism,4,Tue Jul 7 17:35:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like that is what most of the posts on this sub are. People don't get that this is a profession that people charge for. I almost never post help suggestions because I'm not going to take the time to come up with a design scheme for someone when I'd normally charge for it. Plus, the times I have done it the person ended up pming me asking me for more and more help."

InteriorDesign,3cfzgd,PostPostModernism,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"While I agree with the post about asking for free professional advice, I am not a professional and will answer your questions to help you get on your way to either figuring this out on your own or deciding that you need to hire a professional. You are toeing the line with this post, and I want you to understand that.  1) It depends on your taste. If you like a modern or minimalist style, it will be easy to style an all white kitchen along those lines. If you prefer a more traditional or contemporary style, you probably want to bring in some color either in the kitchen or in the rest of the space. Since it's open, you need to consider how this will work with the rest of your space. You should always have a backsplash. They are not just decorative, they are functional. It is annoying to clean food splatters from a bare wall and you will eventually damage the drywall behind the sink with water splashes. I actually really like the tiled walls you've got already, maybe try to work with those. Otherwise, backsplash tile should go up to the bottom of the cabinets. Which countertop you choose will depend on what you like more.   2) You can paint it or put a new veneer over it if you don't like the wood grain. It will be prohibitively expensive to totally get rid of any peninsula as that's where your sink is, but if you get new upper and lower cabinets in the rest of the kitchen, it's not going to be too bad to replace the current peninsula with a new lower cabinet of whatever you choose.   3) If you're dead set on putting laminate throughout the rest of the space, I'd recommend keeping the tile in the kitchen. Laminate, especially the cheaper stuff, is very sensitive to water spills and spills happen in the kitchen. If you're going higher end laminate, like vinyl plank, you can probably get away with it in the kitchen if you prefer a continued flooring look. I have vinyl plank in my kitchen and it is holding up nicely. Whether or not you have continuous flooring in your kitchen depends on what you think looks best and works best for you.   4) What colors do you like? Do you like bold and bright or neutral or what? Look around on houzz or something and see what appeals to you and go from there.   Decorating seems intimidating, but it's not that hard to do if you're not expecting professional results. If you just want a space that is appealing to you and is comfortable, you are perfectly capable of browsing through houzz and figuring out what you like and making it happen. If it's still too scary and/or you really want your place to look amazing and you desire that professional touch, then you need to hire and pay a professional designer/decorator. Don't go on here and expect someone to lay out and design your space for free--that takes a lot of time from someone who has skills that you don't have and people deserve to be paid for their work."

InteriorDesign,3cd81z,Jhnthn,17,Tue Jul 7 00:21:58 2015 UTC,Have you tried putting the head of the bed centered and against the wall with the window? Having the bed on one end of the room would keep from breaking up the space which ultimately makes the room seem smaller. You could then arrange the other furniture around it.
InteriorDesign,3cd81z,elextricfeel,3,Tue Jul 7 01:59:49 2015 UTC,I tried placing the bed against the wall with the window but with the room being so narrow I can only manage to fit either the dresser or the make up vanity against the opposite wall but not both. I'm just going to keep rearranging the furniture around until I come up with something more functional hopefully.
InteriorDesign,3cd81z,nessaneko,15,Tue Jul 7 06:18:01 2015 UTC,"How much of that makeup does she really need? A lot of it might need clearing out if it's expired or she doesn't use it - especially if it's been stored long-term on the windowsill in sunlight.  It might also make more sense to go for a dressing table like BRIMNES with more built-in storage, rather than a separate unit just for storing makeup? That one I've linked appears to be the same length as the MALM but with the storage unit built in, it would mean there's clearance around the corner of the bed the way you wanted - and she gets the wall mirror she'd like.   I know the MALM is all sleek and minimal, but if you want minimal furniture, you actually have to have minimal possessions, and that makeup collection is anything but. Work with your limitations, buy furniture that has more built-in storage rather than adding separate storage pieces as well.  Clothing-wise, I don't know how much clearance there is under the bed, but it might be helpful to get some vacuum seal bags and store out-of-season clothing under the bed? That would give more space in the drawers - she could maybe even store spare bedsheets that way?  I feel like perhaps a single chest of drawers that is larger/wider (like HEMNES 6-drawer or HEMNES 8-drawer would be more cohesive than two chests side-by-side. I know you've mentioned she wants at least 8 drawers, but I've found that e.g. my jeans, shorts and leggings only take up one drawer (especially if I put away my shorts into storage in winter) and I tend to store my workout clothes in my gym bag ready to go."
InteriorDesign,3cd81z,nessaneko,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:13:04 2015 UTC,"Wow that Brimnes table is actually really nice and I like how part of the top can open. I also totally agree with you about how much make up there is, but I guess you can say it's kind of her way of having her own collection also. If it makes her happy I won't complain because it'll soon be out of the way eventually if this all works out. I like the vacuum seal bag idea so then we can store our bed sheets under there or even in her closet, I believe there is for sure going to be room. Thanks for the help! :)"
InteriorDesign,3cd81z,RacingRotary,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:34:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah makeup is super fun to collect, where I live it's really expensive otherwise I'd definitely be in trouble.   You could also look at storing some of it that she doesn't use so much in the Brimnes and also having something like this clear divider unit set up on top."
InteriorDesign,3cd81z,haltingpoint,3,Tue Jul 7 08:04:18 2015 UTC,Thoughts about your proposed designs; the bed is dividing the room and would make the room appear smaller than it is. I believe it would be better to have the bed's headboard being the only part of the bed against a wall. If the desk was ever to have a computer on it I would suggest not having the monitor facing the window. I wish you the best of luck with making the space your own and functional but I don't have an answer I feel is a true fix.

InteriorDesign,3cd81z,robbiec311,3,Tue Jul 7 15:11:19 2015 UTC,I agree that the best option would have the bed under the window. Maybe buy a smaller bed (140 cm wide) but one that has storage solutions under it fxl the Mandal bed from IKEA. I would then place side tables on each side with the same type of lamp on top.  Take all shelves of the walls.  Paint the room white. Nice rug. Dresser should be where the headboard of the current setup is now.  And the bonus - the closet renovated with good lights to become the makeup room :)
InteriorDesign,3cd81z,mastaswipes,3,Tue Jul 7 11:13:49 2015 UTC,"It's a small room, but I see additional storage & organization space if you go vertical. Have you considered getting rid of both her existing storage units and replacing them with something more of a built in wardrobe?   This is pretty nice, but a simple version would be just as effective. Obviously you'll have to consider the dimensions, but I think she would gain a lot of usable space if she had a cabinet that went from floor to ceiling but only occupied a similar footprint of her existing storage."
InteriorDesign,3cd81z,clonecosima,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:07:22 2015 UTC,I've considered getting a PAX Wardrobe for her because we like how you can customize the wardrobe almost anyway you want to. And you can store lots more in them because you can put a shelf or two in at the top of them.
InteriorDesign,3cd81z,clonecosima,2,Tue Jul 7 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"I'd make a change to the vanity and get rid of the tall dresser. Go for something like this which is a pair of Alex with a flat top. Place that to the right of the bed, with a wall mirror. This will give her LOTS of space for her makeup. The floating shelf could be above the mirror to give space to display some pretties. Then I would use a lower dresser and place under the window. Something like the Nordli which would allow for lots of storage. Or alternately this Nordli which might be better for tossing in jeans. I'd then use one of the smallest Nordlis for the nightstand, providing drawer space for her bras and underwear and nightstand stuff.  This layout would mean you had two less big bulky bits of furniture to contend with, while allowing her to have similar storage.   I'd also place a shelf over the window, within the window box. She can put her framed photos and a few books up there. You need to find a place for her landing strip. Some place she can put her purse, bookbag, what not. I'd suggest that the hall space behind the door become a space for that. Two or three hooks and a basket for keys. This might work."
InteriorDesign,3cd81z,goodtobepharaoh,2,Tue Jul 7 16:25:05 2015 UTC,"Hey there. Kinda late to the game, but here's my advice. Do not buy the Malm make-up table. I bought one for my daughter, and the bottom continually falls out because she has so much make-up and hair junk in the drawer. I would also suggest that you look at the Malm three drawer dressers to use on either side of the bed as nightstands instead of getting an actual small nightstand. They are the same height as the headboard. Then she'll have six full size drawers and may not need any additional storage."

But the stairs, ceiling fans, white tract lights, and flesh-colored walls need help. The stairs would be bettered with a steel cable railing, I think, and the ceiling fans could easily be changed out for some larger metallic ones. The tract lights would simply be a little less obnoxious if they were black, and a sky blue, light gray, or seafoam green color (egg shell finish) on the walls would add more dimension."

InteriorDesign,3cbugr,barking-chicken,4,Mon Jul 6 20:41:05 2015 UTC,I agree the pine isn't great but I think more black would make it look cool.  A badass smithed black spiral staircase would be epic.   I would also head to r/woodworking for advice on stain etc.

InteriorDesign,3cbugr,TERMINALLY_TRILL,6,Tue Jul 7 01:08:08 2015 UTC,"Love this room but it needs a bit of updating. I like the idea of painting the spiral stairs black, leave the pine columns and beams, they are quite cool. Replace the railing, only, with thin metal railing matching the staircase metalwork (black as well). Real unadorned and simple. It'll look like it was made together purposefully. I don't hate the idea of glass but could be a bit too modern for the fireplace/s.  Def paint out the walls like a pale, pale blue or green. Upstairs and down. You have plenty of that light brown color with the remaining pine/couches/fireplace so you need a complementary tone. But I'm talking, find the pale blue you like and go half that intensity or less or you could end up with baby blue, eew. You may be able to get away with a medium-light gray. Gray looks good with that color of wood. Tres moderne!  The under loft ceiling painted satin or semi cream/white  as you suggested is a great idea and would help brighten the lower  room tremendously and you would get that painted bead-board sort of look. Tres classique! Then the track lights would disappear a bit. Maybe even get more modern, smaller white  fixtures instead. Cheap upgrade!   Ceiling fans aren't terrible. Fairly industrial and plain and they don't stand out too much on the white ceiling upstairs (as long as you don't sit in the overhead light  at night. Lamps are your BFFs.) But clean lined modern fans could work smashingly. Still, overhead lighting is only for task lighting!!!  Other than that, this room rocks. I could totally live in that space!"

Black stain+polyurethane wipe in satin finish over the grey to catch in the seams and corners.   Pewter or raw clear coated steel hardware swap.   I can't make out the style of the staircase. A single stage satin black would be nice, if the style compliments it.   A good painter could transform the space without needing a full scale demo.   Although, it depends greatly on the style of your vision."

If so, I might put in something that looks more like riveted aluminum and darken those brackets and braces as well as making all the trim black.

I can say that I make around 37k a year working for a big box home improvement store working as a kitchen designer. I'm working on getting out of a retail environment and getting into commercial interiors, I expect I'll probably start between 35-40k.   There are a lot of threads around here with more info about what the job options/ how designers charge because it is a quite frequently asked question.

Interior designers work with space planning and draft electrical, ceiling, plumbing, and egress plans. Interior designers are trained in building codes and can draft C.D's for residences and commercial spaces to pass city and state building code inspections.   Interior decorators work mostly with residential spaces where as interior decorators work mostly with Commercial, restaurant, hotel, hospital, airport, education, and business design. Some designers do residential but the vast majority of the industry is in commercial design."
InteriorDesign,3cb8os,maowsers93,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:32:39 2015 UTC,Designers charge between $75-$150/hour and some very good designers can charge more. Taking an interior design course in college isn't going to prepare you for what it takes to actually graduate with the degree. The program is very intense and takes around 5 years to complete.
InteriorDesign,3cb8os,maowsers93,0,Mon Jul 6 17:36:00 2015 UTC,It's a 3 year college course.. what else is there
InteriorDesign,3cb8os,elextricfeel,5,Mon Jul 6 20:22:33 2015 UTC,Credited Interior design programs are 5 year courses in total. The programs are longer than your average major. The course you're looking at is likely not certified by CIDA. I wouldn't waist my time and money in a program that isn't CIDA certified because once you graduate there is no guarantee that you'll be hired by a design firm or that you'll be able to take the NCIDQ which is the interior design licensing exam.   Not every interior design program is created equal. You need to become familiar with ASID and IIDA because they're the biggest interior design associations and they play a huge role in the industry. CIDA schools are certified by national interior design associations and are the programs employers look for for new hires.   The licensing requirements for interior design vary by state. Some states have a title act which means you need a license to call yourself an interior designer or registered interior designer. Other states have a practice act which require you to have an ID license to practice interior design. For both licenses you have to pass the NCIDQ and you need to go to a CIDA credited school to be able to sit for the exam but not before working under a licensed designer for two years to do so.   If you don't go to a credited school you might as well just keep your money and practice interior decorating which doesn't require any formal education.   Edit: Apparently you can go to 4 year programs too. My school is apparently unnecessarily hard.

InteriorDesign,3cb8os,elextricfeel,2,Tue Jul 7 02:08:44 2015 UTC,Then it is 3 years on top of the 2 year base of core credits. What school is it?
InteriorDesign,3cb8os,maowsers93,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:24:46 2015 UTC,It's a 4 year program including both base core credits and program required classes. Unless you don't decide your major until after you take 2 years of core classes. I attend the University of Georgia. I take core classes the first year and then a mixture of core and program classes for the remaining 3 years.
InteriorDesign,3cb8os,elextricfeel,2,Tue Jul 7 02:30:40 2015 UTC,Good deal. I just looked it up. Looks like a good school. I'm a senior in the ID program at Texas State and ours is a 5 year program. A lot of programs are. Good luck with the studios. They're pretty intense. And FYI the lighting classes have trigonometry in it. They spring it on you about half way through the class. At least ours did.
InteriorDesign,3cb8os,maowsers93,2,Tue Jul 7 02:38:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah its nice being able to fit it in 4 years, but definitely a lot of work. I love it though! And thanks for the heads up!"

Especially if it's 4 years of Interior Design stuff (I may have drunk-skimmed your earlier comments).  But idk. Maybe it kind of sucks and needed 5 years of time to pass CIDA's standards? Maybe your faculty wasn't as aggressive in putting a plan together? Maybe they wanted to ensure y'all had that extra year? Pretty much a range of either selfish and lazy or generous and considerate, with some bureaucratic jazz in-between."

InteriorDesign,3cb8os,DiamineRose,0,Tue Jul 7 13:42:05 2015 UTC,"But didn't u just say interior design needs a license? How can someone e get that without education...  The Canadian Decorators’ Association (CDECA) recognised Interior Decorating program is designed to open doors to wide range of fulfilling opportunities where graduates can work as:  Residential Decorators Commercial Decorators (which include corporate, retail, and hospitality) Window display and merchandising consultants for retail spaces and photo shoots Set decorators (for TV, movie, and theatre) Staging and colour consultants Exhibit designers Sales/product representatives, as well as many other opportunities Graduates can also broaden their expertise with one year certificates and become event planners/managers or Kitchen and Bath specialists.  If you think visually and creatively, and are imaginative; enjoy new challenges and solving problems; and love transforming spaces and putting your ideas into action, then perhaps this program is for you.  This is what it says about this 2 year course"
InteriorDesign,3cb8os,xoceanblue08,3,Tue Jul 7 22:09:04 2015 UTC,"Again, you keep confusing interior design with interior decorating. I said interior decorating doesn't need a license or an education. Interior design (which is totally different from interior decorating) does, but the licensing requirements vary from state to state. In your case sense you're in Canada the licensing will vary for you as well. I'm not sure what the licensing laws are up there.   You keep using interior decorating and interior design interchangeably. They're not the same thing. Re-read what I posted and notice that I'm saying there is a difference between the two.   If you want to go to a two year program to be an interior decorator and you live in an area where there are associations that recognize interior decorating that's great. However, your original question was    I'm looking into taking a interior design course in college and I'm curious as to what people normally charge for this kind of work and how do you get started in the work force?    That was what people were answering. Interior decorators get paid less than interior designers and since this sub is for interior design not interior decorating you might have a hard time finding that answer here.   So, to explain the difference between the two a little more I'll use some of the job's that your source mentioned. It says that interior decorators decorate window displays. Interior designers would take the empty shell where the department store is going to be and design the entire store and/or mall that it resides in. Another job it mentions for interior decorating is set design. Interior designers would take the empty shell that the theater was in and design the entire theater. That is why one is generally licensed and the other isn't."

InteriorDesign,3c8dqb,L3aBoB3a,2,Mon Jul 6 04:39:29 2015 UTC,"The problem with swapping them is that the bed isn't that interesting as the focus of the room, whereas the social space / tv area is likely to be used by friends / guests and that leaves the bed to be more out of the way and maybe a more private area."

Preferably having the headboard to the wall but if it is too tall than to the rails. Could place a little nighstand next to the chimney.  Get some nice bedding in light colour. Buy new low corner sofa fxl SÖDERHAMN from IKEA. Only by 1seat-corner-1seat so it doesn´t crowd the room. Place the rug under it with a small sofa table. Fasten the new TV on a arm on the rails in front of it. Throw out the current closet and get a large dresser which should be placed where the mirror is now next to stairs. Buy a bigger mirror to hang on the wall over it. Take the current desk and use for storage and place to the wall next to the dresser. This is your changing area now.  Get a lighter and smaller desk for the computer. Something with glass.    It is a small space and I feel the black colour on your furniture is too heavy.

InteriorDesign,3c7k68,superlekker,2,Sun Jul 5 19:19:14 2015 UTC,Check thrift stores first. And flea markets if you have them in your area. A coat of paint or stain and new hardware can work wonders for older furniture. And older stuff seems to be made with better quality than a lot of things stores are selling now. Try to get stuff that looks similar enough before having anything done to it if it goes in the same room as another piece. Do NOT buy used beds! Find a local owned furniture store for those. Usually they will be cheapest for good quality.

With what you've shown with the video, and from what I could tell, there are two floor finishes and it looks as if one used is quite red and the other a soft brown (maybe even blonde?)! If the bedroom is the more redish flooring, i would think that the colour of the furniture might clash together and be quite heavy. though, this could all be reduced by the use of a lighter room fit rug etc to help break up the two timbers. but what i would really consider especially in this space, is working with more lighter pieces (swaying more towards white) to really help make the rooms look and feel larger/brighter and have this continued throughout as a strong theme.  As soon as i saw this space i was feeling that you could pull off a great Scandinavian fit out or a strong Mid Century!  Would love to hear your opinion on what i have said, no hard feelings if I'm totally off the beat! oh and totally fit out photos!  good luck"
InteriorDesign,3c8cuu,ArrowRobber,2,Sun Jul 5 21:19:08 2015 UTC,"Here are my general thoughts: It'd be nice to know where the windows are, if any, to help decide the layout. Generally speaking, I think you should consider a peninsula or island, that way people working or in the kitchen don't have to turn their backs to the large dining area, I'm also curious what is on the left side, maybe a wall can come down to make the kitchen dining room engage the larger area. Sink- Sink in corner is okay, dishwasher, for plumbing reasons is almost always next to the sink, the picture doesn't label the appliances. Bear in mind corner sink bases probably more expensive, limited room to install sink plumbing, and if the sink is in front of the window, a view opportunity exists whereas looking at a wall is unappealing.  Oven- seems okay Dishwasher- I'd locate it next to sink, moving plumbing is expensive, and if it were routed there, it would be a good idea to have it within the wall cavity, but you might be able to route within cabinets, but again, that's a lot of cutting and work and expense. Fridge- I agree it won't look right on the end, if you were to not put all the appliances in the corners, on 45 degrees, you would have a lot more room for appliances and storage, those 45's are killing a lot of space."

(Original floorplan now with appliances & labels, very tight kitchen)  The 'redux' extends 29"" further out than the 'original' north most kitchen walls. There is no view where the sink is in the redux (back to all open space & away from the windows), the sink needs to swap spots with either the dishwasher or the oven to have a partial / full view of the open room.  The 45 angles are to try and reclaim that 30"" of counter space between the sink & oven. I've had trouble figuring out were to place the appliances on 90 degree angles around/under that U shaped counter without their respective doors opening into eachother.

InteriorDesign,3btazp,duffelbagbrooklyn,9,Wed Jul 1 23:42:55 2015 UTC,"The lower temp, warmer colors are a lot nicer for daily living.  The higher temps are a lot more blue, not very homey & feel more like fluorescents, good for project space where you want more contrast (but personally, I prefer to solve this by adding additional low temp fixtures).  Mixing the two in the same room will make the warm bulbs feel a bit dimmer and the cool bulbs a bit more harsh."
InteriorDesign,3btazp,didjeffects,5,Thu Jul 2 02:13:19 2015 UTC,"The purpose for different temp. colors is so that the light compliments the colors in the space. The lower the color the warmer or orange a light looks. Those work well with warmer colors schemes. Higher temps. are cooler and bluish which work better with cool color schemes i.e blue, green, purple.   The color temp. depends on the colors in the space. If you have a warm color scheme and use high temp lights then the colors will get distorted and vice versa.  In general people prefer warmer colors because they remind them of incandescent bulbs. Color temps between 3500 and 4000 are considered neutral or ""day light"" and can be used with most colors."
InteriorDesign,3btazp,maowsers93,4,Thu Jul 2 02:39:02 2015 UTC,"Daylight bulbs are actually 6500k.  They are great for people that are effected by Seasonal Effective Disorder, or people that live in basement suites. THey are bloody hard to find though."
InteriorDesign,3btazp,clearwind,2,Thu Jul 2 03:20:40 2015 UTC,"Daylight is actually about 8000k. It just has to travel through our atmosphere and then it's bouncing off of everything you see, and don't see. So our perception of the light isn't all that accurate."
InteriorDesign,3btazp,BARchitecture,2,Thu Jul 2 18:52:57 2015 UTC,"Sure, however at sea level its more like 6500k."
InteriorDesign,3btazp,clearwind,0,Thu Jul 2 19:38:05 2015 UTC,"You're talking about color rendering index, or CRI. An incandescent bulb has a CRI of '100'. You'll see on newer lighting fixtures, particularly LED, they will list a CRI. Typical range is 80-95."
InteriorDesign,3btazp,BARchitecture,3,Thu Jul 2 18:54:14 2015 UTC,No I'm not. Im talking about color temperature measurement. It's measured in degrees Kelvin and the color temperature measurement is listed on the packaging.  http://www.seesmartled.com/images/general/led-color-temperature.jpg  https://www.americanlightingassoc.com/Lighting-Fundamentals/Light-Sources-Light-Bulbs/New-U-S--Bulb-Packaging.aspx
InteriorDesign,3btazp,maowsers93,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:22:52 2015 UTC,"CRI is still a more important factor for color accuracy of the things in the room. It basically factors the 'distortion' you refer to. You're not totally wrong, you're just explaining it poorly."
InteriorDesign,3btazp,BARchitecture,3,Tue Jul 14 19:49:40 2015 UTC,"Usually you'd want cooler, whiter colors where women do their makeup (like the bathroom vanity, or anywhere else where color correctness is important). Otherwise, the warmer ones should be everywhere else."
InteriorDesign,3btazp,purebishop,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:30:52 2015 UTC,Totally. I also love cool white LED flashlights for the record.
InteriorDesign,3btazp,Corwell,2,Thu Jul 2 16:50:53 2015 UTC,nice post thanks
InteriorDesign,3btazp,jotka,2,Thu Jul 2 04:40:28 2015 UTC,"i mixed both temperatures, cold and warm in the living room. It didn't  look good, rather distracting."
InteriorDesign,3btazp,MaK_Ultra,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:35:56 2015 UTC,"I feel that neutral, 3500k is hard not to like by most folks.  That said, my parent's and a lot of older white folks I know prefer warm colors.  My ex, her family, and families of the same ethnic background in her neighborhood all seem to prefer neural or daylight 6500k.  I guess it's subjective but I wouldn't mix. Try neutral in one room and from there decide if you want to change lighting color in other rooms.  Edit: I noticed in my bedroom the ceiling fan uses neutral but the table lamps are warm but dim. I find this has good utility for watching a movie in bed vs getting dressed."
InteriorDesign,3btazp,mralistair,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:00:32 2015 UTC,"Generally best to keep consistent but you can use it as an effect with small changes,    As others have said the cooler bulbs tend to be more for work spaces and warmer for cosy. Cooler bulbs also tend to be a little more efficient."
InteriorDesign,3btazp,Liakada,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:18:44 2015 UTC,"I prefer 3000K for my home as it is a little whiter. Generally, I would keep it consistent within every room. However, different rooms might warrant different colors. The more daylight a room gets, the starker a cooler light source would look. So, where you have lots of daylight, I would go with warmer color temps and in rooms that don't have any daylight (basement) you can easily go up to 4000K."
InteriorDesign,3btazp,BARchitecture,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:00:47 2015 UTC,"This sums up what I've been thinking and also most of the feedback here. We have an old home and lots of wood furnishings and we like soft light from non-overhead sources. So 2700K is pleasing to me in the location where I just replaced an incandescent. When the incandescent Edison bulbs over my kitchen counter die, I'll go cooler there. I found some cool LED bulbs on amazon where you can see the filament.  Much thanks to everyone for the input."
InteriorDesign,3bt5h6,whitherward,3,Wed Jul 1 22:57:33 2015 UTC,"I've worked for a variety of FFE showrooms (fabric, wallpaper, carpets, hardware, etc.). The showrooms I've worked at always made a point to sent binder sets or catalogs to design schools, because those are our future clients. Occasionally we will do a product presentation, or more likely host a student of the showroom or design center. It's in the showroom's best interest to get the students excited about their materials, because they will remember you and one day want to specify your shit.   Just call up a few big showrooms in your closest major city, explain you're the new librarian at X school, your library hasn't been updated in years, and ask the showroom manager to donate a binder set or catalog. You could also perhaps organize a tour day of your closest design center (perhaps with the help of a professor?), where you take a group of students around to showrooms and ask each to give a 5-10 min presentation on what makes their products unique and special. Most will be happy to do it!"
InteriorDesign,3bt5h6,FuturePiePants,2,Wed Jul 1 23:51:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely this! My school used to get huge boxes of discontinued memo samples year round from showrooms, which was great for working on projects with. Get some fan decks from Benjamin Moore, they were always so gracious towards us as students.  Does you area have a big inteior design community?  Maybe you can schedule talks or field trips to showrooms for them to learn about new trends/products."
InteriorDesign,3br9oa,c8h10n4o2junkie,20,Wed Jul 1 14:43:20 2015 UTC,"Warm/earth tones. Lots of fabrics and soft things (rugs/carpets, pillows, blankets, couches, tapestries etc) resulting in low sound reverberation, incandescent or natural light giving the feeling of warmth, scale of a human being.  I think one of the most important, yet most subconscious is the reverberation of a room. A home depot is not cozy, while a closet filled with clothes is more so."
InteriorDesign,3br9oa,The_moderaper,4,Wed Jul 1 16:24:07 2015 UTC,I totally agree with you on the decor! You should feel like you're wrapped in a blanket with hot chocolate and a really good book!

InteriorDesign,3br9oa,brutalistprince,11,Thu Jul 2 04:00:54 2015 UTC,"Size of the room is also important. Not that it has to be a tiny room, but I don't think a room with cathedral ceilings or large open floor plan could really be cozy."
InteriorDesign,3br9oa,yerg99,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:07:59 2015 UTC,I always thought cozy was a euphemism realtor's use to describe small or cramped spaces.
