Edit: Cover letter   ""To Whom It May Concern:""  Tips:   You probably know this, but it's always better if you address the person you are applying to by name. I don't make a huge effort on this but if it's not listed on the job ad and I really want the job I'll do a quick search on their website.  Normally I format my cover letters into three paragraphs. This is just the format that I came up with.      One or two sentences of objective and intro. Rest of paragraph explains why I'm awesome. Paragraph of why you're awesome (ie. what you like about the job, why you like the company and why the job interests you) Paragraph of why we would be awesome together (ie. the experience/skills I have that perfectly fits in with the job).   For your cover letter I would focus on writing about only the info/skills that particularly pertains to the job ad and then elaborate on them (as you have done).  I'll often steal a couple words from the ad itself to make sure I get past the HR department. I've heard that some companies run your resume through a word filter for matches to the job ad.  At the bottom I always mention something about my availability and when I can start; interest in scheduling a time to get to know them better and learn more about the company; and repeat my contact info from my resume.   I try and keep my cover letter as short but badass as possible. Especially with the trades I think most employers don't want to screw around and just want someone reliable and efficient.  Maybe it would help you to apply in person at these jobs. My husband is in trades but he's new to Canada so I can't say for certain.  Your grammar and writing are easy to understand, so no problems there! Overall, it's not a bad cover letter and I think maybe you've just been unlucky so far.

Use endashes for ranges – hyphens are for hyphenated words only. As a software engineering student, consider using LaTeX. Right-align all of your description lists. 'Work' is about a vague a verb as 'do' – find something more specific. Listing your certs is a good idea, but listing your scores is probably unnecessary (especially since the higher-level cert doesn't have that high a grade). Try to pack your data points into very short pieces of prose to describe each position. ('Agile methodology: Scrum' sounds awkward when read.) I don't think you need to be as granular in categorizing the tools you've used. In mine, I have it split out into languages, software, and operating systems – you may be able to get away with just languages and software (since linux is ostensibly the only o/s you've used). I would nix the horizontal rules between sections and just make the whitespace between the sections more apparent. (The space taken up by the rule and its following glue seems more than enough.) Where you say 'involving payment integration (PayPal SDK), it's much simpler to just say 'using the PayPal SDK'. For the IEEExtreme business, calculate your percentile. It's more immediately meaningful. Properly capitalize 'github' as 'GitHub' – it's a trademark and should be treated with some level of consistency. (I think adding ™ would be far too much, though.)

You need to tailor the resume for the job you want.  It's not clear what job you want from the resume.  You don't want to say what job you want on the resume (that's what the CL is for) but it should be obvious the value you're expecting to provide. It looks like in an effort to list everything, the things you need to be seen get lost.  The whole top section is pretty impenetrable.  Split into clear sections: education, work experience, relevant course work, other leadership stuff, etc.  I can't even find your education section, which is really, really bad if you're fresh out of school.  The strongest bit of your resume is your work experience, but I don't think you really highlight your accomplishments.  The first rule of the real world is ""no one cares how you did it."" There is no partial credit, and nobody wants you to show your work.  With that in mind restructure your experience focusing on your results rather than your effort.  For example:   Manage projects from intake to program evaluation and follow-up   What kinds of projects? How many? What was the result of your ""managing"" them?   Develop and initiate action plans...   How was the world a better place as a result of these action plans?   Influence individuals and groups...   Who did you present recommendations to?

This is really the biggest reason I'm trying to get into internal work rather than consulting is that I absolutely hate the segmented work and being totally dependent on whether or not clients will respond to me or allow me access to their people to see what the impact of my work is.

You are basically saying you want to find a job to do the work your company wants you to do. The fact that you are applying for a job says all of that. Profile - Get rid of this section as well. How you describe your experience in the bullet points should cover all of this. Do you really have excellent leadership skills at a professional level? Do you even know what that is? What is increasingly responsible work experience?  Education - As a soon to be graduate this should be at the top of your resume. You also need to include your GPA. If you don't include the GPA people will assume it is really bad. Since you want straight for an MBA after your bachelors you should include the GPA for both. Professional Experience - You need to focus more on what you accomplished in these roles instead of just what your job responsibilities were. What impacts did you have, what new ideas did you come up with, etc. Try to use numbers and quantify your accomplishments as much as possible. People remember numbers. Expand on these sections to demonstrate all of the things you list in your profile. Computer skills - Cut this out. You can't graduate college without knowing these. ACTIVITIES, HONORS, & VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE Cut out all the high school stuff. This is a professional post-college resume. What you did in high school is obsolete unless it is truly amazing and relevant to the job you are applying for.   I hope this helps.

What did you tutor them in? While being a Graphic Design Intern, what was the impact of some of the things that you did? You ""assisted in brainstorming and executing marketing campaigns,"" but what really did you ""assist"" in? Did you do any planning? Did you brainstorm and take charge of a campaign?  ""Illustrated workbook for patients."" What type of workbook? What patients were these?   Overall I feel that you ideally want more specific information. You are looking for internships in Graphic Design and Computer Sciences. Emphasize those traits by putting emphasis on them. For example, what type of graphics did you design? You make a lot of reference to marketing and advertising, but were they web banners? Newspaper full page ads?   At the end of your resume, you've offered your reader your relevant skills. Consider referencing them in the body of your resume (e.g. Used Adobe Graphics Suite to design weekly website banner advertisements).   I would also reference ""GIMP"" (in full caps)."

I'm not sure what I'll be doing but as long as I don't fuck up somehow, I should have this job for the next 2 years. I saw a LPT about having a resume ready before you need one, so I just wanted to do the grunt work now and update with details when I have them and apply for winter internships in October. You're right though, I can go ahead and add that I'm a TA for Java now.  Unfortunately my internship wasn't as creative as the description made it sound. I copied their ""responsibilities of the intern include"" straight from their website. mostly it was ""we want something like this, can you just make it happen"" and I would stress out trying to figure out how to make their crazy ideas work. Even though it wasn't great work they absolutely loved me (let several other interns go because they kept trying to be creative with the assignments and they only wanted exactly what they described), so they are great recommendations. They text me all the time about all sorts of things! I will definitely try to make it more detailed, though. I blocked out the name because the clinic was family owned (high school job), but the name of the clinic reveals what type of patient.    You're right about everything, though, I definitely need more detail. You're amazing! And thanks for catching the GIMP part!"

CSCI started out as a minor but I was asked to be a TA after I completed it because of my grades and how easy to approach I am (good for beginning students). So... I've kind of kept up with it, but I've only taken 6 classes so far. I like it more and more as I do it!   Anyway, I'm looking for two things. A 6 week internship this winter (in between semesters) and a 3 month summer internship in between semesters. My BF and I are long distance and he lives in a metro area (I'm rural) so I will be looking in his town, and I don't really care which discipline as long as I have a reason to be in his town.  However, I'm hoping to find something like mobile or website development and can find an opportunity that combines both graphic design and CSCI! Doing both back and front end stuff, perhaps. So that's what I had in mind when I wrote this resume.  It's funny, because I'm used to hiding my name for privacy reasons... but I'm hoping to make and sell art on the side, so now I'm looking to get my name and WIP website out there. :P But all references to my location have been removed.

If you have one, I would try to make it more direct and orientated towards the business. The words, ""aspiring"" and ""looking to"" read sort of weakly.

This resume lacks all of those and I will go into detail as to why.  Everything in your resume uses serifed fonts (accents that make text easier to read in large blocks, but come at the expense of ""cleanliness""). These kinds of fonts usually belong in a book, not on a resume.  Sans serif fonts look much cleaner and professional.  There is no real relationship between the sizes of things and their importance. Use one header size for the top level titles, another size for subheaders, and one other font size for text.   Your font sizes are not standardized.   Your placement and alignments are inconsistent. There is no real structure for where things are placed.  The dual column style doesn't work because the resume is not "" balanced"" in information density on each side. It looks jilted.  I would personally choose to bold or italicize something over using underlines.  The use of space for the information header at the top is really bad. There's no reason for that to take up more than 1 or 2 rows.  You're using the wrong tense for your past experience. ""Operated"" instead of ""operating"" for the past, and ""operates"" for the present"

Try consolidating things  up there (decreasing the size of your contact info and moving it to the side of your name (like this). Might even be able to fit everything onto one page.  The bullets under core competencies are all whoppyjod. They're different line lengths - frankly, they look pretty terrible. (sorry. :/ ) Maybe organize them by line length?  Also, I feel like you could just incorporate your clearance/certification into the first line of your summary and eliminate those sections.

I would also save a few copies of your resume and tailor to the jobs that you're applying to. When reading your resume it was hard to get a good grasp on what you're trying to get into. Even if you're not sure about that yourself, when you apply for a position, make it look like you are ALL ABOUT that job. Simplify and remove some of the extra facts like hobbies and irrelevant jobs. You need to stand out at first glance, unfortunately an HR person isn't really going to take the time to study every detail.   EDIT: Just read your comment. Usually for design jobs you'd want a resume that pops a bit more visually. Also a portfolio? As for other fields, think hard about the job you're applying to and how the jobs you've held in the past have prepared you for the position. Write that in your cover letter.

I've seen hundreds of post-grad, post-masters resumes come across my desk, and they all seem to talk a lot of game, but not a lot of results.   1. Your resume points are really formulaic - they all read like ""Used statistical method x, y, and z"" to do ""business function x.""   They SHOULD read more like ""used data source x"" to do ""business function y"", optimizing for ""metric z"". And then include the results of your recommendation.   No one, other than maybe your hiring manager, cares that you used all these methods. They just want you to tell them what your recommendation is and that you drive business value. Unless the job posting SPECIFICALLY states in the requirements that you need familiarity with ""gravity modeling"" or ""Ripley's K Function"" - leave it out. Your audience is a non-technical recruiter, who has no idea what that is.  2. This resume point? ""Translated high-level technical content into conceptual formats for a diverse audience"" is patently false because the recruiter has just read all above, and understands none of it.   There are multiple instances of you doing this in your resume. ""Used t-tests and Bartlett’s test to eliminate significant portions of incomplete data"" - this just says you cleaned data.   ""Consulted three different advising offices using survey data, using hot deck imputation, raking, and multiple categorical tests in order to make recommendations on integrating social media into advising""  This sounds like you over-complicated a simple question - should academic advisors use social media. What I care about is what your recommendation was and what the results were. It sounds like they were interesting, considering you later say you presented this work.  3. Definitely play up your SQL knowledge in your resume.   Companies are running their databases on SQL. Whether it's a PostGres or MySQL database, you need to know it. You can't be a ""data scientist"" if you can't retrieve your own data. One thing that I look for in my candidates is their experience with navigating complex databases. I've worked at companies that range in the Fortune 500 to consulting for smaller companies and startups. Their database implementations were rarely straightforward. When I was early on in my career, around the analyst level, a stupid amount of my time was spent answering questions that didn't need any type of modeling or advanced statistical methods. Just advanced queries. It was getting at medians, averages, counts. And no one had ever known basic metrics around their customers because they had no idea how to extract the data they needed from the database. If you don't have this knowledge, get it. If you do, play it up in your resume points.   I hope I didn't sound too harsh. But I've seen too many students come out of their masters thinking like they can solve the world's problems using statistical method x, y, and z. But often times, it's a lot simpler than that. It's important to boil it down so that your non-technical audience can understand and buy into your recommendations."

We were understaffed and overworked, and I was miserable on the drive there and drained on the way home. I stopped working out and enjoying other aspects of my at home life. I wanted out.  After the new year, I started applying for positions elsewhere. Inevitably, the question of why I was leaving after 4-6 months came up. I've been under contract part time for the past 2+ years with another company, but yeah, it looked terrible on paper (at least to me).  My answer? ""The position doesn't allow for me to be as creative as I'd like"" or ""there's no room for growth"". Potential employers will see that as you looking for more responsibility or more to do - you're not content with just ""floating"" in your current skill set. Definitely include this place on your resume and highlight accomplishments there, and when people ask, be confident and assertive and, most importantly, positive!

They aren't relevant, at least not there. You've been out of high school a long time, and I assume scouts as well. It's time to drop that stuff.

I prefer bullet points, shorter statements. I have gotten feedback on this and most other agreee on this.  2) I'm not sure what that first line is. you shouldn't need to state you're a mechanical engineer. If you're applying to specialized positions that request a mechanical engineer, then they will expect you are one. If not, they will see your education. The first line seems like it is also an objective statement. These should be very precise and clear about what you trying to achieve, not who you are. Research objective statements and read examples for more help on this.   3) If you take out that first part and replace it with an objective statement, then you'll want to swap the experience and education sections. With entry level positions, it is normal to base a student on GPA. This clearly depends on what type of company you are applying for, but my GPA set me apart for my most recent job. Also, Purdue is something to flaunt, especially with that GPA.  4.) You're experience section is very cluttered, remake the format so its easier to read. like, the time frame is so close to the words I had a hard time finding it. Your experience section seems very rigorous, but you're not talking about it enough. sure you managed $12MM, but did you make something more efficient? did it end well? did you improve anything by a %, did you save money in any way? you want to express you were successful at the job, not just have the job.  5) Unless your sustainability education at the bottom is relevant to the new job you're applying for, take it out. It's not an official degree or license so it may just come off as filler material. You've had an intership, and a full time job. you should be able to expand on this experience explanation tremendously.  overall, you've got some work to do if you want to compete with the other MechEs out there. Also, if you got this template from the school, completely change it.

I have some suggestions for the cover letter:   ""As a highly motivated, results-driven"".....these and many other are keywords that employers and recruiters see ALL the time and are sick of them. ""Dear potential employer"" sounds extremely impersonal; as soon as I read it, I thought ""form letter,"" and if it were me reading it, I would instantly move on to the next one. If you can, write the hiring managers name. If not, ""Dear Sir or Madam"" is better...even though that also sounds impersonal....... Always write your cover letter for each employer. ""I am excited to apply for the ABC Position at XYZ Company."" Write down just enough so that it shows you have done a bit of research about the company and the position. Also write down something personal about yourself. Your current cover letter is entirely keywords and phrases that really mean nothing. All the things that you put down for ""Key Performance, Production Background, & Leadership Ability"" are things that absolutely anyone can put down on their resume/cover letter. They are buzz-words that sound good, but do they really describe you? Put something personal in. Instead of ""Self-directed...."", write something like ""As the lead in our project, I was able to....""   Stay away from the very impersonal, form-letter. For every new job position you're applying for, you need a new cover letter and resume. Tailor each for what you are applying for, even if it's pretty much the same thing. Your cover letter is to introduce yourself, to show yourself off, to let the recruiter know a bit about you. Start with something that might catch their interest. Anything that may set you off just a tiny bit from the crowd.  Congrats on graduating. It's hard getting all this stuff just perfect and applying for jobs. Good luck."

resumes,3d6ypq,drdeadringer,2,Tue Jul 14 00:40:35 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  Here are some of my suggestions for you:   I like your format. It's clean and simple to navigate, so, goo don that. Your obtained degree should be the ""big"" part of your education, not the university part.  Only put your ""obtained"" degree month year. Relevant coursework is not required unless directly relevant to the position - ie, they want someone with experience in .. cryptology .. and all you have is a course to say you've learned it. Make your state ""OR"", not ""Oregon"" - gotta be consistent! Especially if you want to be a data analyst. I see 3 internships and a freelance. Given that your Private Tutor work was freelance and makes your chronology more difficult to follow I recommend that you change ""Experience"" to ""Internships"", and then add a ""Freelance Experience"" after that. For skills / activities, change it to something like ""Technical Skills"" or ""Relevant Skills"", etc. Put your ""language"" last. It's great, but not as relevant unless applying directly to a japanese related position. A great skill though, and should definitely be on your resume. For programming, remove descriptors (like ""proficient in"") of your level. ""Currently learning"" is code language for ""probably doesn't know at all"" - so promise yourself  you will be basically knowledgeable in SQL, Swift, and PHP in time for your interview or leave it off.  I see no software in your skills section. That'd be a good thing to add - have you used Tableau? It's free for public use (publically available data) and you can learn it in about an hour. Visualization for data, a good extra piece of meat for your resume.  Things like Excel, Access, Crystal Reports, Sage will all be good things for resume. Google ""data analysis software"" and see if you can find any that you know or can trial. Push your skills to the top. Future activities -- first off,  you need to get rid of the word ""I"" - it has no place on a resume. However, I would also question what potential exam-taking dates are doing on your resume for actuarial and financial management. Remove them from this area - and, if at all, put them in your education section as if you already have them and say ""Expected May 2016"" - when you think you should have them by. Saying that you ""plan to sit in"" is passive and hopeful and not that convincing! Again with your positions, make your title the big part and the company the smaller part. For the dates - you can use June 2012 - June 2015 or Jun 2012 - Jun 2015 but you can't use June 2012 - Jun 2015. Consistency! The first thing I notice when I look at this is that your tutor experience detracts from your actual data analysis experience. Which is another reason to move it the bottom under freelance as previously mentioned. Being that you want to do analysis, I expect to see numbers, because right now looking at your resume I see that you weren't bothered to do analysis on yourself. You need to try the following:  RESULT via ACTION due to SKILL. So for example, I'll just pick one of your bullets and show you what I mean -- ""Alpha and beta tested software product on Apple devices."" could instead become ""Ensured a bug-free and user-friendly software by alpha and beta testing the product on Apple devices, discovering 60 bugs over a period of 2 weeks."" Generally it's better to lead with a number if you can, but you have to ensure your bullet is well weighted -- so ""Discovered 60 bugs over a period of 2 weeks, allowing for the Apple software product to be fixed before release ensuring better customer usability"" would also work. It depends what you want to highlight. You don't have a LinkedIn up there. I suggest adding one.   Let me know if you have questions.  Cheers!  rTJCw"

It shows you put some effort into making it look nice(and are competent enough to pull it off), and its not too different as to be distracting. The way the headings zigzag make it so you can pack in alot of information while still having clear distinctions in sections.  ""A spectrum of transferable communication"" is kind of a weird phrase, and sounds like your struggling to come up with another nice thing to say about yourself. Maybe try and rework that so it sounds more natural.  I've been told you don't really need to put ""References available on request"" on resumes anymore by some resume help people, it makes it seem old fashioned since thats just kind of a standard now.  You've got a ton of experience stuff, which is great, but honestly it kind of floods me. I got bored half way through that list and an  employer will too, since they're trained to only look at it for a minute. Your second resume adds even more stuff. Maybe instead merge the ""work experience"" and ""positions of responsibility"" into a general ""experience"" section, and add a ""accolades/achievements/titles"" section. In the former, pick 3-4 of the things on your resume that are most applicable to the job your trying to get, and write 2-3 bullets for each of those. In the latter, list all the rest of the stuff you have on your second resume, but in a smaller font and don't bother explaining it, just let the names ""scholar award"" and ""head boy"" do the talking.  That way the bottom stuff comes off as ""Wow, this kids got alot of achievements"" and not ""Wow, this is alot of shit I gotta read"". Meanwhile the top stuff, being the best few, comes off as really impressive and leaves him assuming you've got just as much impressive stuff to say about the other titles you didnt bother explaining. 1 page is always better than 2, it shows brevity.  Like I said, I'm a nobody, so if you think my advice is wrong, there's a good chance you're right. But as a layperson looking at it, this is what a normal person would maybe think of it."

It should be a colon).  Focus on writing clearly and concisely. If you notice that you have more than 1 ""and"" or your list has more than 3 commas, add a period in there to break it up.  For example, you could change your first sentence/section to:  (Specific Science) professional with international experience in HIV/AIDS research seeking a position with a well-established global public health organization (or just insert the company name here), (optional:) in order to utilize my (2-3 specific skills) skills to (insert noble goal here).

Change it to a short (3-4 sentence) summary of who you are, your main skills and what you have to offer. Try not to repeat what is in the rest of your resume. Don't bother listing all of the classes you've taken. Every student in chemeng takes pretty much the same course load. I'm assuming that by the third year of your degree you've worked on several academic or extracurricular projects. Create a new section called ""Project Experience"" and list each school project as if it were a job, i.e., with a bullet list of your accomplishments, achievements and contributions were to the project. Make the list of skills at the bottom more coherent. I would get rid of things like ""Attention to detail"" and make the list entirely your technical proficiencies. Like a list of all software, programming languages, hardware or software that you know how to use. You should do a google search for student engineering resumes.

For starters, I was modestly confused in the education section - because everything else has date ranges, but Rollins just has a month and a year. It's also unclear at which university you received the humanities award. I'd also definitely describe it in your own words rather than using a quotation - you can cut out a lot of unnecessary words/save space. I've never been a huge fan of the ""Relevant experience"" and ""additional experience"" division. The implication is that the ""additional experience is not relevant experience - which is certainly not true. If I were a hiring manager, I'd want to know that you managed 10 schedules and had the social chops to talk with 300+ people everyday - that's solid experience. I'd fiddle with the idea of shifting education to the bottom. I'm not sure your degree really sets you apart - but your experience might. I'm guessing most other applicants to a job you'd apply to would be college graduates in the liberal arts with an award or two, but they might not have the experience that you do.

That was an issue I was trying to sweep under the rug, but I guess my solution had the opposite effect. I'm embarrassed by the length of time it took me to complete my B.A., so I thought I could just offer the graduation date without calling attention to that issue.

You might be right. I'm just hesitant to do that because every sample resume from recent graduates (that I've seen) lists education at the top.

resumes,3cvgtw,londononion,2,Mon Jul 13 01:31:15 2015 UTC,"It depends on what kind of job you're applying for really. Personally, I think that if you're applying for something like an internship or a very early on starting position, stuff like that can be advantageous because they aren't expecting you to have a lot of previous experience in the industry and doing well in a non industry job can at least show your work ethic. Some companies are looking for that, and that's how I started off really. I spent a couple of years at a very entry level position expanding my skill set and I think that's a great way to start. You're not going to make a ton of money but the projects and learning are going to set you up for a great position a little bit down the road.  That being said, a lot of start ups and larger companies are looking for someone with experience, and in that case, I would say leave off as much non industry related stuff and expand on what you did for the sites that you have completed. Having too much stuff on your resume that isn't web development related may point to less experience in the industry.  In the end, employers are mostly going to go off of the skills that you list and demonstrate. I've been with companies that only look at my resume and barely paid attention to the sites I submitted as previous work. A lot of times, the hiring managers have never written a line of code in their life and only have a list of skills that the position needs. If you have those on your resume you'll get a call back.  Last thing I'll say, as a front end dev, I would recommend getting to know PHP. Most jobs that you'll have as a front end dev are going to involve PHP in some way (Wordpress, Magento, Joomla, etc). You don't need to be a PHP expert, but being able to navigate a template with PHP in it is going to be a huge advantage. Good luck with the job search!"
resumes,3cutdg,sox1ws,3,Fri Jul 10 23:20:03 2015 UTC,"I don't quite understand why you're posting your resume on a website dominated by 19-24 year olds when you have 30+ years experience. Unless someone with similar experience in your specific field passes by, you're probably not going to get useful feedback other than cutting the sentences down into shorter bullet points.   You also capitalize random words, like Landscape Design Company and Food Service Company. I mention this specifically because you might be getting to the point where you face age-based discrimination. My personal opinion, as someone younger than you, is that random capital letters are more common in older generations, and that odd capitalization is viewed extremely negatively for some inexplicable reason. (I'm sorry if that's offensive in any way, I'm not sure how else to say it.)  But, honestly, if you've been a vice-president and CFO, you really should be paying a professional talent manager to look over your resume and maybe even connect you to different companies. It's a different ballpark entirely."
resumes,3cutdg,dustira,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:00:45 2015 UTC,"Hi there!   Here are my suggestions.   /u/dustria is right about the capitalization.  I assume you took out your information so we couldn't stalk you, but it makes it a bit more difficult since you have no replacement text. Make sure you have a LinkedIn link up there, and no direct address. You've got ""corporate finance management executive"" and then you've got ""CFO VP Controller"" right below that. Go with one or the other. What are you targeting? CFO positions? Honestly I'd keep the top one. ""Experienced"" is a very cliche beginning to a summary paragraph. At your level of experience a summary is required because you will, by all means, have years of experience on this resume. Why not just jump right on in with the important stuff, and say something like ""Finance executive with a 30 year track record of $30 million in savings, and boosts to margins and profitability by 15%+."" Worded better, but still - cuts to the chase without the blah blahing of things that need more detail, really.  Your CMA should be in your education, and you should have it after your name if you don't (ie, Ronald McDonald, CMA) If you're working as a consultant now, say you're a consultant. I don't understand your first position's summary because it makes it sound like you're acting as a financial services consultant - but re-reading, maybe it means that the company you're working for is a consultant for other businesses? If you ARE going to keep these little job summaries - which I am not against - you need to add # of clients / partners, whether global, national, international, # of offices, or overall worth. Those details would be more interesting, to see what you were overseeing. Your bullets are great. I rarely, RARELY, say that to ANYONE, so well done. If you were somewhere from 86 - 07 I totally understand why you wouldn't have a month. However. When you have 10 - 14 and 14 - present, a month is required - which means, for consistency, you will want a month per date. With your tenure, you don't need a technical skills section but a financial skills might be useful to say what techniques and items you are familiar with. eg, I read something about eCommerce, and if that's familiar to you, it's something you may have over someone else and thus worth putting in a ""financial skills"" section.   Hope these suggestions help. Well done, and cheers.  rTJCw"

Quite frankly, the reason this resume has all these fancy arty things going on is because there is no content, so you have to fill the space with something. The top third is literally wasted space that could be 2 lines, the middle third says you have a degree, that hasn't got you a proper job in 3 years, the bottom third actually has something relevant, but not really, in 2 years you have had 4 projects, apparently none of which are worth showing.

Travelling the world is also perfectly reasonable, people who have travelled are more interesting than people of haven't, I have known people who have gone to interviews and then just talked about their ski season for 20 minutes because that is what the interviewer wanted to talk about.   Kind of destroys the whole years experience thing though, if you are travelling around the world or working some menial job you aren't using those skills, in fact if you aren't using them day in day out then it really isn't a years experience at all and you could easily end up just screwing yourself over if you get questioned on something which you say you have 2-3 years experience with when in reality it is barely 2-3 months of actual practical experience."

This is written a bit strangely, and it comes across as a first person bragfest. The resume can describe your accomplishments without coming across this way.  The resume you posted here is hardly 2 pages, so not sure where you are seeing 3 pages.  For starters, I'd put in the top section (which I'd call a summary) that you are seeking management positions. Otherwise that may not be clear.  Things that come across as bragging: ""highly respected"", ""My leadership, customer service, and management skills led to the creation of this team"", ""Other IT Teams in the organization purchased our services due to the efficiencies and processes I implemented."", ""due to my ability to work in a highly stressful environment"".   This is just you saying those things - let your references tell me that you are highly respected and able to work in stressful environments.   If you are applying for manager positions, I'd get the impression you were more about making yourself look good than making the team look good. That doesn't sound like leadership to me. Tone down the me me me stuff and stick to your accomplishments and responsibilities, and what impact they had on the business.   In this role, the end user experience was greatly improved when receiving software updates, OS patches, software installs, and new operating system deployments.   This isn't what you want to say. Say what you did (OS patches, updates, etc.), and you can say that users benefitted from that. The ""in this role"" lead isn't good. How about ""Managed team of n that performed software updates, OS patches, software installs, and new operating system deployments for x users""?  The description of the job from 03-08 reads like pure manager-speak. It doesn't say what you actually did. ""Improved customer service through improved business processes and staff coaching"". That says almost nothing.  I hope this helps. You have good experience and qualifications for the role you want, but the resume isn't good."

resumes,3cm3zs,darkbridge,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:47:08 2015 UTC,"The format is much clearer and easier to scan, but you have some grammar issues going on: random capitalizations and inconsistencies. For example, Master's in IT is not a thing. A resume is a formal document so you need to use the full formal name of your degree:  Master of Science in Information Technology. Also, ""Project Management"" is not a proper noun so don't capitalize it unless it's part of a title.  I would also only your title. What you did is more important than where you worked. I'd ditch the summary section and replace it with a skills section since you have a lot of technical skills to highlight.   Remember, a hiring manager is going to look at your resume for less than 30 seconds, so it needs to be scannable, easy to read and pull them in."
resumes,3cm3zs,crazycyclist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:44:37 2015 UTC,"Better. You can get this to one page. You need to ""buy"" about 25 lines to do so.  Name, address, email and phone all one one line (name can be larger than the other info - maybe name is 14 and other info is 8). And do you really think you need to write ""email"" next to your email address? We're smart enough to know that's an email address. That's 3 lines.  Get rid of all the lines above/below sections and all those spaces - you don't need them. That's probably another 8 lines or so, maybe closer to 15.  Education section can be reduced significantly. We need no detail on your degrees beyond School, City, Degree, Graduation date (we don't need start dates for any schooling). What you wrote about your BS is entirely unnecessary. What you wrote about the MS is as well (""developed a clear understanding""? Don't need that. You got the degree, that's all we need to say.). That's 7 lines.  Another trick to save space - look for bullet points that barely go past an extra line. Example is your first bullet under the current job - there is only one word on the 2nd line. We can ""buy"" a line by somehow cutting out a word or two from the description. Maybe we can change ""reducing our licensing costs year over year."" to ""reducing our annual licensing costs."" Just bought another line. In your description of Habitat - you call the section ""Volunteer"" (great) and start your description with ""Volunteered"". Do we need the word ""Volunteered"" there? Nope. You just bought yourself another line.  Getting better. It would be a stronger one page resume. Trim some fat."

I would also stay away from all the colors. The blue underlined headers look like links, and the purple look like links you just clicked on. Also, it's probably because you removed it on purpose, but you should have your name/address and stuff under your name.   Align all the headers. ""Work Experience"" is indented, while ""Certs"" and ""Objective"" is not.   Your objective should be a little more specific. Right now it doesn't really say anything except you want a job and a promotion. It can be at McDonald's going from a janitor to a fry cook. We don't know what it is you want.   Is this the entirety of your resume? Or do you have other things below Work Exp?   I would remove the first bullet. The second bullet pretty much highlights this, so it's unnecessary.   The third bullet should go more towards the bottom. It's good practice to order your points by most important/relevant to the least important because a lot of employers don't finish reading it, they just scan it.   The fourth bullet says the same thing as the first and second bullet.  The 5th, 7th, 8th and 10th bullet say the same thing. Try condensing them into one point.  Bullet 11 and 12 can be merged into other points.   In reality, you should only have like 5 or 6 bullets on here. The last bullet point should be higher up on the list because it's a very specific, unique duty. I would remove the part ""issue in a diverse networking environment"" because that's already obvious.

It's good practice to do this with any job that isn't the most recent relevant job for what you are applying for.   I wouldn't have 15 bullet points on your present position, but you can have 5 or 6 main points. I would remove all of the points that involve you using your ""soft skills"" since you have a lot of hard skills already and that's what they scan your resume for. Also, keep your tone consistent. I wouldn't start a bullet with ""Phlebotomy, injection..."" and another with ""Conducted monthly employee meetings"". One of them looks like a list of medical terms that isn't truly saying anything and the other is a sentence of what you did, which is correct.    It's confusing how you have WORK HISTORY then ACHIEVEMENTS but it's really just more work history.   It's also confusing that you have 'Leadership / Motivation / Teamwork' as a header because this doesn't really say anything. You can put ""Qualifications"", ""Skills"" or ""Summary"" or some variation of that as the header. And then either make a list of HARD skills, or a very short paragraph of your experience. Having 12 years experience is a good thing to have in there. If you decide on the list, separate them into categories. So all things medical together, all things technical together, administrative skills together, etc. You also have some things on there that sound like your personal opinion of yourself. Employers don't really care, so you should leave that out and talk about it on your interview.    I don't know if it's just because you copy pasted in Google docs, but the format definitely needs to change. You can find lots of free resume templates online to download or look at for reference. Right now everything is just one long left indented list. Make sure it's consistent, neat and easy to read. A lot of these places are going to use a bot to scan your resume, and if a person looks at it they are going to scan it too. If it looks too complicated to understand, or messy, they're going to dismiss it without even reading anything. If you're going to center, bold and capitalize headers, make sure ALL headers are centered, bold and capitalized. And with abbreviations you probably want to write the whole thing out and put the abbreviation in parenthesis, if at all.    There are lot of specific things to change. One of them being that Excel and PowerPoint are included in Microsoft Office, so you don't need to list them all separately. I can go on and pick at everything but I'll stop here and you can message me if you want additional help from me! :)"

resumes,3cgjzg,bachus2015,22,Tue Jul 7 19:10:02 2015 UTC,"Thought I'd crosspost this from my reply to this topic over on /r/askuk, in the hope that it helps other people.  This advice is UK specific.  Hi, employability advisor here; I have created loads of CVs for clients.  Your CV is bit too wordy! No recruiter is going to wade through paragraphs and paragraphs.. they're on a really strict time limit with maybe 100+ CV's in front of them   You  Need To  Have Bullet Points   I'd have something like:    Employer  Job Title  Date (Right justified)  Short, two sentence max blurb summarising what you did (one line max)  Bullet points of key skills and responsibilities   Have you ever been involved in projects during work that showcase your skills, trustworthyness, etc etc? You can add in a Projects section and detail these for some extravalue. You also don't have a Skills section; a recruiter isn't gonna wade through two pages to see if you match the table of attributes they have in front of them: add in a short section detailing your major skills. Use examples so it doesn't seem too generic but keep it really short and to the point.  How are you applying to jobs, anyway? It's pretty rare for job adverts to just accept CVs these days... most employers that have an online application process that require a Personal Statement. Your work history paragraphs on your current CV are perfect for those types of things; they usually want fairly lengthy paragraphs detailing your role (it's just not appropriate for a CV).   Probably the most important part of online job applications is the Personal Statement section. Here is your time to shine: its basically like the covering letter of old; your putting a bit of personality and context into the application. If you have a Job Description from the advert at hand (and most jobs tend to.. maybe not for low level stuff but, they should at least have a few paragraphs on the job advert page detailing what the job is about) then the Personal Statement area is where you bang through all the keyskills/job requirements/specifications, showing for each and every one how you meet this. If there isn't a full formal Job Description, then use the paragraphs mentioned previously to talk about how you fit each and every attribute they are describing.   USE EXAMPLES! This is the most important thing of all, really. Anyone can say they are, for instance, 'excellent with people with a high standard of customer service'. But what recruiters need is evidence of this, so explain why you're good at customer service, and what you've done in work/personal experience that shows this.  If your applying for a job that doesn't have an online application form, or is missing a Personal Statement section, then use a covering letter to detail all of the above.  Also, you should personalise each application/CV/covering letter to the specific job you are applying to. usually this only requires a few changes here and there, but a really good tip is to research the company online: they usually have an About Us or Corporate section, or maybe even a mention in the media. Slot this into your application! Is there mention of a Corporate Plan, or training/qualification opportunities for staff, or maybe they fund community charity events.. how many stores/locations/offices do they have, how many employers? When were they founded? Recruiters fucking love this: it shows you CARE and are INTERESTED in the company, that you've done the 15 minutes of effort to do some research. It'll really stand you out from other candidates.  But back to your CV; you said you're applying for mainly minimum wage type jobs in retail and bars: ironically you might seem overqualified for these types of roles, so I'd recommend pairing down your CV to the essential skills, qualities, and experience that match the job in question. Applying for a bar job? Add in examples on how you've dealt with conflict, how your fast and flexible to work, with good maths/money skills. Remember examples. Hell I'd say for these types of jobs you can probably do the entire CV on one page. (this advice also applies if you're doing an online application, keep it really to the point).  Other advice: don't include your birthdate, nationality on the CV. Obviously this is fine if the online application form asks for these. Is your email address professional? I've had clients with lovesboobs13@hotmail.co.uk as their 'professional' email address. If the online application form says not to include CVs, don't fucking include a CV.  Hope that helps!"
resumes,3cgjzg,NervousEnergy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"Wow, legendary reply there.  Are bullet points really something employers prefer on a CV? To me it just seems lazy but I also see your point that it is ""to the point"" and easier to read.   All of my jobs so far have been reactive type jobs, not really project or achievement based. I can't say something like I achieved 110% of my sales target for the year (which would look fine as a bullet point) when I worked in the police or in retail, it would be more like:   Responding to emergency 999 calls from members of the public Years of experience as a trained first aider Experience of communicating with members of the public in a wide variety of large scale events such as the 2012 Olympics   Would it be acceptable to write it in that way?"
resumes,3cgjzg,NervousEnergy,3,Tue Jul 7 19:44:46 2015 UTC,"Deja-vu..  The key thing really is time: a recruiter is looking through [x] CV's a minute, and simply doesn't have time to read through paragraphs. Its just not feasible, and as annoying as it sounds lengthy paragraphs do more to detract from your CV than add to it.   With someone with extensive employment history like you, I'm a fan of sectioning out your periods of employment into specific roles. Here's a link to a section from my work-in-progress CV (work-in-progress because I thought I'd have to get a new job but didn't in the end, so never actually finished it. It's a bit rough still, for instance the font choice is a bit shit.)  Hopefully you can see that it's short and snappy and really to the point. The time to expand on all that is the interview or the online application, not the CV. Again, for online applications, you can pretty much use all of your written paragraphs in it. My employment history sections for online applications are about 500 - 800 words each where I go into real detail.  There is an argument to make that online applications should be pretty wordy; not only because online is easier to digest that paper, but also because HR software searches for keywords to match against [Job specification], so the more keywords you put in the more matches you might have. However, low level jobs probably don't have this type of software.  Now, I work with clients who have learning difficulties or zero employment history or qualifications, so my usual advice isn't very relevant for someone with your background. However..  Projects could include your specific examples of policing the Jubilee and Olympics; you can go into a bit more depth here on the specific things you had to do for these events that set you apart from your colleagues, and how you dealt with exceptional circumstances.   I'm guessing you were trained in handling 999 calls and such; you might even want to add a Training section detailing the formal training you took part in in-work. That kind of stuff backups some of the statements you've made.  /u/papafrog has a GREAT point and has summarised it better than I have: bullet points should be an action and then an accomplishment."

Prevented crime or helped catch a suspect? Calmed down hysterical callers? You want the bullet point to read as an action and accomplishment--try to start it with an action verb like Prevented, Saved, Built, Coordinated, Led, etc"

Like /u/NervousEnergy said above, those recruiters are going to have a shitload of resumes to pound through, and if you cannot grab their interest in the first 10 seconds, you have lost the game.    My single best piece of advice: networking.  I just got my first full time job out of college a little less than a month ago, and it ended up being because I knew a guy who knew a guy.  It cannot guarentee that you will get a job, but it can help you get more than a minute or two of a recruiter's time.  Take anything that can improve your odds."
resumes,3ci350,TropicalVortex,2,Wed Jul 8 02:06:16 2015 UTC,"Here are a few suggestions:  Format:   I don't know anything about design, but this looks alright.  One major thing, though, is that you have A LOT of stuff going on right off the bat.  That first section is just way too busy.  I would suggest keeping information to a minimum.  Your name and contact info. UNLESS...does your website contain examples of your work?  If so, I would keep it on there.   Summary:   ""I work with a big focus in..."" sounds awful.  I think just ""Focus in..."" and then list the stuff is fine. Not a fan of the bold or font size either.   Work Experience:   Can you provide more than two bullet points from your latest job?  The rule of thumb I generally use is that your most recent job should have the most information.  Even if you were laid off, this was a job that you had been in for seven months.  Two sentences doesn't cut it. Just a personal preference here, but I prefer the look of dates when they are aligned on the right.  Looks OK how it is now, though.   Other:   I'm jumbling the last section together because that's exactly what it looks like:  things just sort of thrown together.  I think this section needs the most work. If possible, think about combining ""Skills"" with ""Tools.""  I don't know anything about web design, but you'll know which things should be prioritized over others. The periodic table thing you have going with the ""Tools"" looks out of place.  Nothing else on the resume looks anything like that.  Consider scrapping it. Ditch the language section.  It's just padding.   Hope this helps!  Sorry if some of it sounded harsh.  I'm tired and grouchy.  Let me know if you have any questions.  May not get back to you tonight, but I'll log on first thing tomorrow morning."

resumes,3ci8p5,Nynm,2,Thu Jul 9 05:01:34 2015 UTC,"In an organized list, yes. I don't think playing guitar or swimming is really relevant unless you wanna work for like an instrument store, or be a lifeguard or something.        I think a functional resume would be best for you. You can look for templates online, a lot of them are free to download, or you can just mimic them. Here are some MS Office ones.       For you, I would change ""work history"" to ""experience"" that way you can add any volunteer experience you may have along with your work exp. Don't forget that things you did as a 14 year old can sometimes count. On my first resume I added my babysitting experience because I used to take care of my cousins and the neighbors kid. They were in school and I helped them with homework, so I added that I ""tutored"" them. Little things like that count, you just have to word it the right way.    Start off with your objective/goal. Basically what you are striving to do for a job. It can be one basic to-the-point sentence or a couple (2-3) short sentences. Adding this is a personal preference for a lot of people, because it can be pretty obvious what you want to do, or hard to determine what it might be if you're just looking for a whatever job. But a lot of employers like to see that, especially for younger applicants.   Under your objective it's a good idea put have a ""skills"" or ""qualifications"" section. Here you can make a list of things you can do, like knowing how to use MS Word or Excel, using power tools, speak/read another language, what your WPM is, working a POS system, etc. You have to be specific and you want to make sure to organize the list and not just have it all over the place.   In the ""work history"" (experience) section, do put where you've worked, your role and the date you started and finished. Then put 3 or 4 bullet points defining some of your duties or accomplishments in that position. You can do the same thing for volunteer work if you have any.   You want an achievements section. This is where you can put your physics award and any other awards you may have. This is normally added at the bottom of the resume, under education, but you can do it like the template if you want. Make sure to put the date earned/accomplished.    For education, since you're currently in school, you'll want to do something like this:  Education        College Name / Address / expected graduation date Major(s) / Minor(s) / Program of study in pursuit   High School Name / Address / date graduated Diploma earned (with honors if any) / GPA  Eventually you won't want to add your high school education, but for now it's a good idea.   Everything in your resume should go in chronological order starting with the current or most most recent to the oldest thing. This is true for experience, achievements and education. Dates should only include month and year, and make sure to keep it consistent. So if you decide to format the date like this: July 2015 or 07/2015 or 07/15 Make all of the dates like that.   This is just the very basics for a resume. Formatting and word choice is REALLY important. Some places won't even consider you (or finish reading your resume) if they see even a comma out of place. I think first you need to know what to put on your resume before you can think of what words to use though, so focus on that after :P  Hope this helps! Let me know if you want me to help further.      Edit: Accidentally gave broken link."

Also, you still haven't told us what kind of positions you are going to apply for. Help Desk, Sys Admin, etc.. If you are going to attempt to apply to different kinds of positions, you are going to need more than one resume.  As far as your technical skills section:  Networking - This section is the strongest so far. However, you didn't mention the TCP/IP suite. If you are familiar with all of those other protocols, you are probably very familiar with TCP/IP. You should mention it. I'd also make Virtualization its own section and mention the specific technologies/skills you have experience with.  Security - As a security analyst, I find it confusing that you would list RAID configuration as a security skill. I would remove it. I would remove MAC address filtering. I would also remove ""Windows Firewall and Defender"" and put ""Host-based Firewalls"" and Antivirus/Anti-Malware solutions. No one in the world would be impressed by ""Windows Firewall and Defender"" appearing on a resume, so you should word it in a way to show that you understand the underlying principles of the product categories they fall under.  Operating Systems - This section's pretty good. If you are familiar with a particular distribution of Linux that you see a lot of places asking for (Like RedHat/CentOS) you should list it specifically. Also, some places like it when you list how many years you've been working with a particular OS.

resumes,3chqdj,ReedJessen,2,Wed Jul 8 00:20:05 2015 UTC,"Hi there:  I have some advice for you, I hope it will be helpful:   Your resume's first page is intimidating in a not-good way. You have a paragraph long summary, and your experiences' first look is a block of text. I also see poorly (my opinion) chosen data for the first page of a resume - a first impression - and so that in itself would be a negative. So .. suggestions: You've only been working for 4 years. You don't need a summary. Kill the entire thing -- and also never say ""I"" in a resume, and don't use cliches (""hidden gems"") - You also have an error, ""I thrives."" If you absolutely must have a summary, make it a one line tagline for your name. Sum up why you're rad and perfect for the position in one sentence -- change it per application. Your ""elevator pitch"", as they say. You don't need your full address, just your City, ST ZIP.  LinkedIn account? Add it to your contact info. Your header is taking up a lot of room that it doesn't need to. Also saying you're a data scientist is great and I get that, but it should be immediately apparent by your education & jobs anyway. So it's a waste of space, in my opinion. Change ""EXPERIENCE"" to ""Professional Experience"" If you must add your own company to the resume, add a ""Freelance Experience"" section and stick it under there - at the bottom of your resume. For your education, your degree should be the bolded top part, not the university.  Write it out - ""Master of Science (Predictive Analysis)"" - also, everyone knows the GPA is out of 4.0, so just put GPA: 3.8.  Put a specific month, not spring, so it's not up for debate when you graduated! Your thesis is very interesting but I'm not sure if maybe you'd want to put that under a publications type section, if relevant?  You need a month for your Bachelor of Arts, as well.  For your skills, they need to be more organized. Right now they are a mishmash of things all over the place and - shockingly to me - you also have NON skills in there. ""Detail oriented"" ""Creative problem solving"" ""team building"" - no. Those don't belong there. You're a data scientist, make them technical and make them specific.  I'm a layman (obviously) but for example, Data Modeling is great - and what's greater is if you can tell us specific types of things you've used to do modeling. SQL? MySQL? Tableau? Legal analytics are great, though obvious, and you may want to consider if this is useful when you are not applying to any more legal areas. I found ""Conversational Vietnamese"" at the very bottom! What the hell dude - ""Languages: Vietnamese (Intermediate)"" is great. Honestly in your director of analytics position, you can turn that paragraph into some solid bullets... but, for example, while ""Leveraged text analytics and semantic search algorithms to determine the quality of intellectual property assets, supporting fast-moving negotiations and due diligence for acquisitions of US and international patent portfolios."" is a great bullet, it's lacking merit due to it's lack of ""proof"". What do I mean by proof? Data. A number. What was improved? By how much? $? Time? Quality?  Ask this of every single bullet you have.  Just in case you aren't sure what I mean, here's another one with similar questions:  ""Led a team in the creation of intangible asset valuation and risk models for a new collateral enhancement reinsurance product developed in conjunction with a large Bermuda-based reinsurer and DC-based investment bank.  Models developed patent quality metrics to augment risk-weighted probabilistic default models."" -- How many were on the team? Did the quality metrics improve quality overall for the product? What were the benefits? Were there less claims due to better risk reporting? Is it important to state it's a Bermuda reinsurer? How would you word this accomplishment to someone who's never heard of insurance before? (for fun). What did you use to create this? How long did it take? How did you specifically make sure the best product was created? You are an incredibly smart person, I can tell that - on your resume, I recommend toning it down a bit. It comes off as fluff. And, as a data scientist, I want data from you - not vocabulary that makes me have to read it 3 times to realize you didn't actually give me anything. (Sorry. I know I'm being brutal - but it's because I care.) For me - and this may just be a personal preference but I see it working well for my clients overall - you ""earn"" your 2 page resume after you hit 10 years experience. If you are before that, you shouldn't have more than one. I would be concerned, if you are applying for Data Analytics positions, about your current role. It sounds very senior, and might scare people away thinking you'll want $300,000 per year and/or leave in 2 months. You may want to consider bringing it down to Data Analyst or something if that's more along the line of what you're wanting to move into.   That's my review for now. Let me know if you need more assistance. Especially if you have actual job postings you can aim me at.  Cheers!  rTJCw"

Unnecessary, especially when applying to retail. Your objective is to obtain currency through the exchange of services. We know. Including your education IS good and should go at the top, in fact, to demonstrate your purpose.

How many students were in these large groups? How many classes were there? What kind of activities? How many books? What kind of papers? How did you organize them? Did you make report cards for the students for the teacher to review? How did you approach poorly behaving students? Did you create any of the activities? What ages were the students? Did you tutor in the school or outside of the school? How many students? Did they improve? By how much?   For a general retail resume, it's pretty much good as is - but if you want a resume that you could get into office work with, for example, try the above.  Cheers!  rTJCw"

Right now, at first glance it looks like you have just over 1 year of work experience (top minus bottom), when in reality you have 6 years. Organize by start date rather than end date.  I like this a lot better overall, but you have some errors, notably mixing tense. For instance, instead of ""concepted, shoot, and edited,"" it needs to be... something else, because ""concepted"" isn't a word. I'm having trouble coming up with an alternative, though. And since both the first and third words are past tense, the middle should be too, so change that to ""shot."" Better yet, either ""filmed"" or ""photographed."" As an alternative to concepted, maybe ""wrote"" or ""directed?""  You use a lot of subjective adverby type things like ""fast paced,"" ""closely,"" ""precision,"" and ""quality."" This are red flags for me; they trigger a bullshit bingo response. Try to give something more concrete.  ""Organized and event planned."" I don't even know what that means. Planned birthday parties? Called a caterer for a 1000-person fundraiser with $200 per plate? More specifics. It doesn't matter if they're unimpressive, because it'll still be better than what you have now.

Quick pointers:   Layout needs work, the timeline is really hard to understand. I would stick with a bulleted section of previous positions, with facts and accomplishments in each one.  Professional experience always goes before education. The college logo is unnecessary, if you really want to keep it try to make it smaller. The timeline section is really hard to understand.  Employers do notice originality in resume layout and design but this one has too much and makes it really hard to read. Companies receive hundred of resumes each week, the key to success is to not make it too simple nor too complicated when reading it.  I would remove your picture or make it smaller.

STEM employers don't care about your retail work as much, unless you're getting hired for a receptionist or sales rep position where you need customer service background.

So this is why I am asking for advice: you say to use paragraphs, while a lot of what I have read was to use bullet points. Make it simple and easy for the person hiring to scan for relevant information. My intention isn't to argue with you, just looking for clarification because there seems to be various ways people like their resumes to look. I will apply your feedback either later tonight, when I get off work, or tomorrow.   As for employment, I didn't list every job that I have held. Just the most recent one, which happens to be the past 8 years. I only have a one month gap in my employment in the past 18 years and that was because I was moving to a new city in 2001. Anyway, after I graduated I wasn't having the best of luck finding a decent job. This was right before the economy blew up and so I took the first job that came my way in order to pay bills. The retail job was only supposed to be temporary, while I went back for an engineering degree. This was 2009 and I had many friends with engineering degrees and no luck with a job. I keep on taking a few courses a semester, until my current job wanted to promote me to management. Seeing my friends still struggling, I dropped out of engineering and put on those famous golden handcuffs.   Years later and bored with the daily routine. The economy is much better now and I am hoping to take advantage of it.  Edit: Almost forgot, the research I did wasn't IT related. Although, I don't know of any researcher that doesn't know how to trouble shoot their instruments, look at documentation on how these instruments work and apply that knowledge to adjust software and hardware. I will add those points when I update my resume later."
resumes,3cdo09,futianze,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:00:26 2015 UTC,"The bullet point thing is just my humble opinion and preferences; part of my current job is HR related and I've read through a lot of resumes. I find bullet points take away from the overall flow if there are too many. You could keep the bullet points if you like them, but I would still combine and condense! The way your updated resume looks is definitely not as bad as it could be -- at least with the template, everything is consistent.    And while that's true that bullet points do make it easier to read, I think that the more important thing you can do is keep your resume to one page (edit: and are also better suited for CVs rather than resumes).  You can't do that if you added any more jobs, like your research and college IT experience, so you would want to keep each job description a condensed paragraph. But, when I say paragraph, I don't mean using a lot of words and writing in fully formed sentences like I'm writing right now. For example, on your resume, I would probably do something like this:    Assistant Store Manager - Retail Store, 2007 - present Responsible for leading daily meetings with employees to communicate store operations and new sales opportunities, leading to a weekly average increase of 8%, exceeding store goal of 6%. Increased the average transaction by $1 via merchandising and suggestive selling. etc.  You have some potential for cutting down your number of points by merging them as well. I think you can combine bullet points #3 and #5; #1, #2, and #6; as well as #7 and #8. The sentiments are repeated with slightly different outcomes.    I really like that you pointed out the trouble shooting part. That is definitely fundamental to successful IT work so find a way to put it in your resume if you can, and definitely put it in your cover letter (if that's required) or application somehow."

A resume should highlight to an employer why you would be a good fit for their position based on prior experience, nothing more, nothing less.   Drop your objective statement.  Right now my first impression is that you do not believe you would be a valuable and dependable employee from the start.  ""To further expand my knowledge"" is also really vague and says what the job would do for you, not what you would do for the company. Drop your references statement.  Everyone is aware that candidates will provide references; it's a waste of space. Drop your high school education and the jobs you worked in college.  Being in college is an acceptable explanation of the use of that time, and few places are going to care about your experience in fast food. Cherry-pick the bullet points from each position to highlight what is relevant to the position.  Cut or dramatically shorten the rest. Grammar checks on bullet points.  In a few places you change tense.  And some of them just don't make sense. (Ex. ""Acquired through understanding of prototype...""  You never state what, exactly, you acquired.)  Reading each bullet aloud can be very helpful for catching these kinds of pesky errors, as can giving it to a competent friend to proof-read. Skills section.  Skills should be discrete, concrete abilities rather than vague statements wherever possible.  So instead of ""ability to operate complex test equipment"", list the types of equipment with which you are proficient.  Rather than ""adherence to safety rules"", list experience working in an OSHA environment or whatever is relevant."

Focus on what each individual job posting is looking for because it will most likely differ from job to job.  Also, working on the spacing will help cut it down a lot, too.  Finally. I think you should mention relevant skills in a separate section.  I didn't include that because I'm not super tech-savvy.  But you are, obviously.   Hope this helps!"
resumes,3cdbec,WinonaForever,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:58:53 2015 UTC,"Kill the ""systems eng it consultant"" title.  ""Summary of qualifications"" should be just ""summary"". What else would you be summarizing but the professional you?  I'm not sure how many points you're going to get by describing yourself as a ""generalist"". You may be exactly that [I have some of that myself], but I demonstrate that instead of labelling myself as that. Use a different word.  In your summary, ""And a passion for new technologies"" sounds like fluff; kill it, and save it for an interview. ""Apply to google what I don't know"" is the dangerous truth everyone knows; kill it now.  For your summary, try having 3-4 short, concise sentences. That 1st sentence there is a decent start given above suggestions. Try adding about 2 more sentences like that. Are you comfortable working across teams? ""My great first sentence. Adept with networking and virtualization. Comfortable with broken mug holders.""  For your employment history, you have too many bullets per position. You need to pick 3-5 [maximum] bullets per position. Chose your best most-awesome accomplishments, successes, achievements, and tasks."
resumes,3ce5ui,wigenite,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:20:31 2015 UTC,"All those competencies fall well under the umbrella of unverifiable nonsense.  Focus on the things you do that demonstrate those competencies.   Anyone can say ""I have ethics and values!"", well -- good for you.  ""I have managerial courage"", you don't say, brave little toaster!    Basically -- any one of those things on a resume reads like useless self-defined drivel, focus on what you did, not what you think of yourself."
resumes,3cegsz,ellipsis753,2,Tue Jul 7 07:29:49 2015 UTC,"Woo one I can actually contribute to!  First off, you need to format this. It looks disorganized, and frankly, not very good right now. Find a resume template on MS Word or whatever and build from there.  You should highlight your work experience more. Create a main idea, and bullet out different things you've done, different technologies you've used, etc. Also, your achievements section is actually pretty cool, and would be great if you presented it better. Give a short intro to each project/accomplishment, and bullet beneath it what that taught you/what the award means, and why it's important.   Also, be specific with your skills. Stuff like ""Good knowledge of OpenGL 3 with SDL"" doesn't mean very much. Instead, just list your skills here, and in your work exp/projects sections, highlight specific experiences/projects that have involved the above skills. Seriously, ""Good knowledge of OpenGL"" could mean a lot of different things. You clearly do know C++/OpenGL, so show it better.   Also, you should try to fluff up your accomplishments more. Look at sample tech resumes, and see the way they write, and try to emulate them."

resumes,3ccvtx,dark_sniper,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:45:37 2015 UTC,"You don't have much to work with here, but I think you could easily spruce it up a bit.  Here are some ideas:  Format:   Looking VERY sparse.  I think this is partially because there isn't much content, but also the spacing is not helping.  You should be able to add more content once you revise a little.  Worry about the spacing once you've done that. Plain, but not awful.  Not a huge fan of the lines separating the sections.  Again, just adding more to the empty feel of it.  I would suggest deciding between large spaces between sections or lines.  Not both.   Summary:   Not bad, but try to tie it into specific jobs you'll be applying for.  For example, ""An oganized...looking to apply my background/experience in (insert job field) toward (mention position you're applying for or field.)   Work Experience:   Do you have experience anywhere else?  Even if it isn't directly applicable, it's probably going to help your case to mention any job you've had.  Again, looking very empty.   Education:   Is the Precision Machining a certificate?  Training program?  Try to be a little more specific and if possible, mention what the coursework covered.  That will give employers a better idea of what you already know. Don't mention high school.   Do you have any kind of specialized on the job training?  Any additional certifications (you mentioned working with forklifts)?  Also, if the lack of education seems to be hurting you, I'd suggest looking into online options like Coursera or edX.  You can take classes for free in just about any subject you can imagine.  Hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything clarified."
resumes,3ccvtx,WinonaForever,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:22:02 2015 UTC,Thank you for looking at it.  I will be modifying it accordingly. I'll add more detail to my resume all around and fix the formatting. I'll also consider additional training.   Thank you for your time and opinion.

The number one thing is to NETWORK, NETWORK AND NETWORK. Go sub in as many schools and districts as possible, volunteer with youth groups and community activities, work for a daycare. The more people you know, the better. She is going to need recent relateable experience working with kids so that always helps with that part also. She should also look into getting skills like ESL, language skills, tech certifications, anything that is going to make her diversified and a real asset to the school."

resumes,3cct36,dangitscalvin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"The objective/summary/introduction section isn't really make or break, if you ask me.  If you don't have much direct experience in banking or you have a degree that's unrelated, it would probably help your chances.  What I've done in the past fair amount of success is briefly mention how my work experience will translate well to the job for which I am applying.  What prior experience do you have?  Did you go to school?  Also, send me a link to the position if you could.  I'll try to help you craft a good objective."
resumes,3cc1gd,LearnArmor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:09:44 2015 UTC,"Hey there, fellow Chicagoan!  I actually applied to UIC a few years back and got rejected.  I'm totally over it, though.  Not bitter all all...bastards.  Anyway, take a deep breath and relax.  You've got a pretty solid foundation here.  I'll take it section by section.  Here are some suggestions:  Format:   Overall, I like the way it's organized.  Maybe consider swapping the degree and school. Maybe consider a new font or anything, really, to make it stand out a little.  Right now it has a very generic feel.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Times New Roman, but it doesn't exactly scream excitement. Unless you can expand on your research, cut the resume down to one page.   Education:   I don't have a problem with ""Relevant Coursework,"" but I've seen some resumes where a person writes ""Competencies Developed"" or something similar.  If you go that route, try bullet points instead of a list.   Independent Research:   I'm not a science guy, so I'm not entirely sure how/where to list this, but it's good you did.  Maybe consider getting rid of your professors's names, though, and including those on a list of references instead. If you're still working in the first position listed, change the verbs to present tense.   Work Experience:   Consider listing this last.  You'll be applying for science jobs and I don't think it'll matter much to them that you worked at PetSmart. You used the term ""Displayed"" quite a bit throughout your resume.  Buy a thesaurus or something, dude!   Additional Experience:   Can you find a way to stick this in with the research stuff?  Or at the very least, move it up.  Tutoring for science courses is definitely more important than the jobs you listed.   Skills:   Maybe prioritize ""Laboratory"" over ""Computer."" This section kinda feels like filler/padding, but I don't think you should omit it entirely.  Play around with it a bit.   Any additional leadership experience?  Clubs?  Activities?  Volunteer work?  That's always good to list.  Hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything clarified.  I'll take a look at the cover letter in more detail if you can send me jobs you might be applying for.  For now, though, work on the resume."
resumes,3cc1gd,WinonaForever,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:35:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to lend some advice.  I think you're right that I should change how things are prioritized; for a lab position, I would think tutor experience beats out petsmart experience.  I also think you hit it on the head for how the skills section feels like padding.  When I've tweaked my resume over the past month I neglected to really comb over this section and as a result it does look pretty weak."
resumes,3cc1gd,WinonaForever,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:20:24 2015 UTC,"No problem.  The skills don't necessarily sound weak, though.  I think you should consider omitting that section entirely and finding ways to mention these skills in your research and/or work experience."
resumes,3ccssw,Lahs87,2,Mon Jul 6 22:22:46 2015 UTC,I would flip this around. Skills and education at the top. They then can read the blocks of text if you meet enough items on the checklist.
