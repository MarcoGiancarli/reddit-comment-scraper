I work for a freight company and have to move and load these often.  When I first started I was always thought they would slide out.  If the shipper put them together correctly, the banding on them will not allow them to slip.  Also you can see they are 4 high and 2 seperate stacks.  So they will not go any where.  But I am sure will give a decent scare to some drivers."

trypophobia,3dvy85,GiovanniTunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:12:33 2015 UTC,Looks like Central Oregon pumice.
trypophobia,3dvy85,goatsarejerks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:26:40 2015 UTC,Ok. Technically lava is a liquid material. What you have there might best be described as a hardened foamy obsidian or other silicate. Mined from the cinder cone area of volcanoes.
trypophobia,3dvy85,amgrulz,5,Mon Jul 20 01:37:54 2015 UTC,The word is pumice.
trypophobia,3dvy85,goatsarejerks,2,Mon Jul 20 01:49:18 2015 UTC,Thanks
trypophobia,3dvy85,goatsarejerks,2,Mon Jul 20 01:53:55 2015 UTC,Yes exactly! That's definitely what it was.
trypophobia,3dvy85,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,0,Mon Jul 20 02:27:03 2015 UTC,Lava
trypophobia,3dvy85,DreaMTime_Psychonaut,2,Mon Jul 20 00:19:17 2015 UTC,Definitely an artificially-made lava rock it seemed like... it was not dense/hard at all and could have been crushed with only a slight amount of effort
