wow,3e0080,sunshineparadox,39,Tue Jul 21 11:38:35 2015 UTC,"My cat Poppy had to be put down about two months ago after the vet found a ping-pong sized tumor in her chest that was obstructing her breathing and eating.  She was only about four years old, but she was the most friendly cat I've ever been around.  She always would sit in people's lap and never bite or scratch, even if it was there first time coming over.  Late in the night after it happened, I decided that I was going to farm for the Black Tabby (same model as yours) until I got it.  I killed ghouls for five minutes and it dropped.  It felt like the game knew what happened and was consoling me.  I named the cat Poppy, and upgraded it to rare (so it's untradable), but left it at level 1.  I don't use it very much (don't really want to get emotional every time I log in, and I know I would, personally), but I do think of Poppy every time I open my pet tab."

Sam was almost 18 years old, and Max was almost 17 (the names are actually a coincidence for anyone that's wondering.  I had both cats before I really got into playing computer games at all).  I had no idea they could sit in your lap in game now.  I'm gonna have to have a snuggle with my my kitties again :)"
wow,3e0080,Dewiew,3,Tue Jul 21 01:05:05 2015 UTC,"I feel you mate, my cat fatso died last week after 17years. I brought WoW the day it came out and he would sit in the corner of my room watching me.  I was on holidays set to return the day he died, I never got the chance to say bye to him so it hits me every night.  If he was hungry or wanted attention he use to sit on the keyboard or playfully swipe at my hand on the mouse.  I too named my WoW pet cat after him and as I go out adventuring I have little fatty running along too.  Your cat was lucky to have such a wonderful owner."

I still get upset everytime I think about my family's cat 'Hercules'. He went in for surgery on his teeth. He never woke up from the anesthesia. These sudden losses hurt so much.

I too am a cat owner and former wow raider, and had both of my cats cuddle up with me as I played on the computer.   I had two cats. they were sisters, unfortunately one passed away and the other one was left alone. They used to always cuddle with each other on the chair next to mine. I'll never forget my cats.   My other cat, the sister to the deceased now enjoys comfort with a new kitten I got to let her have as a companion. They both get along now after a few weeks of unease. I have a paw print of my other cat who is now resting in peace.  Again, thanks for sharing."

Anytime i walked around the neighbordhood, he would just roll along with me, never letting me out of eyesight.  I would spend the night at my friends house, and he would go to his window and jump in to hang out for a bit.  And EVERY single time I left, that cat would be at the end of the driveway waiting for me.  Best fucking animal I've ever had, a really awesome friend.

I feel your pain and wish for no one who loves their friend/baby/soulmate cat has to be parted with them. My Hector is 11 years old this year and my utter best friend and yeh he's my baby. I have a ginger and white cat from the old cat lady in Elwynn Forest that is named after my Hector - He is also a beast in battle and completely kicks ass, just like IRL.  Just let me tell you, he loved you and misses you too.   If there is a heaven, it's certain our animals are to be there.

I buried him where we used to play when we were kids...  The last dog i had was Trillion, a.k.a. tilly she was taken before her time. She was a weird dog with a lot of nasal problems but she was tough i found her beaten and covered in ticks i took her to the vet and i removed the ticks eventually she was doing pretty well but her curiosity took over and she got into a bottle of ibuprofen i had on my desk... it was horrible, she acted so out of it... she had a stroke at the vets and passed soon after...

wow,3dzcqz,Frangipane1,34,Mon Jul 20 20:44:34 2015 UTC,"Yes try it.  But to make your own characters, objects,... you have to use Maya or 3dsmax or blender. Those 3 are the most famous one. The creation of the 3d models happens with one of those programs.  Once you have all of your 3d models you can import it in unreal engine and assemble everything to make your very own map.  You can download unreal engine for free. It comes with some already made 3d models should be enough to make a lot of basic stuff. :)  Sorry for my English, French guy here."

wow,3dzcqz,WriterV,18,Mon Jul 20 21:10:17 2015 UTC,I'd recommend blender. Because it's free. And pretty damn good!
wow,3dzcqz,PerryTP,3,Mon Jul 20 21:44:53 2015 UTC,Quick question: is it better to do modeling on a tablet or is PC perfectly fine? I was reading about sculpting and such before and people said it's better on a tablet
wow,3dzcqz,jurassicpak,5,Mon Jul 20 22:18:11 2015 UTC,"Depends which 3D program you use. If you're manipulating polygons with a program like Maya, it's much easier using a standard computer mouse and keyboard. Other 3D programs often have 'sculpting' tools, which a tablet will be almost necessary for. But either way, if you're interesting in producing your own textures for models, you'll probably need a tablet anyway!"

I see YouTube videos explaining how to export from cinema 4d to Unity. So yes you can use cinema 4d. Unity is a program like unreal engine and works ""mostly"" the same.   Unreal engine is free since March 2015 so you will never find as much information than unity 3d. Unity 3d is free since it is launched (i think)."

There's not much room to march an army down the side of a hole.  Also, laying siege on any of the Forsaken lands is foolish. There isn't any strategic value to Silverpine, Tirisfal, the Plaguelands, or Alterac. To lay siege means to cut off supply lines and wait for surrender. But the undead don't need food, and the land is blighted almost beyon repair. Your troops would suffer."

Upon defeating her, she is spirited away by the Bronze Dragonflight to an alternate dimension where she becomes the Lich King. We must pursue her or else she will attain an infinite army of undead and lay siege to Azeroth.  Cue epic questline where Thrall comes and kills Sylvanas, finally ending her reign as the Banshee Queen. Victorious, we return to our universe, where Teldrassil has been overrun by the plague zombies. Tyrande, full of hatred, revives the Old God slain at the Master's Glaive in Darkshore.

So the question becomes would it be more valuable to leave the current version of WoW as is and make a WoW 2 or revamp the current edition of WoW with something like unreal engine 4 and bring the game back to its glory.

wow,3dzcqz,danielrhymer,2,Mon Jul 20 22:44:49 2015 UTC,We're not talking about just the client. Think of the netcode and the servers. Wow has been optimized for large scale deployment for over a decade. I doubt ue4 would do well with 100 people in a zone.
wow,3dzcqz,GGGregg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:33:41 2015 UTC,Not in two or three years. If someone started making an MMO in UE4 today by the time it was finished it'd easily be playable on new computers
wow,3dzcqz,Dislol,2,Tue Jul 21 01:01:35 2015 UTC,I haven't been playing WoW in it's current state (for various reasons)...but if it looked like this I probably would play it.  Kudos to you
wow,3dzcqz,Harkats,0,Mon Jul 20 21:59:07 2015 UTC,"Your standards for the game are so low that you could be swayed to come back based on the graphics?  Its shit like this that Blizzard sees and realizes they can get away with shitting all over the game and still cling to subs.  Who fucking cares what the game looks like?  Does it play well, is it balanced?  I could live with the original Diablo graphics if the game was balanced well enough and it actually had content."
wow,3dzcqz,Dislol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:21:33 2015 UTC,"Some people like to walk around in beautifull wall made zones, is that bad? Balancing  & graphics are 2 different teams. A game can look nice AND balanced ! (mind blown?)"
wow,3dzcqz,Harkats,0,Tue Jul 21 08:48:29 2015 UTC,"Except the game already looks nice?  WoW looks like WoW, you can't just go and toss out the graphics for a completely new engine.  If you don't like how the game looks, don't play it I guess, but you can't sit here and say it doesn't look good.  I'll concede there are a ton of tree canopy textures in Azeroth that need a rework since flying was introduced, but everything post Cata graphically is exactly what WoW should be, and as much as I don't like WoD, it looks great.  You're probably one of those people who didn't play Borderlands because it didn't look like every other game that came out at the same time (read: trying too hard to be realistic like CoD and BF)."

WoW is WoW because of those goofy, cartoony graphics.  I don't walk outside and see Orcs and Trolls roaming around my yard, and I don't expect or want to see them in Skyrimesque textures.  Basically, if I wanted to play FF14 or Skyrim, I'd play FF14 or Skyrim, not WoW."

I don't even know why you bring up 'outside in your yard' shit..."
wow,3dzcqz,Harkats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:56:20 2015 UTC,"Circling back to your original post, I'm questioning that your standards for resubbing to WoW are based purely on a graphics overhaul being absurd.  When the game is in an awful state of balance and lack of content, you're concerned with the damn graphics engine.  My entire point (which can be found in my first post) is that there are much, much bigger fish to fry in this game than trying to change something that doesn't need changing."
wow,3dzcqz,Robosprog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:59:25 2015 UTC,"Sure, and may it not be like that?  If I see this video, and WoW would be remade in that engine with those (or even better, as this was made by 1 person) grahpics, it would feel like a whole new experience.  And while it isn't, the feeling would be different, because it is, it has better atmosphere because of the lightning, the PhysX etc...  Lack of content sux but we only have this for the first time (sort of, unless you take the time between last raids & new expa launches).  Balancing was always a problem, every class or spec was useless at one point and always will be. After 10 years they still cannot do it so it never will be balanced. And the fact they don't separate the dmg between pve & pvp means they dont give a fuck either."

Two of my three dorm-mates played WoW, and the third one was a clueless cowboy guy at the school on a rodeo scholarship (Eastern Oregon schools really do have this). We were all sitting in the living area together, the three of us WoW players doing random BGs while the cowboy roommate was watching TV. One of the other roommates mentions he's bored of BGs and asks what we think we should do now. Cowboy roommate chimes in with ""Why don't y'all kill Jaeden?"" The rest of us get quiet and look over at him. ""You're always talking about killing Jaeden, so why don't you do that?"" We all just started laughing for a good five minutes. Cowboy roommate was really embarrassed because of it.  It became a running joke between us for the longest time. Whenever anyone would mention being bored, it didn't matter where, we'd say ""Why don't you go kill Jaeden?"""

wow,3dyf7x,ajrdesign,3,Mon Jul 20 22:30:49 2015 UTC,"I agree, WoD was announced about 2 months after SoO released. So the timing would be a bit early but in line with that. While Blizzcon would be too late, unless they release another content patch - or go straight to beta after announcement.  I think Gamescon is announcement with all the major bullet points, and then Blizzcon for all the details and beta start."
wow,3dyf7x,GadFly81,4,Mon Jul 20 23:03:26 2015 UTC,Yup. I think it makes sense especially with the movie release calendar. They'll want an expansion to drop at the same time the movie is out to take advantage of the hype and interest.

Still sucks so much was lost out here. But we'll just have to see moving forward. Think Blizz just genuinely fucked up with their assumptions on how long it'd take to train near 100 new employee's and it left them unable to properly dev the expansion to a high degree, and ever since it's been a scramble to try and bandage it up.

Instead of building upon the game they basically make a new game using the usual wow template.  It just feels like a treadmill.

First, announce the expansion with name and the logo and other basic shit like that at gamescom, not much info, just tell people to look forward to Blizzcon to get a lot more information.  Then, at Blizzcon, reveal the cinematic trailer with a release date for March/whenever it releases and give the players at Blizzcon the tools to play the alpha/beta right after all through the weekend and when the weekend is done open it to public.

If true, we could feasibly see a release in maybe 6 or 7 months, assuming they actually do announce something at GamesCon.  Fun fact: I used that spreadsheet to accurately predicted the release of Warlords to within a week.  It'll be interesting to see how it holds up with the new expansion."

wow,3dyf7x,Insi6nia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:30 2015 UTC,"If this really is a sign that Blizzard will be beta testing for the next expansion, then I'm actually kind sad about it.  It would be nice to move on to something new, but I was secretly holding out hope that we would get Farahlon, or Shattrath, or some of the stuff we were promised earlier on.  I loved BC, and being able to explore more of those areas in WoD would have been awesome.  Beginning beta testing for the next expansion would pretty much mean that we are never getting any of that stuff, and WoD will go down as the worst expansion to me, if not simply because of all of the missed opportunities."

I guess technically they are forms of content even if they are dull, unrewarding and you don't do them after the first time around but really from a multi billion dollar company with hundreds of staff I expect more or at least the same amount of content than we got in classic or any other expansion. How about some end game quests? How about some professions? How about some scenarios? How about some treasure hunting? 6.2 is what should have been in the game at release (Minus the raid)  I will give that there are some people who are somehow still enjoying WoD but ill assume they are all fresh off the boat from WoD and don't know better."

wow,3dyf7x,Argonized,2,Tue Jul 21 00:17:31 2015 UTC,"“At this point, we feel that outdoor gameplay in World of Warcraft is ultimately better without flying,” Hazzikostas said. “We’re not going to be reintroducing the ability to fly in Draenor and that’s kind of where we’re at going forward.”  At one point they made the decision that this is their final thoughts on WoD flying which led to a shitstorm by the community. The only reason they changed that decision was due to losing way too many subscriptions because of that.  Also considering so many streamers talking about classic wow lately, I wouldn't be surprised this being a possible thing in the future, not yet though - since people wan't content after WoD and not recycled stuff like timewalking dungeons."

wow,3dyf7x,jonleepettimore,-4,Tue Jul 21 13:44:19 2015 UTC,"Forward; total speculation based off of in game and industry trends in recent months.  Speculation; Timewalking has been well received by a community that has long called for servers that are locked to various eras of the game. Sony Online Entertainment/Day Break Gaming saw massive influx to their ""Time Locked Progression"" Servers.  These notes, combined with the recent player backlash over WoD, have prompted Blizzard to go back on their prior ""We're not doing expansion locked servers"" stance and we're going to see Timewalking Servers in the near future to fill the gap between this last tier raid and the next content drop."
wow,3dyf7x,Oxyfire,7,Mon Jul 20 17:46:45 2015 UTC,"I continue to sincerely doubt they will ever do ""Vanilla/BC/Wrath"" servers, due to such little (although loud) demand for them. I don't really see why backlash over WoD would prompt them to do something that offers even less new content."
wow,3dyf7x,jonleepettimore,2,Mon Jul 20 18:21:37 2015 UTC,"It can be done in much quicker order than developing entirely new content. Artificially limit features/content, bar access to new zones, while not having to completely step back on UI/current features in the game. Its plausible such a set up could be reached by Blizzcon. It will serve to fill the gap and keep players distracted. It could be argued that it would fill the gap until the Warcraft Movie is released. There has been a large spike in private WoW servers catering to this community. It has been proven to work in other games by other developers/private individuals. Blizzard is notorious for their habit of taking inspiration from outside sources, branding it to their own IP, and releasing it.   Again; this is merely speculation. But its just as plausible as cries for another expansion this soon."
wow,3dyf7x,Oxyfire,3,Mon Jul 20 18:28:58 2015 UTC,"Of course there's the chance it could be done quicker then making more new content, but I doubt it's going to keep people subbed in the same way new content would. Also, I imagine for a lot of people, it just wouldn't be accurate enough.  Like, even just changing the level cap from 100->80 would be it's own headache. Do you just dump the 80-100 abilities on players at 80? What about talents and glyphs? Let's say they figure out some way to make the scaling tech solve that headache in some way by changing the xp curve or something so that 1-100 can be done as if it's 1-80. Wrath raids probably aren't balanced with current class abilities balance in mind, so they'll have to be adjusted...  Like, from a code/design perspective, it seems like it has the potential to cause a ton of problems. From a rough understanding, it seems like they'd either have to have a ton of conditional checks, or basically make a totally separate ""version"" of the game.    It will serve to fill the gap and keep players distracted. It could be argued that it would fill the gap until the Warcraft Movie is released.   Again, I don't really agree it's the kind of thing a lot of players would want / would keep a lot of players busy. Maybe I'm totally wrong but it's certainly not something I care for and I know a lot of people would react poorly because they'd feel they're getting it in lieu of new content, regardless if that was the case or not. Also, why do they need to remain distracted until the movie is out? People need stuff to do till the next expansion is out.   There has been a large spike in private WoW servers catering to this community.   I don't think this is really a new thing though.    It has been proven to work in other games by other developers/private individuals.   Really? I heard FF14 has some scaling stuff, but isn't it just mostly a dungeons sort of thing? And mostly used so you can play with friends.   As a counterpoint: Wildstar basically tried to be vanilla WoW, in all it's hardcore glory, and failed hard, and while it failed for a lot of reasons, a big one was the fact that it was so hardcore. This might send alarm bells to Blizzard to avoid catering to a vanilla-esque audience. Also, has any other big MMO done expansion/feature limited servers?    Again; this is merely speculation.    Nothing wrong with speculation, it's not dumb to think they might evolve the timewalker tech further. I'm just particularly cynical they'll go so far as to make vanilla/bc/wrath servers due to their resistance to it in the past, combined with the fact it would be a fairly large undertaking with the chance that the pay off might be very small.    But its just as plausible as cries for another expansion this soon.   I mean, blizzard has been saying again and again that they want to roll out expansion faster. They said early on that WoD might be a shorter expansion, I think that's more plausable to be true then them doing the thing they said they don't want to do.  But who knows. This beta servers being up thing is actually very likely non-news because the creator of the tool pointed out the servers have been up pretty much since WoD beta closed."

wow,3dyf7x,Oxyfire,3,Mon Jul 20 19:13:15 2015 UTC,"Not familiar with '07Scape, but that doesn't exactly simplify the implementation. Blizzard apparently doesn't keep much older versions of WoW around or something because awhile back ""Eyes of the Beast"" was removed, and they were unable to re-implement it because the code was just gone or something.  Even if they did have the old versions handy, /u/jonleepettimore said the feature/servers would maintain all the current UI/features and QoL changes."
wow,3dyf7x,jonleepettimore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:22:56 2015 UTC,"Oxyfire's point about them not keeping old versions around appears to be an industry standard as well. Everquest's current TLP servers are all based off of modern code, not the older versions. It wouldn't be a simple matter of using old code, but having to edit modern code to resemble earlier experiences."

wow,3e0spy,floatablepie,4,Tue Jul 21 17:04:34 2015 UTC,"I think what's funny about threads like that is that they show that, in 14 years of Apple releasing new types of products that everyone ends up buying, people have always talked shit about the company whenever they announce something new. The pricing has always been a fair criticism, but in terms of innovation, so many people are so quick to judge the next new thing as ""stupid"", ""worthless"", ""boring"", etc. I wonder if it'll ever stop."
wow,3e0spy,yourpants,9,Tue Jul 21 05:27:29 2015 UTC,Why would it stop? They do make a lot of boring stuff that isn't very innovative - just because a lot of people buy it doesn't make it good.

It wasn't until '03 after Apple added the Store to iTunes and released smaller, cheaper iPods that they started selling and becoming the iconic little devices we all know and love.   All those reactions and comments regarding just the original iPod were pretty spot on. It was way ass expensive and it played MP3s just like that $100 Rio you've had for 2 years. Firewire and 5GB of storage wasn't enough to sway buyers to fork over $400 for an MP3 player. Except me, I bought one and still have it. I spin it's clickwheel every now and then for funsies."

It's no different from the table you were introduced to back in 6.0 in your Garrison), no 5 man group quests. Due to the lack of dailies, we don't get the seperated PvP and PvE dailies.

I personally really love how the raven looks. It's a very majestic feel and the fel-particles leave a very small trail when you fly. It's by far not as impressive as e.g. Ashes of Al'ar, but it's still pretty cool, plus I like the /mountspecial animation on it.

I'm not saying it's definitely going to happen but gamescom announcement and then beta start right after blizzcon aiming for a Q2 2016 release doesn't seem too far fetched.  //edit: also announcing at blizzcon and going right into beta a few weeks after that is kinda risky. At that point they will already have had quite a while of friends & family alpha and it's near impossible to prevent leaks at that stage (afaik people can play at home on their own machines during F&F alpha)

If they only announce at Blizzcon in November you can bet your ass that the beta servers will be running till March or something and the game itself will be released sometime around next summer. That's one hell of a big gap between now and next summer.   I know MoP had a giant gap, but at LEAST there was content to do. There were four big patches with plenty of stuff to do. WoD has exactly two content patches... the shit it launched with and the Tanaan stuff. 6.1. didn't even have any content of worth, except for that jukebox thing, which could take you an hour to assemble and find all the important scrolls etc."

And considering all the given details align closely with what was released at Blizzcon, your observation seems really dead-on.  If this came from someone in-the-know there could have been mention of the Legion, Gul'dan, etc.  its likely that someone working tech for the presentation had access to the presentation material during initial setup and snooped. Faralon - both it being Netherstorm and added in a later patch matched the presentation closely.   When 'leaks' are 4-5 months in advance, that's the one and only thing you need to look at to see that it's bullshit   I have been able to correctly guess a lot of release dates within a couple of months (my guess for WoD was between late August and early November - so I was off a tad there), but nailing the content has been nigh impossible.  Blizzard knows better than to douse the content of a given expansion with obvious hints to the next. And I imagine that Blizzard has a substantial need-to-know/nondisclosure system in place too.   Keeping that information compartmentalized is really good stuff and Blizzard does a pretty good job of it."

We then finally besieged their homeland from Talador while we killed off the chance of ogre reinforcements by striking at the Gordal Fortress, Broken Precipice, and Bladespire Fortress.  We also entered the dungeons to free their slaves, kill some chieftains, disable their railways, and take over their docks.  To top this off we went and raided the ogre capital and to put a cherry on the whole thing destroyed the entirety of the Iron Horde's war infrastructure by destroying the only other place where they apparently construct enough machinery to take over a continent.  So after having done all of this we happen to be so unlucky to finally knock on that door we've besieged only to find that the Legion beat us to it. All in all though I think that we took our thorough time."
wow,3e0spy,smalldick18,20,Tue Jul 21 04:36:22 2015 UTC,"All this is true, but the way most people see it is that the warlords other than Blackhand received very little focus and seemed mostly insignificant."

wow,3e0spy,Im_Wearing_A_Towel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:40:53 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, it was because the developers felt that the players had enough of orcs; since the main story of WOD was about the Iron Horde - orcs - they stopped story lines and re-wrote the entirety of Draenor to remove orcs in most zones, since it was going to be a planet wide storyline about the Iron Horde almost exclusively.

This buff is significant, but not nearly significant enough."

wow,3e0n2q,Skaflok,3,Tue Jul 21 13:21:15 2015 UTC,Combat log data recorded usually on warcraft logs.
wow,3e0n2q,insane_psycho,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:33:35 2015 UTC,"In incredibly simple terms: It's a recording of every single action of every single player and NPC during a bossfight. This is kept in the so-called ""combat log"". When you upload this to a website (warcraftlogs currently the most popular, worldoflogs and askmrrobot also have a service), it analyzes the data for you, and turns it into graphs, ranks you on your performance compared to others, and many many other things.  A parse, in the way it's currently most often used, refers to your ranking on a kill. So for example a rank 1 parse, is when you dps-whore real hard and do more DPS than any other player up to that point, on that specific boss, with your current specialization."
wow,3e0n2q,szemere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:44 2015 UTC,It's still closer though. At the moment the difference is huge but at least we know Blizzard does not have its head so far up its ass and Survival might get more buffs.

SimulationCraft updated their reports Here, Survival is beating a few specs, but it's still bottom of the pack, and nowhere near marks.  It gained ~5k dps or so.  Also, even if hypothetically survival did gain enough dps for it to be ahead of marks, it still wouldn't be used in HFC.  HFC is full of priority target nukes and burst phases, something that SV has nothing in their toolkit to handle, and something that marks absolutely excels at."

wow,3e0n2q,Nobri,3,Tue Jul 21 03:04:39 2015 UTC,I'm going to get to be the hipster lock who always says he was affliction back before it was viable.
wow,3e0n2q,pm_me_ur_trump,8,Tue Jul 21 04:28:56 2015 UTC,Affliction WAS viable.  On two fights: Council and Tyrant.  It is very strong on council and probably top 5 on tyrant.  This buff is totally centered around drain soul and haunt which means it's a big single target buff and won't change much for multi-target cleave dotting.    Which blows my mind because that's exactly what everyone has been asking for to make the spec viable on more fights.  Can't wait to try it out.
wow,3e0n2q,esw116,4,Tue Jul 21 06:45:26 2015 UTC,"Seed is probably the worst aoe in the game right now. Make it instant detonate or instant cast and it might be useful, but as it stands there's no reason to use it. You can do more DPS just single target burning unless it's a fight with tons of adds, in which case they'll likely be dead before seed erupts. And spending a shard on it seems pointless because most mobs in a situation where you're using seed won't live long enough/for corruption to do any significant damage. It just seems like they should address the functionality of it or get rid of it completely.  Though rain of fire and hellfire seem equally useless."
wow,3e0n2q,pm_me_ur_trump,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:29:28 2015 UTC,"I just rolled an affliction lock a few days ago and Seed is definitely the most disappointing spell I have. It sounded really cool at first, but I soon realized there are so few situations where it feels good to use. TBH the whole spec feels kind of clunky to me. Granted, I am only level 24 at the moment, so maybe things will get better."
wow,3e0n2q,nicemarmot_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"It's alright, seed was at one point broken aoe. It was so strong in wrath I saw warlocks hitting 100k on some huge trash pulls (and then immediately dying since they pulled so much threat)"

wow,3e0n2q,zangrabar,7,Tue Jul 21 17:21:13 2015 UTC,And more proof that Blizzard does not care about PvP. Affliction is godlike in PvP and absolutely melts classes. Now it'll be even more ridiculous.

Does nothing to appease their other issues either. Also pretty much means the end of Echo as a talent choice and is bringing back the playstyle of ""lining up cds"" which they didn't want back in MoP.

This is exactly marksman's niche.  They excel at single target burst damage.  So their toolkit gives them very good answers to almost every fight.  Whether it's nuking down the gorebound terrors on HFA or practically soloing the Living Shadows on Archimonde, they've got it covered.  Survival has no burst, no execute, and isn't far far ahead of marksman in damage, so it really has no valuable tools for the fights.  If it were to get absurd buffs like 100% damage to serpent sting or something, then you'd probably use it after progression for padding damage on a fight like Zakuun, but even there Marksman is very nice for burning through the disarm phase, so if you're progressing on it Marksman will be the best choice."

I mean, blizzard had stated many times that Ascendance, particularly for elemental, didn't feel epic enough, but they wouldn't actually buff it because of PvP, then they finally make a huge change to it which doesn't really change it but lets you use it a couple more times in a fight.

wow,3e0n2q,fetju,3,Tue Jul 21 13:22:38 2015 UTC,This is actually a pretty big buff because of something that you might be overlooking :P... the legendary ring has a 2 min cd. So every time we use the ring active we can use ascendance. Sure it might not be the coolest buff for us Ele's but I think that this is a bigger buff than it originally seems.  --  That being said I have done literally no math on this so I could potentially be completely wrong on how major the buff is.

wow,3dxywh,Protosega,-5,Tue Jul 21 02:40:55 2015 UTC,"That's a really long answer, Wrath had less content than this, with lower quality, people often cite running heroics for badges gave the game more content, but it didn't; that was artificial content  We have significantly more to do with LFR, Mythic Dungeons, Garrisons, and people are even enjoying cheesing Timewalking dungeon  The problem with the game in my opinion is the playerbase is getting older and don't want to spend time in a raiding guild. A lot of content in Wrath was because you WANTED to see Ulduar, you WANTED to kill the Lich King. So those stupid annoying jousting dailies in ToC didn't feel too bad, whereas people do LFR and Garrisons and log off now, you rarely see complaints from people in raiding guilds about the garrison or at least in my experiences, because they're actually doing things"

I'm not saying it would be good now that everyone is the ultimate warrior of justice who has saved the world about five times and can now solo gods by spamming one ability... But there was something satisfying being a low level, insignificant, and growing stronger as you adventure into the world. When you hit lvl 40 and finally got your mount, it was the best feeling. You weren't a godly warrior, but you had a fucking horse and that meant didn't have to walk around like all the low lvl plebs.

But they scrapped most of what they were doing inside Shattrath like they did for Karabor.   We had a harbor fight, then nothing.   No continuing story of us kicking the Legion and the Iron Horde out of the city.  If we had actual player housing in Shattrath, that would have been so much better than a lonely garrison in the middle of nowhere.   Better socially too, as I think even Blizz realized how isolating the garrison is."

I also think soo was a better raid then anything we have gotten in wod. The legendary quest in wod is just as annoying and garrisons are an absolute nightmare to catch up on for alts and with the catchup mechanic for the legendary being tied to the shipyard it makes it a real drag. As much as I wanted the content drought to end in mop I almost always had something to do. Also mythic raiding killing 10 man's murdered and spit on my guild.

wow,3dxxds,xhargenblargenx,8,Mon Jul 20 17:52:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it would take a lot of make up for the some of the horrible things that Warcraft has implemented. Especially for any competitive PvE player.  When WoD first launched they stated they were reducing the amount of difficulties and making LFR feel more optional, rather than a requirement. While I can agree, gear wise, they did make LFR feel optional to competitive raiding, they introduced Augment runes which were good money and required for competitive raiding.  They introduced flexible raiding, which was fantastic and introduced Mythic raiding for the hardest challenges. In the process, they made normal feel dull and repetitive because of the drastic increase in difficulty, but normal is a necessity for gear and since normal and heroic do not share a lockout, it may be up to a player to pug normals for gear because their guild doesn't run normals anymore. This also goes with Heroic-Mythic raiding. Raids do not feel special anymore, they feel like loot boxes. The most fun I had in WoD was during mythic raiding, but the progression and time to get to mythic is unrealistic. Normal Dungeons -> Heroic Dungeons -> Normal Raids -> Heroic Raids -> Mythic Raids + Challenge Mode Dungeons, baby sitting your garrison missions/work orders, gold farming for additional resources, and apexis dailies.  Never in the history of Warcraft has their been so much repetitive work involved to be competitive in raiding. Honestly, I feel like they should go back to raiding how it was in Ulduar, this is a perfect example of additional loot and difficulty, without repetitive farming. XT is a perfect example, if you have the gear/skill to burn the heart down quick enough, you get additional loot, challenge, and an achievement without having to run the raid twice.  They need to further condense the difficulty by adding layers of difficulty and not completely different modes of difficulty. WoW has become time > skill for the first 3/4 of end game and it's not fun. Running 1 dungeon for 1 hour and receiving better loot is much more engaging and feels more meaningful than the current 3 dungeons for 1 hour. Challenge modes are also artificial difficulty, by reducing your stats/item level you are not adding difficulty, you are simply increasing the time it takes to complete.  tl;dr Stop adding instances of difficulty and artificial difficulty into this game. Instead make layers of difficulty that are accessible by being the best and not by changing it to Mythic or Heroic."
wow,3dxxds,fredalbob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:04:39 2015 UTC,"i agree i think they did a good job with tanaan as a catch up mechanic it will only take about a month with one character to be maxed out in 695 gear that is ready for heroic. it is a mere 2 weeks if you are switching characters and using both at max output.  however the bigger timewaste is the garrison and the legendary ring. it will take you longer to get caught up with the ring quest and so much effort on one character it feels hopeless.  my main issue currently with mythic raiding is the set size vs heroic and normal having flex sizes. i like the fixed size of mythic but the transistion of going ""just grab the guys we can"" to ""we need X and X guys of those specs"" casuses so many issue for people and it is not a natural transision but people want the better gear and it just kills guilds and any commardary the game wishes to gain.  i really think blizzard should remove mythic ilvl gear in favor of cosmetics (mythic gear will have a diffrent colour and special effects) aswell as warforged is much more likly in mythic and call it a day. this would remove people feeling forced to go onto mythic raiding while still rewarding the top guilds for there dedication and doing the race we all love seeing who comes first. they could even balance things so they expect all members to be in full Heroic gear before entering it would make the progress of mythic slower as every boss is as hard as the last boss to kill.  an other benefit would be how small the gap of the casual to the hardcore raider would be just take this patch as an example casuals would be 695 and hardcore would be 720 ish (since of all the warforged they would have) a tier and a half is a nice gap but dosen't make mythic raiders immortal gods if you try to 1v1 them."

Something along the lines of Shat being the last thing we need to take over to stop the iron horde/fel horde and it turns out that they are attempting to open up the world to the Nether to bring back Gul'dan. In the process we stop them but the ritual goes awry and the portal to the nether stays open, leaking into draenor/azeroth and then our next expansion."

But your comment will never be that high up there because it suggests Blizzard made a reasoned decision rather than what is more popular to believe - that crazy shit was going on and they just scrapped a bunch of good content cuz they're lazy.
wow,3dxxds,AnthroGame,10,Mon Jul 20 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"Well honestly i don't think they scrapped it because of the Garrisons. If they had known that Garrisons would turn into a prison for most players they would probably have redesigned them and their recent comments on the topic also seem to suggest that. I'd guess they scrapped it because having two capitals AND two bases in Ashran would split up the playerbase too much. Only having bases in Ashran encourages that world PvP which people have been moaning about, so that's probably why they won out."
wow,3dxxds,Teroniz,2,Mon Jul 20 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly if they had mission tables in Stormshield, I'd much rather be there than in my garrison. There's the AH and other people hanging around. I would only be I my garrison twice a day to send out missions, or if my hearth was down."

wow,3dxxds,Zadoct,33,Mon Jul 20 14:05:45 2015 UTC,"I cant speak for the other stuff, but the movie was delayed because it was originally going to play around the same time as the new Star Wars, then got pushed again when the date was too close to Batman vs Superman."
wow,3dxxds,SerialChillr,17,Mon Jul 20 14:26:27 2015 UTC,On top of that a summer release is much better than a spring release. It says they have confidence in it's ability to compete with other summer blockbusters.
wow,3dxxds,TrustmeIknowaguy,5,Mon Jul 20 14:55:24 2015 UTC,"TBH I think it was garrisons. They put so much time and resources into garrisons and I think they completely underestimated the amount of work it required to get done. They had this vision that was just completely unrealistic for their time frame. This was only made worse by a few other problems blizz had at the same time: mists content didn't last because they released 5.2 and 5.4 too quickly, they under-estimated how long it would take for their new staff to get up to par, and they endeavored to do a stat squish and spell purge all while doing the garrisons at the same time.  Warspear and Stormshield themselves are examples of just how much work went into garrisons compared to other things. You can see the proto-type buildings for racial customization there, they just couldn't complete it in a time frame that let them implement it. They over-extended and it hurt them.  At the same time, they also wanted to streamline and remove some end-game things (i.e. scenarios became garrison campaigns) which contributed to the overall feel of the expansion."

So they were planning a short x-pac that would end in the fall, allowing the next one to be released alongside the movie.  Well, the movie got delayed, so now that plan leaves a big hole until Spring/Summer of next year."
wow,3dxxds,floatablepie,3,Mon Jul 20 17:34:53 2015 UTC,"Could be either way. But I feel WoD's premature end was an executive decision, not a developer one. Company politics before game developing/ promises to fans."
wow,3dxxds,Zadoct,2,Mon Jul 20 18:01:24 2015 UTC,"Tin foil hat theory, They have gone as far as they can with WoW idea wise and games that take less resources to make HOTS and Hearthstone for example most likely have bigger profit margins (Not saying they make more money but there is a bigger profit % compared to cost of development) so if they cranked out 6 hearthstone type games a year with the devs that are taken off wow they would make the same money with less development cost.   Of course that's mega tin foil hat and really I think they are just trying to milk as much money out of us as physically possible (To appease share holders? Does Blizzard have share holders?) by cutting more and more stuff meaning less development time and cost to them."
wow,3dxxds,MagicMert,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:05:49 2015 UTC,"Considering that they increased the wow team by 50% during Mists, I doubt the first part of the theory is right.   That being said, I do believe they will try to increase their profit margin with WoW somehow. There are multiple ways to do this : offer game time for gold - token costs more in irl currency than a sub month, so they're making more money -> players paying with gold who would otherwise cancel sub between patches stay in the game, feel more motivated to buy expansions if they dont have to spend money on sub -> shorter expansions, more often -> because sub time is available for gold, they seem reasonable to increase the exp cost -> to make it even more appealing they add a free service to each exp be it lvl boost, race change. faction change etc.   I think someone high up in Activision-Blizzard lost their patience with the concept for WoD and messed with the plan. I genuinely believe what they presented at Blizzcon was meant to be a great expansion and they put the foundations for it, but in the process plans changed dramatically. If you watch the most recent Hazzikostas interview, you can see traces of that regret in his statements."

They're most likely going to implement some form of the content that they promised us into future expansions, which is kind of bullshit. They're probably running out of ideas and trying to milk as much money as they can from this franchise by utilizing this business strategy, effectively conning us out of content. This is why I quit the game.  Edit: lol downvotes. Maybe I should remind you of the interview where they said expansions will happen more frequently.

They used most of their resources revamping old zones, so they could negate the purpose with looms/absurdly high XP rates. Vash'jr was cool but you got funneled through the quest lines and I found underwater combat to be unpleasant. As for the rest of the zones I just wasn't terribly interested. More quest funneling and jenky cutscenes. Dungeons were absurdly hard. I also thought the overall quality of the expac was awful. Everything felt unpolished and there was this weird mix of outdated stuff and half-complete new stuff mish mashed together.  I also found myself sitting in SW, no neutral faction hub, not even a new city. I hate the fact that they ""updated"" all my favorite zones by essentially wrecking them and putting in a bunch of stagnant battles and crap. Northshire has been dealing with the orcs for almost 6 years now. I would much prefer a perpetual bandit problem then having a zone mid-battle for 6 years."

But to shove us out on an island for no reason other than ""We need a Wintergrasp for this expansion, and... this is it"" just seems, I don't know, lazy."

It just seems like WoD was completely stripped bare for launch day. Why? God knows they had plenty of time to work on it, what with the complete lack of content after SoO. I just don't understand.   Maybe some day the truth will come out and there will be an explanation, but I'm just baffled."
wow,3dxxds,howtojump,2,Mon Jul 20 20:08:41 2015 UTC,"You always had some scrapped features. Most stuff comes from WoW Classic, where they have been playing around with ideas (housing) and zones (emerald dream, early version of hellfire peninsula) but that's just natural because Blizzard had to experiment a lot.  We lost some feature that had been promised to be in the game at release of the expansion. In Wotlk we lost the dance studio (those feelings when seeing 'Dance studio' in the first trailer...) or the Path of Titans in Cata. Also, we lost some content that was meant to appear in a patch. The entire Abyssal Maw in Cata as well as the Firelands in Cata that was supposed to be a lot bigger. Also, I'm sure that Dragon Soul was meant to be completely different...  But most of them got scrapped for a good reason (except dance studio!). Abyssal Maw probably didn't make it into the game because the underwater stuff in Cata wasn't liked that much. Path of Titans would be hard to be balanced. Emerald dream in WoW Classic was probably created when Blizzard didn't even think about releasing expansions one day.  There are always some features that won't make it into the game because of different reasons and that's fine. Making a game like this is hard after all  But I can't remember that it has ever been this much. An entire zone (or two zones? Shouldn't there be a small troll zone. Even three, if you count Tanaan), a capital city, multiple locations for your garison... that was most likely scrapped because of time."

Imagine creating a new druid and having to run all over Azeroth just to pick up bear form. I feel like the reason those quests were so popular was because they were new and exciting. Same goes for Vanilla WoW in general. Everyone loved it because there was this HUGE brand new world to explore.  Looking back, however, questing was poorly designed and extremely inefficient. and things just were so inconvenient. Get a low level quest that you had to run across 3 different zones and barely get any XP."
wow,3dztks,Fondoogler,6,Tue Jul 21 06:51:58 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly sure I would enjoy having to redo the level 10 Hunter quest whenever I started a new hunter, that you needed to do before you could have a pet. To me, it felt like there was more ""substance"" when the game made you work for a pet (getting to level 10 and doing the quest) and having to keep the pet happy by feeding it.  I really enjoyed how they worked it so that the hunter-pet relationship was a mutual partnership. You wanted a pet to fight for you so you would take care of it by feeding it, and the pet wanted food so it would fight for you.  Now that hunters start with a pet (that you can't control) and pets won't leave you if it becomes unhappy. That mutual partnership isn't there anymore which makes having a pet feel a lot less special."

I liked how ammo was upgradable. I DON'T miss running out of ammo in a raid and I'm glad to have an extra bag for stuff thats not ammo.

In wod all my chars have been within 100 rating of each other.   If you go back to wotlk you had priests who were more dps/shielding orientated healers, druids brought cyclone and hots, paladins were raw healing and shamans had utility in purge, tremor, bloodlust, grounding etc etc. Not even talking about offensive / defensive dispels being split among them."

Warriors have what, like, 6?   Someone walks into my room while i'm PvPing on my ret they'd probably think i was trying to do ""Through the Fire and Flames"" on expert with a keyboard. While i'm sitting there sweating bullets, trying to decipher the god damn Matrix, the warrior on the other end has his mouse in one hand and his dick in the other, swinging it around in sync with his bladestorm.

Prot warriors are basically a completely different class once they get their class trinket off Archimonde and their 4pc, because Blizzard decided to band-aid our serious deficiencies with gear... you know, that RNG bullshit that may never drop for you. Hooray."
wow,3dztks,frogandbanjo,4,Tue Jul 21 03:30:47 2015 UTC,Rating doesnt really prove classes are less distinct( which I agree they are). I mean I could argue that since wotlk you have improved as a player and that's why you find you play all classes equally as well.
wow,3dztks,Kalzert,6,Tue Jul 21 05:55:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The massive class homogenisation that Blizzard have undertaken may have made it easier to balance raiding and PVP, but it's come at a terrible cost. Gameplay is boring now; playing one class doesn't feel much different to another."
wow,3dztks,MiddleCase,6,Tue Jul 21 05:44:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, all feels way too much the same, and my even bigger peeve is that basically none of the classes FEEL different whether they have ilvl X gear or ilvl X+200 gear. The rotation is completely deliberately paced out, the procs are paced out, everything is designed to never be broken by stats and gear.  Remember in Vanilla/TBC/WotLK where your class might have a completely different playstyle from level cap to end of expansion gear?  Cata they started to reign it all in, and then you just played the exact same way from beginning to end, just hitting harder or a bit quicker."
wow,3dztks,Paddy_Tanninger,4,Tue Jul 21 04:08:16 2015 UTC,I've been saying this for years and always get down voted.  They need to bring talents back to how they worked in vanilla and BC where you could play a hybrid class.  It would make PvP more fun and PvE more interesting.
wow,3dztks,xluminosityx,2,Tue Jul 21 12:38:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, I just want good class design back. WoW had some of the most innovative classes at its release. Now, they're just incredibly stale."

Part of rolling a new class was to experience that class and its class quests and all that as you level. Now you just get all your things as you level via dungeons or 1/4 of each zone. It doesnt feel like I make a connection with any of my characters.

wow,3dztks,nicajco,147,Tue Jul 21 02:04:13 2015 UTC,A serious focus on lore with serious story progression. I'm tired of these out of nowhere expansion ideas.
wow,3dztks,throw777,39,Mon Jul 20 21:34:03 2015 UTC,Or serious story developments that are built up hugely and then simply don't go anywhere in the next expansion and become caught in sort of strange stasis. As though the only part of the universe that is progressing is the current xpac and everyone else is caught in limbo.
wow,3dztks,damcho,32,Mon Jul 20 23:46:31 2015 UTC,"yeah, what happened to Wrathion after seeing him in mop  for 24/7?"
wow,3dztks,nicajco,12,Tue Jul 21 00:05:08 2015 UTC,"He is mentioned at Admiral Taylor's Garrison for the Alliance questline, but that storyline was never resolved."
wow,3dztks,Final-Verdict,23,Tue Jul 21 00:08:34 2015 UTC,"He took a steaming dump on taylor, stole all of his men, and got him killed. End of story."
wow,3dztks,WanderingSpaceHopper,3,Tue Jul 21 01:06:50 2015 UTC,That was the Cult of the Damned's doing right?
wow,3dztks,Sarcastryx,3,Tue Jul 21 05:58:29 2015 UTC,He is mentioned for horde as well.
wow,3dztks,nicajco,2,Tue Jul 21 00:43:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I completely agree! I would really hate if Guldan just doesn't appear after escaping in this expansion. I feel like Blizz needs to do a better job of ending and beginning their story arcs in a timely fashion.
wow,3dztks,Ojomon_,3,Tue Jul 21 00:07:58 2015 UTC,"The potential for Warlords was there if it played out better. They could have had Grommash end up turning to Gul'dan on the brink of defeat and accepting the demon blood after all and we end up defeating a Legioned-out Grom on the way to Archimonde. We would have had the same sloppy demon lore screw up, but they could have gone with a theme of ""sometimes you can't change the past"" for the expansion and we could have put a bow on everything on Draenor with the exception of an escaping Gul'dan leading us into the next expansion. I don't know what happened internally to get us to where we are now, but there was a chance for this expansion to turn out well."
wow,3dztks,nicajco,3,Tue Jul 21 04:36:03 2015 UTC,"I really disagree with you there. Going to an alternate universe really stomped the potential for this expansion. Obviously they could of brought back characters, but that just makes this expansion an expensive retcon. As well, all the potential for an expansion is lost when you wrap it all up in a bow by the end of it. Some of it should cause influence over the next few expansions, but here we are with WoD giving us no real consequence. Aside from Gul'dan, who, in all honesty, is a force that was handled before and will be handled again."
wow,3dztks,Narrative_Causality,7,Tue Jul 21 05:05:51 2015 UTC,"A serious focus on lore with serious story progression.   Honestly I don't think they can. Their story ideas are kind of limited. I mean, look at the main idea behind expansions:   Vanilla: Picking up the pieces after the events of WC3. Burning Crusade: Oh no! We're being invaded by Outland! Let's invade it! Wrath: Oh no! We're being invaded by the Lich King! Let's take him out! Cataclysm: Oh no! We're being invaded by a huge mother****ing dragon! Let's go kill him! Pandaland: Oh no! We found a place that hasn't been invaded yet, let's invade it! Warlords: Oh no! We're being invaded by Outland! Again! Let's invade it! Again!   After having played FFXIV, this approach to expansions just seems so...rudimentary. FFXIV story spoilers for patch right before expansion:  FFIV SPOILERS In the final patch before the expansion you witness the murder of a monarch who was a close friend(you're the only one who actually sees her die), the death of a money-grubbing bastard who has been a thorn in your side for some time, one of the friendly main characters loses an arm, and you're the subject of a betrayal by allies you helped assemble just a few patches ago, which in turn gets your closest, oldest allies killed. You're branded a murderer because of the monarch's death(which you didn't take part in) and become a wanted fugitive. THAT is how it's explained why you go to the expansion lands; your allies are either dead or have betrayed you, and you go to the new lands to find new allies and clear your name. FFXIV SPOILERS END  At the end of the day, I just don't think WoW really exists to tell a story. It was the case in WC3, with character arcs and stuff, and you can see the same in some expansions(most notably Maraad/Yrel/Ga'nar from this expansion), but by and large WoW is very lax about telling a story, and when it does, there's no meat to it, you know? It just seems like world building more than a tight, cohesive story with a beginning/middle/end."
wow,3dztks,pouou,36,Tue Jul 21 00:09:43 2015 UTC,Talk about simplifying each of the expansions story lines.
wow,3dztks,wowww_,8,Tue Jul 21 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"It sounds like he doesn't have a very good grasp of the story, as a whole."
wow,3dztks,adam483t,8,Tue Jul 21 09:50:57 2015 UTC,You really love to skew your opinion with simplifications.
wow,3dztks,mrespman,5,Tue Jul 21 13:07:44 2015 UTC,So the storyline of Dishonored in MMO format. That actually sounds pretty cool. I might give FFXIV a look.
wow,3dztks,Narrative_Causality,3,Tue Jul 21 02:43:35 2015 UTC,"Make no mistake, it takes a LONG time for the story to get there, and it, IMO, doesn't even start to get good until the mid 40s (50 was the original cap)."
wow,3dztks,liggy4,3,Tue Jul 21 03:14:11 2015 UTC,"Well, at least they kinda tried with WoD, amusingly enough. The source of the content was 'out of nowhere' but the fact Garrosh was involved wasn't exactly a surprise, after MoP was wrapping up.  Really, I'd say it's the most connected the expansions have been so far. Probably isn't going to carry on to the next expansion though, unless Gul'Dan is involved somehow."
wow,3dztks,nicajco,5,Tue Jul 21 02:27:44 2015 UTC,"I think Cata -> MoP had the best transition. Cataclysm f*cked up the mists, the island is now vulnerable. It makes sense. Vanilla - TBC, TBC - Wrath, Wrath - Cata, all had horrible transitions so i'll commend Bliz on trying more in that regard. However MoP - WoD I feel was really still out of nowhere while being a transition. Like Garrosh could of been killed, kidnapped, protected, tried not guilty by the Celestials, and he just ends up escaping to go back in time and do something wild and crazy. Like it's not out of the realm of possibilities, but still it's like ""Why go with that direction?"""
wow,3dztks,Rizatriptan,49,Tue Jul 21 03:34:25 2015 UTC,No more cut-content bullshit. I want a finished expansion from what they originally planned. What was in store for WoD would have been beautiful...
wow,3dztks,Xipeify,13,Mon Jul 20 22:38:38 2015 UTC,Yes! Every time I see that big bubble over Shattrath or send my followers on a mission to liberate it I die a little inside.
wow,3dztks,talidrow,32,Tue Jul 21 03:15:16 2015 UTC,"For starters, a good story NOT focused on one or more orcs for a change. There are worlds worth of other cool, interesting things that AREN'T about orcs that we could go and see and do. Any one of them would be awesome. An Alliance spotlight that actually HAPPENS instead of being promised and never materializing would be nice, but I have no faith in it.  Some kind of a system to reward good behavior in players would be nice. FFXIV's 'commendation' system in random dungeons seem to work well - for those who haven't done it, at the end of a random dungeon, you are prompted to give a commendation to one player in the group, and someone you were already grouped with when you queued doesn't count. Commendations count toward achievements that give you neat things like titles, pets, mounts, and things of that nature. It leads to people being a LOT more friendly and helpful in random groups, and a LOT less trolling and bad behavior.  Reputations that DO NOT require endless tedious Asian-F2P-style mob grinding. FUCK. THAT. SHIT. Seriously, that pretty much at the outset of this expansion told me I wasn't gonna bother with these reps, maybe ever.  I don't much see any of those things actually happening, though, so meh."
wow,3dztks,CreamerLoL,11,Mon Jul 20 21:38:55 2015 UTC,"I really like that idea of commendations that sounds like such a cool idea that Blizzard could jump on! I also agree I think reps need a complete over haul, I would really like to see reps like we had in MoP but not so much dailies!"
wow,3dztks,Sarasun,15,Mon Jul 20 21:53:34 2015 UTC,I would like for my Enh shaman to be able to keep up with others dps without looking like I am playing a piano :/
wow,3dztks,CreamerLoL,2,Tue Jul 21 00:14:47 2015 UTC,"Amen. I quit early in the expansion due to being busy IRL.  Looked into the game with patch 6.2, saw enhancement doing absolutely horrible, none of the issues with the spec being touched and then literally the day after patch another +20% on SS/LL. Not worth my time if they keep ignoring enhancement community."
wow,3dztks,jalvstad,2,Tue Jul 21 03:02:25 2015 UTC,Agreed brother ^ _ ^
wow,3dztks,Arrlan,5,Tue Jul 21 03:13:56 2015 UTC,it just baffles me that there are specs like enhancement when arms warrior and arcane mage can literally be played on a snes controller
wow,3dztks,CreamerLoL,2,Tue Jul 21 05:14:40 2015 UTC,"With the 4 piece and the class trinket, I do like the current playstyle. But I agree on the keeping up with other dps.   I am top during AOE and middle of the pack for single target but I am about 6-8 item levels higher than the rest of the guild."
wow,3dztks,Arrlan,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:00 2015 UTC,I get so excited when I go into BRF and see my tanks pull everything. It's like Christmas for me ^ _ ^
wow,3dztks,herro9n,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:00 2015 UTC,FIRE NOVA ALL THE THINGS!
wow,3dztks,mitchmonster71,27,Tue Jul 21 15:17:06 2015 UTC,I'd like to see a more story driven progression at max level. While still playing a lot I just don't feel involved.   Another thing would be to use the scaling mechanism implemented for timewalking to go back and get reasonable rewards for content that you have already passed not only in instances but also in other zones. Imagine timewalking through a quest line in a vanilla zone receiving a proper reward at the end.  There are so many zones and great quest lines that we miss out on because we level past it too fast and would get to re-experience this way.
wow,3dztks,Andis1,19,Mon Jul 20 21:55:08 2015 UTC,I think that the Isle of Thunder hit the progression issue at level cap on the head. If we saw more zones like that with unique progression that would be awesome.
wow,3dztks,averagewhity,15,Mon Jul 20 21:58:03 2015 UTC,same with the 5.1 questlines. The story felt connected and interesting. I didn't get that from the garrison campaigns
wow,3dztks,Phizeal,6,Mon Jul 20 22:17:49 2015 UTC,"Well considering the majority of the garrison campaign is in a randomized order, it's no surprise that it doesn't feel connected.    Also, for the garrison campaign, you only get one quest a week, as opposed to the 5.1 faults you would get one of the storyline quests every other day, or sometimes multiple days in a row."
wow,3dztks,Xunae,6,Tue Jul 21 00:26:45 2015 UTC,"So we could go back and do all of those fun quests that we missed because leveling is super easy... All of that story and rep that we missed out on could finally be done and we'd be rewarded for it. If it was implemented correctly (mob levels are scaled up, rewards changed, reputation scaled up) this would be amazing!  SOMEBODY GET THIS MAN A JOB!"
wow,3dztks,wowww_,2,Tue Jul 21 02:44:06 2015 UTC,"I also want to see better story telling. I was listening to MoP soundtracks the other night. One in particular, called Serpent Riders, I could literally imagine credit roll goes on the screen with this music in the background. And then realized, the game doesn't really have this clear ending. Because last patch tends to last for so long, it fizzle, or linger around. I think it would had been nice to push the Garrosh's escape scenario before WoD, telling the story and give a bit of climax cinematic that shows our past journy at MoP (more general type of The Mists of Pandaria Tribute by Smash Gaming or Farewell Pandaria by Flamy507) remind us what we went through, and clues of next journey. Basically, typical TV or Anime show season ending."
wow,3dztks,BunzLee,36,Tue Jul 21 03:17:01 2015 UTC,"the price needs to be sub 50, maybe even 30, because i have absolutely not gotten my money's worth with this expansion"
wow,3dztks,Lasombria,3,Mon Jul 20 22:30:47 2015 UTC,"Even $25 would be a ripoff for WoD, compared to what we were promised."
wow,3dztks,TheFoxGoesMoo,2,Tue Jul 21 09:57:45 2015 UTC,"All we really got were Garrisons. And Blizz is like there... You wanted housing, you got it. It's a shitload of work, and now you better milk that cow to death."
wow,3dztks,beepborpimajorp,11,Tue Jul 21 12:26:17 2015 UTC,"For me, it's not really about features so much as it is about me regaining confidence in the designers. There's a lot of stuff that I took in stride as the inevitable mistakes that people working with the best of intentions can make. Demanding perfection would be dumb. But what really pushed me away this expansion is discovering how many things I thought were mistakes were actually deliberate choices - the interview comment about demonology being the perfect summation here. I'm okay with playing a game where the developers are trying honestly and intelligently to juggle a zillion factors to make a game as satisfying as possible to a whole bunch of players. I'm not okay playing one where at any moment, something I've been happy with can get shoved down and they make no effort to actually balance it with other elements.  As with a lot of long-term not-very-healthy relationships, once I crossed that threshold decisively with one factor - spec balance, in this case - then I started seeing it and crossing it a bunch of others. Three expansions in a row is too many to have gaps this long after the last raid patch; proper project management should have kicked in by now. It's not acceptable to keep pouring so much attention and effort into something that only a tiny fraction of players can ever play with, like mythic raiding, while totally abolishing other things that larger fractions would play with, like class quests. (This isn't to say that I want mythic raiding abolished; I only want it balanced more in terms of ""how many players will this matter to in play?"".) It's not acceptable to keep yanking around PVP players' characters for purely PVE concerns, nor to do it to PVE players' characters for the sake of PVP.   It just kept cascading, as I realized I was giving myself permission to be genuinely dissatisfied with things I'd tolerated as long as I felt confident that overall the developers were trying to make as many options as possible work out.  Part of what I've lost confidence in is the process of internal review. They keep being surprised by how players consume content, and there's no excuse for that at this point. They should have a long-term testing cadre of ruthless optimizers who will show them in-house what the cutting edge of ruthless optimizers will do once content's released. Furthermore, they need to fix whatever is wrong with their internal modeling of damage and performance. We keep getting this cycle:  Blizzard: here you go, PTR.  The public: our play and sims show X.  Blizzard: our internal numbers don't match that; fix your sims and let us get on with it.  The public: you'll be sorry.  Blizzard: here you go, public, new content.  The public: our logs show X.  Blizzard: how'd that happen, and why didn't anyone say anything?  That was okay early on when community and internals were both evolving. But it's long past time for Blizzard to take account of the reality that something is very consistently wrong with their internal modeling, and fix it.   And drastic overhauls of basic mechanics aren't actually fun for people who aren't really hardcore into it. Many calls for drastic change come from a small fraction of very dedicated, immersed, obsessed :) players, and should be ignored in favor of those who want more continuity and prefer not to constantly relearn how things work whenever devs get bored and go hacking. There should be a higher burden for systemic overhauls: not just ""is this different and new?"", but ""what problems in actual play does this fix, and how does it avoid creating new problems in response?"" ""Better"" should be the threshold, not ""newer"".  Finally, for crying out loud, Blizzard, go buy consulting time with people who designed levels and missions for City of Heroes if you really can't figure out how to make gameplay interesting with flight."
wow,3dztks,__Gojira__,38,Tue Jul 21 01:13:04 2015 UTC,"Reduce RNG.  Scrap Garrisions entirely.   Combine current raid system with old raid system. Have Normal and Heroic difficulties only, but have the hard mode settings like Ulduar for both difficulties. LFR can still exist, but make it a bit more challenging. I thought MoP did well with LFR difficulty.   No more legendary questlines. I hate these things. Both MoP and WoD it was just grinding LFR for drops. They are not fun at all and pretty much required for raiding.  Lots and lots of random silly content that offers no reward or incentive other than being fun to do. Brawler's guild is a great example of this. Completely optional and you don't really get much of anything from doing it.But it's fun to do and that's why people do it.   Have silly social events. One day, make a weird altar appear in some zone and when you stand near it, it turns you into an ogre and you start dancing. Or just something like that. Something that can get people out into the world together.   Also no more orcs stuff pls. I want to fight legion and naga and trolls and stuff.  On a more serious note, I want better plot progression. I want some major character deaths. Lets see Varian go and Anduin take his place. Or even gasp Thrall can die. Or let's have some focus on Sylvanas since she obviously has some stuff going on.  Also, promises about the next expansion that are kept."
wow,3dztks,TheFoxGoesMoo,21,Mon Jul 20 23:39:28 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree about getting rid of legendary questlines. They essentially become another form of attunement for raiding at a certain level.
wow,3dztks,__Gojira__,18,Tue Jul 21 00:41:29 2015 UTC,Thrall can die.   He'd just use Reincarnation three days later.

wow,3dztks,Andis1,4,Tue Jul 21 00:47:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think Metzen would ever let his big orc baby die, even temporarily."
wow,3dztks,Archensix,65,Tue Jul 21 00:56:42 2015 UTC,"This is the first expansion in which I have cancelled my sub. The next expansion would need one thing to get me to come back: fun.  Not the ""manufactured fun"" of Ashran that's not, or the ""hey guys, aren't daily quest grinds fun?"" of Tanaan and WoD reps, or the ""you guys are having too much fun so we're gonna nerf these cosmetic items"" fun of nearly every toy of worth in WoD, but actual fun. Free, spontaneous, natural fun. Give the content, and back the fuck off. Let the players decide how to play the game, not the developers. The nerfing or removal of things that the players like but the developers ""didn't intend to be used in that manner"" is horseshit (I'm looking at you, Have Group, Will Travel.)  I want my World of Warcraft to be fun again. And that's a sentence I never thought I'd have to write."
wow,3dztks,mrespman,10,Mon Jul 20 22:10:37 2015 UTC,"Off topic, but can I just add that Have Group, Will Travel would have been easily still useful but not overpowered if it  could only summon guild members."
wow,3dztks,Andis1,4,Tue Jul 21 00:21:11 2015 UTC,It wasn't OP because it could summon non guild mates. It was removed because it let you skip shit you aren't supposed to skip. People were literally having rogues stealth pass bosses in raids/dungeons and summoning the entire group to the one they wanted to kill past all the other stuff.
wow,3dztks,TheBroccoliPlot,29,Tue Jul 21 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"Then just have it not work in instances. Boom. Instead of removing it entirely, put some restrictions on it. But Blizzard has a long and cherished history of amputation instead of medication."
wow,3dztks,dONTlIKErATSlOL,2,Tue Jul 21 02:46:59 2015 UTC,Well then. I hadn't even thought about that.

wow,3dztks,Kii_and_lock,3,Tue Jul 21 03:01:13 2015 UTC,What? You could only use it near the entrance of instances. summoning people to skip bosses was never a thing
wow,3dztks,Bunchu,9,Tue Jul 21 02:25:54 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the number of quests in Tanaan are not a grind at all. The type of quest is was causes the grind. Killing mobs mindlessly until a bar is filled up isn't engaging or enjoyable. It's just a means to an end. I would have loved an area where I could pick up 5-10 interesting or rotating quests a day in between Highmaul and BRF. I keep going back to the 5.1 dailies. Every few days you would get a new piece of the story of whats going on in the zone that would feel like a bonus, and you would do that on top of the usual kill 10 of this, find 15 of that."
wow,3dztks,HOLDINtheACES,7,Tue Jul 21 04:31:40 2015 UTC,"This.  5.1's dailies were stellar (underground ruins aside, hated that place).  It fed you nice tidbits of story and the rotation kept it fresh.  They even acknowledged people liking it.  So why the fuck didn't they follow through?"
wow,3dztks,FundayMonday,2,Tue Jul 21 05:10:44 2015 UTC,"For real. I think if Blizzard sharpened their story telling guns and consistently gave us story content at that pace(GW2 Living World comes to mind), the game would bleed way less subscribers."

wow,3dztks,Threctory,4,Tue Jul 21 12:56:52 2015 UTC,"What instances of ""spontaneous fun"" were in other expansions that weren't in this one?"
wow,3dztks,FundayMonday,7,Tue Jul 21 02:28:04 2015 UTC,"Vanilla - Southshore and Tarren Mill. That wasn't a scripted BG, and they didn't need to promise players rewards. People went there for fun, instead of being cooped up in their garrisons.  BC - Kiting Kazzak from Hellfire to Shattrath. Kiting bosses in general, until Blizz decided that wasn't in their design and added the rubber band.  Wrath - Zombies opening event. Now they can't spare two people to script something similar for a new expansion.  Cata - Transmogrification, though Blizz still fumbled with that in that they put so many restrictions on it for what they said was to ""keep the flavor of the class"", while they've done everything in their power since to destroy any ""class flavor"".   MoP - I honestly can't think of anything for this one, except maybe AoE-loot. That might fall under the heading of ""excess enjoyment"" rather than ""spontaneous fun"", though."
wow,3dztks,poopfeastx420x,8,Tue Jul 21 04:18:49 2015 UTC,Adding leashes to world bosses was actually implemented in Vanilla due to people kiting Lord Kazzak from the Blasted Lands into Stormwind where he would wreak havoc on everyone until a GM could intervene.
wow,3dztks,Dragonmystic,2,Tue Jul 21 04:36:49 2015 UTC,"So I'll give you Vanilla otherwise your definition of ""spontaneous fun"" is quality-of-life improvements, an in-game event, and non-intended mechanics. Interesting at least."
wow,3dztks,Ollivander451,11,Tue Jul 21 04:25:34 2015 UTC,"Overhaul Professions. I've been playing WoW for 10 years and I think the worst thing Blizzard as done was gutting the fuck out of professions. Ever since they fucked professions everything just feel pointless and empty.  Logging into the game and clicking a daily cooldown is not fun.  To me it is the worst thing, because that is what a spent most of my time doing.   I used to make my own farming strategies. I would try to make the absolute maximum amount of gold per hour from farming."
wow,3dztks,Dragonmystic,60,Tue Jul 21 00:01:31 2015 UTC,"I actually have stopped playing. Here's my quarrels:  Major  1. Reduce the number of RNG mechanics.  I feel like WoW has become more of a slot machine than an actual video game anymore. Having a degree of RNG is fine--looting bosses, herbs, etc.  But it is seriously out of control.  Can I try to look at the Harrison Jones Quests? No, he's not up today, or yesterday, or tomorrow. Apexis dailies? Eh, whatever it throws at you.  Shipyards, garrison missions, it's all RNG.  By far the worst offender is Crafting Professions. You mean to tell me that the one thing I should have control over--the physical crafting of my weapon and armors, is completely random? And there's no way to fine tune anything after! Just pull the slot machine, hope you get the right stats now!  *2. ""Why are we doing this again?"" *  You may not notice it overtly, but Lore, story, atmosphere, they are all extremely important, and it feels like there's nothing in this expansion except ""Hey! Look! It's that guy, you know, from Warcraft (x)?""  It's really disheartening and disengaging. You just don't let me care about most things. There have been (very well done) exceptions, like the Arrakoa, some of the personal stories in Frostfire Ridge, and Yrel, but the rest of the Lore has been pretty much utter garbage.  3. Grinding. Grinding, Grinding.  Everything seems to be a grind. There's always a degree of this, but seriously, if you're relying on this mechanic alone to retain players, I'm out. (I'm looking at you, Abrogator Stones.)  Moderate  1. Professions need to be completely overhauled.  They're just not interesting, fun, or useful. They need to be completely redone.  2. More and better Customization. + fix clipping armor models  My character is very...very generic, and it makes me not care for him. Transmog items are good, yes, but they seem so underutilized, and done in the weirdest way possible. (Why on earth is it bind to equipment? just bind to the slot?)  But the severe lack of customization of my character really hurts things. It would be nice, as well, if I had a space that wasn't my garrison. Things that are useless are fun too! It doesn't have to be super-tied to the expansion.  Minor  1. New Races/Classes  I would like to play new races/classes. It would be fun. Naga in particular."
wow,3dztks,Ojomon_,18,Mon Jul 20 22:19:44 2015 UTC,"how bout making professions specialized again - remember when goblin/gnomish engineers had different schematics they could learn? Those choices have been removed and now with the way Garrisons work, you kinda don't even need to find players of other professions for items... you can just grind your way to it in your garrison."

I had professions leveled up on all my alts so I could transmute extra gems and all that stuff. It gave me one extra reason to log in every day that didn't feel like a chore. Sure I can log in every day and get all my herbs and ore but everyone can do that and as a result nobody wants to buy them. All I can do now is make item upgrades and hope people want them."

wow,3dztks,Mvin,17,Tue Jul 21 09:44:53 2015 UTC,"I'll come out and say it, and I think a lot of folks who have left or are thinking about quitting feel the same: I love this game. I've put a metric shitload of time, effort, and money into it. I have made tons of friendships, conquered incredible challenges, and created memories that are going to last a lifetime. I enjoy the story (including the ridiculous amount of Green Jesus shoved down my proverbial throat). I love the bosses, quests, characters, classes, and even most of the professions!  With that out of the way, I think the biggest problem I have with WoW is that it no longer values my time. I'm sure a lot of folks are looking at that statement as some kind of elitist asshole remark who you'll be glad to never have to play with again. Read on then, friend.  I have been playing since Vanilla, played every expansion to this point with a few breaks in between for real life ventures. I have invested literally thousands of hours into this game, as I'm sure many of you have. When I look over my entire account and try to decide what I'm proud of, what I have to show for all of my time put into this game, is nothing that any other player can't achieve within a week or two of playing on a light schedule (I view a light schedule as 2-3 hours a day, 5 days a week - so somewhere between 10 - 15 hours/week).  I'm not saying that content shouldn't be accessible, nor should old titles and achievements be completely locked once their relevant expansion has ended. Its neat that specific titles like Hand of Adal, the PvP old titles, and even the oldschool Vanilla epic mounts are locked and unobtainable now. I also don't think it would hurt anyone to have those things available for the masses.  I want there to be difficult to obtain achievements. I want there to be titles that someone can have on their character and I can go - WOW they put so much work into that! The only title I am ever impressed by anymore is the Insane, and even that has been reworked to be a bit easier.  Reputations are a great example of a problem I have with the game. As the game has grown, its added more and more factions for you to gain reputation with and to earn rewards from. That's great because it makes it so that the more time you put into the game doing things related to that faction, the quicker you can obtain the rewards you want. From what I have seen, Blizzard has taken this to two incredibly different extremes. They put dailies in for the major factions so that you can earn your reputation quicker! Not quite. A lot of the reputations that have been added remove the ability to be able to grind them out via turn ins, killing creatures, and your only way to obtain reputation with them is to complete the dailies. This gates me to spending a specific portion of my day just to obtain that reward. What if I have a couple hours on Friday, but only an hour on Monday to play? I can't make up the difference on Friday if I am unable to complete all the quests on Monday. Then there is the flipside - see things like the Laughing Skull. The ONLY way to earn reputation is by spending a large chunk of time simply grinding mobs. There is no big quest reputation reward to look forward to each day, nor is there any other task you can do to work on your reputation. You're funneled into one activity for the entire period of time you spend working toward that goal. That's not fun either. Some days I'm in a mood to grind tons of mobs. Other days, I just want to knock out those quests and move on to a different activity.   Let ME choose how I spend my time. Give me OPTIONS in how to do content. By choosing to gate content via dailies I feel like Blizzard is setting a value for my time, and if I dislike the activity or time investment needed I will simply be unable to obtain the rewards. The alternative is to be completely pissed off and angry that I'm forced into doing something I don't enjoy to get something I want. So I'm choosing not to do the content anymore.  Dailies aren't the only thing that feels to me that WoW under appreciates my time. I spent a fair amount of time, gold, and effort working on my professions over every single expansion. I enjoyed the small perks (double flask time, a couple extra stats, etc.) that came along with putting in the effort over the course of the expansion. As time has gone on however, they have made catching up in professions MUCH easier and have slowly stripped away the rewards for having professions at max level. I don't think professions should be hard to level necessarily, but there should be some perks for putting in the effort to obtain some of the more difficult recipes and materials. However, all of that I feel are minor issues compared to what Garrions have done. They have single handedly made it so that any max level character has access to the basic levels of any profession they want for little to no cost. That is absolutely ridiculous. No they don't have access to the lower level items, but they can create level 90 and above items to sell on the auction house with professions they don't even have. Epic items even! If you have enough resources you can churn out tons of gear to put on the AH and make a decent buck. Why should I bother leveling a profession anymore, when I can just farm Garrison resources instead?  So I went out and checked out what I thought were greener pastures. I don't regret it for even a moment. There are so many systems that would do a great job in helping increase the value of the game for players on their time. Wildstar has the BEST housing system I have ever experienced and I would kill for something like that in WoW. Final Fantasy XIV has The Hunt system and FATES that really get you out and about in the world for real, tangible rewards - not to mention their crafting! I think RIFT's mentoring system is great and should be added to every single MMO in existence. Heck, even within Blizzard's own IPs they added the best Transmog/Glamor system I've seen to date.  There are some positives of course. The raiding in this game is great, and doesn't really have any competition. I have never had a problem setting aside time to work with other players on beating content. I have tackled some of the Mythic content, and outside of the organization to get the group together, its some of the most rewarding things I have ever done in a video game. I have founded a guild with friends, and have watched it slowly grow to encompass other games and differing playstyles.  If Blizzard adds in some of the systems I listed, along with a new class (because I'm a sucker for new ways to do combat), I would probably resub. Depending on how well they implement the systems they may even be able to keep me playing for a bit. Who knows? But in the end, if they keep doing things that I feel removes value from my time I just can't see myself sticking around for long."

Enough of the fragmented bullshit or garrisons, Ashran hubs, one and done cities.....bring us together.  Remember how central the capital cities use to be?  We all gathered in Ironforge/Orgimmar, Shattrath and Dalaran?  Remember how you would spot folks from the other faction who were your nemisis.

Multiple for every class! It seems pretty unanimous, anathema/benediction, green fire, pally/lock mounts, fray island, all amazing class quests and experiences that flesh out ones character. Why is blizzard not doing them more regularly when they are pretty much always loved to death? Bring back old talent trees while keeping the current system. I think they would work well together. Remove LFR. Merge mythic and heroic. Fill the LFR void with entry level raids that provide learning experiences. Naxx 10, Zul'gurub, karazhan for example. Bring back a badge system and the wotlk style reputation tabards for heroics so they stay relevant. Make professions a viable endgame again! Let us make useful high ilvl equipment (equivalent to the current raids) and more advanced enchants and gems. No more legendary quest lines.. boring! TBC style dungeons where multiple instances are made with the same tileset. Sure they won't all be 100% unique visually, but do they have to be?  Bring back on use trinkets in PvE and further allow us to control our dps rather than being at the whim of rng. Redo the item squish, this time for real. I was hyped at the thought of doing tbc/wotlk numbers again, but here we are approaching 200k dps. It's silly. Return to the storylines people care about. Sylvanas, the new lich king, the burning legion, the naga. Cata MoP and WoD have all felt like fillers.  2-3 year expansion cycles."
wow,3dztks,xinxy,7,Tue Jul 21 03:29:10 2015 UTC,"I would love if they redid the guild finder/recruiting.

For me personally i can't raid tuesday's, i have a prior commitment, but i can raid wed/thurs no problem.  It took me forever to find a guild that raided on only raided wed/thurs. We could even have easy to read filters of how far they have progressed to see if they are active etc. It would make it way easier for a player to find a guild that fit, and easier for a guild to find new players, and all with less spam in chat!  I'd also like improved garrisons/housing.  I like the idea of the garrison, even sending followers out to earn some passive gold.  However, i don't like that professions/gathering can all be done in the garrison.  I'd like more housing customization design than a separate fortress.  Like many others i would also like to see some deviation from Orcs being the focus.  There are just so many other races/stories that could be told."

I want to feel somewhat lost in my early levels once in a while.  No amount of time travel and lore twists and level cap increases in new expansions will bring any of that back.   Plus the game engine has been patched beyond even Blizzard's wildest expectations. I'm tired of everything looking like the sky is eternally overcast. Faint shadows, no contrast, no HDR. The game seems to have only brief moments of it in certain areas (very dark shadows) and then everything is drab again. Their talented artists have carried them too long.

wow,3dztks,xHesketh,13,Mon Jul 20 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"It would take nothing short of a full modern-generation reboot of WoW - minus Brian Holinka, Greg Street and everybody else who has contributed HEAVILY to the game's downfall thus far - for me to consider paying for this game again.  There is nothing fun at all about wading through the same linear quest treadmill over and over and over again when levelling alts. Hell, it wasn't even remotely fun the first time when levelling my main through Cataclysm, Mists and Warlords quest content. The fact that post-Cataclysm Azeroth is so streamlined, rushed and linear in comparison to the original game world has pretty much killed any sense of enjoyment and wonder that the original vanilla game world had.  The fact that I played on a Vanilla private server (which I will not name here) and had more fun levelling a Paladin to 15 than I did wading through Draenor speaks volumes at how far this game has gone to the dogs. And Paladin wasn't even a fun class to play. It was the weakest class, and couldn't do anything other than heal in groups.  Plus the way stats and gearing work now feels heavily dumbed down, to the point where there is no sense of achievement when you level up your character, or get a rare item.  I remember back when I was levelling my Hunter in early Burning Crusade and how OP I felt when I finally farmed the 150 gold necessary to buy a Bow of Searing Arrows. Or how good it felt to actually be ahead of your professions and farm a really, really, really good Blue or Epic piece of gear. Nowadays you can queue for a few dungeons and get welfare-rares that outclass all these fucking items, and then outlevel your welfare-rares in a few more quick-fire dungeon runs and get even more welfare-rares to replace your old ones.  Then there's the fact that before Patch 3.3, you had to actually form groups and travel to instances, and you actually had a server-wide reputation to uphold, compared to now where you stand in your garrison and queue for Heroics or LFR. Today, WoW feels like a mediocre single player game and one that definitely doesn't deserve a subscription fee.  Also, I liked stats such as Defense Rating, Dodge Rating, Parry Rating, and the fact that Intelligence increased my Mana pool and my Spell Critical Hit chance for instance. The fact that Primary stats do nothing other than ""increase your attack/spell power"" proves how mind-numbingly boring and pointless they now are. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard went full-circle and just removed Agility, Strength and Intelligence altogether, only to have a single unified stat called Power.  And don't get me started on Talents either. No, I much preferred the old talent system thank you very much, because at least it made your class's capabilities easily understandable and not locked into loads of confusing-as-fuck passive skills in your spellbook. And the new talents offer you very, very limited choice for character customization and has still been min-maxxed the fuck out to still have a cookie-cutter build that a DPS spreadsheet will tell you to NEVER deviate from.  Anyway, rant over. I just wish there was a MMORPG out that was just like Vanilla/TBC era WoW. I'd give Archeage a chance but it's like the publishers are Trion to sink that game to the ground with all its P2W bullshit."

Ready to rock. Have fun, hit ~1730 on my rogue. Bam. Patch hits. I have to replace it with GREEN AND BLUE peices... that sucks, but sure. Whatever. But then I find that I HAVE to do Ashran.   Racials in PvP. They have screwed the pooch on this one. Even if, for balance sake, they decided to disable racials in PvP, the factions would still be unbalanced. People went to the Alliance. They already payed the money. What would incentivize them to go back Horde? If there will be no difference, hell they are already Alliance. They will just stay there.  The key is to put quality content out. Make things fun and people will do them. Don't make me grind LFR for 2 months. Don't force me to do Ashran. Make things great and players will do them!"

I like dailies, not MoP launch numbers with all the gating but a good amount of dailies.  While we're at it, having a choice would be great.

Firstly, remove garrisons. I don't want some clicky Facebook game. It's boring, and a drag. Secondly, get rid of the mine and garden for everyone, and get rid of profs for all. Leads me onto second point.   Professions. Fix them. They are useless, boring and a royal waste of time. The fact I make more money off ore stacks from a cata and mists than I do on stacks of ore from this xpac screams something is up. Bring in a new profession maybe, just do something. Please.   Content. I want less linear questing. Fair enough, have a storyline, that's great, but I don't want to have to endure the exact same order of quests on every single one of my alts. It's boring, and makes levelling a repetitive tedious drag. I want to be able to choose how I play the game, have multiple zones for a single level, not just go through a pre determined recipe in only one way.  End game, rep. Bring back tabards. I have other responsibilities to wow, and I can't always dedicate an hour and a half of my day to doing rep grinding dailies. Let me play the game my way, so I can go and do dungeons at the same time. Let me experience content aside from dailies to get rep. Tanaan dailies fucking suck, especially given the tiny arse amount of rep you get per quest. Not impressed blizzard. It takes me about an hour and a bit to complete them all, including the fel corrupted apexis daily one.

Plain and simple.   Different story lines. I'm bored of orcs and humans. Look at wrath, you had undead, trolls, undead trolls, giants and gods, wintergrasp(which rocked imo), dragons, Lich king... What we got in wod, orcs.. Orcs.. And more orcs. Boring.  (and no, ever bloom doesn't cut it as far as different varied content is concerned)   A new city: bring back the community feel. Not some crap mess like stormshield, a nice cool city like dalaran. Bring back the community feel, even if players don't interact you had mammoth chains, and people running about. It brought the immersiveness to life.   Classes and specs : I want classes that feel different. And changing the energy used doesn't count. Wow, warlocks have embers and makes have mana, and hunters have focus, and s priests have orbs.. That'll distract them from the fact they all feel the same. Let me specialise my character, give talent trees a bit more usage. I know the old type were a bit tough, but I loved them cause you're character you could adapt to your play style. Now it's like, yeah, you get three specs. You can't mix and match anymore, you pick one and play it. Done. Deal with it.   Lore: I'm not big on lore, but a good storyline would be nice.

Then, after they cut 10-man mythic, we get an expansion with the least amount of content to date, despite arriving behind schedule to begin with (and which will almost certainly have another drawn-out final raid tier). And Watcher showed up in an interview just recently and said ""Mythic consumes a very small percentage of the resources that go into making a given raid. If we cut Mythic, it would reduce the amount of time that goes into making raid zones by 5-10%."" (link).  It sounds an awful lot like they fucked us over for no reason, and 10-man raiding was just another corner that got cut on the road to Warlords."
wow,3dztks,pace202,3,Tue Jul 21 01:10:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. SO MANY raid groups have fallen apart just because getting 20 people together at the highest level of raiding content is pretty difficult. Plus the bigger the raid group is, the more impersonal it feels, in my opinion at least. And feeling disconnected socially in the one thing that has been otherwise extremely well-done (raiding) in WoD is not a good thing for player satisfaction."
wow,3dztks,narkisim,2,Tue Jul 21 00:10:08 2015 UTC,"Oh man. THIS SO MUCH. We raid 2days per week, because all of us are grown up and cant spend more time on the game anymore. Still we want to play a challenging game and use our small time as succesful as possible and not be bored to death by whats called 'heroic' raiding. But since you need 20 people of your skill and social level, all we do is recruiting and teaching, which takes more time than the raiding itself. Its so frustrating especially, because i can't see any of the promised improvements concerning innovative encounter design"
wow,3dztks,Cherryroll,7,Tue Jul 21 00:16:52 2015 UTC,"More open world content. Professions as an alternate progression method, along with dungeons. So you could spend time doing those things and get close to raid gear, but it would require group quests, world bosses, etc.   I'd also like questing to be substantially harder. End game, I'd like more reasons to do five mans."

Picking buildings is fine and all, but let us decorate them how we like. Litter decorations through content to encourage people to go out and collect it, like toys/pets/music sheets.  Give flexibility back to how conquest can be capped. Being forced into a particular unfun form of pvp just to keep up with gear sucks."

Patch 6.2 came out what a month ago? There was lots of content but there is no reason to do the content for the last 4 months it's just been logging on to raid then logging off after that. Blizzard has gotten greedy and I won't support that."

Class homogenization killed PvP, and I want my class to feel like...well, like MY class. I don't want to be a metal priest. I don't want to be a chainmail druid. I don't want to be the same as any other class.  I want PvP to be strategic, for the classes to matter, have different strategies and interactions, instead of "" lol guardian druid flag runs, gg "" or "" wait for his offensives to pop and see who can get their CD's to line up better. ""  Idk. I'm not too amazing at articulating my thoughts, I suppose. I just feel like every class is the same, and like everyone needs to do Ashran to be competitive. I want it to be class based, like everyone has the same Ilevel of gear in a random BG ( just a random idea off the top of my head. )  To close, I guess the story is secondary to me. WoD had a nice story ( for Horde ) but it's very...lacking to me. I have been subbed until WoD, and the PvP / class homogenization killed it for me."

I want cool shit that makes my class unique and awesome, not just some boring stat buff ability (look at pallys for one instance, they get rid of the gaurdian that fights for u and replace with a shitty dmg buff to templar's verdict???)

wow,3dztks,Penfolds_five,3,Tue Jul 21 07:01:22 2015 UTC,"I've been off and on since mid-Cataclysm, WoD was the least I've spent in any expansion (about two weeks). Here's what I'd like to see:  More Server Merges/Cross Realm I don't care how it's done but get rid of all the ghost town servers. Link servers together as bigger clusters, 4-5 if you can. I want a lot of options for Guilds without handing Blizzard transfer money and I want a more vibrant community without having to play on one of the designated ""big"" servers.  A Focus on Casual Play I'm a Raider but the game needs things besides LFR and Dailies for casual players to do. As I've branched out into other games like GW2 and FFXIV I've seen how great things like mini-games can be. Implement more of that and add some cute, non-power rewards to it. WoW is setup to do mounts, costumes, toys, titles, etc. so make use of that.  Keep non-Endgame Content Going All Xpac Add Dungeons with each patch, add daily hubs and world events, make changes to the game world that reflect things like the plot advancing. Don't just add a new Raid, balance notes, and a new Arena Season because that's lazy.  Split PvP and PvE Forever And I mean entirely. Each ability, every single one, should have a PvE and PvP variation. Balance them independently, give me a third spec option instead of the two I have now. Stop adding new BGs and Arena Maps, instead better the ones you already have.  Provide Multiple Gear Progression Models Gear treadmills suck but that's WoW, so make it less of a grind. Add Badges back but make them slower to gain gear with than raiding. Keep Mythic Dungeons as a way for small groups to gain Badges a decent rate while also providing a challenge (and make them hard!)  No one cares about having this gear or that gear, it's not Vanilla anymore. We all have our own preferred xmogs, no one e-peens about gear so just let people access it in a comfortable way.  Remove Almost All RNG Garrison RNG, Socket/Warforged RNG, Loot Boxes, get rid of it all. If I do PvP I want Honor/Conquest Points to buy the best rewards, if I get a BiS drop it better not be ""well it is BiS IF it had a gem slot"". Be creative about getting me to want to farm bosses, stop being lazy. Maybe add some variation on the bosses, they change week to week? You did it with Chromaggus in BWL - I think you can handle it a decade later.    To come back, overall, I'd have to see Blizzard stop being a shit MMO developer. Other games are running laps around WoW and the only reason they're afloat is because a lot of people are tied to this game for personal reasons. Blizzard needs to show it can compete with Square, ArenaNet, and the rest instead of milking their fans.  I doubt they will do any of this because it would require effort and money, which they don't need to do because not enough people unsub to create change. At the end of the day the players are at fault because those who are still active are contributing to the bottom line."
wow,3dztks,Dizzaster,3,Tue Jul 21 07:41:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Not much.. Just.. good.. content.. and not some half-assed bullshit storyline where the main villain on the box art suddenly turns good and gets off the hook and shit. Just give us interesting shit to do. Keep that idea of followers and ships, but actually make us go on MISSIONS with our followers. I'd love to assemble a small squad to take on a raid boss in a single player scenario. Then it's my fault if the mission goes downhill.  also.. please.. less RNG. RNG is fun in a silly cardgame like Hearthstone, but I really don't want to get my best-in-slot item one week and the next week it drops again with a warforge, socket and tertiary stats and I feel like a colossal dick for rolling on it again just for those few extra stats. People LOVE loot. But people don't really give a shit about the numbers. I've very rarely looked at an item like ""Ohh baby, this thing has +200 Strength. This is gooood shitttt"". We're in it for the visuals. Make them visually appealing again and not just the high-end loot from the highest difficulty. BC had tons of amazing items scattered through all the dungeons, raids and heroic dungeons. I've been running BC dungeons for transmog purposes on many alts, but I'll never once step inside a WoD dungeon for transmog purposes ever again, because there's simply nothing there."
wow,3dztks,Beeslikesteve,3,Tue Jul 21 10:21:17 2015 UTC,"Bring back the feel of each class, more diversity, class quests, class items. While they are at it, bring back some form of customization in specs. In Vanilla-WotLK, everyone was a little different spec wise. While high end raiders used cookie cutter min/max builds, the average player had plenty of room to play around. I had a crazy half and half build on my rogue that I pvp'd with and had tons of fun. Nowadays, every spec of a class is a carbon copy of every other one.  Make LFR a learning tool for new raiders. Community is dying, and it isn't because of LFG/LFR. It's because elitism runs deep amount raiders, and it's a problem that has only been getting worse since the end of WotLK. Early days of WoW, it was easy to get into a new guild, even secure a raid spot, just be showing you have the patience to learn. Now you have to go into raid knowing 100% of the fights, being fully geared from said raid and being able output perfect dps numbers. It's damn near impossible to join a raiding guild unless you have equal or greater raiding experience than their current highest kill. Even getting in pugs requires AotC (often for normals!). Using LFR as a learning tool to teach newer players raids will at least give them a fighting chance at getting in the floor level, instead of being tourist mode fights they can afk through and don't learn any mechanics from.  Never mention the garrison again. Ever. Seriously just nuke it and leave it to die. Make real capital cities for people to congregate in.  Stop the time gating. Time gate mechanics are lazy. I understand the concept is to keep us around for as long as possible to stretch sub time, but in ye olde days, it was done by making the game fun to play, not making it take a minimum of X days of farming to accomplish a goal. Somewhere along the line they stopped asking how to make the game so much fun we didn't want to leave, and started asking how to make the game punishing to not play constantly.   Stop telling us how to have fun. Blizzard (and more specifically Watcher) has spent the entire expansion telling us what fun is, that we have been having fun incorrectly, and that they know what is fun to us so we need to just trust them because its so much more fun this way. They ""fixed"" what wasn't broken and are bleeding subs at an unprecedented rate because of it.  Outdoor content that isn't just a boring grind. 6.0-6.1 had no outdoor content worth doing. Sure you could farm mats, but it was pointless as you had more than you could ever use from your garrison. You could farm rep, but it was pointless as the rewards were garbage and the grind was mindnumbingly bad. Aside from raiding, that was about it. You raided, or you didn't play. 6.2 attempts to give outdoor content, but it gets so boring and grindy so fast. Each rep is a boring grind (grind catpeople, grind apexis zones, grind rares), with the bonus of two of them being time gated. I got my pathfinder on my main and am already so bored I can't bring myself to do any of Tanaan on my alts, even though I could use the apexis gear. A good outdoor hub (or three) would do wonders to keep players interested and give us options of content to do instead of burning us out after a month.  Heroic Dungeons that matter. Bring back badges of a sort. Some form of currency that keeps people going into dungeons even after they out gear them. Half hour long queues for heroic dungeons on tanks and healers just because nobody does them anymore sucks. Also, having more than a handful would do great on preventing burnout."
wow,3dztks,panderman7,3,Tue Jul 21 10:32:08 2015 UTC,"No time travel bullshit. I felt immediately disconnected with this expansion because I couldn't escape the notion that NONE of what happened in this expansion really matters because it's not the reality my character is from. We were just stopping a threat, that's it. It felt like they were going back to Draenor because they wanted to do something cool but it really fell flat with the whole alternate universe thing. If going back to old Draenor was truly the best thing for the story I would have liked it to be approached different. Going back and having the option to stop what caused outland to happen only to have things end up the way they would have any way would have been interesting from a story perspective.   I don't want Blizzard telling people how to play the game anymore. More than any other developer I've ever seen, Blizz gets feedback and then goes 30 steps past that feedback. People said they didn't like as many dailies as mists threw at them, so instead of just cutting down the amount of dailes they pretty much got rid of them and replaced them with a bar that fills up. Who thought that was a good idea? Then Blizz comes out and says ""We know we fucked up with these rep grinds, but you wanted flying and we didn't want to give it to you... so here's more rep grinds"". WTF.   There has to be more than raiding. A BIG reason the garrison did what it did, in my opinion, is because the main designers on the game right now were/are hardcore raiders. If you look at the garrison design it's built around the idea that you don't have to farm anymore, you get access to professions you normally wouldn't, you got money to handle repair bills, etc. and all of that is done so you don't have to do anything but raid. None of the ""busy work"" such as farming needs to happen if you just used the garrison. It broke professions and destroyed the economy. What's worse is that people who don't want to raid all the time were left with a great leveling experience and a really shitty end game experience.   I also want to see some individual flavor added back to classes. I'm really over hearing that the things that make each class unique or the quests around them are too time consuming or not important. MMOs are a genre where people really identify with/become their characters. Having people work for something isn't a bad thing, as long as you don't swing too hard so that the reward isn't worth the tedium needed to get it.   To go hand in hand with that, Wow is a game that doesn't respect my time anymore. The idea that it takes 30 days to craft something is laughable and screams ""We just want you to keep subbing"" rather than actually providing a hook or feedback loop that's fun and encourages me to do more than just log in a few minutes a day for the next 74 days just so I can make a bag. That's RIDICULOUS. I don't want everything handed to me, but I also don't want this giant barrier of entry on EVERYTHING, particularly when it isn't about skill or anything like that, instead it's just about juggling a 24 hour cool down for a month to get something I want. When they started getting outrageous with those timers on crafting I lost a TON of interest in the game. Further, the logging in daily thing doesn't work for most people I don't think. I have plenty of friends who used to log in daily. Now very few of them do. I'd like to see more varied options to get things done that are flexible and don't hurt the people who can't log in every single day. If I could only log in 3 days a week then I'm immediately behind on EVERYTHING and the amount of time needed to get something via dailies or cool downs jumps exponentially. I think that's REALLY shitty design and unfortunately it's the only real design behind a good chunk of crafted things like bags.   And last, I really want them to start LISTENING. I know a lot of people were happy about flying but it felt like the way they gave it to us was the most passive aggressive way possible. Blizzard has a SERIOUS pr problem right now and it's entirely their own fault. If you told me 5 years ago that blizzard would start to resemble a company that only cared about money I would have laughed at you. Yet here we are in 2015 and that's how I feel. I don't feel like any of the decisions they've made since this expansion has launched have been about the players and what's good for the populace of the game. Instead it feels like their choices have been made to make things easier on the development team and to drive people towards more and more monetized strategies rather than making a good product. That bothers me IMMENSELY because Blizzard always made money BECAUSE their games were so good. Now it feels like that quality is taking a hit and they're eating through the good will of their community. That to me is a core issue that has lead to an expansion like WoD. An expansion that is lighter on content than it's ever been yet is more expensive than previous expansions. If Blizzard wants more money I will gladly give it to them but I expect a fully realized product in exchange, not a compromised one and unfortunately WoD is a VERY compromised product. One that has really soured me on picking up anything from them on day one."

I didn't really feel as if I my character gained much power as I obtained gear in Highmaul, BRF, and now HFC. In retrospect I clearly did, but I was never highly anticipating getting each piece of gear. I just sort of took what was an upgrade and went on with my life. The stats were sort of confusing. Haste and Mastery were top priority, however the majority of my gear had versatility on it despite that stat being horrible for most classes. The stat was on almost every piece of gear in there, and intellect bonus from the high ilvl piece out weighed the crappy stat.  In addition to that, I'd like something outside of raids to actually do. Something that takes more than 5 minutes every 2 hours to manage. I found myself wanting to log into play the game and having nothing to do after a few minutes of doing my garrisons. Eventually I made a few alts, but I was just replaying the same exact monotonous content over and over. If I have 3-4 hours to spare, I want to be able to spend it doing something other than AFK in my garrison."
wow,3dztks,nicajco,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:15 2015 UTC,"I think there needs to be a return to a story driven expansion. I had some of my best experiences with Wrath. You always felt like you were gearing up to fight LK. He was the villain. He appeared in dungeons, quests, DK starting line, everywhere.   I would also love to be able to have some abilities back. I used to love playing my Pally and having interesting abilities that made sense and made you feel like a paladin. I miss DI. I miss Hand of Salv. I miss feeling like a badass shield wielding tank that could just soak damage up. You felt like your class was important to your characters identity.  Give me a reason to continue playing other than just senseless grinds for no wall reward. I liked having there be interesting factions with rewards you wanted and could still be useful into the expansion. In WoD we get useless trinkets from factions you don't care about. Or followers you don't need. They sort of got back to it a little bit with Tanaan but once you have the mount, and the rep for flying it doesn't make much sense to continue to me. Make the tokens BoA.  LFR was great when it was just a lower level of the gear you could get in harder difficulties. I liked that you could get tier even if it was lowered a bit. LFR drops now seem just uninspired and ugly. I have my T6 on mog forever now. The gear is just awful looking.  I've been playing since 2005 and unless something that comes along 'WoWs' me I won't bother continuing past this expansion"
wow,3dztks,cakedayin4years,2,Tue Jul 21 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"A new race and class a the bare minimum. Those would at least give me some more alt-leveling incentive.  Besides that they need to ditch the alternate universe/time travel bologna and have a storyline that actually impacts our characters and their world. It can be argued that WoD sort of does, but not to the point where our character would still be there months later captaining a naval yard for apexis and gold missions.  Raidingwise they're on their A game outside of the content releases, so keep up the good work there. But more outdoor content, more non-raid endgame content and I'm not even a PVPer but even I think they need to do a serious overhaul to PVP to take it out of the state it's in.

wow,3dztks,averagewhity,2,Tue Jul 21 01:19:22 2015 UTC,"WARINING: BIG RANT AHEAD  Endgame(ish) pve besides raid. Mythic dungeons is a step in the right direction, tho it would be great if it also introduced new mechanics like the raid diff does. Maybe having heroics as the one you que into for just regular blues, while for mythic you form a party just like now but for rewards dungeon sets make a return, could also have them drop stuff for professions(more below).  Class flavor. This is a big one for me honestly, nowdays in raids all classes feel the same. Healers all have their all-mighty dispells and that one healing cd, buffs are homogenised, lots of debuffs gone, dps no longer have things their class excels at or is specificly needed for (imo it's a good thing this way pre mythic). Also class quests. I love what they did with green fire, but I understand that something that big cannot be done for every class. Still having smaller quests for small cosmetic rewards would be quite nice, tho I'd personally but a difficulty gateing on it along with soulbound mat grind so it would really be something special that not that many people have but with some practice it can be done, and is not bound to ilvl. (simular to how the epic hunter quest was in vanilla where you had to kite the demon, and was impossible to faceroll.)  It would also be nice to see threat return, the way it is now it just feels like a useless mechanic that is only there so the boss attacks the tank you want it to.  I honestly wouldn't really mind reagents returning, if they implement something like an extra bag for just those that can be upgraded would add back some nice flavour.  Profession overhaul is something that should have happened quite a while ago, they way they are now is soooo boring and everyone having access to everything just feels wrong. Maybe mats as raid and dungeon drops would help, but returning to the recipe system is a must IMO. Professions shouldn't just be about daily cd until purple. I mentioned the dungeons or raids getting mats, what if the re were soulbound mats used to create soulbound items that are slightly better than the ones you can sell? It would give proffs so flavour simular to the alch flasks and engi toys. Also blizzard could learn something from GW2's cooking. (dat recipe discovery)  The removal of garrisons. This one is quite obvious. It kills all the mmo from the game, waiting in dalaran for your que to pop is 100x better than sitting in the garrison doing the same. It just feels lonely. I noticed the other day that while in the garrison I don't even read stuff like trade chat, I just alt-tab out and check from time to time for the que to pop. While being in a major city you can do much more. Drolling over other people's tier3 shoulders, blocking one of the auctioneers with some transformation toys, showing off with your swift spectral tiger that you spent 2 years worth of your gold savings on, just generally interracting with other people for fun.  Pvp wise I can't really say much since I was never into it, but based on the community's and some friend's opinion things need to change racials wise, The other problems come from class homogenising. As for Ashran, they messed that one up for good, the idea isn't bad at all but the execution is just horrible. Also having parties so big half of the community has 5fps inside isn't a good idea either.  Other things to do out in the world. Pet battles and Brawlers Guild were great additions to the game, also things like Isle of Thunder and Isle of Quel'Danas were great daily hubs. If the Brawlers Guild gets expanded and daily areas and dungeons make their return with professions somehow tieing into these than I belive there wouldn't really be anyone who would say the game is lacking content for quite a while.   All in all I just think that for me there need to be too many things changed in a single expansion to make me want to play for a longer period of time. Of course I'll always return to check out new stuff since I've always been, but for me there needs to be a bigger change to get back into the game.   /rant  TLDR: So many thing to list, not enough devs to make it happen in one xpack for me, can't let go of the old times."

I want to be able to just do something in the world that has no consequence on my progression, but gives me the sense of playing. Garrisons had this potential, but it really fell flat in the sense that it should of been more of a player housing system instead of a progression tool.   I also really hate the fact that RNG is in everything. Like put a cap on the amount of times i can run a boss before a mount drops or xmog gear, or really anything. I don't want to have to run Onyxia 500 times, it doesn't make it fun it just makes it a chore with the chance of a reward."

wow,3dztks,FakeChef,2,Tue Jul 21 02:30:15 2015 UTC,"All wow needs, and has always needed was something to do outside of raids. What they have been doing is adding different type of grinds to gain cosmetic items. What blizzard needs to add is a Alternate Advancement system that improves your character out side of raids and gear.   Having a alternate advancement system will also stop the mass split runs that the high end guilds are doing. It was fine when it was just the very top guilds doing them, but now even guilds who can't fully clear heroic the first week are doing 2-3 split runs."

I have done timewalking and I'm insanely not in love with it. Its not about the dungeon but its how we play. Spamming quick heal while quick heal not really a proper way to do it this expac, seems really contradicting to how we should play. I want more triage, doing time walking make me feel asleep. People are right, some trademark spells or the way they play just make the class lost its uniqueness.  Lastly, I want activision out from our game please. Everything has going down to shit because higher management. Developers are being criticized while in reality they able to do that but they were probably told to focus on making cash. Fuck  your cash, this is WoW not D3. Stop generalizing your game, stop reusing your other game ideas to here, dont be lazy and we will appreciate your effort."

wow,3dztks,boradush,2,Tue Jul 21 04:11:45 2015 UTC,"A levelling experience that is not as on-a-string and faceroll as it has been since Cataclysm. Bring back some semblance of class balance during levelling. Distinct classes. That includes, but is not limited to, class quests, spec-specific and distinctive abilities, and spec-specific talent trees. Bring back some ""RP-ey"" stuff that got cut for convenience. I liked hunters using arrows, pets having loyalty levels, rogues brewing poison. That was a part that also made classes feel distinct. An environment that isn't quite as reliant on (outdated) pop culture references and memes, but one that focuses more on immersive world building again. That includes having an open world that isn't completely irrelevant outside of the levelling process. Gameplay that relies less on jump'n'run and twitch reflexes and once again focuses more on teamwork and tactical play. Less real-time wasters. Less restrictions on how much I can progress in a given period of time. I have weeks where I barely get to play, and then weeks where I can play ten hours in one sitting. Having so many daily allotments and cooldowns puts a severe crimp in my gaming experience. I want WoW to be a game, not a second job where I feel like I have to put in regular appearances. No more farmville shit. I played WoW because I wanted to have adventures, explore places, not have a text wall tell me how my minions had all the fun. Close your real-money shop. Abolish that ""real money for gametime for WoW gold"" token. Get rid of the 90 boost, or at least decouple it from the WoD purchase. Have dungeons again that feel like ""We five of us are exploring this dangerous place"" instead of a theme-park-ride chore. Have them be a viable thing to do at end game. Not everyone is into raiding or even has the commitment or time for it. Get rid of cross-server, or at least let me put an option to only be grouped and and only see people from my server. People I meet should be potential allies, potential friends I explore the world with, not temporary doodads to create the illusion of a living world. Include that ""appear offline"" option you've been talking about a few years back (and then never mentioned again), or re-work your battle-tag shit in a way that lets me have some control over who sees me online at a given time. It's either not using it at all or being completely transparent.   I am sure I forgot a lot of points, and I am sure a lot of people are going ""but that's unrealistic"". True, I do not think that Blizzard will implement any of that. but that was not the question. The question was what would bring me back to WoW. And that is what it would take."

There was a fucking axe in a taxi in times square for christ sake. The fees went up for the game, and the subs. And what we got was the least amount of content in any expansion, ever.

Bring back my class flavor, they gutted warriors and turned them into a laughing stock by every other class, I lost iconic spells such as overpower and heroic strike for fury/arms, and we are way too RNG dependent for it to be fun.  Make the world feel full again- which means NO PLAYER HOUSING.  I'm fine if they brought back garrisons, but make them a guild garrison and have it smack in the center of a major city or something.  I'm perfectly content with the flying compromise they made in WoD so long as they go into the next expansion with that already set in place so people can work on it from day one.  Bring back bonus gold on quests once you hit max level and you'll see people going out more frequently to finish up quests and be in the world.  Give me daily quests in their original form but make the rewards similar to a wrath style system- a little bit a day versus a week's worth on a Sat.  Yes it's more convenient, but then you have the issue of consistency.    In reality? I'll buy the next expac and resub till I hit max level, mess around with end game content, etc.  Their problem will be keeping me for longer than a few months."

wow,3dxern,Danielvonluchau,2,Mon Jul 20 18:05:44 2015 UTC,"Not for me.  One reason why I'm looking forward more to a Warcraft 1 movie than a Warcraft 3 movie is simply because it gives us time to focus on the two major races of the universe. They are after all the faces of Warcraft. Even in WoW, we still have the Horde, and the Alliance despite the various race additions to the factions.  It's also an easier movie to do right if you only have to consider the perspectives of only two races. Just imagine the clusterfuck that a Warcraft 3 movie would be. There are simply too many races to cover fairly in a 2 hours movie. Warcraft 3's big appeal is that it builds off the two previous games and add so much more to the universe, but if you're not familiar with the original orc vs human conflict, you might easily mistake it for a Lord of the Rings wannabe.  I would have preferred if they kept the tone of the original games they're adapting, instead of painting the whole franchise with the same WoW brush, which is unfortunately what this Warcraft movie is doing.  Ideally speaking,  Warcraft 1 would a dark and bloody entry in the series, where Orcs would be considered blood thirsty savages and humans the noble guys. While the movie would contain magic elements, it would still be very much toned down in favour of the raw violence that goes on the screen. Style trumps over substance.  Warcraft 2 would still be the same thing, but with more fantasy elements added to it, to account for the new races. Orcs would still be blood thirsty savages, but you do get a glimpse of things changing for both races.  Warcraft 3 would be the crowning achievement where your perspective of the orcs, and the humans are both completely shattered. It will have more fantastical elements (pretty special effects), but at the same time the story would be more grounded in reality than the previous two for a better contrast between it and the previous movies.  A WoW movie? At this point I'd just say fuck it, and make a full scale war and go crazy with the special effects. Yes, this will still be a good movie, but it will essentially be a return to the original movie (Warcraft 1), but on drugs (Think Starcraft 2 compared to Starcraft 1), where style trumps over substance. It would be a fitting end to the tetralogy."
wow,3dxern,Goblinator,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:15:51 2015 UTC,"While I understand that alot of people are really wanting to see their favorite characters from Warcraft 3, I say let them take their time! The story needs to flow in a natural way, let's not rush to WC3 for the sake of seeing said favorites alone.   It makes far more sense to use the characters they're introducing and build upon them in a trilogy based on the original RTS games that involve said characters, WC1, WC2 and WC2: Beyond the Dark Portal.   Not to mention that if they do that then they'll be setting up the stories of the fan favorites perfectly, Thrall and Arthas come particulary to mind here. Consider that if they end up doing that we'll probably get an entire movie where Ner'zhul plays a heavy role (Beyond the Dark Portal), who later on becomes the Lich King.

Or orcs might have been before undead but still, you gotta have arthas and the undead story before the night elf ending of reign of chaos. If they have warcraft 1 2 and 3 in this trilogy, reign of chaos would have to be in like 2 parts or so, especially if they also include frozen throne. For one movie it would have way too much content (orcs, thrall, grom, mannoroth etc. burning legion, humans and orcs going to kalimdor, arthas' story, both as human and as undead, night elfs, the end battle, illidan, frozen throne with kael'thas and blood elves, nagas, sylvanas etc.....) they cant have reign of chaos + frozen throne movies in less than a trilogy of its own.

The Hobbit furthered the technology used in these films. Harry Potter proved you can faithfully adapt from text to screen without losing the heart and soul of your characters. Game of Thrones showed that fantasy settings aren't exclusive to films, and its popularity has shown others that condensing everything to a movie isn't always good.  Eragon was despised by every fan of the book. Percy Jackson is Harry Potter in a Greek Mythology setting."

We ripped his soul from its flesh, put him in this armor - and now we're going to send him back to Azeroth as a sleeper agent so that we can utilize his latent magical properties as a power font for doing other evil shit at a later date!  Ner'zhul: Damn I hate being stuck in this block of ice, way out of the normal range of any Azerothian interaction.  Mal'ganis: Sup dude!  We're just here on shift change to abuse you for something evil.  We're going to start by creating this one sword that lets you talk to its wielder, and then we're going to stick it in a block of ice (totally original) and whomever pulls it from its cradle can become the king of england heir to all your power - so that it can eventually be used against us!"

I only got a log of one kill (just decided to start logging to track my progress again) but I got in the 88 percentile with a bad trinket (tanaan trinket) and no tier gear. Only example I have of my current status in the game. Other than that, you gotta go back to ulduar days for when I was really raiding"

wow,3dx829,ImIcyChill,2,Mon Jul 20 18:10:15 2015 UTC,Disregarding the fact that most top 200ish guilds have private logs that is not a bad number. Anyway I believe that OP has simply mistaken the circlejerk that goes around in hardcore atmospheres where calling someone ''casual'' is an insult. It's the same in dutch where the word ''farmer''(boer) is an insult but in many other languages it's not regarded as something negative while it is in The Netherlands.  TLDR: Casual is WoW slang for bad player and not an actual offensive word

But I agree with em, I raid two days a week and parse pretty high for my ilvl. Usually mid 80s to mid 90s. And yeah there's some fights that can be cheesed, but if people do it they're only hurting themselves and their guild. Not saying you're wrong by any means, because it does happen.

wow,3dx829,DemoniC1234,3,Mon Jul 20 13:02:45 2015 UTC,"iirc, in hfc the brackets are 0-684, then brackets of 3 ilvl (685-688, 689-692 and so on) so some brackets will have low participation, due to the low spread compared to what we had in brf (6ilvl brackets iirc?)"
wow,3dx829,Athrasie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:54:06 2015 UTC,Sounds about right. I'd figure we'd have twice the amount of brackets due to the progressive item level increase as the dungeon is cleared

wow,3dx829,inthrees,14,Mon Jul 20 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly this for me. I raided like it was a job in Vanilla, and I just don't want another fucking job. If I could find a guild or group of raiders who were magically up for smashing a wing when I happened to want to do it on a whim, that would be awesome and I would be pretty far into HFC normal/heroic/mythic, I expect.  But that's a crazy pipe dream so in reality I'm just already sick of the game and the intolerable time drain that multiple garrisons turned out to be or the obverse - the feeling of guilt that I'm neglecting garrisons if I don't mine/herb refresh work orders, etc.  Too much of the game is ""feels like an actual job"" and raiding hardcore is very near or at the top of that list. Do not want."
wow,3dx829,Animosis,13,Mon Jul 20 10:25:17 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way you do man.  Back in Vanilla / BC, I was beating up raids like they owed me money.  Six days a week, 9 - midnight, BGs afterwards till 1 or 2 in the morning if it was a Saturday raid.  I was decked, geared with Apolyon on down by the end of BC.  It was awe-inspiring.  I had a garbage job, I made recycling money.  Fast forward and I just can't do it anymore.  I can't stay up that late, I can't devote the time I used to.  What kills me, though, is that the desire to raid is still there.  All I want to do is raid, it's the only thing that truly keeps my interest in the game.  My same guild is still raiding 8 years later, but that's all they do.  There's no more BGs, no more alt runs.  They login, they raid, they log off.  It's a ghost town otherwise.  Finding groups to run with is even harder, they all want AOTC and ilevel gear equal to what you'd get in the run itself.  PUG raids are like credit card companies now: the less you need them, the more they want you.    And so I keep subbing, month to month, thinking that some piece of content will come along from Blizzard that can distract me from what I really wish I was doing.  The skill is still there, so is the drive.  The opportunity...not so much."
wow,3dx829,oathy,5,Mon Jul 20 17:10:49 2015 UTC,"Oh god I completely agree. I raid LFG every week because I really want to raid all the time but I just can't find a guild that either matches my schedule or wants to casually raid. I raided hardcore from Vanilla to just before ICC came out, and I loved every second of it but I just can't do it like a job anymore.  If I ever found a guild that worked for me, I'd happily pay out the transfer fees and move any of my 100s over to that server to find a new home."

And I missed this weekend because I was housesitting at my sister's and my laptop is crummy enough that while it can run wow, a view distance of ""end of your character's nose"" just kills it for me so no timewalking this weekend.  And really, when I stop to think about it, I'm excited about timewalking because it will let me gear up my alts to 650-660ish somewhat quickly (depending on drop luck, which is usually crap for me) so that I can... do what with them?"
wow,3dx829,msafunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"What kills me, though, is that the desire to raid is still there. All I want to do is raid, it's the only thing that truly keeps my interest in the game.    This speaks to me. I raided pretty hardcore in TBC. I was in one of the top DPSers in one of the top raiding guilds on my servers, and had offers from the other raiding guilds. I killed Illidan before Illidan was nerfed.  Nowadays, I top the DPS meters in LFR every week, and long for an experience that's more involved than ""target boss for 5 minutes, collect loot.""  All I want is to find a west coast guild that raids Thursday, Friday and/or Saturday from 8pm - midnight. No drama or yelling if we wipe. Just a bunch of other level-headed adults who like to kill things and understand that there's no candy in the fire."

I use to be a hardcore player, raiding 4-5 nights a week, grinding heroics and reps to get the best gear outside of raids on all my alts.  But now I have a wife, child and a job. So the last thing I want from a video game (when I do get the time to play it...) is for it to feel like another job. So I prefer casual play now, doing what I feel like. Not tied down to any raid schedules or time clocks for needing to have food/pots/flasks/etc for each raid. I jump in a group here or there and I'm fine with that. Respect the casuals, because most of today's casuals were the old days hardcore."

Don't get me wrong, if you don't want to feel like you need to be there at a certain time, that's of course fine, but there are tons of hobbies, entertainment, etc that are on a schedule. League bowling is a good example. If someone is going golfing with someone they probably expect a certain tee time. Television shows have been on a schedule since forever but no one would think making sure to be home to watch Game of Thrones or True Detective on Sunday nights is treating television like a job."

The issue, for me, is - with the way my life is now, I can no longer promise to be at my computer without interruption. Stuff happens at night, kids have nightmares, rodents dig in the trash cans, dishes need to be washed; and I have to stop what I'm doing to handle those responsibilities."

It's not ""a job"" in the literal sense, but it can feel more like work than a hobby if your unable to give it your undivided attention because of the world around you.   You mentioned golf and bowling, both of which are hobbies that require a schedule, but in those cases you schedule the time to do them and then leave the house. If I could put my computer in an office away from the things in my life that encroach on my game time, then I could give it the attention and time that raiding requires.

By all standards outside the gaming community, this is a shitload of time for an adult with a full time+ job and a family.  I think there's a real willful ignorance from most gamers in general about how much time they actually spend playing games.  I mean people are clocking 20+ hours a week and considering it casual.  If you spend 20 hours a week bowling, you'd better be looking at going pro."

However, to accomplish that, they require a different mentality to raiding. Wipe effectively, come prepared, do your own research, to be ready and as effective as possible considering the limited time you have.  The problem with casuals is just that: They don't want to put forth the energy/time because they put raiding as a lower priority. As such, they might do the following:   show up late show up unprepared randomly goes afk without prior notice generally wastes the time that other people have set aside   This is why LFR exists for casuals. You can ""enjoy"" the end-game content without having to conform to a set schedule, you can show up unprepared and even go AFK (at your own peril).  When you set the bar at being prepared, knowledgeable and performing in the 50th percentile (that's being average) in a normal raid, you'll find a lot of casuals being ""bad"" as in underperforming.  The bad news is that this translates into those fairly silly high item requirements to do any sort of PuGGing for Normal+ raids."

I'd consider myself somewhat casual (extremely casual by the standard gamer definition) playing around 5-6 hours a week, sometimes double that on the rare occasion that I have a weekend day free.  I still manage to maintain acceptable gear (both toons between 690-700 ilvl), keep up with spec changes on icy veins, and normally I parse in the 70-95th percentile depending on raid comp.  I'm probably significantly better than a lot of 'hardcore' players.  There are players of all skill levels in all brackets of play time."

I enjoy bowling, I don't enjoy having to show up every Wednesday night or risk letting down the League. So I just go bowling.  I schedule a time to golf with a friend, but we don't have a set ""go golfing every Saturday morning"" and if I don't show up, then I've let him down.  I cancelled my cable subscription and watch shows on Netflix/Hulu/HBO Go so I don't have to be there at a certain time to watch them.    If you don't mind the ""schedule"" aspect of a raiding guild, then that's great... but for many of us who used to be hardcore raiders, not having that schedule is better than finding a work around, or expecting our guild to understand when I can't get on yet again because of [insert reason here]."

I imagine this is true for many not-hardcore-but-not-really-casual people.  The choice we make is to not worry about it because raids are largely the abode of a certain population which we typically do not belong to. That's just how it is.

The gaming industry is also far more dense, with more appealing and manageable, bite-sized amounts of content.  Expecting anyone with any amount of responsibility in their life to commit (keyword being COMMIT) 4-5 hours a day for an activity that is only for entertainment purposes.. its just not feasible anymore.

wow,3dx829,Johners96,11,Mon Jul 20 21:09:50 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the term ""casual"" is thrown around how it is because of Blizzard's design choices around casual gameplay.    If you are progression raiding, you get a suitable challenge for the level you are at. You also get a level to move up to unless you are fully clearly mythic (plus old heroic) raids within a month or two of the opening of said raid.    If you are playing casually then it is different story. Pre-patch 4.3 you got nothing and had to rely on any PUG opportunities you could get. Then once they introduced LFR you got a way to see the raids with no challenge that also gave a ton of great rewards and in some cases, the rewards were better than they should have been.    Why is there this assumption from Blizzard that casual gamers don't want any challenge. As someone who plays mostly casual, I still want a challenge. LFR doesn't provide that and the Progression Raiding opportunities I do get usually come towards the end of the expansion packs. This has been the story for Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria with it, most likely, going to be the same story in Warlords of Draenor.    I would like Blizzard to make casual gameplay challenging. I'm not bad at the game, I just haven't made the choice to dedicate myself to raiding. LFR has all these failsafes that feel a bit patronising. You get a 5% buff to damage, healing and health per each wipe on a boss. This stacks up to 10 times. I've rarely gone beyond two or three stacks in groups but it is still disappointing to have the kill forced down my throat without having to do any real work for it.    Outside of any form of raiding it only gets worse. As you long as you turn up and can press some buttons you get rewarded. The garrison system throws all kind of goodies at you and there are AddOns such as Master Plan that do all the work for you with the player being left to turn up every few hours to collect rewards and send out followers on more missions. The Apexis dailies are even worse. You kill some rares, some normal mobs and collect some items to fill a bar. Once it is done you hand the quest in or you are given the rewards. Once you get enough apexis, you buy a 695 upgrade token or the gear tokens. All of that for doing next to nothing with pretty much no challenge at all.    I feel like Blizzard's idea of a ""casual"" is poor old Steven you works 40+ hours a week on minimum wage at some fast food jobs. He comes back to some run down house with a PC that isn't very capable to also have to deal with his wife and three kids. Due to all of this, the last thing Steven wants is to actually have to put any effort into anything once he finishes works so he plays whatever game that allows him to do fuck all while being given all the rewards in the world for it. Just to note, I'm not saying this to blame these people for the problems I feel exist with casual gameplay."

The issue was they had to idiot-proof the fights because realistically, people are going to queue up that just don't pay attention to the instructions on how a fight works, and thanks to their own restrictions on kicking from groups, will end up being there for the entire raid, burdening everyone unless the fights are severely watered down."
wow,3dx829,salmonman78,5,Mon Jul 20 10:45:27 2015 UTC,"^ What he said is why i think the Determination buff exists.  You have those people who are doing it due to time constraints or getting familiar with the environment/mechanics of a fight. THEN there is little billy, off in the corner chasing butterflies and playing in the dirt. Being a drag and making it tougher while not contributing. By giving that buff it allows the people who do care to compensate for those Billys in there."
wow,3dx829,miikro,8,Mon Jul 20 10:55:12 2015 UTC,"Indeed. And even without Billys (we called them Tobys in my old guild) it's just honestly and realistically very difficult to coordinate 25 complete strangers that were thrown together via a queue system with no form of voice chat to relay and clarify instructions, or liability for failure to follow instructions. Dumb little things are GOING to happen.. Hell I'll fully admit at least once or twice I myself have done something dumb in an LFR because I didn't understand something I was told in a new dungeon wing, and I was a Guild Master and Raid Leader for a competitive progression guild for seven years! lol."
wow,3dx829,salmonman78,6,Mon Jul 20 11:36:35 2015 UTC,"Aye, and I view LFR as training you can't get from watching a video. Actually stepping in and seeing the ""arena"" and just getting a feel for the callouts from DBM(or such). Everyone makes mistakes, but it's recognizing them that sets the achievers from the beggars."
wow,3dx829,Moossiah,3,Mon Jul 20 11:51:17 2015 UTC,"This! My guild doesn't raid, so I'm a PUG raider. I never feel comfortable joining PUG groups until i've at least experienced the content in LFR. It gives me, at least, a bit more confidence at least seeing the content and callouts before i join a 'real' group. The integrated group-finder has been nice, since 6.0. I still liked oqueue a bit more, but it's nice to see Blizz incorporating that idea at least!"

Sure, I could jump in a pug after having read the raid strategies, but nothing beats being in the arena, seeing what the mobs look like, seeing what freedom you have, getting the timing of abilities right, etc. Even when I did a few pugs (I'm really casual), I could use LFR as a training dummy to practice."

When I play, I'd like a challenge, but normal (flex) isn't really feasible a lot of the time, so I'll settle for LFR. I wouldn't say I'm a bad player: my dps and healing isn't bad, and I'm a pretty good and considerate tank in my opinion, it's just hard to consistently fit normals into my schedule.

I'm in the same boat, haven't raided since Cata, too busy to devote the time to WoW that I used to, so I jump into LFR a couple of times.  I was shocked at how easy it was, and fast, and the first time I did it I was still wearing a few greens.  Dungeons are even worse.  I don't want to die repeatedly but it doesn't feel like a reward when I just show up, punch buttons and walk away.  I wouldn't mind if it took a little more time, strategy and gasp crowd control."
wow,3dx829,Duranna144,2,Mon Jul 20 18:32:03 2015 UTC,"Thing is, last time they put in legitimately hard 5-mans, the collective community freaked (Cata).  When you have a completely random group, having things like CC mandatory can destroy you.  You get into a dungeon with classes that can't CC, or can't CC the type of mob you are facing, and you are screwed.  But when the xpac was fresh, and people were doing heroics at 610 ilvl, it wasn't just ""show up and punch buttons and get a prize.""  The heroics were a good level of challenging before people simply outgeared them.  Do Mythic 5-mans though. Those you do need the CC and the strategy."
wow,3dx829,playergt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"They killed casual progression guilds by introducing LFR.  I used to run one of those in Wrath, and it was great, progressing slowly but surely and seeing the content with at least a decent amount of chanllenge was really fun.  But once they introduced LFR, most people just didn't care enough to keep raiding when they could see the raid and get some gear with pretty much no effort.  So what I'm coming at is that LFR was not needed, the people who wanted to see the content could do it even with low playtime. LFR made all those people that were interested in joining a casual progression guild just don't care enough anymore, and most of those guilds died because of that.  Right now 90% of the guilds are either ""social"" guilds (AKA we don't give a shit about raiding or anything, just join so we can have more people than any other guild just because) or the more hardcore guilds which recruit only certain classes and have some requirements that not everyone can reach.  Don't get me wrong I know this isn't the same on all servers, probably the more populated ones will have a bigger variety of guilds, but back in the Wrath days, casual progression guilds were definitely the most ""popular"", and nowadays it's just rare to see one succeed."

Thing is, though, that the LFR experience is quite different from a Casual guild experience.  It's not just the ""see the content and get gear with pretty much no effort.""  It's the ""don't need to coordinate a time,"" ""don't have to put up with loot drama,"" ""don't have to risk a douche RL kicking you because you aren't perfect or because you compete with him for gear,"" ""don't want to run the entire place, would rather just do 3 bosses, but don't want to leave in the middle of the raid or have to find a group to take me in part way through later.""  My guild was a casual-ish progression oriented guild. Nothing where we were going to be making any firsts (I think the first time we downed a boss when it was still ""current"" was Rag Normal). LFR didn't change that at all. The guild split apart due to people no longer playing around ToT time, had been around since Ulduar, and it had nothing to do with LFR.  Casual progression guilds need to have a reason for people to stay other than ""see content and get gear,"" which is the people."
wow,3dx829,playergt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:04:06 2015 UTC,"Everything you just say can be summed up as ""RL been a douche"". Your typical casual progression guild didn't care if you couldn't make it to the raid, because there was usually more than enough people to take your spot on any given day. And if the RL was being a douche, which is retarded to begin with since the point of a casual progression guild was to let people with little time or no so skilled to still progress in the game, then you just left the guild and joined another, because at the time there were plenty of options and the vast majority weren't like that.  The reason most of those guilds died was because LFR added just another level of convenience to the game. I don't even blame those people that stopped progressing, it's just hard to stay motivated when doing just another difficulty of the same raid. Doing ICC in Normal wasn't that hard, but it was hard enough to keep people with little playtime motivated enough to keep trying, it was a fun challenge for casual players, it felt awesome to finally kill The Lich King for the first time. Imagine what that would've been like if LFR was a thing back then..."
wow,3dx829,Duranna144,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:24:11 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree.  Even with casual raiding, unless you're going into something that's already old content, you need to have some semblance of progression for all the members.  Sure, if you're in a large enough guild that you can carry that one guy who only shows up maybe once a month, but then what's the difference between that and LFR? There's no ""guild"" there, it's no different from the old leveling guilds that just recruited as many people as they could.   The guild I was in had about 13 people that were regular raiders. We raided on what, at the time, was a great schedule for me, from Ulduar to the first tier of MoP. But life happens, and other priorities started to come up.  This Tuesday, I'm not feeling social and would rather play Skyrim, and on Wednesday I'm going on a date, and next week I have to get up early for work because of my promotion, so I can be there next Wednesday, if that OK with you guys? Keep that going for a few months, and suddenly I'm a tier behind gear wise, and casual or not I'm now a hindrance. My DPS is too low for us to beat the enrage timer, or I'm going OOM and can't keep the tank up.  ICC was very difficult early on, and the only reason that so many people managed to get it completely down (at least on 10M Normal) was because it lasted for a year. That wasn't the case with Ulduar, or even ToC.   Yes, LFR did add another level of convenience. But if it someone wants to raid, LFR was and is not an alternative. My guild did not stop raiding because of LFR's convenience. It stopped raiding because people could no longer devote the time to raiding. Because there is no such thing as a ""come raid whenever the hell you please"" guild, unless you have non-casual raiders carrying everyone else.  Otherwise, there has to be some semblance of a schedule (or at least there had to be), even on a casual guild, because you can't just have people come and go as they please, or you'll never progress."
wow,3dx829,playergt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:01:18 2015 UTC,"Progression in Normal was easy enough that having 2 or 3 people not attend from time to time wasn't a problem. Obviously I'm not talking about attending whenever you like to, how it worked was, there was a schedule (a pretty ""light"" one to begin with) and groups were formed, those who weren't able to attend consistently were put in a sub position and still got to raid relatively often, but that doesn't mean the ones on the main groups showed up every single time, there were so many times where someone couldn't make it for one reason or another and it was just fine.  I'm talking mainly about Wrath though, in Cata I joined a hardcore raiding guild and don't really remember how hard Normal was, but if it was harder then I see where you are coming from since it probably made the requirements to actually progress harder overall."

Getting ICC10N down was a heavy challenge for us, we raided 3 nights a week for 3 hours a night at it.  And we were small, maybe 12 or 13 regular raiders, and no subs for our two tanks (they were also the guild leaders and married, so the likliehood of them not being there was slim), and only one sub for heals (which was a shaman who would switch to heals from DPS if needed).  Having even two people gone, depending on which role, meant no raid for the night.  It was casual, in that we weren't going to kick people for not showing up or underperforming (or, in my case, passing out drunk at the keyboard mid fight), but likewise we didn't have the bodies to do what you describe.  Sure, we could have recruited more, but the entire guild save for a couple of people (me being one of them) were IRL friends and we had a really close bond.  Just getting new people who meshed with us the way we did was not an easy task."

I know I saw some of that when LFR came out.  A lot of our raiders stopped.  They were never in it to hang out with us.  They never spoke in Vent.  Some even just waited until we were in farm mode so they could get a carry through it all.  They didn't want to be there; they just put up with it to see the content."

I take lfg and raids seriously but got kicked out of my core group because I work at a gas station and random hours every week and come when called in (therefore no guild group can accommodate my time). Example I worked 2-10pm last night and had to turn around to go to work 6am-2pm. And some times are 9am-5pm or 11am-4pm,etc. and I come when called in bc I need all the hours and money I can get for living purposes. And it pisses me off that with the small amount of time I have, everyone in pugs or who pugs leaves after 2 wipes and downing the boss to 5%. I can't ever progress, plus all the long waiting for hours to get invited to a group and for one to form.  Also, some people do not have the means. They may not have a suitable computer or Internet speed to not have lag. They may have to share the computer with others. They may not have mics or headsets to chat with raids. These are key factors that having a job and making decent money is important. I understand most people who play seem to be well off with this stuff, but some people do have this problem. But it doesn't mean they don't take the game seriously. They could be trying to get these things to raid in the future."

This can be a legitimate reason, because you need some gear for different difficulties to not be a heavy weight to carry for the group. And also look it that way. They probably replaced you with someone who has a higher gear score than you. The guy with higher gear score should have a higher chance to get an invite than someone who has lower gs. It's just fair that way. The guy has put more effort into his character progress than you, so he has more rights to be in this raid instead of you. So at your end it might seem unfair, but think for the other guy with higher gear score, it would be more unfair for him, if you would get the invite instead of him."

I was in a mixture of heroic 5 man and LFR gear and some of the newer people said they did not want to carry a ""Newb"".

wow,3dx829,frogandbanjo,4,Mon Jul 20 08:49:26 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a rather ambiguous term to begin with, isn't it? There are certainly ""casual"" players who are perfectly capable of playing at a high level, but for their inability or unwillingness to eat the steaming piles of RNG-and-grind shit that Blizzard demands they eat. Some just can't get a schedule down, so even with all the solo grinding done, they can't really raid unless they want to suffer through a pure PUG experience (and then get really lucky with drops so they don't fall behind the dreaded PUG gear curve.)  However, there are other ""casual"" players whose desires and preferences push the game in troubling directions. There can be no doubt that pet battles were introduced for a certain type of ""casual"" player. Since they're (mostly) cordoned off from the raiding and dungeon game, save for the occasional rare pet drop in current-xpac dungeon or raid content, they're not such a big problem, unless of course you take the widest view possible and assume that all resources spent on pet battles are diverted from other areas. The same could be said of all the seasonal events. Sure, sometimes there are dungeon-esque or raid-esque challenges included in this events, but they're never really all that hard, and they never drop cutting-edge gear. So, unless you're worried about development resources being misspent, it's not such a big deal.  But then you have to consider that WoD's ""Facebook game"" crap is also geared towards a type of ""casual,"" player, and that's where things get serious in a hurry. A complete dearth of engaging gameplay and real challenge are being hooked into the raiding game via the legendary quest chain and cache/seal missions - and, to a lesser extent (if only because it was already halfway there,) the crafting/professions systems. That should cause raiders and hardcore players some very serious concern. In order to hook into this ""casual"" market, Blizzard is doubling down on the steaming piles of shit attached to hardcore raiding without really offering much in the way of additional hardcore content. I'll grant you that most of the raid encounters this xpac have been cool, but there haven't really been that many of them, and meanwhile, we've all been Facebooking it for extra Units of Legendary Grindy Bullshit and whatnot.  So that's where I begin to sympathize with using the term ""casual"" derisively. Of course, as usual, the derision and blame really ought to be going towards Blizzard, and not towards other players."

These days I just don't have the desire to commit to Mythic or even to a set raid schedule. I've tried taking a step back in progression but I just find myself frustrated. I still do the occasional alt raid or pug but it sucks feeling like you're dead weight because of your gear (tier and trinkets). I'd love unique high-difficulty content outside of Mythic raiding with a lesser time requirement."

wow,3dx829,MysterySteve,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:47:54 2015 UTC,"One of my biggest irritations in WoW is the claim of ""what would the casuals do without LFR?"" - As if casual players couldn't handle anything other than being spoon-fed failure-free content.

You also don't have to LFR to get the ring. You can do this by using the group finder and just going through normal/heroic raids each week(its done by plenty of people).   Using the language you used above is why Blizzard removes a lot of content. They removed a lot of dailies from MoP b/c you ""had to"". They removed profession bonuses b/c you ""had to"". Really you have no requirements to meet. You play the game however you want to play it. Yes to get the rewards there are hoops you need to jump through. This is the crux of a lot of the gameplay in WoW. It still doesn't mean you ""have to do"" it. There are plenty of people who never step in LFR.   TL;DR you don't have to do anything."

I've seen ""casual"" players who put more effort into minmaxing, into finishing content, etc. than some hardcore progression guilds require.

Someone who joins a raid, performs poorly, dies frequently, and then says, ""I'm casual"" is simply a bad player.  You don't have to play or raid every night to understand your class or raid.

There are lots of ways to enjoy the game and they are all valid.   They are indeed and all play styles are valid but due to the lack of putting that work in they are worse players plain and simple. Nothing wrong with that why would you need to sim if you are not pushing the hardest content its really not required. I only clear heroic raid content so I rarely bother to sim my character but I accept that im most likely worse than the player who sims all different fights and all different builds. Of course there are no absolutes and someone could sim all day and know their class inside out but have slower reactions but they are very rare.
wow,3dx829,subterfug,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:22:03 2015 UTC,"As an example, a DPS in a raid can go about a bossfight two ways:   Try their hardest to top meters Try their hardest to execute mechanics perfectly (reduce damage taken, focus fire, etc)   Now sims are great tools to tell you what gear/spec is ultimately the best for you so you can squeeze out a few more DPS, but if you're not executing mechanics perfectly, someone else in your raid is picking up your slack and you're ultimately making progression harder for your guild/raid group.  So when did running sims become the line that separates casuals from hardcore players? You can play for 18 hours a day and run tons of sims and boast about your gear or whatever. But you're still bad if you can't execute mechanics well. And this should be the measure of good vs. bad. If every fight was a Patchwerk style tank n' spank, then you could say that what sort of numbers a player can put up is hands down the most important metric, but it's not.  Whether you're a casual player or hardcore player, it's a completely separate issue from good vs. bad. A casual who only raids like 5 hours a week could easily perform to their full potential and execute perfectly given the gear they have. It's not hard. There are plenty of ""hardcore"" players who stop playing as much and become casuals. They don't all suddenly become bad and forget how to play the game just because they raid lesser hours."
wow,3dx829,MagicMert,2,Mon Jul 20 10:49:41 2015 UTC,"Running sims was just an example. The same could be applied to anything such as knowing your rotation having gems enchants food flasks actually working to obtain gear when not inside a raid etc. These are all things that causal players see themselves as being above (Or below?) because they are casual and don't have the time / cant be bothered to put into learning that stuff. There are some casuals who are very good but mostly they are bad and as such people has come to associate casual with bad. If you put any time into outside resources like guides etc you are not casual in the eyes of most people and more importantly not in Blizzards eyes, It really comes down to the fact that casual is a subjective term and everyone's casual is different. I raid 3 times a week clear all content on at least heroic difficulty before it gets patched and play during my spare time I consider myself very casual where as someone with 2 hours a week on a weekend to play would consider themselves casual and me far more hardcore, Hardcore to me would be leaving friends behind to join a guild that is pushing server firsts and spend ALL my time in the game or on PTR testing bosses and the likes."

And something cosmetic/useful that will exist through future expansions.  Similar gathering aspects as to what it is now but instead of all gathering the same item from a raid you're gathering class specific versions of the items.  With class specific quests in the inbetween parts.  Maybe on expansion we get a spell animation modification.  Or a change in spell mechanic effect similar to how set bonuses work.  I feel let down with this expansion's legendary.  Not the story the item.  It's a ring that will probably be replaced mid to end of the expansion that in theory won't be far off if they're doing a yearly cycle.  Haven't even gotten the ring gotta collect more tomes by the time I get it I won't have long to enjoy it.  Being a ring too I can't even show it off in the future.

wow,3dyb8t,nawalrage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:06:19 2015 UTC,"Sort of off topic, but have blizzard ever said anything more on the matter of legendaries becoming transmogrifiable?"
wow,3dyb8t,Emeraldon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:54 2015 UTC,"Well, what I had in my head was similar to how the heirloom tab was introduced you got a 'token' in that interface if you logged on to the character with item.  So if somebody has that legendary they'd unlock the token to spawn an heirloom version of that item.  The heirloom version shares the appearance and scaling stats (the unique bonus scaled too).  This idea was born out of the uselessness of the ring after this expansion.  I hate the idea of putting time into something and then not look at it twice after that.  Maybe not heirloom the older legendaries, maybe cloak and beyond.  That being said, I wouldn't mind seeing loads of alts with legendary weapons that they've spent ages to obtain and can actually show them off.  The scaling special skill the item has would be pretty cool if you could use them again. What is there to have against peoples alts having legendary items after spending significant time on their mains?  Its not like legendary items are that easy to get; you can just enter a dungeon and it drops."
wow,3dyb8t,Xertious,3,Mon Jul 20 20:10:05 2015 UTC,"Yes! I started WoW toward the beginning of MoP. While my Paladin is my main, my most played alt is/was my Warlock. Of all of MoP's content... the Green Fire quest chain was by far the most fun, for me. I grew so much more attached to that character after that quest chain. I would absolutely love this if something similar went to all classes."
wow,3dyb8t,Moossiah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:56:13 2015 UTC,I really liked the essence behind the 30 wave proving ground achievement.  I want class quest that are truly challenging. AND you shouldn't able to out ilvl it!

wow,3dyb8t,Xertious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:33:48 2015 UTC,"This would just be so good. I think I speak for all of us when I say that the legendary quest on its own isn't awful, but what really makes it shit is having to do it on multiple characters. This would keep it fresh and far more enjoyable.   They really need to focus their efforts better. Like, does anyone ever go east of Lions Den in Tanan? (Apart from the portal which you run past once). Did we need those level 100 dungons that we just out gear in an hour? You have the resources blizz, just use them wisely please :)"
wow,3dyb8t,CytokineShitStorm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:31 2015 UTC,"Well the level 100 dungeons are all heroic dungeons too, which are needed to progress into raiding for better gear.  I can't imagine it takes much of an effort to weight a dungeon to heroic."
wow,3dyb8t,Xertious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:41:59 2015 UTC,Last alt I levelled need to go into a heroic or normal level 100 dungeon twice and that was it. I'm just saying the time spent developing vs the time spent using isn't very well thought out. The jump from 600 (Nagrand and Skyreach) to 615 for lfr is all they're needed for. And now there are way quicker way to just skip that.
wow,3dyb8t,CytokineShitStorm,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:21 2015 UTC,Yeah these dungeons are available from launch where there is no raid waiting.  630 was the 'requirement' for Normal Highmall when it was released.  Lfr was released sometime after that and a wing at a time.  You needed to be mostly equipped in heroic dungeon gear to progress at all.
wow,3dyb8t,Xertious,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:34 2015 UTC,"That's actually a very good point. I didn't play the first month or two until highmaul released so I forgot that was actually a thing for most people.   The blizz devs do still waste quite a bit of time building things we don't really use though in my opinion. I can just take the cheap shot and say Ashran, gg wp"
wow,3dyb8t,CytokineShitStorm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:02 2015 UTC,I think blizzard now offer too many catchup mechanics.  They should replace this and make heroic dungeon gear scale up to each patch's base level so for 6.2 it jumps to 645.  Maybe replace items with tokens for gear.
wow,3dyb8t,Xertious,4,Tue Jul 21 15:23:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that would be great, like having a bodyguard in WoD but better, we should look more into class quests and customisation, everything about making your character better than a legendary we all have"

wow,3dyb8t,Revenchule,2,Mon Jul 20 23:00:56 2015 UTC,"I think this is perfect, and I wish I had thought of it. What I hate about the legendaries now is that it makes it really hard for me to swap classes when my raid team needs to switch up their comp. I have everything at 100, but some of them are still on Highmaul when it comes to the legendary, and I hate the feeling that I have to work on it to be viable should I swap mains.  Someone else mentioned the green fire quest in Mists, and I think that was a perfect example of something difficult that wasn't mandatory. I only dusted off my warlock alt because I loved the title ""of the Black Harvest"" and achievements. I complained about every step -- learning my rotation in-depth, learning how to use utility spells I didn't even know warlocks HAD, practicing over and over just to whittle down a few more percents.  But when it was all done two weeks later, and I stood there with my shiny new title, I felt accomplished in a way that the legendary ring and cloak never made me feel. I didn't have a heroic geared warlock, but I had still won with a little research. The same way I felt when I finally succeeded in getting my rogue's legendary daggers (that stealth through Gilneas, ughhhh). And that is something I want to see more of in the game."

wow,3dyb8t,Revenchule,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:01:48 2015 UTC,"I would be just fine if they could make more Black Harvest quests.  That quest was truly epic, challenging and rewarded with cosmetics that were really exclusive (title is only usable by Warlocks) and you could be proud to show (green fire!). And the best part was that there was a time limit to do the quest, rewards were unobtainable after and became ""legacy"" (like Scarab Lord, Atiesh, Hand of A'dal, Champion of the Naaru, etc.) adding a lot of more value to them. You could be around the city with a title others won't have and never will, with people asking you ""how did you get that title?"" ""why your Rain of Fire is green?"" and you proudly reply ""I did a class quest log time ago that it isn't in the game anymore"".  Make me able to corrupt my Shadowpriest with fel fire and becoming an avatar of Xhul'horac after a long and challenging quest that will disappear next content and making my Shadowpriest member of an elite of player that completed that quest and being able to show legacy rewards no one can obtain anymore.  That would be truly epic."
wow,3dyb8t,DJSonaSucks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:16:54 2015 UTC,"IMO FFXIV does class quests perfectly. Especially in Heavensward.  In A Realm Reborn you get a new class quest every 5 levels. They reward you with gear at lower levels and once you obtain a job (think of it as a spec) you gain abilities specific to that job. It's also one big storyline throughout the leveling experience with a climax at level 50.   They continued the class quests in Heavensward, with the player getting one every 2 levels. These are how you obtain the new HW skills for your job and in similar fashion, it's one big class storyline rather than just random quests.  I don't see how Blizzard can't do this. If SE is able to then surely Blizzard can. Honestly I think the devs need new blood. It's been the same lead developers all these years and I can't help but think they're running out of ideas."

I don't like to sound like a broken record, but we've had enough of orcs. We had MoP which had a mix between Pandarian villains (ie. the mogu & mantid) and orcs. Then we get a expansion that centers around the orc warlords. We had 4 dungeons full of orcs, Highmaul featuring Kargath Bladefist w/ some orc trash and Blackrock Foundry which was full on Orc.   I for one, am happy we actually got Archimonde in the end. Did he pop out of nowhere? Yeah. Was he completely unexpected? No.  The toy heavily hinted at Archimonde's presence. Some people won't accept that a simple toy is what's used to justify his arrival.   Also; Grommash's theme is fucking amazing. There is always 1 soundtrack that stands out from the rest in a expansion, and this is the one for me."
wow,3dyxgn,TuxedoFish,13,Mon Jul 20 18:18:42 2015 UTC,"Problem is they had already gone down the path of him being the final boss, they should have at least followed through and made it semi epic rather than jerking it away at the last moment in favour of the big bad legion guy"
wow,3dyxgn,True_OP,26,Mon Jul 20 18:43:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree - I think that Archimonde would make an awesome final boss, but they didn't handle it correctly. If he had had more of an introduction, more buildup, it could've been great.  Grommash wouldn't have been great, Archimonde as we got him wasn't great. I do think Archimonde had potential, though."
wow,3dyxgn,Razhork,10,Mon Jul 20 19:38:16 2015 UTC,Honestly when WoD was first announced I was hoping for a council fight with like all the warlords.
wow,3dyxgn,Bonerpopper,13,Mon Jul 20 20:52:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, only recently have I been considering how absolutely crazy a end fight that would be. The first legit council end boss of a raid as far as I can remember.   That I would love to see for a change. All the warlords were supposed to be important, but we get next to no interaction with them to solidify them as a threat. Like, who the fuck is Kilrogg? I've read the lore about him through websites, but he has NO presence in WoD.   The warlods were honestly mishandled for the most part. Only Blackhand got the right treatment as far as I'm concerned."
wow,3dyxgn,KTY_,4,Mon Jul 20 21:11:18 2015 UTC,"Kargath was sorta hyped, he was supposed to be this big dick dude who like 1 shots the Talon King's spirit. But no he dies as a shitty first boss in a shitty raid."
wow,3dyxgn,Razhork,2,Tue Jul 21 02:24:47 2015 UTC,"""IM THE STRONGEST GLADIATOR EVEEEER. HEY WHERE ARE YOU GOING? FIRE? AUUUGH! IT BURNS! MEDDLING KIDS!"""
wow,3dyxgn,sidewalkbutts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:13:00 2015 UTC,"Indeed, and what actually got me thinking that there could've been a cool council Warlords fight was that in the beta of WoD, Kargath was supposed to simply lose his bladehand and escape the arena.   But alas, at some point later during the beta they changed it to Kargath dying, and that's when I personally think Blizzard changed the direction of the story (aka the burning legion & archimonde)."
wow,3dyxgn,fiif,5,Tue Jul 21 02:54:15 2015 UTC,"I'm with you here. Blizzard often reuses a lot of the good/fun fight mechanics in future fights, with twists. Coming straight from SoO into this expansion, I expected a huge Klaxxi Paragon-type fight with all the warlords jumping in and out at intervals. Maybe some interaction from the sidelines."
wow,3dyxgn,Meglamax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:41:11 2015 UTC,"While I agree, that set up would have had to be dungeons or a mention in previous raid tier. Dungeons are never coming after launch again it seems and we knew what was up in BRF before launch so honestly by the time the expo came out there was never going to be any real foreshadowing to him as the final boss"
wow,3dyxgn,fiif,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"i honestly think the foreshadowing for archi was set in panda land. Wrathion has been hammering away about the return of the legion. we also know hes on dranor with no "" real "" reason. i think the sudden showing of him gets the point across that  went so deep on Garrosh we missed the warning of the legion. it 100% could have been done better but i cant say it wasn't coming"
wow,3dyxgn,thefezhat,2,Mon Jul 20 20:55:09 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from with that, but honestly the toy was better then that. Wrathioins case works very well for a full on legion invasion not some alternate universe crap. Also wasn't the real reason wrathion went to recruit the Iron horde as a defense force as he believed them more capable of stopping the legion then the alliance and the horde?  Lastly the legion was only there because we went there, otherwise that time line would for all intensive purpose not have existed and would have carried on the same as before, basically Wrathion going back was what caused a legion invasion"
wow,3dyxgn,Oxyfire,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:19 2015 UTC,"He wasn't really jerked away at the last moment. It was obvious he probably wouldn't be the end boss ever since 6.1, thanks to the legendary quest cinematic."
wow,3dyxgn,Stquencica,2,Mon Jul 20 23:59:24 2015 UTC,"I like the twist somewhat. Considering just how hard we came down on the Iron Horde in 6.0/6.1 they honestly felt like a joke.   Almost all the warlords are dead, every time they looked like they were to do something big, they get their shit kicked in and plans foiled - Karabor, stopped by a windchime ex machina. Gorgrond, just general plans foiled (I think there was a titan device or something we beat them to.) Talador, invasion of Shattrath routed by player factions, Nagrand we whooped Garrosh and the Warsong. In the Garrison campaign, we stop more machinations and take out Azuka. Then there's the dungeons and raids...  They barely felt like a threat. And the fact that us kicking their asses gave Guldan the ability to convince Kilrogg and many orcs that they needed to drink the demon blood to fight back felt really appropriate.   While I'm not in love with a demon-centric raid, I just love that the badguys literally acknowledged us as a force to be reckoned with. We've killed old gods, torn down the Lich King and assisted in stopping fucking Deathwing. You think some Orcs with fancy tanks are going to be a real threat?"
wow,3dyxgn,SpiffShientz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:59:05 2015 UTC,I remember earlier (arround BRF release) in this expansion someone saying that Grommash would not be the last boss of the expansion. And I think the information was from someone working for blizzard.
wow,3dyxgn,Razhork,4,Mon Jul 20 22:19:14 2015 UTC,"""Heavily"" hinted? Are you kidding me? Archimonde speaks one line, and the toy drops from a rare-spawn who the player is in no way told to kill. I actually enjoyed WoD, but stuffing the only lore development of the expansion's final boss into a toy, and not a dungeon, or a cutscene, or even a quest, is just flat-out lazy storytelling."
wow,3dyxgn,SpiffShientz,0,Tue Jul 21 04:41:27 2015 UTC,"Archimonde speaks one line? Have you ever actually looked the toy up on Wowhead for a change?   Here's the 9 different lines he says:    Archimonde: You have failed, Kil'jaeden. The orcs did not drink of Mannoroth's blood as you promised. I care not for your vendetta against the draenei... But their souls may still prove useful to us.   You know the deal. Kil'jaeden, who orchestrated the whole orcs drink Mannoroth's blood, failed his plan. Furthermore Archimonde believes there is still a purpose for their campaign upon Draenor.     Archimonde: We will take this world with unending strength of the Legion. The time for sublety has passed. Orcs and Draenei both bow in fealty to the Legion. Our hordes will scorch the earth beneath them. Together, Kil'jaeden, we are unstoppable.    Fuck this puppetmaster shit. We'll go full leeroy on Draenor.    Archimonde: Lord Mongrethod, rally your forces. The time is close at hand. Our orc pawn readies portal into the heart of Auchindoun as I speak.    You might remember Mongrethod from a quest. Some Draenei chick summoned us into another world as a trap. Here we meet Mongrethod. Big pit lord who apparently destroyed some worlds. Quite the mean guy. ""orc pawn"" refers to Gul'dan(Gul'dan tasked Teron'gor with Auchindoun though). Archimonde's plan proceeds as expected.    Archimonde: It is time, Lord Mongrethod. Gul'dans work is nearly complete. Tonight we will FEAST!   Not a lot to say here. Plans are proceeding.    *Archimonde: Azzakel, you will be our vanguard. Lead the charge. you will herald the end of this world.  *   This one was what I caught onto initially. Azzakel is the infernal legion boss you meet in Auchindoun. Basically he'll herald the end of this world(The legions arrival). By this point we knew the legion would be all up in our face.    Archimonde: The draenei's souls will empower us. Any living orcs and draenei will become our puppets. Nothing can stop your might. Pour into this world... And feast!   Delicious souls. Not much to get out of this.    Archimonde: Yes... Auchindoun will be ours. The portals are nearly ready for our full invasion. Rise, legion, and turn this world to ash!    I mean cmon. If you haven't caught on by now, I don't know what to say.    Archimonde: The sky will rain fire... The oceans will be filled with blood... DRAENOR WILL BURN!   Dude really hates us. He's getting pretty feisty.    Archimonde:* Do not fail again*   This is actually a easter egg afaik. If you use the toy near Archimonde in Mount Hyjal raid, this is how he will respond + do a cry emote (when I tried it out, he didn't cry).   Conclusion: Archimonde's arrival was not unexpected at all if you actually cared enough to read into this kind of stuff. The decision to replace Grommash with Archimonde was not made over night and I'd expect it to have happened somewhere just before WoD beta and after Blizzcon of course. They probably read into the feedback upon Grommash as final boss etc.   Should Blizzard have done more to hint Archimonde's arrival? Yeah. A single toy doesn't quite do, but at the same time, I'm glad we got something to speculate about. I personally saw a lot of people use this toy in particular during LFR, dungeons pugs, waiting around etc, so I had seen a lot of the quotes."
wow,3dyxgn,Mozbey,4,Tue Jul 21 05:30:00 2015 UTC,"My bad, I didn't know there were nine lines. That being said, nine lines still isn't jack shit in the grand scheme of things. I absolutely do care about the lore, it's more-or-less the only reason I've remained subscribed to WoW for this long.   I've always hated the ""speculation"" argument, because it's not intended speculation. It's speculation born out of a lack of information, as opposed to a fair amount of clues spread throughout the entire expansion.   Again, you got me there. Nine lines, my bad. Still only nine lines from a toy. Look at MoP's rich lore and tell me this is on par."
wow,3dyxgn,jazzyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:19:10 2015 UTC,"Really wish that buildup had been in quests, or dungeons.   I don't even know what this toy is called. I don't know how to get it. I mean, I could go and look all this crap up, but what the hell is the point of a story driven game that doesn't tell the story through the main accessible avenues of gameplay?"
wow,3dyxgn,fearkillsdreams,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:14 2015 UTC,"wat?  mop had these for bosses: beasts/abberations (70% of ToT), mogu (MSV and some ToT), Trolls (MSV and some ToT), mantid (HoF), sha (Everything), orcs (SoO), and then ToES was basically fish guys, water spirit, sha  encounter design in mop was really, really diverse. i'd hardly call orcs as having even a 30% participation rate in raids"

wow,3dyxgn,Artanis12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:21:59 2015 UTC,Is it possible they planned Archimode all along? Telling us Grom wast he final boss just to be wowed that much more when Arch stepped out of no where.
wow,3dyxgn,Lorki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:06:43 2015 UTC,"I followed WoD to death since its reveal all the way to its downfall. I feel as though Blizzard were trying to sell Grom as  Illidan in BC. If you look at leaked content before WoD was revealed and the trail of clues of stuff that was scrapped you can essentially piece together 2 supposed order of events.   The achievement that had everyone wondering was ""Time is a flat circle"" with the statue in your garrison. It comes from the idea that no matter what happens, your destiny will happen. In this version we would probably see Grom forced to drink the demon blood by Gul'Dan/Legions hands and he would become a boss without his free will. Another possibility at the time was he voluntarily drinnks the blood as sort of a ""backed up into a corner idea"". Seeing us destroy Blackhands Factory, along with the Garrison Campaign missions being the equivalent of espionage, Grom would have lost everything and would do anything that it takes. In this scenario we probably would have gotten Hellfire Citadel but with Gul'Dan as the final boss.   Remember when Blizzard said all of the Warlords would be fought at some point? When Kargath originally RAN away after you beat him instead of dieing?   Archimonde was planned all along but his interferance would probably be after Grom drinking the blood. Or maybe he makes Grom drink the blood.   I played a dota game in the middle of writing this and lost my train of thought.  tl;dr Blizzard initially made the expansion feel as a cooperative effort to demolish the Iron Horde. It always felt like Grom was doomed to repeat our timelines fate. It would suit him better than his current rendition. Hes a mass murderer who prides himself in Orc tradition. Except hes all friendly now and both the alliance and horde are just laughing off his tyraid as a fluke. The real Grom would've died a warrior's death."

I mean, consuming the heart of an Old God is totally different than consuming demon blood! /s  It would be an exact reenactment of MoPs final boss. I'm happy they went with a thrown together redemption story line.  Long live Flip-flop Grommash!"
wow,3dyxgn,GrayMagicGamma,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:41:23 2015 UTC,"This. I think they threw that out there as a sort of joke seeing as people have been complaining on too much Orc for a while. But it backfired and people actually thought it was a good idea.  Then the real idea showed up and people are upset. Personally I groaned when I heard that as I knew we would be seeing LOTS of orcs the whole expansion. I love my orcs but lord, sometimes we need a break."
wow,3dyxgn,Keskekun,-11,Mon Jul 20 22:20:51 2015 UTC,Which in essence is the same character
wow,3dyxgn,Peach774,3,Mon Jul 20 18:35:09 2015 UTC,"Not at all, and we already fought Archimonde once in WOW and once in WC3."
wow,3dyxgn,Keskekun,-3,Mon Jul 20 21:34:43 2015 UTC,Well can you tell one difference
wow,3dyxgn,Peach774,2,Mon Jul 20 21:42:44 2015 UTC,"yea, they look and sound totally different. One went bonkers during mists, the other drank demon blood in warcraft 3(again) and killed mannoroth, he also has hair."
wow,3dyxgn,Keskekun,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:49:53 2015 UTC,But they are the same character. They just wanted to use Grom so they made a carbon copy of him and made Garrosh.
wow,3dyxgn,Peach774,2,Mon Jul 20 21:59:54 2015 UTC,"no..... Grommash had daddy issues, he had no honor, or nearly none, he didn't care about the horde, he was forced to be in charge of the horde and garrosh was crazy, while grommash wasn't. Also, you do realize garrosh has been in the game since wrath of the lich king right? Thats like saying two people look similar so they are clones. Children look like their parents."
wow,3dyxgn,cliftonixwow,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:34:17 2015 UTC,"That is absolute bullshit. Infact he even executed a high ranking Horde member for not showing enough of it. You seem to forget how Garrosh is introduced. As a person that wants to bring the traditional values of Honour to the horde, he feels that Thrall is guiding the horde in the wrong way and want to go back to what it was in order to protect it.  He then gets corrupted because he was seeking enough power to be able to lead his new horde and prevent its desruction. (Stop me when you've heard this before) He then leads his clan into destruction because he made a deal with a demonic force that he thought he had to do.  The only part Grom got that Garrosh didn't, was the redemption. Otherwise their story arcs are identical"

wow,3dyhnm,xNYKx,4,Mon Jul 20 16:22:44 2015 UTC,"Does anyone have any advice on Heroic Archimonde? My guild has been working on him for a couple weeks now and our best attempt is 9%.   We seem to hit a wall in the last phase between 25-15% every single time. The combination of the shackles, demonic feedback, and rain of chaos is overwhelming and people just flat out die. It's gotten to the point where I don't even know what we're doing wrong.   Here are our logs from two nights of attempts. I would appreciate it so much if someone with experience on this fight would share some tips on how you got through this last phase.   Full guild: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/HvdZXKNAWMaLJzPx#fight=3  Skeleton crew (~15 people): https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/MPHTVcZ1N8A7w2Lj#fight=15"
wow,3dyhnm,chrrie,5,Mon Jul 20 16:12:13 2015 UTC,Didn't look at the logs since I'm on mobile but one of the things I would suggest is send your first group in make it as quick as possible checked the logs quick just for numbers reference which would be about 9 and 9.  The first group wants to kill it as quick as possible and get out then depending where you're at as far as damage on the bosses goes you'll either want to delay or push to 25%.  More than likely delay for group 2 to come out as he'll probably be around 29-30% when they go down.  When they come out lust and stay still pop a CD and tunnel into the boss and mark infernals and start dragging them in one by one.  The biggest mistake I see people do is try and move out of the rain losing a ton of damage when that time could be spent tunneling the boss for that period with a cool down and no movement.  It really doesn't hit too hard.  Other than that stay spread for demonic and you should be good to go.  Group 3 will be a repeat of group 1 but they'll have a lust to get out even faster and then depending on your damage sacrifice the two lowest for group 4 and a tank and kill him.  May have to do group 4 if you feel like you can't finish in time.
wow,3dyhnm,Nagello,2,Mon Jul 20 16:22:57 2015 UTC,The meteors always hit close to players. But if I understand you correctly if you stack with all you will just get hit by one meteor?
wow,3dyhnm,harmlangwerden,2,Tue Jul 21 09:00:15 2015 UTC,"For our first kill (22-man, 5 healers), we sent in 8 people for groups 1 & 2 and sacrificed lowest dps on groups 3 & 4. Our 4th group was supposed to be a taunt to get banish, but the timing was off so we sacrificed our 2nd tank and the feral druid tanked the last bit with HotW.  Aside from figuring out banish groups that work for your raid, everyone has to remain calm during the hectic last phase. Stay spread for demonic feedback, be organized with infernal taunts so they never overlap, and don't break chains at a rough time."
wow,3dyhnm,zalix44,7,Mon Jul 20 16:50:38 2015 UTC,Is Blizzard going to stick with us as the main character and continue calling us commander?  Does shadowmoon valley have an alternative leveling zone and is it possible to ignore all the garrison stuff until 100?
wow,3dyhnm,SofaIsLife,2,Mon Jul 20 16:16:23 2015 UTC,I don't think SMV has an alternate leveling area assuming it's the same situation as horde you kind of just have to power through it.  I know off the expansion release we saved up 25 MOP dailies from all around and it got us like 70% of the level so I guess that's possible especially with BOA gear but it wouldn't be done in a day of you only use those.
wow,3dyhnm,Nagello,3,Mon Jul 20 16:28:32 2015 UTC,"Going to get back into playing my warlock (90). I know demonology got nerfed out the butt in 6.2, so is affliction the way to go?  Edit: Thanks guys!"
wow,3dyhnm,holaimaaron,7,Mon Jul 20 16:49:55 2015 UTC,It depends on the fight it seems. We have multiple warlocks in our guild who play afflic for some fights and then swap destro for others...  None of them are playing demon any more though :P
wow,3dyhnm,Dasangrypanda,4,Mon Jul 20 17:13:53 2015 UTC,Any spec is fine for leveling and early raids.  Aff pulls ahead in t17 gear but destro and demo are generally more versatile and not far behind.  With t18 bonuses destro is the go-to.

wow,3dyhnm,holaimaaron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:09:22 2015 UTC,I currently have a 675ilvl lock so take this with a grain of salt...but I tryed out both affliction and destro and destro got slightly better dps(your results may vary). That being said affliction is much more mobile than destro. My suggestion is to try keep one for you off spec and main whatever one feels right to you
wow,3dyhnm,warpedmaggot,4,Mon Jul 20 17:22:47 2015 UTC,"Hey! I subbed a month ago and I've been loving it. Right now I'm lvl 100 and the thing I'm wondering is just, what to do? I do the dailies in Tanaan and take care of Garrison/Shipyard, and I know I could do dungeons and/or raids(when my gear is better I guess), but I feel like I'm not good enough to do raids or dungeons atm, is there something I could do to kind of get better before I start doing dungeons and raids more? I've been reading guides online but the couple of dungeons I've done at max level did not go too well :("
wow,3dyhnm,DidItFloat,4,Mon Jul 20 16:17:22 2015 UTC,"You haven't even been able to run normal dungeons? That's a case of ""I don't know how to play my class."" What class are you? Have you looked up class guides? Can you do Silver in Proving Grounds? Are dungeon mechanics the issue, or is it DPS?  If you're US-Horde, I can take you into Normal Skyreach as my tank OS, give you some practice - I can solo it anyways so you won't have to worry about pissing off people who spent 30 minutes in queue."
wow,3dyhnm,mods_ruin_games,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:33 2015 UTC,"If by normal dungeons you mean the ones you can do anytime you want, whatever gear you have, those have went decently, but not perfectly. I currently am playing a Brewmaster and I did look at some guides. The thing is I kind of get overwhelmed about the whole aggro-ing thing. For DPS/Healing I played a lot of  Shaman and that went well, but I am only lvl 52 on it so the game's really easy at that point.   I feel like my problem(although I probably have others) is mostly just the way to act when you're in a group as a tank, what to expect of healers and that kind of stuff. I am US-Horde, don't know if the server matters, but I'm on Zul'jin. That would be great actually! Read some guides, but never had somebody actually tell me what I'm doing wrong."
wow,3dyhnm,DidItFloat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:04 2015 UTC,"Monk tank eh? I have a lower leveled brewmaster and I have noticed it's harder to keep aggro with it than on my pally or dk. I'd also advise you not to queue for LFR - tank is the one role that actually has challenge at all. You should get a grasp of heroic dungeons before jumping into that.  But yeah, server doesn't matter, everything's cross realm aside from Mythic raiding pretty much. I'll pm you my btag when I get back in a few hours. Given you're a tank, I'll hop on as ret/dps and we can do Auchindoun for practice (just keep threat off me, I'll DPS and should be able to keep you healed as well if I switch around my talents - dunno that I can solo Skyreach as DPS and I don't want to compete with your threat.)"
wow,3dyhnm,mods_ruin_games,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I found tank to be such a challenge compared to DPS. Ohh ok I wasn't sure because I knew some things were limited to people of the same realm. Sounds good though! Thanks again.
wow,3dyhnm,DidItFloat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:24 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, if you've been doing Tanaan you should be getting decent gear upgrades from the quests/tokens there. If you don't want to raid/dungeon too soon you can do Looking For Raid which will get you some more gear chances and get you accustomed to raiding, without all the stress of normal or higher raiding. Really hard for the group to fail in LFR and it'll get you some experience in those group settings without any mistakes affecting the whole group"
wow,3dyhnm,TheRealirony,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have been, my current ilvl is 643. I'll try LFR then, thanks a lot! Been learning to tank and I guess even though it's more stressful than normal PvE in Tanaan, I'll actually learn how to tank in LFR."

wow,3dyhnm,someenigma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:03 2015 UTC,"I just started up a few months ago myself and ran into the same problem when I hit 100.

Which then leaves me in a similar predicament where I'm max level, and that's cool, but I have zero idea what to do with my time now and I spend most of it setting up assorted weak auras or tabbed out on youtube. I haven't even set foot in Tanaan yet because to be totally honest, I don't actually know how to start there."

wow,3dyhnm,C0gn,2,Mon Jul 20 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"How do I get started with pvp at 100. I haven't played since WOTLK so I'll throw out a couple questions if someone can answer.   Do Rated BGs give Arena Points just like Arena does? Is there still a cap on Arena Points per week? Do Arena Points still reset every week? Are honor points still a thing for bgs, and is that the fastest way to gear up to start pvping? With all this cross server nonsense, are battle groups still a thing? What are the big professions nowadays? Also, what is this Ashran place I keep hearing about"
wow,3dyhnm,Necbrah,2,Mon Jul 20 18:51:06 2015 UTC,"Ashran is the PVP battleground that came with the WoD expansion, designed to be like an AV 2.0 - a constant back and forth battle of large armies and big clashes. However, many believe that the design has flopped, with Alliance dominating the main road as Horde goes around scraping out PvE-esque events, as well as forcing PvPers to go into Ashran for Versatility offpieces. You can give it a try by heading to Warspear/Stormshield and heading into the battlefield - the entrance is right by the conq/honor vendors."
wow,3dyhnm,Andaho,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:55:38 2015 UTC,So if I'm horde am I fucked?
wow,3dyhnm,Necbrah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:09 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a lot tougher to win Ashran as Horde, but it's certainly doable. I'd just try and do a few events; if your side is getting slaughtered, maybe try a different time or join a premade? I haven't touched it in ages, so I'm not entirely sure how it works now, sorry! :x"
wow,3dyhnm,Andaho,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yes Yes there is. But if you haven't played since wotlk, your arena point (conquest) cap is going to be a lot larger to allow you to catch up to everyone.  If you mean your cap refreshes every week then yes, it does, on Tuesday. But yours won't refresh until you hit your cap the first time since you have the catch-up cap to reach Yes honor points are still for bgs. You can also get honor in Ashran (out door PvP). If you're alliance, ashran queue will be long but you'll win almost every time. I've heard a lot of people say you can gear faster in ashran if you get into a good group.  Battlegroups are still a thing, but they're much bigger and cover more servers.  Professions have become very very easy imo. You can craft any WoD pattern with a profession that's level 1. Also, you can have profession huts in your garrison that can make the easy WoD patterns even if you don't have that profession on your character.  JC and Enchanting aren't as lucrative as before because gem sockets are much more scarce now and enchants only go on maybe 4 pieces of gear now. I'll tell you what everyone told me, pick whatever profession you like, they're all pretty much the same level of useful now as far as ""big"" goes"

I feel like if its me vs 2 or more I am fucked. I can't really solo anything because I pretty much get wrecked. I am almost always in the bottom of DPS when i do dungeons and when i did raids back in pre-WoD time. Any tips to keep DPS up? If i need to post my character i will when i get home from work."
wow,3dyhnm,RAVENS17d,3,Mon Jul 20 19:24:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not very good at the game, but I have a 100 assassination rogue. I have about 674 ilvl, which isn't great, but I've gotten much better than my original trash state when i first started playing again.  When I'm trying to clear out regular mobs (not instances), I tend to use leeching poison because it gives decent upkeep of health.  When rupture ticks on an enemy that has deadly poison on it, you get a bit of extra energy from the tick (I wanna say 10). It's pretty useful. Keep rupture with about three combo points on regular enemy depending on your dps. From there, with a bit of energy, you can cast recuperate for even more heals.  Also, evasion is great for reducing damage, but you have to be facing your opponent. Can't dodge from behind. Cloak of shadows is good for big magic hits, but those can usually be interrupted with kicks anyway.  One thing about rogues and the game in general is your item level plays a big role sometimes. If you're coming into WoD with gear that wasn't so great in Mists of Pandaria or whatever, you might struggle a bit.  This is pretty unorganized, but I was really frustrated two months ago when I re-subscribed. I saw that I was doing horribly and getting killed embarrassingly fast while everyone around me mowed through mobs. Read up a bit on Icy Veins or whatever (I know it gets a bad rap, but really, it's usually better than nothing) and try to learn about your class. PvP is always a fun way to experiment.   I'm not great, but I've managed to have higher DPS with like 665 ilvl than a good number of people rocking 680 and stuff.   Really, though, like /u/AmputeeBall said, 100 is where things change and you can really adjust because the playing field is a little more equal. Like I said, I'm really not a very good player. But practice and research significantly increased what skill I did have."

wow,3dyhnm,MadRaymer,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:23 2015 UTC,"definitely need more information. I'd recommend playing as is until 100, then you can do some dungeons and see where you stand. Another good trick is to do LFR or a normal raid once you get a little gear and log it so other people can help analyze what is happening. I don't know assassination very well, but with most specs you will see that there are buffs or debuffs to keep up as best as you can, which is much more easily tracked with a log of a fight."

Also i wish more people did the MoP raids because i want to do the Seige of Orgimmar..."
wow,3dyhnm,RAVENS17d,2,Mon Jul 20 22:03:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I dont really know rogues well enough to help with that, but once you're 100 you should check out Icy veins, or Summonstone. Both should have good guides for how to play the rogue specs.   General tips:   Bind all commonly used (if not just all spells) spells to a keybinding. Things like poison and other out of combat stuff you can easily leave off. Keep in mind Shift, Control, and Alt can be used as modifiers to keep the number of keys your left hand needs to reach to a bit more manageable.   Read a guide, use the priority or rotation suggested to the best of your abilities and then use warcraftlogs to determine what you can improve on. Using addons like Weak Auras 2 and Tell Me When work really well to help you use things as they come off of cool down. Especially when you add sound effects. These sites also have Stat priorities, these can really help your dps.  Never keyboard turn. Go ahead and unbind A and D from turn and put strafe there, or keep strafe at Q and E and then rebind A and D for spells. In many cases you can safely unbind S (walk backwards), outside of tanking it doesn't have much practical use. If you need to run with one hand and your mouse hand is busy eating cheetos then you can still use the arrow keys.  Use CDs during Blood Lust. Pop a dps potion right before combat, it will come off of cooldown during the fight and allow you to pop a second one."
wow,3dyhnm,AmputeeBall,2,Mon Jul 20 22:29:14 2015 UTC,If you're level 91 you might not have gotten WoD-level weapons yet which make a huge difference over anything but raid-level mop stuff.
wow,3dyhnm,Haptics,2,Mon Jul 20 21:46:53 2015 UTC,"Looking at your current gear, it's not good even for MoP standards. Just level your way up to 100, start getting some proper gear together and see how you do. I always recommend Combat for levelling, it's the best AoE spec, especially when you unlock unlimited Blade Flurry. But as you're lvling, dps shouldn't be a concern, just have fun with it and start working on our dps when you reach lvl 100."

wow,3dyhnm,Miragoat,5,Mon Jul 20 19:50:31 2015 UTC,"Keybinding will increase dps significantly. You need your mouse for so many other things and mousing around simply isnt as quick or accurate as hitting keys on a keyboard. 1 hand on a keyboard has 5 digits to work with, mousing around only has 1 and it gets no physical feedback from the items you're moving over and clicking on. You'll be surprised what the difference is.  You can get to tanaan without any of the legendary quest ring done so far, you just need a level 3 garrison and start the shipyard quests.   Though if you are looking to do the legendary quest on multiple characters, after you complete a step on a character all subsequent characters have a slightly higher drop rate compared to the 1st character through."
wow,3dyhnm,AmputeeBall,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:42 2015 UTC,"Yes. Keybinding will make your dps nearly skyrocket. It is impossible to do anything competitively if you don't have the majority, if not all of your abilities bound. Also yes, you need the shipyard on each of your alts."

Those things should be cooldowns like a Warrior's Recklessness or a Shaman's Ascendence; something that needs to be used but not something that has to be used very often.  Yes, you can.

While post-level-80 a Ret can burn down 1 or 2 things quickly; Prot will survive longer, and have the AoE to take down far more enemies at a fairly good rate. Earlier on, Avenger Shield hits like a truck and 1-shots multiple enemies at once, while Ret is still trying to build up Holy Power to use TV on 1 enemy.  Also, if you're comfortable with the Tank role, Tank queues for dungeons are almost non existent. I'm leveling a Guardian Druid, right now, and at level 30 i still have some gear from the first few quest lines because the dungeon leveling has been going so fast!"
wow,3dyhnm,Moossiah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:33:16 2015 UTC,"Even if it's because of the insta-queue as tank, I don't think it holds true any more...  The ""optimal"" leveling experience as it is now, in full heirloom gear, is to quest and queue for dungeons at the same time, never repeat a dungeon you've done before if you can help it.  As DPS while leveling my alt I'd say my average queue times were 5-10 minutes, that gave me time enough to do a few quests, do a dungeon w/ quests, and come back to turn in the other quests I'd finished. This strategy seemed to yield 2 levels per dungeon queue.  It's also worth noting that you should be able to level at ALMOST the same speed on any toon with any spec now, even healers, since Blizzard went to great lengths w/ WoD to ensure that all current and past content is friendly to leveling in all specs. The only exception to this rule may be the ability of some classes/specs to easily solo group content like elite quest mobs, while some can not."
wow,3dyhnm,Dasangrypanda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, leveling as a tank is quite easy. At low levels, you do as much or more damage than a DPS, but can also pull 10 mobs at a time and survive."

I've heard Socrethar can be cheesed fairly easily with the right strategies but I know Gorefiend is typically next on the recommended list.  By way of further information, we have a strong ranged and healing team but a lot of newbie melee who can just barely handle interrupts and are pulling low DPS numbers. Any advice would be appreciated!"

wow,3dyhnm,Diffog,3,Mon Jul 20 17:09:23 2015 UTC,"Gorefiend is MUCH easier than Kilrog, have your dps focus the adds 100% during phase 1, clear the rest of the adds at the start of phase 2, in Phase 2 blow every cooldown on the boss, go back to phase 1, rinse and repeat. As long as dps dont tunnel on the boss in phase 1 its truly an easy fight :D  After Gorefiend tho, head over to Fel Lord, we barely explained the fight, 80% of us had not even watched the fight in YT before, and we still killed him. He is free loot for real. Then head over to Socrethar imo. Keep Iskar for last since he requires much more personal responsibility"
wow,3dyhnm,C0gn,2,Mon Jul 20 17:18:12 2015 UTC,"With Iskar Assist, that fight is a cakewalk. My super casual guild got him to 1% before the enrage timer wiped us on our third or fourth pull on him ever last night. If we'd had time for one more pull we'd have had him."
wow,3dyhnm,love-from-london,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:24:39 2015 UTC,"Yah Kilrogg was super tough - there's just no room for error from any player. Interrupts have to be perfect, every single add MUST be slowed and downed before they reach the boss, no-one can ever forget heartseeker or miss runes, no-one can get hit by green goo. I could tell at the beginning of our last raid night that we were going to get him down, it just took ten more wipes before we finally had a perfect run where no-one fucked up!  I'm glad to hear Gorefiend will be easier - in your experience, do many adds usually make it outside? I'm trying to judge how the DPS are doing in his belly and at the moment I can't tell."
wow,3dyhnm,Diffog,2,Mon Jul 20 17:31:15 2015 UTC,"I think the comparison between Kilrogg and Gorefiend depends on what your raid strengths are. On normal, 4 strong DPS can carry that fight (or only 2-3). You don't need the entire raid to actually do their job well, when you have 3-4 people pulling 70k+ DPS (and the more gear those few have obviously the more this number goes up).  Personally as a melee, I hated Gorefiend. I had to rely heavily on the ranged and healers to do their jobs, because the fight mechanics dont really allow my class (warrior) to really carry the fight. If you have strong healing and ranged DPS, I believe gorefiend is the easier fight, but if those are your weaknesses? That makes the fight a lot harder."
wow,3dyhnm,kencaid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:46:13 2015 UTC,"Interesting insight, thanks! And that also helps me breathe a little easier, since our weakness right now is competent melee - our heals are super and our range team very solid."
wow,3dyhnm,Diffog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:19:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm, yes, many adds will get out, even if the dps down there do really good, thats why you need the dps up top to focus the adds over the boss. Generall priority is : Running constructs (they walk at first, then run), Hulk (interupt and tank swap taunt on CD is important), the healer mobs (does AoE dmg+slow), then walking constructs. There will be so many adds to keep the dps busy the boss should barely be touched.  Healers should also coodinate so that only 1 of them is down there at a time, and they should heal the mobs down there like crazy (the more healed they are, the less hp they have when they come out).  Managing the pools is also very important, people have 8 seconds to move, make sure everyone knows how/where to put them.  The fatboss video is well done and worth watching more than once as a Raid leader to grasp all the mechanics. Your first pulls are going to be attrocious as there are 1-shot mechanics, but when everyone does their job, its the cleanest kill youll ever pull off =p  GL!"
wow,3dyhnm,C0gn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:49:36 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the detailed advice! I've watched the two-minute-tips video but will definitely be watching the Fatboss one before the next raid too.
wow,3dyhnm,Diffog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:30:32 2015 UTC,"Important to note is there is no enrage timer, the thing is the pools slowly get overwhelming and take too much space, therefore the better players position the pools, the easier it is, you should be getting 3 phase 2s, killing him on the last, this is a long fight, but it's not healing/tanking intensive."
wow,3dyhnm,C0gn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:25 2015 UTC,To answer this question. Its not really about how many adds you can kill before they go outside the stomach. Its more about how much hp they have when they leave. The adds in the stomach take increased damage so typically you want to try to get them low before they escape.  Tip: The skeletons spawn from 3 different areas. I recommend having the dps split up and cover 1 area each

I've always taken as a sign that I need improvement until the other night when the druid could not make it to the raid and we replaced him with a holy pally. During that raid I did not alter my play style but my hps looked so much better. I don't know druids as well as I should so is there something I'm missing here.

wow,3dyhnm,xNYKx,4,Mon Jul 20 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"One of his other healers is disc. If the raid team is small enough to be 3-healing, they don't need two disc priests."
wow,3dyhnm,love-from-london,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:52:39 2015 UTC,"Oh shit i completely read that as a resto shaman, I am so sorry. Completely ignore me. The best way to tell why you may be under performing (being sniped or overall low damage to the raid) is with logs. I believe that simply, you have enough healing to outheal the raid damage with that set up, it will depend on overall raid size and damage taken.  Healing has a limit - damage taken, unlike DPS, not all healers can push to the max unless you're running a 'risky' composition. If the raid isn't dying and your healing is relatively low, I wouldn't worry about it too much. The main thing you need to learn what to do (the original comment) is to anticipate high damage, Chakram on Iskar, Touch of Doom on Gorefiend etc"
wow,3dyhnm,xNYKx,2,Mon Jul 20 19:06:28 2015 UTC,"Basically the disc priest is,  as one holy priest put it,  cutting in line and absorbing damage before any heals go out.  Assuming damage gets through the heal,  you and the resto druid are fighting for the remaining healing done via hots.  Resto druid has more hots than you so chances are he's getting more of the available healing done before your renew ticks.   There's just going to be fights where meters make you look bad. Unless you're a super hardcore mythic guild,  if you're killing bosses and you're ,  it really shouldn't matter if you're first or last on the meters.  Healing is healing. It's one reason I both love and hate meters.  They don't tell the whole story,  but they can still be a good indicator of what's going on."
wow,3dyhnm,biot-savart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:52 2015 UTC,"Holy priests are good when we are underhealing since we don't have absorbs and are more reactive in heals. Chances are that you're comparing your hps on fights where there isn't a ton of healing to do, which isn't fair. The disc is probably sniping a lot of heals and you and the resto druid are competing for the leftovers. I would only look at hps on high healing fights like gorefiend or kromog- if you feel panicky while healing a fight, it's probably a good fight to log and compare yourself to other healers. But don't listen to people saying that you should go disc- holy is more than viable and a good holy priest can be insane, esp on high healing fights."

wow,3dyhnm,doctorEeevil,2,Tue Jul 21 01:51:22 2015 UTC,"To get in to normal HFC groups you will probably want a 675 Ilvl. Considering that you can get gear from your Garrison, shipyard, tanaan quests and rares, LFR, timewalker weekends, apexis, AND LFR, You could be caught up in a week if you busted ass, 2 weeks if you played regularly but not all the time."
wow,3dyhnm,Dasangrypanda,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:58 2015 UTC,"20k apex for a 695 item, 60 mins/day = 10k apex, 9 items you need? = 18 days of farming to get a full set of apex gear, not including rings/trinkets because those are just bad, might as well get the ones from the AH. If you do mythic dungeons/LFR I would say it reduces the time in half. GL!"
wow,3dyhnm,C0gn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"Two weeks, give or take. You get 6600/7100 crystals a day from doing the four dailies, which depending on your luck with finding the apexis fragments that drop from rares/treasure chests takes about an hour. You'll also get your HFC LFR quest mission as soon as you get your shipyard to level 2, which gives you a random 685 tier piece from that raid. I'd recommend not buying the Baleful gear, since it drops pretty regularly from rares/elites/respawning chests and instead save for the Empowered Apexis Fragments that cost 20k apexis.   I geared all my alts in Tanaan together so it's a little hazy, but with running dailies four or five times a week on each it took about three weeks total to get them to 685 or so."

Even if Blizzard manages to keep their promise of shorter expansion release cycles and releases 7.0 in Q1 2016, we're still looking at 4-6 months of being able to fly in Draenor.  Blizzard's current stance on flying, afaik, is that you should have to explore everything on the ground initially, but flying will be available as a reward for people who've exhausted most of the outdoor content, some time after the initial release of the content."

Adding flying to the game this late is probably a good move.  It will help people level alts up,  and maybe will keep subs going until the next expansion.

Make sure to have people run over them so they don't blow up and damage the whole raid. During the Empowered phase for the runes. Make sure to have ranged run them from outside in. Typically I put a marker in the middle of the room and tell ppl to run it to the marker.  For Pound. Make sure to have a healer pop a healing cooldown. If you are still having people die with a healing cd, check to make sure they are spread at least 4 yards apart.

Normally I would just move on, but with this new chapter system I feel like I would be missing out on followers and garrison related abilities.

None of the other followers you acquire through questing are guaranteed traits that will be useful for follower bonuses in your garrison profession buildings.

Leveling is obviously a good chance to get these done.  Also, if you have other characters, they could help with the achievement. An example would be to have one character do Frostfire/Gorgrond/Spires and another one do Frostfire/Talador/Nagrand. I don't think the other prerequisites (missives/rep/treasure) allow you to split the achievement with alts, but flying will be unlocked on all characters.

The big difference is going to be that by the time you get to the end of the questline in each zone, you'll have fewer quests clumped up in the same area, and you won't have bonus quests either. Personally, I like leveling by doing quests 1-2 difficulty levels below me, because you can just blaze through them and AoE down all the mobs in an area. I've leveled 3 toons to 100, and my most recent one I did the entire chain all the way to the end of Gorgrond, skipped Talador, then did the entire chain from Spires of Arak to Nagrand.

In my opinion, grinding dungeons is mind-numbingly boring and I only do it when I'm REALLY bored of questing (like when I'm putting my 8th toon through Wrath content).  What you want to do is an entirely personal decision - is your goal to get to 100 no matter the cost, or are you more interested in enjoying the journey there? If you just came back, I would recommend enjoying the leveling zones (especially if you haven't played since BC), they're some of the best content WoW has to offer.

You can use your blood tap charges at any point you have more than 5 if you ever need a rune.    Regarding putting blood tap with frost strike, this completely negates the strength blood tap has over runic empowerment. Blood taps strength is its high level of control and consistency.

""MogIt"" lets you try on pieces and preview how they would look on you without actually owning them, you can make sexy sets by looking at what you like."

I'm leveling a priest, now 91, and I've been holy up to the point where I hit draenor and actually had to do some quests without a group of meatshields killing things for me.  My rotation is basically just open with mind blast, keep my two dots up, mind flay until mind blast CD is up and then use the combo finisher (devouring plague?) when I have three orbs. It seems like really terrible single target dps compared to the other characters I have.  Would disc be better for quest grinding?"
wow,3dyhnm,zoetrophic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:15:43 2015 UTC,"I'm working my way through leveling one of each class and priest has definitely been the most tedious so far. The talent Clarity of Power, which buffs Mind Spike/Mind Sear/SW:D by 40% and makes surviving against world mobs a lot easier, doesn't unlock until level 100. You also won't necessarily get the Enhanced Shadow Orbs and Enhanced SW:D buffs until level 98, and both also significantly contribute to making the leveling process tolerable.  I found that Glyph of Mind Harvest (gives you three shadow orbs the first time you hit an enemy with Mind Blast), Glyph of Reflective Shield and the level 30 talent Body and Soul help with surviving. The level 60 talent Psychic Scream can also help a great deal when you're facing packs of mobs and only want to deal with one at a time."

wow,3e1xdd,dribblerbang,2,Tue Jul 21 10:36:44 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the hell out of Redridge. It's a ridiculous, over-the-top, Rambo/action movies in general reference. iirc, there's more quests in the Burning Steppes that continue with the NPCs. I'd also say Westfall, because it was the Barrens equivalent for Alliance, and continues a lot of the Defiance Brotherhood lore. Duskwood also has some interesting questlines. From what I recall, it's fairly similar to the vanilla version, with another hub or two added in that focus more on the worgen. Those are the zones that I find the most enjoyable of the Alliance zones and the most quintessentially Alliance. They're also the human zones. If a particular race interests you, I'd recommend going through their zones. You'd get more lore interesting to you that way. Beyond what I've mentioned, the 1-20 zones, and maybe Ashenvale, you won't find much Alliance-specific lore, just smatterings of quest chains/hubs."

As you level, a lot of zones will be ones you used as hord anyway, so I don't know how much of a difference it will make after level 20 tbh.

While not wholly apt, saying you're surprised they haven't built in Master Plan's functionality is like being surprised they haven't built in a rotation bot for you.  Master Plan effectively ""plays"" that part of the game for you.

The new tier also manages energy by increasing your total with a 2 set and returning energy to you under certain circumstances with the 4 set.

Going back to vanilla without meeting stones, with minimal flight paths, with having to transverse multiple zones just to get to the dungeon, only to have one person give up halfway there, or get something else to do, or have a friend come on and they want to run with them instead...  Yeah, no. The social aspect of dungeoning was a drop in a sea of untold wasted hours. You can still be social in WoW, I do it every time I play (I add people from other servers to my friend list if I like them. Surprisingly, this works just like it did back in the day). Not the game's fault."

The social aspect is still there, people just choose not to engage in it and then complain there's no community. I've made tons of cross realm friends."
wow,3dwyzw,cyberjus,3,Mon Jul 20 16:57:53 2015 UTC,"The meeting stones in vanilla were just a basic queue though, they did not get summoning until BC. Hardly anyone on my server used them, if you wanted a group, you went to Ironforge and spammed.  Even for raids I remember everyone running to the entrance. There was no way you were going to summon 40 people. Summoning was rare for the guy who needed to respec or repair because they cost those warlock crystals which did not stack. Even then, you could not summon in instances, so the warlock and 2 people had to run out of the entrance.  Then, hopefully you weren't on a PvP server because the entrances to raids were usually a gank fest."

And then you just keep hopping between those three, inching your way up to 50.  Ah, nostalgia...  Also, speaking of zones that had nothing in them...  Azshara.  Man.  Beautiful fucking zone.

This is why I was super excited when the 1.8 Silithus revamp happened. I was at like 57 with pretty much no quests left, and the Silithus revamp added a new hub which just barely got me to 60. (I think I had to grind mobs for the last half of 59.)"
wow,3dwyzw,Flatus_,51,Mon Jul 20 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"Objection! I'd like to look at this from different point of view. Back in vanilla MMO-experience was vastly different than nowadays. Exploration and working for your rewards without them being given you so clearly, and often having to make your own fun, with other players, made leveling experience as well totally different than what it is now.  Having quests spread out around the world around lvl 40+ was actually brilliant back then and it played very strongly to the mmo-experience back then. You had to go around the world to finish quest-lines, and that felt pretty good if you followed the story at all. Because you got this immersion that hey, it's a world, and being in a world requires traveling and seeking objects hidden deep in the quest-lines and weird places in the world.  It was an adventure that required effort. Questing wasn't only a tool to get to lvl 60, but huge part of the experience.  There's lot of things that could've been better mechanically, but otherwise it worked well back then. But as we know, times change."
wow,3dwyzw,ragout,17,Mon Jul 20 07:36:07 2015 UTC,"Valid points about different nature of how MMOs worked back then, especially considering how the standard of the day was the insane grindyness of games like Everquest and DAoC.  However, that still ignores /u/morgoth95's point of some zones (most notably Silithus and Azshara) had almost, or in Silithus' case absolutely, nothing in them other than some mobs to pointlessly grind. Not that Silithus is really all that much better these days, IMO.  And if you want to bring up the story element of questing, look at just how many questlines and stories in various zones just stopped unfinished prior to the Cata revamp.  It wasn't that Vanilla questing was from a different era (though it certainly was), it was that in so many places it was obviously incomplete or half-finished."

Furthermore in Eve as soon as players get near each other in anyway decent numbers the node goes into time dilation mode. This means ingame seconds can take up to minutes in real time. With the space combat system and queueing commands like in Eve this is possible. In a realtime action game that is WoW (effectively) it would be unplayable.  They might have opted for a mechanic like EQ2 has. A zone gets a new instance (and physical server in the background) as soon as more then a threshold of people are in it. This wasn't possible without zonelines back when WoW was released but might be possible now with all their fancy phasing tech.  Oh and also, don't forget Eve has 50k on their server. If WoW only had 10 servers they would each have over 1 million players at the peak of WoW (WotLK). Just throwing more hardware at it doesn't cut it anymore at a certain point."

The only good thing that I can see that came out of that was I was able to buy my mounts as I was leveling. 100g at 40, 1k at 60, and I even had my epic flying before hitting 80.

So many new experiences, and the sense of wonder and amazement at the environments. I remember when I finally got into the beta, doing the quests in the Night elf starting zone, and there was this owl outside of the enclosed starting area. It was neutral, but I had no understanding of that at the time, that yellow meant neutral. I had missed some quests and was trying to rush to explore, but I died like 3 times to this owl. I was a hunter, and was thinking I could engage it from max range to give me longer to hit it. It wasn't until I was getting ready for another try and some guy just ran straight past it that I was like.. what, so I kinda creeped up and around it, uncertain of why it didn't attack him.  It's dumb, but so many of the things I did while levelling and in vanilla were dumb. If there was a game I'd love to do over with no memory of it, it'd have to be vanilla wow.

The AQ instance opening event, where the entire server had to work together to open the gates is still the best event ever in WoW. I do not understand why it was a one time thing, every single raid should be done like this. Silithus farming leading up to AQ opening is still the best pvp I have ever experienced in an MMO . if Blizz wants to fix World PvP, just fucking copy what they alread figured out in Vanilla . . bring the server together into a zone in the month or two leading up to a Raid opening and allow everyone to go crazy, as a bonus everyone learns about the lore of the upcoming raid."

You had the casual players just enjoying the fact that now there's an easy and repeatable way to earn reputation with all the factions, slowly earning their way towards cross-faction mounts.  Yet even with all these different types, you all somehow felt like you were on a team and working towards this huge thing.

I remember being on the boat to theramore and when the game finally finished loading, we where on the way back to menethil harbor.  Oh and the 5m rollbacks after a crash where fun as well!"
wow,3du316,_QWERTY_YTREWQ_,3,Mon Jul 20 07:30:18 2015 UTC,"I have a better story about that town, I had a thing for interesting faction stuff and decided, before the whole AQ thing was announced, to declare war against Moonglade and get full hated.    The first time I did AQ20 I could not speak to any of the support but they did not attack me and it took a fair few weeks before I could pick up any quests.  God help me if I ever went in that town..."
wow,3du316,sastarbucks,9,Sun Jul 19 17:40:59 2015 UTC,"Well that and the fact that it was well into Vanilla when the wiki type websites started cropping up. People didn't know about ""item X"" until someone they knew found it or they found it themselves. There was a sense of wonder that just isn't possible with the dataminers today."
wow,3du316,Beevo,5,Sun Jul 19 17:50:26 2015 UTC,"I am not sure what you mean by datamining, but I didn't find that WoWhead ruins the Vanilla experience at all, and other things seem pretty optional to me as I don't recall looking up anything datamined that wasn't WoWhead related."
wow,3du316,Revenchule,2,Sun Jul 19 18:45:08 2015 UTC,And there was a better community because people had to ask each other how stuff was done since there were less resources.

wow,3du316,MizerokRominus,6,Sun Jul 19 21:15:28 2015 UTC,"And vanilla was still 100x more convenient than eq. My best mmo memories come from a time that preceeded pve or pvp; it was the age of player vs developer,  when companies actively tried to stop us from having fun playing their game."
wow,3du316,TimesAreTough,2,Sun Jul 19 20:01:36 2015 UTC,"And vanilla was still 100x more convenient than eq.   I find this very interesting. Blizzard always wanted to make WoW casual, yet we think of the old vanilla as super hardcore. Perhaps Blizzard themselves doesn't actually know how to make WoW as great as Vanilla, they just sort of happened to strike a great balance between hardcore and casual because of the way the MMO landscape looked back in 2004."
wow,3du316,al_rainbows,4,Mon Jul 20 21:24:50 2015 UTC,I remember fondly getting people together for the deadmines and going for special items- that's when I got hooked
wow,3du316,Jkizzle9,9,Sun Jul 19 20:46:42 2015 UTC,"This. Sitting outside the instance and /yelling for sometimes hours to get a group together was, strangely, one of the best parts of the game. It was a pain in the arse and took a long time, but it meant actually socializing with the people in your slowly forming group and discussing the game and how to beat the dungeon together. I still remember fucking around in the mine carts with my first deadmines group while we were waiting for the rogue to show up.  I had a sort of sad realization when I was levelling an alt the other day that I'd gained more than 60 levels via dungeons and I couldn't remember a single person that I had grouped with."
wow,3du316,Hudston,10,Mon Jul 20 00:17:36 2015 UTC,"I'd willingly throw my hat into the ring and say that nothing will or has ever trumped the experiences surrounding EverQuest in its 'vanilla' (referred to as classic) period of the base game and the first two expansions.  I played both, and I REALLY enjoyed WoW for quite some time as well, but the younger more lost in the world version of me in EverQuest has much fonder memories for me. When I came to WoW from EQ, everything felt so much more polished and streamlined, and the dungeon instancing was pretty great as well - as that was one of my favorite parts of EQ, Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion which introduced instanced dungeon crawls. WoW definitely took what EQ did well and improved upon it or implemented it, and revamped the things it didn't do so well."
wow,3du316,gakule,4,Sun Jul 19 18:34:31 2015 UTC,"you know that most veteran mmo players, so long before WoW i.e. EQ, AC, UO, M59 found already vanilla WoW 100x more convenient and stream-lined than anything they ever played."
wow,3du316,ProudToBeAKraut,3,Sun Jul 19 18:53:14 2015 UTC,Well yea but how are the people who started MMO period with vanilla wow gonna feel superior now that you brought that up?
wow,3du316,wakawaka86,6,Mon Jul 20 14:52:38 2015 UTC,"This. I just cancelled my subscription today because honestly, I've just stopped logging in, but WoW is and always will be the best game that I ever played.  Rose-tinted glasses or not, I sincerely doubt I'll ever have that feeling again and that's really sad. I, like a lot of people here, just have this extreme nostalgia for when the game was something new and unique, when MMOs really took off, when everyone was talking about it and when I was just at the right time in my life to really be involved and immersed in the game.  I don't care what the game is now, or what my opinion is about how it has changed, that invitation is responsible for some of my fondest memories and I can't be anything but grateful for it.  Now, if Blizzard could kindly stop fucking it up that'd be great! ;)"
wow,3du316,Hudston,2,Mon Jul 20 00:04:04 2015 UTC,I ended up with 2 since my first came broken.  My second also came broken but I just kinda gave up.
wow,3du316,SaracenS,67,Sun Jul 19 16:37:52 2015 UTC,"It was a true masterpiece. You could feel it the second you opened the game, especially in context at the time because of what games you were playing alternatively, this just completely blew everything out of the water. It was so finely polished, fine tuned, well-thought out and engineered that it changed PC gaming and video games in general forever.  World of Warcraft is the Michael Jordan of MMORPGs, every popular MMO will be compared to its standard in the future."
wow,3du316,braunheiser,69,Sun Jul 19 17:54:08 2015 UTC,I honestly feel a deep sadness when I think about it. People who played in vanilla through tbc/wrath witnessed the pinnacle of mmorpgs and maybe gaming in general.   The game came out at a time that was really just the perfect storm. There is a 0% chance everything will line up again as perfectly as it was for the first couple years of WoW.  We who played during that period experienced something so special. And I'm thoroughly thankful I was lucky enough to have started playing when I did.
wow,3du316,lauxen,18,Sun Jul 19 19:19:09 2015 UTC,And no other game will ever provide a similar experience to early WoW years. We're spoilt basically.
wow,3du316,Systral,11,Sun Jul 19 20:42:37 2015 UTC,"I dunno about that... Though for something like that to happen again it would have to somehow completely redefine the genre, like WoW has in a big way."
wow,3du316,DiscardedBeefNugget,7,Sun Jul 19 21:01:45 2015 UTC,Yes.  But as for mmorpgs we are.
wow,3du316,Systral,7,Sun Jul 19 21:08:19 2015 UTC,"Nah. There are so many new technologies being developed that we don't even know how gaming will look in 50+ years. Augmented Reality Games area already pretty fun. And imagine using something like a hololense to turn your entire home into a garrison or even a single player dungeon.  But since people don't always like active games and prefer the 'sit and play' style, we may even be able to see things like neural networks using nanowires, inserted into your brain at birth like all humans, and you can just connect right into the game...   That said, if an AI called Morganna approaches you, RUN AWAY."

wow,3du316,Hosseh,36,Sun Jul 19 16:45:34 2015 UTC,Try a vanilla server. I just stared one and after two days I am level 15. Its a blast!

wow,3du316,HansGrenze,16,Mon Jul 20 15:33:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know why blizzard can't get in on that action. There seems to be a large population of people that would like to go back and relive Vanilla/BC/WotLK era.  If I could have the game locked to those expacs, I'd be 100% more invested. Bonus points if they keep the sexy new updated character models.  I missed out on doing the raids and such when they were relevant (asides from Kara) and I would love to go back and do it like it was meant to be done."
wow,3du316,__Gojira__,12,Sun Jul 19 22:00:27 2015 UTC,"I'd pay a couple extra bucks a month (really, like $2-3) to have access to servers from each xpac. So you'd log in and choose Live (where we currently are), PTR, Classic, BC, WotLK, Cata, MoP."

wow,3du316,__Gojira__,4,Mon Jul 20 00:44:34 2015 UTC,Because most people hang around for a week then quit when they realise it's a million times more clunky and slow to do everything.  Private servers offer a good nostalgia refuge. But nostalgia can't tide you over alone.
wow,3du316,Llaine,3,Mon Jul 20 03:26:31 2015 UTC,What do you mean by vanilla server? There's a server for original world of warcraft pre burning crusade?

wow,3du316,HotLikeSauce12,6,Sun Jul 19 21:31:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the community also progressively got worse over time. Remember when you had to reroll if you ruined your server reputation?  One guy on my server in vanilla rerolled his warrior 3 times because of that lol."
wow,3du316,nintendobratkat,7,Sun Jul 19 21:22:55 2015 UTC,Lol yeah i actually do. Every server had that one guy in trade chat everyone hated
wow,3du316,Hosseh,2,Sun Jul 19 22:06:23 2015 UTC,I rerolled on another server because of that. And it wasn't even necessarily my fault. Turalyon-EU Horde was just full of assclowns.

wow,3du316,Dcc626,30,Sun Jul 19 18:18:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to disagree. I always thought I was losing Wow interest because I was getting older, and all that nostalgie wouldn't ever come back, because of that. Boy was I wrong. Just go back and play vanilla and you'll know what i'm talking about. Yes, vanilla will feel really weird compared to what the game is now, but the feeling of accomplishment is just outstanding."
wow,3du316,klubnjak,3,Sun Jul 19 18:45:43 2015 UTC,"That's because in the current game there is a massive lack of accomplishment - oh boy you never completed highmaul/BRF? don't worry - next patch it's obsolete and just uhh - skip it, here is better stuff for free to help you along.  --Yes there still is a feeling of ""yeah we did it"" but it's nothing like it used to be.  I remember doing Karazhan while other guilds did SSC/TK - but when i completed it - it was amazing for me. Right now the mentality is, if it's not current, than it's junk and not worth it. Other guilds were doing SSC/TK but Kara was new/exciting for me, in the new system - Karazhan would of been skipped completely by this point."
wow,3du316,Daffan,3,Mon Jul 20 01:32:37 2015 UTC,"I played on a Classic server last years during the SoO draught before WoD. Two and a half weeks later I stopped. Been there, done that, half the game is broken from a balance and systems standpoint."
wow,3du316,BoJackSin,46,Sun Jul 19 22:44:06 2015 UTC,There's some of the odd but intriguing events seen in that trailer that never made it into the game.  A stone titan and some worgen in the Stranglethorn arena? Was this originally meant to be something like the tournament in wotlk?  Some cultists in a circle channeling magic at an orc in Stormwind Castle?  Maybe these were just put together for the trailer. But they're still kinda neat.
wow,3du316,necker_cube,53,Sun Jul 19 16:05:56 2015 UTC,A stone titan and some worgen in the Stranglethorn arena? Was this originally meant to be something like the tournament in wotlk?   They probably just threw some models into the Arena and scripted up some fights for trailer purposes.
wow,3du316,Paddy_Tanninger,5,Sun Jul 19 17:16:55 2015 UTC,STV was one of the first zones made I think so it makes sense. Other trailers from alpha featured STV and Westfall a lot.
wow,3du316,manbearkat,6,Sun Jul 19 23:45:14 2015 UTC,"While you're probably right, Blizzard has shown a habit of throwing together random groups into weird ways. It's kinda fun to think up the random circumstance that'd force Titans and worgen to fight together."
wow,3du316,necker_cube,10,Sun Jul 19 17:26:41 2015 UTC,I think the worgens/titan in the gurubashi arena is just for showoff in the trailer. Can't see why they'd be there.
wow,3du316,Dunified,4,Sun Jul 19 17:13:11 2015 UTC,"Ironically, they used screenshots from this trailer for the original box art, including the titan in the Gurubashi arena - likely because Uldaman wasn't finished yet, but they wanted to feature a titan fight in the box art.  A lot of the game wasn't complete in 2003. Many models were just re-built from WC3 and ported over to the WoW engine (albeit, a very optimized WC3 engine variant).   It's too bad there's really not much that can be said of the game at this point in time - no real info on what was in place. I've spent time going over what had leaked, and identified several bits and pieces of earlier versions of the game, but nothing concrete - aside from the art panel that Blizz had last year at Blizzcon.   One of these days, I'll have to post my findings in their entirety over at r/hiddenwow."
wow,3du316,akspa420,133,Sun Jul 19 22:44:57 2015 UTC,I would like this trailer re-made for WoD  Instead of all the epic scenes you just see someone in their garrison by themselves clicking on menus and queing for instances.
wow,3du316,neutrolgreek,41,Sun Jul 19 16:35:36 2015 UTC,Or it has garrison followers doing the epic scenes and cuts to the commander sitting in his garrison.

wow,3du316,XMATIC_4,3,Mon Jul 20 13:24:03 2015 UTC,As much as i agree with you nobody is forcing you to do missions or queeing in your garrison.  If you want you can actualy fly out and do stuff.

The memories man, the memories."
wow,3du316,SaracenS,10,Sun Jul 19 15:22:01 2015 UTC,I was playing Asheron's Call and tried out Asheron's Call 2 which I didn't care for.  So I got into the beta for World of Warcraft.  I played a Night Elf and I remember the first time entering Darnassus and the capital city title appears with Alliance at the bottom row with the music.  Than it hit me that World of Warcraft was going to be special and will be the next MMO for me.
wow,3du316,captain_william,3,Sun Jul 19 17:07:39 2015 UTC,"Aw man. I miss Asheron's Call. I think it did the social aspect of MMOs better than any out there.

Way back in vanilla, this track played on loop on the login screen.  The song that starts at 52 seconds in the trailer would be A Call to Arms. The part from the trailer starts at 1:11, but I like the whole song. This was my favorite Warcraft song until Invincibile on the Wrath OST."

Little did I know that'd I'd play the game almost non-stop ever since. Have to admit I loved vanilla a lot more than I love the game nowadays though... probably because it was new and leveling was fun and you weren't 2 shotting everything."
wow,3du316,Drayenn,9,Sun Jul 19 22:54:35 2015 UTC,"If there is one thing I wanted at WoW nowadays is a sense of environment progression, like in throne of thunder could be a good example. I want to login and get surprised that everyone is ahead of me and leave me behind. I want to see something that I miss when I logoff.   The war effort really makes you feel that, you sleep at night and when you wake up you really wanted to know 'alright hwos our progression? my guild probably farming lots of mats when I fall asleep'. Nowadays you feel like a singleplayer. You have nothing to lose if you dont login. You dont need to follow anything. There is no sense of hype, an urge to login and see something new await you because everyone has something for themselves and getting it first means nothing since everyone can do that once they do something in a period of time . If you make something for server or to open something, or to spawn something and everyone rushing there (I have that feeling on the isle in 5.4 forgot the name). I have no complain about class or mechabic, its the least important thing about me and forgot the lore,gameplay is my priority."
wow,3du316,hell_razer18,3,Sun Jul 19 18:27:34 2015 UTC,How would people feel about WoW classic? You sub to the regular game but there's a sever that has the og game on it? They follow a set calendar and do the update like it was relaunched all over again.   Then when the hot a date for an expac you can choose to transfer your character over to that new server or stay on the original one.
wow,3du316,matter1317,4,Sun Jul 19 17:54:02 2015 UTC,Blizzard has said it at least a few times that they would never do this. People have been asking for it since Wrath.

wow,3du316,matter1317,4,Sun Jul 19 19:13:41 2015 UTC,Blizzard changes their mind about a lot of things.  At some point in the future I'm sure Blizz will release vanilla servers.

Now there are multiple GY all over every zone and outside each instance."

The reason I stopped was because I didn't have the TIME necessary to put into the game that it needed in Vanilla.

wow,3e1yw5,SlainAngel,2,Tue Jul 21 09:49:59 2015 UTC,Buying the Base game will give you all content up  to WoD. Then you just need to buy the WoD expansion.   I recommend buying the base game and just having fun taking your time to enjoy all the content as your first play through will be your most enjoyable and most memorable levelling experience so make the most of it.   When you get to 90 buy WoD as you'll be experienced in playing your character. WoD also gives you a lvl 90 boost so you can boost a new character.   The choice is yours though. If you don't want to experience all the content and are just interested in end game stuff then buy WoD to start with too and use your lvl boost to get to 100 asap.

Yeah, combat is rather terrible single target, especially when compared to assassination/subt. Both assn/subt are viable substitutes when you aren't cleaving; subt is better pure single target, but assassination is better at 2-3 target cleave (not that there's really a need for such in HFC fights).

You should really only use combat in fights where atleast some adds will pop up at any time because marked for death actually increases your DPS by A LOT if used correctly. I play Gorefiend and Kilrogg Deadeye (for example) as a combat rogue where you could actually think any other rogue spec would do better, but because I maximise my Marked for Death usage I do a pretty good job.

If you enjoy getting really deep into characters until something more appealing comes along, then you should probably keep doing that. If you don't enjoy it, that's when you should change your behavior.  As for not wanting to touch old characters, keep in mind that it's never going to be as difficult as it was the first time you really got into them; you still have all that knowledge, it just takes re-acquainting yourself with them to bring it back. I recently decided I really wanted to get the Double Agent achievement, so I got on one of my very old Alliance toons (a Paladin), a character I hadn't touched in years, and within probably an hour it felt like I'd never stopped playing it. Probably the only other time I've had as much fun levelling a character is when I went through on my Hunter. Probably my favorite part is seeing that something that used to piss me off about a certain class has since been changed or removed; I love that feeling."

It hinders me really enjoying end game content like pvp or even raids becuase I don't invest the time into those classes. And then they just end up by the wayside until I take a break from the game. I think the last expansion I was able to fully enjoy was wrath and that was when I found my warlock and loved playing it. Now though I can't stand it

I had the same problem when I was trying to play all my characters at once (garrison, tannan, raids etc.), but I gave up on that and only log onto my main to do the garrison stuff and don't really care about the others.   I am now leveling alliance characters for the next expansion, 3 characters on 2 alliance servers each and when I am done with that I will drop the sub until the next expansion hits."
