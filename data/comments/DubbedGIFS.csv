Getting banned from /r/creepypms after insinuating perhaps a girl ought to know better than to post on Craigslist casual encounters if she didn't want nudes/dick-pics coming to her email. I was promptly banned for ""victim shaming"" and the admin never even entertained the idea of reversing the ban, but just went on a power trip rant like her whole life had been leading up to that moment."

Also that sub was far from just creepy dudes. Go there, ""bro"", take a look around and you'll see that half the content is women using dirtier/shadier hookup social media apps and then acting shocked at what they receive...without considering what said apps or sites are used for.   Now does that justify sending dick pictures unsolicited via any means? No, not really. Does it mean you should go into a situation with your eyes open, realize what app/platform you're using and not be surprised if you receive sex content on a sex app/site? Yes, yes it does. To those people I would quote your frat boy ass and say ""How completely lacking in self-awareness can you be?""

But regardless, having simple, easy to read, unobtrusive captions is a good thing. Showing off with animations and fancy fonts doesn't actually add anything. Good design comes from knowing when to hold back.

DubbedGIFS,35bycs,Alexm920,3,Fri May 8 22:59:03 2015 UTC,Could someone give me a quick explanation as to what she's meant to be explaining? I'm new to reddit. lol.
DubbedGIFS,35bycs,Tsufuro,6,Sat May 9 01:48:21 2015 UTC,"shadowbanned is done by reddit admins, not subreddit mods, and is site wide. what will happen if you are shadowbanned is you will keep posting and commenting like all is well, but no one will ever see anything you post. it's meant to keep spam accounts from just making new accounts if they get banned. but sometimes actual users who are not doing anything bad get caught up.   /r/amishadowbanned is a place you can go ask if you suspect you are shadowbanned. or you can just log out of your account and see if you can fine any of your posts.   hope this explained some things!"

DubbedGIFS,359zgm,LittleHelperRobot,3,Fri May 8 13:00:14 2015 UTC,"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World:       Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a 2010 comedy film co-written, produced and directed by Edgar Wright, based on the graphic novel series Scott Pilgrim by Bryan Lee O'Malley. It stars Michael Cera as musician Scott Pilgrim, who must battle his girlfriend Ramona's seven evil exes, who are coming to kill him.  Scott Pilgrim vs. the World was planned as a film after the first volume of the comic was released. Wright became attached to the project and filming began in March 2009 in Toronto. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World premiered after a panel discussion at the San Diego Comic-Con International on July 22, 2010. It received a wide release in North America on August 13, 2010, in 2,818 theaters.   The film finished fifth on its first weekend of release with a total of $10.5 million.   The film received generally positive reviews from critics, but it failed to recoup its production budget during its release in theaters, grossing $31.5 million in North America and $16 million internationally.   The film has fared better on home formats, becoming the top-selling Blu-ray on Amazon.com on its first day of sale,  and has gained a cult following.
