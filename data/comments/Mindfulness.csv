Mindfulness,3e2rbu,Skycakes,3,Tue Jul 21 16:26:53 2015 UTC,I feel like a good diet is only possible when I'm not depressed. When I feel good I can take care of myself and eat a healthy diet. When I'm depressed I don't have the energy to shop or cook for myself so I just eat cereal or clif bars.

Mindfulness,3e2rbu,fragm,3,Tue Jul 21 23:30:56 2015 UTC,"Medication isn't the boogie man, nor is it the cure all. It was explained to me, and has been my experience with PPD, that meds just make the lows not so low. Therapy, exercise, socialization, diet are all necessary. Mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy are two tracts to take, also, simultaneously or separately.   Good luck on your journey, for a journey it definitely is."
Mindfulness,3e2rbu,UnderwaterDialect,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:12:09 2015 UTC,"Hi there,  So, in regards 'no meds', that's just something that's personal to myself. I think meds can be amazingly beneficial and a very positive addition to peoples lives, but for me, not so much - I often found they made me feel either emotionally numb, or artificially high. And regardless of how I felt, the warped thought processes were still present. For me, it was the thought processes and habits that needed to be addressed, not the amount of dopamine my brain was or wasn't spitting out.  Funnily enough though, not taking meds has ended up leading to my own personal mantra: 'Don't forget to take your meds'  Meditation/mindfulness  Exercise  Diet  Sleep.  However, I will say that in the beginning, meds were very helpful for me. They just were not a long term solution, and in the long run (we're talking over eight years of meds) I found them detrimental to my overall mental wellbeing - it might be different for you though. By being on this sub, you're definitely heading in the right direction :)"
Mindfulness,3e2rbu,veltrop,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:58:18 2015 UTC,"Just for another perspective, I never wanted to go on any medication and have been suffering from depression and anxiety for around 10 years. I finally went to the doctors and have been put on citalopram and for me it has made a world of difference. It's only been ~4 months but I now feel as though I can take the other steps i need to take so I can live more functionally. It's purely a personal choice to go on meds or not but they are just a stepping stone and not a solution. It's just that for me I needed them to bridge the gap between exercise, therapy etc. Also I am pretty lucky that the first tablets I was put on have worked for me as other people may have to try a bunch before they find one that fits."

Mindfulness,3e15be,Nachomonkey36,2,Tue Jul 21 03:54:56 2015 UTC,"I think that's a great question. Here's how I started to answer it, which I hope helps you:  What part of your value system is driven by emotions? Mindfulness will help to reduce the amount emotions affect your thoughts. So, whatever part of your conscience is driven by emotional feelings could be reduced.   As a side thought, it seems to me that some of what we consider to be values are given to us by other people, and we adopt them as our own. I grew up Catholic, and a lot of those teachings are meaningful to me because people I cared for taught them to me. In a completely non-emotional evaluation, though, I can see why they're important (because people I care for taught them to me) rather than them being innately, fundamentally right.   That gives me clarity in choosing, if I care to, what I do consider to be fundamentally right. I work at that regularly, and have ideas about it. I'm tempted to tell you what that is, but I guess I'd be doing that to convince you to agree with me. It would be better for you to separate the right from wrong in your own time, on your own terms.  Good luck with this, and thanks for the question. It really stimulated some thought for me."
Mindfulness,3e15be,mrCasual,2,Tue Jul 21 04:52:30 2015 UTC,"Being mindful helps you understand your body, sensations and emotions, mind and thoughts. Understanding as in seeing through the workings of all you are and are not.  Because of that, when a thought like 'I should apologize' comes to mind, being mindful will help you understand why that thought appears, what brought it about. And with that I don't mean the story on the events that led to the feeling and thought of regret and remorse, but instead all that is not the events itself. Your value system, the one of the other party involved, your sense of discomfort of pain in the other caused by something you did, even the look in the other persons eyes, [edit:]how your senses and emotions responded to that[/]... This helps you understand how all is linked and intertwined and how you play an important part in the happiness of everything and everyone effected by your actions.  In understanding you will gain insight in your motivations and intentions and your system of values and other dogmatic input in your daily movements. This insight will help you become more mild and friendly towards your self Ã¡nd towards others because you will come to see there is no difference between you and the other.  Also: check if the thought of apologizing is valid :) Who knows what good you bring the other by simply apologizing for what you did wrong."

Mindfulness,3e15be,anpeneMatt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:25:20 2015 UTC,"Right or wrong are labels we attach to things and events according to our will and beliefs. There are always as many right choices and actions as there are wrong ones so in my view mindfulness is about acknowledging this fact and moving past it. Work on getting to the core of your questions, understanding their roots and after you've managed to do that contemplate on whether taking action is the right choice."
Mindfulness,3e15be,angryrika,2,Tue Jul 21 11:27:55 2015 UTC,"When my conscience get's overly active (i.e. when I suffer a lot because of some past mistake) and I notice it as opposed to being pulled around by it, that's mindfulness.   For example, I may forget to unload the dishes. This gets my dad pissed, and so if I remember that I was supposed to do it (but didn't), I feel like I made a huge mistake, with a sort of sense that I'm a bad person. Not being mindful of this, I'd just proliferate on and on: ""I'm such an idiot"". But with mindfulness, it'll stop: ""Hey, this is a lot of suffering. We all forget about things once in a while..."""
Mindfulness,3e2cdw,artist_of_hunger,2,Tue Jul 21 12:32:53 2015 UTC,"This thing is developed because of the misconception that the mind should be or become calm while meditating. Meditating is just sitting and observing. If the mind is calm, observe the calm mind. If the mind is restless as fuck, observe the restless as fuck mind.  Meditation does do something though. I wear an activity tracker with a heart rate monitor. I find that my heart rate drops dramatically during meditation, much more drastic than when simply asleep. In normal rest my HR is some 55b/m. In sleep it is around 45b/m. I've seen drops while meditating to as low as 37b/m.  So yeah, I do calm down while meditating, but no, that is not the main objective and you should not strive for it to happen. If it does happen non the less, cool. Just be sure you were observing the proces."
Mindfulness,3e2cdw,SteadfastDharma,2,Tue Jul 21 13:17:27 2015 UTC,"The idea behind Muse is a little different than that -- it's really designed to help you notice when your mind has drifted away from the exercise.  When your mind is focused on your breath, the winds in the environment are calm.  When your mind wanders, the winds pick up, which cues you to notice your mind has wandered and then to bring it back to the exercise.  It's a bit like rumble strips on the side of the highway, it gives you a gentle signal that you're drifting and helps you notice when that's happening.  We're working on more elaborate guidance that will help people use Muse as a tool for inquiry and will reinforce what you've talked about there (the non-judgemental awareness of your own mental state.)  Source: I'm one of the founders of and Chief Product Officer of the company that makes Muse."
Mindfulness,3e2cdw,Franks2000inchTV,4,Tue Jul 21 13:40:27 2015 UTC,"From your site:   While you meditate, the headband uses brain-sensing technology to measure wether your mind is calm or active, and translates those signals into guiding sounds. When you're calm, you'll hear peaceful weather sounds. When your mind wanders the weather will intensify and gently guide you back to a calm state.   The key of meditation is that you learn yourself to observe how the mind wanders off and how to come back to your breathing or what ever it is you use. If you guide this observing and noticing externally, if you make it happen outside yourself, you take away the learning to recognize in which state your mind is."

Mindfulness,3dzifg,ddtoz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:20:35 2015 UTC,"I think if you are interested in practicing mindfulness and you get carried away by thoughts or imagination when you listen, you should practice to return to the current moment every time you detect it.

Mindfulness,3dzifg,anpeneMatt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:42:18 2015 UTC,"It largely depends on your goals. If you aim to boost your performance in the exercise and are unable to pick any other time during the day for your mindfulness practice then reading a book might be a disruption. But if you have the possibility to delegate half an hour or more a day towards your practice of mindfulness then by all means do listen to a book while exercising. Exercises, endurance exercises in particular can be easily done without significant conscious involvement which gives you the opportunity to almost be absorbed by the book while staying physically active. Plus your level of comprehension is greatly elevated as a result of exercising. The book isn't an escape unless you make it one ;)"

Shifting away from clarity of mind, peace and calm to increased productivity and burnout prevention. I think it's a very valid point.  I think it's also fair to point out that if you do something as part of a corporate training seminar, you're rather less likely to pursue it at home.

This practice was taught (at least in the Buddhist context) with the notion that intention is more important than action.  I actually think it's an interesting misinformation we operate under that meditation came from Buddhism. Obviously it was practiced for centuries before the historical Buddha was born, and in a variety of other spiritual teaching contexts. Clearly the author has more misinformation since she believe that Buddhism's roots are with Zen, which came to Japan 1,700 years after the Buddha's death (and came through China, where Chan started 1,100 years after the Buddha's death)."

I believe what you personally can gain from this image is to stop ruminating. accept what has happened and let it go. let your mind clear it on its own rather than sit on the same thoughts over and over and driving yourself crazy. I had to teach myself the same thing after getting out of a very long term relationship, but once I accepted my path with him was over and to let go it made it a lot easier for me to harbor no negativity towards him, myself, and our relationship.

Mindfulness isn't about stopping yourself from thinking so much as being aware of what you are thinking and what you are doing and how the two connect.  It's an organic process, not a forceful one - if you ask me.   In other words, let it sit, let it congeal (or separate) and see what clarity you might find afterward.

Mindfulness,3d3mxc,daddydearest_1,2,Mon Jul 13 14:24:35 2015 UTC,"Same suggestion.  I recently read a book called The Organized Mind (great read, if anyone is interested) and it talked about how our minds, when we want to remember something, basically take the effort to create a feedback loop for that thought so that it cannot escape.  Problem is that this feedback loop also drains our focus.  The suggested solution was to write these things down.  I got a small molskine notebook 7 months ago, has helped enormously.  Once it's written down, my brain relaxes & essentially gives the resources back to whatever my main focus is."

Eckhart Tolle TV: I fear my life will fall apart without thinking. -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c78svZaKRRo  The challenge in my experience is that it's much easier said than done. My mind wants to cling to ""important"" thoughts. What I'm practicing at the moment is to follow Tolle's recommendation and move from thinking into what he calls presence. One technique I use is to focus on how I feel and then the thinking stops since my attention is moved away from thinking into feeling.  But then what to do with thoughts that actually are important? Is it possible to just drop them instead of storing them as you described it? Yes, it's possible to let even important thoughts drop away since they will pop up again automatically when they really are needed."

The idea of impermanence, of things or thoughts, is an important one. Sometimes, we need to just trust that the truly important thoughts, the ones that will make a difference for us, will stay and those that leave us are in the past and no longer matter.  Now, that said, I do really love mindful journalling for integrating learning from meditations. I tend to use penzu.com to post them as I like to keep them locked and be able to reflect back on some things but many people even like a paper journal.

Mindfulness,3ctszb,AndersLindman,2,Fri Jul 10 18:44:50 2015 UTC,Numbness?  Like your arm falling asleep?
Mindfulness,3ctszb,SayWhatIsABigW,2,Sat Jul 11 03:54:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, feelings like that but usually hidden from conscious awareness. In my experience at first it will be pains and tensions discovered in several places inside the body with mindfulness practice where I have focused attention on how the body feels. Only after repeated practice will the hidden numbness start to be noticed. And after much more of that kind mindfulness practice both the tension and the numbness start to dissolve and a feeling of release and aliveness is experienced. That's what I meant by how the practice can be nasty in the beginning, because it's often unpleasant at first to become aware of the subconscious and hidden tensions and numbness."
Mindfulness,3ctszb,987f,2,Sat Jul 11 04:35:11 2015 UTC,What makes an emotion or mental state positive or negative? Your labeling of it makes it so. Where does one emotional state end and another begin? Your labels of your state makes it so.
Mindfulness,3ctszb,987f,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:52:22 2015 UTC,"I wrote that I experience more negative emotions than positive emotions. I meant that if I would draw my up and down swings of emotions on a graph the midpoint of my curve will be below zero.  By negative emotions I mean those that feel unpleasant. And I believe there is a natural purpose for this. Negative emotions are like warning signals telling us when something is out of balance in us.  Numbness is very dangerous for our health and if we have a lot of numbness in us that is unrecognized, the nervous system needs to produce negative emotions in an attempt to prevent too much numbness. In severe cases people may be so numbed down subconsciously that they consciously or unconsciously seek situations where they can get angry. The problem is that the anger is only a temporary relief of increased numbness.  Why does the numbness start to build up in the first place? Because of too much perceived need for protection. As Bruce Lipton has explained, cells can either be in growth or protection. When cells are in protection they are walled off from the rest of the cells in the body. And if this goes on for too long the biological tissue in the body starts to be numbed out, often without us even recognizing it.  In this video Bruce Lipton explains how cells react to their environment: Nature, Nurture, & the Power of Love - Conscious Parenting (part 2 of 2) -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP0U94xghec"
Mindfulness,3ctszb,clothes_account_,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:40:10 2015 UTC,"You are making very unsubstantiated claims. Your perception of an emotion as negative is colored by the label that it is so. If you accept all emotions as they are rather than rejecting then and labeling then as negative, they lose their power over you."
Mindfulness,3ctszb,987f,2,Sat Jul 11 16:28:58 2015 UTC,"Say you've conditioned yourself for decades to categorize experiences, and now you're suffering because of it. Realizing that ""an experience is positive or negative because you label it as such"" is crucially important, but is it enough to end your suffering? Probably not enough on its own, at least not until you've prepared your mind to adopt it.   I will give you that saying ""numbness is very dangerous for your health...the nervous system needs to produce negative emotions to prevent numbness"" is probably unsubstantiated, and rather just his interpretation having worked through it first-hand. It's a warning that you may encounter numbness, which might be valuable to some.  The main point that is worth focusing on is that people are conditioned to categorize experiences, which leads to suffering, and meditation can be used as a tool to counter-condition that habit. And that it's possible to run into ""hidden numbness"" that Anders talks about. Does any of that seem invalid?"
Mindfulness,3ctszb,clothes_account_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:25:19 2015 UTC,"Each ""negative"" emotion is useful in its own right.  Depression is useful for problem solving, though some people get stuck on a problem and rather than seeking outside help, go through the same thoughts on loop without solving the problem.  Anger is useful for exerting your will onto the world.  Frustration is useful for you to step back and take a new look at the problem from a different angle.  Envy and jealousy are useful for motivation.   Fear is useful to avoid damaging yourself, and gives courage the ability to exist.   Shame and guilt are useful for one to conform into the social fabric of their community.   I wouldn't label these emotions as ""negative"" though modern human culture has deemed them ""bad"" for whatever reason."
Mindfulness,3ctszb,glassescontacts,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:32:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, they can be considered useful. No one thus far has said that these so-called ""negative"" emotions are useless. All I've said is that labeling emotions sometimes CAN lead to suffering, and that meditation is one technique to use so that you don't have to repeat the habit of labeling/suffering.   Can you consciously decide to non-judgmentally accept say, jealousy, but still use it for motivation? I don't even know, but that would make for an interesting discussion."
Mindfulness,3ctszb,987f,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:57:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is really true.  How can you say that a depressed or anxious mental state is not negative?

Mindfulness,3ctszb,glassescontacts,0,Sun Jul 12 18:54:02 2015 UTC,"Depression is useful for solving problems.  Anxiety helps your evaluate your options and estimate risks. Some people have issues with their anxiety leading to poor decisions, but that's not the fault of the emotion itself,."

Mindfulness,3cr8lp,sanchit_khera,2,Fri Jul 10 03:16:10 2015 UTC,"There's some deep logical problems here. There is no creator, only evolution. Insecurities exist because from a young age, we are surrounded by people identifying with their thoughts, acting out of impulse, and thus the deep unconsciousness and unawareness that  thoughts are transitory appearances in consciousness, rather than ""mine"", the lack of the fundamental realization that you are not your thoughts, you are not your emotions, the egoic self is constantly being transferred. From the standpoint of evolutionary survival, if everyone around you is a certain way, you will naturally assume the same state of being because that is what allows you to achieve approval and survive (there are countless examples of this, here's one easy that's actually very relevant: in the early days of Christianity and since the beginning of Islam, if you proclaimed that you had been struck with the profound truth that all humans can experience ""God"" (happiness to be alive and selfless love for all sentient beings) through your own use of attention, you would be summarily executed by those who take their very identity to be a bundle of thoughts, as in the literal existence of a God which is inherently separate from human consciousness... its funny because the prophets of these religions had the same experiences but believed they were due to a God when they were actually just exploring the possibilities of the human mind. You are making the same mistake, allowing the experience to provide evidence for an irrational belief simply because you don't understand it.)  Anyways, continuing on in an attempt to get you to understand, the ego (the judgmental stream of thoughts and emotions inside your head which most people are fundamentally unaware of), is transmitted to others by the psychological connectivity of other humans, NOT a creator. The deep problem is that when you identify with your thoughts rather than realizing for yourself that they are spontaneous appearances, you feel an illusion of you being the author of your thoughts, when you actually barely any more control over your thoughts than you can control what the next word in this very sentence will be. The way you realize that you are not your thoughts is by observing this truth through meditation. Deep during a meditation, try to observe a thought and then  ""Look for the thinker"" and the ego will dissolve. Insecurities are a product of the ego, which is an illusion that meditation is the key to penetrating."

Mindfulness,3cfn1a,angelsambition,4,Tue Jul 7 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"My opinion: So in order to ""reduce your reactions"" to outside influence, you'll first have to find out WHY, you react to people in ""non peaceful ways"". Inner peace cannot be interrupted, when you understand where your reactions come from. Mindfulness is about being in the moment, WHATEVER that moment holds for you. If you are angry, be angry. Stuffing or changing that FEELing, you lose the clue in finding out WHY you got angry. ""We are never upset for the reason we think"". If you blame things outside of you for your feelings, how can you ever MASTER them? You will always get upset by things you DON""T want to be true. If I say ""You have blue hair"", how do you feel about that?.... not much right? If I say to you ""Your work habits suck"", How does that feel? .... See, If you can Make it OK to be a ""person with half hearted work habits"", that statement would mean as much as the blue hair statement... Inner peace is an inside job...

In the paper I bring up one cause of why the mind so easily goes into negativity:  ""The usual conditioning of the human mind is that it tries to avoid confusion, and for a good reason since confusion is worse than fear. In fearful thinking there is at least some chance of solving problems while confusion hardly produces any constructive results. One problem is that this also makes the mind easily slip into fearful thinking which involves a biological fight-or-flight response that when chronic or excessively prolonged leads to deteriorating health."""

Mindfulness,3catls,kkristynn,2,Mon Jul 6 15:15:10 2015 UTC,"Not really.  My own tradition, Transcendental Meditation, teaches that people wrongly interpret the Buddha's discussion of being always mindful as something you DO, rather than something that emerges.  People who practice the mind-wandering technique of Transcendental Meditation start to score higher on measures of mindfulness, but still retain the ability to let their minds wander. In fact, TM theory says that samadhi isn't the ultimate form of focus but simply what happens, in the right circumstances, when you allow your mind to wander freely: your mind spontaneously settles into a state of complete quietude.   Focusing your mind or training your mind to alway6s be mindful can also reduce apparent mind fluctuations, because your brain is diverting resources from mental verbalizations, to the task at hand, but brain imaging and EEG shows that various parts of the brain become more active as other parts (such as those associated with verbalization) become less active, so it may SEEM like your mind is more quiet because you're no longer verbalizing thoughts, but its at least as active as it ever was, just in a different way.  On the other hand, TM can lead to ludicrously extreme moments of complete quietude, where the only main activity is the simple ""carrier wave"" activity of Alpha-1 frequency EEG, that just keeps lines of communications open between distant parts of the brain, even if no data-processing is being done (note vertical lines drawn to emphasize such periods).  When this kind of pattern shows up more and more outside of TM practice,  a pure sense-of-self, always mindful, never-judgmental, starts to emerge in the meditator. When this pure sense-of-self becomes permanent, present 24 hours a day, whether awake, dreaming or in deep sleep, the meditator naturally calls this their ""real"" self.  And so, ""be always mindful"" is all that this ""real self"" can be because that is all that It does -It watches everything because It has no qualities other than watchfulness -It is called ""Self"" because the relaxed lines of communication are still open throughout the brain, including with those thought to be responsible for ""sense of self,"" but they're not associated with any ""thing"" or belief or desire or any other form of activity: ""Self"" just is and It is always mindful because that is Its essential nature."

The old monk who started it spent 60 years creating organizations to promote and teach stuff related to his world-view, and leveraged the large sums of money that people were willing to pay and the large LARGE sums of money that True Believers were willing to donate to create a Really Large Organzationâ¢.  .  The old monk insisted that his organization had to be large enough and credible enough to deal with national governments, and his followers dutifully attempted to oblige. Amusing as the American Press found him over the years, that attention to detail has paid off:  e.g. the May 2015 Commencement speech at TM university was given by former Prime Minister of Japan  The current Prime Minister of Japan, the current President of Brazil, the current President of Colombia, the former Deputy-Prime Minister of England, and the former President of Mozambique are also all TMers, and several of them have overseen agreements between the TM organization and their respective governments over the years.  It's an easy organization to make fun of, and large enough that almost any criticism is correct at least some of the time."

The intervals for the reminders can be set to a default value of say reminding the user 5 times a day at random times, and have a setting to let the user choose other schedules for the reminders as an additional option.  When the user is reminded to become mindful, a short instruction can be shown for example a randomly chosen sentence like: ""Take two mindful breaths."" - ""Become aware of what you are thinking right now."" - ""Feel the aliveness in your left hand."" - ""Notice your body posture."" - ""Notice how you feel now."" - ""Become aware of what is around you."" Or no message at all if the user prefers to use his or her own techniques for mindfulness practice.  The app would only be like ""training wheels"" for mindfulness practice, not something that the user should become dependent on since mindfulness should be achieved even when tools like that are unavailable."

Mindfulness,3c6r21,Singular_Thought,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:20:33 2015 UTC,"I feel that there is me as an ""I"" when I practice mindfulness, but after a while the nervous system becomes trained so that a more mindful state can arise spontaneously. And in the mindful state desires become softer kind of.  Desires are like lights to moths who are drawn to the light. Mindfulness adds an additional powerful source of light, so that the ordinary desires become easier even though they have the same strength as before.  I'm not really religious but there are many powerful statements in scriptures, such as in the Bible:  ""The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!"" -- Matthew 6:22-23  Notice the singular ""eye"" which I take as meaning the mind's eye. Mindfulness is the analogy of increasing the light of awareness."

If its persistent, I continue to acknowledge with ""thought"" and my mind eventually settles.   Knowing those two things has helped me in my life so much.

You can play the cringeworthy memory over and over in your mind until it doesn't make you cringe any more.  It's worth remembering that you're not cringing at the memory or emotion itself, but at your judgement of it. There is nothing inherently cringeworthy in anything you experience."

Mindfulness,3c5m57,shortback,3,Mon Jul 6 06:37:49 2015 UTC,"If you can get any distance on the thoughts (that is, stay mindful and not be overcome by them), I'd consider working on self-compassion when they arise. At first, they may be too strong and may indeed cause you to look away/get up, but once you can face them mindfully, try to empathize with yourself and recognize your own desire to not suffer both at the time and now as you remember it. If you need somewhere to start, thinking through the loving-kindness phrases when these thoughts arise can help: ""May I be happy. May I be well. May I be safe. May I be peaceful and at ease."" Then, look for any feelings of empathy with your past self and compassion for your current self -- almost as though relating to a friend who is remembering something painful. Once the aversion has passed and you feel a little more stable, you can hopefully just let the memory go. My guess is all of this will take time though -- at first you may still find yourself compelled to escape, and that's pretty normal, but for me at least, with practice I have found more space for difficult memories and more options for how to deal with them."

Often people with fits of rage are suppressing negative things like maybe they are shouldering a huge burden and when they are not appreciated they feel used then if they are told they are bad for being a horrible angry person and should be more mindful then this will be just another criticism on top of what tipped them over their limit of restraint and they wont be able to be mindful. mindfulness works through being calm and not through fear. if criticized then this will be using a negative and fearful motive towards trying to be mindful which will be counter productive. Also one way to guide people is to show yourself doing it and identifying with them. You will have had rage I know this as everyone does so you can improve yourself as well as encourage him. So maybe talk about how you got so angry one time and something bad happened and then tell about another time when you knew you would get angry or started to get angry and used mindfulness and how did the situation go much better?

Mindfulness,3bvp56,DangericeMan,8,Thu Jul 2 15:14:38 2015 UTC,"This is just my personal opinion, but I think the biggest thing that makes you view this as a setback is that you viewed your anxiety as something bad that you needed to get rid of.   Mindfulness should be all accepting. If you had overwhelming, constant anxiety over a package delivery, that's okay. It doesn't need to go away. Is it irrational? Maybe, but that doesn't make it any less real.  There is this misconception that mindfulness and meditation makes all negative emotions disappear. No more anxiety, sadness, frustration, etc. That is simply not true. You are going to experience those emotions, and sometimes they will be overwhelming. But you don't need to do anything about them. You don't need to relieve them, get rid of them, rationalize them, you simply need to let them be. Those emotions are just as much you as the ""positive emotions"" are. To try and get rid of them is trying to get rid of yourself.   Next time you face anxiety (or any other ""negative"" emotion), try accepting it. Be mindful, but don't see mindfulness as a cure. Don't expect it to go away. Sit with it however it is, and observe the emotion like a scientist would observe a specimen and just see what happens: no expectations."
Mindfulness,3bvp56,trevordabomb,3,Thu Jul 2 18:54:52 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents here: What is anxiety? It is a fear of a future event occurring in a manner that we ""fantasize"" about it, causing us to ""assume"" an outcome. When you can, try to think the fear through. Think it all the way to its conclusion. for instance, can't pay rent, ""What will happen if I don't pay rent?"", Will I be OK?"", What's the worst that can happen?""... ultimately, mindfulness is about being in the moment of each feeling. Being present with the fear you have takes practice. You'll find that what you were fearing was not as bad as you thought. When we reject a feeling by trying to push it down, it comes back ""sideways"" as anxiety, nervousness, etc... Being present when we feel stuff is mindfulness..."

I know what it feels like to have a really good and calm period where you feel in control and all of the sudden, you're completely overwhelmed by anxiety and don't seem to have a grip on anything!  What seems to be important for me, is to slow the fuck down! Something that is very typical in such situations is my mind racing. If I try to slow down my mind and everything I do (I once tried to literally do everything in slow motion (it actually helped but looked kind of stupid :p)).   Whatever you do, don't give up, just try again. Take a seat, close your eyes, take a deep breath and start meditating for 10, 20, 30, ... minutes. I noticed that the longer I meditate, the higher the impact, 20 minutes seems to be the sweet spot between effectiveness & efficiency for me!  Good luck to you my friend! You're not alone!"

Recently I have found that I get anxious during my meditation. I think this is because I'm anxious that I'm not 'getting mindfulness'. That I'm somehow missing the point and that I should be calmer and more focused by this point. Recently I felt the anxiety coming on. But rather than do anything about it I just observed it. Funnily enough after I while of focusing on it my attention naturally returned to my breath. The feeling didn't go away, but it just ceased being a point of focus for me. Like it was in the background. I think that these 'hard moments' are important. That somehow by choosing to observe rather than change I'll eventually figure out what mindfulness is all about. Not sure if this helps or not but I thought I'd share my experience this far as a novice. You're definitely not alone."

Mindfulness,3bq1go,faculties-intact,3,Thu Jul 2 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"That's all excellent advice! And the reason TRP is so successful is because it mixes genuinely good advice relating to confidence and eye contact and other things redditors stereotypically struggle with with all of the manipulative advice you neglected to mentioned.  Making sure you're never as invested in the relationship as the other person is, making sure you always stay in control, never being vulnerable but taking advantage someone else's vulnerable to close or extend your control. It definitely works. It's just not a very good way to treat other people, so I stand by calling it immoral.    Also, you can drop the holier-than-thou enlightened attitude, lol. Been there, done that, doesn't work."
Mindfulness,3bq1go,Rabolix,-3,Thu Jul 2 01:54:55 2015 UTC,"A common line of thinking is that amorality is a justification for immorality - an all too common fallacy.  What I'm postulating is that behaviour of ""manipulation"" (of which I believe your connotations are an attempt at change with a negative connotation) is already innate, done do at a barely conscious level of thought by all human beings. It's how its done which constitutes ethical breaches.  Furthermore from the propositions that you make, my understanding is that they are more directed towards someone controlling their own emotional responses, to still their own ego thus to achieve an effect by intrinsic ""manipulation"" (can you call it manipulation as this point?) as opposed to actually manipulate the person's eternal environment.   Which is what rp is against in the first place because these acts are not sustainable and create an illusion of someone bring better than they actually are. Which then crosses into manipulative territory such as pick up techniques all over the web.  Hence my âmeditate on..."" response. I didn't mean it to be a condescending and emotionally provocative attack, but a misunderstanding that can be cleared by clarity of thought and misconceived notions temporarily disconnected."

Mindfulness,3bjvvp,ellimak67,3,Mon Jun 29 20:39:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are quite attached to observing your breath. It seems that your approach to mindfulness is a little off. It need not be an activity you try to integrate into daily life, because mindfulness is quite natural. The reason you see people talking about it is because people (e.g. the Buddha) have realized that this particular quality of being attentive to the world around us (or inside us) is beneficial to our well-being and it helps us learn about the way things are (which ultimately leads to our well-being).  So you can relax a little. It doesn't seem advisable to be constantly aware of the breath, especially when you have work to be done. If it helps you do your work, keep going at it, but otherwise you should focus your attention on the task at hand. As you said, sometimes it get distracting.   In the Satipatthana Sutta (the Buddha's discourse on the four foundations of mindfulness), we are taught to be alert and attentive (mindful) in regards to the body, the ""feeling-tone"" of experiences, the states of our mind, and the phenomena of our mind â including those nasty cognitive habits. I suggest you read it. The Buddha gives very specific things to be attentive to, but that doesn't mean that those are the only things you should pay attention to.  Don't ignore anything. Understand your bad habits by paying attention to them."
Mindfulness,3bjvvp,angryrika,2,Tue Jun 30 01:06:44 2015 UTC,"I think you have a very common issue. Meditation and breathing practices can be very straining if you are trying to use them for fixing your problems. You say you have been doing it ""on and off"" which helps me assume a little.   It is widely accepted that meditation benefits people who take it as a daily practice to strengthen themselves for the harsher moments in life. So a preventive and preemptive mindset could be an easier place to start, you are only now practicing when it would be at it's hardest :) no need for such challenge...mindfulness is hard anyway..."
Mindfulness,3bjvvp,curiosgorge,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:51:45 2015 UTC,"Focusing on the breath can be awesome though the day but you're right that it can be distracting too. I personally try to just focus on the breath in between tasks on when I can an opportunity to pause (i.e. on the bus, in she shower, etc.) But even a quick focus can help when you need it and are stressed. Three deep belly breaths are enough to stimulate the vagus nerve and trigger your parasympathetic nervous system to calm you down :)   Otherwise it doesn't always have to be the breath that grounds us either. You can try taking a few moments to notice the feeling of your feet on the floor, or notice your kind being attracted to external things like sight, sound or touch. But in general I would do these in dedicated mini-moments because focusing on two things at once is too difficult for our brains (at this stage in our evolution anyhow, hehe)"
Mindfulness,3bjvvp,wisekernel,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:59:31 2015 UTC,You can try doing deep breathing for a couple minutes every hour. That way it's still in the back of your mind without constantly being your main focus. I think it's not really practical to constantly be mindful of your breath. The work and enjoyment of other things you do is important to be mindful of too.
Mindfulness,3bjvvp,humans_nature_1,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:46:46 2015 UTC,"I try and do mindful activities throughout the day, but vary these rather than the same one.

It seems to refresh my brain more doing it like this, concentrating on various senses rather than just the one thing."
Mindfulness,3bi8sm,shizle32,3,Mon Jun 29 13:07:10 2015 UTC,"Well like anything it's a practice and you get better at it as you keep trying. If you are not at a restaurant I would suggest removing your plate from in front of you when you are done. That makes it a lot easier. If your food is still sitting in front of you and you have the urge to eat more take time to check in with your body. Are you still hungry? If so, eat more. If you aren't hungry then don't. Do you feel push back? Is your mind telling you that it's a waste to not clean your plate? Okay, that's great- let those thoughts come and go without engaging them."
Mindfulness,3bi8sm,Skycakes,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:59:24 2015 UTC,I just use the leftovers. At home I just get up and pack them up and put them away and in a restaurant I just ask for a doggy bag. That way food is not wasted. I can also notice my aversion to leaving food behind and can explore that a little too. Or I can notice my urge to eat more and explore that. Make sense?
Mindfulness,3bi8sm,wisekernel,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:19:28 2015 UTC,"There are many factors relating to this.  Thinking of diet as just another behavior pattern, which it isn't exactly, it might be helpful to apply some related techniques.  One of the ideas from the Anat Baniel Method that I find most helpful is to mix things up.  Instead of confronting an issue directly, first deliberately muddy the waters by coming at it in a completely different way.  For example, it may be helpful to learn a difficult piece of music by first playing it all wrong, then going back to doing it right.  I do this with diet by role playing, and in particular by temporarily suspending my usual enthusiasm for food in order to become a Skinny Bitch.  In Skinny Bitch mode I get or cook smaller amounts of food than usual, serve only part of that, and then mostly pick at it instead of really eating.  This is amusing and entertaining and immediately reduces the amount I eat while increasing the control I have over eating.  I don't keep this up very long, but I don't have to because visiting this alternative state for a while completely changes everything about how I perceive food and eating.  Another possibly helpful idea is the Confucian idea which is popular in Japan of ""Hara hachi bu"" or eight parts full.  In this the idea is to very consciously target a balanced state of having eaten plenty without being quite full.  This can be really helpful because the moment we become full may pass by quite quickly and this method helps to avoid overeating."

Mindfulness,3bi8sm,Dont-be_an-Asshole,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:58:28 2015 UTC,Why half? What if you're hungry for a quarter or more than half? Mindful eating is about listening to your body to determine hunger/fullness signals. If you are going into it with determination to only eat half you're not doing it right.

The conventional training says ""no"", and that if one wants to develop the skill, then a daily practice is the ""recommended dosage"".  However, I suppose all experiences are worth the experiment. Fixed views can be their own defeat.  Take a break for a while, and see how that affects your conditioning. Be truthful with any and all new information that emerges. If you feel the conditioning taking back over, then by all means, start the practice back up. If not, keep with your reduced schedule."

Now, it is definitely possible not to sit for dedicated practice for some time and maybe that is a mindful thing to do for you, though it is hard to think of circumstances longer than a day or two where that might be the case. BUT mindfulness, in my opinion, doesn't need to be practiced on the cushion alone. It is a way of noticing and observing ourselves and that can be done day to day. In fact I find that the habit of being mindful in life is hard to shake (not that I want to) so the practice is often still there"
Mindfulness,3b9ehg,mnemoniker,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:04:21 2015 UTC,"At first, my thought was if mindfulness is the end and meditating is the means, then not meditating must achieve the opposite end goal. But then I remembered this passage from 10% Happier, by Dan Harris:   Studies showed that the best way to engineer an epiphany was to work hard, focus, research, and think about a problemâand then let go. Do something else. That didnât necessarily mean meditate, but do something that relaxes and distracts you; let your unconscious mind go to work, making connections from disparate parts of the brain.   Reflexively applied to meditation itself, if this study is true, it's conceivable that one could achieve some unforeseen insights and improve their abilities by taking a break. But I would imagine that you still have to come back to it someday."

Left-wing hermeneutics of suspicion. He likes some stuff supported by research, so don't pay him any attention.""  The question for me is whether we should expect these trends to gain steam. Five years ago I couldn't afford a smart phone. Now people use them to tell them when to drink water, and we quantify everything. I haven't worked for a company that tries to quantify my happiness or health, but it's not much of a stretch to see benefits, credit scores, promotions, or hiring decisions impacted by available data.   Measuring something also requires defining it narrowly and explicitly, but people not familiar with the debates surrounding those definitions use findings based on those measures uncritically. I can't imagine anything healthier than fostering public consideration of happiness and the good life. Telling them what scientists have found out about it isn't the way to do that."

That's a good exercise you can do and the first one I'd suggest trying.  Also, you can do simple exercise movements with mindfulness. I'd suggest checking out this video of Thich Nhat Hanh's ""10 Mindful Movements"".  My suggestion is as you practice both exercises, to become in touch with the area of the body that you're feeling the pain and to let go of any risidual ""pulling and tugging"" as you practice to try and make the area feel ""better"". Just experience the pain and accept it openly, don't label it ""bad"", or anything for that matter.  I hope that helps!"

There is some great content out there on mindful childbirth (and pregnancy) and how to use mindfulness to deal with physical discomfort. It is definitely possible.  First, have you seen this book on mindful birthing: http://www.amazon.ca/Mindful-Birthing-Training-Childbirth-Beyond/dp/006196395X?? Could help, I found it quite good.  Second, I found this article on using mindfulness for physical discomfort helpful: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/turning-straw-gold/201104/how-mindfulness-can-help-physical-suffering  Third, I actually have a free YouTube video on the topic here: https://youtu.be/GhvwzsCBUew or you might be able to find other sources on there.  In general, the idea is to recognize your pain and discomfort as a sensation the same as any other. What REALLy makes it uncomfortable? What part is your suffering and what part is the pain itself? How do your feelings about the discomfort affect that discomfort? We often make our own discomfort worse by being averse to it and resisting it. If you experiment with your discomfort mindfully what happens? What if you surrender to it? What if you try to befriend it? What if you try to send it pure, white cleansing light to sooth and hold it?"
Mindfulness,3b2yw4,SRavingmad,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:07:34 2015 UTC,"Well, mindfulness would tell you to simply experience whatever it is your body is feeling in the moment, accept it for what it is, and recognize it for the transitory state that it is. If you're feeling well, recognize that you are likely to not feel well soon and do not cling to the present feeling. If you don't feel well, recognize that this too will pass and don't reject the current moment. If anything, this is a perfect chance to practice true mindfulness, with the coming and going of symptoms like nausea showing you the impermanence of things, including your own physical and mental states. It may even be that the very thing you mentally and emotionally reject now is something you later miss, after the pregnancy is over!  Of course, all of the above is great discussion in the abstract, and less compelling when you feel like crap, but there you go."

Mindfulness,3b2cnn,Nachomonkey36,6,Thu Jun 25 12:15:39 2015 UTC,"The act of knowing that your not being mindful is mindfulness in itself. The biggest break through I've had is just ""letting the thoughts come as they are"". Let the the thoughts of sadness, anger and depression come. Watch your thoughts as an observer and try not to judge, attach or react to them. See how they are created and how your body changes to them. I've found that most of my anxiety is related to thinking my thoughts are wrong. I would be always be immersed in my mind and would be distracted all the time. Even worse, when I realized that I wasn't being mindful, my inner critical voice would be angry that I lost control. I realized that it's not about control, but letting things be as they are. Thoughts just ""are"". Thoughts will always come and go. When coming back to being mindful, try to do so gracefully without reacting. What I've found helpful is to find a physical symptom which tells me I'm not being mindful. For me, it's my heartbeat getting a little harder and faster and a tense feeling in my head. The feelings usually come when I'm immersed in some sort of negative thought pattern. I used to hate these feelings. Now I use them as a tool for letting me know I'm not mindful and that I should come back to the present. It takes a lot of work and a process that you have to keep working at everyday. Over time, the seas will calm. I'm definitely not there yet. My seas are still rocking, but I'm not in the storm I used to be. The storms still come, but mindfulness helps the storms pass quicker. That's what works for me. I hope it helps you!"
Mindfulness,3b2cnn,Peanut_butter_m_n_ms,2,Thu Jun 25 14:01:53 2015 UTC,"Hey there,  Sounds frustrating for you, sorry to hear it has been tricky. The key is to let your thoughts be where they are right now. If they aren't coming up, perhaps focus on something else for now then. Maybe the breath, maybe do body scans, maybe sensation in your body. Thoughts are tricky. They don't always like to be discovered so sometimes we have to leave them alone and look elsewhere and then when they have something to say and they don't feel ""watched"" they speak up again. Make sense?  I would try looking for meditations on YouTube or online that have you focus on emotion and getting into your body. Our bodies often hold onto our thoughts and help repress them under emotion and other layers. The more you can get into your body, the closer your relationship will become to the ""you"" beneath.   If you want further recommendations on specifics let me know, I do have a variety of videos on my channel that can help but I am trying to avoid being self-promotional so I hope that helps for now :)"

Somewhere in that process, is where your feelings and emotions start. For ME, I have a belief that used to run my life, ""I'm not good enough"". Everything I did in my life came with THAT belief attached to it. I had to go deep and FEEL what it was like to BE ""not good enough"", so it would no longer run my life. Once I understood that, at times, I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH, then I could live with ""not being good enough"". Fighting that feeling caused me MOST of my issues.

I too found this account to be ridden with assumptions of enlightenment as a goal state. But I think the account also makes it clear what a piece of hard work it is to embark on such a retreat. Hard on the modern (wo)man's short attention span and generally on the body. I think it's a good thing to have these retreats off the pedestal as an easy ride to enlightenment.   I like to think of it more as an abrupt and hardcore kickstarter of a continual process of awakening. Anyone like to shed light or oppose my assumptions on the experience is welcome.   Edited gramma

Mindfulness,3aj94m,instantrobotwar,8,Sat Jun 20 19:00:04 2015 UTC,My technique when I feel I'm manually breathing is to stop at the end of an out breath and wait for the next breath to start on its own. Then that breath is more automatic. I feel like I have this problem a lot but I try not to let it worry me. Even if I breathed manually the whole time it is still valuable practice.

I felt like if I didn't concentrate on it I stopped breathing. I still hold my breath without noticing. I've been told it's a sign of anxiety/slight OCD and one of the reasons I should try meditation.
Mindfulness,3aj94m,beerandabike,3,Sat Jun 20 19:25:36 2015 UTC,"I get this sometimes when going to sleep or in the middle of sleep, kind of like sleep apnea, when I'm really super sleep deprived and stressed. I'll either get anxiety before drifting off to sleep thinking that I'm in manual mode and can't fall asleep or I'll stop breathing, or I'll wake up choking because I literally did forget to breath.  I don't think its sleep apnea since this happens MAYBE once or twice a year, when I'm super stressed."
Mindfulness,3aj94m,k3ny,4,Sat Jun 20 21:25:17 2015 UTC,"I started doing mindfulness to help me with my anxiety/panic that was partly surrounding my breathing. I found that simply being mindful towards those thoughts/sensations to be the answer, what that means to me is to just watch my thoughts/sensations without interacting with them, and letting my attention naturally drift but observe. I found this EXTREMELY difficult to do to begin with but after repeated practice of letting myself experience those difficult sensations with breathing it has all but gone away, and when I do experience it it is just like any other sensation.  PS: I would happily go into this in more depth to how I used mindfulness for this if anyone wants"

Mindfulness,3aj94m,k3ny,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:05:50 2015 UTC,"The big take way from mindfulness for me has been the idea of not pushing away or trying to change my sensations/thoughts, letting them be and then expanding my awareness. For me, my breathing problems were OCD-esque in that I formed very tightly bound habits/behaviours that I would alter my breathing (as I previously thought I wasn't breathing) when I became aware of it, such as taking in deep breaths not breathing out properly etcetc.  I used mindfulness in the normal way by watching those thoughts/sensations but not reacting to them or trying to alter them, and then ""gently"" expanding my awareness to other sensations. I found at the beginning it was so hard to do this that I had to do it lying down in bed where I could really surrender to my sensations/thoughts, I also found that I had to be SUPER gentle in bringing in other sensations into my awareness.  Over time of repeatedly observing and expanding my awareness things are a lot easier (as before I would have full blown panic attacks over these sensations).

If you feel like your breath is manual, then you did the job of noticing it already. Breathe in the easiest way you find, even if you temporarily have to follow your anxious drive.  Remember, this is about how noticing and awareness slowly withers the compulsive doing. Not about forcing yourself to remain still and ""natural"". This is mindfulness, not some kind of standardized and strict zazen. I remember a temple where the master YELLED at you for not being focused on your breath. He explained that is part of the tradition and how you shouldn't be intimidated by it, but still..."

Nothing wrong with a bit of ""distraction"" either depending on the meditation you are doing I suppose though. for example, doing a quick body scan or internal/external awareness meditation and coming back to breath meditation. Just until you feel more adept at ""letting go"""

It's something that I felt often during adolescence, but without the means to understand it was, well, awkward and adolescenty. But there's something very powerful about understanding thoughts and emotions as separate from ""us,"" sadness as powerful, etc. Beautiful movie.

That's when you need to find the space for formal pactice.  Agree with EddardAdolf in that mindfulness should be non-judgemental and non-aspirational which is not a way of thinking that we are taught.

Mindfulness,3a89qq,CryptoGreen,4,Thu Jun 18 02:33:31 2015 UTC,"you're probably right but i think many see Buddhism as a philosophy rather than a religion. that, and Harris' claims tend to focus on the practice as removed from religious dogma. that is, we can enjoy the benefits of mindfulness without ascribing them to a specific deity or dogma."
Mindfulness,3a89qq,bearlounger,2,Thu Jun 18 06:03:56 2015 UTC,"Ok, sure.  But there is no need to attack or remove support from a tradition that is centered around the propogation of mindfulness. Why not, you know, observe it without judgement?"
Mindfulness,3a89qq,CryptoGreen,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:01:04 2015 UTC,"But there is no need to attack or remove support from a tradition that is centered around the propogation of mindfulness.   If someone believes that this tradition includes holding unsupported and unwarranted beliefs in the existence of a supernatural dimension, then why shouldn't one address that as surplus and unnecessary?  Harris's position is that mindfulness is extremely beneficial, but that the supernatural beliefs that are commonly associated with it are unwarranted.  That's a perfectly tenable position.   Why not, you know, observe it without judgement?   Harris spent decades studying the Eastern traditions.  Why should he abstain from judgement?  I personally think open criticism and discussion of ideas is good.  Don't you?"
Mindfulness,3a89qq,ColdShoulder,2,Fri Jun 19 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"|why shouldn't one address that as surplus and unnecessary?

This doesn't follow.  If you disagree with Sam Harris on this particular position, you need to present your argument.  Saying that some people have ""false perceptions"" while making a nebulous claim about being ""so sure"" doesn't suffice as a rebuttal.  It's not even a point.  Sam Harris isn't claiming to be absolutely 100% positive.  He has a position, and he defends it with reasoned argument. If you disagree with his position, I would like to hear why you think his argument falls short.   If there is a surplus, maybe it exists within our own secular reddit culture as well as vietnamese monks praying at shrines.   Perhaps it does, but that wouldn't make Sam's point any less true.   Because behaving judgmentally is the opposite of mindfulness.   I disagree.  Mindfulness, to me, is about being present.  It's about recognizing your thoughts and emotions as they come and go.  It doesn't mean that you can't have opinions and make judgments about the order of the universe.  It just means that you don't allow these opinions and judgments to overwhelm you to a point where you can't experience the present moment as it exists while it exists."

Mindfulness,3a7rz6,the_stanley_duck,7,Wed Jun 17 22:07:09 2015 UTC,"Sometimes trying to be mindful is a non-native thing to do in terms of our lifelong habits and conditioning. The thing with anxiety is to make sure to keep pushing your own buttons. Keep putting yourself in situations where you feel anxious or if the anxiety is to do with internal issues then be sure to consciously bring up whatever is causing the anxiety and then process it. Often times the anxiety won't go away in the moment and there doesn't seem to be any quick fix. One interesting method is to focus on the feeling of anxiety in your body and actually try to make them stronger. Make effort to intensify the feelings. Build them up to a crescendo. Make it worse! Make it unbearable! This exposes the paradox of both redirecting your mind and the reality of anxiety or panic being rooted in thought process. It's a feedback loop and the only sensible thing to do is to deliberately interrupt the loop or else ignore it completely. Ignoring it isn't usually an option because the feeling are quite overwhelming. Have you tried being ""ok"" with the feeling instead of ""accepting"" them. It's very individual but being ""ok"" with something in that moment is to many people quite different from accepting it. The survival instinct is overstimulated in cases of anxiety so telling yourself to accept those feelings is often counter constructive. Instead say to yourself something very specific: ""I am ok with these feelings being here at this time"". This includes the understanding that it's an "" acceptance"" for that portion of experience and not as something in general. If you can feel that yourself then mindfulness is to do a crazy thing and actually explore the feelings of discomfort in terms of fully tuning into bodily sensations, particularly unpleasant ones, without making any decisions about what they mean. It's just a feeling. You can decide what it means tomorrow. In that moment, commit to being a crazy mofo and actually turning towards it all and feel it fully. Breathe... It's just your unique experience. Ask what is there and not why is it there. I hope some of that made sense. These sometimes subtle distinctions have made a huge difference to me."

Mindfulness,3a7rz6,Devnik,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:22:04 2015 UTC,"You're very welcome and glad it could come in useful as each of our experiences, while unique, often have similar elements. There could be various contributing factors to anxiety, including physical reasons to do with balances within the body. Making sure to have good nutrition wherever possible can make a real difference although on its own won't normally eliminate issues with anxiety. After many years of investigations  I regularly take high quality omega 3's and a herb called Ashwaghanda which along with committing to daily exercise of some form even if it just means going for a walk, have made a big difference. Mindfulness practice has been very useful in retraining the brain and I definitely feel benefit from that too.  What things do you do to try to alleviate feelings of anxiety? Have you found mindfulness practice helps?"
Mindfulness,3a7rz6,diagonali,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:42:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response, I'm already putting this into practice. I had a brief anxiety attack this morning, and instead of trying to distract myself or use the mindfulness techniques I'm more familiar with, I just faced the anxiety head-on. It was an interesting experience because I realized that this attack in particular was based on random thoughts about how temporary life is...I've never really thought about that kind of stuff before but perhaps it could be the reason behind a lot of my anxiety, and I'm only becoming aware of it now?"
Mindfulness,3a7rz6,diagonali,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:02:50 2015 UTC,"It's great that you got something from my post and felt able to use it to make a difference. Facing anxiety instead of attempting to escape or bury it is really the only way to eventually say goodbye to anxiety because. Anxiety is the well meaning friend we really need to move on from. It served a purpose at some point usually but now it's quite literally a bad habit at the level that those who have difficulty with it experience. Uncovering undiscovered thoughts is a fantastic thing to have happened. Even just clarification can be immensely positive. The mind is so fascinating and although we can sometimes become worn out through the effort we make, sometimes it's so refreshing to relax and allow ourselves to experience discomfort as an interested observer. It's a state of mind that definitely takes practice. I myself am very far from satisfied with my progress. But we must, absolutely must, learn to give ourselves credit for just how well we're doing in the face of some very difficult, often misunderstood challenges. Sounds like there's a very positive and subtle shift happening which can only be of benefit. All the best."
Mindfulness,3a7rz6,mnbvcxzlk,3,Wed Jun 24 22:27:07 2015 UTC,"I suffered from really intense anxiety attacks for a few years and I can tell you that sometimes, when it's already out of control, you have to ride it out whatever way works best for you.   The thing that's gradually helped me stop before it gets there learning to stop labeling the attack. There are emotions and physical sensations I am experiencing that I can manage independently, but once I form them into an 'attack' in my mind, they are this beast I've never been able to outrun before. So why would I be able to outrun it now?  Now, when I feel like can't breathe, or I'm breathing too quickly, I acknowledge it, excuse myself from the situation if necessary, and take a few minutes to focus on my breath until it is no longer an issue. If I have strange sensations, I focus on those sensations and breathe while ignoring the labels my mind makes about them, just feeling the feelings.  This took a lot of practice. It was not easy at first at all. In fact, at first there were still many times I ended up having a full blown attack. We're talking laying down in the middle of a sidewalk freaking out.  Now whenever any of those initial symptoms arise, by paying attention to what I'm actually experiencing instead of my fears about the experience, I'm usually able to address the stressful thoughts that are trying to get my attention in the first place.   So it takes practice, but keep at it and I'm sure you'll figure out an approach that works best for you."
Mindfulness,3a7rz6,jedisjumphigh,2,Wed Jun 17 23:05:28 2015 UTC,"it depends on what you're looking for.  if you're looking to get rid of these unpleasant feelings, or not feel them, mindfulness isn't for you.  if you want to really deepen your human experience and maybe even heal yourself, then mindfulness is ideal.  the full immersion in/as the discomfort of a panic attack is precisely what frees you from its bonds. that doesn't mean it won't suck. but, at the deepest level, it won't be a problem.  after all, it's happening anyway. what other choice is there?  and yes, in a practical sense, if you develop a capacity to truly be mindful of these attacks, they are likely to occur less often.  oh and, by the way, as your mindfulness deepens, it's not uncommon for more of these unpleasant feelings to arise than before. that is a sign that you're headed right and isn't to be avoided :) you can think of it as a flushing out of feelings that have always been there, but hiding."
Mindfulness,3a7rz6,mrCasual,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:05:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response, the point you made about unpleasant feelings arising more often than before really makes my current situation make sense.

It's good to know that I could be on the right track!"
Mindfulness,3a7rz6,EddardAdolf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:59:44 2015 UTC,"Well, you can always listen to your breath. It's constant and always there, no matter your emotions at the time. Breathing is the foundation of your existence, and you can always turn to it as a rock of stability. You're taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide, and that builds you body and allows you to be.  That's an ""emergency chute"" thought that you can always go to. Drink in the air and experience it like an expensive meal.  It centers your thinking to have that.  The other thing I'd offer is from Jon Kabat-Zinn. It's the thought that every single thing you do or experience is part of the ""great adventure of your life."" You only get one, and it goes quickly. So enjoy it. All of it. That includes the panic attacks, believe it or not. Tell yourself, ""Even this is part of the great adventure of my life."" A story isn't interesting if there's no conflict and no challenge. Appreciate this weirdness of yours. It's a part of the story of who you are. It's just a chapter, not the whole thing, and not the ending, but it's still part. That is all."
Mindfulness,3a0gia,Nachomonkey36,9,Tue Jun 16 06:53:19 2015 UTC,"That's great. That's exactly what you're supposed to do. Acceptance is an active process. It means acknowledging that you cannot change what has happened in the past and forgiving yourself for it by practicing self compassion. You may still be trying to push thoughts out of your mind. Let thoughts come and go as they please- just don't follow them and go down the rabbit hole of thoughts. You just keep sitting and letting things happen as they will. Sit and notice what is going on around you. Don't overthink it! Mindfulness should make you aware of your emotions and thoughts more than ever. However, I have found that suppressing my emotions actually makes them worse. Feeling my initial emotional response to something- truly feeling it- makes it so it doesn't snowball into something much worse. I still have emotions, lots of them- but they tend to be less intense and I don't react to them with unhealthy behaviors as much.   One of my favorite spiritual teachers is Alan Watts. He doesn't talk exclusively about mindfulness, but talks about lots of different things. There's also a sub /r/alanwatts with lots of videos and lectures."
Mindfulness,3a0gia,Skycakes,3,Tue Jun 16 15:20:20 2015 UTC,"Similarly to your ""it's okay"" I just internally say ""thought"" as an acknowledgment. Sometimes if it's a particularly intrusive thought that is really getting me, I internally say something to the extent of ""I am not the one that speaks the thought, I am just the one who listens"". It just helps me cement that I'm not doing anything wrong and I'm not being controlled by thoughts that pop in and out of my head. It may sound kind of lame, but it has been helpful."
Mindfulness,3a0gia,Tbeckmanly,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:17:07 2015 UTC,"Tried this, it was a really interesting experiment.  Small thoughts: squashed.  Intrusive thoughts: Thinking ""I am not the one who speaks the thought, I am the one who listens"" kind of activated my chatter more. It sent me on a tangent thinking about Breaking Bad line ""I am the one that knocks""   Repeating ""thought...thought...thought"" until I got tired of thinking it worked better for me. I could almost feel the thought giving up.   Tbeckmanly's method probably works better for him, but this works better for me. Which goes to show, take what people know and make it work for you."
Mindfulness,3a0gia,clothes_account_,3,Sat Jun 20 19:51:52 2015 UTC,"I've never really thought of the practice as the ""suppression of thoughts."" Thoughts are something you can acknowledge and observe, just the same as you can a cool breeze or the sound of your breathing. Just stuff. Observe them like anything else. That you're having a thought or an emotion is just a fact, and nothing more.   It can be hard to get that feeling of detached observation about an emotion, though. The best way to practice this is to get good at observing other, easier things, like the warmth of sunlight, or the tang of lime in a recipe. Practice, practice, practice. There's no replacement for time on task practicing.   Best of luck, and be sure to forgive yourself. We're all the same, so don't get down on yourself. That might be hard to believe now (or at least doesn't help to hear) but if your perspective on the universe can change through mindfulness, it might make more sense then."
Mindfulness,3a0gia,mrCasual,2,Wed Jun 17 02:53:36 2015 UTC,"The more you try to suppress a thought, the more it will pop up. Just like you said, when an intrusive thought comes up, don't shove it back down and try to ignore it, just accept it and let it pass naturally. As for everything else you mentioned, I haven't experienced it myself, so I can't offer you any explanation."

Mindfulness,39u2n5,terryds1234,2,Sun Jun 14 19:53:05 2015 UTC,"Mindfulness is helping me to understand the universe and our role in it more. Let me explain. I used to work a 60 hour week, always stressing about reaching goals I set to achieve better things, sales targets etc. But the more i focused on reaching these 'end' goals, the more I failed. Because all my thought energy went into it. Also, because I worked so long hours i did not see my wife and kids as much as I should. I'd take work home with me. The kids wanted to play and I would just snap. For me i got a wake-up call. A big wake-up call that happened in the middle of the night. I woke up about 3am and just burst into tears. Where was I going? How much time had I wasted chasing goals?  At that moment I took one almighty step back. I started to read about mindfulness, then I practiced it. Each day I placed no expectations on myself. I just said, 'life is as it is'.  These days i changed jobs and still work in the same role, but have a much more focused and stress-free approach. And you know what, it has opened more doors and opportunities.  Hope you guys get as much benefit as me. Good luck!"
Mindfulness,39u8mx,pleasewait,4,Sun Jun 14 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"I certainly wouldn't pay it too much mind, unless it seems like there's an important message about your life that your subconscious is trying to communicate. As you become more mindful, your practice is to notice things that were already there but you never saw, so I'd certainly see it as a sign of progress.   Good luck!"

Mindfulness,39stqp,Rkzthor,3,Sun Jun 14 12:44:08 2015 UTC,Does it help to repeat the word 'calm' as you feel your many thoughts coming (when you see someone - as you stated)??  One thing at a time is good.. Repeating a word (or two words) 'it's ok' while you relax and accept whatever moment is happening.. Relaxing and feeling the muscles across your body....  Does this help?
Mindfulness,39stqp,Oberto22,3,Sun Jun 14 13:48:09 2015 UTC,"I suggest practising being ""OK"" with any feelings, including anxiety or thoughts. Maybe just say to yourself: ""It's OK"".  The trick is to remember that being ""OK"" with something or accepting something in the moment doesn't necessarily mean that you like it. You might find the anxiety uncomfortable. Some people feel panicky and maybe even pain. So having an attitude of ""I don't enjoy this, but as long as  it's the case, it's OK that it's there"".  So walking down the street, someone coming towards you. Your mind is thinking away, self-talk chattering. Feelings are there. It might not be pleasant and you might indeed ultimately or sooner rather than now want to feel strangely relaxed in similar situations and you can find that you are more and more. Because you can use a power you always have no matter what: choice. Choose to believe that ""It's OK"". Even if your feelings are uncomfortable. Feeling uncomfortable doesn't necessarily mean you're not OK. I love hot chillies.  They induce great discomfort and pain. Because I've conditioned myself to eat them, I've grown to find the experience thrilling or even exciting. I'm sure someone  who'd never ever had chillies before would get very panicky and worried if they were secretly given very hot chillies in their food. So you see it really is all about perspective and your own beliefs, unconscious as they might be and unaware of them as you also might be. They're there and they're controlling you. Which would be quite depressing if it were not for the liberating fact that you can choose what to believe and what to do. Do that long enough and you'll condition states and habits. All starting with present moment meditative awareness. In fact, when you look back you'll realise you were a much shorter step away than you perhaps realised. Bon voyage!"
Mindfulness,39stqp,diagonali,3,Sun Jun 14 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"One thing that could be helpful is to add more metta bhavana (loving kindness) to your practice. In my experience with chronic anxiety, it occurs because the world feels like a threatening place. Loving kindness has allowed me to view the world in a different way.   Accepting the present moment really means opening up to it in a loving way. When I give something my full attention, I am actually practicing compassion. It may be that you would benefit from focusing more on loving-kindness if you are currently struggling with this feeling of compassion to what is there in the moment."
Mindfulness,39stqp,happyknownothing,2,Mon Jun 15 01:00:40 2015 UTC,"For me, it's a constant monitoring of the thoughts that pass through my mind, and a conscious effort to let them go.  If that sounds like a lot of effort,  it is.  But worth the work."
Mindfulness,39stqp,miss_ann_thr0pe,2,Sun Jun 14 14:53:59 2015 UTC,"Accepting the present moment means to even accept those that you are having anxious thoughts. I know that isn't exactly what you're looking for, so I'll add this:  I can really relate to the situation you are talking about. One thing that really helps me is to be aware of the present moment by focusing on 'what's actually happening.' You are walking. You are outside. You see a person. That person is walking. My brain organ made an anxious thought and my body reacted to it with a feeling. I'm walking. Etc.   Sounds kind of weird, but by keeping my focus off of JUST my thoughts, I'm able to see that there really is so much more going on and the reality of it is actually much more simple and non-threatening."

Mindfulness,39gs0i,RotarySeven,4,Thu Jun 11 16:48:00 2015 UTC,"Being mindful =/= not thinking  You can think all the time, even in meditation. The key here is not to think unconsciously. To sit and be lost in thought without even realizing it. All mindfulness is doing is applying awareness. If your mind wishes to think, let it think. Mindfulness isn't ""stop thinking, stop thinking, stop thinking..."" It is ""oh, this thought."" It is being aware of what you are thinking. Sometimes you identify with what your mind thinks, other times you don't. It's the awareness that's the key.  If you're out on a run and it feels better to focus on your heavy breathing and the impact on your legs, do so. If you find it easier to be aware of your surroundings and sights, do so. If you find it easier to bring awareness to your thoughts, do so. Just be aware of whatever is most apparent. There is no right way, only presence and awareness."

Be aware of others suffering at all times, be grateful for what you have at all times.  There's no need for one to trigger the other.  If the realization hits you like a ton of bricks (like it seemed to do), stay in that moment, don't let your mind try to grasp onto a different subject (of hunger/sickness/addiction).  Let it stay focused on that grateful feeling.  Those incoming thoughts, while empathetic, are no different than unwanted thoughts you have.    Keep letting go."

Mindfulness,39aqtd,vuarterrr,2,Wed Jun 10 13:59:52 2015 UTC,"I am no expert on the subject, but try this... when your mind starts to wander/chatter and you become aware of the wandering/chattering try to label it and calmly bring your attention back to the present. So if your are stacking boxes and you start thinking about what you need to do after work and it makes you worry or stressed or anxious. Label it. Say it to yourself ""There is stress/worry/anxiety"", and gently bring your attention back to your activity of stacking boxes. Sometimes these thoughts are stronger though and even after doing what i described above, the mind goes back to the same thoughts. You may try the above one more time, but if you feel like it persists, try to focus on your breathing. Counting your breaths up to 10 then starting back at 1 until you feel more at ease.   I think it's pretty common to feel the way you feel when trying to be mindful throughout the day. Even experienced practitioners have those moments. I once heard a talk (or read somewhere) that when we start our mindfulness practice and we struggle, we should be kind to ourselves. It's like stepping into a basketball court for the first time. Don't expect yourself to perform like an NBA player. It takes practice... years of it. Keep at it."

I feel that anxiety comes from a fear that bad things are going to happen to me and that I have the power to prevent this so I must do all I can to prevent those bad things. This might be where the impulse to worry comes from. Remove the ego and all of a sudden there is no ""me"" for bad things to happen to. The concept of ""bad"" also starts to lose some meaning because it is fundamentally a subjective concept. Maybe removing the ego distills experience into a series of variables , some that can be manipulated, some that cannot. In any case there is no place for worrying and anxiety in a mindset like this."

So, your automatic response to life is: ""Protect and keep safe, from all threats, real or imagined"".

I realized that if I let go of my self-concept and personal expectations, then I could eliminate social anxiety. By quieting the ego, so to speak, it's a lot easier to be kinder to yourself. Good luck to everyone with this realization in mind. :)"

Mindfulness,391nxx,Lazaro21,2,Tue Jun 9 00:38:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely it rings true. You say you're familiar with meditation, but have you looked at all into Buddhist and particularly Zen Buddhist philosophy? Stoicism as well, if you're more into Western philosophy. I think you're describing something pretty fundamental to that strain of thought.  If you haven't already, look into Alan Watts. There are hours upon hours of his talks on Youtube. I can't even begin to suggest a specific video, there are too many. Just search ""Alan Watts [problem]"" and you'll probably find something.  But anyway, no, there is nothing crazy about what you're saying. The hyper-analysis, the anxiety, and the ego are all intertwined. Learning to tackle one will help with the others. Learning to accept what is out of your control is one of the most important steps you can take toward developing a more fulfilled life.   my anxiety persists because I constantly evaluate what may or may not be making me feel a certain way (and it never turns off)   Actually, I think there is a specific Alan Watts talk (or piece of a talk) that I'd recommend based on this statement. It's just a snippet, really, so think of it more like a headline, and if you like what you hear, you can go much, much deeper.  Here it is (specifically, the second half addresses this concern): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NK3oe5eQmQ"
Mindfulness,391nxx,10tothe24th,2,Tue Jun 9 01:29:34 2015 UTC,"You are on to something. When we suffer, our thoughts turn inward. When we suffer a lot, we begin to internalize our pain and try to anticipate it, which often makes things worse.   We all need to learn to break the cycle, and it starts with realizing that our pain is not unique. Our struggles, our losses, our failures do not belong solely to us - there is always someone out there who knows exactly how you feel. By forgetting the pain of others, we trap ourselves in our pain.   When we realize this, we can begin to tame our ego and break down the barriers that we build around ourselves."

And then I imagine myself like a leaf carried by the breeze. I, the leaf, get to relax and experience the ride as given to me by my senses.   I also try to do mundane things in a mindful way. Like tying my shoes: the stain of dirt in the white laces, the texture on my fingers, the feeling of tautness when I pull them right, the sensation in my muscles from crouching to tie them, etcetera.

On other cards I have a list of things I'm grateful for. On another I have a list of interests I want to mindfully explore.   I developed this little system because putting a to do list in my phone never worked. I never looked there! But having to rewrite everything everyday brings everything into to focus.

It took me a long time, I'm pretty stubborn. so over a period of a couple years practicing being aware of my thoughts, finding what was REALLY upsetting me, digging deep into where feeling were coming from, I arrived at this awareness that ""I"" was not my brain/mind, and there was a ""me"", behind the thoughts. Where peace and awe and wonder hung out. What a great thing to SEE that you are NOT your thoughts. !!"

However, I am frightened...   If thoughts and feelings are not you, then who is it that is thinking they are feeling afraid?  Fear is just another thought, or rather a culmination of thinking, stemming from the same place that you've been able to detach yourself from in other ways. Having thoughts and feelings is ok, even being frightened is ok, but take a step back and look at this fear like you would any other thought or feeling."

EDIT: I should extend a little more on how we acknowledge distracting thoughts. It's composed of 3 points:   What was it? How long? How did you feel?   It make take some time to internalise this process without subvocalising it. With practice though, you won't need to express it with words."

They indicate your current state of being and should not me detached from but observed and dealt with.  If you are trying to detach yourself from them you are only temporary pushing them down and replacing them with relaxing feeling of deep breathing and that can lead to much worse problems because suppressed emotions and thoughts have their way of coming back.  When you are experiencing negative thoughts and emotions like fear, anger, resent etc, you shouldn't try to detach yourself from them by telling yourself: ""Oh these feelings are not me, am the consciousness that observes those feelings..."" or some New Age BS like that. But instead try to find out why you are experiencing those kind of thoughts and emotions so you can deal with them and move on."

Here's a good article that talks about how you aren't supposed to ""suppress"" thoughts - it's not exactly what you are talking about, but some of the points are applicable.  edit - followed a link and found this article which is more to the point of your question."
Mindfulness,38yg09,elphabaloves,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:07:00 2015 UTC,"The first thing that comes to mind is that, if you feel frightened of permanent detachment, then it's a feeling you have right now. Be aware of it in the moment and then bring your attention to where you want it to be.  Then, I don't understand the sentence ""meditation outside of meditation"". It seems to me that what you are describing is meditation. From this sentence I have the doubt that you are doing something a little different: suppressing. I am not an expert, but the more I meditate the more I understand the difference between suppressing and letting go.  When I was meditating and anxious thoughts began, my reaction was to say ""no no no, I don't want to think that, back to breathing! back to breathing so that I don't think that!"".  While recently the response is more something like ""hmm, this is a thought, and I feel anxiety correlated with this thought. I feel anxious about that. Now what about my breathing? I am breathing in..."" and then I focus on my breathing, meanwhile I feel the residual anxiety that often goes away after a while, and often it does not, and another though arises full of anxiety, and it simply means that in this moment I am feeling anxious about that.  The meditation in this case helps to reduce the rumination and the train of thought that spirals out of control into panic attacks, that I experienced some years ago. When the negative thought and the anxiety gets no conscious response, and the consciousness decides to focus on something else, there is no feedback loop.  When you talk about holding water in your hand, that you can't bring back, I sense that you feel attachment to you thoughts, and that you are afraid of losing something important because of meditation. This is a matter of trust in the practice and trust in your self. You can decide that the meditation is more important than losing some thoughts, or you can decide something like ""this thought is very important for my life, I need to make it stay"", then for example take pen and paper, quickly write that thought and return to meditate. Do it mindfully and remember that you can be (are) the one that knows yourself best."

Mindfulness,38uazf,oestre,2,Sat Jun 6 23:48:08 2015 UTC,This.  I have been experiencing the same thing in recent weeks.  Depression or anxiety will come on very intensely and then subside after a few hours.  It can be hard to get through but try to remember that it will pass.  Nothing lasts forever.  I have been told this is a normal side effect of mindfulness as the practice matures and takes hold and that such events should subside in time.  Don't expect perfection.  Life comes with pain.  Let it be and it will pass as does all things.

Mindfulness,38uazf,Singular_Thought,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:37:48 2015 UTC,"Do you use self inquiry?  If so, ask ""Who feels this?""  or ""To whom does this this depression appear?""  What you are feeling is the ego/I/me going into a ""panic"" as it realizes that it is being ""discovered"" and dissolved as it is exposed to awareness though the practice of mindfulness.   Some people call this the ""Dark night of the soul"".  Here is a link to an article on the matter.  Basically this is the conditioning of the mind that is coming apart. ""The jig is up""  While this is happening, just remember:  If I can see it then it isn't me... so who sees me?  Watch as the mind and body change as the surrounding environment changes.  Watch every movement of the body, every will and volition, every thought and feeling.  Then watch as the surrounding environment change in response to the actions of the mind and body.  Eventually you will notice a ""dance"" that is happening that involves everything... a sort of feedback loop that involves everything."

Mindfulness,38uazf,Eau_de_Zazoom,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:01:40 2015 UTC,"I've experienced the exact same thing. I think you should just keep doing what you're doing. Don't try to ""manage"" (anxiety speak for control) it unless you're incapacitated for a long time or feel really bad for the rest of the day or something. Try to accept the feelings, feel them, be overwhelmed. In my opinion, anxiety has a lot to do with trying to control thoughts and feelings because of a fear of being overwhelmed or not being able to cope. The thing is, everyone gets overwhelmed sometimes. The reason why my emotions get to the point of raw intensity that you're describing is because I'm trying to control and avoid them because I'm afraid I'll be overwhelmed by them. But what's going to happen if I get overwhelmed? Me having an intense crying session isn't a crisis.   I mean, this is my opinion, obviously consult your therapist, but to me the intense emotions are a sign you're doing it properly. This might be the next step of working on your anxiety - allowing yourself to feel intense emotions and ride them out."

Mindfulness,38uazf,CosmicWy,2,Sun Jun 7 04:15:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback. I appreciate it. I agree that I feel more overwhelmed when I try to manage and control anxiety. I think way I've made so much progress with meditation and mindfulness is because I'm not trying to control/judge/label it. I'm just letting it come naturally untouched. Viewing it as part of who I am right now and watching it with out reaction. I think that it why it is so difficult for me right now because I'm going against by bodies normal reactions and I'm completely aware of my feelings and emtion as before I was trying to control/avoid/ or blame them on something else.

They're all just thoughts. Ego is what classifies them as desirable and undesirable. Whatever comes, simply decouple your awareness from the object being perceived and let it run its course. Just be here and now conscious of what is, as a non reactive observer of the unfolding universe..."
Mindfulness,38q6ez,darkthoughts_1,2,Sat Jun 6 02:36:46 2015 UTC,"good question! resisting thoughts tends to entertain them. maybe understanding where they are coming from will help. Our thoughts are a result of our perceptions and our perceptions are a result of the underlying belief. So some homework/headwork could be asking ""Why do I feel this way?"", ""Why am I upset?"". The quick answers don't work, so you ask without entertaining the first responses, generally allowing a deeper response. Judgement is a belief in a right/wrong. Realizing life is GREY, and not easily boxed into right/wrongs, helps to see maybe ""we don't know the truth"" about many things. .... All upsets have a root in a belief. My big one is ""I am not good enough"". From that deep belief comes guilt, shame, false pride, putting others down, having to be right, etc..."

I feel like if you don't entertain your negative thoughts but acknowledge they're there without giving them form, they get weaker just like a rusting metal. Although I know very little about the actual works of the brain, it just makes sense that if you don't feed thoughts, their neural pathways get weaker. Haha, but that's just my 2 cents.

Mindfulness,38m2yy,OnlyGangPlank,3,Fri Jun 5 02:35:25 2015 UTC,"Not the voice, not the thoughts. Use awareness. What is it that allows thoughts to be focused on? What illuminates them? What allows you turn attention towards your senses or thoughts?  An analogy would be a movie scene. When you are moving the camera to various places in the scene, a narrative voice may be there commenting on what is happening. However, you already have the function of the camera, there is no need for the narrator for the camera to work. The various places in the scene - those are various phenomena happening in your body (sensations, sensory contact, thoughts, mental states). The narration is in fact, part of the scene itself. It has nothing to do with the camera. Without the camera, the narration, as well as the various parts of the scene, cannot be encapsulated into the video (your experience of reality).  Do not try to quieten the voice. Instead, recognize it as it is: A verbalized thought. Your attention should be pre-verbal. When you notice a thought transition into another thought, experience it for a moment: What lies in the gap between thoughts? What is this pre-verbal quality? That will be your start."
Mindfulness,38m2yy,refugeinbuddha,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:16:40 2015 UTC,"I think I follow your meaning, I will give it a try.  Makes some sense. One more question which kind of brings up your movie scenario. When doing the body scans I actually move my eyes to where that part would be.  Mentally building an image of the area I'm focusing on.  Is this also a distraction?"
Mindfulness,38m2yy,refugeinbuddha,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:31:01 2015 UTC,"The function of meditation is wisdom. The body of wisdom is meditation. How does one then allow wisdom to arise? That is through absorption. Absorption arises from wisdom, wisdom arises from absorption.   What is this absorption? It is an altered state of consciousness, known as jhana. How does one move into such a state? That is through meeting the conditions of reaching the state.   The conditions for reaching the first jhana is: (1) Sustained, applied one-pointedness. (2) A pleasant feeling, not unlike love, contentment or enjoyment. (3) Tingling pleasure physically or mentally. Having applied attention and sustained it to the point of one-pointedness, factors 2 and 3 will naturally arise. Allowing the factors to grow strong, you then arrive at the first absorption stage.  Hence, the answer to your question is: Mentally building an image is not wrong. By visualizing, you allow the mind to apply attention. By holding the visualization, you sustain the visualization. Now, if you continue to hold your attention on the visualization without distraction, that is one-pointedness. Holding onto that, you will find the two other factors arise. That is where you have entered real mindfulness.  However, moving the eyes does not do anything. Withdraw from the 5-senses, and simply watch what they give your mind. Sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches - all of these are like gateways from the external world to your mind. Deeper still, there is another gate, the thinking mind. Here, thoughts pass. You are not anywhere near the gates. You are the king of the castle. The body is your city wall, the brain is your castle.  If you want to successfully body-scan, then understand that your object of meditation here, is a visualization of your whole body. You are watching the ""touch"" sense-gate, while holding attention on the body. Then develop absorption and you will progress."
Mindfulness,38m2yy,diagonali,3,Fri Jun 5 07:44:55 2015 UTC,"The trick is to allow the voice to be there if it is there - which is easier said than done! Acknowledge it and then bring your attention back to whatever you chose. This can happen over and over and over and over and over and over etc. That's normal. At first you might feel its not going ""well"" or feel your mind is constantly drifting or that you're not doing it ""right"". All is well. Remember that your mind drifting away or becoming aware of an inner voice is quite normal. Just keep folding in awareness to whatever happens and gently guiding your mind back to where you chose it to be in the same way you'd gently put a child back in their playpen over and over. It may well get frustrating but then frustration is just a thought so you can guide your awareness back to where you want it to be from my bat too! Over time, like strengthening a muscle, you may find that your mind wanders a little less from your intended focus. If not, that's OK. There is not necessarily any "" goal"" - the experience itself of being mindful."

It is not something you should worry about, because the feeling is temporary and the things you normally identify with will return as they usually do.  When you have this feeling again, perhaps asking the question ""Is nothingness observed? And if so, who is observing nothingness?"" will lead you towards more insight.  When you are engaged in this process, you are not doing mindfulness as usual. The focus is mainly on the sensation of ""I am"", whatever that may be.

What you are looking at is still a reflection, a grasping - A moon in the water, instead of the moon itself. That is because you conceptualize it as 'emptiness'. 'Emptiness' itself, is a concept that you grasp onto. The moment you have the thought or feeling, ""I am empty"" - You are no longer it. When you are completely non-dwelling, when no thought surfaces, not even ""I am empty"", that is where you simply reside as ""I am"".

Mindfulness,37w06q,Xeroxkx,4,Sat May 30 21:31:34 2015 UTC,"Fixed formatting!  Before I begin I should come out and say that I have an agenda in mindfulness and meditation. I'm sick of feeling anxious. It's a feeling that severely limits me as a person and my ability to be creative and enjoy life in general... I say this because I know that meditation in general is simply about ""being"", and I try to connect with that state during each session, but maybe with such a strong agenda, I'm straying from where I should be...   But that aside, I have a few specific questions that I have accumulated over my last month of practice, which has involved several hours of meditation, but mainly trying to apply mindfulness somewhat forcefully into my life.. Here's the thing though, IT WORKS! Most of the time, anxiety is fleeting if even existent during the average day. But this comes at a price of constant energy being put into my thinking, although the payoff heavily outweighs the work...   But here are my questions:   If I put mindfulness into every aspect of my average day- walking mindfully, talking mindfully, listening mindfully, and even putting the phone down mindfully, hell, even scratching the palm of my hand mindfully; will this add to the overall benefit of the practice?  Will catching stray subconscious-level thoughts and feeling as they arise outside of formal practice and putting them out before they get traction be a good idea? I have been doing this for some times now, and in all honestly, it has actually made me feel better. Is this the idea of the formal practice transferring into real-life?  Will mindfulness make me dumber.. Now hear me out on this... I actually noticed myself being quite more content in life, and for the most part, more creative and spontaneous(but comparing it to my normal state of semi-anxious existence, is like comparing apples and living with anxiety). But the way I understand it is that we should not dwell in the past or venture into the future... But where is the room for thinking there? I kinda get that the thinking about past or future, if at all, should be done mindfully and with paying attention to the thoughts rather than let them spiral down... But again, will thinking less than I do cease some neural pathways(I know almost nothing about neuroscience, so I'm just going off of what I know here, so please don't be too harsh on me here).  Probably the most significant one in my mind... How do I actually be non-judgmental and kind to myself when I don't feel it? I'm actually pretty damn content with things for the most part, but anxiety and insecurities rears their ugly head sometimes and thoughts that are less than wanted creep into my mind... How do I accept these thoughts with welcoming kindness? Even in meditation practice. I realize that I should see them and register them, and let them pass like a leaf down a racing stream, but how do I develop this skill? Formal practice? Or is there anything I can do to enhance it? Detached Observer Meditation... The practice outline can be found here.... http://yogateacher.com/text/meditation/on-line/observation.html ... Is this something that I should engage in as a beginner? It seems somewhat of a polar opposite of formal mindfulness practice. But at the same time, one of my biggest insecurities in the practice is becoming boring and having no ""creative"" thoughts at all.  ""Breathing a solution for a wandering mind... or everything""....  I found that I use breathing and focus on the tip of my nostrils when bad feelings arise.. As per the instruction of many experts I acknowledge that the feelings are there and immediately try to focus on breathing or some other activity... Because.. Hey, I don't want to feel unpleasant! And after many years of dealing with anxiety and constant negative emotions, after finding some peace, I loathe the idea of getting permanently getting pulled back into that fucking spiral of misery. And as I assume all humans do, we see the world through our current state of mind. And although I know I've bounced back many times before, I have a fully rational(in my mind) fear of getting stuck in that place again. I'm sure this is not the way it should be... Mindfulness in relation to very recent events.. So let's say someone said something bad to me, or about me, or whatever. Although nothing like this actually bothers me that much, negative thoughts will surely surface.. I know that I shouldn't dwell on the past... And as defined by Jon Kabat-Zinn(and just about every other expert), mindfulness is being in the present MOMENT... So... Is the end goal to be able to completely disregard very recent events? If I see something that bothers me one second and then look away, should that object not even be registered in my mind anymore? I know this is a bit cryptic of a question, but hopefully it's understandable.    Thank you so much!"

Mindfulness,37w06q,TetrisMcKenna,2,Sun May 31 01:41:57 2015 UTC,"No problem! Here's my advice:   If I put mindfulness into every aspect of my average day- walking mindfully, talking mindfully, listening mindfully, and even putting the phone down mindfully, hell, even scratching the palm of my hand mindfully; will this add to the overall benefit of the practice?   Sure, but don't be hard on yourself if it doesn't quite work out! It's extremely hard to maintain that level of conscious awareness throughout everyday activities, that's why monasteries exist after all. But, every time during the day you notice that you're lost in thought and return focus back, you've done very well. So don't be disappointed if you find you can't keep it up all day - be glad that you managed to catch yourself at least a few times.

But again, will thinking less than I do cease some neural pathways(I know almost nothing about neuroscience, so I'm just going off of what I know here, so please don't be too harsh on me here).    There absolutely is room for thinking. We couldn't do much of what we do day to day without a whole bunch of conscious thought. The problem isn't the thought itself, it's getting too lost in the stories we tell ourselves surrounding the thought, the impulses and desires and craving that the thought triggers due to memory association. So absolutely, if you need to really think about something, do it! Just remember to return to the breath/moment once you've worked out what you needed to.   Probably the most significant one in my mind... How do I actually be non-judgmental and kind to myself when I don't feel it?

I realize that I should see them and register them, and let them pass like a leaf down a racing stream, but how do I develop this skill? Formal practice? Or is there anything I can do to enhance it?   That's the golden question, haha! Try to think of meditation practice as a very slow, passive journey. This will happen naturally, given enough time to mature. It's not something you can really force. The main thing is just to know you're always a few breaths away from peace. When you get irritated, the last thing you'll want to do is meditate. But if you make yourself do it, perhaps even make the irritation/anxiety the focus of your meditation, you'd be surprised how quickly it dissipates.   Detached Observer Meditation... The practice outline can be found here.... http://yogateacher.com/text/meditation/on-line/observation.html[1] ... Is this something that I should engage in as a beginner? It seems somewhat of a polar opposite of formal mindfulness practice. But at the same time, one of my biggest insecurities in the practice is becoming boring and having no ""creative"" thoughts at all.    I've tried a similar technique before, Zen shikantaza. It's surprisingly difficult for what sounds like a simple technique. You have to be already very aware and very mindful to be able to do it successfully, because otherwise your mind just won't notice that you've become distracted. It does work for some people though, so try it out if you want to! /r/nondirective is a sub for that kind of practice. Be careful of flipping between lots of different practice techniques though, the point is to pick and master one, don't spent too long window shopping!

Ah, tell me about it, I started meditating about 5 years ago now due to depression. It still comes back to haunt me, but I feel much more equipped to deal with it. I think the whole point of this stuff is that you can't stop bad feelings and things from arising, but they always pass away, and if you really pay attention to the feeling, you can observe it from a passive, non-aversive point of view, and thus not suffer. Easier said than done, though!   Mindfulness in relation to very recent events.. So let's say someone said something bad to me, or about me, or whatever.

I know this is a bit cryptic of a question, but hopefully it's understandable.    I don't think so. To an extent, maybe. I think the point is not to wallow in past events, not to forget them completely. It would be impossible to operate in the world if we had no memory at all, our bodies would collapse, we would forget how to speak, walk, etc. The trick is using the memory as a tool if and when it's appropriate, and not getting lost in the memories and thoughts when it's not. Mindfulness gives you the key to notice when that's happening, concentration allows you to disrupt the thought pattern.  Best of luck, I can tell you after years of therapy, medication, etc, meditation and Buddhism has definitely given me the toolset I needed all along to deal with this anxiety and depression. It took many years to get a solid grip on it, but that time was all worth it, and I look forward to many new discoveries and insights."
Mindfulness,37w06q,paraprax,2,Sun May 31 11:57:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing your experience. I am pleased to have the opportunity to play some small part in your journey. My experience has been that it is very important to keep exploring and listening to your own experience about what works or does not work for you. Experts can be interesting to listen to, but nobody knows yourself as well as you do. Keep experimenting and checking to see if what you try is getting you closer to your goals.   Speaking of goals - people can practice different forms of mindfulness for different reasons. One goal may be to feel better - that is, to feel less stress and more relaxed. Another goal may be to get better at feeling - that is, to feel emotions as they come and go more fully and without defense (even if this means feeling stressed sometimes). And of course, there are many other sorts of goals in life or relationships that may have nothing at all to do with what one is feeling or not feeling.   Your last question is very interesting - I love that you are asking it. My experience with thoughts is that they are events like any other. If I have a thought about the past, that memory is happening in the present. Sometimes I find it helpful or meaningful to be fully immersed in the memory - feeling all the emotions it brings. Other times I find it helpful just to notice the memory and let it come and go while I focus my attention on other things. It's sort of like choosing to watch a TV show or choosing to just have it on in the background while I focus on something else.   I hope you find this helpful! Most of all I hope you keep exploring these questions and discover a path that works for you."
Mindfulness,37w2bw,culinarygangbang,2,Sat May 30 21:48:23 2015 UTC,"Hey first off it sounds like a lot of really overwhelming and confusing things are happening in your life right now. That's hard, and I'm sorry you're going through that. I think it's great all the work you've done learning these various tools, I've followed a similar path and they're very helpful.  I think perhaps where you might want to focus is to become aware of and confident in the values that you hold. How you want to treat others and be treated. If one of those lines is crossed then with the tools you gained from CBT and mindfulness yes you can understand them and choose to just let it go, but you need to also be aware of the effect that's going to have on you. Mindfulness is not the rejection of your feelings but the awareness of them. Being empathetic and being able to understand why someone would act in a certain way doesn't mean you need to agree with it or let it happen if it's affecting you negatively. It means you can choose your battles correctly where it will be most helpful. If someone is treating you in a way that mis-aligns with your values, where you feel disrespected, you should approach them rationally and calmly about it. If you're turned away as being nagging or overreacting then that is a problem and says something deeper about their communication skills and investment in the relationship. You need to make the call if that misalignment is worth having them in your life. Sometimes it's hard to make that call, but if they are having an overall more negative impact than good then sometimes you need to just move on and surround yourself with people that align with your values better and are of a mostly positive influence.   So no, being mindful does not mean being a doormat. You can aim to be mindful of your feelings as well as other's and stand up for yourself when need be. From what you have said it sounds like your ex is being very selfish and inconsiderate in how he communicates with you these days. It is up to you whether or not the negativity you are getting from the relationship is worth it to you to keep him in your life. Remember, you are never obligated to be someone's friend. You'll keep growing from this and become that much stronger for it. Feel free to reach out to me via PM if you want to talk more. I've been through similar circumstances so I feel I could talk forever about it haha."
Mindfulness,37w2bw,brynkng,1 point,Sun May 31 02:49:19 2015 UTC,"I have no choice but to be calm if I manage to express my feelings. My ex has made sure I can never see him alone. It's also very hard to express myself in this way, I have this habit of laughing when hurt when I'm trying not to cry.  We are no longer friends, his gf insisted he blocked me, they argue about me a lot. However we do see each other still, not deliberately. The way he still looks at me and flirts kills me. I don't know what he is playing at. It makes me stay calm and not tell him how I feel in case there's still a chance. Thank you very much for those words. I really should be better to myself instead of always putting others feelings first. I am quite silly, I even feel guilty that the ex gets a hard time about me from his girlfriend."
Mindfulness,37w2bw,wisekernel,2,Mon Jun 1 10:37:17 2015 UTC,"Great question!! Acceptance, compassion and empathy are huge components of mindfulness, and ones that tend to keep us from losing our tempers because we tend to ""feel"" or understand where others are coming from.  But, it does mean we might need to re-think how we define our boundaries. With less control over our thoughts and feelings, we tend to know where our boundaries are because they show ourselves very emotionally. We get mad, we react, and it plays out from there. When we have these mindfulness skills and are so tuned into others experiences, able to let go of things quickly, or are just less ""phased"" those ""natural"" boundaries might not be there. BUT it doesn't mean we need to be a push-over.  But it also doesn't mean we need to be more angry or reactive again.  To me, the difference is that mindfulness allows us to respond instead of react, but it means we consciously need to ""check in"" and decide how we want to respond. We might feel like the behavious someone shows, we have forgiven and aren't mad about it, but still don't think it is appropriate. It is a GREAT opportunity to sit and have a compassionate, but direct conversation with them about it. We can chose to address it mindfulness, and it often goes better because the response comes from a place of caring rather than defensiveness and aggression - so others are less reactive in response and listen better.  Does that make sense? If it helps, I recently released a video about this EXACT thing here: https://youtu.be/5NEdvVZqWAs  Hope the response helps, but happy to clarify further."
Mindfulness,37w2bw,wisekernel,2,Tue Jun 2 22:01:05 2015 UTC,"It does thank you!  I guess in a way my mindfulness means I haven't reacted yet, which is good, my angry reaction would not be a constructive way of responding. It comes like a wave, then I calm down and realise those would be terrible things to say.  What I am having trouble with is I need that conversation and he is denying me it. I am unable to see him in private, without making a fool of myself (by say turning up at his home like a stalker).  Thanks again, you've given me something to think over."
Mindfulness,37w2bw,darkthoughts_1,2,Thu Jun 4 08:40:33 2015 UTC,"Well, it sounds like you might be best off responding how when it does come up and in the moment, but I am guessing that being mindful can help that come from a place of respect and calm vs. an angry reaction too. However is required to respond best, that is what mindfulness can help you do rather than be as reactive in the moment and swayed by others. In any case, sounds like you're sorting out a plan and will have a mindful response in no time :)   If it helps, you can think of Thich Nhat Hanh or others who have used mindful approaches in activism and speaking out - it certainly doesn't need to be a passive, submissive practice."

Mindfulness,37w2bw,meeeow,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:58:40 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you are struggling with some issues. Reality can be a tough pill sometimes. So one of the things that mindfulness does, is to hopefully open the door of awareness. A favorite saying of mine is ""I am never upset for the reason I think."" Start with a new habit if you can of asking yourself, in times of upset, ""Why am I feeling this way?"" Don't accept the first answers that comes along, your brain will blame others (survival response). As you PAY attention to YOU, you will find ALL upsets come from DEEP within you. For me, it was a ROOT issue of ""I'm not good enough"". Yours may be the same or different, but we all have these ROOT wounds that are triggered all the time by others. Healing YOU is the job, not changing others behavior. People will always be people. Good luck and hopefully I pointed you in a direction that helps.. Peace!"

Mindfulness,37n62m,Xeroxkx,3,Thu May 28 21:27:12 2015 UTC,"Hey there, the short answer is yes.  In fact, meditation is one of only a few techniques that can be used to successfully rewire neural pathways (somewhat) consciously. The way neural pathways work is indeed through habits. The more we think a particular thought, the stronger the neural pathway. That is why as we grow our thinking (and therefore habits, and behaviours, etc.) become more difficult to change, it is because our brains are SO wired to do what we have done before. BUT, with meditation you can choose to consciously think differently than you might otherwise. You can notice your typical thought habits, and develop new habits that create new neural pathways and, with enough practice, those get deeper and deeper while any old habits we move away from become less and less severe in the brain until our brain's tendency becomes to follow the new neural pathways that we have consciously developed.   In addition, there are parts of the brain that have also been shown to change or enhance with specific types of meditation. For example, the insular cortex (or ""insula"") is the part of the brain that helps you perceive what is happening in your body. Body scans have been shown to strengthen and thicken the insula. What they have also found though, is that the insula also plays a significant role in empathy - so a thicker insula also helps us be more empathetic.   These are some of the learnings I have acquired from courses at University of Toronto as well as research done through my Masters in Psychology, so hopfully that helps as a general description but MANY schools - including some really major centres at Harvard and MIT - are continuing brain scan research on this and there is certainly more coming too. I do hope that helps for now though."
Mindfulness,37n62m,wisekernel,2,Fri May 29 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"Strictly from my own personal experience:   I can not avert attention away from anxiety. Instead, I choose to embrace it and accept that there will be strenuous times throughout the day, week, month, year. I do not stress about things I cannot control. I focus on the day. Every morning I wake up around 5:40am and do my routine. Part of my routine is practicing mindfulness and visualizing how my day will go. I try to anticipate potential situations (based on prior experiences) when I visualize my day.  In the event a stressful situation during the day does occur, I'm more equipped to handle it.  I think at the end of the day your ability to embrace uncertainty will dictate how much anxiety your body produces.   I think practicing will certainly help you. It has so far for me. Anxiety in the long run is really non existent to me for a simple reason. I believe that what I do today will dictate how my future shapes up. I don't believe that life is a roll of the dice.    For me, it's just a matter of control. I cannot control the future. But I can control today. I control it by getting up early every morning and doing my daily ritual which includes mindfulness. Now that i'm in the driver seat I create a list of things I need to do for the day. I prioritize and perform. I prioritize with the understanding that things may change or not go exactly how I plan. This is okay because i'm mentally prepared.  This is how I control my day at work.   This in a nutshell is how I control my day. I do this day after day. Soon you come to realize you are in control. This is how If effectively control anxiety and limit the fight or flight response and keep adrenaline and cortisol at bay.  Feel free to message me if you found this helpful or have questions.  Best of luck,"
Mindfulness,37n62m,Ncwinnz4,1 point,Fri May 29 12:00:19 2015 UTC,"hmmm... anxiety, tough one. I think the nice part about mindfulness is you can ask yourself whenever the mind gets frantic ""Where is this coming from?"". recognizing that ""I"" am not my thoughts, but I have thoughts, allows me that little separation I need to ""observe"". Fighting my thoughts has never worked for me, so I try not to. I like asking my brain for different results. ""IS there another choice here?"" The BEST part of mindfulness in terms of peace has been ""becoming aware"" that my mind is a tool and I am not the insane thinking, but that I have a mind that RUNS its own game. That game being ""I will protect you and will do whatever needed to survive"". Kinda like a rabid dog my mind is!  (my experience here)"
Mindfulness,37mdoz,wisekernel,2,Thu May 28 18:05:21 2015 UTC,"I love the concept of how to respond vs. react.  I have listened to quite a few talks on the concept and believe that responding is basically being able to mentally take a step back from a situation and react in a completely objective way without letting our emotions cloud our judgment.    Also, I kind of disagree with your idea of choosing to forgive or not.  In my opinion not forgiving should not be an option.  Here is a quote from Jack Kornfield (where he is actually quoting another story....)  ""Forgiveness is also not for anybody else. Thereâs a story of two ex-prisoners of war. One says to the other, âHave you forgiven your captors yet?â And the second says âNo, never.â And the first one then says âWell, they still have you in prison, donât they?â"""
Mindfulness,37mdoz,glassescontacts,1 point,Sat May 30 01:33:42 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Yes, I really like that way of framing responding vs. reacting. That's what it feels like - a step back, or a little space, I sometimes describe it like.  As for forgiveness, I always recommend forgiveness for true healing but I would argue it is a choice because, in my experience, forgiveness is an active choice. It doesn't often happen without some effort or intention in that direction. Do you know what I mean? Basically, I find you have to decide to forgive for the process to start - so while I agree I think it is a good thing to do (and, despite how some people just relay to it - STILL doesn't mean you need to condone the action itself) I do personally find that it Is a choice to do it."

Mindfulness,37hihc,4thDimensional,4,Thu May 28 12:08:17 2015 UTC,"Anxiety sucks. It's very commendable to have made it this far in three short weeks.  You've gotten a great taste, and yes, the ways you've mentioned are good ones. Any progress away from anxiety is good progress. The thought of ""not making enough progress"" is, in and of itself, an anxious thought that stems from desire. Recognize that. Keep recognizing.   Enjoy the moment, but don't chase it. The act of chasing is desire, and that's not mindfulness.  Good work."

Mindfulness,37hihc,wisekernel,2,Thu May 28 12:43:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know some people that have gotten extremely far on the path with just noting in daily life. E.g. continuously note ""seeing"" + the object you're seeing. ""hearing"" + the object your hearing. ""feeling"" plus the object you're feeling.  If you do this consistently, and I mean consistently for every minute of the day that you're mind doesn't have to be super engaged with some other task, you can rise through the insight knowledges even without formal sitting practice.  They complement each other though."

Mindfulness,3707vq,supraspeed,3,Sat May 23 17:25:57 2015 UTC,"Hey! I might not be the best person to answer this as i'm all about using mindfulness casually.   Mindfulness to me isn't about living in the present ALL the time. I do it as and when I want. Of course it's fine to think about the past and helpful to think about the future. But I like to do casual mindful check-ins with my body and environment to see what's going on. If i find myself caught up in worries about the future, i'll ask myself if i'm happy now and check-in with my present self. Usually I am, and I remind myself to live for this day and not worry about what could potentially possibly happen in the next. I also like to be mindful about specific activities as opposed to everything. To me it isn't a new way to live my life, i bring mindfulness to what i'm already doing when I want to, so its not a case of being mindful 100% of the time.   With activities like brushing your teeth. Yes they're mundane and routine. But whats it like to notice them? Rub your tongue against your teeth beforehand, notice the taste of mint in your mouth, the sensations of brushing, how your mouth looks in the mirror as you brush, maybe if you really think about what you're doing it feels silly, how does it feel to spit?, how does it feel to swill your mouth out with water, how does your tongue feel against your teeth now. It's being aware of things like this that makes these activities less mundane and routine. Maybe mix it up a little bit. Again though, it's your choice to notice this and if you feel like being caught up in your thoughts is more valuable to you as your brush your teeth, thats fine, just notice that! Likewise you could choose to be mindful about something else as you do it!  None of this probably makes sense as i'm typing it on my phone. But what im trying to say is the point of mindfulness is to notice the present moment and hopefully improve your quality of life through simple means. So do whatever benefits present you and don't worry about it ;)."
Mindfulness,3707vq,Hutchstiel,2,Sat May 23 17:46:35 2015 UTC,It makes perfect sense. I'm forever catching myself out when my mind wanders. I'm still schooling myself. Great post!
Mindfulness,3707vq,Flat__Line,1 point,Sat May 23 22:14:52 2015 UTC,"I came to the same conclusion. When you start being mindful on automatized tasks, they are a way more enjoyable"
Mindfulness,3707vq,xikaos,3,Mon May 25 00:48:19 2015 UTC,"For your first question, I think the importance is to mindfully think about the past or future. The problem we run into is we seem to always be unconsciously thinking about the past or future. It's automatic. There's no awareness there. But, you can do it very consciously and with awareness knowing you can always return to the present moment. If you wish to take some time to reflect on the past, do so mindfully. I do this each night when I purposely think about three things that went well that day. It's no longer automatic. If you wish to plan for the future, do so mindfully. I do this in the morning when I make notes of what I want to accomplish today. I put it on paper so I don't have to think about it throughout the day, I can just look at my list after I mindfully planned in the morning.  As for your second question, the fact that these tasks seem boring or tedious is precisely why you should be mindful during them. You are missing a very beautiful experience because you are merely acting in auto pilot. Mindfulness isn't about thinking about what you're doing, it's about being aware of it. You don't need to think about showering, but you can feel how relaxing and pleasant the warm water is, how your feet feel bare against the hard surface, how your shampoo and soap slowly begin to fill your nostrils... brushing your teeth allows you to feel the sensations of your mouth, a sense that is underused outside of eating. When you learn to savor and enjoy the boring aspects of life, you realize how little you need the extravagant aspects. You don't need to be constantly entertained by pleasure. Simply brushing your teeth is enough to make you content and happy. This is why meditation is usually done sitting. If you can be content simply sitting, you can be content doing anything. The rest of life becomes an amazing enhancement to sitting with your eyes closed, breathing. And you have nothing to worry about anymore, because sitting is always enough, and as long as you are alive, you can always sit. The worries about money, success, fame... they can melt away. Those are merely enhancements, nothing intrinsically necesssary. Even a hot shower will be an enhancement, and you can be content without it.   Hope that is somewhat helpful. If you have any more questions, I'd be happy to answer :)"
Mindfulness,3707vq,trevordabomb,2,Sat May 23 18:18:22 2015 UTC,"Hi, I think the other posters said it very well. I would say that it's not about never thinking of the past or future but the practice of Mindfulness is to try and train your mind not to be lost in the past or the future and in turn miss the present moment. The present moment is the only moment we have, it is where life unfolds. So many of us are lost in thought about past regrets or worrying about what may happen in the future. So I think just bringing small moments into your day where you focus on your breath and be present with what is actually happening can be a huge benefit. The purpose of these exercises is to train your mind to be aware of what you are doing so that you are not doing it on automatic pilot, yes these things are routine activities but we use them to train the mind so that we can then be present for the important things like when your child is telling you about their day or if you are out with a friend or at a family wedding that you are fully present to experience them moments instead of being lost in thought or what most of us do these days be lost in your smart phone."
Mindfulness,3707vq,kpower77,2,Sat May 23 21:23:05 2015 UTC,"For your first question: why not reflect on the past in this way:   How did I get here?   and think of the future in this way:   Where will this take me?   Just a suggestion. This is also something I think of from time to time, but those instances can just be doubt and uncertainty. If you catch yourself thinking of the past or future, know that and understand it. See what it brings. See how it comes around. Contemplate its impermanence and how it can be a cause of stress. Thinking about good times is pleasant, but it keeps us obsessed with pleasure. You can see that yourself by being mindful.  For the second: Your mind can think all it wants... but how much better is it to only brush your teeth or drive? It's just like anapanasati, mindfulness of breathing. Sometimes we're too caught up in thinking about things, how they should be, how they shouldn't be, what's good about them, what's not... instead of being attentive to the way things are. So if you're brushing your teeth, you can be aware of the intention, the sounds, the feelings, the tastes, etc."

This is everyone's issue so you are not alone. We all want to be thought of well, and in a sense ""look good"". What you may not know, is that EVERYONE else, IS too busy worrying about what YOU think about them, that they are not even thinking about YOU at all. You can barely get someone to listen to what we have to say, never mind judging you. It's a SELF projection that we do. Our mind projects our thoughts onto other people constantly. Half of the people will dislike you anyways, just because miserable people hate people that are not. The other half are too busy looking good to notice you, Seriously... You are doing awesome! just keep the awareness going. Let thoughts just go by, trying to stop them is resistance, just let them come almost like a movie, floating by on a screen..."
Mindfulness,36pu1d,darkthoughts_1,2,Thu May 21 12:32:39 2015 UTC,"I can't seem to stop judging my own thoughts aside from hiding from them by focusing my attention on something else.   It sounds like you have made some real progress in terms of being more present and accepting of what is going on (inside and out) in the moment.  It also seems (from what I quoted) that you are still struggling with judgements that your mind produces.  Judgments can be treated like any other sort of thought; in other words, there's no need to stop judging your thoughts, and trying to stop is just one more bit of struggle that you can observe mindfully.  Instead of trying to not judge, just notice that a judgment is present in the mind, (you might label it ""judging, judging"") and return to whatever it was that was going on (and which produced a judgment).   It's not judgments that are problematic, per se; it's getting caught up with them, either by mindlessly accepting them or by entering into a struggle with them."

What makes it so important to immediately pick something about a person or thing and then make a split second decision whether it's worth more thought? Well my friend maybe there is no need to question it and, as you are trying to do, just accept it as it is. This thing is that way. That thing is this way. I am this way. She is that way.

Mindfulness,36pr2w,many-the-miles,2,Thu May 21 03:36:58 2015 UTC,"I am happy to see you are observing. Mindfulness is so you learn that your mind is a tool. Your thoughts are generated by your mind. YOU are not your thoughts. You are what's behind the thoughts so to speak. That quiet observing, meditating, sense behind the chatter. Now emotions are a response to feelings you have. Learning to understand WHERE the emotion is coming from (by being aware of your thoughts, may lead you to the ROOT of WHY you feel a certain way.) So maybe next time you get upset you ask yourself, ""where is this coming from?"" Practicing mindfulness will give you a clearer idea of where the feelings and emotions are coming from. Here's a hint ""WE are never upset for the reason we think"" In order for your mind to protect you, it will MAKE you focus on an external thing. Upsets are always a feeling of attack in some form. Our brain/mind has a job, protect to survive."
Mindfulness,36pr2w,darkthoughts_1,1 point,Thu May 21 13:11:07 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is wonderful.  Thank you.  All the things you say make so much sense, but I'm having difficulty putting them in to practice.    I've been upset/depressed for some time.  So, I'm having difficulty identifying where an emotion starts and comes from because it feels to me like I'm experiencing emotions of sadness, fear, doubt, and anxiety almost all of the time.  If I can't see a clear start to the emotions, then do you have a suggestion on how I can get to the root of what is causing them?"
Mindfulness,36pr2w,darkthoughts_1,2,Thu May 21 14:11:15 2015 UTC,"the word ""why"" is your friend here... ""why am I so sad?"" And don't fall for the first answer... leave it unanswered... Every time you settle for the easy response from you mind, you get further away... Just SIT with not knowing..That's the first REAL step, which is to realize (see, become aware) that you DO NOT KNOW the answer. EVERY thought and reason you have had, has led you to this point! (which is confusion,sadness, depression, etc... Right?) So you can't think your way out of this... You'll have to go deep to find WHERE all this stuff is coming from... // An example of my journey: I used to get really upset when my partner would make a criticism on something I was doing. I'd be out cleaning our pool and she would tell me how to use the brush on the bottom. I would get REALLY upset at her and maybe even scream at her, angrily saying ""I know what I am doing!!!"" My brain would tell me it was her fault for butting in on what I was doing, and I was right in that! ..... After a year or so, practicing this, I dug deep into WHY I got angry at her offering ""suggestions and help"". What I became aware of was the feeling that when she said that, I felt that, ""I was not good enough"" Out of that ROOT sense of myself, came the anger and hurt. After seeing this about me, I could start to OWN this and all the feelings and attitude that came out of this inner wound. Mindfulness helped me catch myself and not put this issue on anyone else. I started to own it, and make peace with it. I no longer allow ""I""m not good enough"" to run my life!!"
Mindfulness,36l7n7,trauma_gland,2,Wed May 20 05:12:03 2015 UTC,"It's wonderful to have likes, wants, desires. Mindfulness ALLOWS you to observe what the mind/brain DOES with them. If a person,place, or thing becomes too big, we call it an addiction. After practicing WATCHING what your brain does during these ""distractions"", you can move towards having a choice. mindfulness will give you a gift, of seeing what your mind does. Once you see that you have a CHOICE, you can now decide whether ""this person.thing,etc.."" deserves the power you are giving it."
Mindfulness,36l7n7,darkthoughts_1,2,Wed May 20 12:58:40 2015 UTC,"OK, but what's with attachment? Our mind will be getting attached, but we'll be able to control it and decide to get rid of all of them, right?  I just started reading Mindfulness in Plain English for the second time (first time I ended after ""what meditation IS"" chapter) and it feels very extremist. No good things, no bad things (because only neutral things are left), no attachment to the future/past... I've read some stuff about this here and there and still feel like something's wrong with this!"
Mindfulness,36l7n7,Pand9,2,Wed May 20 15:51:17 2015 UTC,"You can't THINK your way here... the whole point of this stuff is to DISCONNECT from your thinking. Look, You have a brain, and you also have a hand. They are PARTS of you. Your BRAIN is whats thinking, chattering, etc.. Understand that YOU (the you who feels) is not YOUR brain. However you USE your brain, with language to figure out life. Your brain's job is to insure your survival!! That's why it does all this chatter (mostly about threats, real or imagined) These thoughts of attachment are because you have told your brain that you need this to survive!! Follow me? So your brain goes into PROTECT mode because you have fed the brain with ""I need this"". Your brain works actually very good! WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE THOUGHTS YOU HAVE ARE NOT YOU, JUST RAMBLINGS OF YOUR MIND."
Mindfulness,36l7n7,darkthoughts_1,1 point,Wed May 20 16:21:04 2015 UTC,"Good question! Honestly, I think for me I just started to see that it was the attachment that was causing me suffering. I started to become more and more familiar with what ""attachment"" feels like for me and so now I recognize it better and when it comes up, I know my want is still important to me, but I work to let go of my attachment itself. Specifically, I tend to look at why it means so much for me and consider other ways I could get that or a similar feeling that ARE within my control. I also examine why I feel such a need for that feeling and can sometimes even just come to terms with it like that. I also started to keep reminding myself that ""everything is perfect. Life is more perfect than I can understand. So if it doesn't work out the way I expect it is because there is something else that is a better fit for me in the future."" and that helps me let some of it go. ALSO, i found that concept of ""fit really helped overall. It helped me accept that if something DOESN'T happen it is pretty much always because it isn't actually a fit for me or what I need right now. Essentially, I just decided to keep trusting the universe and the fact that nature/the universe knows a LOT more than I do so it will take care of me way better than I can myself. All different ""meditations"" or feelings I have practiced cultivating or explored while sitting, and all helped in their own way. In the end, it was the attachment I found I let go of - not the ""thing"" it self, but without attachment I was was able to just honour that ""thing"" as ""special to me"", and acknowledge that, rather than something I was desperate for.  In some ways, it was realizing that I am me, I am fine, I am whole and NOTHING outside of me can change that. That was a big part of it too.  Sorry it is a bit of a ramble here, I haven't tried to articulate my thinking on this best. Again, GREAT question!"
Mindfulness,36fe23,shadowsage14,5,Mon May 18 23:26:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I soon learned to recognize this negative self-talk, and soon I learned a trick that changed everything in my life: I would imagine that a negative thought was a bug, and I would vigilantly be on the lookout for these bugs. When I caught one, I would stomp on it (mentally of course) and squash it. Kill it dead. Then replace it with a positive one.   This one is kind of a mindfulness 'anti-pattern' isn't it?"
Mindfulness,36fe23,ashooner,4,Tue May 19 20:33:35 2015 UTC,"It sounds more like CBT than mindfulness to me.  Mindfulness would just be to acknowledge the thought, acknowledge how it makes you feel, but be ok with that and not have anxiety about it.  lol, maybe?  I don't really know."
Mindfulness,36fe23,glassescontacts,1 point,Tue May 19 23:33:30 2015 UTC,"That's my practice, and it really was an important distinction to me. Being aware of negative thoughts wasn't new to me, it was the idea of accepting them rather than fighting with them (as this article recommends) that made a difference."

Mindfulness,36efye,link_driquor,2,Mon May 18 19:18:06 2015 UTC,"CBT will naturally have mindfulness...all of a sudden, you are tasked with paying attention to your thought, feelings, actions--and how they influence each other.  Mindfulness is about purposeful direction of your attention, rather than being at the mercy of it all the time.  So practice putting and holding your attention on things, and notice how difficult it is and when you've lost it, then bring it back."
Mindfulness,36efye,VanCounsellor,2,Mon May 18 21:22:20 2015 UTC,"This is just my 2 cents, take what you like and leave what you don't. I am not qualified in anything! Our thoughts and perceptions come from our brain. We HAVE a brain like we have a hand. If you had no language, would you have thoughts? You wouldn't, all you would have is feelings. So thoughts are a product of language and the brain and your thoughts are NOT YOU. There is a YOU in the quietness BEHIND the thoughts as they wander across the brain. Try to find that quietness by just allowing the thoughts to come and go. Every time your mind grabs one, let it go. Just continue to practice letting the thoughts come and go, the less you give them attention, the less power they have... That quietness in between the thoughts is you, without the chatter. It's there that your peace and wonder of life exist."
Mindfulness,36efye,darkthoughts_1,1 point,Mon May 18 23:51:50 2015 UTC,"It's best to start out simple. There are lots of resources, YouTube videos, and podcasts about mindfulness meditation, but don't spend a lot of time studying and just do it. Make it a daily thing, and enjoy it. Everything else will come in time. Be in the moment and learn how to find a place for yourself free from your worries and anxieties from the past and in the future."
Mindfulness,36efye,allltogethernow,1 point,Mon May 18 20:58:04 2015 UTC,"So glad you came here! To attempt to qualify myself: I'm a psychology undergraduate student and I plan on pursuing my PhD. I took a course this recent semester in Counseling and Psychotherapy. I am very pleased to see your post as I'm sure your therapist may have taught you that activation and initiative are incredibly powerful tools to use to battle anxiety and depression, so it's wonderful to notice that you're on the right track. Keep that up.  But after that extended side note, I personally have suffered with a minor-moderate depression in past instances, and find that mindfulness (largely aided by meditation) helps me to better understand how I think - as I am constantly focused on what I think - and to, if I find necessary, more easily adjust my thinking patterns or thought processes in a way than benefits me cognitively, which in turn increases my sense of well-being.  As for tips on general mindfulness practice, I personally, after noticing I'm not being very mindful, begin to focus on the sensations of my body. Sometimes I do this sense-by-sense, usually beginning with sound. So for example, I focus on listening. After I notice all the subtle and detailed sounds of the room that I probably wasn't specifically noticing before, I work on ""catching up"" all of my other senses, so to speak, until my thoughts are slow and in-the-moment. From there, I personally notice a sort of slower, relaxed, and easily-managable thought process. This is my personal practice and I'm sure yours won't be exactly the same, but the point is that being mindful is an activity that requires practice.  Mindfulness is a beautiful practice but it's beauty may take a while to blossom. Be patient and continue your diligence."
Mindfulness,36efye,CookinMeth69,1 point,Mon May 18 21:18:22 2015 UTC,"So, in the long run, do you think a commitment to mindfulness supercedes CBT practices? I only ask because I also started out with both, but lately I've been less motivated to go back to my CBT books. I feel like I don't need them anymore. The whole practice of meditation and mindfulness is so much deeper and more... interesting, I guess."
Mindfulness,36efye,allltogethernow,1 point,Fri May 22 00:20:52 2015 UTC,"I would still say that CBT supercedes mindfulness. Mindfulness is a lovely practice, but it is a practice used as a tool in the overall education-process that is CBT."

I am much more calmer than what I use to be. 2. I enjoy the finer things in life being fully present. 3. My thought pattern has changed and I can let small things go which clog up white space in my head.  Great place to start is body scan as it helps train your brain to focus if you're mind wanders.   Don't get me wrong, I can still have crap days, but I can clearly define triggers now. Still a process to work through these but it is getting better. Exercise helps, even if it's just a walk around the block.   Good luck and awesome stuff on making a start"

Mindfulness,3635vr,jrcarney52,5,Fri May 15 18:37:26 2015 UTC,"Stifling desire is not the same as complete indifference. It is about accepting reality as it is. We can still work hard toward something, we just aren't attached to the outcome. Even pleasurable things can be worked toward, we just remove the disappointment if pleasure cannot be achieved. Getting rid of desire doesn't mean you sit around and do nothing. It just means you are happy no matter what life throws at you. Look at monks. They have stifled desire but they work very hard each day and they practice to work toward nirvana. But they aren't attached to the fruits of their labor or to reaching nirvana. They are content even if they never reach nirvana or if their labor yields nothing. It's not about stopping what you're doing, it's just about not being attached to the expectations of your doing."

Mindfulness,3635vr,darkthoughts_1,2,Sat May 16 00:18:36 2015 UTC,"Not always. No. When dealing with many people, you're gonna have to find the middle ground between yourself and others. You have to stick up for yourself and not yield to others' desires all the time.   You have a desire that comes from within. Is it something that you need in your life? Is it important to you?    If the answer is yes, then you're fighting for yourself. (even though your desire isn't actually 'you' in the same way your current mentality isn't 'you'. I'm labeling 'yourself' as 'you' as a person for the sake of this example) If the answer is no but you're still fighting, then you're fighting yourself just for the sake of fighting.  If the answer is truly no, then you can give it up.    There's obviously a lot more to it than this. I'm only stating this as a small example, but it's a lot better to be more specific. Every situation is different and should be handled accordingly."

Mindfulness,35tyi1,TetrisMcKenna,3,Wed May 13 15:33:53 2015 UTC,"Well then may I suggest your position is not that mindfulness is bullshit, but the hype around mindfulness is bullshit. I agree with the later. Society/media/talking heads and mental health culture have turned mindfulness (being a very specific type of meditation) into some all encompassing cure all. I do however ask you to acknowledge the difference between the everything is bullshit proclamation you made and a long term mindfulness meditation practice. The most ironic thing is that, at least part of, the goal of mindfulness meditation is to rid one's self of ""hype"".   Edit:clarity."
Mindfulness,35tyi1,darkthoughts_1,3,Wed May 13 16:14:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. To me, mindfulness is what arises after long periods of consistent meditation practice. It's not a technique in and of itself, in my opinion, it's just what happens when you become more aware of your thought patterns. There's a kind of danger or at least an ego-trap in the current use of mindfulness. It's not something you can just switch on like, 'well ok, I'm gonna be mindful from now on!' because without a strong practice you're just never gonna notice when it slips and you end up behaving in a reactionary, instinctive way."

First do not worry, if anything mindfulness taught me to be kind and mild towards myself. I cannot know what type of exercises you will get, but remember that you can always decide to step outside for a few minutes. Inform your trainer and other attendants about your feelings and anxieties beforehand when introducing yourself. This will relieve you of your secret and gives them an opportunity to guide you. Do not worry allow for yourself to feel free to do what you want.  Love and all the best."

Mindfulness,35ix8u,welcome2erf,2,Mon May 11 02:08:34 2015 UTC,I think the first thing they usually say is to loosen your attachment to outcomes and expectations.

Mindfulness,35ix8u,CryptoGreen,2,Sun May 10 23:36:44 2015 UTC,"Hey, I have also suffered a lot of anxiety, depression, and OCD throughout my life and I'm coming up on a year of meditation/mindfulness. At first it was daunting for me. I didn't feel like I could handle sitting in silence with myself and thought I would totally lose it. Over time, I've come to find some peace in the silence. In fact, it helps me bring compassion, patience, and calm to the rest of my life.   While some forms of meditation involve silent concentration, not all do, and I would suggest that you start with something less intense. Guided meditation has worked much better for me (where one person speaks to the rest of the group, who are silent). My favorite practice is metta (loving kindness) meditation, which has helped me enormously in cultivating the self-compassion I've lacked for most of my life.   I don't know what might come up in your mindfulness session because there are so many varied approaches. Is this specifically mindfulness therapy, or an open group? Either way I second the suggestion to talk to the leader of the group in advance and voice your concerns. It's up to you whether you tell the rest of the participants. But I would hazard a guess that they will welcome you either way, and that they want compassion and peace for you.   Any mindfulness practice is going to involve sitting with your inner self and acknowledging whatever thoughts and feelings you find. I know firsthand how dark and panic-inducing OCD thoughts can be and how intense it can be to confront them. But this is something you practice within yourself, and you can take it as fast or as slow and with as many breaks as you want. Feel free to open your eyes, stand up, or move away from the group if you need to. If all you do for your first session is breathe and tell yourself ""I'm safe here, it's going to be okay"" that is perfectly fine. Your mindfulness practice starts wherever you are, and hopefully it moves forward from there."

Mindfulness,35ix8u,wisekernel,1 point,Wed May 13 03:35:02 2015 UTC,"The tricky thing is that different people experience meditation differently. But, what I find really helps is just knowing that if you have trouble being still, that's ok, do what you need to do to try your best. If you have trouble focusing on your breath, you're not alone, when you notice t wanders come back and try again. If you are unsure of what might come up, know you can always try and just focus on the coolness of the air when you inhale and warmth when you exhale or you can imagine filling your belly with air like it is a balloon that you inflate then slowly let the air out of. If you have trouble with that too, that's ok, just try your. Basically, you can't do it wrong so just notice whatever you need and be gentle with yourself.   Also, if it helps and if you feel comfortable you can also let your teacher know you are nervous about the experience and it is your first meditation and sometimes that helps, especially with anxiety. I know I appreciate it as a teacher so I can make anxious clients are adequately supported. But if you don't feel comfortable, I hope this other info helps."

I became aware of the practice just yesterday, thought it might help me with some difficulties I'm having and decided to do some reasearch.  I decided it wasn't bullshit, had nothing to lose and looked up some youtube videos.  I found one that was sort of a guided session going through the basics...focus on your breathing, your body, the parts that contact the ground...that was all fine.    Then it got into taking the feelings you had inside you and trying to accept those, making them a part of you.  It got a little wild.  I was having actual physical reactions, muscle spasms, anxiety spikes.  I had to take a break.  I think I went a little too far down the rabbit hole on my first trip and decided to pull myself out of it for a bit.  The good news for you is that it was really not difficult to pull out of the dive.  I opened my eyes, shook off the spasms and just sort of returned to my baseline neutral state of mind pretty easily.  So my advice, for what little it's worth...is start slow, stop if you need to and just give it a try.  There's nothing to lose and potentially a lot to gain.  I'm going to try again tomorrow, a little slower."

Mindfulness,35ab9i,shadowsage14,4,Fri May 8 13:00:29 2015 UTC,"For those who don't like long drawn out lists -  1. Focus on the present moment, the now, consider the future & gain foresight on your goals.  2. Treat yourself like you would a best friend, if you fall down, help yourself up. 3. Utilize patience to your advantage as a resource and shape change. 4. Position thoughts/sentences in an uplifting manner. Think of the Do instead of the Don't. 5. Understand your purpose to gain perspective & explore mastery. 6. Be the creator/master of your schedule, it's your time, utilize it. 7. Be engaged and promote collaboration when necessary 8. Your neighbor and you are in the same boat, you can shake the boat and yell at each other. In the end though, unless you both pick up a paddle, the waves will force you with the tide."

Mindfulness,359p53,redderrida,5,Fri May 8 07:36:03 2015 UTC,"I've gone through what ur describing so I cannot tell you that it's possible to completely avoid the dark side of meditation.   But... I've figured out for myself the ways in which i can be mindful without having to be depressed.  Basically what I've noticed is if my meditation gives me higher levels of ecstasy/bliss I tend to feel good for a while and what comes next is the dark pit of doom and gloom. The higher I go the lower I fall. I suspect this has something to do with neurotransmitters and the fact that I have a bit of a gut problem. Also read up on the subject of neurotransmitter receptor down regulation.  So my advise for you is to not do any closed eye meditation sessions until your brain chemistry stabilizes. Try mindful walking. Don't focus on things. Just be aware of what is. Any kind of intentional mental activity you do with your mind such as concentrating, accepting, etc. is food for the ego. Let things be, just as they are. Even the bad mood. Just let it be. Simply know that it exists. Let go.   It also helps to internalize the fact that nothing you ever do is going to make it go away or make it better. In fact ""not doing"" and ""simply knowing"" is what makes a difference in the long run.   This might also help: https://instagram.com/p/2M-FfUCaWd/"

Mindfulness,359p53,oochd,3,Mon May 11 14:34:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm, have you just before been experiencing practice getting very easy, almost going by itself? Maybe some strange energetic phenomena, seeing lights, etc?   Reason I'm asking is that on the Progress of Insight you tend to go through such a stage at some point (called the Knowledge of Rising and Passing Aways), and then as you keep making progress you go through the Knowledges of Suffering, which can be about as fun as they sound.  However it could also be regular depression for whatever external reason.  Check out http://integrateddaniel.info/book/ for one of the best descriptions of this territory.  The good news is: you're actually making progress! (even though it might feel that things are actually getting worse)"
Mindfulness,359p53,throwaway,1 point,Fri May 8 08:13:40 2015 UTC,"hey, I'll be honest, looked up the book, but found it a bit too much of a handful right now, so I didn't get into it, sorry. Meditation was going easy for me before, in fact, I developed a bit of an addiction too. I could easily meditate in a crowded airport. Now it's a struggle, as if the moment has become somewhat weak. I don't know how to describe the feeling, I guess I'm too distracted."
Mindfulness,359p53,Gizank,3,Mon May 11 14:38:35 2015 UTC,"I also know that being non-judgemental and self-compassionate is part of mindfulness, but the thing is, one of my major patterns is being judgemental. Accept being judgemental, but be non-judgemental - how?    Shame & Acceptance:   Often we keep ourselves back or hold ourselves back because we have a very limited notion of what we're capable of. This is where low self-esteem or an unskillful sense of shame can be debilitating. But as with so many other things, there's a skillful sense of shame and an unskillful sense of shame. Unskillful shame is what keeps you where you are: the idea that ""I can't get any better than I am; I'm pretty hopeless.""  That kind of shame the Buddha never encouraged. What he did encourage is your willingness to look at what you've been doing to and see where it's been unskillful. When you do this, you are passing judgment. But you're passing judgment on your actions, not on yourself. Your intentions in the past may have been unskillful, or the actions may have been unskillful, but you're not stuck there. Just because you've had unskillful intentions doesn't mean that you're always going to have unskillful intentions. You can change your mind. You can change your habits.  The skillful or healthy sense of shame comes in here and says, ""What I did in the past is nothing to be proud of, but I don't have to repeat that mistake."" This is what your powers of judgment are good for. We tend to think of judgment as what a judge does in a courtroom, passing a final verdict on people, either setting them free or sending them off to jail. The Buddha, however, is not talking about final judgment of that sort. What he advises is more like a craftsman judging a work in progress: ""How is it going? What can be changed? If it's not going well, what can I do to improve it?"" That kind of judgment is healthy. It's necessary, because people with no sense of shame, no sense of judgment, are dangerous to themselves and to the people around them because they refuse to correct their mistakes.  So learn how to use your sense of shame in a skillful way, to use your sense of judgment in a skillful way, and be willing to push yourself beyond your comfort level to find resources that you haven't yet tapped. After all, we all have the potential for awakening. The qualities that the Buddha developed on the night of his awakening, or leading up to his awakening, are qualities that we all have in a potential form: mindfulness and alertness; heedfulness, ardency, and resolution. These things can be developed. If we think that we're here just to accept the way we are, we're not accepting the fact that we could develop these qualities."
Mindfulness,359p53,Quantumfog,3,Fri May 8 16:23:03 2015 UTC,"Your patterns, motives and feelings are not written in stone.  While the past is gone, it is still in your power to change how you act and react right now, as each 'now' happens.    Accepting is not about saying, ""Well, I'm just like this and can't change.  I have to just accept it.""  Acceptance is about accepting things like, things you've already done and can't change now. (Fighting yourself about the past you can no longer change is regret and depression, focused on the past.)  It's not about accepting that you will behave a certain way in the future because that's just your pattern. ( That's worry and anxiety, focused on the future.)  Acceptance is more like, ""Okay, I have this tendency, and beating myself up about it is doing more harm than good.  I can accept that my habit is this for now, and I can work toward changing that through my awareness and behaviors.  I can recognize these things in the moment and adjust for a better way.""    You aren't stuck with your patterns, but fighting against them with self judgement and no intention to change will cause you suffering.  That's more avoidance than acceptance.  You can use your awareness to be mindful of how these patterns, tendencies, feelings, and motives manifest in your moment-to-moment life and begin to adjust in gentle, compassionate ways.  You can start catching yourself in those patterns and note them, label them, but don't judge yourself over them.  You can even tell yourself to stop, but calling yourself names over it would be harmful.     I am suffering depression right now, myself.  I went back to my therapist yesterday after doing quite well for several months.  The strongest tools we work with are mindfulness and gently steering choices in the moment.   I lost sight of this and got overwhelmed with my situation.  Most of what's going to help me is accepting what I can;t change without judging myself and working on things I can do in my situation to be kinder to myself and control what I do have influence over.    Sorry if this is unclear,  I'm about to run out for a meeting, but I wanted to try and help you see that you are not stuck with these things.   Don't accept things you don't want to be part of your life, but also don't beat yourself over things that have already come and gone.  Reply or PM me if you want any of that clarified or expanded on.  Just know you are not bad, and you are not stuck in any permanent way.  It can be difficult to see sometimes, but you are beautiful and able to change any patterns you find in your life."

Mindfulness,359p53,darkthoughts_1,2,Fri May 8 11:32:29 2015 UTC,"Hi there. It sounds like mindfulness has been really challenging for you in many ways, sorry to hear that. It is true that mindfulness really can make you aware of exactly what is within, good or bad. So for those with mental health challenges, it can shine a light on that too. But it is really important that you also notice your own wanting to fix it, change it, get rid of the bad, have more of the good. That's super natural AND know that not everyone is aware of THAT part. So good work.  Now, actually being LESS judgemental about those feelings, ACTUALLY moving away from wanting to change them and into a place of truly accepting IS really hard. It is a practice. A few things I have found that help, are actually trying to go into the feeling or emotion (with caution). Sometimes, just being ""with"" a problem can help create some ease. Second, self-compassionate problem solving techniques can help you notice your thoughts that are tied to some of your feelings, and find alternate perspectives (a little like the ""validity-testing"" that CBT does, though it can be quite different at times too). Third, I often find it is better to consider what you want to move into rather than what you want to change/escape from. So positive outcomes visualizations, self-compassion meditations, forgiveness meditations can all help in their own way too.  Another thing I have found helpful is a bit of mindful journaling around what is GOOD about your negative feelings/depression. I know that seems odd, but there are always a positive if you can really think about it. What IS good about it? How DOES it protect you/serve you? That can help release some of the resistance to things.  As for being less judgmental/riding yourself of the want to change, I find that just does take time and trying to KEEP coming back to just noticing and ""acknowledging"" or ""labelling"" what is going on, practice in continuing to just be aware of your own judgements, acknowledge them, and on your next breath trying to come up with a more ""neutral"" label for what is going on. Again and again, until it may slowly shift on its own.   I do have free, guided versions of the meditations described above on YouTube that I am happy to share if you feel they could be helpful (I just try not to otherwise, so I am not acting self-promotionally) but if I really think it can help someone I mention it because why keep them a secret if I really think they can help right? Let me know if you want the link and otherwise, I hope that helps even a bit. It isn't easy to balance all these different things, especially at first, but it can improve with time and patience."
Mindfulness,359p53,angryrika,2,Fri May 8 21:30:29 2015 UTC,"You're doing just fine! All normal...  We can't change anything unless we know it. Learning about yourself and the ROOT of your Re-actions will lead to becoming more Action oriented. Once I learned why I was so jealous (the root of it was I was afraid of losing because I felt less-than) I stopped beating other people up, for what was MY issue. Once you see YOUR behavior as the ROOT of the problems, you can no longer blame others and you begin to GET IT.  As for judgmental-ness Look at WHY you judge???  I judged others because I (thought) think I know more, or know better, etc... I used judgement as a way to make myself feel better about myself. If I judge YOU, then I must be better than you, right? See ?"
Mindfulness,359p53,sunweaving,2,Sun May 10 01:32:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is what happens when you create a ""me"" around these mental habits. You get stressed out and start lamenting about how you're a bad person, etc.  It's important to remember that we do bad things because we don't see their harm on a fundamental level. It's good that you're seeing the harm in these things. If you value your well-being, then you just need to stop doing those things. If the mind comes up with some unwholesome intention, you can try to understand the intention (i.e. how it arises, how it ceases) and think of the effect that it will have on yourself or others. Knowing that it will cause harm, you can decide: ""I shouldn't do that"". Then you may think, ""what would be a better intention that would lead to my well-being or the well-being of others?"". Remember the three roots of unskillful action: greed, aversion, and delusion.  It's also worth reflecting, as the Buddha taught:   'I am the owner of my actions (kamma), heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and have my actions as my arbitrator. Whatever I do, for good or for evil, to that will I fall heir'...  ""[This is a fact that] one should reflect on often, whether one is a woman or a man, lay or ordained...  ""Now, based on what line of reasoning should one often reflect... that 'I am the owner of my actions (kamma), heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and have my actions as my arbitrator. Whatever I do, for good or for evil, to that will I fall heir'? There are beings who conduct themselves in a bad way in body... in speech... and in mind. But when they often reflect on that fact, that bad conduct in body, speech, and mind will either be entirely abandoned or grow weaker...  ""A disciple of the noble ones considers this: 'I am not the only one who is owner of my actions, heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and have my actions as my arbitrator; who â whatever I do, for good or for evil, to that will I fall heir. To the extent that there are beings â past and future, passing away and re-arising â all beings are the owner of their actions, heir to their actions, born of their actions, related through their actions, and live dependent on their actions. Whatever they do, for good or for evil, to that will they fall heir.' When he/she often reflects on this, the [factors of the] path take birth. He/she sticks with that path, develops it, cultivates it. As he/she sticks with that path, develops it and cultivates it, the fetters are abandoned, the obsessions destroyed."""

I have heard of many instances where mindfulness makes big differences for company. In fact, a teacher I had in ""mindful leadership"". named Maria Gonzalez, teaches from an organizational leadership perspective and cites mindfulness meditation as what made a HUGE difference in her ability to more successfully negotiate business acquisitions and mergers better than most others (as evidenced by her closing and successful tradition records).   In fact, Google has a mindfulness program for business leaders called ""Search Inside Yourself"" that has gotten quite a bit of attention.   In any case, it is also a controversial concept. For one, there is a tendency to ""water down"" the core concepts of mindfulness for use in the workforce. Second, there are ethical questions about whether we could be using something that is meant to promote balance, peace, compassion for the purposes of productivity, profit and increased effort from employees. On the other hand, those last benefits are often the ""hooks"" for businesses to introduce mindfulness and the other compassion/peace, etc. benefits can still be there, so is it just a more realistic way to introduce those things through a bit of a ""back door""? Interesting and important questions I think."

One old marketing saying is ""Sell them what they want, give them what they need."" I don't mind some sizzle as long as it's fulfilled well. The way I first looked into mindfulness was from a psychological benefits-only point of view because I wasn't interested at the time in any spiritual aspects. I think it should be different hooks for different people and groups.   I kind of worry about it getting sold out someday.

Mindfulness,34yjmc,AndersLindman,1 point,Tue May 5 17:00:06 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.  The mind can create monsters of ideas sometimes that literally manipulate the body. While being aware of these feelings without trying to get caught up in them (ie. return to the breath, confirm security in being) there is a sense of resolution and relaxation. We are exposing fear for what it actually is, whatever it may be.  Once we have eliminated the response to fear, we can focus on its origin. Sometimes it requires us to do something or change a habit. Perhaps this is the most difficult part, but it really is the same process continued into daily life.  However, I don't believe that fear can be eliminated entirely. It is a legitimate response to many situations and shouldn't be repressed if at all possible. In fact, even with mindfulness, it might be useful to just respond and deal with what happens."
Mindfulness,34yjmc,bonamens,1 point,Tue May 5 21:32:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, fear is useful as a protection mechanism. So to replace useful fear (as opposed to irrational fears) a better response is needed. A little boy burning his finger on a candle flame will respond to that experience with fear and then later when he gets older he replaces the fear with knowledge and experience.  Removing fears with mindfulness then needs to be done together with knowledge and experience so that the useful fear can be replaced with a more effective response."

Mindfulness,34tvc8,tbswsu,2,Mon May 4 14:55:23 2015 UTC,"Having tried both, I can say for sure that the drugs only delay the problem. Mindfulness allows a person to confront a defect in consciousness from the inside, and in my experience the drugs (SSRIs) seemed to make this confrontation impossible.  However this line from the 'Interpretation' part of the study:   We found no evidence that MBCT-TS is superior to maintenance antidepressant treatment for the prevention of depressive relapse in individuals at risk for depressive relapse or recurrence.   ..seems to re-frame the title of the reddit post in the manner that medical professionals will interpret it. Sadly the meds are likely cheaper and easier to give a person than therapy. But even despite this, it is good that clinical science is gradually becoming more interested in mindfulness!"
Mindfulness,34vuj0,h0rak,1 point,Mon May 4 23:58:09 2015 UTC,"I'd like to emphasize one danger of mf & flow. An issue I have as a psychotherapist using mindfulness with clients is that when they expect flow to happen and yearn for it they tend to be on the watch for that ""good things will start happening automatically"" phenomenon. It's is a certain difficulty as the role of mindfulness is to break habitual and automatic patterns, so if you're constantly checking ""am I in flow yet?"" then you'll sacrificing contact with the present moment for more verbal stuff and varying levels of attachment to certain imagined ways of feeling better."
Mindfulness,34vuj0,Kleszcz87,1 point,Tue May 5 06:50:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Do you then discourage flow? I'm mostly curious as to the importance of flow in the first place, is it even desirable? Should we instead be searching only for constant awareness? My problem, and this relates to the comment below, is that mindfulness in general seems to require some amount of energy and I'm wondering whether flow should make room for that?"
Mindfulness,34vuj0,Kleszcz87,1 point,Tue May 5 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"Desiring flow or any other internal state would be a sign of control agenda - in essence, ""I want to feel X, not Y"", where Y is an emotion they struggle with. This is in itself a sign of a problem as internal states are not easily planned, there is no ON switch for happy, relaxed, rested and this applies to flow too. My clients have usually done a quite few things in service of that - like drinking too much, binging on food or internet, been avoiding or escaping some difficult situations - everything to control their internal states, usually with a disservice to their important life areas. So mindfulness is a way to embrace the uneasiness and be present when it does happen, so you are in contact with your life and have more choice what to do. If this takes some energy then I ask you what is more important to you - that above or doing only effortless stuff? Maybe this effort is worth something in the long run.   Moreover, science shows that mf engages less brain activity with experienced users, suggesting that later it becomes more of a habit. Still, it is not that important as it's quite abstract and the question about your growth remains the same - are you willing to walk the walk, open up for difficulties, if it's something important for you on the line?"
Mindfulness,34vuj0,jrcarney52,1 point,Tue May 5 19:49:09 2015 UTC,"My attention becomes thin--I leave flow--when I am not deliberately focusing it, and if I have something to worry about, frustratingly, that is where my attention goes--an unfinished project, day-dreaming, acknowledging how bored I am, etc.. I am a teacher and I definitely struggle most when grading papers. I can get through four or five papers, giving twenty minutes of close attention to each paper, but then I feel a palpable exhaustion of attention. It's as if I have used up my attention fuel. I am interested to now how to refuel yourself, to recover from mental exhaustion. A useful strategy will be very useful to get through my stacks of grading. I do lots of sitting meditation, but my experience is that sitting meditation, while it enhances your attention stamina, nevertheless taps your attention for that day. Other than coffee and other stimulants, other than rest, is their a way to vitalize your mind?"
Mindfulness,34tkai,AusterMcEwan,5,Mon May 4 13:16:59 2015 UTC,"Last year for work, I saw a great presentation called Human At Work which encouraged mindfulness in work habits.  If I recall, he had 2 practices which helped with email. First, he does not leave email on. He plans very specific times to 'do email', and quits his mail app at any other time. Second, if he's writing much more than a 1-liner response, he uses another app (I use Byword) to type the message outside the mental context of email, then pastes it into a mail message when he's done.  I don't strictly follow this, but it does help."
Mindfulness,34tkai,ashooner,3,Mon May 4 14:37:02 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it's not always practical, but you could try reading them out loud? And/or you could pause after each sentence you read and look away from the email, and try to truly think about what you just read. Email is a tricky one, but when I want to practice mindful reading I often find these two things help."
Mindfulness,34tkai,ChowMeinBastard,3,Mon May 4 13:54:25 2015 UTC,"Email has been a multifaceted approach for me. On the one hand, mindfulness has helped me notice the pressure I put on myself, what  assumptions I make about others expectations and my unwillingness to let people down even a little, and it has explore different ways of being and build the courage and acceptance to try those different ways of being. However, that's a bit high-level and long term. On a day-to-day basis I try and take a few deep breaths between emails and ""check in"" with myself between emails to (a) try to stay relaxed and (b) to notice when I get drained and take a break for a bit. That way I can tackle as I can, take breaks when I need, and get less overwhelmed. I also notice the urge in me to answer emails right away and then take a few deep breaths and give myself permission to wait a bit before responding, allowing me to prioritize what ACTUALLY needs to be done right now, what can be done later, and what can wait. It tends to work a lot better than just diving right in for me."
Mindfulness,34tkai,wisekernel,2,Tue May 5 03:22:02 2015 UTC,"I found myself using email way more efficient and with more headspace since I started using Mailbox (from Dropbox).

Mindfulness,34tkai,OSC4R_,1 point,Mon May 4 17:08:20 2015 UTC,"I guess there are multiple ways to do this, and no one specific method is the best. Perhaps you could try going through all the emails once and flagging the most important ones that you have to reply and only get to those first; at least after this sifting there would be an impression that the chore of replying emails is now copable. Only when you have time subsequently do you return to reply the less important ones. I hope there are those you would prioritise and not all of them are important and require an immediate response from you though. Breathe and chill (:"

Mindfulness,34kz1w,CryptoGreen,1 point,Sat May 2 16:59:47 2015 UTC,Care to explain?
Mindfulness,34kz1w,CryptoGreen,2,Sat May 2 17:15:35 2015 UTC,"Verse is semi-conscious. You do not need 100% of your attention to recite verses. However, to read a book, you need most of it (usually). The monks are holding one thing in their focus. The focus does not shift or change except in the object of the focus shifting. A verse (or sound) does not move.   Buddha looked at it as a river. The river is constantly ""changing"" and never the same because the water is exchanged for new water. Yet the river remains. You cannot cross the same river twice in terms of the molecules, but you can make the same crossing. Reading a book is more like floating down the river. Reciting a verse or mantra is more like wading in a river.  Does that make more sense?  It is often said that mindfulness is simple, but not easy. I can tell you simply, it's about paying attention to here & now. But if you haven't had the practice of that attention regularly over a long time, the river will take you far downstream."
Mindfulness,34kz1w,notaslavetofashion,1 point,Sun May 3 00:31:13 2015 UTC,"I am confused by your river analogy, but I take it your point is that it is easy to lose awareness of your surroundings if you are engrossed by reading something for the first time.  That's true, but I think you practice reading with awareness of your surroundings, it's similar to any other mindfulness exercise. As you might put it, it's not easy but the concept is simple."

Mindfulness,34kz1w,guitaardvark,1 point,Sat May 2 12:45:26 2015 UTC,"I found that for me audiobooks and talks were far more powerful than reading any of the books. I think that was because I was able to be hearing the information and ideas about mindfulness as I was doing things in my everyday life, so the mindfulness training was linked to my surroundings and my activity in those surroundings.  When i found my way to Tolle's audio books, through Gabor Mate's writing, I was experiencing constant anxiety and endless mental narrative racing. To start to calm my mind I found it useful to listen to A New Earth and The Power of Now audiobooks repeatedly, sometimes several times a day.  Tolle narrates these two audiobooks himself and I found that helped me to connect with what he was saying more easily.  As I began to get a grip on my thoughts and mind I listened less and less often and now, 4 years later, I listen to a broader range of speakers and to the various retreat recordings that I've found as well.  Some other speakers I really enjoy and find helpful to me are Pema Chodron and Adyashanti."

Mindfulness,34crkn,Keaith,3,Thu Apr 30 02:56:18 2015 UTC,"I really think that you're just becoming more aware of it. With me, it wasn't that I was noticing my angry spells more, it was that I started questioning myself as to where those little mental outbursts were coming from, and why they were coming. Tolle has a great line about being able to just smile at your angry moments and laugh at their silliness, and that really can help. But yeah, you're probably just hyper-aware of your moods at the moment."
Mindfulness,34crkn,IvanLyon,3,Thu Apr 30 06:38:32 2015 UTC,"It could be any and all of the above, really. Sometimes it's challenging to make rhyme or reason out of these things.

Mindfulness,34crkn,wisekernel,2,Thu Apr 30 16:59:12 2015 UTC,"It could be any number of things. In general, that anger was probably there but two new things could be happening. First, you could be more aware of it now so you notice it more. Second, when getting into the practice it is common for suppressed feelings to start to arise. So if you've been the type to always play nice, to swallow it if you feel slighted or disrespected and try to just move on, you may have kept pushing the anger down and now it is releasing a bit. In that case, it's about noticing it, recognizing that it's there. Allowing yourself to feel angry when you do, and the less you resist it the more it will just cycle through and leave and get easier again.   It's important to notice, acknowledge and be patient with our feelings - good or bad. But, if you'd like to balance the anger out a bit in practice (again, not stifling it but giving yourself a counter to help feel less subject to it) compassion meditations (like tonglen or ones using metta) are really helpful!"

Try to bring your concentration away from the busyness and on to something else. For example: focus on your breathing. Breathe in for 5 seconds, hold for 5 seconds and exhale for 5 seconds. Listen to yourself breathing. Think about how your lungs/muscles feel as they inflate and deflate etc."
Mindfulness,345o15,eatlivemosh,3,Tue Apr 28 15:09:34 2015 UTC,"Your situation is a great illustration of one of the reasons it's beneficial to practice: most people, to one extent or another, have difficulty being alone with their thoughts, with anxiety, fear, sorrow, and so many other feelings attending to the experience.  When we practice mindfulness, we say,""I am not willing to just avoid this situation--I want to see what is really going on here.""  So we sit and we're mindful, which means bringing a certain courage to the situation so that, when uncomfortable feelings and thoughts arise, we stay with them instead of doing the ""normal"" things, which includes suppressing, ignoring, or distracting ourselves from the discomfort.  With time, it is possible to become more open, unguarded, and friendly towards all that stuff that makes us uncomfortable, and that means that it loses some of its hold on us--there is a feeling of freedom and ease about it that comes from practicing.    A word of caution: for some people, due to prominent emotional issues, life circumstances, etc., it  may not be a good idea to explore these areas until other things are addressed, especially if one is alone, without a teacher or at least a group of like-minded people who can provide guidance and support.  For example, some people may have a tendency to hyperventilate, especially when learning to practice (I was one of them!), and it is helpful to have some source of knowledge or advice about what to do if that happens...  On a practical level, when you are, for example, being mindful of breathing, and anxiety appears, shift to noticing how it feels in the body (e.g. the rumble in the belly, the quickening of the breath, the tension in the shoulders), how the sensations which are called ""anxiety"" shift and waver over time, and how/if it changes things when you approach them with opennesss and willingness for them to be there, just as they are.

I saw a holistic doctor, (combining mindfulness) who worked out the problems that was reinforcing that anxiety, it took a while to adjust to the change, but placing my self in the present moment and reminding myself to stay confident really helped.

Mindfulness,345d3c,wisekernel,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:11:44 2015 UTC,"Wow, SUCH a great articulation of a very common human occurrence. Now, that's not to say you didn't actually perceive things more vividly than many others. Some people have more vigilant limbic systems which can make them more attentive to stimuli, for example. Others are hyper-attentive due to the actual attention-control centres of the brain. BUT, the thing you seemed to have noticed - and is very mindful in and of itself - is that being this aware isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it is what a lot of people who practice mindfulness strive for. Mindfulness could certainly help you re-train your attention and help you feel more alert, there is a lot of research showing the attention-benefits of mindfulness so with practice I would be very confident that you would re-gain that.  But, in addition, mindfulness can help you feel more at peace with yourself and your differences. It can help develop SO much self-love that you will also be less likely to want to be ""normal"" or change yourself, so it will help you maintain yourself that way too. PLUS, mindfulness can help you regulate how you feel about all that stimulus too - so it doesn't feel overwhelming but feels really positive and visceral for you again. So, yes, I do think you're in the right place :)  Now the question from me is whether you feel like you know how to start the practice and feel like you have the tools to get that all back? If not, happy to help point you to some beginner resources. There is LOTS out there, from books to itunes CDs, to free tips on YouTube. Tons :)  Let me know if you need that help to get started!

Mindfulness,342ie1,0dysseuz,3,Mon Apr 27 20:11:03 2015 UTC,"Hi,  It is about being gentle with yourself. Not laid back per se but accepting that now is all you have. I practice mindfulness, and not to put a dampener on things. Today, I had a reminder of how much being 'gentle' with yourself and your goal can both ground you and also help you to see the future in more of an optimistic light. Today I stepped out of the bank after depositing money. I was by police, ambulance and spectators. I looked across at where the commotion came from, only to see a brown jacket on the floor with a white shirt next to it. It was all covered in blood, it was obvious to me what had happened. Apparently, someone jumped 50 feet to their end. That information provoked a profound sadness in me. I asked my self so many questions. I wanted and still want to know why that individual committed that act. It reminded me of having now.   Planning is good, if it causes you stress then it becomes something bad for your health. Cortisol shoots up, and all those negativities come flooding in.   So, being 'easy' with yourself is a form of accepting the 'now'. One of the art of mindfulness is being akin to a scientist conducting and experiment and recording it. YOU become that scientist to yourself. simply being there with yourself. OBSERVING YOURSELF. Doing all this without judgement. I am sure you know all this. But, repetition is one way we learn. Don't overthink the time you spend with yourself. Just be 'easy'.  I hope you find this useful."

Mindfulness,33nhes,Mithra9009,2,Thu Apr 23 23:24:15 2015 UTC,"The idea is that one should not be thinking or visualizing about the breath, but one should actually be feeling the breath.    There is no single best point to feel/become aware of the breath. These are the common areas where one can feel the breath. Yours could be something else.     1) You can feel the rise and fall of the belly. This works well, if you are used to diaphragmatic breathing. Not all of us do this belly breathing. We usually do shallow breathing, which only goes up to the chest.      The crucial point here is that, you are not being asked to do the diaphragmatic or belly breathing. Your breath should be the normal one. But this is one possibility.     2) Feeling the rise and fall of the chest as you breathe. As I said, we are more likely to breath shallow, which can be felt in the chest. This is one more possibility for 'feeling' the breath.    3) Feeling the breath at the tip of the nostril. This is very subtle. You may need a little practice to feel these sensations. The cool air passing right below the nostril as you inhale and warm air passing right there, as you exhale.     4) Feeling the breath at the back of your throat. As you breath, air brushes against the back of the throat or the nasal passage. You can either feel the brushing of the air, or you can feel the sound of the air, as it brushes there. Either way you are still feeling the air.     These are not the only possibilities. You may feel it somewhere else, or you may feel the whole breath, moving from the nostril, to the back of the throat, through the chest to the belly with each inhalation and backwoards with each exhalation."

Mindfulness,33nhes,BrStFr,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:53:14 2015 UTC,"When focusing on my breath I find it best to focus on the contact point between my nostrils and the air (where it feels cool when I breath in). OR sometimes the rise and fall of my belly.  BUT, I often only use breathing as an anchor and actually explore other things in meditation too (i.e. sound, feel, touch, etc.). Just a thought though :)"
Mindfulness,33nhes,wisekernel,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:08:49 2015 UTC,"I thought I should elaborate on the point about how you can also direct your awareness to places that aren't your breath too. So, for example, in a body scan you direct attention to different parts of your body very intentionally. Or doing external awareness you focus on stimuli in the external environment. With internal awareness you direct attention stimuli to the internal environment.   I can send some guided versions of these if you're interested in trying them too, just direct message me :) OR you can google them or check YouTube and see if you find any you like :)"
Mindfulness,33k3ls,omtastic,5,Thu Apr 23 03:55:49 2015 UTC,I've done an 11-day vipassana and Honestly it's hell. When you are done though you will be so in tune with yourself. Be prepared to discover dissatisfaction with things in your life and make changes to make your life better.   The most important thing is to go and stick to the program for the entire duration no matter how difficult or painful.   The war you win over yourself is a victory no one can ever deny you from.
Mindfulness,33k3ls,kat_ams,3,Thu Apr 23 09:54:51 2015 UTC,Really interesting perspective. Thanks for your response.
Mindfulness,33k3ls,EmilyHT,4,Thu Apr 23 11:04:59 2015 UTC,"I would caution against forcing anything and the use of war as a metaphor.  Be kind to yourself, even while at a retreat.  At my first retreat, someone asked a teacher whether to force himself to be present with difficult emotions.  The answer was that skillful practice permits a person to know when a task is too much and when to back off.  That teacher had left his first retreat days early because it was too much for him.  Obviously he had gone back to it, more gingerly, and eventually became ordained."
Mindfulness,33k3ls,waters-tester,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:52:10 2015 UTC,"A great reminder, thank you.

Mindfulness,33k3ls,cheeni,3,Thu Apr 23 15:25:31 2015 UTC,"A lot depends on the kind of retreat, and the emotional baggage you carry into the retreat. If you have a lot of things in your head that you would hate to be reminded of, trust me, they will come out to demand attention. Some centers are better equipped to handle this than others. At a large monastery where there are hundreds of monks, it may be quite easy to find help in an emergency. At a lay meditation center like the Goenka Dhamma centers, it is much harder to get knowledgeable help. Besides, the rules of the center may enforce silence or other rules, making it harder.  The one strategy that always works for me is to continue meditating and follow the instructions no matter how hard it gets. A lot of people who have a tough time do so when they start listening to their inner demons and abandon serious meditation. The inner demons can take many forms, including laziness, backache, headache, drowsiness, sexual desires, terror filled dreams and even an irrepressible mirth that once made me want to laugh aloud and break the silence.  http://www.dharmaoverground.org/web/guest/dharma-wiki/-/wiki/Main/MCTB+Daily+Life+and+Retreats"

Mindfulness,33gwgf,Lightfiend,5,Wed Apr 22 12:53:16 2015 UTC,"After reading this, I ordered a book and CD from Amazon called Mindfulness and Depression (4.5 stars).  My son struggles with depression and is on state sponsored medical aid - thus just pills and no therapy.  He has a terrible time with the meds they give him - all kinds of side effects.  If any of you have any experience with this treatment, please let me know how it worked for you."
Mindfulness,33gwgf,nobutterinhell,3,Wed Apr 22 14:43:49 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - Yes, I think mindfulness in general is helping me (rather than specific MBCT).  I can only write in terribly written essays, so I hope this isn't unreadable.  I have been on medication for around 8 years (6 different types), have suffered from anxiety and recurrent depressive episodes for over 10 years.  I started doing regular mindfulness based meditation around 3 months ago, in theory I do a specific session a day although in reality it's more like 4-5 times per week and try to apply the principles as often as I remember, or any time when I've got a few minutes where I don't have to concentrate on anything I try and do a mini meditation.  It's too early to say if it's really helped (I feel I need to try something for 2 years before I would be confident that it'd actually made a difference, rather than a perceived effect being down to the natural variation in my depression) but I really feel like so far it has.  I am starting to notice the effects, and the more I practice the more I notice that I am reacting to things differently - best way I can think to describe it is that I'm more able to almost take a step back and remain slightly separated from the situation rather than getting immediately emotionally overwhelmed, I have the space to better evaluate the situation instead of immediately going into a downward spiral.  'Situation' in this context does not just mean things that are external, but is starting to mean that I'm doing a better job of evaluating my own thoughts instead of letting them destroy me.  It's not perfect and not always effective for me, but it seems to be improving things.  I haven't stopped or reduced medication.  I should note that I have been toying with it for years, tried odd sessions here and there and found it helpful but then didn't try again for months.  It seems to have taken years for me to actually get the motivation to stick to it or find the way that worked for me, in that time I've tried several different recordings, did a short course with a therapist who did MBCT (but I was just too anxious in the sessions to do it and generally unreceptive), been to a couple of different buddist centres (where it was good, I liked the sessions but they were a bit too religion focused and anxiety with the group before and after the meditation was an issue - however I'd still recommend trying it, especially if struggling to work out how to meditate), tried reading a couple of books but despite the fact that I read loads found I couldn't read them (just could never concentrate on them), and read a lot of articles.  I am now doing headspace, I know it's not ideal for various reasons and it's not aimed at depression but for me it works, I like the app and seem to prefer an app-based-approach (convenience I guess), I like his voice, I like that it's different every time (although I often repeat sessions), and finally I'm managing to stick with it and it is making a difference, I think the more depression focused things that I've learnt along the way help.  I think the point of this last paragraph was that if he doesn't get on with the book then it doesn't mean the idea is hopeless, if he has any interest then there are different things that he can try, if he's unreceptive you still might lay some foundations that he can build on in the future if he becomes more open to the idea.  I would also say it'd be great if you also read the book and knew what it was about, I feel like it'd be really helpful if my partner would and be able to better understand and then actually help me apply it when I'm not doing so well, but I think he thinks it's all a bit airy-fairy."
Mindfulness,33gwgf,Lpngpl,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:12:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much.  I am particularly worried about him right now as he is showing so much anger at everything.  When I do get him to separate from the situation, he can be calmed down.  I wonder if that is an early effect of Mindfulness - all the anger surfacing.  As for the book I ordered, I will read it first and go through the CD's so I can be more supportive.  I like the idea of the Buddhist center and I'll see if I can find one."
Mindfulness,33gwgf,nobutterinhell,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:34:21 2015 UTC,"Anger can just be part of depression, although I've noticed more anger lately (but it's started decreasing) and it may be related to the mindfulness.  In my case it's more like my descent into madness (/being a crying, useless heap who wants to die) is being broken into stages.  What used to be a flash reaction (small, meaningless event -> uncontrollable crying completely out of proportion) has changed - in trying to be more aware of that flash reaction and seeing what actually happens I noticed extra steps, now the reaction is drawn out and it's not a flash reaction but distinct steps (eg, event -> anger or frustration (usually at myself, sometimes at the cause of the event) -> crying) Now I'm starting to be able to step in at some point and stop the process and get myself to calm down before it gets out of hand.  I'm still over reacting to a lot of things but it's not as bad, and it's less visible - other people don't see that someone making some small error that I have to fix makes me want to stab them in the face for a brief moment before I get a hold of myself, they see that someone making a some small error that I have to fix is no longer making me inexplicably burst into tears for no apparent reason.  I've no idea what the point of this post was but it was quite therapeutic to write."

Mindfulness,33gwgf,joshp23,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:59:47 2015 UTC,Thank you. I'll look into this approach.
Mindfulness,33gwgf,nobutterinhell,9,Thu Apr 23 13:28:03 2015 UTC,"Also, exercise is equally/more effective.  EDIT:  Well, since this is being received so nicely, here's more (than you probably wanted)!  The threshold for exercise as treatment for depression is 10-29 min/d.  At this threshold, there is an ""18%"" decrease in depression.  This continues to decrease to 90+ min/d, at which depression is decreased an astounding ""55%""  There are two theories supporting the exercise effects on depression.  The first is that acidosis causes an endorphin release.  The second is that increased circulation results in increased endorphins.  An increase in the number of large blood vessels in cerebral region of the brain and increase in blood flow in the three major cerebral arteries may play a role.  Exercise is as good as Zoloft in the treatment of depression.  In a meta-analysis of 14 studies, all but 2 showed an independent statistically- and clinically-significant improvement in depressive symptoms with an effect size of -1.1 (95%CI -1.5 to -0.7).  In a comparison between Zoloft, ExRx (exercise prescription), and combined, at 10mo 38% of Zoloft had recurrence, 31% of combined had recurrence, and an amazing 8% of exercise-alone had recurrence.  Every 50 min of exercise per week is correlated with a 50% drop in depression levels.  Two studies reported that moderate intensity aerobics 3-5 d/wk experienced a decline in depressive symptoms by 47% after 12 weeks.  Low-intensity exercise groups showed a 30% reduction in symptoms.  In a Purdue University study, middle-aged runner who had been running 3-5 d/wk for 3-10 yr were markedly less depressed than a matched comparison group.  In a random controlled trial comparing high- vs low-intensity progressive resistance training vs general practitioner care there was a >50% reduction in the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression score in 61% of those in the high-intensity group, 29% of those in the low-intensity group, and only 21% of those in the GP care group.  Unsupervised weight lifting exercise maintains its antidepressant effectiveness at 20 weeks.  Long-term changes in exercise behaviour are possible in some patients even without supervision.  A systematic review showed that there is no association between type of exercise and variation in results between studies.  This indicates that aerobic and progressive resistance training have a similar effect.  Exercise Prescription for Depression and Anxiety  Mode: walk, jog, bike, swim  Frequency: 3-5 d/wk  Intensity: 60-75% HRR  Duration: 40-60 min  Calculating intensity: (1) x = 220 - age - resting heart rate, (2) y = x * (# between 0.6 and 0.75), (3) z = y + resting heart rate, (4) ""z"" is your target heart rate  Here are some studies supporting what I've said:  Lawlor, 2001  Blumenthal, 2007   Dunn, 2005   Lobstein, 1983   Singh, 2005  Singh, 2001  Mura, 2013   Remember, exercise can be a modality for mindfulness meditation, so there's no reason you can't do them at the same time and benefit from both"

They'll be able to refer you to a psychiatrist or another therapist who can lead you through CBT.   Literally though, mindfulness is one of the first things that is taught in CBT. Being able to recognize and identify what you're feeling, and then the therapy delves deeper into challenging your beliefs, etc etc"
Mindfulness,33gwgf,mcflyjr,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:33:26 2015 UTC,"CBT is a far cry from mindfulness as many of is think of it.  It is true that recognizing a thought as the first step is in the right ballpark, but then CBT asks you to think of an alternative, more palatable explanation.  CBT also labels 'bad' thoughts as delusions.    Mindfulness that many of us think about is about being aware of, and then compassionately accepting, whatever arises.   Psychiatrists are trained in identifying problems and  trying to get rid of them.  A very different mindset."
Mindfulness,33gwgf,waters-tester,2,Thu Apr 23 12:58:25 2015 UTC,"You can do a search in your area (on google) for therapists (psychologist or social worker)) that are trained in any of the following: MBCT (Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy) which is what was focused on in this article, ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) or MBSR (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction).

Mindfulness,338epa,reigorius,9,Mon Apr 20 13:53:42 2015 UTC,"Good article. It's strikes me as sort of a disintroduction from mindfulness. It's a high-level critique of the modern western interpretation of something very old and very alien (to the western consciousness), not of the concept itself.  In the West, and in America in particular, the trend is to find successful ideas, dismantle them, and then reassemble them in the most efficient and mass-reproducible way possible. We use it to great effect in our medicine (taking an aspirin for a headache is better than chewing on willow bark all afternoon), but not so effectively in other things--fast food, popular music, and the self-help phenomenon.  The danger with mindfulness is that it seems to be becoming its own entity, completely separate from its original context. Some would say that's a good thing, but it's important to remember that mindfulness (sati) was described for a purpose. It was a practice designed to embrace specific values and to achieve a specific outcome. And without those, mindfulness just becomes a catchphrase for a society that continues to press-on in the same general direction. As a result, I think it's painfully obvious that much of the rhetoric around mindfulness is deeply rooted in the same old Calvinist puritan values of the ""hard worker"" that have been heartlessly exploited by greedy employers for the past three centuries. It's just a rebranding, like when disgraced behemoth ING Financial changed its name to the harmless-sounding Voya Financial. It's core values, presumably, remain identical."
Mindfulness,338epa,10tothe24th,2,Mon Apr 20 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"This is a very important discussion.  Jon Kabat-Zinn, one of the ""pioneers"" of mindfulness in Western science, said he used the word mindfulness as synonymous with the Dharma.   Even the interpretation of Samma Sati among the various sects of Buddhism itself differs, or is unclear.  I think the contemporary mindfulness teaching, at least as taught by Jon Kabat-Zinn and the Center for Mindfulness, encompasses much more of the 8-fold path than simply sati alone."

Mindfulness,32r4r2,Antique_Acid_666,4,Thu Apr 16 01:17:04 2015 UTC,Can someone enjoy the sense of ownership in the same way as the smell of flowers?  Is the search for individual happiness one of ownership? Be it material or conceptual.  What makes us see one way or the other?
Mindfulness,32r4r2,bonamens,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:06:17 2015 UTC,"Our animal instincts tell us to own, to accumulate, to control, to gain superiority over others. This is to increase our chances for survival. As a reward for performing these actions, our instincts give us pleasure. We enjoy that sensation, so we continue these actions to try to get more pleasure. This is about survival.  The problem is that these instincts effectively tell us, ""you need more to be happy."" But, there is no end to ""more,"" so it is a hopeless cause. It turns out the opposite is true. You need less to be happy.  I don't know if that answers your question..."
Mindfulness,32r4r2,superheavydeathmetal,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:06:05 2015 UTC,"The purpose of my questions is to hopefully expose the perceived problem as a non-problem. What happens if we apply a mindful view?  If we look at this present moment and find that it is not perfect, what are we trying to attain? Also, when?  Everything material, the will to power and the whole game of survival happens inside this moment. Could there be another way for this moment to exist?  Perhaps there is suffering in the world because of what you and OP describe. We can suffer such doubt in addition, but it seems unessecary.  I don't disagree with the main point of view, I'm just trying approach it mindfully."
Mindfulness,32r4r2,bonamens,2,Fri Apr 17 17:47:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's important what you're saying here. I too don't disagree with the point of view but wonder what the real problem is. Possessing/having things, material things, os a necessity in many ways - but what often goes on is part of a distortion that happens far more often. The challenge, to me, is one of attachment. We can possess/have/utilize things knowing they aren't really ""ours"", that we just have the privilege of their experience and one day those things will decay, die, rot, go to another person, or any of these things and reminds us we don't really ""own"" (control) anything. Acquiring objects of need in itself isn't faulty, but the relationship to them that may be. When we become attached to our objects, feel like we have a right to them or like we can control them, that is a challenging relationship and one that society has become so attached to that many people have trouble even understanding it any other way and that becomes problematic. People have also developed a second error in thinking - that if ""having"" a few basic things (just enough food, water, shelter, comfort) can make us pretty happy (compared to not having those needs met) then having A LOT of things should make us REALLY happy. Though it doesn't work that way does it. But people become attached to that myth as well and can't always see that it's the source of their thinking when they are so distracted from the truth a lot of the time!   In any case, I agree with you. There is no innate ""bad-ness"" in anything, not even ownership. But how we develop attachments to things, like a state of ownership, can cause more suffering and not serve us."

Mindfulness,31vd26,uzazex,2,Wed Apr 8 22:08:54 2015 UTC,"Great video /u/GofireGolight . I have one question regarding the idea of bringing awareness to intention. As I started to practice this technique,  for the first day I noticed a lot in each action I undertook. But this attention started fading and the auto pilot mode started to show up again in every task. My question is how do you constantly pay attention to something routine or mundane?   Moreover, there comes a point when there is nothing new in anything I and it is all mechanical except the thoughts which depend on the mood and are random."
Mindfulness,31vd26,pvvikas,2,Mon Apr 13 23:33:31 2015 UTC,"To answer your question you are not consrantly holding your attention to the routine. You are noticing how you feel mundane about it, you are aware of how it takes you out of the flow. THAT is mindfulness. You are right on track. The trick then begins, at least as i began to see it, that nothing was mundane anymore. Everything was something incredible to be experiuenced and noticed and for lack of a better word, ""loved"" because it exists. I hope that did come off like a hippy, it happens sometimes.  But the point is when you notice your attention slipping, dont admonish yourself for it, just let it pass and return your attention to what you are doing. It sounds like you are right where you are supposed to be."

Mindfulness,31bytu,danishpete,28,Fri Apr 3 17:43:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I actually just had a great session at my local meditation center where we talked about precisely this. Our teacher talked about how our thoughts are like trains that move on down the tracks. We are powerless to stop the trains. We suffer when we try to jump in front of the train and stop it. It'll only push us further, while also knocking us down. In the same way, it's silly to chase after trains that are fleeting.   The act of applying mindfulness to thoughts is by sitting on the side of the tracks and watching them go by. You are going to have depressing, self-critical, and even sometimes outright crazy thoughts. But you don't need to run into the tracks. You can just let them be. In the same way you can't control when a dog barks while you are trying to have a quiet place, you can't control having a negative thought when you are trying to enjoy something. It just happens. There's no point in getting angry at the dog (or the thought), you just need to let it be and accept reality as it rather than trying to shape it into something you want it to be.  The good news is, that neurologically, you can train your brain to think positive things more often. But this has nothing to do with trying to stop negative thoughts or trying to chase positive thoughts. My teacher taught this as cultivation. Yet again, your thoughts are out of your control; they merely happen to you. But what you can do is be more aware of them. When a negative thought comes up, you can recognize it and know that it leads to bad feelings and choose not to act it. But when a positive thought comes up (such as wishing to help someone), you can act on that thought and allow it to grow. When you act on the positive thoughts and choose not to act on the negative ones, you will, very naturally, have more positive thoughts.  This isn't to say that your negative thoughts will disappear entirely. I, at least personally, believe that will never happen, no matter how much you cultivate your mind. But what you're doing is taking the power out of those negative thoughts and bringing the power to the positive thoughts. You will continue to have thoughts such as ""give up, you are not good enough, etc."", but you can choose not to act on them and give them power by trying to remove them. You will also continue to have positive thoughts, which you can act on and give power to bring you happiness, compassion, and generosity. But no matter what, your thoughts are out of your control. You will never be able to control what you think, stop negative thoughts, or create positive thoughts. But, you do have the power to use mindfulness to choose which to act on and which to simply let be."

Mindfulness,31bytu,sayleanenlarge,4,Sun Apr 5 09:31:26 2015 UTC,"Look up ""catastrophizing"" and see how that fits with your experiences. In some ways, you've practiced for a long time to find the worst outcomes of any situation, and like most people who practice something, you're good at it!  In the short term, mindfulness practice can just temporarily take you away from the emotional responses to your imagined catastrophes. With practice, it can help you accept those emotional reaction to situations that aren't real, and relieve yourself of the anxiety of worrying about your emotions. With continued diligence, it can help you recognize that unreal thoughts don't need to elicit any kind of emotional response at all, which ultimately leaves you in a state where your response to most situations is to accept and appreciate them. It can be very liberating and rewarding.  And like most things worth having, it takes work. You got good at anxiety by practicing it over years and years. Developing ""the beginner's mind"" will take a lot of time, too. But even in the short term, good, regular mindfulness practice can offer you some respite.   Best of luck! I wish you fleeting moments of peace, strung together to form a lifetime."
Mindfulness,31bytu,throwaway,3,Sat Apr 4 03:07:20 2015 UTC,"Sounds a bit like GAD. It's very common, about 1in10.

It tends to centre on a number of particular topics, which vary from person to person (mine are inadequacy, health, work, and thinking no one likes me).

I've been doing that on a regular basis for like 10 years but the bad thoughts still keep coming.. Am I doing something wrong or will it never stop ?   Yes, the standard understanding of mindfulness as simply observing is gravely mistaken.  I'm like you, I stuck with it for about 10 years, then I found this guy:  The Agendas of Mindfulness.  The good news is that the work you've done developing the capacity to simply observe will come in handy is pretty useful, just not a complete path in itself."
Mindfulness,31bytu,420iszero,2,Sat Apr 4 03:15:17 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm a little late to the party, but here is my two cents:  Have you ever seen ""A Beautiful Mind""? What you are describing is just like the figments of the main character's imagination. They have power because he thinks they are real. Once he realizes they are not real, they cease to have power. They never went away, but it didn't matter, because they lost their power. This is how mindfulness will help. And yes, everyone is like this.  You said, ""relieve me from this dark and powerful entity.""  If the entity has any power, it's the power that you give it. Mindfulness will help you acknowledge the thought, accept that it is only a thought and not truth. Then, the dark entity will have no power. And while it may never go away, it doesn't matter because it doesn't make you feel bad. It will no longer be dark. It will just be an entity."

Mindfulness,31997a,5FiggaNigga,10,Fri Apr 3 00:36:47 2015 UTC,"You won't be able to stop judging your thoughts, especially at the beginning of your practice. The key is to realize and be mindful that you are judging your thoughts. And then try not to judge the judging. When it happens, note the thought, judge it, accept it, and then return to your breathing. Eventually this will become easier. The key is to stick with it."
Mindfulness,31997a,Kglee54,3,Fri Apr 3 00:47:24 2015 UTC,"The mind will produce judgments (that's one of the things it just does).  Notice those judgments as you would anything else that is not the object of your mindfulness (e.g. your breath), and return to the object.  Judgments become problematic when they are believed, given particular weight, or used as the basis for telling yet another story about the world.   Mindfulness does not involve clinging or rejecting, and that applies just as well to judgments (also noticing how readily, reflexively, and often pointlessly the mind generates them is, in itself a useful feature of mindfulness practice)."
Mindfulness,31997a,BrStFr,2,Fri Apr 3 16:10:12 2015 UTC,"On this I would say: don't try to not judge. It's only natural to do so.   Try also to think of your thoughts as transient objects in the mind to be considered. Many thoughts come with added baggage in the form of stories we tell ourselves or emotional narratives based on past trauma or experiences, etc. Try to avoid getting hooked by thoughts. You may find your thoughts less like things to be judged and more like fascinating objects in the mind.   You might also try to label thoughts as either 'clear', 'subtle', or 'none'. This is technically judging, but I find it helps to let thoughts pass (accepting them, good or bad) and to return to a constant (like breath).   Good luck."

Mindfulness,310vru,FrustratedSeeker,7,Wed Apr 1 05:53:38 2015 UTC,"How about just watching your frustration without acting on it? How does it feel? Is it purely emotional or is it a bit physical , too? Where in your body are you tense? What kind of thoughts arise? How are you feeling about those thoughts? What about your breath, does it change in frustration? Does the tension change with your breath? The urge to throw something might be pretty intense, but how does it feel if you just don't act on it? And how does it feel the next moment, and the next, and the next.   You may judge, we all judge sometimes, especially  intense sensations. Just watch yourself how judging makes you feel. Maybe try not judging and how that feels.   In short: don't act just watch. Relaxation is not the goal, if it feels like shit, feel the shit."
Mindfulness,310vru,ColorDeprived,2,Wed Apr 1 09:35:01 2015 UTC,"The urge to throw something might be pretty intense, but how does it feel if you just don't act on it? And how does it feel the next moment, and the next, and the next.   If the urge is incredibly powerful, so much that I'm afraid I might actually throw the shoe, should I fight the urge assuming it's in an inappropriate place to throw the shoe (i.e most places lol)? If I do repress or fight the urge, should I just watch that as well?"
Mindfulness,310vru,frostwarrior,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:25:04 2015 UTC,"You're not repressing the urge. You're fighting it.  The first part of mindfulness is physicall stillness. In order to watch your sensations you need to take from them the ""power"" to make you spring out from your seat to fulfill it.  That's why watching the breath is useful. It trains you to ""leave apart"" the urge and, bit by bit, split the sensation from the urge that follows it.  Then, when you're still able of not-getting-up, you need to turn into ""passive"" or ""signal receptor"" mode. That is, watch your sensations in a varying degree of openess. Some practices tell you to only watch the sensations of an object of focus (like the breath). Some others tell you to watch every sensation that appears in your ""cognitive world"".  You'll cognitively change negative behaviours by getting good at choosing to be passive at some specific stimulus and fighting your mental and behavioural habits."
Mindfulness,310vru,KernelofWisdom,6,Fri Apr 3 03:57:03 2015 UTC,"Hi there,  Great questions!!  Sounds like you have the ""attention"" part pretty down which is great! That is often half the battle for a lot of people and something to be very grateful for indeed.  To help with your questions: 1) No, mindfulness doesn't always have to be JUST observing, but it is certainly a big part of it. While some meditations get you into the ""habit"" of observing, others work toward getting you to ""observe"" more and more of what you never realized was there.  So, for some that may be the breath, but it can also be sounds and sights you tend to not immerse yourself in. It can be feelings in your body. Or, it can be feelings in your body, and images or memories that come up around them, helping you notice a relationship/pattern that you tend to follow AND THEN help you consider new ways to think abut that pattern, or new ways to be.  Otherwise, there are also compassion-building practices, presence visualizations, or positive outcome visualizations. Perhaps try playing with various guided meditations to help explore new methods?  If you like, I have a free guided meditations playlist on my channel here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbVOUcy7J6Eqfp9kgR8ak7XIvtfKz9Qo, but there are LOTS on YouTube for different purposes. So perhaps set your intention first, and search for guided meditations for that (i.e. ""guided meditations for stress"" or ""guided meditations for more self-love"", etc.).  2) One of the tricky things for people when meditating is to stop being goal oriented (non-striving). We live in very goal-oriented societies so we don't often just let things be without trying to change them. It's funny because there are fears that can instantly come up in that too. If you're not goal oriented, how do you get that promotion? Or motivate yourself to try different meditations? Or even notice any changes from the meditations that come up if you're not trying to make changes happen? Well the answer lies in the difference between a goal and an intention. A goal is something that is often tied up with more attachment, we really, really want to get there and we keep our eye on the prize and do a lot of striving to get there (non-striving is the ""value"" from mindfulness tied to a non-goal-oriented approach). An intention is acknowledging a desire within ourselves, but with less attachment to actually achieving it - there is more ""hope"" that achievement - so instead of striving, we set the intention and aim ourselves toward it and start moving in that direction and see what happens, rather than trying to ""make sure"" it happens. It is a slight difference, but a big one when you get used to it.  I mention it because it's important not to see ""non-judgement"" as a goal. It is an intention. We ""hope"" we might be less judgemental, but realistically it is a lifelong practice. So we might never achieve it, but we keep walking toward it with hope. So, yes, if you notice yourself getting judgemental with yourself or frustrated with the meditation, you do just notice it, label it, and then see what's next and hope that it happens less and less.  The change comes in that, the more you notice and acknowledge that judgement, the more you become aware how often you do it, and then you set the opposite intention and move toward that. SO, instead of praising yourself or getting frustrated, you just try to keep noticing how it's going.  Essentially, we aim to not resist something we don't want, but to cultivate more of what we do.  Hope that helps!  Joelle"
Mindfulness,310vru,jbristow,1 point,Wed Apr 1 14:33:54 2015 UTC,"Or, it can be feelings in your body, and images or memories that come up around them, helping you notice a relationship/pattern that you tend to follow AND THEN help you consider new ways to think abut that pattern, or new ways to be.   Thank you for taking the time to write out your reply. I truly appreciate it. So let's say I notice a stream of thoughts or reactions in myself that are clearly ""negative."" e.g overly negative self-talk. If I notice this loop going on inside myself, I know myself well enough to know that at some point I will judge it and want to change it. This sounds like something I should be doing but it also sounds like it has an undercurrent of judgment.   I am getting the feeling that judgment that resulting in a desire to change, is inevitable. Consequently, I should just be open to whatever is going on inside myself and let the entire stream (negativity--judgment--correction) float by. Is this a correct way of thinking?  I say this primarily because a lot of my frustration comes from feedback loops of judging the fact that I'm judging and judging the fact that I'm judging the fact that I'm judging."
Mindfulness,310vru,KernelofWisdom,3,Wed Apr 1 17:21:22 2015 UTC,"Notice the negative self-talk.  Acknowledge that it is negative self-talk, and let it go.  Notice the judging.  Acknowledge the judging, and let it go.  Notice the ""should"" stories.  Acknowledge that they're just stories and let them go.    Thoughts happen, show yourself some compassion."
Mindfulness,310vru,instantderp,2,Wed Apr 1 20:25:23 2015 UTC,"Aha, it is easy to get caught up in that circle! But, it doesn't have to be. Basically, there is a difference between description and discernment and judgement (which involves a pull from attractions or aversions, it is more attached to desire). So when you notice something ""negative"" it is ok to notice and describe it as a ""negative"" thought, the judgement comes in as ""I don't want to feel like that, I hate that I always go there, I need to fix that about myself, there you go judging again, etc.""    Now, it doesn't always need to be like that but the good news is NOTICING yourself judging is the first step. The next step IS accepting that you feel that way, that you DO have those negative thoughts or feelings. That isn't always easy but if you can just get familiar with the feeling. A negative thought will be tied to an emotion (and often a negative one as well, hurt, jealousy, envy, longing, etc.) so if you can get familiar with the emotion at the root, that is a great step. But the key is not to try and get to it to change it, but to better UNDERSTAND your thoughts and emotions - to be WITH them.  From there, you may even want to even repeat to yourself ""if you feel that way, I will sit with you in that. It's ok, know I am here with you. I am here to be present with you, not to judge you, just to allow you to be how you are and feel how you feel while I am here for you."" and allow them to just be. That may even ease up some of the negativity.   The third step is trying to learn from what those feelings are trying to show you. Ask the emotion (which will manifest as a place in your body) to ""tell"" you what hurts it, what it wants you to know. Then, ask it to tell you something different about the problem you have never thought of before, to tell you what's REALLY bothering it. The trick here is just to trust whatever comes up, your body and emotions will give you what you need if you trust it and are patient with it.   From there, you will be familiar with the root and how you feel and usually that comes with some acceptance and healing. So, instead of trying to change or get rid of the thought or feeling, you learn to go further into it and heal it. It is no longer an act of resistance as it is an act of letting go.  I hope that helps.

Watch what makes you surface these emotions, like the frustration that is enough for you to throw your shoe across the room. What triggers it? What makes you give this trigger so much energy that it takes over your conciousness?  And be patient.

Mindfulness,30to77,komputersaysno,9,Fri Jul 10 09:31:27 2015 UTC,"OK you have to disentangle some ideas before going further. Sam Harris never said that ""the world and your thoughts don't appear in you head"". Of course all of your experience arises in your brain. What he's trying to tell you is that the sense of ""self"" you have is an illusion.  Your eyes capture an image of the world outside and transmit this information to the brain as electric signal through nerves. The brain interprets these signals as an image. Your thoughts appear in your brain through the activity of neurons and the brain interprets this activity as thoughts. The whole thing is a process controlled by the brain, happening continuously and giving rise to the impression that there is something that is you, or ""self"", that is receiving all this information. But the fact is that there is no such thing as self, besides that impression.  The reason why you feel like your ""self"" is in your brain is because the brain is conveniently located near where your main sensors (eyes, ears) are. Had the brain be in your stomach, you'd still feel that your ""self"" is somewhere between your eyes and ears because your image of the world is taken from the eyes' location and your soundscape is taken from the ears' location. So much for the idea that your brain contains a ""self""."

Metaphoric use in ancient texts, for example, suggests that for ancient Greeks the self was located in the belly. For various peoples at various times, the self appeared to be located variously in the belly, the heart, the head, etc.  Putting the self in the head might well be a social convention rather than a natural occurrence based on brain location. In some body scans meditations the awareness is placed in various parts of the body and it sometimes feels like that's where you are at the moment... Fun!

If you can do that, hearing the breath becomes a whole lot obvious and hearing the sound of the breath is in fact feeling the breath.   I recommend four different areas to explore for feeling the breath. (In case you are open to more than just the nose breathing)  1) If you are the kind who breathes through belly, you can feel the belly rising upon inhalation and falling upon exhalation.   2) If you are used to breathing at chest (relatively shallow breath), you can feel the chest rising upon inhalation and falling upon exhalation. Most of us tend to breath at chest.   3) As you breath you may be able to feel the air brushing the back of the throat or the nasal passage. You may be able to either feel the brush of the air, or the sound that air makes as it brushes...  4) Tip of the nostrils, like what you are trying to do. This is the most subtle form, so many people have trouble feeling it.   You can also feel the complete breath as it moves through the nostrils, back of the throat, chest and the belly.   You can experiment with different areas and see which one is most prominent and distinct for you..."

Remember with each day..  IMPENDING DEATH: Think about the imminence of death. Nothing really matters. Time is the most precious commodity. Focus on the most important things.  PERSPECTIVE: Think about how lucky you are to be in this instance of the universe, to be at this socioeconomic level, to exist in this moment.  PRESENCE: Remember that there is only now. Be aware of it, be present, enjoy the experience - even if it is difficult. Feel emotional pain - don't resist. Separate analytic thought as a project and think of it at a predetermined time. Recognize that you have the power to decide not to feel an emotion. Fear is an illusion.  AWARENESS: Be aware of your emotions and thoughts and recognize how your AWARENESS is separate.  HUMOUR: Remember to laugh. Take the humorous route. Don't take things too seriously.  SELF-ASSUREDNESS: Remember that you know yourself, and you have nothing to prove to anyone. You are who you are. Nothing anyone says can change that. Nobody can make you feel anything with their words. The only person who can fix you is you. All you have is you. This is true freedom.  EGO: Take nothing personally. Recognize your ego. Remember the seven deadly sins. Realize your insignificance in the universe. Forget the need to feel special. Stop identifying with labels. Stop seeking approval. Ask if your negative comments or actions are coming from a place of fear and anger.  PATIENCE: Recognize that everyone and everything is created and driven by the universe and what happened previously. Realize this is what is. Remember the child self and the higher order thinking self. Be patient with people and yourself. Realize that you can't always know now. Realize that you can't control ignorant opinions and they are not personal.  OUTROSPECTION: Look outwards. Listen. Watch people. Learn about them. Ask them questions.  ACCEPTANCE: This life was not made to happen in your favour, so do not impose your own expectations upon it. Nothing belongs to you. Accept that there will be ups and downs. Accept confusion - the world cannot be deduced to dichotomies and simple categories."

There isn't much more to mindfulness than being mindful, because the point of mindfulness is being mindful. I mean it's great for you that mindfulness helped, but that doesn't mean it'll help others. Not really some instances either, a lot of people have very specific problems (such as clinical depression) that most likely need therapeutic help."
Mindfulness,30nyhx,Semaug,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:31:45 2015 UTC,"Perhaps if I explain to you some of what I mean by it being more than 'just being mindful', you will have a better appreciation of where I am coming from.   I turned to alcohol initially because I felt at the mercy of my own brain. It felt like I almost had an allergy to low mood. Mindfulness allowed me to see that the problem was never my mood but my thinking around these moods. I discovered the wonderful freedom of being able to sit with low mood without it leading to depression - something that would happen every few months and now never happens.   I developed an obsession with alcohol that lasted almost two decades. I hit my first rehab at 19, and I was living on the streets at 25. I was in and out of treatment programs like a yo-yo and nothing seemed to be helping me. Mindfulness allowed me to see that alcohol was incapable of providing what I needed, but that there was a path that could help me find comfort in my own skin. I began to be able to question the beliefs and thinking that held me back in life.   Yes - if people are deeply depressed, they are likely going to need more help than mindfulness. In my experience (as an RN and drunk), many of those who fall into addiction develop recurrent depression as a result of the substance abuse. There are also many who had mild depression (people like me) before they began abusing as self-medication, but didn't realize this was the case. In both of these cases, mindfulness can be a great help.    Is mindfulness going to work for everyone? No, and the same can be said for every other treatment out there. I would say for most people dealing with addiction, it can be at least a useful tool if not a primary tool."
Mindfulness,30m5te,dxmtolife,6,Sat Mar 28 17:22:35 2015 UTC,"I know this may seem counterintuitive... but great!  I used to have the same issue.  I have a panic disorder, and my breathing can both help and create panic.  My heart would race, 10 seconds into meditating with countless thoughts flying around: would I have a panic attack, am I doing it correctly, when will this click and be easier?    The nice thing, is that being in the moment really lets you take the chance to let go, and let that anxiety be.  Remember the goal isn't to flip a switch and never feel anxious again.  Anxiety is a base emotion and it needs its space to work.  Fighting it away or ignoring it will help create more conflict internally.  Physically, you need to relax your brain to where deep breathing isn't anxiety causing, which will take time and many repetitive actions of feeling safe and calm while meditating.  Mentally, when you feel this way, try acknowledging your anxiety, and take a mindful pause to understand what you're anxious about, and each step (no matter how small) your mind takes from deep meditative breathing, to anxiety.  Try to be the curious observer here, and don't see yourself as an action taker.  By calmly noticing each of these steps, you will become more aware and have more native control of the process.  Bring a notebook!  Write it out!  And then try again.  Just as we fall while learning to walk time and time again, you'll feel that you 'fell' while meditating.  Nothing to do but smile, and take another stab. :)"

That was a good one, for me."
Mindfulness,30jbbn,dxmtolife,13,Fri Mar 27 21:27:40 2015 UTC,"Let it all go.  The past doesn't really exist.  You can't go back there.  The future will come in time and you can get to that later.  For right now just be right where you are and nothing else.  Listen, feel, breathe, and keep yourself anchored in the moment completely, if only for a few moments.  Just be right here, right now and get to the analysis and planning later."

Mindfulness,30jbbn,nashife,7,Sat Mar 28 06:21:29 2015 UTC,"Try practicing ""non-resistance"" more explicitly.  Your post sounds like you're experiencing frustration (a form of ""resistance"" and self-judgement).  Now that you know that's something you're doing, try practicing accepting whatever experience you're presently having just as it is instead of judging yourself.  If that present moment is a moment of busy-brain stuff or thinking about your work or something, that's still okay. Being aware and present and non-resistant and non-judging of what you're feeling and experiencing is still successful mindfulness. Even if you're only in the present moment for a short moment, that's still success.  You don't have to be ""mindful"" all the time. Think of the mindfulness state of mind as a place to visit frequently, touch base, reset, etc, but it's not something you should worry about trying to be in 100% of the time."
Mindfulness,30jbbn,boldra,4,Sat Mar 28 05:50:11 2015 UTC,"I finds it helps to think of the ""returning to meditation"" as the main goal. It's not as much about staying in the awareness of now as coming back to now. After all, this is the skill that will have more application in your everyday life.    I compare it to when I was learning to juggle: for the first few days I didn't seem to get much better at juggling, but I quickly got better at picking up the balls from the floor. Imagine that picking up the balls had been the skill i was trying to learn - I would have been grateful every time I dropped them, because - yay! - now I have another chance for a lesson in picking up balls!   This is the attitude I try to cultivate in meditation: gratitude that my mind has become distracted, because that means I've been given another opportunity to practice the main part of the lesson, coming back to now. I think this is what the masters mean when they say that the universe is your teacher, but maybe I'm rambling."
Mindfulness,30jbbn,everyoneisflawed,2,Sat Mar 28 08:38:32 2015 UTC,"You really need to let go of the ""all or nothing"" attitude, especially when it comes to mindfulness. Do you know how many years, or sometimes decades, it can take to reach a point where you are constantly mindful 100% of the time? Don't be so hard on yourself!  If I notice myself slipping out of a state of mindfulness, I will sometimes find a table or other stable object and put my hand on it, then say to myself, ""this is a table"", and then maybe touch other things and say ""this is a pencil,"" etc. That's what helps me, anyway!  And also, if you get stuck in this mindset of anything less than perfection being a failure, you will likely have a very hard time with this. Remember, you are not a robot! You do not have programming inside your brain. You are perfectly imperfect, and the fact that you tried means you have already succeeded."

I downloaded it once because I thought it was free, but before long, they asked for money to be able to access the actual useful stuff. $15 is just too much to ask to practice being mindful.

For some people it can be a good encouragement / way to commit to moving forward with the practice."
Mindfulness,30ij99,allltogethernow,4,Fri Mar 27 17:51:06 2015 UTC,"Good point. I've spent a lot of time thinking about this as well. I've found that, for me, active filtering and control of conversation does not mean that I'm actually being mindful. Instead, a pre-mindful attitude will let you say whatever you want and keep talking about anything. By practicing mindfulness by yourself you will naturally have things to say that are mindful. Before getting there, you will only be able to notice things as not very mindful or possibly less valuable. Being mindful, you act mindfully. Not being mindful, you don't act mindfully... and you can only try to be mindful."
Mindfulness,30j2pv,KernelofWisdom,2,Fri Mar 27 20:18:43 2015 UTC,"I think that this is a really good point and something novice meditators really need to hear.  Do not feel bad for having thoughts.  As you say, everyone has thoughts.  But you go on and it gets better.  It is like everything else, you get better with practice.  I meditate with a buddhist nun with close to 20 years of serious meditation practice and she will mention things she was thinking about during her meditations.  It helps to put things in perspective.  Having thoughts is not a problem.  The way you react and judge your thoughts can be a problem though.  So many people have told me they can't meditate because their mind races too much.  In fact I think I have heard this from almost everyone I suggest meditating to.  I like to put it like this: if you sit down and meditate for 15 minutes, you might only be mindful for a minute of it.  But that is better than zero of 15.  And being able to periodically realize you are thinking and bringing it back to your meditation anchor or object is an amazing real world skill to have.  Being ""bad"" at meditation actually helps you to be mindful in the real world when you naturally have constant thoughts."

Mindfulness,30dels,bobelli,9,Thu Mar 26 13:53:37 2015 UTC,"Accepting the present moment is to be aware of the present, to be conscious of it no matter how painful or pleasant the moment is. Acceptance of the present doesn't necessarily imply inaction. You can say, for example ""I accept that in the present, I feel nervous. But it's within my power to change that. ""  Complacency robs you of the will to action. Complacency says, ""at the present moment I feel nervous. Such is life.""   At least that's how I think of it."
Mindfulness,30dels,veeberz,4,Thu Mar 26 16:36:48 2015 UTC,"Be in the moment and do shit about it, I like it."
Mindfulness,30dels,glassescontacts,2,Thu Mar 26 19:14:42 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I don't know if it is your wording but I don't know if I necessarily agree with this.  In my eyes mindfulness is a lot closer to your complacency quote of ""at the present moment I feel nervous. Such is life.""  When I feel nervous I am mindful of it but do not look to actively change it.  I note that I am anxious but I do not say ""I need to stop this feeling"" or ""I can or should change this feeling.""  I just notice it, accept it, and try not to attach judgment to it.  It seems counterproductive but actually trying to be active about banishing nervousness tends to cause you to overthink and be more nervous while just observing and not judging the nervousness helps to alleviate it."
Mindfulness,30dels,BrStFr,6,Sat Mar 28 12:05:55 2015 UTC,"Great question.  In my own experience, I have found that the objective, accepting stance of mindfulness makes me more responsive and less complacent-- there is a clarity in seeing how things are and knowing what needs to be done, and many of the obstacles to action (e.g. urges, thoughts, judgments) are reduced in influence when I am mindful of them as part of the situation."
Mindfulness,30dels,fliphkd23,3,Thu Mar 26 14:28:45 2015 UTC,"So keeping in mind of the destination and see what needs to be done in the present, good point :)"
Mindfulness,30dels,Agent1407,2,Thu Mar 26 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"This is how I view it too. Being mindful of the present allows me to feel inspiration - free of judgment - for my next actions. Or I will have peace with the moment as is and love it thoroughly. There is no complacency as I'm not accepting for the sake of accepting, rather I accept because I understand. And if I can't understand, I try to remain aware of that and wait for understanding to come.   Completely tangential: explaining how I view mindfulness can sometimes be like trying to pick an egg shell out of a pan of cracked eggs. You can see it, but when you try to pick it out it stays just at the edge of your fingertips evading capture."
Mindfulness,30dels,son_of_bokonon,3,Fri Mar 27 13:52:42 2015 UTC,"Acceptance is internal. You fully accept what is, every moment. Then, externally, you can act to change it if possible, but will not be a reactive, conflicted response."

Mindfulness,3068rb,acoodle_doodle_doo,4,Tue Mar 24 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but I think that practicing mindfulness will actually give you the ability to focus on your imaginary worlds. Rather than drifting between absolute reality and your imagination, you might find that your mind doesn't wander from what you are trying to create to start thinking about bills, work, relationships etc (I really need to learn to practice what I preach though...). Mindfulness is about projecting positivity onto your everyday life, creating is always positive."
Mindfulness,3068rb,motiebob,4,Tue Mar 24 22:22:27 2015 UTC,you want the ability to be mindful at all times. whether you do it or not is supposed to be up to you
Mindfulness,3068rb,seekunrustlement,2,Tue Mar 24 23:47:42 2015 UTC,"You might say writing a novel is far out on the fantasy spectrum, but even this conversation itself requires a bit of imagination.   I don't think it would be helpful to speculate too much on this. Never let your mind settle on anything semantic as the 'final answer'. Just feel. What's it like to be alive? Do you know you're alive? How? If every one of your senses were suddenly removed, would you still know? Settle into this 'just being'.   If that sounds whacky, ignore it, I'm just riffin' here.  Where does creativity come from? Do we really, actively, ""think"" things up? Where does a flash of creativity come from?   In my experience, all this voice in my head does is muddle things up with a running commentary - it introduces tension, spins stories, and craves ownership. Creativity seems to flow best when this voice gets out of the way. Mindfulness is for thinning out this voice, that's all.  Now, imagination can also be a form of craving, or aversion. If I am fantasizing about what my neighbor looks like in their skivvies, then yes, mindfulness practice will eliminate such unskillful habits, sooner than later. Seemingly more innocuous forms of imagination will also diminish, as they are also the mind craving something, indulging in delusion to combat unpleasantness of present circumstances, (we are usually unaware when this is occurring). This is to your detriment, as is any avoidance behavior. Such actions will sprout feelings of agitation, anxiety, maybe lust, etc. Craving = suffering.   ""Imagination"" can mean several things I suppose. I gathered you are also thinking of ""creativity"". Ultimately, it depends how unbalanced the mind is, i.e. how much craving is in the mind. Proper mindfulness reduces craving, not necessarily creativity per se."
Mindfulness,3068rb,filmmakersbleed,2,Wed Mar 25 04:07:57 2015 UTC,"My understanding, and the way that I'm approaching this, is that I want to be able to use my mindfulness practice to allow myself a choice, in any given moment, to simply experience what's happening right now.  It is not my aim to do this in all moments of my life.  I still want to think about the future, to analyze my past, to daydream, and to distract myself from the real world at times.  None of that is changing.  What may change is that I don't have to spend all of my time in one of those states.  I can also choose moments to let go of all of those things and just experience what's happening right now, and to find places in my life where I can gain benefits from doing so.  Without mindfulness practice, I'm not sure I really had that choice before in a real way.  Now I do, and its got the potential to be a great addition with practice.    There are countless times every day where I choose something else instead."

I also post very rarely, so please forgive any inadvertent breaches of etiquette.  Mindfulness helped me quit drinking, using drugs and smoking cigarettes, and it is central in helping me maintain sobriety without very much struggle at all. I rarely have the urge to engage in unhealthy behaviors, but when I do mindfulness is very useful in a few ways:   It helps me catch the initial impulse early on, rather than once it has become a giant snowball that I am very unlikely to stop.  It allows me to maintain a moment to moment awareness so that I can live a healthy lifestyle that minimizes the amount of stress and worry that can also lead to that snowball. Lastly, it has helped me understand that things are always okay if we stay in the moment, and that they really only become problematic when we begin to compare them. Being sober is wonderful, and it is something I would always choose, but when I am stressed or lonely being intoxicated starts to seem good, but only by comparison. There are no comparisons when we are mindful of the present.   I am also a counselor. A majority of the interventions I use are mindfulness oriented, and I have seen them be very helpful to people in my practice.  I hope this was helpful, and that you have a good week ahead of you."

It is hard for me to name specific resources for addiction because I tend to believe in a mindful lifestyle rather than just a practice, but these books may be a good place to start.  Full Catastrophe Living (http://books.google.com/books/about/Full_Catastrophe_Living_Revised_Edition.html?id=fIuNDtnb2ZkC)  Sitting Together (https://books.google.com/books?id=t3CnAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=sitting+together&hl=en&sa=X&ei=s98QVZy2OMOuggTmt4DYBQ&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=sitting%20together&f=false)  How God Changes Your Brain (https://books.google.com/books?id=sUcqCmw_PB0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=how+god+changes+your+brain&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LOAQVY6wH4-INpHageAG&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=how%20god%20changes%20your%20brain&f=false)  My current favorite, Radical Acceptance (https://books.google.com/books?id=AlfnvT4sNo0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=radical+acceptance&hl=en&sa=X&ei=neAQVaCsKMSjgwTT1oPAAg&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=radical%20acceptance&f=false)  There are a lot of other books, but these are what come to mind for me right now.   I think the best resource is a relationship with a qualified counselor or meditation teacher, especially if they have training in addiction issues. Groups are also very cool as a supplement to individual sessions. I understand that this can be expensive though, and sometimes our circumstances or location do not offer these things. I was self-taught for the first few years and I think I re-invented the wheel a few times when it was not necessary.   More than anything, actually having a practice is the most important part. I encourage people to start with concentration oriented practices before moving into mindfulness in and of itself, and to be careful if you have trauma in your past as open monitoring can allow difficult things to arise. The book Sitting Together (listed above) does a very good job explaining and exploring the difference in the practices (also moving into compassionate acceptance).   I will apologize ahead of time if I do not reply to something else very quickly! I will make a point to look in the upper right corner when I log on.

Mindfulness,2zys8x,420iszero,11,Mon Mar 23 18:30:41 2015 UTC,"I think to a large extent I used drugs because I had a very low view of myself. I told myself I was bad at socializing, over-emotional, and unable to get anything done. Everything that equated to happiness was ""impossible."" There seemed to be no way I could transform my life into something that brought deep fulfillment, inspiration, curiosity, and happiness.   Mindfulness helped me to throw away all the ""should's"" and to believe in the ""could's."" It's not true that I ""should"" be a social butterfly that everyone is going to like. I can respect my introvert nature and spend more time alone doing things I really enjoy - art, listening to music. It's not true that I ""should"" be ""successful"" and land that massively prestigious career. It is possible to follow my passion and find deep fulfillment every day.   Maybe take a moment to consider whether you're the type of person to approach life, process, and act based on thinking, feeling, or gut instinct. Then try to focus on how you can actualize happiness for yourself based on your personal style.    If you're the thinking type: Can you think clearly while on drugs? What are all the wonderful things you could dream up while sober and able to actively process life? You could use your wonderful gift of cognition to radically transform your life into what you always thought it could be. You take it one step at a time, very methodical, and think of how you can apply yourself next. You address one small problem at a time, and each time you resolve an issue your self-confidence and appreciation of others' perspective grows. You are what you think you are. Stop thinking of yourself as an addict who cannot change. You are amazing! Think of all the possibilities! Your mindful awareness of your thoughts can help you get a real sense of all the possible directions, and you will be able to sort our where to go next. If you're the emotional feeling type: This is where I am. I realized I used drugs to suppress feelings I ""shouldn't"" be having. Once I started utilizing mindfulness, I started feeling truly okay feeling as much and as deeply as I did/do. I get my sense of connection and motivation from feeling everything. Brene Brown talks about how we cannot selectively numb. When we try to avoid our feelings of anger, sadness, and fear out of an incorrect assessment that they are unacceptable or useless, we lose our ability to feel anything joyful either. At the end of a long, hard, emotionally draining day nowadays, I feel such joy that I'm still alive, I survived it, and I'm going to keep going. When I'm truly present with someone to the extent that their pain just makes me ache to my core, I also feel this enormous swell of compassion and love for them. Eve Ensler (author of The Vagina Monologues; audio of this talk here) talked about how, even though I might not ""feel"" like I have the emotional wherewithal to bear someone else's pain - when I do, it's like acknowledging that pain that exists within me also - and in the act of acknowledging it, it is able to move on. So mindful awareness of my own and others' emotions stops being ""good"" or ""bad"" and it's all just wonderful and vibrant. It's hard, and you need to remember self-care. Take those baths. Paint your nails or get a massage. Do whatever makes you feel recharged. I promise, the world will drain you. But after you're all drained out, the universe will fill you with awe and inspiration. You can take it; you will be stronger. You will become a warrior able to help those who have been in pain like you. If you're the gut feeling type: How does using drugs make you feel about your life and future? The wellbeing of yourself and the ones you love? Do you get this ominous sense that your life is slowly going down the tubes, but at the same time the feeling that you could stop it if you could only get your senses about you? You're right. You're heading down the wrong path. If you can only stop using drugs for a bit (in my case, this was about 90 days), you will really regain your senses and be able to tune in to your gut intuitions. You will know the right way to go if you stop blinding yourself. It can be totally overwhelming, getting that sense of the enormity of everything that can be done. But if you use mindfulness to root you into the present moment, your gut will gently guide you to the next step, one small step at a time.    I love this passage from Paulo Coelho's Warrior of the Light:   The Warrior of the Light has learned that it is best to follow the light.  He has behaved treacherously, he has lied, he has strayed from the path, he has courted darkness and everything was fine, as if nothing had happened.  Then an abyss suddenly opens up.  One can take a thousand steps in safety, but a single step too many can put an end to everything.  The Warrior stops before he destroys himself.  When he makes that decision, he hears four comments:  ""You always do the wrong thing.  You're too old to change.  You're no good.  You don't deserve it.""  He looks up at the sky.  And a voice says:  ""My dear, everyone makes mistakes.  You're forgiven, but I cannot force that forgiveness on you.  It's your choice.""  The true Warrior of the Light accepts that forgiveness.   You can still do this. Your abyss hasn't yet swallowed you whole. But you must act NOW. Focus on every moment and your enormous potential to enjoy life just as it is. In the end, you will make a huge positive impact on this world by just being true to yourself. Don't worry about that for right now. The long-term outcomes are not important. What is vital for right now is just recognizing how amazing you are, just as you are. Use your faculties in every way you can. Your mindful attention to your personal way of approaching the world will help you to more fully become YOU. Ask for help when you need it. You know the right thing to do. You got this!  Edit for practical tips: What did I do, exactly? First and foremost, I cut everyone who used drugs/alcohol out of my life, including my family, while I got everything straightened out. (I don't keep in contact with any friends who still use. I only see family members who use in very small doses, few and far between.) I also saw a lot of drug and alcohol counselors. I saw different therapists for several years, which I think was very helpful in getting an objective view on what I was doing as well as an idea of how to go about loving myself despite all the things I so abhorred. I also did a lot of reading about mindfulness, reconnected with old friends who were sober, and got back into my art and writing. Hope that helps! Much love!"

Mindfulness,2zys8x,carlius,8,Mon Mar 23 04:34:14 2015 UTC,"I haven't overcome it yet, but I'm using mindfulness to work through sugar and internet addiction.   Today for the first time that I can recall, I had an experience while sitting of feeling more pleasure and joy than I've ever gotten from sugar or internet.  I was just feeling so relaxed and so grateful to be doing something wholesome, feeling my breath smooth me out and calm me down, in and out. So at least these experiences do exist and point in a good direction.  Do you practice with a community? Sounds like you're asking something important and might be having a tough time currently.  Feel free to ask or say anything at all.  I haven't resolved my issues, but I've spent 5 years practicing with them, so I can talk a little bit about what that's like."
Mindfulness,2zys8x,sawdawg,4,Mon Mar 23 11:56:02 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in hearing more about your internet addiction and using mindfulness. My biggest thing is that when we talk about addiction, we say, ""stop using that thing and never touch it again or you're screwed."" Well, that doesn't work for just about anyone in the modern world who gets addicted to internet. Walking away from internet would require losing contact with friends and family, getting a new job (which at some point would probably require using the internet to find/apply), replacing all but one hobby... I even manage social media at work, so I have Facebook and Twitter up on my computer most of the day.  Since you are on reddit, I assume you are figuring out the necessary balance that I can't seem to get to."

Mindfulness,2zys8x,carlius,2,Mon Mar 23 22:22:06 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I'm not sure if I've actually figured anything out.  I moved into an intensive mindfulness residential training program because I wanted a rigorous schedule that would guarantee me practicing whether or not I wanted to and not spend all my time on the internet.   That said, I still struggle with the addiction when it pops up. I feel like I'm just beginning to learn when and how to say ""No"" to the urge to browse reddit during work hours (Though it still happens) and to not even wander near my computer when it's time for bed, because of how quickly things spiral out of control, I lose sleep, start hating myself, etc.  I guess what I've learned is that I'm really grateful for this community, and that for me, it's a long path towards making it manageable, much longer than I wish it was.  What inspire your original post?"
Mindfulness,2zys8x,oh_shit_bro,3,Mon Mar 23 23:46:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for remembering. I guess my inspiration is mostly what the post itself says... Internet has been at best a habit, if not an all-out addiction for as long as I can remember. Some of my earliest memories involve learning how to connect to the old school bulletin boards before AOL came along. When I was a teenager and we got cable internet (but still only one computer), I discovered I could sneak online after my parents went to bed. I had a lot of late nights waiting for my dad to leave the computer so I could check my e-mail and forum posts--which usually hadn't changed since looking at them just a few hours earlier because most people who use the internet don't seem to be as eager to be constantly connected as I am. I got an after school job and one of the first things I saved for was my own computer. Once I had that, I would stay up half the night using the internet and sleep through school.  My mind, after all this time, seems to be deeply entrenched in this habit of opening a browser and automatically going to certain pages. I don't even have to think about unlocking my phone and getting to Facebook; my thumb knows where to go. I sit down and instinctively start playing with my phone, I talk to my wife while looking at Twitter. I can go on, but I think you get the point.  But like I said, it's not a simple matter of deactivating social accounts, swearing off computers, and never touching either again. I use a computer most of the day at work (where I have three monitors--one with my work's [and personal] social media, one for my actual work, and one that always has my e-mail and calendar up.), my smart phone is provided by my job, my friends and family don't even call anymore; they just know I'm probably going to be easily reached on Facebook. I have wasted entire days at work browsing the internet (like, I worry sometimes that they'll actually look at what I do someday and realize how much $$$ it's costing them--not to mention it's dishonest), my wife suffers because I stare at a computer all day then come home and stare at my phone and pretend to listen to her, I'm absolutely terrible at having conversations with physical humans.  So there must be some kind of balance that can be reached where I can stop ""needing"" to be constantly engaged with a false world where screen names represent people who actually have lives. But anything I see about addiction always says to stop using whatever you're addicted to and never touch it again. That's possible with drugs and such, but in 2015 people who don't get online are no better off than someone who is constantly on."

Mindfulness,2zys8x,Nanc83,4,Mon Mar 23 06:10:09 2015 UTC,"Avoidance. It's probably not the most mindful approach to addiction, because avoidance implies suppressing thoughts, but when the addiction is chemical, and tends to decrease with time, a certain amount of thought avoidance (i.e. realizing that I can come back to the thoughts later, instead of dealing with them now) can lessen the urges over time of the addiction. This has helped me considerably when approaching certain food, chemical, and habitual ""addictions"", or tendencies. Emotional addictions, tendencies to follow thought paths and focus attention on external thoughts, however, are greatly hindered by this kind of ""avoidance"" pattern, because pushing away thoughts tends to re-ify them and increase their strength. So depending on how much of the addiction has an emotional component (alcoholism for example often has a very strong emotional component), avoidance may not work at all.    If you're simply in the habit of doing something that you know you shouldn't be, however, it works pretty well."

I use mindfulness, (though I didn't realize that's what I was doing), by breathing deeply.  Diaphragm deep!  Then very slowly letting it out.  EVERY SINGLE TIME I crave a cigarette.  I not only have come to the point that I can breathe deep without coughing, but before that deep breath is let out, the craving has passed.  I smoked 1/2 pack a day, (on average), for 30 years.  I made a plan, I made a promise to myself, and I made it work.  I can honestly say, I still have cravings, but through mindfulness, I've overcome the cravings.  I breathe.  Sometimes that's all you have to do.  And for me, I can do it without coughing, and before it's too late."

Mindfulness,2z8f22,Mwest3,7,Mon Mar 16 14:15:45 2015 UTC,"I find that this lies at the core of a lot of issues and to be honest, resisting reality that is. And it feels like the more I stop resisting, the more stuff tend to come up that needs to be let go of. The actual act of stop resisting once you find the resistance isn't all too tricky I think although sometimes it can take courage and patience. The tricky part I find is to actually see what you are resisting, to find the fears inside. All of those things seemed to come forth the better I got at observing with non-attatchment the content in my mind, to let all feelings be exactly how they are and let whatever thoughts that come just come without getting involved so to speak. Adyashanti explained this pretty well I think, that you can treat meditation kind of as a question. ""What happens if I would allow everything to be exactly how it is?"". That includes thought, emotion, sence preception, everything. It's not a question to intelectually ponder on, more like an experiment, just see what happens when you stop trying to change anything. If you find yourself ""trying"" to let everything go, as a kind of way to ""getting it right"", that also is something you can observe, not getting involved in and do nothing about. Get the idea?  But maybe this diddn't answer your question. What kind of resistance do you experience?"
Mindfulness,2z8f22,Nesii,3,Mon Mar 16 15:07:50 2015 UTC,"You know you are resisting when there is tension in the mind/body, which will be accompanied by recurrent thoughts commentating on some story which is essentially about why circumstances should be other than what they are, and how we can make them better.  This can be very subtle, and hard to catch because it's been the our normal state nearly all our lives.  Everyone will have different tell signs - for example my face tightens, my right leg tenses up. This is just a common one for me, no need to fixate on any particular manifestation, just notice the tension in your head and in your body, relax it, and completely surrender the thought-narrative. Drop the story like a hot potato, no matter how convincing, or even how relatively true it appears to be. The fact is, it is causing you stress and at that point is best to abandon, at least until you are balanced again. When you drop it, perhaps it persists, or lingers in the background, perfectly fine, just don't feed it or give it attention, and relax into placing attention on the breath, or your body."

Under symbolic you might put, fun, career, community, novelty, etc.  The goal of this exercise is to make yourself more familiar with the dual aspects of your existence to help you better recognize which one you are ""in touch with"" at any given moment."

The breath is a tool along that path but deep, purposeful breathing alone is not enough. We use meditation, without manipulating the breath, to gain true control over the mind. Even then, life will happen. Balance will be lost. Attachments to expectations will spark ego thoughts. We breathe deep to create space so that we can take back control of our minds so that we can let go of our thoughts.... And repeat the cycle over and over. With enough practice we can regain balance quicker and quicker but the breath is one part of that process."

So much of my life is built around always having some kind of stimulus/distraction available.  When I shut down those distractions, even for just a few minutes, and focus inward, thoughts are going to come.    Sometimes those thoughts are mindless, or about busywork tasks for my job.  Sometimes they are pretty heavy and serious.   Sometimes I find that I'm in a state of mind to calmly say ""ok, there's a thought, hi thought, I'll watch you go by"" and go back to my breathing or whatever, no matter what the thought is.   But sometimes... oh man it hits hard.  It'll be something that hurts, something I don't really want to be focused on, and I find myself unable in that moment to let it go by calmly.  Maybe I'll find myself crying briefly on occasion if something hits just right.  I try not to push that away, and to just say ""ok, that's what the experience is going to be today.""  Maybe that's what I needed to get back into my day calmly and peacefully.   I dunno, honestly, because I am new to this, but you're definitely not alone.  I'm currently doing this in a class setting (meeting one a week and then practicing specific things at home).  I noted on my ""homework sheet"" for the first week the times that I had thoughts linger that did cause some kind of distress.  The instructor's comment was ""You're practicing regularly, and that's good.  You don't have to like it, you just have to do it and be curious about it"".  So I took that to mean 'keep it up""."

Eventually if you can forgive yourself and her it will help your emotional reactions.  Forgiveness has nothing to do with right and wrong or justice.  Forgiveness is how you close the chapter on emotional pain you inflict upon yourself.

Mindfulness,2yvnb6,laDouchee,2,Fri Mar 13 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"Almost everybody goes through this at some point in their journey. Specially the people who have volatile brain chemistry due to either poor mental health or poor nutrition etc.   It's important not to get discouraged though. If you don't mess up how will u realize what ur doing wrong? Having experienced incorrect methods and their outcomes makes it that much easier to identify the correct method when u finally arrive at it.   Mindfulness has become such a buzzword I think it's beginning to lose its core meaning now. 100 different people can do mindfulness in a 100 different ways. Only a few of them will do it the right way with proper understanding.   I think u should closely examine whatever method u r using. Try to understand how mindfulness works and experiment with doing it in different ways. Trust ur inner guru. Not the gurus outside.   Upsetting ones neurochemistry by forcefully burdening the brain can be life threatening. Believe me I've been there. Don't let it escalate to that. If things are quickly going south, stop immediately and let ur brain normalize. Then after a few weeks try again but try something different.   What usually happens is when u do any kind of meditation intensely ur brain releases a cocktail of feel good chemicals such as dopamine, serotonin, etc. as a response to extreme relaxation. That is what makes u feel euphoric while meditating and makes u feel untouchable for a little while even after ur session. But those chemicals are not abundant and you feel like shit and angry when the reserves are running low due to overuse. It is no different than a drug addiction really. If u use meditation as an escape from real life this effect would be even worse.   In my personal experience mindfulness can be done in an effortless manner that doesn't tax the brain and cause mood swings. You will have to find your own way of doing that as I'm unable to properly explain in words what I'm doing (rather what I'm NOT doing). All I can say is concentration is not needed for mindfulness. What's needed is effortless awareness. Awareness that doesn't depend on our egos having to do something. The way to dissolve the ego is to cut off its fuel. Namely ACTION. Remain actionless both in body and mind. Just remain aware of what's going on in the present moment. Don't react to anything. Don't control anything. Let it be. Let it go. Just KNOW what's happening. No concentration necessary.   Hope that helps....  Good luck with your journey!"
Mindfulness,2yvnb6,aop42,2,Fri Mar 13 13:15:44 2015 UTC,"I've been doing mindfulness meditation on and off for about a year now. This still happens to me and it did in the beginning too. I've been struggling with depression for a few years now and I had a lot of repressed anger and stuff like that. In the course of my everyday life I mind of push it to the back in order to function but when you take the time to sit quietly and not do anything then that stuff can come up. I think it's good because it's better to face that sort of thing. Then you get to know yourself better and accept yourself and then you can finally heal. You can't know that there's a problem until you face it, then you can do something about it or just even accept that it exists.  It's hard to hold those kind of things in mindfulness though because when they're happening or you're experiencing them they feel like your whole world. Like this is a definite definition of reality. I guess this is what they call ""over identifying"" with your experience. Because it's not you it's an experience. Or an expression, of energy.  But, whatever. Anyway I've been reading this book recently called ""Self-Compassion"" by Kristen Neff which has really been helping me in he process of just accepting the reality of my experience while still being kind to myself. It's a process but I'm working on it and so far it seems like they'll help a lot.   So good luck!  And yeah I think it's totally normal."

Mindfulness,2ytu6d,freenow82,2,Fri Mar 13 00:27:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean...  Everyone is responsible for their own actions.  If someone is verbally abusive towards their partner, their partner's response may be to act cold towards the abuser. This is one of many ways to express the emotion of ""hurt"", and is normal.   What is your question? Are we talking about ""blaming"" someone for reacting coldly to someone who has wronged them?"
Mindfulness,2ytu6d,coralto,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:03:00 2015 UTC,"Bingo.  If by acting coldly in expressing the emotion of hurt they themselves hurt their partner the abuser,  are they then responsible for their behaviour?  On one hand - everyone is responsible for their own actions. On the other - is this ""blaming"" a victim?"
Mindfulness,2ytu6d,coralto,4,Thu Mar 12 21:21:02 2015 UTC,"Clarify what you mean by ""responsible"". Should they feel bad? Should they be punished? Should the behavior be viewed the same way it would have been if they had acted coldly without provocation?   Further, what outcome are we hoping for? Are we going to focus on blaming the victim to the exclusion of persecuting the previous wrongdoing? Are we hoping to heal the relationship? Is this a pattern that we are hoping to break?"
Mindfulness,2ytu6d,gnon86,2,Thu Mar 12 22:43:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response, and everyone else too!  Responsible in that they should be in control of their actions and are held to account for their actions.  Should they feel bad?  - They have hurt someone by their actions, regardless of the provocation of these actions, are they then responsible for them?  Should they be punished? - Should there be negative consequences for their actions that hurt someone?  Should the behavior be viewed the same..... provocation? - I guess this is the very centre of my question and I'd like to focus on it. Is provocation relevant if we are all responsible for our own actions? When is the responsibility of a victim's actions theirs and when is the responsibility of their actions due to the provocation?  What outcome are we hoping for? - Not to repeat the behaviour I guess...?  Are we going to focus on blaming....wrongdoing? - Can the previous wrongdoing be persecuted after an apology?  I guess the final two questions are the same, to stop the actions in order to heal the relationship.  Thanks again for your reply"

Try thinking ""this is my thought"" and notice how ridiculous it is that a thought could own another thought.  In general seeing thoughts and sensations as separate objects in consciousness is the first stage, called Knowledge of Mind and Body, of the sixteen stages leading to stream entry (i.e. first stage of enlightenment). So you're nicely on your way!   (the next stage is called Knowledge of Cause and Effect, where you start to see more clearly how objects in consciousness can cause feelings in your body and vice-versa)  Practice well."

Mindfulness,2yi2c5,UnderwaterDialect,4,Mon Mar 9 23:57:19 2015 UTC,"Resistance is a physical and mental sensation.  Right now, ask yourself if you have any tension in your shoulders or legs.  Take a minute and focus on relaxing them.  The tenseness is what resistance feels like, and relaxing is what acceptance feels like.  You can notice mental resistances in places you try to deny, reject, or judge reality.  For instance, you might avoid or feel discomfort looking in the mirror because you think you look too fat, too bald, too ugly, whatever.  You might be watching TV instead of preparing for the job interview or presentation that you are anxious about.  Mental resistance is a defense mechanism the mind uses to avoid a painful emotional reaction.  But by ignoring reality we only build fear and barriers to acceptance.  Through acceptance and awareness can you dissolve the fears and beliefs that cause the emotional reaction."

Mindfulness,2yf3ap,schakrabarti,1 point,Mon Mar 9 06:47:56 2015 UTC,"If one finds hope helpful than by all means go for it, but in a way it doesn't seem all that mindful to me to rely on hope. I've come to think that hope is a kind of counteract for fear, apathy and negativity and that it's more productive and peaceful to face and overcome that rather than trying to balance it out with hopeful thinking. It seems better to work on to stop telling yourself that this moment is wrong rather than hope that it will be better in the future."
Mindfulness,2yf3ap,Nesii,1 point,Mon Mar 9 11:37:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that by relying only on hope and doing nothing, one cannot change a situation. However only when one is hopeful, the person remains optimistic, works towards an outcome, and develops the right frame of mind that is needed to avail any opportunity that may come along the way. So, while hope is not the sole criteria, it is certainly a pre-condition for trying to achieve something."
Mindfulness,2yf3ap,Nesii,1 point,Mon Mar 9 12:06:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with being optimistic, and working towards an outcome and developing a right frame of mind. But somehow hope seems ultimately unnecessary. Hopelessness doesn't necessarily mean apathy or non-action to me. Its just a complete detachment to outcome. I think I could still strive to become a successful whatever just out of cheer enjoyment of the process rather than having any hope of anything turning out in a particular way. Thats the adventure of it for me. That it goes whatever way it goes. I can still make actions to make something more likely turning out a way that I prefer but without the hope that I will succeed, and that just being a complete acceptance that it's out of my control how things will turn out, that fooling myself that I have control makes me suffer. If I hope something will be a cirtain way, there is to me a need that it goes my way, but with just a preference, I can still work as hard but just shrug my shoulders and smile whenever I fail. Although it seems to requiere a lack of fear which I by no means have at this point, but this really seems to make sense to me. What do you think?"
Mindfulness,2yf3ap,Nesii,1 point,Mon Mar 9 12:39:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe there's a slight difference in the interpretation of hope, and hence the difference in approach.   Hopelessness doesn't necessarily mean apathy or non-action to me.   Putting in efforts into something with complete detachment of outcome is difficult to sustain for a long time. Even if one initially does not envision (or hope for) a particular outcome, and starts doing or does something for the sheer joy of it, or for the sense of adventure, but after a while, when the work has progressed quite a bit, he/she would naturally start hoping for some outcome.  So, hope starts building up at that point, which in turn increases the optimism and motivates the person to put in more efforts.   a complete acceptance that it's out of my control how things will turn out   Hope does not imply that there will be no external dependencies or things will be completely under my own control. Thatâs rarely possible. Hope to me is that I will be able to do my best, to navigate my way through things. Now, if X does not turn out the way I want, I will be disappointed for some time, but will still not lose hope, for Y or Z or something else may click. So, hope for me is the key to persistence."
Mindfulness,2yf3ap,Nesii,1 point,Mon Mar 9 13:52:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting. I'm not really saying that hope is wrong but I think you can come to a point where it's no longer needed. Lets just play with the thought that you had no hope of any outcome whatsoever, what stops you from doing whatever you're doing, or what makes you not being motivated or optimistic about it? Any concrete example? (I'm not trying to ""win you over"", just curious)"
Mindfulness,2yf3ap,Nesii,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"I donât mind this discussion.  Think we both will agree that outcome is not necessarily a monetary outcome. Even if you take up something as an adventure, the hope of stumbling upon something (whatever it may be) or discovering new facets could keep you going.  To give you an example of how the hope of an outcome keeps one motivated let me tell you about my own interest in blogging. Initially I started scribbling on my blog without any definite outcome in mind, as I enjoyed writing; but in the process I also started understanding what works what doesn't, through feedback from others or the lack of it.  Then, I started looking forward (or hoping) to receive some feedback (sort of outcome), which meant that at least a few people were interested in what I had to say. Positive outcome bolstered the hope of further positive outcome. It kept me going and motivated me to improve upon my writing. I participated in a blogging contest and won. This was again an outcome that I had not thought of initially, but nonetheless, it gave a boost to my confidence. I started participating in more contests with the belief that I will be able to create good content and the hope that I may win. Here I would like to say that without any sort of outcome (feedback, rewards) or the hope of it, there is a high possibility that I would have just lost the interest and given up.  If you have a different perspective, please do let me know. Good to engage in healthy discussions."

This is largely the reason I have personally become interested in mindfulness.  I find myself making rash decisions when I am overtaken by an emotion, and I often later regret those decisions.  Perhaps my personal goal for mindfulness is to simply observe my overwhelming emotions, acknowledge them, and move on."

It's like I'm trying to train my brain so that eventually I can mindlessly make my negative experiences positive and be able to be peacefully mindful through them. But we're only human so getting any frustration or need to vent out of our system is simply what's needed. That's the simplest way that I can think of in attempting to use both methods. One thing I've had to keep in mind, though is that I initially try to do things exactly as they are described without allowing any wiggle room, and it doesn't always do as much good as it sounds like it should. So I sometimes go on a tangent and amidst my tangent I acknowledge that I may be saying things that I don't fully mean, but I need to release that pent up frustration or energy instead of trying to force myself into a mindset I'm still working towards. I just let the emotions flow and find what mixture of methods works for me."

During a mindfulness session be mindful, but afterwards you might as well use the insight you gained from being mindful."

So, yes, I would add support to the other comments here that it is GREAT to engage with those negative thoughts, as long as you feel like you have adequate tools to do so in a way that is re-training your brain. The trick is that it is easy for 30 minutes of meditation to turn into 30 minutes of worrying about your problems, so if engaging with those negative thoughts in new for you, you may want to start with using guided meditations or a really set structure to walk yourself through so that you can start to get a feel for how to validity test them, adapt coping thoughts that work for you, and then expose yourself using the coping thoughts.

Mindfulness,2ya0nv,KernelofWisdom,2,Sun Mar 8 14:28:48 2015 UTC,"I work hard to avoid ruminating but it really depends on what you mean by negative thoughts. Negative thoughts are fine, just note them and move on. The idea is to notice when you're treating yourself poorly, just like you'd notice if you said these things to someone else you cared about. You can explore the feeling associated with the negative thought (think of it as a more mindful way to ""note"" the thought).  Thinking is necessary and important. Its future focused and only uses the past to figure out how to move forward. Often though, it can lead unproductive negative thoughts or worse, rumination. So be mindful of what you're doing and note it when its not productive.  Negative = ""That didn't go well. I don't think Frank thinks i'm doing well."" or ""Why can't my son just sleep through the night.""  Ruminating = emotionally charged thought were I repeatedly think over a situation. ""I cannot believe I said that. Frank stopped listening to me after I said that, I think he may have written me off.  How many times have I said something like that? I should just quit, I've lost credibility.""  Or ""If my son doesn't start sleeping through the night I'm going to go crazy. How many days has it been since I slept through the night? All I need is 5 hours in a row...  How come my wife never seems to wake up. Is she faking it?""  Thinking = Analysis of something, or working on a problem. Its not repetitive or emotionally charged and is productive. ""My presentation didn't provide sufficient context to the audience, that's probably why I kept getting those questions. I was defensive when I spoke to Frank, I'll explain to him what happened at lunch tomorrow.  Next time I'll will have someone review my presentation first."" or  ""I think my son is waking up in the middle of the night because he gets too warm. Should I try turning off the vent in his room?""  Its easy to assume you're thinking when you're just ruminating.  The way I tell the difference is by being mindful of my emotions.  Am I feeling stressed, anxious, angry? If so then its not productive and I need to be noting and letting go."
Mindfulness,2ya0nv,towhead,1 point,Sun Mar 8 15:45:58 2015 UTC,"The life we breathe into a negative force is proportional to how far we move away from the thought. We analyse our negative thoughts from several angles which contribute to the increased mass of that thought and the further we run the bigger it gets. Rather than repeating and recycling the thought, catch the original thought and visualise it as a sphere. Then move closer towards it until you are above the sphere and then dive into it. You realise that the sphere was actually a bubble and the moment you make contact it pops and with it, the negative thought. The surface of a negative thought is reflective just like a bubble and can only reflect your own fears back to you. Every time you catch a negative thought dive into it without a moments hesitation."

Any mind-altering activity, including meditation, can have positive and negative effects.  In my opinion, the potential negative effects of the kind of mindfulness taught in a therapeutic setting are likely very low.  The research I've come across suggests that people with dissociative tendencies or a history of psychosis should be cautious when practicing meditation because any experiences of not-self can be potentially destabilizing.  The dukkha nanas and the dark night experiences listed in the article are real concerns for very serious meditators; in my opinion, these experiences are highly unlikely for all but very serious, experienced meditators. The type of meditation taught in therapy would rarely come anywhere close to this level of practice.   The good message here is that yes, we should think critically about mindfulness practice.  Right now mindfulness is enjoying an initial period of relatively uncritical acceptance. As the research findings become clearer, this will stabilize and we'll have a better idea of what's hype, what's useful, and even what's harmful."

For example, she tells you to ""repeat in your mind"" that series of ""breathing in I..."" and ""breathing out I..."", she never paused to actually let us take our own breaths and repeat what she'd said. If she meant us to do it along with her, I found her pacing was much too fast for an actual meditative breathing rhythm.  The quick pace made it difficult for me to actually drop down into a mindful/meditative state.  If it were slower, or there were pauses in her voice that would allow us time to go at our own pace, I think this would be one I'd return to a lot."
Mindfulness,2xwtjp,Rair,7,Wed Mar 4 14:58:49 2015 UTC,"You are becoming aware of the steady torrent of thoughts that was there previously, but the fact that you are now aware of it doesn't mean it's going to simply go away. So long as you expect it to, they won't. Get used to having distracting thoughts. While you can't control thoughts, you can choose whether or not to identify with them.   Don't frame it as a struggle, ie you vs. your distracted mind. Thoughts are a great opportunity to see where your attachments are, and to release tension. Every release is going to bring you that much out of suffering, and train your mind not to be so sticky.   So.. when you sit to meditate, use the breath as an anchor, set your relaxed attention on the breathing process itself - know that you are breathing in, know that you are breathing out. Thoughts are guaranteed to come, when they do, notice you've been distracted, let the thought go, relax the tension in mind/body that the distraction created, then return to the present breath experience. Sometimes thoughts are running like a radio in the background, and we still are more or less anchored to the breath, in that case just keep breathing and relaxing. The key is not to give them attention. When a distraction comes, bring your attention off of it, and relax. It may still ""be there"" in some sense, and let it, but don't give it attention.  This letting go step is important. As long as you remain under the impression that certain thoughts are so important that you need to keep thinking them, you're going to get lost in the stream. Sit with the determination that no thought is important enough to take you out of your meditation. You need to sit with in the spirit of dying to the world, nothing matters."
Mindfulness,2xwtjp,filmmakersbleed,3,Wed Mar 4 16:12:04 2015 UTC,"To piggy back, in my experience it's not about eliminating thoughts, it's about creating some distance from them (not identifying as you say).   Thoughts will come, and you can examine them, but try not to get engaged in the thought process. Don't follow through with the thought but see it for what it is, let go, and move on. Just my two cents."
Mindfulness,2xwtjp,Bumgill,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:57:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's also import to not judge how you're doing with this practice. Just do it, and be as good at it as you are right now, without worrying whether you're doing it right or wrong, or getting better or not. No person can sustain this perfectly forever, so we all fail at it, every time we try. You learn that it doesn't matter. The important thing to do it again, because even a few seconds of awareness of now, and a few seconds of stepping outside your head, is good for you. So achieve what you can. Accept not being a pro at it. And be happy that you're trying. Best of luck."
Mindfulness,2xwtjp,mrCasual,0,Thu Mar 5 05:22:03 2015 UTC,"Also really agree with this point. Or if you DO find yourself judging how you practice, notice it and label it and learn what you can from that insight itself too!"
Mindfulness,2xwtjp,KernelofWisdom,1 point,Thu Mar 5 13:28:01 2015 UTC,"What you're noticing isn't uncommon and, as filmmakersbleed mentioned, it is actually the first step because you are AWARE of those thoughts. The reality is, meditation doesn't tend to illuminate the thoughts but it does help you get more of a break from them AND can bring you into a full awareness of what else is going on in a given moment (i.e. so thoughts, but also other internal stimuli such as feelings and mental images or external stimuli such as sounds, physical sensations unrelated to emotion, and sights). Essentially, it helps shift thinking and give you a more full reality so we don't identify so closely with thought.  What I have found is that it does take different meditations to help do that and I often pull from a quiver of options. The different options give different cues and insights to help broaden and shift your perspective, rather than struggle against it, and then (again, as mentioned by filmmakersbleed) you simply use the breath as an anchor to bring you back to your intention and the meditation itself if your mind wanders into thoughts not in line with your intention (i.e. worrying, planning, thinking, judging, etc.)   Once you start using different types of meditation to shift your perspective, progress on the thinking front tends to increase a bit, but really every day is a new day and some days attention is just harder than others. Accepting that is also just part of the practice.  If it helps, I do find it is useful to use guided meditations to help develop a set of meditations you really like best. There are lots of free ones on YouTube, or people post lots in /r/audiomeditation too. I also have a channel if you want a place to start: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbVOUcy7J6FmPXjkG1s-_HOEnyBmkk5F I would recommend starting with ""External awareness"" and ""Internal Awareness"" and then the others in that ""For Beginners"" playlist if you're new to guided meditations, but then feel free to expand and experiment. And definitely check out other channels too, everyone should find meditations that work for them personally so you might prefer someone else's style or their actual meditations which is great too!  Hope that helps :)"

I myself am a studying psychologist and feel like I get to read so much about the benefits of mindfulness meditation but found it hard to source guides that reflect that. There are a lot of historic and cultural, as well as practical reasons for that, but more and more is out there.  Here are a few resources I typically recommend and may help:   I find Mindful magazine (http://www.mindful.org/) tends to have really strong articles on mindfulness and recommendations for practice that are researched, so you can check them out online or consider a subscription  This site has some great tips for beginners that are written in a really down-to-earth way: http://buddhaimonia.com/50-mindfulness-meditation-tips-for-beginners/ I do find guided meditations on YouTube though you are right that it does sometimes take some sorting through.  I have a channel myself with some tips for beginners: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVbVOUcy7J6FmPXjkG1s-_HOEnyBmkk5F.

Any readings and meditations from John Kabat-Zinn Or Dr. Daniel Siegel are awesome and well-grounded in science.

Mindfulness,2xpzx0,mushinmind,4,Tue Mar 3 18:59:56 2015 UTC,"It all starts with the breath. So u can do some breathing exercises like four sides breathing: Inhale for four seconds Hold for four seconds Exhale for four seconds Hold for four seconds Repeat 6-8 times  Great before meditation, yoga, sleep, something important like a job interview   Taking control of our breath is the key to taking control of our mind. So beyond breathing exercises you can start just noticing your breathing more often throughout the day and especially when you are starting to feel anxious.   Like anything you want to get good at you need to find a good teacher. That could come in a lot of forms but yoga, martial arts, and tai chi are some good options. Just make sure the teacher is including breathing with everything they do."

You're just starting and you're already doing a bit better, so great job!  The tip I'd like to give you is perhaps to wear a bracelet on your wrist, one you don't wear now. Give this bracelet a special meaning , to help you remember to breathe. Everytime you see that bracelet you should think about your conscious breathing, and take  3 deep breaths.    Give it time. Your anxieties got a long time to develop, now give yourself some time to work on them."

Mindfulness,2x8ksm,walkfx,3,Thu Feb 26 15:09:16 2015 UTC,"interesting question!   it does not seem possible since the other activity seems to take up the full attention.   In programming, when my mind is fully occupied I am in a state of flow.  IMO, flow has much in common with mindfulness.  In both flow and mindfulness the subject (you) are controlling where you put your attention.  Where I think mindfullness might apply to mind work (programming, planning, et cetera) is when you are trying to be singled minded on the task at hand but suffer from distraction.  In this case you can try to be mindful of failures to be singled minded and then bring your attention back to where you want it to be."
Mindfulness,2x8ksm,funkiestj,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:03:28 2015 UTC,"I feel that flow arises spontaneously(after a duration of doing something quite intently) but mindfulness is something where we consciously direct our attention and keep doing so for the entire duration.  I was quite surprised to see that there isn't much information out there about integrating mindfulness and thinking tasks directly, or perhaps haven't chanced upon the right book."
Mindfulness,2x8ksm,visarga,3,Thu Feb 26 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"As a meditator of more than 20 years, I often wondered how to blend meditation with work related thinking. Recently I found a way to do such a meditation while programming. My technique was to record a mantra on the microphone and play it back on infinite loop (discretely, in my headphones, of course).  I use a question based mantra, like ""What am I perceiving? What am I feeling?"". It's an open ended phrase that refreshes attention without specifying what is to be felt or perceived.  This background mumbling follows me through my work hours. I allow it to enter my awareness but I also let it go. I used it also while watching movies or listening to music. It is capable to divert a small part of my awareness towards mindful observation.  The trick is not to have resistance towards it, but rather to allow it to enter your mind and give it a tiny part of your attention. You have to surrender to this question every time you hear it. It works gradually, but because it is on auto-repeat, its effects build up quickly."
Mindfulness,2x8ksm,controlpad008,2,Thu Feb 26 17:20:33 2015 UTC,"I can't exactly offer any advice, but for me, that is one of the main goals of mindfulness. I am taking rigorous classes in college so my life right now revolves around studying. My practicing mindfulness, I hope to train my ability to focus while studying and learning."
Mindfulness,2x8ksm,NowinNolose,-1,Thu Feb 26 15:43:37 2015 UTC,I asked something similar to experienced meditators and practitioners and basically the common response was that my ability to stay focussed on a particular task for a long while without break meant that my ability to concentration was very strong and that it would translate well when applied to meditation.   And you're right those activities are not very mindful. They feed the mind but the body is completely neglected. I would suggest installing a mindfulness app on your computer that is basically a relaxed alarm clock that bring you back to the present and your body.
Mindfulness,2x7pns,m1ndful,3,Thu Feb 26 08:06:54 2015 UTC,"I think the term comes from buddhism, they have a form of meditation thats called mindful meditation and they often speak about developing mindfulness. And Jon kabat-zin, one of the people that helped bringing mindfulness to the US says that you should also hear heartfulness in the same word. It's not having a full mind, it's more being mindful of the moment, including what goes on in your head.  And for the second question, mindfulness doesn't exclude thinking, it's more of a way to use thoughts more wisely. It's more of a different relationship to thinking (and emotions for that matter). You can still use thoughts for problems, plan for the future etc, but you rather filter out the unnecessary clutter, which a lot of people find to be most of the thoughts once they start paying enough attention. I would say that being in the moment improves self awareness, but that depends on what you mean by self-awareness.  If you define yourself by your thoughts and think that less thoughts would be less self awareness I can see that intuitive feeling. Although most people find that the self that thoughts create isn't really the whole picture. It's hard, especially in the beginning, to see what the mind actually does and how much influence you're thoughts actually have, how much knee-yerk reactions that goes on and how much of an impact judging really has on you, mostly because it's often hard to even be aware that you are thinking as your thinking. It took me a few months of practice to get a glimpse of how cluttered my mind was with unnecessary misunderstandings and bullshit really. And when you practice you tend to the moment just to get a feeling of how it is to not being lost in thought, and after a while you see more and more clearly whats going on and that the present moment is really all that there is. It's worth pointing out that you shouldn't take anyone's word for anything, find out for yourself, that's the only way it will have a real impact on you. It's not about beliefs, it's about your own realizations.   Im not sure if that was the answer you were after but I'm glad to try again if not. :)"
Mindfulness,2x7pns,Nesii,1 point,Thu Feb 26 20:10:09 2015 UTC,"I think the term comes from buddhism, they have a form of meditation thats called mindful meditation and they often speak about developing mindfulness.   Mindfulness is extremely important in Buddhism indeed, it is even part of the Noble Eightfold Path. But mindfulness is not restricted to Asian traditions, this practice can be found within the European tradition as well. For example, mindfulness is an important part of Stoic practice. There is much in common, but there are also important differences. Christopher Fisher has written an article which discusses the Stoic practice of mindfulness in depth: ProsochÄ: Illuminating the Path of the ProkoptÅn (PDF)."
Mindfulness,2x7pns,anaxarchos,2,Tue Mar 3 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"The answer to both questions is that clearing the mind is just one small part of it. Being mindful is to be aware of your thoughts. Be aware of what's happening in your head and in your surroundings. Be mindful of what you say, how you say it and how people react.  Clearing the mind is a tool for when you're alone and meditating. It lets you let the noise quieten down so you can hear your real thoughts."
Mindfulness,2x7pns,Promac,1 point,Thu Feb 26 08:22:45 2015 UTC,"I actually think the two questions are related (similar to what Promac states below).    It is a bit of a misconception that mindfulness is meant to help you ""clear"" your mind. Now, it can certainly help clear mental clutter when you need it (or at least slow it down, let's face it - getting rid of all those thoughts the whole time is rather unlikely) but it is more about being aware of the thoughts you ARE experiencing in a given moment. So the self-awareness comes from noticing that your mind is often worrying about your kids, or that you think a lot about your body image, or that you tend to be quite negative about work, or that you're very judgemental of yourself and keep telling yourself you're even doing the meditations wrong - whatever it is for you. Mindfulness is simply about noticing what is ACTUALLY going o, a bit of a break from just focusing on what we think about, and labelling it so you integrate that awareness.    Essentially, it is more about giving yourself the space and tools to explore your thoughts and really, intimately understand those thoughts AS WELL as your feelings, motivations, intuitions and much more.   That said, there are also a lot of mindfulness meditations that help reconstruct your thoughts and develop new ways of thinking, such as Love and Kindness or compassion meditations, visualizations, or positive outcome visualizations. As a thought, if you're new to mindfulness, you might want to explore a whole slew of meditation styles so you can develop a bit of a ""quiver"" of options that you are able to pull from based on your intention and needs that day.  There is a ton on YouTube and I am happy to share my guided meditation channel if you're interested, just let me know (I don't want this to become a self-promotion so I only send it if you want it).  Hope that helps :)  I can say I, personally, do find that mindfulness is much more about filling my mind with more awareness (hence mind-full) and only cutting the fat, so to speak."

Mindfulness,2x22ka,tjhunter1,21,Wed Feb 25 00:55:07 2015 UTC,"I was fortunate to see changes pretty quickly. Within a couple of weeks i was feeling positive effects, and after a year, i can say the process just builds and builds. Some days feel like setbacks, but the overall arc is undoubetdly positive.  The first thing was that I could finally get a break from my ruminating mid, which had a knack for making things far worse than what really was happening. That was within the first week.  The second thing was being able to be present for anything and everything that was happening, and found myself feeling far less stressed in general. Using mindfulness as much as possible in day-to-day situations. that was within the first couple of months.  The third thing was the ability to distance myself from my thoughts as they emerged, and view them more objectively. This gave me healthy breathing time and far less reactivity in situations that would trigger anxiety. This one took about three-four months after my sitting practice became regular.  Lastly was a more philosophical shift, that showed me how the world truly operates, and that my thoughts about external circumstances being necessary for happiness, safety, and comfort were completely wrong. I have reconnected with a sense of self love that hadn't felt since I was a child. That has been ongoing since the beginning, but also emerged in the third to fourth month.  Whatever you do, I encourage you to keep at it. Some days will be awesome, others may be flat. Best of luck to you, and I hope you get to the point where you no longer feel like you identify with those thoughts that have brought you here."
Mindfulness,2x22ka,paulexander,6,Wed Feb 25 06:28:45 2015 UTC,Awesome reply!  Could you please go into more detail about your actual day to day practice?  How would you describe the nuts and bolts or practicing mindfulness?  Thanks!
Mindfulness,2x22ka,rainman18,3,Wed Feb 25 15:08:04 2015 UTC,"For the first few months, it took a bit to get me to sit regularly. I would say that the rule of thumb was that I tried to shoot for a 20 minute sit. In reality, some days, I could only commit to 5 or 10 minutes. And I completely endorse the idea that if all you can do is a few minutes, then by all means, do that. There's no judgement and no contests to win. For some of us, it's more of a marathon than a sprint, so think more long-term. Some days, I would do multiple shorter sits (five minutes before work, two minutes during lunch, maybe another 5 or 10 minute after I got home). I was stunned at how effective even those were.  I am at the point now where I am going for one hour sits. Again, in reality, some nights are more like 30-40 minutes.  The ""nuts and bolts""? First and foremost, you are there to observe the present moment as best as you can. Simply bear witness to the truth of whatever that moment brings. If the mind wanders, gently come back to the breath (or whatever other object you've chosen). No judgement, no commentary. Again, there are no contests to win.  Work your way up with your observations. I personally like to start with Mindfulness of body, do a slow body scan,  then work my way up to the state of mind, and bare sense awareness (Liking, disliking, or neutral). Whatever you see is all fair game. Over time, you may be able to observe thoughts as they arise.  Past that, I am a huge advocate for extending the practice by employing other techniques like Radical Acceptance, and if you find yourself dealing with difficult thoughts or emotions, the technique known as RAIN will become invaluable. Look at Tara Brach's books ""Radical Acceptance"" and ""True Refuge"", or Google around for lectures and basics of those techniques."
Mindfulness,2x22ka,paulexander,2,Wed Feb 25 20:37:19 2015 UTC,Thank you for the great reply.  I have read some of Tara Brach's stuff and listen to her guided meditations.  The thing I struggle with the most I guess is when I'm not meditating and am out in the world I find myself ruminating about things in the past or future that cause me anxiety.  Sometimes when I catch myself I'll realize that I've been ruminating for a while!  I guess the only way is to keep at it and trust that my mindfulness practice will improve.  I want to experience what you've described in your first post so nicely!  Anyway thanks again.
Mindfulness,2x22ka,rainman18,2,Wed Feb 25 20:48:11 2015 UTC,"I like to shift how newcomers view their mindfulness practice. For sure you can figure out some nuts and bolts for your practice, but they will be pretty simple, such as ""watch your breath in and out for 10 minutes. Note any thoughts that come and then let them go as gently as possible."" Simple, right?  But more importantly, mindfulness is simply about taking time.. Time to just be.   I think of the mind as having two basic aspects. The first is the awareness aspect; it is what is active whenever you are experiencing through the senses. The second is the thought aspect; it is what creates a dialogue and all the thoughts in your head. The latter can be distracting from the former, so mindfulness is all about getting in touch with the awareness aspect of your mind, which actually helps you gain better control, insight, and compassion in both aspects of your mind. I hope this helps :)"
Mindfulness,2x22ka,GoodOlDayss,5,Wed Feb 25 19:12:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the rough timeline,I know it won't be the same for everyone, I just wanted some gauge of what to expect when it is working so that if a large period of time passed without experiencing any relief then I could maybe attribute that to the particular program I was using or to some error in the way I was doing it. Cheers for the advice!"
Mindfulness,2x22ka,GoodOlDayss,2,Wed Feb 25 15:05:22 2015 UTC,"I would say that with mindfulness, you have to develop a love for having the practice be a part of your life. It might hinder your practice to think of it in terms of the results you achieve because while it will definitely benefit you and your life, it is not a magic pill. You will still be human and have problems, etc. It is helpful to approach the practice with a sense of compassion for yourself and for the people in your life. This softness is the best way to do meditation / mindfulness."
Mindfulness,2x22ka,jjandrewes,1 point,Wed Feb 25 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"If I'm honest, I started to feel the effects within the first 20 days. I was sceptical about it at first. Well, not sceptical, but I was just getting on with it not expecting what happened to happen. I was put onto it from a new psychologist I had been seeing after having had analytical psychotherapy for a number of years for anxiety. I was even very stop-y and start-y at the beginning, but really within about 15-20 sittings I just felt an overall sense of calm that I hadn't felt really for quite some time. Within living memory maybe? It actually took me quite a long time to realise that it was the meditation that was causing this, because before you really do the exercises and integrate them into your daily life its quite hard to understand exactly what it is. I don't think it will ever be a case of totally 'recovering' from anxiety. One of the things that mindfulness has taught me is flexibility of mind, to welcome unpleasant thoughts and feelings and make space for them rather than fighting with them. To treat them as normal, which they are.  So don't expect to just feel no anxiety as a result. Instead, you'll learn to take some distance for it. To see if for what it is and to not be so threatened by what you think it is capable of. This has been cumulative for me...I've been at it now for about 2/3 months...and it's getting easier and clearer over time. But the more I learn the more I realise there is to learn. Its all positive though. Good luck!"
Mindfulness,2x22ka,jjandrewes,2,Fri Mar 6 20:41:05 2015 UTC,I use the headspace app btw which has been a really really great and easy way to get into it.
Mindfulness,2x22ka,beardbread,2,Fri Mar 6 20:43:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! Yeah i've accepted i'll never be completely free from anxiety,it's a natural part of life. I just want to reach a stage where it's not a disorder any more. It can be like i'm stuck in neurotic quicksand at times, i'm naturally predisposed to tackle my problems by obsessively thinking about them from all angles,but this approach doesn't do any good in this situation and just makes things worse. I've started headspace so if I can establish the routine hopefully i'll start to see some positive effects soon!"
Mindfulness,2x22ka,SpiritualHerbivore,1 point,Sat Mar 7 01:14:59 2015 UTC,"Good luck to you.   I, too, have the overwhelming anxiety at times that seems to grow less-than-critical situations into panic attacks and feelings of desperation and doom. Part of this stems from ADD, which I've begun taking meds for (almost a year ago). It helps, but there's more work to do.  I was on the fence about Headspace, but the more I read here on /r/mindfulness and /r/meditation the more I see it really helping those starting out, and I think I will make the purchase.   I think meditation can really help me, and others like me. Hopefully. âº  Thank you, and again, good luck."

Mindfulness,2x3kdi,mrCasual,1 point,Thu Feb 26 05:24:11 2015 UTC,"I was an over the road truck driver. Many days I would drive 10 hours in a shift. You can imagine how easily the mind drifts driving several hours on some of the flatter or rural stretches.  Several times a shift I would take 10 or 15 minutes where I concentrated solely on driving, being very careful to keep my mind strictly on the mechanics of driving. No radio, eating, coffee  or anything else that would distract me.  This excersice helped me quite a bit to be more attentive when I wasn't ""excersicing""."

What I do find useful, and is pretty similar to what you describe is visualising inhaling white/clear air. Then when you exhale the air is grey, as you exhale your thoughts and negativity/pain etc."
Mindfulness,2wvg05,LandOfGreenGinger,1 point,Mon Feb 23 15:33:09 2015 UTC,"I am not familiar with that image, but here's something you can try:  Go into either Google images or Bing Images search  Put in various search terms to see if you can track the image down. I tried doing it for you, and then realized I have no idea what image you're looking for.  Best of luck to you."

Mindfulness,2whtg5,MrDeepAKAballs,2,Fri Feb 20 03:09:46 2015 UTC,"Very interesting article. I liked the example of how to improve your intuition where the writer said they would guess the temperature before looking at the thermometer. One good one that I realize that I do is when I'm on the treadmill at the gym, I try to guess what my heart rate is before I use the heart rate checker."

Mindfulness,2w4z87,MattRValentine,2,Tue Feb 17 00:35:06 2015 UTC,Curious about the idea of a soft focus. I've read about being so full focused on your breath that you notice its very specific nuances. That seems like a hard focus now in retrospect. Can anyone elaborate?
Mindfulness,2w4z87,UnderwaterDialect,2,Tue Feb 17 07:14:49 2015 UTC,"For me, it depends on the day. Some days I am able to maintain a soft focus and it is as if I'm not thinking at all. I do have a target of my mindfulness, but it's more of an emotional connection to it than a mental connection. Other times, I'm easily distracted and find it useful to concentrate more overtly on the object of my meditation."
Mindfulness,2w4z87,GoatBased,1 point,Tue Feb 17 08:53:18 2015 UTC,Thanks! Would you call that second kind of concentration a 'hard focus'?
Mindfulness,2w4z87,UnderwaterDialect,1 point,Tue Feb 17 18:45:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think it's definitely more of a hard focus. I certainly don't claim to be doing anything correctly, but this helps me."
Mindfulness,2w4z87,GoatBased,1 point,Tue Feb 17 19:07:39 2015 UTC,What they say about making your mind completely thoughtless being impossible and useless... that is not true.

Mindfulness,2w4z87,GoatBased,1 point,Tue Feb 17 19:09:51 2015 UTC,"Feel like that's my method with photography, but I take a step further.  Lets say I photo shoot a wedding and take 1400 photos.  That's about my goal.  Do the standard shots and get creative as you go with others.  Thing is I wouldn't give my customer all 1400 non edited photos in RAW.  I'd first deselect photos that are too blury or just don't impress me.  Then start editing the what I've got maybe I have two shots and one comes out better with a change of contrast or saturation etc.  In the end if the photo doesn't impress me or evoke some kind of feeling it gets tossed.  It does take time to trim the fat and so on but the overall quality of the package is lifted tremendously.  I accept that some people might get something from it, but we shouldn't be afraid to criticize things or take criticism our self's."
Mindfulness,2w4z87,Freezerburn,1 point,Tue Feb 17 20:04:24 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem worthwhile to ""trim the fat"" here, because every single one of these tips can help someone. He's not looking to optimize for the usefulness of each tip, he's looking to optimize for the number of people helped."
