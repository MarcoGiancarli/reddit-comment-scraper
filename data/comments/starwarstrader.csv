Well you get to do it again!  I don't care how many new users have been added in the last few weeks... I think these golds are going to be much lower count than Series 1.

I will absolutely NOT be chasing golds because I value my sanity, free time, family, etc. Godspeed to those who WILL be chasing.  What would make me reconsider? A final checklist of cards NOW. Or at least a number. Otherwise it's just me in a sadsack abusive relationship with Topps again. If you think that's extreme, you didn't do the chase last time :-/ .....   This is a sweet set - it'll be very difficult for me to let go of the golds that I have from the first run, but the the last half of the set was handled very poorly. I really don't mind sporadic releases but not when the ""release"" requires subsequent hours and hours of work. The hoarding was fun until it wasn't."

starwarstrader,3e4itr,Tedsallis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:28:45 2015 UTC,Wretched Surveys that have you going round and round in circles before telling you that you're not eligible.  uuurgggg

Burn out from all that mess makes it a whole lot easier to save."
starwarstrader,3e4itr,hoppyschlitz,2,Tue Jul 21 23:45:39 2015 UTC,"I actually have been saving over 900k credits in total for the last week after the Star Destroyer Pack dropped. It allowed me to have so much trade bait that I didn't need to pull a single card from packs. Unfortunately, I spent more than half on the surprising 1:45 odds bounty, 1977, comic, storyboard and now TK.   Also, I feel so bad for those Kick users, I downloaded the app and the measly daily and weekly credits is shocking. I don't want to know what would happen if that were to happen on SWCT."

starwarstrader,3e4itr,wander099,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:56:24 2015 UTC,I'm been trading like mad today to try and pick up new cards than pulling too many packs. It just takes time and patience and it makes sense to try and use existing dupes than frittering away more money.
starwarstrader,3e5p8s,davebgray,2,Wed Jul 22 03:53:06 2015 UTC,"Blind trading is bad.  Really bad.  It doesn't seem to prioritize when people have duplicates.  Perhaps instituting a ""want"" indication to better pair strangers. ""Browsing"" profiles is difficult.  I'd like to look at people's entire card list from the trade screen before I send an offer.  No use in sending a trade for a card that's obviously part of a completed set for another card in a set that they aren't chasing. Better communication, in general.  The fan feed is filled with copy/paste spam and it's difficult to just send someone a message.  You have to hope that they go back and look at a trade.  Better notifications for messages, counters, and declines would be nice, too. a Landscape mode Better sorting.  Perhaps the ability to move cards to a vault and off of your main list.  It gets tiring scrolling through the same force awakens and battlefront cards on everyone's list.  In addition, a filter would help.  If I'm trading in base variants, there's no need to display all of the trader's white cards."
starwarstrader,3e5p8s,lightmanx5,2,Wed Jul 22 03:56:58 2015 UTC,You can search when initiating a trade and looking through your own cards.

Not difficult to trade for in terms of value, the only trouble is that a lot of people that want to break their sets, so finding someone who wants to part with them can be a little tricky - I would advise looking for people with dupes or who have partial sets."

I remember my first of many Kenner Action Figure(s) (big shock, it was LUKE), the Brothers' Hildebrandt SW poster my parents got for my bedroom wall, and numerous Topps Star Wars cards from both ANH and Empire...;)  So yeah...pretty devoted fan.

starwarstrader,3e3o0h,mjsottawa,2,Tue Jul 21 20:18:40 2015 UTC,The funny thing is that they have not completely run out of more prominent Bounty Hunters. We still haven't seen Aurra Sing or Jango Fett in this series.

I caved and gave the one CGI Clone Wars movie on Netflix a shot and enjoyed it enough. Is the series worth diving into if I have a passing interest and want something to make noise in the background while I play WoW or something else?  I am glad however they pulled Bounty away from the ""Denizens of the Cantina"" realm they were going for there for a while."
starwarstrader,3e3o0h,blurryleg,2,Tue Jul 21 18:38:43 2015 UTC,"I also didn't watch any of it till it was on Netflix either. If you were able to enjoy the movie, you'll like The Clone Wars series. Even some of the most hardcore fans of the show see the movie as a low point, and a horrible start. The show takes a little while to find its stride, but I enjoyed it the whole time and it gets really good starting with season 4.  Rebels is already off to a stronger start, IMO."
starwarstrader,3e3o0h,blurryleg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I gave Rebels a curious glance, but the streaming site for it required cable info and I cba to find it via other methods just yet.

starwarstrader,3e3o0h,blurryleg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the 2D Clone Wars was great. Overall with the CGI show, at the end of the day it's still Star Wars and too much Star Wars to ignore. It was wondeful to spend so many more hours with Anakin and Obi-Wan, to watch Ahsoka grow up, to understand that the clones are individuals, and so much more. The show went a long way in helping me make peace with the prequels, along with the Machete Order and the Ring Theory."

I'd known about Machete Order, but after a few years of having not seen the Original Trilogy and a girlfriend that's never seen them outside of one of the prequels I wonder how it'll compare."
starwarstrader,3e3o0h,blurryleg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:14:38 2015 UTC,The Despecialized Editions are a real treat. They exude such a labor of love. And the Machete Order is perfection. After one of my best friends got married we found out his wife had never really seen any Star Wars so I had them watch it with me this way. The reaction to Luke and Leia being born was perfect! I also recently showed my mom the series this way since she confessed to not being super familiar with the series and it further affirmed my belief in the Machete Order.
starwarstrader,3e3o0h,Alamoth,2,Tue Jul 21 23:28:07 2015 UTC,"started the series a few weeks ago, I am not a prequel lover, so I was hesitant. The first season is okay, but then from season 2 it gets so good! I'm now ending season 4, and its very cool!"

starwarstrader,3e3o0h,blurryleg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:00 2015 UTC,I enjoyed the Clone Wars movie and I'm in the middle of watching season three of the series.   I had to google this Jakoli character though and it looks like they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel. He only appeared in two episodes of the series. I know there's only so many bounty hunters but it might be tough for them to make it to 30 plus 4 awards.
starwarstrader,3e3o0h,VINT0N,3,Tue Jul 21 18:44:46 2015 UTC,I thought they would start doing more characters that have bounties on them in the universe. See: Han Solo award card.

starwarstrader,3e3o0h,Jbot5k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:27 2015 UTC,I would lose it if we got some Shadows of the Empire characters at some point! Shame that none of that stuff is considered canon anymore; I wouldn't get my hopes up too much for it.
starwarstrader,3e3o0h,VINT0N,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:45:46 2015 UTC,Well I only say that because they exist in the Galactic Files Topps sets and Xizor mostly as art in the stand alone set they did in the late 90s. But I'm cautiously optimistic

starwarstrader,3e3o0h,Wedge2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks, but I easily flipped it for TC Rex plus some great trade sweeteners. Man, that was a rush. 15 trades pending in a flash.

I really don't chase marathons but have all the Wave 2 bounties (except Viazgo) so i'd like to finish off.  Do people trade these for other daily releases like TKs and newest Comics, or should I try for an lower odds Marathon to swap 1:1?"
starwarstrader,3e3o0h,Grechus,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:44 2015 UTC,"With 3,500 printings at 1:45 odds you should wait until Thursday when you can double-dip with this and Vintage.  To be honest, all Marathons have inflated value on the day they come out. People will trade this for other releases eventually, but probably not today.   Personally I'm waiting for Thursday."

starwarstrader,3e2m3t,LeviTriumphant,3,Tue Jul 21 22:03:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, but not enough to trade that  card away, and on Android the sorting just got so much better that I can overlook a few strays."

Tried to ditch them to whoever needed them or just get that amazing Evil Vader card, but ended up with 2-3 more somehow after that, moved a green comic I couldn't even give away for 4 more blues, and some red and blue dupe comics I had that weren't going anywhere for the rest of the blues and finished it up after an evening or so. I did the same with Intergalactics, had 2 random oranges I picked up, opened like 3 of the final packs, and pulled like 9 inserts off of them of various colors. Traded dupes around for a full 3 'f2p' White/Green/Orange set. Would have loved the reds more but oh well!  Not great sets, and I never opened a single pack for mangas and under 5 or so for IG but got a full sets. Sometimes the trading aspect is more fun that opening 20 packs with no inserts.  ETA! I forgot, someone here mentioned in a thread they had 3 random shadowboxes for free, they didn't want them. A pink, grey and a red I think? Managed to flip those all around over the course of an entire evening (as well as dupe yellows!) for a full blue set...joy..."

Maybe I am offered most of a set in a trade in an offer I cant refuse, or maybe I am trying to pull a particular variant and get too many of the other one.

I also didn't appreciate rushing out another teal set just 30 minutes after GM debacle.  It felt like a cheap trick you would pull to distract and appease an unhappy child.  EDIT: For the more sensitive community members, my use of the word ""abused"" above was intended to be funny.  I have never felt abused in anyway by anything related to a digital card collecting app."

starwarstrader,3e3493,gellman,3,Tue Jul 21 16:43:45 2015 UTC,"As someone who works professionally with a lot of licensed properties including star wars, these approvals are never instant. Someone takes a vacation or sick day, or just can't schedule a meeting, and your project becomes 2 weeks late. It just happens. They have hundreds of licenses all over the world. Give em a break."
starwarstrader,3e3493,Grawlix_13,0,Tue Jul 21 17:42:57 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I was thinking. Licensed properties that function on source material of this nature has to be a freaking mess. Especially when you are redesigning goods that will be resold. Im sure there are negotiations with the people who do the source materials as well.
starwarstrader,3e3493,gellman,2,Tue Jul 21 17:50:15 2015 UTC,Sure.  But ideally you would have a couple in the can ready to go on any given Monday.  It just seems like 3 variants in a 5 week span is excessive and there would have been a better contingency plan in place after the first or second.  I obviously don't understand the inner workings of how the business is managed maybe so this is just easier said than done.

So I don't blame him.  But at a point, like most of yesterday's events, you're just doing this to yourself. He'd benefit from having an intern doing social media, and keeping his private and locked down away from fans."

starwarstrader,3e3493,blurryleg,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:43 2015 UTC,"He's the producer EIC, so yeah, PR falls into that when you're a 2 man crew and intern, but he isn't beholden to anyone to do anything like that. The app suffers for it (and the community) but that's his choice as the producer.  But yes, his twitter became a de-facto PR feed, when it really shouldn't have. WoW had similar issues with their devs speaking out of turn on twitter or slightly 'snapping' at fans when the 10000th mention pops up about the same known issue."
starwarstrader,3e3493,wander099,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:55 2015 UTC,"Well, there is a difference between criticism and unjustified hate/nastiness.  Of course no one should be expected to have to take the latter, but if someone cannot take the former, that's pretty bad.  I mean, criticism in my experience can be really helpful when it comes to self-improvement.  And as long as it is about important things, people should be glad for some constructive criticism.  I mean, I resent it when my mother gets on me about my housekeeping skills because as long as everything functions and I can sustain myself I regard such things as unimportant and sufficient, so why should I care?  But, if it is about something important, like my academic skills and I can improve there, well of course I want to know about what I've done wrong and how I can fix it!  Why would I not?"

starwarstrader,3e3493,blurryleg,4,Tue Jul 21 16:37:12 2015 UTC,"No problem, thanks!  I recognize that the app has plenty of issues, but I get the impression that not fixing them is not something that is done out of someone being lazy or bad at their job, but being understaffed and there literally not being enough hours in the day to fix them. It's not like they're not aware that people would like better sorting or binders or larger trades or more locks, etc.  Steve gets blamed for a lot of stuff by the community that is probably out of his control and is the result of higher-up decisions. I'm part of a 2 person design/print department myself, and I know sometimes deadlines have to get changed and that I make typos and mistakes sometimes when really rushed. It's called being human.   EDIT: I wanted to add - I see a lot of mistakes (and I know there are a lot) and all I get is the impression that everything is extremely rushed and that these are first draft sort of mistakes that are pushed out the door because of time. EVERYONE makes design mistakes on the first drafts sometimes, even often.  People can argue that ""he's the PR"" person, and that may be true, but that doesn't mean throwing vitriolic hate at him is appropriate."

starwarstrader,3e3493,Tedsallis,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"Whenever I am on the phone or face-to-face with a customer services representative after something has gone wrong I always make sure I do three things:   Speak to them politely, even though I may be very angry and frustrated, because abuse gets you nowhere. If I have to I'll tell them that I'm very upset and angry but don't intend to take it out on them, and I've never known anybody I've said that to who hasn't appreciated it. Communicate that my problem is with the company and/or a product rather than them but I'm happy to talk to whoever it takes to fix the problem to my satisfaction, which might be them or which might be a supervisor. Have a clear idea of the resolution I want but show some flexibility, so if I'm offered most of what I want or a fair compromise then I'll accept that.   Too many people treat customer service representatives as punching bags. They're not. They're human beings, too. Yes, they may be paid to listen to and try to fix your problems but that doesn't make it right for you to take your shit out on them. And, like I said, you're more likely to get what you want by asking for it politely as you are by screaming and shouting and hurling abuse."
starwarstrader,3e3493,GenrePeople,3,Tue Jul 21 22:35:34 2015 UTC,"So what happens when:   You call with every intention of being polite, and nobody picks up? You call again the next day and they still ignore you. You finally get someone on the line, and you say ""Hi, I've got a problem and I'm hoping you might be able to help me out."" and they say ""Hmm... Maybe."" and hang up the phone. You get the manager on the line, and you say ""with all due respect, I'm simply trying to resolve a problem, and I seem to be having trouble speaking with your representatives."" and the manager says ""They're all on vacation. People get days off, you know."" They finally agree to solve your problem. ""Sure, we'll send a tech out to fix that really soon."" ""When, specifically?"" you ask. ""I dunno. Soon."""

I even thought of a Reflection surrogate service where you buy me credits and I pull as many Reflection packs as I can with that and the card is yours! If I hit in under the budget the credits are mine, and you get the card. If you miss, you can try again or I move on to the next person. I am far too lazy for this, and since the packs go away after you pull one it'd be hard to keep business flowing.

starwarstrader,3e3n69,Pfsar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:20:22 2015 UTC,"I said before it would be 500-750. I made that prediction shortly after the 2,200-odd card, and on the day when we had no 1977 transmission and it looked like the 2,200-odd might repeat itself.   I'm still in that range, prediction-wise but a little more optimistic now. 750 is the number I'm predicting. I'll be very surprised if it exceeds 1,000."
starwarstrader,3e3n69,Pfsar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:08:09 2015 UTC,"This looks like as good a place to discuss the way this set has been done as anywhere else.  I appreciate that with 66 cards in the 1977 set a daily card was the way probably the way to go but the pack odds at 1 in 77 are ridiculous for the 1,000 credit cost.  It would have been much better to make the pack odds 1 in 38 (because it's been 38 years since the first film came out) or make the odds 1 in 77 but the pack price 500 credits with only three cards in the pack.  I've done the maths (math, if you're American) and the odds of not pulling a 1977 card after 300 packs is still 2%. That's way too high for a series that has 66 cards because it means that somewhere along the way you're likely to have a 300+ pack day.  When that happens it can cripple your credit reserve and knock you out of the hunt. And when that happens with this pack - which is a real slog - it can really turn people off the app altogether...  The time taken to open 300 packs is depressing enough. But 300 without anything to show for it apart from base cards, well, there are few things more demoralising than that in SWCT.  Lastly, to my fellow 77ers, I say this: hang in there! And help each other out when you can. If you see a 77er in need and you have a duplicate then help them if you can. One day it might be you that needs the help..."

Such a credit drain and can't get much involved in any other set. Just grab my 77 for day and look at all the sets that are out that I can't chase. Actually trying for storyboard too but Iv gotten lucky with pulls on those. I think a little over 1 thousand people will finish this though. Maybe even upper thousand numbers.

Now, what I would love to see for Series 2, make it a marathon of sorts. 6 cards available for 7 days (capped at 3500?) with one of the 11 stickers as a weekly award and then a secondary award for the complete 66 card set and maybe 11 sticker set."

None of the checklist names make sense or have any naming convention, just look at the checklist view for all the FCs you have so many random ways to name and identify a card instead of the one that is clean and simple ""FANS CHOICE - SLEAZEBAGGANO - WEEK 30 - AWARD"".

Whether it is this weird alphabetization or the thought that Topps Steve thinks 10,000 credits would be a ""proper award"" for collecting all 11 Gold Badges, or something like the Series 2 base cards in Bunt being released this weekend without their images, it is definitely a new screw up every single day and I get the sense that both the app technology and the admin processes are held together with duct tape.

starwarstrader,3e2l4d,tinyasterisms,5,Tue Jul 21 14:29:21 2015 UTC,"Seems like OP is asking more about credit budgets than real money budgets but maybe I'm wrong.  From a credit budget perspective, my budget when pulling any given card is usually relative to both the card and my available credits.  I typically set a minimum remaining credits I want to have when I'm done pulling.  This budget is also based on how hard I think the card will be to trade for if I don't pull it.  I'm paranoid about always having some reserve credits so I'll typically say: ""ok, I'll try to pull this card and I'm willing to go down to 50,000 remaining credits.""  If I get the card before I hit 50,000 remaining, great!  If not, I wait for the card to sell out and then start thinking about what I would trade for it.  The exception is 1977 remastered.  I usually just pull until I get one of those stupid things because they are so impossible to trade for.  I can't wait until that set set is done.  Still bitter that Topps turned what should have been one of the best sets into something that makes me hate the app on a daily basis. :("
starwarstrader,3e2l4d,MALAGANT_on_SWCT,3,Tue Jul 21 14:26:27 2015 UTC,"I do the same.  ""I'll spend until I pull, or until I have 50,000 remaining"".  Once I get to 50,000 I stop.  For about 2 minutes, then I blow the remaining 50,000 with a vengeance trying to catch a card that is trying so desperately to stay out of my collection.  Then I hit up tapjoy, then I blow all of those credits. Then I make an outlandish overpay offer for the damn card, end up doubling it, get the card and feel a bitter, hollow sense of satisfaction."

I do use a phone and an Ipad, however I have learned that collecting dupe cards that have easier odds and trade well makes the most financial sense. For Instance I try to collect as many GM Marathons, black badges, and classic arts as possible. These odds are between 1:20 and 1:25. I have be able to trade these away for a majority of Marathons and harder to pull cards.

I am currently at a standstill, because I'm not sure if I want to save my credits for CA this weekend and just trade for the two other cards I'm chasing (Classic Comics and FC). The probably is that saving credits means you still have the potential to get zero in return, while pulling packs, even if you get an insert you don't want, means you have trade collateral."

starwarstrader,3e2l4d,LAKingsDave,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:10 2015 UTC,"In terms of cash?  I spend zero.  It is easy because I cannot afford it right now, so I cannot even consider it.  In terms of credits, I have the sets I chase and I have to consider what would be wisest to pull and when.  For example, I chase classic art, now, if I want to pull it, I need to pull on Friday when I have the best shot of actually catching it.  But if I want to trade for it, I should do it Saturday or Sunday after the drops when the market is more saturated.  In terms of Bounty (my marathon chase), I should wait until Thursday if I can to get the double dip with vintage.  Long odds on the vintage, but I have a shot along with what I need.  Back when I was chasing the paintings, I pulled every other day to double dip greys as I had no interest in oranges.  And so on.  So I do not so much stick to a strict budget as determine what days I need to pull on and make sure I have credits for them."

So those that never update will always still have this feature. Topps doesn't exactly add amazing features with every update that would convince people to update sadly.

starwarstrader,3e3457,Griddlemarks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:21:23 2015 UTC,Right. I'm not chasing 77s but if I had to choose between Comics and Storyboards I'd go with Storyboards since the odds are better.

starwarstrader,3e3i6p,Strev123,2,Tue Jul 21 17:55:23 2015 UTC,Gonna be hard finding someone willing to trade a bounty set for all those. Your better off selling it on ebay and buying the cards your looking for. Although it might be too late to sell the the gold bounty...
starwarstrader,3e3i6p,KaidyPerry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:47 2015 UTC,"I collect bountys and pulled a gold baba fett last night and traded it 1:1 for the Jango reflection. I had other offers but the only thing close was a droids vintage and some random TKs. So, don't think you are going to get what you are looking for in regards to the gold badge primarily because it is old. The reflections may pull in some vintage but not likely a low count / high value vintage."

starwarstrader,3e47e2,WhiteShadow92,4,Tue Jul 21 20:47:13 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the apology and that it wasn't right at the deadline and I'm not particularly worried about the vaults at all, but TBH, if it were me, I would have gotten dupes of the golds that were locked in vaults before asking for my golds back, knowing I would have good trade fodder down the line anyhow with the extra purples and browns."
starwarstrader,3e47e2,tinyasterisms,0,Tue Jul 21 22:53:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I ended up with no leftovers, but would have been more than happy to look for the other cards and I totally agree that my approach could have been different and that is definitely on me."

starwarstrader,3e47e2,LeviTriumphant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"My purple is at risk despite the fact I signed up within minutes of the very first vault, so apologize all you want but I am not feeling very forgiving at the moment.   I hope future vault keepers keep in mind your behavior here, which is appallingly selfish."
starwarstrader,3e47e2,tinyasterisms,4,Tue Jul 21 21:51:36 2015 UTC,"There really is no risk since it was one or two cards per vault. There are plenty of people with extras as you can tell since more and more vaults are opening up.  I'm not asking for your specific forgiveness, far from it, because I could have not even bothered to post anything and you would not have even known. It's not like it was binding contract and I did give it a thought before deciding to ask for my cards back. Feel free to feel however you want, but my post was mainly directed to those who were actually doing the work of hosting the vaults."

The vintage Han I sold for $165.00 was invoiced as $16.50 final value fee. I wasn't charged a listing fee. I know PayPal takes a bit as well, but I didn't think it was 10%, I thought it was more along the lines of 2.5% but I'd have to check to be sure."

starwarstrader,3e1fq9,Grawlix_13,4,Tue Jul 21 05:38:35 2015 UTC,"I'll give it at least half hour but if you've made a fan feed post and I've sent an offer within a couple of minutes then at least let me know what's going on. If you're entertaining other offers then let me know, I don't mind but I hate those people who make a post then seemingly disappear off the face of the earth.  When posting on the fan feed I will generally make a decision on offers quite quickly usually within 5 minutes, the few times I've had something really hot and I've been weighing up offers then I've messaged the person saying this and I'll get back to them asap. Blind trades on the other hand sit there till I'm online as I don't get notifications about pending trades and they're mostly new players/alt accounts offering me base cards for badges as badges are top of the insert section."
starwarstrader,3e1fq9,uluckypeople,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with this 100%. If you're posting trade offers on the feed and I'm sending an offer with a message (which I usually do), at least take a moment to reply that you're considering my offer, other offers, want more from me, or don't want what I'm offering. Heck, even something as simple as 'can you give me a few minutes I'm looking over some offers' is much better than a trade sitting and rotting while the demand for a new card is still hot."
starwarstrader,3e1fq9,thegregwitul,2,Tue Jul 21 16:21:22 2015 UTC,I tend to give it 10-15 minutes tops before cancelling and moving on. I often have a limited time and am offering a card I have two of on multiple trades and if I leave them hanging and more than two accept now I have a hole that will have to be filled. Not good. So better to just cancel them all when I can't watch for accepts.
starwarstrader,3e1fq9,Tedsallis,2,Tue Jul 21 12:11:53 2015 UTC,This is the major problem with the android app. My trades genuinely take 7-10 minutes to load so I'll wait for it to load when I get a decent amount of trades.
starwarstrader,3e1fq9,jordanhhh4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:32:07 2015 UTC,It seems that reinstalling the app solves this problem for a couple of hours
starwarstrader,3e1fq9,HowDidItGetBurned,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:42 2015 UTC,My favorite is when I see the trade sitting for 10-15 minutes while they are busily continuing to spam the fan feed. Are they trying to make trades or are they just into getting trade offers?
starwarstrader,3e1fq9,Tedsallis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when trading dupes I tend to cancel trades if I have another good offer or a chance at a good offer, because I don't trust the void system to work properly and leave me with none of that card instead of 1.  That said, if I don't have other offers, or only have one of that card, I'll leave it as long as need be."

starwarstrader,3e1fq9,sjmleicester,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:08:02 2015 UTC,Don't forget trades are automatically cancelled once the 'one' card being traded is accepted as you can only trade the one card once
starwarstrader,3e1fq9,wander099,3,Tue Jul 21 11:32:08 2015 UTC,"No, that's a voided trade, it doesn't show up as cancelled."
starwarstrader,3e1fq9,tinyasterisms,2,Tue Jul 21 13:12:23 2015 UTC,"Don't this typically show up as ""Void"" though and not ""Cancelled""?"
starwarstrader,3e1fq9,wander099,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:58 2015 UTC,"I had a jerk who waited less than 5 minutes once - I check my trades often.  When I saw the cancelled trade it had an abusive note accusing me of not wanting to do the deal I asked for (which incidentally was not what he was offering anyway...apparently he had serious reading comprehension issues...but no matter, I never even saw it).  Myself, I will wait about 15 minutes usually, but sometimes longer depending on the deal."
starwarstrader,3e1fq9,thegregwitul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:16:27 2015 UTC,"I actually had this happen to me from a newbie who pulled green Vader last night. I sent a trade request with a note asking what he'd like for green Vader and he sent an offer back asking for purple Padme. As this offer came in, the green and orange Vader was pulled by my wife...again, this is about a minute after his offer is sent...and I'm about to go in and decline the offer and I see a message, so I check it out and it says 'Accept now or I cancel'.   Well, how about I just decline instead, buddy. Which is exactly what I did."
starwarstrader,3e1fq9,wander099,2,Tue Jul 21 16:25:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, except this was no newbie.  I don't have the trade in my history anymore because it was a long time ago and ios doesn't keep the history even back a week (why?) but I remember it was someone with a pretty high force score who was deliberately trying to take advantage of me early on, which was why they were rushing and pressuring me, trying to make me think I was obligated to honour an offer I never actually extended (I believe car salesmen use a similar approach - they give a discount to try and make you think you must buy a car you do not even want and they will use time pressures too, pretending that there is a time limit for some reason), which was in fact a very bad deal - I don't recall, but they were trying to snag a vintage for some mid/high count insert that was not going to hold value.  I didn't know much back then, but even I could see it was a poor deal.  I remember putting the jerk on the ignore list and moving on."
starwarstrader,3e1fq9,tier1dc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:57 2015 UTC,I wish people would understand that Android users need a few minutes for the trade window to load up sometimes. Because I've got to force close the app and then restart it when it just hangs during the loading process.
starwarstrader,3e2vbv,FleaDobbler,2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:08 2015 UTC,I would say try uninstalling and reinstalling. Maybe just a software glitch

starwarstrader,3e2vbv,imwear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:27 2015 UTC,Sounds like a suspension. You may want to reach out to Topps support and ask: https://swcardtrader.zendesk.com/hc/en-us   They seem to be cracking down on android users who have too long of a message when posting to fan feed lately.
starwarstrader,3e2vbv,daser2,2,Tue Jul 21 15:36:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I have sent them a message.  They said I am suspended for spam.  I would like to know specifically what I did that is different than all the other spam I see all the time, but I may not get an answer to that.  I have been promoting this game big time, talking about it on a weekly podcast I help host and getting at least 6 people into the game in the past 10 days.  Its not like Topps owes me anything, but it definitely makes we want to dial down my promotion of the game."
starwarstrader,3e2vbv,wander099,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:33 2015 UTC,"Yikes. This is ridiculous. You would think they would have the courtesy to issue a warning before suspending, especially for something like this. And if not, then at least notifying you that you have been suspended if that is the case, and how long the suspension is for."
starwarstrader,3e2vbv,imwear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:19:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think they ever bother to notify anyone of the reason for a suspension (unless you ask) or give warnings, which seems a rather unfair system.  If you don't know that you are doing something wrong then it is not possible to correct the behaviour after all..."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,Piratiko,17,Mon Jul 20 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"But don't worry, after the hundreds of thousands of credits you spent trying to get this set your be rewarded 10,000 back, the equivalent of two packs..... ðŸ˜‚"

starwarstrader,3e09ds,LittleGreenOldMan,3,Tue Jul 21 01:42:51 2015 UTC,Didn't one of the early transmissions say award card or am I wrong?
starwarstrader,3e09ds,daser2,4,Tue Jul 21 02:22:09 2015 UTC,"Someone quoted the exact wording as ""a proper award"".   So, they think 10,000 credits is proper."

starwarstrader,3e09ds,thrawne,15,Tue Jul 21 03:18:30 2015 UTC,I thought they still had Darth Maul remaining from the shot glass art? Why no award card if there is one more image to the set? WHY TOPPS!?

starwarstrader,3e09ds,jericon,4,Tue Jul 21 14:37:23 2015 UTC,Sucks they use the same message for each card of the series usually.  Seems they didn't modify it for this last one.
starwarstrader,3e09ds,LeviTriumphant,10,Tue Jul 21 02:49:29 2015 UTC,They could at least do a variant if they don't have usable art. Like a pink Bounty Badge or something.

starwarstrader,3e09ds,scarieb,3,Tue Jul 21 00:59:25 2015 UTC,"And if this was the case they would've had EVEN MORE TIME to make sure they got the card image right, instead of doing a really shitty job pasting the image on top of a pre-existing card."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,taksdk,6,Tue Jul 21 02:13:47 2015 UTC,"Very true! What is really upsetting is that in the transmissions for the other badges they say ""collecting a full set in the same parallel will earn you a proper award""."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,hairymuggle,7,Tue Jul 21 13:51:15 2015 UTC,Slap in the face for someone who has stayed up to 4am EVERYDAY to catch the last badge (and still missed it). I don't understand; even without maul you still had 11 shot glasses. So just release 10 cards and save one for the award! Did they think that a never before seen piece of art would just manifest itself?
starwarstrader,3e09ds,Strev123,8,Tue Jul 21 13:55:55 2015 UTC,Seriously poor... I've spent I don't know how much chasing these. The least I was expecting was an award card! Someone get topps Steve on the phone!!  Feel like seeing what I can get for the whole black set in trades.
starwarstrader,3e09ds,Gasgano7,3,Tue Jul 21 04:09:09 2015 UTC,I have full black and blue set. When i read no award I dumped blue set for reflections cards. Found someone wanting badges made that trade fast as I could.
starwarstrader,3e09ds,daser2,8,Tue Jul 21 01:12:56 2015 UTC,"I'm so excited about the 10,000 credits. I can finally get a Teal card! Woohoo!"
starwarstrader,3e09ds,KthuluQBall,7,Tue Jul 21 01:51:25 2015 UTC,"Y'know, I really try to stay positive, but for the first time since I started playing I am really disappointed theres no card award.

starwarstrader,3e09ds,R2J1,6,Tue Jul 21 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"Wow.  Topps had an extremely popular and good looking set.  It was a big hit.  Some how through their complete inability to plan, or gauge customer expectation, they have turned all that positive momentum in to a seething mass of bitterness.  I am flabbergasted.  I don't think they could have handled things worse if they had tried."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,rhettjwilson,6,Tue Jul 21 03:25:00 2015 UTC,"I submitted a support ticket and started communicating with them through a support ticket email.  Here's a transcript:   Me: Players are used to getting an award card for completing sets. The Badge set is fantastic and a Badge award would be fantastic. Please offer an award.  Topps: Hello there,  Thanks for writing in.  We apologize for the miscommunication. The transmission states ""Badges of War award for your award case, as well as 10,000 Credits!""  This means you will receive a badge to go in to your unlocked awards shelf, as well as 10,000 credits. There will be no award card for this specific chase.  We apologize for the confusion. We appreciate you taking the time to write in with your feedback.  If you have further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to write back in.  Best,  Sarah Star Wars: Card Trader Support  Me: The introduction post says ""Collecting a full set of the same parallel will earn you a proper reward, so keep that in mind!""  Why is this considered a proper award when an award card is the proper reward for every other set? Intergalactic had 5 cards to collect and we were given a reward card. Collecting 11 badges gets 10,000 credits and a worthless trophy. This is not a proper reward as promised. People spend money, real money, on this game and expect consistent and/or improved game play. Why is Topps going backward? Please help!  Topps: Hi there!  Thanks for writing back in!  We completely understand the frustration with not getting what was thought to be the award for this chase.  Unfortunately, as previously stated, we have mentioned your concerns to the developers. Additionally, the Transmission did state what the award was and there is no card award for this chase.  We are sorry for any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused.  If there is any change in the award, we will push a Transmission or Bulletin letting fans know.  Please be sure to write back in with any other questions or concerns you may have!  Best regards,  Sarah Star Wars: Card Trader Support  Me: I find it unacceptable to announce the reward on the 11th card of a set.  At no point in card 1-10 was the award specified but I have yet to see any award that does not involve an award card.  Nobody cares about their trophy case, we care about cards.  It's a card trading game.  I would like every credit spent on a Badge of War pack returned to me please.  I have spent real money on this game and there are many more people that have spent more.  The developers may develop the game but the business owners are accountable for the game.  Please do not ""pass the buck"" here.  When can I anticipate a refund of credits spent on any Badges of War pack?  Thank you!   After no response and the ticket always saying closed in the subject I sent the next message   Me: If my support request has not been re-opened, I would like it to remain open as my concern has not been resolved. Please let me know if you did not get my last message.  Topps:Hi Rhett!  Thanks for writing back in!  We have received both of your messages since our last response and are sorry for the delay in response.  Our developers are reviewing this award to determine the outcome. If changes are made to what the award is, they will release a Transmission or Bulletin letting fans know. We will also keep this ticket open so that when a decision is made, we will write back to you and let you know just as soon as we know what choice they made.  We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.  If you have any other questions or concerns in the meantime, please do not hesitate to write back in!  Best regards,  Sarah Star Wars: Card Trader Support   Personally, I think they're dangling a carrot here to keep a calm.  I still doubt an award card will be coming.  It's obviously the fault of the ""employees"" (aka the developers) and they have no control over their employees.  You know, because employers never have any control over their employees."

starwarstrader,3e09ds,Smithly123,11,Tue Jul 21 16:09:09 2015 UTC,"Given their track record of copy paste errors, I'm gonna go with copy paste error"
starwarstrader,3e09ds,Darko_DOOM,5,Mon Jul 20 23:47:52 2015 UTC,100% copy/paste error.
starwarstrader,3e09ds,SactoJoe,7,Mon Jul 20 23:56:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this blows. The award cards are my main and basically only incentive to go after sets, it's a nice reward for following through and chasing a whole set. Without the award card, what's the point of getting them all as they come out? 10,000 credits? That's insulting for a set that cost 1,100,000 credits on average to pull for the lowest tier.  The recent extensions and rapid releases of sets has already turned me off of non-marathon sets, but this isn't doing anything to bring me back. I'm not currently chasing any of these and it looks like I won't be starting any time soon."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,tier1dc,6,Mon Jul 20 23:56:54 2015 UTC,"No point chasing without an award, I could pick it all up later for less because there isn't some 800 count award that people want to keep. Very disappointed this set looks nice but turned into a nightmare slowly"
starwarstrader,3e09ds,Clobbertr0n,3,Tue Jul 21 01:50:41 2015 UTC,"Yup, no point at all in chasing this set as it was released. Coulda just waited and picked them all up cheap in a few weeks. Makes me hesitant to chase any future set without specific award card details in the first transmission."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,ComoK,4,Tue Jul 21 01:58:55 2015 UTC,"this. What's to stop them from doing this again? Why bother stressing out about a set if it won't be worth the effort, time and credits?   Is it just me or does it really not seem that hard to pull up photoshop and slap an award card together? If it's a variant it doesn't need any new clearance so is it just laziness or lack of respect to the user base? I really don't get it."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,ComoK,5,Tue Jul 21 03:18:15 2015 UTC,I'll bet you all can change this by blowing up Twitter (positively).
starwarstrader,3e09ds,Goldenarmz97,5,Tue Jul 21 13:55:57 2015 UTC,Way ahead of ya.  Can't do it alone though.
starwarstrader,3e09ds,ctsoxfan,4,Tue Jul 21 00:18:12 2015 UTC,Just imagine the rage next week after all the people in the app finally realize there is no award card coming lol...  I don't think anyone considers the icon an award...
starwarstrader,3e09ds,Todduncommon,3,Tue Jul 21 01:17:50 2015 UTC,They would need to make the current awards 'untradeable' award cards that show up in your collection for them to have any real value.  The icons as they are today are beyond useless

starwarstrader,3e09ds,dja16,6,Tue Jul 21 00:42:41 2015 UTC,"All the Topps apps have the same odd idea when it comes to giving award credits for completed sets. 10,000 credits? Seriously, like 2 whole Boba packs? Or 1 teal pack?  Lets put it in perspective - I just blew almost 200,000 credits trying for a badge, any badge, and got nothing. Most of the badges I have pulled took a good 50k-100k. Each.   So yeah, that 10,000 credits doesn't thrill me."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,tier1dc,5,Tue Jul 21 00:43:38 2015 UTC,"It's odd to see the differences among the Topps Digital apps, when it comes to F2P coins.    Basically, SWCT is set up to hand out free credits/coins daily at a fairly substantial level (25k per day,50k at 7 days), and the sports apps are much stingier on a daily basis (HUDDLE - 1k each day; BUNT - 5k each day, KICK - 2k each day). In this regard, SWCT is comparatively generous in that you can get 5 pulls of 5k credit packs each day for nothing -- no CrapJoy, no money. You can't get a pack of anything good on the sports apps for less than 2.5k coins.  However, the sports apps (especially KICK) is set up to be much more generous with the award coin/credit amounts. Little, single insert card awards are still 3.5k coins, and more difficult insert sets to complete can be upwards of 100k coins.  I don't understand why the SWCT awards are so peculiarly stingy (1k each for the faction / parallel awards, for example).  For the relative difficulty of putting together the Shot Badge set, 10k credits are a confounding pittance."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,Mikeinator,4,Tue Jul 21 02:02:38 2015 UTC,"At lunch time today I was thinking ""this game is kind of dumb, maybe I'll sell my cards and quit"". Then I realized I still needed to finish badges and wave 2 widevision. No reason to hang around for a 10k award, so t-5 days and I'm out. Oh wait, awards never come out on time....damn you topps when can I quit? When?!?!"
starwarstrader,3e09ds,ThoseBackPages,4,Tue Jul 21 03:31:14 2015 UTC,"about a week and a half ago I traded the 7 silver I had because I couldn't trade for the other 3 for Swing, 3po, and Falcon vintage. Soooo glad did."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,mjsottawa,2,Tue Jul 21 02:36:26 2015 UTC,"That's really, really good.  Early Monday I traded my dupe Silver Yoda and Silver Leia for 4 TC Wave 2 I needed in separate trades and was very relieved I actually got something for them after this news came out. No way I would have been able to get anything for them now."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,Hanshotfirst253,4,Tue Jul 21 02:40:01 2015 UTC,"I tweeted the Maul shotglass image to Steve. He knows it's out there. The fact there's not an award is a load of crap.  I say keep tweeting this at him and @ToppsDigital and see if we can get a change. Either an award card, or more substantial amount of coins.

starwarstrader,3e09ds,guard5,3,Tue Jul 21 05:36:37 2015 UTC,"Anyone else notice something off with the pull counts? The gold is already at 91 pulled? It usually takes a day or more to sell out, but this rate will be the first gone. Seriously?"
starwarstrader,3e09ds,jayk1998,3,Tue Jul 21 06:27:54 2015 UTC,"Nah, the numbers support it if the paying players just saved credits to pull the last badge to trade into the rest. There are also mostly FtP players that use a similar tactic and toss a dollar at the last drop to try and trade the keystone last drop in the set to the whales. The numbers of black, blue and silver indicate that about 50k packs have sold total as of when I'm looking. Only 15k of those need to be master packs to sell out the gold."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,Darko_DOOM,3,Tue Jul 21 01:30:54 2015 UTC,This is EXTREMELY infuriating. All I looked forward to were the award cards for completing these Badges of War sets. Topps have outdone themselves with this new level of BS. They need to make this right.
starwarstrader,3e09ds,thegregwitul,4,Tue Jul 21 01:54:48 2015 UTC,Im confused in the transmission it says you will get 10k and an award. Edit: i see award case that blows
starwarstrader,3e09ds,Todduncommon,3,Tue Jul 21 01:32:34 2015 UTC,"No kidding. If ""put a different color border on it"" is okay for GM, why not a red variant badge as a reward? Do it Film Quotes style... Gold collectors get the whole thing. Silvers get you 8/11, blues get you 5/11, blacks get you 3/11.  Frustration..."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,Todduncommon,4,Tue Jul 21 01:47:26 2015 UTC,"Why can't they just give a variant or how about  the stupid fucking award logo you unlock for you ""cabinet"" (???) just take that, blow it up and put it on the corresponding background. Just SOMETHING I don't care how slack can topps be?"
starwarstrader,3e09ds,jericon,2,Tue Jul 21 05:18:56 2015 UTC,I dropped 200k and actually bought $4.99 to open up master packs and missed on every version of Boba Fett today. I just chuckled at the bad luck and didn't even catch that there would be no reward card. I had assumed it would have been Maul since the shot glass reveal.  I can't really complain as the wife landed me two green and one orange Vader spending only 26k packs just 10 minutes ago. She has the magic touch.
starwarstrader,3e09ds,jericon,2,Tue Jul 21 12:27:07 2015 UTC,How do I Shot Glass?
starwarstrader,3e09ds,creamsodabomb,2,Tue Jul 21 03:12:11 2015 UTC,"So glad I didn't bother to chase these.   Although, there's no award or award card announced for 1977 Remastered, so maybe I just borrowed trouble from a different set..."
starwarstrader,3e09ds,rhettjwilson,2,Tue Jul 21 03:31:42 2015 UTC,I wasn't chasing them till the destroyer pack when j got more than half of a blue set. Now I'm trying to dump them.
starwarstrader,3e09ds,ro_wgm,2,Tue Jul 21 03:45:53 2015 UTC,I got a bunch in my destroyer packs. Was actively trading for blue.   Now I'm trying to offload them to people that don't realize there is no award.

starwarstrader,3e238x,sjmleicester,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:35:01 2015 UTC,I installed the Tapjoy app on my advice and you can check the status of rewards. I fired off a load of support tickets and gave them a push on Facebook. It seemed to kick them into action. I got about 15 rewards approved within a couple of days and now just one of  the bigger Bingo ones to claim
starwarstrader,3e238x,smackin81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:00:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah; seems like they need a kick on a regular basis - say, every step of the way.  I got a response via Twitter, but it's just glacial in speed."
starwarstrader,3e238x,sjmleicester,2,Tue Jul 21 13:03:20 2015 UTC,"I did it and it worked out ok. Think is minimum spend $5 / Â£3.30 and you get 200,000+ currency. Think it the same group that do Euromillons / Giantlottos offer and you are only able to do one or the other. The only thing to watch is, is that you have to untick the box to make sure it is just one week you are betting on, rather than it debitting your card on a weekly basis.  NowTV was offering a free trial for supposedly a Â£1 in return for 440,000. Only thing is, it debited my card Â£6.99 and I had to phone up and complain. Got the refund, cancelled the renewal and got 460,000 currency for a Â£1.  If you check some of the Bingo offers carefully, some only require you to sign up as a new customer and deposit Â£10 without actually having to play. After a couple of days, get onto their free support, request any bonus Â£Â£Â£ is removed and withdraw your deposit. This can get you 450,000 - 600,00 free currency for free basically. Think this worked for LeoVegas and Virgin Bingo/Casino.  The extra currency comes in handy on daily like Vintage Thursdays. Regardless of how much currency you have, the temptation is to pull, pull, pull cards so it doesn't take long to go through it so be careful how much you spend"
starwarstrader,3e238x,uluckypeople,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:27:24 2015 UTC,"Great tip regarding getting a refund, I will be trying this in the future as with all the bonus you get you never get a chance to withdraw anything you might be fortunate enough to win."
starwarstrader,3e238x,uluckypeople,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:57:14 2015 UTC,"Any gambling sites on there that I've not heard of I tend to google and gauge from there whether it's legit . Glad I did as about 6 weeks ago there was a deposit â‚¬20 get 1.7 Million credits from a site I'd never heard of, google looked good so I chanced it with a credit card I don't use often. I wonder if it was a mistake as I never saw that offer again on my gfs ipad and neither did my friend the next morning. I didn't get the reward initially but chased with tapjoy and got it about a week or so later.  The sky ones all work, I tend to cancel as soon as the reward hits so I don't forget and get charged a month later. All of the gambling ones I've tried (betway bingo, virgin, netbet, butlers bingo and a couple of others) have all worked though a couple I've had to chase tapjoy for.   Just make sure you save your registration and deposit receipt emails as copies of these are what tapjoy ask for. Through tapjoy I've probably spent around Â£60 but I've had probably close to 5 million credits for it."
starwarstrader,3e238x,jericon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:28 2015 UTC,"My credit card allows me to generate a new number with a lower limit that is good for a month or two. I have been using that for ""iffy"" offers to ensure I don't get scammed."

starwarstrader,3e0sp6,Alamoth,2,Tue Jul 21 02:39:27 2015 UTC,"I usually try 5-10 packs, but recently I've been questioning why, since they don't have much trade value and I really don't care about base parallels."
starwarstrader,3e0sp6,Alamoth,3,Tue Jul 21 02:46:10 2015 UTC,The problem I have with SWCT is that I love base parallels. When I collect physical cards it is my absolute favorite thing to collect. But with SWCT it's virtually impossible to make any reasonable progress beyond Yellow base set.
starwarstrader,3e0sp6,tinyasterisms,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:56:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I wasn't huge on base parallels for a long time. I was like, I'll collect all of yellow and completely ignore gold and variants because there's no way I'll ever complete those sets.  But I picked a few characters to ""complete"" and have been SUPER satisfied seeing all of the base variants all lined up together.  If you don't count award cards, I have full Aayla, Ahsoka, Asajj, Aurra, Barriss, Luminara, and Shaak Ti. :)"
starwarstrader,3e0sp6,Jaden_____Smith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:12:40 2015 UTC,"yeah the golds are horribly distributed. The fact that the Sidious pack isn't 25k probably pushes more people away than it should.  Plus for the purple and brown parallels you'd have to drop so many credits to try and get the full S2 set. And then yeah, the Green and Orange are always a huge pain to get."
starwarstrader,3e0sp6,jericon,2,Tue Jul 21 03:13:53 2015 UTC,"I just traded orange Vader for ""not the droids"" WV... so they have at least some trade value ;)"

starwarstrader,3e0sp6,thegregwitul,3,Tue Jul 21 08:03:58 2015 UTC,"Depending upon the character, I only try green packs until I land my first green card. For that orange pack, I'm done at that point, whether I get orange or a crappy red.  I figure that somewhere, someday, if I really want the orange, I'll trade for it.  The only exception is R2-D2. I will open every pack on earth to land an orange for my wife."
starwarstrader,3e0sp6,sjmleicester,2,Tue Jul 21 03:58:15 2015 UTC,"I can't lie, I love the variant colors for the characters I collect (bounty hunters, Vader, Emperor, Jabba, Sly Moore, etc) and my wife continued her hot streak and nabbed me two green and one Orange Vader, so I'm ecstatic.  I have all of the variant colors except for the elusive 17 count purple Death Star Inspection Vader, so I'm very pleased."
starwarstrader,3e0sp6,PrivateTickler,2,Tue Jul 21 03:15:49 2015 UTC,"Got lucky with the Tauntaun last night and pulled the green and Orange variant. The problem is, it is so tempting to keep pulling packs at 500 and before you know it you've burnt through 25,000 or more.  I really should make more effort to trade myself one.  I like the base variants, if you can get a Orange they are certainly that much rarer and therefore more valuable. The greens don't seem to have a tremendous amount of trade apart from exchanging for another green if you get a dupe."
starwarstrader,3e0sp6,Jaden_____Smith,2,Tue Jul 21 04:27:35 2015 UTC,"Really wanted this Vader, it's my new favorite base card.  I'm sure an opportunity will arise to trade for one in the future, this is ""card trader"" after all :)"

starwarstrader,3dyyrj,taksdk,4,Mon Jul 20 17:54:23 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm really disappointed about this. I busted my ass trying to get all five of the SDCC exclusives and not to hear anything since is not cool.
starwarstrader,3dyyrj,openwindowtime,3,Mon Jul 20 18:13:37 2015 UTC,"Am I correct that they've never even given a deadline, let alone distributed the award?"
starwarstrader,3dyyrj,taksdk,2,Mon Jul 20 19:50:10 2015 UTC,They said to have them all by the end of SDCC and get a a exclusive award for your shelf.
starwarstrader,3dyyrj,openwindowtime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:19 2015 UTC,"When/where did they say that? In the Transmissions for the SDCC Comics release, it says the comics will only be available during SDCC, but the ""Collecting all 5"" doesn't say anything about ""by the end of SDCC.""  Certainly other sets have had the deadline later than the end of the cards being available (like any badges that have sold out now, but the deadline is Monday)."
starwarstrader,3dyyrj,taksdk,2,Tue Jul 21 09:10:16 2015 UTC,"You are right about that! There is no clear ""deadline"" for the award. I misinterpreted the transmission."

starwarstrader,3dyyrj,j-samp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:35 2015 UTC,I believe you are correct - I have never seen a mention of a deadline and have been patiently waiting for my award (after trading quite a few low count inserts to finish off my set).
starwarstrader,3dyyrj,LeviTriumphant,7,Mon Jul 20 20:51:22 2015 UTC,Gotta love the communication between Topps and us.
starwarstrader,3dyyrj,Piratiko,11,Mon Jul 20 18:01:26 2015 UTC,"Steve sorta does what politicians do.   They will occasionally respond to messages sent to them by fans, but only when they were already planning on making that announcement. So it appears as though they're interacting with the fans and keeping the lines of communication open, but really, they're just saying what they want to say when they want to say it, but taking the opportunity to make themselves look good where possible.  Case in point, someone asked Steve about Manga, and he's like ""Last card is about to come out!""... TONS of people ask about Badges... crickets."

starwarstrader,3dyyrj,Piratiko,5,Mon Jul 20 19:59:12 2015 UTC,"lol, I can't wait for this to turn into DayZ all over again, where the fans all praise the developers for ""working so hard and listening to the fans"" when in reality, they're falling far behind development goals and generally sucking at their jobs.  SWCT is still decent, and they still seem to be working hard to fix problems when they pop up, but they've got a long way to go before I consider them worthy of praise."
starwarstrader,3dyyrj,mjsottawa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:05:37 2015 UTC,"I find it EXTREMELY difficult to use the term ""DECENT"" and ""SWCT"" in the SAME sentence after the DISASTROUS Monday they had on July 20th (yesterday).  Let's start with the basics:   GM Late.  Then, when it arrives, it's another Variant, a ""Special Edition"" of the ""Special Edition"" card.   Oh, and it GETS BETTER.  This Variant card, much like the OTHER CRAPPY REPEAT VARIANT Card, the one for Rebels Season 2, has NO VALUE when being assessed against the Wave 2 Award, putting it 2 WEEKS BEHIND ALL OTHER MARATHONS!  REALLY?   Could TOPPS NOT have knocked out an Empire Special Edition  Poster GM or something ELSE? COME ON!   Half-baked Teal Pack Launch.  Incorrect text stating when the Ten Numb Award was to be given out.   It's supposed to be WEDNESDAY the 22nd, not the SATURDAY, boys, yes, QA is coming back to BITE YOU ALL on the BUTT again, and once again, you look SLOPPY, and UNPROFESSIONAL!   On top of that, at 6 PM EST, the NEW Teal Pack launched several minutes prior to the TRANSMISSION FEED, leading many traders (including me) to get confused and worried that cards we drew from packs were not being allocated to our collections, because they weren't refreshing on our ""My Cards"" screens.   Thank God, this problem was fixed about a half and hour or so later. Sheesh!   WHO, EXACTLY, IS MINDING THE SWCT STORE here, people?   MYNOCKS??? :/   Boba Fett Badge released, but with a token 10K Credit Award only, and NO Award Card, which many Traders (fairly) assumed would be the remaining DARTH MAUL Shot Glass Art.   To add insult to injury, the Transmission Feed actually ASKED Traders ""What other cards would you like to see as Badges?"", when everyone knew the ballgame was basically OVER at that point.   (YAGC) YET ANOTHER GREEN CARD.  This time, Darth Vader, at the usually ridiculous 1:100 odds.   The only cards I pursued today were Storyboard and Badge.    Thank God I pulled the ones I was looking for within about 2-3 packs each, because frankly, I have had enough lately of being shafted by the TRULY SHODDY offerings in this app. :/  Not sure what to say about Comics and Reflections for Monday.  Reflections Jango-Windu actually looked half-decent, and Comics was OK, but the release rate of that, is, as always, Ridiculous, just like the rate is for Storyboard, so that kind of lost most of its luster, right out of the gate..."

starwarstrader,3dyyrj,MALAGANT_on_SWCT,2,Mon Jul 20 20:32:06 2015 UTC,"Well, Topps has us all wondering/talking about badges so not a bad PR move on their part. ;)  My best guess is this is another Classic Art situation.  They started a set without all of the art in the can.  They are probably waiting on some approvals or something and then we'll see it return."
starwarstrader,3dyyrj,MALAGANT_on_SWCT,3,Mon Jul 20 17:57:22 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.  I am not justifying the way sets are being handled because I think it's poor but we have no idea what goes on behind the scenes.  Management may force sets with incomplete art out before they are ready to recognize revenue in a specific month or quarter.  Or maybe the plan was to break a set up into smaller chases but then got pressured to extend it because it's generating more revenue from credits than was forecasted?  I would like to think there is always a plan as you have suggested but that just might not be realistic or there is always a plan but it changes due to factors that we can only speculate about.  As far as hiring more people, I see this suggestion a lot.  I'll just copy and paste from other comment above...  ...but if I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times, as long as users keep pumping money into the app, Topps has no motivation to do better. If they feel they are already maximizing revenue I'm sure it's hard to justify adding resources or improving the quality of the product.  And to be fair, the quality of the product is far better now than it was in the past. I still remember the days when the app used to completely crash every Sunday morning.  Like any company or product, we can complain all we want on this sub but the only vote that counts is the vote with our wallets. If there was a major exodus of users, and presumably a significant drop in revenue, I bet you would see some serious changes. Until then, you can always take your business to the other crack dealer in town. Oh wait, that's right...there is no other dealer in town. :("
starwarstrader,3dyyrj,MALAGANT_on_SWCT,2,Mon Jul 20 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected...""exceeding expectations on revenue"" is more accurate.  I've never felt that the general tone on the sub was warm & fuzzy but maybe it has gotten even worse and I just haven't noticed.  I don't really follow the other outlets but hopefully this shift in tone will not be ignored. If the increase in collections being sold on eBay are from paying customers quitting the app, then this should definitely be a concern for Topps."
starwarstrader,3dyyrj,blurryleg,3,Mon Jul 20 19:38:53 2015 UTC,"Vague tweets hint that they have an intern now, don't ever remember them having one, back with the TK and Teal refunds.  Agree 100%, comics being pushed to the new daily is just boring as heck. I'd much rather see 4 new different drops every other day then check in and go ""oh, cool, another comic and storyboard, awesome, wooo...""  It only drives me to skip and spend less when I see the same stuff. Even if we don't see a plan or pattern or schedule. They'd really benefit from one internally it seems."
starwarstrader,3dyyrj,mjsottawa,4,Mon Jul 20 22:34:11 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make sense, Malagant.  There are only TWO of these Badge images left, to my knowledge:   BOBA FETT, which Topps (on paper, at least) should already have approval for with the existing set,  and MAUL, a variant glass under the same company that made the Original shot glasses (Badge) designs.   Obviously it would make the most SENSE for Topps to release FETT as the 11th and LAST Badge and then save MAUL for the Award.    And also, it's pretty horrible they promised an SDCC award for the Comics set (SDCC 1-5) and have not delivered on that promise.  That's just SLOPPY, and bad communications all around.    Topps could have AT LEAST made a mention of it when releasing one of the REGULAR COMICS in the Transmission Feeds section. :/  This is a QoS issue, and should have been part of an internal PROCESS.    Keeping your CLIENTS (Traders...US) WAITING and TICKING them OFF FOR NO GOOD REASON, ISN'T a good IDEA...:/"
starwarstrader,3dyyrj,MALAGANT_on_SWCT,2,Tue Jul 21 13:43:12 2015 UTC,"So, a couple things...first of all, I completely agree with you on the poor communication.  This used to drive me crazy but I decided a while back that communication is just something the SWCT team will always struggle with so I've come to accept it, otherwise it would have pushed me over the edge a long time ago.  In terms of the art, I don't think it's safe to assume they've done any planning beyond the immediate future.  This is how we end up with variant GM cards.  After learning that the final 4 Classic Art cards were not ready mid-chase, it just wouldn't surprise me that the final 2 Badge cards might also not be ready.  We have no idea what goes on behind the scenes and Topps usually doesn't make any promises with regards to when a set will start and end.  You're also assuming there is a Badge Award Card but no ""card"" has been mentioned.  It might just be credits. :(  The SDCC Comics award is a very valid complaint.  Again, this is poor but also not surprising.  Bottom line...I completely agree with you on the QoS issue but if I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times, as long as users keep pumping money into the app, Topps has no motivation to do better.  If they feel they are already maximizing revenue I'm sure it's hard to justify adding resources or improving the quality of the product.

starwarstrader,3dyyrj,mjsottawa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:31 2015 UTC,"There's a reason why I keep harping on about QA and QoS issues.  It's because it's NEEDED, and it's NECESSARY.  For us NOT to COMPLAIN means that we think that EVERYTHING IS OK with the App, and given that clearly, 3 or 4 guys running the WHOLE SHOW just plain ISN'T WORKING WELL, means that AT SOME POINT, TOPPS will at least have to CONSIDER other options, or risk losing a FRANCHISE, digital or not.  I kind of compare it to a slower chain reaction Explosion Build-Up of the first (ANH) Death Star...  It may not have exploded....YET, but at some point, the clock WILL start ticking for many traders.  For a lot of traders, that process has already begun...

starwarstrader,3dyyrj,MALAGANT_on_SWCT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:49:21 2015 UTC,"I think the challenge is that you think ""3 or 4 guys running the WHOLE SHOW just plain ISN'T WORKING WELL"" but when Topps looks at the revenue that is being generated on the backs of those 3 or 4 guys, they might be extremely happy and see no reason to make any changes or further investment.  I hope you're right and Topps does take some steps to improve QA.  But while all the complainers continue to use the app, and many presumably continue to put money into it, I just don't see a lot changing.  But to be perfectly clear, I completely agree with you and really hope I'm wrong."

starwarstrader,3dzja0,blurryleg,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:17 2015 UTC,"Haha right. Wonder if they don't like the double dip, or if this was all planned. Gonna def screw up everything if we get the last vintage and WideVision next week and then GM finished 3 weeks later"
starwarstrader,3dzja0,JawnJacobJingleHimer,3,Mon Jul 20 21:39:12 2015 UTC,"I mean it makes sense, it seemed having all the awards for marathons all on the same week was a lot of work (especially if they have to do it manually for all the marathons) so having them staggered makes sense so the marathon award is a different week for them all and the best way to do that are these variants, but they'd be smart to stagger them better at this point. Knocking GMs around like this is killing it (at least for me, it was easily my favorite with gems like Heir and that Videogame Award!), but Prequels, Rebels Variant, ANH Variant and now this? Just sad."

starwarstrader,3dzja0,mjsottawa,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:17 2015 UTC,Even more bonkers: a reprint... from this wave. I just... words escape me.
starwarstrader,3dzja0,mjsottawa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:36:35 2015 UTC,I joined the game more recently so why would a GM be non- marathon? I thought the whole purpose of GM was that you had to collect them all.

starwarstrader,3dzfca,calente,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:13 2015 UTC,Did you give them the right postal address? Sometimes is takes 4-6 weeks to process.

When it arrived, I had almost TOTALLY forgotten about it, but I was REAL HAPPY to get it!  The thing is, we don't live in the 20th Century anymore.  We live in the 21st, and things SHOULD MOVE a LOT ~FASTER~..  :{"

I mean why do I even want to open this pack?  I can just trade for this once it becomes dead...  Pretty lame if some sets are going to have no award... the icon??  10k credits? lol...  So I'd much rather a lame color variant than NOTHING."
starwarstrader,3e06ra,blurryleg,6,Mon Jul 20 23:40:11 2015 UTC,"No award card, just an award in the award section and 10k credits. Guess they had issues nabbing the Maul art?"
starwarstrader,3e06ra,FreddyLegend,4,Mon Jul 20 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"So, if I'm reading correctly, there is no Award card, just a credit bonus & badge for the award case?"
starwarstrader,3e06ra,I_am_Redditculus,2,Mon Jul 20 23:12:43 2015 UTC,so no Maul? :/ That was the best looking one
starwarstrader,3e06ra,FreddyLegend,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:25:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Maybe they just worded it poorly. Either way, guess we'll see next Monday or maybe get some confirmation on Twitter from Steve."

starwarstrader,3e06ra,nahpiht,3,Tue Jul 21 00:51:34 2015 UTC,Is there an award card. The post makes it sound like there's no award card
starwarstrader,3e06ra,tinyasterisms,0,Mon Jul 20 23:12:37 2015 UTC,"The wording is weird.  ""...earn you a Badges of War award for your award case."" But the game doesn't have an ""award case"" so to speak, so I think it just means you get an award card for the awards card section."
starwarstrader,3e06ra,nahpiht,4,Mon Jul 20 23:17:58 2015 UTC,"It could mean an award icon on your home screen. The place where you get icons when you finish your white base, red base, etc...."
starwarstrader,3e06ra,tinyasterisms,3,Mon Jul 20 23:20:57 2015 UTC,"Ugh... I'm not even chasing this set, but if there's no award, that's an incredibly lame cop-out.  I NEVER look at that. I forgot it was even there."

starwarstrader,3e06ra,FreddyLegend,2,Mon Jul 20 23:21:48 2015 UTC,Full checklist is:  - Bounty Hunters  - Princess Leia  - Stormtrooper  - Heroes 1  - Yoda  - Empire  - Luke  - Heroes 2  - Darth Vader  - Han Solo  - Boba Fett
starwarstrader,3e06ra,Vious,2,Mon Jul 20 23:10:25 2015 UTC,"Pulled the Blue in about 3 packs, got bummed because I'm chasing Black; opened about 10 more & got the Black. Then someone offered me a Black Maul Elegant Weapons for the Blue. After the disappointment of GM today, this picked me up. Haha.  Also, not sure if anybody caught it, but on the Black card, you can tell they overlaid this image over the Heroes 2 Badge. You can see the tip of Han Solo's toe at the bottom."
starwarstrader,3e06ra,Piratiko,2,Mon Jul 20 23:30:13 2015 UTC,"Alright it's over. I will finally be back to chasing only one DPI(dedicated pack) again, white storyboards. Well, until they drop something else cool...  Hopefully that's awhile."

One of those where I don't think I could of gotten what I wanted with the sw cards, but the bunt card got me what I needed plus. Always fun"
starwarstrader,3dyl7q,JawnJacobJingleHimer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:43 2015 UTC,Had a similar experience with a cross trade to Kick. Most of the delay I think was time zone related though. Pulled a relic card yesterday (Grella) and posted to the feed over there. Had a couple of promising leads going that ran on into my daughter's bedtime and had to put it aside till morning. In the end I was able to get a very nice trade (a Vintage Roar and 2 classic arts ) for it so it worked out really well. I could never crack two packs on Star Wars Card Trader and get those kind of results so a little extra legwork was worth it.   It's a shame there isn't a better way to cross trade between apps. In the end it always requires someone to take a big leap of faith.

I originally wasn't going to touch this set, but when I realized that the packs were spitting out 2-3 inserts PER, I figured it would be worthwhile to grab a few. Ended up with almost all of the purples and over half of the blues (at the time). Quick easy trades for the ones I was missing, and here I am.  I really wish they'd end it. Between sketches and storyboards I'm a little tired of chasing stuff I don't really care that much about, and only chase out of a sense of obligation to complete the set."

While technically it's a (4,000) count green Luminaries for a (5,000) count blue Comic, green Luminaries really aren't worth much at all. Luminaries was not a very popular set and the award date has passed so it's considered a ""dead"" set.

We should have some new Chase packs coming up with badges and mangas now ending, so maybe one of them will be Rebels."
