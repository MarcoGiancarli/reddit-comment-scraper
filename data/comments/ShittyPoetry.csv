You two         should start a poetry club and publish your own collection of poems; the     result of your combined efforts could fucking                     change the world   this is a hugely disproportionate leaf. this must have some meaning

ShittyPoetry,3cfu52,no-sempai-dont,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:43:13 2015 UTC,Sometimes a fart can be a boom. I like to think the boom comes from when two hard objects within the intestines collide. Kind of like the car and the helicopter in fast and furious.

ShittyPoetry,3b868l,Las_Pollas_Hermanas,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"My translation, based on Seniorita B----'s Spanish class 15 years ago:  Immigrant, You say you are illegal, That your name is ""alien"" or ""illegal"" And other names are offensive. I don't understand your motives, But I think they are ignorant, Your opinions are not important. They don't know that the hands Of your Mexican ancestors Built this town. Yes, built this town. You'll always be my friend, Because you look like my uncle, Immigrant.   The poem begins and ends with the word ""Immigrant"", alluding to the perpetual Mexican experience in America. The individual described in the poem is resigned to his condition, but is off-putting and even offensive to the narrator. However, the narrator has no choice but to accept the man because ""te pareces a mi tío"" -- a commentary on familial values and the inevitability of the state of the worker-migrant."
