OceanicTagPro,3d4bd5,THRlLLH0,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:38:16 2015 UTC,Yeah you can't hear your own honks but you should be able to hear others. Ask someone through chat to press up and down to test it out.
OceanicTagPro,3cro7u,3z_,6,Fri Jul 10 05:50:29 2015 UTC,Whats UHC?  It just comes up with United Health Care in google
OceanicTagPro,3cro7u,Vinsanity9,3,Fri Jul 10 06:47:53 2015 UTC,"TL;DR, Hunger Games in Minecraft.  Longer version:  It's a survival gamemode, which is confined to a square map (which varies in size depending on the amount of players, but for 10, we'd probably go 600x600-800x800 or something).  The border of the map is usually defined by a giant wall of bedrock, or as I prefer, air and an oblivion.  Players begin the match by being randomly spread out across an even distance from each other, in a randomly generated1 seed.  Players do not regenerate health conventionally in UHC, and are only allowed to heal using golden apples and healing potions (see: additional rules) Additionally, golden apples can only be made using gold ingots instead of nuggets, and will only regenerate two hearts of health.  Once you die, you're out for good. The winner of UHC is the last man standing.  While there are these concrete rules for the game, there are many various formats for playing UHC -- these can include teams (usually 2-4), or more dynamic gamemodes, such as this season of UHC, wherein players are on their own until they find someone else -- the first person they meet becomes their teammate.  Some additional, optional rules include:   No strip-mining (usually as a measure of shortening games) No killing until 15 minutes into the game (so people don't die instantly; this can be boring for some players) No potion brewing (can be overpowered) No nether (to simplify/shorten games) An enemy's head (obtained by killing the player) can be used to heal to the same effect as golden apples   1 : Often multiple random seeds are generated, however one being selected manually that is suitable for UHC (i.e. lots of caves, dungeons, a few temples/villages, etc.)"
