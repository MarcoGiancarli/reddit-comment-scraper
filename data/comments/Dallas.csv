Dallas,3e2g2h,JohnnyChuttz,9,Tue Jul 21 14:49:41 2015 UTC,Probably Frisco or Allen.
Dallas,3e2g2h,ewynn9,4,Tue Jul 21 15:51:27 2015 UTC,"My guess would be Frisco.  The Allen Event Center already hosts hockey (Americans), indoor football (Revolution), and indoor soccer (Sidekicks).  And since hockey and basketball run similar seasons that would be challenging.    Frisco no longer has a hockey team playing at their arena since the Tornados left."
Dallas,3e2g2h,Milnoch,0,Tue Jul 21 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"Well, Cuban doesn't own the AAC.... but they will probably play a smaller venue, I'd imagine."

I don't really follow most sports too much, but I like going to local games, and it'll probably be affordable to get a ticket to these games.  I figure most of the people commenting haven't even seen a game, they're just going by the popular culture jokes that are made about the WNBA."
Dallas,3e2g2h,phasv2,3,Tue Jul 21 19:19:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah pop culture jokes are probably it. I'm not a fan of basketball in general(has roots in being shit at basketball and the rivalry my school's football and basketball teams had with each other), but this comment section seemed pretty extreme."
Dallas,3e2g2h,dam072000,7,Tue Jul 21 19:38:10 2015 UTC,99℅ of Dallasites would be happier finding a dollar bill on the ground than having this team win the championship.

Dallas,3e3a78,Thats_Doo_Doo_Baby,9,Tue Jul 21 17:01:14 2015 UTC,You might want to bring her to Dallas to check it out before having her move here...
Dallas,3e3a78,FIN9450,9,Tue Jul 21 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"Former New Yorker here, but of only 4 years.  To be brutal, she will probably hate it at first and will want to leave, but to be fair, when I moved to Brooklyn from here, I hated it at first and wanted to leave. I am back in Dallas now, and I wouldn't be here if it sucked. I was over New York, came down here to pursue a long-time crush and now I have a wife so it was a good move!  It will be a culture shock because the general population is pretty conservative and bible-belty compared to New York. Everything closes early compared to your current standards, and a lot of people do drinking wrong. Despite bars closing at 2am, people will wait until 10-11pm to go out, then hit it hard and get destroyed and sloppy. I still don't understand that. I didn't see that dynamic in NYC because there was more time and people seemed to pace themselves. Seamless is really not a thing, but it's starting to be, except GrubHub and a couple smaller more independent sites are more popular. You also don't have a whole lot of 24-hour stuff, but there isn't a need for it anyway. You can't get whatever you want at any time of day anywhere you are, but we do have Amazon Prime NOW and 24-hour Walmarts.  Dallas is cheap and dirty, and/or clean and expensive depending on which world you want to live in. Either way, you can have a lot of fun here, and meet a lot of amazing people if you end up in the right places. As someone in PR, all she would have to do is find events sponsored by brands, grand openings of fancy places, fashion events (yes, they do happen here), art openings/shows, fundraisers and galas. Eventually you'll keep running into the same people (""Heyyy! I just saw you at ArtCon!""), develop friends, and you're good.  The food, art and music scene a actually is really great here, it's just not in your face all the time like it is in Brooklyn. You have to seek it out, do your research and actually go to things. I find that when I feel like Dallas is boring, it's my own fault for not going out to parties and events. It's easy to have  super fun nights here, and you could go out every night if you wanted to without ""breaking the bank"" like in the city, but you can still pay $15 for a cocktail if you want to. You can also earn Williamsburg street cred by being able to drive to Austin whenever you feel like it.   After dealing with the subway for years, it does rule to drive your car to a store, park in a parking lot, go in, get your stuff, drive home and not have to drive around for 20 minutes looking for a parking spot and trying to read signs to see if you're gonna get a ticket in the next couple hours because of alternate side parking. Also, drive-thrus."
Dallas,3e3a78,Shirkaday,5,Tue Jul 21 18:42:19 2015 UTC,"if shes snooty, Dallas has plenty of snoot (if shes in PR, im assuming this).  Its probably #3 after LA and NYC in the snoot factor, tbh. If ya'll are actual fader-reading brooklyn cool kids, then the local cool music bookers are parade of flesh (white ppl music) and scoremore (black ppl music), you'll see about 80% of the cool bands you would be missing in NYC from that.  As the sidebar shows, Dallas is a great place to watch a movie, so you won't be missing out on any movies (might take 1-2 months to get them, but they'll get here).  Ft Worth's The Modern museum would fit right at home in NYC, and if you're craving art, Houston's world class museums are a great weekend trip as well.  Uhm.... bridge and tunnel people can be found in Uptown. Pre-barclay center brooklyn kids can be found in Oak Cliff and Lower Greenville.  If you miss your straight-edged past, 1919 hemphill is the DIY-Venue that all the brooklyn diy-venues in the past decade were trying to emulate (plus theres 2-3 rotating punk houses in denton that are legit).  Uhmmmmm.....  yea.  Dallas has plenty of upper middle class educated white people from the midwest, so theres plenty of ""cool"" basic people to befriend.  The dallas design district has plenty of art, and there are plenty of rich ass snooty Patrons here, so there is plenty of gallery opening culture here, if thats what she is worried about missing."
Dallas,3e3a78,crocken,6,Tue Jul 21 17:47:57 2015 UTC,"Your girlfriend is an adult who sounds like she has certain wants/needs about what she expects to get out of the city she lives in. If you're looking to convince her that Dallas is a suitable substitute for NYC or LA, well, it's just not. I'm not saying it's better or worse, just very different.  Yes, it's also a large city, but it differs in terms of layout, architecture, weather, culture, politics, and, of course, geographical location. Since you've visited a few times you already know this, and if your girlfriend has done any research about the area she knows, too. Instead of ""selling"" a move to Dallas to her, let her make her own decisions."
Dallas,3e3a78,TeaMistress,4,Tue Jul 21 18:14:48 2015 UTC,"i'm a native of dallas and have been to new york a handful of times, including brooklyn.  i get her sentiment of what she could potentially be leaving, as i find all of the five boroughs amazing, but dallas has that kind of pull too.  here's a short list...  in regards to music, we have, but not limited to:  1) concern venues such as gexa pavillion, house of blues, bomb factory, verizon theater, at&t performing arts center, trees, a multitude of bars and many more theaters that attract all sorts of talent.  2) we've a number of record stores josey records, good records, and off the record where you can find great vinyls and occasionally catch a great dj.  3) we're only a few hours away from austin if you wanted to see ACL or SXSW.  4) there are a few local music fests each year, i.e. JMBLYA and deep ellum block party.  5) you'll  find free music events like decks in the park at klyde warren park.  in regards to the arts scene (again, not limited to):  1) dallas museum of art, nash sculpture center, crow asian museum, meyerson symphony center, winspear opera center, wylly theater, and a number of other places.  2) there're always events and gatherings, i.e. midnight at the DMA and aurora dallas.  3) there's bishop arts district that is home to a myriad of great restaurants, boutiques, and art galleries.  i could go on and on, but i think the two cities are incomparable in the sense that they're both amazing in their own right.  we both have great food, art, music, people, culture and a ton of other things, but you'll have to willingly embrace the change."

Therefore, just by moving here, she gets serious cred in that set. She can move here and automatically be hipper than an awful lot of people. Ideas, styles and scenes that are common in NYC are rarer here, so if she wants to bring something cutting edge here, this is her opportunity. In other words, big-fish-small-pond scenario.

Dallas,3e11ms,phunpwn,6,Tue Jul 21 10:55:27 2015 UTC,"Truth. Back when it used to be called the martini bar or something they got in big trouble with the TABC for repeatedly over serving women. So much so that they got closed down and either rebranded or sold. I've worked down the street from there for almost seven years, if I was into cougars and loved Black Eyed Peas covers that's where I'd go.  Full disclosure- we're talking about older women that wear bedazzled clubbing hats, that type of place."

I went one time back when I was like 23 with a friend who was into the cougs. I think he chickened out so we were just standing around, which led to me getting bored, so I got drunk and jumped into the crowd. It was amazing how fast this one group pulled me in. They were out for one woman's 40th birthday. It was fun, but I didn't have a desire to do that again."

In the movie The 40 Year Old Virgin, when Steve Carell goes to the club and meets that chick who has a Mini Cooper and she ends up puking seafood all over him... that's the the type of cougar I always imagine hanging out at Sambuca. (Don't get me wrong though Leslie Mann is pretty hot outside of that role)  I've been there more than I'd like to admit, we had our Christmas parties at The Shops several times and everyone always wanted to after party there, plus my ex-gf's mom (who was single) and her friend loved that place so we'd get dragged there every once in a while... but you know... that's where the cougars go out to play and that's a fact."

Especially labs and smaller terriers. I will take the time to call the number only for the owner to say the dog is safe and that they forgot to remove the signs.  Glad you got your dog back.

Or would you realize change comes slowly?  We as a species are just getting over one man enslaving an entire nation and calling himself king, just getting over acceptability of beating wives, haven't stopped beating children, still so petty that the percent of photons that bounce off the president's skin is national controversy!  Even today there is a long way to go. It sounds like you have your expectations too high. The system is horribly corrupt. To even get into power requires at least playing the game. There are trillions of dollars riding on the status quo, and those that control those trillions are willing to spend, you guessed it, trillions to keep their trillions. To make matters worse, they are willing to play dirty. A hero in office may be what you are holding out for, but someone who is willing to compromise with the powers that shouldn't be is likely the only hope...and yes, you are right, Bernie will bend over once in office, but a Bernie Sanders bending over is far far better than a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump bending over.

Dallas,3dxvwn,19Kilo,16,Mon Jul 20 13:05:33 2015 UTC,"may say they're light   I'm guessing these are the little ATMs like you find at strip clubs and strip malls, so those are actually not too heavy.  Real ATMs have a lot of concrete and steel, so when I've read about those stolen it usually involves a backhoe or something similar to rip them out.  This just sounds like they grab and go.   white pickup ...How have we not found a pickup with probable damage?   It's Texas.  The Generic White Pickup is damn near the official state truck.

Dallas,3dxvwn,JRoch,3,Mon Jul 20 16:46:33 2015 UTC,"Well, did some quick checking and it looks like ATM theft started getting big a few years ago.  Time had an article from 2010 saying that Texas/Dallas had over 100 stolen at that time.  Figure a misc number between then and the 50 or so now, and I'm going to bet on ""No"" for the tracker, or it's easily located and disabled.  It's probably worth remembering that this doesn't appear to be the big mama-jammas that are outside the bank in the drive through.  These are the little ones that are independently owned and collecting your 3 dollar fee on top of whatever the bank charges you, and not official bank machines.  I doubt they have much more than some tiny bolts through the bottom (if at all) and an insurance policy protecting them.  Why do I get the feeling I'm writing a half-ass tutorial on ATM theft?"

Dallas,3e0rva,TouchTheGuyBelowMe,6,Tue Jul 21 01:59:30 2015 UTC,I'm in and around downtown Garland; Verizon FIOS if you can.
Dallas,3e0rva,KINGxWHEEZE,3,Tue Jul 21 02:09:06 2015 UTC,"Be careful though that Garland south of I-30 is all AT&T, and north of it should be all Verizon. There may be exceptions along the borders with Dallas etc, but generally speaking ...   U-Verse is to be avoided, unless you're in one of those new developments that actually has fiber to the premises/home instead of glorified last mile DSL. Even then, if you use them for TV, you can only use their DVRs because its not a standard TV cable connection, it's IPTV and it eats your bandwidth. FiOS provides a full regular coax cable TV connection over the fiber without impacting bandwidth, so you can use your own devices (either a TV directly for the few non-encrypted channels or a TiVo or other cablecard device).  TWC isn't great, but it's better than U-verse."

I had them at home for 3+ years and I'm pretty certain I'd just cut the cord completely and use a cellular connection rather than go back to them. Luckily I have Time Warner, which isn't perfect of course but at least they deliver the advertised speeds and I stay connected even when it rains."
Dallas,3e0rva,DallasITGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:15:52 2015 UTC,"To give you an idea of how bad U-Verse is... I've been without internet for five days already. ZERO service for 5 days.

The 15 year old delivery boy for Linders Drug Store which was located at 519 N Griffin St delivered to the houses in the nearby ""Red Light"" district. From 1910 to 1913 Dallas officially allowed prostitution to go unprosecuted in this area which was known as the Frogtown Reservation and was roughly defined by Woodall Rogers Fwy, Laws St, N Houston St and Wesley Alley. At the same time Hine also took this photo of a messenger boy inside the Frogtown Reservation which I think was taken just south of Broom St looking north down Griffin St with the Dallas Power & Light Company power plant visible in the background. Hine said that with business beginning at mid-day you could see prostitutes running back and forth across this street.

Dallas,3dus5d,Billy_Reuben,-6,Tue Jul 21 14:18:31 2015 UTC,That's weird. I wonder what went so horribly wrong with Obamacare then? I always heard that Romney considered his plan one of the worst and costliest mistakes he's made.
Dallas,3dus5d,Syjefroi,8,Mon Jul 20 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"Well, he ran away from it in the primary because he (correctly) perceived that the ACA was unpopular with the Republican base, and did not want to have MassHealth tied to it even though it was popular in MA.  The ACA is mostly working just fine and most of the individual components are very popular. It's just when you tell people the overall name (""Obamacare"") that people don't like it. So for the most part that plan didn't work well for Romney in the general election because the informal namesake of the opposition plan was his opponent, which meant that there a prominent advocate for the policies (obviously, no one in the GOP was going to defend the ACA). And Obama ran for something while Romney ran against something, more or less, which just didn't win a lot of voters over.  edit: I mean, don't get me wrong, MassHealth isn't perfect, but it works well enough that when reports like this come out (only a few days ago too!) they also can write that the reason why X isn't working well is because of Y and they are actively working on Y. In this case, the Y is generally a nationwide issue that is not exclusive to MA."

Dallas,3dus5d,MaceOfBass,0,Mon Jul 20 14:24:00 2015 UTC,"Eight years ago, and many of my best high school teachers are still working for the system. It'd be naive of me to pretend that things haven't changed, even within the last decade, but there's absolutely no way you can convince me that an enterprising kid can't still receive a good, nationally viable education in this state.  Don't get me wrong though, I think we've gone the wrong way under Perry and Abbott and I believe we should always work towards better educational standards."

As the oldest of four brothers, I got to watch as education standards and accountability in public schools were regressively eroded in the years after graduating vicariously through them. by the time my youngest brother was in school, it way grades were calculated and standardized testing had radically changed the way public education worked, to the point where the last one ended up getting his GED early and getting out rather than deal with the banality of senior year. I don't have kids, but based on the experience of my brothers, there's no way I would ever put a child in Texas public school, and that's a shame."

Dallas,3dus5d,Syjefroi,9,Sun Jul 19 20:57:48 2015 UTC,"This was a very reasonable post that, unfortunately is getting downvoted.  The answer to your question is: Rand Paul is not a legitimate candidate because he has little to no support within his own party (unlike Marco Rubio, a candidate that has a small but viable shot of winning his party's nomination). So if the question is then, can Sanders beat Rubio, I don't know. But he can't beat Paul is Paul isn't the nominee. That said, the reasons why Paul won't be the nominee are basically the same for why Sanders won't be the Democratic nominee. He's not disliked the way Paul is, he just hasn't spent years building a coalition of supporters within the party. He doesn't have the internal support of party actors, labor leaders, etc etc. This process, by the way, is called the invisible primary, and it's a totally normal part of politics."

But for me campaign finance reform is #1, so I don't see myself voting for anyone else in the primaries."

And this is precisely the point of a primary and why it's worth it for you and others to vote for Sanders, despite the fact that he will not be the nominee. Winners of primaries always take some of the popular policy proposals from losers and roll them into their general campaign. Bernie won't win, but some of his best ideas will live on, and if the winner of the Democratic party wins the general on those promises, it's all but guaranteed that they'll try to pass them into law."

Dallas,3dus5d,Syjefroi,3,Sun Jul 19 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"Right, but to do that he has to have lined up support ahead of time from many many party actors and leaders. That's to get the nomination of a party he has not been a part of. In other words, he won't win a single state, because it's not possible. It would be like running to be CEO of a company that you've never been an employee at, and the company is a mom and pop shop with several children who have been training to take over. Scale is obvious very far off, but the social aspect is, more or less, how it works. I loves me some Bernie, and he'll get my vote, but he's also not going to win a single state."

Dallas,3dus5d,RIPDeepEllum,-18,Sun Jul 19 20:19:46 2015 UTC,"How did you go from my innocuous question to ""do you even vote""?  You seem defensive."

When the election is over, if he doesn't win, the issues remain and hopefully we have more people who care about them. If more people care about income inequality and the political system being bought by the super-rich than before, then this will have been a successful campaign.  I dunno, that's just how I feel about it."

I'm hoping for some Democratic or Republican dark horse, but I'm probably going to sit this one out"
Dallas,3dus5d,friendlysoviet,6,Sun Jul 19 21:28:57 2015 UTC,Don't sit it out.  If Sanders is the only candidate you can stomach at least vote for him.
Dallas,3dus5d,mutatron,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:32:14 2015 UTC,"I like Sander's for his character, not his views.   I like Hilary for her more moderate views, and not her character.   I just wish we had a charismatic moderate like Obama again. :("
Dallas,3dus5d,FlightyTwilighty,3,Sun Jul 19 21:39:10 2015 UTC,"Why would you sit out a general election? You still need to vote for a US senator, a US representative, a state senator, a state representative, some other state offices, and a slew of municipal offices.  Besides that, it doesn't matter who you vote for for president in Texas, it's always going to be the Republican. Maybe in 2020 and later it will matter, but not in 2016."

She's too far out of touch and there is so much questionable dirt that will be dug up if she gets the nomination. Sanders made a good point today that if republicans would listen to his message there should be a lot of stuff they agree with. But unfortunately a lot of that crowd has been voting against their own interests for years, so who knows."
Dallas,3dus5d,Syjefroi,3,Sun Jul 19 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"I'd wager he has a greater chance than Hillary. She's too far out of touch and there is so much questionable dirt that will be dug up if she gets the nomination.   You think that after Bill's run for governor, Bill's run for President, Hillary's run for Senate, Hillary's run for President, and Hillary's time in the State Department, there is still something out there that is so damaging that it would immediately sink her campaign? You realize that's crazy, right?  You don't have to be a Hillary Clinton support to know that her ""questionable dirt"" is all out there, and it's done with. On top of that, voters actually have scandal fatigue, after decades of people crying wolf on her."

Dallas,3dvhhf,luckytopher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:12:30 2015 UTC,I have friends bitch about Dallas being boring and I can't wrap my mind around it. I went to three different concerts this weekend for free here in Dallas. Some people are just so boring.
Dallas,3dvhhf,Valveguy101,-7,Tue Jul 21 13:41:24 2015 UTC,"Richardson, Garland, Plano, Frisco, Little Elm are really boring dude. There is very little culture and night life there. There might not be any at all."
Dallas,3dvhhf,ttracker1,14,Mon Jul 20 04:24:13 2015 UTC,"I think reddit hivemind forgets that not everyone is 18-24 and wants to go to bars and clubs.  Yes kids, it is possible to have a good time in the suburbs, other people have different interests than you.  Different strokes for different folks.  Here in burbs you likely would be bored out of your mind, but I enjoy throwing my water shoes on and dipping in the creek in Breckenridge park.  Or maybe going to the outdoor gun range and getting in some practice.  Do a little mountain biking over at Rowlett Creek Preserve.  Do some fishing over at the Lavon dam spillway, or boating on Lake Ray Hubbard."
Dallas,3dvhhf,KantLockeMeIn,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:39:20 2015 UTC,"Sure, but those activities are relatively easy to drive to whenever you randomly decide to do something like that. If you can walk there, that's cool, but I'm guessing not. As opposed to those that like bars, nightlife, restaurants, and other cool ass shops... and live within walking distance, which is pretty damn awesome. But yeah, it depends on what people like. For example, I have a friend that lives in Plano and loves going to shit at the Shops at Legacy, but that place is horrendous to me, so whatever."
Dallas,3dvhhf,tonictuna,7,Mon Jul 20 06:37:17 2015 UTC,I live in the suburbs and can walk to the train station from my house with a mortgage payment half of Uptown rent. Saving hundreds of dollars per month to trade for a 20 minute train ride is pretty easy.

Dallas,3dvhhf,James-Wing,3,Mon Jul 20 05:32:46 2015 UTC,"I lived in Austin for 10 years and Georgetown for 4 years.  I've lived in Addison or McKinney for 5 years.  It's not really an accurate comparison. Georgetown feels very much like an isolated town; you do Georgetown stuff until you get bored, then you drive to Austin as a weekend excursion.  In Addison or McKinney, you really feel like you live in a nicer part of Dallas. Since everything is a decent drive here unless you shell out $1500/mo for a tiny apartment in Uptown, by it's not really super feasible to live there unless you're at a time in your life where you can afford some decent stuff.  Georgetown had a really distinct culture and was perfectly fine by itself, but McKinney/Addison feel much more like just a part of Dallas."
Dallas,3dvhhf,slackador,4,Mon Jul 20 13:10:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with this wholeheartedly.   I lived in Austin/Leander/Liberty Hill for 19 years. Each area is distinct and has its own culture. It takes 30-45 mins of driving on open highway minimum to reach downtown Austin. Georgetown has its own shops, culture, small resturants to make it feel completely different.   Stopping by monument cafe? Not going to get anything close to that in Austin. There's only one ElArroyo, one Oasis, etc etc. But you're not going to see a bar anywhere as frequently in the burbs outside of Austin like you would in Plano/McKinney/Addison.   In Dallas/Burbs you can hit up a Zennas, or a Fox and Hound, or Bluefish, or just about any ""small time"" bar or eatery chain has a place in Plano, MK, Addison. You really can't tell where the cities end in DFW. I know when I drive to to Austin I know where Pflugerville, Round Rock, Georgetown, Leander, Cedar Park all begin and end. If you drove into Dallas and took the toll up to Parker you'd get the distinct feeling you are just in one huge city, and you'd have to look at the signs to even see you changed."

Dallas,3dvhhf,ewynn9,2,Mon Jul 20 11:49:48 2015 UTC,"There's stuff to do in the suburbs, it's just different.  It just depends on what you're looking for.  If you want to go to happy hour on a Tuesday with some friends who all live in Dallas proper, living in the burbs makes it a pain in the ass.  I have friends who live by me, going out is a quick text ""hey meet me at so and so bar, let's get a few beers"", boom we're there in 30 minutes.  You can do that in the burbs, but in my experience, everyone in the burbs is married and has children or married or has children, and those people don't typically meet up for happy hour.  The way I always lay it out for people is, if you're married with children or children on the way, the burbs is the best place.  If you're single and social, Dallas proper is the way to go. I'm sure i'll be back in the burbs eventually."

Second, you don't have to live in Uptown for the ""full experience"" as there are many full-bodied neighborhoods in Dallas - there's M Streets, Henderson, Uptown, Cedars, Oak Cliff, Greenville, Lakewood, etc. etc.  The neighborhoods will all have different personalities, so just look around and see what you like."

Dallas,3dr3f4,stevil30,3,Sun Jul 19 00:10:07 2015 UTC,Indeed.  Soon after it came out I got good enough I could play indefinitely on one quarter.  My longest stint was 12 hours. (I'd put a shoe on the firing button to run out for bathroom breaks.)  I played it at the arcade made out of an extra theater at the old Casa Linda Theater. (Now a Natural Grocers in the Casa Linda Plaza.)
Dallas,3dr3f4,greg_barton,2,Sun Jul 19 00:48:32 2015 UTC,Ahhh Casa Linda Plaza!! I grew up in east Dallas and we used to go to the cafeteria and blockbuster there all the time. Randomly coming across the name again just brought back a ton of memories
Dallas,3dr3f4,mausmtn,11,Sun Jul 19 06:40:57 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone. Corey from Free Play Arcade here. I was actually planning on making this post today. Here are a few specifics:   Our permit to open the arcade was the first arcade permit granted by the City of Richardson in more than a decade and the permitting process was actually quite challenging. We spent months walking neighborhoods, meeting with different local associations, and trying to explain that our new business would be a good thing for the City. Our tentative opening game list has actually expanded substantially. We have more than 100 retro games that will be working through the arcade, although we don't anticipate having them all out at once. We anticipate ~70 arcade games on the floor at opening and ~7 pinball machines. We will have new games on the floor every month and the lineup will refine and develop over time. We are now right in the middle of the build-out process for our space, which will take a couple of months. We'll be doing special events around town to get the word out and maintain the high levels of anticipation while we get the arcade built.  We really appreciate the kind words we've received so far. This has taken years of planning and the seeing the excitement in the community has really helped keep us driven to bring the absolute best arcade experience to DFW.   I'll be checking in if you have any questions. Thanks again."

If you want to bring your kid during the day and share some of these awesome games with them, no problem. The rules in our special permit are: anyone under 13 must be accompanied by a guardian at all times and anyone under 18 must be gone by 9 PM.  We are ""family friendly"" but absolutely not ""kid friendly"" or ""family targeted"". You will never find huge throngs of kids at this arcade.

I think we steamrolled that game like 2 times straight through before my mom was done with whatever meeting downtime and I had to leave.

I'm not certain, but I think one of the DFW 18 runways was supposed to be closed this morning (18R, I think) for scheduled maintenance.  That may have played a factor.

Dallas,3dpayx,Toleer,13,Sat Jul 18 07:27:56 2015 UTC,"It is a river still, but it's rather narrow in a lot of places here. When we had all that flooding a month or so ago, it was to those borders on either side, almost washing over them.  The Trinity River widens as it goes south in many places, and also meets multiple large lakes (all artificial). Lavon and Ray Hubbard here in Dallas are two places it hits, and Ray Hubbard is where almost all of Dallas' water comes from. That and that new pipeline along HW 78 that goes to Lake Texoma. Because the Trinity feeds the resevoirs, it stays narrow up here because we keep our water supply lakes full. It used to be much wider."
Dallas,3dpayx,Quacksmack,8,Sat Jul 18 05:55:51 2015 UTC,"You're kind of right about why the river is generally narrow, but I just want to clear up the geography.  The East Fork of the Trinity River flows down through Lavon and Ray Hubbard then meets the section that flows through downtown southeast of Dallas.  The section that runs through downtown is the combined West Fork and Elm Fork of the river."
Dallas,3dpayx,angelvsqz,4,Sat Jul 18 12:44:23 2015 UTC,There was lots of rain that ended up in the river that didn't hold that much water and flooded to record levels. It was nice to see the trinity river with that much water!

Dallas,3dpayx,mutatron,2,Sat Jul 18 07:04:18 2015 UTC,"Three forks of the Trinity converge just northwest of downtown Dallas. The West and Clear Forks going into Fort Worth have a smaller watershed than the Elm Fork, which I guess is why they're more tame.  At Dallas, because of the large watershed and the flat terrain, it's prone to flooding when it rains, but there's only enough spring water to make a 100 foot wide river otherwise.  Then one time back in 1908 it flooded so bad, it knocked out the only bridge to Oak Cliff, so they made a plan to move it and control it. Over the next 20 years the river was moved a little to the west of downtown, straightened out, and large levees were put up on either side."

Dallas,3dnpm1,aluengas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:10:20 2015 UTC,What do those signify??
Dallas,3dnpm1,Forkthatwaffle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:31:29 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming here, based on my vast experience watching war movies.  :-)  But pilots would mark their planes with ""kills"".  This was primarily done by fighter pilots...each confirmed kill was commemorated by a ""stamp"" on their craft.  Zeros for Japanese planes, swastikas for Germans.  I would assume the stamps mean that plane made 24 bombing runs and the gunner had 2 confirmed kills."

Dallas,3dnpm1,jb4427,4,Sat Jul 18 01:10:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is up to date but that may be 12 flight ready planes soon. I visited the WWII air training museum in Douglas, GA back in October and they were restoring Memphis Belle (first B-17 to fly 25 missions and return home and subject of a 1990 film). Wikipedia says it's in Dayton Ohio but I'm pretty sure it's out of date. If it isn't already it should be flying sometime soon."
Dallas,3dnpm1,touchmyfuckingcoffee,2,Sat Jul 18 00:54:02 2015 UTC,"It's based out of Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, but if they really are restoring it I could see them moving it down to GA for something like engine teardown and modification. That's awesome news if they are, though!"
Dallas,3dnpm1,tractorcrusher,3,Sat Jul 18 01:14:01 2015 UTC,Yeah it was near completion in October. I got to go in and it was quite experience. I talked to the guy leading the restoration and he said they wanted to make it completely flight ready. It wouldn't surprise me if it's going back to ohio.

Dallas,3dnpm1,DallasITGuy,3,Fri Jul 17 22:30:13 2015 UTC,"Cavanaugh is currently home to FiFi, which is the last flyable B-29. But there's a group out there closing in on a full restoration of another airframe, called Doc."

Dallas,3dnpm1,Id_fuck_your_mom,3,Fri Jul 17 23:34:21 2015 UTC,"I used to work in Addison Circle right down the street from the Addison airport and the Cavanaugh museum. One of my co-workers, let's call him Dan because that's what his name is, would volunteer at the museum during lunch about three days a week. He would just do whatever around the place, cleaning, dusting, washing, just whatever they needed done. He'd clean the airplanes too. They wouldn't pay him, hence the volunteering, but he got to do ride-alongs in whatever plane they were taking out if they had an extra seat. He's flown around Dallas dozens of times in this particular B-17 over the years. It's a pretty cool setup. He never asked for anything, he's just an honest dude that likes to work around historic aircraft.  Which reminds me of another story- When my dad was a kid (born in 1940), they lived on an air force base, and back then the rules were much more relaxed. They'd take a B-17 or B-25 or whatever on a training flight and they'd just let my dad (as a young boy) hop in and buckle up and fly around with them. Those were the days I guess.  EDIT: you should cross post this to r/aviation which is where I thought I was seeing this in. They'd love it, we're friendly folk."
Dallas,3dnpm1,DallasITGuy,3,Sat Jul 18 00:25:53 2015 UTC,"I was lucky enough to be at a few events and airshows and museums that let us see these great planes over the years and if you ever get the chance to go see something like this in person, I highly recommend it. not quite the same as getting to talk firsthand with the people that lived those journeys, but you can feel it when you are up close and personal with these machines of greatness."

Dallas,3dnr0k,mutatron,4,Fri Jul 17 19:51:48 2015 UTC,I would think its a mixture. More towards south of loop 12 going to cedar hill is hilly and a bit of lewisville is like that too. East Dallas is more piney woods. West FortWorth is prairie. Plus all the dirt around dfw in general is mainly red dirt/ clay but parts will have shales.   Thank goodness I still remember something from Texas history class.

Dallas,3dnr0k,mattmitsche,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:52:11 2015 UTC,"There's probably good reason that project doesn't have more publicity, and I don't exactly know why. But it is conflict with virtually every other piece of meteorological evidence out there, so if it were true, I'm sure we'd see more written about it. However, the hills myth is one of the biggest urban myths in tornado history.  Beyond just observing a single hill slowing a tornado, the project did not analyze that valleys actually increase tornadic rotation.  http://www.tornadoproject.com/safety/myths.htm   That logic disregards some very basic ideas. It ignores the likely possibility that rivers, ridges, and valleys have little or no effect on mature tornadoes. Tornadoes have passed seemingly unaffected over mountain ridges 3,000 feet high. Dozens have crossed the Mississippi River, from Minnesota to Louisiana. Both sides of the river, at the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, near St. Louis, have seen devastating tornadoes.  Topography may have some influence, but protection is not one of them. Weak tornadoes may damage hilltops. But well-formed, mature tornadoes may actually stretch themselves into valleys and intensify. During this vortex stretching, the funnel diameter may shrink in diameter and the tornado will spin even more rapidly. This is hardly what one would call protection for buildings in a valley.   http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/faq/   Do rocks, hills, or trees increase or decrease the wind speeds in a tornado?  Unfortunately, there is no clear answer. Both observations (of real tornadoes), computer simulations, and laboratory studies (in tornado vortex chambers) have shown that the “surface roughness”, i.e., the measure of how disrupted the wind near the ground is by objects such as dirt, rocks, hills, trees, and even houses, can either increase or decrease the wind speeds in a tornado. How can trees increase the wind speeds? Well, the strongest winds in a tornado occur when air from outside the tornado can flow closest to the center of the vortex. The conservation of angular momentum, e.g., the rotation in the air, requires that as the air flows toward the center of the tornado (as it spirals in) its rotation must increase. Depending on the configuration of the airflow outside of the tornado, sometimes there is not ENOUGH “inflow” toward the center, and so blobs of air outside the tornado do not get very close to the center of rotation before they are lifted upward off the ground. In this case, INCREASING the surface roughness helps get these blobs of air closer to the center of the tornado, where they rotate even faster than before. So occasionally we see in tornado videos the vortex increasing in intensity when it travels from one type of ground surface (say a field) into a grove of trees or a housing subdivision. It does not always happen, but often enough that we are aware of it. This is a case where “friction,” which people normally think of slowing things down, actually speeds them up!   http://www.theweatherprediction.com/weatherpapers/103/   When it comes to reliable data on the impact the Boston Mountains have on tornadoes, it is largely inconclusive. Whether there is decreased activity or not in the region, forecaster should not allow this to impact their warnings to the public. As has been proven multiple times, especially on February 5, 2008, the Boston Mountains are not immune to tornadic activity. The valleys, hidden some 1500 feet below the ridge line, offer no protection to communities from tornadic activity.   Furthermore, while I didn't address your insane flooding statement, you do realize that your theory only works if you live on top of the hill right? Hilly regions are not immune to flooding, and I'd argue that everyone living in the valleys would actually have an increased chance of flooding, especially flash flooding. So, if you are arguing that hills protect from tornadoes (they don't), then that would technically only apply to people on a very specific side of the hill in relation to the movement of a single tornado. But, if that were true and they had protection, then they would still be flooded out. So...."

It's clean (though some areas are currently being repaired, quickly) and the food is above average for the price. I've been thoroughly happy with the deep tissue massages.

Not sure why you say it's not kid-friendly, it's got a massive kid section to the pool area and a huge 2-3 story water slide. Spa Castle has one lil kid pool. King Spa's steam room is usually 115-120° and their cold bath is usually 60°. Two very important things for me.    can potentially cause a problem for anyone who is claustrophobic.   My ex wife was claustrophobic and had zero problem in any sauna of King Spa.  Spa Castle has most of the same, just bigger. It's nicer, with pools outside. Getting into that giant hot tub in the winter is amazing. Great cave-pool too, and multiple hot tubs.

Dallas,3dkqkq,LeonAquilla,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"I just entered ""Black iron gym"" into the search.  Usually any place that advertises itself as a black iron gym has lots of free weights.  You'd probably have to call to ask if they'd just let you monkey around with the weights on your own but it's worth a shot.     Crossfit does blow but at least they usually have plenty of equipment and don't give a shit if you drop it."

I really hope the aera becomes what they want to to be. I think the giant parking garage between victory ave and victory park lane needs to die. It could at least be underground. The low-rise apartments between Houston and field need to go away too, but what do I know about urban development ..."
Dallas,3diejj,Cheetoelover,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:20:24 2015 UTC,"I hope so too.  There will be a ton of new construction completed in the next 2-3 years which will make a HUGE difference.  Plus changing two major streets from one-ways into two-ways will make it a lot less intimidating to walk across.  I think the area was ahead of its time, but I really think it'll all come together in about 5 years.  A huge advantage is the proximity to Uptown which is quickly running out of available land.  I agree about that parking garage.  It really creates a deadzone there.  One great way to reduce the dead-zone aspect is to simply put in some retail on the ground floor, but it's a bit late to add something like that to an existing parking garage.  I do like that they seem to know what went wrong with VP and are working towards fixing it.  Just hope it works out for the area."

Bringing in inexperienced teachers with the Teach For America program to replace the higher paid veteran educators.

Dallas,3dgc38,_tx,2,Thu Jul 16 16:21:31 2015 UTC,Don't go east of campus
Dallas,3dgc38,Gettingbetter,2,Fri Jul 17 12:31:46 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I hated living in Arlington. The people who live in the nice parts of Arlington near Little Road live in a strange bubble that doesn't feel like Arlington. I've had several opportunities to move back for cheaper rent, but 360 is a nightmare; Arlington drivers are the worst in DFW; Cooper and Collins are the worst; you can hear gunshots at night from almost any point in the city.  A lot of parts of Arlington are fine, but a lot are not. Rather than a list of places to avoid, here's a list of the relatively safe areas:   UTA Campus - When I started going to uni here, the campus had about a murder a year/semester. After the stimulus package came through, and the Arlington crackdown on gangs in the article it got a lot safer. Gangs would go rolling for students, and I think still do. Don't walk alone at night on the edge of campus. Don't let anyone borrow your cell phone. If you want to go out drinking with friends, go with a group of 4+ and make sure you have a DD or Uber ready to take you home Lincoln Square near Collins and I-30 - This is a busy enough tourist spot that you'll be fine Shopping areas on South I-20 - Same as above. I consider the I-20 corridor from Collins to Loop 820 pretty safe. Pantego - An enclave off of Park Row and Bowen. It's actually it's own town. I like it, but the police there are aggressive with speeding tickets. Don't get caught rushing down the hill or you will be pulled over. Green Oaks Blvd North Green Oaks and South Green Oaks are generally fine areas in my experience. I can't speak to the part of Green Oaks that's in Fort Worth proper though as I only ever drive through there.   Finally, Central Arlington is the devil's armpit. Unpleasant circumstance will occasionally force you to go shopping or dining in that area, but it sucks. Anything on Division sucks except QT. Anything on Abrams east of Center Street sucks. Don't go there."
Dallas,3dgc38,atr0038,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:59:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, this is very helpful! Any advice on parking for her at UTA? She'll have a few night classes, so I don't want her to have to walk too far by herself at night."
Dallas,3dgc38,Gettingbetter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:38:05 2015 UTC,"Parking at night can be a little tricky, but most campus lots are well lit and safe. Just park as near as she can to the campus and she should be more than ok. Maybe around the Mac as that's a very busy area, which gives folks less opportunity.  As winter rolls in and it starts getting dark earlier, she might consider having a classmate or a campus officer escort her, or she can park in the garage near the chemistry building, although that adds up. If I were her, I might carry a small vial of pepper spray. One year a girl was attacked by someone who leaped out of the bushes in the heart of campus late at night. She stabbed him in the eye with a comb and got away, but that always made an impression on me.  Most nights nothing is going on, and the campus is safe, so don't be too paranoid, but take simple precautions you know?"
Dallas,3dgc38,Skydog69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:06:08 2015 UTC,If you arrive at campus after 6 (might be 6:30?) there's a faculty parking lot right across the street from University Hall that you can park at. It's well lit and not far of a walk at all. I did that for 3 years and never had any issues but I got plenty of e-mails about people walking a little farther out around the same time getting robbed or assaulted FWIW
Dallas,3dgc38,mybrotherhasabbgun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:51:12 2015 UTC,Make sure she has MavAlert (or whatever it's called) set-up to send to her phone. They are pretty good about sending out alerts when there an issue near campus.
Dallas,3dgc38,Gettingbetter,2,Thu Jul 16 18:39:37 2015 UTC,That's not helpful.
Dallas,3dgc38,jon_k,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:44:48 2015 UTC,"Which areas of Arlington should she avoid?   The entire UT campus area. The school is amazing, but the neighborhood is more dangerous then the 5th-12th wards in new orleans.  My friend would never stay out past dark on campus as she was uncomfortable. There was a murder and a rape in the parking lot while she was on campus. She said every week it seemed there was a breakin or broken glass spotted in the parking lot. I think there were 2 murders in the parking lot while she was on campus.  Her car was broken into once but nothing was stolen. Campus security seems to be non existent on that campus. Considering how low-class the area is becoming, it's surprising their campus cops don't make more arrests in the area."
Dallas,3dgc38,NatWu,5,Thu Jul 16 18:41:21 2015 UTC,"That is wildly inaccurate.  https://www.uta.edu/campus-ops/police/docs/Campus_Crime_Statistics_2011-2013.pdf  https://www.utsystem.edu/pol/2009%20Annual%20Report.pdf  No murders on campus. There was, four or five years ago, a report of shots fired in that little park by Centennial Court and a bullet struck the outer wall of one of the apartments. There are rapes, but none that were masked strangers breaking in. They've all been domestic, either couples or date rape (and in one case a manager taking his drunk student employee home frome one of the on-campus restaurants).  There also was, three or four years ago, a staff counselor who was murdered by a mentally disturbed student she'd been counseling. That took place off campus.  Car break-ins do happen, but those happen literally everywhere. That's why police set up those towers in mall parking lots now. Broken glass is usually a sign of a bumper cruncher where somebody's headlight or taillight got taken out. Not to say it doesn't happen that someone occasionally breaks into a car, but it's not all that common.  Now, off campus is a different matter. Students who walk off campus at night do get robbed occasionally, although even that is not very common. So, no, what you're saying is pretty much completely wrong.  As for your last point, security is highly diligent about keeping outsiders off campus. I know these things for a fact. Crime can happen anywhere, and some does at UTA, but as long as you don't leave your laptop and backpack out when you go to the bathroom, you have very, very little to worry about (unless you're a female who gets drunk at parties, and then there's a minuscule chance you'll get raped). The last two major ""crime waves"" were the serial butt-slapper who did run-by butt slappings of three women (true story), and the guys who kept driving up to students and asking to use their iPhones, then driving off when the students handed them over! This fear mongering is silly."

Dallas,3dgc38,dallasdude,9,Fri Jul 17 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"Arlington has had gang problems for at least 25 years-- school gangs, Aryan, Mexican, black, Vietnamese you name it they have it. I grew up there and watched as the city and police allowed a once-idyllic middle class neighborhood into a crime-ridden shithole. Crime ran rampant thanks to gangs and an apathetic police force more interested in taking steroids than curbing crime. They let gangs and Section 8 apartments crater the area and run the schools into the ground. Almost every single family in the neighborhood eventually moved elsewhere. It's very sad, and the city deserves better. Anyone who thinks the narco and administration won't act because it might hurt crime statistics needs a wake-up call."
Dallas,3dgc38,Joxemiarretxe,4,Thu Jul 16 21:50:11 2015 UTC,I know you mentioned Section 8 housing-- what's your solution for low-income living?
Dallas,3dgc38,dallasdude,12,Thu Jul 16 13:41:40 2015 UTC,"I have no idea but I do know those apartments sounded like the fourth of July every night from the gunshots. The schools, once bastions of excellence, became shells of their former selves besieged by apathetic parents and drug dealing ten year olds (I wish I were kidding about that). I don't have the answers for what to do, but I know what I saw, and it was enough to make me know that when the projects go up or the apartments go Section 8 that it's time to get the heck out of dodge.  Arlington isn't alone. Check out Richardson in the area just NE of Abrahms and 635, where a pretty middle class neighborhood has been absolutely besieged by projects and crime. Those folks wouldn't send their kids to those schools if their lives depended on it. And I can't blame them. It's a gorgeous modest neighborhood surrounded by a nightmare with the 2nd highest crime rate in Dallas.  People work really hard for decades, from elementary school on through high school, college or vocational training, and for years at their jobs, just to put themselves in a position to make a living with the hopes of one day buying a modest home in a middle class neighborhood. And they don't deserve to have the government take a giant dump on their heads with a housing project with skels that buy drugs instead of feeding their kids, and apparently in some places with a police department that willingly lets it happen. I don't know what to do with those people. And obviously there are lots of hardworking great people in those projects too, but there are too many who aren't. And that's especially shitty for all the good people trying to make a better life for themselves and legitimately using housing vouchers etc as a means to do so. They feel the brunt of this more than anyone since they lack the means to evade the nightmare. Government doesn't have an answer for it. I don't know who does. It is a complicated decades-long mess of failed public policy encompassing everything from benefit administration to mass incarceration and evisceration of the two-parent family unit."

Dallas,3dgc38,lexdiamondzz,10,Thu Jul 16 19:30:51 2015 UTC,"I honestly think the bigger picture here is the fact that an FBI agent was lying in bed with the Aryan Brotherhood and was leaking information which lead to a ""hit"" on Arlington Police Officer Balson. Literally only a small portion of the article was about low level gangs, CSB on Gillon Drive, yet I'm sure most of the comments on here will be about street gang activity. We already have a guy ranting about Section 8 when the majority of the article focused on a high ranking drug lord who's most likely not going to be lurking around low income housing. The article even states he was running drugs out of a neighborhood in which a Citizen-On-Patrol lived on, which most likely wasn't a Section 8 property.  Baldemar Solis is the real star of this piece. It boggles my mind that there's intel showing that he may be living in the very city that was leading the investigation on him only a few years prior. All because every case that mentions his name is brushed off so far into oblivion that APD won't even acknowledge it. Does that not bother anyone else? Maybe some of these informants were correct in stating that the Aryan Brotherhood do have people on the inside. If they were able to lure a federal agent into working for them, what other moles do they have running around local pd?"

Dallas,3dgc38,lexdiamondzz,6,Fri Jul 17 03:38:02 2015 UTC,"It gets very interesting after page 2. The part about gang activity in Arlington was only there to show the reader that APD will back down from any controversy which may shed bad publicity on the city thus hurting revenue from tourism. If a street gang like CSB can roam freely on Gillon Drive without any consequences, APD sure as hell won't acknowledge a drug lord living in their vicinity. At least I hope that's why they wouldn't give chase to a guy who repeatedly attempted to have one of their own officers murdered."

Without fail, then as soon as you start giving your order, because she just asked for it, she immediately interrupts you and says, ""for here or to go?"" and you answer her.

I know what I want and to make it really simple I dined in. One patron there was very indecisive & took her sweet time at the register. Finally I placed my order and waited for a good 20 min. During that, a couple of women (one we will call bitch with a body & the other was her fat friend) came in. Its one of those situations where the skinny and trying to be pretty bitch needs to have someone less pretty than her to hang around with. Bitch with a body was also indecisive on what to get. When the cashier was waiting on them to place an order, I had to get up and tell her that I dont have much time to wait on them to make something simple but in a courteous manner. Bitch with a body turned around at me and straight up ""uh customer service, do you know what that is?"" Me ""sure"" Bitch ""you are being a prick I was here first"" Me "" no lady I was and have been for the past 25 min"". She went on pretty much trying to berate me, I almost had to start video recording when she step toward me. Her fat friend looked embarrassed and the cashier finally got my food and apologized.

Seems that people who don't even live in the community are forcing this on a people who don't want it. Understood?  Maybe one could find a Muslin enclave in North Texas and build a titty bar? Would that be ok?
Dallas,3dfd83,superfahd,4,Thu Jul 16 03:36:22 2015 UTC,It's a cemetery. The only Muslims in it will be dead. At that point does it even matter what religious affiliation it holds? Would you be ok with a Christian cemetery instead?
Dallas,3dfd83,chantistar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:14:24 2015 UTC,i don't live in that county but my guess would be if they even wanted a cemetery built there it should be christian because that's what all those folks probably are. would a muslim community want a christian cemetery in their midst? most likely not.
Dallas,3dfd83,superfahd,2,Thu Jul 16 14:38:51 2015 UTC,Why not? I see Christian cemeteries right up against some neighborhoods that I know have a sizable Muslim population. I've also seen Mosques and Churches in the same blocks and I personally know of mosques that have a good working relationship with those churches. I don't see why a Muslim 'community' would have any issues with a mere cemetery

Dallas,3dfd83,mogulermade,2,Thu Jul 16 15:10:28 2015 UTC,"""They are doing something I don't like here, let's do something they don't like there"", is the logic employed by the uneducated and simple.  It's the intellectual equivalent of ""my dad can beat up your dad"".  Note, I'm not talking about the point you're making... I'm talking about the air you are making your point with.   I'll look past it, as I'm hopeful that you are overly emotional, and your response to this post will hold higher value than that statement.  Now to your point.  There is no ""Muslin(sic) enclave"".  There isn't a 'little middle east' community.  They are spread out and mixed in. Muslims are here, with us, among us.  They are your cashier, your lawyer, your school bus driver.  They were born here.  They pay taxes, and participate in the democratic.  Most are fiercely patriotic to the US.  Yet, there is nothing those people can do to 'fit in', because of their skin color, and their beliefs.  Baptists don't battle the Catholics even though their belief systems are extremely divergent.  When is the last time you saw christian vs. buddhist conflict?  It's happened before, but it's not common.  Muslims are peaceful people, but the name has been tarnished by the extreme minority.  It's exactly like public opinion of christians being drawn from the actions of westboro baptist church, or those of the KKK. Yet you advocate that it is okay to discriminate against all muslims, because of the actions of a few.   I realize that you're talking about community and the communities right to influence what is done in and around the land that they own.  But their fears and concerns are rooted in racism and bigotry.  To defend their choices is to condone that racism and bigotry.  Nobody is 'forcing' anything on anyone.  There is a process for things like this.  Elected officials will make the call, not random voices on the internet.  Hopefully they aren't as small minded and juvinile as some of the comments I've been reading here."

Today you can play video games with other players all over the world on your Xbox or PS or even from your mobile phone.  Back in the early 90’s, Virtual World Entertainment opened up gaming theme parks that allowed you play Battletech or Red Planet with up to 7 of your friends.  It was nothing short of revolutionary.  They even pioneered site link, enabling you to play with pilots at any of their theme parks around the US.  Dallas had a Virtual World site in the UA Plaza on Park Lane from 1994 to 1996 and it was awesome.  So yea, it is 90’s graphics, but at least respect the legacy and the nostalgia.

Normally conservatives would be up in arms about reductions in the size of the military, but they're currently being distracted by the opposite emotion: suspicion of the military.  It gives a reason for the conservative rank and file to not only accept the drawdown, but to welcome it and even puff up their chests and say they caused it to happen."

Dallas,3dbv29,jleavesl,5,Wed Jul 15 22:16:15 2015 UTC,"I can see how the adapting sector of energy could hurt you really bad, but that's going to happen regardless. Either we're going to run out of fossil fuels eventually or we make renewables cheaper. I don't see how Bernie is going to effect either of those scenarios. The private sector is doing that. Also your kid can just take out loans like me and get some scholarships, my parents never gave me anything growing up so I'm having trouble empathizing.   If anything, Bernie wants to make college affordable for your kids and lower student loan interest rates... I haven't heard a single candidate on the opposing side even talk about student loans (besides Rand but he also wants to end the drug war so he won't win). I guess if you could provide me with some research saying how Bernie will tank the economy I'll believe it, but if you're getting information from opinion pieces then that's no different than me saying he's going to make the economy better cause I think so. Sorry, I come across as an asshole, being a proud liberal Texan does that to people."
Dallas,3dbv29,BawsDaddy,-3,Wed Jul 15 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't see us running out of oil in the near to immediate future.  We've got awhile and as the technology for renewables becomes more cost effective they will eat some of the market share, but I reckon oil is still going to be a pretty chunk of that market.    I'm in a position to help fund my kids education, I think that is something, as a parent, that I should do.  I'm sorry that your parents didn't help with your education but I think that responsible parents should try to do so.   Your perspective changes when you have kids (Obama trying to tax my daughter's 529 fund pretty much negated the possibility of me voting Democrat for quite awhile).    If you take a look at his education bill, it's designed to take .5% of the gross from any stock transaction.  Meaning that if you sell a stock he takes half a percent of whatever the gross value is and then will take another .5% when you spend that money to buy a new stock.  The medical bill he proposed does the same.  So if both policies were enacted, you would lose 2% everytime you changed stocks.    It doesn't sound like a big deal on its face until you start looking a little deeper.  My wife and I put a good chunk of our money away for retirement and all of that money is invested in mutual funds, through our 401ks, IRA's, etc.  My daughter's 529 fund is also pegged to the market.  Mutual funds divest and reinvest their holdings somewhat regularly in an attempt to gain somewhat modest increases in value.  This is going to diminish the rate of return.  I've seen estimates that someone contributing the max to their IRA ($5500) annually will be out roughly a quarter of a million dollars by the time they get to retirement as a result.  So effectively, he's taxing the middle class there.    Now lets go on to how this hurts us.  Sweden tried a similar tax (only .5% not Bernie's cumulative 1% which is higher than any other market near as I can tell) years ago to disastrous results.  Capital fled their markets and the tax revenues were a fraction of what was projected.  30% of their equity moved to other markets. Now, Bernie's proposed tax doubles Sweden's.  I don't think that the ramifications of his plan are a good thing for most of us. It's unlikely that he will generate the desired revenue to pay for his plan, it will hurt a lot of people's retirement plans, and will drive capital away from the US Markets.  I would argue that we'd be better served attempting to drive down the cost of college (which is somewhat ridiculous) as opposed to attacking the stockmarket.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_financial_transaction_tax"
Dallas,3dbv29,jleavesl,2,Wed Jul 15 22:00:15 2015 UTC,"I see your concern with the 2% figure but keep in mind his education bill is attempting to make college free. So instead of spending 100K+ on your kids college he's paying it for you. Keep in mind this is a safety net program. So let's assume you lose you job (worst case scenario), that Roth IRA isn't being funded while his education bill would reassure your child gets an education (arguably more important than money). Keep in mind that Bernie is attempting to appeal to the Americans in financial messes. Right now, many parents don't have Roth IRA's for their children, and so the idea of a free education is going to look much more attractive. The other thing to consider is that this could be paid by alternative means, but because this congress has sold out to special interest, he knows that taxing the wealthy isn't going to happen. It's much easier to scrape off the incompetent middle class than the competent high class. Also, this in no way is going to crash the economy, yes it'll hurt that retirement, but what's the point of retiring in a subpar country surrounded by a bunch of jackasses... I'd like to retire surrounded by an educated public that makes my retirement even cheaper for me because of how smart and innovative they are.   This is the part where we diverge. I'm all for parents paying for their children's life, even after they're technically an adult, but what I've come to discover is a lack of empathy and overall work ethic. Because my parents haven't provided for me after 18, I've developed the knowledge and will to accomplish my own desires while many of my friends have not. They find themselves living with their parents at age 25 while I've put myself through college and have worked all the way through. I don't think its healthy to pay for everything your child wants, they need to take ownership and endure suffering so they may appreciate their place in the world. You may provide the privilege of a free education for your children, but they won't appreciate it. They won't understand the value of that education and leverage it for their dreams. But I know you'll disagree with me here, I won't coddle my children, and if they want something I'll say what my father said to me, ""Go get it yourself."" I'm the very definition of bootstraps, I have very little empathy for the privileged.  I'm not trying to convince you of my ideology, I just want you to know that people like me exist, and fight for what we believe in. I believe in Bernie, he's the only candidate that isn't bought and paid for by corporations. That means he's working hard for me. And I love hard workers on my side."
Dallas,3dbv29,BawsDaddy,0,Wed Jul 15 22:21:56 2015 UTC,"It would be the highest tax in any developed market by a long shot and it would devastate the stock market and the retirement plans of  half of the population and would not generate the revenues that he says it would ( http://taxfoundation.org/blog/bernie-sanders-s-financial-transaction-tax-won-t-raise-much-revenue-he-thinks ).  It's been tried and it failed miserably in Sweden and I have no reason to believe it wouldn't fail miserably here too.  Also, crashing the stock market would absolutely hurt the economy.    What's the point of driving old ass cars, living a very modest lifestyle and working long hours at a hundred or so miles away from my family (and sacrificing time with them) in order to get out of the game early, when he's going to punish me for having the foresight to plan for my future in order to give free shit to people who don't.  What's the point of saving if he's just going to punish me for doing it.  I'd like to keep the fruits of my labor and not be punished for being a responsible adult which is exactly what he proposes to do.    My folks helped me out with my schooling, however I've had a job since I was 15.  I've done my bit and pulled 78 hour weeks (I got a half day off on Sundays) for two years.  I bought my house and have spent about 4 years total actually living in it during the 9 that I've owned it because I go where the work is and I work my ass off.  So I don't buy the whole ""if your parent's pay for school you grow up entitled"" thing.    That being said, you aren't wrong.  I get the feeling as though I'm older than you and know quite a few people who failed to launch.  If you are 25 (or in the case of some of my friends, in your 30's) and living on Mom and Dad's dime, you've done something horribly wrong and I'm going to do what I can to ensure that my daughter doesn't grow up with that mentality.  I'm going to buy her first car when she's about 12.  It'll be 500 bucks and not running, but she's going to grow up learning to work on it and if it isn't running when she's 16, then I'll buy her a pair of Nike's.  There's no allowance, there are chores that pay a certain amount.  I spent my childhood mowing sitting on the back of my grandfather's tractor mowing 30 or so acres of land, my Dad has that tractor now and the family has quite a bit of land and I when I sell this house, so will I. I sure as hell appreciate what my parent's did for me, so I don't think that is universal.    However, your argument falls a bit flat with me.  You're arguing that the government paying for someone's education is somehow more noble than me paying for my daughter's.   Somehow a faceless entity paying for her schooling won't make her entitled but if I do it, it will.    I know people like you exist, I used to think like you did.  I've managed to scratch a little bit together for myself and now people like you seem very intent on taking it away from me; you might even say that Bernie Sanders supporters feel entitled to it.  In the unlikely event people don't see through this guy's populist bullshit and actually look at the damage his policies will do, it will be a disaster."

Dallas,3dbv29,BawsDaddy,-7,Wed Jul 15 17:41:17 2015 UTC,"I can agree with you on that.  I just feel Bernie Sanders has spoken on and on about what we need to do, yet he hasn't offered a single economic idea that would do anything for the American people.... In fact he mentioned raising the minimum wage to $15/hr which actually HURTS poor people more than anyone else.. These are the people we need to help."
Dallas,3dbv29,Still_Will91,8,Wed Jul 15 17:44:23 2015 UTC,"Ok, I used to think the same way until a buddy of mine explained it a little differently. So I wanted to take my time to make sure you understood my viewpoint so just bear with me.  The thing about Bernie is that he understands that nothing is wrong with the economy, the economy is hustling and bustling better than ever. Wall street is seeing record highs. My CEO is making 11 million this year, my previous CEO is seeing 50 million this year. Things are fine with the economy as far as Wall Street is concerned.  I'm not quite sure how you get the idea that raising the minimum wage is going to hurt the economy... Here's a fun little article I encourage you to take a look at in your free time.  I have to argue with my friends about minimum wage all the time actually. I worked in retail sales for about 8 years and am now working in IT for a major company. One of the things I tell people is that poor people are typically poor because they aren't smart... Sorry, I know it's not the nicest thing to say but it's true. That's why you go to school to get a better job, you become smart thanks to it and make more money. So the idea that poor people can/will all of a sudden begin to hoard their increase in income (let's assume minimum wage gets raised) is somewhat preposterous. This raise in income will actually flood back into the private sector. Think about it, say I run a UPS Store (I worked there so it's an easy example) and all of a sudden I have to pay my employees double... It's gonna suck right? Well for a little while, but then you're going to start noticing something... More people are coming into your store around the holiday season because they're buying more gifts for their relatives with that increase in income that they got earlier. Well, anytime demand increases what are you going to do as the store owner? RAISE DEM PRICES! Sorry, I get excited when I make money. So now, not only are you getting an increase in customer demand, because your store is the closest in a 10 mile radius, you get to profit off that demand. This is effectively how minimum wage works, thats why Bernie is in favor of it.   Ultimately you have to have faith that the poor (unskilled labor) will live up to their name and put that raise right back into the economy, thus further increasing the flow of money and overall health of the economy in the private sector. Now if you want to talk about hurting the economy, we can talk about CEO's and their off-shore tax havens. These guys effectively make millions a year, remove their money from OUR economy and then leave it there till god knows when... Then they proceed to blame taxes on the inability to bring it on-shore, ""I can't bring my money to the United States because it'll go from 30 million to 20 million!""   I say ""Boohoo"" and a charming ""Bless your heart"" to these assholes. When I've witnessed employees work for a company for 10 plus years and they're capped at $12.50 (I know its not minimum wage but it still fucking sucks) and then a new CEO comes on board making 7 million off the bat, it's a stark juxtaposition of where you are compared to this guy.  Personally I think minimum wage shouldn't even exist, but then that would mean we need executives to implement a decent standard of living on their own. Well why do you think minimum wage got created in the first place? Because executives were not paying their employees a decent living. You see, minimum wage is a result of our inability to empathize with one another... It's a sad side-effect of modern society and it openly tells the world that we aren't capable of making sure everyone is taken care of. It tells me that profits come before human life, and it tells me that there is less love in the world than what I was told growing up.   Sorry to get all sappy on you, but we ARE the greatest country in the world.

Evaporation is a SLOW process that only gets rid of about a quarter of an inch of liquid a day, which translates to about 8 inches a month.   If you have two feet of standing water, it will take three months to evaporate the liquid away, assuming no drainage occurs. So very slow :)"

Dallas,3da0gb,Necoras,9,Tue Jul 14 19:36:19 2015 UTC,Isn't the increased potholes due more to the odd weather we have had?  Seriously asking.
Dallas,3da0gb,Zandt88,11,Tue Jul 14 22:42:58 2015 UTC,"It is, The ground froze solid this winter creating a lot of 'space' in the soil. Now, we had tons of rain that saturated all the soil and causes it to collapse on itself. The 12"" or 24"" slab of concrete about the fallen area is bound to fail eventually.  I'm no biologist and don't even deal with concrete. Just my best attempt at the weird phenomenon."
Dallas,3da0gb,RettyD4,5,Wed Jul 15 02:17:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly why.  Ice makes potholes, lots of them."
Dallas,3da0gb,CeleryStickBeating,2,Wed Jul 15 03:09:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it's not as if the roads were in acceptable condition prior to this past winter."
Dallas,3da0gb,bkharmony,2,Wed Jul 15 16:11:01 2015 UTC,True enough. I was just asking if the significant increase was due to that.
Dallas,3da0gb,Zandt88,5,Wed Jul 15 16:37:09 2015 UTC,It's because the potholes aren't on the fucking toll roads that continue to infiltrate this metroplex.   Especially the fucking variable rate lanes.   Won't see a blemish on those but the roads you pay taxes on go to shit.
Dallas,3da0gb,Ebriate,6,Tue Jul 14 23:02:13 2015 UTC,"Yea because the entire state and local budget in Texas for current road maintenance is about $4B. Meanwhile, the Dallas North Tollway by itself generated $200MM in tolls in 2014. That's 5% of the entire state highway budget. If you want to ride on glorious, smooth, pothole free roads, then get ready to pay for it just like the tollway drivers do."

Dallas,3da0gb,d7rkdude,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:26:02 2015 UTC,"I would love for that to happen, yet its impossible to force the gas tax money into infrastructure only projects.   The money is robbed for other things and the roads sit or become toll roads. Higher taxes aren't the answer unless legislation is in place to assure that the money collected can't be used for anything else.  If not, it's just more pork."
Dallas,3da0gb,Ebriate,2,Wed Jul 15 13:32:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean that's the talking point, but we haven't raised the gas tax since 1991. During that time vehicles have gotten much more fuel efficient, which means more wear and tear with less revenue. For that reason alone we need to raise the tax."
Dallas,3da0gb,d7rkdude,0,Wed Jul 15 14:23:37 2015 UTC,"You can't raise the tax without accountability.   Americans need to be assured with full public disclosure, state by state what every penny is being used for.   Also, electric vehicles need to pay a mileage tax.  This tax should be less expensive than a gasoline tax to be an incentive to use them. The infrastructure deals need to be tracked and made public transportation help curb back room deals with contractors who are huge players in bribes, gerrymandering and campaign contributions. I hear you that the taxes need a small raise, but the money needs to go to its intended infrastructure.   Also, tool roads need to stop splitting the revenue with non American companies. The politicians who take this on see it as political suicide because of negative attack advertising branding them as a tax raiser and that costs votes because people are fucking gullible and stupid."

Why not use some of the 1000 workers we have who are currently paving the lexus lanes (texpress) around town and patch up the holes that approximately 95% of motorists drive over.  Dallas really dissapoints me for how much corporate cock they love to suck.  Look at those lanes when you see business vehicles driving down them and ask yourself, would those businesses lose more money if their drivers were sitting in traffic just like you @ $20/hr.....or would they lose less if they just paid the NTTA a surcharge of $2 instead to move their goods and workers right around that.

Dallas,3d9lkh,DFWPhotoguy,10,Tue Jul 14 20:24:14 2015 UTC,"So, when they came over from 105.3, JD didn't return due to a fallout over a his comments in a story that the Observer (I think) did on Russ during their hiatus. So, the returning crew was Russ, Dan, Trey, Clo, and Alfie (mostly on the phones, though he still contributes). Since then, they've also added their intern Kenzie (I have no idea how she spells it). She started in the first month or two of 2014 and appears a few days every week.  Regular guests are Everett, Dr. Thornton, and Johnny (again, I have no idea how she spells it) the chick who used to appear for Operation Kindness and now Paws in the City.   Big Stacy calls in every once in a while and a couple months ago Big Gay Steven called in for the first time in several years. Billy the Kid has filled in a couple times this year, but that's most of the regular cast unless I'm forgetting someone.

Same thing with Katana.   I just remembered though, that Rob the old producer is indirectly mentioned every once in a while because he is still in contact with Russ. He now does the apocalypse survival prepping stuff. He did appear on the Halloween Special this past year.

Dallas,3da2au,irishamerican,13,Tue Jul 14 17:54:04 2015 UTC,"I hear a lot of people say things like, ""This never happened when I was in school.""  I wonder if it really is happening more now, or if it's that there's so much more in the public eye it's being seen more.  I would not be surprised if this was the sort of thing that used to get hushed up and swept under the rug, rather than make national news.   I actually think it's a combination of both. It seems like (pure gut feeling) more teens are more sexually active than when I was in high school.  Oh sure there were still some, but you sort of knew who was having sex and it was a small amount of the class.  If there was a girl who was even suspected of having sex at all she was called a slut.  Sex, in general, is being more accepted with each generation.  That being said there's no excuse for an adult having sex with underage girls, lock him up."
Dallas,3da2au,PMall,2,Tue Jul 14 19:44:03 2015 UTC,Honestly I think to a certain extent it just gets more attention now. My mom is in her 60s and she told me stories about one of her teachers having sex with a 15 year old class mate. When it got out he was very looked down on but he ended up divorcing his wife and marrying her so in a lot of people's eyes that made it alright.  These days even if they get married 15 is looked on as too young which I agree with.

When I'm hankering for 'just' sushi, I'll usually hit Sushi Wasabi (which is super close to me at Preston/Belt Line) - they brew their own soy, and I've never been disappointed by a meal there. For special occasions, we'll hit Sushi Sake in Richardson (75/Campbell), which provides the most authentic experience I've found in Dallas, or Tei-An downtown, which is an upscale restaurant that absolutely nails every dish I've ever had there."

Dallas,3dc6vr,Bobby6kennedy,2,Wed Jul 15 22:31:23 2015 UTC,"If you want pretty good, and cheap as balls sushi, Kazy's Gourmet.  Not really a restaurant- more of a supplier for a lot of local restaurants. But they have a pretty extensive menu.  Beware: They take forever to complete your order.  Call or fax it in because you're not going to really want to go there for the atmosphere anyways."
Dallas,3dc6vr,Dayreon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:25:52 2015 UTC,"This is definitely my favorite place for sushi anywhere.  It's so quaint, and so cool that they stock a ton of awesome snacks and drinks from Japan.  CC Lemon is so good.  I haven't had the same experience with the food taking as long, though.. maybe I get lucky."

Dallas,3dc6vr,TheGrest,2,Thu Jul 16 20:21:50 2015 UTC,"Tei tei is amazing. You can wear whatever but it's definitely a trendy crowd. If you're solo consider eating in the back bar area. The bartenders are cool.   I highly recommend trying the corn flake shrimp, grilled branzino, yellowtail collar, and Spanish mackerel sashimi (they fry the fish bones for you when you're done). The feed me roll is chefs choice and they make some pretty crazy concoctions sometimes - I find it to be best when seated at the sushi bar and can talk to them. You'll notice a significant difference even with your standard rolls like spicy tuna so don't feel like you have to get their unique stuff.   They also have A5 wagyu steak which is the highest quality available.   Price wise it's not that bad, especially if you don't drink. Just sticking to sushi you won't pay much more than you would at any other decent sushi restaurant."

You do have to go through a basic training course which is essentially basic ways to not hurt yourself using the machines.    Supposedly they have woodworking classes every now and then, but I've not seen any yet.  It's entirely volunteer driven so it's basically whenever someone decides they have a weekend free.  Regardless, it'll get you access to equipment without having to spend thousands.    As far as courses, I think Rockler offers them every now and then."

Dallas,3d9wuz,monkeysthrowpoop,0,Tue Jul 14 19:28:40 2015 UTC,I live in plano. I have no idea where dorba trails are. I also need to find some crappy bikes to use because i dont think i have enough.
Dallas,3d9wuz,monkeysthrowpoop,2,Tue Jul 14 20:00:27 2015 UTC,"http://www.dorba.org/trails.php  They're are Dorba trails all over the dfw.   Plano, arbor hills, has some decent fast 3ish mile trails. Not amazing, but fun and easy. More difficult, boulder, oak cliff nature preserve, Rowlett Creek Nature Preserve, big cedar... Or north Erwin (not terribly difficult)  Google them, they're everywhere."
Dallas,3d9wuz,worksafemonkey,3,Wed Jul 15 01:04:59 2015 UTC,"I went hiking in Arbor Hills Nature Reserve last weekend and it's a very nice paved trail about a mile and a quarter long with some side trails. It's good for about and hour or two if you don;t mind making circles. Also, you can bike or rollerblade but there's a savagely steep hill on both sides."

Dallas,3d94ly,jbrown7815,5,Tue Jul 14 13:48:16 2015 UTC,If you can't provide pay stubs they should contact your employer to verify the offer letter. Your realtor is dumb as this is common practice. I've never had to provide pay stubs and I've always rented from private owners. They have always used a screening company to verify my employment and do a background and credit check. Makes me think they're just pocketing the application fees and putting that process on you. They'll get burned as people fake pay stubs all the time.
Dallas,3d94ly,TheGrest,2,Tue Jul 14 14:19:14 2015 UTC,"It definitely varies from property to property.  Some property management companies require last 3 check stubs or offer letter, but I'm sure that last years w2 could work as well. It all depends on each property. Good luck!"

Dallas,3d94ly,ur6ci124q,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:10:03 2015 UTC,Most places require two recent pay stubs to:  A) Show that you are earning enough money to pay your rent  B) Show that you have a job and don't plan on using their house as a drug den  This varies from renter to renter but I'm sure if you come from money and are going to school full-time (or something similar) you can find a house to rent without providing pay stubs.

There's isn't much other than Starbucks (one at Buckner/Garland Rd. and one at Garland/Gaston) or White Rock Coffee's drive-through stand at Mockingbird/Abrams, for coffee.

Dallas,3d87tr,K3B1N,3,Tue Jul 14 12:32:34 2015 UTC,Is 20 feet better than Alligator Cafe?
Dallas,3d87tr,ExCruceLeo,3,Tue Jul 14 14:35:16 2015 UTC,they're different. 20 Feet is more like east coast seafood joint. Alligator Cafe is cajun food.  Also 20 feet has the best lobster rolls I've had in Dallas. ( expensive though )
Dallas,3d87tr,msixtwofive,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:29:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, dinner for two at 20 Feet will set you back $30 with no alcohol (you can bring your own, just not from Good Friend).  I'm a big fan of their fried Oyster Po Boy as well."

Only regret is that it takes us so long to try new places.  Coffee shop: White Rock Coffee on NW Hwy (close to Easton Rd) is fantastic. My husband is a coffee drinker and I'm a tea drinker and they have something for both of us. If we go through the drive thru with our pug he always gets a dog treat as well. Cultivar is also delicious with a bonus of sharing space with Good 2 Go Taco which is delicious.   Cafes/Restaurants: Alligator Cafe at Casa Linda has delicious cajun food and live music.  Tony's Pizza and Pasta on NW Hwy and Easton Rd is VERY inexpensive but the food is great quality. It can get busy so feel free to order take-out. I recommend the tortellini bolognese. So good! Hypnotic Donuts on Garland Rd has some good stuff for breakfast. Chubby's on NW Hwy has some good breakfast. Go 4 It Sports bar on NW Hwy and Plano Rd also has good food and is a great place to catch the game.   Stores: There is a small sweet shop that opened recently called Haute Patisserie which has tarts, macarons, cakes, cookies, etc. It is really good and owned and run by some people that were on a food network competition show. There is a consignment shop called Top Drawer that has some pretty cool mid century modern stuff from time to time.  Feel free to ask any other questions! PM or reply. I love it here."

We have been attempting to find his home on craigs list and facebook but no one has claimed him. Seems to be full grown adult dutch dwarf.  He is litter box trained, super friendly and likes to lay in my lap for petting time. He is also very pissed off about living in a dog kennel without access to the rest of the house due to our large Rhodesian Ridgeback dogs. He needs a home where he can be a house bunny, its clear he is used to having space to run around and play.  Since we cant find his original owner we are on the hunt now for a permanent home for him. With our dogs he just cant ever be happy with us and he needs to go to a bunny safe environment. Currently he is living with us in Denton, we can meet someone anyplace in the DFW area if you can provide him with a good home."

There are a lot of homeless people that wander around, a lot of prostitutes that also walk the streets, a lot of drug dealers that hang around the parking lots. All of these people may approach you in and around that area. Don't interact with them, politely decline their services. There are a ton of car break ins and home break ins. I suggest you get a big, bad ass dog or two, a car alarm, and security system for your home. Also, you will be directly under the flight path for Love Field, get used to the noise.  Other than all that, there are a lot of good restaurants in the area. UPtown is not far, Highland park shopping is not far."

I don't know anything specific about that area south of Love Field other than it's never felt like a good area when I've driven through.  Now that's not based on anything that gut feeling from seeing some of the neighborhoods with houses and landscapes that aren't kept up very well.   When I see a house that looks like it's falling down with a brand new BMW in the driveway I can't help but think drug dealer.

Dallas,3d0usb,thewordwalker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:00:11 2015 UTC,UberX is cheapest and is everyday drivers in their cars. UberXL is the same just a bigger vehicle (and more expensive). Uber Select is a nicer/newer vehicle with a driver that must maintain a minimum star rating that is higher than UberX. Uber is a black car. Uber Black car also has an SUV service.  These were listed in order of price. Uber is most useful for people who live/work/play in an urban environment like downtown since UberX is $4 to all the hotspots without surge.

I didn't report it as there was little damage, and I don't want it to mess with my insurance... They are going to need two doors, and all I got was some scuffs and paint on my bumper. It always happens to me when I am in or near a low income area. I got a roof rack and louder horns in an attempt to make myself more visible. If you are looking for a dashcam get a G1W-c as it uses a capacitor instead of a battery.

Movers change crews on a very frequent basis, so one good review and one bad review from the same company can totally happen.   Ask a lot of questions of the crew that will be sent and be very detailed about your location, how much stuff you have and where you're moving to. Do they do washer and dryer hook ups, do they charge hourly or by the box, are you paying them if they take lunch during the move. Ask if they're insured and what their claims process is like.  Ask if they use blankets, do they own their own truck, etc."

I thought I would be getting at least 50-60. Any help/info regarding that matter?   I don't know what NA is... but as a network engineer, I can help interpret a traceroute if you like.  Dallas is a major Internet hub... mostly being out of 1950 N Stemmons and 2323 Bryan.  Most ISPs have backbone connectivity from Dallas to LA, Chicago, Denver, and Atlanta.  Latency is determined by the actual distance the packet travels (speed of light through fiber + delays in conversions to electrical and then some processing) plus queueing delays.  The queueing delays occur due to congestion... and that can be intermittent and completely based upon the ISPs in the path.  If you are stuck with an ISP that has congested peers or has poor peering where traffic is backhauled to San Jose or NY just to reach another server in Dallas, that can be fixed in some cases by using a VPN to help force routing across other paths."

Dallas,3cx0zr,UnknownQTY,4,Sat Jul 11 16:49:49 2015 UTC,How could anyone hate him?
Dallas,3cx0zr,Laz3rfac3,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:05:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but I always see people bitching. I always assume it's younger chefs who are jealous it's him and not them."
Dallas,3cx0zr,UnknownQTY,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:14:41 2015 UTC,The difference between him and the jealous young chefs is that Anthony knew when to kick the coke habit.

Dallas,3cx0zr,sonnuvabitch,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:41:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's because, even though he's a really great writer, and he's funny and witty and somewhat charming, he talks a LOT of shit about other chefs- and not just the famous ones. That's not really cool, especially since he's not really known for his cooking skills. All cooks- from executive chefs to line cooks- rarely get weekends or holidays off, work long, shitty hours, and get paid very little. Most of them do it because they are passionate about it. But it's grueling and hot and sweaty and you rarely get health insurance or 401ks and are pretty much at the mercy of the restaurant owner. It can be soul crushing at times. Which is why so many cooks tend to end up with drug or alcohol problems. I just think maybe Anthony Bourdain could do a little more building up, and less tearing down. He's a handsome, cool looking dude, tho, I can see why people are so enamored of him. ESPECIALLY young chefs. He's the main one who has catapulted the idea of chefs into rock star type status- just without the budget."
Dallas,3cx0zr,VioletNewstead,-2,Sun Jul 12 04:17:03 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he's great in person, but especially on his CNN shows he comes off as a blow-hard curmudgeon."
Dallas,3cx0zr,RIPDeepEllum,2,Sat Jul 11 18:49:19 2015 UTC,"The CNN show is much more current events focused than his other programs. I love it, but not as much as No Reservations. That show seemed like he had...less reservations, you might say."
Dallas,3cx0zr,Leofan7,2,Sat Jul 11 19:39:46 2015 UTC,"I must be thinking of The Layover on Travel Channel where he gets his old man on something fierce, because Parts Unknown isn't as bad."
Dallas,3cx0zr,RIPDeepEllum,4,Sat Jul 11 21:01:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah The Layover isn't his best work, but if you enjoy the ""My Celebrity life is better than your life"" it's fine.  After getting trapped in Beirut he said everything had to change, the fluffy food TV stuff had to evolve, which is what led to Parts Unknown.  Overall, I give folks like Anthony Bourdain a LOT of leeway, they are just normal folks that ended up famous. Honestly I would say he has stayed a lot more grounded then some of his peers..."
Dallas,3cx0zr,CinomedTweak,2,Sat Jul 11 21:20:53 2015 UTC,"After getting trapped in Beirut he said everything had to change, the fluffy food TV stuff had to evolve, which is what led to Parts Unknown.

Dallas,3cx0zr,doctorclockwork,9,Sat Jul 11 15:00:51 2015 UTC,He's on a book tour. Did a talk at the DMA.
Dallas,3cx0zr,ur6ci124q,6,Sat Jul 11 15:46:13 2015 UTC,Did he actually do a Dallas episode or did he just stop here on his tour?
Dallas,3cx0zr,greedygrove,2,Sat Jul 11 15:14:47 2015 UTC,He just stopped for the tour. During the Q&A he was asked about doing an episode & he said there isnt a plan to do one.
Dallas,3cx0zr,GREGORIOtheLION,0,Sat Jul 11 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"He could do a big special in Dallas, where he eats at Chili's, Applebee's, and the Cheesecake Factory."

Dallas,3czli3,atbayacal,3,Sun Jul 12 05:35:02 2015 UTC,"As a motorcyclist who constantly searches for good roads: to be completely honest, there's not really anything near here in terms of scenery. Go up to somewhere like the nature reserves/boulder ""mountains"" outside of Lawton Oklahoma for that, there's nothing good within 100 miles of Plano. Source: I live in Plano.   The closest thing you'll get is by the  airport in McKinney... Take 75 up to University and follow that to the race trac that typically has motorcycles parked our front of it on weekends and hang a right.   If you're looking for twisties, you moved to the wrong city. Closest real twisties are down in Austin. Oh and the tracks here suck too (bad pavement and drainage), but they're better than nothing. COTA is good, but far and expensive."
Dallas,3czli3,Mirrory,3,Sun Jul 12 05:51:32 2015 UTC,Man I ride as well and I completely agree with what your saying. The roads here suck balls. But there are some really nice twistys near Mansfield. Oh and check out motorcycleroads.com
Dallas,3czli3,immaswerve,5,Sun Jul 12 06:49:48 2015 UTC,"So you don't like FM455, FM697, FM1377, FM2862? They're not really scenic but they're close and not too shabby.  FM677 on the Fort Worth side is pretty good, so is FM4 if you're really going far.  The area around Granbury and Glen Rose are fairly scenic, at least compared to DFW.  And since the OP is in a car:  you might want to check out a day trip to far Eastern Oklahoma and Mena, Arkansas area.  Very pretty, it's doable on a bike in a 12 hour day but without AC it's a bit of a drain.  In a car though, easy."
Dallas,3czli3,Tenroh_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:02:17 2015 UTC,I would describe those roads as 'ok' or 'meh'. They don't even come close to the roads that were in LA or San Diego and to me aren't worth the trip unless I'm very bored.
Dallas,3czli3,Mirrory,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:38:49 2015 UTC,"Damn, so what you're saying is, I'm out of luck?  What are the airport roads like?"
Dallas,3czli3,Mirrory,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:07:47 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you moved here recently. Yes, the roads are straight and grid like here for an 80 mile radius around Plano.   The roads by the McKinney airport have slight curves to them. A few good ones, but they can be full of gravel, horse/cow shit, and have huge ripples/warpage to them (like a foot in some spots). So be careful and take it easy the first pass through, and watch out for tractors ;D  To give you an idea, I've gone 140 through some of the turns when no one was around and wasn't even close to even needing to hang off the bike or get a knee down.    If you're expecting twisties similar to what exist in other states you're best off going to Austin or Oklahoma.    The crappy roads are one of the main reasons I cannot stand living here after 2 years. Drives me nuts heh. But I always laugh when I see a sports car here. I guess they like racing my commuter toyota in bumper to bumper traffic on the 75. Not really any reason to own a sportscar or superbike out here. Off roading though? Shit that's what's kept me sane. Shitty truck or dirt bike + field = fun"
Dallas,3czli3,RIPDeepEllum,3,Sun Jul 12 06:16:00 2015 UTC,"Prepare to be disappointed. Texas is sparse for pretty driving, but I will say that the Canyon Sweep and Davis Mountain Loop in west Texas are really great."

There are some studios in downtown but the hours can be odd. It might be toasty out, but to be honest your best bet on that area is just walking around downtown."
Dallas,3cyf8r,LoserInBoston,12,Sat Jul 11 22:26:09 2015 UTC,It looks like the dealership should have taken care of this based on this NTTA article: http://enews.ntta.org/DrivingForward/May2012/TollTagQA_DF_MAY12  Ugh. I'll definitely name them if I find out they're to blame
Dallas,3cyf8r,TyGreeny,10,Sat Jul 11 22:46:47 2015 UTC,I sell cars. We are supposed to remove and destroy plates but sometimes people are lazy and it doesn't happen. The dealer should reimburse you for the tolls; my dealership would.
Dallas,3cyf8r,cfreak2399,6,Sat Jul 11 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"Go to NTTA, show them the paperwork that the car was sold. They'll remove the tolls.  EDIT: Since you can't go in person. Call them. You can probably fax them the paperwork.  / has happened to me twice."
Dallas,3cyf8r,Divadane,3,Sun Jul 12 01:20:25 2015 UTC,This happened to me awhile back.  I was able to send documentation via email and got it cleared.   I am not sure you can still appeal via email but check the ntta website
Dallas,3cyf8r,underwater_bimbo,2,Sun Jul 12 02:31:03 2015 UTC,"If the title transfer, or a release of title , was filed with the county, NTTA can actually verify those records. All you need to do is call them. It's happened to me twice since moving to Texas."
Dallas,3cyf8r,Paradox1989,6,Sun Jul 12 07:29:14 2015 UTC,"I had this happen, sold my wifes minivan and the dirtbag never registered it. 9 months go by and  i start getting letters about paying outstanding tolls. Luckily i filed my VTR-346 (Texas Motor Vehicle Transfer Notification) form notifying the state that I sold the vehicle. Called up NTTA told them that, they looked it up found the filing date and said no problem, i wouldn't get a notice again.... Never did either.  The bad part though was the dirtbag was also racking upo red light camera tickets in Haltom City. Called them and they didn't give a fuck that they showed on record that the vehicle had been sold. pretty much point blank told me that until he registered the vehicle I was responsible for fines it acquired. Told them where to stick it and the response was ""Well just put a notice on it so it can't be registered until the fine is paid"", go ahead be my guest.   My takeaway from all this is that i WILL NEVER sell another vehicle with the tags on it. I don't care if i registered it a week before the sale, the buyer will not be tooling around the town on tags that have my name associated with them."
Dallas,3cyf8r,shittin_glitter,5,Sun Jul 12 06:08:26 2015 UTC,There was a story on the news last night about something similar...lemme find it.

Dallas,3cyf8r,DFWPunk,2,Sat Jul 11 22:36:23 2015 UTC,Yeah thanks. I'm surprised the plates are still around though. I thought those generally get destroyed. Maybe someone stole the plates.
Dallas,3cyf8r,Kar98_Byf42,2,Sat Jul 11 22:40:18 2015 UTC,"No, they stay with the car a lot of the time."
Dallas,3cyf8r,Milnoch,-2,Sun Jul 12 01:13:32 2015 UTC,Plates are supposed to stay with the car.
Dallas,3cyf8r,DFWPunk,2,Sun Jul 12 17:25:37 2015 UTC,"Wrong.  In Texas there is no law that says plates stay with the car.  Historically people have just done this as the DMV/Tax Office is perfectly willing to transfer a plate to a new owner along with transferring the title at no cost.  However in the last few years the guidelines from the state has changed.  It's now recommend that you keep your plates (pay $5 to transfer them to your next vehicle) or destroy them.  You also should remove the registration sticker at the same time.  Removing the plates effectively forces the new buyer to title/register the car in their name and stops the possibility of toll charges, red light tickets, and parking tickets."
Dallas,3cyf8r,whiskeyjane45,3,Mon Jul 13 16:30:22 2015 UTC,Just call the NTTA. It's no big deal.

We had to call a few more times but after about 2 years the bills quit showing up. Good luck."

Our plans are usually ANYTHING IN AIR CONDITIONING.  History - Courthouse Museum, JFK 6th floor Museum, Holocaust Museum, Dallas Art Museum are really good.  Dallas World Aquarium as well.  The new George W Bush Library/Museum is a quick drive north of downtown.  The Reunion Tower has Five Sixty restaurant by Wolfgang Puck, bar, and observation deck if you want to see the city from above.  Food/Dining - check out the Uptown/McKinney Avenue area, there are many good restaurants and bars.  Sports - FC Dallas has a match Thursday evening far north of Dallas (it is outdoors and 30-60 minute minute drive from Downtown) but Rangers Baseball is out of town and it is out of season for Mavericks, Stars, and the Cowboys.  There are tours of the billion dollar Dallas Cowboys AT&T Stadium every day of the week - http://attstadium.com/tours/tourInfo.cfm  Big name concerts - Wednesday: Smashing Pumpkins, Marylin Manson, Barenaked Ladies Friday: Imagine Dragons"

The rough riders have the nicest minor league facility that I've been to. You can park at ikea and walk over for free. Sit on the third base side to be in the shade.   There is a Hutchins bbq in downtown Frisco if you wanted to mix Bbq and baseball in one day. Depending on where you're staying, it might be a bit of a long drive and be forewarned that Frisco is suburbia (great for those of us with families, crappy for those that want to go out and party)."

I'd be tempted to go from wf to Amarillo, then up to Walsenburg, CO. Take 160 through Durango to the 4 corners and Mesa Verde. Then cut over on the smaller highways to the south rim (looks like 160 to just east of the grand Canyon)."
Dallas,3czct1,mechinginir,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:12:49 2015 UTC,Okey. That might be a plan. I'll check the route in google maps. Why would you take this route instead? Because of the landscape?
Dallas,3czct1,Khroneflakes,2,Sun Jul 12 18:15:40 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Blowing through NM on I40 is faster, but it's not very scenic IMO.  If you've not been to the US, going a few hours out of the way to go see the Rockies is worth it.  The southern part, the San Juans, are nice and the roads (I take 160 to ski nearly every year) are well maintained.  Going to Mesa Verde (see the cave dwellings) and the 4 corners will also get you another state (Utah).  My wife actually suggested that from the grand canyon, that you go back north into Utah and go through Zion national park and hoover dam on the way to Las Vegas.  Honestly, there are a lot of great things about the US and in my opinion, our national park system, especially in the west, is one of the best.    If you're making the trip through the southwestern US, and can afford the time and fuel ($2.59/gal here right now) make the most of the miles."
Dallas,3czct1,woohooreddit,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"Okei. sounds like a good plan. I'll have a look on the map and see how long it takes to drive that route.   $2.59/gal? That's actually really cheap if you compare it to Norwegian prices. It's about $6.8/gal here now, if I did the math right. We use liters, and it's about $1.9 per liter, and 3.7 liters in a gallon."
Dallas,3czct1,crestind,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:21:17 2015 UTC,You did the math right... It was cheaper a couple weeks ago and I assume with the lowering of the price of crude it will go down again in a month. Remember it is pulled from the ground and refined within 200 miles of Dallas.

Really though it's all about riding any random dirt road you find around here and leaving before the cops show up or anyone notices. It's never exactly clear what land is public and what isn't. If they actually have a no trespass sign up, don't ignore it and turn around. Also watch out for horses. Don't be a dick and blip the throttle and give them lots of room.

Dallas,3cxixb,watsonsass,2,Sat Jul 11 17:43:01 2015 UTC,"When I have out of town visitors I take them to FTW to see the Water Gardens, The Stockyards, dinner at Jose T's.  In Dallas I take them to the Arboretum, Fountain Place, Pioneer Plaza and the Nasher, dinner somewhere in Bishop's Arts.  Most likely you'll be staying near the stadium which will put you in the middle of both."
Dallas,3cxixb,txholdup,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:48:30 2015 UTC,"I personally would NOT stay near the stadium.  Arlington does not have a lot to offer IMO aside from the game itself.  Pick either FW or Dallas.  Lots more night life, restaurants, and things to do.   If it were me I'd choose Dallas.  Hey it's a Dallas subreddit and that is my bias:)   You don't list your age, your interests, or anything else so it's hard to give any more detailed advice.  But if it were me I'd stay in uptown at Hotel Za Za.  You are extremely close to Deep Ellum, uptown, Klyde Warren Park, and downtown.  You have the trolley close by, a lot of things are walkable, and if you use Uber you can get to plenty of things in a short time."

Dallas,3cxros,Maoatu,3,Sun Jul 12 02:46:19 2015 UTC,"Look, if you want your proposal to be memorable it's one thing, if you want to get it done, that's another. Since it's not a surprise and you're nervous already, I'd suggested just getting it done. Here's what you are going for: #1 meaningful words, #2 romantic location that she'd be proud to tell her most judgmental friends. When you or she tells the story, those will be the highlights.  Find a place that is fairly private to take her. It doesn't have to be totally private, but you know, a balcony with a great view, a park that is basically deserted, an overlook, a museum during off hours, etc. Make it a surprise, but not that much of a surprise...she'll want to look nice and the tension can heighten the moment. You could tell her something like you want to go on a proper date.   Alternately, carry the ring around for a while and wait for something like this to happen naturally, but be forewarned...this could take a while.   Get on your knee, and say something short, sappy, and memorable. If you aren't absolutely certain, be very conventional. Pop question, hug, kiss, text people. Bring something to celebrate with, like champagne, a picnic, or something else special. Don't go to a movie or play, make that day about the two of you...not watching other people.  Bonus points if you can get a souvenir of the location, like a print of the picture you proposed in front of, or a poster of the building or park. Keep that gift idea for later.  Also, if you're anything like me, it will be very hard to speak, so practice what you're going to say beforehand."

While I don't really believe she has a strong argument on why the greater population should marry young, instead it just seems it worked for her in this particular case. You can't tell someone when to fall in love. I do like how she talks about her relationship as a cornerstone and not a capstone. While I'm not married yet, I do believe my girlfriend is the one who helped me graduate and get my college degree. I did not have to be married to get this done though, I just had to know that she and my future family with her was my inspiration. My girlfriend and I are not going to let a number impact our decision on when we should and shouldn't get married, it really doesn't matter to either of us. Thanks for posting the article :-)"

This is the TABC with its own police force, which raids bars — where couples are dancing slow to jukeboxes — because they don't have dancehall licenses.

That would be like a narcotics officer smoking weed to prove that he was dealt it from someone. We're not talking about undercover narcotics agent though. TABC agent are subject to state laws including removing liquor from the premise. Esting operations aren't official TABC coming in to test bottles,  which is within their right, they are moving small samples shading into seperate containers with no witnesses to test back at the lab. No confirmation with bartender/servers that they even heard their orders correctly. It'd be very easy for an inexperienced server to mix up Redbreast 12 and 15, or even Bombay and Bombay Sapphire."

There's currently no money in the budget for these improvements but I identified the project as something that will make a huge impact immediately. We're not just adding a few signs or replacing a few letters. The plan is to removed most of the old, outdated/broken signs and replace with new structural posts and weather-resistant panels. We're not being extravagant with the design, but the overall number of signs for both the outdoor gardens and indoor areas (like the chapel) add up in cost. All the design time will be donated, and funds will go toward fabrication/installation. Our initial budget was determined from the concept plan and a few signage professionals providing estimates based on seeing the space."

So, when the federal government was seen as tyrannical by the southern states, he decided to fight for the honor of Virginia because of the belief he had in the principles of the founding fathers - abolishing a government that is tyrannical.    This is exactly what the founding fathers would have done, and did do. The only reason you call him a traitor is because he was on the losing side.

Dude was a model citizen, never owned slaves, was against slavery, fought for black civil rights both before and after the civil war, was a member of a black civil rights group.

I ask because he held onto the slaves he inherited for several years even though it was willed that they should be emancipated, and he even fought the matter in court to hold onto them. About the soldiers, the slaves that fought were still slaves. The owners had to consent as well, and most of them didn't. Wanting them to volunteer and be treated as equals was a practical matter.

The rationale behind allowing motorcycles to use HOV lanes is that it is safer to keep two-wheeled vehicles moving than to have them travel in start-and-stop traffic conditions.

Dallas,3cudgg,Rebalanced,2,Mon Jul 13 14:43:10 2015 UTC,That's true. If the windows are all the way down and you park in the shade a few minutes shouldn't hurt. You must have a very well trained dog to be able to trust him to stay in the car without supervision.

Try waiting for movies to come out on Nexflix and go see a show or any of the hundreds of stuff going on in Dallas.

We have literally hundreds of events for next week in our app.  From free or cheap improv (just as good as Second City!!!) at Dallas Comedy House to free shows at Sundown and The Rustic.  And while I'm on my soapbox, there is this seriously cool thing going on called Shakespear in the Bar.  Some great local actors doing....obviously Sharkespear for FREE.  I just don't want to see one more Gypsy Tea Room or any number of great Dallas institutions going under because they can't people out to see a show.

Dallas,3clrlj,nomi1030,102,Wed Jul 8 22:09:31 2015 UTC,"A couple of years ago my son and I met a guy at Mockingbird and 75 to buy a phone. We were driving around looking for parking but couldn't enter the parking lot there at that corner, because a Cop had his car blocking the entry. There were about 4 cars behind him waiting for him to move, but he just sat there. After a few minutes I got out and asked him if he cold move up just a little so we could get in. He cussed at me and told me to mind my own fucking business, he would move when he wanted.   Apparently When he wanted turned out to be about 2 minutes later. He moved, and the line of cars was able to get in.  So we bought the phone, then went and got back in the car.   As we were about to back out, my 12 year old noticed the cop parked about 50 yards away and watching us. I pulled out and drove towards the exit and we turned onto the frontage road and headed down towards lower Dallas.   That cop followed me for 45 minutes, matching every turn I made. I called DPD 4 times and asked to speak to a Supervisor. I was told that he was probably just patrolling in his normal area and it was a coincidence.  I finally pulled into another parking lot and sat there. The cop pulled into an empty lot across the street, and just sat there watching us.   Finally he took off, but I am positive that if I had made any mistake at all in driving, we would have been pulled over and ticketed.  To this day my son gets nervous when he sees a cop anywhere around us.   As an ex-military policeman, I understand a lot of the stresses that job puts on you. Its tough. However, I have not had a decent interaction with a Policeman in any form in years. Where I used to trust and respect them, I now fear them."
Dallas,3clrlj,tuck4x4,40,Thu Jul 9 00:52:27 2015 UTC,"A cop did something similar to me just a couple days ago. Nothing to the extent of your experience. He followed me for 15 minutes. I made sure to follow every traffic law. People were speeding past me, but he kept following me. My initial ""offense""? I used my blinker and got in front of him (he was probably a good 4-5 car lengths behind).   Last year I got a ticket for crossing double white lines slightly early to get over to the ultra short on ramp. Why? Because I dared to look at a cop in the eyes as he drove past.  I haven't had a decent interaction in years either -- there was an article on Reddit about cops being terrorists. Hyperbole, for sure, but I can't stop thinking about that. Every time I see a cop, I should be thinking ""great, I'm safe,"" but what I really think is ""oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit."" Both of these incidents were near/on 75.  ETA: grammar"
Dallas,3clrlj,xmastaflex,8,Thu Jul 9 02:04:24 2015 UTC,A college friend (probably 30 years ago now) saw a female state trooper and thought it was great so he waved as he went by.

The only tickets Ive received in the last decade were related to an expired Inspection sticker. I was laid off, on unemployment, and i thought that paying my child support was more important than having my car inspected.  I use Sir and Ma'am,... because Im ex-military, and it stuck. If Im doing something wrong by communicating in such a way that I trigger a ""Im a badass"" response from policemen, I don't know what it is.   Now, you commented that Im probably doing something to deserve the attitude I get.  Did you read my post? What is your opinion on that?"
Dallas,3clrlj,tuck4x4,-2,Thu Jul 9 15:47:12 2015 UTC,"If Im doing something wrong by communicating in such a way that I trigger a ""Im a badass"" response from policemen, I don't know what it is.   While in an ideal world, cops could be friendly and kind to everyone they encounter, this is not that world. From your above comment, the way you described your interaction made it sound like you were trying to direct the officers behavior.   While you might respond that you were only employing social pressure by framing it as a request, succumbing to pressure of any kind is exactly what cops are trained to resist. This cop in particular took his overreaction way too far, and should be disciplined for his unprofessional behavior. However, to answer your implied question, I'm guessing there was a disconnect between your intended communication, and the communication he actually received.  (It should be noted that while doing cop stuff, police officers can generally park when and where they choose, without regard to inconvenience for others.)"
Dallas,3clrlj,Tsilent_Tsunami,6,Thu Jul 9 16:23:39 2015 UTC,"I feel that this is entirely wrong. Police are people, and they are employees, and their motto is to protect and to serve.   To Serve.  They are not supposed to carry themselves around like bouncers. They are supposed to be approachable. If I have a request I should not get harassed for putting it forward.   Your comment makes it sound like a cop is entitled to react differently to conversation. Because he is a cop, an average human being should not converse with him in a normal manner, but should treat with him as if he were superhuman.   Sorry, again, I was an Air Force Policeman for 6 years and acting like that was never part of our training.   Heres an anecdote that explains how I feel about this:  When I was in boot camp, my unit had 3 Drill Instructors. 2 of them yelled and screamed and cussed and hit us. Every other Drill Instructor I saw on my training base acted the same.  But Sgt. Rios did not. Sgt. Rios was a Master Trainer. He had a blue rope on his smokey the bear hat that showed he was better than all of them. And I never once heard him cuss or yell. Instead he would tell us how disappointed he was with us, and make us do it again.  A week after I graduated I bumped into him and I asked him why he was different.  ""I was never trained to cuss and yell. At no time in Drill Instructor Training do we have a cuss and yell class. We are trained to train, and to advise and to guide. All of those other Instructors have got it in their heads that that is the way they are supposed to act. They have made the decision to act like asses, and it comes from something inside them."""

Had my car searched numerous times and everything tossed on the side of the road and left to get all my shit back in on the side of a busy highway because officer snoopy pants thought he smelled weed. Never smoked anything in my life. I am a saint on the road, don't speed, follow laws and rules. I still get pulled over occasionally. For what? I think they're just bored."
Dallas,3clrlj,Zermus,3,Thu Jul 9 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"You don't have to submit to those searches you know.  I've had dozens of officers want to search my car and never had it searched once.  When I was younger I was very proud of my car and there was no fucking way I was going to let joe dirt sheriff tear my shit up because he ""thought he smelled something"".    Each time they could never give me a valid reason to search.  It was always something like ""I believe"" or ""I think"".  If they want to do that they need a warrant.  They can't search your car on a hunch, only with a warrant, visible evidence of something illegal they can point out to you, or with your approval which they seem to manipulate out of everyone who doesn't actually know Texas law.  They have to prove that they see something like a gun handle sticking out.  All you have to do is refuse the search.  If they say they smell weed, just keep denying them the search and ask for a supervisor.  If they keep insisting, tell them to point it out to you from outside your vehicle and if they can't then it's a hunch, refuse and ask for a supervisor and keep asking over and over if you're being detained or not.  You may even want to throw in how your perceived ""detainment"", whether they want to call it that or not, is costing you money, because that is illegal in itself on their part.  It may take a few hours, but I'd gladly trade that few hours for the damage they would do in those searches."
Dallas,3clrlj,Zermus,2,Thu Jul 9 15:04:58 2015 UTC,"I'll give you that and I agree. Dallas and Carrollton, and I would even throw in Richardson because they seem to be reforming, are some of the local PDs that are light years ahead of protecting and actually serving the public instead of trying to rule them with fear and terror. They seem to forget these days that they are supposed to serve us, not vice versa. Granted I don't really ""interact"" with the police like I used to in my hell raising younger days of the 90s and 2000s since I'm married with a family now. =] I will say that actually knowing the law (most of the time better than the officers do) has saved my ass more times than I can count.

The only ""attack on faith"" here is coming from within the Episcopal church itself. The bishop is defying disagrees with the churches' national governing body. That is why it's taking heat. It is part of a long-running debate on homosexuality within the Episcopal church, where some churches have even broke away from the General Convention over conflicting views."

Our legal system protects religious beliefs (as it should), just as it prevents people from imposing their religious beliefs upon others. I understand how Christians perceive they are somehow losing ground, but the idea that there is a war upon them is just their way to describe a general disdain that the law no longer enforces their ability to impose a belief system upon others.   While certainly some people desire to end organized religion, I think ""gays"" just wanted certain legal rights, where arguments against such rights had little legal basis."

Dallas,3cl7r2,BeebopMcGee,4,Wed Jul 8 19:48:57 2015 UTC,I say the Wilson building should add an addition to the top of their property once Headington has completed construction. This will then block Headington's upper floor east facing windows (if any). Then the ultimate downtown pissing match will commence!
Dallas,3cl7r2,johnthedrunk,3,Thu Jul 9 11:23:10 2015 UTC,The City of Dallas needs to step in and limit the height of the building to match the recently demoed building.   And get rid of that stupid fucking eyeball and astroturf.

Dallas,3cm24x,HearForBear,2,Wed Jul 8 23:32:29 2015 UTC,"I lived in the Davis Building from December 2005 to March 2010.  Don't know how much rent is these days.  Pets are allowed but there really isn't a spot nearby to let them do their business.  They used to have a gravel area on the roof of the parking garage but it was really nasty.  The closest green space is Belo Park on Griffin and Main, maybe a block or so away.  This building doesn't have much in the way of amenities.  There is a grill on the roof, a very small swimming pool and a cabana you can supposedly reserve.  They do have storage units in the deep basement, I think each apartment gets a free one, maybe 5x5ft.  In the basement, there is a fitness center.  Here are the good things I remember:   Building is ~100 years old and has very nice terrazzo flooring.  There's lots of character, especially if you go deep in the basement and look at the old bank vaults. Elevators are very close to the apartments. Layout is what I call a soft loft; very little open room definitions and not a whole lot of doors   Bad things:   Building is ~100 years old.  Due to historic constraints, windows are single pane and don't do much in the way of noise isolation or insulation.  When it rains, be sure to have plenty of buckets and towels handy to contain leaking water.  I lived on the West side, apt 703 and there was a waterfall in my apartment every time it rained. The 3 story building (1301 Main) next to the Davis Building has an enormous bank of air conditioners on the roof.  Due to the aforementioned single pane windows, you will hear them drone on 24 hours a day.  Tried filing a noise complaint with the City of Dallas but that got nowhere.  There's a building across the street (1217 Main) that has an open air party space on the roof.  When I lived there, they played loud dance music every night until 2am.  Currently the building is being renovated, so who knows what the future holds. Attached parking garage is absolutely dreadful.  The only entrance to the apartment building is on the 9th floor and there is no reserved/secured parking area for residents.  Said entrance is usually littered with dog excrement, so watch your step. God help you if there is a popular event in Downtown, you may not have a place to park.  I don't believe they have every cleaned the garage so it's extremely filthy.  When preparing to leave the garage, be prepared to wait a while as the payment kiosk is usually broken or non-residents are unable to figure out how to pay.  Honestly if I had known about this, I would have never moved in. There is usually dog excrement in the hallways, so be sure to watch your step. Management is extremely slow to take action so God help you if you have a maintenance problem or a bad neighbor.  There is always a problem with a broken door that takes weeks to resolve. There is no on-site concierge or security.  If you need to pick up a package, you need to do so during leasing office hours.   I currently live in the Third Rail Lofts next door (1407 Main) and things are much much better."
Dallas,3cm24x,la_fortezza,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:01:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for going so in depth! Hows Third Rail with pets? Also, is it set up very industrial like the Davis Building? Thats one of the main things that drew me towards the Davis building, I love the industrial setup."
Dallas,3cm24x,la_fortezza,3,Thu Jul 9 02:32:16 2015 UTC,"I've lived in the Third Rail lofts for 5 years now.  There are a few minor annoyances but it's the best apartment complex I've lived in.  The place is pricey, I pay $1.60/sqft; but that includes parking.  Pet situation is much better.  On the 9th floor there is a terrace that has a dog park.  It's a 20x20' piece of astroturf that drains and it's regularly cleaned.  Amenities are much nicer.  On the 9th floor of 1407 Main, there is a cafe and a fitness center.  Outdoors on the 9th floor is a terrace that connects 1407 Main, 1414 Elm and the Gulf States building.  On this terrace is a mid-sized salt water swimming pool, jacuzzi, gril, fire pit and the place is nicely landscaped.  In the basement of the Gulf States building is a 2 lane bowling alley and a pool table.  In the basement of 1414 Elm is a party room, movie theatre, and some storage units (that are rather pricey, $100/mo for 4x4').  Concierge is available M-F from noon-9pm and noon-5pm on weekends.    Pros of 1407 Main (1414 Elm and Gulf States are older buildings and have different configurations)   Building built in 2006 I think. Most floors have 12 foot ceilings.  17th floor has 20ft ceilings I believe. Floor to ceiling windows.  Windows are double paned which really cuts down on outside noise and helps with insulation. Concrete floors Still a loft, but rooms are more defined and there are more doors. Apartments start at 9th floor.  Floors 2-8 are for parking.  (Not true for Gulf States or 1414 Elm) Responsive maintenance crew. Building is relatively small so elevators are close by. Secured parking for residents.  Garage is regularly power washed. Building is smoke-free.   Cons:   Building is LEEDS compliant which means low flow shower heads and very small water heaters. Management lacks a spine.  When I first moved in, I had a neighbor who smoked so much pot that I got a contact high.  The other neighbor cranked his stereo all the time.  Management did nothing.  Finally these two punks moved out but I got a new neighbor with incessant barking dogs. Concierge quality has gone down in recent years. Reserved parking not available. Resident Elevator in 1407 Main building only stops at 1-2 and 7-16 floors.  If you park on 3-6, you can try your luck with the freight elevator but chances are it's reserved.  There is a non-resident elevator but it only serves 1-6. Light switches tend to be in awkward places, typically near the front door. Thermostat is in a weird place. Concrete floors always appear dirty. Concrete floors can be a bit noisy at times. Window sills are metal and can sometimes carry sounds from other units"
Dallas,3cm24x,WillR,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:18:16 2015 UTC,"be prepared to wait a while as the payment kiosk is usually broken or non-residents are unable to figure out how to pay.   Also, when you leave the garage on Sunday, don't be surprised to see the exit gate arm broken off by some drunk guy who couldn't figure out the unmanned payment kiosk after 18 Jaeger bombs at Plush, but was determined to drive home anyway.  Also, also, vomit.  So many of the aforementioned drunks barfed in that garage.  The thin windows versus rooftop party space situation at Davis Building wasn't that bad (or maybe I was just lucky being on the side that faced Main street instead of the club.  It was infinitely better than at Interurban. (I moved from Davis to Interurban in 2008 because the rent was going up at Davis.  It was a mistake.)  The outdoor club on top of the DP&L parking garage was closer and the windows were even less soundproof."

Dallas,3cbc8n,CallMeRamrod,-2,Mon Jul 6 20:40:11 2015 UTC,"The only thing on there that isn't tex mex would be the peas.. and they're just something added to guac.  I guess black beans are more southwest than tex mex, but it's not much of a stretch.    I'd definitely describe it as tex mex.  Seeing as tex mex is literally a fusion of mexican and american foods."
Dallas,3cbc8n,Mikerk,12,Mon Jul 6 21:06:39 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that tex mex is actually a specific subset of fusion cuisine. You can't really just fuse any Mexican ingredients with any American food and call it tex mex.  The ingredients used in the OP are often used in tex mex cooking (well, most of them), but just using those ingredients doesn't make something tex mex."
Dallas,3cbc8n,NotClever,2,Mon Jul 6 21:23:48 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but it goes both ways.

Rather the ingredients on the pancakes are ingredients you would see in tex mex.    Which is why they would be called tex mex pancakes  Corn, pico, chiles, guac, caramelized onions, potatoes..  yea those are tex mex.  To an extent the beans are too, but I'd say more southwest.  The peas definitely not, but they're just an additive to guac."

Dallas,3cgbq5,StoneyThrashez,5,Wed Jul 8 22:35:56 2015 UTC,Depends what part of plano but they are both close to get around if 75 (central expressway it takes you back and forth) isnt so congested.

Dallas,3cgbq5,StoneyThrashez,2,Tue Jul 7 19:25:26 2015 UTC,"Not exactly but you have to catch 75 at a good time to get to anywhere quick. Whenever its congested, I would take hillcrest rd going up or down if you are west of 75, greenville ave if you are on the east side. Everyone takes the major highways but not realize that smaller streets can get you there about the same time if not earlier."

Dallas,3cgbq5,hobiedallas,7,Tue Jul 7 20:36:29 2015 UTC,"Arguably better than Plano honestly. Richardson scores just as high with far, far lower income/initial education. There is no appreciable difference in RISD/PISD for 'average' to 'above average' kids."
Dallas,3cgbq5,BeebopMcGee,2,Tue Jul 7 22:18:03 2015 UTC,Really? That's great. Maybe I don't have to move to Plano after all once kids happen.
Dallas,3cgbq5,DFWFTW,4,Tue Jul 7 22:20:15 2015 UTC,Not to far but if you are traveling from Plano to Dallas you will run into traffic in the morning and afternoon. If you go from Dallas to Plano it's not that bad. Most people live in the suburbs and work in the city.

West Plano (nearer the dallas north tollway) would probably be an easier drive into downtown than the East side of Plano (closer to 75).

Dallas,3cgbq5,Scorevath,3,Tue Jul 7 18:30:44 2015 UTC,I live on the south edge of Plano off George Bush Turnpike and I work in North Dallas off 635 and it's a 15 minute commute during rush hour. If you guys got a place in North Dallas the drive would probably be doable for both of you.

Dallas,3cfxdo,meechy318,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"Probably not a good idea for a big group as it would get pretty expensive but I took a handful of us over to the DFW gun club. Rented a bunch of full auto weapons and we spent the afternoon blowing through obscene amounts of ammo. That was several years ago when ammo was much cheaper though.  We didn't feel the need to go get drunk or do any of the traditional/sterotypical bachelor party shenanigans. This actually worked out very well, and everyone had fun.  We thought about doing one of the Nascar driving experiences at Texas Motor Speedway as well, but guns won out. He ended up doing the Nascar thing a couple years later on holiday though, and said it was a lot of fun."
Dallas,3cfxdo,Sneezer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:55:34 2015 UTC,"Check out local gun ranges that will rent rifles, pistols, shotguns, and their fully automatic brethren.  I'd go in the morning before drinking and not show up reeking of booze from the night before."

I have no direct experience with this, but when my aunt passed away, her services were held at Restland Funeral Home.  They have multiple rooms for private viewings as well as a chapel that was large enough for our extended family.

Dallas,3cb5qo,GlitterPonyCo,9,Tue Jul 7 02:11:28 2015 UTC,For more information see this article at Unvisited Dallas. Elbert may have gotten his idea from the Texas Tollway Authority because in 1955 work began on the Dallas–Fort Worth Turnpike which is now part of I-30 and was the state's first toll road when completed in 1957.
Dallas,3cb5qo,BrosephJohnson,0,Mon Jul 6 15:18:00 2015 UTC,"Wait, why arent they still collecting tolls on this road like all of the other rip off banker highways around town?"
Dallas,3cb5qo,mgbgtv8,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:29:24 2015 UTC,They might be if Fort Worth hadn't sued to keep Dallas from extending the tolls to cover expanding the turnpike when the bonds were paid off in 1977.

Dallas,3cd49k,ur6ci124q,5,Tue Jul 7 00:35:32 2015 UTC,"If you do Eureka Springs, there's tons of stuff around there.   For outdoorsy stuff, look into Hawksbill Crag, Hammerschmidt Falls, the Eye of the Needle, and Liles Falls which are about 45 miles SE.  For architectural stuff, Eureka Springs has the Thorncrown Chapel and a few Queen Anne mansions. The towns of Bentonville/Rodgers/Fayetteville (to the west) has the Mildred B. Cooper chapel and Hunt chapel (same architect as Thorncrown), Crystal Bridges, Tanyard Creek with rope bridges on its trails, and the benefits of being a college town.  The Ozarks are pretty incredible just by themselves without necessary destinations. I backpacked through there over Thanksgiving a few years ago. Amazing."

Dallas,3cd49k,startled_pistorius,6,Tue Jul 7 01:31:51 2015 UTC,the 'small highway' speed limit in Louisiana is 55 and I've gotten a ticket every damn time I tried going that way.
Dallas,3cd49k,Adip0se,9,Tue Jul 7 11:34:07 2015 UTC,"I don't get why people think taking the small highways would be better than the freeway. The speed limit is lower, you've got a higher chance of getting stopped by cops if you do speed, and you have to deal with stop signs/lights as well as more traffic in the smaller towns you run across.  It wouldn't be a shortcut if it was actually faster. It would be the way."

It's not Texas but it's within 6 hours, and it's a beautiful, incredibly clear lake within a national forest. It's fantastic for camping and boating, if that's your thing.   *Edit to add that it's free to camp on any of the islands in the lake, or at least it was when I was last there, so you don't have to stick to the paid, sometimes crowded campsite if you like to rough it a little more."

Dallas,3cbush,gl1tchy,8,Mon Jul 6 18:24:06 2015 UTC,Wonder if this was in the actual lake or the creek below the lake? The creek area off the Santa Fe Trail near The Lot restaurant has some homeless camps in it with a rough looking woman or two mixed in there.  A lot of people were down around the spillway for the 4th of July.
Dallas,3cbush,ttracker1,2,Mon Jul 6 19:14:49 2015 UTC,I drove by the lake today and noticed that both the lake and creek were very full. The QuikTrip and Lakeview Liquor do attract a number of homeless folks.

The one place I have experienced issues with the IRS is in dealing with hold times, and other issues that occur due to a lack of staffing. Since of course it is almost impossible for the IRS to get additional funding to hire more people, we are just kind of stuck with that bit."

Said he was going to call the sheriff to come and arrest me unless I went to the bank and withdraw all my money and wire it to him. He even wanted me to take my cell phone with me and keep him on the line while I did it. Caller ID said the call was from San Francisco. I hope nobody falls for this.
Dallas,3cb54a,chezyt,4,Mon Jul 6 16:25:36 2015 UTC,I got one of these calls and freaked out. They left me a voicemail but the reference number was cut off at the beginning of the message.

Call the fraud dept and report them. Hopefully with enough info and numbers they can shutdown some of these ridiculous scams.

Dallas,3cckny,FruitSpikeAndMoon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:59:11 2015 UTC,"There are several new med schools opening up in Texas in the next few years. In a lot of ways, it's a lagging indicator of population growth in the state - existing schools see enough demand at satellite campuses and clinics to spin off new med schools.  Is it a big deal for DFW? Well, both UTSW's MD school and UNT's DO school each have ~230 seats per year for a total of 460+, so adding 60 more is nice but isn't earth-shattering. Moreover, medical education in the US involves residency after med school, so if we're concerned about where doctors are likely to end up for the long run, residency spots are a bigger deal.  At the end of the day, only 1/3 of students who apply to med school get in to even one of the schools to which they apply. The students at the 34th percentile of applicants are still typically smart, qualified people who would make good doctors if only we'd train them. So, I'd say the more the merrier."
Dallas,3cckny,legendia,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:47:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  That helps put this news into perspective.  As you said, nothing 'earth-shattering', but every little bit does count and 60 more seats per year for this school is certainly a welcome addition to the metroplex."

Dallas,3ccbxa,biosehnsucht,2,Mon Jul 6 20:54:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would be perfect for that! It takes a lot of work to convert it but it's definitely worth it. We went with a new model like this because it just has so much more capabilities for newer upgrades like electronics, wifi, etc. The old Greyhound coaches are super cool and retro on the outside but it would take a lot more work fit it out on the inside."
Dallas,3ce7o2,sax-and-the-city,2,Tue Jul 7 05:40:15 2015 UTC,"Living in desoto, your choices are fairly limited about eating ""local.""  I also live in desoto (Beltline+Hampton) and the only place in town that you can sit down and have a beer are wingstop, on the border, and outback steakhouse. All of which have piss poor service and sub-par food. Your best bet is to travel up to oak cliff/dallas. And as far as not having a car, you are pretty much screwed on that front. A taxi ride to and from dallas would cost an arm and a leg. You might be able to catch an uber ride for $40 round trip. DART is really the most economical route. Find the closest bus stop near your apartment and ride to the dartrail station over in oak cliff."

Dallas,3cdcwe,mpchaplin,3,Tue Jul 7 03:27:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't live downtown exactly, but I did live in Deep Ellum for a couple of years. I loved it! The building was unique and our loft apartment was beautiful. There are also not too many residents in Deep Ellum and downtown, but the residents that are there are usually older, professional folks. I also have a small dog, but our old loft (Futura lofts) had a nice grassy area across the street, so no trouble there.   The big plus for me was my commute. I work at UTSW, just west of downtown, so I simply commuted on the train about a half hour each way.  There are also lots of restaurants and events always going on. Tons of music venues a walk away made it easy to stumble home a couple of blocks rather than grabbing a cab or Uber. We ended up leaving due to a huge increase in rent, but would have loved to stay in the area!"

I would say that Farmers Branch, Carrollton and Mesquite are probably more than a 20 min drive with traffic. I live in Lakewood and work east of downtown (8 miles) and it takes me 30 min.   If I remember correctly, the Heights is pretty eclectic. You may want to look into Lower Greenville (booming with new restaurants, shops) or Oak Cliff (prices are climbing, but may definitely find new build). Good luck!"
Dallas,3cd37b,priscillavalerie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:16:35 2015 UTC,"Lower Greenville is probably your best bet neighborhood-wise; but you're going to have trouble finding a newer place in your price range.

Dallas,3cd37b,FreakingEthan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:45:43 2015 UTC,"15 to 20 minute commute time in Dallas is means you're looking for something in a sub 10 mile radius from your work (and probably a bit less than that since that's my travel time counter traffic).  As others have said talk with a realtor they can help.  And don't expect a newer home within your commute time.  Homes in that price range are going to be in East Dallas and maybe west out around Love Field. Places north are probably to expensive, you don't want to go south."

Dallas,3cccpe,SayWhatIsABigW,3,Mon Jul 6 23:02:40 2015 UTC,"The last time a story like this was posted it turned out the journalist stated that the whole town was up in arms about this exercise. The truth was that it was approximately 200 people some who were from other states and were all your typical conspiracy theorists. Of course for a military operation like this, they are going to come out of the wood works. The journalist also used blogs and personal websites as his sources for what the ""citizens"" of Bastrop thought. He also tried to skew it in a way that Abbott (don't downvote me /r/dallas, I only said his name) did not support Jade Helm 15 and was purposefully trying to usurp President Obama's plans in Bastrop by planting Texas State Guards . When you read the letter it said nothing more than he FULLY supports this operation and was placing personnel there to quell any issues before they arose.  Again in this article, with no sources or citations to what the author is claiming, is drumming up issues that aren't really there. 150 people showed up to protest in a town of 80k plus. How many are from out of state and part of the conspiracy theorists crowd?   You got a quote from the ex-mayor giving his opinion on this issue, which MAY or MAY NOT have bias. The current mayor giving his opinion which MAY or MAY NOT have bias. But you have nothing A chairman who is probably just documenting everything his is required to from the protestors. Ted Cruz blathering his normal stupid shit, and Abbot saying nothing but sending a few Texas State Guards.   So what are you embarrassed about? It's more embarrassing that this qualifies as news."

You can also check out places like Insync Exotics Big Cat Rescue, The Heard Museum, Bat World MidCities, The DFW Wildlife Coalition, The Blackland Prairie Raptor Center, and other animal related places. They will have opportunities to either help with animals or help with interaction with the public, depending on your preferences. Where exactly are you located? That can help narrow down options.

Dallas,3ca0rn,manBEARpig03,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:05:47 2015 UTC,I'd go with ATT.  I've had Charter before and had a really bad experience.  I switched to ATT and never have had trouble.

I had at&t before, sucked so bad, their router sucked so I used my own & it still sucked as far as range and speed. Since going back to twc I see they have gotten better in terms of speed and reliability."
Dallas,3ca0rn,StoneyThrashez,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:06:52 2015 UTC,No experience with charter.  I've had Uverse at my house and use it at an apartment often. Never had an issue with speed. Stream Netflix all day long. AT&T as corrupt as they are like to give out discounts to keep your business. TWC wants to charge you $7-$9 a month to use their modem. Uverse you get it for free and it does wireless. TWC does allow to buy and use your own though so you don't have to pay per month.
Dallas,3ca0rn,nomnomnompizza,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:27:22 2015 UTC,You can alternatively buy your own DOCSIS 3 cable modem on Amazon for about $40 used and easily marginalize their ridiculous lease fee in the first few months.
Dallas,3ca0rn,blakepilot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:05:03 2015 UTC,"I had TWC, but it was absolutely fucking garbage. Then we switched AT&T, which is EVEN WORSE. Holy shit. We paid for like 30 mbps and got no more than 30.   I'm with SuddenLink now, and we get 75 mbps for less than the price of AT&T, but the problem is that it's inconsistent. One hour, we're getting 5 mbps, the next hour 75, and the next, 30. It's frustrating."

Dallas,3c3srd,txholdup,2,Sat Jul 4 15:13:45 2015 UTC,There usually are several at the intersection of Bridgefarmer Road and 380.  Essentially you need to be in an unincorporated area to buy them or shoot them off.  I used to live in Lowry Crossing on the 4th we would just picnic on my front lawn and watch all the neighbors shoot off fireworks for hours.

Nelsons Fireworks is a chain of Black Cat affiliated stores around town. They have a website. There's also Alamo Fireworks which have less superstores and more mom and pop booths selling their merch. The mom and pops are good for discounts but their inventory is hit or miss, especially on days like today because they want to sell everything they have before midnight.   The superstores aren't flexible on their pricing, but have a lot more options and people are really familiar with what the fireworks look like and can make good recommendations."

Dallas,3c4adj,phewforaminutethere,2,Mon Jul 6 18:47:44 2015 UTC,It really depends on what you have to sell. If you are just looking to unload terrible 90s CD's that no one wants anymore (like Creed or something) then that stuff is worth about what HPB will give you.   If you have rare CDs and rare LPs those are actually worth selling for a decent amount. Discogs is a good resource and CDWarehouse in Arlington on Cooper st. Is a good place to check out. It's right by UTA.

Dallas,3c33y7,jonatzin,11,Sat Jul 4 08:18:43 2015 UTC,"I went to this year's WM as my first WM (From the Bay Area, so natural to come home), but live here, so let me make some suggestions:   Which city should I stay in? The event is in the AT&T stadium and I don't know if I should be renting a car. I'm fine with using public transport (not sure how it is compared to over here in NL).   This is tough to say without knowing where the other events are going to be.  I assume you'll go to WM Axxess, right?  We had a blast at Axxess, I met Paige and got a pic and autograph with her and there was an NXT ring and we watched the tourney to decide who gets into the WM Battle Royal standing only 20 feet away from the ring.  Fun stuff.  Also, I'm guessing you might be interesting in attending NXT, right? The NXT show at WM in San Jose was fantastic, one of the highlights of the weekend.  Also, you want to go to HOF Ceremony, right?  That was just okay for me.  Long story short, we don't know where those WM weekend events will be, but it's a safe, calculated bet that they will be on the Dallas side. I would expect HOF ceremony to be at the American Airlines Center in Downtown Dallas.  I would expect Axxess to be at a Downtown Dallas hotel.  Finally, NXT is a bit of a wildcard.  I could see them being in Dallas.  But also Frisco (Dr. Pepper Arena) or Allen (Allen Events Center).  So if all the side events are in Dallas/Dallas area (Dallas area means east of DFW airport), and only WM is in Arlington, you should consider staying in Dallas.  If you do though, you'll need to get a ride over to/from WM at AT&T Stadium.  Public transportation from Dallas isn't terribly convenient (The train that runs between Dallas and FW, the TRE, famously doesn't run on Sundays), so you might rent or compare the cost of renting a car vs. what an uber or lyft would cost you.  You can use uber/lyft fare estimators to get a sense of cost.  If you've never used those services, they usually have a free credit of $25 for new customers.  Assuming your wife hasn't either and is going to WM, you use your new customer credit going there, she uses it on the way back.   Depending on which city I will be staying in, what area should I stay in? Not sure if the wife will join me or not, but if she does probably something with nice restaurants/bars/parks/things to see/do would be great.   Downtown, near American Airlines Center.  Easy access to likely Axxess (lol) venue and likely HOF venue.  Plenty of restaurants/bars/parks.   What's in the best way of getting around? Public transport vs. Cabs?   Other than going to AT&T Stadium, if we are talking about going to places on the Dallas side, public transport in the form of the DART light rail is a great way to get around, especially if you stay at a downtown hotel. Day passes for DART (which includes light rail and their bus service) is $5.  You can also take DART light rail from/to DFW Airport.   How much money are we talking about here (tickets and hotels aside) ?   What are we talking about if we are not talking about tickets to events and hotel costs?   Transportation would be rental car or uber/lyft charges + DART $5/day for day passes.  If you go somewhere that is not walking distance from your hotel or a DART rail station, you may have to combine DART rail and uber/lyft/cab to get there.  Food is really hard to estimate.  Food at the events (incl Axxess/NXT/HOF) is your typical expensive concession food.  Food around town varies.  Try to find a hotel that has free breakfast to knock that out.  Then, assuming 2 meals a day (and let's say both meals are not concession stand food), you could budget anywhere from $20/day to sky's the limit  per person.  Maybe be on the safe side and budget $40/day for food?  As far as attractions, that depends on what you want to see.  I'll defer to others that can you tell you about what to see/do in Dallas.  IMHO, Dallas is not a great city for tourists/sightseeing.  Please don't downvote me for that Dallas redditors.  Hope this helps.  If you have specific followup questions, I'll try to answer too."
Dallas,3c33y7,SharksFan4Lifee,3,Sat Jul 4 12:43:27 2015 UTC,"I think Axxess will be at the convention center. TNA used UT Arlington's basketball arena for slammiversary in the past, I think WWE would use, SMU UTA or UNT maybe even TCU basketball arenas for NXT."
Dallas,3c33y7,FCDallasBurn,2,Sat Jul 4 14:21:38 2015 UTC,"Duh, you're right, Axxess will likely be at the convention center.  As to NXT, again, I wouldn't assume anything would be on the FW side other than WM itself.  As we all know, when big sports events occur at AT&T Stadium/Ballpark at Arlington (Super Bowl, All star games, etc.), most (if not all) ancillary events occur in Dallas."

Dallas,3c33y7,SharksFan4Lifee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:32:45 2015 UTC,Ft Worth had events but they were not as big as the ones in Dallas. I really can't see NXT being in Allen. Allen seems too far north to do an event. UTA has hosted one of TNA's biggest PPV twice. The only problem with the Dr Pepper Arena is the the corner seats aren't completely removable
Dallas,3c33y7,FCDallasBurn,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"Not in Allen could be right, but I still think it's more likely to be on the Dallas side than FW side.

Raw after mania was at SAP Center (Shark Tank), downtown SJ. All 10 min walk from each other max. HOF was also at SAP Center. The NXT show was Fri night at 10pm so people could enjoy Axxess and then walk over to SJSU for the NXT show and not miss a thing.  WM was Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, about 10-15 miles away."

This might be a loaded question :-)"
Dallas,3c33y7,SharksFan4Lifee,2,Sat Jul 4 14:28:45 2015 UTC,"what's the uptown vs downtown situation   There's lots of bars and young people uptown.  For bars, I could see you going to uptown, but I feel like you'll be mostly downtown (or where WWE events are).  Personal safety won't be much of an issue in the places you go.  Dallas has its crime like any other city, but where you will be, you'll be fine.  Still though, take the same precautions you would for any big city.  For BBQ, opinions here vary like crazy.  I'd say Pecan Lodge and Lockhart's Smokehouse."

Dallas,3byacr,DB_McGee,5,Fri Jul 3 15:15:29 2015 UTC,"Bank fishing or boat fishing?  Bank fishing you can occasionally get bass, sunfish, catfish, crappie. Boat gives you a lot more options.  The obvious spot is whiterock, or any of the other larger lakes. Otherwise, just google maps and look for any blue areas and then go try to find them. Even most of the small ponds are stocked pretty frequently (or frequently enough that they breed and keep up stock), including ones in residential areas.   There's a pond behind the In-n-out in Allen off Stacy rd that is usually good if you're in that area."
Dallas,3byacr,scsibusfault,2,Fri Jul 3 06:12:05 2015 UTC,"Really depends on the kind of fishing you do. If you like catch and release and enjoy fishing for catfish, I recommend Plano East High School. There is also bass in there but the cat fishing is really good."

There's a bench under a tree and right under the tree in the water is a great spot to catch cats. That sounds vague but it's a small pond and  there aren't many trees so it's easy to find. They'll bite night crawlers like crazy. My wife and I just bobber fish there. Feel free to PM me if you have more questions."

Dallas,3bxrve,RIPDeepEllum,14,Fri Jul 3 01:04:17 2015 UTC,"In defense of income inequality. One of the things that makes DFW different than other metro is that DFW is comprised of 50 different cities, each with their own government and tax structure, and often their own school district.  The Big cities are saddled with big city problems and crappy school districts, but in DFW it's easy to escape those issues by choosing one of the better run suburbs."
Dallas,3bxrve,LegoMovieExtra,2,Fri Jul 3 02:50:06 2015 UTC,How does that make DFW different from ANY other metro?
Dallas,3bxrve,ORDDFW,-1,Fri Jul 3 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"DFW has a lot more suburbs than other metros where the major city is much larger.  Texas is different because the different cities rule themselves instead of relying on the state for local services.  DFW suburbs are designed around income inequality.  The suburbs go to great lengths to discourage apartments and encourage more affluent developments.  Suburbs are built around school districts, where in other states you have county controlled schools."
Dallas,3bxrve,LegoMovieExtra,-3,Fri Jul 3 18:58:25 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Chicago and LA each have over 200 suburbs, each with their own government and tax structure.

Dallas,3bxrve,ORDDFW,-1,Fri Jul 3 21:43:44 2015 UTC,I don't blame them for discouraging apartments.

Dallas,3bxrve,LegoMovieExtra,2,Fri Jul 3 13:53:54 2015 UTC,I don't understand what you mean by fix. Insane amounts of hard work and achievement lead to financial success.

Dallas,3bxrve,ask_me_later,0,Fri Jul 3 12:51:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, and it's important to remember that school districts are not apolitical and absolute, timeless structures, they are formed out of and continue to represent existing class and race relations within a given area. The early success of a place like Highland Park was absolutely linked to discrimination, white flight, and the advantages of being white in the time of Jim Crow. Time has smoothed this over to where it seems like a place like HP has worked hard for its reputation, when in fact it was only initially successful due to systematic inequality. Looking at the disparity today between school districts, it should be obvious that there are still significant problems in class and race relations in Dallas, but I don't know how to fix it either. I don't think any progress will happen as long as we continue to ignore this though"

Dallas,3bxrve,ask_me_later,6,Sat Jul 4 18:22:56 2015 UTC,"Stated reason:   the area’s extremely low average wages for poor communities, along with a regional education system that trails other parts of the country.   I think a few things need to be taken into consideration:   Dallas has a huge employment market and tons of available jobs are out their for skilled workers We are close to ground zero for immigration from our souther neighbors and such wide disparity should be expected in large immigrant zones, they flock here for a better chance Gentrification is in full effect as the city is simple running out of space, this is good for poor home owners who can get far more for their property than they ever could and great for the city as the Tax basis rises (2.91% in some areas...) People harp on our education system a lot, but there are a lot of things that are right about it. Sure it has it's problems but our education system has nothing to do with the disparity in pay. Take a look at the demographics of students in the education system in Dallas now. It's majority first generation central americans. Their parents didn't magically move here with educations, they are here to give their kids a better education.  There are plenty of alternatives, the DFW metroplex is huge and has plenty of alternatives Another way of looking at income inequality is to ask your self about the major integration initiatives going on with housing agencies. If you place the poor near the wealthy you get exactly that, inequality. Over time the hope is it balances out.    I’ll let you click through the links. Here’s the takeaway message. Dallas schools have to get better and the income/investment gap between southern and northern Dallas communities must narrow.   If Dallas wanted this then they better start to seriously consider their outlandish property taxes. If you want to attract the middle class you better drop 2.91% property tax where as in HP/UP you get an effective 1.78% rate and Frisco / Plano 2.25%.   On to the middle class, families flee Dallas to go north to get more bang for their buck and yes a better education, but it also has to do with infrastructure and safety. Dallas refuses to address the transient and mental illness problem, and they refuse to fix the roads the proper way, rather they just dump some asphalt in a hole over and over and over.   Instead Dallas would rather pour money into fun gentrification opportunities to increase the tax base even more.   I know several people that refuse to live in Dallas County due to the corrupt nature of the City of Council.  Can't say i blame them... I mean look at JWP  Not to mention the ""Director, Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center"" probably has a pretty political intent with this report trying to drive his own agenda, all you have to do is look at how he rated California cities, which are some of the most outrageously income inequality places on the planet."
Dallas,3bxrve,hotsizzlepancakes,5,Fri Jul 3 01:33:32 2015 UTC,A lot of the reason why Dallas has a higher tax rate is because of Parkland.
Dallas,3bxrve,SirWillingham,2,Fri Jul 3 03:31:53 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't this rate be the same for any city in Dallas County? It's a county hospital; not city. But by your point, yes, Collin doesn't have a county hospital. And there is much debate about patients from some surrounding counties coming to Parkland for treatment and being indigent, etc."
Dallas,3bxrve,tonictuna,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:43:45 2015 UTC,The rate will change from city to city within Dallas county. HP is in Dallas county and it has a lower tax rate because of the higher average value at which their properties are taxed on. I haven't compared apples to apples from city to city within Dallas county to see which one has the lowest overall tax property tax rate.
Dallas,3bxrve,SirWillingham,2,Fri Jul 3 19:50:35 2015 UTC,"I know several people that refuse to live in Dallas County due to the corrupt nature of the City of Council. Can't say i blame them... I mean look at JWP   I agree with your post for the most part, except for this. Dallas County is controlled by a Judge and Commissioner's Court; this is the group JWP is a member of. The Dallas City Council is a different story. Honestly, all the County departments are fucked in their own special way (see DC Health and Human Services / Zachary Thompson, etc.). The City Council, at least, seems to be headed more in the right direction. Unfortunately for the City of Dallas, it is a strong city-manager system, with weak-mayor and weak-council.

So one of the girls that worked at that bar started working at another one and I ran into her there. Turns out we got along pretty well so I'd go up there and she'd serve me booze a couple of times a week. After about a year some of her other friends started coming up there to meet her and she'd invite me along. Next thing you know I've got 2 new really good, single friends.

It's a highly congested highway and very few people are ever using the HOV lane.   But what's get me most is that there's no signs of where the lane spits you out if you do get on it.

Dallas,3bv4x6,somethingsarcastic,17,Thu Jul 2 14:18:47 2015 UTC,Why is all the highway expansion going into HOT lanes instead of regular lanes?
Dallas,3bv4x6,thephotoman,19,Thu Jul 2 14:29:44 2015 UTC,"This is due to a number of reasons, but mainly there is not enough funding for new highway projects without including cost recovery via tolling. The gas tax has not been raised in 20 years, so inflation is killing that fund, coupled with the fact that cars are more efficient than any time in history meaning people are using a lot less fuel, so less revenue comes from the tax overall. People complain about how bad the roads and highways are, and yet are reluctant to raise any taxes at all."
Dallas,3bv4x6,only1parkjisung,11,Thu Jul 2 15:24:40 2015 UTC,Who are the main bankers who are benefiting from the $300m+ per year in debt services fees for all of these tollroads?  It only cost $130m to operate these and yet we are paying over $300m a year for debt payments?  And why do the debt payments continue to increase every year?  source: https://www.ntta.org/whatwedo/fin_invest_info/financial_Info/Documents/2015/FY2015NTTASystemAnnualBudget.pdf
Dallas,3bv4x6,EdibleFeces,7,Thu Jul 2 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"To add to this, it is far less efficient than taxes alone. You now have toll administrative overhead / profit considerations and also the fact that banks have a piece, and not a small one.  Interest adds up fast on long term debt. You can end up paying double the cost or more on the project over the course of the loan depending on the rate / fees over time.  Now to be fair governments loan against projected tax income regularly for big projects but the interest cost on AAA rated tax exempt bonds is still far less than the interest a for profit toll company needs to cover their non-exempt debt.  It's pretty stupid how much extra we pay indirectly to avoid a direct raise in taxes.  Source: worked for a large bank underwriting bonds for toll companies."

Dallas,3bv4x6,EdibleFeces,5,Fri Jul 3 15:20:53 2015 UTC,"This is the big issue. Add the fact that the last legislative session made it clear that tolling is not their preference and we have a big problem when it comes to funding road projects long term. Thankfully $5 billion has been set aside for transportation projects and the federal government looks likely to increase funding on a national level. It's not a permanent solution, but it does help"

Dallas,3bv4x6,somethingsarcastic,5,Thu Jul 2 15:49:37 2015 UTC,"I misread that, I apologize. I'm not entirely sure myself, but from what I've heard is we have a growing need for construction/maintenance and not enough funds to do so. Sometimes, we build a highway and sell it to NTTA who split their revenue off the toll with whatever county it resides in, after the highway is payed off. So, in order to raise this money, we had toll lanes to generate funds to do the work we need to do. Sometimes its converting a lane to a toll lane, other times its adding a lane and making that a toll. It isn't ideal, but short of raising taxes its really the only way.   I'm sorry if this isn't the answer you're looking for, I'm trying to answer as best as I can."

Dallas,3bv4x6,somethingsarcastic,10,Thu Jul 2 14:27:12 2015 UTC,"Sometimes TCP (Traffic control plan) is not ideal and unfortunately sometimes situations like this cannot be avoided.

So if it seems REALLY bad, chances are the contractor has ignored the plans and set up something haphAzardly without any thought to the traffic flow because it worked for his crew and equipment. Nine times out of ten, we call EVERY DAY and ask them to fix the cones. Not only are people calling, but so is the city. We might, as a last resort, send our guys out and fix the cones (inspectors) but that then puts our guys at an unnecessary risk because the contractor didnt do their job correctly.   It should be noted, however, that the design in high risk areas like that are contracted out and it could have been a designer who didnt know the area and thought that could work, when it doesnt in reality.   TL;DR: most of the time, if it's incredibly stupid/dangerous, a contractor did it wrong."

Dallas,3bv4x6,WillR,5,Thu Jul 2 21:34:21 2015 UTC,"Why do we have limited access HOV lanes separated from the main lanes by plastic posts?  Other states seem to get by just fine with free lane-changing between the HOV and main lanes.   And as a follow-up if we absolutely must have the plastic posts, why can't we have an entrance/exit zone every 2 miles?  The current setup on 75 is completely worthless if you're not going from Allen, Plano, or the Bush turnpike to 635!"
Dallas,3bv4x6,somethingsarcastic,6,Thu Jul 2 16:12:30 2015 UTC,"The PVC pipe barriers are to discourage people from jumping in and out of the lane, IE using it as just another lane. It is to protect its use as just an HOV lane. I realize they get dislodged and end up in traffic and damage your car if you go flying through them, but thats why they are there. Most places also do not encounter the near constant traffic density we have here, so we need something more permanent to maintain that lanes purpose. A concrete barrier is not there because should an accident occur, emergency vehicles and other traffic couldn't get out.   It sounds easy just to open the lane up every so often like you said to allow people to enter and exit, but that would cause SEVERE congestion and be dangerous for the rest of traffic.  How many feet should we open the lane before it becomes too large and the barriers are too sparse? Can you imagine traffic just flying across three or four lanes every few exits to get off? It isnt a safe thing to do, which is part of the reason the exits are spaced like they are. Theres not a perfect solution for the HOV that pleases everyone and maintains the design and point of having it."
Dallas,3bv4x6,SciSlatS,5,Thu Jul 2 16:31:29 2015 UTC,I would argue that California has much worse traffic density but they get by just fine with an unblocked carpool lane. That way it doesn't have to be a carpool lane on the weekends or during off hours and allows traffic to flow more freely. It's a horrible system that badly needs review.
Dallas,3bv4x6,somethingsarcastic,6,Thu Jul 2 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"California would be one of the few places with a higher density than we do. Ill look into it here, see why it's designed like that. :-)"

A lot of the time people forget that we are PEOPLE, not just an orange dot on the construction site. People drive by us yelling, throwing things, and flipping us off all for something chances are they will be driving on as soon as we open it.   I know sometimes its inconvenient, and delays your trip, or the design isnt perfect.

No hardhat.   One time, when I was little, I got into my Dad's office closet, climbed up some racks to the top shelf, and started playing with some antique revolvers he kept there. My Dad found me, took the guns away and, calmly and with cobra-like speed sort of...rapped me on the head with his knuckles.

I've managed to rig a new mirror into place, but I need to go find that clamp piece to actually have the mirror attached how it used to be.   I'm still wondering what the hell. Why take that piece?

It was written on the back of the guy's business card which had all his information. I didn't notice much damage, but you could tell that it'd been dinged.  When I brought the car back up, I showed him the business card. Without even stopping to even think about checking out the damage, he said, ""Eh, it's just a work truck"" and threw the business card in the passenger seat. Still tipped me $10."

Dallas,3btygv,LBK2013,2,Fri Jul 3 00:27:44 2015 UTC,"In 1986, or thereabouts; oil, real estate, small business banking, and silver all collapsed.  The Saudis did the same thing then they did earlier this year - turned the pumps on to destroy a foreign energy source. It was the UK's North Sea production then.  A commercial and residential real estate bubble popped. A lot of families were supported by energy profits. A lot of those profits were put into real estate as a hedge against the future. So when property fell the profits of two industries were lost. No value was retained.  Same with banking. An industry of fairly shade, loosely-regulated, small banks was created in order to facilitate lending for new commercial re and energy projects. Poof! Ashes.  Silver: More complicated. Can't really explain it. Two dudes decided to invest in silver. They were enormously rich, and their investment was proportionately large. When normal market action depressed their holdings they panicked and, being ballers, decided to corner the entire market. The market didn't correct and suddenly one of the family fortunes underpinning three or four key industries in Texas was gone. Also affected was the USD, lending rates, and the notes on about 60% of the energy projects in Texas and N. Dakota at the time.   So, Dallas was recovering from that until 2005 or 2008. Not one but three or four economic A-Bombs hit at once. Luckily, the base industries Dallas is based on were still there, just hugely deflated. If the city had been dependent on say, oh..., auto manufacturing, we easily could have gone the way of Detroit."

In 2011, while he was a member of the Texas Senate, he voted to amend that statute by clarifying that violations are a third-degree felony.

Dallas,3bu50m,_JamesPhan,2,Thu Jul 2 04:18:39 2015 UTC,"We happened to eat there last night.  It wasn't bad.  A few things:   Their Google address is wrong.  They aren't on ""Old Greenville"", which puts you around the Greenville and Royal area.  They're in lower Greenville next to everything else.  If you're familiar with the area, it's right around Good Records.  We told them about this and they said they would fix it.  FB and Yelp addresses are correct.  It should be 1802 Greenville (or something like that).  So don't do what I did and go to the right place. They just opened.  The service there was understandably rough around the edges.  Multiple servers at our beck and call all night.  It's OK some places but it got a bit obnoxious after a while. The appetizers were ok.  We ordered 3 - the garlic albacore (sashimi essentially), the sweet corn fritters, and the crispy pork ears.  The first two were great.  The pork ears were not. I'm not a ramen connoisseur. I fancy myself more of a Pho guy, but I thought the ramen was pretty good.  They had some great variety in their ramen dishes, despite having just 5 main plates. Beer list was lacking.  This isn't the Blind Butcher. Had myself a cocktail, I think it was some gin based cucumber raspberry/berry kind of summer drink.  It was pretty good, if somewhat light.  The GF ordered it for ""me"". Atmosphere was pretty good.  It's one of those open window bar setup things, but the inside was still pretty well pleasant.  The interior is nice enough, and I noticed there was a ramen bar type area towards the back (we got a table however) in addition to the bar that was in the front. I didn't use the restroom.  You can tell a lot about a place by looking at its restroom.  If I'd known I would be reviewing it today I would have checked.  ;) One thing that stood out to me was that I didn't leave the place feeling like I'd had just half a meal.  Probably more a result of eating 1.5 apps and my bowl, but most of the time this kind of meal leaves me hungry for more.  Not so last night.   Overall I'd go back there again.  It definitely fills a niche for the area.  3.5/5.  Solid and has room for improvement."
Dallas,3bu50m,natrapsmai,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:44:41 2015 UTC,"I tried it out today.  Location:  I'm not a big fan of going anywhere near lower Greenville, but since I had to run some errands today...  the location was difficult to find - the signage is very subtle during the day.  It is directly across the street from Good Records, on the east side of Greenville.  Food:   the only thing I was able to try was the Tonkotsu ramen.  The broth was very good and seasoned well.  The soft-boiled egg was cooked perfectly (they gave you 2 halves).  The chashu was disappointing though - it looked like it had seared marks on it, but the flavor was definitely lacking.   I was told that the tsukemen ramen is only available for dinner.  Maybe another time.  The appetizers seem expensive for what they are.  I wasn't curious enough to try.   Service:   like another poster had said - new place.  I went right at opening and the service was fine.  No lines.  They gave me a list of their beers and drinks along with discussing the appetizer menu.   I would give this place another try.  I feel like after this visit, if I could mix the Wabi House broth with the chashu from Ramen Hakata, it would be pretty close to perfect.

Dallas,3bu50m,ijustburnedmytongue,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:58:50 2015 UTC,A few months ago. It used to be a different restaurant and they remodeled it and made it a ramen place.
Dallas,3bu50m,Plopdopdoop,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:23:57 2015 UTC,"Last night: not bad. Good atmosphere and a nice little outdoor setup as well. The menu is a little weird. I wouldn't be surprised to see them change it soon. There are just two sections: small plates and ramen. And the price of ramen compared to small plates seems a little off: ramen (a meal sized portion) goes for $11-14, and yet small plates are nearly the same or higher priced.  The small plates options give you a nice variety to chose from. I had the chicken thigh meatballs and fried vegetables (they're called something else; can't remember). The meatballs are actually ground meat sticks and come with a poached egg in soy-ish sauce. They were good, but the $9 price only feels worth it if you really value that egg dip. The fried vegetables were good as well - a mix of green beans, mild peppers and okra.  The ramen choices are pork and vegetarian, that's it. No chicken, beef, or seafood. I suppose that may be more authentic(?), but I'd like a little more variety. I had the vegetarian. Although I've had better ramen for cheaper, what I got pretty good, especially for vegetarian ramen; the noodles were nearly perfect, good amount of bite; the broth could have been a little more flavorful. There is an option to add other ingredients for $1-4. I added wood ear mushrooms. Next time I'd probably add something else to give it more flavor...maybe a spicy sauce.  I'd go back, but it's not at the top of my list."

For instance if you limit the scope of your request from an approximate 9 years and 10-month time period to the 2014-15 time period and identify the City employees whose email accounts must be searched, the City can conduct a more focused search for the requested information, which will reduce the anticipated costs for obtaining the information that you seek.     10 years of email likely spans multiple providers.

From the response letter, it looks like they made a broad request for data going back to 2005 from multiple sources. The data has to be extracted and formatted so that it can be reviewed  for responsiveness as well as for privileged and private information that cannot be produced. It's also not clear from the letter whether the request was limited to just e-mails. Without knowing the details of the request or the systems in question there is no way of knowing whether $63,000 is reasonable.   Gawker just needs to do some smaller requests to get an idea of what data is out there so it can narrowly tailor its queries to avoid wasting everyone's time; or pay the bill."

Also the streets are controlled by police until ~11ish and barricades are setup the day before.  The police will direct all traffic and you really don't get an option to turn.  When you leave, assuming you live North-NorthEast, Westgrove is a quicker exit out.  Just check Google Maps live traffic map to plot a way out.  The fireworks play in conjunction to the music, but the speakers are way up by the front stage.  If you want the back side of the park, you'll need a radio,"

I could never get a space if I came back too late. I would always try to come home around 3 pm. If your wife is coming around 6:30-7pm, you are totally fucked traffic wise. She'll be home by 9 pm.

Make an official looking notice to leave on cars you know aren't residents, boot them, and charge people $100 to have it taken off. That's exactly what most parking lots do downtown if you don't pay or your time runs out."
Dallas,3btf0p,Shirkaday,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:23:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, people will still park there. Residents will tell their friends to park there, and random people will follow you in to park there.  There's towing companies active, but there's simply too much traffic - even if you have 1 towing truck assigned to a garage, and he finds someone the moment he enters, it will take him 1-2 hours to go to his garage and come back.  I always felt like each garage needed 10 dedicated tow trucks! On the bright, you should watch the fireworks from the roof of the garage (if you have a truck, I would park up there when you get home). It's way more fun than going to the park.  I would seriously consider dropping your wife off in the morning, and then having her uber back to tollway/keller springs, or somewhere off of belt line (maybe by the potbelly's over there) and then just walking home."

We usually park at an apartment complex along Country Square Drive and bike from there.  It is truly amazing to watch the fireworks leave the trailer and explode overhead."

Is something updating everyday and hogging you bandwidth, are there any mac addresses that you don't recognize (someone stealin yo shit), etc...  Next thing would be to take any switches or routers between you and your computer out of the equation and plug directly into the modem. You may have a failing piece of equipment. If you're internet network is clear have them come out and check what your signal strength is from the cable. It could be on the border of what it needs to be and something is adding attenuation at certain points of the day."

My wife and I work from home a lot, and we work in IT, so we are pretty much online the whole day while working. I do experience the occasional drop in connection(i guess once a month ?) but its very rare. We do a lot of remote desktop work and VPN so network drops are easy to notice.  How do you notice that your internet speed is dropping ? Do you notice it while using and run a speedtest ?  I actually have no complaints with TWC.. surprisingly... even with all the negative feedback I keep seeing."

Haven't wanted to call them out here before i rule everything out.   Like i said earlier when this isn't happening my speeds/connection is great(much better than AT&T was at least in my experience)"

Although might be worth mentioning, that last time i had connectivity issues with TWC (it dropped a few times a day which made me lose VPN/Remote desktop connection) I called them up and they told me to NOT reset the modem and wait for it to happen a few times, before calling back. Not sure why but I have a feeling the logs or whatever get erased/purged when the modem is restarted. Called them back after a couple of days and they fixed it.   So might be worth calling/chatting TWC up and tell them whats up. Nicely ! IMHO, You get more with being nice vs being the angry customer over the phone.."

They shape traffic and throttle the shit out of you, you will never get anyone to do anything about it because that's their business model.  My solution: FiOS is a prerequisite for anywhere that I plan on living. Never had a problem with them, I get above advertised speeds 24/7/365. I'm currently paying $70 per month for 75/35, they bumped me up to 75/75 for free a while ago and this is a normal speed test for me: http://www.speedtest.net/result/4474806597.png  Fuck TWC."

What kind if person he was is irrelevant, it's in poor taste, especially with the amount of racial inequality that still persists.   The argument for taking it down is much stronger than justifying keeping it up. No one cares that much about it until they feel like other people are making them do something they don't want to do.

Dallas,3bp2fc,Kirbyoto,0,Thu Jul 2 14:37:06 2015 UTC,Can't tell if sarcastic or if you're not informed on his stature?  He isn't (or hasn't been) the symbolical slavery figurehead as his title might suggest.
Dallas,3bp2fc,natrapsmai,3,Wed Jul 1 17:23:28 2015 UTC,Robert E. Lee lost a war for a backwards society fundamentally founded on white supremacy. Why does he get a statue?
Dallas,3bp2fc,Kirbyoto,3,Wed Jul 1 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"I think you can argue that he accomplished a lot with comparably little, and his reclaim comes more from his work as a military leader and tactician, not as a slaverholder or status symbol of Southern oppression.  Your ""backwards society fundamentally founded on white supremacy"" commentary is pretty skewed.  Lee fought for Virginia (the distinction important) and agonized over the choice to resign his commission to the US Army, where he was at the time the war started.  I get that it's fashionable to look at this period in US history and want to disown everything, but understanding it better certainly helps with perspective.  If you're open to learning more, I'd recommend searching a bit in /r/askhistorians (one of my fav subs) or picking up a book about Civil War history - just not one of the types that's built around troop movements and battle dispatches.  Those can drag, although they do tend to benefit in showing the relationships between political and military leadership.  You'd probably identify more with the critique of the Lost Cause movement if that's your thing.  For the record, I'm a) not a fan of the Confederate flag being flown by states and b) I wouldn't want to tear down a statue of Lee today.  Tldr, if there are villians in the world, Lee probably wasn't one of them."
Dallas,3bp2fc,natrapsmai,-2,Wed Jul 1 18:30:14 2015 UTC,"his reclaim comes more from his work as a military leader and tactician   Sure, dude, that's why we raised all those Rommel statues after World War 2.  This is a bullshit line of reasoning. Hie thee hence, varlet."
Dallas,3bp2fc,Kirbyoto,3,Wed Jul 1 19:03:29 2015 UTC,I think you'll have to take that up with Germany.  US Reconstruction and postwar Germany are two entirely different beasts.
Dallas,3bp2fc,natrapsmai,7,Wed Jul 1 19:12:24 2015 UTC,"That's true, they are.  In the post-war South, most confederate leaders and officers were pardoned, thus maintaining an aristocracy of white supremacists who, despite the occasional federal intervention, were able to maintain a racist chokehold on the region, including (but not limited to) flying the colors of their failed country in front of their government buildings. The fact is, most of the people putting up those statues were sympathetic to the confederate cause, and many of them had fought for it.  Meanwhile, post-war Germany was a huge mess, and the Allies on both sides of the Iron Curtain made sure to remind the Germans that it was entirely their fault. As a result, you had a massive cultural shift away from fascism, to the point that using the symbols of THAT failed state is literally illegal.  So...yes. I agree. They're two entirely different beasts. There were no statues of Rommel raised because the German people were taught to disown their horrible racist heritage. There WERE statues of Robert E. Lee raised because the former Confederates weren't. Why does that mean they should be allowed to stay standing?"
Dallas,3bp2fc,Kirbyoto,2,Wed Jul 1 19:18:47 2015 UTC,"entirely their fault   I like your emphasis, and I agree entirely.  The difference is indeed a cultural one, and it makes it impossible to judge both by the same yardstick.  Germany lost a total war against the combined Allied powers.  Victory and reconciliation in the South was as political as anything, with major compromises being made for Reconstruction.  Anyway, there are valid reasons for a statue to exist, and there are certainly bigger and better examples of Southern racism and oppression than this one of Lee.  I personally view the statue (and the man himself) as a monument to military achievement.  I guess others can feel differently - we reflect on history through the prism of our own experiences, after all.  But it's hard for me to look at this and to feel like it's anything else but misplaced knee jerk vandalism."
Dallas,3bp2fc,budguy68,4,Wed Jul 1 19:24:28 2015 UTC,"it makes it impossible to judge both by the same yardstick   I disagree. ""Yardsticks"" are inherently subjective. I would not accept statues of Nazi leaders being raised in post-war Germany; I do not accept statues of Confederate leaders being raised in the post-war South. Now we are in a position to rectify those mistakes. This is the year 2015, the country is the United States of America, and the Confederacy lost.   I personally view the statue (and the man himself) as a monument to military achievement.   Just FYI, if you think that ""military achievement"" is valuable without regard for political affiliation, you're...I mean, you're not great, is what I'm going to say here. The military exists to accomplish political objectives. Jerking off to the idea of someone just being ""generally good at killin' dudes"" seems questionable, to say the least.  And, again, if we're raising statues to people for their ""military achievement"", it's weird how many statues there are of losers like Lee, and how few there are of winners like Joseph Stalin and Genghis Khan."

Dallas,3bp2fc,deHavillandDash8Q400,6,Wed Jul 1 14:46:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry for this wall of text. Nearly twenty years ago, my mother won the Diversity Visa Lottery (and the chances of winning are like winning any money lottery). As a result, my family packed up and left our condo, my dad gave up his lucrative finance job, and my mom left her position at a newspaper to migrate to America, where my mom stayed home to raise my baby sister. My dad's first job was at Whataburger, flipping burgers, even though he finished his Master's at 22 with highest honors. It took over a decade before I'd let myself eat at Whataburger because I was always so furious that that was all he could get with foreign qualifications.  Yet my parents' efforts gave me a chance to get a $248,000 college degree debt-free. This has given me the freedom to build my life without dealing with crippling debt, and my life is so easy now. The lucky outcome of some randomly selected program some person or organization chose to develop changed my entire family's lives. And since then, several of my relatives have been able to come to the US thanks to my parents' establishment here, and many are pretty successful. I was also lucky to have had the right teachers, the right opportunities, the right access, etc.   My mom is now a teacher at a private school. She had a full-scholarship kid get into Stanford with a full ride, and her parents wouldn't let her go because they wanted her to help raise her siblings and pay the bills at home. The school OFFERED to fund the family's relocation to be near her at Stanford, but the parents still said no, they'd rather have her there. That probably changed her life in one way, and she'll never know how going to Stanford could've changed her life in another.  If my descendants were captured and shipped to some country off the Atlantic Slave Trade route and they endured generations of slavery, poverty, discrimination, and abuse, and every time they tried to make a life for themselves, a screwed up racist system tried to keep them from making that possible, I certainly don't know what kind of person I would have become. African-Americans get my full sympathy because I can't imagine anything more frustrating than the world denying the extent and severity of what really happened with race relations in this country.  Every day something happens that could alter the course of your life's history and the generations ahead of you, and you think that centuries of slave trade is irrelevant to present-day America or its individuals? What about all the families whose fortunes were built through the hands of slaves and their children are living great lives today because of it versus whites in rural Appalachia whose families never had the means to get out of poverty? You are the result of everything that has ever happened to anyone in your lineage and the lives they led in all of time, and to believe otherwise is just sticking your neck in the sand."

Dallas,3bp2fc,CallMeRamrod,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:21:09 2015 UTC,"I was much pleased the with President's message. His views of the systematic and progressive efforts of certain people at the North to interfere with and change the domestic institutions of the South are truthfully and faithfully expressed. The consequences of their plans and purposes are also clearly set forth. These people must be aware that their object is both unlawful and foreign to them and to their duty, and that this institution, for which they are irresponsible and non-accountable, can only be changed by them through the agency of a civil and servile war. There are few, I believe, in this enlightened age, who will not acknowledge that slavery as an institution is a moral and political evil. It is idle to expatiate on its disadvantages. I think it is a greater evil to the white than to the colored race. While my feelings are strongly enlisted in behalf of the latter, my sympathies are more deeply engaged for the former. The blacks are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally, physically, and socially. The painful discipline they are undergoing is necessary for their further instruction as a race, and will prepare them, I hope, for better things. How long their servitude may be necessary is known and ordered by a merciful Providence. Their emancipation will sooner result from the mild and melting influences of Christianity than from the storm and tempest of fiery controversy. This influence, though slow, is sure. The doctrines and miracles of our Saviour have required nearly two thousand years to convert but a small portion of the human race, and even among Christian nations what gross errors still exist! While we see the course of the final abolition of human slavery is still onward, and give it the aid of our prayers, let us leave the progress as well as the results in the hands of Him who, chooses to work by slow influences, and with whom a thousand years are but as a single day. Although the abolitionist must know this, must know that he has neither the right not the power of operating, except by moral means; that to benefit the slave he must not excite angry feelings in the master; that, although he may not approve the mode by which Providence accomplishes its purpose, the results will be the same; and that the reason he gives for interference in matters he has no concern with, holds good for every kind of interference with our neighbor, -still, I fear he will persevere in his evil course. . . . Is it not strange that the descendants of those Pilgrim Fathers who crossed the Atlantic to preserve their own freedom have always proved the most intolerant of the spiritual liberty of others?   Why not post the full quote? He wanted to keep slaves because god allowed men to be slaves. What kind of fucked up rationale is that? A tenant of his own religion contradicts that very position, unless, he likely considered blacks less than human."

If you will forgive me copy pasting.  I recall someone telling me once, in Europe, that the Nazi flag was actually the Roman Cross...so people should not be offended by it. Well, the problem is... it was appropriated by Nazis and became their symbol. The Confederate flag, regardless of technicalities became the symbol of slave-owning states. Yes...the South did fight a war over states' rights. They felt that losing their slaves would have severe economic costs... but... then or now, owning humans as chattel is wrong. When the Civil War is taught, it is often boiled down to... the South was bad because it had slaves (though many in the North did, too) and they wanted to keep their slaves so they went to war against the heroic North.  The defeat that the South suffered has resounded to this day. There lingers a sense that the North is ""better than"" the South.  I recall learning about the war as a Northerner and thinking, ""Thank heavens we were not the bad guys.""  And that's messed up when you think about it, because in the 70's no one was responsible for the Civil War.  Anyway, back to Europe... after WWI, the Germans were forced to accept the War Guilt Clause. They had to take full responsibility for the war and to pay reparations for it. This basically crippled them. It was punishment on top of punishment. Being the ""bad guys"" and having to pay even as they needed to rebuild their own nation caused the conditions that led to the rise of Hitler.  After WWII, things got a little smarter and even though we knew that the Germans had done terrible things that led to war... they were given a bit of a break in trying to rebuild.  The rest of the world kind of said, ""That was terrible, but get your shit together, punish the evil doers and we will allow you to become a member of the world community and work to see that it never happens again.""  So, what the world was able to do for Germany... it kind of seems like we in the USA have never really been able to do for the South. There are people who feel that they are intellectually superior to Southerners. There are people who still hold the South, collectively, responsible for slavery. There are people who say things like, ""I'd never go to _________, it's full of racists.""  After the war, the North destroyed and pillaged the South.  I'm sure that left a sense of resentment in the minds of many Southerners. I think that, even today, there are probably folks who feel that the South, in general, gets a bad rap and it's past time to get over it.  But part of getting over it is acknowledging that the Confederate flag, in the minds of many, represents a repressive and racist South that needs to be a remnant of the past. Also, the egregiously superior attitude of some in the North needs to slap itself down."

I'm sure that left a sense of resentment in the minds of many Southerners.    Growing up in Texas in the 1960s, we used to play Civil War. Everybody had a grey Rebel cap and a blue Union cap, but nobody really wanted to be a Yankee soldier, so we drew straws for that.  We kind of knew about slavery, but more importantly in our minds, we knew about Reconstruction and the carpet baggers who came from the North and the Southern scalawags who helped them exploit other Southerners. Of course we didn't support slavery, or even bigotry in my house. For us as kids it was about regional pride, and being on the right side, and being associated with rebels instead of conformists.   We never had a Confederate battle flag though, that wasn't really much of a big deal until Civil Rights became more of a big deal, which was after we had grown out of playing War."

Dallas,3bp2fc,CaptainBayouBilly,3,Wed Jul 1 15:59:19 2015 UTC,"Ok, but we didn't really do it for Germany either.

The north had slavery too. Someone correct me if I am wrong but the war over states' rights began over legislation on how the slaves would be counted for taxation and representation. Slaves gave the south a huge benefit in representation and there was legislation to have them count as less, in effect making the South lose its advantage in representation."
Dallas,3bp2fc,IBiteYou,2,Wed Jul 1 14:45:21 2015 UTC,"Lincoln ran on a platform of preventing the expansion of slavery into the new western territories/states which had previously been a 1:1 ratio between free and slave. Southerners were worried that they would become a minority in congress if slavery wasn't allowed to expand any further west, and that slavery would come to an end. Once Lincoln was elected president southern states began to secede. The civil war was not a war over state's rights, it was fought because the south was afraid of losing the institution of slavery"

I suggest you read Lies Across America, it was an eye-opener in terms of looking at historic monuments. I think it's disingenuous to say that tearing down a monument is the equivalent of destroying or erasing our history. That seems to imply that without the monument we would forget, and I don't think that holds up to scrutiny. Why are so many people ok with public monuments that honor the legacy of the confederacy? They were traitors and proponents of slavery. Are these the kinds of things that we value as a country? Because that is what we endorse through these monuments. Personally, I'd like to tear them down, but at the very least, the historical markers should be updated to reflect a more nuanced view so that they aren't an implicit endorsement"
Dallas,3bp2fc,unexpected,3,Wed Jul 1 14:29:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not against the removal of these monuments, but physically pulling them down outside of the system sets up an unnecessary divide between those that want it gone and those that want it there. Lee wasn't a great man, but shouldn't we be putting pressure to take down these Nathan Bedford Forrest statues first? I mean, the dude started the KKK, and Lee wasn't clean but at least he fought more out of loyalty to Virginia. I'm okay with these monuments going down, but they should be through the channels the American people set up, I think that would have the most lasting impact."
Dallas,3bp2fc,aqouta,3,Wed Jul 1 04:02:41 2015 UTC,The protest is a first step at reminding society at large how pervasive Confederate apologist attitudes are. Shunning the symbols and personalities that nearly destroyed our nation over greed and hate is a positive move for all humans.

Dallas,3bp2fc,Skydog69,6,Wed Jul 1 15:45:41 2015 UTC,You know who else were traitors and proponents of slavery? The founding fathers. I propose we burn all American flags because we don't understand cultural relativity.
Dallas,3bp2fc,Koopa_Troop,2,Wed Jul 1 15:59:32 2015 UTC,"The current American flag was adopted on July 4, 1960, 124 years after the last founding father died, so it'd be really stupid to burn something they never would've even seen as if it's actively representative of them. Not to mention they're remembered a lot more than just be traitors and proponents of slavery. The same can't really be said of the Confederacy. The Confederate legacy was 100 years of Jim Crow laws and shitty paint jobs on old Chevy trucks.  Notice we don't fly the 13 colony flag over the capitol anymore? We just keep it as a relic in a museum because history is important but that symbol is currently irrelevant and no longer represents this country. And that's a symbol for a country that won their war."

Would have cost around $400 at a retail store.  Not sure how good their selection is for women's clothing but have been impressed with their men's selection."
Dallas,3boedp,dbrianthomas,3,Tue Jun 30 23:32:14 2015 UTC,Good to know. Thanks.
Dallas,3boedp,dbrianthomas,4,Tue Jun 30 23:39:02 2015 UTC,"I am so going to regret giving out these two to you scavengers:  Genesis Benefit Thrift (Lemmon at Knight) - The store supports a women's shelter and a lot of wealthy Park Cities people donate items and volunteer there. Quality is vastly higher than Goodwill, but prices are not as high as a consignment store. 50-cent books and a ton of pretty accurately priced (so you won't find many insane steals) high-end handbags and designer men's dress shoes.  Out of the Closet (Cedar Springs at Knight) - Just a short jog over from Genesis is this relatively new thrift store that uses funds raised to provide free confidential HIV testing, AIDS counseling, condoms, and a pharmacy (all located at the back half of the store's space).   In case you're unfamiliar with Oak Lawn, it's a very gay-friendly part of Dallas (hence the store's double-entendre name). You'll find mostly men's clothing, including fashionable tees and jeans at cheap prices. Very affordable and the employees are super friendly.  *Plus, you'll get a nice bright pink plastic bag with ""Out of the Closet!"" printed on it for carrying around your purchases (or, if you're like me, for making your wife raise an eyebrow when you ""accidentally"" leave it laying around)."
Dallas,3boedp,Thecatmilton,5,Wed Jul 1 02:54:25 2015 UTC,"OP, if you visit Garland Road Thrift (I quit going because I never seem to find jack shit there), be sure to hit up the two stores across Garland Road, on either side of Sali's. The little orange cottage is East Lake Pet Orphanage's store."
Dallas,3boedp,TeaMistress,4,Wed Jul 1 02:58:09 2015 UTC,Urban Thrift on the corner of Audelia and Walnut Hill/Kingsley (street changes names around there) is pretty good.
Dallas,3boedp,texasbella,3,Wed Jul 1 05:45:54 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're looking for, of course.  I like Thrift Giant on Irving Blvd. off Hwy 12 for costume jewelry, bric-a-brac, shoes, linens, bedding  Goodwill on Westmoreland is a good place for picture frames, art, and kitchen stuff.  Genesis Thrift Stores on Lemmon/Knight has a constant turnover and there's always interesting stuff - furniture, clothing, bric-a-brac. They've taken a turn for the fancy lately and their prices are somewhat higher than chain stores, but their quality is great. You can also bargain with the people outside for stuff that's just been dropped off.  For clothing I've had the best luck by taking a drive up to Lewisville and hitting the Goodwill and the other 2 nearby thrift stores right up Main Street. It's a bit of a drive, but so worth it."
Dallas,3boedp,David_Kleinfeld,4,Wed Jul 1 02:33:49 2015 UTC,So not go to Clothes Circuit on Sherry Lane in HP.  Everything is way over priced.

Dallas,3boedp,vonunov,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:17:45 2015 UTC,"St. Vincent de Paul off NW Hwy. They always have good stuff and I have consistently found quality pieces there. There are M-F daily discount categories and on weekends they do ""manager's specials,"" which are usually home decor and/or women's clothing at 30% off. I rarely pay more than $5 per item, though they also tend to carry the more expensive brand labels for $15-30 a pop. Sometimes you will find those in with the regular stuff - I have snagged Citizens of Humanity jeans (two pair!), a BCBG dress, and just last weekend a Halogen dress and all were $5 each or less. I find lots of stuff new with tags and also plenty of things that looked like they might have been worn once and then donated.  They also have a Plano location. I have only been there twice, so I may not be accurate in saying this, but from my experience, the NW Hwy one is better, at least for the stuff I look for. It's also definitely bigger than the Plano location.   They also have a loyalty card and a text message alert system. The texts are usually special 40% off deals for that day only, which can come in handy!"
Dallas,3boedp,deborahsk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:02:28 2015 UTC,Haven't found one that I love yet but avoid Clothes Circuit. I've been in there twice and both times they just watch me like a hawk and never even a quick 'Hello' or anything. Plus it is all overpriced

Dallas,3bmosr,Id_fuck_your_mom,2,Tue Jun 30 19:01:17 2015 UTC,Investment income likely wouldn't show up in these figures either.
Dallas,3bmosr,Scottmk4,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:44:30 2015 UTC,That probably has something to do with it. I know I have worked on a couple of houses in UP where the parents live out of state and bought the house for their kids to live in while attending SMU. It's was kind of sad. They were both really nice houses but the interiors had been wrecked because the kids treated it like a place to party rather than a place to live.
Dallas,3bmosr,ZombieCharltonHeston,6,Wed Jul 1 02:40:40 2015 UTC,"Probably not the same people. The median is where 50% of households are below and 50% are above, so you have 11,979 households making below $74K, and 11,979 making above that. But the median doesn't tell how much above that goes. It could zoom up to $500,000 and continue on up to $500,000,000 for all we can tell from what they've given us.  Then if most of those lower 11,979 people lived in apartments, the median home price might be skewed high because there are no lower priced homes, only high priced ones, which are owned by the upper 11,979 people."

I can even think of a popular barber here in Dallas (Rob's Chop Shop) that not only refuses to cut women's hair, but refuses to allow them to be in the shop at all. Everyone's money is worth the same, but if a business doesn't want the money of a certain group that's their business that's put on the line for it. Of course refusing a certain group in this day gets backlash and causes trouble and lost business. While it likely didn't do so in 1974, so I can see why it's in place and wouldn't want to step backwards in civil rights."

People, especially guys want to have room to store tools, mower, etc. Since I turned my garage back into a garage, I now have room for all of that and room for wifey to park.

Dallas,3bp09z,CeleryStickBeating,2,Wed Jul 1 02:02:38 2015 UTC,"I've wondered since this whole thing started 4 years ago why JWP hasn't cut a deal. I've got 3 theories.  1: He's stubborn. Ever defense attorney has had a client like this. The prosecutor has an airtight case against them, but they insist on their day in court. It almost never ends well. Possible, but I think it's unlikely.  2: He thinks he's going to win. Also unlikely. The federal government would not raid the home and office of the most powerful black politician in a Democratic county unless they had the goods. The feds have a conviction rate in the range of 90% or so. It's possible JWP has an ace up his sleeve, but it doesn't seem likely.  3: The most conspiracy oriented theory. So, Jim Schutze has written a lot about the Inland Port and how he expects to to play a big role at the upcoming trial.   Let's say the allegations are true, and Price sabotaged the Inland Port at the behest of Ross Perot Jr. Why doesn't he give Perot up to the feds? Price is big time in Dallas County, but he's small time compared to someone worth 1.5 - 2.0 billion dollars.   It's like the mafia's Omerta. The code of silence. Price keeps his mouth shut about Perot. He does his time (if convicted) and when he gets out, there's a cushy job waiting for him a Perot company. Not that there's a quid pro quo. It will be spun that Perot wants to help a long time member of the community get back on his feet."
Dallas,3bp09z,MaverickTTT,2,Wed Jul 1 02:54:37 2015 UTC,"2: He thinks he's going to win. Also unlikely. The federal government would not raid the home and office of the most powerful black politician in a Democratic county unless they had the goods.    Honestly, I think he's pompous enough to think he's going to win.  He's been insulated by the South Dallas community and it's pastors for decades.  I think he believes that will, somehow, still protect him from the Feds.  Your Perot endgame theory is interesting (and I think you're dead-on about the Omerta of the Dallas business elite)...but, JWP is 65 years old and facing a long, long time in jail.  That's a helluva gamble."
Dallas,3bp09z,tonictuna,2,Wed Jul 1 14:33:05 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this one. Someone that has been involved with decades of corruption definitely has an altered mindset.

It's going to be a long one."
Dallas,3bp09z,_0o0_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:43:56 2015 UTC,Why doesn't he give Perot up to the feds?   because it's not like Price sat down and was handed money directly from Perot. the money probably went through so many channels that Perot nor his associates could ever be touched.

Dallas,3bok67,petesopete,6,Tue Jun 30 21:44:57 2015 UTC,"Google shows the quickest route to take is US287 to Amarillo then I40 over.  If you take that, do not speed.  If you do speed, don't say no one warned you.  There are several speed traps along that way, the most prominent is Estelline.  I haven't had to drive that way in two years, but when I did for several years in a row there was always a billboard to warn drivers about it and I would see cops in every other small town where the speed drops.  There really isn't a whole hell of a lot to see on that road.  Medicine Mound is a ghost town located off of 287 between Chillicothe and Quanah.  Just a few structures remain.  The only other things you might want to see are Palo Duro Canyon [not that far off the route] and Caprock Canyon State Park [a bit further] - they have free roaming Bison and some pretty good hiking trails.  Lake Meredith North of Amarillo probably still isn't a lake but a puddle, it is good for a pretty sunset though.  If you want to visit an amusement park and maybe ride a roller coaster or two, Wonderland Park isn't half bad for what it is.  Especially considering how far you'd have to travel to get to Six Flags or anything else!  Cadillac Ranch on your way out of town [you will need to U-turn since it's on the South side of I40.  DO NOT GO TO THE BIG TEXAN.  It is truly terrible food.  Coyote Bluff Cafe makes a good burger, it's a small house and there will most likely be a wait.  I would suggest more but nothing else is really all that note worthy.  Taqueria El Tapatio isn't half bad, nor is El Manatial, and the place I used to go to Pepito's closed down.  Unfortunately that's it for what I know, I never ventured down 40 past Cadillac Ranch."

I would assume someone who's about to propose knows exactly what their significant other would want and different people obviously like different things."
Dallas,3boa0z,dharmazazen,5,Tue Jun 30 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"About 15 years ago (maybe it's still there?) there was a gas station in uptown - McKinney and sneed. Gas was literally about double what it was everywhere else because it was the only one in the area.   Anyway, I'd imagine it's because the burbs have more gas stations (and more land for potential gas stations) and that they open up across the street from each other making prices more competitive."
Dallas,3boa0z,TheGrest,3,Tue Jun 30 22:55:51 2015 UTC,uptown vs the burbs. It's more of a rent issue than anything else I would suspect. gas stations aren't typically the highest paying rent businesses. 30 years ago every corner had a gas station on it. That has changed and now it's banks.

And when I finally went...I was underwhelmed; this spring they sent us there due to pool closings elsewhere. I found it to be quite underwhelming compared to Ys I've belonged to in other parts of the country, even in much smaller cities (but I kinda get the feeling Ys aren't a big thing down here).   The pool isn't great (although they are limited by the building): only 3ft max depth I think (good luck turning), pretty dirty, and no locker room access...you have to take the elevator and walk through the lobby. I couldn't believe I was doing it right the first time I swam there. There are changing stalls right by the pool. But their use is obviously limited if you want to shower after. Spacious weight room/area, relatively limited weight machines (for the size of the place), a good amount of treadmills; wifi never worked well for me in this area locker room has nice facilities - dry sauna, hot tub, showers. But it could and should be cleaned much more frequently. In my 5 visits there have been lots of dirty towels thrown around, no clean towels, dirty shower floor, etc. (The one time I did see someone cleaning, he took my towel from the hook while I was showering.) the racquetball and basketball courts look pretty nice   How does the price compare to other options downtown? Last I looked it seemed close to the range of what I expect from the nicer options downtown. I think it'd only be worth it to me if I used the basketball or racquetball courts...or if there aren't any other indoor pools close by."

Dallas,3bii1a,RettyD4,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:23:58 2015 UTC,"That video is of one of the races during the 1994 Dallas Grand Prix which was held around Reunion Arena. The main race for all but the first Dallas Grand Prix was an SCCA Trans Am and they were held at Fair Park, Addison Airport and Reunion Arena."

Dallas,3bii1a,James-Wing,4,Mon Jun 29 14:39:46 2015 UTC,Another interesting fact about the F1 race.   Aryton Senna was DNF'd because someone had hit one of the ARMCO/Concrete barriers and moved it approximately 5cm from it's anchored position. This caused him to hit the barrier and rip off part of the front wheel and suspension.   It was also so hot that day that drivers were passing out during the race. Dallas has never seen another F1 event.

Dallas,3bii1a,Korietsu,3,Mon Jun 29 16:04:50 2015 UTC,"It regularly gets up to 120f track temps during the early summer races. Not to mention much warmer in the car. Drives can lose up to 10lbs in water weight during a race, but average somewhere around 6.6 lbs.   They generally have a drinks bottle that has 1L of water/fluid but it gets so hot its nearly undrinkable after the first bit of the race.   F1 is a totally brutal sport on the body."

Dallas,3bkzgq,nomnomnompizza,8,Tue Jun 30 04:30:00 2015 UTC,"Cover the yard in rocks.  Lots of little rocks.  I hate mowing.  Waste of life, could be doing anything else in the world and actually be more productive."
Dallas,3bkzgq,Rebalanced,4,Tue Jun 30 08:45:30 2015 UTC,"I recently moved to a different city. It is somewhat of a vacation area/retirement city and it is amazing how many houses have what they call 'trouble free lawns', basically gravel landscaping with region specific ground cover plantings (no mowing/watering required). The idea is to use groundcover that grows naturally in the area. Normal rain is all that the groundcover needs (no additional watering).  Yes, I do have to use some weed killer in the spring for the few weeds that pop up, but I don't have to water/mow a lawn all spring/summer, and a quick blow off of leaves in the winter is a nice touch. 4/5 days a year vs weeks of work each season is quite a nice change.  Not sure how such landscaping would fly in your neighborhood, but you should give it a try. We waste so much DRINKABLE water on lawns when we could actually be drinking that water!"
Dallas,3bkzgq,project23,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:38:01 2015 UTC,I have 5 acres of land south of Grandbury and I will not replace any of the natural grass that's out there. The only thing I'll do is mow it. That is if I don't get goats to do it for me.

Gardening is a pain in the ass. It can be worth it though. Just like cooking your own food. The better the work the better you get, and it feels so good in the end."
Dallas,3bkzgq,PhilHolz,4,Tue Jun 30 09:47:10 2015 UTC,I'm actually in the market to buy a new house.  I think if I saw this it may be a deal breaker.  But I'm more of an outdoor type of person and enjoy yard work.
Dallas,3bkzgq,txholdup,7,Tue Jun 30 14:47:31 2015 UTC,"There is enough plastic in the world without adding to backyards.  It wouldn't stop me from buying a house I really like because I have always ""fixed"" the lawns in the houses I have bought.  But it sure wouldn't be a plus."
Dallas,3bkzgq,txholdup,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:58:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I totally understand that aspect of it, so for a person like you it would be a takeaway. If I might ask, how old are you? Kids? My house is in Farmers Branch, one of the nicer areas, and the neighborhood is basically older couples, or middle aged new families, and seems to have been that way for a while. So I see an older person being happy they don't have to mow, or work in the yard, and similarly for a younger person like me, who could afford to have it done, but because I grew up mowing the yard just can't pay someone to do it.  I really want to go this route, I just don't want to layout the $5k and get absolutely nothing out of it down the road."

Not sure about this but have read some things about artificial turf not being a good choice for people with kids.

Dallas,3bkzgq,jeep157,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:15:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not looking to get $1 for $1 value out of it, but the water savings alone for anyone using a synthetic lawn would be huge now, and depending on how water continues to be available as a resource it could be a really big thing down the line if we ever moved.

Dallas,3bkzgq,Milnoch,3,Tue Jun 30 21:13:16 2015 UTC,"I enjoy yard work, but if it looked good I would buy it in a heart beat. We have two huge live oaks in the front and grass just doesn't grow. I would love some fake stuff there. You still have to blow leaves and all of that stuff, you just don't have to mow and fertilize. So you still get yard work.  Don't forget to water your tress still.   Also, to those that doubt, look at forever lawn. I have a friend that installs it and he is always posting pics of before and after and they look great. He says most of his clients are in the Park Cities oddly enough."
Dallas,3bkzgq,chantistar,3,Tue Jun 30 15:23:46 2015 UTC,"Nope, would never buy a house with synthetic grass."
Dallas,3bkzgq,SuaveInternetUser,3,Tue Jun 30 17:11:38 2015 UTC,"For anyone with pets/kids synthetic would not be a plus.  It gets hot in the summer (hot enough to burn you like standing on pavement/blacktop) and it traps pet waste odors (primarily urine).  Also if it gets damaged (ripped/torn/cut) you have limited options on the repair and the repairs are obvious.  My experience for the above is the ""fancy"" dog area that the apartments next to me installed that I used last summer.  They installed a very nice synthetic covering.  Surprisingly in the middle of the day in summer it was so hot you couldn't walk on it.  My large dog who never had any issues walking on the sidewalk couldn't walk on it without raising feet because it was uncomfortable.  And now 1 year+ later, it's pretty rank smelling with urine despite all the rain we have had this spring."
Dallas,3bkzgq,nikki109,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:26:06 2015 UTC,Do you have any idea if they ever clean the area? My assumption is probably not as much as say a homeowner would. I haven't really thought about the animal thing too terribly much. Although I know my short haired dog enjoys laying in the grass when it's sunny. He also enjoys tearing the shit out of the yard as well though..
Dallas,3bkzgq,Wentthruurhistory,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:56:15 2015 UTC,Users are supposed to pickup poop.  The community does do it as well on a regular basis (couple of times a week).  Very rarely any excrement lying around for long.  The primary smell is urine related tbh.  And short of hosing down the whole place I can't see how you solve that.  Urine should drain through just like water will.  But still has an odor.  And like I said if all the rain we had this spring didn't solve the issue I don't think a water hose will either.
Dallas,3bkzgq,CeleryStickBeating,2,Tue Jun 30 22:16:40 2015 UTC,"if you have examples where this doesn't look tacky i might be open to it. i prefer xeriscaping, though."
Dallas,3bkzgq,ElCangrejo,2,Tue Jun 30 02:34:28 2015 UTC,I'd buy it.  It'd be a plus for me.  I have grass allergies and I think people wasting water on lawns in an area that at times doesn't get enough is wasteful and ridiculous.  The high end turf looks great and I fully intend on doing it if I can.  If not that hopefully I can find a place with a very small front lawn and a large back yard I can turn into a garden that actually produces food instead of a bunch of sod that does nothing but drink a bunch of water and then burns up in August in a drought year.
Dallas,3bkzgq,CeleryStickBeating,2,Tue Jun 30 11:32:28 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you'd care, but I heard synthetic lawns get VERY hot in the summer. Kinda like how a concrete or asphalt parking lot is a much hotter place than a grassy area. Not sure if actually true, but what I've heard.  Also heard you need to be concerned about where your rain runoff is going to go. With natural grass, most of it is absorbed into the ground. With synthetic, it's going to need to go somewhere.  With that being said, if it doesn't look obviously fake, I'd consider it. I hate the upkeep of a large yard."
Dallas,3bkzgq,Id_fuck_your_mom,2,Tue Jun 30 12:20:57 2015 UTC,"The turf soccer fields are something like 20-25 degrees hotter than regular grass fields. You can feel the difference 2 feet onto the field,and the air seems to hold the heat about 4 feet above the ground.  I have no idea how that translates for residential use turf though."
Dallas,3bkzgq,CeleryStickBeating,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:53:44 2015 UTC,"I hate the upkeep of a large yard.   I don't know if it is absolutely required, but I heard you have to vacuum it every so often to keep the dust and trash off of it."
Dallas,3bkzgq,CeleryStickBeating,2,Tue Jun 30 15:44:07 2015 UTC,"I went to some peoples house that had their backyard in synthetic grass and it was amazing. Great for the kids to play on. I want to do it to mine.  I have sodded the back twice and it just dies, because of shade from a huge tree.  I did have a neighbor at a different house put rubber mulch in his entire back yard. That was crappy."

You may run into property owners who will tell you to move/vacate.  As a safety precaution, bring a few gallons of water and some metal containers to put the used fireworks into.  Douse them liberally with water after they are used.  Do not put them into plastic trash bags until you are certain they are no longer potentially active or hot.  Wet fireworks are capable of smoldering which could set something that's dried out or not yet exploded into a hazard.  From my eight years experience spending several thousand dollars per year on fireworks...    Buy the big shell displays.  Don't be cheap in your purchases.  Big explosions are worth the extra cost.    You can make mortar tubes out of 1""-1.5"" PVC, glue and some plywood.  They'll be a lot more durable than the cardboard tubes they'll give you.

Dallas,3bj746,whats_a_puscifer,5,Mon Jun 29 17:44:16 2015 UTC,"Don't drive.  DART station is right out front  Don't watch from inside the cotton bowl.  The best place to watch is from the far end of the founatain pool.  If you don't get there 8 hours early to stack a spot, other good places to watch are:  Cold Beer Company or any other of the fine establishments in expo square(2 blocks away), except the Sand Bar. The lights are too bright to see the fireworks  The roof of the Green Room on Elm Street in Deep Ellum.  BUt its a little far away  The bridge over Peak or Haskell on the Santa Fe trail.

Dallas,3bj746,mattmitsche,4,Tue Jun 30 12:30:29 2015 UTC,"Traffic is going to be heavy no matter what, but I find it easier to go around the back way, like Haskell, Crosstown, Fitzhugh. Or you could take the train.  I don't know if this is still possible, but after years of seeing it from inside the Cotton Bowl, one time we laid out on those little grassy areas on the southeast end of it. That was pretty cool, because we could watch the guy lighting fuzes, and some of the debris from the starbursts fell down on us. Among some of the debris was a little packet that been blown out but hadn't ignited. We took it home and lit it in our back yard."
Dallas,3bj746,mutatron,5,Mon Jun 29 17:55:38 2015 UTC,Bring cash because The Midway will be open with rides and games.  Don't know the entry fee though.  The best view of the fireworks would be over by the Top O' Texas Tower.
Dallas,3bj746,20TL12III,2,Mon Jun 29 18:25:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, so far my plan is to take DART down to Fair Park, spend some time at Craft & Growler and then wobble over to the midway. I think we may have to settle for watching the fireworks from the Cotton Bowl. Sorry /r/ mittmitsche, but I don't know where your shed is. :("
Dallas,3bj746,BlueKnight8907,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:45:37 2015 UTC,"If you take the DART rail make sure to wait for it closest to where the conductor will stop. Everyone will be fighting and shoving to get on in the middle and the back so a lot of people forget about the head of the train. Also, as soon as the fireworks end RUN to the train! They will have extra trains coming but it's so chaotic you will not want to be there behind everyone else. My daughter was almost pushed on to the tracks because people think shoving will make the train get there faster."
Dallas,3bj746,RIPDeepEllum,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:13:17 2015 UTC,...so wait until the herd has already boarded? Running to the train in order to beat the crowd is just going to put you in the middle of every asshole trying to do the same thing.

Dallas,3bjny0,hasbridge,2,Mon Jun 29 20:34:35 2015 UTC,You can park at the Liquor store when the gates are closed.  Just don't be on the field if it's muddy. That's generally why the gates are closed.

Dallas,3bj876,geminisarefun,2,Mon Jun 29 17:52:07 2015 UTC,"Consult with Yelp as many movers will specify local moves vs long-distance moves and you'll have honest reviews from people who have used their services.    Get rates on if they charge per box, per hour, per person, what the travel charge is, etc.  Do they do dryer/washer hookups?  Know that most moving crews turnover as the seasons change so any recommendation you get here or on Yelp, look for the most recent reviews.    The crew we used to move in 2013 was a totally different set of people than the one my sister in law hired a year later from the same agency.  The crew we had did an excellent job, but the crew my SIL used had like three broken glass shelving units for like $1,000 of claimed damages.  Don't skimp and don't forget to tip.  These people are moving your life and your stuff.  Get pricing from 3-4 companies."

They will stop, ticket, and confiscate.   Best to think through things, especially where you are going to fire them off."
Dallas,3bjcly,CeleryStickBeating,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:40:30 2015 UTC,I would buy from Alamo and Black Cat personally when I was still buying because they have active YouTube channels and you can see what they're selling in advance.   I trust those two brands more than any other you'll see because they have a reliable product in the eight years I bought fireworks from them both.   Roanoke has 3-4 of them off of 114. There's some on 30 north of Rowlette towards Greenville. North of Denton on 35 has a few mom and pops.   Basically there's options about 30 minutes outside of Dallas proper in all directions.
Dallas,3bjcly,dvddesign,2,Mon Jun 29 18:54:09 2015 UTC,That is what I did the one year I was able to order from a vendor. Looked up each firework to see what exactly it did. Always hated spending $25 on something and it was nothing more than a huge fountain.

I would rather buy from an independent rather than corporate since John the owner backs up all his fireworks and only buys the quality stuff. His prices are better than the big outfits."

If you can get to the top of a parking garage it might be your best bet, since it will need a clear view of the airport area.

But, as someone else mentioned, you can sell and do it all again whenever you move back.  Pretty seamless transaction and they delivered/hooked them up for about $225.

Maybe you're confused because of people incorrectly referring to other nearby areas with these names.

Uptown is the area immediately north of Woodall Rogers. They are both on the west side of 75 in their entirety.

I suggested that until she finds what she was looking for in the area she might want to give COH a visit or two even though it is a predominately gay church (I'm non-religious and have never been but I just threw it out there). She absolutely loved it and thought it was one of the most Christian churches she had ever been to and decided to stay.

Dallas,3bckwl,im2Spooky4you,6,Sat Jun 27 22:58:36 2015 UTC,"Call the court!  Tell them you want to take defensive driving; they will tell you what you need to do. Usually you have to mail something in with your plea (no contest, etc.). You will have to pay an administrative fee of about $100+ to the court, plus whatever the defensive driving course costs. Then you need to NOT get another speeding ticket for a year, or you get fucked."
Dallas,3bckwl,tonictuna,4,Sat Jun 27 23:37:42 2015 UTC,I'm new to Texas but in other states everything you need is on the back of the ticket.   If you really want to check your options plan to spend some time calling around and asking questions. Be nice on the phone because it's not really their to help you.
Dallas,3bckwl,jonathan881,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:32:47 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the city because when I got my speeding ticket in Fort Worth I started the process by mail per the instructions on the back of the ticket.   Never made a single phone call, never drove the 40 miles back there to settle up the administrative costs + proof of defensive driving."
Dallas,3bckwl,lance713,5,Sun Jun 28 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"If you have a clean driving record, you can opt for differed adjudication. I got a ticket in Ennis county a few years ago and did this. Basically, you pay $180 as your fine and make an agreement that if you get a ticket in Ennis county in the next 90 days, both tickets go on your record. If you don't get a ticket (only in that county), nothing goes on your record.   Same outcome as doing defensive driving, but, IMO, much easier and about the same total cost (minus 8 hours of DD)."
Dallas,3bckwl,Smeegs3,2,Sun Jun 28 03:45:25 2015 UTC,"I have noticed that some county websites now have an option to pay online. I'm not sure if you can handle a plea that way, but it would be worth checking out. Otherwise, just call them. They will be able to tell you what the procedure is."
Dallas,3bckwl,babyvaccine,-8,Sun Jun 28 00:32:55 2015 UTC,"You sound like a very uninformed young adult but thats okay how else will we learn.... Honestly that officer shouldve given you a warning unless you had one before plus its officer discretion as well. You can either take it in the ass and pay the ticket, or do the defensive driving class, or hire a lawyer to get it to be lower or not pay the fine at all. Seriously hire a lawyer they can help you keeping that off your record. The other two options are still good but it doesnt clear off your record at all. Since you don't have much cash try asking your parents or maybe pick up an extra shift. It up to you if you want that on your record. Oh and one more thing, theres a points system too. If you pass a certain amount of points, (for me it was 3) its possible your license will be suspended until you pay the fee which would cost more than the ticket itself. Good luck dude.   EDIT: the people that you need to call is on the ticket."

Dallas,3bckwl,tonictuna,2,Sat Jun 27 23:37:09 2015 UTC,"Don't hire a lawyer, the types of lawyers who take these cases aren't very good. All they will do is go to the court and hope the cop doesn't show up and the case gets dismissed. If the cop does show up, they will sign you up for defensive driving. It is much cheaper to just plead no contest and do DD or differed adjudication.   If your are willing to pay the $500 for a lawyer, you are better off just going and pleading your own case. 9/10 the cop doesn't show up and the ticket gets dismissed."

And while I think Ted Cruz is a buffoon I do believe we could benefit from SOME kind of reform to the SCOTUS.  They are nominated by the President, generally to push their agenda whatever it may be, they are most certainly not without bias and if you read the dissenting opinions on the recent ruling, you may find yourself frightened to know these people have as much power as they do.

After DOMA was struck down we headed back to the U.S., and we were married the next month. I was so incredibly happy that I was allowed back home, and that my country finally recognized me.

Second, even with the Supreme Court's ruling, there's the potential that Gov. Abbott might try something to stall the procedure in Texas.

It was this way yesterday and it will be this way tomorrow. A judge is required to grant the waiver. Dallas recognized that they would be inundated by waiver requests, so they made judges available to hear & grant those requests.   Is there a little bit of ""hey, I want to be a part of this because I agree with the ruling"" going on amongst some of these judges?...probably.  However, it doesn't make what they are doing wrong, illegal, unconstitutional, etc.  by any stretch.  And, in case you needed any other reason, I think 55 years is long enough of a waiting period for these gentlemen."
Dallas,3b752j,FlightyTwilighty,9,Mon Jun 29 16:39:38 2015 UTC,"Well, the people who wanted to be equal didn't wave the waiting period for themselves or even ask for it, so I'm not sure how that can even be a part of your argument.

Dallas,3b752j,ImScaryTerry_Bitch,14,Fri Jun 26 17:48:42 2015 UTC,"Any district judge can wave the three day waiting period for any couple, gay or straight. So it's not different."

Dallas,3b7ob8,imyourdudeslone,0,Sat Jun 27 14:06:13 2015 UTC,"I understand the benefits aspect. It makes sense that gay couples want the benefits of marriage like visitation, etc... But Marriage is ordained by God, and God created marriage to be between one man and one woman.... So it doesn't make sense why a gay would want to get married... I propose the concept of legal unity vs marriage. Legal Unity means you have legal rights that are similar to marriage. And Marriage would be legal unity + spiritual unity before God....   ... Hope that make sense.   Thoughts?"
Dallas,3b7ob8,deadlysheepp,3,Sat Jun 27 14:41:56 2015 UTC,"You are arguing semantics. Marriage, in the eyes of the law, is a legal union between two people. The SCOTUS decision is about legality, not the religious definition of marriage.  God has no place in this argument.  IMO the LGBT community is fighting for their legal rights, not to change the closed minded views of religion."
Dallas,3b7ob8,imyourdudeslone,-2,Sat Jun 27 15:11:57 2015 UTC,Correct. I am arguing semantics. The law has just changed the definition of marriage. IMO the new definition of marriage according to the SCOTUS is wrong.
Dallas,3b7ob8,bigm0,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:28:55 2015 UTC,But marriage is a legal thing also I see that similar to saying atheists can't get married. If that is your religious believe you're allowed to believe that but it shouldn't be pushed onto people who don't. Why should gay people not be allowed to do the same thing as everyone else
Dallas,3b7ob8,Nymaz,-2,Sat Jun 27 20:21:38 2015 UTC,Not pushing anything.... Just reserving marriage for what it's designed for... One man one woman.   A moral line has to be drawn. The Bible establishes that moral line.   We wouldn't agree that a 45 year old man be allowed to marry his 11 year old nephew because homosexuals are now allowed to marry... Would we? Where do we draw the line.... What is the line we draw based off of?
Dallas,3b7ob8,imyourdudeslone,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:48:58 2015 UTC,"The line is drawn by what we as a society consider to be right.  It's constantly shifting.    It was once okay for a 45 year old man to marry an 11 year old girl, but not anymore. It was once okay to own slaves, but not anymore. It was once okay to segregate races, separate but equal, but not anymore."
Dallas,3b7ob8,Nymaz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:33:55 2015 UTC,"But Marriage is ordained by God, and God created marriage to be between one man and one woman.   How dare you limit God like that!  God has also created marriage to be between one man and one woman and any slaves that woman might own, one man and a couple of women, one man and 700 wives and 300 concubines (as long as they aren't foreigners), one man and his rape victim, or one soldier and any underage cuties from land he conquers.  As for your proposal, we already tried separate but equal the last time this whole ""people wanting equal rights"" thing came up.  It didn't work so well."
Dallas,3b7ob8,imyourdudeslone,-2,Sat Jun 27 15:30:43 2015 UTC,"In each of your biblical references, the men mentioned in each story were going against what God commanded them to do. The men were engaged in sin. The Lord was not pleased with Solomon having over 700 concubines.... The Lord was not pleased with Abram when he had sex with Hagar...etc.   Just because you see an occurrence in the Bible doesn't mean God was pleased with what happened. For instance,  it's a mistake to say God ordains murder because Cain killed able in the Bible.   Sometimes it's difficult to understand the Bible... It takes more than a shallow (I'm not calling you a shallow person by any means) attempt at reading to understand its incredibly deep meaning. It's a book meant to be studied vs casually read.   Make sense?   God (thru the Bible) has made it clear that an APPROPRIATE marriage is between 1 man and 1 women.  Separate but equal is a completely different issue."

They were on my side every time upon completion of their investigation.   They also have branches on nearly every corner.

There are two different kinds of marriage in the United States, religious and civil. Civil marriage comes with many positive tax conditions as well as general protections for the couples, (ie marital privilege). Religious marriages are regoinzed via the civil marriage system but are independent and having nothing to do with civil marriages.   People like Abbot think that allowing equality in civil marriages threatens religious marriages and he is right as I guarantee you this will lead to another supreme court case at some point. A gay couple will want to get married at a church and the church won't do it and it will go to the supreme court.   That ruling should go to the church but people worry that the justices will follow this ruling and say, churches have to regonize gay marriages too."

First, religious organizations are by definition not public businesses, and are thus provided numerous protections and exemptions not extended to virtually everything else. Secondly, if a gay couple is religious, chances are they attend a church that is welcoming of their status, and thus would marry them. Finally, I find the situation unlikely that a gay couple that is religious and wants to be married in a church that is not welcoming of their status -- really, who would want to tarnish their special day with that nonsense?  The reason there has been publicity about other places, like the wedding cake business, is because that is a public business and generally cannot discriminate -- now, depending on state law which would (or would not) expand protections to LGBT persons, that discrimination may or may not be legal."

A small town with two relatively major universities with the types of programs offered at UNT and TWU probably would appear to be a free-thinking town to some.   Until you remember that a lot of those ideals are being conveyed by the student body, and that the majority of the student body, if registered to vote, is probably not registered in that county. And that some of those ideals are conveyed by the faculty. Many of whom are likely not permanent and probably also aren't registered to vote in that county.   As a TWU alumna, I guess I'm one of only a handful of people who realizes that Denton county extends beyond the perimeter of the UNT campus. Most small towns in Texas are very republican."

This is Reddit, without revealing my name, my company, my anything, just know it boils down to me LEGITIMATELY being curious as we own 2,000+ units (b & c class primarily) in the DFW area and a deal near there, near Briarcrest (actually lobed an offer a couple years back trying to get that deal).

Edit: To expand, even cultured foods like yogurt and cheese don't need dairy. Just the cultures. In the same vein, ice cream can be made without milk or cream."

Dallas,3b1enz,ColonelMatrix,17,Thu Jun 25 16:40:04 2015 UTC,Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Armed robbery will get the mandatory maximum sentence in TX. Those idiots should have simply not used a weapon and they would be out of jail in 6 months. Now they will be enjoying secure max state prison in Huntsville.
Dallas,3b1enz,fowlkris87,9,Thu Jun 25 14:04:43 2015 UTC,"Aggravated robbery and burglary of a habitation are both first degree felonies in Texas. Minimum sentence for a first degree is 5 years, but it's a 5 - 99 year range.    They're going away for quite some time, I would think."

Dallas,3b1enz,ColonelMatrix,6,Thu Jun 25 20:34:35 2015 UTC,"The police may want you and the other victims to identify them. They may come around with a sheet that has six mugshots on them and ask you to circle and sign each criminal.   There will be a different sheet for each guy. Then you may have to do the same at trial, assuming they don't plead it out.   Texas takes home invasions very, very, seriously.  Burglary is a first degree felony even if there's no one at home.  The fact that you were there, they knew it, and still proceeded to rob you is terrrrrrible for them.  Multiple 1st degree felonies in the robbery, then using a stolen card just adds to it.  That's not as bad, I think it's a state jail felony - minimum 180 days up to 2 years and up to a $10,000 fine.  On paper that's at least 12 years just on the minimums."
Dallas,3b1enz,SH92,2,Thu Jun 25 20:43:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all that information! I need to get more info from the detectives because they've been specifically talking to my boyfriend and him and I haven't had the chance to discuss all the details yet. I do know my boyfriend asked if he would get the chance to testify against them and they told him yes.   I'm curious what I'll have to do since I'm all the way in Utah now. But god damn, if they get at least that time in prison I will be elated. They have so much shit sitting against them right now, I can't imagine them not getting a harsh sentence."
Dallas,3b1enz,fullblownaydes2,3,Thu Jun 25 20:53:02 2015 UTC,"If you're in Utah and the other victims are still in Dallas then I doubt you'll have to do much of anything other than the statement you (presumably) already gave.  You may want to have your bf tell the detective that you'll be back in town during X-Y date and you'd be happy to talk to him if he needs anything.  The vast majority of these cases get plead out before trial. That means that the person charged agrees to plead guilty in exchange for a set sentence that the assistant district attorney recommends to the judge.  That sentence is usually a fraction of what the max could be.  Here one person may be looking at 200 years max for all crimes.   ADA may offer 15-30 years to plead guilty. It's just a recommendation - the judge can make the sentence longer if he or she wants. It's a real roll of the dice going to trial with something like your case.  People really hate people who do this so it's not impossible, particularly if they have previous convictions, that serious 20, 30, 40, 50 year sentences get dished out.  It may be Dallas, but it's still Texas."
Dallas,3b1enz,SH92,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:01:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they all got a better look at the perps than I did anyways. So I know they'll be better at identifying them than I would be.  My mom works for the police here in Utah and told me they'll probably plea out. Which is fine, I'm prepared for it. I just really, really hope it'll be a decent sentence.

Take pieces of the onion and put it in the tortilla.  Now put pieces of chicken on the tortilla.  Add rice and beans into the tortilla.  Top it off with the green sauce. Eat and feel your life change.  Repeat process until food is gone.

Dallas,3b6lp4,Chreiol,3,Fri Jun 26 11:53:53 2015 UTC,"Dallas World Aquarium is really cool for kids. Its really more of a small zoo - it has everything you'd expect from an aquarium, plus habitats for other animals. Sometimes there is a sloth or toucans just roaming free inside (as much as sloths ""roam"" anyway). Its set up like an outdoor environment inside the building - its hard to describe, but basically, in some areas, it feels like you are standing on a path in a forest, looking down at otters playing in a river.   Reunion Tower is an often overlooked but worth seeing attraction - you can go up into its observation deck and look down at the city. (Reunion tower is the ""lighted ball thing"" in the downtown skyline.)  Also consider Klyde Warren Park for food trucks and sometimes music, ect in the park, or just walking around Bishop Arts - try Emporium Pies or pretty much any food place there, they are pretty much all good."

Not worth it.  Richardson has a nice library. So does SMU."

Capital, knowledge, law (leases and contracts), or real estate relationships if you don't have any of those then why would anyone consider you as a partner. I'm not trying to discourage you, real estate can be a very good investment. If you just want to make some extra cash by renting some houses out, you might find it difficult to find a partner because no one with capital will want to invest money with you for you to learn as you go."

I honestly don't bring anything special to the table, and don't expect anything special in return.  I currently own a single property and am working on a second, but earning enough capital to do so is taking some time, so this was just me hoping to find someone in a similar position.

It has been really rare where I haven't been able to get a table by not calling ahead.   People can probably suggest which places benefit from a reservation but most can be reserved online these days through OpenTable.   Don't skimp on a good steak.

I had a talk with a deeply conservative/religious aunt of mine once about global warming. It didn't seem like she so much didn't believe that climate change was happening, it was more that God's plan is not for the climate to collapse, and therefore there was nothing humanity could do to wreck the earth (only God can do that, in her mind). She believed no matter what we do to the environment, God's creation can clean itself and rectify any impact we have.   While this kind of thinking can also be religious agnostic, it couples with a lot of anti-science you often find in the religiously devout. The same aunt was the kind who thought vaccinations were poison the gov/big pharm is doing to kill people and she did not believe evolution was real. Young Earth, creationist type.   It's all very anti-science and the result is the earth is here for us to use however we see fit with no possible down side. And if that is not enough, how many of these types of religious people do you know who don't firmly believe Jesus will return on their lifetime and fix anything anyway? With thinking like that, why shouldn't you exploit the crap our of the Earth and live fat when the creator of all existence is just going to come down and create utopia any second anyway?"

Dallas,3awftt,IBiteYou,3,Wed Jun 24 21:43:58 2015 UTC,"Some info from their link,   BTEX Health Effects  Exposure to BTEX can occur by ingestion (consuming water contaminated with BTEX), inhalation (exposure to BTEX present in the air) or absorption through the skin. Inhalation of BTEX can occur while pumping gasoline or while showering or bathing with contaminated water. Absorption of these chemicals can occur by spilling gasoline onto one's skin or by bathing in contaminated water. Acute exposures to high levels of gasoline and its BTEX components have been associated with skin and sensory irritation, central nervous system depression, and effects on the respiratory system. These levels are not likely to be achievable from drinking contaminated water, but are more likely from occupational exposures. Prolonged exposure to these compounds has similar effects, as well as the kidney, liver and blood systems. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), there is sufficient evidence from both human and animal studies to believe that benzene is a human carcinogen. Workers exposed to high levels of benzene in occupational settings were found to have an increase incidence in leukemia"

I think the chances of survival are low even if it doesn't feed a turbine, considering the buoyancy of something like a gopro would probably cause it to grind against the walls of whatever conduit it is flowing in.

Of course you never think a medical emergency is going to happen to you but it's certainly not a waste of money. Thinking that you're never going to be in need of any medical attention ever for any reason and therefore don't need insurance is just bad reasoning.

I'll give you my example:  Beginning of this year had a shitty ass job, FT, that i had insurance thru. I was paying ~$70 a month for medical, vision, dental. (it was shitty insurance tho, not even concentra wanted to take it the one time i used it). I hated that job and was able to find something that suits my school schedule better but is only part time. Going to my husband's insurance is suicide, they wanted almost $400 to add me to his plan. And obamacare, cheapest one I found was $250 a month. Because i'm too rich to qualify for a subsidized plan but too poor to be able to afford $250/month.  Right now i'm just waiting for the fall semester to start to be able to be added to the UT insurance service they have that will cost me ~$125 month, that even then, will be cutting it close with my budget."

The best part was the pre-existing condition portion and  extension of coverage into adulthood. There are other good parts too, but in essence he ended competition between the insurance companies and people in your shoes got screwed. It's insanely expensive to carry dependents now unless your company foots some of the bill."
Dallas,3avztr,Skopos,2,Wed Jun 24 03:33:28 2015 UTC,"not really affordable   It depends though. If you're young, you get screwed by the rule that says insurance companies can't have more than a certain differential between policies for their oldest and youngest policy holders. Also, now we all have to pay for things like pregnancy and other issues that previously could have been left out of the policy.  I'm older, and policies on the exchange for me are about on a par with what they were before, and with my employer provided insurance. So I think as long as you're not young and healthy you're at least breaking even on cost, but coming out ahead in terms of preconditions, not getting bumped, etc."

There are tons of nooks and crannies to read in as well as a coffe shop. It's off Northwest highway and 75. Another favorite bookstore of mine is Lucky Dog Books. There are few around town but the coolest one is the one off Garland road. It has some awesome little rooms. It's open until 9pm I believe. I know you said no bars but The Balcony Club is super low key and they have live Jazz on Monday nights. The guys who play are prodigies from Booker T, the local arts magnet school."

He touted using data based instruction which is good but then required teachers to use non-researched based instruction techniques like MRS, DOLs, and other bullshit that just wasted time.   A lot of the 'achievements' he claims were fudged numbers.  There might be a federal investigation about his ""balanced budget"" as there is some questions about money missing from schools that state law required they have.   http://www.wfaa.com/story/news/local/investigates/2015/05/28/disd-budget-director-questions-misspent-at-risk-funds/28121153/  His largest achievement growth is sketch too. STAR test results largely stayed the same, gained little, or lost little.  http://www.scribd.com/doc/266280671/Dallas-ISD-STAAR-results  His Graduation rate increase is under investigation too. They passed kids who didn't even show up to class, lied on class codes, and any other things.   Low teacher vacancies at the start of school...They hired TFA people who are arguably unprepared to teach. They also hired ""Permanent Subs"" and said there are no vacancies when in fact there were lots.  It's been a while since I've followed some of this so I'm having trouble with some of the sources. However if someone is really interested I can dig them up. My hope is they actually bring in someone who is up to the job and not a crook.

At least, I've gotten a few comment about how ""I didn't know that"" when I was talking about it. Either way, it's annoying.   To add to that, when I'm in the left lane actively passing someone, going over the speed limit as is, and someone's on my bumper because they just can't fathom why I'm not going 20+ mph over the speed limit, thanks but no thanks. I'm not going to 1) go that fast because you want to pass faster or 2) slow down and swerve over behind the car, because that defeats the purpose."

Dallas,3asd2n,EdibleFeces,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:40:51 2015 UTC,"It appears that a lot of cars get in the left lane just to cruise   It's not that they are cruising, it's just that anyone familiar with the area knows the lane will slow down every 400 yards anyway.  No need to try to push 85 mph right now on 635."
Dallas,3asd2n,EdibleFeces,-5,Wed Jun 24 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"When there's traffic,  the left lane rule inhibits free flow and should be disregarded.  It's better to have a 3 lane road than a 2 lane road when traffic starts to congest.   Also if the car in the left lane is going the speed limit or higher you have no argument.  You aren't entitled to speed and put others in greater risk of harm.  Edit:  If you downvoted me you better stay out of the left lane during rush hour. Make sure all the lanes are stopped and the left lane is completely open and enjoy your extra hour on the highway."
Dallas,3asd2n,reddell,7,Tue Jun 23 19:28:43 2015 UTC,I think you're ignoring the fact that people are going to speed forever and always. Whenever you get in the left lane just to go the speed you want without actually passing anybody all you're doing is clogging the road. You're creating a dangerous scenario by forcing somebody to have to make an aggressive maneuver to pass you. Even though you could have gone the same speed in the middle or right lane. I strongly believe that with better left lane etiquette dangerous maneuvers like the one shown in this video would be reduced.
Dallas,3asd2n,brosenbra,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:15:03 2015 UTC,"No. If you're leaving the lane empty and there is congestion, that is going to slow everyone down much more. Do you get mad at people for being in the left lane during rush hour? Of course not, because your understand that it's necessary.  Think about how much traffic backs up when a 4 lane highway drops down to three lanes.   If the highway is clear then yeah, stay out of the lane otherwise it's better to utilize the extra lane.  Bottom line, I don't have to go out of my way to let others break the law."
Dallas,3asd2n,reddell,0,Wed Jun 24 06:03:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you, but I have actually seen cops turn their lights on behind somebody just cruising in the left lane. Then once the driver has moved over the cop turns the lights off to show them that the left lane is for passing only. I have even been with a friend who was actually pulled over for this (minus the fact I think they just wanted to search our car), but the point being left lane etiquette is a law too. Police are even starting to crack down on it. Check out this story that came out last week."

I drive between 80 and Marsh daily and have just set my cruise control to 65. It's not so bad when you realize that you're literally only sacrificing 2 minutes in order to have a stress-free drive.
Dallas,3asd2n,racazip,12,Tue Jun 23 03:37:17 2015 UTC,Once you reach 30 how do you maintain that 65 mph speed? You must be driving in off hours.

Dallas,3asd2n,StressGuy,15,Tue Jun 23 12:14:32 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you at all, but what I hate about drivers that do what you do, is that inevitably, you allow 50 cars to cut in.   It's trivial, I know, but everyone knows what feeling i'm referring to."
Dallas,3asd2n,ihateaggies,6,Tue Jun 23 15:19:28 2015 UTC,"If you were to watch the traffic around OP's car from above during high traffic periods (like from a helicopter during rush hour), it would look like a stone in a stream.  Water rushes around a stone and meets up again in front of it, and traffic will try to rush around a slower car to get in front of it.  It's not that other drivers have a problem specifically with how fast the one car in front of them is or is not driving.  They have a problem with other lanes traveling faster relative to theirs.  Using this 'traffic busting' technique makes your lane slower than the average speed of traffic when most people want to be driving at the average speed or above.  OP has several valid points, especially the safety aspect of it, but until every single person on the road starts driving the exact same way, driving like that is causing the cars behind him to drive slower than the average speed of the rest of the freeway."
Dallas,3asd2n,jaxsedrin,2,Tue Jun 23 17:30:56 2015 UTC,"driving like that is causing the cars behind him to drive slower than the average speed of the rest of the freeway.   I'd have to disagree, traffic busting is a mechanism to minimize your delta between the average roadway speed at the time and your own. Speeding up and heavy braking in traffic serve to make this delta very large, so you spend more time at 0 and 35mph than at 22.5mph for example. Take a look at this sinusoidal chart for example, and assume the x-axis to be average speed - the closer the line is to vertical, the more stress you put on your car when you then have to speed up or slow down quickly. Wouldn't you rather be represented by the left one?  The cars behind will not necessarily be going slower than the average speed, because in and of itself, you are attempting to drive at the average speed of the road. Of course when traffic is moving at sub-10mph speeds then this effect is not realistically achievable, but for other times it is a great mechanism and with some adequate music can make a rough commute fairly stress-free."
Dallas,3asd2n,only1parkjisung,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"If there is only one lane, yes, your reasoning stands.  But when there are adjacent lanes and the person in front of you is leaving a large gap in front of them, cars from those adjacent lanes will fill that gap.  This leaves more room for cars further back in those adjacent lanes to speed up (temporarily) and fill the empty spaces left by the cars leaving their lane.  If this happens once or twice, the change in speed is negligible; but multiply that by dozens (possibly hundreds) of times during a commute, and it makes a difference.  So the problem is not that the person in front of you slows down your lane to slower than average (well...except for the fact that they may be slowing down to maintain that gap for every new person that gets in front of them).  The problem is that the gap they leave in front of them causes adjacent lanes to increase their speed, which increases the overall average."
Dallas,3asd2n,jaxsedrin,3,Thu Jun 25 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"That last paragraph might be the best one here, but it seems like the general consensus of all the dissenters here is: Drive as fast as possible as close as possible to the car in front of you.   I personally don't like the sound of that. But yeah, that's how it is. Yay humans!"
Dallas,3asd2n,Shirkaday,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:11:05 2015 UTC,"There exists middle ground between ""drive fast as possible/tailgate to the extreme"" and ""drive significantly slower than everyone around you and allow everyone to get in front of you"".  My personal goal is to always match the speed of traffic around me, especially the person in front of me.  I try to keep enough distance so I have enough room to stop if something unexpected happens.  Will I be stopping so suddenly in such a case that causes the driver behind me to rear-end me? Possibly if they were tailgating, but that means the fault is on them and I can't control what choices they make.  And before we go down that road, there's no such thing as ""maximizing safety.""  Driving on a freeway is inherently dangerous, and there are other methods of transportation that are safer.  If you want to maximize how safe you are, you should wear a helmet and pads while taking the light rail or a bus to work. We choose to get on the freeway with vehicles and drivers that are a threat to us because it is convenient.  It's simply a matter of how people interpret their risk vs. reward.  Some people believe that getting to their destination 2-10 minutes faster only causes their risk of accident/injury to increase by a small fraction of a percent, and the extra hour or so of their life they get back every week makes it worth it."
Dallas,3asd2n,jaxsedrin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:02:03 2015 UTC,"I was able to run my vehicle on Texas motor speedway for a charity the last 2 years.  They consider it dangerous to drop back and give yourself room, they insist and will kick drivers off the track if they do not stay with the group.   Worst part of that is, it seems the slowest, most scared driver is usually the one up front so the rest of the pack of 10 cars on the track is going no faster than highway speeds.  Not the same, I know.. drivers on a track are there for a reason and should not slam on their breaks or have a mental breakdown causing them to do stupid things.  Real world traffic is.. well. . they don't call it defensive driving for nothing.  I still hate it when you let 1 or 10 cars get in front of you/me because you hang back, and i'm stuck with cars on either side and can't pass you up."

In my opinion, one of the key elements to absorbing the wave is NOT touching your brakes. (Unless you must) Just the slightest touch triggers the lights and the drivers behind you have no way of knowing if you are really slowing or not. In response they must apply their brakes for real to be safe. And the driver behind them must brake even a tad more. Dominos."

They actually leave space in front of them during traffic, don't cut you off when you try to merge, don't cut in front of a line of cars, etc. However on the flip-side they drive frustratingly slow sometimes and don't pay attention to when the light turns green, but I'll take that over the daily road-rage I use to get driving on 75 everyday."

I've also driven in multiple traffic conditions in Atlanta (many times), LA, Houston, Austin, and DC.  Dallas drivers are the worst. In my interpretation of my experience, Atlanta drivers go the fastest in open traffic, but they tend to handle jams more gracefully. DC and LA were just so horrifically clogged that nothing felt unsafe (except for motorcycle lane sharing in LA... Holy crap that's scary when you don't know it's coming). Dallas drivers are more aggressive about cutting you off in light traffic, and more sure that aggressive driving will do them some good in heavy traffic. 635 is the worst, but 75 is pretty awful too.  Fort Worth isn't as bad, but fewer lanes plus the increased prevalence of trucking and heavy duty pickups presents its own challenges."

Granted, I spend much more time in far North Dallas.    But in Atlanta, I found that driving the right 2 lanes out of the 6 available is the only possible way to go the speed limit.  From my experience, everyone veers off to the left as soon as they merge in, and that big cluster ends up under the speed limit.  Drove me crazy til I figured out you just stay right and don't follow the herd.  In L.A. I played a game of seeing not if, but when, somebody going slower would cut me off when I am going passing speed.  There's absolutely no lane discipline there, every picks whatever lane they want, goes whatever speed they want, and they change lanes whenever they want.  There's some of that here too but I don't notice it nearly as much.  In the Northeast, tailgating isn't even a concept, it's just normal following speed.  I actually like driving there, but you have to learn to drive like everyone else, which basically means be the aggressive asshole driver you were taught not to be.  Be very assertive in everything you do, don't take other people's actions personally, and traffic actually.. flows.  Whenever it can anyway, traffic is a total bitch up there at all hours.  I grew up here, so maybe I'm just used to people's tendencies here, but overall I find driving here to be more relaxing than most other major cities.  Or maybe I'm just one of those jerks :)"

Supposedly (because I don't believe it's backed by any kind of official research), this actually helps out the other lanes a little bit as it gives them a little bit more breathing room and helps equalize the lane speeds some.

Dallas,3asd2n,Johnnyis138,-2,Tue Jun 23 03:50:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're part of the problem. While you feel you're being safe, you're frustrating the hell out of the cars behind you, who are now trying to figure out how to get around you. Hence all this lane changing fuckery  causing even more congestion just because you won't keep up with the car in front of you.   If you want a huge gap in between the car in front of you, I hope you're at least in the very right slow lane. It doesn't matter if what you are doing is actually better, the perception is you're slow - and cars will start shuffling to get around you causing more traffic.   Clearly you understand this with your 'I'm pissing you the hell off' - you are the problem. It's not your job to teach others how to drive safe, just get the fuck out of the way if you're not keeping up with traffic. Or...just keep up with the car in front of you, it's not that hard (or unsafe)."

Dallas,3asd2n,Phl4w,-3,Tue Jun 23 03:56:17 2015 UTC,"The reason I stay close to cars in front of me is because all the morons will attempt to cut me off if there is even a hint of space between my front bumper and the car in front of me.  The reason I get aggravated with drivers like OP is because this isn't a perfect world. This is like making a post about holding the door open for people and saying thank you and yes sir and politeness and consideration. This isn't that world... so you either keep doing what OP does or you get more aggressive and do what you can to keep the assholes from cutting you off and making your day longer than it should be.  If I'm behind OP then I'm sighing and rolling my eyes because every time we pass an on ramp 5 cars get on in front of him and he slows down like an old lady. Now everyone behind OP has to be that much more late because OP thinks he's doing us all a favor by ""absorbing"". This is funny... and is a cause of backed up traffic. If everyone drove like OP then it would work... but they don't... so it's not helping traffic at all.  Another problem is with the geniuses who think changing lanes real quick when the lane next to them goes faster for a second and makes everyone in that lane slam on their brakes, accept for OP of course. For some reason people believe this helps them get to their destination faster.  The biggest problem with DFW traffic in my opinions is the people who insist on taking the on ramp all the way to the end and think they are entitled to get in front of me just because I'm the next one in line. If they just got over when there was space instead of flooring it to the end of the on-lane then traffic wouldn't be so bad.  tldr: I do everything in my power to pass or stay in front of drivers like OP. I don't let lane switchers over... and get enjoyment out of watching them  squirm when they can't... And I'll block the on-ramp lane towards the end while being half in my lane and half in the on-ramp lane.  I know I've got on-ramp blocking brothers and sisters out there... and I salute you for standing up against the on-ramping inconsiderate shits."
Dallas,3asd2n,Paladin4Life,-14,Tue Jun 23 15:16:20 2015 UTC,"Now here's the thing: The more you're on my ass, the more I'm going to slow down   I get it, but this passive-aggressive behavior is more likely to cause a wreck and put other people in danger when the person decides to start swerving between cars to get around you.  Just move over a lane and let the person pass, or maintain a constant speed until they can find their own way out if the former is not an option."
Dallas,3asd2n,dam072000,21,Tue Jun 23 05:01:04 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is, OP is actually doing exactly what every defensive driving video tells you to do."
Dallas,3asd2n,SuaveInternetUser,-10,Tue Jun 23 05:26:09 2015 UTC,Defensive driving courses only say to slow down if you cannot possibly change lanes to let the person tailgating get around you.  OP is pretending to be a highway vigilante.
Dallas,3asd2n,303onrepeat,16,Tue Jun 23 06:02:46 2015 UTC,"If there's one thing I would love, it'd be much, much stronger enforcement of the ""slower traffic keep right"" or ""left lane for passing only"" signs.   Defensive driving courses only say to slow down if you cannot possibly change lanes to let the person tailgating get around you.   If I am keeping pace with the cars directly in front of me, I am absolutely not going to try and force myself in to a full, slower lane, just to make room for you to pass. Putting on my turn signal and jamming my way in to another lane will only serve to screw up the pace in the both lanes as I try to match speeds, and now with a car on my ass I have yet another threat to watch out for.  There is no point in me effecting a risky maneuver just so you can get one car ahead. If you've become a major risk from the rear, I have no choice but to reduce my other risks (traffic ahead) by taking my foot off the gas some.  Left lane blockers? Please, go ahead and declare open season and I'll be there with you.  Tailgating because overall traffic isn't going as fast as you'd like? Screw off - there's nothing I can do.  Edit: correcting 5AM grammar."

Dallas,3asd2n,joshuacrook,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:50:32 2015 UTC,"Being a good driver doesn't mean you get to police other drivers.  It means scanning the crowd, ahead, behind, besides you, for several car lengths and lanes, creating a four dimensional model of traffic in your head, know where everybody is, know what they're doing, know what they're going to do, know how they'll react to what other drivers are going to do. Anticipate their moves and pre-empt rather than react. Sometimes that means making a hole for somebody either in front or behind you. Sometimes it means I have to give somebody lots of room in the lane next to me. Sometimes it's somebody clearly on the phone, waffling between the lines at speeds slower than traffic.  Could be sometimes it's a wannabe, gonnabe, cocksuckin', pussy-eatin' pranksta jerking himself of as he pretends to be the hero this city needs by ""busting traffic"". Fuck that noise. Sneak up on them, fake left, go right and leave them behind.  Leave the policin' to the police, get out of the left lane and let people drive."

As noted in this thread, the traffic busting link, and other traffic theory articles, typical drivers may regularly fill the large gap left by the traffic buster in front of him. This may lead a traffic buster to slow down. And the traffic buster probably also doesn't have the bird's eye view to ascertain the average speed of traffic ahead. It seems possible that the traffic behind the traffic buster and in the same lane may be more constant, but slower than adjacent lanes. I believe that I have observed this at times, specifically on 635."

There's more than enough places along the water to park and launch from. If you have onboard lights (an inexpensive accessory I hope you already have), it's pretty fun to be out on the water when the Mexican free-tailed bat colony beneath the Congress St. bridge comes out in the evening.  Other places in the vicinity - look into Broken Bow Lake/Beaver's Bend in southeast Oklahoma. It's an easy morning drive and full day launch with islands and hilly terrain.

Case in point: a few weeks ago, pair of brothers stole a police car in Ellis County and the negotiation of surrender took place entirely on the police radio.  The entire world was listening in on a broadcastify.com feed and, when one of the servers got the internet hug of death, DFW Scanner started pontificating about how it was ""for the best"" that someone took down that internet feed.  They seemed almost annoyed that the feed came back online and people weren't hanging on DFW Scanner's every social media post for more information."

Dallas,3atoey,Blakbeanie,2,Tue Jun 23 15:51:28 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the building would be surrounded on three sides by cemeteries, which are about as pastoral as it gets in the area."
Dallas,3atoey,legendia,7,Tue Jun 23 16:05:55 2015 UTC,"They worry that the two small streets won’t be able to accommodate the increased traffic that the apartment tower would bring.   I think this increase in traffic is a good thing.  We need to start letting go of our cars and using other means to get about.  I realize our non-car options still have a ways to go, but we need to start heading in that direction.    This particular building will have convenient access to DART rail, the MATA, and will also be within walking distance of plenty of shops and restaurants.  People in this area should be just fine not relying on their cars all the time."
Dallas,3atoey,dallasuptowner,0,Tue Jun 23 15:01:20 2015 UTC,Then build it without a parking garage. I agree in principle that this building could function without every driving to it but in practice at least now that isn't going to happen and Uptown is already overloaded with cars.
Dallas,3atoey,legendia,2,Tue Jun 23 17:36:06 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that we aren't there yet.  I'm not saying everyone dump their cars immediately, I just think that if you're worried about traffic congestion in Uptown, then maybe you aren't doing it right.  I don't expect residents in this area to not have cars, but I also don't expect them to rely on their cars 100% of the time either.  I suppose it's a bit difficult at this stage, since we are transition from a car centric city into a more urban/walkable one, but a change like that takes a long time before it works.  Uptown is very walkable, and has some decent public transportation options, but we need to focus on improving walkability and public transportation, rather than worry about traffic congestion in our densest neighborhood."

Dallas,3asb5m,nomnomnompizza,3,Tue Jun 23 13:22:28 2015 UTC,"As you try more of what's around here, you'll see that Deep Ellum cares more about marketing than making good beer. Peticolas strives to make a strong version of every style he does (no one in the state has a better IIPA than Sit Down, and overall they're my favorite in the area because of consistency from batch to batch. Full disclosure: I'm a volunteer there), Lakewood does some cool variants with the Temptress, and Collective got a decent sour going which isn't very common, especially given how Jester King is so far away."

Dallas,3asb5m,dearsomething,3,Tue Jun 23 16:18:11 2015 UTC,"BEER DISCUSSIONS ARE FUN LET'S HAVE A FRIENDLY DISAGREEMENT.  I think St. Arnold's Endeavour is the best IIPA/DIPA in the state. If you get the chance -- put a fresh one up against a fresh Pliny the Elder (masked or not).   As for regular IPAs: I'm giving that to Real Ale's Lost Gold.  I think these two are exemplary for the styles. Also, you point out something really important which is why I mention these two beers: consistency. So few of the new breweries (not just in DFW but also through out TX) are inconsistent. That's not a good thing. If you have professional equipment -- you better know how to use it (e.g., temp control), and once you commit a recipe to market -- don't fucking change it after 3 batches and then again after 4 and again until it's ""just right"". That ain't professional and it confuses people."
Dallas,3asb5m,air-,2,Tue Jun 23 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"Hi yes I'm interested in continuing this aggressive discussion about a consumable liquid!!!!  DR11 is actually one of my highest checkins on untappd... long time favorite but keep in mind the difference where fresh Sit Down is far easier to find up here vs fresh Endeavour. When Sit Down is not even a week old, it's no contest. And Pliny is a fine beer, but in today's context, there's many stellar iipa's so freshness is what wins the debate.   I'd say this for IPA... I don't remember how fresh Lost Gold tastes (best by dates are 6 months away from when it was made, rarely see it fresh here) so here's my preference:   Yellow Rose -and that's by an absurdly wide margin. Definitely one of the few world class beers made in Texas.  Meta Modern Nearly every version of Hops and Grain Greenhouse could go here, Mosaic or Falconer's Flight are crazy good Thrilla falls closely behind here."
Dallas,3asb5m,dearsomething,2,Tue Jun 23 18:26:43 2015 UTC,"Sit Down isn't made on a routine schedule though -- just when you guys feel like making it! Also, fresh (bottles) of Endeavour (and Lost Gold) are easy to find. The key is to avoid Spec's and Total Wine -- those types of places buy a shit ton in advance and stuff will sit on shelves.  If you want fresh (bottles) of Endeavour (when it is released -- I think quarterly) just head to Whole Foods Park Lane or Lakewood. If you want pretty fresh Lost Gold -- both those places and Central Market.   I enjoy Thrilla but haven't had Hops & Grain yet. I'm big on IPAs -- they are my go to.   However, I'm going to say something that is contrary to popular opinion (though, I'm not trying to be a contrarian) -- I pretty much hate Yellow Rose and feel very ""meh"" towards Meta Modern. I also think they both deviate from the traditional style of an IPA to be considered an IPA (Yellow Rose is just Pilsner malt with an absurd amount of aromatic Mosaic hops, and the MetaModern is a session IPA if I'm not mistaken). The Yellow Rose is nothing but smell. There's no malt backbone -- nothing carries the hops. To me, there is literally no flavor. It's just Mosaic and 6.5% alcohol. And even the mosaic fades as soon as you're done smelling it.  But this also brings us right back to your earlier big point: consistency. While Yellow Rose tends to be consistent, and a few of the beers from Oasis tend to be consistent -- both breweries suffer from inconsistency problems.  Bluntly: there are no real routinely available IPAs from DFW I'd consider top notch. The ones from here are good -- but not great. The Peticolas ones win the IPA category (for me) for local IPAs -- but again, if I'm not mistaken they aren't always brewed on a routine schedule (e.g., make room for Great Scot, Wintervention, etc...).  So when I need a tasty ass IPA—that I know will be good and the same as the last time I had it—and I want it to be from Texas I go straight for Real Ale.  BEER DISCUSSIONS ARE FUN.  EDIT: I didn't want to imply inconsistency, so I rephrased ""routinely"" to ""on a routine schedule""."
Dallas,3asb5m,air-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:45:55 2015 UTC,"All fair given production schedule, totally get the context now and you are correct. I'm just glad you didn't respond freaking  out over Mosaic hops since the people I know who don't like them also say cilantro tastes like soap... I totally can't relate.  Overall, I'm not into super punchy/hop bitey ipa's and prefer the floral and freshly squeezed citrus combo. Lost Gold on cask opened me up to that a long time ago and I tend to just assume that a beer on the shelf is old unless explicitly stated by a buyer. No shocker that Waide at Park Lane would have that nailed down properly."

After a while IPAs start to taste the same because that seems to be the first beer on rotation for new breweries. Then again you can't start out with 10 beers and expect to succeed! Maybe I'm just tired of IPAs for the moment.  I saw where Deep Ellum Co won some gold at Best Little Brewfest. Their Coffee Ale (and here I am crapping on Ales lol), IPA, and Barrel Aged Four Swords (the example I was shooting for on what makes them a little different. Plus their normal Four Swords).  My favorite beer right now is Blood & Honey. Easy to drink in the sun and I saw it at sale for $6.99 on Total Wine over the weekend!"
Dallas,3asb5m,air-,3,Tue Jun 23 04:05:59 2015 UTC,"Community does both coffee beer and barrel aging better than DEBC. You need to try Ascension coffee porter and BA Legion.  It's no secret that I do not like DEBC and honestly do everything I can to sway support away from them; I haven't bought a beer from them since the IPA started getting canned and it tasted different on five separate occasions. Completely unacceptable for a production brewery. That was over two years ago, on top of all the other PR crap they pull."
Dallas,3asb5m,nomnomnompizza,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:31:35 2015 UTC,What PR other than the Blonde goes down easy thing?  At least you are honest about a bias. I still use light beer as a cheap alcohol delivery on occasion so I am capable of trying anything ha! Hard to say Community does barrel aging better when you have never tried BA Four Swords though.  What else from Peticolas should I try (again possibly) other than the IPA?
Dallas,3asb5m,air-,2,Tue Jun 23 04:41:59 2015 UTC,"Saying I'm not willing to pay means exactly that, and their beer still gets poured at festivals/shares, so that still means no monetary loss on my part. I'm not sure how you reached the conclusion I've never tried a below average barrel aged quad; I've tried nearly their entire lineup minus whatever is brewery only and I have the impression I'm not missing anything exciting. There's too much good beer out there.  Two big examples of poor behavior:   Raising a huge fuss way back when the taproom/distro laws changed, which exposed that they were clearly looking to cash out on distribution rights  The accusation of pay to play against Scotch and Sausage. The bar all but said ""we're not gonna take the financial risk of selling your inconsistent product, so thanks but no thanks"" and DEBC decided to whine about that in public.   My personal favorite beers from Peticolas are Wintervention, A Lost Epic, and The Duke. Great Scot, Royal Scandal, Golden Opportunity, and Alfred Brown are each stellar examples of their respective styles. Sit Down and Thrilla are both top tier locally made ipa's.  And if you like sours, you definitely need to try more from Community, they're all about going wild as well."
Dallas,3asb5m,nomnomnompizza,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:36:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I assumed you hadn't tried anything of theirs in two years when you said that.   I'm not in tune with the beer politics, but how is it bad exactly that breweries don't want to pay a middleman? Last I saw politicians who were being paid by these distributors are the ones trying to make it an even sweeter deal for the middleman.  Scotch and Sausage? That place that existed for a few weeks and from what I read management had no idea what they were doing. At least they are getting things turned around with a new concept. Wasn't it actually illegal to do the pay to play? I'm no familiar with how all that works.  Thanks for the suggestions, and this friendly beer debate!"

I know other people are much more versed in them, I just shake my head every time I hear what a brewery is and isn't allowed to do, and what they are and are not allowed to take money for."
Dallas,3asb5m,nomnomnompizza,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:28:14 2015 UTC,I thought it opened last summer.  Breweries can make all the money they want as long as the distributors and their lobbyist get a cut for doing providing a useless service!
Dallas,3asb5m,air-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:31:54 2015 UTC,"I don't like either S&S or DEBC :) the whole thing was a massive face palm and overall, these little things impact how the scene is perceived by outsiders. It isn't good. Beer politics is a whole new can of worms, and the one consistent thing DEBC does is make a fuss and piss people off, both within the industry and in the general public! Drink whatever you want, the main point I'm making is to inform people that these things are happening."
Dallas,3asb5m,asstheet,3,Tue Jun 23 14:07:35 2015 UTC,it's cool how a thread about beer can have the most relaxed and respectful debate this sub has ever witnessed
Dallas,3asb5m,Toni826,2,Tue Jun 23 15:52:01 2015 UTC,"I'll drink anything, but sours and wild ales are by far my favorite. I'm a sucker for anything brewed with Brettanomyces. If I can't find that, I'll usually go for an IPA, particularly ""juicy"" IPAs or IIPAs/DIPAs. In general, I like trying uncommon styles/experimental beers/variations/collaborations, but I haven't seen too much of that around here.   From what I've seen, Deep Ellum has a pretty standard line up (e.g. an IPA, a pale, a stout/porter, blonde, etc), which makes sense for Dallas, but not anything that has really impressed me. I'm not a complete beer snob, I promise."
Dallas,3asb5m,Id_fuck_your_mom,4,Tue Jun 23 04:44:58 2015 UTC,"The best place I've found for sours around here is Strangeways on Fitzhugh.  It's my go to bar!  I also like craft and growler a lot, but they don't have much in the sour department."
Dallas,3asb5m,nomnomnompizza,2,Tue Jun 23 04:48:51 2015 UTC,"Strangeways is one of the best, if not the best beer bar I've ever been to! I've been meaning to get over there more often, but that requires an Uber ride to and from because whenever I go, I just get way too drunk enthusiastic. I just picked Craft & Growler because they have a pretty decent selection, seem to have plenty of space, and it's relatively close to my place. If this thing gets off the ground, I definitely want to hit up spots all over DFW."

People are generous to post local findings, so when various whales hit shelves they post about it almost instantly.  There are a lot of sour fans in the group."
Dallas,3asb5m,PMall,2,Wed Jun 24 17:02:57 2015 UTC,Four Swords is what I usually hype up from them. Numb Comfort on occasion too. Both may not be your cup of tea though. Apparently I like the fruity/earthy beers haha! I'll stop hyping them up!
Dallas,3asb5m,Wylard,2,Tue Jun 23 05:01:01 2015 UTC,"Bottle shares are the way to go for wild and sour around here since it's just not a strong point for DFW area brewers. But that's totally fine when looking at it from the standpoint of a startup brewery avoiding an outbreak and inconsistent beer. We don't have anything like Jester King or Night Shift, and locally, you and I are in a tiny minority as far as flavor preferences for funk/sour.  Otherwise I'd keep an eye out for special tapping events. Funkwerks and Destihl seeing distribution here are both huge additions for sours. Real Ale also makes amazing sours and the likelihood of running across them at a bar is far greater than a Jester King tap."
Dallas,3asb5m,nomnomnompizza,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:51:45 2015 UTC,"Sours are slowly starting to come around.  Collective Brewing has their Petite Golden Sour which I'm really digging. Real Ale and Martin House both put out a gose last year in addition to the other sours Real is doing. Someone else did a sour IPA that I can't remember now.  Not a ton, but there are a few starting to pop up."

If you want a sample of the best the area has to offer you need to go to LUCK at Trinity Groves.  They have 40 beers on tap and every one of them is brewed within 75 miles of Dallas.   The whole Trinity Groves area is fantastic, great food and drink.   The other area to hit is Lower Greenville Ave, in Dallas.  There are a row of great bars/restaurants. A couple also have huge tap lists, but aren't exclusively local like LUCK is.   Lastly there are a few Meetup groups in the area for craft beer, although I haven't been to any of the events."

I guess the rain soaked down, expanding the deeper soil and then with the top few inches drying out it just broke open.  Crazy.  All of Texas needs to learn to use water more conservatively.  We keep making them babies and everyone outside of the state keeps moving in.   Yet it is not likely we're going to get more rain annually."

Dallas,3awy32,nomnomnompizza,-7,Wed Jun 24 06:21:55 2015 UTC,So where do we store all this excess water? In people's yards? We do not need to be conserving water right now.  The more usage the better. Crops are being ruined and people's livelihoods are rotting. We really don't have any where to save water for later.
Dallas,3awy32,roselotus88,5,Wed Jun 24 06:49:18 2015 UTC,The last I heard was that we are not totally out of a drought  because the aquifers are not recharged. So keep conserving water.

As a husband of a pregnant woman due in three weeks, I try to bank my good deeds in hopes that my fellow DFWers will repay the favor when she needs it and I'm out of town.    I remember a young latina pulled into the gas station at 635/beltline with a flat tire.  Despite being late for something I had no choice but to change that tire.  Come to find out this young lady was crying in her car while I changed her tire.  I tried telling her it was okay and shit happens.  Come to find out her father had passed away the day earlier.  She was upset that she didn't have him to get her out of situations like this anymore.    Something to consider.  So many of us here in DFW are transplants from somewhere else and have no father to call or friend to help.  Don't assume the next person will always help.  Kudos to OP for recognizing a good deed."

Thank you for being a kind stranger to that lady that night.

It's a little sad how many guys can't change a tire for a lady who needs help and seeing cars get towed for that sort of thing seems like a waste of $ and time . I'll just respond to the inevitable comments now. Yes I do think it's a bit more of a ""man"" responsibility to both stop on a road and change a tire for someone else."

Basically it's the same service as the dedicated Park and Fly services.  The hotels are just leveraging their existing lots and shuttle vans to make a few extra bucks.

It sucks because I have no personal vendetta against the guy - he's a beagle freedom advocate and I am too, and I get being frustrated by the aggressive homeless in Fair Park/Deep Ellum (I've been yelled at, had things thrown at me and damn near mugged).

It was about a 10 minute walk from work and everyone else I worked with loved it. But the service was almost consistently always bad and the quality of the food declined over time - sandwiches got smaller and more expensive, ingredients would change randomly, things like that."

Dallas,3anymy,azwethinkweizm,3,Mon Jun 22 17:27:45 2015 UTC,"303 Bar and Grill in Bishop Arts is the worst for me.   I went there once for lunch with my wife on a rainy day and there were maybe 3 other tables filled, you could just tell it was a slow day for them. So we sit down and place our orders with the waitress and it takes ten minutes to get our drinks. Then another 10 for our appetizers and another 40 for our food. So apart from the slow service the food was barely warm and just was not good, probably because they served them on cold plates. My wife had the burger and was really surprised by it being on a ciabatta bun. I don't think they understand that chewy bread doesn't go well with ground beef. I had the New York strip steak, it was so thin and overcooked, I ordered it medium, it was like eating card board. Waitress only checked on us once and that was to give us the bill. We thought about dessert but the service and food were so bad we didn't want to spend another second there, but we spent another 15 minutes after I paid just waiting for the change. I paid with a $100 bill because I forgot my wallet and my wife only had that and a twenty in her purse, the meal for the two of us was about $45. We had planned on getting extra drinks and dessert to up the bill but like I said we just didn't want to be there any longer. So after the 15 minutes the waitress come back with with forty dollars in ones and the rest in fives. I just couldn't believe a restaurant in Bishop Arts would not have a couple of tens or twenties for change! I may be over thinking it but it seemed like they did that out of spite for paying with a large bill. The attitude from the waitress the entire time was really off putting as well, like we were bothering her for being there.   I'm sure they are a nice bar to just get drinks and hang out, judging by the amount of people there on the weekends, but I will never go back."

I don't want to go into too many details, but there was a recent death in the family, and now this dog no longer has a home.   Right now, the pooch is in Nashville, but family will bring the dog back to the metroplex if a good home can be found. So we'd really love to find a home for this girl instead of the alternative since unfortunately, the only family members left cannot take her in.  If you or anyone would love a new and furry addition to their family, please PM as soon as you can. Thank you for any help you can be Dallas!

Dallas,3alph5,TheUltimateNeckBeard,-5,Sun Jun 21 18:34:11 2015 UTC,A reminder that we need harsher DWI penalties for sure.
Dallas,3alph5,tonictuna,8,Sun Jun 21 16:01:52 2015 UTC,"I mean they are already pretty harsh. First DWI will cost you around $5,000 for a decent lawyer and if you get convicted you'll spend around another $10,000 in fees and fines plus losing your driver's license and a ton of community service...that's if you avoid jail time.   Third DWI in Texas results in a felony and mandatory jail time. Unfortunately it seems that no matter how harsh the laws are...people will still drive drunk."
Dallas,3alph5,ScarHand69,6,Sun Jun 21 16:09:30 2015 UTC,That can be said about a lot of things.  People will always break the rules for reason or another.

Dallas,3alph5,joshuacrook,-1,Tue Jun 23 04:11:31 2015 UTC,"It would be extremely rare that someone gets jail time as their first offense. Lawyer cost shouldn't really be factored into the punishment. Not everyone loses their license either, and even ones that do can typically drive during a 10-12 hour period of their choosing each day once they go through the administrative process blah blah. And you're typically looking at about 40 hours of community service. Pretty easy. The first offense is purely financially punitive, and just a big inconvenience."
Dallas,3alph5,tonictuna,3,Sun Jun 21 17:05:07 2015 UTC,"No.  If you have money for a good lawyer this might be true...  And so the inclusion of lawyers fees.  If you live paycheck to paycheck, you're going to start with a good month in county.  So... Paycheck to paycheck is about 30k/y. 12 months per year = $2500. If your employer is super understanding. They won't be. So let's say you do a month, get out and have no job. Ok, no biggy. You start your job hunt and find work in a month ($2500). But chances are this has also cost you another 5000k-10000k in late fees, being evicted for non-payment, finding a new place, having to pay a larger security fee to hookup power, etc. because of your lapsed payments.  It's going to get rough w/o some money already in the bank."
Dallas,3alph5,SuramKale,-2,Sun Jun 21 18:29:26 2015 UTC,"You forgot the $1000 per year for 10 years? drivers license fee.  So, all told it could cost you $50,000 in lost wages an fees/fines."

Dallas,3alph5,biffbangboom,-2,Sun Jun 21 16:40:50 2015 UTC,"Well, that's when you'll be using video evidence to assist in your case. That clause is in the law because a DWI in Texas covers drugs and alcohol, so ""not having the use of your faculties"" is relevant."
Dallas,3alph5,tonictuna,5,Sun Jun 21 17:06:24 2015 UTC,"How often is video evidence possible?. Texas is a big place, there's not that many cameras around. And placing the onus on the accused to prove their innocence rather than the accuser to prove guilt isn't how the system is supposed to work.   Or should everyone now install dashcams to protect themselves?"
Dallas,3alph5,biffbangboom,-2,Sun Jun 21 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"Uhhh the officer has a dashcam. That's your evidence. They will be using it if you are being charged under that portion of the law anyway. They have to. But it ""gets lost"", case dismissed.  *Edit: A word."

I always thought ""disobeying a traffic control device"" was what you got when a cop had to write you a ticket, but wanted to be nice about it (no points, reduced fine). I once got pulled over doing 15 over the speed limit (it was one of those really nice, wide roads where the speed limit seemed abnormally low) and got one of those tickets. I'm not sure it even made it on to my record.

We like walks and parks. We just want a safe place to live.  In the past five years she and I have had our vehicles broken into numerous times (and one vehicle was stolen). We've heard gunshots at night in nearby neighborhoods. Seen drug dealers selling to kids at a nearby middle school. Heard numerous reports of murders, muggings, etc. in our area.

I just use common sense and avoid the spotty areas at night and only ride my bike during the day or with another person/group. My neighbors watch out for me and I for them. I also have lived in Exposition Park and The Cedars. Each of those places ARE fairly scary however, I never had any issues outside of a bike being stolen once. I honestly cannot think of anywhere in Dallas that I would feel A-OK at night unless you get very far North almost into Mckinney."

That's a very large area, of course Dallas much more so, to just slap a label on.   Balch Springs and Mesquite are not as big as Garland of course.  You really have to look at areas down at the neighborhood level.  There are pockets of great living next door to some pretty sketchy areas all over the metroplex.  Even the cities that you said you prefer have sketchy neighborhoods in them.  No offense taken."
Dallas,3apysi,joeylopex,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:41:24 2015 UTC,"Like I said, you can find good in anything, so you can find bad in anything. I personally find that part of town to be places that I don't like. I don't like them for multitudes of reasons. It isn't like it's because they are the ""bad side"" of town. I Garland is huge and my number one reason to dismiss it is having to drive in it. There are parts of Garland I like but I wouldn't want to commute to the Shops from there. I drove from Mesquite and the Murphy/Sachse (where my boyfriend lives) to the Shops area for several months. It was awful. I just stated what I personally thought, given that I work in the same area and now live in the same area, I didn't list my reasons and wasn't asked. I actually almost bought a house in Mesquite. It isn't always awful because of the people inside of it."
