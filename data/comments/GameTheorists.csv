NASL is where not MLS caliber players go or young players looking to make a name go to find a way to MLS. Players can move. Teams don't. The USL looks like the never-was league of soccer in the US. Though it looks like the USL has a D2 league and a D1 league.  Further, in USL, there is not forced relegation (according to the wiki page) and the last team to switch divisions was in 2009 and folded after moving divisions (side note as a native of Cleveland, I have never heard of that team and am not surprised is failed). Also if no one knows you exist it is hard to casually reference them in a video like this.  The point still stands. ESPN mainly (occasionally a British soccer game shows up at 3 am) shows sports that don't have relegation in the US and MLS is included in that statement."

GameTheorists,3dn46v,shaboozeybot,8,Fri Jul 17 16:51:00 2015 UTC,"My $0.02 definition of a sport  A sport is an athletic competition defined by the following characteristics:   The contest is physical in nature, and requires a high degree of physical prowess and athletic ability, which is not readily or naturally attainable without dedication and practice.  (Poker, chess, spelling bees, etc = not sports) The contest is judged according to verifiable, quantitative measurements, and is never arbitrary or subjective. (Snowboarding, skateboarding, cheerleading, etc = not sports) The ""common man"" argument, such that an average person on the street (or even a hobbyist practitioner) could not compete in any meaningful way against a professional. (Bowling, pool, etc = not sports)   Don't get me wrong, though, I like bowling.  I'm in a 9-ball pool league.  I think cheerleading is hard and physically demanding.  I used to be a complete skate rat in college and watch the X Games most years.  But I don't think of these competitions as ""sports"", and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I think trying to force our way into the big-boy's club with e-sports will do more to damage the genre than it will to enhance it.  After all, the big-name promoters and endorsements are rolling in just fine, the fans are coming in droves that regular sports can't even envision, and there's already a worldwide influence for the pasttime without the US's help.  The WSOP is almost a punchline by this point, depending on who you ask, and I think it has a lot to do with the way that ESPN tried to shoehorn the competition into its traditional, staid, and proven marketing style and look, despite the audiences with their other sports having almost no overlap at all with poker's fans.  E-sports are cut from the same cloth.  You can't market them to regular sports fans, and absolutely not by using their already established methods and platforms.  Twitch is the ideal place to televise e-sports, and its notoriety is growing yearly."

It's not difficult these days to get a custom build pc, drivers and all installed, and just start gaming on it. Pc is also more popular these days if you look at the raw statistics. The only reason consoles are still the face of gaming to many non-gamers and uninformed gamers is because of the marketing budget and because of the amount of advertising they show on traditional media.

I hear my gamer friends complaining that people are posting about a match on facebook, and mock them.   It's amazing the similarity of the two groups arguments against each other.  But, imagine the outrage that some gamers would show if a football game was televised on Twitch. It's the same thing as showing eSports on ESPN. It's just a different market, and diffrent types of people.  ESPN probably would be well served to televise eSports from an advertising angle, but I think they'd lose a lot of confidence from their core audience, so it may not be worth it.   Then again, ESPN is filled with all sorts of stupid day time shows and reporters who can't report, so maybe they'd be better off getting rid of those guys an replacing them with a new program, and viewer demographic.

GameTheorists,3dg2v9,Xattm15,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:37:55 2015 UTC,"I think one important thing that we should take consideration of is canonicity. If we're arguing that Mario is canonically insane, then we can only use the canon games as proof. All evidence found in the non-canon games wouldn't make sense to use.  The problem is that Nintendo has never come out and said which Mario games are canon and which aren't, and thus we don't have a firm system in place to decide whether future games in the series are or are not canon.  Now if we can compare Mario's canon to the confirmed canon of the other Nintendo franchises where some form of canon has been discussed, maybe we can extrapolate from that which of Mario's games are or aren't canon. For example, we've been told that Metroid Prime Pinball isn't canon, so maybe that means Mario Pinball Land isn't canon. And if Metroid Prime Pinball isn't canon because it's a ""sports-themed"" spinoff, then maybe that would make the other Mario sports games non-canon.  But the Zelda series is probably going to tell us the most about canonicity. It has games excluded from its official canon because they 1) weren't made/supervised by Nintendo (e.g., the CD-i games), 2) they weren't released worldwide (e.g., the BS Zelda games), 3) they were released on non-major Nintendo systems (e.g., Zelda Game & Watch), 4) they've been rendered irrelevant/obsolete by later ports and upgrades (e.g., the original Link's Awakening), 5) they have no story (e.g., Link's Crossbow Training), or 6) they have insufficient connection to the main series (e.g., the Tingle games).  If all Mario games that fit one of these six categories can be excluded as non-canon, that drops a LOT of games from the franchise's canon, including some that may have otherwise been included in the theory that Mario is mental or that there's two Marios. Depending on which criteria we use for determining canon, the sports games may not be canon, the Mario vs. Donkey Kong games may not be canon, even the original Donkey Kong game and its sequels may technically not be canon.  So if the games that would otherwise prove that Mario is a sociopath are non-canon, that would certainly save the plumber's reputation."

GameTheorists,3df745,Kitsyfluff,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:33:10 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, it could be theoretically possible. Though... It would be... Complicated. Megaman is a robot, after all. It is said to fire balls of concentrated solar energy, which I do not believe is possible unless it's somehow transformed into plasma, or something else that isn't solid, liquid, or gas that can stay in one mass while traveling a fair distance as a projectile. Even then I am not sure on the logistics of firing pressurized balls of plasma. So I got nothing."

GameTheorists,3dchnt,lukethiel,3,Wed Jul 15 04:51:12 2015 UTC,"The problem with a Gman theory is that there isn't any back story on him. That means that literally any theory on him is correct. As far as the games tell us, Gman is a benevolent person (who's name isn't even Gman) who watches Gordon Freeman go through the events of half life, and then hires him from ""his bosses"". Other people's theories: -Gman is a government worker, hence the name Gman. -Gman is really Gordon Freeman -Gman is Gabe Newell -Gman is God -Gman serves God Honestly, the list goes on. You just pick your favorite and move on, or make up your own. It's not like the Pyro's gender video, where he uses scientific evidence to determine what the Pyro is. MatPat is a person of many resources, but the Gman was meant to be speculated upon."

Either Way i don't think this Theory Can hold up at all, ill give u 3 reasons, (1) this is considered a ""Fantasy"" game, that will explain the Pig men (From, i think Norse mythology)  and the skeletons and zombies, look at final fantasy, they have all that, (2) Villagers are alive, think about it, every time u see a village u see the poor guys being eaten alive by zombies, =( if a zombie apocalypse did happen, don't u think all the villages would have been rushed by zombies, left in ruins? like Seriously, i saw a villager die, by falling, they are idiots, and u expect them to survive a zombie apocalypse??? (3) Every other mob alive, don't u find it weird that other mobs are living too (u know like after the zombie apocalypse) me too, i thought they would have all fled or BURNED in the Chaos that the zombies where causing...

This is his job, so something popular will actually get him paid. That's why so many channels are doing it. I enjoy Mario theories and Metroid as much as the next guy, but those retro games aren't gonna be bringing in the views. Fnaf and GTAV will."
GameTheorists,3db80b,RiddlerFish,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:56:38 2015 UTC,"Really? He doesn't need to become more mainstream to keep the food on the table and the lights on. Look at Super Best Friends Play. They have a tenth of the subscribers, four people to pay and they do LPs so they need to buy the game, not just rip footage from the internet and they play all kinds of retro, indie and out there games. Or Cr1tikal who has a fifth of the subs said he could live off of what he makes from youtube and he plays stuff like pepsiman and titty simulator.   You can't say he needs to be mainstream, as soon as he uploads a video he probably has a few hundred thousand hits and it could be about anything. Add to the fact that he gets money from sponsors to shill them at the end of every video and the fact that companies will pretty blatantly pay him for advertisement (remember when he said reality check would be a recurring show but didn't even use it since, probably because Ubisoft gave him money to make a 17 minute long ad for it), it is delusional to think that he needs more mainstream. You say that he needs to do it because everyother youtuber does it. He can stand out more if he did retro and unknown things.   How about this fact, for all his 115 game theories he has done only 49 unique franchises. That's just over 40%. He has done 11 Mario theories, 8 pokemon, 5 FNaF and 6 LoZ. That is 30 videos out of 115 done on the same 4 games. Repetition is important but there is too much of a good thing. He can afford to diversify and to be less click bait-y and do more math and history stuff. He can afford to do stuff other than these few games. But he doesn't."
GameTheorists,3db80b,PM_ME_YOUR_SWORDS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:08:36 2015 UTC,"What I meant by that was more people are gonna be searching for GTAV or FnaF stuff instead of Super Mario World or LoZ. That hundred thousand that watch it as soon as its released is his subscribers, but if he does something with Fnaf or GTA, he will get slightly more views than something like Metroid, because they're new, and more people are searching for it.  I'll give a channel example: Achievement Hunter: They play Minecraft every Friday because it's a very popular game, its basically open world, and they can do whatever they want. The second they stop releasing Minecraft videos, they will drop subscribers because ""n0 moar minecraft"" is being released. If they did a Fnaf video every week in its place, they would get Fnaf fans watching instead of the MC fans. If they did Metroid or an old GTA game (say GTA 3) every week in its place, they probably wouldn't get as much of a subscriber increase.  So I guess what I'm saying is he's releasing videos of newer games because the newer games are being searched for, which will get attention from people that aren't subscribed. He will obviously release videos of older games because they're interesting and have a lot more depth than some of the newer games, but that will only really attract people that are subscribed (or are a regular viewer) instead of random people in the wild."

The two also spend most of the ""debate"" about what art is.  Like...what was Mattpat's point about Ludonarrative Dissonance if it barely applied to TLoU.

The faux debate sets up an unconcious expectation to the viewer of a resolution which always ends in an anti-climax.  If the show is going to end open ended, the format of the presentation should encompass that.  An alternate could be to reverse the direction. Start both sides at zero and build up points on either side of a board (kind of like Pro/Con list).  At the end of the video its then clear for the user to decide and ponder, especially if the arguments are summarized and put on opposite sides of a tally board.

No, it's just been a growing frustration of mine since people have been calling ""Clickbait"" for lots of videos lately, so you happened to touch on a sensitive subject and it weighs really heavy on my mind. But the things people don't get are...   Titles like ""Link is Dead,"" Mario Timeline's Shocking Reveal,"" and ""The Strategy of Sex Appeal"" are what the video is actually about, and yeah, the video might have a sexy girl on the thumbnail, but that's actually IN the video.  That Let's Players saying things like ""SCARIEST GAME IN YEARS!"" and ""FUNNIEST MOMENTS EVAR!"" are incredibly baity, but people give them a pass for whatever reason. Why shouldn't you title a video with something that makes it exciting and gets it clicks as long as it's still honest to what the video is about? I could say ""The Psychology of Color in Video Games"" but that's a REALLY boring way of phrasing what is truly an interesting subject. And at least it's not ""The 7 Things You DIDN'T Know about Color in Video Games"" 'cause that's just obnoxious.   Long story short, I appreciate you coming back to reply.

GameTheorists,3d19ni,MatPatGT,2,Mon Jul 13 00:01:52 2015 UTC,"The reason I fell in love with GT in the beginning was principle: your show had it. Yes, there were tits in the thumbnail, but the video was actually about tits in games. Yes, ""Link is Dead?"" is sensational as all hell, but the video was actually all about that, and didn't just touch on it for 5 seconds as a tangental notion halfway through a 10-minute video, as is commonplace with ""clickbait"" content.  It may be tongue-in-cheek to the point that it turns a lot of people off, and yes, the constant need to capitalize words that don't need to be capitalized is grating as fuck, but that's come to be expected of YT culture in general. I firmly believe you have found a balance that works, and that the Game Theorists channel does not ""clickbait"", it moreso ""click entices"". At face value, I completely understand the problems people have with your channel, but at the end of the day the quality is there, the entertainment value is there, and simply put: the fun is there. GT is a very consistent outlet of informative, engaging, and entertaining content, and that's what your job as a content creator is, and I think you pull it off, with style to boot.  After all, theories (conspiracy-oriented or not) are meant to be a little outlandish, a little sensational. They're meant to instill a sense of wonder, curiosity and excitement, as well as intellectual stimulation. GT accomplishes that in droves, and I believe the ""clickbait"" in this context is just a means to do the theories themselves justice. Exclaiming ""Link is Dead!"" might sound ridiculous to someone at first, but then once the evidence is laid out for them, they themselves will be exclaiming ""Holy shit, Link is dead!?!?!?!"" Game theories in principle are ridiculous, awestriking, and fascinating all in one, and Game Theory itself upholds that principle, and for that I believe it should be commended, not condemned.  As for this video, I won't say what I think of the sensationalism or allegations of ""clickbait"". Unlike some, I'm actually going to watch the video before developing an opinion on it. Because I believe that I, as a fan of your content and a fellow game theorist, owe you that degree of impartiality. And that's no theory.  btw tell Ronnie the world needs more Digressing & Sidequesting ASAP"

These collaboration episodes are good for both channels as some of your subscribers go to them and they come to you. Thanks to one of these colabs I found my second favorite youtube channel Cinema Sins (the first is GT) and I've been introduced to a bunch of new content I would not have seen before and now I am going back and watching them all like I did when I found you.  One question, since you know so much about youtube algorithms I was wondering if youtube takes into account channels you link to when suggesting channels. Does the youtube algorithm notice that more subscribers of yours going to, say, Cinema Sins and vice versa?  I have noticed that on channels I don't view after one of these joint videos it seems I start to get recommendations from that channel.  In any case I say keep these kinds of videos coming because eventually I am going to make it through all the videos from Cinema Sins and I'll need someone else to follow.

Pac-Man and Tetris became culturally important because of their elegance. Sure, they were limited by the hardware of the day, but there are lots of ways to produce inelegant or downright awful games even on that limited hardware (take a look at some of the dreck for the Atari 2600; it wasn't just limited to the well-known E.T. case). Tetris, while it had been created several years earlier, rose to prominence (in the USA, at least) during the NES-era, and even that console was capable of much more complex games, yet it became a hit because of the elegance of the game play that could be grokked even by moms and dads."
GameTheorists,3d19ni,bubba0077,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:12:18 2015 UTC,"I think the best argument against pacman was left out of this debate.... mainly, that it can be 'played' by a computer just as functionally as a human can, and if we can't actually see who is playing the game, it's hard to to whether what is happening on the screen is a human experience, or a bunch of code being solved by another bunch of code. When The Last of Us is played by a human, there's a will to explore the environment, to connect with the story, while when it is simply being played, it turns into a series of simple 'puzzles' and collect-a-thons with moments of killing other NPCs. In other words, can an experience be art if it can be completed the exact same way a human would by something that isn't sentient? Or is the art of pacman in the player experience, in the act of playing the game, rather than in the game itself?"

GameTheorists,3d1v83,JehovahDovah,5,Sun Jul 12 21:09:54 2015 UTC,"There was a context to that part. Mat had said that the artist's interpretation is important and Pacman has limited actions so therefore is close to the artists interpretation. Jared said that the beginning and end are always the same and Mat said, kind of questioning him, ""So the middle doesn't matter?"".   He wasn't saying that the middle doesn't matter, he was saying that the middle of the game can take different paths so therefore the artist's message can get changed, making it less artistic and that Jared's point that it starts and ends the same way is kind of neglecting the middle."
GameTheorists,3d1v83,MichaeltheMagician,-2,Sun Jul 12 22:27:12 2015 UTC,"Even with the context, Matt had implied that the middle doesn't matter. Even if he said the middle does matter, the argument would still be invalid because the game is very interactive making you feel like part of the story, on top of that, I'm pretty sure there is more than one ending, making it possible to actually effect the story, which would mean the middle does matter making his argument even more invalid. Even if there aren't more than one ending, the argument is still bad."
GameTheorists,3d1v83,MichaeltheMagician,4,Mon Jul 13 00:52:59 2015 UTC,I think Mat was being sarcastic when he said that. Like he was using Jared's logic to prove how flawed that argument was.   I don't know. It's hard to put into words but in general I kind of agreed with Mat Pat for the general argument. I feel like saying The Last of Us is a more artistic game is kind of cheating because most of the points that make it so artistic are in cutscenes while the gameplay parts are not really anything special. I feel like The Last of Us is like an artistic movie with a normal game attached. Whereas Pacman is all game.

They tried something new, and it failed.  Oh well, same happened with Reality Check.  I personally think Matpat overloaded himself.  He started a ton of stuff in 2015 like Deadlock, Reality Check and most notably Film Theory.  I'm not telling him to stop being ambitious, but I think he ought to slow down a bit and take things one step at a time.  Ease yourself out of the comfort zone of Game Theory, don't leap out."

I think any amount of content, ESPECIALLY that high of quality, works for everyone. May I remind anyone who reads this that it's YouTube, not a TV show, so it doesn't have to have a specific schedule. And may I also add that this is MatPat we are talking about, at the risk of sounding like a fan boy I'll say he is probably the best content creator I know when it comes to running a channel as well as he does (analytics wise). That being said, these other, newer shows probably have a reason for being so stretched out. Not to mention the obivous hard work that is put in to them with the other youtubers, and the editing (I mean, did you see the video of them editing game theory for like 10 hours or something?), and the other unbeleivably cool reality check stuff like tanks, SWAT teams, and planes?

GameTheorists,3chc4b,caboose001,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:23:32 2015 UTC,Nah they say it's the only way forward. You do get choices throughout the game but... They're never exactly good choices.
GameTheorists,3chc4b,mrpinkiller,4,Wed Jul 8 04:39:22 2015 UTC,"First off I give my sincerest apologies, as it's quite late at night where I am and the argument I am attempting to put forth may not be quite as cohesive and cogent as I'd like it to be. With that said, here are my thoughts on the matter regarding whatever meaning there may be behind the game. Keep in mind this will be full spoilers, so if you haven't played the game I recommend not reading, or understanding that the payoff of the game will be ruined by reading ahead.  This has become quite longer than I originally expected it to be, so I apologize for my extended and (likely) unintelligible argument  The lack of ""good"" choices in that game is what made it beautiful. Being forced to make those decisions and live the repercussions is a far more powerful tool in an interactive story (which I believe this is, rather than just a video game [although one could make the case that most if not all games are interactive stories in one regard or another, but I digress]) than simply living out the actions in a cutscene which you have no physical control over. I'd imagine there's a stark difference between the reaction one's mind has to watching a horrific act being committed and witnessing the horrific results of an action one was forced to make.   Take the phosphorous mortar, for example, and then subsequently being forced by the narrative to walk through the destruction that you yourself the player have wrought upon so many innocent lives. Even so many years later (its been so long since I've played the game) that scene sticks out in my mind as one of the most intense and emotionally effective scenes in gaming. Many times all they (the developers) do is include these moments in generated cutscenes and force us, the player, to watch them as these characters commit whatever horrific acts they are inclined to commit in the situation.  What the phosphorous scene does, however, is give the player control over the situation, and first provides the assumption that the target you are about to bomb is in fact the enemy. Being a high octane, ""lets kill the baddies"" player we are inclined to perform this action without a second thought. Fast forward five minutes and we are faced with the results of the now-unconscionable action we the player have just committed.   Through the course of the game these unconscionable actions slowly wear away the resolve and mental fortress of our protagonist Walker, and at the same time our own resolve. Slowly we see in action the cause and effect, catalyst and reaction within minutes of each other. The horrors Walker and co. see throughout the game result in a heavily broken man by the end.   We are presented in the beginning of the game with a high-octane chase scene, and almost immediately transition to a situation where we are now in full control of our character's movements and actions. I believe that Walker either lost consciousness and entered a comatose state or is simply dead and reliving the events of his life with a twist.   As we, Walker and player, make our way through his recent memories, we are faced with many horrendous acts that Walker himself committed. And most of the time, we don't have a choice in the matter (except for very few Catch-22 scenarios where neither option is favorable). And through this entire time, mind you, we are living the memories of Walker through his own subconscious. Something that has firsthand witnessed the atrocities he committed.  Over the course of the game and the more and more things he does that psychologically impact him, his companions begin to question his judgment more and more. This could be the embodiment of his own doubt in his actions, which we the player are now experiencing (we are controlling him while his subconscious is acting as commentator via the conduit of his companions). Walker is in his own ""Hell,"" whether the spiritual Hell or just the hell of war. His companions, and by extension of the previous thought his subconscious, now believe his judgment is (was?) not the proper judgment even though we as player are unable to select another option.  That last thought can be used as further evidence to support the ""unconscious/coma"" theory in that we are not given the choices because we do not have them. We are just living out the memories of our broken protagonist. We can't actually decide anything other than what he has done, which is why later on in the game we are faced with the dissent from the companions. Walker has committed these actions and cannot change them but desperately wishes to do so.   And this brings us to the climax of the game. Depending on our choices throughout the game we are met with four options (via Wikipedia's summary of the plot): we die in two of them, and ""die"" in the other two. The first response leaves you the player dead, either at Konrad's hand or your own. The second leaves you shot by the patrol, and Konrad speaks a quite interesting line.  The last two, however, give us much more information. In the third ending, Walker drops his gun and is driven back through the city by the soldiers. They ask how he survives, and he says ""Who said I did?..."". The last, which occurs if you manage to kill all of the soldiers before they can shoot you, is that Walker picks up and uses a soldier's radio. He says ""Gentlemen, welcome to Dubai."" This is the first line he says in the game to his companions.   These responses give us a plethora of insight into his mental state. The second and third, should he truly be in a coma and reliving these events, are two diametrically opposite endings, and will be examined separately.   In the first response, Konrad brings forth a very interesting thought. Walker and Konrad were having a conversation about the war in Afghanistan. Walker comments how he'd just like to go home. Konrad says, ""Home? We can't go home. There's a line men like us have to cross. If we're lucky, we do what's necessary, and then we die. No... all I really want, Captain, is peace."" This last part, about wanting peace, is the most important of the quote. It's strange that this is the quote Walker remembers of Konrad, because it directly relates to the concept of him being in a comatose state and reliving his actions. All he wants is to break out of the cycle, to stop reliving the actions. He doesn't want to deal with the horrors anymore, he just wants to be at peace. He thinks of this as he is dying in a pool of his own blood, perhaps finally giving him some escape from the Hell he'd endured. I'm sure there's something to be said about why Walker wouldn't have killed all of the soldiers (given that there is a separate ending for that, to be discussed shortly) but for the time being lets just operate under the assumption that he wanted to be shot, so that he would finally be released from his private Hell on which we have also accompanied him.  ""Who said I did?..."" This response is by far the more ""positive"" of the two. He does not shoot the patrol that found him, and follows them back. He accepts that the acts he committed were necessary (or not necessary but accepts that they have been committed and cannot be changed) but does not let them define him. He doesn't let them take control over him, and ""kill"" the rest of him, whatever broken pieces remain.   In the second response in which he lives, we see a truly broken Walker trapped in his actions. There are two possible interpretations of this phrase in particular.  By utilizing the phrase ""Gentlemen, welcome to Dubai,"" he begins the cycle again. And again. And again. He sets himself on a path where he cannot bring himself to accept the actions. He believes himself to be a monster, a cold-hearted or perhaps disillusioned soldier. Throughout the course of the game we have played, and the story he has experienced, he has decided that he does not want to be saved. He believes himself to be condemned for his actions, and thus kills the patrol there to save him. He believes he deserves the proverbial Hell that is his life in Dubai. This is why he repeats the first phrase as his last.   ""Gentlemen, welcome to Dubai."" This could signify the above, or it could be heavily implying that he wants his experiences back. He wants to keep the knowledge, to change the actions he's committed. He wants to revert back to the beginning, replay the game.   The game is heavy on the theme of repetition. The action throughout the game is the same: aim shoot move, aim shoot move. The choices are made regardless of what actions you take, and how many times you try to revert them. The achievements require multiple playthroughs, multiple experiences of the hell Walker went through. It wants you to replay the game, because it wants you to relive Walker's experience. It wants to condemn you to suffer the same emotional consequences as Walker did (albeit to a lesser extent; serving in war cannot be replicated, I'd imagine).   I guess what I'm trying to get at is that the lack of choice beautifully enhances the experience of living through the recent events of Walker's life. We don't, and shouldn't, have a choice, because these are just the events through his eyes. We have to live through Walker's own personal Hell. His Hell is Dubai, his experiences, his emotions. Depending on which ending you believe is canon determines what Walker's end is, but there is also something to be said about that. This is the only choice that we as the player are fully given in the game. We get to choose the ultimate fate of Walker. Do we want him to relive his hell, or do we want him to finally escape into sweet oblivion? That is the only choice left up the the player, and is what defines this game as not just a video game, but an interactive story with a powerful message. You and only you have the power to condemn him or save him from himself.   This is probably nothing close to the amount of research MatPat puts into his theories, but it's just my $.02."

In the single player campaign you are going deep underground to the underwater caves that the octolings live in. The sea level has risen so high that Inkoplis is the last bit of dry land.  So if we are going deep into underwater caves I think the noses are the new sea creatures that dominate the ocean cause squids and octopus are no longer living in water

For example Cyrus tries to capture Dialga and Palkia in both the anime and the video game, neither refrence that he attempted to do this once before (once where Ash and co stop him) and again when (Pokemon Trainer from Platinum stops him) There are other examples but the anime is an adaptation of the video game which is not direct canon. : )  My theory only uses video game sources. Regardless, it is only a pet theory I felt like sharing, I am sure it has holes in it if 1 were to search the lore of the game hard enough to flat out disprove it as it is based on no in game dialog.  Also this theory has no chance to be on the Game Theory channel. : ) as it does not have the ability to show any real world science to the video games."

So fast that is literally a blur or even forgotten all together and next thing you know your at the poke-center.  Like if you saw a dangerous wild animal, and needed to bolt in the middle of forst.  You may remember the wild animal and what it did but you wouldn't necessarily remember the path you took and what you did just that your heart was pounding, and you were running as fast as you absolutely could.

GameTheorists,3botya,shaboozeybot,19,Tue Jun 30 22:58:41 2015 UTC,"I don't normally find fault with Mat's theories, but I have one this time.  Sure, having a hot girl on screen will slow your opponent's reaction time, but will it not also slow your reaction time?  It's not like you can't see your own character.  The only way you would probably be able to overcome this is by being unattracted to women.  So, 1st, sexy women are not an advantage to those who are attracted to girls, and 2nd, women, who are more likely to be unattracted to girls will therefore gain a chunk of that 200ms advantage that seriously outweighs the 20ms disadvantage.  Now I don't know if those reaction time studies have been tested while isolating homosexuals or transgendered, but as Mat points out in his theory on the gender of TF2's Pyro, sometimes this conditions flip where people of a given sex fall in these sort of comparative tests.  If it doesn't, and males have faster reaction times regardless of sexual preference or gender-identity, then the best players would be gay guys; neither attracted to the coquettish combatants, nor hindered by the dampened female reflexes.  Oh, and there's another way to overcome this handicap: Practice.  If you play enough rounds with enough characters in enough costumes, then all of them fall subject to habituation. You grow accustomed to the cartoon naughtybits, and just focus on the game mechanics."
GameTheorists,3botya,verdatum,8,Wed Jul 1 00:58:12 2015 UTC,"My argument would be where the player focuses on-screen. When you play a fighting game, does a top player train his eyes on his own character? Or the opponent? I know when I play a racing game, for example, I look way down the track.   I imagine it's similar for fighting games, focusing on your opponent's moves and placement because by that point you only need fringe vision to know where you are and you've already memorized your own moves."
GameTheorists,3botya,KazMcDemon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:35:11 2015 UTC,"The second issue is that both parties become habituated. Since both players have been exposed to the costume numerous times they would already be habituated.  Every top player has seen the costume for hundreds of hours, they aren't going to look twice."

GameTheorists,3botya,blond-max,4,Wed Jul 1 12:34:24 2015 UTC,"Wait, so the reason you argue that it should be in, is because reaction times for guys will slow?  If anything, this can be completely reversed. Those of us not into women have a much larger tactical advantage. Wouldn't this be seen as game-balancing to counter girls (or, according to the video, whatever little advantage they have) and gay guys having an advantage?  Not to mention, using an opponent's sexual thoughts in a fight of skill? is it only me who thinks that's the scummiest thing you've ever heard?  I've never played this game, and don't particularly care about this issue at any level. but, to say this change unbalances the game is sorta nonsensical in my mind. It's favouring one balance over another. But, to try to use sexual stimulus as a weapon seems like a really scummy, dirty and creepy thing to do.  It'd be like a Chessmaster using a bikini-clad chess set to put off his opponent in the finals. It wouldn't really go down well."

GameTheorists,3b428h,projectb223,7,Fri Jun 26 07:59:14 2015 UTC,"Some serious fact checking is needed for the League of Legends example.  The game last year had Blue and Purple as the two main team colors. Only recently did it switch to Blue and Red, and even then the post game stats still refer to the Red team as Purple team. Players now even have the option of opening up the game settings and turning on relative color or color blind mode to permanently set Blue as the player team and Red as the enemy team.  In addition, MOBA games have always been plagued with an unfair side advantage due to the camera angle and onscreen HUD elements. Unless you're Heart of the Storm which is North-South agnostic, the side closest to the bottom has a significant advantage simply because they have to fiddle with adjusting the camera less. This side advantage has also been claimed to be a 55/45 split (or at least close to it) in favor of the bottom team, which makes the color advantage even more questionable.  RTS games would have been a more apt comparison for color because while directionality does give a slight advantage, RTS players have to constantly fiddle with the camera anyway, and are more prone to use hotkeys to force the camera to move to differing locations so it sort of cancels out. Using Starcraft would have been an interesting comparison because Terran and Protoss units lean more towards Blue, while Zerg uses Purple and Red. If stats were checked for all three, and Blue continued to have a significant advantage, the information about blue being a calming and creative emotional subconscious affecter would be much more plausible."
GameTheorists,3b428h,brokenstyli,12,Fri Jun 26 04:58:43 2015 UTC,"the colours in league do not affect the winrates. its more to do with the better camera angle in blue side (they dont have to scroll down as much due to the camera tilting backwards show more things in the distance on the upper side of the screen).  then blue side also has an easier time warding for dragon as they only need to place 2 wards to close off all entrances to dragon, wheres purple has to place 3. this is the opposite for baron, but the team that is ahead will usually get the baron by that point in the game.  not to mention that blue side also gives you the first pick and ban, you set the pace of the game from the start. blue has the ability pick the most op champion in the meta or best champion for their strategy unless the purple team bans it. so blue can save an immediate ban in order to pick the champion themselves.  this is why when 2 teams of equal skill in league play each other, blue side wins. for example, tsm vs c9 lcs summer finals 2014 where blue side won 100%.  tldr; although the colours may impact the winrate of a balanced game like tf2 or ut04, league isnt a balanced game. this is why the winrates have a huge disparity."
GameTheorists,3b428h,CosmicAlian,-1,Thu Jun 25 20:49:12 2015 UTC,"additionally, isn't your own team always blue on your own screen in league? The color disparity only shows in spectator mode. Therefore, wouldn´t the psychological effect not be there for the players?"

GameTheorists,3b428h,tehfurst,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:28:20 2015 UTC,"I think that it could potentially have an effect on pro gamers, especially in MOBAs (I only play DOTA, so this will be from a DOTA 2 POV). Winning a MOBA comes down to 2 things: strategy and 'plays'.   I do not think that colours could have an effect on strategy- pros are far too experienced to be affected by subconscious messages when they have a long time to think through the strategy.   However, I think the colours could have an impact on split second decisions. Part of why pros are so good comes from the ability to make split second decisions based on lots of stimuli: like whether to go in for a 1v1 kill. They have to think about so many different things in a short space of time to make the choice, and they have to rely upon their experience to make this choice. I think that perhaps, team colours could have an effect here, in the tiny space of time where the brain has to make a choice, subliminal messages will probably have more of an effect. This means that the red team might play more aggressively in situations like this, and the other team more defensively (maybe tipping the game in someone's favour depending on the meta)."

GameTheorists,3b428h,TheRealM_,2,Fri Jun 26 09:01:42 2015 UTC,Just going by the expisode name and thumbnail I expected a theory about the Web series Red vs Blue
GameTheorists,3b428h,drjos,2,Thu Jun 25 20:39:32 2015 UTC,"While I agree with most of the theory, the explaining on League of Legends is misleading and doesn't really make sense.  That's a harsh claim, I know, but let me explain further.  The side win-rate disparity in League is a known issue. There are many theories and reasons given from many different people,  but let me present the 2 in my opinion most reasonable ones:   The Map is NOT symmetrical. MOBAs in general want to have a symmetrical map, so that both teams have the same distance to every objective on the map.  League does a great job with that, with one exception: Dragon/Baron. I'm not going into too much detail, but Dragon and Baron are 2 really important Objecitves that are not equally important. At different stages of the game they are differently important. Not going into too much detail, but you can explore the map here for yourself. You can clearly see, both teams have a different distance to dragon/baron and also a different way to them. It may be easier for one team to secure one objective depending on which site they are on. You can't rotate the map by 180° (yet). This means basically, you have to play with this fixed camera angle. I personally don't have a problem with this, but many of my friends complain, that blue side (bottom left) has an advantage through that because blue people can look more up than red people can look down (Because of the angle, AND because of the Interface that is blocking the view, which is at the BOTTOM of the screen).   So these were issues with the map that could (and most likely do) cause win disparity.  Another reason on why the psychological effect of colors have no effect to winrates in LoL, is because there are options specifically for that reason.  If you want to, you can choose that whatever side you play on, your team is always visually blue and the enemy team is always visually red. I know I use those settings, and most of my friends do, so it shouldn't have a strong effect on winrates for one side.  The last fact I want to throw out here is, that it doesn't matter on which side you are on, your HP bar (the most important bar for you) is always the color green (yellow when using colorblind mode) and your teammates HP Bars are always sorta blueish. So there is no reason to unconsciously feel more aggressive or impulsive here.  And the same goes for enemies HP Bars, they are always red, doesn't matter on what side you are on.  tl;dr: Yes, there is win disparity in LoL, but no, not due to psychological effect of colors. Colors are swappable on both sides to match user preference and team hp bars are always blue, enemie hp bars always red.  Win disparity most likely comes from Map not being 100% symmetrical"
GameTheorists,3b428h,Raebe_LS,3,Thu Jun 25 22:12:22 2015 UTC,"basically what I came here to say, but I'd like to add that since the league data seems to come from pro-games it is also important to note the innate advantage you get from having the first pick/turn in any game"
GameTheorists,3b428h,TheRealM_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:26:11 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add, that last season, lane swapping was common as well. Iirc, it held different advantages for different teams."

GameTheorists,3b428h,Elusive2000,2,Thu Jun 25 22:44:32 2015 UTC,"Not only is the map imbalanced, the fact that the UI of most mobas is located on the bottom is a hindrance to skillshot accuracy, which can make a massive difference.  Another thing that is league specific (does not apply to Dota, HotS) is actually that formerly, introductory bot games were solely on blue side. Thus, newer players would have more experience on blue side. This in no way affects players at the highest levels (LCS, Worlds, etc.), but it definitely skews winrates through the process of leveling up.  Last but not least, during the LoL match itself each team views itself as ""blue"", with the enemy side being red, so the color theory is completely irrelevant. Thus, LoL is balanced with regards to color, but not in experience, mapping, or skillshot accuracy"

You always play as blue one vs the red ones. Only for spectators the colors are fix with blue bot and red top. The regular winning of the blue side results from different reasons. First of all, the vision is always slightly from bottom to top, so you play easier from the bottom side of the map to the top, as you can see a bit further in the direction of the enemy. Others are the slightly asymetric and the ban and pick order before the game starts."

GameTheorists,3b2cf7,Cityman,5,Thu Jun 25 12:12:57 2015 UTC,"I am so glad someone has finally posed this question. Cryomancy is something I've thought considerably about. the problem at it's core is exactly what you posed, what happens with the thermal energy here? For the sake of simplicity we're going to examine these possibilities through the scope of one basic spell, Lower Temperature. As we know energy cannot be created or destroyed so we need to evaluate possibilities to remove thermal energy from the targeted area. You could try and move the thermal energy from the targeted area to the area directly around the chilled area but this would cause a bubble of heat around the cold area and doesn't fit the bill as I see it. You could teleport the thermal energy to a different place on the planet but that seems to fall into teleportation magic rather than a magic based around thermal energy so I'd discard that too. The other way I could see this working is through transmuting the energy into a different type, we see this happen in the real world constantly, electrical energy becoming thermal energy in a transformer is just one such example. So lets look at the thermal energy again, what can we change it to? If we changed it to kinetic energy there would likely be something of a small explosion at the site of the spell and no such phenomenon is seen. Electromagnetic energy runs into the same problem, as it would cause a visible glow. To find our culprit we need a form of energy that cannot be observed, or so we would think but the spell can be observed if someone were to cast sense magic. I believe that the thermal energy is transmuted into a magical energy that is different from the mana used to cast the spell."
GameTheorists,3b2cf7,Caleb_Aurion,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:12:32 2015 UTC,"I believe that the thermal energy is transmuted into a magical energy that is different from the mana used to cast the spell.   This all sounds very good, but then how do you explain that a caster's frost magic can get stronger regardless of the temperature around them?  If you needed the thermal energy to change into frost, shouldn't the damage it deals be heavily dependent on outside temperature?"
GameTheorists,3b2cf7,Caleb_Aurion,2,Thu Jun 25 22:10:57 2015 UTC,"There is really no such thing as cold,  there is only hot and not hot because cold is the observation of a lack of thermal energy, cold energy doesn't exist. Therefore for cryomancy you need to remove the thermal energy, transmuteing the thermal energy into a magical one makes it so there is less thermal energy for you to sense. The magical energy itself is not cold."
GameTheorists,3b2cf7,quwertie,2,Fri Jun 26 03:38:57 2015 UTC,The mage sucks the thermal energy out of the target (maybe conjuring some water that freezes) and leeches it into themselves as magical energy.
GameTheorists,3b2cf7,Caleb_Aurion,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:39:23 2015 UTC,But an ice spell/beam/wave can miss.  How can they create something that requires their target if the target avoids it?
GameTheorists,3b2cf7,quwertie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:11:57 2015 UTC,My main issue with this idea is that if it were true cryomancy would not cost magical energy to cast but rather charge the mage like a magical battery.

GameTheorists,3b2cf7,xxAnge,2,Fri Jun 26 04:06:55 2015 UTC,"I always pictured it like what it is in The Last Airbender. It's more of manipulating the water/hydrogen in matter, and fitting it into more of a fixed zone, then ""throwing it"" where you want it to go. Like it's shown in the show, when they were in the desert, where it's more dry and has a much less major concentration of hydrogen in the air, it was harder for them to get water. When they got it from the cloud, it pulled all the hydrogen that formed the cloud into a much smaller zone.   So essentially they would take the hydrogen out of the air around them, making the zone form more of a liquid or solid, than gas, with what I could assume would be carbon getting pushed out of the zone, or using the carbon as a type of fuel i guess to ""fire"" or ""cast"".  Just my theory. I have a very limited grasp of science in general, all I know coming from public high school. So I could be incredibly wrong in all forms."
GameTheorists,3b2cf7,xxAnge,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:16:51 2015 UTC,"It's a good guess, but I think it's off on a few things.  In AtLA, it's controlling water on a molecular level.  You're manipulating a state of matter.  With ice attacks, it's a reaction from your beam or spell that's making it colder.  The question is: how?  If the frost power can ""tell"" particles to slow down, this is a very cost-inefficient attack.  After all, if you can manipulate virtually anything on such a level, isn't there far more destructive things you can do then give them frostbite?"
GameTheorists,3b2cf7,Shad0phe0nix,2,Thu Jun 25 22:16:30 2015 UTC,"I think the reason that in the case of cyromancy in video games, it doesn't manipulate at such molecular levels for the sake of balance. It would be cheating to be able to, say, start a chain freeze on the inside of a persons body, when pyromancy doesn't get to do that same thing.

The dark thing is that you can't die; all games I have played have a death screen, or well, anything. Even Minecraft has a ""you have died"" screen before you respawn. So I ask you, why if, lets say, you fell off a partcore area (what?), or died to an enemy, no ""you have died"" or anything like that, just a return to a certain point, and your players flash for a brief while, also, have you noticed how you restore hearts in these games?

That's why in the boss fight, after you incinerate the core, she says that was the core that prevented her from releasing the neurotoxin.  Then she releases the neurotoxin.  Furthermore, assuming Valve's comic is cannon, Chell IS alive at the end of portal 1 because Rattman saves her and puts her in stasis. Because chell has no idea she was ever put in stasis, it only makes sense that she IS alive in portal 2, because she wakes from stasis.  Love the theory though, jest needs a few tweaks :)."

They drink clean, unradiated, water in a vault.  In the real world, when you travel and you drink the tap water in a new country, you run the risk of making yourself sick because your body is not used to the new bacteria in the area.  Now imagine the bacteria are strong enough to be immune to radiation. How exactly do you expect the average human immune system to cope with that?  Then you have airborne things, the risk of anaphylaxis from particles in the air that your body has never had to deal with.  Best case scenario for your average vault dweller is going to be having the flu, essentially, for several months straight before their body adapts.  Constant cold symptoms from an over reaction to things in the air. Constant stomach bug symptoms from water and food your body was never adapted to. Constant muscle aches from having to move while affected by these symptoms.  And that's best case.  Worst case scenario is choking the very moment you come out of the vault in anaphylaxic shock. Possibly worse is the possibility of other weirder viruses that evolved that everyone on the outside is immune to, but you're not.   Specifically neurological symptoms such as seizures, blackouts, doing odd things in your sleep, poor speech, other things that can be subtle or exaggerated, but leave you out of control of your own body in some fashion due to virus, bacteria, radiation, or parasites.  Oh yeah, let's talk about the parasites that would be immune to radiation too! Those would be in basically every living thing since everyone, and everything is eating everyone and everything to survive the the wasteland of post nuclear winter. And you just got introduced to something everyone else can either defend against or has formed a semi-symbiotic relationship with. Not good.  Bullets aren't dangerous, people aren't dangerous, the very aid around you is dangerous when you're a newly escaped vault dweller.  I'll stay inside, thanks."

You could narrow some of it down to: Nintendo, then go from there and in a tournament style have the best of the Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo go at it. Still, even that's pretty broad. Then you'd have to ask if its relevant to its size. For example a cheetah is the fastest animal on land, but there's a African mouse (I forget the name), that is faster than it. The cheetah is only faster in overall distance because its bigger."

Also I wouldn't quite say that the Stormcloaks are the greater good all things considered they want to fight a war with the Thalmor they can't win because the empire wouldn't fight the same war that they also couldn't win. And on top of that their is the severe racism and radical beliefs. But they do have freedom of worship. The elves are by no means pure evil to the point where I cant justify the idea that they are to any reasonable extent. The Imperials are also of an ambiguous nature to the point where you hear stories of them killing innocent bystanders. In-fact the captain in the beginning at Helgan tries to execute you even though you were not on the list. The deal (The White-Gold Concordat) between the Thalmor and the Imperials wasn't born of corruption, It was made as a peace plea so the Thalmor could be satisfied to the point where they wouldn't destroy the empire.  I've been a fan of The Elder Scrolls Franchise for a long time and this was actually a thought provoking read. It was easy to debunk but it was thought provoking none the less.   /u/Solid_Goat made a very fair point as well that The Joker is not Pure Evil he is Pure Chaos. Plus the conflict is ambiguous as hell.  In short the parallels you pointed toward were not as accurate as you would think. I heavily recommend you take the time to read the hundreds of lore books in The Elder Scrolls Series (particularly Skyrim)  to see my point more clearly."
GameTheorists,3aoqwp,Spazyak,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response! I don't want to read the thousands of books in Skyrim lore... but I did in Oblivion when I didn't know what I was doing. I wanted to figure out everything. Shoddycast started as one guy talking deeply about Fallout and Skyrim lore, but I gave up on Skyrim because it's too complicated. Fallout is 100% more believable because its set in the future, the same future that apparently every video game has been set. Now Shoddycast is shooting for weekly  videos with voice actors, editors, and animators. It is truly amazing that I can understand 3 and New Vegas (especially) since I've subscribed to him for a while now.  You wanna know why I love The Game Theorist? I've never played Mario Galaxy, but I've seen the episode with the traveling-space-queen-who-is-actually Luigi's daughter a hundred times. I LOVE the lore to FNAF because the first episode got me hooked, but I've never played any of the series. I just watched some other guy play it because I wanted to see the gameplay. When FNAF3 came out I checked the channel everyday for 2 weeks in anticipation.  And then it came and it was awesome.   The 90s movies don't work for me because they left 0 impression on me, but Batman the Animated series did. Spider Man was the first superhero I ever liked. Batman Begins was great, but The Dark Knight changed everything to me when I was 16 years old. A villain who only emerged because the good people would rather blame Batman than the Joker? The Joker is chaos, but the true villain is fear. Fear vs Hope.  For me, Imperials vs Stormcloaks is a battle of religious freedom. Should the Imperials let the elfs dictate which idols they can stand behind? The Imperials don't even have a rightful king anymore, it was just some guy who took it over. Does that mean he should have a say? Also another province was able to beat back the Elfs (Aragonians I think) but I'm not sure if a Civil War between the imperials and the Stormcloaks is the best if I want the Stormcloaks to worship freely. It sounds like a Cold War right in the middle of a civil war.  Sounds like something to explore in future episodes of both channels! :)  I'm sorry if I come across as rude. I'm bad at explaining myself, clearly.  Thanks again!"
GameTheorists,3aoqwp,Spazyak,2,Mon Jun 22 20:49:16 2015 UTC,"i think it's more like imperials are democrats and stormcloaks are republicans, with all the good and bad aspects of both. imperials are focused more on safety from the elves and for imperial support or, irl, democrats are very focused on safety. on the other hand, stormcloaks are all about freedom, both personal (from the white-gold concordat) and religious (majorly angry about the ban on the worship of talos) and tradition (ulfric claiming the old title of high king, the quest you go on for the jagged crown). on the other hand, both show what each party fears about the others in the extreme. imperials have bent to the will of foregners in order to keep the peace, and banned the worship of a god who is essentially nord jesus, and pretty much the one most worshipped (prime deity of nords, the most common race in skyrim).however, the stormcloaks are racist, forcing dark (cough black people cough) to live in ghettos, freely subjected to hate crimes (that one stone-fist guy who goes to the grey quarter every night to shout at the dunmer to leave.) and the argonians (latinos maybe?) being forced (deported) completely out of the capital for no good reason. and the forsworn are obviously native americans (native skyrim inhabitants here before nords, use crude-looking weapons and hide armor, nature theme). to sum up stormcloaks = republicans, imperials = democrats, altmeri dominion = foreign powers, dark elves = black people, argonians = maybe latinos, nords = white people, forsworn = native americans."

GameTheorists,3ag0mu,WitherBoss,2,Tue Jun 23 14:15:43 2015 UTC,"Take the game's idea of a solar system with a grain of salt because it's ordered to the game's story, not how it actually is.   But it's a binary star system with 8 planets so it can't be that complicated. solar is probably a smaller star with it's own planets that orbits around lylat, and lylat itself has far more planets.  interesting tidbit for the wiki:   “The entire surface of Solar is covered with molten magma. Scientists are still uncertain as to why the planet never cooled from its original formation and remains in this ""genesis"" state. Some say that its position, directly in the center of the Sector X-Y-Z Triangle, may be the cause.” —Star Fox 64.com"

This discussion of Dino DNA for example has already been done and fleshed out in dozens of research papers and studies. MatPat's theories used to be about things that weren't so ""obvious"" or do readily available in already completed research. For example, the Rosalina theory or Mortal Combat scream of death. I dunno, maybe I'm just crazy but it seems like the theories of late have been a little ""lazy"", or not very unique/original."

Honestly, this episode has absolutely nothing to do with games.  He just used Lego JP as an excuse to put it on GT.  I'm not blaming MatPat, but I think he is overburdening himself.  He's made plenty of new series in the past couple of months such as Deadlock, Reality Check and especially Film Theory.

Not every species is a seven ton ground shaking death machine. As dangerous, intelligent and difficult to keep as something like a Velociraptor would be; there are zoos around the world that successfully contain equally dangerous animals like lions and tigers, which are also intelligent group hunters covered in razor sharp teeth and claws. Even a T.Rex is of comparable size and weight to an African Elephant and those are often kept in captivity; granted they're herbivores, but Elephants can easily kill a person if they get agitated and charge. I'm not saying it would be easy, but I think containing dinosaurs would be  well within the realms of possibility."

I'm guessing MatPat saw it because the next GameTheory episode he used that intro, kinda. ( Game Theory: A Tank's Biggest Weakness...is ITSELF (War Thunder) )  But then he used it for real and I was surprised to say the least. ( Game Theory: Does Isaac DIE?!? Binding of Isaac Rebirth's Endings EXPLAINED )  Then he contacted me on twitter asking if I wanted to edit Game Theory, and I said yes. He auditioned me by sending a 2 minute audio file of his upcoming video. (those 2 mins took me 4-5hours to edit). He liked it and then send the whole audio file and BOOM! My first Game Theory video was : Game Theory: Handsome Jack, Monster or Misunderstood? (Borderlands 2/The Pre-Sequel!)  There's more to it than that but it's tells the whole story."

At the end of the audio log, four gunshots are heard, followed by a sigh from Voice 1 and the sound of someone dropping a gun. Four bodies are found in the entrance of the Vault.   I think it's beyond clear that Voice 1 did not kill himself and let the other 4 who were already going to commit suicide do so, hence only four bodies were found.  Or is your question further into find out who Voice 1 is? In which case, there really is no way to know. There are no other linkings from any other dialogs in New Vegas that talks about Vault 11. The only reason why we hear about ""Harry"" is because his name is explicitly said in one of the recordings, but we know that Harry is killed at the end... so we know that he could not have left the vault. There are no clues or insights to who survived the Coup. Even if the only female in the suicide was Katheryn, it still doesn't tell who Voice 1 is.

GameTheorists,39yvk8,Xtremegamer51,4,Mon Jun 15 22:44:53 2015 UTC,"Comet:       A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, heats up and begins to outgas, displaying a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma and tail are much larger and, if sufficiently bright, may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.

GameTheorists,39m9bl,RGodlike,12,Fri Jun 12 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"Yo man, what's up. My name's Lee, I wrote that script.  I assure you that I am very intimately aware of ASOIAF's lore, and I know that did not happen in the books. Alas, this is a FILM Theory, so as stated in the video, ALL of the evidence was pulled from the show. It would've been weird to just stop and say ""Hey, I know this happened in the show, but it didn't in the books, so ignore it"" or ""Hey, I know this didn't happen in the show, but it did in the books!"" would have been very weird and offputting for exclusive show watchers. That's why only evidence from the show was used, and also why we had to stretch to find some other evidence, like ""born amidst salt"" for Dany, when obviously she was born amidst Salt and Smoke on Dragonstone. That's never mentioned in the show or in any of the lore videos on  the DVDs, so we decided against using it. Also why we didn't mention Aegon, because for all intents and purposes, he does not exist in the show.  Regardless, its a moot point because the salt could also be referring to the tears at the Funeral Pyre scene. That was actually originally in the script, but we took it out because no one flat out bawled in the show on-screen.  Point is, I promise you, that wasn't an oversight. We know what we're doing. ;)"
GameTheorists,39m9bl,tehfurst,3,Fri Jun 12 19:57:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I noticed you said we didn't know much about Dany's birth while book readers obviously do, and I laughed when it was stated that Jon and Dany are the only Targaryans left alive, but I didn't think much about those things since they didn't affect the conclusion of the video. Of course Aegon isn't Azor Ahai; if he was he'd be in the show (assuming the person that turns out to be Azor Ahai in the books, is also the one in the show).   That's why I did make a point about Jorah not contracting Greyscale in the books; he does sail near Valyria, but isn't ""reborn"" on the salty sea. If that meant he can't be Azor Ahai in the books, he won't be either in the show (therefore, relevant to the conclusion of the episode).   That said, since you showed more possible ""rebirths"" amidst salt in the books, you convinced me that Jorah is a possible hero of Westeros. Nice find, I've heard a lot of theories on many suprising characers (and obviously tons on Dany, Jon and Stannis), but none on Jorah before."
GameTheorists,39m9bl,dreckmal,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:15:54 2015 UTC,"""Born amidst salt"" part of the prophecy is satisfied when Jorah contracts greyscale.    He called the prophecy satisfied by Mormont sailing over the sea on a boat, with Tyrion. He gets exposed to grayscale during this voyage. It isn't the disease, it was the water. He was being born (carried by boat) amidst salt (sea water).   If that were what made the prophecy true in the show, Mormont again is a clear choice from the books, because he still travels by boat (with Tyrion) to Volantis, after being exiled by Daenerys."
GameTheorists,39m9bl,Malakoji,0,Fri Jun 12 19:29:12 2015 UTC,"You know, I actually thought you were going to fake us out with the Jorah silhouette, and show us Tyrion.  And, he fits about as well as Jorah.  Blood of the Dragon- Well, maybe he found some.  Or there's some Targaryen in him, or something.  Or he kills one when it chokes on him.  I dunno, man.  This is the weak spot. Born in salt and born in smoke- that's the battle of blackwater.  Which, if I remember right, happened under the red star.  I mean, it'd just be pandering to Tyrion fans, but I am kind of hoping for it, if only because Tyrion is more of a guile hero than a ""stab ice zombies with pointy sharp stick made out of fire"" hero."

Their success in pop culture only means we're more eager and better equipped to put down the undead.
GameTheorists,39icrv,Xskills,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:51:47 2015 UTC,"Zombie symptoms, even if we take out the whole ""undead"" portion are very hard to find among diseases. I suppose a combination of rabies symptoms (hyper salivation, delirium, etc.) to increase the potential of aggression, the speed at which the flu can make symptoms appear, a mild form of necrosis, and wendigo psychosis (which would have to somehow be part of the rabies delirium) could create a zombie like disease.   The major issue though is that the disease would need the ability to control the human brain in a very effective manner. A disease has the same basic drive most all life has; to reproduce. Diseases do this by infecting a host, reproducing, and then infecting another host. Aggression alone may kill the new host, slowing the spread of even stopping it altogether. Spreading by air or water would not make aggression necessary, so it would have to spread by bodily fluids or touch.   Really, a zombie virus would be pretty poor at spreading."
GameTheorists,39bk6j,thomyorkshire,2,Wed Jun 10 17:28:10 2015 UTC,"If you aren't worried about time, then not counting you, you only need 1 person a rank, And one person climbing at the same time as you. The ranks will get refilled as some people climb. So at minimum, you need 71 trainers. The reason why you can rank up so much faster is because essentially, there is only 1 person a rank, that have had their ranks for a while, just waiting for the next challenger so they can work their way up."
GameTheorists,39bk6j,xxAnge,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"For this logic to work, some player would have to begin at higher ranks, or there would be fixed ranks, like when collecting the 8 badges.  The problem is every person begin with rank 1."
GameTheorists,39bk6j,xxAnge,2,Thu Jun 11 00:53:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah. So 2 people battle rank 1. Winner goes to rank 2. Rank 1 gets a new challenger. Two people battle in rank 1. Winner goes to rank 2. Two people battle in rank 2. winner goes to rank 3. Loser goes to rank 1. Two people battle in rank 1. We have only 3 people that have battled so far, and there is 1 in rank 1, 1 in rank 2, and 1 in rank 3.   This continues until all 70 ranks are taken."

GameTheorists,39bk6j,Aldrai,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:50:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, but say a trainer goes to the battle tower for the first time and gets to 3rd rank. This counts as another involved person. Then, after some training, he returns to the battle tower and gets to 5th rank. Does this second attempt at the battle tower count as another involved person?

With the yoshis, it's not like Mario is gonna remember the couple days after a stork was  deliviering him. He had no way to know they where like family.  In Mario is Missing for the pc, there is an ending cutscene, in which Mario leaves bowser to die in the cold, but more importantly hugs Luigi.  The murder of toads by destroying bricks? At what point does it even imply Mario is aware of that?  Goombas are traitors, (as stated in Super Mario Bros. manual) one of the most extreme crimes. He has reason to kill them. And the elephant is torture. Mario stomps them, and they die in like half a second."

First off, no, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza is not a real place. Any similarity to a real establishment by the games themselves is pure coincidence, as Scott himself has confirmed that a real life counterpart to the FNAF pizza place does not exist.  Secondly, basing your information off of a random Yelp link does not mean that its verified. Personally, because of the sketchiness of this post and the convoluted ""information"" it contains, I deny any credibility to your ""theory"" - if even it may be called that.   Third, demanding the viewer to ""help you out"" and actually find your ridiculous claim online is ridiculous and immediately disproves your statements. This shows that you have next to no veritable backings to what you are saying, thus nullifying your points entirely. Do research, find truthful evidence, and don't make insane statements about a fictional video game crossing over into the real world.   One more thing: ""Theories"" are meant to be debated. Automatically assuming you are correct in whatever assumption is unhelpful in developing a theory. Granted, having evidence may help, but as you are completely lacking in evidence, you have no ground to stand on. I conclude my rant now."

The Golden Land is another name for the Sacred Realm (in the Japanese version of ALttP, it's only called the Sacred Realm; the term ""Golden Land"" only appears in the English version).  This is the same place as the Sacred Realm from OoT, and the same place where the goddesses placed the Triforce when they created the world in the beginning (as we are told in ALttP, OoT, and TP).  This is also the same place where OoT Ganondorf is sealed at the end of OoT until the events of TWW. It's the place where ALttP Ganon is sealed until Agahnim can break the seal on the realm.  If the Sacred Realm was actually just Hyrule in the future, it would have to be the far, far future, well after all the other games in the timeline have already come and gone, after Hyrule is no longer a kingdom and exists as a land of disjointed land masses floating in a cloudy landscape, which is beyond any form of time travel we've ever seen in the series. It would mean that the goddesses created Hyrule and then placed the Triforce ridiculously far in Hyrule's future but left several portals around the land so that the people of Hyrule could time travel to the future, retrieve the Triforce, and bring it back to the present.  But since ALBW showed us that the Triforce has to be in existence to prevent the universe from falling apart, removing the Triforce from the land's history could potentially have the same negative effect on the land.

For instance, Bowser is not the main villain in half of them, Luigi had adventures in a non-Mushroom Kingdom place, the civilian populous is much more varied (Goombas, Koopas, and other ""bad guys."")

Simon Carless, writing for Gamasutra, described Birdo as ""infamously gender-confused"".

In the book Vintage Games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time, the authors describe Birdo as the most notable character in Super Mario Bros. 2 due to being the first transgender character in video games.  In three different articles for GamesRadar, Chris Antista commented about her gender confusion and stated that the revelation was similar to when ""lead singer of Judas Priest came out to a legion of homophobic metalheads dressed to the nines in skin tight leather left wondering if their dicks will fall off.""

GameTheorists,38d96n,Fuzzl,19,Wed Jun 3 13:47:48 2015 UTC,Already having more than one video ready for the new channel was a great idea.
GameTheorists,38d96n,Crocodilefan,2,Wed Jun 3 17:57:04 2015 UTC,"Ya, I know he must have had been working on this channel on the side for a long time to have that many videos ready to put out right away."
GameTheorists,38d96n,alexsmart007,2,Fri Jun 5 02:45:46 2015 UTC,It definetly paid off. I'm glad he's doing it rather than outsourcing it to a different channel like cinemasins did for videogamesins and brandsins.
GameTheorists,38d96n,Crocodilefan,2,Fri Jun 5 04:50:23 2015 UTC,"Ya, it's nice to have some connection and quality into both the two channels."
GameTheorists,38d96n,alexsmart007,11,Fri Jun 5 15:50:14 2015 UTC,"MatPat deserves it. He puts lots of work into his videos. I don't understand why many channels are popular, but with these theories videos, it is obvious."
GameTheorists,38d96n,Enriched_Uranium,4,Wed Jun 3 18:01:13 2015 UTC,"It's a shame so many people hate him for what he does.  Seriously, have you seen the comments section of DYKG's Did You Know Movies channel announcement? Pretty much everybody in the comments is as follows.  ""We are making a new channel!""  Ok, cool.  ""We will be sharing this channel with the guys over at Game Theory.""  Ew, nevermind.  It's sad, really.  Everybody there has such a negative impression of The Game Theorists."
GameTheorists,38d96n,Toastrz,7,Wed Jun 3 19:05:02 2015 UTC,"I bet 90% of those people didn't even watch the videos, they're just haters. I didn't see the comment section on the more recent one but I can imagine. There are a lot of people on YouTube that just spew hatred without any reason.  MatPat doesn't deserve the hate. He's one of the more legit YouTubers that cares about his community and providing them with quality content. I've watched all his videos except the more recent Film theory of Dr. Who and I can safely say I never disliked any of the videos. Even if I don't agree with a given theory, he provides miles of evidence to back himself up so I can at least respect the time he put into it.   Finally, and most importantly, he always makes me laugh. There are theorists, and then there are loyal theorists. I like to think those of us subscribed to the subreddit are the loyal variety."

Also, getting shot in the head is not always fatal, you can find many stories of people surviving, but it's not uncommon for their to be neurological setbacks due to how sensitive the brain is, explaining the reassignment and selection of perks as a check up of sorts.

GameTheorists,388xca,Fuzzl,10,Tue Jun 2 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched all yet but I'm a big ASOIAF fan and was just a bit annoyed when MatPat said ""My theory"" when explaining R+L=J, a rather well known theory under book readers since 2003 which I don't even know if there is a person that should tke credit for it.  For the rest, it seems really great and fun! Hope to have enough time to watch more!"
GameTheorists,388xca,ahmedje123,3,Tue Jun 2 21:25:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that bothered me a bit as well. I could understand it if he came up with that theory on his own, without looking up other people's theories, but I find that hard to believe."
GameTheorists,388xca,MichaeltheMagician,2,Tue Jun 2 23:32:32 2015 UTC,I have heard of people who did that (atleast one person had to do it for this to even exist) but yeah it's very hard to NOT have heard by now about his parents.
GameTheorists,388xca,ahmedje123,2,Tue Jun 2 23:47:30 2015 UTC,"Hey. My name's Lee, and I wrote and edited the Jon theory. Both Matt and I are huge fans of ASOIAF (both the books and the TV show), and when we were plotting what to have ready at launch, a GoT Theory was definitely one that we wanted.  I wrote an entire other theory that, to my knowledge, was almost completely original. However, part of it relied very VERY heavily on R+L=J, and that got me kind of worried... yes, it is an extremely common theory in the ASOIAF community, and one of the more well known theories about fiction in general... but, from the point of view of a Show Watcher, someone who's only interaction with this franchise has been watching the episodes as they've come out, is it well known? Would bringing it up randomly, accepting it as fact, and then moving on with the rest of the theory work? No. Alright, but if I wrote an explanation in the other theory, it would become too long and bloated.  I came to Matt w/ the dilemma and we agreed that we should try to make a definitive ""show version"" of this Theory, just to get it out of the way and so the people who exclusively watch the show who would happen across our channel would know what was up. I guarantee you that the theory was written from the perspective of it being popular within the community, but that can often get lost in recording... Sometimes, when you're doing takes, you might change a word of two and the line works better that way. In this case, I assume Matt said ""my theory"" while recording and rolled with it.  I hope you understand our POV on this, and that our next ASOIAF theory will be better for you. I can personally say that a lot of love and work went into both of these videos."
GameTheorists,388xca,tehfurst,2,Wed Jun 3 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"Hi, really appreciate your comment.   I wasn't mad or anything, it was more of a pet peeve just so you know :)   But yeah I completely understand and I could tell from the episode that you guys were trying to base most of it from clues by the show. It wasn't bad, you did a great job explaining it to the ones not knowing!   I just found it a bit meh to myself because I knew this already and that's why I probably watched the video with criticism in mind.   Btw, really looking forward to your next theory then! I can't stop reading others at /r/asoiaf :D"
GameTheorists,388xca,ahmedje123,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:36:12 2015 UTC,"Ha, sorry if it came off like I thought you were mad. A BUNCH of people in the comments of that video were upset about that, and with this being the first Theory I've actually written thats gone up, guess I'm a bit protective.  Thanks for the kind words, regardless! I'm excited for this next one. I think it'll be great :)"
GameTheorists,388xca,tehfurst,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:10:03 2015 UTC,"It'll all come in time dude, you'll get even better and better. I couldn't tell that it was somebody ""new"" that wrote that one. It was all clear and well written.   We all know how Internet can just overreact on a lot so it might seem overwhelming to you but it's not a biggie.  Btw, If you or MatPat need any help on ASOIAF research, I won't mind doing it in my free time, I'm waaayyyy to addicted to the whole series ;)   Just PM here on reddit, online for a lot of time :)"
GameTheorists,388xca,ahmedje123,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:18:07 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue with the Harry Potter video. The books clearly point out the theory and he says so in the video as well.I guess this channel is catered to people who never read the books related to the movies and shows he's talking about which is fine I guess, but when it's a widely accepted theory or outright stated in the book I feel like it should get a mention at the top of the show rather than at the end. I feel like not a lot of work is being put into these videos compaired to Matt's usual stuff since they're basically using other peoples theories. I'm all for Matt being able to make more content more easily but I don't think I'll be watching anymore of this channel."

I checked out the Oscar ""hax"" videos, and I'm... meh.  Maybe it's a little too cynical, maybe I just think MatPat's out of his sphere of influence and talking about things that other people have already discussed better and with more knowledge of the source materials, but I'm not convinced yet.

GameTheorists,388f8p,shaboozeybot,8,Tue Jun 2 16:14:41 2015 UTC,"That last part scares me a little bit. The idea of shoehorning interactivity into cinema. I always believed the soul of a movie is an auteur's unique vision. For good or for ill, it's the main reason movies survived the Hays Code and the threat of television.  As much as I believe in the potential of games, I refuse to surrender film to the masses just so we can break the 4th wall there. We make better games and we make better movies. This isn't a zero sum game, we can have both mediums both telling great stories.  Besides, if nothing else, we as a video game audience has largely proven to be incapable of appreciating auteur driven stories (re: Mass Effect 3 and our Annie Wilkes-esque reaction to it)."
GameTheorists,388f8p,disord87,3,Tue Jun 2 18:52:27 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the fact that 95% of the ""innovations"" that cinema has come up with have been largely ignored, forgotten, or are outright despised by the viewing public.  Even 3D movies are a niche at best, and a good portion of the public can't even watch 3D movies comfortably."

It was a movie about All My Circuits, where Calculon had a choice between doing his taxes, or saving his wife. The machine was rigged to go for the paper filled choice, and was left with a scene of Calculon slowly reading his paperwork.   That's just it though, if we do try to make movies interactive, isn't there the flaw that you won't usually get to see the whole movie, or get the choice you wanted compared to everyone else? Maybe I'm overthinking this...  Otherwise, this was a very interesting episode!"

GameTheorists,388f8p,clacas,3,Wed Jun 3 04:01:16 2015 UTC,"You started off strong, pointing out the reason why video game movies HAVE sucked is because there hasn't been any real impetus to drive the making of a good movie, but it fell apart very quickly after that.  1) Saying that a movie based on a video game will always be a failure because it changes the aspect of the original media is asinine.  Otherwise, there would be no such thing as fanfiction.  The thing video games do better than books is to create and present an immersive world.  The key to making a good video game adaptation is to not try to follow the plot of a game, but to use the world the game is based in to tell a story.  Let's face it, games are pretty awful for plot.  The best thing you could do is throw 90% of what video games have away.  I mean, take something like Spec Ops: The Line for example.  Not only would that plot make a fantastic movie (even after you've removed the interactivity elements, as much as they helped the feeling and immersion), it already did make an amazing movie (being as closely based as it was on Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now).  The reason video game movie adaptions suck is because no one is trying very hard, not because it's impossible to do.  2) Video games are not superior to movies for delivering story, or even for immersion.  It's even easier to MISS details in a video game than it is in a movie.  When two people watch the same movie, one might have drawn more out of it about how the wardrobe choices or the music helped emphasize plot points, for instance, but in a video game, the two can have WILDLY different experiences, even bordering on not being the same story at ALL.  Compare someone who explored the original Portal to someone who just decided to speedrun the puzzles, or someone who played Fear alone in a dark room late at night to someone who had to play it in the middle of the day with the volume basically muted because other people are sharing the house.  Video games just aren't made to deliver story, they're made to deliver experiences, and they do that quite well, but that's why they're not comparable to movies for the most part.  This brings me to my main point, which is:  3) The idea of making an interactive movie is the stupidest idea in human history.  Not only would it be inherently un-enjoyable (no one really, truly enjoys the idea of losing at a movie, or getting a worse story because you chose the wrong branch.  you might say you'd support it just to be contrary, but you'd be lying, and I can prove that because I'm 99.9995% sure you don't have any choose-your-own-adventure books in your house right now), the best part you could possibly pitch to a studio is that it would be a way to bilk audiences out of double or triple the admission because they'd be forced to pay to see it again if they wanted to see it differently (to say nothing of the insane and absurdly complicated mechanics of deciding how the movie would actually progress).  And beyond all of that, no one would EVER try it, because you'd see your production costs for a movie balloon by 5, 10, 20 times for no additional benefit.  And if you simply try to push for ""better"" video game adaptations, you realize that you're simply pushing against the exact same boulder as a movie adaptation of a video game, just from the opposite side.  Movie tie-in games almost always SUCK.  They're shackled to the plot of the movie, and even when they're not, they often fall flat as they lack unique selling points and have mechanics that are handcuffed to the ""look"" and ""feel"" of the movie rather than being crafted to help the game.  You're still Sisyphus, you've just picked a different, equally-steep hill.  I realize you're basically trying to sell for a new channel (one that I'm not really sure I think you're qualified for, but I'll give you a shot for a few videos...), but even for a glorified ad read, this ""theory"" video has some pretty enormous plot holes in it."

I don't think it had anything to do with Disney because even Disney had flops for movies. My only guess is that instead of restricting the movie to a particular series (like Super Mario Bros. or Mortal Kombat), the topic was made more general to allow more creativity with the concept of video game movies. I bet anyone could name some creative ideas present in the film, like the surge protector being the main way where video game characters can visit other video games (even though it is impossible to do that as you need a data cable and not a power cable)."

GameTheorists,381gk4,4EverUnknown,23,Mon Jun 1 03:59:45 2015 UTC,"Here's an explanation that's just mine. I don't really think it's logical, but take it as you will.  Let's compare Call of Duty, (And other FPS LIKE CoD, because First Person Shooters can differ a lot from each other. Borderlands is a first person shooter, and that's a somewhat praised game series, more or less,) to Nickelback.  Nickelback has been around for quite a while. When they first came out, people liked them, they were on the top of the charts at some points. But then, after 2 or 3 albums, people started to realize that a lot of their songs sounded the same. A lot of recycled chords and beats. Now after many albums later, most people will say that they they hate Nickleback. They aren't a great band, but they aren't a bad band either. They've put out some decent songs, and Chad Kroger has worked with great guitarist, ""Santana,"" twice. But all in all they're just a regular rock band. But because the internet is a thing, they are known as the ""worst band,"" even though they aren't. It's just a bandwagon of sorts, and people just like to say ""Haha, yeah, they're horrible""  This applies to these FPS arena like games like Call of Duty and Battlefield. All in all they aren't horrible games. It's just a bandwagon thing when it comes to the hate. Each franchise has has their good games, some mediocre, some better than others. But really, it's just opinions and hate-wagons.   I personally used to love playing CoD, because I could play it with all my friends and have fun, and that's why a lot of people like it. But I started to develop some anger issues, so I quit it.     tl;dr It's just a bandwagon hate that the Nickelback has."
GameTheorists,381gk4,TheTwistedTeddy,6,Mon Jun 1 05:00:09 2015 UTC,"You call it bandwagon hate, but there's also something to be said for the fact that after Nickleback put out more than a single album, it became incredibly apparent that they didn't actually have any talent and everything would be the same, generic cock-rock as the first album was.  Bandwagon is hating something because a lot of people do, and as a generalization goes, it's a great way to diminish the preferences of the viewer who doesn't like it and tell them their opinion is wrong.  I see Nickleback (and CoD, by extension) as more of a ""You know, I'm really starting to see a pattern here"" sort of thing, and they obviously don't like the pattern.  The more games the CoD franchise puts out, the more glaring the problems become, and the more strongly it affects the audience.  Sure, they'll always sell a billion units no matter what they do, because there's still a large section of the audience that just wants to shoot the guns and make the mans fall down, but there will be a larger and larger divide between the hardcore fan and the casual FPS gamer as the series goes on.  There, almost by definition, won't BE any fair-weather fans.  You either love it or you hate it."
GameTheorists,381gk4,letuotter,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:14:38 2015 UTC,"You definitely made the points I should have made. You are spot on. Although I do disagree a small bit, because in some aspects both Call of Duty and Nickelback do have their fair share of bandwagon hate. I've even come across several people who've never really taken the time to listen to Nickelback songs, yet they still say they hate them. But for the biggest majority, you are completely right.   All in all, to answer OP based on everyone's suggestions here, they're just generic games.It doesn't make them necessarily bad. They're just the same year after year."
GameTheorists,381gk4,TheTwistedTeddy,5,Mon Jun 1 15:16:08 2015 UTC,Excellently explained.
GameTheorists,381gk4,TheTwistedTeddy,3,Mon Jun 1 05:01:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, kind sir."
GameTheorists,381gk4,letuotter,6,Mon Jun 1 05:03:02 2015 UTC,"To the intelligent gamer, they represent the worst aspects of gaming, gamers and the FPS genre in general.  The CoD and Battlefield markets have (perhaps rightly) garnered a reputation as the bro-gamer haven, the domain of the visor-wearing frat boy douchebag and the twelve-year-old edgelord who just discovered profanity and teabagging and thinks they're God's gift to comedy.  Sure, there's lots of places where the chat is full of ignorant jackwagons, but CoD is the Ur-example.  It's the archetype.  When someone wants to ask ""what's the dark side of gamers like?"" you can pretty much just point at CoD multiplayer and say ""that.""  As for the games themselves, they do all the worst power-fantasy tropes without any sense of self-awareness.  They encourage the player to live out racist, borderline genocidal acts under the guise of being the undisputed ""good guys"".  When critics describe the plot of every CoD game as ""shoot all the brown people"", they're not exaggerating very much.  It almost requires the gamer to put themselves into a jingoistic, machismo-fueled man-rage in order to succeed.  They force the player to commit atrocities and war crimes, but rather than have any sense of self-awareness and indicating to the player that (you know, maybe these guys aren't really on the level, and maybe you should be fighting to a higher standard), your actions are always justified because YOU are on the winning team, and there are no consequences.  Say what you want about ""realism"", but you can't make a statement about the horrors of war without at least a modicum of self-awareness, and the CoD franchise is about as self-aware as a sea sponge.  And then there's the gameplay itself.  While the mechanics of the series (serieses?) are polished to a mirror shine (and they damn well should be, after this many games), it still comes down to a linear hallway between set pieces.  It's a rail shooter that makes you push yourself down the track.  Anything even remotely interesting, cool, or awe-inspiring happens in cutscene or pre-planned sequence form.  The gameplay itself is a sight-seeing tour of chest-high wall after chest-high wall, and there's very rarely anything to break the flow.  The action is held at a constant high, with absolutely no pacing curve whatsoever, so the gameplay all just blurs together into a murky mess to distract you from the fact that there's actually really almost no plot at all.  So there's your reasons.  Most people who really dislike the franchise get by with just one of the set of reasons, but that's the gamut.  If you want to break down mechanics or graphics, okay, you've probably got a wealth of material to choose from in the CoD franchise (because it does those things very well indeed), but by almost any other metric, CoD and Battlefield are tepid, uninspired, repetitious, money-grubbing, jingoistic, war-crime-glorifying pieces of shit that get recycled every year solely for the purpose of wringing dollars out of people's wallets with the minimum possible investment.  They're almost as bad as EA sports titles."

GameTheorists,381gk4,Samthefab,4,Mon Jun 1 17:35:27 2015 UTC,"Because they recycle every year, and they are big series, with a lot of people playing them each time the new one comes out. Sports games are also recycled year after year, but they go mostly unnoticed and so people don't call attention to them. However, CoD and Battlefield have a lot of supporters, and thus a lot of attention, which then starts people hating the series for being the same stuff again and again with almost no changes. They aren't the worst thing in gaming, but they are one of the biggest genres and so are a massive target to attract attention."

On top of that, many of these fanboys ONLY play CoD. The overall image is that of tasteless fanboys. Just a bunch of adrenaline-junkys waiting to point and shoot things always expecting things to go perfectly then they die and rage. Rinse and repeat. Not saying the steriotype (always) holds up, but the image is there.

GameTheorists,37xzej,JoeBob32X,2,Sun May 31 09:51:58 2015 UTC,"Paper Mario and Mini Mario games seem to be missing from this timeline... also if anything, the Mini Mario/Mario vs DK series is probably somewhere in the Jumpman Era before the original Donkey Kong. The Mario vs DK/Mini Mario series had sparked the original rivlary, building up to the fight on the girder areas we know today. The Paper Mario series would most likely take place between the Baby Era and Adult Era. The Paper Mario series being in a book, being a story could most likely take place during when Mario was a young kid, 5-10 with his mother reading the Paper Mario Story to him."

Wario does literally mean ""Bad Mario"", after all.  My guess would be that Nintendo thought of Wario's concept first, and didn't bother about where (or whether) he fit on the family tree. If Ninty has an official stance on it, he's probably written off as a distant relative. Though they might go all Zelda on it and say he's from an alternate timeline where Mario joins Bowser."

I imagine that Chell probably cost a LOT of money to create, what with her cybernetic and bionic enhancements, so they wouldn't want to kill her off immediately.  The turrets seem like they might be more about creating a threat and a failure state more than killing.  Also, I know the source material says spring powered, but the rate of fire and SFX indicate powder-fired rounds to me.  Maybe I just haven't seen the right evidence, but I doubt a spring-fired weapon could carry that rate of fire.  After all, we all know someone involved with the program who has a history of lies and misinformation, now don't we?"

She's one among thousands of possible test subjects, and she was going to be rejected from testing for being too tenacious and smart. Rattman hacked into the system to put her at the top of the list for testing, as he believed (correctly) that a very tenacious and smart test subject could overthrow GLaDOS. Her enhancements (the leg-braces that allow her to do long falls) are retconned away in Portal 2, also, and replaced with Long-fall boots.  If she was intentionally made for testing, she'd not be among a bunch of normal test subjects (she's there because she's seen as normal too), and she'd not be about to be rejected for testing."

It is interspersed with flashbacks of the time when Rattman was helping build/program GLaDOS, which is when he helped make Chell the top test candidate."

I know that it isn't in the game, so I am looking at a real life comparison.  3: Actually, yes you can get a spring loaded thing to fire that fast. After all, there are four guns. So, each one would only have to fire at one fourth of the speed and still get the same audio result by staggering the shot timing.   4:cave Johnson did say ""we Fire the whole bullet. That is 65% more bullet per bullet."" Now among this gibberish, he says the WHOLE bullet. So it seems unlikely that the powder went off."

I'd like to see some numbers, because I've never seen anything powered by springs that can shoot that fast.  Listen to the turrets, they're shooting either at or near machine gun rates.  The SFX sound most similar to my ear to an MP5 or such, but that's just an estimate.  You just can't compress a spring that fast, but more importantly, you can't even really decompress a spring that fast.  Here, do yourself some reading. Cave Johnson is certifiably insane.

GameTheorists,37fgzq,JORTENDO,6,Wed May 27 06:17:58 2015 UTC,"How about we look at the three ""main"" entries in the series independently? By that, I mean Blue/Red Rescue Team, Explorers of Time/Darkness/Sky, and Gates to Infinity.  Blue/Red Rescue Team has you as a human being transformed into a Pokémon to save the world of Pokémon from a massive meteorite crashing down (that plot got reused for ORAS' Delta Episode, now that I think about it...). Seeing as how we only ever hear about you, the player, as originally being human, and another Pokémon you meet fairly early in the story also strongly being hinted at to have been human too, yet no other humans are ever seen or heard from, it's safe to assume that this world inhabited by Pokémon has possibly heard about humans in a time long past, only to be remembered by the Legendaries, or has been disconnected from a world where humans live alongside Pokémon. Maybe humans did the Pokémon wrong at some point in time, causing an external power (Arceus?) to seperate this dimension from the human world. The shock on everyone's faces from learning you are human might be caused by the fact that they were taught that humans are inherently evil (or it has something to do with genetic memory), yet you as a human-turned-Pokémon are doing everything you can in order to help them in their times of need.  Jumping over to the Explorer games, we learn that you, as a human, were helping out a Pokémon from a future, post-apocalyptic world to save said world from this apocalyptic fate caused by the collapse of time itself. Upon learning of what needs to be done to stop this from happening, you and your partner travel back in time only to be attacked by someone who wants to preserve this catastrophic timeline. This attack during the time travel causes you to be transformed into a Pokémon, and you lose your memories up until that point, only remembering that you used to be human. Yet still, outside of you alone, there is zero mention of other humans in this world, same as in the Rescue Team games. The world in the Explorer games is also completely separate from the world of the Rescue Team games, and with some legendaries displaying abilities of interdimensional travel, it's actually safe to assume now that both worlds exist in parallel or even pocket dimensions outside of human control.  Gates to Infinity now gives us a possible explanation for how all this is tied together - how a human could have ended up in these alternate realities of the Pokémon-inhabited world. They were drawn through similar gates like the one you use in the beginning of GtI to get there. It's not completely out of the question that the player character from the Explorer games was called to the apocalyptic future first, still as a human, since that future is based on the events of the game proper, except that the Temporal Tower (and with it, time itself) crumbled to pieces. Your investigations and actions while there tied you to that future (which, still, has NO SIGNS OF HUMANS, same as the main timeline the game is set in) and caused you to disappear when said future was averted.  I'm sure there's more to the entire thing. Much more. I might have to replay all of the games again, since they are some of the best Pokémon games, especially the Explorer games."

No text strings referring to it, no slot in the item IDs, and now Psynergy (Unleash) associated with it.  Also, because of the way the game is programmed, its stats would not be possible. Namely:   Removes the 999 Attack limit on that character    While theoretically possible with Hex Editing, this is not possible for an item effect, because it does not exist in the database of item effects.

It works by an animation index, and any unleashes with a Multiplier effect, simply changes the animation accordingly.

The main benefits of medical marijuana are reduced anxiety, pain, and muscle spasms, none of which alone would result in her condition at the end of the 3rd episode. I think that the condition is alluded to being a car accident, seeing as that is what was supposed to kill her dad, and the last new photo we see in that trippy sequence is of her ""new"" car."

GameTheorists,379lo6,T33p0,1 point,Wed May 27 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think we should re-evaluate how these ""emancipation grills"" work. Because to the untrained eye, they look like weird electric fields to me.  It's not entirely out of question that these fields could trigger a reaction in Aperture-brand props that causes them to self-destruct. And it's also not hard to believe that if these cubes are large enough to squish a human inside, there's also enough space left inside Companion Cubes to house a self-destruct mechanism of some kind that is either triggered by moving through the grills or remotely by GLaDOS. This self-destruct mechanism, in any case, seems to involve mass amounts of heat, as the surface of a fizzled object (cubes, turrets, you name it) turns black before dissolving into ash.  ""What about the DVD prop? That seems to be too flat to house that kind of mechanism!"" Here's the thing: Have you maybe ever microwaved a CD/DVD? It could be that the grills send out a microwave field that causes a reaction/triggers the self-destruct mechanism in Aperture props and wrecks DVDs as well.  Just my two cents."
GameTheorists,379lo6,IrishLink,0,Wed May 27 04:20:36 2015 UTC,"That's not the problem with the theory. Just because a sound is in the game doesn't mean that you can access it. In the canonical plot of the game, you cannot pass the companion cube through an emancipation grill. And yes, that includes the custom-maps in Portal 2      Oh wait, you're waaaay off. I can tell you haven't played Portal 2, as the level with the companion cube has GLaDoS destroying a companion cube, in a similar fashion to the emancipation grills      ""But random online person"", I hear you cry, ""wouldn't a body have popped out?"" ... You make a good point.      Here's where we begin to assume, as I've got no idea as to why this would work.   The cubes no longer have bodies in them in Portal 2. More than likely false, as right after this level, GLaDoS drops the ""sentience"" line. Maybe old habits die hard, or she had no idea the weight was replaced with something else. Even still, the sound file has the ""dying soul"" part, so that's pretty much bogus.     GLaDoS's method of destroying the cubes telepathically(?) also destroys the body This one holds more water. It'd clear up this misconception, and means the body's still in there. Maybe the grill is broken in that level for the fear of it being used period, forcing GLaDoS to deal with the cube herself. Why doesn't she use it more often? Well, it'd probably use a good bit of power to destroy the cube from a distance, including the flesh inside it, and GLaDoS would probably grow tired of the joke after 10 or so test chambers."

GameTheorists,37538g,ceilius,1 point,Sun May 24 23:20:15 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't have access to surgical supplies where these toads were. They were essentially trapped with about a hundred other toads and a couple pinatas on a tiny raft. Also, each of the toads has the patch."
GameTheorists,37538g,ilivetofly,3,Sun May 24 23:39:11 2015 UTC,The lack of supplies is the reason that the mushrooms show rubbish reconstruction (aka the stitching). Kets face it if the cared enough to patch a hat in those dire conditions they are a lot better off than they make out to be. Its entirely plausible they are intact rubbish surgeons and you only see this illustrated here (and not in say dungeons where a hat would clearly be in jeopardy of wear/tear is because of the lack of supplies and good surgeons.

GameTheorists,37538g,HammBerger3,1 point,Mon May 25 01:40:04 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing is that it IS a fact. No game has ever mentioned if the Toad's mushroom caps are biological or decorational. The only non-canonical information about these bulbs are from The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3."

GameTheorists,375g8z,SwordofStorms,5,Mon May 25 01:16:11 2015 UTC,"This is actually a prety OLD theory, but I can second this easily.  Besides, I have this feeling G-man is Gordon Freeman wathcing himself from the future. I think that because there are some easter eggs that show him appearing in hidden parts of the games as you progress to the end. Here's the video.  Perhaps he's making sure his old self Gordon Freeman take the right steps to an specific future. Kinda the Watchers in Fringe or Hiro Nakamura in Heroes."
GameTheorists,375g8z,marcelmiranda,2,Mon May 25 01:19:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I was thinking if Half-Life 3 ever comes out, perhaps this could be explained.  It just makes so much sense! I would love to see a Game Theory on this!  EDIT: I also added to the theory."
GameTheorists,375g8z,marcelmiranda,2,Mon May 25 01:29:02 2015 UTC,"The whole plot of Half Life and Portal is quite obvious for me. It's all about paralel dimensions.  It began when Black Mesa started to research how to reach this other dimensions while in another place Aperture beagn reasearching how to deal and control the Portal technology. What came after that? While in Black Mesa they fucked up really hard and shit went serious with demons and monsters from other dimensions came out to our dimensions the events of Portal 1 and 2 happened with GLaDOS and all.  Remember Borealis? Perhaps this is the key to explain the G-man event. Perhaps, in the end Gordon Freeman ended up inside this ship that went missing into another dimension giving the ability to travel back in time as G-Man, a more mature version of Gordon Freeman.  Anyway, I ish I wasn't too drunk rigt now. It's hard to keep writing and making sense at the same time."
GameTheorists,375g8z,marcelmiranda,2,Mon May 25 01:58:18 2015 UTC,"While I doubt that the Borealis has anything to do with G-Man, I do think G-Man got his powers and met his ""employers"" in some interdimensional event where he was ""hired"".  Something must have happened, but what. One clue is that the final boss of Half-Life 1, the Nihilanth refers to the G-Man.  ""You are man... he is not man... for you he waits, for you..."" he says.  This would seem to contradict my theory, would it not? But, perhaps the event that turned him into the G-Man made him unhuman. Also, who are his employers?  I think that sounds like a job for MatPat, if you ask me."
GameTheorists,375g8z,lolpan,1 point,Mon May 25 13:15:25 2015 UTC,"About his employers, there's absolutely no clue whatsoever.   Who can they be? Black Mesa real owners? Cave Johnson (I doubt it)? He might even not be working for the 'evil bosses' of the game, perhaps. Mayeb there's a plot behind the secret plot of the main plot. :P"

AoL references LoZ and says it takes place ""seasons"" after the events of LoZ.  LA references ALttP and says it takes place a few years after the events of ALttP.  MM references OoT and says it takes place a few months after OoT.  TWW references MM and OoT and says it takes place hundreds of years after OoT.  FSA references FS, TWW, and ALttP.  TMC references FS, FSA, OoT, and the Oracles.  PH references TWW and says it takes place months after TWW.  ST references TWW and PH and says it takes place about one hundred years after TWW.

Just pulling out a time period doesn't work. You need similarity of the art work painted in games to match up with real life painters of said time period.  Try to only use your own theories in the future, it's really hard to present and defend the ideas of someone else without hear it directly from them.

GameTheorists,36svzu,Kanex,18,Fri May 22 19:42:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like they focus too much on game design decisions (some of them are really subjective or somewhat unimportant) while ignoring the real problem like the gameplay, the control and the terrible camera control. This episode is kind of underwhelming"
GameTheorists,36svzu,jc1593,5,Thu May 21 23:15:25 2015 UTC,"the control and the terrible camera control.   This, clunky controls to where the difficulty is configured to punish you for losing control is a way for making the game more difficult, that isn't often (intentionally) used in western games. But some japanese studios really like it. Resident Evil difficulty is as much fighting the controls as it is fighting the enemies.  I just started Dark Souls 2 again today and while the controls are pretty smooth for being intentionally left a little clunky, many little things like, the focus camera on knights being slightly higher than needed so you can't see the floor while locked on to them. The lunge attack only working half the time, swinging my weapon in a tight corridor clangs it off the wall, but an enemy wielding the same spear can do spinning attacks in there just fine.  It is good that Dark Souls is hard, because it does make it more memorable, and the design of many challenges, puzzles and areas is brilliant and refreshing. But when I'm failing to hit an enemy right in my face because the lockon decided the guy up on a tower waaay in the background there is a more imminent target. Then the controls of the game are hindering my fun with it rather than making me grateful for the extra difficulty."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Zwets,4,Fri May 22 00:53:13 2015 UTC,I think it makes a bit more sense in RE because its meant to create fear. Its not exactly a hard game either
GameTheorists,36svzu,pkjamming,1 point,Fri May 22 02:35:01 2015 UTC,"300 hours into Dark souls 2, I really cannot see your point on terrible camera, I've never had problems with Camera but each to their own  And Dark souls 2 is the smoothest third person game I've played control wise, I can barely play any other third person games (Witcher 2 for example) because the controls are abysmal compared to DS2  I honestly don't know how you play, but I feel like your problems are your problems and not DS2"
GameTheorists,36svzu,Ophilesdea,3,Fri May 22 06:21:14 2015 UTC,"300 hours into it means that you're used to both the controls and the camera, meaning that because they are different from the norm you find other games harder to play, and meaning that you find them easy to control.  An example; a couple of years ago I was living in Australia. I didn't have any money, and the only game I had was a pirated version of Halo: Combat Evolved that had online enabled. The only problem was that the Australian internet sucks balls, and the servers that used the pirated version were all located in US. Now, you know that Halo uses hit scan, right? Well, I learned to actually lead my enemies in that game by quite a lot because of the time I spent playing it, and for a little while when a friend of mine tried to play it they'd say that it's unplayable. I however said that the problem was with them, not with my internet."

GameTheorists,36svzu,BulletBills,3,Thu May 21 23:45:53 2015 UTC,I think it's because it's an unfathomably stupid argument to make the topic of a video. Next thing you know they're going to be arguing that FF7 is overrated and FF8 is a masterpiece.

GameTheorists,36svzu,saintjimmy64,5,Fri May 22 07:44:47 2015 UTC,"The game mechanic is extremely complicated and never explained to the player so he either has to just play without figuring it out and keep an eye on things to see what changes in hopes of seeing a pattern in the system, or test the system to see how it works (or look it up, but you should definitely be able to play a game and figure out the important mechanics without having to google them)."
GameTheorists,36svzu,NukeWithG,7,Fri May 22 09:14:49 2015 UTC,"It isn't nearly as complicated as he makes it out to be though. You can hover over the stats on your character screen and it tells you what they do. Intelligence clearly states that it only benefits sorceries and magic weapons. Sorcery, miracles and pyromancy are very separate in Dark Souls.  Pyromancy doesn't even primarily scale off dex like he goes on to say. The main feature of pyromancy is that it doesn't scale off stats. Dex, at certain levels, gives a benefit to some offensive spell casting speeds. This is neither required or limited to benefiting pyromancy.  Could this have all been communicated better in game? Oh 100% yes, there is a lot of stuff that could've been done better. But the information is there if he looked for two seconds."

GameTheorists,36svzu,Herbpudding,39,Sat May 23 00:47:03 2015 UTC,"Watching this video made me realize that Jirard  had no idea what he was talking about.   The game lying - It was a translation error with the life ring, you can't blame the game for that, it's the translation teams fault. Rusted Iron Ring - It helps you out in blight-town, that's it. The other parts of the game where it helps are not needed to progress so I will not mention them. The RIR is a reward for players that explore the game, you see the item in the tutorial so it's not like it is hidden. Firelink shrine connects the entire world in Dark Souls, people who are too lazy to try to get to it again should not complain. They make it obvious that you can return with the door being locked in the asylum. The crow being visible when you are in Firelink shrine, and the item on the roof indicating that you can go there. If you need someone to hold your hand to figure that out and then complain about it, uninstall the game and play skyrim. Stats - When you make changes to the stats IT SHOWS WHERE YOU GET EXTRA DAMAGE BEFORE YOU FINALIZE IT. I think this guy is just fucking blind. Combat is like Zelda Oc of time, ""you just have to wait"" - No, the Soul's series has the rolling and parry mechanic. In Dark Souls unlike Zelda you can choose the be aggressive if you have enough skill to pull these moves off. It's not about waiting, it is about using what you have as an advantage. Sure, if you cheese with heavy armor and a great shield you have to ""wait"". But for that you progress the game at a slower pace and can't beat enemy's or areas that don't allow you to use armor. If you get good enough at the game you can roll past attacks and hit the enemy when you are at the perfect position, you can parry the Black Knights for example and easily kill them. It's not monotone, it is unique. This game is not the average RPG where you just spam the attack key when the time is right. No one tells you where to go - If you need someone to hold your hand DON'T PLAY THE GAME. I think you don't listen to the NPC's that give you hints on where to go. ""One bell above, one bell below."" Now go explore instead of being a coward. The game is all about you not knowing shit and losing hope, FROM combined the lore with the game mechanics and the players experience, what no game really does at all! If you rage and give up, you go ""hollow"". ""Don't you go hollow"" I don't know how he did not notice that at all when all the NPCs say that line. ""It's too hard"" - That is not a fucking argument that simply means new players have to get good. ""The ending is unsatifying"" - The entire fucking story portrays you as a person who is irrelivant. NPCs laugh at you in the game, people tell you that you are weak and that the world is not meant for you. But you push through and you are given the choice to SPOILERS Sacrifice your life to end the suffering of the curse till it begins anew, or to simply flip the finger to the world and become the dark lord. The ending is supposed to leave you with wonder, not be the finishing chapter of a book.﻿"
GameTheorists,36svzu,Gilga1,7,Thu May 21 22:54:20 2015 UTC,"yea, pretty much. Almost everything about Jirads argument was either false, a half-truth, or focused more on feelings and his impressions of the game."

Thats like saying since there is a bunch of game breaking glitches in the game you cannot blame the game since it was the developer's fault.   ""It's too hard"" - That is not a fucking argument that simply means new players have to get good.   Ah... The old ""git gud"" statement. His argument is that the game is unfair, a game is supposed to be fun, not a chore. When your punishment for failure is going back through a 2 hour gauntlet, there is a problem with your game.

Of course this point of his is subjective, but you cant rebutt it by saying ""You just didnt get it""."
GameTheorists,36svzu,BP_Ray,5,Thu May 21 23:55:44 2015 UTC,"On the difficult argument, I'd actually argue that Dark Souls isn't difficult, despite popular opinion. I never really had trouble with the game, and I went hard mode no shield (which most people use their first time, to make combat easier), and played on PC (which the controls are legitimately crap for, even with the fix someone made). Dark Souls is sort of a game about patience. Not that the fighting takes forever, but to be able to beat the game, you need to learn to observe. People get impatient, and don't observe what the game tells them. Every enemy in the game has a set attack pattern, with windups that make it easy to tell what attack they are performing next. So, if you just observe, it's easy to figure out what they do, and play against it.  Also, the bonfires aren't TOO far back, so backtracking isn't really that bad, usually. Sen's fortress has a pretty unfair one, though, where there is a giant throwing explosives at you, you have to run through and jump off the building to get it. That one was dumb."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Kaminoshi,7,Fri May 22 01:47:55 2015 UTC,"Rebuttal to your rebuttal about it being 'too hard': a game needs challenge that can be beat, with the amount of fun from beating it being directly proportional to the energy required to get past. If it is 100% impossible it will never be beat, so the fun never arrives, but at levels approaching impossible it becomes more fun, as you can show your friends this almost impossible thing you did with a sense of pride."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Samthefab,2,Fri May 22 00:00:51 2015 UTC,"I love challenging games and I got really far into Dark Souls (the part where you fight two bosses at once) before I just said fuck it. I dont think its an awful game and I really appreciate what its going for but I do think its greatly flawed and that other games have done it better.   The gameplay just felt a little clunky and too simple. Strong attack, weak attack, roll. The combat just wasnt intuitive or responsive enough, the hit boxes were wonky, and there wasnt  any feedback when you attacked an enemy.  Not giving you proper tutorials is not adding a fair challenge. Its holding out entire mechanics for players who dont figure out how to use magic, shoot arrows, etc. I need to know my all my options from the very beginning to make the proper calls. Not telling people how the basics only prevents them from playing the game on an even playing field and is honestly just going to make them waste there time using the internet.    3.This might just be me but honestly after so many hours I just lost the feeling of satisfaction. Unlike other difficult games of the past like Devil May Cry, Castlevania, or what have you, you dont have a since of progression. Not having some indicator like an end of a level or even any insight on where I was at in the game just made it feel more like a chore than an enjoyment. Not knowing if the boss I beat was important or even necessary left me with little satisfaction after a time.  I could go on but I'm sure you dont want to read a novel so Ill give you the floor. I do appreciate what this game set out to accomplish and I wouldnt say its awful but I do think they made some significant missteps. Ultimately, the changes I would have made are; actual tutorials, more fluid combat, a bit more intel on where your next goal is (not necessarily just tell the person where to go), and give the player a sense of reward and progression."
GameTheorists,36svzu,saintjimmy64,5,Fri May 22 00:56:46 2015 UTC,"The gameplay just felt a little clunky and too simple. Strong attack, weak attack, roll. The combat just wasnt intuitive or responsive enough, the hit boxes were wonky, and there wasnt any feedback when you attacked an enemy.    I really disagree at this point, except for maybe that the combat is unintuitive. But even that is only true because it's very different from other games.  What many people call clunky combat is actually one of the most ingenious design decisions in Dark Souls. Every action you take is an action that the character will take with you being unable to interrupt them. If you are using a strong attack you character will go through the whole windup, the attack itself and the time it takes to be ready to move again. This allows them to have weapons that deal very high damage with one hit that still are balanced to smaller daggers that can attack more often. It's not about DPS, it's about seeing your window of opportunity for an attack and using it.  I also don't think the combat is simple at all. Strong Attack, Weak Attack, Roll, Blocking, Parrying, Backstabs, Switching between one and two handing, Switching weapons mid fight, Jump Attacks, Kicks, Roll Attacks, using Items mid fight. There is really a lot of stuff going on and you really have a lot of options to go into a fight, even with the exact same equipment.  I think the hitboxes are mostly fine. Dark Souls 2 has some problems with them, though DS2 is a much worse game. I'm not sure what feedback you want from hitting an enemy. You can hear the hit, and see the damage you dealt to him.  I don't disagree with the tutorial aspect, although I think magic and bows in the game are explained enough for people to figure them out easily enough. the bad tutorial aspects mostly come from the online aspects in my opinion and not telling what covenants you enter actually do.  I can't argue your 3rd point, because enjoyment of a game is subjective. Dark Souls has it's problems, but I don't think the video did a good job of showing those problems. I do think however that ""more fluid combat"" would make the game much worse. The slow but determined combat is what makes the game so great for me. You hit hard and you take hard hits think about the actions you want to take and make them count."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Eirh,-2,Fri May 22 11:25:18 2015 UTC,"I always thought. What if they Dark Souls wasnt extremely hard? What if they didnt simply raise the numbers so your character takes more damage? Would they game still be fun if without that difficulty? To me, the answer would be no. I imagine if this game were more than just ""difficult the game"" and I think without that it would be a very bland, boring, forgettable game.  Now maybe Im wrong and maybe thats not a good argument regardless but I always felt that the game was only regarded at all because of its difficulty.  Have you ever played Dragons Dogma? I dont really love the game but I do think its kind of a what Im asking for. Its got (in my opinion) more fluid combat, more gameplay elements, and just generally more to it than Dark Souls but also feels very similar."
GameTheorists,36svzu,saintjimmy64,2,Fri May 22 18:14:15 2015 UTC,"The game was never made to be hard for the sake of being hard, it was made hard so that when you succeed it really feels like an achievement. So yes to change the difficulty would effect the game overall but the same could be said for most games. Most games are about risk and reward, sure some offer fun mechanical interactions aside from that but that to me is only shallow enjoyment, there's no meat to it. Without challenge victory is meaningless. Dark souls makes you work for you victories and so it feels all the more sweeter. There must be something to it if after 800+ hours I'm still able to have fun with it."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Aranha-UK,1 point,Sat May 23 09:18:39 2015 UTC,"My argument isnt because its hard. I actually really appreciate that. I was playing Skyrim yesterday and I was just bored the whole time because of how mindless it all seemed. My argument is that, to me at least, it seems like the difficulty was the only thing in mind when they made it.   Like they didnt put a whole lot of thought into the level design, combat, or story. It just seems like to me like they made a bare bones game and then changed the numbers up so you take more damage. Thats why I was comparing it to Dragons Dogma, which is far from perfect, but does encompass at least some of the things I listed.  I havent played Bloodborne but I keep wondering if theres a little more to offer for me."
GameTheorists,36svzu,saintjimmy64,2,Sat May 23 19:02:19 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know how you can say there isn't much thought in the level design. The way that everything is built on top of each other and the way shortcuts work in this game while still offering a sense of progression still gets me. Not to mention the actual aesthetics of every area are spot on. There are a tonne of little details that add to the cohesion of the world, like that you can see a bunch of different areas from the starting area or that all the enemy placement makes sense in the lore.  There is a whole lot going on in the games story but it isn't focused around the player character, you are just another hollow, destined to keep walking a doomed land. The real story is in all the characters you read about in the item descriptions and the stories the NPC tell you. It turns you into an archaeologist, using item descriptions and the placement of items to piece together the lore for yourself. It was designed to replicate the feel of a japanese guy who grew up reading western fantasy but due to his limited english he was left with large gaps in his understanding and so had to fill in the gaps himself.    When I first played dark souls I had the exact same thoughts but the difficultly really isn't just a numbers thing. Even with a one hit kill weapon if you aren't skilled enough then its easy to be overwhelmed and get killed and even with a high HP pool the same still applies. But yeah like I said the designers never wanted to make it intentionally hard but they wanted victory to be worthwhile and I think that shows.   In terms of bloodborne offering more I'd say if you didn't like souls gameplay then you probably won't like bloodborne. It plays pretty much the same except you have no shield, health regen items dont get replaced at rest or death but are instead a resource and parrying uses an resource every time too so it's harder and some enemies hit harder too."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Aranha-UK,2,Sat May 23 21:25:56 2015 UTC,"That isn't really true, the first generation of games you were meant to lose. Although I personally didn't enjoy those types of games, many people did.   The game is nowhere near unbeatable though. I had a few boss fights where I died 10ish times and eventually won solo. This was offline with no help, and before they patched in more common humanity drops, so I played the game in Hollow form with no NPC help either. For the average player you can summon two other player helpers who will literally clear out the entire level and boss for you, if you really want/need it."
GameTheorists,36svzu,levian_durai,3,Fri May 22 00:27:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly as you said - the game is nowhere near unbeatable. If people complain that it is too hard they either need to put more effort in or stop playing games. ""It's too hard"" should never be taken as a serious detriment to a game, unless the game is some kind of 'gateway' designed to ease new players into a genre."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Samthefab,6,Fri May 22 00:41:12 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I've never felt the souls games were really that difficult. Yea enemies do more damage than you'd expect from most other games, but really even without knowing enemy placements and movesets, with a shield or dodging and having good spacing, you're pretty much good to go.  But Dark Souls 2 I found to be just unfair, throwing super large groups of enemies at you, there's just so many times they'll drop you in the middle of a horde of enemies unless you cheese them with a bow or spells."
GameTheorists,36svzu,levian_durai,0,Fri May 22 02:08:36 2015 UTC,"The original game does not have that error. So again, that is not a good argument. Just play it in Japanese if you don't like the error. Simply yes, get good at the fucking game. Read argument 4 again. If he wants a linear story, the souls games are not for him. All the arguments he made were subjective opinions. I my self don't find the game hard. His other arguments where LIES. Like the humanity one."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Gilga1,1 point,Fri May 22 05:38:21 2015 UTC,"Well thats too bad, because the version of the game we got had the error, therefore its the fault of the game. Get over it, your game is not perfect.  Again thats a shitty argument thats only used response in an unfairly difficult game. If I make a game put 1000 baddies in the way of your objective and you have to kill all of them, and everytime you die you have to restart at number 1 again, my response shouldnt be ""git gud scrub"".   All the arguments he made were subjective opinions.   What a stunning conclusion we've come to, opinions on videogames are subjective. Just like Egoraptors opinions on game design, just like your opinions on Dark Souls, just like Jirairds opinion (assuming this is actually his opinion) on Dark Souls. Getting defensive and says he's wrong whilst pointing out subjective parts and then saying they're subjective is ridiculous.  I cant verify the other points because as i've said, I havent personally played Dark souls."
GameTheorists,36svzu,BP_Ray,6,Fri May 22 11:07:00 2015 UTC,"Well then play the fucking game, or at least watch a playthrough before making statements antagonizing game mechanics you know NOTHING about. The game does not force you to fight 1000 enemies over and over again if you die. The most you'll ever fight from one bonfire (checkpoint) to another is around 50, and in case you didn't know, this game is one of the most heavily-speedrunned game made in the last decade. 99% of the enemies are optional.  You're trying to argue that a game, whose core principle is illogical, but fair difficulty, is unfair because of the trouble you've never had with it. Dark Souls is NOT hard, it's challenging, and once you figure out how to complete an area it become the easiest thing in the fucking world to do. I'm not even that good at the game, and I can beat it in 90 minutes. All the game asks of its player is that they pay attention, and have confidence in the decisions they make. No, it doesn't give you a free pass when you die halfway through a level, and if you have a problem with that then it must suck for you, because you'll be missing out on pretty much every single fucking game made before 1999."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Kanex,2,Fri May 22 16:52:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not antagonizing the game for its game mechanics, read my post. I'm arguing against your flawed points from a perspective of someone whos never played the game and therefore is not biased one way or another.   I never said that the game does make you fight 1000 enemies, i'm using that as hyperbole, either read my fucking comment or dont respond. I was saying that if a game is ridiculously hard like that, and you say ""git gud"" then thats not an argument which is basically what you're doing here. Doesnt matter if an enemy is optional. Every enemy in Zelda is optional if you speed run it save for the bosses, it just takes way too much to figure out how to get past those enemies, and if you try to get past them you presumably cant level up.  Apparently its not easy for Jirard, who was arguing against it. If its easy then people wouldnt hype it up as the hardest game of all time. Also its funny that you say that about games before 1999, because theres tons of games that are fun and hard from before 1999 and i'm sure he's played many of those games. Tedium is not good, never ever ever, saying its a good thing because it adds difficulty is dumb. Having to redo everything you did because the game wouldnt give a checkpoint after an entire gauntlet of bullshit is dumb."
GameTheorists,36svzu,BP_Ray,7,Fri May 22 18:09:33 2015 UTC,"I never said ""git gud"", how about read my comment or don't respond. But even if I did, saying it's not a valid argument is naive as can fucking be. ""Git gud"" is not a game mechanic of Dark Souls, it's a philosophy that applies to every single game ever made with any measure of difficulty whatsoever.  How do you beat Starfox 64? You get good at the game. How do you win consistently in competative fighting/brawler games? You get good at the game. How do you get a high score in fucking TETRIS? You get. good. at. the. game.   The entire point of Dark Souls is punishing lazy gameplay. When you don't pay attention, you die. When you dodge an attack in the wrong direction, you die. When you walk off a cliff because you weren't watching where you were going, you die. You don't die because an enemy did an attack you ""couldn't have possibly seen coming"", or because platforms appear and disappear seemingly at random. You die because you fucked up, even when it seems like the game's fault. Camera went wonky because you backed into a corner and couldn't see what was happening? Don't back into a fucking corner next time. Autolock swung the camera around because the boss moved, and you didn't have time to adjust accordingly? Don't lock on next time. Dark Souls is not ""tedious""- it ALWAYS gives you a checkpoint after a gruelling combat section, and it is not chock-full of ""trial and error"" and ""vagueness for the sake of it"". And if you knew anything about the game, you'd know that you don't have to level up. People have beaten it at level 1. People have beaten it with their bare fists only, beaten it soley in the FP-zoom of the bow, people have done consumable/item-only runs. Once you ""git gud"", there is NO limit to what you can do.  Every single thing in the world is the way it is for a reason, and the only thing the player has to do is suck it up and deal with it. You have to accept that you're just another person doing seemingly aimless shit in a hostile world; you're not special. The only way you're going to overcome the obstacles in your path is by improving your skills, improving your equipment, and overall just learning that bitching about sucking at the game gets you nowhere- kind of like, oh I don't know, real fucking life.   Improving, if you didn't know, is a synonym for ""getting good"". Ergo when people say ""git gud"" they're not telling you to simply ""not suck"" at the game. They're telling you to make the best of the resources you've been given, and LEARN to use them, instead of just rely on the game to tell you what to do, and then streamline your progress like a walk in the fucking park.  Dark Souls is one of the most exploitable games every made, and that's kind of the whole point. You're supposed to exploit the system and make the best of what you've got to become stronger, smarter, and overcome your obstacles.  People say dying over and over again makes the game tedious, and I'll never understand that. What, have you NEVER played a single 2D platformer in your entire life. Mario? Sonic? Motherfucking BUBSY? When you die in those games, it's back to the next checkpoint for you. Yet, no one complains, because ""the game is supposed to be like that"".  Dark Souls shares that principle, and expecting it to be sandbox-as-fuck just because it's an RPG is entirely your fault. Just because you're not good enough to beat the game by its rules doesn't make it a bad game, it makes you an unworthy player. The same goes for Every. Single. Game. Ever. Made.  So I'm sorry you don't have the bare minimum of an attention span enough to swallow your pride and play a game that actually has a learning curve, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a fantastic game. Not flawless, no, but NOTHING is, and if you have a problem with that then you're better off not playing video games at all."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Kanex,2,Fri May 22 19:41:08 2015 UTC,"This comment is all the ""rekt"" in the world."
GameTheorists,36svzu,The5thCourtJester,-5,Fri May 22 19:49:39 2015 UTC,"""It's too hard"" - That is not a fucking argument that simply means new players have to get good.   Lel, yeah you never said get good. Read your own fucking comments or dont respond.   How do you beat Starfox 64? You get good at the game. How do you win consistently in competative fighting/brawler games? You get good at the game. How do you get a high score in fucking TETRIS? You get. good. at. the. game.   My problem isnt ""getting good"" at a game, its when you excuse bad game design by said ""get good"" or alternatively ""git gud"" (Which mean the exact same thing, dont be such a fucking pedant). When a portion of the game is unfairly difficult then saying ""git gud"" doesnt excuse shit, it just makes you look like a tool.   The entire point of Dark Souls is punishing lazy gameplay. When you don't pay attention, you die. When you dodge an attack in the wrong direction, you die. When you walk off a cliff because you weren't watching where you were going, you die. You don't die because an enemy did an attack you ""couldn't have possibly seen coming"", or because platforms appear and disappear seemingly at random. You die because you fucked up, even when it seems like the game's fault. Camera went wonky because you backed into a corner and couldn't see what was happening? Don't back into a fucking corner next time.   Again, bad design. If a camera is bad then thats the fault of the game developers. I'm not going to tackle things I know nothing about, but you're giving me ammo to trash the game with. If the camera fucks up because I walk near a pillar, thats the games fault not mine. This is what we call artificial difficulty, when a player loses because of a shitty unfair mechanic or glitch in the game.   Autolock swung the camera around because the boss moved, and you didn't have time to adjust accordingly? Don't lock on next time.   A game mechanic shouldnt be in the game if it causes your death. Thats dumb, if they have a lock on system then I should be able to play the game through that way just fine.   Dark Souls is not ""tedious""- it ALWAYS gives you a checkpoint after a gruelling combat section, and it is not chock-full of ""trial and error"" and ""vagueness for the sake of it"".   Except for that fortress they described in the video huh?   And if you knew anything about the game, you'd know that you don't have to level up. People have beaten it at level 1. People have beaten it with their bare fists only, beaten it soley in the FP-zoom of the bow, people have done consumable/item-only runs. Once you ""git gud"", there is NO limit to what you can do.   That goes for literally every game ever! You can say that about any unfairly difficult game, that you can play and beat the game on the hardest part because you practice and practiced. You can say this about most arcade games that dont force deaths through cheap ways, despite the fact that they're designed to make you constantly pop in money. If you can enjoy the game due to the stupidly unfair difficulty, then how the hell are you supposed to get so good to the point of using bare hands. If the response is ""thats not the point of the example"" then dont use that fucking example because thats dumb.   Every single thing in the world is the way it is for a reason, and the only thing the player has to do is suck it up and deal with it. You have to accept that you're just another person doing seemingly aimless shit in a hostile world; you're not special. The only way you're going to overcome the obstacles in your path is by improving your skills, improving your equipment, and overall just learning that bitching about sucking at the game gets you nowhere- kind of like, oh I don't know, real fucking life.   Oh gee, I didnt know games were trying to replicate the harshness and unfairness of reality. I cant complain about a game I spent $60 on because its supposed to be like the ""real world"" where I get killed and respawn at the closest location due to a camera fuck up when i'm trying to get to work.   Improving, if you didn't know, is a synonym for ""getting good"". Ergo when people say ""git gud"" they're not telling you to simply ""not suck"" at the game. They're telling you to make the best of the resources you've been given, and LEARN to use them, instead of just rely on the game to tell you what to do, and then streamline your progress like a walk in the fucking park.   Its a fucking tedious videogame, not a job i'm getting paid money for. I dont have to ""suck it up"", its a fucking videogame not real life and its not serious buisness, i'm playing to have fun not do to a fucking chore.   Dark Souls is one of the most exploitable games every made, and that's kind of the whole point. You're supposed to exploit the system and make the best of what you've got to become stronger, smarter, and overcome your obstacles.   Thats dumb if the only way to beat a game is to exploit the system, that doesnt sound like a fun experience to me.   People say dying over and over again makes the game tedious, and I'll never understand that. What, have you NEVER played a single 2D platformer in your entire life. Mario? Sonic? Motherfucking BUBSY? When you die in those games, it's back to the next checkpoint for you. Yet, no one complains, because ""the game is supposed to be like that"".   Hey you know those 2D games that dont have unfair difficulty and dont have camera fuck ups? When you die in those games its usually your fault, and the game never feels ultra punishing when you play them. Die in sonic? Oh well, there was a checkpoint 5 seconds back, no worry. And in later iterations you had save points like in Sonic 3. Same with Mario. If they changed it in later iterations and kept it in later iterations, its because it was a good thing to not make playing the videogame seem like a chore. When you have camera problems in Mario 64 or Sonic Adventure, thats the games fault. When you glitch through something in those two, thats the games fault. Hence why something like Sonic Adventure is constantly ragged on nowadays despite being an admittedly fun game with difficult that wasnt unforgiving, its because it had glitches that made the game unfun.   Dark Souls shares that principle, and expecting it to be sandbox-as-fuck just because it's an RPG is entirely your fault. Just because you're not good enough to beat the game by its rules doesn't make it a bad game, it makes you an unworthy player. The same goes for Every. Single. Game. Ever. Made.   Its the games fault when you die and its something out of your control or just plain unfair like camera problems that you described.    So I'm sorry you don't have the bare minimum of an attention span enough to swallow your pride and play a game that actually has a learning curve, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a fantastic game. Not flawless, no, but NOTHING is, and if you have a problem with that then you're better off not playing video games at all.   I choose not to play it because I know its not my type of game, i'm not a masochist who enjoys dying over and over and being bored half to death. I understand you like the game, and thats more power to you. But anything i'm attacking here is just ammo you're giving me, I cant rag on the core mechanics of the game, i'm only defending the points that I think you're way off the mark on."
GameTheorists,36svzu,BP_Ray,3,Fri May 22 21:18:10 2015 UTC,"All of your complaints of ""bad design"" are things that the player can have full control over if they so choose. Furthermore, you're basing all your knowledge of this game off of a terrible and completely shallow argument in a terrible and equally as shallow video. You can whinge and whine all you want, but you'll always remain disillusioned when you've never played the fucking game. Take it out on me all you want, but much like Dark Souls, I don't care that you're incompetent."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Kanex,3,Fri May 22 21:34:30 2015 UTC,"Christ, that guy's understanding of game design is about that of an autistic goldfish. I love that he's too scared to play a game more difficult than his precious CoD and LoL, so he has to try and convince himself that it sucks by whining about it on the internet like a child. Like bro, do you even inferiority complex?"
GameTheorists,36svzu,The5thCourtJester,-2,Fri May 22 21:40:19 2015 UTC,"All of your complaints of ""bad design"" are things that the player can have full control over if they so choose.    Yes, when they fight against the flawed game system. In a good difficulty you're not fighting against the game itself, you're fighting against the obstacles intentionally placed for you. A good example of this is the DKC franchise where it never feels like the games at blame for your death, its always your fault and not some artificial thing like a camera causing your death.   Furthermore, you're basing all your knowledge of this game off of a terrible and completely shallow argument in a terrible and equally as shallow video. You can whinge and whine all you want, but you'll always remain disillusioned when you've never played the fucking game.   I'm basing it also of what you're saying, unless you're calling your own argument shallow. I dont need to play a game to say something like your argument is wrong when you say that ""Dark Souls is not ""tedious""- it ALWAYS gives you a checkpoint after a gruelling combat section, and it is not chock-full of ""trial and error"" and ""vagueness for the sake of it""."" when its objectively false such as a the fortress in the video. Furthermore you didnt even respond to that point.   Take it out on me all you want, but much like Dark Souls, I don't care that you're incompetent.   lel, great argument mate."
GameTheorists,36svzu,BP_Ray,2,Fri May 22 21:43:40 2015 UTC,Except for that fortress they described in the video huh?   The irony is sickening. In Sen's fortress as soon as you come up the stairs to the top of the fortress you see a giant loading boulders into a hole. He will not attack you unless you get close to him. If you turn right you go down some stairs and fight some generic enemies guarding a chest with a ring in it. If you turn left you go up a flight of stairs on the ground in front of you there are large scorch marks. A giant will then yell and throw a large fire bomb down to that area. This parallels earlier in the game where there is a bridge with burn marks and charred corpses on the ground that when you go on it a dragon swoops down and roasts you. After he throws a bomb you have about 15 seconds before he throws another so you go up another flight of stairs and over by a break in the wall there is an item. If you look down the break in the wall there is a bonfire.   So yes after fighting through that there  in fact is a bonfire. So shut up about things you don't know about.
GameTheorists,36svzu,PM_ME_YOUR_SWORDS,-1,Sat May 23 18:16:47 2015 UTC,So shut up about things you don't know about.   The salt is real.
GameTheorists,36svzu,BP_Ray,0,Sat May 23 18:28:57 2015 UTC,Heres something that none of your points addresses.   I got bored and stopped playing. The opening couple of hours were not enjoyable.
GameTheorists,36svzu,LucidicShadow,1 point,Fri May 22 02:30:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe the game's not for you then, not everyone has to like it. There are plenty of games that I personally don't like, doesn't mean I think they're bad though."
GameTheorists,36svzu,AshleyXero,0,Fri May 22 21:27:17 2015 UTC,"This is true. I very much get the feeling that Dark Souls appeals to the kind of gamers who enjoy games that make them feel competent and skilful. It's a popular kind of game in Japan.   Personally I prefer a strong narrative, or  exploration unhindered by combat, a la Metroid."
GameTheorists,36svzu,LucidicShadow,1 point,Sat May 23 00:35:44 2015 UTC,"Personally I love the game for the feeling of discovery and exploration, as you progress through and realise why the areas are as they are and how some of the monstrous beasts came to be how they are, and just discovering the world and learning what the hell happened."
GameTheorists,36svzu,AshleyXero,0,Sat May 23 12:30:59 2015 UTC,"Just a note, Jirard is lying, he actually likes the game and did not give his opinion in deadlocked, he also has played over 100 hours of it completing the game, for whatever reason instead of using his negatives from his review he instead was forced to just read dumb arguements MatPat gave him."
GameTheorists,36svzu,ULTRAFORCE,0,Fri May 22 12:37:49 2015 UTC,Too true.

GameTheorists,36svzu,tehfurst,1 point,Sun May 24 23:15:03 2015 UTC,"so you are refferring to his first coment on the first deadlock video, well he didnt promise that. he said he would try one episode to end that way (not all of them) also one less scripted."
GameTheorists,36svzu,clacas,2,Fri May 22 15:33:49 2015 UTC,"my guess is that the league of legends one was less scripted which is part of the reason sohinki was able to dominate him as much as he did, so the next one was extremly scripted and ended up making Jirard look stupid even though he has probably played the game more than Mat"
GameTheorists,36svzu,ULTRAFORCE,6,Fri May 22 17:16:16 2015 UTC,"Haven't played Dark Souls, but what I get from this video is that it's essentially like the original The Legend of Zelda but with better graphics, more gameplay options, a RPG-like skill system, not quite as unclear (if not totally unhelpful) hints and less time to develope itself. Let's be honest, basically every one of Jirard's arguments can be applied one to one to The Legend of Zelda, and at the same time these were what made it, literally, legendary.  edit: No, not quite. TLoZ is definitely not too hard gameplay-wise, but all the other arguments of Jirard are translatable to TLoZ."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Blackheart595,4,Thu May 21 22:08:32 2015 UTC,Dark Souls definitely gets compared to the original Zelda often and for a lot of good reasons.  The problem with Jirard's arguments is that a lot of them are just flat out wrong. Honestly I got the impression that he hasn't played the game. For example the 'most essential item in the game' helps you move through about 2 minutes worth of gameplay a bit quicker. I never knew it even existed until my second playthrough. His other points are equally faulty.  I'm very biased as Dark Souls is one of my favorite games. But I'm happy to admit it has a lot of faults. None of them were actually addressed in this video though.
GameTheorists,36svzu,PixelDrake,2,Fri May 22 05:27:22 2015 UTC,"He has played the game, he is just lying for the video. His own video was much better than this. I would assume he has played it more actually then MatPat."
GameTheorists,36svzu,ULTRAFORCE,1 point,Fri May 22 17:14:14 2015 UTC,"Well, just watched his video on it. Was this honestly the same person?  This video makes him sound like an idiot. His original video is well informed and even fairly funny. Why would he do this? If it wasn't for yourself and another reply I wouldn't have bothered to ever look at his content after seeing this Deadlock video.  Sure, I'm probably looking a bit too much in to a 'deadlock' video. But I thought the whole point of Game Theorists was to to look at things in depth. This debate was shallow and a disservice to Jirard. I feel especially bad for Jirard; he put together a really good Dark Souls video. Sorry Jirard, underestimated you."
GameTheorists,36svzu,PixelDrake,1 point,Fri May 22 18:07:39 2015 UTC,"yeah, I don't know I think it may have to do with the fact that Matpat pretty much lost to sohinki when he let Sohinki not have much of a script, but I have pretty much been just going around trying to tell people the fact that for whatever reason Jirard was straight up acting when he gave his opinions on deadlocked https://twitter.com/JKCompletesIt/status/601492857703243776 https://twitter.com/JKCompletesIt/status/601806998695325696"

GameTheorists,36svzu,TweetsInCommentsBot,5,Fri May 22 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I think a good chunk of this argument comes down to preference and nothing too objective from either side.  Aside from the item descriptions just being incorrect. Blame translation issues or whatever, but that's inexcusable."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Tenorsounds,2,Thu May 21 22:18:52 2015 UTC,"I included that wrong item description. TLoZ translated what should have been ""Look for the Lion Key"" with ""10th enemy has the bomb"" (disregarding that this information is pretty much irrelevant). Mistakes happen, but they seldomly destroy games, and a single slight text mistake definitely won't manage to."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Blackheart595,2,Thu May 21 22:55:20 2015 UTC,"Like I mention to the poster above, I'm more referring to the fact that it's one of the few objectively misleading and incorrect elements of the game and not that it ruins the game."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Tenorsounds,1 point,Thu May 21 23:02:16 2015 UTC,"You said it's inexcusable, so... yeah. Might be miscommunication, then."

It's inexcusable, it should not be excused, it's a shitty thing and it's a mark against the game.  But nothing about that word means the whole game is bad or is somehow ruined, and in the grand scheme of things it's not even really that big of a deal. Just want to make sure I'm not ignoring the game's faults, it's something Souls fans are constantly accused of doing and I try to keep the standards a little higher, ya know?"
GameTheorists,36svzu,Tenorsounds,2,Thu May 21 23:14:01 2015 UTC,"All right! In which way is 'inexcusable' usually used in English though? 'Cause in German, it's generally used in the strict way I interpreted it in (meaning that something is so bad that the good things can't overcome that fault)."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Blackheart595,2,Thu May 21 23:44:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, I think it might be an issue of subject agreement. When I said ""it"" was inexcusable I was referring specifically to the mistranslation, not the game as a whole. I was working with the definition ""too bad to be tolerated"", which is what I was trying to express about the incorrect item description."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Tenorsounds,1 point,Thu May 21 23:51:58 2015 UTC,It's one item.  One extremely minor item.  That doesn't make a game terrible.
GameTheorists,36svzu,Zeodex,3,Thu May 21 22:44:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it makes the game terrible, personally I think the fact it was such a huge part of the ""Dark Sucks"" argument to be rather silly. That being said, I can acknowledge that it's one of the few objectively shitty/unfair elements of the game."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Tenorsounds,3,Thu May 21 23:00:49 2015 UTC,"Here is my dark souls story.  A friend of mine lent the game whilst I was at uni. I played a little bit, just up to the taurus demon and kept getting beat and rage quit. I was not ready for what dark souls was going to be and couldnt handle it at the time. I came back to it a few months later except this time I was really going to pay attention to every little detail and not try and brute force my way through like on every other rpg. Once you start paying attention and realizing that death is fine so long as you learn from it then it honestly become one of the most rewarding games ever. I kicked the games arse and have beaten it many more times since.  The game is design to reward the skilled and dedicated in a way I have never really felt before. This game is so skill based that a game that took you 100+ hours on your first playthrough can be done in about 10 in later playthroughs. The game is difficult sure, but not artificially so. Everything can be predicted with careful observation.   Some of the counter points raised in the video are also wrong or not necessarily negatives.  The point about the Rusted Iron Ring being necessary is completely incorrect. It can help in some areas but is not necessary. I didn't know about it until my second playthrough. Also the point about the ending being depressing is kind of pointless too. What was he expecting? We are told  from the start that the world is dying. Besides there are 2 endings anyway.  I will concede that there are some bad translations and  some rushed parts of the game but its worth considering that this game was never intended to be as big as it was. It was a niche release for a small audience but it's the merits of the game that drew so many people to it.  In terms of game design, level design and narrative cohesion there are few games that rival it.  TLDR; The game is tough but fair and very rewarding for those who put in the effort to learn the games intricacies."
GameTheorists,36svzu,Aranha-UK,2,Fri May 22 11:55:09 2015 UTC,"Haha weow... Dark souls isn't even that hard. Beat dark souls NG, NG+ and working on NG++ and the most trouble I had on a boss was S&E and it only took me 3 deaths. Dark souls and Dark souls 2 can't even be compared in the same argument. Dark souls 2 is different, that game is designed to be unfair. I die 6 times getting to a boss because of fucking random shit everywhere you can only avoid if you know its coming, get boss on first try and then dread clearing the next area of minions. While in dark souls everything is presented with good pace as you first enter the zone and can be avoided easily the first time you spot them due to tighter controls along with it consistency with animations."

GameTheorists,36ni0k,Glitchsmasher,5,Wed May 20 17:55:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what miniguns they are using, but I'm going to randomly pick a random minigun from a google search of a minigun.   Here is the one I'm using. Data from Wikipedia.  This gun    weighs 85 pounds. (38.5554 KG)  shoots 2,000 to 6,000 bullets a minute  muzzle velocity is 2,800 ft/sec (853 m/s)   So I'm going to go with, you can not use a minigun as a handheld weapon unless you want to be blasted off your ass.   Also! There is a great What If? Question from XKCD creator that asks if it is possible to use a gun as a jet pack. So you may find that very interesting!  Edit: Formatting is hard"
GameTheorists,36ni0k,varansl,3,Wed May 20 18:21:55 2015 UTC,"I've got to disagree with this.  Lets do some math.  Recoil is the representation of the conservation of momentum.  We take the firearm to behave as a solid body, and for simplicity, lets just put a single round in it.  And at least for this round, we'll pretend that the gun is balanced in such a way that the gun does not experience a torque force.  When you fire a gun, the gun travels backwards at a specific velocity. That velocity comes from m_1*v_1 = m_2 * v_2.  In this case, the velocity of the gun after firing before it experiences any decelleration is equal to the mass of the bullet, times the velocity of the bullet, divided by the mass of the gun.  The GE Minigun fires 7.62×51mm NATO rounds.  The standard bullet of that cartridge weighs 150 grains, or 9.73 grams .00973kg * 853 m/s / 38.6 kg = .215 meters per second.  to counter that force, you need to apply enough energy to bring the gun from that speed back down to zero.  The energy needed is equal to it's kinetic energy, which is .5mv2.  .5 * 38.6kg * .215m/s2 = .892 joules of energy.    What does .892j feel like? Well we can just substitute that answer into another kinetic energy equation.  A regulation baseball weighs 149g.    .892j = .5 * .149kg * v2 solve for v.  We learn that the recoil force of firing a minigun is equivalent to catching a baseball that is thrown at 3.46m/s....a bit under 8 miles per hour.  (According to the Internets, the average 8 year old little league pitcher throws at 5 times this speed.)  Now sure, you're going to be catching 33 baseballs every second, but you can take it.  TL;DR: thanks to it being so heavy, if you can lift the bloody thing, you can fire it."
GameTheorists,36ni0k,verdatum,3,Wed May 20 22:52:05 2015 UTC,"Let me contribute to your statement. The Heavy Weapons Guy himself States exactly what he fires. ""Sasha"" is a 150 kilograms and fires custom 2 rounds at 10,000 rounds per minute.   Now for speculation: 10,000 rpm is optimal; i.e. unless it has been spun up for a while and has a fresh coat of grease it's never gonna reach that. The bullet he holds up in his intro video looks to be at least 7.62 or larger. No doubt he is using rounds of the motherland, which I don't know much about but since he states that he is using custom rounds, and in game the bullets have a fairly slow muzzle velocity, they are probably low grain, soft point, and very light. This would mean that in actuality the gun itself plus the Heavy would have no problem whatsoever handling the recoil. Where lies the problem is lifting the 300 pound beast itself. That's a small elephant!  Recommended tests to verify would be all of the measurements we already have, like rate of fire, recoil, etc. that can be gotten right off the wiki.   TL,DR: the Heavy's weapon would be to heavy for baby team to carry, but can be fired accurately."
GameTheorists,36ni0k,true4evr,1 point,Thu May 21 00:08:59 2015 UTC,What about the centrifugal force of the spinning barrels?
GameTheorists,36ni0k,TheCanadianAlligator,1 point,Thu May 21 00:19:23 2015 UTC,"If you are holding the gun still, they wouldn't have any effect other than to stabilize the weapon, similar to the effect of the spinning wheels on a bicycle.  Curiously though, if the velocities get high enough or the barrel mechanism is heavy enough, there could be problems with conservation of momentum.  The effect would resist attempts to adjust the vertical angle of fire.  The side effect being that it is a bit easier to hold the gun level."
GameTheorists,36ni0k,verdatum,1 point,Thu May 21 00:31:13 2015 UTC,"They look well balanced enough to hold a constant rotation that wouldn't effect the rest of the system. Of the entire weight of the weapon, the barrels take up at most 30 kg. Either way, t this wouldn't effect recoil."
GameTheorists,36ni0k,true4evr,1 point,Thu May 21 01:02:32 2015 UTC,"If you check out the TF2 wiki, they point out how some of the numbers he lists don't exactly compute.  I actually checked the quote before doing my math because I was hoping he named the cartridge weight.  The bullet he holds up, just going by eye, is easily 25mm.  I know how to do the projection math to work that out (I'm a replica prop fabricator, we do that stuff a lot), but I don't think I'm gonna bother.  From there, I could work out a pretty close estimate of the bullet weight.  But again, if he's accurate about the gun weight, it really very probably doesn't matter. that thing is heavy enough, it ain't moving.  Working out the muzzle velocity could be tough/inconsistant, because I don't believe TF2 bullets are affected by gravity (bullet drop), so they can potentially travel far slower than physics would normally allow."
GameTheorists,36ni0k,verdatum,1 point,Thu May 21 00:24:23 2015 UTC,"25mm? Lol no way. Did you mean 5mm? Cause then I might have believed you a bit. He would be clenching it with a full fist at that size. I think, however, he is just holding one of the Sniper's .30-06s for the sake of not modeling a new bullet. The bullets on his chest might be 25mm, I'll give you that. In game, the bullets are some of the smallest and slowest firing of all bullets, meaning they may just be 5mm. Like I said, 10,000 rpm would be optimal, it's probably much smaller. Also remember that this is Russian Bear we are talking about, and the record holder for most weight lifted pulled something like half a ton so maybe the contributors to this subreddit might not be able to lift 330 lbs but... Who am I kidding? No gloves of running urgently are gonna get that massive machine anywhere it needs to go, and you can forget about jumping with it. What is this cold forged steel?"
GameTheorists,36ni0k,true4evr,1 point,Thu May 21 22:21:09 2015 UTC,"9mm handgun rounds are sorta small (bigger than a .22cal, smaller than a .45cal).  5mm would be smaller still than the dinky .22cal.  The bullet Heavy holds up is close to the same width as his finger. My XL-glove wearing index finger is 18mm wide according to vernier calipers.  Heavy's hands are easily XXXXL.  I stand by 25mm.  But since you called me out, I can do the proper projection math this evening.  I estimate the bullets on his chest to be closer to 40mm.  Compare them to the 40mm grenade round in real life.  Here I'm comparing the bullets on his shoulder to the diameter of his eye, which is a measurement that doesn't deviate very much among humans.  I think that's fair since this isn't an anime art-style where eye proportions go out the damned window.  A slower firing bullet may indicate that it is larger.  It takes less energy to accelerate a small bullet than it does a heavy bullet.  Muzzle velocity (at least in the real world) is a function of the bullet weight, the volume of powder, and the length of the barrel (it gets a touch more confusing when the bullet is more narrow than the barrel, as is the case in many assault weapon cartridges).  As far as the relative size of the bullet in-game, I'm afraid I don't have any images or other evidence related to that handy. If you do, I'd love to see it; I'm hoping I don't have to reinstall the game just to measure bullets in-flight while trying not to get fragged (I kinda really suck at this game).  Yes, I agree with the measurements on the TF2 wiki regarding his gun's true firing rate. They also say 10k rounds per minute is high.  I'm not sure where you saw the phrase ""cold forged steel"", or why you want to know what it is, and I may just be reading you wrong.  But as a hobbyist blacksmith, I love talking about that sort of thing.  Cold forged steel refers to steel that has been pressed to the point of deforming while near to room temperature. This changes the crystal structure and, without heat treatment, introduces stresses. This also causes the strength (resistance to bending) to increase.  Cold forged steel would generally not be used in making firearms, because firearm components are either machined, or hot-forged, and when appropriate in either case, quench hardened & tempered.  If you hot forge a piece, it undoes all the benefits of cold-working.  And if you machine a part, you don't want to use cold-forged steel because those introduced stresses are able to release as the piece is weakened by the reduction in size, resulting in warping and other such deformities which are bad news for making machines such as firearms with complex moving parts."
GameTheorists,36ni0k,verdatum,1 point,Thu May 21 23:28:36 2015 UTC,"I get where you are coming from, but I was thinking in more of firing mutliple rounds, not a single one. A single one you can control, but when you are firing several(Like in the video games s/he is referring to). When you are doing controlled bursts, you would fall over more than likely. You can look at firing SMGs or LMGs, when you fire them, they go up due to the amount of force they are exerting, a minigun would be far more. You can look up videos of people(most likely very inexperienced people) firing weapons and getting landed on their asses from a small handgun.   But I do like your argument! Well thought out and made me think!"
GameTheorists,36ni0k,varansl,1 point,Thu May 21 00:32:47 2015 UTC,"""small"" is the keyword here. Because these guns are smaller, they have a fraction as much momentum so the kinetic energy of the recoil becomes much higher.  I'll verify this with math in a bit; gotta run.  And as far as tip-rise, that's partially related to the torsional recoil, which I lazily skipped by saying that the thing is awesome balanced.  I can also say that the spinning barrel would cause angular moment that would actively fight against this barrel rise. But I'd have to do more math or research to see how it works out between those two forces."
GameTheorists,36ni0k,verdatum,1 point,Thu May 21 00:42:43 2015 UTC,"Uzi 9mm, one of the most iconic SMGs. Weight: 3.5kg Muzzle velocity: 400m/s bullet weight: average for the 9mm variants is 8.5g  3.5kg*V = 400m/s * .0085kg  Gun velocity therefore equals .971m/s giving the gun a kinetic energy of 1.65 joules. twice as much recoil energy as it would be to fire a minigun.  Smith & Wesson Model 29 (the iconic Dirty Harry gun, well known to kick like a mule). 1.18kg (with a 4'' barrel). bullet weight 13g, muzzle velocity 391m/s  math math math,  recoil velocity 4.30m/s  and we get 10.95 joules of recoil energy, over twelve times as much recoil as the minigun.  m16 automatic rifle. 4kg, 948m/s, 4g bullet  v = .948m/s recoil energy: 1.80 joules, twice as much as the minigun.  yup, the heavy-ass minigun is nice and stable."

GameTheorists,36ni0k,varansl,2,Thu May 21 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"So we just need to put the thing on a really well designed dolly. Then we can wheel it around.  That said, I checked it out, and according to a 2003 survey, US soldiers in Afghanistan were carrying an average of something like 83 pounds of gear.  So if you just designed a good counterbalance mechanism (basically like the badass harness-mounted counterbalanced smartgun from the movie Aliens), and you could get by without carrying any other gear, then, yeah, it might be possible; just unfeasible as Hell."

GameTheorists,36ni0k,verdatum,1 point,Wed May 20 22:28:53 2015 UTC,"In TF2, the heavy is very large. We can say that he would probably be able to swing around a 50Kg gun with no troubles (and miniguns weigh less than that). However, when firing he is able to stand completely still. This is completely impossible, as the number of bullets per second and the weight of the bullets would push you backwards from the recoil. He would be unable to move forwards at all, and would slowly slide in a direction opposing the direction of fire. Even 'small' guns like shotguns provide large amounts of recoil that push the user backwards, and the constant barrage of bullets would make the minigun far, far worse.   TLDR: They might be able to hold it, but if they actually fire that thing they would get knocked off their feet."
GameTheorists,36ni0k,true4evr,1 point,Wed May 20 19:18:48 2015 UTC,I was also wondering about power. How much juice would it take and could you power it with batteries? I know the power isn't in the ammo like other guns.
GameTheorists,36ni0k,mozziedoo,1 point,Wed May 20 19:22:04 2015 UTC,"The electric motor powers the rotation, and at least with the GE, I believe it also powers the firing pin.  If you ever watch The Slingshot Channel on youtube, Jorg has made a couple gattling gun slingshots, including a TF2 Heavy slingshot.  His devices are often powered by a cordless drill.  They do not run as fast or do as much work as a real minigun.  Anyway, you'd probably be able to power the thing using a car-battery."
GameTheorists,36ni0k,Samthefab,1 point,Thu May 21 00:37:38 2015 UTC,I remember playing a game where you were pushed back by the minigun's recoil. I think it was Fallout NV but I'm not sure.

GameTheorists,36ni0k,loganlightcap,1 point,Fri May 22 10:51:27 2015 UTC,"Then we solve one problem but encounter a new one. If the gun is 150kg then due to inertia the recoil would appear far less, but the heavy would probably have trouble swinging around a 150kg gun and walking forwards while firing. So he would probably be motionless while firing."

He is slowly becoming more of a man. This is shown when you level up, you get to unlock newer and more advanced choppers. As for the boss fights, they are normal. It is just an animating choice to make them look like hallucinations, and they cut to the next scene. Maybe Citra just brought Jason back.

GameTheorists,36arok,Mellonote,5,Sun May 17 21:45:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think MatPat's conclusion is correct(respectfully).  He focused on arterial perfusion but should have also considered venous pooling.  The legs veins are very large, and do not actively pump blood back to the heart, the muscles around them do that, in concert with venous valves that provide one way flow.  In high +G maneuvers the leg veins over-fill with blood due to increased G force and that blood has an impeded return to the heart.  A pilots leg muscle do work on the rudder, but it is not large muscle movement.  Therefore there will be less venous return in high G maneuvers, less blood for the heart to pump, and less perfusion of the brain.  Thus a blackout.  Remove the legs, remove the pool, and reduce the risk of blackout.  Source: Doctor and Pilot and Gamer"

GameTheorists,36arok,furluge,2,Fri May 22 13:13:35 2015 UTC,"This is the first time I disagree to one of his videos, here is what I posted in the comment section on youtube: ""Ok, I don't pay too much attention in my biology class, but from what I've learnt about the circulatory system I would like to argue that amputating your legs would actually give you an advantage to withstand fluctuating g forces. Because the distance the blood has to travel to the bottom of the body and back to the heart is smaller, the energy the heart has to use also becomes smaller, if this is true then in a situation where blood flow to the brain is counteracted by an external force the heart can then use the surplus of energy to direct more oxygenated blood to the brain faster and more easily."" Anyone agree? Or am I alone on this?"
GameTheorists,36arok,actualkarlis,12,Sun May 17 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"No, he's right. Your heart has plenty of energy to push blood around your body, even at more than several Gs. Energy isn't the problem. The problem is after your heart pumps your blood down to your legs you don't have a second heart in your feet to pump the it back up. Normally contractions from your leg muscles are enough to slowly push the blood back up while valves in your veins keep it from falling back down. This usually works great under normal gravity and physical activity, but it isn't strong enough under Gs.  G-suits work by placing pressure on the abdomen and legs to force your blood into your upper body. It temporarily squeezes the blood back up and then stays inflated so blood can't flow back down. This helps blood not to pool under the heart and allows the heart to keep pumping blood to the brain. Amputating the legs doesn't address this problem. The lower overall volume of blood is still as easily pooled in the upper legs and abdomen, and unless you amputate the legs and abdomen too, an amputee would still need a g-suit."

GameTheorists,36arok,saintjimmy64,5,Mon May 18 02:46:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would take less energy to pump blood through your veins, but since your heart has less work to do, it will get weaker, it will atrophy - just like any other muscle in your body.

GameTheorists,364zki,Captonjamason,5,Sat May 16 04:52:21 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go ahead and have a go at this.  According to the official wiki, the gravity of players and other living mobs is about 32 m/s2 - which seems incredibly high, but we'll roll with it - and using your estimations of time falling from a specific hight, we can calculate the speed of which players would be falling at.  Now, there is a limit to how fast players fall, which is also mentioned on the official wiki, as 78.4 m/s. Based on what we know so far, we can calculate that it would take 78.4/32 = 2.06 second to reach terminal velocity, so the last test at 100 meters is essentially useless, as players would have reached terminal velocity at that point.  One thing I noticed in your calculations was that you used two different kinds of units. Lets try again this time, but stick to meters per second.   0.71 seconds * 32 m/s2 = 22.72 m/s 1.29 seconds * 32 m/s2 = 41.28 m/s 1.90 seconds * 32 m/s2 = 60.8 m/s   Lets use the last one as example, to simplify matters.  Hitting ground at 60.8 m/s in Minecraft, would result in change of velocity very, very quickly, and would cause about the same damage as if you were to jump 20 meters on Earth, considering that Steve is used to living in 3.2 G's.  But that's not why we are here, we need to know how much water is required to stop that speed. I can't find any useful sources that tell you how much the water would slow one down, but considering that Steve lands with feet first, there wouldn't be much drag to slow him down anyways.  Lastly, I can tell you quite surely that, for a real life human, it would most likely kill you, but then again, a real life human living in 3.2 G's would be pretty tough anyways. However, for Steve, it could be surviveable, but very much barely, similar to how falling 20 meters for a human is survivable, but also very much barely.  TL;DR, Steve is dead, and has been for a long time. Perhaps he is in purgatory, and Herobrine is but a demon sent to forever torture him?  Apologies for any mistakes or errors I've made along the way, please keep in mind that I am an idiot.  For any future theories you'll try out, remember to use SI-units, and always use the unit in the result of the calculation, that fits with the units you popped into the calculation.  That'll be all I have to offer for now. Bye!"

Water is much different in Minecraft than in real life, and we know this because of how things explode in the water. The water doesn't react to the explosion, and it seems to absorb all the energy that is released during the explosion.   How much energy does the water absorb to act as a shock, cushioning steve from any damage in that ~1m block? Do we have anything like that in real life?

Is fault of the internet and social media.   8.- We theorists analyze all reffering to games and their characters, that include boobs, so how we know if a character have a real pair or a full-of-silicon ones?

Shinji Ikari lives in Tokyo-3 due to the original Tokyo being destroyed in his series, but his favorite teams would probably be FC Tokyo or Tokyo Verdy.

Personally I tend to believe that the games are hallucinations themselves.  Or, rather, visions you might have of the residual energies left at the location.  The paranormal is canon for this franchise, so for myself, I would rather look to the paranormal when theorizing.  It is common for those who study and actively investigate the paranormal to have hallucinations for visions of what caused the disturbances in the energies in the first place. Who says that this couldn't be the case here?  Perhaps each minigame is nothing more then you powerlessly going through the same motions of the people involved ?"

GameTheorists,361bsn,Dungeongrindz,1 point,Fri May 15 20:21:28 2015 UTC,"Perhaps so, but ()), that is purely up to speculation, there are many games that use that scenario, or rather, play it in as a possible outcome. That's the beauty of theories like that, if done with enough research and good effort to make your claim, that is what I believe to be the very essence, and, purpose of theory in general. I , myself personally, LOVE the mystery and wonder in which some of those theories are shrouded. It sparks conversation, raises questions, and the benefit is that it brings us theorists together as a community, and they make a pretty darn good story. Yes I will agree that the idea itself is a lazy half-baked concept sometimes, but that can apply to any theory really, it just depends on how hard you want to work to make your point or theory valid to others, and that my friend is what being a theorist is all aboot. That said I have put up a post in youtube about seeing into the Squall is dead theory from FF8, I don't know if it is something that is old hat, but ((), based on what I have looked into so far, there are many different interpretations of the actual story behind that game.

Personally, I subscribe to a more paranormal theory, since it is, well, cannon for the franchise.  I'm surprised Matpat didn't think about it from that point of view since the entire game is based on possession and residual energies.  Also? The purple guy was portrayed in different hues, different heights, and of course with and without a badge.  This theory could be partially right, but I just don't buy that the purple guy was one person, but rather several suspects.  One of them could of been the phone guy.  Hell, one of them could of been you ( throw back anyone?)!  Which would also explain why we still don't know who he is. Think about it."

GameTheorists,35xzs6,SevenZee,1 point,Thu May 14 16:25:28 2015 UTC,"Because he's a murderer and incredibly pissed that the kids he killed got him stuck in a suit for who-knows-how-long?  I mean, I'd be pissed too. He deserved it yeah, but obviously he's gonna be pissed.  [I'm not referring to this gif only, I'm going off the general assumption that Springtrap canonically kills you in FNAF3 if you get caught. Could be wrong though.]"
GameTheorists,35xzs6,silverfoxventura,1 point,Sun May 17 23:07:57 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, not to mention that he was a sociopath before his death.  We don't know enough about his mental health to confirm this completely, but I'd say it's safe to assume that he would kill anyone.    His jumpscare is also different then the children's.  This could be because they have completely different motivation for coming after you in the first place.  I think it's a good possibility that the children didn't intend to kill you in the first place.   You may have just died from a heart attack from the shock.  Think about it, if you were aware of the lore and some gruesome looking animatronic came screaming in at you, you might just be scared to death.  Yes, that is a real thing.  Once you're dead, they could be attempting to stuff you into the suit in order to give you new life as was done to them.  Children don't always understand, and it's more believable to me (as someone who works with kids) that the spirits would want to fix what they broke before they got found out and got into some sort of trouble, or simply wish to make you better the only way they know how.    Springtrap on the other hand would not be thinking like a child, because he isn't.  He also has a different way of going about things.  He moves more deliberately and manacingly then the playful, almost innocent actions of the children.  Misery loves company, and I can bet he is pretty miserable.  Plus, old habits die hard.    You can also take forensic psychology into account and bring up the age old addiction theory.  Killing got some is like taking highly addictive drugs.  That's why serial killers generally don't start with murder, especially not people.  They get a taste of the high from murder.  Each time they kill, the high becomes less and less effective so they are forced to up the anty every time.  A cat, then a dog.  Next might be stalking, or rape.  Each crime lessoning the high.  Springtrap could very well be looking to satiate his bloodlust, to quench his withdrawal.  He needs to kill.  He needs it like I need a Dr Pepper."
GameTheorists,35xwy4,GameAddictsDimples,3,Thu May 14 13:04:48 2015 UTC,"My Theory: As they're building on the Close-combat basis from other Final Fantasy games, we're looking mostly at the slashing attack of the gunblade. If you notice, Squall never fires the magnum attachment of the gun at any sort of distance, and the player is informed to press the trigger as the hit connects with the enemy. Even his limit break Renzokuken has you hitting the trigger on each contact.   The graphic we get for a successful is actually an explosive flame (like you said), and not gunsmoke or a bullet, so I have 2 theories as to what the ""Gunblade"" actually fires.  First, if you assume it does use magnum rounds in the chamber, there's a chance that as the bullet leaves the chamber, it hits the blade and becomes an additional scatter shot that hits the enemy in multiple places, as well as the first slash, causing lots of extra damage. The blade sustains the damage because it's a fantasy world, they can have metals that don't break... hell, the other games of the series often use mythril in an armor set, and even Gold armors (which can't be made out of actual gold... too weak)  The other theory, they have magic that they can draw from enemies and around the world, maybe there's a Fire spell embedded in the firing chamber that is weak enough to not drain the draw charge, and causes an explosion at a range close to the blade. The muzzle ensures the spell only fires outward, and not in an unrestricted explosion cloud, which could explain why the damage boost isn't particularly great."
GameTheorists,35xwy4,kevinsyel,1 point,Thu May 14 20:23:20 2015 UTC,"I think your second theory makes the most sense. At least to me. When you use the R1 trigger in the game, it creates a red cloud like an explosion. Fire magic imbedded in the blade or even the trigger would make the most sense on why this would happen. If the blade cut the bullet to make a scatter shot effect, I think Squall would be in danger of potentially getting injured since he's so close to the enemy.  Also, I did take a look at the Skallagrim video and although I agree with him with his opinions. I'm more looking to see how the Gunblade would potentially work in real life. Where his main argument was the vibrations, I wonder if there would be a way past that. Maybe the magnum part of the sword is there just to shoot out something, even if its not harmful, which is why I suggested the flash powder. Maybe its to confuse and blind the enemy. I dunno. Food for though."
GameTheorists,35xwy4,Stereotypy,2,Fri May 15 13:09:31 2015 UTC,"iirc isn't the gunblade's blade straddling the center of the gun's muzzle? i mean, that makes the gun part pretty pointless, right? gun with bayonet exists for a reason"
GameTheorists,35xwy4,clacas,1 point,Thu May 14 16:16:42 2015 UTC,"yeah! thats why bayonet where such a good weapon, in gamming there are other good examples of merging a fire weapon and a sharp melee weapon like this one or  this one"

GameTheorists,35xwy4,Alvonzo,1 point,Thu May 14 19:26:32 2015 UTC,"To me, the Flash Powder makes the most sense. Its probably the least dangerous and it can create a flash to blind the enemy. Although, the problem with that, is that Squall would also be affected.   In the opening cinema, when Squall prepares to slash Seifer across the face, the screen goes white like a flash. Perhaps you're right, moreover, maybe that's why the fight ends there, maybe Squall was already blinded by Seifer's gunblade and that upwards attack was him just lashing out blindly.  Cool theory!"
GameTheorists,35xwy4,master_dimentio,1 point,Fri May 15 23:58:29 2015 UTC,"Not my own research but Skallagrim on youtube did a video here on the topic, and his opinion of the weapons is pretty bad. There are a lot of major flaws with almost every aspect of the design adding up to make what, in reality, would be a terrible weapon."

I'm a huge fan of the Game Theorists, and I have a good amount of experience moderating! I currently moderate /r/passtheparagraph, another subreddit about the same size as this one. I did all of the CSS over there, starting off with the theme from /r/Naut, and heavily modifying it. However, all of the CSS I did for /r/Artifexian (The subreddit for another youtuber, I definitely recommend that you check his videos out!) was from scratch, so it is definitely a great representation of what I can do.  I am active during the week from 3:00 P.M. to 9:00 P.M. Pacific Time Zone (located in California), and on the weekends from 7:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M.  By the way, I hope your tour goes well!

GT should be fun but the FNaF videos have cause a lot of undue stress on MattPat and is almost the only thing that the fans are talking about. Don't get me wrong, I love those videos.. but it's too much. Also, new theory.. the creator of FNaF is a fan and keeps making games to mess with MattPat."

GameTheorists,35im2p,TheRandomR,7,Mon May 11 03:24:36 2015 UTC,"I agree.  You know, I started watching GT videos like ""Wario Fart Rocket"" and ""SonicIsNotThatFast"", and I was amazed thinking in the effort to calculate all of that and making a video about it to tell people that something make/doesn't make sense in a video game. Then I watched some more that teached me more about culture in other parts of the world (thx Gaijin), and all the ""BUT HEY, IT'S JUST A THEORY"" kind-of-video where MatPat makes crazy theories that still makes sense.  When new videos come out with ""NotDeadlyBulletBill"" and ""The HookillingShot"", the hype increased. I like that kind of video and I want more. And now, there's lots of FNAF videos, with some other new type of videos that still need a time to the public ""start to like"". It kind of sucks for the people who, like MatPat said, ""overthink"" video games, but in a mathematical way. Or by the lore that the game have and we kind of exploit it to make crazy stuff appear. and not just create something new that fits the game  I miss old math videos too, buddy."

I never watched any lets play of FNAF or played it myself, but I was REALLY interested in the story because I like complex creepy stories. That whole thing has a surreal SCP-atmosphere.  For everyone who really thinks ""FNAF destroys GT"" - give it a week, the hype will decrease. Wait for the next theory and we will have new things to talk about.  Peace."

Immaturity comes in all colors and can be found in ANY fan base.  Matpat got me into FnaF with his first video on the franchise and it's become a hobby of mine now.

But instead of bratty kids, it's cynical jackass ""mature people"" [Im 99% sure they aren't adults tbh, but want to pass as them..] who frequently make ShitPosts cursing out all kids of the fandom [even the decent ones] and basically fun-policing.  The FNAF fandom honestly needs its own forum or something where there's a relatively strict joinng process to prove you arent a bratty art-thieving child who is totally unreasonable, or a general jackass with no regard for anyone. A relatively small, welcoming community that artists could theoretically post art to and not have to worry about it being ganked, because it would be unviewable without an approved account.  sigh.

I completely share Mat's opinion on the subject (If they keep making new FNAF videos I'll kill myself too.) and I'm pretty positive that a LOT of people are tired of these episodes. I started watching GT because I felt smarter without doing freaking homework, and these episodes seem a bit TOO useless. For example the Mario is Mental episodes: Even if they talked about how a fictional character is mentaly unstable, they still taught you something about psycology. These episodes, on the other hand, don't really teach you anything apart from Dunlap Nathan's story. I still apprecciate the extremely hard work of MatPat in doing these episodes, everyone should, but I feel like they lose the essence of GT, which was to teach with videogames."

It's important to remember that as nerds, we love to dissect and analyze things, often to a degree that was never intended by anyone on the creation end of the spectrum.  We pretty much live in Everyone Is Jesus In Purgatory-land, and while it can be fun, it isn't really productive, per se.  Plus, sometimes it's just flat-out wrong because we invent intent and meaning where none was intended.  That being said, the primary value of any artistic medium is the experience it gives you as the participant, so if this sort of theorizing helps you love a game more, go nuts!

GameTheorists,35fr22,AndJellyfish,1 point,Sun May 10 09:48:11 2015 UTC,"Past that the world, whilst looking generated, doesn't actually exist and you fall through the blocks   You're kinda right on that. If you use the cheats, or the debug mode, you can simply teleport yourself to any point of the map and if it's not already generated, the world will just build it up for you.   Yes, there is a limit, but not in this idea of 'falling trough the blocks'. Remember what I said about the mathematical logic behind Minecraft? So, as you proceed to this suposed 'end of the map' the equation will 'ran out of numbers' that are to be used together, thus it will start generating some crazy landscapes with floating earth, oceans above your hand and blocks in places where that they are not supose to be.  In other words, you would streeeeeeeeeetch the logic in which Minecraft is built to the point where it wouldn't make much logic. You PC will be like ""Wait, I am not trained to create from this point ahead... sooooooo, here: have some lava floating above your head in a underground cave with and ocean around you."" :P  I know that there is a video in Youtube where it's shown just like what I told you, but I'm having a hard time finding it.

If picking up the phone starts the recording, how does that even work?   In the past, mean the 80's and 90's before Flash memories and usb, the people used to record messages in tapes (like the ones showed in the MatPat video) that were used to automatically send any kind of message.  Besides, the sound of ""Picking the phone"" is not recordered, is you (the player) hanging up the phone.  was something like this: http://www.connected-earth.com/Journeys/Livingwithtelecommunications/Livingonthenetwork/Telephonesandprivacy/DEL525n.jpg  In the rest you have messed up the identity of  ""Phone guy"" and ""Phone Dude"" they are diferent persons, Phone Dude is the one you are referring in FNAF3...

GameTheorists,35bux8,Toastrz,7,Fri May 8 20:36:32 2015 UTC,"I think he wrote as much as he had in his head at the time into the story.  As MatPat originally brought up, FNAF 1 is essentially a send up to a real-life situation in Colorado, but everything from FNAF 2 and 3 is straight fiction, which subtly suggests a writing break of sorts between the two periods.  I'd wager that he came up with most of the expanded headcanon after he realized he had a runaway success on his hands."
GameTheorists,35bux8,letuotter,5,Fri May 8 20:58:07 2015 UTC,"Still, it's a miracle that all the elements from FNAF 1 would have been unwittingly set in place for further plot development.  Things like Golden Freddy being a spring-lock suit from the original Freddy Fazbear's Pizza (something not introduced until the third game, which Scott wouldn't have seen coming even after the FNAF 1 success) and the crying child posters that he then modeled the Puppet after would be one of two things.

My first point is the timing of the Springtrap event.   I think the springtrap event happened after FNAF 1 but well before FNAF 3.  Look at the place. In the cameras in FNAF1, the place is run down but not yet boarded up. It's still in operation, otherwise why even have a security guard? The animatronics can't get out during the minigames, the exits and windows are blocked.  In the minigames, the place is boarded up and leaking. There are puddles on the floor and rats scurrying around, something you see no evidence of in FNAF 1. FNAF 1 is in better condition. Not by a whole lot, but enough to not be at the same timeframe or just after.  This does mean, of course, that if the phone guy does get jumped and killed in Night 4 of FNAF 1, that he can't be purple guy. The other thing about it is if FNAF 1 takes place after the minigames, then there is no way that the animatronics would be after Mike at all as they would already be dismantled.   Now yes, they could be reassembled, but the place being MORE run down and arguably abandoned in the FNAF3 minigames points to it being after FNAF1, when we saw that it was about to close.   As has also been pointed out elsewhere on this subreddit, the back room was mentioned in training tapes, and was a place where people were hanging out. ANY employee of Fazbear's Pizzeria at the time would have known where the safe room was. This does mean that all of our later security guards wouldn't have known, however, that much is true. I also strongly agree with MatPat's theory that the FNAF1 location is actually the first Fazbear's Pizzeria location.   I suspect that the Purple Guy is a former employee, and that the closest we get to meeting him (before FNAF3 I mean) is that he is the daytime security guard in FNAF2. That's all. I mean think about it.   Purple guy murders the first kid outside of Fazbear's Family Diner, doesn't get caught. He begins to develop his signature style, and gets a job at the first Fazbear's Pizzeria as a security guard. He doesn't get caught but the place gets shut down. He gets brought over to the new place as the night security guard where the animatronics are now acting WEIRD and gets put onto day shift, where he has access to the kids and kills five more.   Here he's caught, and fired/arrested/whatevs. But the new animatronics are now acting weird because he tampered with them, and the old animatronics are still haunted. Then the Bite happens.   Cut to FNAF1 where we are BACK at the original locale, with the old still haunted animatronics. Phone guy dies, Mike (presumably) lives. That place closes down too due to too much negative association/lack of funds, and gets boarded up. But Purple Guy serves out his sentence or maybe gets out on appeal/bail and goes back to Fazbear's Pizzeria, now obsessed with the animatronics and dismantles them. He gets confronted with the ghosts of his first victims, and leaps into Springtrap and...well you know the rest.   But hey....that's just a theory...."
GameTheorists,35etnu,Diamanka,1 point,Sat May 9 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"Phew! Man that was a lot of fnaf theory to read. Such good insight though. Beam me up Scotty. (Sorry, bad joke)  But now that I think about it, the less I agree. I think you got the timing of the disassembly wrong. You say it happened between 1&3, but there is more evidence to say that it was between 2&1. The building is run down, leaking, has rats on the floor. They were probably in the process of remodeling. That would explain why the safe room was open in the fnaf3 mini games. I would also Like to point out the disassembly of the toy animatronics and foxy. The toy animatronics could have been brought over to be used as spare parts. And as for foxy, purple guy knew that foxy was on the blink, so he disassembled foxy to make his life easier (the bugger's quick). And now to explain another piece of evidence. The cupcake on the desk. That cupcake was a signature of toy chica. And I can't say it was old Chica's because she is never once seen with it. That means that toy chica was disassembled, thereby proving that it happened between 2&1.  Oh, and one other thing, if purple guy was caught, he would be tried, found guilty, and executed. So, I see no way to come back in physical form."

But, what you're saying isn't really evidence for what you're suggesting.  When Phone Guy says ""check those spare heads in the back room"" or whatever he's clearly referring to the storage room you see on camera with all the spare parts.  The safe room has been boarded up and so mike wouldn't know about it hypothetically, unless he was told somewhere outside of gameplay about the room on the premises as a security guard, but we can't assume that.  But since there's no spare heads in the Springtrap room it's obvious he wasn't talking about that one even if Mike did know, which there's no indication or reason he would."
GameTheorists,35etnu,dahuterchuter,1 point,Sun May 10 04:40:02 2015 UTC,"That is not necessarily true. He could be referring to the storage room, but he specifically says ""back room."" The room you are referring to is ""backstage."" It even says so in the camera feed. Now, coming from a show setting, I find it very hard to believe that a guy who is so careful about how he says things would make that mistake. And before everyone yells at me that golden Freddy is in the kitchen, I would like to say that is a clear health violation, So he cannot be there."

Two, I would like to elaborate one something phone guy says, and, I will let him speak for himself: ""we had a spare in the back, a yellow one, someone used it. Now none of them are acting right."" Phone guy refers to the back room as the safe room because purple guy used spring trap (where springtrap was being stored). I don't think he would have called Parts and service ""the back room"" particularly because parts and service is visible on camera."

GameTheorists,35etnu,DJCouttyboy123,1 point,Wed May 13 15:10:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah because depending on the location the safe room could be in the back as well.  The point being that you need to use fairly obvious context clues to see what he means here: 1.  He says to check the spare heads in the back room.  There are no heads in the the safe room, meaning he must be talking about the backstage area where they keep the spare heads. 2.  The safe room is boarded up and sealed at that point in time so he's likely not telling Mike to go check it if he couldn't get into it. 3.  Mike doesn't even know anything about the safe rooms.  They were closed up before his hiring and he never received info on them in his training, since we hear his training, and it makes no mention.  It's very easy to know what he's talking about."
GameTheorists,35etnu,DJCouttyboy123,1 point,Wed May 13 19:10:16 2015 UTC,"Nope. That doesn't stand for much I'm afraid.  1: Phone guy says that the safe room is always off camera. 2: keep in mind that the messages are prerecorded. This means that phone guy could have recorded them at any time. With this in mind, he could have recorded these during a time frame where the safe room isn't ""boarded up"" (it's was a false wall). 3: well whoop de do! Does anyone walk into their first day at work without even knowing where his desk is? No, therefore, we can assume he knows the building's layout, and therefore, about the safe room.

Because if Gaijin, Drake, Ronnie, or Ferret ever upload something during a big hype like the FNAF theories, its hurts their content and their ability to do their work.   The devils advocate is, something this popular is great for continuous exposure to the channel. Because the whole FNAF and GT communities were tuned in to it (albeit with some hostilities). At the very least you have a while before this returns with FNAF4 or the movie. I look forward to Deadlock/Game Theory! We appreciate all of your hard work."

It is obvious how hard you worked on it, how careful you were to try to explain things in a way that would be provocative but not generate too much vitriol.  You did an excellent job creating a piece of good entertainment.  It'd be great to see you participate in this sub more, but I'm pretty sure most of us understand how it is.  It isn't easy to Youtube as a day job (which you grasp more than most; your meta-youtube eps are among my favorites), and the controversial nature of your output must make social interaction with the community even more troublesome.  CinemaSin's Jeremy  has done a good job of ignoring the crazier people on his youtube channel, and using /r/cinemasins as a place to come and have a 3rd-party-moderated, and therefore more relaxed place to communicate with his more chill fans; if you haven't, you may want to check that out and see if you can draw some inspiration from it.  Don't let the fans, be they positive or negative, get to you too much.

GameTheorists,357bh0,UnovaWarriorX,3,Mon May 18 00:46:04 2015 UTC,"Dude, please know that the vitriol you receive is a vocal minority of fans. I'll admit, I was chomping at the bit waiting for this episode to come out, but I knew you have a lot of work to do on this stuff and assume that GT isn't the only thing you have going on.   I think a lot of YouTube watchers get into this mindset that they're owed something by the channels they watch. Just look at the Game Grumps community for example - they lost their shit over an episode being a whole four minutes shorter than expected, like it was some big travesty that signaled the decline of the channel. Even that, though, was a vocal minority. Most were quick to point out that hey, it's not like we pay for it and hey, both of the other episodes that day were much longer than the expected ten minutes.   I guess what I'm getting at here is that some very vocal of YouTube watchers feel like it's your job to feed them what they want, NOW. I think it's important as fans to approach it from the standpoint of being delighted whenever an episode comes out, and important for you as a content creator to realize that while we aren't nearly as loud as the angry and entitled, I think we're certainly more numerous.   I (and so many others) love your show and look forward to the next episode.  ...that out of the way, I am a little confused about part of your theory. If Phone Guy prerecorded the messages for you in FNAF1, and the last of those messages is recorded after he's dismantled the animatronics, as he's being attacked by the spirits and about to get into the springlock suit, then how are there still functioning animatronics during FNAF1? Are we under the assumption that someone put them back together? Also, shouldn't SOMEBODY have discovered dead phone guy in the suit, being as this previously unknown room would have been left wide open after his death? Doesn't it say in an article somewhere that the killer was caught? How is Phone Guy still around for FNAF1 if the killer was caught after the events of the murders that happened back in the 80s, at the first Freddy Fazbear's Pizza?   Also also also, what is Springtrap (the Phone Guy)'s motivation for wanting to kill you in FNAF3? I mean I guess we can assume he's just the spirit of a murderous psychopath, but one who up until now has only murdered children..."

I know, before anyone goes off on me, I hate the games, (I am not a fan of horror games and my heart is weak enough as is without the jumpscares) but I love the story behind it. The gruesome horror and redemption is something I have yet to see in a story yet. But look at what this has caused Game Theory to do, hold off on anything until we get another FNAF video. The people at GT aren't just some people we watch and learn from, they're our friends! They aren't some channel we wait for another update, we care about what happens to them, and the stories their own personal lives can tell, doing this to them is restricting them of their own channel, we shouldn't make them fear putting out a video that isn't fnaf related. So here's to you GT, make us wonder, make us think! But that's just my theory... My GT theory!"

GameTheorists,35b31t,clacas,1 point,Fri May 8 17:04:24 2015 UTC,I imagine the last phone call in FNAF 1 is the animatronics being forced to try to enter the boarded up room by the child spirits but can't because it isn't part of the robot's map of the restaurant. Then phone guy ending the call short to go and dismantle the animatronics himself.
GameTheorists,35b31t,Mr_Rosalina,0,Fri May 8 17:31:22 2015 UTC,"of course purple guy did not die at the hands of the animatronics, however the point you raise about surviving the attack of the animatronics, think of it this way, phone guy is an ordinary security guard, much like mikes position in fnaf 1, he cant leave his security office because he knows its too dangerous, so if you cannot survive the animatronics, neither can phone guy"

GameTheorists,35bepo,clacas,0,Fri May 8 21:34:36 2015 UTC,"If you look at the condition of the animatronics when the Purple Guy dismantles them, they get broken up pretty good. To me, it looks not like screws and bolts being removed but more the general animatronic being attacked and broken up (Shinning style). If that's the case then not only would it go to show why the animatronics can't be put back together but could answer as to the odd state of the animatronics in the upcoming FNAF 4."
GameTheorists,35bepo,CasaBlacka,0,Fri May 8 20:07:44 2015 UTC,"I was doing a little more research so I listened to the night 4 call again. I think we all agree that it sounds very similar to the power loss death in FNAF 1, yes? In that case, you have to have noticed that there is so little time between the jingle for power out starting and the attack sound. I guess it's just speculation but I wouldn't expect the Phone Guy to be able to do any thing in that short time, let alone escape and make it to the safe room. And we know he can't be recording the message in the safe room because otherwise the animatronics wouldn't be banging on the door, because they wouldn't know where it was to bang on it, or even that it existed."

GameTheorists,35bepo,Boredomface,-1,Fri May 8 19:46:22 2015 UTC,"Going by the state of repair of the building, we could assume that this is after the pizzeria closed down again at the end of FNAF 1. Therefore the cameras wouldn't be operational and there wouldn't be a guard to watch them even if they were."
GameTheorists,35bepo,mrcalcium99,2,Fri May 8 20:05:57 2015 UTC,"I thought FNAF 1 was to be a Bad End alternate reality where Phone guy dies without dismantling the animatronics, thus leaving the souls in the body to continue killing nightguards in the same location.  FNAF 3 however is the product of the good ending where the souls freed, but Snaptrap is the last remaining suit because he dismantled the rest."

Also, since they're not featured in the ending of FNAF 3, meaning that perhaps they haven't passed on after the vengeance of the good ending. With the photo on Scott's website being a dark purple (on purpose?) it looks like shadow Bonnie is definitely part of it. Just look at the trailer for FNAF 3.

The pounding on the door makes it sound like Phone Guy is in an enclosed space, like the security office. Also as soon as Toredor March starts playing Phone Guy sounds distressed and very soon after the call ends with Golden Freddy's kill noise so how was Phone Guy supposed to die/get caught anywhere but the security office?"
GameTheorists,3589kv,Ablico,1 point,Fri May 8 13:19:29 2015 UTC,"I think that the mini games in FNAF 3 are occurring in the time that ""Phone Guy"" is recording the phone messages. I think he ran and took apart each suit as they came for him. That's why for ""Night 5"" you hear screams, which would be him being locked in SpringTrap. So the ""Night 4"" recording is before he runs for it and ""Night 5"" is the scene that we watch in the mini game.  TL;DR Phone Guy left his recordings on while being pulverised."

GameTheorists,354tpk,DrummerBoy2999,18,Thu May 7 03:23:21 2015 UTC,"Credit for the dumbed down/less confusing version goes to /u/FlyinElk212. Originally posted in five nights sub  PHEW! OK, so after all that confusing explanation, this is MatPat's proposed timeline:   Fredbear's Family Diner Opens Phone Guy kills first child, possesses the Puppet Freddy Fazbear's Pizza 1st location opens- new animatronics Golden Freddy, Golden Bonnie, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy are introduced. Phone Guy develops killing pattern-using Golden Bonnie suit to lure children to backroom to their death. Kills 5 more victims. Two employees die due to springlock malfunctions in Golden Freddy and Golden Bonnie suits, creating the ghostly Shadow Bonnie and Shadow Freddy. Phone guy pre-records phone calls explaining how to use the springlock suits, both employee deaths incidents, and the missing children incident (FNAF 3 phonecalls). The Puppet, in an attempt to give the children new life, stuff the children's bodies into Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Golden Freddy suits (FNAF 2 cutscenes from perspective of Freddy animatronic; FNAF 2 GIVE LIFE minigame) 1st Freddy Fazbear's shuts down due to various incidents & foul odors coming off animatronics--saferoom that stores the Springtrap animatronics is permanently sealed off. Grand-reopening of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza at a brand new location. Phone guy kills 5 more victims using a Golden suit, prompting the Puppet to take action and attempt to have the Freddy animatronic to try and kill him (SAVE THEM minigame, FNAF2) Phone guy recordings of FNAF 2 (up until Night 6 call) are pre-recorded during the summertime. An investigation during the summertime occurs looking into the 5 missing children, DOES NOT SHUT DOWN new restaurant.  FNAF 2 begins--New Employee Jeremy Fitzgerald takes over night shift in November.  Phone guy MAKES PHONE CALL to Jeremy Fitzgerald (not pre-recorded!) on Night 6, explaining someone moved golden suit, that all animatronics are malfuctioning, and that there's a party they have to throw tomorrow. After Night 6, Jeremy is moved to dayshift; new employee Fritz Smith takes over nightshift. During the party, Mangle bites Jeremy Fitzgerald's frontal lobe (Bite of 87); Fritz Smith is fired, for the company believes he's the one who tampered with the animatronics (including Mangle). The Bite of 87 causes the second location to shut down. The older animatronics, which are now deemed safer than the tampered-with newer animatronics, are sent to another location in the hopes of the restaurant one day returning. Restaurant RE-OPENS AT 1ST FREDDY FAZBEAR'S PIZZA location.  Phone guy, who now works nightshifts, pre-records all messages for new employees. Shadow Bonnie and Shadow Freddy, having died at this previous restaurant, lead the now-possessed Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy to boarded-up saferoom, in an attempt to have Phone Guy dismantle them, releasing their spirits (FNAF 3 in-between night cutscenes). Phone Guy records Night 4 phone recording while running from released spirits of the children. Hides in the Golden Bonnie suit, fails to recognize the wetness of the rained-out room, and dies in the suit as the springlocks malfunction. His spirit possesses it, but no one finds Phone Guy for years due to the room being boarded up. ((FNAF 3 in-between night cutscenes). Because the Phone Guy technically is still around, the children STILL possess each animatronic in hopes to permanently finish the job. (FNAF 3 BAD ENDING) FNAF 1 begins--Mike Schmidt is hired to the nightshift and listens to Phone Guy's pre-recorded messages for instructions. Is caught in the cross-fire of possessed animatronics. Mike Schmidt is fired once it gets noticed that the animatronics are once again malfunctioning (he's blamed for it). Freddy Fazbear's once again shuts down. FNAF 3 BEGINS- Fazbear's Fright opens Phone dude finds Phone Guy's prerecorded messages for springlock suits AND Phoneguy in Golden Bonnie suit (SPRINGTRAP) The puppet returns to the exhibit to finally finish the job. The animatronics spirits are finally at peace and leave the suits once A. All hidden minigames are completed and B. Fazbear's Fright burns to the ground (due to the Puppet), presumably destroying the Springtrap suit and Phone Guy with it (FNAF3 GOOD ENDING)."
GameTheorists,354tpk,interwebcats122,3,Thu May 7 09:19:10 2015 UTC,"The purple guy destroyed the animatronics.  The scene in the back room can't come before the events of Five Nights at Freddy's then, because the animatronics are still wandering around.  It also shows the restaurant in much more decay than it was in the first game, and completely boarded up.   The phone guy very clearly is indicated to have died before Five Nights at Freddy's, but the scene with the Springtrap suit must come afterwards sometimes between FNAF and FNAF3.  The killman can't possibly be the phone guy.    Also, if the killer was caught judging by the newspaper articles, how was phone guy still out and about making recordings and getting shoved into suits?  Just can't be him."

GameTheorists,354tpk,trollmylove,2,Thu May 7 03:08:18 2015 UTC,Nothing says Phone Guy dies from that event.
GameTheorists,354tpk,Nomulite,2,Thu May 7 15:55:30 2015 UTC,Considering Mike gets killed when they enter your office it's safe to assume based on what we hear on his final phone call that he is killed. Especially considering what we hear on the night five FNAF1 call where we can hear the bots where he was.
GameTheorists,354tpk,trollmylove,1 point,Thu May 7 18:57:31 2015 UTC,"Well maybe the reason is that Mike is in a wheelchair? Think about it.   The animatronics should be incapable of forcing anyone into anything, let alone forcing a man fighting for his life into an animatronic suit. They don't even have movable fingers or hands. However, someone who probably can't run away or fight back without difficulty, for example a person whose legs don't work, would probably be an easy target.  That's another point. We can't run away. We can't even move anything but our head and our (invisible) hands. We can't move around the pizzeria at all, locked inside that room. Not because we don't want to, we literally can't.  My final not so damning point, is that who on earth would risk their life just to get a paycheck? Probably someone struggling to get a job anywhere else perhaps. I'm making an assumption that paraplegics may find it hard to get a job, so only someone desperate would not only keep the job but take the job in the first place.  TL;DR yeah I'm out of ideas."

If Phone guy is Purple Guy then how did he get from the office to the secret room? We know Freddy was right at the door and that the power was out on the night 4 tape,you could hear Freddy's jingle, and basing off the mini games map he is six rooms away. So how did he manage to get away from Freddy when he was right next to him and how did none of the other animotronics catch him during his six room dash?"
GameTheorists,354tpk,Druggeddwarf,1 point,Thu May 7 07:17:03 2015 UTC,That's assuming that the animatronics are following the same mechanics that you experience. It's not necessarily the case.

GameTheorists,354tpk,ShishouMatt,1 point,Thu May 7 09:59:49 2015 UTC,"The whole theory around the bite of 87 is so flawed. He says they're recordings, which I can believe. But that implies that Jeremy never went onto the day shift, as he was not the transferee mentioned in night 6, which in its same breath mentions the child murders.  Ergo, there is still no reason to suspect Jeremy of being the victim. Especially as he took the night shift, and the bite likely occurred during the day in plain view of children. Furthermore, as the phone guy said he would take over the night shift, we can determine in this theory that Jeremy could very well be the night guard we play as, though this leaves fritz in an odd state. Perhaps he took over due to other circumstances.  As for the two timeline theory, I don't buy it at all. I don't believe FNaF 1 came after the springtrap minigame. It seems far too convoluted to try and justify the case for Phone Guy. Lets not forget the owners and fellow employees of Freddy Fazbear also knew of the safe room, including technicians. The FNaF Pizzaria is not likely to have been run by just a nightguard and a head guard.  The parts and service room could easily imply a technician was the murderer. Not only that, but as they inspected the springtrap suit in, as theorised, the FNaF 1 location before FNaF 2, they could easily have known how to work it, and where the safe room was They were inspecting the suit between phone guy stating technicians would work on it, and the sealing of the safe rooms.  All in all, I'm really let down. Not only that, but the number of children, the method of being saved etc. Of the mini games and endings weren't even mentioned. Are the minigame and purple guy death ghosts the same? If so, where was the marionette at purple guys death, and both end screens?"
GameTheorists,354tpk,MatPatGT,1 point,Thu May 21 23:37:58 2015 UTC,So we are just going to ignore the Pink Guy who appeared in Foxy's minigame as he discovered dead children?  Or the fact he killed the first child outside the diner?
GameTheorists,354tpk,JotaGT,6,Thu May 7 03:16:53 2015 UTC,"I definitely explored the ""two killer"" theory, but here's the thing -- if color palette was truly differentiating two killers (Purple and Pink Guy), there would actually be three, as even the color of purple isn't consistent across FNAF 2 and FNAF 3.   Also, the biggest evidence against it is the trailer for FNAF 3 -- ""He will come back. He always does."" It's singular. It wouldn't make sense if there were TWO killers."
GameTheorists,354tpk,trollmylove,1 point,Thu May 7 17:56:01 2015 UTC,"MatPatGT I just created this account to actually state something everyone and their moms have been ignoring.... And that is the fact that phone guy actually leaves messages to you in FNAF 1 to help you deal with the animatronics.... If he was purple guy.... why would he leave messages for the next security guard if he was dismantling the animatronics for good not knowing the plan would backfire? Because don't tell me he recorded them while in the spring lock suit after knowing it would back fire because at that point it was pretty much impossible for him to speak normally... also he is killed only on night 4's call so .... well I think I proved my point already... Something not right here.... Still I know when you said it must have been phone guy it was because it made ""the most sense"" and not ""complete sense"" I hope I was not that late and you actually see this MatPat because addressing something like this in your next theory for FNAF 4 is crucial and if I'm here is to help in any way I can to improve the show and nothing else :) Sorry if this was to long.... and sorry if I have written something in ""bad english"" I'm actually portuguese (live in Azores, Portugal) Theorist Fist!"

GameTheorists,354tpk,saintjimmy64,2,Thu May 7 20:52:25 2015 UTC,"I like the videos, but I hate jumpscares. So I'm hoping there won't be one after part 1's horrific one at the end."

GameTheorists,354tpk,Nomulite,-1,Thu May 7 16:56:00 2015 UTC,I'm a bit disappointed about how Purple/Phone Guy dies at the end of the series.  A good horror story should always let the antagonist win.
GameTheorists,354tpk,Toastrz,2,Thu May 7 15:10:06 2015 UTC,"No, otherwise it loses the sense of finality. Which is admittedly a moot point thanks to FNAF 4"
GameTheorists,354tpk,Nomulite,1 point,Thu May 7 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"Horror should linger.  If you give the viewer (or in this case, player) a sense of closure, there isn't nearly as much substance left to give a person legitimate fear afterwards.  Imagine if the original Halloween ended in Mike Myers actually dying."
GameTheorists,354tpk,TheTjTerror,1 point,Thu May 7 18:21:10 2015 UTC,"Well to be honest, most people don't play FNAF for the horror, it's more for the story at this point. Besides, the purple guy wasn't the main antagonist, in reality the animatronics were, and still are, once again with FNAF 4 coming out. We're assuming it takes place after FNAF 3, where purple guy is dead but the suits are still roaming (if we're going by MatPat's theory that the bad ending is the true ending) so technically speaking we don't get any closure."
GameTheorists,354tpk,Nomulite,1 point,Thu May 7 18:41:44 2015 UTC,I honestly was super disappointed at the announcement of FNAF 4.

It's also why I'm looking forward to the movie, not because I know it has potential, but because I wonder what they're going to do with such a bizarre concept and how they'll adapt it to film."

If you compare the images of the good and the bad endings you see that the light cast on the floor by the golden Freddy head in the bad ending is beyond the line of the shadow (there is shadow between the light from his eyes and the light of the spotlight), meaning you wouldn't be able to see him if the light was out."

It is likely that since it hasn't got a skeleton and can't move the suit that comes and kills you is not really there, and is only showing up because the spirit of the dead child makes it come after you. In the good ending, since the spirit is at rest, the child is not longer sending out the hallucination to attack people, and so it disappeared."

I watch the letsplays of the newest game, and watch the theories, and occasionally get excited when a new teaser for the next game is released, but I never thought it would get to the scale where people are threatening MatPat on a Drake video purely because he's a bit late on a new video.  They should at least have the common decency to know that something really important has come up, even if they haven't seen the reddit post on why the delay has occurred.  This whole comment debacle is putting the fandom of FNAF in a bad light, because all people are seeing of the fandom is ""WHERE THE HELL IS MY FNAF VIDEO THAT IS MY RIGHT AS A HUMAN BEING. GIVE ME IT NOW OTHERWISE YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS?""  One thing which I would like to see is the people who wrote those comments looking back on them in about 3-6 months time, in shame in what they wrote.  If I'm going to be honest, I don't think I want a FNAF4 game theory, because I think that FNAF has been exhausted atm. I don't even really want a FNAF4, but I know that as soon as 31st Oct roles up, everyone will be asking on the comments section of 'Digressing and Side-Questing' WHERE IS FNAF4 THEORY?"""

GameTheorists,356k47,clacas,1 point,Thu May 7 15:13:05 2015 UTC,"We only heard phone guy die, and a door being banged on.  We never actually were certain that Phone Guy was in the security office when he died. The events of FNAF 1 almost immediately after Phone Guy's death, due to the FNAF 3 Bad Ending showing that, if the spirits of the dead children aren't purposely put to rest, they will return to their animatronic suits and continue to attack people wearing the security uniform (AKA the uniform that Phone Guy wore). We only assumed that he got jumped by the animatronics in the office due to not thinking that he would have had anywhere else to hide in the entire location (since we didn't know about the secret room, because secret).  See point 1. All calls were prerecorded before his death, but not all calls were pre-recorded at the same time (not even within the same game). There may still be a few missing pieces of evidence that answer more questions.  FNAF 3 was assumed to be the final chapter (since it acted as a nice bookend to a trilogy of game) right up until the FNAF 4 announcement."
GameTheorists,356k47,Diamanka,2,Thu May 7 15:28:57 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree.   I think the springtrap event happened after FNAF 1 but well before FNAF 3.   Look at the place. In the cameras in FNAF1, the place is run down but not yet boarded up. It's still in operation, otherwise why even have a security guard? The animatronics can't get out during the minigames, the exits and windows are blocked.   In the minigames, the place is boarded up and leaking. There are puddles on the floor and rats scurrying around, something you see no evidence of in FNAF 1. FNAF 1 is in better condition. Not by a whole lot, but enough to not be at the same timeframe or just after.   This does mean, of course, that if the phone guy does get jumped and killed in Night 4 of FNAF 1, that he can't be purple guy. The other thing about it is if FNAF 1 takes place after the minigames, then there is no way that the animatronics would be after Mike at all as they would already be dismantled."
GameTheorists,356k47,DJArctic,1 point,Thu May 7 22:09:18 2015 UTC,"Regarding the animatronics being dismantled, that could easily be rectified with the next day shift putting them back together. As far as condition of the building goes, I agree with you. Good eye, BTW."

GameTheorists,3551ai,ImAKAJenks,1 point,Thu May 7 06:39:31 2015 UTC,"Here is an image of the Security office in FNAF 1.  Here is an image of the Security office in FNAF 2 (Not shown is the desk, but that just has a few random pieces of paper, a drink cup, an electric fan, and a few optional secret plushies).  Notice what is visible in both images:   A single weak light on the ceiling (which is considerably out-shined by a handheld flashlight in FNAF 2, as well as the lights on switches in both 1 and 2) A few Freddy Fazbear's Pizza promotional posters and fan art (in the form of children's drawings) Random cables hanging down into view, showing that the security office is in need of repairs Large piles of TVs and monitors (which are all turned off in favor of a small handheld device used to view the cameras through, as well as electronically shine a flashlight and wind a music box in FNAF 2)   Now notice what is missing in both images:   Any visible recording device to keep electronic records of what was caught on camera Any visible notepad, logbook, journal, or even diary to let the guard on duty right down anything they find odd during their shift.   Basically, there is no way to have any non-verbal evidence of what happens here at night, as the datapad doesn't hold any video history, and simply plays a live feed from whatever cameras are functional.  This could be due to simple negligence on behalf of the owners of Fazbear's, but it also could be systematic sabotage by Phone Guy.  Either way, since we only ever knew of Phone Guy as ""someone experienced at Fazbear's who has been working here for a while and left us some training tapes"", he obviously was never scheduled for the same nights our various characters were assigned to the office (instead, if he needed to get in, he likely had his own key due to being a senior member of the security staff [likely having joined the company soon after the first Fazbear's Pizza restaurant opened its doors, to quickly start killing again]).  So, my idea is that, after the Bite of '87 happened, someone quickly determined that the animatronic had been altered the previous night in a way that caused it to bite a human, and since the Night 7 guy was the only one to officially enter the restaurant that night (with no recording software or hardware to back up his story electronically, and even if he wasn't fighting too hard against the incoming animatronic nightmare horde to write anything down, it would still technically only be his own personal testimony, which wouldn't make his case any stronger than a simple ""he said, she said"" against the schedule and the testimony of other security officers), he was held responsible."

GameTheorists,354tc2,JasonFreeYTA,1 point,Thu May 7 08:11:29 2015 UTC,"I think the night 4 tape was recorded at the location of the first pizzeria, the place that according to MatPat's theory would be fixed up and become the location of FNAF 1. It was recorded before this, when the place was still in disrepair, and shortly before the purple guy's death. In other words, the audio from night 4 isn't live, but it is recorded in a hurry because it is just prior to what we see happen in the cutscene."

It WILL come out today, come hell or highwater (probably the first time I've ever used that phrase). The problem is when you get a strike, you can no longer upload videos longer than 15 minutes, which complicates things since the final episode is 18 minutes.   When you get a copyright strike on YouTube, you get a name and an email. No indication of what infringed on the copyright or who the person really is -- it's a dangerous system if abused. Despite reaching out to the email address immediately, I have yet to receive a response. I've reached out again and hope to hear back. That said, I will figure out a way to get the video out to you this afternoon, even if it means having to just divide the episode into two more parts (ugh!).   And while I deeply appreciate all your concern and offers to help, please just leave it to positive well-wishes :) Do not harass the business or person in question as that will only make things harder as I work to resolve the issue.   But thank you for your patience. I know this is an obnoxious delay in a video you guys have been eagerly awaiting. Trust me...I'm no more thrilled about this turn of events than you are, but your support has been really comforting at a stressful time when I'm already worried about getting this video uploaded for you all!"
GameTheorists,350cv4,MatPatGT,15,Wed May 6 08:03:44 2015 UTC,Good luck getting this whole thing worked out Mat. Keep up the good work :)
GameTheorists,350cv4,Jucamia,23,Wed May 6 09:12:30 2015 UTC,"it's OK Matt just upload two 9-minute episodes back to back and have a little annoucement explaining the situation, the GT fanbase will understand"
GameTheorists,350cv4,NYX94,10,Wed May 6 08:47:29 2015 UTC,"Damn. I could understand a third party claim, but a STRIKE? Holy crap."
GameTheorists,350cv4,LenKQM,2,Wed May 6 12:14:58 2015 UTC,A strike is auto-added when a copyright claim is successfully filed against your channel.
GameTheorists,350cv4,ilivetofly,3,Wed May 6 23:20:09 2015 UTC,This is useful information for someone who just started a channel with a friend.
GameTheorists,350cv4,RevInstant,3,Wed May 6 11:37:02 2015 UTC,So are you going to do a Game Theory episode on who filed a copy write strike against you?  Edit: Just saw what the answer was :( An episode on why maybe? :P

Apparently, that image on an open source website was copyrighted, so someone from that site by the name of Roman issued the strike.

He doesn't have to explain the copyright stuff, just explain due to issues with youtube, the FNAF video is delayed, instead of us confused, and leaving his fans disappointed or disorientated.

Just SAYING something would alleviate a lot of people's tensions or confusion and mitigate the uneducated masses from swarming him for 'breaking' his promise.   Just because something isn't your job, doesn't mean you can't/shouldn't update people on a public project. Even after that Youtube does make him money, he does advertise on his videos. If money makes getting a update somehow more valid, when all an 'update' qualifies as is:  ""No FNAF today."""

Uh, I think the name of the place was...""Fredbear's Family Diner"" or something like that   Fredbear's was first, the original.   Left to rot  Spring Bonnie  Freddy Fazbear's Pizza   The springlock suits were scrapped by FNaF 2, and he talks about the previous location being left to rot. In FNaF 3 we hear about yet another Freddy Fazbear's that was only just scrapping the springlock suits, this is the previous location that was left to rot.  So:  Fredbear's (Mentioned in FNaF 2)  Freddy Fazbear's #1 (FNaF 3 Phone Guy recording)  Freddy Fazbear's #2 (FNaF 2)  Freddy Fazbear's #3 (FNaF 1)  Fazbear's Fright (FNaF 3)  http://imgur.com/q1SFdFj <-- Something like that"
GameTheorists,34tc3h,LAK132,0,Wed May 6 22:04:34 2015 UTC,"Not seeing how his recordings in FNAF 3 prove the existence of a FFP before the FNAF2 one... Why are you so sure that the recorded messages aren't referring to the diner? They could have introduced Spring Bonnie and Golden Freddy there, and then with the hinted-at incident, kept them in storage until they were locked up in the FNAF2 ""era."" The diner also could have been ""left to rot"" after this, considering there was at least more than one death associated with it (Puppet child and unknown (estimated 2) accidents with the spring suits), the place could have gone out of business eventually, until reopening in 1987 with FNAF2's FFP. The classic animatronics also could have been introduced in the diner, possibly after the spring animatronics were removed, in an attempt to bring more customers in.  So:  1970s: Fredbear's - Freddy animatronic - Spring animatronics introduction and removal - SAVEHIM minigame, Puppet possessed - Introduction of Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy animatronics - Diner left to rot   1987: FFP #1 - Week prior to Jeremy Fitzgerald's tenure - Jeremy Fitzgerald's tenure:   - Day 1: Missing Children Incident, SAVETHEM minigame   - Day 2: Give Gifts, Give Life minigame. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy become possessed  The rest is history."

Then the Regis and three birds probably start appearing early on (but not first), and last comes Ho-oh, Lugia , the three dogs, Rotom and Mewtwo (they came from the burning of a tower, a tv or a lab, so humans were at an advanced level by the time they appeared)"

GameTheorists,34e1hf,Jaw_The_Minecrafter,2,Thu Apr 30 11:46:19 2015 UTC,"Leather isn't completely useless. Not at all. Let's count your mistakes here:   comparing minecraft with real life, while using game mechanics implying dodging and mobility has no place in combat   First of all, leather's a hell of a lot cheaper than iron or steel. Also, leather armours are easiest to make from everything in your list, therefore easier to mass produce, and therefore cheaper.  Let's compare with Gambesons and Aketons. These are padded defensive jackets, made by quilting and made out of (usually) cloth and wool. There are two types: one is to be worn under mail or plate armour to cushion the body and prevent chafing, and the other is supposed to be worn by its own - and this latter type is able to stop even heavy arrows, having a design that is similar to Kevlar. Gambesons and Aketons were replaced by Buff Coats in around the 18th century, with the arrival of firearms.  Buff coats, which I assume are the IRL equivalent to Minecraft leather armour, gives some protection against swords and other edged weapons, probably while allowing you to move a lot better than if you were to wear plate or mail armour (although they were usually worn under a cuirass, which I guess you could call a half of a plate suit of armour).  I'm not suggesting that leather armour is superior to plate armour. But it does have its upsides, and there are plenty.  And before you argue again that you can't make Buff Coats with raw leather (they did undergo a tanning and oiling process), you can't just shove 8 iron bars onto a workbench to make plate armour either."
GameTheorists,34e1hf,TheCanadianAlligator,-2,Fri May 1 00:52:55 2015 UTC,"Now I have some things for you.  First of all. There is no Steel armour in vanilla Minecraft.  Second. This leather for leather armour is taken directly from a cow and sewn to get the  ""Leather Armour."" All these examples you are using are layering leather with other materials. But in reality you are using none of that just straight up leather. It's like putting on a leather jacket and expecting it to block a sword stroke."
GameTheorists,34e1hf,TheCanadianAlligator,3,Fri May 1 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"You're not paying attention at all.   The only time I've mentioned steel is when saying leather is a hell of a lot cheaper than it.  I said leather armours give some protection, while allowing you to dodge a lot better than mail or plate armour. I didn't say it would completely rebuke the force of one or two blows. Armour should do that, but its main goal is to make an attack hurt less than it would if you didn't have it on (for example, plate armour might not stop a heavy chopping blow from a bardiche (think big axe on a big pole), but it will reduce how far the bardiche's blade goes, increasing the chance that you survive. Gambesons and Aketons are made of cloth and wool. Any leather compartments on it won't protect anything - they would be belts, harnesses, etc. Gambesons are only here to prove a point - if quilted cloth and wool can provide some protection, then leather will probably provide a little more (and indeed it does). Minecraft ignores a lot of the processes of making things in general. You don't just make armour by shoving 8 iron bars, or 8 leather hides, onto a workbench. Plate Armour takes days to build, and I'm pretty sure you can do the processes of making a few buff coats out of hardened leather in the same amount of time."
GameTheorists,34e1hf,TheCanadianAlligator,-2,Fri May 1 02:07:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, but if you play minecraft, you would know there is a process to making the iron armour. you are still comparing leather to it. Iron must be dug out of the ground, Smelted, and then crafted. For Leather the process is much more simpler; raw hide (what minecraft calls 'leather') is taken and put together. implying that there is no strengthening process. You purify Iron, and you sew leather. Yes armour is intended to give protection, but we are not checking the amount of protection it gives we are comparing it to what it would be if we were to create pure leather armour of the same materials.   Where do we get this leather? FROM COWS. Their skin is what the armour is made of. And they most definitely can get hurt by swords and arrows. So if this piece of sewn together scraps of hide couldn't even protect the animal that wore it, why should it be any different on the player you use.  In addition saying that the buff coats are the IRL equivalent would be right... if you were using how the game represents it on the armour bar. But as i previously stated, we are not basing this on the strength of the armour in the game we are comparing it."
GameTheorists,34e1hf,TheCanadianAlligator,1 point,Fri May 1 03:05:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, are we commenting on 14-day old posts now?  A lot of things in Minecraft are simplified, and as a result, implied. I don't know a lot about metallurgy, but I do know that if you leave a chunk of ore in a furnace unattended, it's going to come out a mess. You need to go through a process to be able to use it. I believe Minecraft implies that you were there the whole time to do this process so it's an actual usable bar. Therefore, using that logic, Minecraft also implies you took the time to tan the rarely-dropping leather as well.  Armour is supposed to protect, yes. But in a lot of cases, it doesn't completely stop you from getting hurt. If you get hit with a weapon anywhere wearing any armour, you're going to feel it, but it's going to hurt a lot less than if you weren't wearing any armour at all, because of several things I'm going to generalize into one because I should be doing anything other than arguing with a naïve 12-year old. It's because the extra layer, the armour, was there to take some of the hit for you. You know from playing minecraft that armour doesn't completely prevent heart damage, but it does make you a heck of a lot tougher, because of damage resistance from having the armour. And even though leather armour doesn't give as much armour and resistance as the others, it still gives resistance - and the reason why is because this helps protect you is because what's hitting you now has an extra layer to go through, and gets stopped faster."

After all, Pokemon and Zelda both have several side games in their series that aren't included in their respective timelines.  So before we can create a Mario timeline at all, we have to first determine which games are canon to the Mario timeline. Until we make that distinction, we can't even begin to order them. (It also seems like you're leaving out the games in which Mario and Bowser are babies but Bowser is already ""evil"", which doesn't fit your timeline.)"

He isn't becoming evil in M&LBIS, he's unwillingly helping and waging war on another tyrant/criminal (Fawful).

GameTheorists,33ll4p,clacas,-1,Thu Apr 23 17:10:23 2015 UTC,"X was the first robot with TRUE free will. X is not relying on coding in order to make decisions. The reason why I say Protoman has a semblance of free will is that he is still designed to follow his coding. It may be that his coding is not as strict as the others, but I'm sure he still is following the 3 laws in some fashion. How do you know he has not programed anti-reprogramming measures? Like hacking a computer, reprogramming something can't just be completely blocked. For example, lets say you have the best security programs available to protect your pc from being hacked. While you are protected from a lot of hackers, the most skilled hackers can still break through. No system is impenetrable. Same with reprogramming the robots. We are talking about the two smartest scientists in the mega man world. For every counter measure Light creates, Wily can find a way around it. Does it mean that Light is not putting any effort in?

GameTheorists,33kvcr,fabczar,4,Thu Apr 23 10:10:14 2015 UTC,"Multiple Universes is a very interesting theory, in that it can't really be proven wrong by anything short of Nintendo saying it's not canon, because it's so broad.  I typed a really long answer, but it was... well, long. So short answer: Yes, if the Hero's Shade is the Hero of Time (which he is confirmed to be), then Twilight Princess Link shares a universe with Ocarina of Time Link. (In a way. It's complicated, I won't pretend that I even fully understand myself.)  All this really means is that there can be multiple incarnations of Link in one universe. Another example of this would be that Niko appears in both Wind Waker and Spirit Tracks, tying both games together into the same universe (kind of), however they feature different incarnations of Link.  So yes, they share a universe, but no, there are not any midway-between-universes shenanigans going on. There are just multiple green-clad elf-boys named Link."
GameTheorists,33kvcr,Taximadish,2,Thu Apr 23 11:35:37 2015 UTC,"So basically, you're saying that the Spirit from the Hero of Time re-incarnated as the Hero of Twilight? Or just the body appearance and another person in that body?"
GameTheorists,33kvcr,Taximadish,2,Thu Apr 23 11:40:00 2015 UTC,"Those are two possible ways of looking at it. I'm a big fan of the ""Spirit of The Hero"" theory which is this: In the Zelda Universe, there are many gods. There is also the Spirit of The Hero. When the gods think the world needs saving, they summon the Spirit of The Hero, and provide a vessel - always a green-clad elf-boy, because it's traditional and The Spirit of The Hero isn't often a fan of change. Since they're gods they can do all sorts of timey-wimey stuff to ensure the boy doesn't just appear out of thin air - they make sure he is born at the right time etc. This boy becomes the ""Link"" between the Spirit of The Hero and the world (often but not always Hyrule). The Spirit of The Hero is the one thing that's constant throughout all incarnations of ""Link"" - why they're all conveniently brave, and good with swords.  Anyway, the Spirit of The Hero does what it enjoys doing - saving the world as a green elf-boy, then goes dormant until it is summoned again.  Here's the thing. What actually is the Spirit of The Hero? It's you. The player."
GameTheorists,33kvcr,VortexxyGaming,2,Thu Apr 23 11:59:59 2015 UTC,"This sounds like something I can answer. Basically, in Hyrule Historia (kind of like the bible of Zelda lore) it is stated that Twilight Princess Link is both an incarnation of the Spirit of the Hero AND a direct descendant of the Hero of Time. It is also confirmed that the Hero's Shade is the Link from Majora's Mask (The Hero of Time sent back to relive his childhood). So, the Link from Majora's Mask did not die in Termina, but instead came back to Hyrule, had a family (or at least impregnated someone) and then later died full of regret. The Hero's Shade is NOT a Stalfos, but a ghost. He may have a skeletal face, but the rest of his body is not and instead it is translucent. Besides, if Link did die in the Lost Woods, he would have become a Skull Kid instead since he is still a child.  So, this means that there are two incarnations of Link at the same time. Since the Hero's Shade is a ghost, it is more likely he is a remnant of the Spirit of the Hero and not the soul itself.   Every time an incarnation of the hatred of Demise is arising, the Gods send the Spirit of the Hero to a vessel that will become the next Link. Hylia's reincarnation is done through the bloodline of Zelda, so a new Zelda is born around the same time as the hero. The hatred of Demise is a curse, and it follows the reincarnations of Zelda and Link, hence why we also encounter Demise in different lands."

GameTheorists,33fj9s,CouchpotatoPZ1,2,Wed Apr 22 02:41:36 2015 UTC,any thoughts on this? I personally think matpat should make an episode on this subject.
GameTheorists,33fj9s,ToritheElf,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:42:14 2015 UTC,"Actually, you aren't entirely wrong. Now bear with me as this is all the information that is taken from the Grimore cards that you are awarded throughout the game (I know right?! Who has time for that?!). Now I don't have all of them so bare with me and please remember this is just a theory.  So first I present to you this passage from the first Grimore card on the Traveler: ""Everything changed with the coming of the Traveler.  It gave us gifts that transformed the solar system and the nature of human life. It ushered in the Golden Age, a time of miracles. But it never shared its deepest secrets.  Where did the Traveler come from? Why did it offer us so much? Did it know it was being hunted across the stars? And why, when the Darkness came, did it choose to stay and fight for us?  Now the Traveler hangs, silent, above humanity's final sanctuary. It may be healing. It may be dying. It gave everything it had to save us. And now its power lies with us, its Guardians.""  Those few passages that I bolded are the ones you should pay the most attention to. Where did the Traveler come from? As far as I can tell from Alpha Lupi's journals it came from another solar system, : ""You have lived as invisibly as possible, flicking from solar system to solar system, making grand plans, overseeing the culturing of civilizations, before leaving in a blink. But you have no recollection of ever wanting worship or even thanks from those blessed by you...   ...Now, your flight is rapid, your vast mind infected with such dread and toxic doubt that you find yourself afraid of the simple act of thought.   And it is your children you must turn to now, in time of need.""  I know that is a lot to read and pretty weird considering it sounds like Alpha Lupi is talking like he/she is the Traveler. Which is why I am lead to belive that Alpha Lupi is the Traveler.   Now, let's focus on the sentence: ""You have lived as invisibly as possible, flicking from solar system to solar system, making grand plans, overseeing the culturing of civilizations, before leaving in a blink.""  From solar system to solar system. That seems like just a peice of general information until you think that all of the enemies that you encounter throughout the course of Destiny would have come from a different solar system.  Look at this passage from the Fallen Grimore card: ""The Fallen are ruthless scavengers. Brutal and uncaring, they arrived on their massive Ketches in the wake of the Collapse to loot and pillage our devastated worlds.""  Now it doesn't come right out and say that they came from another solar system but based on what we know about our solar system (The Sun and all the planets orbiting around it for those who forgot), we can easily assume that they would have come from another solar system. Now you could based on the Cabal Grimore card that they could come from our higher gravity planets such as Jupiter or Neptune as it says: ""Cabal soldiers wear pressurized armor that replicates the environment of their high-gravity homeworld."" But we know our solar system pretty well. No we haven't been on most planets but there has been snough pictures, thermal scans and many types of other scans that the tecnology of any of the enemy races would have been found way before the Dark Age.  So, back to my theory. The Traveler has been going from system to system giving differnet civilizations it's Light to help fight the Darkness which had been hunting it for eons. So as you have probably figured out were I am going with this.  The Traveler has been visiting solar systems and embedding the Light in certian civilizations and watching them, culturing them into an army to fight The Darkness. But something has always gone wrong. The Darkness, the races' own greed, or other factors that we could theorize about for days most likely. Then the Travler leaves and heads the the next, with the last civilization they left following behind them and The Darkness right behind them.  Then we come to the time we are in while playing Destiny with the Traveler weakened after years of spanning its Light over many civilizations and being attacked by the Darkness and us Guardians as the last loyal servants to the Light. I mean, this could go in circles depending on how you interpret the cards but this is my theory.   A Game Theory! Kind of. Mostly just a lore theory."

They have to be fit and exercise with all the monstes around, so any unfit/lazy/weak people die quickly, and the stronger ones who can wield huge weapons and take no fall damage are left.  Also, your part about spiders is incorrect. Spiders survive the fall by using strings, similar to and abseil. If a spider were dropped from head height it would die since it has a very weak skeleton, but makes up for this by using  its webs to slow  down the fall."

Only because species look similar doesnt mean theyre identical. As for using giant weapons, we have no idea how heavy they actually are, mainly because the game doesnt mention weight of monsters and density/weight of ores/bones. Concerning fall damage, were practically never exposed to deep falls before getting our 1st set of armour, if i recall correctly. So we can assume the armour can take most of the impact."

GameTheorists,338vku,LokiAlpha,3,Tue Apr 21 04:00:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree with OP that this could also be a theory.  Even if it's for entertainment purposes, is there any proof that shuts down the theory that the animatronics aren't just like was seen in the comedic video?  Doesn't matter what purpose the video is for, the point is that it brings another theorized possibility into the mix.  You can't be for sure what the animatronics are thinking, nor can you have the perception of said animatronics, so to outright say that this can't be a theory is a fallacy.   Quick Edit: Just wanted to make sure that you're not misunderstanding me.  Yes, it's not a theory in the sense that HotDiggedyDemon probably wasn't trying to suggest that this is 100% the lore behind Five Nights at Freddy's, but it's a plausible theory.  Remember what a theory is before you deny it's plausibility based on what kind of work proposes the theory."

Right up until the four giants physically put a hard stop on everything happening because of the moon falling by catching it.  If this theory held water, when the Giants stopped the moon, it would just keep making life hell for everyone everywhere. Things would not stop cold.   The moon may be dense enough to not be torn apart, in fact,  it has to be. But, it cannot be a black hole or dense enough that it causes tidal forces upwards. That plainly doesn't happen in the game.   What you see are hurricane force winds caused by the air displaced by something the size of the fucking moon falling and whipping up the rocks on the air.  So, that's basically it for this one. It's really cool! I like it. But it's ruined by things that happen 5 seconds after the cut scene we just based all of our science on."

However, the sabotage program was to strong for the original program to ever finish the cycle.   However, another explanation is that the numbers that were being broadcast to his mind did not carry out the execute command, so it would wait to execute that command until 10-22-63. (The final numbers that flash after the credits and before the picture of Mason at the parade in Texas is shown is 10-22-63)"

It's very infrequent that men are portrayed as sexually as women are, just look at ads for clothes for instance."
GameTheorists,32l12m,andrewisgood,4,Tue Apr 14 23:33:59 2015 UTC,"If you take just nudity into account, then yes. However, men get sexualized a bit differently in ads, since a ripped body isn't enough to pull in female eyes. Women are more complicated since psychology plays a big role in their sexuality. Financial success and security are attractive to women, so men in expensive suits wearing a Rolex are frequently in ads. Most women are submissive, so having a man in a dominant position or situation is also attractive. I've also heard beards that are short, but a bit beyond stubble is also attractive. Not all men are as financially successful as men in ads, are able to grow a full enough beard like in ads, nor are able to always be in dominant situation, like a management position at work for example. Also taking the success of 50 Shades of Gray into account, you have a man that's financially successful. He's also quite dominant and adventurous sexually, creating a sense of curiosity about him. At the end of the story the man gets essentially gets tamed and is ready to settle down and start a family. The scenario was apparently popular enough despite bad writing and having what seems to be an equally bad movie.     Note: I haven't read the book or watched the movie, but have read psychology articles that go over what generally happens in the story and what makes it popular."

GameTheorists,32l12m,PaintRae,2,Wed Apr 15 14:21:59 2015 UTC,"Most sex psychology articles, some written by female psychologists, say that most women are sexually submissive. If I remember correctly, it was Psychology Today or some other similar periodical. I've read the online articles, not the dead tree magazine ones. The articles may not have the credibility of a scholarly peer reviewed journal, but I've not seen any peer reviewed studies or journals that have debunked that most women are submissive. On the flip side, in psychology, most men are found to be dominant. In mass media it's a bit rare to see sexually dominant women, as well in mainstream and pop culture in general.  Edit: To expand a bit on the last sentence, it would seem mainstream and pop culture would be indicative (to a degree) of the state of the majority of society."
GameTheorists,32l12m,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,3,Wed Apr 15 15:52:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  I've taken a few psych courses, but none of them had brought up the women are submissive and men dominant thing before.  And I absolutely agree that women are submissive in the media, I just wonder if maybe it's a cause and effect thing from that direction.  You know, society affects the media, but media also affects society."
GameTheorists,32l12m,PaintRae,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:10:32 2015 UTC,"I think either most or lower level psych courses cover abnormal psychology, or how to change or manipulate it. That's what I got at least from a 100 level psych course. What's also interesting is when I browse science related subreddits I tend to see ""X Study confirms with absolute certainty about Y thing that we knew about for years"" or at least someone in the comments fusses about how we've known about Y for a long time. Research takes a long time to collect data and verify that no cognitive biases or fallacies occurred during a study. As far as the field of psychology is concerned, even though some concepts are technically conjecture, they can work just fine for treatment and therapy since humans can use intuitive knowledge pretty well when helping other humans. So as far as the dominant male/submissive female dichotomy, it may need more research to make it textbook worthy. There was very basic coverage of sex psychology in the course I took, and it briefly touched on what psychology knows about gay people (we still don't know why people are gay apparently). It also did not cover the whole submissive/dominant thing. Another thing I've read in the sex psych articles is that it's tricky to fund sex research when illness, disease, etc. take a higher priority for funding. Also big pharma is more keen on researching more common illnesses to treat since it helps cover R&D expenses for successful and the much more often unsuccessful research.    Society and media definitely feed back into each other, but I think society pushes media more so. Or at least society is pushing back more right now since the media isn't providing what society wants. Right now cable companies are floundering with adapting to internet streaming. However, HBO is finally taking the plunge and making it accessible to people with internet access (although this is initially just Apple TV users). Part of it is for HBO's survival, but also since Game of Thrones is the most pirated TV show it would seem to be an indicator that it's more convenient to many people to pirate it rather than pay for cable, have a bunch of channels they don't watch, and manage a DVR. HBO seems to also know what viewers want to see and are pushing the envelope of what types of media they show. John Oliver is covering political topics in depth that tend to be glossed over, either because it's assumed the layperson wouldn't understand it or because they fear Corporate America would sue them. John Oliver's coverage of the tobacco industry would be a good example among Net Neutrality and government surveillance. I really like the amount of research that gets put into each episode, along with him making it easy for the layperson to understand. HBO recently made a documentary called ""Going Clear"" which covers Scientology. I don't think other networks would have covered it because of political reasons, but HBO believes this is something it's viewers would want to see."

GameTheorists,32l12m,Mhoku,2,Tue Apr 14 23:35:44 2015 UTC,"Arguably that would be a streamer and viewer issue, not a game issue, but of course twitch will have a hard time controlling those."

GameTheorists,32l12m,da_nee,0,Tue Apr 14 18:11:52 2015 UTC,"In regards to breasts in general, I feel the censorship of existence is stupid, but treating it as a taboo isn't.  I mean, for starters, sexuality used to be something seen as sacred in a marriage, and breastfeeding would fall in the shadow of that, as if it is equally sacred. Gone are those days for the most part, but the mentality remains in some part.   With the entertainment industry, we can show and do things we couldn't normally in real life, which is why violence is so unconsciously accepted. We can't be a notorious criminal like in GTA in life without consequence, but we can have sex. Again, that sacred mentality translates over. Violence is also part of human evolution in regards to hunting, but sex is usually a private affair as well as boobs because of the value they hold.  Censoring either sexuality or violence is wrong, but I feel there is reason behind it. Good or bad, I don't know, but reason still."
GameTheorists,32l12m,DarkDimentio,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:37:08 2015 UTC,"Also, when considering the very nature of video games, destruction and violence are extremely common means of progression within games, where as anything sexual gets about as close to a mechanic as a mini-game.  Violence is indispensable for a wide variety of genres (When was the last time you played an RPG that didn't involve fighting something?).  Sex is largely unnecessary and often seen as a ploy to entice young males (at least in America).  Overall, we are more accepting of violence in games, as it plays a significant role that many of us can't imagine not being there, while sexually explicitness does not."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,shaboozeybot,24,Tue Apr 14 19:28:26 2015 UTC,"I must say, as someone who has put a couple hundred hours into both games, I'm really disappointed in this one, there were literally just 2 valid arguments for LoL and a buttload for DOTA2. the only arguments that were used for LoL was that it's simpler and DOTA has bland names for their heroes (which IMO isn't a bad thing, but that's not my point).  Also there is no discussion either they are both just tossing out arguments without anyone countering an argument (apart from maybe once or twise throughout the video).   This series seemed like a good idea to begin with, but the way it is executed doesn't allow for any proper discussion."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,Dernom,11,Tue Apr 14 20:48:27 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that while sohinki actually plays a lot of DOTA 2, matpat most likely plays much less LOL. So it's much harder for him to get good arguments for his side."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,xFXx,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:11:44 2015 UTC,"The names for the heroes in dota was chosen because that what that the hero was called in war 3 dota heroes like lich actually have a name, he is for example called Ethreain and warlock is called Demnok Lannik, but nobody used the nemes in war 3 dota they always just ccalled him warlock where other heroes like meepo the geomancer was called Meepo and not geomancer so they chose to call him Meepo. So even that argument is a bit unvalid."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,ValErk,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:55:43 2015 UTC,"There's also the fact that people just call Lich, Lich. In DoTA 2, his name is still Ethereain, but Lich is easier to say and remember."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,ZephyAlurus,-1,Fri Apr 17 00:05:39 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, what other arguments can be made for LoL? Aside from LoL is better for people who don't have decent computers, I'm not too sure what else could've been said.  I play a lot of DoTA 2 and probably a few hours of LoL and wonder what else is there besides it's more simple and has a bit more variety."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,ZephyAlurus,11,Tue Apr 14 21:39:14 2015 UTC,"The arguments at the end come down to personal preference. I always compare Dota and League to paintball.  DOTA is equivalent to woodsball. Slower, more thought-out, strategy, terrain, tactics take a much larger role. Fights are dictated by more than just your ability to shoot.  League is equivalent to speedball. Lightning fast, faster moving, simpler in terms of variables to keep in mind, and mechanical ability and knowledge of your role within the team have far greater emphasis over tactics, although tactics are still required in order to avoid getting facestomped.  What I'm trying to say is that League encourages a much more ""twitchy"" style of gameplay. Equal turn rates, streamlined laning phase (no denial for example) and weaker (by comparison) turrets allows for flashier, more dangerous plays. League rewards you for developing excellent mechanical skill, and at least a sound grasp of tactics. When to engage, when not to.  Dota, on the other hand, is by far the more ""intricate"" game. (This coming from an avid league player). Your champions do not all fit the QWER four ability template, you have many more active items available to you, your items have greater variety, and can be interlaced far more, and you have many more variables to keep in mind (such as turn rates, and the creep denial). DOTA plays a little slower in comparison to league. Fights are won and lost not so much on mechanical ability, but on superior team strategy and tactical thinking. This isn't to say that DOTA doesn't require mechanical skill, or is incapable of flashy plays, only that the emphasis is far less on it."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,Spear99,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:58:22 2015 UTC,"I think you got it down pretty well, except maybe for calling Heroes Champions. OP was saying how there more arguments to be made for LoL and I was wondering what aside from preference."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,ZephyAlurus,2,Wed Apr 15 08:18:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm.... I'm trying to rack my brain for some more arguments, but I'm having trouble finding really well thought out ones.  You could argue that rune pages, and a champion market provide another layer of intricacy to the game by allowing players to specialize in certain roles and champions. However I know many people dislike runes and unlocking champions, which is completely understandable.  There is some statistics that would suggest that league has a less toxic community, but that's also subjective and subject to interpretation.  Honestly that's all I can come up with. Both games are excellent, and pander to different tastes and play styles so I don't really see how an actual argument can be made to uphold one over the other."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,Spear99,-2,Wed Apr 15 18:25:21 2015 UTC,"The argument that runes and masteries give an unfair advantage is pretty much just wrong. Anyone who played enough LoL will know, that Runes and masteries are a way to specify ones playstyle and they add a new layer of strategical deepness into the game."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,TheRealM_,4,Tue Apr 14 22:22:49 2015 UTC,"If i just got to lvl 30 and have no runes fighting someone who has a full set of runes, then they have an unfair advantage over me."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,ZephyAlurus,-3,Tue Apr 14 22:33:23 2015 UTC,"Leveling an Account to Level 30 takes a long time. By the time you get there you should have racked up some runes. And no, the advantage is not unfair, they have just spent their IP more wise. Knowing which runes to buy and when is also a part of game knowledge and defines a player strength.   That's almost like you would complain that the enemy has an unfair advantage over you because he used his 3000 gold to buy a Damage Item while you used it to buy some boots and a few elixirs."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,TheRealM_,4,Tue Apr 14 22:40:49 2015 UTC,"That would be fine if all the IP was going into runes. However if you decide to buy a champion that you wanted to play. Now you don't have as much IP as someone who spends all their IP on runes. In addition, you won't always be matched with people with similar IP levels as you. So even if you have a bunch of IP from getting to level 30, the other player may have more options or just more minor advantages than you."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,ZephyAlurus,6,Tue Apr 14 22:55:45 2015 UTC,"i have played over 300 games of lol and can confirm runes and masteries give HUGE advantages. Ofc at the top level everyone has it all unlocked, but this completely screws over LoL apparent target demographic, the more ""casual"" players. For an example, i often find myself hindered from playing a role well due to not owning enough rune pages to cover every role, and also grinding for top level runes of all types takes WAAAAY to long. It is very unfair"
GameTheorists,32ljiu,Flamingtomato,3,Tue Apr 14 22:27:51 2015 UTC,"Grinding Runes and Rune Pages is annoying, yeah I agree.   But once you actually have them, they definetely enhance the game experience. I'm not really a casual player myself, so I can't speak for them, but I don't feel like Runes hinder you from playing a specific role well (except Jungle, Jungle is all about the Runes). When I played on a new smurf account I could fill most roles even without a proper rune setup.  Oh and to masteries: Masteries give beneficial effects yeah, but a Level 2 player will not be matched with a full equipped Level 30 player, that's not how matchmaking works."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,TheRealM_,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:35:37 2015 UTC,"I can confirm this point a bit... IF we're talking about full rune page to empty ones. My friends introduced me to LOL when their level was 20ish. So I sometimes ran into high level opponent with full rune page (they told me not to wast IP on low level rune, so it was empty), and I can tell you that those flat AP & magic pen runes hurt... (My friends often checked who I was going up against including what rune & masteries they had)  .  Yes, I was a newbie & I'm pretty sure that affected it too, but I remember having much easier time after having a rune page (Yay for saving up IP, I'm pretty sure I was only 1 magic pen quint short... and so much dmg o_O).  .  But my case is somewhat rare & if both player have full rune pages, difference isn't that great I feel."

GameTheorists,32ljiu,demented737,3,Wed Apr 15 01:47:03 2015 UTC,The funny thing is that i play both games. And in lol you get enough Ip (The free currency) to buy the champ you like the most in the role you like the most. Then you play him and nothing else. People do try out the free rotation but you often see teams without a single free rotation champ even if you are new player in the lower ranks

Only a few valid argument and it became obvious that Mat don't play much MOBA when he said that LoL has more variation in roles and stuff which I think is so far from the truth. In LoL yoy have top/tank, jungler, mid, adc and support and almost every game is the same where everyone goes to the same lane as usual where in DotA there are so many ways to lane. You don't need a jungler if you want. You can duo lane in mid or tri lane top if you want. Now that's variation"

GameTheorists,32ljiu,Zlothinator,3,Fri Apr 17 12:38:59 2015 UTC,"As much as this video had somewhat subjective opinions thrown at each other, therefore(or not) not much of a discussion like Dermon said... (I was never good at English, so if that statement is wrong... go blame him, not me... hueh heh hehe >:-D)   .  I did find the champion limit thing interesting, and I agree with it. When I jumped into DOTA, I was kinda overwhelmed by the champion select... didn't even have time to skim over all the character before I had to choose. It's almost like EVE (I know this is the extreme but I can't think of a popular game with steep learning curve from top of my head) in terms of learning curve, or it looked that way. So I don't really think 10 free rotation & buy champion is really that negative... I'll come clean, that lecture sit part really convinced me... :P  .  To support that further, DOTA has Steam/Valve on it's back while LOL is stand alone and it has to make money. If it feels like too much grind all it takes to fix it is raise the ip earn rate on higher level if it already isn't (although I highly doubt it's gonna get raised if it isn't in place already).  .  I don't know why they didn't talk about the UI. One thing in (my short experience in) DOTA that I loved is that your friend list, team chat & your current party is always on right half of the screen, if that doesn't shout ""I'M A TEAM GAME"" than I don't know what will.  .  On the MOBA thing, I was pretty certain that term started with Riot since they didn't want to be called ""DOTA like"", and it's a good call, why would you want to be named after your competitor? Following argument wasn't that strong either I think. Like TheRealM_ stated, 5v5 Summoner's Rift is the most popular one, my friends who wants to make a ranked team only played in 3v3 map when there was only 3 of them. Even more, Oceania server don't have Dominion because it was either not popular enough or that Riot felt that it would drive people away from Summoner's Rift (ref. introducing map packs in FPS).  .  Lastly the whole DOTA was first thing. I'm pretty sure it was Warcraft game mode(?) and not Starcraft? Yes there's the same one in Starcraft... back to DOTA firsty thing. Yes, I guess it give them the ""original"" title, but I'm finding it hard how that relates to LOL vs. DOTA, Which Game is Better... https://youtu.be/w_skCXC9oVA?t=7m49s  .  I'd like to say they should go deeper rather than just skimming... but I think skimming over some of those point is giving a nice ground for more in-depth comment / discussion. At least in this thread, I don't want to check YouTube comment, leagueoflegends or dotamasterrace reddit... pretty sure it's mostly hate parade there... tell me if it isn't though, maybe I'm wrong and there's couple of good point there too."

GameTheorists,32ljiu,kimera-houjuu,6,Wed Apr 15 14:21:36 2015 UTC,"I don't really get the point of those DeadLock videos. The outcome will always be up to the personal opinion of the viewer because of it's design, and just provide some [troll]objective[/troll] arguments, while giving each argument highly debateable value in form of damage done.  I'll just go over this DeadLock quickly:   Why the fuck is it relevant which game launched the genre when debating about which game is better? That's like saying that the Microversion is the best handheld game console because it was the first. It's definitely not a valid argument in this discussion. The balance issue isn't really objective, since while the champions naturally aren't perfectly balanced, the teams have equal chances of winning, not taking indicidual player skill (including team play skill) into concideration. Although I personally agree here that LoL's champion balance is awful. Being able to buy stat buffs outside of the game is a design choice and neither better nor worse. Also, LoL features comparable stat buffs that can be eqipped outside of the game. Any argument about the number of items and champions/heroes/gods fail to concider the quality vs. quantity aspect. More is not always merrier. Plain stat upgrades being lame is quite subjective, as is with items having a big variety of different effects being superior. I personally disagree with Sohinki here. Disacounting the LoL rune ant mastery system after taking DotA's as a big uppoint for it is VERY hypocritical and thus should never be proposed as being a valid argument. Such things really upset me. On the same point, failing to account that LoL items have (active) abilities as well is just bad. Denial is, again, a design choice and up to personal opinion. I don't like it at all, not only as a game mechanic but also as a ""backstab your team"" mechanic. The jungle is yet another design choice, so no comment. While map variety is a valid argument for LoL, but it definitley doesn't make LoL a game of choice and variety. Also, as far as I remember, players can NOT start with whatever they perfer because other than the 5v5 map, the others are locked until a certain level is reached. Custom game settings are clearly superior in DotA since they offer more options. Finally a valid argument. Champion designs and names are subjective, not a valid argument. Though I prefer LoL here. DotA respecting it's lore in contrast to LoL disrespecting it's lore, while being only slightly subjective, can be a very big point. LoL changing their entire lore after a few seasons was one of the biggest letdowns in gaming for me. On the other hand, one could say that they did it to improve the lore, but that's only a shallow excuse, while of course subject to personal opinion. All in all, this is a clear argument in favour of DotA. Visual variety as well as how detailed the graphics are is a subjective point. While LoL is friendlier on the ressources, DotA has better quality here. It's mostly a design choice with neither being ultimately superior to the other. This includes particle effects and similar. Comparing MOBAs to Brawl fails because in Brawl, every character's strength depends on itself, while in MOBAs the team composition is just as important. Brawl actually allows tier-based games and thus doesn't require perfect balance, but in MOBAs thats not possible and lack in balance has to be taken more serious. Gimmicks that are weak because of it are of course exempt from this argument, while they could be worked into a balanced state as well. Being able to choose all characters within a reasonable amount of effort is a must for any competitive game, being the case in LoL and obviously being the case in DotA. I'd actually expect it in any non-free game, and while I prefer it in free games as well, I give them the benefit for being, well, free. Then again, LoL's approach has it's benefits as well, making this point subjective. While Matpat says it forces you to play the whole roster, it has the opposite effect on me. Valueing the practice mode because you don't have to face BM in it doesn't bring a good light on the game, right, Matpat? Unranked play should be sufficient as a valid ""practice"" mode. Lower death panelties are a clear point for LoL. The design choice of getting bonusses for good play is naturally superior to penalizing bad play. That is actually objective as of game design, while being subjective in whether you prefer deaths to have consequences as a more-than-gameplay principle. However, differences in gameplay are more important to a game, and thus LoL get's this point. Giving new players an easier time to get comfortably into the game isn't actually important when going for a balanced and fair game, or let me rather call it a balanced and fair sport. However, as a game it is a problem if you don't provide an easy entrance into the game. Again, LoL scores. Viewership numbers can be used as an indicator for how good a game is. It doesn't influence it, however, and thus is out of place in this discussion. Price pools get the same argument as viewership numbers, while being even less of an indicator. DotA providing the ""richest, most complex, most rewarding MOBA experience"" is highly subjective and can't be treated in any way as an actual argument.   After all, I can only find 4 arguements in this ""discussion"" that aren't just plain statements. Statements that aren't backed up by arguments or arguments that are irrelevant in the context of the discussion have no place in proper discussions. If this problem could get improved on in further DeadLocks, I could see it becoming are really good show, but as it is it's neither interesting nor does it provide any good to the viewer as well as your channel."

GameTheorists,32ljiu,TheDomo12,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:41:58 2015 UTC,"Scattershot.  Arguments are structured around a main idea that is reinforced by several contentions, which must tie back into that original idea. You emphasize the clash! That's rule number one.  That is not here.   What is MatPat saying about LoL? It's better for the casual player. He backs that up by saying that it has more to do, more character, and a simplistic pick up and play gameplay that appeals to the most people. Which is why it has more people playing it. Whereas Sohinki argued that Dota had more depth. It has a harsh learning curve, but Dota gives you the tools you need to break through the wall. The high level play is more challenging, but with that comes more satisfaction. We don't see the debate framed in that way. Everyone hides the main point, which doesn't work. It becomes a flurry of punches back and forth, taking irrelevant shots that don't matter.  It has too many of these ""Phoenix Wright"" style moments, where someone interrupts the other's cocky swagger to land a hit squarely across the jaw. If you're going to do that, you need to do a few things. We have to understand the heart of each argument so that the blows hit harder, that we know when a critical blow has been dealt. The numbers seem to be assigned more or less at random. That's not a positive.  What it needs is a better flow, too. It takes the same time to make the points, but some are arbitrarily designed with more value than others, for seemingly no reason. Slow build up, elaborate points, and then a flurry of blows, followed by regrouping, and then rebuttal. Then you make your final point. It would help if there was more variety in both the time the points take to make and the amount of points someone is allowed to be behind.  We don't have a moment where Matpat is getting beat down, REALLY beat down, then, with a sly smile, he unveils an argument or exploits a hole in his opponent's argument when they get too mouthy or self-confident, and it's on. Why don't we have that moment? No one feels like someone is winning or losing. They're all on equal footing all of the time. That's not exciting! There's no tension, no room for these moments of, ""How is he going to come back from that?!"" We don't know! There's no sense of helplessness when we don't know what his point is to prove other than on the most basic level.  What Deadlock needs to have is these three things:   Whatever perspective someone approaches the proposition from, we need to know their angle.  It needs to have a flow where the pacing and the points are more free to vary. Fluff arguments need to be cut or placed in the proper moments."

I'll try to stay constructive and write down what bothered me (Please note though, that I am not really too experienced with DotA, so I might not be able to comment as much on them).   Starting at 1:25, Sohinki states that DotA is more balanced, fairer because League gives an individual player advantage of others through Runes and Masteries. First off: Which game is more balanced is objective subjective. There are so many deeper levels behind the word ""balance"" you can't just say that one is more balanced. Also, one need to understand why LoL has Masteries/Runes and a Currency system as a whole (IP/RP that you can spend on to unlock new things). The whole reason is because League started off as a Free to Play game (it still is) and uses the F2P - Business Model. So what does that mean? That means that in League, you will receive IP for playing a game, with which you can unlock new champions and runes. This gives the whole game basically a feel of progression. You level your account and feel like you become stronger. Also the advantage of Runes is really just minor. There are different tiers of runes, and if you are not yet Level 10/20 you can only buy the weaker runes with less stats. Also, you can buy Runes ONLY with IP. So you can't actually just spend money on the game, get RP and then buy a ton of runes to have an advantage ingame. What also should be noted is, there are only a certain amount of Runes one can equip. When a Player reaches Profile Level 30, he has unlocked every Rune Slot and every Mastery Point, and only THEN he is able to play Ranking Games. So when you reach Level 30 you kinda max out and then nobody has an advantage with runes, cause everybody can use the same amount of runes and the same type of runes. And from that point on, Runes serve as a specification for YOUR OWN Playstyle, and further enhance the deepness of strategy. Playing an aggressive champion and want to go all in? Use offensive runes! Want to play rather passive and wait until later in the game so you are stronger? Take defensive/utility runes! And Masteries serve the same purpose. You get 1 point per level, and the matchmaking matches you with people about your level. So you should clearly see, masteries and runes are not a way to introduce a pay 2 win system to frustrate players, they are much rather a way to give players the freedom to customize and to play their own playstyle.  Short Note about RP: Riot Points are premium currency for real money. What do they do? Well, you can buy skins for your champion. An alternative look. Nothing that actually effects the ingame stats. The other thing you can do is get and exp boost or IP boost. The effect of these boosts are also not noticable in the actual game. People who pay for boosts just unlock new champs/runes faster than other (But at Level 30, this doesn't mean anything anymore). At 2:00 Sohinki criticizes that Stat upgrade items are lame. Well, that's just a objective subjective opinion. Items with simple stats upgrades are easier to understand for newer people. Hard to discuss an objective subjective opinion. General things like these just don't belong into an actual discussion in my opinion... (But maybe that's just me, cause I am reaaaally close with LoL). At 3:30. ""It's the same 3 lanes. Same Jungle. Same 5 on 5 action every single time."" Well, everyone who has played LoL for a little whie, must have noticed, that by far the most popular Map is the 5on5 Map Summoners Rift. By saying that the same map every time gets boring and justifying by bringing the Dominion Map on the table, you insult at least 85% of the LoL Playerbase. There may be tiny little communities that keep the other game modes alive yeah, but compared to the whole game, it's a really tiny fraction. I have spent 1.301 hours (that is 54 days) in LoL, and the most part of this time on the classic 5on5 map. Every single game is unique, a new and fresh experience and I can only assume, everyone who has played DotA long enough feels the same way about DotA. The ""choice"" you are talking about with the different maps is so insignificant little. The Dominion Mode for instance is overran by botting accounts, that are just trying to level up, so the owners can sell a fresh level 30 account on the black market. At about 9:27 ""I shouldn't have to buy champions"" Okay, once again, buying the champions gives the player a sense of progression. By playing more, you receive more IP, so you can buy more champions which make your roster and your options higher. If you like or dislike that is preference, however you also need to consider that Riot Games are doing all this stuff for free, so they need some way of getting profit through their game to sustain themselves (and to sustain the whole Pro Scene which is sponsored by Riot btw). And they do this by giving content faster to players who pay or by putting out content that is only buyable with RP that is so cool that one wants to have it, WITHOUT actually giving a paying Player an unfair advantage! No matter how much you pay for the game, at the end of the day, it's still skill and teamwork what decides who destroys the enemy nexus. At the end, you were giving the Point to Sohinki that for competitive Play DotA would be better, and LoL is for average Players. I really have to strongly disagree here. League of Legends has an active Pro Scene in the form of the ""LCS"" (League Championship). The LCS is a format sponsored by Riot, where the best teams of each Region play against each other every week in a split. This format makes it easier for the viewers, cause there is a fixed regular schedule when which teams will play and it also makes being a pro player an actual job now, since the players get salaries and are under contract for one split. The Pros even live together in Gaming Houses so they can scrim together and discuss strategies or team problems as a group. As far as I know (please do correct me if I'm wrong here) in DotA there is no such format. The Pro Scene is basically just a big mess of tournaments that are being held irregular and all over the world and being a DotA - Pro Player doesn't seem too safe as a job.   Sooo... I definetely appreciate all the work you put in that video, but I really think that in the end of the day, it just comes down to preference which game is better.  And I think there were too many inaccuracies in the discussion, to really come to a good conclusion here. I fear that the video will just light the whole ""LOL VS DOTA"" Circlejerk on fire again. Don't take me wrong Mat, I love your videos, and I like that you attempt something new with that show, but I think the ""LoL < = > DotA"" argument must be handled really sensitively and I felt that in this case that wasn't given.  But hey, that's just my 2 cents, maybe other people will have a different opinion!  And maybe, I just spent too much time on the good ol' Rift and got too emotionally attached to LoL so that my expectations of this video were too high for you to fulfill.  Also, since I am not too familiar with DotA (tried it once but really didn't like it too much) I would really appreciate if someone with good DotA knowledge would share his opinion on this topic!  Thank's for reading everything!"
GameTheorists,32ljiu,TheRealM_,3,Fri Apr 24 04:25:08 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Sorry if this comes across as cirklejerky, simply trying to show the other side of the dicussion :D  Excellent reply, but as avid player of both games i have a few thing i want to bring up. First your use of ""objective"" is wrong, in fact i think you mean ""subjective"", as in is based on opinion and taste and not facts. Second, your point about LoL being f2p and thus having runes and masteris and buying heroes is dumb, since DotA is also completely f2p, but gives you EVERYTHING. Now about masteries, i get your point. At level 30 everyone is equal, and it does allow you to customize your playstyle (although DotA does this more through items in game, which in my subjective opinion is way cooler). But runes are just plain unfair. First problem is even after 30 it takes ages to buy max level of all runes. Second, the limited rune pages really limits your ability to customize. More rune pages = more flexibility = more power. Unfair imo. Also why you wouldn't want everything unlocked escapes me. Having every hero allows for lots more fun modes (single draft is like the most fun thing ever), lots more flexibility and much deeper strategy.  And about the pro scene, i will say what i always say. IT is by no means easier to be a LoL pro than a DotA one. In fact being the top LoL player is alot harder, since you have to the best of 30 million instead of 5 million. But DotAs skill ceiling is ALOT higher. Basically in DotA noone is even close to perfect play. There are so many insane possibilities, which imo makes it super exciting to watch. In LoL, everyone is nearing perfection, since the game is simpler. Once again, i think DotA is a better esport because it's   -More viual. Every spell is very clear and obvious, and much fewer spells are cast during teamfights, with every one being more important. This makes understanding what is happening easier.   -More dynamic and crazy. Every game is much more different. With such a varied pool of heroes and strategies you never know what to expect. The basic progression of a LoL match remains the same though. As an example, in DotA, teams sometimes go for crazy srats like taking roshan (eq. to the baron) at level 1, and hoping not to get spotted. These kinds of anomalies happen all throughout the game and really break up the monotony and makes it super exciting.   -Better support from the devs. Basically the internationals are awesome. Valve really make it a super cool event. If you get teh ticket, you can do crazy things like reenact momnetes of matches iwth your friends to see how you would do, palce guesses and get rewards, collect player trading cards, create fantasy team leageus, and vote on special matches.   Now LoL is a great game, otherwise i wouldn't have put 300-500 hours into it. But after getting into DotA i will never go back, since it provides such a much deeper and richer experience imo."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,Flamingtomato,2,Tue Apr 14 22:17:55 2015 UTC,"I think you mixed the word ""objective"" and ""subjective"". Objective means one is true and one is false. Subjective means that it varies depending on the person/situation.  It doesn't matter how minor the advantage is for runes. It's still an advantage. Sure you can argue if you get to the late game, there's no advantage, but when you just hit 30? you're not gonna be able to keep up because you're playing against people who have full rune pages.  Sure rune pages give you more options, but it also restricts you too. If you only have one completed rune page, you're forced to play one style until you can get another full one or you'll have to play at an unfair disadvantage.  I don't think Sohinki is trying to say stats items are lame, but just really bland. In DoTA, items give a lot of change in gameplay.  Valve is making the game free too, but gives all the heroes for free. I don't saying that they have to make money is a great way to say it, but rather that's how they made their business plan. They didn't have to make it like this, but they chose to.  DoTA's competitive scene is more high risk, high reward. Kinda like DoTA. I don't watch competitive DoTA much, but they normally have tournaments that you watch and then there's not too much to watch after it's over."

This is a feature from 2003. What the fuck. LoL uses adobe air bullshit at its client. The game is pay 2 win. If you only have champions that are bad this meta, you lose easier. Either you could buy a champion, or you could grind every hero, which can take 2 years In dota, there is often a question in games if a hero is going to be a carry or a support (wraith king), or an offlaner or a roamer or a mid or a support (mirana). This really puts it in a perspective how versatile the game can be. Meanwhile in LoL, I've heard that you can get banned by picking heroes in unorthodox roles. There is custom games in dota, made by fans. Somebody is already making LoL and warcraft 3 as custom games in dota. Dota has more of an expansive cosmetic system. You can mix and match several parts to your liking. Most sets costs $5-7, and it is the community that makes them (some has a full-time job making these cosmetics). In LoL, you can just buy skins, that you can not mix and match, some are lore-breaking, and they cost more. You have a chance of getting item drops in dota, as well. The developers says features such as denying is toxic, because it gives the opponent an advantage. Basically, the developers are retarded. https://imgur.com/a/LtPq510. there is voice chat in dota"
GameTheorists,32ljiu,Weeklyn00b,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:52:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Mat Pat reads these comments, but if he does I want to let him know With all due respect:  Man, stop doing these DeadLock videos (It's the 2nd one I've seen of you), I love your game theory videos, you take the time and dedication to point out some interesting facts just as some quirky trivia. I won't deny you look like a smartass over there as you do your homework well and present it in a neat manner. And of course, the most important part is: your show is entertaining and enjoyable.  But on debates you seriously make a fool of yourself, you come with half-assed arguments, you look like those kind of people who are like ""I YELL LOUDER SO I HAVE A POINT"" (Even when you're not yelling, but the HP bar declining so much over insignificant issues makes it look that way).  As a person who played 3 years of LoL since Beta and 2 years of Dota and near 4 years of Dota 2 I can say you are very uninformed:  -As of today: Dota 2 is nearing 11 million players (I guess your video was recorded 6-8 months ago?), and this is not counting the ammount of people in the Philippines and China who still play dota 1 because their computers can't run dota 2.  -What's wrong with crowdfunded prizes? Riot games is a multimillion dollar company (Need me to remind you they where acquired for $400 million?). If they wanted they could do something similar.  -You mention the ""encourage you to get out of your comfort zone and try new characters"".  Do you know Dota 2 has an ""All hero challenge"" in which you're issued a Hero whom you must win with to follow to the next one till you're done with all the current heroes? At the end of it, you get a trophy, you can do it all over again. If that's not encouraging players to try all heroes to you, then I don't know how waiting week after week for rotation is.  -Bringing out Dota 1 models as an argument.  -You mention the characters on Dota being ""bland"" with names like ""Lich"" and ""Warlock"". FYI: Dota characters have a Name and a Title, so Kel'Thuzad is the Lich while Demnok Lannik is the Warlock.  -Regarding people picking and playing the hero they want, well you can't in LoL, as it's likely the hero you like it's unbalanced and your opponents will just pick the most OP stuff, that's what they do.  -You can actually view the Dota 2 models from a 3rd person perspective, there is a button in the portrait which allows you to do so.  -LoL's other maps are irrelevant, barely any people play in them, so ""choice"" as you mention it, doesn't exist.  -LoL had the same meta during all the time I played it (Solo top, mid, jungler, carry and support on bot), while Dota 2 meta changes every time there's a patch (from 2-1-2 to 3 lane safelane, solo offlane etc.).  -Dota 2's cosmetics can be dropped, traded and even sold.  And the list goes on man, the other guy was quite soft on you.  I love your Game theory videos, but please take my advice and stick to those, DeadLock seems to take time away from you while making you look bad.  Edit: some typos."
GameTheorists,32ljiu,Noc3,-1,Sat Apr 18 12:18:02 2015 UTC,"The debate was about which is the ""better"" game, right? For me that includes the impact on the industry as whole. Some things that I think should have been discussed:  1) LoL is a much better model for Free-to-Play games, in the sense that it is a win-win for players and developers. (Content creators work hard and deserve financial stability and extra funds to update and improve their projects.)  2) DOTA is currently owned and operated by Valve, a company that, (for a lot of players of video games,) make the PC a more than viable competitor in the console war. Of course the prize money is going to be much greater.  3) The deeper you delve into both DOTA and LoL, the more differences there are, but at a base, (albeit almost superficial level,) the games are similar enough that casual players just looking to have fun are more rewarded by the multiple game-modes of LoL than they are by the one-and-only tried-and-true 3-lane 5-hero mode in DOTA.  These points are all pretty biased, as I am a very casual moba player, and I definitely prefer LoL to DOTA. I don't not enjoy DOTA, (actually I play OMD Unchained the most out of all MOBAs) but I am aware enough of my bias that I think I should mention it.   Going back to my first bit, (a debate about the ""better"" of two games should include the games' impact on the industry as a whole) is there anything I left out? What points would you have included to proved your favorite of the two is superior?   EDIT: After reading some of the other comments on this thread, I just want to make it known that I have played both DOTA and LoL, and I understand that DOTA is definitely the more intricate and strategy-intensive game. My points are points that I think MatPat should have brought up. And for what it's worth, as a below-average player, I prefer DOTA to LoL in that in DOTA, I have more confidence in my teammates' ability to direct me in a way that prevents me from losing the game for them. In LoL, the other players are serious enough to get (understandably) vocally frustrated with me, but are casual enough that they can't help me help them win. Does that make sense? It better, cause this is a long ass-edit, and I'm not redoing it. But to reiterate, I am aware enough of my lack of skill that I think I should mention it, as it is relevant to my experience, and I still think LoL is a ""better"" game."

GameTheorists,32845s,clacas,2,Mon Apr 13 15:53:17 2015 UTC,"If peach have a weapon must be a Magical one, not a chemical or atomic one, that why it need so many stars.  Also always wonder how the Mushroom Kingdom take control of the land, and if Bowser can turn the toads in to bricks maybe Peach can turn Goombas and Koopas in Paintings and more bricks for her own,  and maybe thats the reason why Bowser never attacs with Fire Power the Castle...  The castle is made of his people... and Bowser also is trying to turn them back... thats why he never attacs directly and always kindnaps (and not kill) the only person in the whole kingdom who knows how to turn them back to life: Princes Peach."
GameTheorists,32845s,clacas,2,Sat Apr 11 16:33:10 2015 UTC,I like this theory but maybe peach can't change them back and she and the stars need to be close to the castle + weapon for it to continue its effects and keep Browsers people hostage and he doesn't kill her because she is linked to the kidnapped Goombas as a fail safe and killing her kills them. But if she isn't in the castle she can't power the machine and so eventually it just wears off (like a drug effect where in time it will wear off). This would explain how the Toad are able to go wherever but are not common in later areas of the 8 worlds (they need to stay close to the weapon so that they keep getting its effects maybe its also adictive?)   Reminds me of that one episode of Stargate where there is a machine that is addictive and humans (adults) will sit in front of it all day long and the kids need to get there food n stuff (kids don't get affected as much)
GameTheorists,32845s,ilivetofly,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:25:11 2015 UTC,"I would agree that the weapon would be magical, but I have something to shut this theory down! MatPat says peach has Stockholm Syndrome, which is when the prisoner falls in love with their captor, well the reason Bowser never destroys the castle is simply this: Peach likes him-Bowser might as well-which means the castle isn't destroyed because Bowser wants to make Peach at home once he takes over the Mushroom Kingdom, but Mario keeps stopping him because he is jealous of Peach. I know Peach has kissed Mario, but that is because even though she likes Bowser, she can't decide between Mario and Bowser. Plus the castle is filled with TOADS!!!!"

While the second isn't that far fetched for a pokemon center to have, the first is. It made me wonder if perhaps in the anime, the entire region was still recovering from the war and had many procedures and defenses still in place from that era.  ...Or the pokemon anime universe could just be wacky.

We have to believe there's some kind of ""alt timeline"" here to make what happens true.    Timeline A (where the group first makes it to 2300AD), Marle and Crono aren't married, but that doesn't mean she couldn't have mated with another person.  So Doan would still be alive.  Timeline B (Post visit to 2300AD, pre Lavos).  This would be near identical to the first only the two would have conceived the descendant before fighting Lavos/losing.  Timeline C (Post visit, Post Lavos, Marriage Ending).  We can assume that Crono and Marle are the perfect pairing, but even so they'd have to have been married (thus getting that ending). Any other ending would tie into a cross between this timeline and Timeline A.  Where Crono isn't the father, and Marle is still pregnant with (what would be) the ancestors of Doan.    It's a lot of the whole time line thing, but You are partially correct.  Doan exists no matter what the state of 2300 AD is in either timeline.  You are correct that 2300 AD shouldn't be ruined the first time you enter it, but that's assuming you're looking at THAT timeline (Timeline C) instead of the intended first arrival (Timeline A)"

Aside from that, this is territory where we're assuming that Phoneguy (FNAF1) and Purpleman (the killer) are one and the same.  This would tie into the connected theories I've made with the reasoning why the toy animatronics try to attack the guard in FNAF2.   Anyway, this is totally plausible.  If PhGuy was locking himself in the backroom with the GB/ST suit then it would make sense.  However I think that it's not the ghosts of the children that are attacking him, but the bots.  He could be seeing the children inside the suits, the inner spirits.  Then as he tries to hide he left his recorder on the ground, entered ST, and the death sounds occur.

Even if the puppet ""was always thinking"" that would be paranoia, not schizophrenia. Schitzo would mean he had created voices in his head, instead of hearing ones that already existed (the spirits of the children).  While the puppet could have influenced the final act, he wasn't there. IIRC there were 5 children in the end of FNAF3. Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, Freddy, and GFreddy. No puppet. The Puppet however is the one who brings them cake at the end, but notice how they already had the masks on.

It was then that I created a little headcanon for myself (which I suppose is actually real canon now for the localized version): while “Gyakuten Saiban” takes place in Japan, the Los Angeles that “Ace Attorney” takes place in is an alternate universe where anti-Japanese sentiments and anti-immigrant laws were not enacted, and Japanese culture was allowed to flourish and blend into the local culture in the same manner as other immigrant cultures."

GameTheorists,31li1b,Pokadottedballs,4,Mon Apr 6 04:51:41 2015 UTC,"Well an existing theory is that Krieg is Tiny Tina's father, who after getting separated from Tina after they were turned in by Fleshstick and Tina uses the grenade her mother gave her, was experimented upon with slag to become the monster he is today. Here's my evidence to back it up.  We know that slag experimentation was going on at the Wildlife Exploitation Preserve from the audio logs in the Doctor's Orders quest (I think that's the one) and Krieg mentions something that can only be described as Slag in one of his Raving Retribution quotes: ""You're gonna scream, just like she did; open mouth, open heart, blood and noise forever piercing my skull, poisoning me with its psychopathic purple liquid. We watched it all, and felt the knife edge split down the middle... CAN YOU HEAR ME?!"" so it's not a stretch to believe that he was experimented with using Slag.  If Krieg was used in Hyperion Slag experimentation it would make sense that the only crime he has committed on his wanted poster is ""property of Hyperion"" as they would want his part to continue their experiments.  The she Krieg talks about alot are actually three different people, Tina, who after getting separated from he wonders about her safety, his wife, who he talks about when says 'she' screamed or cried, and Sammy, a researcher I'll get to in a second. I can only assume that the crazy Krieg doesn't know to distinguish between the three in his quotes, and when sane Krieg speaks he only refers to one of the three.  Another piece of evidence that I haven't seen many people talk about is that in the final Headhunter DLC ""Sir Hammerlock and the Son of Crawmerax"" there is a quest that has people from the Vault Hunters' past coming to kill them, only to be killed by someone ELSE from there past. The message Krieg gets from his mysterious savior is from someone calling themselves Sammy. The only person to ever be called Sammy in the game is the researcher in the audiologs at the Wildlife Exploitation Preserve who Handsome Jack kept referring to as Sammy despite the researcher's protests. It could stand to reason that after Krieg escaped the Preserve (as seen in his announcement trailer) Jack would make the lead researcher become part of the experiments herself as punishment (which he also threatened to do to the researcher's wife in the audiologs, so there's no question about his hesitation to do so). If we assume that Sammy is the researcher in charge of Krieg's experiments it would also explain why Sammy says ""SORRY AS A SLICE WOUND"" in her message to Krieg at the end of the quest.  When Krieg finds his 'assassin' he says the line ""HE WAS THERE FOR THE BIRTHING! HE BROUGHT THEM INTO THE METAL FUN PALACE SO SHE COULD START THE PARTY!"" From this it can be assumed that this guy was one of the people who took Krieg to the place where they experimented on him and the 'she' would be Sammy the researcher.  In the Headhunter DLC ""Mad Moxxi and the Wedding Day Massacre"" when Moxxi asks if there's a miss Kreig, he says ""THE TINY ONE AND THE SAD-FACED MOTHER AND THE BLUE TATTOO FOREVER AND EVER!"" The tiny one would be his daughter Tiny Tina, the sad-faced other would be his wife, and the blue tattoo would be Maya who in the video A Meat Bicycle Built for Two, Krieg has shown affection for.  From some of Krieg other quotes we can see that he watched as his wife was experimented on and/or killed.  With the Raving Retribution quote: ""I'll never forget the way her holes cried... The way she screamed in agony as she pushed the knife slowly into my sternum... Such a beautiful symphony of feelings, and at the end of it, she was so much greater! My operatic diva of flesh and steel!!"" The her he speaks of is his wife. The next sentence talks about her screaming as ""she""(who I can only assume is Sammy, with Krieg not distinguishing between the two women) cut her open. At the ed he also says 'My operatic diva' it would make sense somewhat if the person in question is his wife when he's says my, as you wouldn't say my anything when referring to a complete stranger.  A explanation of why Krieg doesn't remember Tina when he encounters her in the game could be that he can't remember his daughter after all the pain and suffering he's been through. He says in another quote ""I can't see her anymore... She was so clear and bright... but the blood is in my eyes, and now I can only watch the ocean of blood... Its waves crash against my forehead again and again, AND I JUST NEED TO LEARN HOW TO SURF!!"" so maybe he can't remember Tina's face by the time he sees her again, and she wouldn't be able to tell who he is due to the mask and the noticeable change in voice.   I'm sorry for jumping around a lot, and I probable forgot some bits and pieces of evidence but it's about 1 where I am so sue me. I know I'm not MatPat but I hope I can provide you with some semblance of explanation of who i believe Krieg is. To me Krieg is a very unfortunately victim to the harsh, unforgiving planet of Pandora.  TL;DR Krieg is Tiny Tina's father who Hyperion experimented on with Slag, which drove him crazy."
GameTheorists,31li1b,HeWhoVexes,2,Mon Apr 6 06:40:41 2015 UTC,Interesting! however i looked and apparently the devs of borderlands has flat out said that kreig is not tinas father! which bums me out cause this would've been awesome :(
GameTheorists,31li1b,TheTjTerror,0,Mon Apr 6 16:25:41 2015 UTC,Where have they said this? I have seen devs lie about future things in order to keep it secret. Example: Hideo Kojima during MGS2
GameTheorists,31li1b,HeWhoVexes,2,Mon Apr 6 18:32:43 2015 UTC,"I would be interested to see it too. While devs have lied about things before, it is also possible they worded it in a way that they could loop hole themselves out of it when/if they decide to reveal."
GameTheorists,31li1b,TheTjTerror,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:19:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I've had this theory in my head for a long time, the amount of evidence is staggering. I think it's only a matter of time before they actually reveal his back story. I think every other playable character in borderlands 2 has had their background revealed."
GameTheorists,31li1b,HeWhoVexes,2,Tue Apr 7 06:52:14 2015 UTC,Well let's see the original four Vault Hunter each have their own comic.  The Vault Hunters in the base game of 2 each have their starting echoes and the ones hidden on certain maps. Gaige has echoes on YouTube released prior to her release. The Pre-sequel is similar so yea Krieg is excluded on the backstory side. The only other character who's backstory is even close to mysterious is Zero as nobody is quite sure what he/she/it is or where he/she/it came from.
GameTheorists,31li1b,TheTjTerror,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:34:54 2015 UTC,Yeah. Maybe Krieg and Zero's will be released at the same time.
GameTheorists,31li1b,Mr_Cumbox,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:11:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you pretty much hit the nail on the head here. A few things worth adding:  Tina supposedly got her love of explosives from that grenade - It's the last thing she remembers of her parents. We already know she has some odd coping mechanisms... For instance, torturing her parents' killer to death at a tea party she threw for him. It's easy to believe that she'd also turn to pyromania to cope with her parents' loss.  Also, it's believed that Krieg (the screaming psycho,) was born from the slag experimentation, and that the calm voice is actually who Krieg was before the experiments. (I'll call him The Voice, to keep things simple.) So The Voice was simply ""buried"" when Krieg took over. Krieg is a raging masochist, because he needed to enjoy pain in order to withstand the experiments.  It's also believed that Krieg wasn't actually intentionally created in the experiments - The psycho was born in The Voice's mind as a defense mechanism, and took over to help The Voice block out the painful experimentation. Now Krieg simply refuses to relinquish control back to The Voice.  To further note on what The Voice says about ""the deserving"". There are a few other lines mentioning that, usually when you kill a bandit - It's a way for The Voice to ""guide"" Krieg into only killing the bad guys. So supposedly, The Voice tells Krieg who is deserving of death, and Krieg takes care of the rest - If it weren't for that control, Krieg would just be a mindless killing machine. As soon as he stepped foot in Sanctuary, he'd just start butchering every person he saw.  Despite Krieg's masochism and obsession with death, he clearly wants to continue living - The only concrete threat The Voice ever makes is that he'll commit suicide if Krieg ever kills someone who is undeserving. This also seems to imply that The Voice is capable of taking control, if only for brief periods of time."
GameTheorists,31li1b,HeWhoVexes,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with the inner Krieg being the man prior to the psycho it was just one of the things I forgot to add when I was writing the theory. I had kinda figured that psycho Krieg was created so as to protect the sane man inside and especially to deal with the pain and torture he experienced. Although I do believe psycho Krieg is two parts defense mechanism and one part Slag mutation, as I don't believe Krieg would be as strong as he is or psycho Krieg as dominate if not for some semblance of outside interference. As, to my knowledge, people with disorders like Krieg's (Dissociative Personality Disorder), their personalities are not to the point of one personality suppressing others to the point of almost nonexistence, as inner Krieg has never been shown to take over (correct me if I'm wrong but I can't remember an instance). He threatens to, and by all means I believe he would if it came to it, but despite his singular threat he carries no sway over psycho Krieg, minus suggestions. But anyway thanks for helping me clear up some stuff."

By my second half of my third term as President (I had turned off the term limit) I had eliminated the religious and was excommunicated by the pope. Without a religious backing I went full left by my fourth term and the right wing had disappeared, leaving me to run unopposed. By this time I had accomplished just about everything. I ran an atheist America with the best education available, a state of the art train network, and an excellent healthcare system that kept everybody in shape. By my fifth term I was once again unopposed and...had almost nothing to do. Half way through it the global economy crashed and the country began to sink down with it. My efforts to fix it were too socialistic and resulted in a brain drain that crippled recovery. My sixth turn came about and I was still unopposed however I decided to resign (quit playing) and left the nation.  TL;DR I made an atheist USA, get on my level."

It was even indicated in the message that he was killed by them.  The Killer was herded around the room by ghost children and then got in the springtrap suit.  He started laughing and then the suit killed him.  As much as people want it to be the phone guy I don't think it is."
GameTheorists,31i0vx,bovinez,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:24:19 2015 UTC,"That's true, I thought he had seen the kids instead of the suits, and that he knew all along what was happening.  My other thought was that he would know to hide in the suit and act like he were alive a la FNAF2's Freddy head, and at this point he was killed by the suit after he panicked and stood under the water.  If I recall correctly, MatPat said that phone guy may have called from inside the building, so that was where I drew my conclusion from."
GameTheorists,31i0vx,Mathaeuz,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:42:39 2015 UTC,"The bad shape in which the spring trap suit is found should be justified through the three decades that has passed since fnaf 1. The time difference from 2 to 1 is of about 6 years, according to other theories, so I'd just find thirty years a reasonable enough time for a suit to rot."
GameTheorists,31i0vx,Empolo,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:02:55 2015 UTC,"I can't agree.  Springtrap had to be ""born"" after FNAF2.    Golden Bonnie was never in FNAF2 or FNAF1.  The suit was never found, and never possessed in either game.  This is because it was still in storage.  Purple Guy is the guard from FNAF2.  Why else would the original bots try to kill him as well as the Toy ones with ""Facial recognition software""?  The old ones recognize his face, and the new ones have him in the data for the security.  However the owners of this Fazbears Pizza didn't do a background check or were too hasty for a new guard.  Purple Guy hides in the Golden Bonnie suit at the end of FNAF3 because he knows it'll keep him safe from the spirits.  After dismantling the New models (from FNAF1) PurpleGuy expected the spirits to stop haunting them, but they don't.  They follow him into the back where he was going to destroy the suit, but instead he hides in it, meeting his doom.    That's just my input."

If you are that determined to follow your dreams of being an actor: be prepared for many, many people telling you to give up. from family, to friends, to other actors and even directors. your life you will lead will be stressful, uncertain, and sometimes heartbreaking.  if you think that going through that to be an actor is worth it, then go for it. just be hard skinned and have hardened resolve.  if any thing, you should go to a school near a big city center and and some sort of film program. directors wont care about your shiny peice of paper saying that you're an actor. they want to see your reel. As a student in film, I always need actors who are willing to work for food and good material for their reel."

Im in 12th grade and I can tell you about a multitude of classmates who constantly switched what they wanted to study in university so just try to find what you see yourself working in in 10, 15 maybe even 20 years and find the right path for that (It doesnt even have to be college, think about how you can achieve it and do it)  TL; DR: Standard life advice, do it if you are passionate and be ready to possibly change your mind multiple times."

All you do is hire suicide bombers to blow up your opponents walls. Your main enemy goblins, you enslave to attack your foes. Then once you hit town hall 7 everything changes. The elixer you find doesn't satisfy you. You need Dark Elixer to satisfy your war craze. Then you mutate your most expendable troop the barbarian to  grow bigger and enslave other barbarians. Then you  train monsters and mutants and Mr. T's to attack your foes. Your town hall then becomes black and lava spewing out of the sides. Then your walls that were once stacked stone now electrocutes your enemy's to a crisp. So the chief is really a war crazed savage. Hey but that's just a theory, a game/app theory."

Take the Rathalos hammer: here  That is essentially a head on a stick, The Rathalos is normally anywhere between the size of 1140.6 cm (smallest) and 2248.6 cm (largest) a whole head must weight quite a bit with that size.

GameTheorists,318ho0,derpatitus-b,13,Fri Apr 3 06:33:50 2015 UTC,"I think there's more than enough evidence in Borderlands 2 to show that, even through the betrayals, Handsome Jack is no hero.  Not at the conclusion of his demise, in any respect.  Certainly, the protagonists in Borderlands aren't exactly heroes either, but Handsome Jack has a number of monstrous atrocities that he does or commands before or during Borderlands 2.  Off the top of my head:  He promotes human experimentation with Slag, a highly toxic and dangerous chemical that basically mutates anything it's applied to.  (Wildlife Exploitation Preserve)  He ruthlessly murders unarmed civilians and destroys families, even of those who work under him. (Helena Pierce's journals, Opportunity logs, everything involving Tiny Tina)  He literally enslaved his own daughter and used her to start the events of Borderlands 1, bringing the entire events from BL1 under his influence.  The Vault Hunters were unknowingly there because of him, and he used them first, lying to them and risking their lives.  Of course the Vault hunters aren't going to trust him.  (logs from Get to Know Jack and his dialogue through the game)  There is probably more, but these actions range from before BL1 to after BL: TPS.  Handsome Jack has always been evil to some extent, perhaps not as much as after he tasted blood and was stabbed in the back by the Vault Hunters, but do the actions of others against you excuse your own actions, allowing you to commit horrific atrocities because they did it first?  Anyways, there's some conflicting evidence that I think was overlooked in the episode and... probably should be mentioned.  Also, yeah, Jack totally has at least BPD, if not more, wrong with him.  Honestly almost everyone in Borderlands has SOMETHING wrong with them in the head."
GameTheorists,318ho0,Zegon,8,Thu Apr 2 22:07:45 2015 UTC,"I'd say, despite your arguments, I would still consider him a hero in a sense. As you mentioned, he did enslave his daughter but, from the mission where you ""get to know jack"" we find out that he does this after Angel's siren powers cause some sort of accident injuring or possibly killing her mother/ Jack's wife. Here enslavement could quite possibly be his way of trying to protect others from what he believes to be Angel's unstable powers.  Also, on the topic of ruthless family killing, I'd say Jack just considers most Pandoran citizens to be ""bandits"". It's possible Jack is killing them out of paranoia of them betraying him, caused by his bad experiences in the past."
GameTheorists,318ho0,EpicSmith,4,Thu Apr 2 23:08:46 2015 UTC,"With regard to Angel, I counter that while he may have tried to give some sense of control for her Siren powers, in doing so he had no need to enslave her to his own whims.  At the end she even goes so far as to ask for euthanasia at the hands of the Vault Hunters than be under Jack's control.  She despises what she's become and wants to stop her father at all costs.  Furthermore, onto the killing of innocents, at what point of considering 'Sentient people who are from Pandora' a dangerous people who need to be eliminated at all costs?  Heck, I'd go as far as to say if that is the case, if he thinks all of Pandora's people bandits and worthy of elimination, Jack is even being racist in a sense (where race is defined by all the people 'native' to the planet of Pandora, or Pandorans to give them a name).  I think we can safely say that prejudice in this sense is not a heroic trait.  This doesn't touch on his human experimentation logs, or the bits of Opportunity lore where he tells an engineer (Kieth Sanders from the echolog) who is asking Jack why he'd build Opportunity on Pandora (He is clearly not from Pandora the way he speaks of it) and mentions how he has two sons and Jack tells him that he doesn't anymore.  This means Jack has either eliminated the children or, by some other means, 'relieved' Kieth of his kids permanently.  I'm not sure how this could be considered a non-villainous quality.  I think Handsome Jack fancied himself a Crusader, bringing order and righteousness to a lawless wasteland ruled over by, in his own words savages and bandits who eat baby-stew.  And in that I think he's right in his own mind, in that many groups through history who have done similar things have been looked on with condemnation through the lenses of history.  The conquistadors and other Spanish explorers who came to the Americas, the colonization of Africa, treatment of native peoples by the Christian Church...  There are plenty of examples that lead to great tragedy.  He truly saw himself as a hero, but many of fiction and history's greatest monsters saw themselves as right.  It helps make a compelling and multi-dimensional character, a villain that you can empathize with.  However, none of these things can, or do, excuse his atrocities."
GameTheorists,318ho0,Zegon,3,Fri Apr 3 00:23:22 2015 UTC,"I'd say Jack just considers most Pandoran citizens to be ""bandits"".   Thats no excuse, especially since its not true.

Sure maybe Riptor and Sabrewolf if they were mutated humans a la ""Beebop and Rocksteady"" type mutagin.  Otherwise nope.  Debunked."

GameTheorists,310ama,Empolo,2,Thu Apr 9 02:27:37 2015 UTC,"Very plausible.  As with MK, the idea that warriors and fighters from different places coming to fight for rule of a world/realm.  I didn't know there were comics, so I'll for sure have to check them out.  I like your Theory about Ultratech but like Clacas said, needs moar research."
GameTheorists,30ywau,Gelate98,3,Tue Mar 31 20:41:07 2015 UTC,Whoa i remember the ads for this but never played it. What was the gameplay like? And did that feature mean you always had play during the day?
GameTheorists,30ywau,SprayingMantis9,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:54:11 2015 UTC,"I thought it was 'okay'.  Your gun charged on sunlight, as mentioned... that was pretty much the gimmick.  It did have a day/night cycle, though.  If you played at night, your gun just used the energy it had stored up during the day.  The GBA's terrible screen pretty much made the game impossible to play in sunlight, rendering the whole thing an exercise in masochism.  But it was a really neat idea."
GameTheorists,30ywau,gatesphere,1 point,Wed Apr 1 14:12:07 2015 UTC,"well the game you coudl play it anytime, just that when it was sunny outside and went out, you had a boost, as you could stand down on a skylight hole (in the game) and charge your gun, but if you used your gun too much it woudl overheat and you had to wait till the next day to use it effectively again"

If they are completely made out of steel, including the organs - if they have them - then the steel should simply conduct the electricity to the ground without anything happening. But even with normal animal like organs, the steel would simply conduct the electricty around them without anything happening, since going through organs would mean going through higher resistance.  Flight and ground pokemon: Well, here the logic should be exacly opposite. The earth pokemon, if they are not under the earth, would simply mean a faster way for the elctricty to travel to ground and therefor move through the pokemon - damaging them! - and then going into the ground. Flying pokemon, since not grounded, would be much harder to hit!"

GameTheorists,30uars,clacas,13,Mon Mar 30 20:19:15 2015 UTC,"While it was sponsored, I have to say the level of the quality of the episode was spectacular. And to be fair, ever episode is sponsored: by us. We watch the episodes, adding to the view count, the ad revenue and the exposure. This was obvious sponsored by Ubisoft, but look at it like this: Ubisoft saw that MatPat does research and has a talent for teaching his audience about different things through video games. They saw that his audience not only likes to be entertained but likes to learn. So Ubisoft saw that MatPat was worth the effort put into this to sell their game. And I think thats something we should be happy about. Our little MatPat, who went from talking about boobs and time travel to being sponsored by important game companies and he still makes it informational to us. All in all, I hope that this Reality Check series lasts a while, I do like it."
GameTheorists,30uars,Clarkmeister,5,Tue Mar 31 00:28:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair Ubisoft are really good at this youtube stuff, they are a bit too with it imo...   They bought my entire subscription feed back when Black Flag came out..."

They've added so many new segments since then, and nearly all of them bring new and interesting things to the table.   Sure this newer show might've been sponsored for the first episode, but I don't even care, it was still interesting. I've had rainbow six sitting on my shelf for nearly a year now, maybe i'll finally play it."

GameTheorists,30uars,letuotter,4,Mon Mar 30 22:31:25 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved this bit of content. It was so well thought out and executed, I'm really looking forward to seeing more like this! I'm really not upset it was sponsored, either. Look at the production quality. Look at the facilities they used. This sort of thing costs money. I trust /u/MatPatGT to give me his honest perspective (Though, this isn't a review video. I have other YouTubers for that--TB) on something even though he was sponsored to give publicity. That's the trust I as a consumer have in him and his brand and product.  If he and his crew continue to use sponsored money to turn out quality, enjoyable content, I really have no problem with it. I look forward to the next installment!"
GameTheorists,30uars,My_Sports_Account,6,Mon Mar 30 22:35:30 2015 UTC,"Kinda weird seeing these guys straight up ask video game questions to the real dudes...it's like asking the cops ""hey is it true you guys have army tanks ready and available when people get six stars?""."
GameTheorists,30uars,Princess_Cherry,2,Mon Mar 30 22:41:38 2015 UTC,"Hold up, when you get six stars and have army tanks after you it is because the army is also after you."
GameTheorists,30uars,Ruukkz,27,Thu Apr 2 14:00:26 2015 UTC,"I just wish he would say straight away when he's doing these paid videos. I personally don't like them (mostly because of how OBVIOUS they are in painting the games in WAY too good light, it doesn't feel right for this channel) but I know many who still do. I just want MatPat to be honest when it's a paid ad or his own words."
GameTheorists,30uars,DummiesBelow,10,Mon Mar 30 20:16:06 2015 UTC,"For things like this I usually check the description (Dan Bull has a lot of sponsored videos). He says ""Thanks to Ubisoft for making this video possible."" I hope that he has enough integrity to have this not affect his video and the results though."
GameTheorists,30uars,Ruukkz,2,Mon Mar 30 20:20:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true. I just didn't like how he didn't even mentioned it in the video. I'm really just worried he will do more and more paid videos  until it's just that, like other channels I've seen. Maybe I'm just another dude scared of change..."
GameTheorists,30uars,Kyoukon,9,Mon Mar 30 20:24:16 2015 UTC,"http://puu.sh/gVCk7/74989f0487.jpg That's from the end of the video. Whilst it might have been better to put it at the start of the video or during it, he does mention that Ubisoft helped pay for it."
GameTheorists,30uars,Ruukkz,3,Mon Mar 30 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah that should have been at the very start. But thanks for posting that, I didn't stay the whole video."
GameTheorists,30uars,Kyoukon,4,Mon Mar 30 21:16:35 2015 UTC,"I think it might have been because people tend to scream 'sell-out' at any hint of a sponsored video without actually watching it first. Admittedly, when I saw the video, I thought it was sponsored, and checked the like/dislike ratio to verify. Why? Because sponsored videos, more often than not, have a disproportionate amount of dislikes and a comments section of people screaming about how [x] YouTuber sold out for money. By putting the message at the end, people actually had to watch and judge the content without the view that it may or may not be paid for, and perhaps realise that it was good when they might not have even watched it before."
GameTheorists,30uars,Ruukkz,2,Mon Mar 30 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"But you know right away that this is paid for. He don't have to hide it, it just makes it worse."
GameTheorists,30uars,letuotter,3,Mon Mar 30 21:47:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think ""hiding"" means what you think it means.  Do your friends all come up and vet all of their conversation topics before they start with you?  ""Hey, dude, I'm gonna talk about this new video game I got.  Is that cool with you?  No?  Okay, I'll leave.""  The last thing you could ever reasonably accuse MatPat of is not being forthcoming with his audience.  Just because he doesn't give you a tumblr-esque ""Trigger Warning"" doesn't mean the video sucks."
GameTheorists,30uars,DummiesBelow,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:29:50 2015 UTC,Best possible scenario would be that he will continue to do his normal videos but slowly be able to do bigger and higher production value experiments because of the companies paying him. We just have to hope that his opinion stays unbiased and isn't changed because he is being paid.
GameTheorists,30uars,ca-bi,27,Mon Mar 30 20:39:34 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree. I think MatPat works with sponsored content really well, and it was still great to watch."
GameTheorists,30uars,DigRatChild,12,Mon Mar 30 22:02:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought it was pretty cool. So what if he was slightly pandering to the sponsorship at the end? The video was still ass-kickin, you can't deny that."
GameTheorists,30uars,Arkonisas,5,Tue Mar 31 01:05:02 2015 UTC,I think that's already pretty obvious. The links on the very top of the description alone gives it away
GameTheorists,30uars,iceytoa1,3,Mon Mar 30 20:37:31 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the opening screen being that ""Rainbow Six Siege"" logo told me it was sponsored."
GameTheorists,30uars,Wefee11,6,Tue Mar 31 15:10:08 2015 UTC,"I find it positive that more and more people are sceptical about this kind of content. The disclosure in the description is really the minimum that is expected. A ~3 second ""sponsored by"" screen in the beginning, an annotation or a word in the title would be things that can be considered, too.  I know youtube is bullcrap at the moment so I have nothing against paid content, but I can't take his words in this video serious. It's different and entertaining though."
GameTheorists,30uars,Ruukkz,0,Mon Mar 30 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is how I feel as well. ""Sponsored by"" screen would be great! I think it's great if paid videos lead to more and better ""original"" content, as long as he's honest about it, and as long as his opinions in other videos stay his own."

GameTheorists,30uars,alexlightfoot1,3,Tue Mar 31 01:25:19 2015 UTC,"I have to say, whilst I very much enjoyed this video, and didn't mind so much that it was a promotional video, there is something that irks me a little about the show's concept. Since MatPat refers to it as a 'new' show, one can assume that there will be more to come. While I love having a look at the real-life equivalents to situations that come up in video games, I feel that these shows are going to be limited to only a handful of genres, and these are mostly simulation-based genres. This means that the show is quite limited in its scope, and thus will have a limited life-span (unless we see an episode for every shovelware simulator out there!). Correct me if I'm wrong, but even though this show is great, it seems like it won't be around very long."
GameTheorists,30uars,916253,2,Tue Mar 31 03:10:22 2015 UTC,"Some of the jokes felt a bit corny, but overall this was a great episode, glad to see this new take on gaming!"
GameTheorists,30uars,ArgonSyn,2,Tue Mar 31 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"I was not a fan of this episode.The whole thing felt like a cheesy American reality show (all the one liners no one has a conversation, the music, the fake tenseness) and how much it pandered to obviously put Rainbow 6 in a good light. Every splash screen and a 2 minute advert at the start and another at the end, really?"
GameTheorists,30uars,Goracyi,2,Tue Mar 31 09:59:07 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. The idea is great seeing how it looks like from a gamer perspective and a real live person taht works as a Counter-Terrorist etc. (hoped ppl understand what i'm saing ;)) But when you see the results its just 1,2,3 done no comparison no pros and cons only the positive side about R6. For anyone who says it was legit i say to you this do you really think Ubisoft didn't payed for this event only to get a positive grade ? Yea. I'm not saying MatPat selled out he had a oportunity and he took it i understand that but don't argue that Ubi's as a paing ""employer"" didn't influated the resault. No one whants to piss of the employer that's understandable. But they should be more open about it :/"

The teacher that talks about John is one of the those plants. It's far too convenient to have such a perfect life and then have it cut short.   In so far as any clones, the only sort of cloning humans have that don't fail quickly are single organs. Its hard to believe that they would secretly have a the ability to reproduce a full human, regardless of age."
GameTheorists,30siem,Havoc96,5,Mon Mar 30 09:50:23 2015 UTC,"The correct answer is that Mewtwo is number 150 with Mew being 151  The 150 mention was probably a reference to the video games in which you can only get 150 legitimately. In reality it was a secret pokemon included at the last minute as a easter egg of sorts, which turned into an event pokemon that was unknown to Nintendo for a period after release.  The way Pokemon Origins explains it is that Red realizes Mewtwo is out there from the Pokemon Mansion logs and thinks Mew to be extinct, and Oak adds in a blank slot for a pokedex entry before he heads off. Then, after its caught, Oak, Red and some others were eating lunch, then Red remembered that Mewtwo was said to come from Mew, and Oak upgraded the pokedex once more before Red went out to search for Mew."
GameTheorists,30siem,jamster533,3,Mon Mar 30 11:18:19 2015 UTC,"Huh. So it's entirely possible the creators of the anime didn't even know Mew existed at the time? Interesting...  Still. It seem's weird that Mewtwo would be on Bills door. The only way Bill could have known about him was to have been part of the research or have found those same logs.  But even then, those logs don't give you an accurate description, or at least a good enough one that Bill can copy the exact proportions of Mewtwo on his door. Unless Bill found a photo or something. Idk, I know down at heart it was just the animators adding something cool, but its just so interesting to think about! Hahaha"

GameTheorists,30siem,ilivetofly,1 point,Mon Mar 30 11:23:49 2015 UTC,I don't think the issue is with man made pokemon per say but I mean mew two is more of a myth at that point and the story don't paint a pretty picture.  Its possible he writ it off as an urban legend of some kind but still included it on the door because;   Looked bad ass  door related drawings are easier to cover over than to insert something new in so its there until its caught or disproven or euthanised
GameTheorists,30siem,scarecr0w141,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:52:24 2015 UTC,"That's true. But it still begs the question of how Bill even knows what Mewtwo looks like, Urban Legend or not, I believe it's established in the anime as well as the movie (apparently they're separate cannons or something) that Mewtwo isn't out and about just yet. He's still captured by Team Rocket.  The legendary birds make sense, considering they've been spotted before and there are probably a bunch of descriptions of them. But Mewtwo isn't in the wild (not by this point anyway) so how did Bill get a picture that looks EXACTLY like Mewtwo (or rather, created one) there's no way he could have guessed that that was what Mewtwo looked like. Unless he had some prior knowledge and or had seen Mewtwo himself."

Before putting Caroline's mind in GLaDOS, Apperture scientists tried to put Cave's mind in it, but failed. The thing is that Cave's mind did not just vanished, but his insane thoughts became part of Apperture's systems.  So when GLaDOS (Caroline) took control over Apperture, Johnson's thoughts corrupted her.  This is why when Weatley took control over Apperture, he became instantly insane, and why GLaDOS becomes more and more ""normal"" after that, and also why after recover her control over Apperture, she send Chell away ASAP; She knows that if Chell stays a little longer, she will lose control to Johnson's crazy thoughts again and will test Chell until one of them die.

Could Cave Johnson be saved as Wheatley?  Lets look at Wheatley,  He is self-absorbed, has no clue how to run the facility, and is hell bent on immortality  And now Cave, self-absorbed, crashed the company into the ground, and was hell bent on obtaining immortality.  Could these be coincidence? Possibly, but lets take into account that Cave lived in a science facility full of experimental equipment.

Sonic 2 on the SMS is a story about Sonic trying to save tails.  There are 2 endings. If you find all of the hidden choas gems (hidden in Act 2 of every stage) you get an extra set of levels.  Completing these levels gives you the real ending.  In the ending that isn't real (i.e. not all gems collected), it implies that you didn't save tails and that he is dead.  This persons suggestion is that Tails, in all of the games, is already dead and just part of Sonic's imagination.  He is pointing to the fact that Tails cannot die no matter what you do with him."

Unless you fit it after the plug, I have no reason to continue watching. And even then, I kind of don't care. It's nice to see other's artwork, and it's a great way for the community to contribute to the show, much like how /u/TheGeeNee remade the intro.  But, in the end it's something that a lot of your viewers may not care about. I wouldn't spend the extra time to sort through submissions for a small segment of the show. Even then, would you impose a quality control or would everyone get featured? I'd rather see good artwork than stuff that could be considered shock material.

About the abandoning humans thing, I agree but disagree because it's all a matter of what your religion is. If you're a Christian, then the Pagan are evil. If you belong to a modern Pagan religion, then the Christians are evil."

Also the black heart is not in inanimate it show signs of intelligence and self awareness when it reacts to the guardians showing up and then proceeds to defend itself"
GameTheorists,309qcg,caboose001,1 point,Thu Mar 26 00:30:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I used inanimate because it fit what Pagans believed. Druids worshipped snakes and they're not inanimate, yet they were Pagans. Also, if they were going to destroy The Darkness wouldn't there be at least a small rebellion?"
GameTheorists,309qcg,caboose001,2,Thu Mar 26 01:26:02 2015 UTC,It may fit what they believed in that way but it does not change the fact that it is a living thinking creature it's far from being a toaster because of that. But I supose it depends on how your looking at it. If your thought process (correct me i I'm wrong because I'm not sure how you drew your conclusion) was based on it being in organic/artificial then I don't really have any room to argue with you due to the heart/darkness never being explained as to what it really is thus the same could also be applied to the traveler. Now as for your rebellion question its kinda a yes and no thing. No they never did anything directly against the Darkness because they knew they would be outright wiped out that's why we have the 2 factions currently. Faction A worships the Darkness/heart in hope that they will be spared from its genocide. Faction B followed Atheon and was against the darkness. What Faction Bs idea was is that why would write themselves so deeply into history that no matter what the darkness did they could not fully be wiped out thus ensuring that they would have the time to build up their ranks and did a way to permanently deal with the darkness. I like to think of what they are doing as a game of chess they are taking their time and thoroughly planning their moves until the time is right to strike. At least they were until a team of guardians came and mucked it all up
GameTheorists,309qcg,caboose001,2,Fri Mar 27 00:41:06 2015 UTC,"Alright, but then why isn't the game about Guardians fighting the Vex, teaming up with them and then taking out the Fallen? Also, this kind of proves my point about how it's a Pagan God. Because there were multiple Pagan groups back in the Dark Ages. Druids, Goths, Visigoths, Ostrogoths, The Chinese, etc. Wouldn't there be an all out war? To perpetuate my theory, there are different in-game guilds such as the New Monarchy or Dead Orbit. Could this represent different versions of Christianity like Catholicism or Lutheranism?"
GameTheorists,309qcg,caboose001,2,Fri Mar 27 01:22:43 2015 UTC,"Moving off topic for a second, I must say that I am rather enjoying this conversation with you. It's not often that anything religious these days just ends abruptly with a fight. Back on topic now. The game from my understanding of it is the guardians against the Darkness in an attempt to regain lost territory and rebuild humanity. We are not currently at war with the Vex in fact they show very little interest in humanity at all. Yes they shoot on sight but it's more of a defense of goal kinda thing rather then the exterminate kind of thing that the Hive are attempting. The only reason they are even messing with the Cabal is that they are encroaching on the Vex's area and they see the Cabal as a threat to the heart and the Darkness. And the faction on Venus is only fighting the Fallen because they are getting too close to the Vault. As of right now  (post vault/death of the black heart) they do not pose a direct threat to the Traveler or the last city thus we have focused our might elsewhere (TDB). Now back to the Fallen they are for the most part like us jut not as lucky. The Traveler abandoned them when the Darkness came that why they were reduced to pirates and scavengers they have no home. They are fighting us for 2 reason that I can draw from the grimoire: 1) They need a new home and since Earth is ""safe"" and full of post-golden age resources they are trying to stake a clam to it. 2) They are royally PISSED that the Traveler abandoned then and not us  That being said I personally thing that we could even forge an alliance with the Fallen specifically the House of Exile in the future. The factions. I kinda see where you are going with this and the different offshoots of Christianity and I honestly don't really have too much to say on that because I personally believe it's more of political pissing match then anything useful like the Vanguard. If you could I'd like you to explain that portion to me a bit more if you can? And have a good night friend!"

GameTheorists,304y3v,duketrf,5,Tue Mar 24 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is a question to be addressed by psychology in more or less complex ways. Could even be addressed partially or completely by philosophy.   Simply, we can start of with Maslow's hierarchy of needs (yup, that pyramid yet again). Maslow's theory is more often than not partially accepted, and psychologist often propose modifications but that's a story for another time. As a concept, it's a good building block: video games directly adress the Esteem level and multiplayer games (like MMOs) fulfill Love/belonging. We could also propose that Safety is somewhat addressed mostly in a psychological way (like a shelter in rough times).  Those levels of Maslow's model have been expended upon by many. In the search of self growth, many models exist so I'm not gonna provide a link. But let me just state the 4 psychological needs cited in a activity I took,I think they are pretty accurate, everyone could remove or add a few things: Autonomy, Belonging, Love(to be loved and to love) and Amiability (to be liked as a person). Video games, in many cases and especially in MMOs, act as a catalyst for those things.  Lastly, I would like to propose a philosophical approach. Blaise Pascal along with being a great mathematician, ended up developing quite the philosophical ideology. One of the blocks in is though was about amusement (divertissement) which we use to escape the dreadful question of death. Yet again, I propose we only look at this as a building block: video games are a great escape from life; it's world where having fun is easy, where you impact the world in a meaningful and observable way, where their is an answer to most problem; it's a nice place to be and a more obvious place to evolve in than life could ever be. Which is why games are such an effective way to entertain and easily fulfill the needs expressed above.  Anyway, this whole rambling was just about providing what might be good insights to answer this great question.  TL;DR this is a complex question, there's not easy answer and you won't get a summary."

When falling from extreme heights, wind resistance always plays a major role, even when the air is completely still.  As I understand it, human terminal velocity is about 100mph or about 145ft/s.  A magikarp has a difference shape, so I can't say if their terminal velocity would be more or less, but it would be reasonably close.  Gforce does not matter quite so much when dealing with impacts.  The critical measurement is deceleration time; how much time it takes for the kinetic energy of the projectile to be imparted into the target.  The other concern is that the amount of energy in the impact is experienced by both the projectile and the target.  So unless you are using your magikarp in a sacrificial capacity, it is entirely possible that this blow will be fatal to the goofy lookin' water pokemon."

GameTheorists,3017s0,verdatum,2,Tue Mar 24 10:46:17 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid you are incorrect.  The formula for determining terminal velocity is v=sqrt(2mg/(ρAC))  Where    m = the mass of the object.  g = acceleration due to gravity ρ = the density of the fluid, in this case, earth's atmosphere (which alters based on altitude and temperature, but simplicity, it would be alright to consider it a constant) A = cross sectional area (this is why terminal velocity is different for a person whether they are splayed out horizontal vs. vertical like a dart) C = drag coefficient (the areodynamic wind-tunnel type junk)   From this equation, given 2 objects of the same size & shape (thus, the same values for A & C), the object with the higher density (greater m) has a higher terminal velocity.  And given 2 objects of the same mass and shape, the object with the larger size, (thus a higher cross-sectional area) will have a lower terminal velocity.  edit: cleaned up the wording in the last paragraph."

Without the fins, Magikarp is about 0.469m, almost half the size. With the new info Magikarp is about as wide as he is long so I aproximated it to be 0.469m squared. The drag coefficient  for similar shaped objects is about 0.4. The last thing I needed was the density of a magikarp, and as I couldn't find any sources for this I gave it the same density as the average human. 985 kg/m cubed. So assuming my calculations are correct and the density of a magikarp is similar to a human, the Magikarp's terminal velocity is 10.6675 ft/second. much less than the youtube poster predicted."
GameTheorists,3017s0,verdatum,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:29:34 2015 UTC,"No, you do not use the density of the falling body, you use the density of the fluid around the body, in this case, air.  The density of air changes based on ambient temperature and elevation, but you can use sea-level room temperature density of 1.225 kg/m3.  A better value for the cross-sectional area of magicarp would be pi*(.469/2)2  since in cross section, it would be roughly circular.  I'm too lazy to verify your drag coefficient, so recalculating under the presumption that this number is good, I get 48 m/s or 158 ft/s or 108mph, which is darned close to the 100mph I proposed in my previous comment.  Yay math!"

I have the same bloodline as my brother, but we aren't the same person. His kids will share the same bloodline as mine will. The Hero's Shade could be the representation of power that the Hero of Time had, not so much the physical characteristics of himself. Link would of only turned into a skull kid if he died in the Lost Woods itself. The comment section of the article makes some good points, but what really matters is that it's just a theory.

Just wanted to point out that you pointed to the Hyrule Historia to be canon. It says that the Hero of Time is no doubt the Hero's Shade. So, that part's wrong. But besides that, this is really convincing."
GameTheorists,3004fw,SnowHeadTemplar,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:20:46 2015 UTC,"Aonuma, the guy currently in charge of the Zelda series, most recently said that Termina is a ""nearby land"" to Hyrule that is just meant to evoke the feeling of a parallel universe rather than actually being a parallel universe itself. (Also the manual for the N64 game doesn't say Termina is a parallel universe, though the way it does describe the land can be interpreted that way.)  Also, a child dying in the Lost Woods would just result in them being dead. It's only when you get lost in the woods that you change (and it's not even 100% confirmed that lost children turn into Skull Kids; that's just what Navi speculates happens to lost children). But the point is unimportant because the Hero's Shade isn't a Stalfos, he's a ghost, and there's in-game evidence that points to the Hero's Shade potentially not actually being the same person as the Hero of Time, so that may not matter one way or the other.  Ultimately though, I do agree that Link wasn't dead during MM for various reasons already laid out in the OP and throughout this thread."

GameTheorists,3004fw,Petrichor03,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:46:41 2015 UTC,You forget that in a way MM link is an adult thanks to OoT.  Wouldn't MM link think himself a adult still.  And besides ghost can change form anyway.
GameTheorists,3004fw,gamer52599,1 point,Sat Apr 4 19:37:12 2015 UTC,"Well Zelda did return him to the past specifically so he could relive his lost childhood. Zelda intended that Link would think himself a child still. And since adult Link was really just a child in an adult body, and end-of-OoT Link was a child who had been in an adult's body for a couple of days before being returned to a child's body, that makes me think Link would have been a little more likely to view himself as a child.  Hyrule Historia also says that TP Link is a direct descendant of the Hero's Shade, so that means the Hero's Shade had to have had children before he died. OoT Link didn't have any children before the events of MM, so he either can't be dead in MM or he can't be the Hero's Shade.  It is possible that Hyrule Historia made an error somewhere in all this information though. It does make a number of errors throughout, and it implies that we're supposed to take the information in the games over the information in the book whenever there are contradictions. So you could still argue that Hyrule Historia is wrong if you absolutely wanted to to make your theory work."

Correlation between digit ratio and traits of article  Digit ratio:       Some authors suggest that digit ratio correlates with health, behavior, and even sexuality in later life. Below is a non-exhaustive list of some traits that have been either demonstrated or suggested to correlate with either high or low digit ratio.  A study in Germany has found a correlation between digit ratio and male-to-female transsexualism. Trans women were found to have a higher digit ratio than cisgender males, but one that was comparable to control females.   There is some evidence that 2D:4D ratio may also be indicative for human development and growth. Ronalds et al. (2002) showed that men who had an above average placental weight and a shorter neonatal crown-heel length had higher 2D:4D ratios in adult life.  Moreover, studies about 2D:4D correlations with face shape suggest that testosterone exposure early in life may set some constraints for subsequent development. Prenatal sex steroid ratios (in terms of 2D:4D) and actual chromosomal sex dimorphism were found to operate differently on human faces, but affect male and female face shape by similar patterns.  Fink et al. (2004) found that men with low (indicating high testosterone) and women with high (indicating high estrogen) 2D:4D ratios express greater levels of facial symmetry.  However, exposure to very high levels of testosterone and/or estrogen in the womb may have negative effects as well.     Interesting: Index finger | Neuroscience and sexual orientation | Peter L.

The thing is as cool as stuff like this can be, it seems like there's no real reason to make any shifts to these types of networking present in this sub-genre of sci-fi.

GameTheorists,2zafqc,EriktheBed,1 point,Tue Mar 17 14:23:28 2015 UTC,Yes. I think that the Puppet led the old animatronics around (as depicted in SaveThem where the Puppet lead Freddy around) while the newer ones had that police technology that made them dangerous.
GameTheorists,2zafqc,EriktheBed,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:44:59 2015 UTC,This is pretty good! Everything seems to make sense too. Nice work!
GameTheorists,2zafqc,EriktheBed,0,Tue Mar 17 01:30:54 2015 UTC,"I see this already got ripped apart on r/5nites but might as well:  “Freddy Fazbear’s sister location (possibly the location of FNAF)”  Cannot possibly be the location from FNAF, there is no crossover in time between the location in FNAF2 and FNAF1.  “Accident also makes the F/B/C/F costumes smelly from the blood and sweat.”  The accident in completely different suits?  How would this possibly make them smell rotten and ooze blood and mucous?  “1987:  Yellow suit incident gets Dayshift accused and fired.”  “1988:  Missing Children Incident where Purple Guy lures children in with Golden Freddy suit, changes into security outfit, and uses a knife or hook to maim all the children and rip Freddy’s head off. Purple Guy is caught and jailed.”  Five Nights 2 takes place in ’87, which is when the kids are killed.  I’m not sure what you think the “Yellow Suit incident” in ’87 is.  The place is closed down in ’87, it says in the paper clippings after the last night that Fritz worked.  Why would he change into a security outfit?  Where did he get it?  You’re falling into the assumption that there is only one purple person, when the evidence suggests otherwise.  So you’re left to have to try to rationalize and reach for them all being the same which leaves big problems. “Mike Schmidt – Not around for the yellow suit incident in FNAF 2 or the Missing Children Incident between FNAF 2 and FNAF. Clearly, the Purple Guy required access to the FNAF 2 location for both of those crimes” Mike Schmidt before FNAF is at most an unknown wild card.  You haven’t ruled him out.  Everyone has access to the FNAF2 location during the day when kids are around and there’s no history of Mike given to keep him away. “Dayshift guard – It’s doubtful that the minimum wage dayshift guard had the money to pay bail for allegedly murdering and/or molesting a minor, so he’d probably be in jail for years until his trial began. Even if he could pay bail, his keys, uniform, and badge would be taken away immediately, and, he would not be welcome near any school zone or playground much less Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza.” There’s no indication that he was ever even charged, let alone imprisoned.  So since the murders happened during the FNAF2 week, he would still be on location.  So he hasn’t been ruled out by your theory.  “He also knew the extreme hazards of spring lock animatronics, and possibly saw someone injured or killed by it; there’s no way he would have stepped into Golden Freddy, much less Springtrap.” You could also spin it this way:  Phone Guy had the knowledge to use the Springtrap suits properly, which is why he successfully used one once without being killed, Golden Freddy, and why he thought he’d be safe in the Springtrap suit in FNAF3.  It is conceivable either way, so it can’t rule him out.  What does is his death in FNAF1.  Other things:  How does he know the animatronics’ programming error? How does he know where a boarded up saferoom is in the FNAF1 location is, where he’s never been? How did he get in when it’s all boarded up?  Not like he had a back door key. If the killer was caught, why didn’t the papers mention it?  Why didn’t phone guy?  If the bite of 87 victim was still functional, why did phone guy only say he lived, rather than how remarkable it is he could still apparently function?  If phone guy knew the identity of the killer then why is it left such a mystery?  Wouldn’t that be a huge detail?  It’s very obvious that the identity of the killer is still unknown. Who then messed with the animatronics to make them more aggressive?  Your theory is more just rampant speculation without evidence or even logical necessities in their place.  It’s more like some fun fanfictioning since so much of it is based on nothing in the games."
GameTheorists,2z95w0,gamer52599,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:46:46 2015 UTC,My next question would be (assuming I am correct in thinking that the game is based in the half life universe based on the comments about Black Mesa) even if he did make it back to earth and survive the reentry/landing then what? He has nothing to interface with but the Combine. How ever it would be interesting to see them try and invade the lab seeing as what GLADoS is capable of. But going back to your question he technically is a highly advanced AI system so I'm sure you could figure out a way back home
GameTheorists,2z95w0,caboose001,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:56:23 2015 UTC,"is he an advance AI or just the product of the greatest minds of a generation working together to build the dumbest moron who ever exist.  since its the latter i'm going to go by that he might have something up his metaphorical sleeve. but he was specifically designed to make bad decisions. anything he may have will be mute if he ejects it.  so the only thing getting him home is that first burst from the air pressure that comes with the sudden pressure change caused by the moon portal and GLaDOS's smack that dislodged him from her maneframe. now i think by the smack he's in low lunar orbit... maybe, still don't have the exact numbers going to need more time to do that."
GameTheorists,2z95w0,LokiAlpha,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to note that both the Portal world and Tamriel (Skyrim) worlds are linked through an official addon in skyrim that placed a random cottage in the game.  As you approached the cottage, something from space fell and crashed into the cottage.  It turned out to be the lovable ""Spaaaaaace""-core.  Considering that Wheatley was in a similar pattern as the Space Core, I'd say it's impossible for him to have landed back on Portal's ""Earth"".  Either that or they entered some sort of wormhole that shot them back in time to the age of Skyrim / Tamriel and it's the same ""Earth"" as Portal's.  My guess is they either travelled back through time, or they were on a crash course for a different planet.

Consider that the characters using them are already partial beast/dragon form.  This means that they either have: Repressed or kept dormant the true forms of their power, or lost the power somehow.    The Stones could be a catalyst that unlocks/restores that power but in short bursts.  Just like how an adrenaline shot would boost strength in humans but it would wear off after some time.  This rapid burst in the beast/dragons could be what allows them to transform.    Where the stones come from and why there's a concentration of said energy could be totally up to debate.  My personal belief is that they're the remnants of past lives.  Both Yarne and Naga say something to the effect of ""I won't be the last of my race,"" or ""Let the fallen dragons be with me.""    I say this because in the ""Inheritance"" series there's something similar with how a dragon heart is formed, and that the energy within them is the fallen dragon. These could be what the dragon/beast stones are.  Fallen that have transformed the soul energy into a stone."

One of the comments gave this response supporting to your theory:   You're missing a huge piece of the puzzle. Kirby isn't in the real world. He lives in Dream Land, only reachable by real people when they are asleep. Samus is dreaming herself small.   When did she sleep you ask? When has she ever been shown to sleep?    Another piece of evidence supporting your claim: anti-Kirbys appeared in Link's Awakening, a Zelda game that took place in Link's dream.  ...On the other hand, there's an official reason for the name Dream Land. It's because King Dedede guards the Star Rod--the source of planet Pop Star's dreams--within his Kingdom."

GameTheorists,2yxsq7,Bealina,3,Fri Mar 13 18:55:48 2015 UTC,"Technically, every time your character dies in a game, you're in a ""new timeline"".  Imagine you're on the right course for your timeline to be accurate.  You're on your way to defeat Ganon.  However, you die along the way, and are reset to a previous point in your timeline.  The timeline you experienced doesn't just ""disappear"".  You experienced it.  You remember it.  You remember dying to that boss / enemy / etc.  That timeline exists.  However, that doesn't mean that timeline is important enough to mention.  It's not a significant timeline that matters in the overall story.  What I'm trying to get at is that the timeline that we've seen and acknowledged is significant.  The timeline that you are proposing is insignificant, and unnecessary.  Yes, that is a possible future in the OoT timeline.  Do you know what else is a possible future in the OoT timeline? Link not doing anything at all.  Timeline Z(or 4, or X, or whatever you want to call it): Link doesn't wake up no matter how much Navi shakes him.  He doesn't find the kokiri sword, he doesn't talk to the Deku tree, he doesn't do anything to become a hero.  He lives out his life as a kokiri child until evil forces come and kill him(or possibly destroy the forest, and that's when he find the kokiri sword and tries to thwart evil).  You can make any timeline ""significant"" by adding story elements to it.  Not saying your timeline theory is wrong, it's just when you're talking about multiple timelines, you enter the realm of infinite timelines.  Infinite possibilities that could lead to the same end result, infinite possibilities that could end to different end results.  Time travel itself opens the doors to so many paradoxes that trying to rationalize it leads to millions of theoretical possibilities.  There's no reason to try to rationalize time travel."
GameTheorists,2yxsq7,LokiAlpha,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:43:37 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting another canon time in which Link ""goes back in time"": when he returns to the past to teach Guru-Guru the Song of Storms and collects the Lens of Truth from the well.  And this event presents a really big problem for your theory. If Link is creating a new timeline every time he goes back in time, how did Guru-Guru learn the Song of Storms in the first place in order for Link to learn it? If Link isn't the person who taught the adult timeline's Guru-Guru the song, then who did? And if Link is the person who taught adult timeline Guru-Guru the song, that means Link didn't create a split when he went back in time.   That aside though, we know that Link creates two separate timelines when he defeats Ganon as an adult then stops him as a child.   I do agree that this is what Hyrule Historia says, but what about in-game evidence? How do we surmount the fact that TWW references the child timeline and TP references the adult timeline? How about the fact that if Link brought the Master Sword back in time with him at the end of OoT like Zelda said he should, the Master Sword shouldn't be able to exist in TWW? What about the fact that there's already another Link in the past when future Link is sent back in time; what happens to past Link while future Link is changing time since past Link is still trying to find the remaining Spiritual Stones per the Deku Tree's instructions?  Just some interesting things worth thinking about."

In Vinewood, Micheal is retired and Trevor and Franklin aren't from around the area, therefore they receive nearly identical treatment due to a lack of history with the area's police.  Out in the sticks, Trevor is an established criminal and murderer, while again, Micheal and Franklin aren't well known as criminals.  The last station is in an area that Franklin is known for being a trouble maker and even dabbling in gang violence.  As with the other areas, Micheal and Trevor aren't really known.  As you pointed out, Rockstar has an incredible attention to detail and realism.  Realistically, police are more likely to respond aggressively/violently to someone that has a violent history.  TL;DR Local reputation may be playing a large role in police response.

I know that I wasn't the only theorist to sit back and wonder how significant the results at the end of the video were. U/MichaeltheMagician makes a crucial point about the sample size:   Five trials, even though he did five trials for each scenario, is a pretty small test and, therefore, can be hard to generalize.   And he's absolutely right. The most common means of statistical analysis in most higher-level quantitative data analysis is, funnily enough, means testing. The most common being an Independent Sample's t-test or, in the case of multiple factors of interest (like in this video--concerning the treatment of three characters) ANOVA's.   These sorts of tests come loaded with a whole bunch of conditions for you to use them correctly. The most important for our case, is whether or not the distribution of ""engagement points"" (0 for nothing, 1 for noticing, 2 for aggressive response) is normal. Normal being another name for a Gaussian distribution or your good ol' standard bell curve. But the thing is that such a system wouldn't really work here because a) it's difficult for three options to distribute themselves as a bell; and b) because it's considered a pretty big no-no to run these kinds of tests when the sample size is under 30. Before then, you can very rarely be sure that the distribution is normal and that you could thus perform the tests.  So is there no way to test and potentially add evidence towards MattPat's theory? Believe it or not, there is.  It's called ""non-parametric"" testing. Basically, its the sort of testing we can do when we can't assume that the distribution is normal. One of these tests is called the ""Mann-Whitney U-Test""-- which seems particularly applicable here.   Why? Well, another issue I was personally mulling over while watching the video was how the engagements were scaled. MattPat did a great job at trying to operationalize a difficult concept-- but can we really justify that full on murder is one point more than a mere notice? Especially when said notice is the same distance from no interactions at all? It's clear that these concepts are ordinal-- they can clearly be ranked from least to most aggressive-- but I'm not sure if we can make a convincing interval out of them.   The great thing with the Mann-Whitney U-Test is that it's core principal is based off of ranking something. I won't go into the details because it lengthens this post by quite a bit-- but the point is that it's especially good at handling ordinal level data like the numbers we have.   So can we do this test? I think so, but I did make one crucial assumption: AI cops may act differently regarding people and cars but they do not act differently depending on their location. Despite the pattern that seems to appear in the video, we simply cannot assert that the AI act differently depending on their location. Unless my Google-fu has failed me, I cannot find a single credible source that insists that the cops act differently depending on where they are. (The other assumption, that they act differently when engaged by a vehicle as opposed to a person, is one that isn't taken in the video where the points from both conditions are weighted equally. For the sake of completeness, I also ran the tests that made this assumption).   Before we go on, there's a really important concept called statistical significance. A lot of people confuse what it means, but here's all you need to know: Significance does not exactly mean how certain you are of a fact. When someone says that they are 95% sure of a conclusion because their test spat out something with 5% significance, you can be 100% certain that they're oversimplifying it. What it actually means is that there is only a 5% chance that a result as or more extreme would be spat out due to random chance given that the null hypothesis (the idea that there is no real difference between the groups) is true. So if you got a result with a significance of 5%, what it's saying is that if the fact that there is no difference between groups were true, you would only get something like this 5% of the time. Some people sit back and say ""wow, only 5% of the time? Then it's pretty unlikely that the null hypothesis is true because 5% is fairly unlikely."" Where people draw the line, when we start to call things ""significant"" is determined by how comfortable you and your field is with this chance. The standard in political science tends to be that 5% mark. However! Experimental psychology (which is also part of my purview-- I study political psychology and behavior) will often use 10% since the sample sizes are much smaller. Since the latter seems to best fit our considerations, we'll use that here.  Now then! The moment we've all been waiting for. Sweet, sweet results.   The first thing I did was figure out if there were statistically significant differences between the groups when they approached the officer on foot. And here, I came into a problem. I noticed that MattPat didn't tell us the distribution of Trevor's on-foot score in the last run. All we can deduce is that he scored the same as Franklin on foot: 7. With five runs, there are only two sets that could arrive at this sum {0,1,2,2,2} or {1,1,1,2,2}. Since violent noticing is consistently less prevalent then sheer glances, I assumed the latter was the case. When you plug that in, you find that the significance value is 17% between Trevor and Franklin on foot. Fortunately, Michael and Franklin on foot didn't require any assumptions. Unfortunately, it was 25% significant. (For the record, the difference between Michael and Trevor was significant: 5%. So, you could, in theory, dismiss the hypothesis that Michael and Trevor are treated equally and conclude that Trevor is treated worse than Michael).  How about when they are in the car? For the most part for any of the characters, they get away without any incident. But at the end, Franklin seemed to really get hit hard. Does this impact the test? Not really. There is a 35% significance value between Trevor and Franklin and a 17% value between Michael and Franklin. This time, the difference between Trevor and Michael are also not statistically significant (26%).   These numbers offer an interesting story. But, it's not the same assumption used in the video: let's run through the comparisons with the same car&person assumption in the video.   Michael V Franklin: 13% Franklin V Trevor: 38% Trevor V Michael: 7%  Again, the only relationship that bears any statistical significance is Trevor and Michael. So maybe there's something in the code that has it so that the police will be more attentive towards Trevor compared to Michael. Or, perhaps, there were some slight, subtle differences in the way the two characters were played over the course of that insane 20 hour marathon of testing.   To be clear, I'm not here to bash MattPat and say ""Oh you were wrong, hur dur derrr."" Quite the contrary! I made this comment because of the immense amount of respect I have for him as both a theorist and as someone who hopes to inspire people like he does someday. Plus, he admits in the video that this could be nothing more than chance-- and the ending lesson is pretty great in and of itself. I just thought it would be interesting if some numbers were crunched in a way that could provide a little more conclusive evidence regarding the potential randomness."
GameTheorists,2ytk1b,awildpoliticalnerd,4,Fri Mar 13 03:20:18 2015 UTC,I think everyone is overlooking 1 major variable:  how much dialogue does each character have that can lead to violent behavior? or does it have any effect at all what the characters say? - i would love to see the recorded footage to analyze that
GameTheorists,2ytk1b,CraftyDrac,1 point,Fri Mar 13 13:39:23 2015 UTC,"Spot on! That's definitely a possible variable in the whole deal. If we wanted to really analyze and estimate its effects though, we'd probably have to run a multivariable regression. Which we could do, but it'd be better if we had more data. I think someone mentioned somewhere in the thread the idea of doing a community experiment. If that happened I'd be totally down for running the tests needed to test yours, mine, and everyone's assumptions."

But i think they are protecting the player (a ten years old child) about information about reproduction.

The egg is created by shared power from each parent pokemon, causing it to be manifested by the bond of friendship between the two.

Its cool to see that other people think about it the same way."
GameTheorists,2yly8m,DanielisAwesome52,2,Wed Mar 11 04:55:00 2015 UTC,"If we assume that all Pokemon (who aren't gender specific and can breed) produce eggs then it's a matter of saying ""How"" not ""where"".  We know where the eggs came from, but HOW did they get there.  Ever breed two spectral type Pokemon (Gastly, Duskull, etc).  They're spectral, they have no way of physical interaction aside from passing through each other.  Yet SOMEHOW they can produce an egg with a Pokemon inside it.    My theory (and yes, theory/opinion) is that ""eggs"" are merely the same type of containment that Pokeballs are.  If we break it down to the fact that Pokemon can be transformed into data (via those red lasers) and housed into a Pokeball; what's to say that inside the eggs is the data for a specific Pokemon.  Ever wonder why when a Pokemon hatches they give you a pokeball (as seen in the anime) to contain it in?  Because if not contained right away the code is re-written to be ""wild"" instead of owned.  Another thing to consider is Pokemon that cannot breed, or have special conditions for breeding.  If we think about it as code or date these Pokemon have either ""Perfect"" coding (which means there's no way it can be duplicated or changed) and Imperfect Coding (which can be influenced by items and breed conditions).  All legendary Pokemon cannot be duplicated through breeding, yet (if we consider Generation 1 and 2 mechanics) they can be DIGITALLY duplicated.  This is while they are data, inside a data containment unit.  However leaving a Zapdos and a Ditto in the daycare doesn't make an egg.    As for the Imperfect data, they're influenced by the change in code while in the ""breeding"" process.  When they make an egg the changed code is stored in the egg (unit) and thus when it hatches and becomes physical, it's different than the parent.  For instance a Snorlax with the Lax incense.    Now there's one special case that I want to touch on and that's the Manaphy/Phione egg breeding.  For some reason this (as far as I know) is the only instance where no special item or condition needs to be met to elicit a new Pokemon species.  Perhaps this follows the idea of the Mew/Mewtwo and the ""Born"".  You can leave a Manaphy in the daycare and a while later it produces an egg with Phione in it.  This means it's a non-Legendary, but still produces eggs similar to Mew's birthing (as explained in the Cinnabar Island journals).  However unlike Mew, this is a process that can be repeated over and over, thus making Manaphy a Pokemon with Imperfect Code.   But that's just my theory, a Pokemon Theory.  Edit: I realize that creating a new species is a vague term.  What I meant to say is that the Phione/Mewtwo offspring is a non-evolving, no family type species.  ie: The offspring cannot evolve into the parent by any means.  They are two separate entities (or Pokemon family lines)"
GameTheorists,2yly8m,Empolo,1 point,Wed Mar 11 00:49:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, a man in Coumarine City said something like that, stating that ""... they're not eggs. They're more like a Pokemon cradle."""
GameTheorists,2yly8m,MCBlastoise,2,Sat Apr 25 21:14:04 2015 UTC,"The Mew giving birth thing was never a direct ""Mewtwo came biologically from Mew's body"" (nicest way I could think to put that) but rather Mewtwo itself wasn't like a test tube baby, but a regular natural Pokemon that was then genetically engineered into what we know as Mewtwo.   I believe there are three Anime instances talking about Mewtwo's birth/creation and surprisingly for the anime they're consistent with eachother (until the Second Mewtwo and its Y-Mega came into play) I think it was Birth/Origin of Mewtwo (Radio Drama then Anime OVA adaptation) where they talk about the Baby Mewtwo (who looks alot like Mew but with the modified tail and brain stem) Which means he started as a Mew, however they accomplished that, maybe the Anime understand the mechanics of Eggs better and were able to force produce, or genetically engineer a method to force Mew to create an egg of itself. I mean we've made ""clones"" before and they are birthed and incubated just like regular animals/embryos so maybe cloned Pokemon are formed in eggs like every other Pokemon, and ""birth"" was just the best fit term for the journal."

GameTheorists,2yly8m,benjicaking,1 point,Wed Mar 11 12:53:24 2015 UTC,"Here's where pokemon eggs come from: the real world. The world of pokemon is, in fact, a computer simulation like the matrix. Things such as the PC make sense if pokemon are a simulation. They are placed into balls as information, then put into a computer with many other pieces of information. The instant healing pokemon centres make sense if the pokemon are thought of as information files that nurse Joy can edit, changing hp and pp values to maximum. Shiny pokemon have certain pieces of informaton that makes them shiny. The four move limit is due to storage space on the file, meaning that only four moves can be stored. The pp limit on a move is also due to storage size, as bigger and more powerful moves have lower pp. The pokemon eggs are being put there as new creatures are placed into the simulation. How else do piles of liquid sludge and haunted candlesticks have children? And breeding is full of more things that support this theory. Ditto copying its partner is just copy pasting files. Egg moves are data being carried over. And a shiny pokemon is more likely if the parents are shiny or if they are from different regions. The ""glitch"" that causes shininess occurs more commonly when there is a translation error or if the glitch has already occurred."

The Fans don't start murdering people until they dress up and enter a mindset that they are someone new. The Actor always wanted to murder but didn't have the courage until he adopted the personality of the butcher. (I can't remember if that's what the character's name was, I'm just assuming)  There are characters who have someone legitimate reasons to kill. Beard is a soldier, The Son is a criminal, the henchman is a criminal, Manny Pardo is a serial killer, ect. Everyone else needs to hide themselves from who they really are."

This is only natural when you consider that not everyone CAN be invested in a debate, but it should feel like it. It was more an exchange of a volume of information, sometimes semi-random information, rather than them creating a compelling case that centralized around a few contentions that they tied back in.  There are elements of the dramatic flair and less structured debate to the point where I think they'll bounce back okay, but I was watching the whole thing thinking that this was going to be like Phoenix Wright more than anything, but while it got close, it never quite got a decent flow going."

All said and done, they really shouldn't have gone straight to the copyright strike in the first place. It's rather immature. They really should have just asked TGT to change it or talk to them about it before hand instead of making an issue out of it like this. Given the kind of people TGT are, I'm sure it wouldn't have been an issue and it would have been solved without any negativity on either side.  If I owned a channel, I wouldn't issue a copyright strike as a first move, especially against a bigger channel, because I'm aware that it's possible that it could result in negative backlash.

Having the multiple towers and worlds could also be  an allegory for the islands that america captured, going from island to island until they were close enough to bomb Japan. The cannons to skip worlds could be actual cannons, destroying the AA guns and letting Mario skip past the islands. The Boss fights ending by a drop into lava also relates to the island. On many islands, rather than being captured by the americans the Japanese would launch themselves off cliffs into the sea below (like bowser falling from the bridge into the lava during the fights, or the Koopa Kids on the platform in the lava falling into the lava). And the Koopa Kids represent the youth, who would all give up their lives for their country. The bullet bills that cover the screen and explode can also be seen as Kamikaze pilots, giving their lives to try and sink the american aircraft carriers.  And in the RPG games Bowser is upset that someone other than him took Peach. To him, he is the only one allowed to kidnap her, and teams up with Mario to take down the newcomer who tried to kidnap Peach."

TWW actually includes a story that you can find with the help of the Tingle Tuner that explains why TWW Tingle exists. Apparently TWW Tingle heard about the legend of how MM Tingle helped the Hero of Time by making maps for him, so TWW Tingle decided to dress up as this legendary Tingle himself.  In other words, just like Malon, Talon, Ingo, the oracles, Anju, Carlov, Dampe, Syrup, etc., etc. Tingle is just another one of the many NPCs that reincarnate.

GameTheorists,2y1b47,Mathaeuz,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:43:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, there is some merit to the thought of Spring-trap being used to kill the kids.  Think about the fact he got into the suit at all, and only THEN the kids stop following him.  Add to this that he laughs at them once he is in the suit.  Why would someone think a suit where even touching one apparently easy to touch lever could kill you would keep you safe from 5 ghosts?  It wouldn't make any sense unless these ghosts were scared of the suit.  The only reason I can think of for them being scared of this suit is if they were killed by it.  On top of this, he never directly said the suit used in the killings was a golden Freddy one, just a yellow one.  In my opinion, all this evidence just points to Spring-Trap being the suit used rather than the Golden Freddy one.  On to Phone Guy being Purple Guy.  I may be overlooking something, but it would be impossible from everything I've looked at.  Purple Guy would have to have died on Night 4 or before, because of them being recordings.  I only say this because Phone guy died on or before Night 4 of FNAF.  And because those animatronics are still going after Night 4, I think it would be easy to say he isn't the Purple Guy.  So who could be Purple Guy be then?  We actually may not have a name for the guy yet.  I actually feel we don't have a name for him yet."

GameTheorists,2xv8dy,Truthsmirror,8,Wed Mar 4 03:25:20 2015 UTC,"I feel the mini-games in FnaF3 is happening after the first game's location closed. The doors are bordered up, there are rats along the floor, the place is in shambles, and there seems to be water coming in from the roof.  The purple man came back to disassemble the remaining evidence that was left of his murderous spree. As he did, the spirits actually came out of the suits and attacked him (or at least scared him) into killing himself. The whole thing is ""how he always comes back"". He was there during the dinner, then the pizzerias. Then during this new Fazbears, he is still here.   I also don't feel there are multiple ""purple men"". Just the one Purple guy. He had a long history with the company however. He knows about the secret room.  It just proves that the purple guy is not the phone guy. That or he managed to somehow escape from the animations in the first game."
GameTheorists,2xv8dy,XinSon,3,Wed Mar 4 05:31:21 2015 UTC,"While the mini games almost certainly take place after FNaF 1, keep in mind that the place was already falling apart by the time you got there, meaning the mini games aren't necessarily taking place too long after the game.  As far as the whole getting rid of evidence part, who's to say Mike wasn't just doing what he felt was right: taking apart the animatronics because they were obviously extremely dangerous.  Also, because the animatronics only see one sprite for every child (wearing a green-striped sweater), I think the purple coloration is used to identify predators, but as their AI's were messed with in the 2nd game, they see every adult as a predator."

GameTheorists,2xv8dy,GreenWarrior7,1 point,Thu Mar 5 07:45:00 2015 UTC,"If you've played some of the hidden minigames in FNAF3 you'll notice a Golden Freddy, fatter and shorter than the present Freddy. He is alongside Springtrap, the main antagonist in the game. Except, this takes place in the first diner (Because of the small space). So, we can assume that Golden Freddy and Springtrap are the OG Fazbear Crew. This, in turn, means that, they were fans of Freddy Fazbear, and grew up to guard another place, to relive memories. Is it just me or did I just make another theory?"
GameTheorists,2xv8dy,GreenWarrior7,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:59:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that we can entirely prove it one way or another, but here is some interesting things I've noticed. In the final mini-game ending, the a purple man is getting into Springtraps suite to avoid the crying child. The problem with that is the mini-games of FNAF 3 set in a run down version of the restaurant. Which of the 3 restaurants it is hard to determine which restaurant it is, but it is in fact the first restaurant (pre-FNAF 2 restaurant according to the MatPat's time-line) (see below explained). MatPat theorized in his 2nd FNAF video that the crying child is in fact The Marionette, and phone guy says in a call in FNAF 2 night 2 ""I'll be honest, I never liked that puppet thing"". This matches purple guy's fear or the crying child to the point of forcing him into the Springtrap suit.  During FNAF 3, on night 2 the old phone call that is listen to says ""we have 2 specially designed suits that double as both animatronics and suits."" This aligns with the Golden Freddy/ Springtrap mini-game where the player controls Golden Freddy and brings a child cake. This proves that both Springtrap and Golden Freddy could have been used as suits, and that either could have been the suit that the killer originally used to lure the children. FNAF 3, Night 5, the phone guy explains that the security room is not a break room and that a customer should NEVER be taken out of the show area. Phone guy explains to any employee that nobody should be in that room, that their are no camera's in that room and that the animatronics would not know this room exist. He also mentions that the Sringtrap suit is defective. He states that ""management has also been made aware that the spring bonny (Springtrap) animatronic has been noticeably moved."" in FNAF 3 night 5. This may prove that this was the suit bring used to lure the children into the back room, and would also explain why the souls of the chilren are not put to rest until the suit is destroyed (explained later on). Springtrap being defective also explains why it would be in the security room for the purple man of FNAF 3 to get into. We have access to the security room in FNAF 1, so that should knock this out as not possible right? Not really. In FNAF 3 night 6 phone guys informs you that ""due to budget restriction, the previously mentioned safe rooms are being sealed at most locations [...] that this room not be mentioned to family, friends, or insurance representatives."" Something was discovered to have happened in the safe room that would warrant insurance reps to show up and ask about it. If the children were in fact killed in the safe room of the 1st major restaurant (pre-FNAF 2) then it would explain why the insurance reps showed up (parents probably bringing the restaurant to court) and why the new safe room DOES have a camera in it during FNAF 1 (the latest of the restaurants in the timeline). If the calls from FNAF 3 actually took place during the first (pre FNAF-2) restaurant then that could explain why only the Springtrap animatronic is in the room for the purple man of FNAF 3 to find, since the rundown restaurant from the mini-games is IN FACT the first (pre FNAF 2) restaurant, and the room we see the purple man die in is the security room where the Springtrap suit/animatronic was walled in. The older animatronics are taken apart ourside this room, probably because the killer wishes to relieve the moment of the kills so he brought back the animatronics to the original store, and along with them the souls of the children.  FNAF 3 has 2 different endings, a ""good ending"" and a ""bad ending"". In the bad ending you can see the animatronic heads of the 4 main robots along with another in the background. Each head has a light bulb in the head that is on. The good ending has the same image as the bad one with the exception of the lack of 5th head in the background and the lights being on in the heads. In order to get the good ending, you need to beat nightmare (Night 6) and then about 6-7 or so mini-games in the normal story of FNAF 3. Briefly, in most these mini-games you play as an animatronic doing a certain task. Hidden in the levels however, there is a crying child. If you bring that  crying child a cake, then he can be found later in another mini game in the 3rd frame to the right. I'm not going to go in very much more detail than that, you can look up videos of all the mini-games and their secrets on youtube. But essential you are gathering the dead children together in one place and ""throwing them a party"". Sound familiar? Like all the animatronics being brought back to the original restaurant piece by piece and then being layed out in front of the security room? But for that I have little more than speculation. But once you have gotten all of the children to their ""mini-game party"" and then complete the game, the ending scene is a ""good ending"". It is in fact the same as the bad ending, except all the lights from the animatronic heads are off and the head in the bacground is not visible. The idea here is that in night 6 you learn that the attraction that you are working in during FNAF 3 burns down and only a few objects survived. If you saved the souls of the children and THEN the suit was burnt then you get the good ending where the children's souls are set free. If not they remain stuck in the animatrics. All in all it seems like purple guy and phone guy could be the same person all the way through or they can change, but I can't really know for sure.   But these are all merely theories and speculation loosely based on some evidence from the game, and I'm sure there are many holes that can be poked in what I've said. And if you a hole by all means point it out, I would love to look at it, find evidence that either proves or disproves it and modify the idea. Also sorry for the terrible grammar and spelling."
GameTheorists,2xv8dy,Mathaeuz,1 point,Thu Mar 5 07:59:59 2015 UTC,"I would have to argue against the idea of the mini games taking place at the very first Fazbear's Pizza for a few reasons. First, the layout of the restaurant the mini games take place in is identical to the restaurant from the first game.   As far as the state of the restaurant goes, although it is mentioned that the first location was ""left to rot"" the restaurant you play in in FNaF 1 isn't exactly brand-new.   There is also no security in the first game in a ""safe room"", which makes sense, since you are told the room does not appear on any digital maps.  Finally, in the 3rd game, you need only complete Nightmare, then play Night 5 again to get the good ending. In other words, you only have to find out that the attraction (and by extension, every remaining thing keeping the children's spirits attached) was destroyed to set them free.  (Your grammar and spelling aren't as bad as you think they are, either.)"
GameTheorists,2xv8dy,Mathaeuz,2,Thu Mar 5 08:18:23 2015 UTC,"I did not know that the layout of the mini-games is the same as the FNAF 1 restaurant. So if that's the case then we would need to figure out if in fact the mini-game restaurant is the FNAF 1 restaurant during FNAF 1 or after. If they are set during the first game then this along with phone guy's call on night 4 of FNAF 1, where he says ""Maybe sometime, uh, you could check inside those suits in the back room? bang bang I'm gonna to try to hold out until someone checks."" could indicate that the purple guy from FNAF 3 is phone guy, since phone guy is implying that he is going to try and hide in a suit. Also when you are fired in FNAF 1 it says ""Tampering with the animatronics."" If in fact phone guy is the purple man from the FNAF 3 mini-games, then he would have tampered with the animatronics to hide any evidence of his crimes and then died. This would have left the company to blame you for the tampering of the animatronics since you are the only one who is still around.   Also you are right about the good ending only needing the completion of Nightmare mode. I was thinking about a good ending with 3 star completion requires the bonus mini-games to achieve. Those mini-games, again, have you ""help the crying children"" by bringing them cake and getting to come together at a party. If you go to the party after gathering all the children, you will see the original crying child, and all the others are wearing masks that represent the original 4 animatronic. After this all 5 children fade out and vanish leaving only the masks of the animatronics, similar to the end screen for the good ending. So maybe the 3 star good ending gives more detail as to how the children find peace after the destruction of Springtrap and the rest of the attraction. I think that the destruction of Springtrap, and therefore the last remnant of the killer, is important based on the creators views of the world. Having created many Christian games, Scott's views on ghost may be one of 'They are still here because they have unfinished business and can't move on from this world until they find peace' which is the common ghost 'explanation'. So if the purple guy from FNAF 3 who dies and takes over the Springtrap suit is ALSO the killer, then that would explain why the children are not at peace until after the suit is destroyed.   FNAF 2's purple man is the one I have the most difficulty identifying. The original post makes a good point of making it seem like phone guy is not the purple man in at least FNAF 2. The rare occurrence of the purple man chasing you it the only time the purple man looks different, having a badge and holding a 'phone'. Since this is the only time when the purple man looks different than in all the other mini-games, it would make sense that it is NOT the killer but someone else. I think that purple guy from that rare save them mini-game is like you said Jeremy Fitzgerald attempting to stop the animatronics from attacking anyone. Night 5 of FNAF 2, phone guy said ""when we get it all sorted out, we may move you to the day shift, a position just became... available."" If phone guy was in fact the purple man for most of the mini-games in the FNAF series, and he was filling in any shift needed, then it would explain why the purple man is watching foxy during the day shift, and all the other similarities between phone guy and the purple man throughout the series. So it's very likely that for a majority of the games the purple man is the killer, but in a few rare occurrences the purple man is not the killer, leading to multiple purple men."

GameTheorists,2xr5xs,MistaDawg1101,2,Wed Mar 4 00:23:47 2015 UTC,"Although, if you get the bad ending- it shows and proves that purple guy is in fact Springtrap. He gets inside the suit to hide, but the springs malfunction, leaving him trapped inside."
GameTheorists,2xr5xs,MrArcanine,2,Tue Mar 3 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"Phone Guy CAN NOT BE Spring Trap, that is, purple guy/the murderer. Purple Guy died inside of Spring Trap after he disassembled the 4 main animatronics. Furthermore, we know that at the time of his death, the animatronics still are disassembled. However, phone guy died before Night 5 of FNaF 1, at which time these animatronics clearly weren't disassembled.   It can't be the other way round, either. If the disassembling of the animatronics by the purple guy is what causes the condition of the animatronics in FNaF 2, that'd mean he'd be dead before the events of FNaF 1, thus meaning that the purple guy couldn't be phone guy. Also, the messages can't be prerecorded from before the events of FNaF 2, because of informations the phone guy gives us. It's just one big contradiction, thus disproving this theory."

GameTheorists,2xrrew,JohnnyFireFlame,2,Tue Mar 3 09:09:53 2015 UTC,"FNaF3 is supposed to take place ""Thirty years after Freddy Fazbear's Pizza closed its doors"" (likely a reference to the ""Bite of '87"", putting this game in 2017).  MatPat already figured out that FNaF1 takes place in the early '90s (due to a number of factors, including the minimum wage for those years) and FNaF2 takes place in the late '80s (both by the minimum wage, and the date on the check).  This alone suggests that the restaurant has not had any living person in it for at least 20 years before FNaF3 takes place, if it is still standing.  However, the simple fact is that FNaF3 takes place in a carnival/theme park attraction designed to use the legends of what happened in Freddy Fazbear's Pizza to drive ticket sales, including making everything seem like it was falling apart (to the point where most of the stuff actually is barely functioning properly)."

The uncertainty principle requires every physical system to have a zero-point energy greater than the minimum of its classical potential well. This results in motion even at absolute zero.

Yes, most say he is a myth and not in the game, and I agree with that, but that doesn't mean that Herobrine isn't there. Text could still be reflected on maybe a spirit or something of that nature.  2) Herobrine is the closest thing to The Player. Herobrine is undoubtedly the most similar to The Player. Pretty much same texture minus the white eyes. He is said to be The Player's dead brother, but Herobrine is grown up, so Steve and Herobrine must of had some form of connection. Thus explaining some of the dialogue.   3) Mojang acknowledges Herobrine's existence.  Herobrine is put in posters, dolls, and shirts by Mojang. They know that he is there.

GameTheorists,2xk8oi,VolkswagenBeatle,39,Sun Mar 1 14:25:18 2015 UTC,Counter-question: Is it really click-bait when he actually delivers on what the titles are?
GameTheorists,2xk8oi,DigRatChild,-2,Sun Mar 1 17:07:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is still clickbait. However, it is not the bad kind that just says ""sensationalism"" and proceeds to say something obvious, unintersting and redundant. Matpat's titles may be clickbaity but the content justifies the titles."
GameTheorists,2xk8oi,kratus778,7,Mon Mar 2 02:30:46 2015 UTC,"That's not click-bait.  ""Bait"" insinuates a false security.  You attach bait to the end of your fishing line to catch unsuspecting fish, and then eat the fish, when all the fish was really looking for was food.  Matpat is handing out fish food with no hooks or strings attached.  That's not ""bait"".  That's food."
GameTheorists,2xk8oi,LokiAlpha,8,Mon Mar 2 09:40:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, you're right, I didn't think of it that way. As long as the video delivers on what the title is promising it's not bait. I take back my previous comment."
GameTheorists,2xk8oi,kratus778,9,Mon Mar 2 15:09:41 2015 UTC,"While I do agree that the titles can click-bait, it really is necessary now considering there are thousands of other channels competing for views with him.

GameTheorists,2xk8oi,Taximadish,2,Sun Mar 1 20:53:53 2015 UTC,Part of the problem is I don't think you can put Italics or bolded text in youtube video titles. BLOCK CAPS then becomes pretty much the only method available to put emphasis on a word.

Also you have to remember that Matpat does stuff like this for other youtube videos as a JOB. He knows what works and what doesn't. He knows whats more effective at bringing in the viewers. Not everything he does is going to be for the loyal theorists. He wants to expand his reach so that more people start tuning in week after week.   Also to note is that like Meaquide said, you only used 2 examples,  which by the way, aren't the last 2 he created. They are 2 out of the last 4 videos he created. I would say out of the last 8 or so videos, only 2 or 3 of them feel like click bait in any way, but I feel as though they satisfy through the content.  If you have a theory, bring more information. This is just my counter argument towards it."

After Google did the Hummingbird update, they specifically targeted questions because they found that that's what people type the most; for instance, ""In Binding of Isaac, does Isaac die?"" and since he's not doing a walk-through or review, but theorizing and answering a question, he's more likely to satisfy organic searchers.

I hate having to collect thousands of completely arbitrary items just to watch only their values have anything to do with the game's progression and barely ever the items themselves. But am I going to knock the games for it? No, I can't, the games are great. I just hate the ""collectathon"" aspect of them, but the game's built around it so I can't say shit.

And why would there be a beat up shed in heaven?  Hey, look what I found when trying to find a picture of the wheat field?  http://steamcommunity.com/app/620/discussions/0/828925849354378146/  Apparently this theory has been around."
GameTheorists,2xhei9,caboose001,1 point,Sun Mar 1 15:32:43 2015 UTC,There was also that one other floor that opened up to the 3 turrets that shot puffs of air at her. What if they didn't? What if they killed her but her spirit remember it as them not shooting her to give her some peace and then he rises up to hear the fat lady sing and then see the field (I'm still kinda leaning towards wheat on that one) the mind does strange things like when it tries to make sense out of things it can't recognize or that is unfamiliar to it.  So her moving further along in that elevator and seeing those turrets shoot air at here could all e her mind/spirit trying to make sense of what happened to her.  IMO I don't think GLADoS would release her that easily. From what we have been shown in both games she loves texting due to her programming and would do anything to keep testing and a prime example of that would be the coop story in Portal 2 and her reaction in the end. So for all we know that elevator was a test to see what happens to the mind if the body is killed or something like that

GameTheorists,2xh0dm,spearmaniac,2,Sat Feb 28 16:42:21 2015 UTC,"Goron Link can punch cylindrical ice with cylindrical rocks on top of it, putting his striking force from what I calculated well above 1,000 metric tons. Goron Link is also more durable with his rock-like exterior and faster when rolling, even below his peak speed. At peak speed, Goron Link produces spikes, which we know TP Link never stopped when those Gorons rolled towards him. Add Chateau Milk and Goron Link is a force to be reckoned with."
GameTheorists,2xh0dm,meaquidemsententia,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:52:46 2015 UTC,"Good points, but as I pointed out, TP bested numerous Gorons, including an armored guard much larger than Goron Link. Even with the lowly Ordon sword, TP was able to hurt Gorons despite their rock-like skin. TP also handles direct punches from Goron guards with his shield up - so it is reasonable that he could handle Goron Link's attack. Goron Link is slow - once again giving the advantage to TP who could dance around him like he does to a Dark Nut. Sure he is fast in his rolling form, but he is not maneuverable. His inability to change direction quickly at speed is exactly why Majora's rolling puzzles are hard. So unless they are fighting in a very long, narrow hallway, TP will have no trouble dodging. There is also the issue of limited magic, and the possibility that with Midna's help, TP could handle Goron Link just as he did Ganon's beast form.  So while Goron Link may be stronger than I gave him credit for, I still give a slight advantage to TP on this one."
GameTheorists,2xh0dm,meaquidemsententia,1 point,Sun Mar 1 00:18:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, TP bested Dangoro, but his roll attack is so telegraphed that TP has time to put on iron boots and grab Dangoro to redirect the momentum. Goron Link is different in that while he will be familiar with Gorons rolling his way, what TP will fail to respond to are the protruding spikes that suddenly appear. So we know TP's response to Gorons and that is he won't be trying to avoid them.  The Ordon sword merely stunned Gorons. It didn't harm them. Also, why assume the punch of a Goron is on the same level as that of Goron Link's? Clearly there is a difference in striking strength. Another thing, Midna is her own person. She would be outside help. This is TP versus Goron Link, not TP and Midna."
GameTheorists,2xh0dm,meaquidemsententia,1 point,Sun Mar 1 00:57:15 2015 UTC,"Alright, lets go all the way down the rabbit hole. A master of melee combat like TP will never try to grab a rolling goron with spikes sticking out all over. He'll dodge like he does all the other charging enemies he's encountered.  Even if goron Link has 10 times the punch strength of a normal goron, he is too slow to land any punches - especially since that is so far outside of YL's normal fighting techniques. All the Links are dance and strike fighters, not stand and punch ones. YL will be out of his comfort zone, and TP will be smack in the middle of his. Then we come to the clawshot. Unlike the hookshot, it is capable of removing items from an opponents body, and we see TP use it masterfully to do just that. The first time he sees YL put on a mask, he'll know how to take it off - so any mask that causes him trouble would be gone in short order.  As for Midna, she is a part of TP's arsenal and I don't think it would be right to exclude her. But if you do, then you have to exclude Navi and Tatl as well, since they are their own persons as well. YL will fair much worse for that loss. TP relies on Midna very little - just for the wolf grapple, finding footholds for leaping onto, and targeting for the wolf AOE attack. His melee combat and ranged attacks do not rely on her at all. YL on the other hand, relies heavily on his fairy for target acquisition, melee combat, and ranged weapon aiming. Take away his fairy, and YL starts to quickly drop in the rankings. Sorry, TP still has this one."
GameTheorists,2xh0dm,meaquidemsententia,1 point,Mon Mar 2 04:31:11 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point. To TP, it will appear as if Goron Link is rolling his way and having done so in his previous battles with Gorons, he'll assume the same is going to happen here. So his initial reaction will be, ""I'll stand here with my iron boots on, position myself and deflect this Goron."" It's not until the spikes appear that TP is going to realize he's made an error, which will result in his death.  TP, like most Link incarnations, will be able to fire arrows. Chances are, these won't do anything to a Goron. Bomb arrows will be a different story if this is what TP thinks will work. The only problem is that unless Link is like Lars Andersen, he won't be able to keep up with the Goron's speed.  I don't see how the clawshot will remove Link's mask. Really? As for losing out Tatl, so what? The fact is, even if you accept this game mechanic, it still demonstrates that YL can accurately hit his targets. He's not trying to hit Tatl, after all. I don't care for Fierce Deity, but considering how powerful those magic discs are, TP isn't winning."
GameTheorists,2xh0dm,DigRatChild,1 point,Mon Mar 2 05:54:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying YL will be unable to use ranged weapons - it will just take him much longer to aim, a limitation TP does not have. A prime example is when Navi is unable to help during OoT's Ganon fight. Aiming is much more difficult and slow. The masks are removed simply by pulling on them - I see no reason why the clawshot wouldn't be able to grab and pull them off. The fierce deity's discs are just another magic attack that is easily blocked with the hylian shield or reflected back by the master sword - particularly since the fierce deity's power is rooted in evil - something the master sword excels at returning to sender.  The real problem is that we have reduced YL to a one trick pony. He has one effective attack - and that one requires a good 100 yard run up or several seconds of standing spin before it can do damage. Talk about telegraphing your moves. TP could tell the difference between that and a normal goron rolling along at a steady pace, and at long range, yes he could lob a bomb arrow as YL was starting up. Plus the spike roll requires the element of surprise - once TP has seen the attack once, it is basically useless and YL has nothing effective to fall back on.   Time to accept it, TP wins in a duel 9 times out of 10, and he does on his own what the hero of time could not do with the help of all the seven sages - fight Ganon one on one and extinguish the power that allowed Ganon to keep resurrecting."

When the flash runs many times faster than the speed of sound and punches someone, his entire skeleton should shatter from the impact, but since it doesn't we can clearly see that he is probably incredibly strong.

Serris is unaffected by Samus' beams and missiles when speed boosting, but when Samus smashes into walls, the energy field around her cancels. So, it could be that."

Though I think the X definitely can reproduce the way they do, because you can clear a room multiple times, and they just keep coming back. I would assume they would eventually run out of originals, so they must be able to do that.  So, as with all theories, it needs to be able to withstand opposition.   I WILL FIGHT YOU.  Keep in mind that even though there were 10 SA-X's, some sectors are rather large. Not to mention there are many hidden areas, so the SA-X's might have been exploring those hidden areas before you even knew about them.  Also, regarding why the X didn't just make more of the Bosses. I'm assuming this is because they take to many X to make (it takes 2 just to make a big spiky fish...), and why make more when Samus just eradicated them easily? Where as with the SA-X, the X know about the metroid's vulnerability to cold, and they could have easily heard Adam saying that Samus was to weak to face it, so they decided it was worth the extra X to make more of them!  These X are almost scarily smart, it seems looking at it this way...."
GameTheorists,2x4xxe,Elusive2000,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:14:21 2015 UTC,"It could just be a room reset, which is common in most Metroid games. In the Metroid Prime trilogy, Samus has to pass through two rooms to reset it.  The Restricted Area was unexplored. Adam only opens one type of hatxh and instructs Samus to unlock the rest under his discretion. The red hatches were Samus' own doing. In order to get to the Restricted Area, she needs to have the wave beam.  I disagree that it might take multiple X parasites to make the bosses. It's true that two can mix to form something else, but that's all It took only one yellow X to infect Samus, while only one red X became Ridley. Considering it only took a core-X to become Mega Core-X upon downloading the Varia Suit, there might be more to duplicating than having multiple parasites.  Samus only fought bosses like Serris, Nightmare, Ridley one-on-one. Ten SA-Xs would be overwhelming, as the battle with SA-X's first form is a pain."

Notice whenever you defeat a boss they not only devolve into a Core-X but also six or so little regular X. Also Mega Core-X also devolves into several X, it may have only taken one Core-X to download the Varia data, when it runs to the next room its still flashing in its pre-Mega form and by the time you see it tranformed it could have absorbed multiple X to retain its large size."

GameTheorists,2x4xxe,DanielisAwesome52,1 point,Thu Feb 26 14:08:39 2015 UTC,"This sounds cool and all, but I think a few problems arise when you think of this outside the viewpoint of the game.  A. This game was written by a Japanese team, then translated by a English group B. This was written way before M:OM was even a concept as far as I know  So first off, I think the fact that you never see more than one is merely a limitation of the hardware/programming/etc. The team never thought to justify the fact there were multiple, they figured saying it was enough. But also If they the thought had crossed their minds they could have replayed the old SA-X scenes when you reentered those rooms. But again, what if you tried to fight those SA-X at your full power? The team would've had to justify not getting the Ice Beam from one of them but getting it from the mutated SA-X, or why none of them turned into the mutated SA-X when confronted. Maybe they could have done a half Prime half M:OM styled thing where after the game you could track down the extra SA-X and fought them in different environments, but that would have required alot more work they may not had time for, or not enough space/technology to implement it on the GBA  I'm going to preface this point with my personal belief, I don't feel M:OM is really canon. But let me explain a little, it just feels wedged in without a lot of forethought causing some issue with continuity (and no not the Ridley scene, I believe the Ridley scene was justified) The second point being that I think the Federation's insidiousness in M:OM was a result of Fusion, not the other way around. I don't really think the cloning and genetics stuff were happening outside BSL, since in the beginning the narrator (not a direct participant) says the GF used a cell culture from the Baby implying it was a direct thing from Ceres. M:OM has this murky backstory implying they had the plans WAYYY before the events of Ceres and Zebes. yet Fusion takes place very close to Super considering it didn't involve anything more than environment manipulation (the point of BSL it seems) it makes more sense for Fusion's cloning and rebreeding to happen in such a short span, rather than murky genetic testing (let alone a successful enough project to create Metroids totally immune to Ice)  All in all I think Fusion was well thought out and written, and shouldn't be measured by things done in M:OM. A few minor plot-holes do appear because the nature of a Video game limited by hardware."
GameTheorists,2x4xxe,DanielisAwesome52,1 point,Thu Feb 26 06:36:46 2015 UTC,"Regardless of you opinion on MOM, this theory stands on its own from MF. This is why I said the possession of Metroid DNA wouldn't need to have MOM involved. Say it was a game limitation. How is having an extra SA-X sprite a limitation when there are extra sprites of other creatures?  The programmers could have easily avoided putting another SA-X when Samus acquired the plasma beam, or made it possible to where Samus could not attack two SA-Xs, since there would be no way for her to get to that area on time. For example, in Metroid: Zero Mission, a space pirate in Chozodia takes the powrr bomb. There is no way at the time to reach him. When you get to where he was, he's gone.  As for the Core-X releasing X parasites when it returns to its true form, that could be taken as a defense mechanism. When the Core-X is exposed, it could release more parasites to stop the attacker. Since  Samus has Metroid DNA, this ends up being advantageous on her part."
GameTheorists,2x4xxe,DanielisAwesome52,1 point,Thu Feb 26 15:39:20 2015 UTC,"Its not the having the extra sprite, but all the programming it would take to make more cutscenes and sequences involving SA-X all over the station, when your intended to take it on faith (from the devs not just Adam) while your pressed for time to detonate the station  They could've intended the fact that you see absolutely no SA-X activity besides the destruction of the restricted zone and the final battle after getting the Plasma as the SA-X (the SA-X could also be plural to) to allude to them avoiding Samus after that point.  I don't think they would have had the dev time to program multiple scenes where the SA-X(s) outrun you, even if they could none of the level's you previously saw it/them were shaped well enough to keep you away from it, every time you see it its possible to get attack therefore it'd be possible to attack it.  Even if releasing multiple X was a defense mechanism it still means there are multiple little X in a Core and a Core replicated creature. That may be what a Core X is, just a conglomeration of multiple smaller X. It only took the one X to infect Samus, but she didn't start feeling the negative effects until it had replicated in her system, and I'm guessing because every large creature reverts to a Core including the SA-X that it took the X replicating to form that core alot more than just one merely tranforming, as to why it took her whole recovery and travel time for it to break out of its shipment in BSL.  Also when Arachnus (Morph Ball) and Zazabi (Hi Jump) bosses form they have smaller X in the shape of the creature float into place. If the smaller X were merely a defense mechanism why would they be needed before hand when the Core-X battles clearly show they can peel of smaller X at will?"

Link survives falls in Ocarina of Time  In Majora’s Mask, you take zero fall damage when you land on a Deku Flower,   Yet you take fall damage in this game, don't you?  Also, aren't you a deku scrub when you land from something that high? Link landing on the flower after falling down from the tree was probably random chance, as you can still die in Termina, apparently.   Link is shown back in the Lost Woods where he began his journey at the start of the game   Wasn't this covered in the video?   All ""proof"" is based off over analyzing and guesswork while conveniently ignoring very pointed facts that don't fit the theory.   Uh, wow...How about we just don't think about things in games anymore?  Edit: Also, stop posting things expecting matpat to see them already people..."

Great theory though, thoroughly enjoyed."
GameTheorists,2wseym,imsophiepayne,8,Sun Feb 22 20:18:49 2015 UTC,Jesus being referred to as the lamb is because the lamb is linked with sacrifice. Jesus died as a sacrifice to wipe everyone who ever was and ever will be free from sin. Thanks to thend lamb title stems from people using lambs as sacrifices prior to that.

In fact it was first used in Christianity when St Peter asked to be crucified upside down because he was not worthy of being crucified the same way Jesus was.

Iv heard this happen a few times with super smart AI systems. Looking into the Halo universe give examples of the Forerunners AI going a bit nuts from having too much time on their hands and then the human super AIs think them selves to death (I can not think of an account where one was left alive long enough to see if it over came it's rampancy) Or looking to the Terminator series you can see where super smart AIs can go a bit bonkers just from their programming being too logical.  So as far as the human mind being downloaded it's not too far fetched when you look into how the mind works. It's all a bunch of electrical signals and data that has all ready been translated by computers for amputates getting robotic limbs. All it is really is A) finding enough storage for the human mind, B) find a way to do the transfer that would not damage the mind. There are a few more things that go along with it but I'm drawing a blank right now but yes it is a possible thing there is just a lot to take account for"

GameTheorists,2wsnkk,ZXDarkblade,3,Mon Feb 23 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"Awesome post. The fact you are awarded with something called ""the godhead"" is interesting. I'm not 100% sure what the godhead means for Christianity, given this game focus on it, but in more eastern religions and philosophies the godhead is a term given to a sort of divine energy which links all things (As said by Alan Watts, ""If I am my foot, I am the Sun""). And when people embrace the idea of the god head, they often come off in a state with more peaceful understanding of themselves and the world around them.  This backs up what you said with the ending of Issac seeing himself as a demon, and how he was happy with himself but not at peace with himself. The godhead philosophy on the other hand allows for people, and Issac in this case to be happy and at peace with themselves sometimes to a point where they are even more at peace with the idea of death (which Issac wasn't originally as show with ??? or blue baby). These games seem to show Issac's spiritual journey. Sorry for the rant"
GameTheorists,2wsnkk,The_Mad_Hamster,2,Mon Feb 23 12:01:37 2015 UTC,"After I did a little bit or reasearch I think I understand what the godhead is. But WARNING, there are religious stuff I'm going to talk about, so if you do not care or want to know there is no reason to read further.  In a lot of types of Christianity, such as the Orthodoxes, some holy deities and saints are portrayed wearing what looks like a golden crown, similar to the halo, but instead of beeing hollow, it is a complete circle. I think that is what the godhead is, since, becoming saint is something that is considered a very big deal in Christianity and this reason is why the Godhead is so hard to find but so powerfull as well."
GameTheorists,2wu4v3,swegmesterflex,2,Mon Feb 23 04:12:39 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Mars's moon is not getting closer,  infact it will move closer and then farther if not in place. The reason to this is that the small Cabal grunts that you face have a group of high ranked members that are much stronger, using their powers to keep it in orbit. They plan to throw it at Venus where a Vex hot spot is located. So it's too artificial to have any practical use for dating, but good try.   The reason why they didn't throw it to earth is due to it having little influence due to it's idleness and little status of danger to the Cabal. The vex are at war with the Cabal, trying to capture Mars, luckily for the Cabal, they control most of Mars and even having miles of war machines and bunkers at their disposal. They destroy planets and moons for getting in their way, so by throwing the moon to Venus, they were able to do what they are rumored to do. The reason why it is still in orbit is because they still  need to get the orbits to line up and perhaps other variables such as taking needed materials out of it."
GameTheorists,2wu4v3,A_favorite_rug,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:06:51 2015 UTC,Seems like a waste of energy. Them are keeping it at a very low altitude which definitely requires a lot of energy when they could easily leave it in orbit and conserve the their energy/power. Its observable rotation may suggest something magnetic but I can't think of too much at this point.
GameTheorists,2wu4v3,A_favorite_rug,1 point,Mon Feb 23 17:50:15 2015 UTC,"They don't need to, they don't use machines, they use their minds  to keep it in low orbit, they can use it as a massive military satellite and they do, they can add for faster deployment or perhaps keeping it in that level of orbit makes it fit best for the path to Venus."

GameTheorists,2wu4v3,A_favorite_rug,2,Mon Feb 23 16:19:50 2015 UTC,The game does still have some other scientific inconsistencies. The lack of description and knowledge on the traveller I'm fine with but I don't understand why the Sun appears so big on Mercury. Mercury's orbit is elliptical and based on the illustrations I was able to find happens to have its lowest orbit at 2/3 the altitude (relative to the Sun) of its highest orbit. Given its orbit the sun is 1/4 the time of the Earth I think its safe to assume that the Suns size apparent from mercury would only be 3.5 to 4.5 times the size it is on Earth. Meaning not covering the majority of the horizon. I found that funny while playing the game.

However, if you just take the final result of 190.99 X g/9.8 where g is acceleration due to gravity of the cuurrent planet, she has a weight of 19.49 X g, with the armor itself weighing 10.3053 X g.  From the wiki: While Zebes' diameter is similar to Earth's, its mass is 4.8 trillion teratons, or 4.8 trillion trillion tons. This is equivalent to 4.8 septillion tons, whereas Earth's mass is 5.9 sextillion tons. This makes Zebes' acceleration due to gravity of 9,360m/s² approximately 960 times greater than Earth's of 9.807m/s². Which means that on Zebes Samus weighs 182,436.4 Kg, and the armour is 96,457.608 Kg.  Edit: some errors in writing"
GameTheorists,2wtml4,autowikiabot,1 point,Tue Feb 24 08:41:15 2015 UTC,"Zebes:       Captain N: The Game Master Originally a Chozo colony, Zebes (or the Chozo research/tech scattered across it) had been desired by the Space Pirates for some time. The Space Pirates tried to invade it on the founding of the Galactic Federation, but were unsuccessful. It was after this that the Chozo inhabitants took the orphaned Samus Aran under their wing; also, breakthroughs in the design of the Metroids were made by Gray Voice and the organic computer Mother Brain at this time. After Samus became a Federation Police Force officer, the Space Pirates returned with the Space Pirate Flagship, Mother Brain betrayed the Chozo, and the Chozo colony was entirely evacuated and/or wiped out. For the next few years the Space Pirates secretly used Zebes as their primary base of action, and, under the guidance of Mother Brain, became a more effective and deadly force, conducting unthinkable experiments to weaponize the Chozo-made parasitic life-form: Metroid. The Galactic Federation sent Samus back to Zebes to destroy the threat of Metroids and Mother Brain. Samus succeeded in neutralizing both the Metroids and Mother Brain, and she destroyed the Space Pirate Mother Ship, seemingly ending the Space Pirate presence on Zebes. For the next few years the planet's only inhabitants were the roughly 200 archaeologists and researchers sent there to study the many Chozo ruins on the planet's surface and in the subterranean tunnels. Eventually the Space Pirates returned to Zebes, regained their previous strength, and rebuilt Mother Brain.

GameTheorists,2wtml4,Overlord_Xcano,1 point,Tue Feb 24 08:41:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, Zebes' gravitational acceleration would be 9.36 m/s2. When you change Zebes' mass from 4.8 trillion teratons to 4.8 billion teratons, which is 4.8 sextillion tons, Zebes becomes more like Earth, especially when Zebes' diameter is 11,700 km. Earth's is 12,742 km. So I'm positive Retro Studios was aiming for this, but accidentally put ""trillion teratons"" instead of ""billion teratons"".  Considering Samus can throw a whale shark-sized creature capable of swimming and leaping like 10 meters or more into the air from lava puts her physical strength at least close to what it would be if she lived on a planet with 960 times greater than Earth's gravity.

I'm sure it's a term you've heard before. Some would have you believe that all Americans are hateful, narrow-minded, racist, and homophobic, but most of us aren't. They'd point to the news as evidence, but these people belong to the ""Vocal Minority"". They scream and get heard the most over the vast sea of people who disagree with them. Maybe it's not like that in your LoL experience, but in other peoples', it could be.   This isn't a strict psychological principle or anything (I mean it may be, I don't know, if it is I'm not aware of it), but I think people tend to focus on bad things more than good things. Or, at least talk about them. When something pleasant happens, you usually don't have to get it off your chest. I mean, there's exciting news, but it's not like you'd go around saying ""Man the League of Legends community is really nice"" off the cuff or anything. Conversely, when bad things happen, we need to complain about it. To share our pain and have people sympathize with us. And so people talk about bad experiences more than good.   Maybe you've been lucky. Who knows?     My own brief time with the community was a mixed bag.

GameTheorists,2wsvt7,MrHatAndCloak,2,Sun Feb 22 21:56:15 2015 UTC,"I found the story to this game fairly straightforward:  A group of AIs are trapped in their very own simulations, learning how to jump and complete tasks.  However, a glitch allows the AIs to cross the borders between the simulations and visit one another. This introduces the opportunity for them to cooperate, making them more effective and powerful than the creators intended. This causes a panic among the scientists out in the real world, as the AIs have begun to go completely out of control.  Working together, the AIs manage to do something impossible and let Thomas catch a brief glimpse of the Internet. Immediately, he wants to escape from the network of simulations and go there.  However, he realizes that he and his team cannot go to the Internet because the scientists have placed a lock on his entire team. Following the theme of cooperation, Thomas takes it one step further, and realizes that he must cooperate with other AIs who have not been locked down yet, so that they might become powerful enough to go to the Internet in his place. So he and his entire team sacrifice themselves so that other AIs can take their powers and maybe have a chance to escape. These AIs have learned true selflessness, which is perhaps the pinnacle of their existence.  Elsewhere in the network, other AIs are working together, and are given new powers by the glitched code that Thomas and his friends had released into the other simulations. However, the scientists are working hard to contain the mess, and have implemented a garbage collector program to delete all of them, and there is also an evil virus AI who has earned their trust. The garbage collector ends up destroying nearly all of the other team, plus the virus AI, while sparing a single member of their group.  Elsewhere still, thanks to the efforts of all the other AIs and the madness they caused, two random AIs manage to escape into the Internet just before the scientists nuke the whole network."

GameTheorists,2wpu1a,quwertie,2,Sun Feb 22 04:25:20 2015 UTC,"Isn't Rattman alive in both Portal one and two? Obviously his drawings  are in both games, and 20,000-50,000 years would take its toll on his paintings in the second game, and in another level he seems to have an abandoned shelter, where the radio transmission is. However, they seem virtually untouched. He is also heard speaking in one of the levels in Portal 2. So if he were to be alive, it would have to be somewhere between 60-80 years (if he is in his twenties or thirties, when most schizophrenic breaks happen), unless he has an unusually long lifespan.  The only true source we have from the developers is the e-book, which sets it at 50,000 years. But like the video said, this could have changed during development."

Cost of ammunition:  Scout: Negligible  Soldier: £250 per bazooka shot. x 10 = £2500 per game.   Pyro: Meh... Negligible.    Demoman: £150 per grenade x 15, and (I'm guessing here) £200 per stickybomb x 12 = £4650 per game.  Heavy: ""She weighs one hundred fifty kilograms and fires two hundred dollar, custom-tooled cartridges at ten thousand rounds per minute.It costs four hundred thousand dollars to fire this weapon... for twelve seconds."" £150 * 100 = £15,000 per game.   Engineer: £600 per sentry; maybe £600 per upgrade, plus don't forget those rockets! (Also, let's just say that the teleporter is over £9000 so as not to break the maths? Realistically it would be priceless.) £600 * 3 + 250 * 4 + £9000+ = £2800 + £9000+  Medic: I'm not going to ask how much a magic medic gun costs, but my guess is that it's over £9000, so we'll go with that... = £9000+  Sniper: Sorry, mate.   Spy: Rien ici.   Adding all those up... £2500 + £4650 + £15000 + £2600 + 2(£9000+) = £24750 + 2(£9000+)  I'll let YOU choose a suitable price for the medigun and teleporter...   Edit: Multiplied by ten to account for the re-spawns = £247500 + 2(£9000+)"
GameTheorists,2wna42,MinatoCauthon,3,Sat Feb 21 12:58:06 2015 UTC,"Converting these to dollars...  Soldier: $280~ per bazooka shot. Times ten is $2,800~ per game  Demoman: $170 per grenade times fifteen is $2,550, $350 per stickybomb times twelve is $4,200. Total of $6,750.  Heavy: $17,000~ per game  Engineer: $680~ per sentry/upgrade, so $1,360 per sentry. Total of $4,080, assuming three fully upgraded sentries are built in a game.  So far that's $15,330. But if we factor in the other classes...  Scout: Scattergun/shotgun costs roughly $300. A single shell costs about $3. It takes about 2 shots to kill most class, so if the Scout killed five people, it would be be $30 worth of shotgun shells, totaling in $330. Next, a military-grade, semi-automatic pistol costs about $600. Since the number of bullets needed to kill varies, we will take the number of bullets a Scout can carry, which is 36 per mag. A bullet costs about $1.50 (depends on carrier), so the total price per mag is $54~. Added to the gun is $654~.  And a baseball bat costs maybe $5. So a grand total of... $989.  Pyro: A military-grade flamethrower is about $28,000. It would use about three gallons of gasoline at a time, which would be roughly $6. So a total of $28,006 if the Pyro used one round of gasoline.  Medic: Since the MedGun isn't technically a weapon, I'll be using a syringe gun. Doctors do use syringe guns to administer shots. Although they don't use them quite in how they are used in the game, we can assume he is using a modified version of the real thing. A syringe gun typically costs $70 dollars, but the tools needed to modify it raise that to about $100. A hypodermic syringe costs $15, and since the gun fires ten syringes a second, it would cost $900 to fire it for one minute. Combined with the gun would be a total price of $1,000 dollars, not counting the unknown poisonous substance that may be inside the needles.  Sniper: A military sniper rifle costs $8,600 on it's own, since it has laser sight and a scope. Since it typically takes one shot with an experienced sniper, and a sniper round costs about $5, it would be $25 if they got ten kills. That's a total of $8,625.  Spy: Again, the spy equipment can't really count as weapons, but the revolver and knife can. A six-chamber revolver costs about $550, and a bullet costs $1.50 (depending on carrier). If the Spy used all 24 bullets in his clip, it would cost $36, which adds up to $586. A butterfly knife costs about $15, so that makes $601.  Adding ALL of that up, along with all the assumptions, would be a total of $54,551 or £47,916~  I really hope I converted and added right. I probably ended up on a government watch list for googling all of this. Hope this helps."
GameTheorists,2wna42,NeonZelda,1 point,Sun Feb 22 04:44:37 2015 UTC,Well... I made the assumption that the guns are pre-owned...  So the guns cost approximately the same as the ammo? I find that hard to believe... And yet...

Some games don't have any need for a sequel and adding one would be foolish, others only need one or two but could allow for more, others still are worse for the sequels they got. . 4) I've never heard of this kind of thing. However assuming it is a thing that exists it is likely similar to ""Genwunner Syndrome"" and heavily influenced by nostalgia. . 5) The video gaming industry is still fairly new and has yet to complete it's ""societal hazing"" as the movie, music, and television industries have in their own early years."
GameTheorists,2wjewy,GamerGoddessDin,1 point,Fri Feb 20 12:46:28 2015 UTC,"Questions 1 to 3 are purely opinion based, so there's not much to say about those. I've never heard anything like 4, so I'll move one.  As of 5 there really are multiple reasons. From my personnal experience, mainly video games are a new type of media that include violence, studies about their affects are just starting to come out. Secondly, video games, contrairely to other forms of entertainment, exercice violence in active-passive way; meaning that the gamer is actively doing the violence (by choosing which action to take), but is still passively witnessing it (cause you know, you just press a button, your are not ripping off eye balls). This, in light of number one, makes for a complex mix of perception and comprehension of the media. And third of all, video games are easy targets; just like death metal, video games sometime tackle violent subject matters, are enjoyed mainly by youth, are not seen keenly in the popular eye and are judge in the media by people who usually don't have a clue of what they are talking about. Do note that those 3 points are curently evolving for the better."
GameTheorists,2wjewy,blond-max,1 point,Fri Feb 20 18:14:17 2015 UTC,"1) Some people just like the look of the other gender more/better options to play dressup with. For example: Pokemon Black/White (it may have been 2, I forget) had differently colored UI. Pink for girls, blue for boys. I know myself and quite a few people I know made our gender choices based on that. In Pokemon XY, female characters had a lot more fashion options than males. In Monster Hunter and I'm sure probably many other games, the same armor looks different on male and female characters. For some people it's just a matter of looking for different things with character customization.  2) Sonic 06 is 100% suck. Real answer though: this is another big opinion thing. A big, undeniable one seems to be if a game is so glitchy it's unplayable, it sucks.   4) You pretty much answered your own question. People who call it shit because it's not on PS3 anymore are just salty because it's not on PS3/PS4. They think their console's the best blah blah console wars etc etc"
GameTheorists,2wjewy,rynnamin,1 point,Fri Feb 20 21:50:26 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of this has to do with the expanding demographic of gamers.  Not sure if anyone has made a video about it, but I'm sure there's gotta be one out there somewhere.  Personally, (in terms of Pokemon) I did play as the female protagonist because of the aesthetic changes in X/Y.  In Fire Emblem Awakening there's different dialogue if one chooses a different MU.  This is pure opinion, and there's no reason for anyone to say right out that a game is ""Really great"" or ""Terrible.""  Usually this falls into the general consensus that a game is good or bad.   Updates to a game are always nice, but when a game has a formula that works most developers just stick to that.  Sure little changes here and there are great (ie: Final fantasy V's expanded Class system from FFIII), but most times it's just a good ole format.  This I see more often than not is because people only own one or maybe two different systems to play it on.  Some games are multi-platform releases, and that's great.  But when a console get's out dated, or the franchise fizzles out it's hard to stay true to the original.  Ie: FFVII being on the PSN systems after Nintendo, and now even on Xbox systems as a multi-platform release.  This is strictly speculation.  There's no reason a game should be the basis for accusing or defending someones intentions.  If someone buys a game they feel they'll enjoy that reflects on the buyers intended emotions.  If someone wants to buy an FPS because they want to shoot people in a re-enacted scenario, then they will. It's just like how people play RPG's, or even simple games.  There's an emotion and feeling we expect and want in a video game.  I mean anyone who's played any of the ""Mother"" series knows what they're getting into.  Would they play it for any other reason?"
GameTheorists,2wf325,Pokeshadow97,3,Thu Feb 19 10:55:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a replica prop fabricator with a good deal of experience in composites.  Making an accurate replica of the long-fall boots is on my project list, so I've done some thought on the matter.  The problem, as I see it, is one of materials science.  What are the properties of that ""spring"" on the heel?  First, lets just presume that it's a magical future-material and that no part of the boot itself will break.  If it behaves like a normal spring, the big problem wouldn't be physical injury, the problem would be conservation of energy.  All of that kinetic energy has to go somewhere.  In a normal compression spring, most of that energy goes right back into forcing the other direction.  If Chell's boots did this then she would be sent flying.  Every fall would be followed by bounce after bounce.  So it needs to not act like a spring, but instead like a shock absorber.  This means that the mechanism compresses in such a way that it converts the energy into heat.  Damnit, I've gotta run, but I've got plenty more to say about this...  Edit: I basically finished my thought in a reply below"
GameTheorists,2wf325,verdatum,16,Thu Feb 19 23:33:15 2015 UTC,"So the shape is wrong to do that.  Taking it to be a spring, when the spring compresses, the heel drops down to the ground.  Shifting your weight to the tip of the foot would merely cause the spring to decompress; first to it's static state, and then extend further forwards. But at this point, it's already has that kinetic energy back, the momentum would be proportional to the energy put into the fall.  Depending on how the boot is designed, you'd either hit a point of maximum extension on your ankle at which point the boot would prevent your foot from bending any farther, causing your entire body to propel forward, or your ankle would hyperextend, resulting in something like a sprain, dislocation, or a break.  If the shape wasn't wrong to do that, then the spring would vibrate massively for quite awhile, and make a fantastic noise.  You'd basically have to drop down to your knees and chill out for 30 seconds or so as energy in the spring dissipated.  Again, the way that energy would disappate would be as a combination of the sound vibrations and the heating of the spring.    ANYWAY, lets do some math!  Human terminal velocity according to mythbusters tests, is 120mph.  And I do believe that number is based on the body being straight up and down; if you flatten out it is lower.  I don't feel like working out Chell's weight too carefully, but her body is based off of Alesia Glidewell, who at least according to answers.com (yeah they kinda suck) is 5' 4 1/2"".  According to a BMI chart (yeah, they suck too), normal weight for that height is between around 105 and 145 pounds.  We can take Potato GlaDos' claim that she isn't fat and just use 125. I'm gonna round that to 58kg, which is fair, since she also has clothes, boots and a portal gun, and metric is nice.  Kinetic energy is 1/2mv2.    .5 * 58kg * 53.6m/s2 = 83300Joules of energy.  That's 23.1 watt-hours.  That's 19400 calories (19.4 food calories)  Let's keep going.  Let's pretend that the springs are similar to carbon fiber composite, since that is obviously their inspiration.  Acording to this source which admittedly is not experimental data, but anyway, the specific heat of carbon fiber composite at room temperature is 690 j/(kg * K).  That means it takes 690 joules to raise the temperature of 1kg of carbon fiber by 1kelvin  Let's presume that the combined weight of the carbon fiber springs is .5kg.  83300 / 690 / .5 = 241K.  With room temperature at 21C, that means that if the springs/shock-absorbers had to absorb all of the energy from a maximum speed chell just by converting to heat energy, their temperature would raise to a whopping 262° Celsius (504° Fahrenheit).  But I've got an alternative possibility.  If instead of converting that energy into heat, what if we could do something with it?  There are plenty of ways you can convert either mechanical energy or heat energy into electrical energy.  What if those boys back at the lab managed to work something out to do exactly that with the boots?  Then you'd have massive amounts of electricity!  That's fine and all, but what would you do with all that electricity?  Well here's a thought: Maybe Chell's falls are exactly what powers the portal gun.  Hey, but that's just a theory..."

Although both of Pistorius' legs were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old, he has competed in events for single below-knee amputees and for able-bodied athletes.  After becoming a Paralympic champion, Pistorius attempted to enter able-bodied international competition, over persistent objections of the IAAF and charges that his artificial limbs gave an unfair advantage. Pistorius eventually prevailed in this legal dispute. At the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, Pistorius became the first amputee to win an able-bodied world track medal. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Pistorius became the first double leg amputee to participate in the Olympics when he entered the men's 400 metres and 4 × 400 metres relay races. At the 2012 Summer Paralympics, Pistorius won gold medals in the men's 400-metre race and in the 4 × 100 metres relay, setting world records in both events. He also took silver in the 200-metre race, having set a world record in the semifinal.  In February 2013, Pistorius fatally shot his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in his Pretoria home. He said he had mistaken Steenkamp for an intruder, but he was arrested and charged with murder. At his trial in 2014 he was found guilty of culpable homicide.    In October 2014, Pistorius received a five-year prison sentence for culpable homicide and a concurrent three-year suspended prison sentence for a separate reckless endangerment conviction.   In November, prosecutors asked the sentencing judge for permission to appeal the verdict; permission was granted in December and the case will next be presented to a five-person panel at the Supreme Court of Appeal.

I would have rather watched two intelligent people, such as themselves, seriously do research, and seriously craft and carry out an earnest debate without falling into obvious traps.  It's not such a crazy idea. Speech and Debate club is all about taking an arbitrary position and arguing it whether you agree with it or not.  Collect research, prepare notes, predict your opponent's moves. Do it all independently, and then clash together and see what happens; either in a heavily moderated setting, or in a carefully edited down version of a long, drawn out debate.  I think the former would be vastly easier and cause vastly less resultant bitch-fests (""no fair, there was a jump-cut.  his line was clearly taken out of context!""), no thank you.  As far as the aesthetics, um, they weren't the worst thing in the world, but wow, there was a lot of effort put into it, and it added so little.  I'm a huge fan of the retro aesthetic.  It speaks straight to my demographic, but I don't need to be informed that ""A just flamed B"", yeah, I get it.  And I don't need anyone arbitrarily deciding the damage each argument makes. Take away the points, take away the life bars, and just let the arguments speak for themselves.  I wouldn't bitch for this long if I didn't respect the guy, and see the potential in what he's trying to do.  Branching out is risky, and I admire that.  You often have to try new things or face stagnation, or dissatisfaction with what you are doing.  This wasn't a complete failure, it just needs a lot of work to have a similar draw to the main game-theory videos."

It's just having a super amazing end card tournament and having people tell you the pros and cons of each before you vote.  It needs to be more decisive. Don't worry about offending people and worry about reaching a conclusion.

GameTheorists,2w86i4,Empolo,16,Wed Feb 18 21:30:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, throwing out my ideas. First, you didn't introduce any other segment other than the closing arguments, and it felt out of place. Either into all segments, (Intro, hardware, games, etc.) or don't do any. Second, I think that you guys should look at each other more. It's a debate, so you should look at your partner. I know that your prompts are next to the cameras, but it feels off. Place the prompts where the center globe is so it provides the illusion of an actual debate, and just look at the camera every so often. Third, I felt like the view moving around was a little crazy, and I'd like to see that slowed down. Maybe keep the fighting sprites locked to the bottom half while zooming around the top half. I thought the idea was good and I enjoyed the actual debate with the personal touch. Thanks for your time. ﻿"

That's technically incorrect. The Mega Drive was the original name of the Genesis in PAL regions and Japan. What you're thinking of it the Master System which predates the Genesis/Mega Drive. It's backwards compatible via the Power Base Converter.   You'd have to physically modify the system to play Mega drive games on the Genesis. Just as you'd have to physically modify the SNES to play Super Famicom (the name of the SNES in PAL regions and Japan) games.  Still gotta go Genesis for my vote."

I like the idea that it's a fighting ""game"" and such and the intro is perfect in my mind, but once it hits the actual debate, the graphics and some of the awkward ""acting"" going on started to make it cringe-worthy. I agree with most people in that it should be more of a ""real"" debate, where two people come prepared (as both clearly were for this) but let the points come naturalyl in the ""rounds,"" rather than a set script being followed. Just be sure to get both people's points thoroughly across.  On top of that, ditch the pixel fighting and all the unnecessary animations, and just have a simple background in the retro aesthetic. We don't need all these sub-par animations and such for what equates to a debate, regardless of how good they may be. Replace them with the relevant pictures that were in the tiny circle and you're fine, more like a lecture from a professor on a projector, or something else along those lines.  I'll probably keep watching since I like the idea, but if the cheesy stuff sticks around, I may not."
GameTheorists,2w86i4,Tisaric,1 point,Wed Feb 18 06:12:05 2015 UTC,"The show had some interesting potential, but that HP bar system just rubs me the wrong way in how it was executed. It's probably supposed to be an aesthetic, not a metric of the debate. Looking at the numbers, I just can't wrap my head around some of them (edit: doing this provided some extra clarity for certain points):  SNES's biggest losses:   3% to Specs list 4% to Blast Blast Processing 11% (1+2+8) to the slower processor 3% to beat-em-up genre of games on the Genesis 3% to revolutionizing how sports games were made 2% to groundbreaking genres 9% to games no produced first party: Rocket Knight (2%), Gun Star Heroes (2%), Comic Zone (5%) 20% to all the great SNES games being produced by Nintendo 5% to Genesis for the Genesis introducing plastic cases (it looked like 25% when I started this, above was not  clearly shown) 4% for no blood in Mortal Kombat   ===closing arguments===   10% to Genesis when it was pointed out it came out two years earlier 5% to Genesis sounding like a current generation console in it's features list 10% to no backwards compatibility 5% to playing on cartridges 5% to Dreamcast repeating these   How do those balance out to Genesis's losses:   2% for 32k colors 2% for SNES having everything (except blast processing) 4% for ad campaigns jibe 4% for Mario being faster than Sonic 4% for not having good games  10% for Sonic 1 being the only amazing game (2%), and Vectorman not sucking too much (8%) 37% for SNES Groundbreaking Genres: rail shooter Starfox (4%), racing game F-Zero (3%), kart racer MarioKart (3%), RPGs FFVI (3%), Chrono Trigger, (3%), Earthbound (3%), Super Mario RPG (3%), Platformers Super Mario World (3%),  Yoshi's Island (3%), Street Fighter II (3%), Super Metroid (3%), Link to the Past (3%) 7% for numerous SNES games on top 100 games of all time lists 5% for ""Bravo"" for game cases 17% for blood in MK II (8%), start button to change punch/kick (9%)   ===closing arguments===   5% for more superior games 2% for ""cheap knockoff of SNES"" 3% for the PC boom   It's better now that I actually look through it, but things still feel unbalanced in this. I had thought the plastic cases was a full 25%, not 5% as I later discovered, but in reviewing the episode I realized what probably most annoys me is that there's nothing actually new with this. Much of what appears on the channel as a whole are new things that I at least find intriguing, and I walk away nodding my head, think that's interesting, sometimes mulling it over further, and generally feeling it was worthwhile. I don't know I can say that about this show, or at least about this debate. Perhaps it's a poor choice in topic, but I'm wary of the show going forward if it isn't leaving me with thoughts rather than asking me to think about it."

I thought it would've been way more interesting if it was carried out more formally. It like the Game Theory channel because you learn something new about video games, and at the end of each Game Theory episode a debatable topic comes up (kind of like in the FNAF theories, making a theory who the murderer was). In this video I think it would've been better just to go with claiming that one console was better than the other than the end, but also leaving the super amazing end card tournament in the end to get the opinions of the watchers. I guess in the end I think it would be best to stick the the Game Theory formula, but take the formula and adapt it to new and interesting formats, such as deadlock."

GameTheorists,2w86i4,ThatSlyDevlin,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:37:44 2015 UTC,"I liked the topic, but I didn't like the graphics. It felt too distracting. The video seemed gimmicky, like the cell phone app version of a real debate. The reason I love game theorists is because I actually learn new things with every episode. MattPat really scrubs to find tidbits I didn't know before. having grown up with a SNES, with friends who had both of these systems, I'll say this presentation felt a bit misleading with regards to specs.  I thought it a bit off when watching, but in the youtube comments, later, I saw that many people came out of this with the  (wrong) understanding that the Genesis was the technically superior console, which is wrong all around -- with the sole exception of the main CPUs clock. clock speed is important in generalized CPUs like used in desktops, although other things are of consideration too. Bus speed, for instance (like when the pentium 4 came out, and was amazing fast, but in reality had to idle a lot because ram wasn't fast enough to feed it, which is why it used super expensive RAMBUS RDRAM, to feed it data. the FSB on the P4 could take in data at 400MHz but the Ram at the time was like 166 or maybe 233Mhz. When the P4 launched, the AMD Athlon, even with it's 133MHz bus was able to beat it in benchmarks, because until near the end of it's life, when dual channel 400Mhz ram set ups became available, the P4 just couldn't be fed but..back to topic.   CPU clockspeed is often not so important in CPUs designed for a purpose. In the Snes, the cpu was designed with its role in mind, unlike the cpu in your tower.  it was never going to process word documents, or decode video, for example. So the CPU was built with a specific work task in mind that wasn't going to change. As for the total package --the SNES' hardware could  do multiple layers, transformations, way more colors on screen in a frame, and the custom Sony chip destroyed the competition's sound.   I think that overall, this video presented that SNES had the games, but Genesis had the tech, the latter of which is an argument I've never heard before. The graphics on the SNES were significantly better. Many friends were openly envious of the SNES' graphics. I remember star fox blowing one friend's mind and him calling in his mom to show her how amazing the graphics were. She acted non-plussed -- suprising to me at the time,  :)  Anyway, to echo other comments, I love the  concept, but would like more focus on the debate, instead of panning around to show us a megaman sprite battle, that while cute (I love megaman), was rather irrelevant in the end. That stuff is distracting rather than informing. Informing videos are why I come to the channel to watch. MattPatt does informing well, and in Game Theory videos I love the artwork and editing, so I'm not sure why this struck me so.  I guess I'm among those who would rather have a well researched debate performed spontaneously with a moderator. I also would like to see a definitive winner. I didn't like the inconclusive ending. I also didn't like that there was no ""poll"" to see which system was getting more votes. I don't think the Genesis was a turd or anything, and it was indeed designed to crush the NES. Remember, it was the 1990s, and the NES, which came out in 1983 in Japan, was still going strong. I really don't remember knowing the SNES was coming out until it came out, (I was in 3rd grade however, and there was no internet so take that into consideration), but Sega might not have even known the SNES was being worked on when they designed the Genesis.  If MattPatt wanders in and see this, then I want to say thanks for all your hard work, I've watched all of your videos, they are awesome! I just wanted to throw in my 2 cents :). Critics are always drawn to the best of artists, right? :)"

Framing it as a debate that will put the console war to rest and then not committing to a winner feels like a cop out to me. Tech wise the genesis seemed to have the upper hand and game wise the SNES killed it. To me that makes the SNES a better console, because you can have the most technologically advanced car in the world, but if you can only drive it in a straight line in the desert it's not much use as a car. I'd rather have my old Peugeot that can take me to the shops. I mean I get not wanting to piss off the fan boys but those consoles are almost 2 decades old. You can surely decide that one was better than the other somewhat objectively.   It's kinda like ""No right answer"" on the escapist, it's not really about proving which is better, just about showing the pros and cons of each and letting you draw your own conclusions. This didn't really make sense to me until I saw them both sitting on 1% and realized that's why it's called deadlock. Because every debate will be open ended, with ""no right answer"". Which takes the fun out of the debate if you ask me.   That and I think the whole debate health bar  thing was kinda pointless and distracting, especially since it'll end both parties on 1% each time. It's cute, but I'd almost rather this was  like a podcast. could be longer if they weren't wasting time posturing for the animations, and give them time to get into a proper debate.   I love the concept, but if it was just two guys at a desk with their notes and hashing it out for 10-20 minutes, really digging deep into the heart of what made the consoles shine and stand out it would be a lot more interesting in my opinion."
GameTheorists,2w86i4,Sgtdante,0,Tue Feb 17 23:12:02 2015 UTC,"it seemed like a copout right from the beginning by going for ""more influential"" instead of ""better."" if you're not going to define what you mean by influential, in what sense was it influential, then it means nothing. the only debate for Sega was that they threw more money into technology. Nintendo didn't go for high-tech at that time. they went for low-cost, low-tech, and ended up getting absolutely incredible games out of it anyway. if you're going to stick with the ""influential"" concept, though, there's absolutely no debate that the SNES had more influential games.  as for the show itself, there seems to be no point if the video itself doesn't take a stand one way or another. the graphics really added nothing.

This would mean that somehow the animus gives you the abilities of the other 'person' in the multiverse.   Another is the whole present day plot, with the first civilization, as that means that they aren't 'time travelers', but are basically aliens from the multiverse. The multiverse theory, however, could explain the ending of AC 3, where they tell Desmond what happens if he doesn't sacrifice himself. Since they travel through universes they experienced a universe where Desmond is selfish and doesn't sacrifice himself.   This theory could explain the ""Desynchronization"" when you fail an objective, though, as the animus just sends you to a different multiverse whenever you a) die, b) kill civilians, or c) lose your target.   One major thing that disproves this theory is Assassin's Creed Revelations, as it's about Desmond being in a ""coma"" after the events of Brotherhood and he must finish Ezio's and Altair's ""story"" to stop himself from turning into Subject 16 (google him for more info, basically he went in the Animus for too long and turned really crazy). BUT he is plugged into the Animus throughout the story, so that could kind of prove my theory that the animus sends you through the multiverse.   Another is you aren't able to play the story as your character after that character has successfully sent his gene-pool away into his children, i.e in AC3 once Haythem get ""I'm not even going to try to pronounce her name"" pregnant, you have a short section where you play as her pregnant"

An unrealistic place, like Magicant.  Since the song parts aren't actual tangible things it could follow this trend.  It's complicated to get into seeing as the group interacts with things we are believed to be in the real world, yet there's so much imagination to it that it could be anything.  I mean they're kids, wouldn't you be using your imagination if you were a kid too?   Just my input, but I like this idea.  What MM247 said about the Sunflower Fields and Dalaam is reasonable, but mostly plausible.  IMO the Sunflower Fields were completely a dream. Considering the situation there's no reason it would be anything but a dream.  As for Dalaam, now days I like to consider it a place like Skyloft from LoZ: SS.  It's a place not many people inhabit, it's been removed from the bulk of the main land, and in the end is still a place of importance."

GameTheorists,2w9bzj,Empolo,1 point,Wed Feb 18 02:13:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't really consider the matter of sleep/unconscious in the equation.  It's always been my vote that while Lucas was falling (from the Pork Bean) he could have slipped into a moment of unconsciousness, blacked out to say.  This would be similar to a dream scenario, and the two ""worlds"" melding into one as the real world pulled him back into it with the cliff and the hay stack.  Lucas falls from the Pork Bean, black out, the Sunflower Field is a dream, and when he falls from the cliff (dream) his body registers it as actually falling, and he is pulled from his dream (3rd person perspective) to the real world when he lands into the hay."
GameTheorists,2w9bzj,Empolo,1 point,Wed Feb 18 03:32:19 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I know this post is like 4 months old, but I have to ask you this: are you saying that the Sunflower Fields is a future Dalaam? If so, there really isn't any proof that Earthbound and Mother 3 don't take place during the same time. Also, if Lucas were in a dream, why would he see Boney? Are their dreams connected or something? Another thing, what would Lucas black out on? There was nothing falling near him, no debris or anything. I can get your reasoning with the coming back from the dream when he hits the hay.   And, on a random note: MOTHER ON WII U OMFG (EARTHBOUND BEGINNINGS)"

Some big scandal about it don't really know much about it. So yeah I could imagine that if someone truly wanted to they could claim a games depiction of war or violence gave them PTSD, though it might be a stretch to argue for since you were not being forced to play the game. But like Quantum said before it is possible that with newer advances that put you in the game, and with some games being powerful storytelling medias, yeah we could see some people claiming videos games ""the absolute evil of the world"" giving them such vivid traumatic experience that it affected their daily life. Be prepared for a possible warning sticker on the game box that says ""game contents may cause emotional and physical distress""  Edit: just checked read up on Melody Hensley if your interested"
GameTheorists,2w83dl,user240485,1 point,Sun Feb 22 22:50:04 2015 UTC,"Epilepsy is definitely one problem that can occur from video games. Also PTSD triggering is possible, but giving someone PTSD is unlikely, since a trigger can be anything associated with the memories but to give someone PTSD they need strong memories of absolute fear. To a certain extent dementia is possible, but again unlikely to occur. Someone could confuse the video game with real life (there was a case where a woman played too much Katamari and attempted to hit a mailbox with her car), but these effects will likely be short term. Playing too long could give people problems like vitamin D deficiency if they spend hours without going outside.  The one disease that can be definetly caused is Hikikomori. Sufferers from this will withdraw from society and stay in one room. This is not being anti-social and spending most of their time in one room, it is completely never leaving under any circumstance, refusing to see people and a total removal from society. It is especially common in japan and Korea where social pressure to perform is so high teenagers often remove themselves from society, locking themselves into their room and only opening the door for their parents to give them food. Video games can be a cause since the escape provided by them can further the idea for them to remove themselves from society."

GameTheorists,2w16a1,bobsimmo,1 point,Mon Feb 16 12:07:20 2015 UTC,"This is the harrowing thing with sponsorship.  It isn't a matter of buying off matpat; just like it isn't ever a matter of just buying off any earnest celebrity endorsement.  The trick, as a publicist for a game, or anything really, is to very carefully frame things; to control the message.  In this case, you give a level of sponsorship, you fly him out to play with tanks (I sure as fuck wouldn't say ""no"" to this!), and in return, you ask that he make a vid, promising him permission to say whatever you want.  You then feed the sponsor a well crafted narrative.  You combine exciting life experiences with a guided tour of the game features.  You sit over his shoulder and tell him what to look at; tell him how to play.  You keep him too distracted to take the time to think of questions.  You force him into a position where he sees that demonstrating the ability to ""play ball"" with this guys will open up the possibility of similar opportunities with other partners.  In the end, you've pretty much been check-mated. You walk the line. And I don't blame him for it.  The redeeming potential is that it is pretty blatantly obvious to see that this is a sponsored product.  And even though it bares the same name of ""game theory"" you can tell in minutes, if not seconds that this is a sponsored effort.  If that sort of thing keeps him funded in a way that makes it easier for him to do the sort of things that I admire him for, then good on him.  Nearly everyone wins, except for the sheep.  Even as an endorsement; honestly, if I was a tank enthusiast, yet more casual gamer, I'd be overjoyed to have seen this.  It would have brought something to my attention that I'd be more likely to enjoy than the average gamer, that without the video, I could have easily missed out on.  Hey, but that's just a theory..."

GameTheorists,2w10kj,qwerty7190,3,Mon Feb 16 01:09:22 2015 UTC,"To work out this theory will have to meet someone; Meet the Heavy Weapons Guy!  Within the video, he mentions Sasha, the gun of his dreams, weighing 150 kilograms (which is 330 pounds), which, if we put it in the magic of gym imagery, is the weight of what this kid is holding. So, what we know is simple; the heavy can lift this 150 kilograms with ease, I could end this theory right here but nyet comrade, I shall not end there.  Also in the video, the Heavy mentions Sasha fires at ten thousand rounds per minute, which is around... erm... 166.666666667 rounds per second(?) Let's round that up, it would be 167 rounds per second. The modern day equivalent of Sasha would be the M134D Minigun... except Sasha would be 2.5 M134Ds and in weight it would be 3.882.   But another theory of the Heavy is that he uses a minigun similar to the GAU-8 avenger (lucky for moi as it's a gun I have specs on).   Alright, the Avenger can fire sixty bullets a second (each bullet weighing a pound, fire eight, you got a newborn baby) so, we need to bump this up; 167 divided by 60 is 2.78333333333, which can be rounded to 2.8, almost three of the bad boys. Now, the Avenger produces around five tons of pressure from this out burst, so 5 multiplied by 2.8 is equal to 14.   So, how strong is the heavy? Strong lift a gun that ways three hundred pounds and fire fourteen tons of bullets for seconds without his arms breaking or him moving backwards. Either that or the Heavy has managed to hide four Fairchild Republics in his shirt."

GameTheorists,2w10kj,NuclearCorpus,2,Tue Feb 17 18:12:48 2015 UTC,"But in the combat the gun does not fire anywhere CLOSE to 10,000 RPM. It's more like 600."

The easiest solution, in terms of laws, would to adopt some european laws regarding work- and freetime. That could cause some backlash and would take some time to settle down, but I think that would be a feasible solution in the long run.  Laws here: You must not work for more than 8 hours / day on a regular basis.  You must not work for 7 days a week.  You must have at least 11 hours of spare time between end of work and begin of work.  With some exceptions and special cases of course."

As for Windwaker, we have no clue how deep Hyrule is under water, but we know it's under water.  If it was deep enough, it is possible that in the Windwaker world, people would happen to live near the sky and reach Skyloft, however, without knowing how deep Hyrule is underwater, we may never really know.  It's possible Skyloft is still even further up in the sky in Windwaker's time.

Technically, the remains of the land beneath the ocean are Hyrule, not the islands above. As far as I can tell, there is no governmental system or national state that the island villages answer to. Old Hyrule was flooded to prevent Ganondorf from claiming the Triforce when the Hero of Time didn't return.

I've thought for quite awhile that the current intro is beginning to look a bit outdated as the show has matured.  While I think this was incredibly well done, I do have some critiques.   As some others have said, Mario's 3D rotation looks just a bit odd. I feel it would be better if there was no rotation and he simply jumped at the end. The trophy lights appear in the wrong order. Look at the original again and you will see it goes Top-Left, Bottom-Right, Bottom-Left, Top-Right. It looks like your version has this rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Mario looks like he's moving kinda slow. It might be better to spread out the system logos more and up his speed a bit.   All this said, this is by no means my area of expertise, so take my comments with a grain of salt.  I really liked the intro man! Keep up the amazing work. :)"

But he has to take time to get it in the reflection, meanwhile John can shoot someone, turn around, hit someone just as quick, then a random bird, then someone to his left, all within less than a blink of an eye.  If I could see video of him hitting several targets surrounding him in a 360° radius, and he hits them really quick, then I would be willing to dismiss my theory as ""Humanly Possible"""
GameTheorists,2v4tqa,Samthefab,1 point,Tue Feb 10 04:15:47 2015 UTC,"Well, if there's any doubt in your mind if it's physically possible or not, it is.  This video proves that it's physically possible.  If you notice, he doesn't take aim when he shoots in the video.  He literally hipfires.  As soon as the gun is out, he shoots, and puts the gun away.  This means he uses the gun as an extension of his hand.  This also means he could probably shoot a target behind him fast enough to mimic Dead Eye.  The only question that remains even after showing video proof that it's physically possible is being able to know all of the targets ahead of time, because technically ""time"" slows down as he acquires targets.  This is physically possible as well, although highly unlikely.  Having keen enough senses.  Hearing, sight, smell.  You can find a target with these three senses.  Add in a bit of adrenaline for a time-slow effect, and you're golden.  Yes, Dead Eye is physically and humanly possible.  Any human we know? Probably not.  But definitely possible."

GameTheorists,2uyzc9,Bsharpmajorgeneral,6,Sat Feb 7 05:38:24 2015 UTC,"Add the fact that Yoshi regularly CONSUMES his ""fellow Koopas"" and there might be even more reason for resentment between the two clans."
GameTheorists,2uyzc9,Empolo,2,Fri Feb 6 23:07:57 2015 UTC,I didn't even think of that! And the koopas give Yoshi's powers to so it makes sense for them to eat Koopas...that an awesome point!
GameTheorists,2uyzc9,Empolo,2,Sat Feb 7 05:38:15 2015 UTC,"Another point to consider is in SMW every fortress and castle in the game doesn't allow Yoshi to enter.  He can be brought with for every other level in the game, including underwater and ""sky"" type levels.  However upon reaching a fortress or castle Yoshi is asked to stay behind.  It's not hard to see how much easier these levels would be with a yoshi, but instead he stays behind.  Perhaps it's because Yoshi thinks it best for Mario to prove his worth, alone, against Bowser.  Yoshi is testing to see if Mario is really good enough to be an ally, or perhaps this is the small amount of hope or Yoshi.  Perhaps the Yoshi's plan to turn the fight against Bowser over to Mario entirely."
GameTheorists,2uyzc9,Elusive2000,2,Tue Feb 10 05:14:35 2015 UTC,"Considering the Yoshis nature is very gentle and kind, it might be that they don't like fighting when they don't have to. In all of their games they fight either to protect someone or to protect their island (at least I think that's the case) Yoshis probably ferry Mario around to help him, but when they get to the castle they feel like he can handle it himself without any help. Thus, avoiding any unnecessary conflict.   Yoshis are brave and will go to great lengths to protect something they love. But are probably too passive to go out of their way to fight if they feel they don't need to (just look at the Yoshis in Paper Mario, they could have all joined forces with Mario to fight, but didn't because they trusted him to take care of the problem.)"
GameTheorists,2uyzc9,ArgentIV,1 point,Tue Feb 10 06:38:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not too familiar with the Paper series, so considering this new information I'd have to say I agree.  Perhaps that's why (IIRC) in PM:TTYD the one small yoshi decides to help Mario, but the other Yoshi dont? (I really need to play the paper series don't I). It makes me wonder then concerning the Paper series how all the other normal ""baddies"" have no association with Bowser.  Perhaps because this is a different point in the time line where the reign of Bowser hasn't taken over yet? Or perhaps it's a case of some of the once peaceful inhabitants decided that what Bowser dreams of is for the better of the Mushroom kingdom, and that they'd rather side with him.  Who knows.  Still, this is a solid theory."
GameTheorists,2uyzc9,Struwwl,1 point,Tue Feb 10 18:24:23 2015 UTC,"In Paper Mario Thousand Year Door the Yoshi you find is still a baby in an egg. He's about to be cooked (while he's an egg,the cook doesn't know he's a yoshi) until he escapes and joins Mario. That Yoshi has a very different mentality then most, which is that he likes to pick a fight (something many other Yoshis don't do). Also, in this game, Mario is far FAR away from Yoshis island and the Mushroom kingdom. The fact he found a Yoshi egg at all is interesting because Yoshi's are not native to that land as far as we know (and if they are, Mario never encountered them.)  The baddies are more like, street thugs, and in the original it made sense that everyone was attacking Mario because they WERE Bowers minions. But in Thousand Year Door they are far away from the Mushroom Kingdom and Bowsers Kingdom. So they're mostly fighting in an area where everyone KNOWS who Bowser is, but he isn't their ruler, you know? So most of the common enemies are just things looking to pick a fight.  But yeah, you should totally try playing the paper mario series. It's a great series and a lot of fun! :D"
GameTheorists,2uyzc9,Struwwl,2,Tue Feb 10 20:57:43 2015 UTC,For some reason I read the title wrong and thought you said Yoshi was Mario's arch nemesis...  Whoops.
GameTheorists,2uyzc9,Struwwl,2,Sun Feb 8 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"Good theory, but what about Super Mario 64, where Bowser takes the castle and traps Mario, Luigi and Wario, leaving Yoshi perfectly fine?"
GameTheorists,2uyzc9,Cardboard_Boxer,2,Fri Feb 6 23:25:54 2015 UTC,"In the original Super Mario 64 Yoshi was a hidden character at the end of the game. Someone (presumably the Toads) told him to hide up there to wait for Mario. (Ignoring his message from the game developers, seeing as that creates a break the fourth wall moment) Note he says 'I'd almost given up hope!' when Mario reaches him. It's possible he couldn't help Mario because he knew Bowser would trap him (its also been a long time since their last adventure together).  In the remake the others are lured because they are invited while Yoshi is sleeping on the castle roof (Well, Mario is invited, I'm assuming he invited Luigi and Wario to come with him). And since Yoshi is missing and randomly sleeping on Peachs roof, its possible that Mario couldn't invite Yoshi, and therefor, Bowser couldn't trap everyone in one fell swoop (Which was probably his plan) because Yoshi wasn't home.  And considering that Yoshi states in the original 64 game that it's been a while since his and Mario's last adventure, its possible that Bowser just kind of forgot about how much of a threat Yoshi was or had no idea where Yoshi was. Or where to even start looking. At least thats my theory."

He does not work for the combine, since he actively seeks to thwart their purposes.

GameTheorists,2uxm4r,EpicSmith,1 point,Sun Feb 22 14:25:01 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed this theory but I thought I should bring up a couple things.  Firstly, there's Luigi's diary in Paper Mario. Luigi makes several mentions of being jealous of his brother and comments on how scared he is of boos. Several of the entries, although mostly unrelated, make Luigi seem somewhat goofy and innocent.  Secondly, in Mario and Luigi: Dream Team, Mario enters Luigi's dreams and briefly hears several of Luigi's thoughts. These thoughts include phrases such as ""Big bro, please take me with you!"", ""Big bro! I can help!"", ""My bro is the best!"" and ""We're all here for you bro... always."" These are Luigi's innermost subconscious thoughts, showing just how much he cares for and even idolizes his older brother.  Finally, let's talk about Luigi's Mansion. As stated by Luigi himself in his diary, he's terrified of ghosts. Yet, Luigi is willing to take on an entire house full of them, by himself, to save his brother. Also, the moment he finally finds his brother, Luigi actually sheds a tear or two, relieved at finding his brother safe and sound.  All of this paints Luigi not as a manipulative puppet-master, but rather as a sweet and devoted younger brother, constantly living in his brother's shadow. In my opinion, Luigi is the nicest person in the entire mushroom kingdom,"

And now, on a very fateful evening, MatPat's face would appear on news channels around the world. The story? ""Internet Theorist Lost in Time."" You see, MatPat had been working on revisiting the first episode of Game Theory. He knew that there was a severe lack of good information in his episode on the time travel in Chrono Trigger, so he decided to make some tests. Working in secret, Matthew spent an entire year in a labratory in Portugal designing a machine to create a ""Time Gate"" like the ones in Chrono Trigger, and he was actually successful. Without thinking beforehand, MatPat stepped into the time gate and lost consciousness. It was the year 1908. MatPat awoke on the throne of newly-crowned King Manuel II of Portugal, who had just moments ago committed suicide. Somehow fully understanding the situation, MatPat knew that his destiny was to take over Manuel's place in history.

If there are no other parasites on the moth she will have few sons and many daughters, so that she maximises her total children. If there are other parasites nearby she will increase her sons, to stop other males from having children and making her sons have more children. The incense can be seen as some form of this.

Redstone torches can not be turned back into redstone, to the extent of my knowledge, so we have no way of determining if there is a change in composition of the original mineral and a sufficiently unstable substance would easily be able to power all of the minecraft creations.    Radium could be one such element, as it is conductive, highly unstable, and glows, due to the amount of alpha and beta particles it releases, causing the air to ionize in sufficient quantities.  It is also found naturally underground, although in quantities far smaller than found in game.  It even glows red, when exposed to a sufficiently hot flame, but under normal circumstances, it is silvery and glows blue, if at all.    So, if Steve distilled all the radium he found into hyperlethal quantities, left them around the world in amounts sufficient to kill off all surrounding life for eons, kept them burning under a several thousand degree flame, and created the universe's smallest nuclear reactior, then yes, redstone could exist."

Cobblestone : There is no official record of it being anywhere. It could be a museum located in france,but personally I think it's more likely to be in england (Since the owner of the castle is lord William)  inferno seems to be inspired by California Missions in San Juan Capistrano (USA california).  Mirage is likely a middle eastern styled city.  Nuke is in Harz, Germany  Overpass is based on a canal overpass set in Berlin, Germany.  Train : This one is also not known,but since the terrorists are balkans and there is a mosiac of lenin on a building. I think its save to assume that this is somewhere in russia or berlin.  Vertigo : This one is once again,not known (Go figure it being a skyscraper and all).  However In CS:GO, some .NAV file areas are named ""50th floor"" and ""51st floor"", hinting that the skyscraper has 51 stories.

It's like: 'I'm the best!'--I'm not the best animator, I'm not the best editor, I'm not the best modeler, I'm not the best anything. But I'm the best at all those things that I do. So, really, the only thing that I can say is that I'm the best Monty. Be who you are, and be the best at it.""--Monty Oum     I never got the chance to meet Monty, but boy did I want to. I wonder how many people remember just how nuts Monty's success story was way back in '07.  Here's this twenty-something high school dropout that, on a whim, spends two months animating a kick ass CG short film that features a brawl between Masterchief and Samus--It goes viral, he lands a job at Midway and still devotes his freetime to animating kick ass video game fight films for the internet. Even before RvB and RWBY, Monty was an online legend.      Right when Haloid was hot off the press GameTrailers did a 3 part series called ""Deconstructing Haloid"". It featured Monty going through a bunch of Haloid's scenes piece by piece, talking about some of the small flourishes he threw in and pointing out some of the corners he cut. Seeing the guy behind Haloid talk about his own project really inspired me when I first saw that series. It's weird to say, but I might never have started DNSQ if I hadn't stumbled across ""Deconstructing Haloid"" back in the day. It honest-to-goodness had that much of an impact on me when I was younger. I rewatched the first part of it just last month while working on the Smash Bros episode of Game Theory.     Monty's story really served as an exhortation, urging anybody and everybody to just go out and create unique things--and it's a bitter sweet kind of wonderful seeing so many people honor his death by doing just that, going out and creating unique things."

""designed for Black Mesa scientists to protect them from radiation, energy discharges, blunt-force trauma during the handling of hazardous materials.""   The least amount of materials that could be used for radiation is protection is 1 centimetre (or 0.40 inches), but that is only Halving thickness. The lethal dose of radiation is around 500 doses/500 cGy. Quick fact: cGy means centrigray, and a single centrigray is equal to one rad.  For the suit to survive an electrical discharge would be difficult. The most effective way to survive on is a lightning rod, but I doubt Gordon Freeman was a unicorn wearing football boots. Any way, if it was on... virtual steroids, it would be a wireless power transfer, WPT can often be see as Qi charger. So, if this was boosted to such levels, such as a lightening rod and the HEV suit battery. This would make sense in the lores of the land (sorry) because from what I can remember and tell from this noise, the suit recharges from a system of wireless. So protecting the suit through how it charges would make sense... like a firewall running on a generator that the firewall protects.   Blunt force trauma can be bruising, abrasions, lacerations. So, a stab vest would probably protect that. Probably being the word.  So, Gordon Freeman would be a knight in shining black armour.   * Edit: words... Lotta words."

However, he needs to be massless, or he must possess infinite energy. Considering Light Speed Attack allows him to hit his targets and damage them, he's not behaving like photons. I doubt he has infinite energy as well, considering it's only brief.  Sonic could be the strongest, simply because he is the fastest, but this ""hypersonic hedgehog"" would have a low-end speed of Mach 5. With his mass being 35 kg. and traveling five times the speed of sound, he wouldn't be able to harm Samus that way, since using her speed booster and with a mass of 90 kg. (ignoring the armor, which I calculated to be 149.93 kg.), she experiences more newtons unscathed.  I've also calculated Samus' power bomb to produce at least 14 tons of TNT. While we can have gods and goddesses, feats should tell us who is the strongest, or most powerful, or whatever, not titles."

GameTheorists,2ub3xj,Taximadish,3,Sat Jan 31 23:58:53 2015 UTC,"Well then it would be what /u/soandso2 said. Palutena is a literal goddess, so in theory, she'd be the strongest.   If we took it as in just in-game, then it could be Ganon or Bowser, or perhaps the psycho Mario. It certainly is an interesting idea, and just looking at the characters stories is only part of what makes them a tough competitor.   Mario, for example is a plumber that has taken on Bowser several times and killed many a goomba (Sorry Gaijin).   Each iteration of Link has killed several tough bosses, and in some cases the same boss more than once.  Pit is an angel, so technically, he can't die (since he's already dead) making him more powerful than most other characters within the Smash Bros character list, even if he can't fly without Palutena's help.  Characters such as Mewtwo (an upcoming DLC character) and Charizard are Pokemon, and they can be revived easily at Pokecenters and whatnot.   Honestly, I think, if it was down to just the theory behind it, Kirby would be the strongest, as he could just eat EVERYONE and no one could stop him, except for maybe Palutena."

If Sonic can attack at such high speeds and not break every bone in his body on impact he is obviousy quite strong, and if he can light dash at 3 mill m/s then the air around him would undergo nuclear fusion (since the high speed increase the collisions between particles, increasing heat and melding the molecules together), but captain falcon set the air on fire when he punches, another attack that should deal large power due to extreme speed."

Axes would probably beat lances due to the history of the axe end of halberds being used to cut the tips off of pikes in battle (if I remember properly).

GameTheorists,2u89h8,sarinomu,1 point,Fri Jan 30 23:25:22 2015 UTC,"As someone who has used and defended with all three types of weapons (ok, they were made of foam, but the basic concept and technique is still the same). Let me give my two cents.  First up, the sword. Swords are weak against lances and strong against axes. The sword is strong enough that a good strike to a lance during a thrust can move the lance aside leaving an opening to charge said soldier. However, most lancemen are used to this and can move they're weapon into your guard and allow you to run yourself through. Swords versus axes is a different story.  Most axes are heavy and slow, while swords are lighter and quicker. Most people have already pointed this out and are correct. But I'm not going to focus on this aspect. Someone has already pointed out that pirates in-game use two small axes, this presents a whole new beast to tackle. In this scenario the swords range, stab attack, maneuvering ability, and blocking ability are its advantages. A swordsman may slip the tip of his blade past the slower axes and into his opponent.  A sideways slash can be altered and and even withdrawn to avoid a successful block. Swords' blades also give more grace to an inaccurate block than an axe.  Axes pack more punch than swords do, and are consequently more affective against lances. If I used real metal weapons spears would be easily broken by a good two handed axe. Two one handed axes however could trap a lance and get inside it's guard as they would probably be too light to break one."

The whole time dilation aspect is part of his theory where the Super Mario series is actually made up of several cycles of the universe. Rosalina touches upon this vaguely at the end of the game but never explicitly states it."
GameTheorists,2u5j57,Sgtdante,1 point,Fri Jan 30 18:31:38 2015 UTC,"Well, it's unlikely that they're sisters purely because Rosalina is stated in the games to ""only visit her home world every 100 years"". and she's seemingly had several visits. Which basically proves the time dilation theory, since she's a normal person and not a God or anything... So travelling from a multiverse (as detailed in the video, watch it again, it's pretty good) would actually make some amount of sense (again, see the video for teh double Luigi) . There is the chance that in another incarnation of the universe they could have been sisters, but that's just a less interesting theory as it doesn't provide an answer to the ""who is her mother?"" question... We'd still just shrug our shoulders and say ""we may never know."" That and her back story mentions a brother, and not a sister. The answer to the whole ""Who is Rosalina's mother""? was the big question about her back story. With the data provided the sister angle is boring by comparison, and doesn't give us any more details about her past. Which is probably why it wasn't discussed. Mat did put in a brief reference to the fan theories but rather than baseless speculation there appears to be actual evidence that Rosalina is Peach and Luigi's child, even if you think it is a stretch.   And with Pokemon the Multiverse thing is blatantly stated in game. Link cables open portals to other worlds. This is the whole subplot of the delta episode. Which is why every cartridge is it's own world, every cartridge is the story of Brendan/May defeating Team Aqua/Magma on route to becoming the Pokemon master. But each ""Alternate reality"" is similar but not the same, some Brendan's might favor water types, and some might go for ghosts. It's the same world in every game, just slightly different based on the choices the characters make. Literally a multiverse theory. And trading with these ""Link cables"" (even thought it's wireless now) is literally transporting Pokemon between alternate, but similar, realities.   Mat isn't bending time and space to make theories fit, he's taking the data we have available and using that to come to conclusions that might seem far fetched but do fit with the established lore of the games. Just so happens these games bend time and space in their subtext, which might make the theories seem outlandish.   It's all just a theory, theories aren't meant to be canon. And unless 'Word of God' gives you a definitive answer you'll never know for sure. Best just to roll with is and enjoy them for what they are, fan Theories."

And it was the multiverse episode that made me see it too. And you're right, not that he's bad, going downhill, or anything about his contents enjoyment, but that he's started to, get into things that aren't just Link being dead, or Mario being a psychopath. I hope the next theory (not including the stoner episode, which I didn't watch because I'm not a MGS fan), is a little more like his old, grounded episodes. But that's just an opinion, A REDDIT OPINION!  Thanks for reading.  Tl;dr: OP is right."

GameTheorists,2u5j57,LokiAlpha,1 point,Fri Jan 30 15:55:52 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna be honest with everyone here: After I heard their was a subreddit for Matpat's videos, I decided to follow it thinking it would lead to more intriguing theories on video games.  Remember, it's just a theory.  Theories don't have to make sense at all.  The point of making a theory is to brainstorm possible ways something can be the way it is.  Now, with that said, the only posts that I seem to ever see on this subreddit(and this may be due to my own fault of rarely checking it) always seem to be bashing Matpat's videos / theories.  Don't get me wrong, I understand you're a fan of his videos, but they are theories.  Scientific theories, most of the time.  As you quoted ""literally bending the rules of space and time to suit his theories"" is an outright lie.  Unless you're trying to say he's bending the rules of space and time of a video game.  You can technically make anything the truth with that logic.  What he actually does is he tries to relate the video game worlds to our own world, and the scientific theories that are currently in place as we know them in reality.  The Rosalina not aging by travelling through space at the speed of light is backed up by a real scientific theory.  The theory being the faster you travel the less you age because time slows down.  He explains this in the video.  This is a real theory in the reality of our world regardless if you wanna believe it's true or not.  And as some one else has stated, the pokemon theory has game lore tied to it that literally tells you that you connect to different universes through the ""link cable"".  I'm honestly thinking of unsubbing from this subreddit due to posts like this, because it seems like this subreddit just keeps on upvoting posts that continuously bitch about how Matpat makes his videos, instead of coming up with really good theories or counter-theories to what matpat has given us.  Instead of saying ""Do you really think that makes sense?"" say ""This is why your theory makes no sense: (insert theory here)"".  You aren't being constructive at all with this post, and it just makes the subreddit look worse in my opinion."
GameTheorists,2u5j57,LokiAlpha,0,Fri Jan 30 16:03:18 2015 UTC,"My problem isn't that matpat does these crazy over the top theories. My problem is him preferring these theories over the much more sensical ones. I don't care if time dilation is a true scientific phenomenon, it doesn't make more sense than ""they're sisters.""  And saying you shouldn't criticize him because he's just an Internet show is extremely silly. If that were the case all online content would be crap. You only get good by improving, and I believe game theory could improve. I want to let the content creator know my thoughts on his content, and how to make it better. I do it because I'm a fan and I want to get my opinion out. This IS constructive criticism, it's a clear ""here's what isn't great, here's a way to fix it"" it isn't ""this sucks."" Trying to make me out to be the bad guy who is just hating only to hate is annoying to say the least. I only want to improve game theory, as a FAN. And fans get the creators to listen to them through forums like this. If you don't have a problem with what I complained about or believe my complaints are unfounded, then tell me why, but don't say I don't have the right to make complaints."
GameTheorists,2u5j57,saintjimmy64,1 point,Fri Jan 30 23:12:21 2015 UTC,"I never said you shouldn't criticize anyone.  But criticizing some one and constructively criticizing him are two different things.  You haven't constructively done anything other than say ""His videos are over the top"".  They aren't.  They are more interesting tackling the theories you don't expect.  What good is watching something where you're like ""Well, that's obvious.""  Instead he tackles things that make you say ""I never thought of it that way, but that makes sense, and could work.""  No offense meant, but I just don't think you have a clue what you're talking about, whether you're a fan or not."

I said he sometimes goes over the top with it. I didn't say he always did. I wouldn't have stuck around for the past 2 years if I didn't like his videos. I believe some of his videos aren't as good as others, but I still like his videos. I don't have to praise him for everything he does to be a fan. If EVERY video turned into him saying that any little quirk in a game was the cause of wormholes, then I would consider leaving. But as it stands, it's just a quirk I hope he stops (or at least backs up with better evidence), but not a deal breaker."

GameTheorists,2u55wu,Taximadish,1 point,Fri Jan 30 00:32:03 2015 UTC,"I thought that Hylia was actually created by the original 3 goddesses to babysit the world, as it were. I can't find any sort of source on that, though. It's only ever said that the 3 goddesses left the triforce in her care, so she already existed, and never left.  That said, I still don't think she has a triforce piece, simply based on the fact that the triforce was left in her care. Which means that she never departed the world. Ocarina of Time says that the triforce appeared at the point where the goddesses departed the world - Hylia never left, so no triforce for her.  However, while she definitely has never had a triforce piece associated with her, what would happen if she did depart the world? Maybe then a fourth triangle would appear. Maybe the existence of four pieces would mean that the  tri tetraforce shards would actually become square?! But that's just a theory."
GameTheorists,2u55wu,Petrichor02,1 point,Sat Jan 31 02:24:25 2015 UTC,"We've seen the Triforce being created in both OoT and TP and it only consisted of three pieces in both of those scenes. So unless we argue that those scenes were just metaphors rather than what actually happened, we have to conclude that there isn't a fourth piece (unless it was created later).  But Hylia being a goddess doesn't really guarantee her a Triforce piece. The Zelda series has other goddesses too. There's the goddess of sand, the goddess of time, the Fortune Goddess, the goddess of spirits, and the mountain goddess (and there's several other gods as well).  So it really wouldn't make sense for Hylia to get her own piece simply because she's a goddess when there are all these other potential goddesses out there who most likely don't get their own pieces."
GameTheorists,2u55wu,Petrichor02,1 point,Sat Jan 31 02:27:58 2015 UTC,"Isn't Hylia the appointed goddess of time? and also I dont know about the other gods so correct me if I'm wrong, but are they all from Hyrule?   Hyrule isnt the only land explored in the zelda franchise, theres also Termina and New Hyrule (Post Flood)   If those are gods from different lands then that land would have a different creation story with its own gods"
GameTheorists,2u55wu,Petrichor02,1 point,Tue Feb 3 02:58:51 2015 UTC,"We actually don't know who the goddess of time is. It might be Hylia, it might be Nayru, it might be some unnamed goddess. Hylia is just one of the theorized identities of the goddess of time.  All of the other goddesses are technically from Hyrule (except maybe the goddess of spirits), but the mountain goddess is from ST Hyrule, while the goddess of spirits resides in the spirit realm (possibly because she was pulled in there by Bellum, possibly because that's just where she normally lives; if it's the latter, then it depends on whether the spirit realm can be considered a part of Hyrule).  Wouldn't foreign lands that exist on the same planet have the same creation story as Hyrule? Also, one of the most popular theories for Termina's creation (and the story as told by Nintendo's official Zelda site) is that it was created by Din, Nayru, and Farore by accident when they were creating Hyrule."
GameTheorists,2u55wu,Matthias720,1 point,Tue Feb 3 03:07:53 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, Din, Nayru and Farore are only ever documented as creating Hyrule (Ill have to double check my hyrule historia on that) where as you speculate Termina was created by accident, (which is plausible) it does not account for other lands that are found in the games such as Spirit Tracks."

GameTheorists,2ty6ld,Crusnic002,1 point,Wed Jan 28 10:00:08 2015 UTC,"It is possible, it just has many factors that need to happen. Depending on how the vaults were made, they may or may not be usable. If they used lots of concrete and lead when making them it would make it possible to live underground in them, since it is hard for the radiation to seep into concrete and the layers of soil and rock from the underground part would also provide layers of protection. Another question would be the number of bombs and the areas they were dropped. One bomb in the center of america would not cause instant death, but several bombs being dropped everywhere would decrease the chances of survival even underground. Overall it is possible for survival, and we do currently have at least one place that would definitely provide shelter: CERN. At CERN they have special bunkers to try and catch Neutrinos, which are particles that go through almost anything. However, by using substances such as concrete and large quantities of water they are able to prevent neutrinos from escaping these bunkers. They would therefore make ideal places to hide during a nuclear winter, and would stop everyone from dying of radiation poisoning. There is also a place in I believe Sweden (though it may be somewhere else) where scientists have designed a bunker for protection against nuclear war, and are using it to store seeds and flowers that would not be able to survive such a war.  However, the ones in Fallout seem unlikely, since the time between the war and you running around fighting mutants does not seem enough to allow the nuclear winter to end. Basically, you would be dead when you walked on the surface, and all the water would be completely toxic, causing a slow death to anyone who drinks it."
