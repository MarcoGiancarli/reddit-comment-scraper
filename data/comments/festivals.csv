Travel from Austria should not be expensive either and it's 3 nights, which is not more than the rest in your list. Is there anything else holding you back in regards to it? I think it's the best except for Outlook, but that would be way more expensive and time consuming in terms of travel."

From the moment I walked in I felt loving vibes from everyone and people were partying hard in the downpour!  I was there alone and during that hour without any music I decided to adventure through the campground to meet some new people.  I ended up running into a girl I met at Electric Forest, totally random and amazing!  She introduced me to all of her friends and we danced in the rain and mud until the end!  What an amazing experience, thank you Do Lab :)"

The crowd was pretty big, I got semi-close, realized how bad I fucked up, started to exit on left of stage, finally got out of the crowd and started to really freak out. I made my way back in to find her and remembered she had a glowstick (which were banned at this particular festival). I was able to find her because of that. So I think this could work well if one person agrees to be stationary should you all separate. My phone was dead so I would have really been screwed."

I barely got checked while going through security, didn't experience any disorganization whatsoever. Only bad aspect to the entire festival was moving my shit into the camp grounds. But it was there first time hosting a festival of this size at this venue. Cut them some slack, they'll work it out by next year. People just love to complain, starting to think its a generational thing"
festivals,3dtbyw,NoWorries13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:57 2015 UTC,"Nailed it on the head my friend, such a generational thing. Bisco was an absolute blast this year and the music was on POINT. The water park was awesome, zip line option/ski lift rides were a nice touch and fairly reasonable. I will say prices by the main stage were steep for vending but it's an actual venue so what do you expect. Wednesday was disorganized because they decided last minute to open up a day early likely based on demand by us and I'm sure didn't expect to have 75% of attendees show up that day. I arrived around 1230 Thursday afternoon and waited about 45 minutes for car search and 15-20 for the shuttle. I've heard at past biscos too people waited for 12+ hours for Wednesday arrival so it's not new to this festival. And come on with the bitching about camping, if you did even the slightest it of research on peach and other festivals you would quickly find that it's rough terrain and a bitch of a hike up the later you arrive. Do your damn homework before complaining about something that was never a secret in the first place. Bunch of entitled, whiny little bitches our generation is."

festivals,3dtbyw,Iskandar11,24,Sun Jul 19 08:33:51 2015 UTC,"Camp Bisco is a festival started by the Disco Biscuits that seems to be notorious for attracting bad press, theft, overdoses, and wooks. It was held in NY for a while, didn't happen last year, and returned this year in PA. From what I've heard it has always been a little rough around the edges, but also one of the best fests for EDM. I went 2 years ago and enjoyed myself, but I also saw a lot of people beyond fucked up, having bad trips, and receiving medical attention. This year it seems to have completely gone to hell in a hand basket due to poor organization, gestapo-like security and rampant theft amongst vendors and campers. Many speculate that it will not return."
festivals,3dtbyw,poprocks360,6,Sun Jul 19 11:29:35 2015 UTC,"It really only got all the bad press and bad rep when they started booking EDM acts though, for the 10 years before that it was pretty low key and off the radar."

festivals,3drjfc,bluestofall,2,Sat Jul 18 19:37:59 2015 UTC,"When I went two years ago, no cash was used at the festival. You went to a booth when you first got there and put however much cash you wanted on a special credit card type thing. Every stand, booth and stall had a little scanner machine, so you could make transactions quickly. Plus, then you didn't have to worry about carrying cash. However, it made tracking it much more difficult. I don't believe I ended up spending anything crazy. My friend and I found the cheapest food stalls, and would get a filling meal for about 6 USD. Oh, and whatever cash is on the card you can redeem back into solid cash before you leave.  There is also a giant and incredibly convenient Auchan grocery store nearby, which we walked to everyday (yes, you can leave and re-enter as you please). At Auchan we stocked up on cheap food and cheap booze which we would sneak in. Getting our booze there saved a ton of money. Also, might be wise to grab a tent there beforehand if you guys will be needing one.   Bathrooms were portable but more like trailers of stalled toilets, and they had portable showers too. The showers were nice, and private, but I remember it being ice cold, so a good idea to take it during hot parts of the day. They also had a big internet tent filled with laptops free for use.  We left to go roam around Budapest a couple of times. Not sure if they still do it, but when we went our tickets also granted us one free entry to a choice of bath houses in the city. It was lovely to take a day off and do that and soak our tired bones.  The festival is absolutely enormous. There are a shit ton of food and drink stands, so I wouldn't worry about not finding stuff you like. Prepare for lots and lots and lots of walking. We camped right on the river, which was great since it was sweltering and we brought pool floaters with us. It was a great way to escape the heat."
festivals,3drjfc,littlefawx,2,Sun Jul 19 07:42:43 2015 UTC,"Oh man Sziget is awesome! To answer your questions:   how much you take obviously depends on what you are going to do, eat, and drink. I went with my girlfriend last year, and we ended up taking around £400 each (Brit here, you'll have to do the conversion if you need to) which covered us nicely for everything, but you could do it much cheaper if you wanted to. For example there is a supermarket about a 10 minute walk from the main entrance to the island, you will save a LOT of money if you get most of your food there rather than in the festival.  the camp looks basically like any other festival, except it's on an island with one bridge connecting to the mainland. It doesn't take long to get your head around where everything is, but it may be a good idea to find a map of the festival online to have a vague idea before you go. I'm not quite sure what you mean by ""how to manage food and drinks"" but as I said there is a supermarket very close where you can get everything from (but you have to sneak alcohol in, and they will check your bags as you re-enter the festival). There are also bars and food stalls all over the place. As I've already mentioned you are free to leave the island and explore Budapest, and I highly recommend you do. It has some great history, and a small tour can be done on foot in just an hour or so of the main sights. I very highly recommend you see the Shoes on the Danube Bank memorial, and just around the corner from that you have quite a few embassies and other interesting memorials. You can sign up to walking tours, but to be honest if you head to the brass shoes I mentioned the tours will walk past you and you can walk along with them.  The restrooms are like most festivals, but are generally very clean. They are located all over the island. There are also a few big shower tents located around the island with many cubicals with shower curtains (they aren't communal). These are generally hygienic, but there will be big queues unless you go early in the morning.   General tips?    When you enter the festival immediately get the sziget card, which is used to buy anything on the island. It's basically a touch pay-as-you-go debit card. You CANNOT pay with cash for ANYTHING on the island, so get one immediately as you enter or you'll be stuck in a queue full of hundreds and hundreds of hungry people. See the exhibits, they have great almost art-like installations and lots to do. Do as much as you can!  Don't laze around at your campsite, during the day if there is no one on you particularly want to see, still wander around the stages. Last year I wandered across a band who are now one of my favourite bands (Triggerfinger in case you were wondering) and had I been lazy I'd have missed out big time.  Try not to get the tent they sell at the festival, they are not very waterproof (but if you have to they aren't too bad unless there is heavy heavy rain). If there is heavy heavy rain they will replace the tent if it does leak badly, which is good of them.   Bet yeah I think that's basically it, I'm on mobile so sorry if my formatting is a bit shit. Obviously if they have changed things round since last yeah some of what I've said won't apply, but id imagine it'd be pretty much the same. If you have any other questions I'll try and answer."
festivals,3drjfc,CumshotsAtDawn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:48:22 2015 UTC,"Wow! Thanks, man! Really thorough and detailed, that is some nice advising, my man. So, just running it by again, I can get the normal drinks and food from the supermarket into camp easily but they will check for alcohol? I'm asking 'cause pouring tequila in a water bottle is almost foolproof, unless they sniff it (I could chug it like it's water in front of them as to avoid suspicion lol)."
festivals,3drjfc,Mezzezo,2,Tue Jul 21 20:30:10 2015 UTC,Get a citypass. You get to use public transport for free and get a discount on the the bathhouses. The bathhouses are really nice. And a good way to avoid the long waiting lines at the showers.   You'll have some spare time. Wander around the festival or Budapest. Budapest is a beautiful city.

festivals,3dsv03,PM_ME_UR_CUTE_BOOBS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:15:42 2015 UTC,"To the first point, why else would you be going to a festival in the first place besides the lineup....everything else should be secondary unless you're just going to get drunk and rage which I'd advise you to pass.   It would not, you're dancing for 12 hours and the fest ends at 11. Be generous and say you get out of the lot at 12 (which wont happen), drive home and get home at 3 according to your two hour trip. Sleep? Wouldn't even call it that since you'll want to leave by 8 to account for traffic so you'll all be running on 5 hours of sleep. Not advisable especially if engaging in party favors. I wouldn't advise sleeping in your car anywhere in America, carbon monoxide is real. Also as far as my knowledge goes the area around Pilmico (forgive my spelling) isn't the greatest. But that could differ depending where you were raised and think is ""ghetto"". Heard some people are people are looking at camping close to the festival but still do at your own risk.    Just my .02, but if you want more check out /r/MoonriseMusicFestival or the site."
festivals,3dsv03,Diesel_Train,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:32:42 2015 UTC,"There's not a whole lot crazy art or scenery (since it is at a race course) but last year I really liked it because it was a clean, well spaced out, friendly festival. It was a very comfortable time. I never felt crowded, even when I was close to the stages.    2-3. Stay in a hotel. Getting out is a clusterfuck.  I found some hotels close by for $60/night. You will need a parking pass if you are going to drive, which will be $50 for the whole weekend. The area is NOT NICE. I'm from a major city, all of my red flag alerts were going off walking around the streets surrounding Pimlico."

festivals,3dpjpl,ushmel,9,Sat Jul 18 05:14:33 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, this happened to me last Wednesday. I was at the Wiz Khalifa/Fallout Boy show, and one of my friends and I decided to go pee, right after Wiz.  We're walking to the porta potties, when I notice one girl failing to walk, stumbling with one arm over each of her two friends' shoulders.   I catch up to them, and ask ""Is everything okay?""   All three of them broke out in tears, talking at the same time. From what I gathered, she was having an asthma attack without her inhaler, she was having a panic attack, and she said she couldn't feel her arms or legs. I also thought she was passed dehydration.  I asked if I could help, and bent down to pick her up in my arms. I jogged from the pit, allll the way to the back, taking to her the whole time. I told her she could hold my hand if she wanted, as I asked her name, who she came to see, if she liked Wiz, if she got to smoke during his set, etc. Anything to keep her mind off of her state and help calm her down, as well as reminding her to breath relaxed.  When we reached the back, I set her down on the ground. I told her friends to stay there, my friend to go get Gatorade, and I was getting help.   I found two police officers. The first was stingy, insisting that ""The venue has first aid for a reason, I don't think that's our job. They didn't even give us walky tal-"" before I cut him off, turning to his partner to say, ""Go. Get medical attention here, IMMEDIATELY.""  The cop nodded, and jogged off. I came back to the girl, Hannah was her name, I think. She had been sipping on Gatorade, and a stranger offered a few hits from her inhaler.  I sat down next to Hannah, and threw my arm over her shoulder. She was shaking, and chilled. She reminded me that she couldn't feel/move her arms or legs, so I asked her to hold my hand and squeeze it. ""See, honey? You're moving your hand. You're okay, Hannah: in through the nose, out through the mouth.""  She got worse. She stopped talking. Now, she was just staring forward. Her eyes looked lifeless, and her head was slowly tilting back. She was going unconscious.  I put my hand on the back of her head, and begged ""Hannah, baby, let me see your eyes. Can you look at me, please?"" As she came to, I continued, ""Oh, there you are. Hi."" I said with a smile, as I started asking her random questions, attempting to keep her awake.  Finally, the First Aid lady walks up with a wheelchair, and I help Hannah in to it.  The nurse told me I was welcome to come, but I said that, ""Unfortunately, I couldn't, as I had two more friends in the pit, drunk, and I'm their DD. I don't want them to get lost.""  Hannah's friends thanked me several times, and they were on their way. Then I nearly fainted.   I'm glad I was there for her. I'm upset nobody else tried to help her.  Also, I regret not giving them my phone number. I'd like to know if she's doing okay; I haven't been able to stop thinking about her.  On a side note, DON'T BUY DRUGS AT FESTIVALS.  There's no way to tell if she was on something extra curricular, but you never know what a stranger is selling you. Don't forget that bath salts are still a thing."

festivals,3dpjpl,MischeviousCat,3,Tue Jul 21 13:04:36 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience last year, I was taking a break to my campsite and say a couple of girls wondering around with blank expressions, tripping over everything so i asked if everything was alright , no response so i guided them to my campsite sat them down gave them some water and food and stayed with them until they came down. Turned out they bought some ""molly"" of a guy they met the previous night, they gave me what they had left over so i tested it with my kit stuff was so impure that I'm surprised they didn't die."
festivals,3dpjpl,plump_hephaistos,2,Sat Jul 18 17:35:28 2015 UTC,Do you buy your test kits online? I've never used one but seems like it would be a good thing to have at a festival.
festivals,3dpjpl,TroyEdmund,2,Sat Jul 18 23:58:43 2015 UTC,"bunkpolice and dancesafe are two great organizations to order test kits from. They make an appearance at most large festivals.

I don't know the real answer either but Ive been to both festivals (last went in 08 of 09 though) and Floydfest is waaaay different than Allgood. A lot smaller, no security break between camping and stages,  not even a real shakedown street. Mostly food tents with a couple other vendors thrown in selling jewlery and CDs, yada yada. And a hairstylist too or something - girl I was with found someone to do her hair whIle we were there. And i dont recall seeong anyone trying to sell without an official setup, so you may stick out a bit (but again, things may have changed. Trying to sell glass almost certainly wouldn't fly as it's much more family oriented. I went 2 years in a row and only had one dude ask if I wanted drugs (mushrooms), and that was my camp neighbor.  But even if you can't sell the jewlery, it's in a great location and a lot of fun.  Maybe this helped? Sorry I can't answer your actual question but perhaps it shed some light on the scene at Floydfest."

festivals,3dk7ye,underrager,9,Thu Jul 16 23:00:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah so I did this at Rockstar mayhem fest like 3 years ago...crowd surfed after a serious mosh sesh while Suicide Silence was playing. Got dumped near the front with no security guards in sight so I said fuck it, lets hop the barrier! Got some random dude to boost me over and leapt up onto the speaker stage left only to have 3 security guards run over to me and try to claw me down. Except I'm 5'10 160 and these dudes are 6'4 250 so theyre having hella trouble climbing the speaker rig whereas I'm just jumping around, agile as fuck. Up there for about a minute and a half air-guitaring and headbanging before I lost track of the security guards. Turns out they got a female security lead to literally climb up and grab me by the tank top and throw me back down to the stage like 3-4 feet below. My drunk ass fall-stumbles around trying to get my bearings and BOOM! at least 4 security guards pin me down and drag me off backstage. On the plus side, I got a devil horns sign from their bassist and saw Dethklok backstage while I was waiting in the police tent. On the minus side, got kicked out of mayhemfest and banned for 2 years with a threat from the sheriff to book me for public intoxication and endangerment. All in all, solid hooligan experience.  tl;dr got boosted onto a speaker during Suicide Silence at mayhemfest, air guitared/headbanged until I got thrown out by security and the sheriff"

festivals,3djfw1,ahack12,2,Thu Jul 16 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"There are multiple public transit options to get there. You can take the canal street car or busses up esplanade. However when leaving you will be forced on busses back downtown. You will not be able to get a cab unless you have 4+ people riding.  Apart from that the festival is well organized and produced. I know nothing of the camping, but why would you camp there?  It is a load of funand I highly suggest it."

It was easy grabbing a cab there. Leaving we had to walk a couple miles and then hail a cab. I'd recommend renting a bike if available as they had bike racks out front. Oh and be sure to check out the after parties at Dragon's Den if you have the stamina, love that venue"
festivals,3djfw1,somuchsublime,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:02:18 2015 UTC,"Dude go stay at the NOLA jazz house. It's a hostel and it makes the trip a lot cheaper. You can jump on the tram thing right outside the front door and it will take you to the festval grounds. The crowds are really easy to move through and the way the set up the stages is really good to. Overall i thought it was awesome last year and would be going back again to see Chance the rapper but I'm going to Hulaween this year because its closer. If you like the lineup you should go. New orleans is one of the coolest city I've ever been too. So much good food, music and really cool people. If i were you i would stay a couple extra days just to look around the city. Every night after the final act me and my buddy would just grab a fat beer and peruse the town."

Some of the best festival grounds, great weather, great vendors, nola on Halloween is where it's at. Finding cabs at the end of the night is a pain. If you get in the early batch, sometimes you're alright...but they only ever wanna take ppl back downtown. Hit up the casino afterwards or a great bar :))  Would love to go this year but can't swing it. Had a fucking blast the last 2 years. All thumbs up."

If you are staying at one of Voodoo's partner hotels, I would recommend just buying the shuttle pass, too, because otherwise you'll be in traffic and looking for a parking spot for about an hour.  Production-wise, voodoo does a good job. They had an issue with sound bleed between stages, but they've since rearranged the stages and it wasn't too bad last year.  If you can, buy your tickets early to avoid Will Call! Last year, people were waiting in line for 2 hours just to get their tickets to get into the festival."

festivals,3diuey,etwake,4,Thu Jul 16 16:56:12 2015 UTC,"I assume the techniques are the same for pickpockets stealing wallets.  However, it is probably WAY easier at a festival as people are more trusting of strangers.  Remember just because you are at a festival doesn't mean that everyone is all ""good vibes"", there are crappy people everywhere.  The basic of pick pocketing is distraction, such as someone coming up and asking you for a cig / offering you water, someone bumps into you, that was his friend, they planned this and he stole your phone while you were talking to the first guy."
festivals,3diuey,DGMimic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Techniques are the same, but 0/1,000x I've been on the train me or my friends have been pick-pocketed.  4/20x I've been at a festival, someone's been pick-pocketed.  And after the show I always see a lot of people returning to the same area looking for lost phones.    I'm really curious about specific techniques used at festivals.  Seems like there is a much stronger presence."
festivals,3diuey,DGMimic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:25:53 2015 UTC,"Correct.  I was saying its probably the same techniques, like they are probably banking on people not being in the correct frame of mind, and they probably, honestly, just take it.  They know and understand people are a little more trusting / a little more out of their element.  If you want techniques like, ""well, I put a magnet on the end of fishing line and toss it onto their phone, then reel it in."" I don't know that those exist.  The police put out a study that stated that the vast majority of robberies are crimes of opportunity, being at a festival is very opportunistic, is what I meant.  Sorry for the confusion."
