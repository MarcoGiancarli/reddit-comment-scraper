I LOVE reading and every time I started reading LOTR I'd get distracted by other books and just forget to come back to it. I've gotten as far as (spoilers) Saruman's death. As soon as I'm done with the series I'm currently reading I plan on buckling down and finishing (restarting) those dang books! I love what I have read already and LOTR is one of my favorite stories so I will read/finish them soon! I'm currently doing a reading challenge on Goodreads to finish 15 books this year. It's only July and I've already finished 13.

lotr,3e1b6x,fxpstclvrst,6,Tue Jul 21 13:47:02 2015 UTC,I know exactly how you feel right now. I also tried to get my mother to watch Lord of the Rings with me but she always fell asleep during the movie because it is so long and we never got past Fellowship. So like you I also had to break the movies up into chunks. I also had to do this when showing the movies to other people. And honestly I actually find this to be a really good way of watching the movies. I find it allows people to take a break and recap what just happened and to answer some of their questions (I alway love it when they have questions). I get out my map and begin to explain stuff to them and they get really into it too. Its a really easy thing for people to bond around in my opinion.
lotr,3e1b6x,mathlete91,3,Tue Jul 21 05:38:12 2015 UTC,"Heh, it was my mom who got me into the Lord of the Rings in the first place. But that was long before the movies. She had book editions from the 60s. I'm not sure if she's seen the movies. She read me The Hobbit when I was like 8. I'm doing the same with my kids now. The movies are too violent for them still—the FotR isn't too bad but the others are. We are up to Isengard in the books though. They understand the difference between Huorns and Ents, at least! Almost back to Frodo and Sam, which they can't wait for."

lotr,3e1gte,thoroq,24,Tue Jul 21 05:50:42 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have the idea that you lose the Ring and you start aging. This is not true. It's not true of Gollum, and it's not true of Bilbo. Not until the Ring was destroyed. So the reason Gollum survived as long as he did while Bilbo had the Ring is the same reason Gollum survived as long as he did when he himself had the Ring: the Ring."
lotr,3e1gte,Uluithiad,5,Tue Jul 21 06:31:11 2015 UTC,Was it a mistake in the movies that Bilbo had shown to age when Frodo visited him after he arrived in Rivendell?
lotr,3e1gte,bdk1417,8,Tue Jul 21 14:32:36 2015 UTC,"It's hard to tell whether Jackson decided not to bother with the anti-aging properties of the Ring, or didn't understand them."
lotr,3e1gte,Uluithiad,3,Tue Jul 21 15:56:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I shouldn't have said ""mistake"" since perhaps Jackson interpreted it that way. Someone else pointed out that Gullum didn't freely give up the ring whereas Bilbo did."
lotr,3e1gte,bdk1417,5,Tue Jul 21 17:12:58 2015 UTC,"that Gullum didn't freely give up the ring whereas Bilbo did   That doesn't matter, though. It's an excuse some people made up to explain how it works in the movies, because the movies don't make sense."
lotr,3e1gte,Uluithiad,0,Tue Jul 21 17:24:58 2015 UTC,We just have to make more assumptions to fit the given data in the movie whereas less is specified in the book.
lotr,3e1gte,bdk1417,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:07 2015 UTC,"I kind of read it as Jackson worked ""backwards"" from Grey Havens for Bilbo's aging. He needed Bilbo to be 131 by the end of the movie, yet Jackson cut ~20 years from the narrative between ""Long Expected Party"" and Frodo getting to Rivendell.    Solution? Insta-age!  Gets Bilbo at the ""correct"" ages at the ""proper"" points in the film, but also sets the false expectation that once one no longer wields the Ring they start aging faster to catch up to their actual age.  Though irksome, I don't find it nearly as egregious as ""Sam, go home!"" I almost screamed at the movie, in the theater, when that little gem was uttered."
lotr,3e1gte,araquen,4,Tue Jul 21 18:35:16 2015 UTC,"But the seventeen years are not relevant. There is no indication that Bilbo aged during those years at any rate faster than he did when he had the Ring. He is described in exactly the same manner. He shouldn't look years and years older, whether you are using Jackson's protracted timeline or Tolkien's full one. That's the issue. He should look the same at Rivendell as he did at his party."
lotr,3e1gte,Uluithiad,2,Tue Jul 21 18:40:23 2015 UTC,"I think so.  Or maybe an intentional change to show that the Ring's influence over Bilbo was waning, although not totally gone.  I just read through the Many Meetings and Council of Elrond chapters and there's no mention of Bilbo looking older that I found.  It certainly was an inconsistency in the movies to show Bilbo ageing significantly while Gollum looks the same from the prologue to the War of the Ring."
lotr,3e1gte,tphelan88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:55 2015 UTC,The change would only occur after the ring was destroyed. You can't make the comparison between Bilbo and Gollum because they are very different circumstances.   Gandalf theorises that when the influence of the ring left both of them there was a chance that they could both live on and complete their lives.
lotr,3e1gte,Elliot850,3,Tue Jul 21 15:43:12 2015 UTC,How long do you have the ring for it to affect your age like that then?
lotr,3e1gte,Elliot850,11,Tue Jul 21 06:53:12 2015 UTC,"Well it started affecting Frodo instantly. It's mentioned that people noticed he shared his uncles longevity and youthful full, and that when he turned 50 they started to find it a bit weird."
lotr,3e1gte,Elliot850,2,Tue Jul 21 09:33:02 2015 UTC,"But had it for years as well. What would happen if, say boromir had taken the ring for like a day?"

lotr,3e1gte,TOTENKOPF_DER_SS,3,Tue Jul 21 15:40:12 2015 UTC,But would it affect his aging after he gave it back to frodo or otherwise lost possession?
lotr,3e1gte,mulletarian,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"IF this ever was to happen...and that is an impossible occurance...since he'd never give it up again while still living, I think once the ring has its hold on you, especially after being a ring bearer for however long, your fate would be tied to it. With Boromir, the ring's draw on him was so strong that he'd be a slave to its power for however long it goes on existing if he did manage to put it on. Essentially, he would never give it up, but IF it was taken from him and he survived, then no, I don't believe he'd age."
lotr,3e1gte,MagnusRune,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:36 2015 UTC,If Boromir had the ring for a day he would never return it.
lotr,3e1gte,dka2012,2,Tue Jul 21 17:46:38 2015 UTC,"It was my understanding that he had been with the ring for so long that it had become part of him, taken him over almost completely, his life was bound to it.

lotr,3e1qhn,man_aue,5,Tue Jul 21 07:49:01 2015 UTC,I would read first. That way you can develop with your own imagination and not be influenced by Jackson's. The Hobbit was the first book released. Start there then move on to LotR.
lotr,3e1qhn,italia06823834,5,Tue Jul 21 11:23:30 2015 UTC,"Hobbit (book) --> LotR (books) --> LotR (films) --> Hobbit (films)  I'll explain why.  The chronological order is Hobbit --> LotR. They just released the LotR movie first because it has a bigger and more epic story. My guess is they could only make the Hobbit movies because the LotR movies were such a success.  I would start with the books, because then you can create your own image of the characters and the locations first. You have only one opportunity to read the books for the first time!  Now the books came out in the ""correct"" order. The Hobbit is from 1937, LotR 1954/55. The Hobbit was written for children so it has a lighter tone than LotR. It was a success and there was a sequal (LotR) which has become Tolkien's most famous work. There is an introduction for people who have not read the Hobbit but I would read the Hobbit anyway, and then when you start LotR also read the foreword and introduction because it gives some insight in who the Hobbits are and how they live.  The LotR books are in three volumes but it's really one story. Read them in the correct order (Fellowship, Two Towers, Return of the King). If you liked the books you may like the Silmarillion or any of the other books mentioned in the reading list in the sidebar."
lotr,3e1qhn,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:10:14 2015 UTC,"Definitely read The Hobbit first then LOTR. The books are the story in its purest form.  Movies are artistic adaptations which take the key points and present them to an audience in a timely (some would argue here) manner.  There is an argument to be made for watching the movies first though.  If you've never read the books you'll quickly find out that Tolkien loves to paint pictures in your mind with vivid scenery detail.  He was a man in love with nature so he goes out of his way to make sure you know the surroundings in which the story takes place.  The movies, I thought, did a fantastic job of re-creating Middle-Earth.  New Zealand was an excellent choice of location to film the movies.  Watching the movies first then reading the books can help to enhance your imagination when it comes to seeing Middle-Earth in your mind's eye.  Just don't be upset when you read the books and find out that there are many, many things that were changed, left out, or completely made up.  The credits say ""Based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkien."""
lotr,3e1qhn,tphelan88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"Having just done this myself I would say READ the Hobbit first, since that book came out first. Then read Lotr.   The movies, however, should be done opposite. This is because the movies started with LOTR and then backtracked to the Hobbit as a ""prequel"" (which is next on my list)  When I asked a question here about the movies before, one person. Also pointed out that the lotr appendix at the end if the 3rd book clarifies some of the Hobbit  plot points. These parts of the appendix were apperently added to the Hobbit film, which is just more reason to read in the regular order and watch the other way."
lotr,3e1qhn,rtubbs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:37 2015 UTC,"If you can afford it, I highly suggest you get The Silmarillion (a prequel to both Hobbit and LotR) and read it before you get into the others.  Once you do that, go ahead and read The Hobbit -> Fellowship of the Ring -> The Two Towers -> Return of the King. Movie order is obviously the same, though if you also have doubts about the Hobbit movie order, that'd be An Unexpected Journey -> The Desolation of Smaug -> Battle of the Five Armies.  This might take you weeks, months or even over a year depending on how fast of a reader you are, so don't be afraid to watch the movies first if you wish to do so. It'll be an amazing experience either way.  Alternatively, you might want to check this recommended Tolkien reading list that's on the sidebar."
lotr,3e1qhn,Artanyas,5,Tue Jul 21 08:21:00 2015 UTC,"I highly suggest you get The Silmarillion (a prequel to both Hobbit and LotR) and read it before you get into the others.   Wow okay I don't want to seem rude but I totally disagree completely. The Silmarillion is dense and unfinished and is a very...unconventional choice for a first book. The writing style isn't at Tolkien's usual level of polish in the Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings. It drops proper nouns like (quite intentionally) the Bible and the details are about as hard to follow. It's also not really a ""prequel"" in the traditional sense. Throwing yourself into that if you're not already a fan could turn you off to more.  OP, my recommendation is that you start with the Hobbit (book), then do the Lord of the Rings (books), then do the Lord of the Rings (movies), then, if you really want more, do the Silmarillion and check out some of the other posthumous works. The Hobbit is easier to read, shorter, and more self-contained than LotR. It's a lot less epic and a lot more fun, so it makes a solid introduction. I think reading LotR first might make the Hobbit seem silly in comparison.  The Hobbit movies can be skipped."

lotr,3dzkqq,MagnusRune,3,Tue Jul 21 08:07:41 2015 UTC,"they did that when they did the initial edit. they make the green of plants in the shire look even more green. but it was in the theatrical version.  i have the Blu Ray, and its amazing quality. they fix some errors from the DVD version, ie watching the DVD on a good tv, you can see the black riders in the 1st movie, that the ''face'' area, is a different black to the cloth. and its where they painted over the faces of the riders. the blu ray, they fix it, so its one constant black, no obvious change.   also if you are from the EU or UK, you will be watching it at the proper speed, not sped up. the PAL DVD plays back at 25fps, but NTSC and Blu Ray, and cinemas play at 24FPS. so if like me you are used to the PAL DVD Extended, the Blu Ray will be like 50 mins longer across the 3 films"

lotr,3dyav5,v1rous,24,Mon Jul 20 15:02:37 2015 UTC,"Just visually, in my imagination:   Gimli's helmet and gear are more plain and less exaggeratedly ""dwarven"". Sam is less pasty. Aragorn and Boromir are more muscular. Especially Boromir, I basically see him as a bodybuilder or linebacker type guy. Denethor looks less like a grubby homeless person that someone wrapped in fancy clothes and more majestic... tall, thin, aquiline nose, basically very patrician. Merry and Pippin are younger."
lotr,3dyav5,dongazine_supplies,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:02:43 2015 UTC,"Yep, Sam is a gardener, so he would be outdoors a lot, surely?"
lotr,3dyav5,1EnTaroAdun1,13,Tue Jul 21 11:04:13 2015 UTC,"I imagined the hobbits as a bit rounder. Frodo a bit older (he is 50 when he leaves Hobbiton, but got the Ring at 33 so he shouldn't have aged much after that). Frodo is the oldest of the four Hobbits. In the films he looks like the youngest (of course some people just look younger than others).  There are plenty of characters that were not in the movies so you have enough to imagine. Some things are not really described so it's left up to the reader.   Now I understand they changed quite a bit to make it flow as a movie: they tried to make Sauron more visual because a movie needs a supervillain (as people often say on these boards, Sauron is not just a floating eye but has a body). Sauron is more a behind-the-scenes person which doesn't work so well in a visual medium. He is described as larger than a man but not a giant. So I imagine he is quite a bit smaller than what we saw in the films. He ""respawned"" his body after he was killed by Gil-galad and Elendil.  They also expanded the role of Arwen somewhat for the films, because LotR doesn't have that many female roles and a modern movie would need one (at least, the producers believed so). In doing so they removed the other Elves Frodo and friends meet. They also removed one of the most badass of Elves ever.  The movie people also seem to believe there needs a comic relief buffoon in every movie. In this one, it's Gimli. The Gimli of the books is a much more serious person. When you hear shouts of ""Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!"" you must run.  Another thing is that most main characters are nobility, and there is a class difference between the other Hobbits and Sam. Sam is a gardener, pretty much everyone else is either a noble of from an important family. Merry and Pippin belong to the most important families of the Shire, and Frodo is related to those families as well. Legolas is the son of the king, Gimli is related to the kings of Erebor, Aragorn is Isildur's Heir and will become king (I'm avoiding spoilers but this was in the movies) and Boromir is the son of the Steward which is as close to nobility as you get in Gondor if there is no king. Gandalf is the exception, but he is a Wizard and his origin is described in the Silmarillion.  Another thing I just remembered is that the Witch-king doesn't have a helm in the books, he has a steel crown. He also doesn't destroy Gandalf's staff, their confrontation is a bit different. The Witch-king is on a horse at that time, not on the flying beast.  I keep remembering little bits that were not in the movies: the Drúedain, the Glittering Caves, the Old Forest and Bombadil, Legolas and Gimli getting seperated during the siege. Make sure to read the appendices after you have finished the books. There are still some loose ends that are tied up after the main story ends. The ending is also somewhat different from the movies so you don't know what to expect."
lotr,3dyav5,ReinierPersoon,8,Mon Jul 20 18:17:11 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting point about nobility.  Western culture and media tends to downplay the importance of class in terms of character development, and I think that has carried into the way I'm reading the characters. I totally see how this can add to a character's motivations and sense of importance."
lotr,3dyav5,ReinierPersoon,4,Mon Jul 20 18:59:41 2015 UTC,"In one of the early chapters when they just left the Shire Pippin yells at Sam to get water and make breakfast. Frodo then kicks Pippin out of his makeshift bed. Frodo and Bilbo have fairly egalitarian views despite being somewhat posh themselves. None of the main Hobbits except for Sam seem to have a profession.  Sam was partly based on Tolkien's experiences during WW1 when he was an officer. The officers had personal assistants. Frodo is also more or less Sam's employer.  I just started a reread of LotR myself, I'm starting chapter three now."
lotr,3dyav5,swagger9000,24,Mon Jul 20 19:40:03 2015 UTC,"I personally think all the actors/Peter Jackson did a great job portraying the race/individual personalities of all the characters.  I was particularly impressed with John Rhys-Davies, amazing performance from an amazing actor."

The Lord of the Rings movies on the other hand, truly did live up to the prestige of the books(in particular the fellowship)."

lotr,3dyav5,ReinierPersoon,6,Tue Jul 21 02:55:57 2015 UTC,"I thought they were all pretty accurate except Sean Bean as Boromir. COMPLETELY wrong body type. I always remember how Boromir really proved himself carrying the hobbits through chest deep snow in the mountain passage. Being an imposing figure is also a good contrast to Faramir and helps to establish, in a physical sense, the differences between the two brothers. Having said that though... Sean Bean is such an AMAZING actor that I can completely accept him as Borimir. I'll take a great actor over a ""perfect type"" actor any day."
lotr,3dyav5,Thessela,8,Mon Jul 20 20:21:50 2015 UTC,How did he have the wrong body type? He looks like a sturdy guy. I'm not expecting bodybuilder types in a Medieval society.
lotr,3dyav5,ReinierPersoon,4,Mon Jul 20 20:31:04 2015 UTC,"Well it is my impression from the book, so I don't expect everyone to agree with me. But the way he is described and his strength, I picture a much thicker build. The best comparison I can make at the moment is Aragorn and Boromir as boxers. Aragorn would be a middle weight and Boromir the heavy weight. Both highly muscular strong fighters but noticeably different builds."
lotr,3dyav5,sitchmellers,5,Mon Jul 20 21:19:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, I got the impression from the books that Aragorn was a more lean person than Boromir. But I don't think (and I'm just guessing here) that people in a medieval society would be very muscular. The muscular hero look we see in movies can only be achieved by a ridiculous amount of weightlifting and good nutrition. I don't think they could achieve that in medieval societies, and they probably didn't need it as it doesn't take that much strength to swing a sword or stab someone with a spear."
lotr,3dyav5,Thessela,4,Mon Jul 20 21:35:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe think more strongman than bodybuilder. Athlete, even."
lotr,3dyav5,ToTheBlack,2,Mon Jul 20 23:24:42 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you and realize I am doing an utterly awful job of describing what I am picturing. While I do believe he is muscular, he would not be tone like a body builder. He'd have a stockier build with some ""meat on his bones"". The amount of traveling he does, and his skill at knowing how to prepare for these journeys I think would lend to this as well."
lotr,3dyav5,sakor88,4,Mon Jul 20 22:46:25 2015 UTC,"Aragorn is taller and more gangly. He's more standoffish. He can be intimidating and appear noble at times, but is largely someone you wouldn't like as a nearby stranger because he just frightens you.   Frodo is older, but Merry and Pippin are (relatively) young. Merry is more durable and reliable. Sam is the commoner and has some folksy wisdom going for him, I definately saw him as a reflective and quietly intelligent guy.   Gimili is to be taken seriously. He's not as comical. But the ""look"" was nearly perfect.   Boromir had more of a big linebacker type form. The movie did well, but Judas'd him too much so a lot of people focused too much on the bad. The Ring's corruption over him didn't undo all of the great stuff he did ... in the books he's easy to see as a tragic hero whose death had a profound impact on everyone.   Legolas. Well. The movie messed it up."

lotr,3dyav5,metruesta,7,Mon Jul 20 16:16:22 2015 UTC,"Another thing about Legolas...if the reader can get around picturing Orlando Bloom as Legolas, in the books it never specifically mentions his hair colour, so I find it helps to imagine him as a black or brown haired elf while reading, to try to lose the Bloom effect. Also, this has to do with personal taste, but Arwen is described as the most beautiful being in Middle-Earth and descended from Beren and Luthien, so obviously you can just picture what ""the woman of your dreams"" would look like."
lotr,3dyav5,ReinierPersoon,12,Mon Jul 20 19:45:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think Bloom did a bad job with Legolas at all, it was just that Legolas as written for the movies had very little to do and even less to say.  In the movies he seems to switch eye colour in some scenes."

lotr,3dyav5,ReinierPersoon,6,Mon Jul 20 20:09:35 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure in The Hobbit, King Thranduil is described as having blonde or golden hair. So it would make sense genetically for Legolas to share this trait."
lotr,3dyav5,Seafroggys,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:33 2015 UTC,"Well, actually — the one authentically Noldorin Elf in The Lord of the Rings is Galadriel. :-)  Most Elves had dark hair, to the point that if an Elf's hair color isn't mentioned, one should simply assume that it was dark. Elvish hair color only merits comment when it's not dark, like Galadriel's golden hair or Celeborn's silver. The one group of Elves that had a lot of fair-haired members was the Vanyar, who never returned to Middle-earth from Valinor.  Thranduil's lineage isn't clear, FWIW. I always assumed that despite his hair color, his son's hair was dark since it was never mentioned."
lotr,3dyav5,ebneter,2,Tue Jul 21 03:17:38 2015 UTC,"Galadriel is counted among the Noldor, but I think she is only 1/4 Noldor, 1/4 Vanyar and 1/2 Teleri.  Glorfindel was mentioned, but Gildor said he was ""of the House of Finrod"" so he is likely Noldo as well.  I agree with the hair colour comment. I think most hair colour is brown or dark unless it is stated as blonde or silver."

I love the movies, but when I read the books I picture the Hobbitses as  way more jolly.  Maybe it's because of all the songs and poems and mentions of meals, but even in the midst of darkness winning and all that, the Hobbits still came off as unaffected.  I know it's the strength of the One Ring that makes Frodo go bonkers with Sam, but in the books the Hobbits still seem more removed from any negativity.    The dwarves I also picture as differently in the books.  Still love the movie versions, and I get why in the HobbitS trilogy it's better to just scale Gandalf up than scale everyone else down, but there's no such restriction in the books.  I can picture them as stockier and grumblier all I want.  Also, this might be headcannon, but I read every dwarf as drunk the entire time."

lotr,3dv7ta,slapdashbr,7,Mon Jul 20 02:55:37 2015 UTC,"I think that's it exactly. I've noticed several Star Trek episodes that were written with current affairs in mind. Re-watching them 20 years later, there is a new issue or the continuation of an old one that makes them glaringly relevant. The same is true of Tolkien. Man has continued to struggle with the same demons for centuries and it doesn't matter how far we've come. We will still be tempted by old weaknesses and fictional worlds will be the safest method of reflecting on those struggles because we can work it out without having to take responsibility."

Well, the 3 rings that were given to them by Sauron were very powerful. So powerful in fact that they’re the reason behind the beauty of the Elvish cities, the rings preserved the cities and the Elves. However, the rings need the main ring, the One Ring to use their power. When the One Ring was destroyed, the Elven rings lost their power and so their cities would not be preserved which is why they had to leave!   wtf"

lotr,3dzl5a,estev90,8,Mon Jul 20 20:30:27 2015 UTC,"Of all the movie battles I think Helm's Deep was handled the best. The battle of the Pellenor Fields was wrapped up by green magic ghosts and not by the arrival of Aragorn and his reinforcements, unlike the books. It helps that I really like Théoden and the people of Rohan in the movies. You hear the strength return to Théoden's voice when he decides to ride out and break the siege. Good battles need a good buildup and ending and this one has it. At the end Gandalf and Éomer show up (should have been Erkenbrand, but I understand they didn't have time to introduce this random guy for one scene so they used Éomer instead).  I find the Pellenor battle less interesting because it was done better in the books in every way. The confrontation (or lack thereof) between Gandalf and the Witch-king. A rooster crows, doesn't care about the war. Then horns and the echoes of horns. Rohan has arrived! Again Théoden says what needs to be said and they reach a new phase in the battle. The ending is that Aragorn arrives and for the first time unfolds his banner, signifying the return of the king.   In the films they just have some green cannon fodder ghosts mop everying up.  A good battle for a movie would be the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, because the good guys lose badly. Fingolfin goes up to one of the most powerful beings in the world and holds out for a while, but dies in the end."

It's very much in the line of Everquest and WoW, so your response to games like that will inform you. I do like its art direction better than most MMOs, only ArenaNet's (Guild Wars/Guild Wars 2) beats it as far as MMOs go in my opinion.  For how faithful, I'd say it's the best of the computer/video games. Leagues ahead of anything from Warner Bros. or EA. There was more of an attempt to capture Tolkien's Middle-earth than anything from those publishers - one can tell that there are people on the team who not only enjoyed the story, but also want to respect it in terms of this creation. However, it also feels like they were oftentimes overruled in game and art design choices.  To put it bluntly, contrary to /u/edwardpeterson's statement, the game is fairly frequently unfaithful, and that breaches impact more or less every aspect of the game. However, if you can look past those issues, you'll find an interpretation of Middle-earth which I think is worth spending some amount of time in, especially since there is a good amount of content that is faithful."

I think this is very accurate, but I think to be fair I would add that the sheer amount of original content they created for it that they managed to make consistent in tone and ""feel"" with the established setting is really quite impressive.  I also think that while faithfulness considerations were overruled in some game design aspects in favor of standard MMO play there were still more attempts made to integrate the setting into that playstyle than I would have expected, like the use of Morale for HP to justify ""non-magical"" healing and healer classes."

lotr,3dvhtm,AmbiguousAnonymous,2,Mon Jul 20 02:43:09 2015 UTC,"Been playing for 7 years now. One of my favorite games overall, and by far the most expansive representation of Middle-earth to ever exist in any medium. Fairly faithful to the source, but with a few exceptions.  The main story-line follows what is essentially a piece of well-written fan fiction for about half the game before diverting to a more Fellowship-of-the-Ring-centric storyline. It's enjoyable but not 'canon'.   The most obvious lore-breaking things are the player classes. You can be a Rune-keeper, which is more or less a wizard that can cast fire down from the sky or summon fire from his hands. Fun to play as, but again, not exactly in the spirit of the Lord of the Rings. You can also be a minstrel that essentially casts magic spells (but the power comes from the 'music' of the instrument, think the first chapter of the Silmarillion.) Also available is a Lore-master class, which uses arcane knowledge to summon animal friends and channel the powers of nature like wind and fire to defeat your foes. You kinda have to expect that an MMO will have some sort of magical classes for mass-appeal though.  That being said, the game is incredibly immersive for a fan of the books. You can literally walk around nearly all of Middle-earth, which I think is unspeakably cool. Visit Weathertop, explore the ruins of Fornost, battle orcs in the breeding-pits of Angmar, stop by the Prancing Pony for a drink, or travel through the dark depths of Moria. It's massive. I can't even describe how many times I geeked out while playing this game, like when I first ventured into the abandoned ring-forges of Eregion and saw a tapestry on the wall depicting Sauron (in the guise of Annatar) helping the Elves to learn the craft of ring-making.  Also make sure you check out /r/lotro , it's the official sub-reddit for the Lord of the Rings Online. If you do start playing, I highly recommend Landroval (that's my server!) if you're in North America or Laurelin if you're in Europe. Both are friendly communities that are more devoted to the source material than the other servers. If you prefer a more WoW-style approach to the game (and enjoy heavily-populated areas) try Brandywine.  If you have any questions regarding the game, let me know, I'd be happy to answer them for you! :)"

Aragorn managed to trick Sauron into thinking that he was being foolhardy and arrogant, having just repelled the attack on Minas Tirith. But if the ring hadn't been destroyed, the battle would have been lost, and Sauron would have won. Period, end of story. Sauron was trying to trap the host of the west by completely surrounding them so they would be totally destroyed, putting an end to almost all remaining resistance.   Plus, the orcs are totally expendable, and Sauron didn't care about them in the slightest. They were cannon fodder, and it didn't matter how many died, there were always more lurking and breeding in Mordor.   Lighting edit: Sauron thinking that Aragorn had the ring did play a part, but he still wasn't overly concerned. It just made the ruse more convincing, that Aragorn would be overcome by pride and think he could destroy Mordor himself. He wasn't scared until he realised the ring was about to be destroyed."

Waiting wouldn't have accomplished much except to possibly allow them to escape. The two slag hills that Aragorn arrayed his army on were easily several hundred yards away at least from the Black Gate since he then had to ride forward to come ""within cry of the Morannon."" The small bows we see in the films could easily be of such a limited range as to make them useless. I might suspect he could have used ballistae or similar ranged weapons to reach them, but I'm not sure if Sauron even had that kind of technology.  But yes the main answer is what's already been said by others; Sauron wanted to complete annihilate them and was not worried about casualties."

lotr,3drztj,Elliot850,10,Sun Jul 19 00:04:35 2015 UTC,Gandalf explains to Frodo in chapter two that Bilbo placed the cause of the growing obsession on himself and not the ring. He said that his mind would sometimes dwell on it and as he grew older he didn't like to be parted with it.   He didn't attribute any of it to magic though.

Gandalf describes in the Council of Elrond that his absence after Bilbo's going-away party was to do research, ending with Isildur's notes about the inscription on the Ring. That prompts him to make that final test to see the inscription and confirm his suspicions.  TL;DR: He didn't even know there was a One Ring, and didn't know the Ring's magic was having those effects on him."

And it seems that even gandalf (who is also a maia, you'd think that he'd be able to recognize these things better) only had a vague idea of it after bilbo had the ring for sixty or so years. This is compounded by that fact that the ring was pretty benign up until ""its time had come"" to return to its master, who had just started to regain his power."

All that is to say, as is well known, that Tolkien did not write nearly as many female characters as he did male.  However, when he did write female characters, they were strong. They either had (often a very) important role to play, or their character was very well written, or both. The Tale of Beren and Lúthien offers something of a role reversal in the archetypal man-saving-damsel in distress, Erendis of 'The Mariner's Wife' is a very compelling figure, and Éowyn's achievements and beliefs should be well known here - just a few samplings of Tolkien's women."

Well that's almost worth a sidebar discussion on its own, because Erendis starts as a very compelling figure, but...shrinks by the end of the story.  She ends up very lonely and bitter. :/  But yeah, you pretty much hit the nail on the head: Tolkien was a product of Victorian England, and his portrayal of women is usually very...Victorian.    It should also be noted that, seeing as Tolkien was very much influenced by Norse folklore, Éowyn's story as a shieldmaiden echoes those in that genre: the shieldmaiden wants to fight rather than be a stay-at-home wife/mother, she fights bravely, winning great glory and renown, and then she either A) is savagely killed in battle or B) changes her mind and becomes a stay-at-home wife/mother.  Tolkien wrote her beautifully, and she remains one of my favorite characters, but in the end he kinda' went full Victorian on her. :/"

Personally, I wish there were more female characters that were as well developed as the male characters, and more that got to fight like Eowyn did. But as the other comments have said, Tolkien was a product of his time.  Tolkien's close friend C.S. Lewis says in The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe ""battles are ugly when women fight."" I think this might also reflect Tolkien's reasoning behind not having many woman warriors, because there was such a widely held belief that women should be protected and only fight when the war is already ugly."

It is entirely possible that they did all the scanning and effects at 4K, but it's probably most likely that they did it all at 2K. If the latter is the case, then the grading and effects would have to be redone for a 4K release, which would mean the film would have to be rescanned. Not an easy task, but it can be done."

Elvish singing is not a thing to miss, in June under the stars, not if you care for such things.   The following text also implies that they read the map the same night that they arrived and they leave the following morning.  The fact that the moon had not risen by the time the sun had gone down can be attributed to one of the following.   The moon was behind the misty mountains. The moon and sun aren't directly linked meaning when one goes down it doesn't mean that the otherone comes up. It could have just been taking its time. (this is why sometimes you cannot see the moon on a clear night, and also why it is sometimes viewable in the day. They are in no way linked, just that the moon is more visible at night than during the day because it is the only reflective surface in our night sky.)   So without your 3 week time gap (which I have no idea how you got to frankly, where does it say they arrived on the 29th of may?) we have no way of knowing whether it was a waning or waxing cresent.

Wizards, Coonskin, Fritz the Cat, Fire & Ice, American Pop...  He was one of the more influential and successful creators of his time, and a lot of his genius shines through in Lord of the Rings.  What was ultimately the failure of the movie was its attempt to tell so much of such a long story in one short film, and the fact that it never really figures out whether it wants to be an adult film or a kids' film.  The kids movie hobbits are in the same frame as the '70s experimental animation, psychedelic head movie orcs, and the tension and contrast don't make any sense.  Even so, there are some great scenes.  Christopher Lee and Ian MacKellan in a scene together is untouchable, sure, but the scene between Gandalf and Saruman in Bakshi's film is still a beautiful and nuanced interpretation of the source material.  And the opening sequence, that Jackson I feel swiped from Bakshi, as it does a great job of setting up the story and certainly doesn't exist in that form in the books, is beautiful and evocative.  It's not a successful interpretation of the books on the level of Jackson's trilogy, and if you go into it with that benchmark you're going to walk away from it disappointed and bewildered.

It's hard to believe though as both Jackson and Bakshi looked to other artists' interpretation of the books and based their movie off of that, well... Sort of.  Jackson actually hired Alan Lee and John Howe to do the concept art so you could say that his movies were more original than Bakshi's.    But it's a touchy subject for Bakshi..."

Obviously these are mutually exclusive, so what ended up happening was that the Ents lived in the forest, and the Entwives in their gardens, and they would visit one another whenever they wished to (and make young Entings).  The Entwives had their gardens east of Fangorn Forest, across the Anduin, and they were highly honored for their skills at agriculture - what Men know of agriculture can basically all be traced back to the Entwives' teachings.  But during the war of the Last Alliance, Gil-Galad and Elendil were marching down the Vale of Anduin with their forces, and Sauron scorched the earth ahead of them - including the gardens of the Entwives. You can see it on the 3rd Age map as ""The Brown Lands.""  So after the war, some of the Ents desired to see the Entwives, and went to their gardens, and found a scorched wasteland. Hence Treebeard saying they are lost and they cannot find them - no one knew if the Entwives had been killed, imprisoned, or fled. They searched and searched, but never found out what happened.  Tolkien himself in a letter said he didn't know what had happened to the Entwives, but said they were most likely destroyed (and that was probably the best possible outcome)."

His bond to the power of the Ring was the only thing keeping his body from decaying into dust.*  *Interestingly we see what might happen to Gollum when the Witch-king is killed. When his spirit leaves his body after he is slain by Merry and Eowyn his body's connection to the Ring's power is severed and it crumbles immediately."
lotr,3dmelr,italia06823834,10,Fri Jul 17 13:46:36 2015 UTC,Where can I find Gollum stating about the Ring being the only current (yet parasitical) source of his life?

lotr,3dmelr,weedbearsandpie,4,Fri Jul 17 14:17:34 2015 UTC,I would think it's true. I editted in some info into my first comment about what happens to the Witch-king after his body is severed from the connection to the Ring. I see no reason why Gollum would be any different.
lotr,3dmelr,flyingzapdos,2,Fri Jul 17 14:42:47 2015 UTC,"It rather begs the question of how would Gollum be aware that he would crumble to dust?  It feels more like him playing up his suffering in a sense of 'without that ring I'm nothing'. Though I don't doubt that you're actually right, it's just how on earth would he even know that's what would happen if it was destroyed since the only ring bearers before him were Isildur and Deagol and both of those didn't die from old age."
lotr,3dmelr,italia06823834,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:24:21 2015 UTC,I don't really follow this. The Witch King was physically killed by Eowyn after being maimed by Merry. U/Elliot850 has the more likely answer theorized by Gandalf below.
lotr,3dmelr,Elliot850,2,Fri Jul 17 17:05:01 2015 UTC,"Well let me seen if I can explain the connection between the two as I see it a bit.  The Witch-King's and Gollum's souls are both bound to the Ring, and in turn their bodies bound to their souls.   The Ring's power sustains and preserves their bodies.  If the connection to the Ring we broken, like when the Witch-king's soul leaves his body when he is killed, or with the destruction of the Ring, that power is no longer there to sustain the body and it experiences all the decay it should have been undergoing over the years. That's why the Witch-king's body crumbles away, and likely the same would happen to Gollum."
lotr,3dmelr,italia06823834,5,Fri Jul 17 17:22:24 2015 UTC,"In the shire when Galdalf is explaining the ring to Frodo in Shadows Of The Past, he implies that Gollum would live the rest of his life and die of old age, much like Bilbo would."
lotr,3dmelr,Elliot850,6,Fri Jul 17 13:28:32 2015 UTC,"Is this the quote you mean?   ‘Of course, he possessed the ring for many years, and used it, so it might take a long while for the influence to wear off - before it was safe for him to see it again, for instance. Otherwise, he might live on for years, quite happily: just stop as he was when he parted with it. For he gave it up in the end of his own accord: an important point. No, I was not troubled about dear Bilbo any more, once he had let the thing go.    This isn't talking about what would happen after the destruction of the Ring, and it could be argued would not apply to Gollum anyway, since he had it much longer, and did not give it up ""of his own accord."""
lotr,3dmelr,Elliot850,3,Fri Jul 17 17:28:58 2015 UTC,That's the exact one.  It's all hypothetical anyway as it was just Gandalfs thoughts on what could possibly happen.

lotr,3dmelr,dongazine_supplies,4,Fri Jul 17 13:35:58 2015 UTC,"The impression I got was that he would live as if from the age he first found the ring, and Gandalf theorised that he could possibly have a chance to become a being of good again.

lotr,3dnt0m,Scustevie,12,Fri Jul 17 19:54:39 2015 UTC,"There are quite a few Balrogs. If you've read The Hobbit and LotR I recommend checking out The Silmarillion. There are a lot of answers in there to questions like this one. For example, Gothmog (a balrog) was one of Morgoth's chief servants in the First Age (as was Sauron). In The Silmarillion he plays a part in the downfall of one of the great Elven cities among other events."
lotr,3dnt0m,EyeceEyeceBaby,10,Fri Jul 17 20:13:55 2015 UTC,"Tolkien later stated this on the number of balrogs, ""There should not be supposed more than say 3 or at most 7 ever existed."""
lotr,3dnt0m,Edledhron,6,Fri Jul 17 21:13:25 2015 UTC,"There is, but it's inconsistent.  Tolkien being the tinkerer that he was, he initially envisioned armies of them, but later whittled it down to either five or seven of them."
lotr,3dnt0m,S_Jeru,2,Fri Jul 17 20:57:58 2015 UTC,"I remember there are at least three instances of someone killing a single Balrog, so it's at least three. The Balrogs were likely Maiar, a fairly powerful group of ""spirits"" that have been around since the beginning. Sauron and the Wizards are also Maiar. Some of the Maiar are associated with fire, and some of those chose to join Morgoth and took the shape of Balrogs.  That is at least their origin in the Silmarillion, but Tolkien changed his mind a lot in his private notes on the origin of many things."

Gandalf stood in the middle of the span, leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand Glamdring gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings.  It raised the whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils.

lotr,3do5ne,tolkienreader,9,Fri Jul 17 21:32:22 2015 UTC,"Here's the relevant text from The Silmarillion:   Thus it came to pass that of the Ainur some abode still with Ilúvatar beyond the confines of the World; but others, and among them many of the greatest and most fair, took the leave of Ilúvatar and descended into it. But this condition Ilúvatar made, or it is the necessity of their love, that their power should thenceforward be contained and bounded by the World, to be within it for ever, until it is complete, so that they are its life and it is theirs. And therefore they are named the Valar, the Powers of the World.   They were bound to it because it was their responsibility to create/curate it. I think this idea of their power being contained and bounded by Arda is closely tied to the fact that before they entered into Eä, Arda was empty/nonexistent. In fact this seemed to surprise the Valar as they had just witnessed the Music and a Vision of Arda. As for the Ainur that remained behind there's not much to say beyond that single line quoted above.  Also just to clear it up the easiest way to think of it is Arda=Earth, Eä=The entire created Universe. Arda is within Eä. The Valar entered Eä and shaped Arda."

Wouldn't a true fan of something decide for him or herself what he or she enjoys and why?  The fact that one likes, for example, italian food doesn't mean that person can't like risotto but not tagliatelle. The fact that one likes classical music doesn't mean the person can't like the baroque period but not the romantic period. The fact that someone likes sports doesn't mean one can't like basketball and dislike football/soccer.  There is no reason why someone that likes fantasy MUST like game of thrones. There's no reason why someone that likes LOTR must like SOIF. In fact, there's actually more reasons why someone won't like both, since the created works are very different and so are the thought processes.

lotr,3dixom,jgiampaolo70,3,Thu Jul 16 17:26:44 2015 UTC,You can also read The Children of Húrin in conjunction with The Silmarillion or just prior to Unfinished Tales. It fits the more narrative style of the previous works rather than the annotated text style of UT and HoME. The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien is a good addition with UT and HoME as well.

lotr,3dixom,fadhero,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:41:37 2015 UTC,my friend adviced me to read Silmarillion before the Trilogy. I just finished Fellowship though. I'm planning to do your exact thing with Hobbit & Fellowship reversed. Not sure if I should read Silmarillion tho
lotr,3dixom,Shadecraze,2,Thu Jul 16 20:35:54 2015 UTC,"You're reading it Fellowship, then Hobbit, then Two Towers, etc.? Because that's an awfully odd order...Fellowship+The Two Towers+Return of the King are all a single book, just published in three volumes. Unless I'm misinterpreting your comment. If you haven't read The Hobbit yet, I'd suggest finishing LotR and then going back to read it."
lotr,3dixom,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:59:20 2015 UTC,"yeah you understood it right. It's weird like that because I had bought FotR years ago and recently started reading it, and I bought 2 towers and the Hobbit like 1 week ago. Since the Hobbit is pretty short, I thought I'd finish it since it's before lotr time-wise. I realize it's weird though lol. I might just go: trilogy - hobbit - silmarillion - etc like you suggest i guess"
lotr,3dixom,Shadecraze,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:02:35 2015 UTC,"I would finish the LotR trilogy first. They are not meant as seperate books but as a single story. The cutoff is fairly arbitrary and was just because the publisher wanted it. The story of the Two Towers hits the ground running. They are in the middle of the action from page one and some major things are going to happen. Has more impact I think if you read it right after Fellowship.  The story really starts with running. In one of the last paragraphs of Fellowship Aragorn is running to find the hobbits, and the first sentence of Two Towers is ""Aragorn sped on up the hill."" Didn't even stop running between the two books! The first chapter of TT would have made a good ending for Fellowship but the book was already bigger than TT. For the films they moved bits of the first chapter to the end of Fellowship. I won't spoil anything but major events are about to happen. The ending of Fellowship is a cliffhanger. Everyone is still rushing to find Frodo.  The Hobbit is also a very different book. It is a children's book and the story is not about saving the world but a personal adventure. The only things you need to know for LotR you already know: Bilbo had an adventure, found the Ring, and got some friendships with Gandalf, a bunch of Dwarves and some Elves. I like the book, I imagine it is the way Bilbo may have told the story to younger hobbits (in the real world, Tolkien wrote the story for his own children).  I really like the Silmarillion, but some people find it slow or hard to read. It reads like a history book or a medieval chronicle and not a novel. There are origin stories for a lot of characters and peoples such as Elrond, Aragorn and the people of Gondor and Arnor, all the different groups of Elves, and it explains what the Wizards are. I found that really interesting to know even though it is not the main story. Silmarillion has spoilers for LotR and for The Children of Húrin. By spoilers I mean it contains a very short version of those stories. Basically the chapter ""Of Túrin Turambar"" is that book.  The Children of Húrin is quite a bit darker than LotR though.   (I should probably put /rant at the end of this, it was longer than I expected)"

lotr,3dheoi,NimbusCloudy,7,Thu Jul 16 08:07:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think Dwarves would have had any strong feelings regarding the beards of other races. Men had them, Stoorish Hobbits (such as those in Buckland and Bree) had them, even Cirdan had one. For example, some religions require their followers not to shave. It's an intimate personal representation of their religion. I've yet to meet someone who keeps a beard for religious reasons who was offended by or bonded with me because of my own beard. By and large our facial hair doesn't come up in conversation, and I imagine it would be similar for a Dwarf.  As for the second question, I don't think Dwarves would commonly welcome outsiders into their mines and smithies to share knowledge. They were a secretive people, who would develop outside friendship to gain wealth. The several friendships between Dwarves and outsiders were largely based on sharing of goods (trade), not sharing of knowledge."
lotr,3dheoi,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Thu Jul 16 14:09:12 2015 UTC,I figured the dwarves wouldn't mind if other races had beards. But to make things more clear I meant to describe the beards of said men being so large that they too could tuck them into their belts. I couldn't find any information on this and since I am yet to read the silmarillion I wondered if it was ever mentioned. Thanks for such a great answer!
lotr,3dheoi,AmbiguousAnonymous,2,Thu Jul 16 23:26:31 2015 UTC,I don't think they cared.  I can't recall any references to it anyway.  Its not like beards were uncommon.  Even the Elf Cirdan had a beard.
lotr,3dheoi,tphelan88,3,Thu Jul 16 13:06:58 2015 UTC,It's kind of annoying how PJ depicted Cirdan in two scenes in his movies and in both he is beardless.  The one thing about his appearance that sets him apart from all the other elves and it doesn't make it into the movies.
lotr,3dheoi,ReinierPersoon,2,Thu Jul 16 14:17:07 2015 UTC,Círdan was in there? I never noticed. Perhaps because of lack of beard I just assumed he was a generic Elf bystander.

The Crebain were also from Dunland and they were Saruman's spies.  Then they would need to travel past Isengard and through Rohan. Last time Gandalf was in Rohan he received no help and basically stole the king's best horse. Technically it wasn't stealing but I don't think the king expected he would take Shadowfax.  They would need to go very close to Minas Tirith, and it's pretty clear that Denethor would have wanted ""the weapon of the Enemy"".  Then there are the advantages of going through or over the Misty Mountains: on the other side was Lothlórien where Gandalf knew they would be safe and could receive aid. Then there was a river they could travel by boat through uninhabited land instead of lands full of people."

Fellowship of the Ring Two Towers Return of the King  Technically The Hobbit story internally takes place first, but the movies are portrayed in a way that assumes you've seen LotR first (not that you'd be confused if you watch The Hobbit first).  Also LotR are the better films.  IMDB does give the correct story internal chronology though."
lotr,3d92qn,italia06823834,11,Tue Jul 14 13:35:36 2015 UTC,"All these people saying that you should try to avoid spoiling the hobbit are way off base.  First, do nothing that will possibly compromise your enjoyment of the LotR Trilogy.  The importance of experiencing it correctly is orders of magnitude more important than experiencing the hobbit correctly.  People might call that an opinion, but remember that the last LotR movie won 11 academy awards.  The last thing you want to do is have a bad taste in your mouth from the hobbit movies (not saying this would necessarily happen) as you start watching the LotR movies.  Second, don't worry too much about spoiling the hobbit, because while the end result of the adventures may get spoiled, the adventures themselves will mostly remain intact.  Third, the hobbit movies were designed for viewers who had already seen the LotR.  There are some spin-off adventures (hey, they had to drag it out from 1 book to 3 movies somehow) and those spin-offs won't make much sense if you haven't seen the LotR movies.  So yes your list is in chronological order, but no you shouldn't watch them in that order."
lotr,3d92qn,DrQuailMan,23,Tue Jul 14 17:22:51 2015 UTC,Leave out the Hobbit movies and just watch the original LOTR movies in order.

lotr,3d92qn,Wxlson,3,Tue Jul 14 18:38:20 2015 UTC,"So far people have given answers based on opinion. If you wish to watch all the movies including The Hobbit in chronological order then your IMDb list is correct.   An Unexpected Journey The Desolation of Smaug The Battle of the Five Armies The Fellowship of the Ring The Two Towers The Return for the King   As for the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings movies giving away stuff about each other, yes the Lord of the Rings movies does give away some information (due to the fact that they take place after the events of The Hobbit) and yes The Hobbit gives away some stuff about Lord of the Rings. The difference is that the stuff that the Hobbit films give away is subtle references for fans which a first time watcher won't pick up on.  To summarise on that last paragraph, The Lord of the Rings may ruin the plot of The Hobbit for you however the Hobbit will only enhance the plot of the Lord of the Rings.  Hope I have helped.  Edit: Also attempt to listen to the story carefully. Pick up on names ect. You will find it very rewarding if you ever rewatch them because you will be like ""ahhh, that makes sense now"". Also I suggest reading the books. Perhaps you aren't a book person, fair enough however you can pick up the Hobbit + The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on ebay for £10."

lotr,3d8az7,AdoringFandalf,14,Tue Jul 14 08:01:06 2015 UTC,This question was effectively answered a few hours ago here
lotr,3d8az7,swissdude323,4,Tue Jul 14 10:08:24 2015 UTC,"The invisibility is more of a side effect and was not the main intention of Sauron when he created the One Ring. Its intention was to dominate everyone, especially the holders of the other Rings.  Sauron is already in the spirit world as he is a Maia. He won't turn invisible, and if a mortal wears the Ring and turns invisible Sauron would still see him.  It's mentioned that some of the Elves have great power in both the seen and unseen worlds. Glorfindel is mentioned specifically by Gandalf. People like him would have seen invisible people wearing the Ring. The First Age Elves are generally a step above everyone else, killing Balrogs and stuff."
lotr,3d8az7,ReinierPersoon,3,Tue Jul 14 15:20:20 2015 UTC,"Rings of Power all give power according to the measure of the wielder. Bilbo, Frodo, and Smeagol were all hobbits, who's natural ability is to be stealthy and quiet, so the Ring amplified (while simultaneously corrupting) that ability, pulling them into the Unseen Realm to make them truly invisible. If an Elf wore it, it would preserve the world eternal, and if a Dwarf wore it, it would create nigh-infinite wealth. If a man wore it, if he were strong enough, it would give him the strength to dominate lesser men.  To quote from Fellowship of the Ring:  ""I would ask one thing before I go,"" said Frodo, ""A thing which I often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell. I am permitted to wear the One Ring: why cannot I see all the others and know the thoughts of those that wear them?""  ""You have not tried,"" she [Galadriel] said, ""Only thrice have you set the Ring upon your finger since you knew what you possessed. Do not try! It would destroy you. Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each possessor? Before you could use that power you would need to become far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others."" (Source: Book 2, Chapter 7)"
lotr,3d8az7,Skyrim4Eva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:35:49 2015 UTC,"Strictly guessing here but I would think that it's because Sauron doesn't need to be invisible when wielding it. When someone puts the ring on they don't actually go ""invisible"". They are crossing over into shadow, the same realm in which the nine exist, that's why the ring bearer can see their faces. Sauron did this intentionally in order to aide in locating the ring. Obviously he has no use for any of that if he HAS the ring.  Again, this is just my guess, I could be wrong."
lotr,3d8az7,JablesRadio,6,Wed Jul 15 01:56:10 2015 UTC,This is very much untrue.  The Ring makes people invisible by bringing them partly into the Wraith world. Isildur also becomes invisible.

Then I thought about the changes as a whole as applied to films and how films work (reflection). Then I saw each of them again (first viewings were with my then-girlfriend opening weekend, second viewings were with other friends at least a week later) and, having thought about the changes and knowing where they were, I was able to start to appreciate them on their own terms and generally approve of them.  This is a similar process that I've had happen with films-of-the-book/comic that I've seen since then (Watchmen being another prime example).  I was hoping that this would hold up for The Hobbit films. The annoyance with changes were more common, but there was a lack of cohesive storytelling to back that up and the whole thing wound up feeling hollow rather than ""working"" as films on their own.  My two cents."
lotr,3daz2b,WalkingTarget,5,Tue Jul 14 21:59:45 2015 UTC,"For me, after having seen the movies so many times, it felt a bit strange and it took a while to adjust to the books. But after that, I really enjoyed them.  Though, now having read the books and reflecting on the movies. I feel the LotR movies did great justice to the books. Most of the changes that were made, make a lot of sense in a visual medium like films. In fact, for that reason, I think Peter Jackson was brilliant, for making LotR the way he did.  The Hobbit movies on the other hand, felt like they were devoid of a soul. Even though, the changes made for the medium were alright, the bloat really ruined it. Maybe, if The Hobbit hadn't got stuck in development hell, it might have been better."
lotr,3daz2b,Uluithiad,11,Tue Jul 14 22:40:05 2015 UTC,"Similar? Yes. To the same degree? Not even close, and for good reason. If you look at what Jackson and Co did to make The Hobbit so widely disliked, you can see that he was busy doing the same thing through much of LotR, increasingly as the films went on. Of course, more occurs in the LotR than in The Hobbit, so he was less able to fill it with his own stuff. His own stuff has never been especially good or coherent."
lotr,3daz2b,fileg,4,Tue Jul 14 22:06:50 2015 UTC,"Among our friends, there was a lot of anxiety before the movies came out -- after all, we had fallen for the Bakshi movie.   After they came out, there were several camps = people who loved them, people who hated them for what was changed, and people like me -- they will never be the books, but I already have the books. I think for movies, they did a better job then I could have hoped. (That said, there are some sins in them I consider unforgivable, but I try to put them aside when I am actually watching them.)"

That's not only the exact opposite of everything Faramir is, it's a mockery of the honesty and morality of the entire culture of Gondor - the very thing that makes them the good guys.  I put up with the original changes to Faramir, though they broke my heart. But That?! That will not do.

He didn't shy away from his heritage.  The more I watch it the more I think that PJ's reasons for changes were unjustified.  Imagine if he included Elrond's withholding of consent as motivation:   '""My son, years come when hope will fade, and beyond them little is clear to the. And now a shadow lies between us. Maybe, it has been appointed so, that by my loss the kingship of Men may be restored. Therefore, though I love you, I say to you: Arwen Undómiel shall not diminish her life's grace lot less cause.

Most of the times in the films that he says ""i would not take the ring within a hundred leagues of your city"" (to boromir) he was saying that because he didnt want to take the ring there where it will corrupt the shit out of everyone, and not so much that he was just shying away from his heritage. Thats just what i took away from the films at least"

A less personally irritating factor but probably a more important one for the success of the movies is that Jackson never really shows Frodo's strength. In the movies he come off as a fey twink who's sole contribution to the Quest is to be a warm body they hang the Ring off of so that its evil radiation doesn't contaminate anyone useful."
lotr,3daz2b,Matty_Boo,2,Wed Jul 15 16:42:37 2015 UTC,"As bad as movie Denethor is, for me the unforgivable sin is when Gandalf hits him with his staff. Yes, it's a great movie moment of comic relief, but once again, it changes Gandalf's character. It just should not happen."

lotr,3d40ck,tslime,-31,Mon Jul 20 17:10:49 2015 UTC,"Hahahahaha. LOTR is a huge allegory! Narnia is just a much more simple and obvious one because it is aimed at kids to help accept the concepts of Christianity better. And please don't comment back to me saying, 'oh Tolkien denied allegations of LOTR being an allegory his whole life... Blah blah blah' I don't wanna hear it. Tolkien might not have done it on purpose, but it's an allegory all the same. Just very, very complex. For example, the whole Narnia series, Aslan is Jesus. Very clearly. Whereas in LOTR, one character, or race or 'country' could have allegorical refers to many different things throughout the series, rather than just one thing as is the case with Aslan. Tolkien wrote about his opinions on what was happening in the real world within his LOTR writings. Some people just focus to much on the fiction to notice that, and hey, there's nothing wrong with that. But LOTR is one hundred percent an allegory for WWII."
lotr,3d40ck,AnxiousPatient,26,Mon Jul 13 16:28:54 2015 UTC,"But LOTR is one hundred percent an allegory for WWII.   FYI, Tolkien expressly (and rather scornfully) denied this interpretation.   The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its conclusion. If it had inspired or directed the development of the legend, then certainly the Ring would have been seized and used by Sauron; he would not have been annihilated but enslaved, and Barad-Dûr would not have been destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get possession of the Ring, would in the confusion and treacherous of the time have found in Mordor the missing links in his own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would have made a Great Ring of his own with which to challenge the self-styled Ruler of Middle-Earth. In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits in hatred and contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves.   I'm not saying you're absolutely wrong to claim ""LOTR is one hundred percent an allegory for WWII.""  I'm just pointing out that the author himself said you were 100% wrong to claim that. -_-"

lotr,3d40ck,iBear83,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:17:25 2015 UTC,"Authorial intent shouldn't be used to preclude alternative interpretations. It's fallacious to assume that an author's intent is always fully realized or that the product came out exactly as intended. Just because Tolkien doesn't like the parallels doesn't mean that they're not present.   Consider this anecdote about Ray Bradbury: Bradbury has gone on record claiming--with similar vehemence as Tolkien's claims against the war allegory--that his novel Fahrenheit 451 is NOT about censorship. Here's the thing though. Anyone who reads it is going to get censorship out of it. Are we all hopelessly stupid, or did Bradbury include censorship despite his intentions? Clearly, it's the latter. Sorry, Bradbury, but you totally wrote about censorship. It's not the ONLY thing F451 is about, though, and his intended messages are all there as well, but claiming that the theme of censorship is absent is just silly.  I don't personally ascribe to the war allegory criticism, but there's definitely substantial evidence to validate the theory. Enough, at least, that I don't go shutting down or downvoting people who espouse it."
lotr,3d40ck,RedArremer,3,Mon Jul 13 23:04:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry, Bradbury, but you totally wrote about censorship.    Absolutely, 100% incorrect.  Bradbury wrote about the effect that he felt television was having on literature.  That's what the book was about.  The book contained many elements that were extremely applicable to censorship.  But that's not what Farenheit 451 was about.  That's the difference between allegory and applicability that Tolkien himself pointed out: allegory is a deliberate action on the author's part, and applicability is a reactive perception on the reader's part.  The distinction is not trivial: the Dead Marshes were an allusion to Tolkien's experience in WWI.  The title of The Two Towers was not an allusion to the 9/11 attacks."

lotr,3d40ck,zeenies,5,Mon Jul 13 17:34:08 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to agree with you that LOTR is an allegory although I don't believe it is an ""one hundred percent"" allegory for WWII. It has WWII elements for sure as this is because this is what Tolkien knew and writers, whether they like it or not, write what they know.  There are two main problems with your argument that LOTR is an allegory. One, you are dealing in absolutes with no room for a contrary opinion. Absolute opinions are almost always wrong as there are virtually no absolutes in life, especially in writing, art, etc.   The second problem, which is linked to the first, is that you are coming off as an ass. This is mostly because you are dealing in the absolute and refuse to acknowledge any other opinion. If you were to be more accepting of other people's ideas and have an actual disscusion (which is what this website and subreddit are all about) you'd probably learn that many people agree with you. But the people who agree with you are not likely to want to be associated with you. Just my $0.02.  TL;DR: Stop dealing in absolutes, you're being an ass.  Edit: Also for people saying ""no! Tolkien said it wasn't an allegory"" remember that once a work of fiction is printed it is up for interpretation. So just because Tolkien did not intend it to be an allegory doesn't mean people can't interpret it as such."

Things like the quote about King's Men (which, by the way, not Black Numenoreans) being implied to account for the settlements of the Numenoreans c. 1800, when this quote is actually explicitly talking about a point in time after 2251. It is impossible for the Numenorean Nazgul to have been from the King's Men (and the Black Numenoreans, an ever later concept). The math blatantly doesn't work.  This allows the writer to make out as if the settlements of Numenor were breakaway bits of evil or corruptible Men, when that couldn't be further from the truth. They were colonies. Some people in those colonies obviously fell to Sauron's sway, and some of those colonies obviously went to his side later on (but some, like what would become Gondor, clearly did not), but there is some serious warping of facts if we're being meant to believe Numenor was long establishing exploitation in Middle-earth, that they originally landed 'as lords and masters and gatherers of tribute', when that, too, is a quote that applies to times after the Nazgul were around, hundreds of years after the original settlements."

lotr,3d22t3,WalkingTarget,5,Mon Jul 13 12:18:38 2015 UTC,"What about it, in particular?  I don't know Latin grammar rules to be able to critique its use here, but the thing that sticks out to me is that ""hobbit"" is a word derived from Old English roots and should therefore have been translated into Latin as well rather than just have a ""Latinish"" ending stuck on the end.  Something like, I dunno (using Google Translate to get ideas here), cavædifex. Then again, I don't know how ""Hobbit"" has been treated in other languages (although, looking at the titles it looks like they're just mostly localized variations of the ""English"" word so maybe I'm overthinking it)."
lotr,3d22t3,ninjastarz,3,Mon Jul 13 13:21:37 2015 UTC,"For me, the annoying bit is that 'ille' isn't necessary. Hobbitus literally means 'The Hobbit' (assuming it's treated as a group 2 noun). Hobbitus Ille means 'This Hobbit,' which is wrong and only there to feed into a one-word-equals-one-word mentality."
lotr,3d22t3,Empanser,8,Mon Jul 13 15:29:23 2015 UTC,"I can answer this!  Latin doesn't use articles like ""a"" or ""the,"" so ""ille"" (meaning ""that"") isn't necessary with regular nouns. ""Ille"" after a noun expresses a particular or outstanding instance of that noun. In English, these sentences would have different meanings:   In-N-Out is a place to get burgers.  In-N-Out is the place to get burgers.  In Latin, ""ille"" expresses the stressed ""the.""   In-N-Out locus ille est convivatum hamburgum  This is the same for The Hobbit:  Hobbitus = a hobbit  Hobbitus Ille = The Hobbit"

I guess they were of hobbit-kind; akin to the fathers of the fathers of the Stoors, for they loved the River, and often swam in it, or made little boats of reeds.   I think it might depend on what exactly does the term ""Hobbit"" mean? Does it mean any member of the race of Little Folk back into antiquity or does it encompass a certain cultural aspect as well? I mean do you have to be able to trace back to the three ""clans"" specifically. If you have to be descended from the Fallohides, Harfoots, and/or Stoors to be a Hobbit, and if Smeagol's people predated those groups, then he might not count.  Room for discussion/argument, I think."

What I can make out of what they were trying to get reads ""[...]ing to surrender wha[...]""."
lotr,3cxykr,WalkingTarget,3,Sat Jul 11 22:39:23 2015 UTC,"Well - if it were just a string of letters, I wouldn't expect it to have any meaning. But it seems you picked out at least one longer word.  Couldn't she have thought of a distinct phrase, then translated, and typed it out in her best approximation of a translation and spelling?  Really, someone should just ask her."
lotr,3cxykr,mrhorrible,17,Sun Jul 12 03:22:20 2015 UTC,"It's not a translation or even an attempt at transliteration. The only way to get the string of characters she has is to have done what I described involving the misuse of computer fonts. I picked out what I did by reverse engineering the keystrokes required to get the characters on her leg.  The characters in the tattoo, if sounded out according to the English values would be (with ? where there is no attested value in English):  s?? mwh j?vvf?shfv bych  And there wouldn't me much better in terms of sense-making if it was an attempt at other modes (like Sindarin or Quenya). One giveaway is that there are no vowels (since vowel marks in this font requires you to use the shift key) - a classic signifier that somebody was using a font without knowing how they work. This is a (sadly) common issue; even more so when it's on a tattoo."
lotr,3cxykr,WalkingTarget,5,Sun Jul 12 03:37:38 2015 UTC,"Wow. So wait... are you saying that you looked at the tattoo, identified the characters, then figured out what keys she would have had to type to make them - and that those keys spell out the ""... surrender... "" part?"

lotr,3cwx9a,boom_wildcat,3,Sat Jul 11 16:59:46 2015 UTC,"""Have"" is correct using the convention of having the silent 'e' represented as a dot below the preceding character. See the title page from LotR where the word ""herein"" has the silent e below the 'r'.  You have represented the 'c' in ""decide"" with the character used for 'k' when the 's' would have been better (there is no equivalent to 'c' in Tengwar so the convention is to use whichever alternate is better, whether that's 'k', 's', or the single-character that represents 'ch').  Also, the single-character shorthand for ""the"" is to use the variant of that character that has the long stem both above and below - if you're using the Tengwar Annatar typeface, that's equivalent to typing the @ symbol (shift+2).  Lastly, the 'th' symbol you've used in ""that"" is the one used for representing the sound at the beginning of ""thin"" you want to use the one with two bows (the one you had used for the word ""the"" in my previous note) to represent the sound in ""that"".  Other than that, it's a solid transliteration."

I've always thought of it like a cheap copy. Nothing new, just lesser quality, and more evil."
lotr,3cocqn,22bebo,36,Thu Jul 9 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"Huh, and that kind of gives an actual reason for why orcs and trolls and other ""evil"" things are generally weaker than ""good"" things in Middle-Earth."
lotr,3cocqn,TinCanKing,20,Thu Jul 9 15:56:27 2015 UTC,"Right. Orcs were originally elves Morgoth captured and corrupted.

lotr,3cocqn,Uluithiad,8,Thu Jul 9 20:54:44 2015 UTC,"Not originally. Originally they were made by Melkor out of the stuff of the earth and given the spark of life. That quote you see people talking about above, where it is said Melkor cannot create life? It took Tolkien two decades of writing before he came up with that, and another one or two before he actually implemented it to any reasonable degree. Orcs from Elves was simply the first of his ideas to be in line with this new concept he decided upon. He scrapped it not because innocence could not be corrupted so, but because Eru's will that the Elves be immortal could not be altered by Melkor's supposed fiddling (which it would need to have been with Orcs from Elves, since Orcs are not immortal)."
lotr,3cocqn,TinCanKing,3,Fri Jul 10 00:45:45 2015 UTC,"It'll be a few hours before I can confirm what's presented here, but this article outlines the sections of the Silmarillion and the LotR that I was thinking of.    It does, however, note that in Morgoth's Ring, there is contradictory evidence about their origin. I have yet to read Christopher's History of Middle Earth, so I'm not familiar with its contents or what it contests in other works."
lotr,3cocqn,Uluithiad,18,Thu Jul 9 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"There's certain leaps to take in understanding the more obscure stuff in Tolkien's work, and the one helpful here is to understand that the History of Middle-earth shouldn't be described as being 'Christopher's'.  If anything is 'Christopher's', it is the Silmarillion, which was specifically cobbled together after his father's death in order to create a self-consistent work. As such, the Silmarillion will always play second fiddle to the ideas in HoME, where Tolkien's ideas can be found in the proper context of their place in the development of the mythos over the decades of his life. Which is what the foreword of the Silmarillion tells us, to not look for this sort of thing from it. The point is, HoME is JRR's, though because the majority of the fandom is more familiar with the Silmarillion, the stuff from that less 'correct' book is held as better lore than it ought to be. And of those misplaced loyalties to ideas, none more so than the origin of Orcs.  It is worth noting that the article you have there doesn't actually use LotR to support the idea that Orcs are from Elves. All LotR argues is that Orcs came from something else; Tolkien agreed, and in that first foray into following that rule he made (in the late 30's he had a contradictory state where he stated Melkor couldn't create life and then proceeded to have him do just that), he made them come from Elves. Then, when he realized that didn't work, because (like the idea of the Dark Lord creating) it gave Melkor too much power to influence the will of Eru, he rejected Elves as a source and turned to other ideas, which he never fully reconciled. The article, rather, requires the Silmarillion to make the argument stick. And any argument that needs to use the Silmarillion and needs to not use HoME is, to be blunt, void of reason."

lotr,3cocqn,Edledhron,22,Thu Jul 9 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"Such a thing is stated in The Silmarillion. The problem with that, though, is that The Silmarillion isn't canon. Tolkien never completed a publishable Silmarillion himself, though he had produced more or less complete drafts. His writings on his mythology were all over the place in terms of being consistent and up to date, and it's from those that Christopher compiled the text that was published.  Christopher wanted to include an origin for orcs, but the rest of the narrative wasn't compatible with his father's later ideas on them, so he turned to an earlier one - orcs from corrupted elves. In terms of 'authenticity,' it's as accurate as having potentially included orcs from the heats and slimes of the earth, and was in fact rejected on similar grounds. Just as Melkor could not create new life, he could also not make inheritable such a great change as removing immortality from the elves (and orcs were mortal).  Next to the very text that found its way into The Silmarillion, Tolkien wrote: 'Alter this. Orcs are not elvish.' And altered it he did."

The Istari (Saruman, Gandalf, Radagast and the 2 Blue Wizards (their names are unconfirmed)) are 5 wizards sent to Middle Earth in order to help the Children of Iluvatar (Elves and Men) fight evil.  The 5 Istari, are part of a larger group known as the Maiar. This group consists of characters such as Sauron and the Balrogs, as well as many others. As well as the Maiar, their is also a group of 13 known as the Valar. These are the highest powers in Arda (the world that Middle Earth is part of) and have the task of governing it. These are the guys who formed the Istari and sent them over to Middle Earth. Both the Maiar and Valar are subsets of a much larger group known as the Ainur.

lotr,3cocqn,magradhaid,3,Fri Jul 10 07:05:10 2015 UTC,"Here's what I have (linking to Paul Strack's WIP database instead of page numbers to make things easier and clearer):  ""Lungorthin"" appears in the Leeds-era prose Lay of the Children of Húrin. Nothing relevant appears in Tolkien's own Index of Names for the Lay in PE15, so looking at Early Noldorin from that time, we see lung ""heavy"", which appears as ""heavy. grave, serious"" in the earlier Gnomish Lexicon.  The Gnomish Lexicon has gorthin ""fane, temple"" but I'm not sure that's appropriate; I would expect something where -in is either pluralizing or adjectival, or at least a noun more suitable for this name.  I've always been tempted to link it to Ilkorin ngorthin from the Etymologies, but that's from the 30s. During the Leeds era, words attested for ""horror, horrible"" are related to barch. We do have Early Noldorin gorth ""hearth, fireplace"", so perhaps an adjectival form appropriate for a Balrog's fiery nature? Well, if an adjective can be made from a word like that.  gorth also conjures up images of words related to ""death"", but the Leeds era seems to have those be more like gurdh, which doesn't produce a derivative gorthin kindly. ""Mountains"" from the 1930s doesn't seem appropriate either.  It could also be lung-or-thin, with or ""without, -less"", but I'm not sure of an element tin or thin that would be appropriate to follow. I haven't really found anything related in Qenya pre-1930s wordlists, either.  I'm not that familiar with EN assimilation in compounds, but if sorthin or horthin were also possible phonetically, I'm not aware of anything relevant (just ""old age"" and the like). A lenited corthin could also work, but thus so far something Noldorin in cor- would probably either be related to ""round"" or ""cheese"".   I guess Lungorthin is seriously cheesy?"

They had according to Eldarin custom no authoritative Made Name. The Names they went by among the Eldar were (at least in origin) all titles, denoting this or that function or aspect of the Vala concerned, as they appeared to the Eldar. [...] These names were not authentic, for no authority had given them. There was no authority that could name the Valar save Eru alone, and it was held by the Eldar that beyond and before Eä (the Created World) no precise counterpart to 'incarnate' speech existed [...]"" (PE21:84-5).  Presumably that would apply to Maiar as well, as the statement of ""no precise counterpart"" would be for all Ainur."

lotr,3cocqn,magradhaid,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:25:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I should have specified. I usually refer to issues of Parma Eldalamberon and Vinyar Tengwar as shorthand ""PE"" and ""VT"" out of habit from doing that when citing sources in discussions with those interested in Tolkien's languages, but I should remember to write them out in full when not on specifically-linguistic websites.  PE and VT are the journals whose editorial team transcribes, analyzes, and publishes Tolkien's previously-unpublished linguistic essays, lexicons, and notes in a scholarly format with the permission (and support) of the Tolkien Estate and Christopher Tolkien (who sends them material and at times helps them (e.g.) understand or decipher the reading or context of particularly difficult cruxes).  Said material is primarily linguistic in nature, but sometimes contains non-linguistic information when found in Tolkien's linguistic writings: a few examples are writings on Elvish ambidexterity, what probably happened to Baldor, thoughts about Elvish notions of Fate, and so on.  In this case, PE21:84-5 is Parma Eldalamberon 21, pages 84 through 85.  If you've only read The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion, there's a vast amount of ""deeper stuff"" out there waiting for you, though I wouldn't recommend PE or VT as the next step. Instead, I suggest taking a look at /u/ebneter's recommended reading guide."

There were some Balrogs with names. Chiefly Gothmog, which means Dread Oppressor in Sindarin. He also goes by Kosomot which J. R. R. poorly discussed and is apparently sometimes considered his Quenya name. Lungorthin is another name given to a balrog, though J. R. R. never really elaborated on whether or not this was just another name for Gothmog, or a separate balrog entirely. Christopher Tolkien (J. R. R.'s son, who is largely responsible for the Silmarillion existing) says it was probably just another balrog of high rank."
lotr,3cocqn,Darktidemage,2,Thu Jul 9 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"Kosomot was its Qenya form back when Gnomish Gothmog had a meaning like ""Strife and hatred"", ""war-hate"", or ""angry-hate"", with Tolkien waffling over whether the Qenya cognate was Kormot, Kosomoko, Kosomot, or Kosmoko. At this point Kosomot/Kalimbo was Melko's son through an ogress named Ulbandi/Fluithuin.  Later in the 30s Tolkien derived Gothmog from roots related to dread and oppression, though ""Dread Oppressor"" is never outright stated. He briefly considered it being Orkish ""Voice of Goth"", where ""Goth"" was Morgoth's Orc-name ""Lord or Master"".  Gothmog continues to show up in Tolkien's 1950s Silmarillion writings, though we aren't given a translation or derivation in Sindarin proper. It's not clear if the Noldorin roots for ""dread"" and ""oppress"" in the 30s Etymologies appeared in later Sindarin (we have no examples), though Tolkien seemed to have wavered between whether goth ""enemy"" in Morgoth came from √KOT, √KHOT, or √ÑGOT(H) in later Sindarin (it was √KOT in Etymologies).  We never see a Q(u)enya equivalent of Gothmog in writings after c. 1920."

Like I said, there's only the exceptions of The Old Took and Bilbo - and one of them was aided by a magic ring!   Hobbits seem to rarely die 'early' - at least the hobbits we have lifespans for. They more or less all hit their general lifespan, but once they do they start dropping like flies. With some exceptions, most hobbits we have lifespans for fall into the rather narrow limit of late 80s to early 100s, with most in their 90s. That's very much in the realm of a human lifespan.   Frodo at 50 isn't even considered middle aged   Source? Because here's how Frodo is described from 33 to 50:   As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of good 'preservation': outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. 'Some folk have all the luck,' they said; but it was not until Frodo approached the more sober age of fifty that they began to think it queer."

lotr,3cn1tk,Emphursis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:20:06 2015 UTC,"'Just out of his tweens' means 33 - an age for humans that I think is fair to hold up as being 'robust and energetic.' It's really around the age that a fit human physique peaks. And fifty for humans is very much a 'more sober age' as well.  While we do think it's strange that someone in their mid-30s would look like someone in their late teens/early 20s, the specific descriptions of what those ages experience don't align with what we'd expect from humans at early 20s/mid 30s."

I believe I may have already mentioned it, but making the assumption that 'savages' are black-skinned is really fucking racist.  On the other hand, southern Gondor is all 'swart' and the Harfoot branch of hobbits are specifically noted as browner than the rest, so we don't really need to point to the Drugs as the only dark-skinned good guys, if they even are that."

Tolkien was influenced by the original Norse and German sagas, not Wagner's version, which he considered a bastardization.

Now for the Dwarves, they wanted to exit Mirkwood in the northeast near Dale. The evil of the Necromancer spread from the southeast. Perhaps the white stag would not go near that evil and stay farthest from the ""Mirky"" areas of Mirkwood.  I think that the sentence of ""meaning of the hunt and the white dear"" means that hunters (Elves, Men?) would have known the symbolism of the white deer and see it as a sign of good luck or an omen, but the Dwarves were unaware of this connotation so they didn't know."

lotr,3clqsc,agitatedshovel,16,Wed Jul 8 22:03:08 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say. I would guess that she most certainly would have been corrupted. I also would guess that, as Galadriel is one of the Eldar that has seen the light of the trees as well as being one of the older beings in Middle Earth, she would be quite powerful."
lotr,3clqsc,lethargicllama,14,Wed Jul 8 23:34:10 2015 UTC,"She was the most powerful and second oldest elf (save for Cirdan) in middle earth at the time.   Basically what would happen is she would have quickly destroyed Sauron and ruled over a long period of peace, that would eventually dwindle and descend into tyranny over a long period of time.   The evil wouldn't kick in instantly, it would creep in subtly through the hubris that comes from being that powerful."
lotr,3clqsc,Elliot850,10,Thu Jul 9 00:10:51 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say quickly destroyed Sauron.  Tolkien was skeptical Gandalf could have beaten Sauron at all. Though he said if Gamdalf could have Galadriel and Elrond could have as well.
lotr,3clqsc,italia06823834,4,Thu Jul 9 00:21:08 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I was just thinking about it, but I wonder what exactly is meant by ""beat"" in this context...  If the ring endured, Sauron would. (Am I right, or that just the movie mythos clouding my memory)?  So, Sauron might have ""given up"" quickly to avoid further weakening himself, and let the ring corrupt her. He did something similar before. He is very patient. As soon as she revealed the One, he might have just waited for it to corrupt her, and then worked himself as the true behind the scenes leader (like in Numenor).  What do you all think?"
lotr,3clqsc,sdb2754,4,Thu Jul 9 01:46:57 2015 UTC,"By ""beaten"" I mean utterly defeated.  Anyone who claims the Ring will eventually have to fight Sauron's will for control of it, or more likely, raise an army large enough to defeat him. If anyone could wrestle control away from Sauron he would be destroyed, as he is with its destruction.  Of Mortals, no one could have done this.  Tolkien describes Gandalf as maybe being able to wrestle control of the Ring away from Sauron.    Of the others only Gandalf might be expected to  master him  – being an emissary of the Powers and a creature of the same  order,  an immortal spirit taking a visible physical form. In the 'Mirror of Galadriel', 1381, it appears that Galadriel conceived  of herself as capable of wielding the Ring and supplanting the Dark Lord. If so, so  also were the other guardians  of the Three, especially Elrond. But this is another matter. It was part of  the essential deceit of  the Ring to fill minds with imaginations of  supreme power. But this the Great  had well considered and  had rejected, as is seen in Elrond's words at the Council. Galadriel's rejection of the temptation was founded upon previous thought and resolve. In any case Elrond or Galadriel would have proceeded in the policy now adopted by Sauron: they would have built up an empire with great and absolutely subservient generals and armies and engines of war, until  they could challenge Sauron and destroy him  by force. Confrontation of Sauron alone, unaided, self to self was not  contemplated. One can imagine the scene in which Gandalf, say, was placed in such a position. It  would be a delicate balance. On one side the true allegiance of  the Ring to Sauron; on the other  superior strength because Sauron was not actually in possession, and  perhaps also  because he was weakened by long corruption and expenditure of  will in dominating inferiors. If  Gandalf  proved the victor, the result would have  been for Sauron the same  as the destruction of the Ring; for him  it would have  been destroyed, taken from  him  for ever. But the Ring and all its works would have endured. It would have been the master in the end.   Gandalf as Ring-Lord would have been far  worse than Sauron. He would have remained 'righteous',  but self-righteous. He would have continued to rule and order things for 'good', and the benefit of his subjects according to his wisdom  (which was and would have remained great).  [The  draft ends  here.  In the margin  Tolkien  wrote:  'Thus  while Sauron  multiplied  [illegible word] evil,  he left  ""good"" clearly  distinguishable  from  it.  Gandalf  would  have  made good  detestable  and seem  evil.']"
lotr,3clqsc,italia06823834,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:47:21 2015 UTC,"Why do they need to fight Sauron's will for control of it? I never read that anywhere. I think the ""master [the Ring]"" in the bit you posted means that they would need to learn how to control it, and that someone like Frodo couldn't really use its full benefit, while someone like Gandalf might be able to learn. Remember, Frodo used the Ring to control Gollum right before Mount Doom (at least from Sam's perspective)."
lotr,3clqsc,ReinierPersoon,2,Thu Jul 9 11:34:55 2015 UTC,"While [Sauron] wore it, his power on earth was actually enhanced. But even if he did not wear it, that power existed and was in 'rapport' with himself: he was not 'diminished'. Unless some other seized it and became possessed of it. If that happened, the new possessor could (if sufficiently strong and heroic by nature) challenged Sauron, become master of all that he had learned or done since the making of the One Ring, and so overthrow him and usurp his place. - Letter 131   It's not just about holding the Ring, it's about actually wresting the 'rapport' away from Sauron and possessing it yourself. In that sense it's not about being wise enough or ""learning how to control it,"" rather it's about being ""sufficiently strong and heroic."" That's also why they need to fight to control the Ring."
lotr,3clqsc,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:10:45 2015 UTC,"Well, as described in the quote, they would have to defeat Sauron either through Military force, or less likely direct self to self confrontation.  I mainly was just using this to detail how it was still not easy and I doubt Sauron would ""quickly"" be defeated."
lotr,3clqsc,italia06823834,2,Thu Jul 9 11:49:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would assume that just about anyone would avoid a one on one confrontation with Sauron, including Sauron himself. He only reluctantly came out of Barad-dur to face Elendil and Gil-galad.  I would say that if Gandalf (or maybe Aragorn or Galadriel or Glorfindel) would have the Ring and enough time they could control most of the Free Peoples and maybe even some of Sauron's allies such as the Haradrim or the Easterlings.  It's always a bit hard to say how powerful all these people are compared to others, but I think it's safe to assume that anyone from the First Age is over 9000."
lotr,3clqsc,ReinierPersoon,6,Thu Jul 9 11:58:41 2015 UTC,"I think he would've ran away like a scared jackrabbit.    Sauron made the Ring into a sort of horcrux: he didn't die in the Second Age (mostly) because the Ring remained intact.    But I think that someone powerful enough of will to fully utilize the Ring could have used it to completely destroy Sauron...or at least to beat him so badly that he can't ever take any kind of shape or wield any kind of power again.  In effect, losing ""control"" of the Ring would be as bad for Sauron as if it had been destroyed.    But that transaction goes both ways: the Ring's corruption turns you into a Dark Lord yourself, and so you throw down Sauron only to take his place.  That's what Sauron expected...and Aragorn frightened him badly enough with that prospect that he launched open war before he was ready for it.    TL;DR: Sauron thought Aragorn had the Ring, and that scared him badly enough to go to war prematurely.    If Galadriel had possessed the Ring, Sauron would have been in serious trouble because she could use it better and faster.  I think he would have bailed."
lotr,3clqsc,iBear83,3,Thu Jul 9 03:15:11 2015 UTC,"Sauron made the Ring into a sort of horcrux: he didn't die in the Second Age (mostly) because the Ring remained intact.   Actually this is a somewhat common misconception. The Ring is not like a horcrux from Harry Potter. In Tolkien no one splits their souls; in fact it's probably not possible but I don't recall the passage to back that up. Sauron put his power into the Ring as a means of controlling and dominating others. When he loses the Ring, he loses direct contact with that power, not a piece of his soul/life. Even when not in his possession, however, the power is in ""rapport"" with Sauron. That's why it takes such an incredibly powerful being (Gandalf/Galadriel/Elrond) to wrest control of it away from him. Once the Ring was destroyed Sauron did not (strictly speaking) die. Rather as you inferred, he was ""reduced to a shadow"" and ""a mere memory of malicious will."""
lotr,3clqsc,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:46:15 2015 UTC,"No, the Ring does not contain a part of Sauron's soul.  It is not a horcrux.  It is like a horcrux in that the existence of the Ring, even when it isn't in his possession, grants him access to a certain amount of the power it contains.  Including the power to preserve his life after the Downfall of Numenor.  Maiar can die, and that cataclysm probably would have killed him without the Ring."
lotr,3clqsc,iBear83,4,Thu Jul 9 17:42:08 2015 UTC,"and that cataclysm probably would have killed him without the Ring.   It did kill him. But if you mean permanently, then probably not. His death in II 3441 would probably have been his last without the Ring, but the speed at which he returns after Numenor, and the fact that the form he took was new (though more constrained), seem to indicate he could have recovered from his drowning regardless, like he recovered from his first death before he made the Ring."
lotr,3clqsc,Uluithiad,2,Thu Jul 9 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"It is like a horcrux in that the existence of the Ring, even when it isn't in his possession, grants him access to a certain amount of the power it contains.   I'm not sure how that makes it like a horcrux. It may have functioned in a manner broadly analogous to one but the Ring is fundamentally different from a horcrux in its purpose and power. My understanding of a horcrux is that it physically holds your soul to earth, so that in the event of your death, you can essentially reincarnate. Ainur, and in this case a Maia, are already tied to Arda and have the ability to incarnate inherent to their being. They are (in their ""natural"" form) spirits that have been bound to Arda through the act of entering it. Sauron didn't need the Ring to incarnate himself. Every time Sauron ""dies"" it's merely the destruction of the physical vessel that holds him, not the spirit itself. Consider this passage from Letter 200:   It was thus that Sauron appeared in this shape. It is mythologically supposed that when this shape was 'real', that is a physical actuality in the physical world and not a vision transferred from mind to mind, it took some time to build up. It was then destructible like other physical organism. But that of course did not destroy the spirit, nor dismiss it from the world to which it was bound until the end. After the battle with Gil-galad and Elendil, Sauron took a long while to re-build, longer than he had done after the Downfall of Númenor (I suppose because each building-up used up some of the inherent energy of the spirit, which might be called the 'will' or the effective link between the indestructible mind and being and the realization of its imagination). The impossibility of re-building after the destruction of the Ring, is sufficiently clear 'mythologically' in the present book.   If, when you say ""die"", you are simply referring to the destruction of his body then Sauron ""died"" three times. Once during the Downfall of Númenor, Once at the hands of Gil-galad and Elendil, and one final time once the Ring was destroyed. However his spirit never died. It endured even after the Ring was destroyed. It was simply so reduced in willpower at that point that it was incapable of any meaningful interaction with the physical world."

We don't have that as much for Beren and Lúthien or the Fall of Gondolin. Expanding one of the other Great Tales into a publishable standalone format would require much more outright invention than I think CT is comfortable with. He isn't Brian Herbert."

It could be easy, especially if, say, Frodo with the Ring is brought, or if the Ring and other effects were handled by someone without any clue of what they were carrying. Sure, if someone like Grishnakh, who knew a wee bit more about all of it than he should, got the Ring, it would probably have to be captured from him. But that shouldn't be too hard, and after definitively identifying who had it and where they were, Sauron could of course send his more reliable servants, like the Nazgul."

lotr,3chh59,bmrobin,19,Wed Jul 8 02:53:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, at the time of the War of the Ring he had once again formed a corporeal body:   Sauron should be thought of as very terrible. The form that he took was that of a man of more than human stature, but not gigantic. - Letter 246   Not only did Tolkien think Sauron had a physical for but, to take it a step further, the characters did as well. As the Captains of the West stood before the Black Hate, Aragorn issues the following challenge:   Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth! Justice shall be done upon him. - Book V, Ch 10   He clearly thinks of Sauron as a physical being capable of 'coming forth' and having 'justice done upon him'. In fact this is one of the few direct quotes that made it into the films, something I always found ironic considering the films' consistent portrayal of Sauron as a decidedly non-corporeal eye."
lotr,3chh59,EyeceEyeceBaby,11,Wed Jul 8 03:12:29 2015 UTC,"In The Two Towers, gollum mentions the Dark Lord is missing a finger. That would imply that he (Sauron) has a physical body that is perceivable by non-istari."

lotr,3chh59,alrickattack,10,Wed Jul 8 04:59:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, but he has a body. Tolkien writes in his letters:  ""It was because of this pre-occupation with the Children of God that the spirits so often took the form and likeness of the Children, especially after their appearance. It was thus that Sauron appeared in this shape. It is mythologically supposed that when this shape was 'real', that is a physical actuality in the physical world and not a vision transferred from mind to mind, it took some time to build up. It was then destructible like other physical organisms. But that of course did not destroy the spirit, nor dismiss it from the world to which it was bound until the end. After the battle with Gil-galad and Elendil, Sauron took a long while to re-build, longer than he had done after the Downfall of Númenor (I suppose because each building-up used up some of the inherent energy of the spirit, which might be called the 'will' or the effective link between the indestructible mind and being and the realization of its imagination). The impossibility of re-building after the destruction of the Ring, is sufficiently clear 'mythologically' in the present book.""  ""Sauron should be thought of as very terrible. The form that he took was that of a man of more than human stature, but not gigantic.""  So he did have a body during the end of the Third Age. Also it seems that Gollum has seen Sauron and says that ""he has only four fingers in his Black Hand, but those are enough""."

I guess Sauron took the Rings back from them before he lost the One Ring, and controlled them by having their Rings.  As far as we know the Ringwraiths were completely loyal to Sauron during the time of Frodo. Long before that they even worked for Sauron when he himself was in hiding recovering his strength after getting killed.  Only the Three were not touched by Sauron, meaning he was involved in the creation of the Nine and the Seven. Likely he deliberately made them to turn their bearers into his slaves by making them wraiths."

lotr,3cf7ao,tlb3131,41,Tue Jul 7 15:23:59 2015 UTC,"True, but he picks up where Frodo had left off. Frodo left Chapter 80 unfinished leaving the rest of Chapter 80 (Book VI, Ch. 8 - The Scouring of the Shire) and All of Chapter 81 (Book VI, Ch. 9 - The Grey Havens) to be written by Sam (assuming Tolkien was counting the chapters in this manner). The line OP is referring to would have been written by Frodo. I could easily imagine him adding the ""not near enough, I'll warrant"" line as a reference to Sam's frequent use of the phrase. He probably heard him say it numerous times  in reference to pipe-weed while on their journey."

He probably heard him say it numerous times in reference to pipe-weed while on their journey.   I like this interpretation. Doing a quick scan through the text for the word ""warrant"".   Ted Sandyman in conversation with Sam about the Elves sailing West in ""The Shadow of the Past"". The quote from the OP in ""The Ring Goes South"". Ugluk talking back to Grishnakh in ""The Uruk-Hai"". Sam commenting on a bog being nearby, on the likelihood of Gollum throttling them in their sleep, and the possibility of Gollum sneaking off to betray their location to orcs in ""The Taming of Smeagol"". Sam again while discussing sleep shifts with Frodo in ""The Passage of the Marshes"". Sam while discussing what the cause of the smell of Shelob's tunnel is in ""Shelob's Lair"".   So consistently in more ""rustic"" characters' speech than anything Frodo would have been likely to say on his own - if not an attempt to interject what Sam actually thought at that moment in the journey (a parenthetical aside without quotation marks), then at least an attempt to capture his sentiment later."

It's exactly the sort of thing that Sam would be likely to think at the time, while I can't even guess what the narrator would mean by it. (""Boy, that Sam sure is a heavy smoker!"") It's explicitly in the context of the thoughts going through Sam's own mind.

lotr,3cf7ao,helljumper230,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:57:13 2015 UTC,Yes. It's called focalization -- the narrator takes on the persona of the character without having the character use quotation marks.

lotr,3cf7ao,davy_crockett,2,Tue Jul 7 19:53:37 2015 UTC,"No, I think the people saying the ""I"" in ""I'll warrant"" is Sam are wrong. That sentence refers to Sam in the third person, so it can't then go and refer to him in the third person. You can't switch speaker in mid-sentence."
lotr,3cf7ao,davy_crockett,3,Tue Jul 7 20:34:41 2015 UTC,"That was my thinking as well, but I can't argue with the comment assigning narration to Frodo. I had never thought about it as such, and even if it is the case, it's a unique one and kind of neat."
lotr,3cf7ao,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Tue Jul 7 20:45:32 2015 UTC,"If it was Frodo, it would be weird for him to use the present tense. Since he was there to ""warrant"" it at the time, wouldn't he say something like ""I didn't think it was enough pipeweed?"" He's not making the the assessment about pipeweed while writing, is he?"
lotr,3cf7ao,AssaultedCracker,5,Tue Jul 7 21:02:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's all that weird. Frodo's relationship with Sam is one of a close friendship. The insertion of one of Sam's ""catchphrases"" as a narrative comment is, in this instance, a rather humorous jibe at his friend's character and I think we can interpret that as Frodo's intent. Simply adding some dialogue from Frodo wouldn't really translate the meaning of the clause in question. He could have had Sam actually say the line, though in the context of the paragraph I think it's more effective as a parenthetical phrase.  One might better write the line (to convey the meaning at least):   Sam eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in his mind all the things that he had stowed in it, wondering if he had forgotten anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and the little box of salt that he always carried and refilled when he could; a good supply of pipe-weed (but, as he noted all too often, ""not near enough, I'll warrant""); flint and tinder; woolen hose; linen; various small belongings of his master's that Frodo had forgotten and Sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were called for. He went through them all.   When you read it as Frodo's writing, it's not just another passage describing the Company preparing to depart, it's some insight into Frodo's relationship with Sam as well."
lotr,3cf7ao,rocketman0739,2,Tue Jul 7 21:28:46 2015 UTC,"That might be a stretch. While from a purely grammatical standpoint the narrator should keep his tenses straight, when you have a character in your story narrating something you can't assume that they will do so, and in fact I personally find that it lends a little to the narration to have him break out of the past tense. It doesn't mean he was assessing it right at that moment, because if he had assessed it in the past and had no reason to change his mind since, then he would still currently warrant it."
lotr,3cf7ao,MaesterKupo,6,Tue Jul 7 21:26:27 2015 UTC,"Sam is going over this anxiously in his mind, remember? I'm pretty sure those are his own thoughts."

He does it so much in the Hobbit that it felt out of place in LotR after not seeing it for so long. But, as others said, Bilbo may kay be more self-referential than Frodo/Sam."
lotr,3cf7ao,Meneros,2,Tue Jul 7 17:19:23 2015 UTC,"The whole conception of the Lord of the Rings is based upon the premise that Tolkien is merely a translator into English of an already translated retelling of Bilbo/Frodo and Sam's story. Therefore, it's not really self-referential. Tolkien is obviously the author - but in this context it's Frodo recalling what happened, and then adding an aside, which Tolkien then found and translated. Or something like that."

lotr,3chhxa,urukhai434,11,Tue Jul 7 23:12:57 2015 UTC,"There are parts of it that read very similarly to Lord of the Rings, and parts that are much harder to get through.  Having read through it several times, I find that it improves with repetition.  The thing about it is that it's just so dense, even more so than LotR is.  I would say it gets much easier to read as it goes though, the first third or so is a little drier in my opinion.  Everything to do with the awakening of the Elves and the Valar and the designs of Eru for Middle Earth is a lot more abstract than LotR because they all deal with locations and characters we don't get to spend as much time with, and are therefor less familiar with (but certainly no less cool).  However I think the later chapters, particularly once Faenor and Fingolfin come to Middle Earth, become a lot easier to wrap your head around.  Basically anything involving Fingolfin is fantastically compelling and badass.  I would definitely recommend it if you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings even a little, because I think it's greatest strength is in how much it enhances that story.  It gives so much more depth to the world of Arda while being very interesting on it's own."
lotr,3chhxa,FjordPuncher,3,Wed Jul 8 00:11:45 2015 UTC,"This summer Tolkien's work is my project.  I started with The Silmarillion and this is probably the best way I would describe it.  The first 1/3 is most similar to Biblical texts, specifically Old Testament writing.  Abstract, grand, hard to picture and understand.  Then you move to the middle bit.  I would compare this to classical mythology in our world, written in the LotR-verse.  Think Beowulf, The Illiad and The Odessey for comparisons (both in writing form and in content).  The ~1/3 is fairly straightforward storytelling.  Most similar, I think, to a modern translation of Chaucer, Gawain leys, or perhaps, Paradise Lost (in that there's a clear plot).  Just a brief interpretation and comparison from my first readthough.  I'm only just starting The Two Towers now."
lotr,3chhxa,dunkster91,5,Thu Jul 9 15:59:19 2015 UTC,"Its much harder to read than LotR imo. It isn't really a continuous story, and is more like an abridged history told through short stories. This makes the pacing awful compared to an actual continuous novel/story, it doesn't wrap you up in an adventure or anything like that.   Some of the stories are epic and some are boring. But the epic ones are EPIC, like way way more epic then the story of the ring. There are definitely moments that will give you chills.   I gave actually gave up on it the first time I tried to read it, and got back into it listening to the audio-book while I was working (found it on youtube) I just found it easier to remember the characters names (there are about a million of them) so if your struggling to be interested, I'd give that a try."
lotr,3chhxa,pullingthestringz,6,Wed Jul 8 00:34:10 2015 UTC,"This makes the pacing awful compared to an actual continuous novel/story   It's awful pacing if you're looking for a novel, though in that regard it also has awful characterization, dialogue, plotline, etc.  Of course, that's all just to say that it isn't a novel. It was written to be a mythological text like the Eddas or the Bible (particularly more like the Old Testament than the New). To some people, such works actually have greater appeal than the modern novel."
lotr,3chhxa,Edledhron,3,Wed Jul 8 02:08:41 2015 UTC,"I like to think of it as a framing device for all of his other books.  It condenses huge stories into small chapters with little dialogue and description, but serves as a reference for when such events take place in context.   So take CoH for example, which is a fantastic book on its own. It's an entire novel of around 300 pages that is condensed into 20 - odd pages in The Sil. But it serves to illustrate exactly where that story fits in along with everything else going on in the world."

It takes place in different regions of Middle Earth than LOTR (mostly ones that are destroyed, sunk or moved by the time of LOTR). I would recommend finding an on-line summary and reading it along with the book to get a better grasp of the stoires. Also, keep notes of the names. There are a lot of characters and, being Elves, they live for a long time and keep reappearing throughout the stories.  Read through some of the histories in the ROTK appendices first and it will give you a good overview of the ages history of Middle Earth and how it connects to the Third Age in LOTR before you get into more detail in the Silmarilion."

The first chapter, Ainulindale about the Song of the Ainur, was the most difficult for me but the book really picked up after that. It is jam-packed with a lot of history, it talks about different lineages of elves and men and its going to drop a lot of names on you. When I got to the section about the different families of men, and they all had similar sounding names (Huor, Hurin, Tuor, Turin ohmygawd) my head was spinning a little. What helped me was pulling up a family tree and having that with me while I read, so I could keep track of who was who.  The Silmarillion is now my favorite piece of Tolkien literature. Some chapters were more difficult for me than others, some chapters I sped through and had no trouble at all. Basically, if you love elves you will love the Silmarillion."

Then the dwarfs woke him up... and that pissed him off as we know.  Then another 1k years before the events of the lotr.   Gandalf had passed through many times before... but never used his powers. But this time... He had a wrestling match with sarumon on the roof of the balrogs house. Then had lit a fire.. and gid knows what other but of power he used.. maybe he used power to work out which of the 3 paths to take?   Well the balrog can sense this... so wakes up and goes to see who the heck is making all this noise. Sees someone who would have been on the oposite side of the split when he followed morgoth. .. and attacked.  I mean what is this guy doing in HIS dungeons!
lotr,3cf289,MagnusRune,7,Tue Jul 7 19:20:05 2015 UTC,"Here is the u/Uluithiad's explanation to which you are referring (I read it as well). Some small corrections though, Gandalf probably hadn't passed through ""many times."" In fact as far as we know he had only entered once before, searching for Thráin (remember, he nearly got lost in FotR). Also he did not have ""a wrestling match with Saruman."" If you reread the passage, the source of the intense weather and falling stones is left ambiguous. Boromir thinks it might be Sauron (though Gimli is doubtful); Gandalf seems to imply (or at least does not deny) that it might be the work of Sauron; Aragorn explicitly blames it on the wind; Gimli also implies it might be the mountain itself. In fact Saruman is notably absent from speculation. Only in the films is he responsible for the barring of the pass."

It's not a very good replica as the blade seems to be some kind of chromed steel, it's also the wrong shape, and the hilt is made of the wrong materiel (some plastic with more plastic leaves, instead of deep red wood with a metal inlay of the silver leaf vines) But it came with a scabbard which is nice.  You can get one of the United Cutlery (stainless steel made in china) wallhangers for around $130 - $200 usd without shipping. They come in Hobbit size and actual prop size so that changes the price. It's not functional, of course, but at least it's the right colors. You might be able to find other producers, but united cutlery has the liscenced products.  You can also get them with or without the inscription of Sting's name.  Weta also did a limited run reforging of the lotr swords. They were all Hero quality ( real materials, spring steel, functional if sharpened) and they only made 10 of each blade. The Stings cost around $8000 USD."

lotr,3cc5fo,humblepudding1,2,Mon Jul 6 19:36:53 2015 UTC,"Well personally I'm more curious about visits to Tol Morwen. I always like to imagine the Númenoreans made trips there. This map from the Atlas of Middle-Earth quite clearly shows visits to Tol Morwen, Tol Fuin, and Himring but unfortunately it's nothing more than speculation. Tolkien never really gave detailed accounts of their voyages.  As for the existence of a trove of Elvish artifacts on Himring, I'm not sure how much would have survived. It's true the hill remained above the water line but remember, Belegost and Nogrod were ruined in the War of Wrath but not necessarily submerged (as were the Ered Luin in general). To me it's probable that much or all of the fortifications would have been ruined and possibly even buried. They would need some Númenorean archaeologists to find them!"
lotr,3cc5fo,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Mon Jul 6 22:03:38 2015 UTC,"Visits to Tol Morwen would definitely be neat; would the grave marker have survived?   Numenorean archaeologists sounds like a great concept to toy around with, though not in line with the spirit of the works. Imagine primitive diving bells and an underwater expedition to the ruins of Gondolin!"
lotr,3cc5fo,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"Many of the Númenoreans probably believed they could make better weapons themselves. Their descendents in Arnor made the blades the hobbits get from Tom.  During the time of Númenor I get the feeling they were the most powerful state in Middle-earth by far. Sauron's armies wouldn't even fight them. They wouldn't need more weapons, Morgoth was gone and Sauron was too weak to even challenge them. Even the Valar and the Eldar of Valinor wouldn't stand against them."
lotr,3cc5fo,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:01:42 2015 UTC,I doubt any weapon made by the Numenoreans could have been better than a weapon made by Feanor. He learned from Aule and is universally recognized as the greatest non-Ainu craftsman of all time.
lotr,3cc5fo,Melonskal,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"Then they probably didn't find many great weapons to bring to Middle-earth, since Narsil/Andúril was made by Telchar the Dwarf. Glamdring, Orcrist and Sting are described as being from Gondolin. I'm not sure if it is ever said but they were found near Eregion, so it might make sense they were taken to Eregion by survivors from Beleriand.  Come to think of it, I think the only things in Middle-earth that we know for certain come from Valinor are the Palantíri."

lotr,3cc5fo,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, Eru had no trouble burying the whole Númenorean army under the earth.  Perhaps the Valar were afraid that a war such as the War of Wrath would destroy Valinor like it had destroyed Beleriand? Another time where matching power with power had disastrous effects, and why the Istari were sent to counter Sauron and not a host of Valar and Valinor-Elves. The Valar together with the Vanyar, Noldor and perhaps Teleri might have won, but the destruction could have destroyed their continent.  I get the impression that the Númenoreans really were the most powerful people of their time. They bailed out the remaining Elves of Middle-earth when Sauron was roflstomping them. They made the Men of Middle-earth submit to them, and the armies of Sauron wouldn't even face them. They had fleets and armies filled with superhumans with superior technology, and they seemed to outnumber pretty much everyone."
lotr,3c6r09,danedaddy,134,Sun Jul 5 11:02:00 2015 UTC,"If you've read The Hobbit, you may have noticed how it's told from a historical perspective, i.e. someone is telling the story as if it happened long ago in a forest far, far away. It's essentially told by a modern-day narrator, who recounts the stuff that happened in the olden, mystical, magical days. This modern narrator tends to sprinkle in little anachronisms like this here and there.  The early chapters of LOTR share some similarities with the writing style of The Hobbit. Tolkien hadn't established his epic high fantasy writing style yet, so it was still being told as a bit of a fairy tale. That's where these little anachronisms come from.  It's also mentioned that some hobbits have clocks in their homes, an invention that isn't seen anywhere else in Middle Earth. It's most likely due to Tolkien's transition between writing styles between The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings."
lotr,3c6r09,JWson,39,Sun Jul 5 12:38:13 2015 UTC,"The Shire is supposed to be rustic England. Perhaps it is meant to help the reader identify with the ""modern"" hobbits. They have a postal system and a museum (the Mathom-house), which feels semi-Victorian."

Although this part about the goblin's nature really shows off the narrator's modern viewpoint:  ""Now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted. They make no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones. It is not unlikely that they invented some of the machines that have since troubled the world, especially the ingenious devices for killing large numbers of people at once, for wheels and engines and explosions always delighted them, and also not working with their own hands more than they could help; but in those days and those wild parts they had not advanced (as it is called) so far."""

The Hobbit is a book written for children, it was a story Tolkien told his own children when they were young. LotR is more serious in tone and a bit darker, and The Silmarillion is written like a history book and has some pretty dark and sad stories in it.  The books are written as if the author is the translator of old books from Middle-earth."

I'm not suggesting the Shire had a train network, but the language during the Shire bits seems a bit more modern than the later stuff. The Shire seems ""near-Victorian"" compared to the rest of Middle-earth. They have post offices, hobbits write letters to each other, they have fireworks (through Gandalf, but still). Compare to Rohan which seems to be a medieval and feudal society with an oral tradition where they remember their ancestors through songs. They even speak Anglo-Saxon a few times."

lotr,3c6r09,Forestthegreat,21,Sun Jul 5 12:14:20 2015 UTC,"""Technologically advanced"" isn't really a good thing in the Middle-earth universe. It has a fairly anti-industrialisation tone to it. Saruman tries to turn the Shire into an industrial society and he is stopped, and that is considered a good thing in the books. The people held in highest regard are the gardeners and the farmers, not the people who build machines. See how Tom Bombadil talks of farmer Maggot. The hero of the story is Sam, the apprentice of a gardener. The heroic Rohirrim are semi-literate horsemen whose palace is a mead-hall.  The Elves are (or were) advanced in the sense that they created things beyond the understanding of other people. Galadriel is asked about ""magic"" but does not understand the word, to them they are arts and crafts. But the Elves are not industrial at all."

They all ducked, and many fell flat on their faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.""  Dang, that first sentence is like a case study in punctuation marks."
lotr,3c6r09,zgrove,14,Mon Jul 6 19:43:54 2015 UTC,"LOTR is meant to be a document (The Red Book of Westmarch) that we have access to as translated into language and metaphors of the modern age, hence the use of Roman days of the week, etc. Presumably the express train is a translator's unwieldy attempt to make modern readers feel the force of the dragon.   Much more here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Book_of_Westmarch"
lotr,3c6r09,humblepudding1,5,Sun Jul 5 14:21:52 2015 UTC,"When Beorn arrives a the Battle of Five Armies, his roar is described as being ""like drums and guns.""  And at the beginning of Riddles in the Dark, Bilbo is quite disappointed to not have any matches on him.  As noted before, Tolkien didn't lock down technology levels or time frames until later in his writing process."
lotr,3c6r09,zgrove,3,Sun Jul 5 20:41:40 2015 UTC,"The foreword in my copy gave me the impression that it's Tolkien telling the story that he ""got"" from Bilbo, and so it makes sense that way.  It's definitely the black sheep of the entire Middle Earth collection"

lotr,3c6r09,zgrove,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:31:45 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it's in the first edition as it seems reactionary to publishers changing his own words (like making Dwarves Dwarfs and that type of thing).  If you're still interested though it says:  ""This is a story of long ago. At the time the languages and letters were quite different from ours today. English is used to represent the languages. But two points may be noted. (1) In English the only correct plural of dwarf is dwarfs, and the adjective is dwarfish. In this story dwarves and dwarvish are used, but only when speaking of the ancient people whom Thorin Oakenshield and his company belonged.""  This always gave me the impression of a narrator from our world. I attribute that to Tolkien writing the Hobbit in sort of a fairytale way (like most fantasy was before him) before he came up with the concept of making it a whole other world and establishing epic fantasy as a standard."

If you read the hobbit, there are, as other's have stated, similar descriptions. This style of story telling seemed to be refined over the the trilogy. But its not out of place if you look at the evolution of The story starting from the Hobbit through Return of the King.

This is the copy I've read most often as I've had them the longest (since around 1994) and they're the easiest to carry around. Pretty beat up condition at this point, though.  The Houghton Mifflin Harcourt centenary edition, single-volume hardback of LotR illustrated by Alan Lee. I got this as a Christmas gift from a girlfriend in 1998 and have read it all the way through only once, but I tend to go to it when I need to look something up rather than the paperbacks.  I have the matching edition of The Hobbit from 1997 that I picked up a year or two later.  For the Silmarillion, I got the Ted Nasmith illustrated one from 1998 that I know I had by the summer of 2000 as that's the first time I read it. Some time ago, I want to say around 2008 or 2009, I picked up a copy of the first American edition that still had the map for $5 (I keep forgetting to look up which printing).  I also picked up the first edition of The Children of Húrin the day it became available.  Then for Christmas 2013 I received a hardcover of Unfinished Tales from a friend as part of a secret Santa thing and the amazing 3-volume complete History of Middle-earth from my girlfriend (now wife).  I suppose that Recorded Books (on CDs) copy of LotR goes here too.

Boromir is corrupted by the ring, but sees his error and comes to the aid of Merry and Pippin. The mountain men who turned to Sauron and broke their oaths to Isildur are cursed. Only when they help Aragorn are they set free. It can be argued that the greed of the men of Númenor was the crucible that allowed Sauron to gain his power. When Aragorn leads the dunedain to victory against Sauron, he unites the two kindoms of Arnor and Gondor, and the Dunedain regain the honor that was lost in the corruption of their ancestors."

lotr,3c39mz,jubale,2,Sun Jul 5 16:09:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. In a perfect effort to adapt stories from the Silmarillion visually, there should probably be different directors for different tales - and all should be huge Tolkien fanboys and not just in it for a chance to put their own spin on it or make it appeal to a wider audience. Then again, that is probably exactly what must happen if it is to stand a chance at the box office. The Ainulindalë is, I think, unfilmable. I don't see how it could be portrayed on the screen. (But I guess, that's what Tolkien thought of the trilogy. Who knows what will happen?)"

Or do we have writings that capture his thoughts on derivative works or on what matters most to him about the tale?

lotr,3c39mz,jubale,8,Sun Jul 5 16:14:51 2015 UTC,"Or do we have writings that capture his thoughts on derivative works or on what matters most to him about the tale?   A metric shitton. Letter 210 is a nice primer. Jackson does many of the things Tolkien decries there, and Tolkien wasn't even listing off things that would displease him, only things that did displease him in the Zimmerman script."
lotr,3c39mz,Uluithiad,3,Sun Jul 5 17:45:08 2015 UTC,"Yes to the second! We do have his words on derivative works and what matters most to him about the story. These are found in the work The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien.  For example, letter 210 dates from 1958 and concerns the question of adaptations. In particular Tolkien's many problems with Morton Grady Zimmerman's proposed film version of the Lord of the Rings.  The most applicable complaint concerns changes done to the scene on Weathertop when the Ring-wraiths confront the hobbits and Aragorn. In this screenplay version Sam actually stabs one of the wraiths, and Aragorn whips forth a sword and hacks here and there at them. The wraiths also ""spur on"" their mounts in a charge of some kind at the fellowship. The Jackson version clearly sets Aragorn up to be far more effective than his book-counterpart. He single-handedly drives the wraiths away (something that Gandalf with all his magic was not able to do in the book a few days earlier), while the wraiths in the book simply retreat in the confusion once they stab Frodo. Aragorn's presence is imperative to the hobbit's survival in both version though, so whatever.  More importantly, Christopher Tolkien has stated his dislike of the Jackson trilogy, and he is the closest to his father and the most similar in opinion. I mean you could argue that Christopher Tolkien might be a little over-protective of his father's work whereas his father sold the film rights and talked about how if he did not have great control over the screenplay he had better be payed an awful lot instead (!). But that's a little condescending I think.  There's an excellent quote of Tolkien's that is bandied about quite a lot. It concerns the importance of not losing sight of the central themes of a story or work when adapting it to another medium. I think it's also from Letters, but I can't seem to find the darn thing right now! Oh well, it's quite good anyway.  Edit: As far as myth evolving with the telling, I remember hearing similar things on theonering.net, but I can't recall any writing of the Professor's on the subject. It might be out there, but I can't claim to have any evidence of his opinion on the subject."

lotr,3c39mz,sethat,2,Sat Jul 4 16:59:02 2015 UTC,I would ask him what his greatest passion is and why. A wordsmith like Tolkien would likely have an inspiring answer to that question.
lotr,3c39mz,infernobassist,2,Sat Jul 4 23:50:03 2015 UTC,"A few years ago I would have answered with something related to Elvish (like Sindarin pronominal charts), but we have already seen some of those questions answered in newer issues of PE and VT, with more hinted at to come. Maybe I'd come up with a linguistic one decades from now after even more has been published, but there's the risk of asking something which will eventually be answered (or given enough material to speculate more accurately) in upcoming publications anyway.  I'd probably come up with something non-linguistic ... or maybe partially, like ""What are the (updated) names of the leaders of the Twelves Houses of Gondolin?"" Since he didn't finish his rewrite of the Fall of Gondolin, maybe he never sketched those out. Obviously Turgon, Egalmoth, Glorfindel, Ecthelion, Maeglin, Tuor are still okay, and Duilin might be unaltered (Rôg also fits into Sindarin phonology fine, though its etymology is uncertain), but as it currently stands Penlod is rather inappropriate (phonologically). Salgant may have been altered to Talagant or Talagand in the 1930s, though we don't know about after that. Certainly √TYAL still appears in the 1950s, but √ÑGAN(AD) hasn't appeared after the Etymologies, and some have speculated that the root may have been replaced."

Tolkien was heavily influences by Beowulf, more than anything a story like Beowulf encompasses the ideal of a story told like a story you would hear told around the dinner table generation to generation. That's really what Tolkien seemed to be trying to do..writing a story as if written by a character in the book, and as we know these characters often will break into song or tell long stories about old heroes like a folktale from Norse mythology or something.   A similar effect was used by Lucas in star wars, but his was much more visual in that he used existing technology in his world to allow the viewer to suspend their disbelief for the entire film series. Tolkien does this with his attention to detail. He created a fully formed world complete with history, religious based mythology and complex language groups.   Overall I think Tolkien both put more work in, and came in with more knowledge of folklore, which translated into a seemingly real fantasy world."

We can look to the Ring-verse and see what it does: it rules and binds. We see beings who don't care about ruling and binding being much more free from its effects: hobbits are a general example, and Bombadil an extreme one.  The Balrog is a being of destruction. It is not about ruling. It did not even order the Orcs that came into its home. It is not about order. It is a primeval spirit of destroying fire, and the Ring would have little to no pull on it, and be of little to no use to it."

lotr,3bxqq5,ebneter,14,Fri Jul 3 01:22:36 2015 UTC,"No, it was just hiding in Moria after fleeing the destruction of Angband at the end of the First Age. When the Dwarves dug really deep in Moria they woke it up and kind of pissed it off, so it chased them out. The Fellowship mostly made it curious and cranky, especially when it realized that there was another Maia (Gandalf) there — ""Bro, whatchyoo doin' in my house?"""

lotr,3bxqq5,Melonskal,2,Fri Jul 3 14:41:40 2015 UTC,But Gandalf never fought the balrog before? Or am I mistaken?
lotr,3bxqq5,MagnusRune,0,Fri Jul 3 17:15:55 2015 UTC,He would have been around at the start right? So when the balrogs sided with morgoth. They would have already met gandlaf.... but as miar (don't know spelling)   Even if they never directly met.. He would have realised he was a servant of eru and thus should be attacked
lotr,3bxqq5,Forestthegreat,2,Fri Jul 3 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"Quite!  However, the idea that Gandalf using his wizardry to start a fire on Caradhras would alert a Balrog DEEP in Moria to his presence is ridiculous. What Gandalf means is that his propensity for fireworks is well known throughout his haunts. I forget the context of the quote, but it is I believe in relation to the question of whether or not anyone is watching them from the mountainside."

lotr,3bqr61,UserUnknown2,104,Wed Jul 1 14:30:34 2015 UTC,"To my recollection, no this is not mentioned in the books.  There is a lot more to do with Boromir's death though. That horn he carries is a really big deal, a family heirloom passed down to the eldest son of the Stewards of Gondor. Aragon and Legolas sing a funeral dirge (there's a lot of singing in the books). And they just generally mourn his loss a lot more, and lament that they can't give him a hero's funeral.  But no, nothing about his bracers or other things, not that I remember.  .  .  Ya know, another thing about Boromir - his betrayal of the group is much different in the book. In the movie he's kind of a dick the whole time and eventually tries to take the ring out of greed and lust for power, but in the book he's trying to protect Frodo from the burden.  He talks to Frodo about the ring, warns him that it's a suicide mission. He complains about Elrond and Galadriel, says they're just tricking him into doing their dirty work - why aren't they out here running from orcs? Because the elves are complacent and aloof, content to stay in their comfortable homes while other people jump into volcanoes for them.  In his own way, he's trying to save Frodo. Going into a land of ancient evil and jumping into a volcano is the duty of a mighty hero of Gondor, not happy little fairy people from the forest.  And in fact, that's why Frodo runs off on his own. The ring corrupted Boromir's will, and Frodo knows it's only a matter of time before the rest of his friends turn on him too. In the movie they kind of glaze over that, but in the books his motives are more clear. The ring's power is corruption, and it will make all his friends betray him just like Boromir."

lotr,3bqr61,PostPostModernism,9,Wed Jul 1 16:06:38 2015 UTC,"Well, let's look at this more closely. Both are Men of Numenor, with the Stewards descending from the House of Hurin, and Aragorn being of direct descent from Isildur.   The House of Hurin is not a royal line, but it is Numenorean nonetheless, and thus they have slightly longer life than that of other Men, although they are not of the Half-elven bloodline, which includes the blood of Melian the Maia."
lotr,3bqr61,cjdeist92,2,Wed Jul 1 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, thanks!  I didn't know his family were Numenorians as well, I thought it was just Aragorn.  Guess I need to do some more lore reading on LOTR now!"
lotr,3bqr61,The_Juggler17,4,Wed Jul 1 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"Idk if they down play it that much. I mean, he still takes on several Uruk-hai single-handedly, even defeating several more as he's shot with the arrows."
lotr,3bqr61,Fallline048,7,Wed Jul 1 20:10:37 2015 UTC,"A little of both really.  Movie-Boromir was just more of a jerk about it. And after he attacks Frodo, he's yelling ""come back, I didn't mean it"" and he just doesn't seem very genuine about it, seems more like he's still trying to betray Frodo. Well in the book there's a lot more inner-monologue from Boromir, he realizes how the ring was corrupting his mind and twisting his words, and he really means it when he apologizes to Frodo.  But this is also to continue the recurring theme of the ring twisting around the good intentions of men - Isildur also said he could use it for good. And even in the elder days, Sauron seemed like a trustworthy ally to the Noldor and they meant to use his friendship to restore the diminished greatness of the world. Sauron just seems like he could be used for good.   So yeah, both a product of Boromir's selflessness and heroism mixed with the ring's power of corruption."
lotr,3bqr61,stationhollow,7,Wed Jul 1 20:36:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed, they could have done Boromir better, but even worse was their portrayal of Faramir. I mean, in the books he was supposed to by this symbol of the nobility and wisdom of men as they come into their own age. ""I would not take that if I were to find it by the road,"" he said of the ring. The movie made him just a lesser shadow of his brother who whisked the ringbearer off to fucking Osgiliath for some bizarre fucking reason."
lotr,3bqr61,Connor4Wilson,3,Wed Jul 1 17:03:31 2015 UTC,Book Boromir himself wouldn't be trying to trick Frodo. He would honestly believe his will is strong enough to resist temptation but there is no beating the power of the one ring. It would slowly twist those ambitions to a dark purpose.
lotr,3bqr61,The_Juggler17,25,Wed Jul 1 17:26:15 2015 UTC,"That's one thing I really didn't like about the movies. They make Boromir such a villain even though in the books he was always having the best intentions. He just winds up being one of those characters that get fucked over by the movie versions, right up there with the dumbing down of Ron in Harry Potter"
lotr,3bqr61,borland66,7,Wed Jul 1 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"Boromir is one that seems the most reasonable when you step back and think about it.  At the time he might have seemed like an uncultured jerk when he was talking to the elves and such, but he was being the most practical of any of them (unfortunately, practical things don't seem to work in Middle Earth).  Elves and wizards and hobbits - bullshit, send an army to destroy Sauron in the usual way. Just like Elendil and Isildur did, but this time Gondor will have the ring. Gandalf's plan just sounds silly from a practical point of view."
lotr,3bqr61,hiphopopotaemus,15,Wed Jul 1 21:14:06 2015 UTC,"He does curse Frodo in the book, and says the Ring must be given to the Men of Gondor, instead of being sent to Mordor with a witless halfling. Also attempts to seize the ring from Frodo.  Of course he gets back to his sense almost immediately, but it's pretty clear that his madness made him act. He isn't blameless at all."
lotr,3bqr61,Zoraxe,9,Wed Jul 1 23:35:40 2015 UTC,"Very good point, and it's easy to idolize him. Conversely if I was a Gondorian patriot I would also harbor some sort of guilt because of Sauron's rise in a region supposedly under their control. This isn't a task for some Halfling ""farmer"" from the North, this is for the hero of a dying people who let this evil spread from ""their"" land."
lotr,3bqr61,SoraXes,5,Wed Jul 1 16:12:59 2015 UTC,"That being said, the movies also make him out to be a much more self-driven individual. In the books, I always got the impression that he was primarily motivated to represent Gondor, and didn't seem to care much for the rest of middle earth. He also took many cues from Aragorn, waiting for him to act. Whereas in the movies, he was his own man, making considered decisions that he had deemed appropriate. So even though he may have been a ""better"" person in the books, he was more interesting in the movies.   Plus, his death represented a series of very moving arcs. His personal arc of redemption, it triggered Aragorn's kingship arc, and it triggered the arc of the ""world of men"". Boromir acknowledged Aragorn as his king, which meant that both Aragorn and Gondor were ready for the world of men. Having Boromir make Aragorn earn the mantle made the acceptance that much more poetic. Because a huge part of Aragorn's uncertainty was based on his belief that the world was better off without him. Boromir proved to him that that wasn't the case, and Men needed him."
lotr,3bqr61,Smaggies,3,Wed Jul 1 18:12:13 2015 UTC,"Jesus, when boromir started to cry in the books when he realised what he did... the movie kinda made it look like he's having a mental breakdown."
lotr,3bqr61,jokerkcco,2,Wed Jul 1 17:08:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was powerful. A more time efficient way of making him sympathetic."
lotr,3bqr61,stationhollow,3,Wed Jul 1 17:15:22 2015 UTC,The part in the movie with Faramir killed it for me. He helps Frodo and Sam and lets them go. And then the movies come along and he's trying to take the ring too.
lotr,3bqr61,flip69,5,Wed Jul 1 18:16:48 2015 UTC,It was awful. Faramir was meant to represent the best of Men. He was a great leader driven to save his people but in a moral and just way. The movies just made him Movie Boromir Mach II.

He moves the ring to his city and as it's ultimate warrior, he will get to use it... after his father (who's already tainted by Sauron via attempting to use the palantir).  Gondor is right on the doorstep of Mordor... the ring will go directly to the enemy."

lotr,3bv70s,nycnewsjunkie,25,Thu Jul 2 12:31:08 2015 UTC,"I've held a few debates on this subject. The way the book reads to me, I believe that the witch king was immune to most blades. It wasn't until Merry stabbed him with a blade of westerness, which was crafted specifically for battling the nazgul and had spells and runes upon it for their destruction, that the Witch King became vulnerable to Eowyn's attack. Her stroke was the final blow.   So, to answer y our question, i think both were responsible for the WK's death, and neither would have succeeded without the other."
lotr,3bv70s,DividingPrescott,6,Thu Jul 2 13:18:19 2015 UTC,"It wasn't until Merry stabbed him with a blade of westerness, [...] that the Witch King became vulnerable to Eowyn's attack   I've been waiting for years for someone to provide a logical argument for this. It isn't reflected in the text at all. Every attempt basically boils down to the idea that Tolkien spends a bit of time talking about the blow, so it must be super important, and cares less about the words he actually used."
lotr,3bv70s,Uluithiad,7,Thu Jul 2 16:03:25 2015 UTC,To me it simply makes no sense that the Witch-king would be invulnerable to attack. Especially so when we see much more powerful entities are (Morgoth and Sauron) can be harmed and killed in physical combat.
lotr,3bv70s,italia06823834,4,Thu Jul 2 16:09:16 2015 UTC,"No one says he is invulnerable. He does though live in the spirit world or to use Gandalf's words ""on the other side."" For this reason normal weapons would not hurt him. Remember when Legolas says he shot the winged shadow Gandalf tells him he is ""one you cannot slay with arrows"""
lotr,3bv70s,DividingPrescott,2,Thu Jul 2 16:37:29 2015 UTC,"You and I had this debate 2 months ago. I still stand by my opinion:   ""Doubtless the Orcs despoiled them, but feared to keep the knives, knowing them for what they are: work of Westernesse, wound about with spells for the bane of Mordor."" - Aragorn  'Look!' he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that had lain there hidden by the darkness. A foot above the lower hem there was a slash. 'This was the stroke of Frodo's sword,' he said. 'The only hurt that it did to his enemy, I fear; for it is unharmed, but all blades perish that pierce that dreadful King. More deadly to him was the name of Elbereth.'  So passed the sword of the Barrow-downs, work of Westernesse. But glad would he have been to know its fate who wrought it slowly long ago in the North-kingdom when the Dunedain were young, and chief among their foes was the dread realm of Angmar and its sorcerer king. No other blade, not though mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter, cleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will.  ""And is that the end of the Black Riders?’ asked Frodo. ‘No,’ said Gandalf. ‘Their horses must have perished, and without them they are crippled. But the Ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed.""  ""I thought they were all destroyed in the flood,’ said Merry. ‘You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,’ said Gandalf. ‘The power of their master is in them, and they stand or fall by him.""   This to me is enough evidence that the Nazgul were not mortal. They couldn't be killed through normal means (like being drowned, dashed by rocks, or impaled on steal), and that only the spells in the blade of westeness were able to undo this immunity."
lotr,3bv70s,Uluithiad,4,Thu Jul 2 16:44:03 2015 UTC,"First quote does not have any bearing on immunity. Additional potency does not mean everything else is ineffective.  Second quote does not have any bearing on immunity. It says blades perish that pierce that dreadful king. And they do. Even Merry's sword. This quote is entirely immaterial to the matter at hand. Using it is a distraction, nothing more.  Third quote does not have any bearing on immunity. It talks about specific potency. One blade being more effective than others does not mean others cannot do harm. Simply quoting this, as if it stands for itself, is completely against the spirit of discussion.  Fourth quote does not have any bearing on immunity. It talks about hardiness. The Nazgul are harder to kill than horses. Gandalf isn't immune to weapons, but he and the Balrog both survived a fall that should spell death. Supernatural hardiness, endurance against harm, is not at all the same thing as immunity.  Fifth quote is demonstrably false. If the Lord of the Nazgul was handled by Merry and Eowyn, they clearly do not stand and fall by Sauron.  Do you have anything real with logic and touching on the ideas you originally claimed?"

This quote is entirely immaterial to the matter at hand. Using it is a distraction, nothing more.   There's another point to make it very clear why that quote is not relevant:  Frodo didn't harm the Witch-king because he didn't hit the Witch-king. He only cuts his robe. If Frodo had landed a blow, his sword would have been destroyed, and the Witch-king would have met his end much sooner. Had Frodo landed a blow, the result would have been the same as when Merry landed his. And I doubt Aragorn, even with a broken sword, would have passed up the opportunity.."

lotr,3bv70s,AmishRockstar,10,Sat Jul 4 20:07:46 2015 UTC,"This has always been my interpretation as well.   Neither Eowyn nor Merry are ""men"" so either could be considered to be responsible according to the prophesy, yet Tolkien purposefully (I think) makes it a collaboration. Which is very much in keeping with the entire theme running through the story that although each of us is important and has a part to play, friendship and working together is what ultimately gives everyone the power to succeed."
lotr,3bv70s,italia06823834,3,Thu Jul 2 14:04:19 2015 UTC,Another theme of the books is cooperation between races.  It is only when all the free people ally against Sauron that they are able to defeat him.  Had any stayed on the sideline evil would have succeeded.
lotr,3bv70s,21stCenturyGaming,3,Thu Jul 2 14:44:54 2015 UTC,"Why would that make him vunerable to attack?  It is more more likely, given the text, the Barrow/blade paralyzed him giving Eowyn the opportunity to strike.  No where does it say he was suddenly vunerable to weapons.   ""No other blade, not though mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter, cleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will""   It doesn't say """"No other blade, not though mightier hands had wielded it would have dealt that foe a wound.""   The ""so bitter"" is important since it compares a wound from a normal blade, to the one of the Barrow-blade. The Barrow-blade breaks ""the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will"" (i.e. paralyzes him)."

lotr,3bv70s,italia06823834,9,Thu Jul 2 12:36:52 2015 UTC,"made him mortal for the lack of a better word   Well he is mortal, in the sense he can be killed (aside from avoiding death by age because of the Ring).*  It seems much more likely Merry's attack paralyzed him giving Eowyn the opportunity.  Had Eowyn been able to stab him in the face/throat without Merry's attack first the Witch-king would still have died.  Afterall, getting stabbed in the face kills pretty much anything.  *Even after death though Tolkien refers to him being ""reduced to impotence"". Suggesting his spirit is still bound in the world by the Ring. So he isn't mortal in the sense normal Men's spirits leave the World after death, at least not until the Ring is finally destroyed."
lotr,3bv70s,italia06823834,3,Thu Jul 2 12:45:19 2015 UTC,"Why then does Tolkien go out of his way to say of Merry's sword thrust ""No other blade, not though mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter, cleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will"".

lotr,3bv67f,EyeceEyeceBaby,4,Thu Jul 2 14:10:32 2015 UTC,Ahh I see. I thought you were referring to the text. There are a lot of invented characters in SoM that aren't based on Tolkien. Are you looking for a list like this? I'd check around that wiki if you're looking for stuff from the game. You won't find much of anything in Tolkien Gateway or other wikis because the game is only very loosely based on Tolkien's work.
lotr,3bv67f,EyeceEyeceBaby,0,Thu Jul 2 14:17:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know those guys. But I thought SoM was recognized as legitimate lore. Not just made for the game."
lotr,3bv67f,italia06823834,6,Thu Jul 2 15:14:20 2015 UTC,"Nope, not even a little bit. I hear it was marketed as being very accurate to the lore but in actuality the whole story is made up. Not only that, the notion of Celebrimbor remaining in Middle-Earth as some sort of vengeful spirit is pretty off-base in my opinion. The spirits of Elves who died in Middle-Earth were allowed to travel to Valinor and be reincarnated. I find it unlikely that a high elf such as himself would have given up that option. Not only that, but I’m not even sure it’s possible for a spirit to possess another being’s body. Certainly we know spirits can exist separate from a body, but if a body already contains a spirit I'm not sure it's possible to fuse another spirit with it."
lotr,3bv67f,italia06823834,5,Thu Jul 2 15:27:39 2015 UTC,"Shadow of Mordor is far from being canon.  If you want an answer for that game specifically you may have better luck asking their dedicated sub, or I'm sure someone with more extensive knowledge of the game here can give input."

This is an interesting part. No, I don't think she did.

You sail off in a tangent line to the Earth, on the original layout when the earth was flat.  *I say ""he"" but this goes for anyone, Sam is actually a bit of a trick since he eventually is granted passage into Valinor.

Valinor just stayed on the flat part when the world was ""bent"". So only those permitted by the Valar can sail on the Straight Path and get there.  For most usage the terms Valinor and Aman are interchangeable.  Aman is the continent while Valinor more specifically refers to the kingdom/domain."

lotr,3bmfxl,Skweres88,3,Tue Jun 30 14:36:31 2015 UTC,Tol Eressea is where most of the elves live. Valinor is home mostly to the Valar and Maiar.
lotr,3bmfxl,Tokkat1138,3,Tue Jun 30 16:31:35 2015 UTC,"Actually quite a few elves lived in Valinor proper. There were at least two Elvish cities, Tirion and Alqualondë, and we know the Vanyar at least enjoyed living out on the plains, woods, and slopes of Taniquetil in Valinor. In fact, up until the exiled Noldor and the remaining Teleri began sailing West to dwell on Tol Eressëa, the vast majority of elves would have lived in Valinor rather than the island."

lotr,3bmfxl,stationhollow,4,Wed Jul 1 23:57:02 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely sure why /u/italia06823834 claims they would go to Tol Eressëa but I can tell you why it isn't attached. Tol Eressëa was originally a part of Beleriand which the Valar detached and used as a ferry to transport the elves across the sea to Aman.
lotr,3bmfxl,Melonskal,5,Tue Jun 30 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"Many of the Noldor and Teleri who returned to Valinor never actually set foot in Valinor, rather they remained on Tol Eressëa:   And when they came into the West the Elves of Beleriand dwelt upon Tol Eressëa, the Lonely Isle, that looks both west and east; whence they might come even to Valinor. They were admitted again to the love of Manwë and the pardon of the Valar; and the Teleri forgave their ancient grief and the curse was laid to rest. - The Silmarillion   It's implied that some of them may have continued on to Valinor proper, but ""dwelt"" implies a long-term abode. Frankly I think it makes sense, particularly for the Telerin elves (the Sindarin and Silvan elves). The Teleri always were ones to linger by the sea. Even the Telerin elves of Valinor tarried on Tol Eressëa before they finally came to Valinor and founded Alqualondë."

Certain beings already exist simultaneously in both the Seen (the real physical world) and the Unseen realms and are therefore still visible when wearing the Ring. A few examples of this would be:   Sauron Gandalf, Saruman & and the other wizards Galadriel Glorfindel"
lotr,3bmopi,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Tue Jun 30 13:46:08 2015 UTC,"This begs an interesting question in the case of Tom Bombadil.  He, too, remains visible upon putting on the ring.  This curious character from early in the fellowship has been the subject of endless speculation since the publication of Tolkien's lengendarium.  Tolkien himself's ambiguous explanation and reluctance to define the character more explicitly has only served to fuel the debate.  Definitely, in realms both Seen and Unseen Tom resides.  But what is he? Maia, Ainur, or Eru?  :-)"
lotr,3bmopi,thinkren,3,Wed Jul 1 04:12:46 2015 UTC,"Well Tolkien did say definitively he is not Eru or, more accurately, that there is no embodiment of Eru in Arda. He is only directly accessible to the Valar. Also all Maiar are also Ainur (but not vice versa). Tom would have had to be in order to truly be ""Eldest"" and to have been around when Melkor entered Arda, he would have needed to be in Arda before there were any Maiar. Either Tom is lying, we are misinterpreting his statement, or he isn't a Maia. I personally think it's unlikely he is a Maia because of this. Tolkien called him the ""spirit of the (vanishing) Oxford and Berkshire countryside."" I think this is as close as we'll ever really get. The fact that Tom resides in part in the Unseen realm doesn't necessitate his being an Ainu or Eru, it simply adds one more drop of knowledge to the precious little that we actually know about him."

Sauron, being a Maia (Angelic) spirit, already exists in the realm simultaneously with the physical. He is unaffected.  Invisibility is mainly a side effect of the Ring.  The Nazgul's bodies are invisible for the same reason. Though from extended use they have become permanently invisible, even though Sauron (during the War of the Ring) is in possession of the Nine Rings."

Balrog ... whips   Balrogs are almost always described as having whips.  In many of places they are also described as whips of flame or flaming whips. LotR has no such description, but it wasn't a big leap for the filmakers to make.   The Witch-king doesn't have a flail.   He at least has a ""mace"".   With  a  cry  of  hatred  that  stung  the  very  ears  like  venom  he  let  fall  his  mace.

One specific difference on which I focused during my last viewing of TTT: EE was how differently Faramir is depicted in the films.  I found Tolkien's original version of this character to be much more endearing and relatable, whereas the movie portrayal (although David Wenham himself is awesome) leaves me sort of indifferent.  Based on the film depiction of Faramir, it's a wonder Eowyn ever eventually looks his way.  The magic of Healing, I suppose...

But seriously, this passage from RotK is talking about the outskirts of Mordor, the same places Sam and Frodo had seen when traveling south:   Dreadful as the Dead Marshes had been, and the arid moors of the Noman-lands, more loathsome far was the country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes.  Even to the Mere of Dead Faces some haggard phantom of green spring would come; but here neither spring nor summer would ever come again.  Here nothing lived, not even the leprous growths that feed on rottenness.  The gasping pools were choked with ash and crawling muds, sickly white and grey, as if the mountains had vomited the filth of their entrails upon the lands about.  High mounds of crushed and powdered rock, great cones of earth fire-blasted and poison-stained, stood like an obscene graveyard in endless rows, slowly revealed in the reluctant light.    They had come to the desolation that lay before Mordor: the lasting monument to the dark labour of its slaves that should endure when all their purposes were made void; a land defiled, diseased beyond all healing - unless the Great Sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion. 'I feel sick,' said Sam.  Frodo did not speak."

lotr,3bgqtf,Synderesis_,16,Mon Jun 29 02:08:01 2015 UTC,"The term Istari means ""those who know"" in Quenya, and is used interchangeably with the term Wizard to refer specifically to the five Maiar sent to Middle-earth to oppose Sauron (who is also a Maia). However, the Istari are not necessarily as powerful or skilled as Sauron, just like different humans are not necessarily equal to each other in power or skill."
lotr,3bgqtf,PersonUsingAComputer,3,Mon Jun 29 02:36:57 2015 UTC,Oh I get it now! That's a good analogy.
lotr,3bgqtf,ReinierPersoon,12,Mon Jun 29 02:44:29 2015 UTC,"There are the Ainur, who are spirits that have been around before the creation of Arda (Eart) and helped create it. Some of those spirits chose to live on Arda permanently, they are called he Ainur. The most powerful of them were the Valar, and the others the Maiar. Most Maiar are associated with one of the Valar and their domain.  The Maiar could choose their shape. The Balrogs were Maiar associated with fire, and they chose to serve the Vala Morgoth in the form of Balrogs, and they were used mostly for war. Gandalf was also associated with fire, but when he was given the task as one of the Istari they were ordered to take the shape of old men and not use their power to force the peoples of Middle-earth to fight Sauron, but to guide them. That is probably why you don't see Gandalf use a lot of ""magic"" but he mostly nudges people in the right direction and tries to give them hope. The confrontation between Gandalf and ""the"" Balrog was a meeting between two fire spirits who chose a different path.  Sauron is one of the most important lieutenants of Morgoth, so I assume he would be one of the most powerful Maiar in his service.  The first chapters of the Silmarillion have the origin of pretty much everything in Middle-earth that there is an origin for."
lotr,3bgqtf,Cyclenophus,4,Mon Jun 29 03:08:38 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you consider ""powerful"". Usually, in this fiction, only the evil Higher Beings directly use their spiritual potency to harm or control others. Sauron's power, such as it was, came entirely from his malice and how will to dominate the land, and he poured that will into his dark schemes and crafts.   The Istari were sent to Middle Earth on an important mission to guide the young races of Men and their dwindling allies in an effort to confront and resist the spread of evil. Saruman failed, and failed hard. Gandalf unambiguously succeeded. He remained humble and helpful, and helped guide Men through this dark chapter in their history. In a way, he was more ""powerful"" than Sauron because he helped prevent Sauron from covering the land in tyranny.   The fates of Radagast and the two ambiguously identified Blue Wizards is left up in the air. Tolkien himself hesitated to say they were bad people or necessarily completely failed on the level of Saruman. Radagast failed to remain focused on the important work of guiding Men and focused on druidic woodland crafts related to trees and animals instead. The Blue Wizards disappeared into the East on an unknown mission and don't enter history again, although Tolkien hints their work there may have weakened Sauron's influence among the Easterlings, so their spirits along with Radagast's might still be allowed back into the Uttermost West eventually, unlike Saruman's."

I get that that is how you win, but I would set up these huge armies expecting a big battle, and they would run straight through my army, not even attacking me. I would spend the whole game chasing them toward my base. I wanted to be met on the battlefield. Fix that mechanic, make the walls more worthwhile to build, and I'm sold.

Line up all your companies and then bombard them with trebuchets by targeting the ground underneath them. Continue until you've killed all your troops except for the banner carriers. Train more units and repeat 1-3 until you reach the unit cap. All banner carriers. Build a well, which heals units brought near it.

lotr,3be5lr,fearsomeduckins,7,Sun Jun 28 21:25:10 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved the first game, one of my top 5 RTS games of all time. There was nothing more glorious than getting a huge army of Rohirrim and charging over an endless sea or orcs (although running into pikemen was really sad). The second was good, but started to stray a bit too far from the lore for my liking. Also it seemed pretty unfinished, like it had a lot of wasted potential (particularly stuff like the create a hero, which was a really cool idea but implemented in a way that was extremely underwhelming). There are some fantastic mods out there though, that really enhance the playing experience. For a third game... I'm not sure what I'd want, exactly. More lore friendly, for sure, but whether to use the first game style or the second, I'm not sure. BFME 1 base building was pretty original and therefore interesting, but generally speaking I'm a big fan of free base building and I want to have that freedom in Middle Earth. Maybe a compromise of some kind, like there are build plots for citadels, and then you can build freely in an area around them or something. I'm not sure.   It could also be done more like Dawn of War 2 with more emphasis on heroes and stuff like that. That would fit Middle Earth pretty well, although I'd want more scale than DOW2 has. Basically I'd want more hero units, possibly more factions, more unit variety, and expanded base building. Probably options for larger maps, and an expanded campaign (BFME 1 campaign was really good, though.) That with an updated engine with some better graphics and I'd buy it instantly."

However if they added characters from that LoTR MOBA I would be very, very upset. Bad invented characters for a bad game."

lotr,3bdxh4,Nan0min,2,Sun Jun 28 08:33:29 2015 UTC,For me this is the chapter where the book started becoming more of a story rather than a long line of text.  I was able to visualize everything at this point and I hope that the book continues to be as informative as it is with this new personality it has... Which has to do with having actual characters now.
lotr,3bdxh4,Matthew_McHiniNini,5,Mon Jul 6 13:59:45 2015 UTC,"Once I had read the Silmarillion once, I began to vividly imagine all the beings as characters in this sort of vast narrative (though Ilúvatar evades me in terms of imagining any corporeal rendering).  Still, many of the names mentioned in this chapter get me excited to continue with a reread.  Círdan is a favorite of mine-- he serves some important purposes in the unfolding of Middle Earth's story.  Plus, being the shipwright and ferryman, he reminds me somewhat of the Greek Charon... Just a sparklier, elfier version."

lotr,3bg02l,2mobile2,3,Mon Jun 29 02:51:45 2015 UTC,I guess that's just down to your opinion. Some die hard fans of the books (Even though I've read both the Hobbit books and seen the films) find equal enjoyment out of both and both have their pros and cons. Nothing bad in the films in my opinion. I would like you to give a reason instead of just a straight up no please. :)
lotr,3bg02l,SsgtGimli,2,Mon Jun 29 10:05:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not as if the movies can marr the experience of the book.  They're good films that get far too much hate around here."
lotr,3bg02l,Elliot850,2,Mon Jun 29 12:54:40 2015 UTC,"To me the movies are awful bloated messes that suck as movies whatever the source material. Too little Hobbit, waaaaay too much LOTR/Sauron tie-in attempts that ends up going NOWHERE. Saruman & Elrond show up out of nowhere to go all Bruce Lee on wraiths...which don't have physical bodies yet? The fuck?  Character motivations that come and go at a whim, example: 1st movie, they apparently miss finding the key hole and what does Thorin do after all those years struggling to even find the key? Gives up & walks away. That scene right there just fucking ruined the whole film because he was just like ""oh well, fuck it. I'm out!"" That stupid damn Radagst with birdshit on his head...retarded. The utterly nonsensical fight scene between the dwarves & Smaug where Smaug could have easily killed them all several times but didn't because Jackson didn't know how to end that exhausting piece of junk. Only to have Smaug die at the beginning of the next movie? Fucking STUPID. And goddamn Alfrid/Grima...What. The. Hell????? These movies were a giant plastic looking CGI goatscrew that had no real idea what they wanted to be. None. It was a fucking bloated blob of shit that made Matrix Revolutions look like fucking Citizen Kane.   The Hobbit movies SUCK. As movies. And good god they have so little in common with the source material (other the locations and settings) that I wonder why Jackson even bothered calling it The Hobbit. He should have just called it LOTR Episodes 1, 2 & 3. Fucking may as well thrown in Jar Jar as the freaking Witch King of Angmar."
lotr,3bg02l,2mobile2,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:10:17 2015 UTC,"Then fair enough I am willing to accept that. However I do feel that I have to express that even though Alfrid was given what felt like a bucket load of screentime I actually went through the liberty myself to  time the amount of screentime he actually got, which was 5:58 minutes. When you really look at tit it's nothing really and I think that he just appeared so frequently but at little amounts everytime.  As for Smaug not killing the dwarves when he could have easily done so was intentional in both the books and the films. Smaug was still seeing himself and how he believed other people to see himself as the powerful dragon he still was 60 years ago. That's clearly not the case because he has become ill-minded with the lack of things he has needed to do and has almost died in such a way because of it. The reason why he didn't feel the need to strike them there and then was simply because he felt that he could instill them with fear and strike them whenever it pleases him. He also went off the whole suffering road where he would almost allow Bilbo to take the Arkenstone and give it to Thorin to watch it corrupt him.  With Saruman and Elrond that was a good fight scene and me and my friend were hyped to see them add this addition to the film as this was originally an idea that Tolkien had thought of after the creation of The Hobbit and it was named the Battle of the White Council, I feel like this was a worth addition in my eyes.  CGI to me was good, not great but not bad enough for me to turn my head in shame or disgust. The characters originally were supposed to be makeover-ed but due to some of the physical size and appearance that a Gundabad orc would possess it felt much more the correct way to give it the CGI role. In fact the scene where Gandalf is captured and being tossed around by and orc in Dol Goldur the orc was the makeovered version of what Bolg was supposed to originally look like.   You can see this here: http://www.thelandofshadow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BolgvsBolg.jpg  When Galadriel saves Gandalf from the http://gyazo.com/d80763412184cb31f0abfc5659ba4cba  There is also an interview of I believe Simon Tolkien when the radio host gave him the question did you enjoy the films (Which is of course his opinion) and he replied with, ""Yes I enjoyed the first film, however he stuck too close to the original books"" If that's not your seeing of Peter Jackson sticking to the source material then I don't know what is.  I do believe that this has gotten way more out of hand and I'm glad you have shared your opinion. Unfortunately you're not the first and you certainly won't be the last person to let everybody know how ""bad"" The Hobbit films are because of this, this and this.  Thanks for the reply though :)"
lotr,3bg02l,SsgtGimli,3,Tue Jun 30 09:46:53 2015 UTC,"I actually liked The Hobbit films for the most part. I see people all the time accusing it of this and that (including in this thread) but no one ever seems to address the fact that The Hobbit is a childrens book. I felt that the overall tone of the films was spot on. If you remember that 'There and back again' was Bilbos rendition of the events of the journey, you realise that some things will be exaggerated, omitted or downright fantastical, which is exactly what happens with the film. Fuck Alfrid, though."

lotr,3bed2l,ToffeeKing,4,Sun Jun 28 15:51:39 2015 UTC,"Ancient societies like the ones in Middle Earth put a great deal of stake in lineage and who your fore bearers were.

So, when you say, ""I am Gimli, son of Gloin."" you are fundamentally implying that you have inherited some of his greatness, and treasure his memory."
lotr,3bed2l,Mishmoo,7,Sun Jun 28 13:09:41 2015 UTC,"Some of the sources of inspiration for Tolkien was the Norse mythology, the Eddas and sagas, and Beowulf. One of the important characters is Hrothgar son of Halfdan, of the Scyldings. The -ing means descendent of, so their family is descended from a king Scyld. It was how people in those days named each other. In the stories and likely in reality they also used nicknames a lot.  The Rohirrim do this a lot, recall ""Gandalf Greyhame, Ill-news I name you!"" and Gandalf has a lot of names and nicknames. So does Aragorn (son of Arathorn of course, Isildur's Heir!).  The people of Rohan are mostly based on Anglo-Saxons, who used similar names like Harald Godwineson.  A lot of the style of the language in Tolkien's books is similar in style to those old sources. Some of the songs and poems too."
lotr,3bed2l,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:21:53 2015 UTC,A lot of the phrases are actually pseudo-archaic phrases borrowed from the works of William Morris.

Interesting is that Ringwraiths are also in this world but they use their cloaks to make themselves visible to people not in the spirit world.  It may be important to note that Bilbo doesn't really understand the Ring, and doesn't know how to control it. The Ring also has a will of its own, Gandalf says that the Ring ""wants to be found"". It betrayed Gollum deliberately."

lotr,3bah15,Axegrinder100,4,Sat Jun 27 09:28:33 2015 UTC,To the east there lies a great. mountain range called Orocarni. There four of the seven dwarfs houses dwell and mine its bountiful metals and gems. The reason the men of Rhun were so well armed was probably because they traded with the dwarves in the Orocarni.
lotr,3bah15,Melonskal,3,Sat Jun 27 15:59:19 2015 UTC,The land to the east is likely part of Middle-earth. We know there are Men living in the east and we know the Blue Wizards went there.  Valinor to the west is not part of Middle-earth.

Their names were Alatar and Pallando, but all we know of them is that they went into the east.  They were Maiar (powerful spirits) who took the shape of old men. Sauron and the Balrog were also Maiar, but not Wizards (that term applies only to the five I mentioned).  The Silmarillion has an explanation of what the world looks like and were all the creatures came from, but it says very little of the east, except that we know both Elves and Men first awoke there and some came to the west. It's assumed that the east is mostly under the influence of Sauron."

lotr,3b9co4,AurumLupus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:32:58 2015 UTC,"It can only be surmised they rank among the ""lesser rings"" sometimes mentioned in ring lore. Gandalf once told Bilbo ""there are many magic rings in this world"". The word ""many"" is ambiguous. It could refer exclusively to the magic rings crafted by the Elves and Sauron, or it could also refer to the myriad ""lesser rings"" made by other beings, which contain a much smaller quantity of the essential spiritual essence of the land.  As Saruman was essentially a Sauron wannabe who intended to replace the crippled Spirit and rule Middle Earth, it can be surmised that his own ring-craft was based on that of Sauron, but much weaker in power. His rings would probably be able to control the willpower and passions of weak men like Grima, or vengeful men like the hill people who rose up against Rohan, or indeed evil goblin-men and Orcs, but not mighty Men or Elves."

lotr,3b9ae3,Sprolzee,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:48:33 2015 UTC,"Unfinished Tales isn't one flowing narrative, it's more like a collection of different stories and notes. Some of it requires having read Silmarillion, but other parts can be read without it. I'd recommend reading Silmarillion though."

All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.  On a side note, I also did in my acl and meniscus and mcl for good measure. My recommendation for the first couple weeks is be icing like crazy. And for gods sakes take your PT very seriously. I don't know if your doctor recommended it but doing therapy to get strength and range of motion in your bad knee before you go under the knife really helps a lot. Post surgery I found it helps to have a small fridge nearby with multiple ice packs and snacks in it. If you get lucky like me I was off crutches in two weeks. I actually look back fondly at the first few weeks and remember how everyday I felt less pain and more stability and strength and it was noticeable.   Good luck with your surgery, and I'm not joking, treat your PT like it's your job."
lotr,3b7u55,Shralpental,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:40:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! They have me on PT twice a week and I'm definitely going to stick to PT like crazy afterwards. I'm relatively young (24) and I don't want any major long term effects of this surgery. My physical therapist made me buy a $50 dollar ice pack too for pre-op but mainly for post opp recovery.

lotr,3ba5fz,Unlifer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:18:44 2015 UTC,I was confused when I read Christopher. Immediately thought it referred to Christopher Lee's heirs.
lotr,3ba5fz,CptBoomshard,3,Sun Jun 28 07:48:35 2015 UTC,I still hold out hope that the Silmarillion gets done. Preferrably as a HBO/Showtime/Starz/Netflix etc series instead of movies.
lotr,3ba5fz,ReinierPersoon,4,Sat Jun 27 12:15:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is happening any time soon, Christopher Tolkien seems unlikely to sell the rights. I'm also not sure there is enough material, there are a lot of stories but they'd have to make up a lot dialogue to fill multiple episodes."
lotr,3ba5fz,CptBoomshard,2,Sat Jun 27 12:50:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like there's far and away PLENTY of material. Yes, they'd have to take creative license with some dialogue, but as far as enough material to make it happen? Shit, they could get AT LEAST 6-7 seasons out of it. But you're right about Christopher Tolkien. Will probably have to wait for him to pass away for it to happen. BUT I think there's still hope that it could be done sooner than that! We all know he hated Peter Jackson's movies, but for an idea like this it would be completely different. Using the TV series format you could do a lot more justice to the source material with a lot less shoe-horning and hack-jobbing. But yeah, as far as having enough material, I think that's even less than not a problem. I mean think about it, there's enough crazy epic awesomeness that they wouldn't even have to get into the First Age of Middle Earth til like season 3-4. The first 2-3 seasons (6-10 eps each) could cover the Elder Days (or is it Eldar Days?) The First Age in Beleriand is so packed full of epic drama that you could easily get 3-4 seasons (minimum) out of that. Then another 2-3 seasons out of the Second Age with all the intrigue in Numenor. Literally the most we'd have to worry about is filling in dialogue. Hire good writers with respect for the source material and that's also not a problem. Let Chris Tolkien consult on the project to some degree, and ensure that it will be very little like Peter Jackson's films. I think it could happen!"
lotr,3ba5fz,ReinierPersoon,5,Sat Jun 27 13:12:35 2015 UTC,"It's Elder Days, but it the Eldar steal the show.  The problem is that many characters have so little dialogue. We have, what, 10 lines from Finrod Felagund over the course of a few hundred years? I don't think that's salvagable for making hours and hours of television, you'd have to practically make up most of it.  And I very much suspect C Tolkien not wanting anything to do with it. I read he doesn't even watch tv or film.  There is also the problem that there are a lot of characters to go through, on the other hand a show such as GoT shows that people can accept that."
lotr,3ba5fz,Elliot850,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:37:24 2015 UTC,"GOT could definitely be a big influence in getting it made. It takes a ridiculously dense series of novels with FAR too many characters and manages to make it a really watchable and fairly easy to follow series.   Plus it is probably inspiring a lot more people to start reading fantasy novels, and everyone always starts off with the LOTR series."
lotr,3ba5fz,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:17:55 2015 UTC,"I saw a bunch of the first season, but I couldn't really get into it. I really liked seeing Boromir in there though. Sean Bean was one of the best performances in LotR in my opinion, even though it was somewhat different from the book."
lotr,3ba5fz,CptBoomshard,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:49:43 2015 UTC,"I mean I definitely see your point about the lack of dialogue in the books to go directly off of. BUT I feel like Tolkien gave us plenty of information into people's personalities/ideals etc that good writers could EASILY come up with original dialogue that stays true to the spirit of the characters. Just needs to be GOOD writers. So ya know, get writers from shows like GoT/Daredevil/Breaking Bad/Mad Men and that shouldn't be a problem at all! I think you can agree, that if done correctly, with all due respect paid to the source material, an 8 season run bringing the Silmarillion to life would be AMAZING!"
lotr,3ba5fz,sakor88,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:23:45 2015 UTC,Tolkien had given quite much dialogue in the Lord of the Rings. And yet the story and the characters were quite different.

lotr,3ba5fz,sakor88,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:45:54 2015 UTC,"As far as I've understood, the films imply strongly that the Ring can't be used against Sauron. That is quite a huge leap from the actual story."
lotr,3ba5fz,Elliot850,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:24:01 2015 UTC,It's a change that didn't fundamentally alter the story though. It just skewed some intentions.
lotr,3ba5fz,sakor88,3,Mon Jun 29 00:19:10 2015 UTC,"How would it be loyal to the source material? They would have to invent enormous amounts of dialogue and other material, and it would be done Hollywood style. If you want to enjoy the Silmarillion, you can read it."
lotr,3ba5fz,CptBoomshard,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:36:01 2015 UTC,Have read it. Loved it. what other material besides dialoue would they have to create?
lotr,3ba5fz,sakor88,2,Sun Jun 28 11:35:43 2015 UTC,"The Silmarillion is way less descriptive in most of its parts than the Lord of the Rings, not just in dialogue. The only part I actually think might be adapted somewhat faithfully into a miniseries is the Children of Húrin. I might actually like if some retro adaptation would be made of it in a black-and white silent film which leaves more freedom to the viewer, at least in my opinion, than modern films. In my opinion the Jacksonverse-adaptation has very much chained the imagination , that is the reason I generally oppose all adaptations. Not to mention how it has diluted the lore and spread misconceptions regarding the story."
lotr,3ba5fz,CptBoomshard,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:21:15 2015 UTC,Well let me just say I would want a Silmarillion adapted HBO-esque series to be very UN-Jackson-like.
lotr,3ba5fz,sakor88,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:51:42 2015 UTC,I have hard time to imagine an adaptation that would be HBO-esque and faithful to the source material. It does not mean that I dislike GoT or Rome.

lotr,3b4r3y,flameofuldun,12,Thu Jun 25 23:27:07 2015 UTC,"The Three were untouched by Sauron in their making and were made for preservation so they didn't negatively affect their bearers.   The biggest problem with the Three was their connection with the One and the Elves' reliance on them.   They wanted to emulate Valinor and needed the Rings to do that, but if the One was ever destroyed they would lose their power. However, if the One wasn't destroyed Sauron wouldn't be defeated. So no matter what choice they made during the War of the Ring they were going to lose something. Destroy the Ring but lose what they've created with them or continue using them but constantly live under the threat of Sauron."
lotr,3b4r3y,doymand,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:42:35 2015 UTC,"Right, I know the Elves' rings were made by Celebrimbor (iirc) unlike the other rings but I thought Sauron still had some power over them? I mean, I know he was into smithing when he was in disguise, walking amongst the elves at that time.  But I could just be misremembering stuff from that time period."
lotr,3b4r3y,doymand,9,Thu Jun 25 23:48:04 2015 UTC,He had power over them as long as he had the One because they were made using his techniques but the Three were forged solely by Celebrimbor and so were not corrupted like the others. And when the One was forged the Elves took off their Rings and hid them until his defeat.
lotr,3b4r3y,italia06823834,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:51:26 2015 UTC,"Ah. So when he did have the One ring, what kind of power did he have over them? Was it only in battle or just universal power?"
lotr,3b4r3y,aaranprasher,6,Thu Jun 25 23:53:38 2015 UTC,"While wearing the One Sauron would have had complete control over the Ring's bearers.  Luckily for the Elves, they immediately took their Rings off when they felt Sauron."
lotr,3b4r3y,italia06823834,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:28:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting. So full control by sauron (when he has the one ring) over the elves depends on if the three wear the rings or not? If they simply look it off for a minute before sauron has the one, would they avoid all of that Full control? Even if they were wearing their rings for an age? Is it really a simple on off trick that could avoid them becoming wraiths essentially?"
lotr,3b4r3y,WalkingTarget,3,Fri Jun 26 00:45:29 2015 UTC,"The Three were not inherently corrupt like the other Rings.  They were made.by Celebrimbor alone and Sauron had no direct part in their making. So their bearers would not become wraiths.  Sauron can only control those Rings when he has the One (since they were still made with knowledge he gave the Elves they are still subject to the One).  But yes, if those Rings aren't being worn there is no one for him to have control of."
lotr,3b4r3y,stationhollow,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:53:17 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's a testament to the wisdom/strength of the elves because I doubt the other races would've done that had the situation been the same for their ring bearers.  Remember the part of LOTR movies when Galadriel ""passes the test"" of resisting the One ring? (I'm going off the assumption that's at least fairly close to canon.) I know the One calls to the ring bearer. Did the elvish rings give the elves an advantage in combat? If so, were the elvish lords ever tempted to put the rings on to fight during the war in which Isildur recovered the One (can't remember the war's name off the top of my head, sorry)? (I realize the paradoxical question in that with Sauron's control compared to whatever advantages the rings imparted. I guess it all really rests on in what way the rings helped the elves.)  I know this is all sort of ""what if"" but I'm curious."
lotr,3b4r3y,moocharific,7,Fri Jun 26 00:55:10 2015 UTC,"Remember the part of LOTR movies when Galadriel ""passes the test"" of resisting the One ring? (I'm going off the assumption that's at least fairly close to canon.)    Galadriel was a special case. She was one of the Noldor who left Valinor following Feanor (her cousin). Her motives were, however, in part a desire to have her own realm to rule. When the First Age ended and the Noldori exiles were welcomed back, she stayed in Middle-earth - there was a question of, being one of the original rebels, if she would be allowed back. Her ""test"" at the time of the War of the Ring was if she could, given her ambition, resist the temptation to take the Ring. Even more, Frodo offered it to her freely. She passes this test and finally accepts that she will return to Valinor.   I know the One calls to the ring bearer. Did the elvish rings give the elves an advantage in combat?   Well, the Rings grant Power in proportion to the native strength of their bearers, but they were not designed with ""combat"" in mind. The whole deal that Sauron used to trick the Elves into making/wearing them in the first place was that they could be used to hold back the decay of time - they were (ostensibly) tools of preservation, not war. That being said, they might be able to be used to amp up a commander's presence on a field of battle (and Sauron's Ruling Ring was intentionally designed with the purpose of dominating the wills of his slaves/subjects).    If so, were the elvish lords ever tempted to put the rings on to fight during the war in which Isildur recovered the One (can't remember the war's name off the top of my head, sorry)?   The War of the Last Alliance is what you were trying to remember. The Elves were not foolish enough to think that there was any good that could come of putting on a Ring while Sauron had the One.   (I realize the paradoxical question in that with Sauron's control compared to whatever advantages the rings imparted. I guess it all really rests on in what way the rings helped the elves.)   The main thing that the Elves used their Rings for in the Third Age was in the maintenance of their realms. This accounts for the timeless quality that the Hobbits mention in both Rivendell and Lothlorien. They were also instrumental to the defense of these places as they were both relatively close to hostile locations (orcs in the Misty Mountains and Trolls in the countryside for Rivendell, Moria and Dol Guldur for Lorien). Lindon (where the Grey Havens are) would also have had this at least for a time, but Gandalf has had the third Ring to aid in his mission of ""kindling the hearts"" of the people of Middle-earth for the last couple thousand years."

lotr,3b4r3y,moocharific,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:39:26 2015 UTC,I know it's been some days since you last commented here. The elven rings aren't really for combat. It's implied that Elrond uses his to heal Frodo of the wound from the morgul blade. Gandalf though 'uses' his during g the battle for Minis Tirith to inspire and put courage in the hearts of men.
lotr,3b4r3y,doymand,6,Thu Jul 2 00:47:56 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure that the elves realised the rings were bad once the Men were corrupted and the ones they have now were forged by Elves, so they don't have negative effects."

lotr,3b3szz,italia06823834,5,Thu Jun 25 19:25:59 2015 UTC,"While I highly recommend you read the books, http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Main_Page is a pretty okay resource for quick background knowledge. http://lotrproject.com/ is also a great resource with interactive maps and lineage charts.  Now, I might be able to help you with some of your questions: What Peter Jackson's films do not show, or even reference, is the fact that the Great Eagles are a sentient race of beings that can talk. They are not Gandalf's servants, and he doesn't have the power to summon them. Both instances of rescue/aid that they provided in The Hobbit were out of luck and circumstance. They absolutely dread goblins and wargs, so Gwahir (their king) decided to intervene and rescue the dwarves from the flaming trees. They did not fly Thorin's Company to Erebor because 1.) They did not owe them anything (rescue, food and shelter was enough!)  and 2.) It was a long perilous flight. The woodsman of the Wilderland had tried to fell them with arrows in the past. They only aided the coalition of Men, Elves and Dwarves at the Battle of Five Armies because they saw goblin troop movement, and decided to strike in attempt to rid the lands of them (and, if I'm remembering correctly, they could smell the bloodshed)."
lotr,3b3szz,aaranprasher,2,Thu Jun 25 19:28:19 2015 UTC,"Wow that's interesting. Which book would I have to read to learn more about the Eagles lore, characteristics etc...  And also, the Eagles hate for orcs, can that be compared to beaorns hate?"
lotr,3b3szz,ebneter,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:50:09 2015 UTC,"The Silmarillion is a great place to start for the roots/creation story the Eagles, but you can learn a lot about them in The Hobbit between the chapters ""Out of the Frying Pan"" and ""Queer Lodgings""."
lotr,3b3szz,ReinierPersoon,2,Fri Jun 26 18:40:06 2015 UTC,"Gwahir (their king)   For the record, Gwaihir is almost certainly not the same bird as the Lord of the Eagles in The Hobbit."

lotr,3b3szz,happyclownbot,3,Sat Jun 27 03:32:06 2015 UTC,"The Silmarillion. It is basically the history book of the people of Middle-earth. It has the creation story and the origin of many of the characters in LotR. It is a bit darker than the Hobbit and LotR periods.  As for the rules of the universe, there is a certain amount of ambiguity in Tolkien's works. Quite a few things are stated like this: ""It is said that..."" or ""The Wise believe..."". In the books Gandalf killed the Great Goblin, but there isn't much ""magic"" used by Gandalf. He is a not a human but a Maia, who was sent to Middle-earth to guide the peoples of Middle-earth in their struggle against Sauron. Maiar are immortal beings that had a part in the creation of Arda (their ""planet"") and chose to live there. Gandalf and the other Wizards took the form of old men and were restricted from using their power to bully the Free Peoples into fighting against Sauron.  Gandalf was the same type of being as Sauron and the Balrog, but his ""power"" was the ability to inspire the people of Middle-earth. He convinced Frodo and Sam to destroy the Ring, he helped re-install the King under the Mountain and get rid of Smaug (just in time, before the War of the Ring) and he made sure Rohan would come to the aid of Gondor. He was powerful, but he chose to appear in the form of an old man and nudge people in the right direction.  The Eagles were created to watch over the animals, as the Ents were created to watch over the plants. They were created in response to the upcoming creation of Elves and Men, to protect the natural world from them. They have aided people at crucial times, but they are not exactly allies and they don't answer to Gandalf or other people.  I prefer the books over the movies, and the LotR movies were much closer to the books than the Hobbit movies. They stretched out a 225 page book (written for children) over 10 hours. They had to make up a lot of action scenes themselves."
lotr,3b3szz,ReinierPersoon,3,Thu Jun 25 20:31:10 2015 UTC,"I was actually amazed how bad of a movie the Hobbit was. It felt like they tried to merge LOTR with a kids movie (the dwarves tossing the plates, etc)."
lotr,3b3szz,Billy_Fish,3,Thu Jun 25 20:40:00 2015 UTC,"It was weird. The Dwarves tossing plates may not be out of place in the book though, it is written for children after all. The Elves all sing ""tralalala"" in one chapter. I imagine it would be how Bilbo would have told his story to young Hobbits. Tolkien wrote this story for his young children. Still has some dark parts, like the death of Thorin. The quote on top of this sub are Thorin's parting words to Bilbo just before he dies.  Then in the films they used the much darker stuff on Dwarves from the appendices of LotR, and you end up with a creepy Orc beheading Thrór and holding up his head. They made a real mess of the Hobbit movies.  They completely missed the tone of the book except for the first bit when the Dwarves were introduced to Bilbo. Dáin was also off, in the films he is a clown, while in the books he is a very serious person and a wise king. He was still around when the War of the Ring happened, he died as an old Dwarf while defending Erebor."

lotr,3b3szz,Billy_Fish,2,Thu Jun 25 20:54:22 2015 UTC,That is eerily similar to the cover of my very old Hobbit book. A bunch of childish Dwarves with Santa outfits. Tolkien would have hated it.

Then Gothmog hewed him with his black axe, and a white flame sprang up from the helm of Fingon as it was cloven. Thus fell the High King of the Noldor; and they beat him into the dust with their maces; and his banner, blue and silver, they trod into the mire of his blood.

lotr,3avmw3,Edledhron,4,Fri Jun 26 17:29:49 2015 UTC,"Gandalf absolutely was a maia. As were the other wizards.   Emissaries they were from the Lords of the West, the Valar, who still took counsel for the governance of Middle-earth, and when the shadow of Sauron began first to stir again took this means of resisting him. For with the consent of Eru they sent members of their own high order, but clad in bodies as of Men, real and not feign...   With 'high order' referring to the Ainur, the only possibilities are Valar and Maiar, and they certainly were not Valar.   We must assume that they [the Istari] were all Maiar, that is persons of the 'angelic' order, though not necessarily of the same rank. The Maiar were 'spirits', but capable of self-incarnation, and could take 'humane' (especially Elvish) forms.    If you wanted something even more explicit...   Wisest of the Maiar was Olórin. He too dwelt in Lórien, but his ways took him often to the house of Nienna, and of her he learned pity and patience . . . But of Olórin that tale does not speak; for though he loved the Elves, he walked among them unseen, or in form as one of them, and they did not know whence came the fair visions or the promptings of wisdom that he put into their hearts. In later days he was the friend of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and took pity on their sorrows, and those who listened to him awoke from despiar and put away the imaginations of darkness.   And if it wasn't clear:   'The Grey Pilgrim?' said Frodo. 'Had he a name?'  'Mithrandir we called him in elf-fashion,' said Faramir, 'and he was content. Many are my names in many countires, he said.

lotr,3axtfl,CpTait,51,Wed Jun 24 10:48:33 2015 UTC,"Not very, and Tolkien would have been quite displeased with a great amount of it (he could be quite critical of those who attempted to portray his work but missed the mark). You're quite right for noticing that Jackson's vision (largely based on Allen Lee's and John Howe's art, which themselves often do not align with Tolkien's descriptions) has sort of taken over.  The landscape absolutely should be European. More than that - Middle-earth is Europe, according to Tolkien about 6,000 years back into a mythological past for the time of The Lord of the Rings.  I would say there are two big differences that pop out to me regarding the landscapes.  First, Middle-earth is much, much bigger than the films would have you believe. For example, here's a scene from Rohan, with Mordor looking like maybe a day or two away on foot - I believe at this time they are to the northwest of Edoras. Here's a map of Middle-earth with Europe overlayed to scale. Taking a look at that, you can see how ridiculous the scene is if going by the books - it's like being able to see deep into Bosnia from the north west of Italy!  The second thing is that Jackson's Middle-earth is not nearly green enough. Rohan is a fantastic example of this. Here is how Tolkien describes the scenery:   At the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of Rohan. It swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the Emyn Muil. The falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and water-plants, and they could hear it tinkling away in green tunnels, down long gentle slopes towards the fens of Entwash Vale far away. Here the air was softer and warmer, and faintly scented, as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf. Legolas took a deep breath, like one that drinks a great draught after long thirst in barren places.  'Ah! the green smell!' he said. 'It is better than much sleep. Let us run!'   That obviously doesn't match up very well with how Jackson depicted Rohan, which is more brown than green.  Another example would be Minas Tirith. In the books, the city is surrounded by greenery and farmlands, which themselves are surrounded by an outer wall called the Rammas Echor. Funnily enough, the wall is removed in the film, but it's still referenced in this speech And rather than farmlands, we see yet even more brown grasslands.  The architecture and other cultural designs are hit and miss. The Shire is good. Rohan's architecture I think is pretty good. The films at times get a little too fantastical and a little too renaissance-y, especially with the elves and Gondor - particularly with its costume design and arms and armor. In general, Middle-earth should evoke the early Middle Ages. One big thing is that suits of plate armor should not be present - chain mail should instead be prevalent throughout. This extends even to the elves, who often have a look more in line with modern fantastical imagery than what Tolkien was going for, and as a special note they should be using straight swords. Barad-dûr is rather absurd - here's a sketch of its base by Tolkien himself. It's quite clearly more of a realistic castle design than what's seen in the film. There was also no Lighthouse Sauron Eyeball. Sauron by the later Third Age had reincarnated himself, and Tolkien describes him thus:   Sauron should be thought of as very terrible. The form that he took was that of a man of more than human stature, but not gigantic.   The orcs are a little too monstrous, in my opinion. This description is very much a product of Tolkien's time, but here's how he described their look:   They are (or were) squad, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes: in fact degraded and repulsive versions of the (to Europeans) least lovely Mongol-types.   There should not be great variances in how the orcs look. That is, 'goblins' and 'orcs' were the same being, and uruk-hai, while larger than other orcs, were not larger than men.  Gandalf is one of the more accurate characters, though he's somewhat too tall.  Some of the other major design issues, though certainly not a comprehensive list:   Frodo should appear to be in his mid thirties or so. This (33 years old) is when he acquired the Ring, which slowed down his aging, though he was 50 when he went on his quest. Aragorn should be a much larger man, and a brief note in Unfinished Tales could mean that he should not have a beard. Saruman should appear after his fall is made known in a robe made of many colors.  When Galadriel is tempted by the Ring, she does not become a monstrous witch surrounded by gloomy darkness and special effects. Rather, she lights up the space around her and become exquisitely beautiful and serene. The balrog is completely and totally off. Fire is really the only thing it has to do with Tolkien's balrog, not counting smoke and ash as 'shadow.' The balrog should really be no more than 10 feet tall, and likely more around 7-8 feet. No wings, no horn, no tail. It should come off as an intelligent being, more than a beast. The flying steeds of the Ringwraiths should be more like giant featherless birds rather than dragon-like creatures. Ents were not animated trees. While described with ambiguous tree-properties, there's no justification for putting branches and such all over them.  Wargs should be wolves, not hyenas.  Orthanc should be a smooth surface, and the outer wall of Minas Tirith should be of the same material. The Argonath had axes, not swords."

lotr,3axtfl,magradhaid,6,Wed Jun 24 14:15:01 2015 UTC,"Wow. Thanks for the detailed reply. As I said I haven't read the books - not for lack of trying - but I am really interested in how the world is depicted.   Obviously Jackson's interpretation was never going to be 100% faithful, but I feel as though a little more attention could have been paid to the source material. I feel a little sad for the dedicated LOTR fans because most people see Jackson's depiction as THE definitive one, and will probably impose that style on the world when/if they read the book.  Still a great mythos; I love reading the wiki's and getting detailed explanations of the world."

lotr,3axtfl,dr_amy_bishop,2,Wed Jun 24 19:09:15 2015 UTC,"For example, here's a scene[1] from Rohan, with Mordor looking like maybe a day or two away on foot - I believe at this time they are to the northwest of Edoras.   This is actually taken from the book. Jackson probably misread and thought it should be portrayed literally but Legolas really does see Barad-Dur from Meduseld.   The others too now turned their eyes eastward. Over the sundering leagues of land, far away they gazed to the edge of sight, and hope and fear bore their thoughts still on, beyond dark mountains to the Land of Shadow. Where now was the Ring-bearer? How thin indeed was the thread upon which doom still hung! It seemed to Legolas, as he strained his farseeing eyes, that he caught a glint of white: far away perchance the sun twinkled on a pinnacle of the Tower of Guard. And further still, endlessly remote and yet a present threat, there was a tiny tongue of flame.   Also,   Frodo should appear to be in his mid thirties or so. This (33 years old) is when he acquired the Ring, which slowed down his aging, though he was 50 when he went on his quest.   Hobbits have slightly longer lifespans than men; a hobbit's 33 is about equivalent to a human's 23, making Wood fairly accurate (especially in conjunction with Frodo being described as very pretty for a hobbit)."
lotr,3axtfl,Edledhron,3,Thu Jun 25 17:50:22 2015 UTC,"There's quite a bit of difference between the fantastical eyesight of elves and what Jackson portrays, and that's just one example of many of Jackson cramming Middle-earth together.  Hobbits do not have a longer lifespan than men -- they are men, in fact! The only evidence that they live longer than the big folk is that there were two hobbits who lived extraordinarily long lives, one of them being aided by the Ring, and that their sociological coming of age is at 33. The evidence we have for more normal human lifespans is a rather large collection of hobbits lifespans in Appendix C consistently showing hobbits dying of old age at a time perfectly achievable by the big folk, along with some descriptions of how hobbits should age in the early chapters of The Lord of the Rings."

In the discussions of 'true' ents, their tree like nature is, again, made very ambiguous. I think Ted Nasmith did a good job of portraying them, as can be seen here:  http://tednasmith.poverellomedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/TN-Wellinghall.jpg  http://tednasmith.poverellomedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/TN-Treebeard_and_the_Entmoot.jpg  http://tednasmith.poverellomedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/TN-The_Wrath_of_the_Ents.jpg  http://tednasmith.poverellomedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/TN-The_Tree_Shepherds.jpg  Definitely features reminiscent of trees, but still far from what Jackson portrays."

I don't know about Aragorn being ""much larger.""

The Balrog is supposed to be a great shadow ""wreathed in fire"" and emitting smoke, and when it faces off with Gandalf, it ""drew itself up to a great height,"" [greater than it already was] ""and its wings were spread from wall to wall."" Keeping in mind that they're in a large Dwarven hall, I'm pretty sure it's much larger than 7-8 feet.  And when Galadriel is tempted by the ring, she is lit up by her ring, but everything around her is dark."

You'd have to ask Peter Jackson for his timeline, I can only compare Tolkien's descriptions to what's portrayed on screen. Also, Tolkien's Rohan and Gondor in winter would still not account for Jackson's portrayal. I mean, winter may not be good for crops, but it does not entirely eradicate farmlands.   I don't know about Aragorn being ""much larger."" He comes off as over six feet in the movies, IMO, and while he's supposed to be 6'6"", there are only a few times (e.g. when he reveals his identity to the riders of Rohan) where he has this big ""kingly"" presence.   Viggo is 5' 11,"" and doesn't have a huge build. I never got the impression that the films made him look larger than he is. It's not a big deal (the much bigger changes to Aragorn occur with his character), but it is a difference.   Yes, Saruman's robe is supposed to be of Many Colours, but it's subtle enough that Gandalf doesn't notice it until Saruman points it out, and, let's face it, there's no way to pull it off in a movie without it looking ridiculous and giving everyone seizures.   Maybe, I wouldn't rule out a filmmaker being able to pull it off. But again, it is a difference, and this thread is about differences, rather than justifications behind them.   The Balrog is supposed to be a great shadow ""wreathed in fire"" and emitting smoke, and when it faces off with Gandalf, it ""drew itself up to a great height,"" [greater than it already was] ""and its wings were spread from wall to wall."" Keeping in mind that they're in a large Dwarven hall, I'm pretty sure it's much larger than 7-8 feet.   In their original description, balrogs were about twice the size of an elf. However, Tolkien shrunk them down in the process of writing LotR.  From The Treason of Isengard:   A figure strode to the fissure, no more than man-high yet terror seemed to go before it.   And then   of man-shape maybe, and not much larger   Then   of man-shape maybe, and not much greater   And finally   of man-shape maybe, yet greater   So while not as short as Tolkien initially had Durin's Bane, it's safe to assume that the balrog was now conceived of being as much shorter than previously. The balrog also had to be able to fit through a rather narrow doorway and stand on the bridge. If it was of a great height, it could not do this (indeed, in Jackson's film, his balrog only manages to put a single foot on the bridge).  As for drawing itself up to a great height, this is a matter of perception rather than physicality. Characters make themselves seem larger than they were all the time in Tolkien's writing - Aragorn does it, Gandalf does it, etc.  Its 'wings' were simply a way of describing the darkness around it - and Tolkien is quite consistent in calling it shadow and darkness. Smoke is only involved when the balrog leaps across the fissure. There is no physicality to them, and indeed this darkness was very vast. If these were literal wings stretching across the hall, even a 30 foot balrog (twice the size ever envisioned by Tolkien!) would appear ludicrous as this was a very, very large cavernous hall. The balrog would be absolutely dwarfed (ha!) by its wings. 7-8 feet is a likely size for the balrog, up to 10 feet is in the realm of possibility, 12 feet would really be pushing it, anything more is simply impossible for what the balrog is described as doing.   And when Galadriel is tempted by the ring, she is lit up by her ring, but everything around her is dark.   You're right there - that's what I get for writing the post at 4 in the morning! What I was trying to convey more than anything is that she doesn't get all green and such."

lotr,3axtfl,rustybob,0,Wed Jun 24 21:58:32 2015 UTC,"Jackson's middle earth really does impart the epic style of middle earth. The balrog as the stereotypical demon of fire with it's horns and wings conveys many cultural associations in a way which might be difficult to do with a portrayal which is more true to tolkien's work. Also, barad dur in the lotr film trilogy is really impressive. The camera slowly pans over a chasm of lava and then moves upward, encompassing a massive tower which ends in a double pronged spike - it's riveting. In the books the only thing we really know about it is that it is always wreathed in shadows and clouds. Sam's vision of the piercing red light from the window of barad dur is more of a symptom of delirium than a concrete fact and when the movie tries to adapt it they really butcher it. Mount doom is really good as well. If you ignore the actors (which somehow seem to detract from the experience) all the elements of a glorious finale are there. An outcrop of badly-hewn stone juts into a volcano and the air is rent with waves of heat and spirals of smoke from the sea of lava below.   That's not to say that the lotr film trilogy is a faithful adaption in any sense. It's just that it conveys the epic scale quite well. The shot in the fellowship of the ring where gandalf is on the outskirts of minas tirith as the sun is setting, with light shining upon the city and darkness encroaching from mordor across the pelennor fields is quite like tolkien's repeated symbolic use of east and west as metaphors for good and evil. Of course, you are correct in all the points you bring up. The films really don't do justice to the original story in thematic content. A real adaption of the books, complete with tom bombadil, surreal elven wanderers, and a balrog which has existed since the first age and before, would be something to behold."
lotr,3axtfl,Edledhron,3,Wed Jun 24 23:40:56 2015 UTC,"I would say the epic tone of the films is different than that of the books.

I feel they screwed up the Orcs sizes in the Hobbit. I get that Azog, or whoever, is an Orc so is bigger than Bilbo and the Dwarves but I thought his companions were supposed to be goblins, so smaller so they are about Dwarf height. Then when Bolg fights Legolas he seems even bigger than before. Bigger than any Uruks from LOTR."

I've read that he initially actually thought that Sauron was just the Eye of Sauron, but that seems improbable (which doesn't make it impossible) given that he had advisers who know Middle-Earth's lore fairly well. What's certain is that by the time of Return of the King he knew Sauron had a body and even planned on having him duel Aragon in the Battle of the Black Gate. The scenes of Aragorn fighting a giant armored troll were actually shot with him fighting Sauron and later digitally altered, which explains the weird way Anduril connects with the troll's sword and armor."

He never really had anyone familiar with the general lore for the first trilogy, instead having a couple artists (one with a history of gross misinterpretation) and a linguist, and making up the rest with his fellow screenwriters. When he did the Hobbit films, he started treating one of those screenwriters as his lore expert, but it's pretty clear Boyens never deserved the title. He also, for that second trilogy, hired another expert to provide fact-checking for information he wasn't allowed to use, but she was not on-site and she is on record as thinking he didn't listen to her other suggestions on lore."

He was heavily involved in an incident involving the copying and publication of Tolkien's Quenya rendition of the Lord's Prayer against the express wishes of the Tolkien Estate (and in violation of copyright).

Peter: Yeah, the Eye is the bane of my life!  Fran: The Eye was such a horror to dramatise.  Peter: Having you central villain being nothing more than a flaming eyeball is a little bit of a problem. Of course, what we did is we elevated Saruman, in a sense, to the villainry role and kept the Eye relatively a minor player.

This is the case for some other things too, Aragorn's journey through the Paths of the Dead is told afterwards by Gimli and Legolas.  In the books we hear him described by Gollum through Gandalf, that he has ""nine fingers on the black hand"", but otherwise we see him through the Palantír as ""the Eye"", and also when the Fellowship breaks up at Amon Hen where Frodo feels the Eye of Sauron on him. The Eye is also his symbol.  He has a physical body by the time of the War of the Ring, and for a whole bunch of centuries before that. I think a ""problem"" with turning the books into movies is that while Sauron is the main villain, he is off-screen pretty much the entire book. We hear of how evil and dangerous he is, but we don't really see him. Doesn't match up with what people expect of a movie.

This means that they amassed treasure more efficiently and in greater quantities than the other free people who were more at home in the forests and hills. Sauron's magic rings didn't turn the dwarves into wraiths, but rather drove them with more gold lust for more treasure.  Dragons, for whatever reason, love their treasure. They pile it up, sleep on it, know ever single coin in their collection, and can't spend a dime of it. They take offense to the theft of a single copper coin in the same way one might react to treason or murder. The ability to know the exact inventory, and to notice something like a cup being removed from it (this happened in the hobbit) leads me to believe they could probably smell gold and jewels, and were then drawn towards such hordes that existed (usually dwarven property).   Put them all together and what do you get?  Dead dwarves, 4 melted magic rings, and the decline of a great people."

lotr,3auq4l,urukhai434,82,Tue Jun 23 17:42:25 2015 UTC,"To give a bit more of an explanation than other responses, Gondor once had sort of a sister kingdom up in the north of Middle-earth around the area of the Shire, Bree, Weathertop, and beyond called Arnor, which was founded by Isildur's father Elendil (Gondor was founded by Isildur and his brother Anárion). Due to a dispute among the sons of the tenth king, Arnor was split apart into three kingdoms: Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. The three kingdoms found themselves in conflict with each other, and in Cardolan and Rhudaur Isildur's descendents died out. This prompted Arthedain to reclaim the whole of Arnor, but this was resisted in Rhudaur, which had allied themselves with the growing force of Angmar. Angmar was ruled by the Lord of the Nazgûl, though called the Witch-king as no one knew his true identity at this time.  Eventually, this led to an alliance of Arthedain, Cardolan, and the elves which beat back Angmar for a time. However, Cardolan had been defeated, and its people basically wiped out by the war and a great plague. The Dúnedain, the descendents of Númenór who were sort of a ruling elite in Gondor and Arnor, more or less only remained in Arthedain by this time.  About 300 years after the plague, Angmar invaded again, and Arthedain was lost, though an alliance from Gondor and the Elves drove back Angmar. The Dúnedain of the North were now very few in number, and their kingdoms destroyed. After the death of the last king of Arthedain, they 'became a secret and wandering people,' fighting back the frequent invasions of evil beings into Eriador during the later Third Age. The Line of Isildur remained, also secret, and led the Dúnedain as their chieftains. It's also worth noting that those of this line were raised in Rivendell, only going out to become a Ranger after maturing."

lotr,3avwr1,WSseba,2,Wed Jun 24 15:18:35 2015 UTC,"In the book it only says that ""they"" called it Grond. Personally I've always thought that it was the orcs who called it that, but maybe I am wrong.  It also dosen't seem like many men would even know about Grond, yet alone name a ram in memory of it."
lotr,3avwr1,EyeceEyeceBaby,3,Thu Jun 25 14:26:00 2015 UTC,"I agree the text is quite ambiguous, but if the Orcs are the ones calling it ""Grond"" you run into the same problem of Orcs giving their battering ram an elvish name. Unfortunately we don't have a ton of info on the culture of Gondor and of Orcs during the time of the War of the Ring but I imagine it's far more likely for the Dúnedain to know the historical context of the name in Sindarin and would use it. If Orcs knew about Melkor's mace, I think it's questionable if they would know of and decide to use the Sindarin name for it. There's the argument that they're just calling it what their superiors/Sauron called it, but again it seems unlikely someone who despises elves as much as Sauron would allow their language to be used.  Keep in mind, the original Grond is a weapon out of ancient history to all parties involved here. The question is who is more likely to remember it? I doubt very much there are Orcish loremasters passing down this sort of knowledge. I suppose I could be wrong since we know so little about Orcish culture outside of their warriors, but looking to what we do know for context it seems unlikely."
lotr,3avwr1,WSseba,2,Thu Jun 25 14:56:30 2015 UTC,"If it was the orcs who called it Grond, the most obvious answer is that Sauron named it Grond, and the orcs just kinda went with it (even if they didn't know what it meant).   I also did some research on the internet, seems like nobody knows who orignally named it. It just says it's named after Morgoths hammer. I guess we will never know for sure."
lotr,3avwr1,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:32:40 2015 UTC,"My point is that Sauron wouldn't have used a Sindarin word in the first place. We know he (and his Orcs) called things by their names in Black Speech. For instance:   Barad-Dûr (Sindarin) = Lugbúrz (Black Speech) Úlairi (Quenya) = Nazgûl (Black Speech) Orch (Sindarin) = Orco (Quenya) = Uruk (Black Speech) Torog (Sindarin) = Olog (Black Speech) [Eng: Troll]   It could a simple error on Tolkien's part, akin to the Mouth of Sauron using the name 'Sauron' to describe his master (Sauron being Quenya for 'the Abhorred,' a name used only by his enemies and forbidden by his servants). The only way I see it not being an error is if ""they"" refers to the defenders."

It really conveys the despair and tragedy the characters are facing at that particular moment.  In answer to your side question, I've actually seen all three in convert. FotR with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the rest with the 21st Century Symphony Orchestra. The difference it makes is unreal, especially the vocal performances. I'm not sure how much of a testament it is to Shore's work in particular though, as I can think of a few films I'd love to see with live accompaniment. In fact a number films Horner worked on are on that list (Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Braveheart). Still, Shore's work on LotR is wonderful."

They're more known for movie trailer and videogame scores but are slowly making their way into film score, I feel.  Their albums are some of the only ones I buy outright without pre-listening just because I like them so much.   Their YouTube video on the making of the song Freedom Ship is great to watch the entire orchestra (https://youtu.be/Zu7kChDaySM) (yeah I'm not the best at linking from the reddit app, sorry).  But other of their songs are very upbeat and driving - Archangel, Strength of a Thousand Men, Heart of Courage, To Glory, Children of the Sun (a big favorite of mine). Cannon in D Minor is what I'm listening to right now but it's from their new album Battlecry so I'm not sure if it's on YouTube yet or not.  Bottom line, if you enjoy movie and videogame music, you should listen to TSfH."

Well, in the beginning they were purely movie trailer music (they've even done some TV shows too), so the songs couldn't be too long. Now that they're getting into video games and even movie scores, they're becoming more fully orchestral and less percussion-driven (if that's understandable).  Either way I love their songs. I really want to go see them when/if they come out to the Hollywood Bowl. I know they played the Disney Concert Hall here in LA a few years ago so I don't see why they wouldn't do a Bowl performance as their popularity grows."

Children of the Sun by Thomas Bergersen (sp?)

lotr,3arnuv,Swiggityswagity,13,Mon Jun 22 23:25:29 2015 UTC,"After Sauron's defeat, Mordor returned to its more original climate since Orodruin stopped erupting constantly, and the lands weren't being razed to feed armies anymore.  I seem to recall some reclaimation being done by some groups after Aragorn's coronation, but I can't remember all of the details of that right now."
lotr,3arnuv,idiotsonfire,11,Tue Jun 23 02:24:08 2015 UTC,Years of volcanic ash probably made the valley pretty fertile. Although I imagine there were no shortage of caves and crevasses for the remainder of the orc armies to hide in so raiding probably dissuaded settlement for quite some time. But that land would come in handy for supplying Gondor's and Rohan's armies in their campaigns in the east so reclamation is entirely feasible.
lotr,3arnuv,Turin082,2,Tue Jun 23 03:55:56 2015 UTC,"The valley of Gorgoroth was unfortunately not just covered in volcanic ash. Tolkien describes its pits filled with vile slimes and oozes, probably due to the polluted rain produced by Orodruin's noxious fumes. The region was also extensively and carelessly mined, with no through given to the mining refuse and other such things. Finally, orcs lived there, filling the land with their filth (they weren't exactly an hygenic, environmentally-conscious people). It was essentially a vision of a land completely subjugated to the needs of industry, spefically the war industry.  On the other hand, with Sauron's death his servants ran really far away from Mordor. The region had never been by itself an orc stronghold; the creatures came and multiplied there only under the influence of either Sauron or the Nazgul acting in his stead."

And the King pardoned the Easterlings that had given themselves up, and sent them away free, and he made peace with the peoples of Harad; and the slaves of Mordor he released and gave to them all the lands about Lake Núrnen to be their own"

The southern area of Nurn, which was green and fertile and served as the breadbasket of Sauron's war machine, was given by King Elessar to Sauron's former slaves, and was under the protection of the King."
lotr,3arnuv,HJonGoldrake,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:27:58 2015 UTC,"green and somewhat good-looking place   I assume you get this from Shadow of Mordor, and this is an inaccurate representation--the area of Mordor near the Black Gate, Mount Doom, and Barad-Dur (an area known as Gorgoroth) has always been black, arid, and desolate. If my assumption is correct, I urge you to remember that Shadow of Mordor is grossly not canon, making up lore in some cases, and directly contradicting it in others.  Anyway, the region of Nurn was more fertile than Gorgoroth, even during Sauron's reign. It was used to grow food for Sauron's armies, and the fields were worked by slaves. At the end of the war, Aragorn gave the land to the slaves to live on as free men."

Here are some of the events in the century or so surrounding Déagol's finding of the Ring. Italics are my own notes for a bit more context. Everything else is straight out of Appendix B.    2063 - Gandalf goes to Dol Guldor. Sauron retreats and hides in the East. The Watchful Peace begins. The Nazgûl remain quiet in Minas Morgul. 2460 - The Watchful Peace ends. Sauron returns in strength to Dol Guldor. 2463 - The White Council is formed. About this time Déagol the Stoor finds the One Ring, and is murdered by Sméagol. 2470 - About this time Sméagol-Gollum hides in the Misty Mountains. 2475 - Attack on Gondor renewed. Osgiliath is finally ruined and its stone-bridge broken. c. 2480 - Orcs begin to make secret strongholds in the Misty Mountains so as to bar all passes into Eriador. Sauron begins to people Moria with his creatures. 2509 Celebrían (Elrond's wife), journeying to Lorien, is waylaid in the Redhorn Pass, and receives a poisoned wound. 2510 Celebrían departs over the Sea. Orcs and Easterlings overrun Calenardhon. Eorl the Young wins the victory of the Field of Celebrant. The Rohirrim settle in Calenadrhon. (Founding of Rohan. Previously these people lived far to the north up the Anduin river)   So to answer your question more concisely, not much was occurring in the years leading up to  the Ring's discovery. The Watchful Peace was largely uneventful. During this time, Thorin I left Erebor for the Grey Mountains and Buckland is founded in the Shire. Beyond that it was, unsurprisingly, peaceful. The return of Sauron to Dol Guldor and the finding of the Ring began an era of conflict once more.  There's a hell of a lot more that occurred during the remaining 500 or so years prior to the War of the Ring (too much to type out here) so I'll let you check out the Appendices if you're curious."

I can't remember if Shelob was aware that the hobbits had the ring, but I think the book said something along the lines of like ""she didn't care for the rings of power of mortals""/the wars and struggles of men.

As other people have pointed out, she cared little [read: none] for the ring; She was only interested in eating (and killing), and discarding what she didn't eat.  I don't believe there was anything definite about a particular pact concerning the ring, but Gollum did have an arrangement with Shelob to bring her food.  It was mentioned that he had previously done that with other creatures.  Before or around Ithilien, he had already had a conversation with himself that she might ""take care of them"" and he could easily search and find the ring.  And as they approached her lair, he did go ahead of Sam/Frodo while they rested (they assumed he went off to find food he could eat) - to either let her her know, or specifically make a deal (Tolkien didn't go into what he specifically did when sneaking off).    So, she would have gotten the ring, but not been influenced by it, and either just left it or given it post-desiccation form to Gollum (directly or let Gollum search)."

lotr,3amtk3,DroidLogician,14,Sun Jun 21 23:46:16 2015 UTC,"I have seen this one. My only major complaint is that the creator used a much lower quality source for the Battle of Five Armies footage, so the framerate and fidelity suddenly goes to shit. I dunno if he's redone it since or is planning to.   The other problem is that while it might be a more faithful cut, it's almost all just plot points and robs the films of a lot of their personality. There's a few things we're better off without, but I think the editor shouldn't have cut elements so aggressively.   For example, I think the Investigation of Dol Guldur arc, while not portrayed in the book, does a good job of explaining where Gandalf went off to as well as referencing Saruman's fall into darkness as well as Sauron's return to power, which is good for people who primarily have gotten the lore through the movies."

They could have been vastly improved upon, but removing them entirely struck me as overzealous.  Another big problem for me was the expurgation, in its entirety, of ""Out of the Frying Pan, Into the Fire.""  It would have been incredibly difficult to excise the Azog subplot from that sequence, but as a result the ""Tolkien edit"" has the dwarves fleeing from the Misty Mountains at breakneck speed and running straight to Beorn's house.  In my opinion, that messes with Tolkien's story a lot more than including one extra fight with an orc would.  Plus, it gets rid of Bilbo's little speech, and that was the only Peter Jackson addition that I actually thought worked well in the movies I've seen."

And imagine how Tolkien would feel about the barrel riding scene. I thought it was funny and an interesting scene, but it is an utter disgrace that they tried to pass it off as an adaptation of the book scene. About 50% of the movies is made up of stuff that I can't imagine Tolkien writing about.  Still, I liked the hobbit trilogy because I'm a fan of Peter Jackson and the middle earth setting. But it is almost nothing like the book, especially in tone. The overall events are the same but SO much of the dialogue and minor things were changed everywhere."

And I think they could kept things closer to the book and keep it more interesting: in the LotR appenices it says that Thrór was beheaded when he wandered into Moria, he is beheaded and that starts the war (in the films he is beheaded during the war, removing the reason). In the appendix it says Dáin killed Azog right before the doors of Moria and he says the time is not right because he felt the fear emanating from the Balrog. Then Thráin comes up and says they have reclaimed Moria, and Dáin tells him that it is not the time because he felt Durin's Bane. If they had done that they would have tied in with the LotR movies, and it would have introduced Dáin in a non-idiotic manner. Movie-Dáin was pretty off in my opinion."

lotr,3alzrs,LordBojangles,21,Sun Jun 21 23:38:00 2015 UTC,"P.S. This might not be the most satisfying answer; might I suggest looking into the material Tolkien was drawing from?  Orcs in Tolkien's work have folkloric traits of both Goblins and Ogres: they are small, mean, cave-dwelling thieves, possibly with magical or supernatural abilities, certainly with material culture and language, but are also cannibalistic (in the sense that they eat humans), ugly, strong, and (seemingly) technologically unsophisticated.  Their vulnerability to sunlight is interesting: he apparently lifted that straight from George MacDonald's The Princess and the Goblin, probably because it fits in with his theme of dark/light dichotomy, but more pragmatically, it links them with the Trolls--which, I don't need to remind you, turn to stone in sunlight.  Folkloric trolls, like goblins & ogres, vary across time and place, but some traits that interest me are their forming family groups/communities independent of Christian society, and having a habit of kidnapping people and of overrunning people's lands.  So, we could define orcish society by its separation from and antagonism toward the Free Peoples--which is what we'd expect, given that the story is written from the latter's perspective--but within that frame, their day-to-day lives might not seem all that different from those of Men or Dwarves."

I don't think we have any evidence of a second generation of Uruk-hai, so if they are half-human, maybe they're infertile, like mules?  In that case, orcs & men would indeed be different species."
lotr,3alzrs,LordBojangles,8,Mon Jun 22 13:09:50 2015 UTC,"I cannot remember my source, but I seem to remember mentioned that orcs kept a semblance of (very poorly yielding) farms in the south of Mordor, South/south-East of the sea of Nurnen. I would then draw the conclusion that this would be where non-soldiers, i.e. females and children, would reside until scripted or whichever system was used. Not much else written about it that I can recall. This was BEFORE the films though, I don't depend on any information taken from the films as trustworthy lore."
lotr,3alzrs,Silmarilli,7,Mon Jun 22 14:08:50 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the farms in southern Morder be very arable?  Tons of volcanic soil+ a region with lots of waterfall.
lotr,3alzrs,lolol42,5,Sun Jun 21 19:20:58 2015 UTC,Yes. No idea where he's getting 'poorly yielding' from.
lotr,3alzrs,Uluithiad,2,Mon Jun 22 00:11:35 2015 UTC,There were actually human slaves living around Nurnen. I guess there could have been female orcs as well but probably not in the same place.
lotr,3alzrs,Melonskal,15,Mon Jun 22 03:08:50 2015 UTC,"Tolkien didn't go into much detail regarding the Orcs; as I recall, he actually never made his own mind up about where they came from.  One version (in the Silmarillion) is that they were corrupted Elves, but Tolkien was uncomfortable with that later because of the implication of being completely irredeemable or something.  I'm reducing the arguments a bit here, but at the same time Tolkien didn't want Morgoth to be able to actually create life, only warp it. The Silmarillion doesn't help much, because it uses the Orc corruption backstory but also has Morgoth creating Dragons and stuff.  TL;DR You're asking about a subject Tolkien himself was unsure of."
lotr,3alzrs,Tolkienite,5,Mon Jun 22 00:12:54 2015 UTC,"While the uncertainty of their origins is due to Tolkien himself being uncertain as to how he wanted them to be portrayed, juggling the moral implications of ""Irredeemably corrupted elves/men"" versus ""A race of their own that is unanimously evil"". I think it sets itself up perfectly for a Watsonian explanation. Perhaps the reason that there's this disagreement between in-universe sources as to where the Orcs come from is because no one really knows. It's likely that Morgoth and Ilúvitar are the only ones that know the whole truth of their creation, and neither of them are around for a Q&A. So rumours are spread among Elves and Men of where their enemy came from. I can easily imagine the ""corrupted elves/men"" theory beginning as a superstition to keep the young and foolish away from places under Morgoth's influence."
lotr,3alzrs,GabrielMunn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:35:30 2015 UTC,"I actually consider this the most reasonable explanation. Creation myths in realms of lore and the world we live in are just that: myths. It seems reasonable to assume that these groups, millennia after the fact, would have but myth and rumor on the subject. Truly a well reasoned argument that i personally now subscribe to. I think not only well reasoned, but most fitting as well."
lotr,3alzrs,sigurbjorn1,5,Sun Jun 21 20:05:58 2015 UTC,"In The Two Towers (movie) in one of the scenes in Isengard don't we see orcs being 'born' or created from the ground? I had assumed that's where they came from, if not then what's going on in that scene?"
lotr,3alzrs,Lady_Macbeths_Ghost,25,Mon Jun 22 03:02:49 2015 UTC,That scene is movie specific. In that scene saruman is making Uruk-hai from orcs.
lotr,3alzrs,MrUnderhil,7,Sun Jun 21 17:20:50 2015 UTC,"That is the Uruk-Hai being ""bred"" and is only from the movie..another of Jackson's fantasies."
lotr,3alzrs,2mobile2,2,Sun Jun 21 17:29:44 2015 UTC,What canonically creates Uruk Hai?
lotr,3alzrs,Lucarian,2,Sun Jun 21 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"AFAIK it's the result of orcs breeding with humans, and I also think Saruman used some kind of magic to make them grow faster."
lotr,3alzrs,WSseba,0,Mon Jun 22 01:31:15 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not canon but it's not completely made up by Jackson.   In Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings, Saruman appears to be the only one who created the Uruks. They are shown in the movie as being released from a kind of membrane in the mud deep under Isengard (special commentary on the DVD edition explained that they were trying to base the scene on a early description of Tolkien's that Orcs ""worm their way out of the ground like maggots"")."
lotr,3alzrs,JE98,7,Mon Jun 22 02:35:58 2015 UTC,Jackson attributing his own fever dreams to Tolkien is still just Jackson.
lotr,3alzrs,Uluithiad,-3,Mon Jun 22 02:10:59 2015 UTC,"Two separate quotes from the movies may be useful here.  ""By foul craft Saruman has crossed orcs with goblin men, he's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.""  ""Do you know how the orcs first came into being? They were elves once. Taken by the dark powers, tortured and mutilated, a ruined and terrible form of life. And now perfected, my fighting Uruk-hai. Whom do you serve?"""
lotr,3alzrs,DemandsBattletoads,16,Mon Jun 22 03:14:53 2015 UTC,The second quote is inaccurate. Tolkien never came to a final decision about the origin of orcs.
lotr,3alzrs,PersonUsingAComputer,-1,Sun Jun 21 15:19:24 2015 UTC,"But the quote reflects the concept laid out in the Silmarillion, which is presumably the most popular ""creation myth"" among elves."

Gandalf gives the map and the key to Thorin when they meet in Bilbo's house.  This is the family line. Thráin I, Thrór, Thráin II, Thorin II Oakenshield.  Thrór gave the key and the map to his son Thráin II, who in turn gave them to Gandalf, who passed them on to Thorin Oakenshield. So it should be the same key, perhaps they started to call it Thorin's key when it was in possession of Thorin."
lotr,3an6if,ReinierPersoon,2,Sun Jun 21 21:56:50 2015 UTC,"Ok - that makes sense, except that they look SO different! Just makes me feel like I must be missing something, especially since both versions of the key are ""official"" versions (recognized by LOTR)."

Maybe they just released a version after film 1 and released another version after film 2 or 3?  At least in the original story there is only one key, handed down to the sons."
lotr,3an6if,ReinierPersoon,0,Sun Jun 21 22:10:22 2015 UTC,Yeah - good point. I hadn't considered that possibility. Do you remember any scene in the film where Thror / the key are mentioned / portrayed?

Gandalf gives the key to Thorin (this is 32 minutes in on my extended) and Thorin later has a talk with Balin while holding it.  Then there is likely a scene where they use the key to enter the mountain, but I don't remember where that one is.

I just googled it and there is some scene where Thráin hands over the key and map to Gandalf. By that time he is crazy. (Edit: I googled it and it's not in the theatrical release, maybe it's only in the extended edition)  (In the books the chronology is slightly different, Thrór gives the key to Thráin before he goes to Moria where he is beheaded, and that is actually the cause for the War of Dwarves and Orcs)"

The tang is part of the blade that extends through the hilt of the sword, all the way through the pommel, where it is usually peened (similar  to how a rivet is used), this is necessary for solid construction capable of proper use. UC swords instead have the tang extend to about 5 inches into the handle and it is only glued in place.   I've made a more detailed primer on collecting swords and differences between fake decorative ""swords"" and real ones if you'd like to learn more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqQp6YEoaD8&list=PLCydpUzSrpL7_2RxqJhEGpJwBCDAaZ8Ao"

No fancy cars or expensive watches.  I'm really into listening to music and home theater, so I spent a little more than the average person that department.

These should be your go to if you want an accurate high quality replica."
lotr,3ai6hp,DarthJacob,4,Sat Jun 20 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"Woah! A topic I actually know something about!  United Cutlery does not make functional swords and most online smiths I've looked at seem to be perpetually out of stock. There are smiths that will custom forge you a sword for an arm and a leg.  A while ago, United Cutlery decided to make a line of swords that were replicas of the original props used in the films. These swords are full tang and made of spring steel so you can swing them and cut boxes without risk of the blade breaking.  They are actually very beautiful and hand aged so they appear ancient and each one is unique. The crossguards are sterling silver and the jeweled hilt is real lab-grown sapphire. They also fit the scabbards of the non-functional swords. They come in a display box with a certificate of authenticity. Unfortunately the company went bankrupt before they made any more than a thousand Glamdrings and Stings, so those are the only ones available. Some old knife shops still have a couple sitting around, but they'll cost you thousands.  When UC went bankrupt they had not completed each sword so when they sold all their assets, most did not get certificates or display boxes. These swords are the ones you should attempt to find and purchase. I got my museum collection Glamdring from a reputable ebay seller by the name of Redfordfilms for $400, and a week later I was cutting boxes with it in my back yard. It feels like a dream in your hands and is actually lighter than the stainless steel wall-hangers. The grip is fine quality leather, too.  But you get what you pay for. I did not receive a display box, nor a certificate of authenticity, so I don't really know it's true origin. But Redfordfilms is a reputable retailer and I trust them. One other thing is that UC had a stupid-ass idea of storage and put the tips of the swords in blocks of wood, so, when stacked in the storage facility, all of the tips slightly bent. But it is only a slight bend. Last I saw I think they still had a few left for about $500 each.  If you get one though, you have to clean it and oil every now and then.  I hope this helps you, your girlfriend sounds really cool.  TL;DR: go to ebay and buy a museum collection glamdring or sting from Redford films if you want a functional replica."

lotr,3ai6hp,shyguymcfly,9,Sat Jun 20 15:27:16 2015 UTC,Presumably the higher priced product is made with more care and with better quality metal
lotr,3ai6hp,SarcasticCannibal,4,Sat Jun 20 15:47:40 2015 UTC,"The difference is usually in functionality. A cheaper sword will have a blade that is made with cheaper steel, and is merely bolted to the hilt. A blade like this is likely to rattle or come loose after swinging it around/hitting things with it.   A more expensive sword usually has a full tang, which is where the blade is forged to have steel running from pommel to tip, making the sword one solid piece of metal."
lotr,3ai6hp,House_of_Batiatus,3,Sat Jun 20 16:40:27 2015 UTC,"so if I'm more concerned with it being for display purposes only, are the cheaper versions still good for visual quality like one from ThinkGeek"

lotr,3ajg42,OllieRouse,54,Sat Jun 20 20:02:51 2015 UTC,"Saruman's 'alliance' with Sauron was merely a rivalrous facade; he wanted to keep Sauron's focus elsewhere while they raced to find the ring. Saruman had no real intention of succumbing to Sauron, for he too wanted to oppress and be the sole ruler of Middle-Earth."
lotr,3ajg42,12secondcountdown,27,Sat Jun 20 21:28:00 2015 UTC,"I should add that Sauron and Saruman both saw through the other's guise of alliance; all it provided them was some assurance that the people of Middle-Earth were the primary foe for the time being (enemy of my enemy is my friend), however they would have likely turned on each other soon after that threat had been extinguished, with Sauron being the obvious victor unless the ring came into play. Remember how paranoid Sauron got when he believed Saruman had possession of the ring after ""capturing"" Pippin?  Some may argue that Sauron exerted some sort of influence over Saruman through their liaison via the palantiri, though I question this as Saruman himself is the master of creeping influence over others, and would unlikely be easily swayed."
lotr,3ajg42,12secondcountdown,13,Sun Jun 21 00:41:44 2015 UTC,"To your last point, Saruman's corruption started well before he obtained the palantir (If I recall, one of the reasons he moved to Orthanc in the first place was to use the palantir and find the ring). However, Tolkien has hinted numerous times that Sauron did indeed ""dominate"" Saruman's will, escalating his fall from grace.   ""[Denethor] must have guessed that the Ithil-stone [Sauron's palantír] was in evil hands, and risked contact with it, trusting his strength. His trust was not entirely unjustified. Sauron failed to dominate him and could only influence him by deceits. Saruman fell under the domination of Sauron... [while] Denethor remained steadfast in his rejection of Sauron, but was made to believe that his defeat was inevitable, and so fell into despair. The reasons for this difference were no doubt that in the first place Denethor was a man of great strength of will and maintained the integrity of his personality until the final blow of the (apparently) mortal wound of his only surviving son."" -Tolkien's essay on the Palantir  This subject, clarifying the canon, has also been discussed on reddit already here."
lotr,3ajg42,Pyramus6,2,Sun Jun 21 03:14:51 2015 UTC,Hmmm. Denethor's stronger than I thought he was. Actually starting to feel sorry for him.
lotr,3ajg42,1EnTaroAdun1,2,Mon Jun 22 00:52:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying that, that's very interesting. I wonder in what sense Tolkien meant Saruman's will was dominated; was it perhaps his obsession with ring-lore (as the ring is essentially an extension of Sauron), or did Sauron actively and directly dominate Saruman via the palantiri? Your quote seems to suggest the latter, and if this is the case, I'd be interested if you knew of anywhere Tolkien detailed this ""domination"" further."
lotr,3ajg42,12secondcountdown,2,Mon Jun 22 02:30:28 2015 UTC,"An excellent question, and perhaps someone more well-read can clarify (or perhaps correct me). I think in the actual LOTR books, dominion is not really mentioned, and even if it was, Tolkien is a little notorious for frequently changing his mind and revising editions... so for all we know, both assumptions are technically correct.   At any rate, I'll try go into a my light reads. For brevity's sake, I actually cut out a section of the above cited quote that may have answered your question. ""Saruman fell under the domination of Sauron and desired his victory, or no longer opposed it. Denethor remained steadfast in his rejection of Sauron...""  To elaborate more in the Unfinished Tales (in the Hunt for the Ring section), Christopher Tolkien mentions that in earlier JRR versions that, ""it is said that Sauron had at this time [of the Nazgul's hunt for the Ring], by means of the palantiri, at last begun to daunt Saruman, and could in any case often read his thought even when he withheld information. Thus Sauron was aware that Saruman had some guess at the place where the ring was and Saruman actually revealed that he had got as prisoner Gandalf, who knew the most..."" HOWEVER, with all that being said, in later versions of the same story, Saruman rejected the Witch King from entering Isengard after Gandalf escaped. ""His dread was great, for his hope of deceiving Sauron, or at the least receiving favour in his victory, was utterly lost.""  I think, to your credit, that there are numerous Saruman spoken quotes that suggest he was still thinking as his own agent throughout the War of the Ring. The Jackson interpretation (perhaps wrongly) assumes that Saruman instantly became an evil lacky. Personally, I had always thought that though Saruman believed himself to be his own actor, he was in fact deluded-- a controlled puppet, and the rationality that he was so known for was unwittingly turned against him. I think the most interesting thing about Sauron and the Ring's persuasion is that only a couple characters are actually ever conscious that they are being manipulated.   Finally, as a side note, it is also important to realize that as a chief lieutenant of Morgoth, it is possible Sauron had experience in leading other Maiar (like Gothmog did? I may be assuming too much). I'm curious to your thoughts."
lotr,3ajg42,Pyramus6,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:38:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response! I love what you mentioned about only few under Sauron and the Ring's influence being conscious of their situation, and I'm totally on board with the idea that Saruman was deluded into thinking he was his own faction. My understanding is that Saruman thought the best way to surmount the Sauron problem was not to oppose him directly (at least not without the ring), but to allow or even aid his victory against the people of Middle-Earth, and then (ideally, with the other Istari), gain favour and gradually exert influence over Sauron until he himself, as the leader of the Istari, is in control. To this end, Saruman never saw himself as having been manipulated or conquered by Sauron, however, being aware of this intent, Sauron played along for the sole purpose of strengthening his own faction for the time being. It's only in the scene you mentioned with the Witch-King that Saruman realizes his motives were known. As you quoted, ""His dread was great"".  I guess where a little confusion comes in is when we bring up Saruman continuing to desire and search for the ring for his own purposes. Were he truly and completely under Sauron's influence, would his urge not of been to surrender the ring upon its retrieval to Sauron to facilitate his conquest over Middle-Earth? In this case we might say that Saruman was merely manipulated rather than dominated, unless his desire for the ring was another form of Sauron's domination.  As to your last note about Maiar leading Maiar, I would imagine by their semi-divine nature that they cannot be completely dominated or controlled by one another; they each have their own drive, affinities, and beliefs that spur them on. The most effective way to congregate a host of Maiar is to convince them (or manipulate them into believing) that your causes align. Of course, when I speak of domination I refer to unquestioning obedience (such as Sauron's influence over the Nazgul), though I'm sure domination has many definitions, the above manipulation potentially being one."

Sauron was using him, and Saruman had less control over the situation that he believed. He just thought he could win the upper hand by getting the ring."

Edit: Found it in the Silmarillion:   Galadriel indeed had wished that Mithrandir should be the head of the Council, and Saruman begrudged them that, for his pride and desire of mastery was grown great; but Mithrandir refused the office, since he would have no ties and no allegiance, save to those who sent him, and he would abide in no place nor be subject to any summons."

lotr,3ahc1x,zgrove,0,Sat Jun 20 11:59:11 2015 UTC,I guess the question can be interpreted two ways! Whether it means the first time he arrives or the second. I assumed the first because that was the beginning of the story and when Frodo first got involved
lotr,3ahc1x,CptBoomshard,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:56:37 2015 UTC,"I think the confusion definitely comes from thinking he meant after the birthday ""party.""

lotr,3aeonz,DrJanitor01,101,Fri Jun 19 14:46:55 2015 UTC,Sam is the hero of the Lord of the rings forever in my eyes. I will never see frodo as the hero.
lotr,3aeonz,slayer828,55,Fri Jun 19 16:28:01 2015 UTC,"I used to think this, too. But look at Frodo. He's bearing this great burden, that almost no one else could bear. People tend to think Sam could, but I'm not so sure. Using his brief time with it as an indicator isn't really fair, as Frodo had much greater exposure to the ring by that point (17 years, plus a year of it actively trying to wear him down on the journey).  With that out of the way, I think the thing that put Frodo and Sam back on equal footing for me is how they treat Gollum. Sam doesn't quite understand pity and mercy, whereas Frodo really comes to appreciate it and act them out. It was Sam's harsh reaction that finally sealed Gollum's fate, and though he can't be blamed for Gollum's woes he does bear the blame for denying Gollum that one last chance at redemption, and undoing all the good Frodo had been working for Gollum up until then.  Frodo to me seems to have a more noble, refined understanding of what it means to be a good person. A more Christian understanding, if you will, as mercy and forgiveness are very, very Christian virtues (don't misunderstand; of course non-Christians can display these traits). But Frodo doesn't really display this much (outside of Gollum, of course), and can't, as he's fighting the ring the whole way. Sam has a more simple understanding of what it means to be good - love your friends and love them sacrificially. But the reason I say it's more simple is that it's largely directed at his friends, not towards those who seek ill for the people he loves. ( [Luke 6:31-36] ... take it away /u/versebot)  Both are great heroes. Indeed, I don't really see any one character in LotR as being the main protagonist or hero over any of the others, especially when it comes to the fellowship."
lotr,3aeonz,Aexsburg,8,Fri Jun 19 19:37:32 2015 UTC,"Like you said, Sam couldn't carry the ring to the mountain. Tolkien himself basically said this. ""Few others, perhaps no others of his time, would have got so far."" Frodo was the only one who could. Then Eru knocked Gollum into the fires."
lotr,3aeonz,thecody17,2,Sat Jun 20 00:54:28 2015 UTC,"i agree but i also think to myself, would frodo have been so forgiving and merciless toward gollum had gandolf not said anything to him"

lotr,3aeonz,Aexsburg,0,Sat Jun 20 12:06:54 2015 UTC,"Frodo's mercy is spelled-out a direct result of his selfishness; It's a method of proving to himself that he can ""make it back"", too. He specifically and clearly says so in the film, but I don't remember his lines in the book.  Which, given the nature of Christian morality, means your point about his having Christian characteristics is far more valid than you intended."
lotr,3aeonz,ametalshard,2,Fri Jun 19 23:17:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd call it selfishness, but I do agree with your overall point that his motivation for it gives it an even deeper connection to Christian morals; namely, that we ought to forgive others for the small debts owed to us because we've been forgiven a large one."
lotr,3aeonz,Aexsburg,0,Fri Jun 19 23:52:14 2015 UTC,"Well, you are literally being rewarded with the best gift ever for your actions. How can anything be a sacrifice if you get literally the best thing ever for doing it?"

"""
lotr,3aeonz,Aexsburg,-2,Sat Jun 20 01:41:22 2015 UTC,"There are many technical definitions for the word. We were referring to personal sacrifice, a different idea that is as old as sapience itself, co-opted by after-life religions well before the Abrahamic.   Personal sacrifice, or self-sacrifice    acting with less concern for yourself than for the success of the joint activity"
lotr,3aeonz,ametalshard,3,Sat Jun 20 01:56:25 2015 UTC,But even there you're giving up one thing for something deemed of greater importance. It literally has nothing to do with Christian or otherwise religious meanings of sacrifice.  Edit: But I'm not sure what the point of this discussion is; what does it have to do with the topic at hand?
lotr,3aeonz,Aexsburg,20,Sat Jun 20 02:46:59 2015 UTC,Too true. Frodo never would have made it to Mt. Doom with out Sam. He is the real hero of the story.
lotr,3aeonz,TehRealRedbeard,49,Fri Jun 19 17:20:25 2015 UTC,"I see them as both heroes for different themes/ideas present in the book.  Frodo is a hero for taking on the impossible quest for the good of everybody. For giving everything he had for that purpose, maintaining his empathy and acting accordingly along the way to the best of his ability. His is the story of faith, falling short as all men do, and undeserved reward anyway by the grace of God.  Sam is a hero for his steadfast friendship. To quote Sanya from the Dresden Files book Changes: ""[H]e faced far greater and more terrible foes than he ever should have had to face, and did so with courage. That he went alone into a black and terrible land, stormed a dark fortress, and resisted the most terrible temptation of his world for the sake of the friend he loved."" His is the story of friendship and cooperation and mutual support and is the more relatable theme."
lotr,3aeonz,WalkingTarget,7,Fri Jun 19 18:23:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, I definitely see them both as heroes.  One couldn't have made it without the other, I do believe that.

lotr,3afs8a,Westerhoe,8,Fri Jun 19 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"In most places it's 18 or older for alcohol. I remember when I was young it was 16 for beer and wine where I lived.  There was a discussion what the Elves were drinking, in the part where they met Gildor, and it is likely (in my opinion) that it is mead (honey-wine). We know there was wine in Middle-earth, and beer. Mead and wine play an important role in the Norse and Anglo-Saxon mythology Tolkien used as inspiration.   I don't think it is mentioned anywhere that they had distillation in Middle-earth. The tech level in Middle-earth at the time of Frodo was vaguely based on Medieval Europe. Tolkien said that the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicted the time aroud the Norman Invasion, as being ""close enough"" to what the people looked like. In that time they had beer (though not the clear pilsener type we have now), wine, mead, and apparently the Normans were fond of cider (the alcoholic variety, just to make clear). For beer, they would likely drink unfiltered beer, possibly flavored with other things than (just) hops. Something like the Hoegaarden beers maybe. I can't think of any mixed drinks though.  Another thing is that Orcs pour a pungent drink down the Hobbits' throats to keep them going (and burn in their throats). I was thinking of something like Dropshot (a 20% alcohol drink that tastes of salmiaki, most people don't like that), or another liquorice/salmiaki based drink.  Perhaps the Númenoreans knew of distillation once, they certainly seem to have superior tech, some even superior to what we have. And they had herbs on their island, such as Athelas. Maybe a herby drink such as Jägermeister or Beerenburg would be appropriate.  (As you may have noticed, I don't actually know much about cocktails. There are people who drink Beerenburg-beer or Jägermeister-beer though)"

Of course it doesn't have to be something that is available to the technology level of the Hobbits and Elves, but I think many people are going to take it that way.  I have another suggestion. The Gamgee! Since Sam loves taters and ale, put a potatoes based vodka in a pint! The old Gaffer would approve.  And the Farmer Maggot cocktail: something mushroom flavoured.

It doesn't sustain their body or prevent them from needing food or water. Though a wraith wouldn't need these things, if the bearer were to fade.  Both Gollum and Sam made the same trip as Frodo, and reached the Mountain alive. Gollum was even more malnourished by the end, as he was willing to only drink the hobbits water, but refused to eat their elf and man food (provided by gladriel and faramir).   Hobbits are exceptionally durable and hearty. Their survival likely has more to do with that fact than anything else. That being said, I seriously doubt Aragorn would have succumbed had he gone with them."

lotr,3ad7z6,grantishere,36,Fri Jun 19 04:03:09 2015 UTC,"I think it was a combination of the less ""realistic"" style of the films, as well as the changes made to the original story.  Fewer changes were made to lotr."
lotr,3ad7z6,The_Dingman,6,Fri Jun 19 04:08:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I definitely agree with you here. However do you think non lotr fans would have enjoyed the movie if Jackson had stayed true to the story?
lotr,3ad7z6,PotViking,24,Fri Jun 19 04:12:13 2015 UTC,Yes.
lotr,3ad7z6,ebneter,22,Fri Jun 19 04:28:01 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The Hobbit is, after all, one of the best-selling and most-beloved books of the twentieth century. It's not like it's some unknown."
lotr,3ad7z6,DividingPrescott,9,Fri Jun 19 05:39:41 2015 UTC,"If PJ really wanted to appeal more to fans and non-fans alike, he should have done the film closer to the book. The book has a much simpler story. Generally speaking, the simpler the story, the better it flows. What we ended up getting was a bunch of half-assed-executed ideas. The love tri-angle, Legolas and What's-her-name running all the way to gundabad and back in a few hours, the unexplainable and supernatural ""dragon sickness"", the I-hate-you-dad relationship with Thranduil.   I'd say in the end, PJ turned off fans and non-fans alike by making the story bloated and the action so frequent it became mind numbing.   If anything, when I look at the hobbit films, I feel like they are not made for Tolkien fans or non-tolkien fans. I feel like they're made for Peter Jackson Fans. That is, people who really only like the movie for their huge over the top action scenes, their legolas fan services, and Thorin is basically an aragorn clone."
lotr,3ad7z6,ReinierPersoon,5,Fri Jun 19 17:00:48 2015 UTC,"I'm a books over movies person, but I found the LotR trilogy pretty good, even though I don't like all the changes of the book. The main difference is that they turnen a short book into three movies, so they had to fill it up with meaningless action scenes, running Dwarves and Elves, it's just a marathon of them chased by Orcs all the way to Erebor. The dialogue/action ratio is just too low. It's worse in the second and third Hobbit films."
lotr,3ad7z6,Daxtreme,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"I really can't understand how they managed to make the third Hobbit movie feel rushed, after stretching 1 book into 3 movies. You'd think we'd have time for a proper send-off but the action is all over the place and bam, the movie is over after a small shire scene.   What?"
lotr,3ad7z6,ReinierPersoon,2,Fri Jun 19 23:35:25 2015 UTC,"And also putting in a bunch of characters that had no place in the story at all, like that annoying servant of the Master of Laketown, that really added nothing to the story.  Someone posted the amount of dialogue per movie somewhere, and the first movie has substantially more dialogue than the others. I think that is why 2 and 3 sucked more, it was just running around and doing stunts."

What adds insult to injury is that, irrelevant as that character was, it would have been a lot better if the same role in the story had been played by Stephen Fry's character instead."
lotr,3ad7z6,ALLAH_WAS_A_SANDWORM,2,Sat Jun 20 00:58:18 2015 UTC,I think the problem is not just staying true to the story. It might have been possible to take licenses with the original story and make a great Hobbit movie for those who aren't Tolkiendili like us. But the licenses that were taken failed to satisfy anyone.
lotr,3ad7z6,elephant910,28,Sat Jun 20 00:55:40 2015 UTC,Strung out story that didn't stay true to its source material + unrealistic effects that are a result of heavy CGI (instead of real makeup and costumes) = dissatisfied audience.
lotr,3ad7z6,CHAARRGER,6,Fri Jun 19 04:23:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I feel that the CGI was just too much. Here and there is okay but every orc? Despite the orcs being bigger and meaner looking in The Hobbit, they just weren't as gruesome or terrifying."
lotr,3ad7z6,EyeceEyeceBaby,14,Fri Jun 19 04:29:23 2015 UTC,"One of the things I noticed some time ago while re-watching LOTR is the character connections you miss. Things like Aragorn and Eowyn's story that I didn't really pay attention to and then noticed on subsequent viewings. So there is a lot of depth to the characters, as opposed to the dwarves where its ""Oh he's the one with the funny beard"".   I definitely felt how poorly developed things were at the end of the BOTFA where Bilbo is supposed to have this heartfelt farewell and all I could think was ""I don't give a crap about any of you"".  To add on to this I felt like the Hobbit was Peter Jackson unleashed in terms of absolute ridiculousness. This changed it from the character driven story of LOTR to something where Legolas mario jumping up rocks in the most obviously physics-breaking manner possible is deemed theater worthy."
lotr,3ad7z6,CHAARRGER,5,Fri Jun 19 04:26:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree with you on that Legolas scene. I made a comment about it to my dad when we were watching. There is a line between cool and absurd and boy did they cross it.
lotr,3ad7z6,EyeceEyeceBaby,4,Fri Jun 19 04:30:49 2015 UTC,"This scene is constantly cited as something that stuck out to people as out of place and absurd, but I think people forget that Legolas had some just as ridiculous stunts in LotR. Consider the following:   Legolas headshots an orc from way too far Legolas mounts a charging horse without knocking off the other rider Legolas surfs on a shield while firing arrows Legolas mounts an oliphaunt (This entire scene really)   All of these shots (except maybe the shield surfing) had significant CGI components as well, just like the rock jumping so it's not just the difference in the SFX. Legolas' ridiculous antics worked in LotR because the rest of the film was much more real in a sense. It did not work in The Hobbit only because the whole film was riddled with similarly ridiculous or unrealistic CGI shots."
lotr,3ad7z6,OfOneKind90,4,Fri Jun 19 13:48:41 2015 UTC,Oh I don't forget those scenes at all. But like you said those four are pretty much all there is in LOTR. I could start listing 3x that number in the hobbit.
lotr,3ad7z6,CHAARRGER,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:34:18 2015 UTC,"True. My point was really that people tend to single The Hobbit scene out as an example of how they took it too far compared to LotR. I just think the other 100+ shots where CGI was overused to the point that it took you out of the movie are better examples because Legolas in particular is a character that's known for absurd CGI stunts. The reason people single out that scene is not because it's so much worse than anything else. In fact I really think the whole Oliphaunt sequence is at least as bad if not worse. People single it out because it culminates the previous 6+ hours of film during which they were both subtly and overtly at times bombarded with too much CGI (in my opinion at least). I really think if the rest of the films had made use of practical effects and actual sets & locations rather than green screen to the extent that LotR did, people wouldn't be so hard on that one particular shot. In fact they might even view it as a badass Legolas move like the LotR scenes I cited above."
lotr,3ad7z6,CylonSpring,3,Fri Jun 19 15:00:55 2015 UTC,I think skateboarding on a shield  whilst doing a drive by on the uruk-hai was pretty ridiculous as well not to mention the way he manages to kill the Oliphant's . I just enjoy it for what it is. I expected the Hobbit to be filmed in a more childish manner after all it is a child's book. I wasn't disappointed at all!
lotr,3ad7z6,MrThreeFingers,2,Fri Jun 19 13:11:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah here's the thing though, there were a grand total of four stupid stunt scenes in LOTR, and really only one of them imo (the horse mounting scene) looked wrong. The others looked at least possible besides them being total ridiculous. In the Hobbit? Those are a dime a dozen.   Also I can respect people liking the Hobbit, even if I can't really understand it. Taking the movies completely on their own they're still meh movies. They suffer from overlong action scenes, bad dialogue, poor story, and completely ignoring the ""main"" character."
lotr,3ad7z6,Edledhron,10,Fri Jun 19 14:32:48 2015 UTC,"Well for starters, The Hobbit was the slimmest volume in the series, and it was turned into three movies almost equal in duration to the entire LOTR series. That's a tremendous amount of filler.   These films seem to suffer from an over reliance of CGI elements, and while I can appreciate that the targeted audience is much younger, I feel like they missed an opportunity to do a single, character driven film in a similar style to LOTR.   in short, I think the franchise has been milked for the money quite frankly, and that's a bit of a disappointment.    They deserve to make money off the property, but three CGI driven movies is really pushing it."
lotr,3ad7z6,MrThreeFingers,4,Fri Jun 19 04:57:17 2015 UTC,"To sum up my own exp with LotR vs Hobbit from Peter Jackson, LotR deviates only slightly from the books in ways that you can forgive it for being cinematic-ally impressive and coherent. The story was told in basically the exact amount of time it needed to be, and the story was just done WELL. The hobbit on the other hand was done in too many movies. The pacing was terrible. The over-use of terrible CGI made the movie almost un-watchable to certain people.There are two major deviations (tauriel, and the azog arc) that don't really add to the story in any impressive way and really only serve the purpose to make the story last longer, which wouldn't have been an issue if they had just made it one movie. There are probably more that I can't think of. But that sums up my exp with the two trilogies compared side by side."
lotr,3ad7z6,Edledhron,2,Fri Jun 19 08:10:38 2015 UTC,"The LotR deviates fairly significantly from the books. The difference is that the differences are more in the style of removal and details (though sometimes quite major) being changed, rather than additions. If you were to look at the 'skeletons' of the two plots, they would look fairly similar.  The Hobbit films add in significant additions as well as maintaining the sorts of changes that were present in LotR, which made its deviations stand out much more. The skeletons of the films and the book don't much align."
lotr,3ad7z6,MrThreeFingers,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:57:36 2015 UTC,"That's partially my point. Although we differ as to the degree of deviation, we both agree that it can be forgiven for cinematic reasons in LOTR. Whereas we can't do that for the Hobbit."
lotr,3ad7z6,Edledhron,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:56:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think I agree that it can be totally forgiven. I enjoy the LotR movies, and they are great. However, many changes were unnecessary, and Peter Jackson seemed to be more interested in making action blockbusters than staying true to the core of the work."
lotr,3ad7z6,MrThreeFingers,0,Sat Jun 20 19:06:11 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to point out that the movie isn't just for fans of the books though. It's kind of for everyone to enjoy. I have issues with a lot of the deviations, I just enjoy the movies as movies instead of dedicated depictions of the source material. I don't expect Peter Jackson to stay entirely true to the books, nor do I really want him to. If they were to do a GoT style show of LOTR, then I would expect a much more loyal depiction of the books."
lotr,3ad7z6,DARDAN0S,2,Sat Jun 20 19:46:47 2015 UTC,"I think an adaptation that stayed closer to the books would still be quite enjoyable to audiences not familiar with the text. After all, its story has proven immensely popular. And I think they would be better as a movie for being a movie."

Tom Bombadil, while enjoyable to watch for Tolkein fan's would have felt rather disconnected from the flow of the film, and it doesn't really add all that much to the overall plot. Same with the Scouring of the Shire(I was disappointed at it's removal after seeing RotK for the first time in the theatre, but in retrospect, it wouldn't have worked at all.)  I don't have really any issues with the changes in Fellowship or Two Towers (I wouldn't have even minded seeing Arwen show up at Helm's Deep, as was originally planned). The Extended Edition of the Third film is where some things started to actually detract from the film (Gimli in the Paths of the Dead, Mouth of Sauron just didn't fell right).  But overall, I enjoyed RotK just as much -It has some of the best scenes in film history in my opinion- though, If there's one thing I'm disappointed was cut from the books, It's Halbarad and the Grey Company. I think it would have been better if Aragorn had shown up with them and Gondorian reinforcements to the Pelennor fields, like in the books, instead of Deus Ex Ghost Army."
lotr,3ad7z6,DARDAN0S,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:57:53 2015 UTC,"Some thing's just don't translate all that well to film   Why do you feel the need to say this? I'm well aware that books and films are different media, but they aren't so different that a film could not be closer to the original without becoming less enjoyable.   Tom Bombadil, while enjoyable to watch for Tolkein fan's would have felt rather disconnected from the flow of the film, and it doesn't really add all that much to the overall plot   Tom Bombadil isn't the most important figure to keep around if things need to be cut, but on what basis would you say that he would feel 'disconnected from the flow of the film?' I think he would work just fine - a bit of a surprise intrusion, yes, but films have those all the time, often to great effect. A disruption from the flow of Jackson's films specifically? Well, there yes, because Jackson didn't write the sort of films that would allow Bombadil to be present.  And doesn't add much to the overall plot? Well first, in an adventure story, there need to be sights to see, so Bombadil intrinsically adds worth to the plot in that regard. Bombadil's sequence also provides some very important foreshadowing regarding Frodo, gets the daggers to the hobbits (which have a role to play later in the story), and provides some important lessons on the Ring. It's not the most important plot point, and like I said if things need to go - he's a candidate pretty high on the list, but he's a great deal more important to the plot than many of the things Jackson chose to include in his films.   Same with the Scouring of the Shire(I was disappointed at it's removal after seeing RotK for the first time in the theatre, but in retrospect, it wouldn't have worked at all.)   Of course it wouldn't have worked in Jackson's films. Jackson wrote his movies in a way that cut out all importance of the Scouring, would have made it seem like 'just another ending,' and of course did not allow the time for it. However, it not being suitable for Jackson's film does not mean it would not work in any film adaptation.  And you seem to be suggesting that the Scouring does not add much to the overall plot, which I simply find ludicrous. I would even say that it is the most important part of the plot. It's the end of the journey! It's when we see the main characters fully changed for the first time from who they were when they began. It's the way that Tolkien comments on the themes and motifs that have run through the rest of the book, and it's where we see Saruman meet his end. And with the whole point of Frodo's journey being to save the Shire, it has a most dramatic and important impact to have him return to the Shire in that state."
lotr,3ad7z6,2mobile2,3,Fri Jun 26 18:26:20 2015 UTC,It was more a prequel to the LotR movies than it was an adaptation of The Hobbit.  It completely failed to capture the spirit of the book.  It added way too much garbage scenes.

Just like how every 3D movie involving a coal mine also needs a crazy, out of control 3D mineshaft cart rollercoaster scene. So too does each hobbit movie seem to need at least two ""3D coal mine"" bits.  Survive actual stone giants, goblin tunnels escape, wood-elf barrel escape, attack Smaug with molten gold, etc"

lotr,3ad7z6,octopustundra,2,Sat Jun 20 01:01:32 2015 UTC,"You could tell that some serious passion went in to LOTR. Im not saying the Hobbit was half arsed or anything but PJ may have gotten slightly complacent and leaned more towards industry clichés since he no longer had anything to prove.  Also the hobbit is just one very short book, stretched over a very long trilogy, so unlike LOTR where they had to actually cut stuff out from the books to make it fit, in the hobbit they had to make up stuff to fill the 9 hours and thats never going to be as good storytelling as what the original author created.  Theres been a lot of discussion about if making the hobbit a trilogy was a mistake, but the fact is that the story IS quite long. I mean theres a lot of plot, but there isnt much depth. If it had just been one movie it wouldve been very top heavy.  oh yeah and just have to mention that the hobbit used CGI extensively, whereas in LOTR it was used very sparingly and usually to supplement practical effects, so that definitely also gives the hobbit a bit of a made in china feel in comparison to LOTR"

Adding her as a character was fine, but much of the time she felt too much like an object.  There was more, most of which had to do with lack of agreement with the book.  The part with the spiders, for example, was so wrong."

Then came the second one; the barrel-rider scene is what killed it for me. The sequence is already pretty ridiculous with all the barrels rolling around through the water and the land, and it happens OVER AND OVER again for I think ten minutes or so. What made it even worse was that I think that scene contains the worst CGI I've seen in a film of a budget this size. It was ridiculous. Then the third movie came and it felt to me like a bloated excuse to have a big epic final battle as opposed to actually finishing the saga (the title change from There and Back Again to Battle of the Five Armies makes me feel this even more). I didn't find myself getting attached to any of the characters whatsoever, Legolas essentially became God in how disproportionately physics-bending every action scene he's in is, and overall the whole thing just felt half-assed and boring."

lotr,3ad7z6,Uluithiad,0,Sat Jun 20 23:48:29 2015 UTC,I think The Hobbit would stand alone as a very good movie but with the bar set for LOTR it just missed in some key places. Over use of CGI was probably the biggest in comparison. I do think that book readers were able to look past plot changes in the original much easier though. If the Hobbit used less CGI and stayed true to make up and real sets the actual plot would not be as bad as people make it out to be. How easy people forget the army of the dead cheat code in ROTK. Pretty big plot difference IMO but nobody cares too much about that in retrospective. It's like Star Wars I II III but not near as bad.

Now I go to Pelargir upon Anduin, and ye shall come after me. And when this land is clean of the servants of Sauron, I will hold the oath fulfilled, and ye shall have peace and depart for ever. For I am Elessar, Isildur's heir of Gonder."" ... (skipping a bit more text) The Company camped by the Stone, but they slept little, because of the dread of the Shadows that hedged them round.

This is their job in the movies: complete and utter annihilation of the host of Mordor that came to besiege Minas Tirith. This is something wholly incompatible with them from the books.  This is why the previous poster mentioned them as the 'army of the dead cheat code'. He is not referencing the fact that there were some people who were dead and bound to service under the White Mountains that Aragorn came, called, and released from their oath.

Er meaning ""one"" or ""only"" and corma meaning ""ring.""   And what about the seven rings and the nine rings? As far as I know all the seven rings are identical, as well as the nine rings.   None of these are named either (or at least we can say Tolkien never gave us the names). Actually all 16 of the rings were pretty much identical in their power and purpose.   Do you guys know anything more about them? Names or looks?   The majority of what we know about the Rings regards their purpose and powers. Sauron desired to use them as a means of subjugating the elves, though when that fell through he used them on Men and Dwarves. Their power was to preserve and enhance the natural abilities of the wearer.  Also, only 16 Rings were forged in conjunction with Sauron: the Nine and the Seven. The One was forged by Sauron alone, and the Three were forged by Celebrimbor alone.  As for the three named rings we do know a bit more about them:   Narya: The Ring of Fire. Held a ruby. Given to Gil-galad, then Cirdan, and finally Gandalf. Nenya: The Ring of Water. Made of mithril, held a white stone. Given to Galadriel. Vilya: The Ring of Air. Gold with a sapphire. Given to Gil-galad, then Elrond."
lotr,3ab8qp,EyeceEyeceBaby,3,Thu Jun 18 18:35:44 2015 UTC,"I believe it would be something along the lines of ""Ercorma"" or ""Er Corma."" Er meaning ""one"" or ""only"" and corma meaning ""ring.""   Yes, er is ""one"" in the sense of ""single, alone"" whereas min is ""one"" as in ""first in a series"". As for syntax, Tolkien wrote on a 1969 note (VT49:45) that ""numerals follow the noun, except er [1] which is indeclinable. The noun is indeclinable in that case before atta, which takes sg. inflexion. (Only in O[ld] Q[uenya] is dual inflexion preserved.) 'Of 2 stars' would be elen atto. From nelde 3 onwards: (a) Noun is in gen[itive] pl. and numerals inflect as sg. noun or [(b)] later noun is declined and numerals indeclinable. {for ""3 stars""} [(a)] elenion nelde or [(b)] eleni nelde. 'Of 3 stars' = [(a)] elenion neldeo or [(b)] elenion nelde.""  According to that paradigm, it seems we'd have Er Corma - though we do see Eru Er ""one God"" in his 1950s translation of the Litany of Loreto. As a compound, though, it would be Ercorma anyway.  As for ""Ring"", we would assume that corma would be used, like in Cormacolindor and Cormarë. However, there are two attested translations of ""Lord of the Rings"" by Tolkien into Quenya. The first is Heru i·Million (mentioned in PE10:46, without information on its dating), and the second is i Túrin i Cormaron from a mid-1973 letter. So Er Corma should be fine."

""The Nine, the Seven, and the Three"", he said, ""had each their proper gem. Not so the One. It was round and unadorned, as it were one of the lesser rings; but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled, maybe, could still see and read."" [The Fellowship of the Ring]   Vilya was a Gold ring set with a blue stone (likely Sapphire). Nenya was mithril and set with a white stone (adamant/diamond). Narya is set with a red gem (Ruby).  The 7 given to the dwarves were made of gold, though we don't know which gems.   that the foundation of each of the Seven Hoards of the Dwarf-kings of old was a golden ring.""   Not much is known about the Rings that would become the 9 either, but they would be very similar to the 7 in composition. The 9 and 7 are not inherently different from one another, the distinguishing thing only being who they were given to (Dwarf or Man).  The phrase ""proper gem"" I find very interesting though. Why not just say each had a gem? This implies the gems do have significance, and it certainly wouldn't be unique to Tolkien if different gems had different supernatural properties.  This is a great thread on the topic of the Rings and ""proper gem"" issue as well: http://www.lotrplaza.com/showthread.php?11956-Had-each-their-proper-gem&s=d9f041e2bdb802a9d0ddbe13f3aeada3"

This implies the gems do have significance, and it certainly wouldn't be unique to Tolkien if different gems had different supernatural properties.   I like to think that, while the Seven and Nine had similar purposes, the Elves really weren't much for assembly line work. I imagine that by the time true Rings of Power are being created, there are inherent differences just due to the qualities/whims of the craftsmen - maybe not enough to set them apart from one another in terms of ""power"" but enough that you could tell them apart from one another while the ""lesser Rings"" might not be distinguished from one another as much."

lotr,3ab8qp,MagnusRune,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:11:22 2015 UTC,"The 3 are special in that Sauron never touched them or tainted them.   The 7 and the 9 were the same type of magic ring. All corrupted, but not different in their make or design or purpose.    ""Sauron gathered into his hands all the remaining Rings of Power; and he dealt them out. ... Seven rings he gave to the Dwarves; but to Men he gave nine, for Men proved in this matter as in others the readiest to his will.”   The powers of the rings would have been the same... but the effect that they had on the bearer, or what the bearers did with them is what is different.  Men, who feared death and desired power, used them and were enslaved to saurons will, and through the ring's preservation power, they faded to shadows. They became the ring wraiths.   The dwarves on the other hand could not be dominated by Sauron in the same way. It is believed that the rings only had the effect of making them greedier, or long more for gold.    “Of this Ring something may be said here. … For the Dwarves had proved untameable by this means. The only power over them that the Rings wielded was to inflame their hearts with a greed of gold and precious things. … Though they could be slain or broken, they could not be reduced to shadows enslaved to another will; and for the same reason their lives were not affected by any Ring, to live either longer or shorter because of it.”    It is believed, amongst the dwarves, that Sauron did not manage to touch Durin's ring, and rather it was delivered directly to Durin from the elves, and is therefor less tainted. But, Tolkien states that Sauron's evil will was definitely still in it, as he took a part in the crafting of all 7, even if he didn't physically touch it. So it's still not like the 3 which were not evil (though their bearers would still be ruled by the one ring if it made it back onto sauron's finger)."

lotr,3a5y8x,cold_in_the_summer,69,Wed Jun 17 16:48:33 2015 UTC,"Okay let's talk about Legolas. Way back when as an adolescence in middle school I developed a crush on Legolas. My parents responded with this by obtaining and gifting for my birthday a poster of Legolas that I stuck to the ceiling in my room. He was the last face I saw before going to sleep and the first face to greet me in the morning. But such happiness was not to last. My younger brother accused me of tearing a corner of his Dragon Ball Z poster. He didn't believe I was innocent. For revenge he disgraced Legolas' face. (drew a hitler stash) I tried to wipe it off but it was imperishable. Legolas stayed on my ceiling for another year after that incident. He wasn't the same and neither was I. I found myself facing away from him. I would shut my eyes for the pain of seeing his disfigured face, how I failed to protect him was too much for me to bear. One morning he startled me. I avoided him so much that I actually forgot he was there. I knew then it was time. A decade passed. Had a baby. Got married. Walked into a church owned thrift store. Gazing through the bargains. That's when I saw him. Right next to a painted portrait of a black Jesus, was Legolas. As I want to remember him, no mustache, handsome, framed, and with love in his eyes. I was with my husband. He looked at me as I looked at him and I told him our story. One week later Legolas came back to me again after so many years. There he was hanging on the wall next to my side of the bed staring into my soul and tickling my insides. Legolas returned to me with the help of my husband on my birthday. It's been a year since we've been reunited. Every night with my child's night light luminating through the hallway and into our bedroom. I turn and gaze once more onto Legloas' face. And whisper.....goodnight."

One day at my friends house her dad was watching it and I saw Legolas for the first time. Addicted. Only watched the movie for Orlando Bloom and thus my obsession began (posters, memorabilia etc....) Eventually as the second movie was released I realized the movies were bad-ass, but my love for Legolas never faded. My next realization as I grew older was that Orlando was a pretty shitty actor and I was simply blinded by hormones...but man,even as a 24 year old all of that ten-year-old squeally-omg-he's-the-cutest all comes screaming back when I watch those movies."

There is no story arc for him, he is just the person walking a step behind Aragorn to fill up the screen. There are only so many ways you can say ""they are taking the Hobbits to Isengard"".  Boromir on the other hand doesn't have that much screen time, but he has an actual story arc. He wants to save Gondor, he wants to use the Ring to achieve it, is told the Ring must be destroyed, he goes along with that, is corrupted by the desire for the Ring, attacks Frodo. And then he even redeems himself by sacrificing himself to protect the Hobbits. That is a real role, and together with Theoden one of the best parts of the trilogy for me.  I don't think who played Legolas would have any difference, it's just that the movie-Legolas doesn't have much of a story."
lotr,3a5y8x,Zombiebelle,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:27:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with you as far as LOTR goes. He definitely didn't have a whole lot going on. But maybe what I should have said was generic? And this is obvs just my opinion, no offense to anyone. I was so caught up in my teenage angst that when I watched POTC or any other role he was in I thought he was amazing and ""ooooo look how cute he is"". I just realized as I grew up that he didn't really have a wow factor, he was just an okay actor with a good face."
lotr,3a5y8x,RESERVA42,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:59:27 2015 UTC,"I think part of it is he gets typecast with somewhat boring, ""straight man"" (in a story sense) roles. He played a good guy in Pirates to contrast with the more shady and weird Captain Jack.  I think for men he is more a normal, friendly-looking dude that they can identify with. We see the Pirates world sort of through his eyes at first, same with Kingdom of Heaven, he's just an everyday bloke who gets involved in things.  And is't Jack Sparrow better looking? I'm a guy and even I think Depp looks good."

lotr,3a8q6n,urukhai434,9,Thu Jun 18 23:50:52 2015 UTC,"time is counted on several levels. Days are marked by the rising and setting of the sun, nights are the period of time between the setting and the rising of the sun. Seasons are the gradual change in the outdoor environment from hot, to less hot and more rainy, to cold, to less cold and more rainy, and back to hot. Seasons can vary by your location on the earth. Depending on the season the days may be longer and the nights shorter, or vice versa. A set of 365 days is called a ""year"". Every 365 days the Earth will be in the same position and tilt relative to the sun as it was during the previous set of 365 days.  2000 sets of 365 day years have occurred since Isildur defeated Sauron, or roughly 730,000 rises and settings of the sun, give or take up to 364 more or less depending on time of the year.   The real answer is that a lot of stuff went down in between and it takes time for the big enemies of Tolkien's world to recoup power and make another go at it. And it was many more years than just 2000."

Gil-Galad and Elendil died defeating Sauron, and Isildur cut the ring from Sauron's finger.  That distinction is made several times, I believe in the Appendix and in Gandalf's narrative."
lotr,3a8q6n,Seafroggys,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:17:49 2015 UTC,"From just the passage in LotR, it isn't clear at all. We know Gil-galad and Elendil died fighting Sauron, but we don't know if Isildur took part or was just nearby when Sauron fell. At least not from the Council of Elrond chapter. Also don't have books with me though.  We know at least that the movie version is incorrect."
lotr,3a8q6n,ReinierPersoon,2,Thu Jun 18 20:23:48 2015 UTC,"Fellowship:   I was at the Battle of Dagorlad before the Black Gate of Mordor, where we had the mastery: for the Spear of Gil-galad and the Sword of Elendil, Aiglos and Narsil, none could withstand. I beheld the last combat on the slopes of Orodruin, where Gil-galad died, and Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath him; but Sauron himself was overthrown, and Isildur cut the Ring from his hand with the hilt-shard of his father's sword, and took it for his own.'"
lotr,3a8q6n,AmbiguousAnonymous,2,Sat Jun 20 13:49:20 2015 UTC,"It doesn't say Isildur fought Sauron, but it also doesn't say he didn't. Somehow I always assumed it was the three of them fighting Sauron, and Isildur cut off the Ring since he was the only one left standing. But it could also be it was just Gil-galad and Elendil and Isildur was just nearby and later cut off the Ring."
lotr,3a8q6n,ReinierPersoon,2,Sat Jun 20 15:35:23 2015 UTC,"Because the events of the book happen in TA 3000-ish. (not going to be exact for this explanation, if you would like to be exact, then you may search for it yourself, no offense meant.) The Third Age was ushered in when Sauron was defeated. Making the day of his defeat TA 01, and the day before, the last day of the Second Age. SA....something or other. Thus, in the lore of the story about 3000 years occurred between the FIRST defeat of Sauron and the events of The Fellowship of the Ring. To put this in a little more perspective, Gollum had the ring for about 800(?) years I believe and thus the ring has been lost for some time before he ever found it. I hope this helps, and would love to have any errors corrected if there are any."
lotr,3a8q6n,MrThreeFingers,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:30:47 2015 UTC,I think Gollum had the Ring for about 500 years.

lotr,3a8q6n,Nurgler,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:56:37 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you are wondering why Elrond was there, when it happened so long ago? The Elves are immortal, they can be killed or die from grief, but they have no natural end of their lifespan. People like Elrond and Galadriel and Celeborn have been around long before Sauron was defeated, some 3000 years before the movie starts."

lotr,3a594a,Keeper-of-Balance,3,Wed Jun 17 10:18:54 2015 UTC,"Better late than never, I suppose! I've never understood how people can make fun of something when they have no idea what it's about."
lotr,3a594a,ToffeeKing,2,Wed Jun 17 12:27:08 2015 UTC,"Its far easier to make fun of something when you don't know what its about. Not knowing the complexities of something let's you focus on the superficial and that is usually the easiest to make fun of. It happens for all sorts of things too.  For example, when the Superbowl is coming up notice how many people say things like ""Sportsketball"" or some other nonsense. People who don't watch football will make fun of it because to them it is a simple game about running a ball around and they don't have a real concept of the intricacies of the sport that allow the players to do this.   Likewise, its very easy to make fun of someone for reading a book about ""Elves and wizards"", drawing upon the cultural perception of childhood fairy tales. It is far hard to make fun of someone for reading a book about a complex journey about the darkest days of a world, struggling to overcome the evil that is all but assured to destroy them.  The truth is we all do it to. There's almost certainly something you make fun of without truly having a full concept of it. We know that its wrong on some level, but its easy to slip into."
lotr,3a594a,CambrianExplosives,2,Thu Jun 18 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"Most people in my country don't know what the Superbowl is, but I see what you're saying though I can't really relate to it. I'm very careful about dealing out judgement (not even the very wise can see all ends, right?) and if I encounter something I find strange or just silly I'd rather seek to learn more and understand its appeal than try and make fun of what I simply know too little about. This goes for pretty much anything from taste in film and music to religious and political views. One example: a good male friend in his early 20s told me he'd really been getting into My Little Pony a while back. Rather than mocking him for watching a show aimed at little girls, I watched the first two seasons and recognised that it could well appeal to anyone who gave it a chance. But this is pretty far from lotr."
lotr,3a594a,ToffeeKing,2,Thu Jun 18 20:52:26 2015 UTC,That is definitely the correct way to treat things and I admire your ability to do that and recognize the need for it.

One thing that kind of stuck out to me was how Bilbo was not as prominent as I thought he would be considering he is the main character in the movies.  I distinctly remember feeling surprised by the almost ""minor"" role he had in the 2nd and 3rd films considering the story is really about him.  The graph seems to represent this quite well.  In the 2nd movie he is only 3rd in dialog, and not a significant first in the third movie.  This is highly unique as how many movies can you think of where the protagonist does not have the majority of the lines (and an overwhelming majority at that)?"

Their primary language was Westron, derived from Adûnaic. The more learned among them would have spoken Sindarin, but it was hardly the vernacular. That said, a number of Gondorian Kings did have epithets, though not always in the form of an adjective/descriptor following the name. Rather they would simply become known by the new epithet instead, dropping their given name. Here are a few examples:   Tarostar, the eighth King, changed his name to Rómendacil (""East-victor"") 8 years into his reign after defeating Easterling invaders. Tarannon, the twelfth King, added Falastur (""Lord of the Coasts"") upon ascension to the throne to commemorate his victories along the coasts. Ciryaher, the fifteenth King, changed his name to Hyarmendacil (""South-victor"") after his defeat of the Haradrim. Atanatar II, the sixteenth King, had the epithet ""Alcarin"" (Glorious). Presumably because of love of jewels and luxury. Minalcar, the nineteenth King, changed his name to Rómendacil II after defeating yet another group of Easterlings. Castamir, the twenty-second King, was given the epithet ""the Usurper"" for his role in the civil war. Telumehtar, the twenty-eighth King, took the epithet Umbardacil (""Umbar-victor"") for his victory of the Corsairs.   As far as I'm aware the Kings of Arnor never were known by any form of epithet. I've got no information regarding common people using epithets."

I find (and so do most fans) that they get the enjoyment from the books through the way J.R.R Tolkien is able to build an amazing world and go into immense detail. Most people tend to not like this and that is why this article has been made.  I think that if you do not enjoy world building and descriptive writing then maybe LOTR is not the books for you. The vastness of Middle Earth is what I love so much and is why I personally love the detail that J.R.R Tolkien goes into.

He was not the best storyteller though, and much of book one is very uninteresting, even in a worldbuilding sense as they wander through a forest and another forest, meet a hobbit, more forest and then Tom which I feel kinda meh about.

(I actually do have a primary reddit account, but I'm trying to keep my old handle and this one separate.)  On my first read-through, I was absolutely absorbed by the world. I love language and history and have been creating my own conlangs and conscripts since I was young. LotR was definitely a book for me. The story was pretty much everything I wanted.  Hell, all four of my tattoos are LotR-themed.   My inspiration for writing the original guide was for all the friends and people I've met who find out I love LotR and proceed to tell me they could never get into the books. The more people who told me this, the more I started to ask questions... and the more I started to discover that a vast majority get lost/bored/bogged down in the Old Forest.   In writing the blog post, I wanted to give a shot to people who wanted to like LotR but had never quite been able to manage the books.

lotr,39vtt3,Tyranniac,2,Mon Jun 15 22:21:11 2015 UTC,"I still think they also messed up a lot in the first one, the weird reluctance of the Dwarves to go to Rivendell and the hate between Elves and Dwarves was overdone. The Elves fought each other much more than they fought with the Dwarves, and the confrontation with the Mirkwood Elves had not yet happened.  The War of Dwarves and Orcs also made no sense, since the casus belli was the killing of Thrór, while in the movie he was killed during the war. They could have just told the real story without changing it, I think if they told the story the way it was told in the appendices it would be better. And it would include Durin's Bane, since Dáin senses it when he looks inside Moria. Good way to include Dáin in the first movie too."

lotr,39ywxw,EyeceEyeceBaby,3,Tue Jun 16 12:30:27 2015 UTC,"Sauron loved order. He wasn't a nihilist. He simply wanted control. To achieve such a goal, he needed to defeat anyone who wouldn't submit, but if a nation would willingly be subjugated then he wasn't about to expend time and energy destroying them. Destruction breeds chaos not order. I think enslave is a bit too specific a word to use. For instance, I wouldn't necessarily use the word ""enslaved"" to describe the denizens of the Third Reich, perhaps subjugated or dominated would be a more fitting term. And yes, the Fourth Age brought the  final waning and departure of the Elves as well as the dominion of Men. Also, it wasn't specifically after the fall of Sauron. The more relevant event was the departure of the keepers of the Three Rings two years after Sauron's defeat, symbolizing the end of the preservation of the Elven kingdoms."
lotr,39ywxw,Leftys-Wheelchair,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:09:56 2015 UTC,"Is there any writing of what happened after the departure of the elves?   So of course Aragorn reigned for close to 100 years or something right? Or he at least lived to 120-130 while ruling for 40-50 years or so? But what after? Did he have a son who followed in ruling? What ever happened to places like Mirkwood, Rivendell, LothLorien? Were they just taken over by man? They couldn't have been could they? Or did they just age with the surroundings and end up like that ruin Arwen saw during that time she was leaving?"
lotr,39ywxw,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Tue Jun 16 14:16:09 2015 UTC,"Well the Appendices are a good place to start. Appendix B gives a detailed chronology that ends in F.A. 120 with the passing of Aragorn and the departure of Legolas and Gimli. Aragorn ruled for 122 years and was succeeded by his son Eldarion. Mirkwood and Lothlorien initially expanded into southern Mirkwood under Thranduil and Celeborn, but like all elves their inhabitants either faded or departed eventually. In F.A. 121 Arwen gave up her life (died of grief) in Lorien upon Cerin Amroth where she and Aragorn had previously plighted their troth.   I can speculate to answer the rest of your questions. A similar fate must have occurred in Rivendell, though we don't have much explicit information. It's reasonable to assume that the Beornings and the men of Dale would have gained dominion over Mirkwood. I imagine Lothlorien would have remained empty at least for awhile, given the negative stigma men had of it (thinking of Eomer's comments on Galadriel). Eventually, however, every place would have been inhabited by men. After all Tolkien created Middle-Earth as a mythological history of the current world, and I haven't seen any elves lately!"

lotr,39ywxw,SyntheticGod8,2,Mon Jun 15 22:34:18 2015 UTC,"I'll also add that the humans who allied with Sauron also really hated Gondor. So there's a few strong factors: an offer to attack their long time enemy with massive backup from Mordor, promises of resources, power, and magic, threats that include magical retaliation, and probably a good deal of political manipulation to make it all palitable."
lotr,39ywxw,MRdaBakkle,2,Wed Jun 17 23:49:16 2015 UTC,"To be clear between the time of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings there was a huge civil war going on in the east between those evil men loyal to Sauron and the Shadow, and the free people of Rhun. Thanks to the efforts of the two Blue Wizards in the East it would have been worse for the rest of the free peoples. Not everyone supported the shadow in the east and south, and the wizards were able to cripple those that did support Sauron."

lotr,39xpx1,EyeceEyeceBaby,-2,Mon Jun 15 18:19:12 2015 UTC,"I think the only way I could put it is that, in the way he delivered his lines, it felt like he was really trying to act. It almost felt like he was reading off a script. And I know everything I said is the very definition of acting, but if I could compare it to say Ian McKellen, who in those moments doesn't seem like someone trying to portray Gandalf, but instead IS Gandalf... then Biblo's lines almost seem out of place in comparison.  If perhaps you watched it having heard what I said, maybe you could pick something up. Possibly not though, I might just be nit-picking. That's why I wanted to hear others' opinions."
lotr,39xpx1,EyeceEyeceBaby,8,Mon Jun 15 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"Ah, well I suppose I'd have to rewatch and try to look for it, but to go off what you're describing it seems to me that it fits Bilbo's character. Bilbo is a bit of an oddity. He's 111 years old after all, he is out of place. The only reason he's as spry and active (and perhaps alive) as he is is because of the Ring. If the character is unnatural, perhaps it makes sense that the portrayal is equally so.  Just a different way to look at it. Again I would need to watch them again to see if I pick up on what you're referring to."
lotr,39xpx1,batholith,2,Mon Jun 15 18:40:51 2015 UTC,"That's probably the best way of looking at it, definitely better than saying that there could be something wrong with the movie. I guess it was just a shocking thing to find myself feeling, as I had never thought that before. Once again, reddit comes through. Thanks mate :)  Edit: Now that I think about it, having seen a different portrayal through Martin Freeman must have thrown me off. I had watched the Hobbit more recently, and it makes sense considering Bilbo was the only one I thought was odd."
lotr,39xpx1,ReinierPersoon,2,Mon Jun 15 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with you! I think the parts that OP is talking is at the Party, where Bilbo is 'acting' himself.  In the case of the party, he knows he is leaving. And he also knows that he is the weirdest guy in the Shire. He is trying to be so nice, to be so outgoing. He is trying so hard to be a social butterfly around the hobbits that call him queer behind his back."
lotr,39xpx1,ReinierPersoon,7,Tue Jun 16 03:04:15 2015 UTC,"I liked movie-Bilbo and how Ian Holm did it, but I think he was too old. Bilbo clearly looked much younger as he still had the Ring, he should have looked like a Hobbit that is 50, as should Frodo by the time he left the Shire. Since Hobbits are adults by 33 (in their opinion), 50 should look like a human of 40 (speculation)?"
lotr,39xpx1,ReinierPersoon,3,Mon Jun 15 17:43:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, I guess it could be said that he was a bit old. Although, It's also a bit harder to make a believable transformation to really old like they had to do with Bilbo in the movies when the actor is younger. Especially since they used make-up back then instead of the CGI like they do now.  I was more concerned with his acting though. When I watched it I felt like he was really trying to act, whereas the rest of the characters feel much more natural."
lotr,39xpx1,Uluithiad,2,Mon Jun 15 17:49:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't feel that way, but then I don't know much about acting. I can also be that because they took some of the dialogue directly from the book, that it may appear somewhat strange to modern viewers, since a lot of it may have been written before and during WW2.  I have that feeling with Shakespeare, regardless of who the actor is it doesn't sound natural, the actors are basically reciting an old poem.  I tried watching the film Richard III (with Ian McKellen) which was set in WW2, but used the Shakespeare dialogue directly. I found it just so unnatural, but that is just the style of the original work."
lotr,39xpx1,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:25:07 2015 UTC,"It could be, I wouldn't be surprised. It's just that I don't feel that way about any of the other characters, many of who have lines lifted from the book. I don't know, it just felt to me that he was really trying to act as Bilbo, whereas the other characters felt so natural. I might just be going crazy though.

lotr,39xpx1,ReinierPersoon,5,Mon Jun 15 18:42:06 2015 UTC,"For a few seconds in a single scene? It wouldn't have been hard to make a younger actor look old. That's done all the time, sometimes even well."
lotr,39xpx1,ebneter,2,Mon Jun 15 17:59:59 2015 UTC,"I just mean, the older a person is, the closer you can get to how they will actually look when they are older, and thus a more realistic interpretation. Not saying they couldn't do it, just trying to give an idea of why they may have used an older looking Bilbo. It's all speculation mate.  Edit: and I never said it would be hard, I said harder. You should be aware of comparatives vs absolutes."
lotr,39xpx1,AmbiguousAnonymous,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:14:11 2015 UTC,"I think they just ignored that Bilbo hadn't aged, or have a different view of what a 50 year old Hobbit should look like."

lotr,39xpx1,Deanonator,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:37:36 2015 UTC,"You are right there, but the slow aging was very noticable.

Easterlings come from north east of Mordor while Haradrim come from the south. The men who were in the scene riding the Mumak were Haradrim. They usually get clumped together but are different armies. Khand is also it's own separate entity, though they're all allies of Sauron.

It is not derived from Elvish, though. This is easy to see if you compare the two languages - while High Elvish (Quenya) influence can easily be seen in Sylvan Elvish (Sindarin) and even Numenorian, the Black Speech shares no common patterns with it (e.g. it doesn't use the ""ng"" combination or any equivalent thereof)."

lotr,39u6dm,sandbrah,37,Sun Jun 14 20:24:10 2015 UTC,IIRC he never touches the ring or the chain in the books.
lotr,39u6dm,mirkwoodfalcon,12,Sun Jun 14 20:33:58 2015 UTC,"Even if he had, there's gotta be some kind of rules, right?  I mean, Isildur was a ringbearer, and I don't think he would deserve any sort of reward. For that matter, Sauron was one too."
lotr,39u6dm,AmishAvenger,10,Sun Jun 14 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe it was because Frodo, Sam, and Bilbo all bore the ring with good intentions. Bilbo had it and only used it for small things when he needed to hide, and Frodo and Sam were taking it to be destroyed. Whereas Boromir and Isildur wanted it out of greed, and Sauron wanted to take over middle earth."
lotr,39u6dm,G-I-N-G-Y,15,Sun Jun 14 21:09:47 2015 UTC,"Boromir did not want the ring out of greed, but rather to protect his people. He did not seek power, he only sought protection. His people had been dying at the hands of Sauron's army, and was desperate to save them."
lotr,39u6dm,Not_Without_My_Balls,13,Sun Jun 14 21:41:48 2015 UTC,"However, he still had different intentions than the Hobbits. Yes, he wanted to use the Ring against Sauron (which we all know would be futile), but he was still seduced by its power and tried to take it forcibly."
lotr,39u6dm,TailorMoon,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:11:55 2015 UTC,"""The ring is mine"" =\= good intentions, Frodo was ultimately corrupted almost the same as Boromir, ironically it was Smeagol who made the difference"
lotr,39u6dm,maxgoldbergonline,2,Sun Jun 14 23:38:15 2015 UTC,I was mostly thinking about everything leading up to Mount Doom. Like how he volunteers to take the ring even though he has no clue where to go
lotr,39u6dm,G-I-N-G-Y,6,Mon Jun 15 00:32:30 2015 UTC,"Isildur was a ringbearer, and I don't think he would deserve any sort of reward   Why not, what's wrong with Isildur? A lifetime of bravery and good deeds is erased because he watched his father get killed and then made a single bad decision?"
lotr,39u6dm,Alzadar,-4,Sun Jun 14 21:59:03 2015 UTC,How many additional deaths was that one decision the cause of?
lotr,39u6dm,AmbiguousAnonymous,11,Sun Jun 14 22:41:55 2015 UTC,"Isildur didn't know that would happen, no one did. Cirdan and Elrond might have advised destroying the Ring to be safe, but they didn't know. This is like holding the Vienna Art Academy responsible for World War II."
lotr,39u6dm,Alzadar,-3,Sun Jun 14 22:53:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe so, but in a tale where pure good and evil exist, it seems clear cut to get rid of the evil artifact.  And its not like his good is ""erased,"" he just simply wasn't good enough to earn the Undying Lands.  There are many other great men too, and while he did the deed and cut the ring I think Tolkien very intentionally gave him the death he deserved for not destroying it.  Beyond that he is free to join the fate of the rest of his kindred."
lotr,39u6dm,AmbiguousAnonymous,3,Sun Jun 14 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that there's no real reason for Isildur to even want to go to Valinor. No one else would get to go with him; Elrond would want to stay, Gil-galad is in Mandos, and he has his sons to look after."
lotr,39u6dm,humblepudding1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:13:22 2015 UTC,"Do we know Gil-galad is still in the Halls of Mandos? He could have reincarnated and stayed in Valinor for all we know.  In the hypothetical situation Isildur was alive when the Ring was destroyed, maybe they would have allowed him to travel to Valinor to heal of the hurt the Ring has inflicted on him, before he died a natural death. He has certainly earned it in my opinion by killing Sauron. Of course, you could see the ""weregild excuse"" in a similar vein that everyone who owns the Ring makes up a reason why they should own it and not someone else."
lotr,39u6dm,ReinierPersoon,2,Mon Jun 15 19:11:55 2015 UTC,"I doubt he would have been reincarnated within Isildur's lifetime. I know its iffy on canon, but look how long it took Glorfindel to come back.  I thought Elendil and GG killed Sauron? Or did Isildur finish him off? Even so, he probably deserves to have it more than anyone else. Or at least, his excuse is the best."
lotr,39u6dm,humblepudding1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:13:36 2015 UTC,"Movie/Book Difference.  Gil-Galad and Elendil killed Sauron, Isildur just cut the ring from his hand.  In the movie, Elendil is just killed by Sauron like a little bitch, and Isildur cuts the ring from his hand, which simultaneously kills him."
lotr,39u6dm,Seafroggys,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"Which just goes to show he didn't ""bear"" the ring in the same capacity as those who actually went to Valinor.  The Nazgul wouldn't have wanted to go to Valinor because the ring had fully corrupted them.  Frodo, Bilbo, and Sam experienced the actual burden of actively resisting the ring.  Does that make sense?"

lotr,39u6dm,humblepudding1,0,Mon Jun 15 16:56:04 2015 UTC,"You're blaming Isildur for his moment in the Samath Naur when he refuses to destroy the ring- but that never happens in the books.  He is never in the Samath Naur, no one advises him to destroy the ring (possibly no one knows at this time how to destroy it), and he takes the ring as weregild for his father, not out of selfishness."
lotr,39u6dm,fileg,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:03:19 2015 UTC,"No I'm not basing it on the movies, thank you very much.  I'm basing it on the text.  How about you?   The Ruling Ring passed out of the knowledge even of the Wise in that age; yet it was not unmade. For Isildur would not surrender it to Elrond and Círdan who stood by. They counselled him to cast it into the fire of Orodruin nigh at hand, in which it had been forged, so that it should perish, and the power of Sauron be for ever diminished, and he should remain only as a shadow of malice in the wilderness. But Isildur refused this counsel, saying: ‘This I will have as were-gild for my father's death, and my brothers. Was it not I that dealt the Enemy his death-blow?' And the Ring that he held seemed to him exceedingly fair to look on; and he would not suffer it to be destroyed."
lotr,39u6dm,AmbiguousAnonymous,2,Mon Jun 15 10:51:14 2015 UTC,"To be fair, pretty much no one would have the ability to cast the Ring into the fire when they were so close to Mount Doom."

lotr,39u6dm,fileg,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:08:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, this quote is from the Silmarillion.  Canon gets tricky, but I take the Silmarillion as canon.  There are plenty of debatable things in it but without it we have a completely different view of the Undying Lands and the nature of this thread becomes much more vague.  However, we don't need the Silmarillion.  Here is an excerpt from Fellowship:   ""Alas! yes,"" said Elrond. `Isildur took it, as should not have been. It should have been cast then into Orodruin's fire nigh at hand where it was made. But few marked what Isildur did. He alone stood by his father in that last mortal contest; and by Gil-galad only Círdan stood, and I. But Isildur would not listen to our counsel.  ' ""This I will have as weregild for my father, and my brother,"" he said; and therefore whether we would or no, he took it to treasure it."
lotr,39u6dm,AmbiguousAnonymous,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:59:30 2015 UTC,"Canon does get tricky. And I think it gets trickier for people like me who didn't initially have access to the later books. I've read the Silmarillion about a dozen times, but I've read LotR every year since the early 60's.  I don't argue with people who take the Silmarillion as canon, it just isn't in the same camp for me.  It seems to me that Elrond here is speaking partly with the benefit of hindsight, but that's just my interpretation. We agree that Isildur should never have taken the ring.  I just think (as the original point we were both addressing says) it's not fair to blame him for the deaths that came after when the wise who were with him could have done more too - especially if they knew better than Isildur.  Besides, if Isildur doesn't take the ring, we never get the story of LotR, so from a mythological standpoint, it needs to happen.  I bow to your scholarship"
lotr,39u6dm,fileg,4,Tue Jun 16 01:03:46 2015 UTC,He never touched the ring.
lotr,39u6dm,RoboRay,20,Sun Jun 14 21:53:27 2015 UTC,'Ringbearer' does not and has never meant 'person who touches a Ring'.
lotr,39u6dm,Uluithiad,-3,Sun Jun 14 21:13:29 2015 UTC,"But he was one of the few people in the history of middle earth to give up possession of the ring. And when he picked it up you could see the effect it had on him. He possessed it, felt its power, and gave it up. I believe him to be a ring-bearer (in the movies)."
lotr,39u6dm,Not_Without_My_Balls,12,Sun Jun 14 21:39:09 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point. If you've only watched the movies then read the book and then you'll understand better.   Just because you believe it to be true doesn't make it so. You asked a question and Uluithiad (one of the most knowledgeable Tolkien redditers) has given you a definitive answer.  Even if you are right and Boromir was a 'bearer' he would still have never been allowed over the sea. Bilbo, Sam and Frodo all overcame great temptation and evil with the ring. Boromir barely held it and still went power mad at his end."
lotr,39u6dm,Bagel_Ballingall,10,Sun Jun 14 21:48:24 2015 UTC,Clumsy foreshadowing in a movie does not make him a Ringbearer.
lotr,39u6dm,Uluithiad,-1,Sun Jun 14 21:41:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that was clumsy. I personally prefer how the films handled it. In the books, it was a sudden shock. Oh wait, Boromir is bad now? It was so out the blue.  In the film, that moment was built up to so it made more sense when it happened."
lotr,39u6dm,hoodie92,3,Sun Jun 14 22:51:18 2015 UTC,"But the books show us the incredible power of the ring using Boromir as the sacrifice to do so. We like him, he isn't quite as bad ass as Aragorn, but he still does a lot of cool things with good intentions. But the ring gets ahold of him and BAM! He isnt able to stop himself. He needs it."

lotr,39u6dm,Bakatcha_Bandit,2,Mon Jun 15 01:27:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I believe the entire fellowship are ringbearers (though not in the strict sense being used here.) Every one of them is vital to Frodo's support (they all carry him) and the success of the mission. None of them can be left out if the actual ringbearer is to prevail.  Nor do I consider those who had the ring before the mission to be ringbearers in the same way as those who actually bore the weight of that mission.  But I don't think carrying the ring in any sense was a ticket to Valinor- the Valar simply chose to help those who they thought could benefit from their healing."
lotr,39u6dm,fileg,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:17:38 2015 UTC,"Would Smeagol have been allowed to go to the Undying Lands, if he would be alive after the destruction of the ring. I mean, he wouldn't want to, but... he was a ringbearer."
lotr,39u6dm,Impudenter,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:24:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's exclusive for those who actually put it on. In the books Frodo, Bilbo, and Sam are the only ones to put on the ring, and eventually they all travel to the Undying Lands. In the movie I don't think Sam is ever acknowledged as a ring bearer, nor does he put it on. And the movie story ends after Frodo and Bilbo head to the Undying Lands. For all we know, in the movie mythos Sam never goes to the Undying Lands and spends his last days in the Shire."

lotr,39vlln,Leftys-Wheelchair,4,Mon Jun 15 08:51:20 2015 UTC,"Meh. I want to say he wrote something about how his history was concerned with the West, because that's where the Elves were born, lived, and traveled on their way to the Undying Lands.  He didn't write anything of note about Harad either, even though we know Aragorn went there both before and after the War of the Ring.  I think the Blue Wizards were a trivial one-off reference that Tolkien never meant to flesh out, but his fascination with and devotion to the world he had created kept drawing him back to them: even the cats of Queen Beruthiel eventually got a fragmented story to explain the reference."

After Faramir is sent out to Osgiliath against reason, there is a scene where Gandalf sits, amidst sinking hues of gold, in the back area of some building in Minas Tirith, his staff at his side, staring into the air. To see Gandalf, the ultimate driving wisdom and force behind the fellowship stop to mourn and grieve about such evil times, it hit me. It communicates the evil and vulnerability in a strong way.

By the time the Silmarillion was available, I had been reading and re-reading Lotr for about 15 years. That is the story that won and held my heart.  No matter how much I love the earlier ages, I always see them as history that informs the story I fell in love with.  The other part is the writing - I am one of those people who loves Tolkien's writing. I never found it hard to read or boring, even when I first read it (I was 11). I have my favorite parts, but it has the most storylike narrative.  It is interesting to me how differently the Lore is viewed by those who always had access to the later books."

I was crushed when I got to the end and discovered there were 2 more books and I didn't have them! Luckily, my dad hunted them down the next day.  I have always felt that some books are even better if you read them at exactly the right time. For me, that happened with LotR.    Later, I met my husband over an illustrated edition of The Hobbit, so we have shared the books for almost 40 years. He still apologizes to me for getting me excited about the (Bakshi) movie!"

The First Age has the Valar as active players in the world.  Also it deals with subjects that are by Third Age standards legendary.  Finally the first age players are the archetypes of their species.  Having said all that the Third Age has its own heroes and tales that will become legend.

lotr,39uxai,jstock23,2,Mon Jun 15 00:24:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I just love balls to the wall  fantasy, and as much as people say the lotr trilogy is stereotypical fantasy, the level of magic used is nowhere near the level of other fantasy series. And when magic is used, it's subdued, not flashy. I would honestly argue Game of Thrones has more mystical elements than the trilogy. Even without having elves or dwarves."
lotr,39uxai,ReinierPersoon,2,Mon Jun 15 00:45:50 2015 UTC,"Yes. Tolkien's view of magic was that it is a power, and power is dangerous in the wrong hands. I think that's why it plays such a small part. The most prominent magic is the ring itself and that is the main ""antagonist"" if you will.  Gandalf is in fact limited in Middle Earth on purpose so he does not have the potential to do too much harm. So these things are on purpose. He uses fire magic occasionally, but it's not his crutch.  Whereas in something like the Silmarillion we find Yavanna growing plants at her will."

I'm saying that as time went on, it was used less and less, especially by the Valar and their helpers. They wanted to reduce the potential destruction magic can cause to middle earth, because in the past large battles with Morgoth literally felled mountains and changed the very geography.  Magic as a ""power"" is not in itself good or bad. Just like Saruman's technology, it is seen as potentially bad in the wrong circumstances, so it is not desired in a world with those who can corrupt it like Morgoth. That's why I think Tolkien chose to have magic play less of a part as time went on.  A magic like Feanor's crafting of the silmarilli may seem good in that it perpetuates the light of the trees, but it is also the cause of much of middle earth's troubles."

lotr,39trvq,humblepudding1,12,Sun Jun 14 18:22:33 2015 UTC,"Do all elven rings require the maker's essence in order to be made?    I don't believe we are told this, whereas it's made very clear that the creation of the One required Sauron's power, so that itself is one argument against it. However, I wouldn't be surprised -- not just given the power of the Rings, but also their intent. Though 'power' would be a better word than 'essence.'   Elendil and Gil-galad ""killed"" or greatly injured Sauron's body, and then Isildur took the ring, yes?   They killed him. No quotes, and not just injured. Killed, but otherwise this is correct.   Why is Sauron weaker then than he is in LotR (in both cases he is without body and without Ring). Or does he simply flee as a tactical maneuver, and return when the time is opportune, rather than after recovering strength?   Can you specify exactly when you're talking about? When facing Gil-galad and Elendil, he was stronger than during the late Third Age. However, his foes were extremely powerful themselves. After his death, he had obviously just been killed - an extremely weakening act, especially after the deaths he had already tallied up. His spirit fled then because he was defeated militarily, and there was nothing he could do. Also Sauron had a body at the time of The Lord of the Rings.   If Gandalf took the Ring and ""mastered"" it (at the Council of Elrond they mention you need to be powerful to begin with to properly use it) how could he have defeated Sauron? After all, the ring would still exist. Could he somehow cut Sauron's psychic link to it, or use its power to somehow banish Sauron?   Tolkien speculated that only Gandalf could defeat Sauron if he had the Ring. If he defeated Sauron, and mastered the Ring, ""the result would have been for Sauron the same as the destruction of the Ring; for him it would have been destroyed, taken from him forever. But the Ring and all its works would have endured. It would have been the master in the end.""   Individual power wearing the ring: [base power] [ring multiplier]? In Sauron's case, [Spirit's power +power in ring][ring multiplier]?  Is that about right?   Sauron had a physical form in the Late Third Age, and would actually be able to wear the Ring. I think this is a little too much of a 'DnD-ish' way of thinking about it, but the basic point is correct. The Ring enhances one's natural power, to the point and can be used based on the natural stature of the individual.   If the above is true, would Gandalf using the Ring be more powerful than Sauron using the ring?   Here's how Tolkien described such a scenario:  ""Confrontation of Sauron alone, unaided, self to self was not contemplated. One can imagine the scene in which Gandalf, say, was placed in such a position. It would be a delicate balance. On one side the true allegiance of the Ring to Sauron; on the other superior strength because Sauron was not actually in possession, and perhaps also because he was weakened by long corruption and expenditure of will in dominating inferiors.""   The Three Rings are subserviant to the One, simply because of the One's power of domination. But they existed on their own, independently. Why does the destruction of the One cause them to fade?   In the crafting of the One, all others became 'linked' to it. They were crafted before the One, but after its creation, they were bound to its fate."
lotr,39trvq,Edledhron,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:01:54 2015 UTC,"Ah, I think you misunderstood my scenario. It's [Gandalf wielding Ring] compared to [Sauron wielding ring]. An impossible scenario, but an interesting one. My thought was that since Gandalf is ""whole,"" having never expended his power into an object, the amplification of the One Ring could make him more powerful than End of Second Age Sauron.  Did the destruction of the One Ring then preemptively end all possibilities for future rings? Could the remainder of the White Council have made, say, a Ring of Power with the virtue of Justice or Abundance or Fellowship as a parting gift to Aragorn and the future kings of Men if they had the know-how?"
lotr,39trvq,Edledhron,2,Mon Jun 15 00:08:43 2015 UTC,"It's [Gandalf wielding Ring] compared to [Sauron wielding ring]   Ah... in that case, probably Sauron, who was naturally the more powerful of the two. Much of that didn't translate into skill in combat, but Gandalf wasn't a combat-centered maia either, certainly not when in the form of an old man.   Did the destruction of the One Ring then preemptively end all possibilities for future rings?   That's difficult to say. It would require a craftsman on the level of those who made the previous rings, and I imagine there aren't any left in Middle-earth at the time of the War of the Ring. Of course, everyone who would have had the ability would also have learned from the earlier mistake of making such rings."
lotr,39trvq,Xattm15,2,Mon Jun 15 02:41:56 2015 UTC,"Problem with No. 3 is that Gandalf feared the ring and/or what would happen if it somehow corrupted him, in fact judging from his reaction it seems likely that he thought it would corrupt him. If he didn't think he could touch it without being corrupted, I doubt that he could master it. As for 4 and 5 we don't know how much sauron put into the ring, it's possible he pit almost all in, on the other hand he could have put very little into it."

lotr,39trvq,Edledhron,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:03:50 2015 UTC,Hmm it's debatable but since the ring has part of sauron himself in it. Which means being corrupted might mean becoming Sauron himself.

Sauron put in his strength only - no spirit, no 'will,' not power.  Someone fully corrupted by the Ring would have their own unique spin on it. Gandalf, for example, would basically have forced all of society into perfect behavior - no less a dystopia than what would have been under Sauron, but a different kind."

lotr,39tcna,Impudenter,3,Mon Jun 15 21:34:56 2015 UTC,"Good question. I don't know the answer. I could go on for hours on the ways the Hobbit movies were different from the book (singular). The Hobbit is just over 200 pages and is a story initially written by Tolkien for his children. The Nine aren't even in the Hobbit, and Sauron is not mentioned by name. Saruman, Galadriel, Legolas and a host of other characters are not even in the book, they are from LotR. They were alive at the time, just not mentioned in the story. They even tried to put Aragorn in it but the actor refused, because Aragorn also isn't in the Hobbit (he is alive, but Bilbo hadn't met him yet). They probably put these characters in to create a connection to the LotR movies, and people liked these characters. Gandalf likely met Galadriel and Saruman and Elrond, but in the Hobbit it is all behind the scenes.  Basically they tried to turn a short children's book into three movies. They also used material from the appendices of LotR, most of the stuff about Dwarves vs Orcs. I think if you read the Hobbit you will find it is quite an achievement they managed to wring three very long movies from it, and they had to make up a lot of it.  The LotR movies deviated a bit too much from the movie in my opinion, but I think they are quite good and have most of the important things, without adding too much made-up stuff.  I'm still a books over movies person."

lotr,39ss8y,piratefan,11,Sun Jun 14 12:23:33 2015 UTC,"Short answer (gotta run before stores close):When Sauron was defeated the Third Age started. TA 1050 Greenwood the Great was renamed Mirkwood because Sauron came to live at Dol Guldur, and it took him roughly another 1000 years to regain his strength (he was still weaker for having lost the Ring). In TA 2941 during the events of the Hobbit the White Council drove ""the Necromancer"" from Dol Guldur and he fled to Barad-dur in Mordor.   In TA 3018 the War of the Ring happened and he was ""killed"" again, and is now a powerless spirit."
lotr,39ss8y,ReinierPersoon,7,Sun Jun 14 14:12:39 2015 UTC,"he was still weaker for having lost the Ring   The Ring has nothing to do with it. He was weaker because he was killed by Gil-galad and Elendil, and that not being his first death, it took a great while for him to re-build his body.   As long as the Ring existed and was not mastered by someone else, the power Sauron put into it would always be available to him, even at great distances. Though, if he actually wore the Ring, his strength would be increased - but there is no net negative state in his relationship with the Ring."
lotr,39ss8y,Edledhron,2,Sun Jun 14 18:41:52 2015 UTC,"That too, but he was also weaker for creating the Ring, it contained a portion of his power, or at least took a portion to create it. Otherwise he could have just created another One Ring instead of looking for the original.  People on Arda seem to lose power when they create something special, Fëanor could only create the Silmarils once and claimed he would kill himself by breaking them, and Varda could not recreate the trees.  Sauron also seems to have lost the ability to appear in fair form since he was killed in the downfall of Númenor. It is not stated if that is because he died, or because he had become so evil for turning the Númenoreans against the Valar."
lotr,39ss8y,ReinierPersoon,4,Sun Jun 14 19:15:32 2015 UTC,"He put his power into the Ring, but so long as the Ring existed, that power was available to him."
lotr,39ss8y,Edledhron,2,Sun Jun 14 19:16:54 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that contrary to Saruman's quote in the movie, in the book Sauron did have physical form, but the narrative never saw him.  He probably had some physical form by the time he occupied Dol Guldur in 1050.  Even though he had the ring, it didn't take him long to regenerate his body after his 'death' in Numenor.  He's pretty good at that."
lotr,39ss8y,Seafroggys,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:17:40 2015 UTC,"Yup, he definately had physical form, and was not some eye. I found they could have done it better in the films."
lotr,39ss8y,ReinierPersoon,3,Mon Jun 15 16:31:43 2015 UTC,"There's no need for the quotation quotes here. Sauron was dead, which simply means his spirit was severed from his body. Until he formed himself a new body, he was dead. Whatever happens to a soul is irrelevant to the person dying if the bond between the spirit and body is broken.  We do not know exactly how long Sauron was formless. At the very latest, Gandalf knew he had reincarnated by TA 2850. In 2060, the Wise believed that Sauron was taking form again. Gandalf was sent to Dol Guldur to investigate, but Sauron fled, so it may have been that he either was still shapeless, or his body was very weak.  He returned in 2460. I think it's safe to say that by then he had his body. For some context, The Hobbit takes place 2941-42, and The Lord of the Rings principally takes place 3018-19. However, his first stirrings occurred in 1100, though this was first thought to just be a Ringwraith. It was not until 2060 that the Wise thought Sauron was back, as far as we can tell.  As for why it took so long, from Tolkien himself:   It is mythologically supposed that when this shape was 'real', that is a physical actuality in the physical world and not a vision transferred from mind to mind, it took some time to build up. . . . After the battle with Gilgalad and Elendil, Sauron took a long while to re-build, longer than he had done after the Downfall of Númenor (I suppose because each building-up used up some of the inherent energy of the spirit, which might be called the 'will' or the effective link between the indestructible mind and being and the realization of its imagination)."

lotr,39tjgn,AmbiguousAnonymous,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:19:28 2015 UTC,"I beg your pardon but I don't understand. This feels out of place, how, exactly?"
lotr,39tjgn,Timiniel,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:08:05 2015 UTC,"Well the whole tone of it was quite different.  It really laid Denethor's favoritism on heavy, and undermines a bit.  Besides the fact that it is largely an invented scene that goes against the source, there is the obvious bit where Denethor openly declares that the Ring exists.  That isn't trivial.  This is just one scene, and its not the crux of the argument.  Rather, the accumulation of several additions like this take away from the story, IMO.  Gandalf the White knocked off Shadowfax and his staff is shattered by the Witch King is another example.  Ridiculous, considering he doesnt even try to finish the job.  Or Saruman falling on that spike wheel (yes I understand the Dracula reference).  IMO, I would rather watch the Theatrical ROTK.  That is the one that swept the Oscars, and it is an amazing story about how they made that deadline.  Elijah Wood even commented that Jackson said he didnt see the final version of the film until the world premier, because the schedule was so tight."
lotr,39tjgn,AmbiguousAnonymous,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"I consider that scene a very good placement and that only adds to the whole.  As such, I don't think we will see eye to eye.  Considering that I consider the theatrical versions far worse than the extended editions, and I don't give a SHIT about oscars, but only movie quality and story quality, I think we'd best stop here. We are not gonna agree."
lotr,39tjgn,Timiniel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:02:13 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I actually agree with you and don't care for the oscars and consider myself artistically inclined.  I'm a musician and the Grammy's are analogously laughable.  I mentioned them hear because of my presence over the theatrical ROTK.  And to be fair, my real preference would be somewhere between the two.   I don't understand how some things can be viewed as adding to the film, and in general I think Jackson's filter desegregated after Fellowship (which i prefer the extended of).  But many scenes do add.  But first and foremost, as a lover of the books, and considering them to be a beautiful piece of art, this scene in particular just takes away from the story quality.  We can still agree to disagree if you still like though :)"
lotr,39tjgn,AmbiguousAnonymous,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:38:22 2015 UTC,"As a lover of the books as well, I think it adds to the story in a positive way. It doesn't detract from it. It doesn't break anything, the mention of the ring's existence is secondary, or even less. The meaning of the scene fits the story entirely, and only helps to enforce tolkien's mini-story that the steward had a far preference for boromir over faramir."
lotr,39tjgn,Timiniel,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:37:19 2015 UTC,"Boromir begged to be sent to Rivendell.  They had no idea it was the one ring (which is not secondary), and Osgiliath wasn't won by Boromir but had been reclaimed before he was born.  Things like that.  I know Jackson changed a bunch of things, but if scenes are going to be added I would rather they be more in line from the source.  I think Gandalf vs the witchking and Saruman's death are better examples of being off track."

lotr,39lhn4,cr250guy,83,Fri Jun 12 16:56:30 2015 UTC,"While this is often said, it's probably not true. To quote a previous post of mine, here's Lee's own account of the meeting Tolkien:   Q: What do you remember of meeting Tolkien? CL: Very little. I was up in Oxford meeting some friends, and we were in the Randolph Hotel. Someone said, ""What are you doing here, this is all rather correct and proper; lets go to a pub."" This was forty-five + years ago. We were sitting there talking and drinking beer, and someone said, ""Oh, look who walked in."" It was Professor Tolkien, and I nearly fell off my chair. I didn't even know he was alive. He was a benign looking man, smoking a pipe, walking in, an English countryman with earth under his feet. And he was a genius, a man of incredible intellectual knowledge. He knew somebody in our group. He (the man in the group) said ""Oh Professor, Professor..."" And he came over. And each one of us, well I knelt of course, each one of us said ""how do you do?"" And I just said ""Ho.. How.. How..."" I just couldn't believe it. But I'll never forget it.    Source: http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/11/989725578   He was almost too star struck to say anything at all, much less be promised the the role. He has said, though, that he always wanted to play Gandalf, should a film ever be made. He auditioned for the role but didn't get it, obviously (probably because of his age). The whole ""Tolkien gave him his blessing"" idea is unfortunately propagated by an uncited line in Lee's lotr.wikia article. If it is true, then I haven't seen a credible source saying so."
lotr,39lhn4,EyeceEyeceBaby,42,Fri Jun 12 18:34:47 2015 UTC,"sigh it has gotten repeated on every topic in regards to Christopher Lee.  He met Tolkien.  Tolkien never said that Christopher Lee should play Gandalf, or give any advice whatsoever in regards to potential movies."
lotr,39lhn4,Seafroggys,13,Fri Jun 12 18:20:59 2015 UTC,"Lee had such an incredible life and did so much, yet the thing that gets mentioned about him most often is not true"
lotr,39lhn4,ehsteve23,93,Fri Jun 12 22:06:05 2015 UTC,"I find this oddly impersonal. It seems like there is a lot here between the lines that is not being said. I'll just chalk that up to Ian not wanted to speak on Lee's behalf (i.e. he never mentioned what he thought of Ian's Gandalf).  However, the statement about Lee doing his own stunts on Star Wars, while Lee might have said that to Ian, that is certainly not the truth of the matter. It was well publicized that his head was digitally added to the stuntman's body in Episode II and III.  But I get the sense here that they were not ""friends"" in the tradititonal sense, but that there was a professional respect."
lotr,39lhn4,FKRMunkiBoi,48,Fri Jun 12 18:59:46 2015 UTC,"Just because someone has died doesn't mean you have to tell lies to make them look better.  True stories are what keep the dead human.  Ian filled this with wonderful stories about a person with a long and amazing life.  I think it's ok that it doesn't seem like they were best buds.  In fact, I almost prefer it.  This is the closest to the real Christopher Lee I've ever come, most likely."
lotr,39lhn4,Indosay,18,Fri Jun 12 19:16:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, most people tend to react to people not being ""friends"" with ""god, they must hate each other."" just look at when the Mythbusters guys stated that they ""don't like each other."" people took it as an expression of actual dislike, when what it really was, was affirmation that they aren't buddies.   Those laughs on set can't be faked tho. They stimulate each other professionally and i think that's true of Ian and Christopher and indeed of Peter and Christopher as well. Christopher was rather stoic and a true gentleman. That's also the picture everyone paints. He seemed like a stand-up guy and one which it was more probable to have a respectful, positive relation to, rather than a chummy-huggy friendship that most of the younger LoTR cast had."
lotr,39lhn4,koeleskab,2,Sat Jun 13 00:40:40 2015 UTC,"In the extra footage on the DVD Ian said something to the effect of, ""[Lee] made many films and not all were good.""  I was left with the same impression that there was tension/envy between the two."

You see Shatner not attending Nimoy's funeral, 'because he had charity work to do,' and you wonder.  Better is Chris Rock, when being coaxed by Howard Stern into saying anything negative about Charlie Sheen, simply kept saying how talented Sheen was.  Irregardless, I felt that what Ian said on the extra footage was unnecessary, but again, hopefully you are correct."
lotr,39lhn4,fatkiddown,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:58:04 2015 UTC,"Shatner not attending the funeral could be because he did not get along with many of the other actors either, and it would be awkward to go to a funeral where people don't really want you. Better for everyone not to attend. It's pretty clear that George Takei really, really does not get along with him. But the charity explanation would work too, since perhaps Nimoy would have found that more important than his funeral.  I think Sir Ian was just being honest, he has often says very opinionated things. I get the impression he is the kind of person that voices his opinion and stands behind it, refusing to be silent. He has also said he tore pages out of Bibles in hotel rooms because of the awful anti-gay passages in it (""it is an abomination""). That will make him some enemies, but he says it anyway. I believe if he disliked Sir Christopher in any way, he could have said something like ""We didn't always get along, but I respected him as an actor"", but he didn't. Or it could just be a friendly jab at a collegue.  On the other hand, Sir Christopher was a supporter of the Conservatives, and Sir Ian sort of wasn't. The Conservatives have a bad track record on gay rights."

This is not the case for names in Númenorean or Dwarvish where it is used to denote a long vowel (So it is not Noomenor from what I understand)."
lotr,39pakr,magradhaid,7,Sat Jun 13 14:11:12 2015 UTC,"Well, Númenor itself is a Quenya word (it's Anadûnê in Adûnaic, the Númenórean language), and as such the ú is pronounced the same as in Túrin.  Tolkien notes in App. E that u is similar to that in brute, and that ur is pronounced like oor, not as in fur. Presumably úr would also be oor, but with oo held longer, since he says that the acute accent is used to mark a long vowel (ú) - though in some documents he uses a macron instead (ū). The note on Númenórean (Adûnaic) and Dwarvish (Khuzdul) refers to circumflexes (û), which don't show up often in Quenya (but do appear in Sindarin more frequently)."

For they say that Aule the Maker, whom they call Mahal, cares for them, and gathers them to Mandos in halls set apart; and that he declared to their Fathers of old that Iluvatar will hallow them and give them a place among the Children in the End.  Then their part shall be to serve Aule and to aid him in the remaking of Arda after the Last Battle.  They say also that the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves return to live again in their own kin and to bear once more their ancient names: of whom Durin was the most renowned in after ages, father of that kindred most friendly to the Elves, whose mansions were at Khazad-dum.""  These are two separate beliefs, but neither is given as the true belief.  I'd say it's up to personal choice, and I'd personally lean toward the latter.  Especially since there are a bunch of Durins that are supposed to match the Dwarven belief of reincarnation of the Seven Fathers."

While Aule says that the Dwarves will have a place among the Children in the End. Iluvatar never says this, and instead shows disdain for the Dwarves, and says the he will in no way edit his handiwork."
lotr,39fk5m,BAMFSoB,9,Thu Jun 11 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"Eru still gives life to the Dwarves. What I think it means is that he will not allow the Dwarves to come before his own precious Elves and Men, so he will let them sleep until after the Elves are there, not that they are somehow not worth of life.  Somewhere in the Silmarillion it says ""the Dwarves believe [their afterlife is so and so]"", I always took that ""believe"" to mean the usual ambiguity of Tolkien, not that it is in any way untrue. A lot of things are explained with ""It is said that...""  or ""The Wise say..."" since it written somewhat from an in-universe perspective, so the writer may not have known for certain, he just telling what everyone believes.   We take a lot of things from the books as fact when often it is just Gandalf or someone else saying something and us trusting him.

lotr,39fk5m,BAMFSoB,2,Thu Jun 11 16:20:26 2015 UTC,What does the grey curtain of this world rolls back refer to?
lotr,39fk5m,Abdabo,3,Thu Jun 11 17:59:59 2015 UTC,"For this scene the filmwriters took the book lines describing what Frodo saw as the ship approached Tol Eressëa at the end of RotK (in the film they only show him leaving the Grey Havens, not his arrival elsewhere) and then re-purposed them for some kind of afterlife statement, which isn't what the book scene is about. In the book's case, Frodo made a metaphysical journey to the Blessed Realm, which used to be west seaward of Númenor but was removed from the circles of the world after the shenanigans that Sauron manipulated the Númenóreans into doing. So I suppose in both forms (film and book) the line is used to describe leaving Middle-earth - but that's only equivalent to death in the films (though Frodo would die in Eressea when the time came anyway, being a mortal). In Tolkien's ideas, humans/hobbits have a different kind of afterlife, though they didn't know the details as much as we do. Some trusted that ""beyond [the Circles of the World there] is more than memory,"" while others feared death and complained that ""For of us is required a blind trust, and a hope without assurance, knowing not what lies before us in a little while."""

I'll update when I have a chance to look it up.  EDIT: Well, I haven't yet found anything definitive, but this says of Lee's mother: ""She was also a paragon of refinement, very conscious that the Carandinis are one of the oldest families in Europe, dating themselves back to the first century AD. They were close to the Emperor Charlemagne and granted the right to bear the coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire by the later Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. A more recent ancestor, Cardinal Consalvi, was the Pope's Secretary Of State in Napoleonic times, and is buried in the Pantheon next to Raphael.""

lotr,39mg9p,Westerhoe,8,Fri Jun 12 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"It says IIRC that Melkor corrupted many, and of these were the Balrogs. It is important to note that the Balrogs are spirits of fire, like  Arien, the Maia who steers the Sun, and like Gandalf.  Not all Maiar are spirits of fire.    Sauron is not one, his affinity is smithing (and he was corrupted later, no in the beginning like the Balrogs).  For pretty much everything about Balrogs: read this"

But after Isildur cut the Ring off Sauron's finger, he lost his body, stayed an intangile spirit as the Necromancer, then fled to Mordor as a fiery eye. So he must have had some fiery connection. But as /u/Uluithiadsaid: he picked up fiery elements since Morgoth invented extreme heat/cold, it makes sense that he would take on those aspects. I still don't understand though why he would be more of a neutral spirit until he manifested as the Eye"
lotr,39mg9p,ReinierPersoon,10,Fri Jun 12 21:28:36 2015 UTC,"he lost his body, stayed an intangile spirit as the Necromancer, then fled to Mordor as a fiery eye.   My point above was that this is incorrect. It's a fairly common misconception spread by the films. Tolkien himself described Sauron around the time of the War of the Ring thus (emphasis mine):   ...in a tale which allows the incarnation of great spirits in a physical and destructible form their power must be far greater when actually physically present. Sauron should be thought of as very terrible. The form that he took was that of a man of more than human stature, but not gigantic. In his earlier incarnation he was able to veil his power (as Gandalf did) and could appear as a commanding figure of great strength of body and supremely royal demeanour and countenance. - Letter 246   It's clear Tolkien is referring to the time period during which the books take place, not only from ""In his earlier incarnation..."" but also from the preceding passages regarding Aragorn's contest with him via the Palantir. The point is, in the films you are correct. He manifested as a great fiery eye. In the actual text, however, he used the red eye much the same way Saruman used the white hand, as a symbol. In actuality he was a real, tangible, incarnate being with a body."
lotr,39mg9p,WittyCommenterName,3,Fri Jun 12 21:38:27 2015 UTC,"And Gollum has seen Sauron, he talks of him as having ""nine fingers on his black hand"" or something to that effect."

The troll he fought at the Black gate was also originally Sauron, but the troll was later CGI'd in (IIRC). However I do think the film heavily implies the eye itself is Sauron.

Read the Silmarillion a few years later, which took considerably more time due to the more poetic and flowery prose. It's nonetheless a must read in the LOTR collection.

Having read the books before PJ even decided to make the movies, I have a greater appreciation/understanding of the LOTR universe rather than simply what the movies portray.

Now here I am at 18 4 chapters in loving every second of it. I know I waited too long but I struggled to find a reason to read sadly.

As she always does she made me read the books before I could see the movies. (Thank you mum.) I started with the Hobbit then read LOTR. The movies weren't as good, but still some of the best I've seen. (Not the Hobbit films though.)  After that it was the Silmarillion, the Children of Húrin, etc. Middle-earth has remained my favourite world (16 now) and rereading the books never gets old.

IIRC I think I saw the FotR movie and after that managed to get a copy of Unfinished Tales from the library. After reading that, I read The Hobbit and then the Silmarillion. (Unless it was LotR > Hobbit > UT > Silmarillion; I can't remember anymore).   By that point I was hooked, and ended up buying those, buying and reading the HoME in order as well as buying and reading Letters, Carpenter's biography, and more Tolkien-related books. I need another bookcase now but my room is too small ... I have double or triple the books that can fit on the one bookcase, so the rest is packed in boxes scattered throughout my room's floor."

lotr,39jp6n,Steuard,7,Fri Jun 12 05:07:49 2015 UTC,"This is actually really interesting.  I wonder what he thought of Sir Ian's portrayal of Gandalf and I wonder if Ian ever asked him for advice on the character's background.  I also wonder what he thought of the lack of the Scouring of the Shire. I never have seen anything about him speaking out against it, but I would think he must have thought it should have been included.  Edit: From Ian McKellen's Facebook page:   When I arrived in New Zealand to start filming as Gandalf, in the first week of the 21st Century, Peter Jackson held a dinner for some of the cast. I was happily next to Christopher Lee who I had known of throughout my actor-admiring life. He'd been cast as the white wizard Saruman but his opening line to me was: ""I've always thought I should play Gandalf. I read 'Lord of the Rings' every year - sometimes twice."" He then treated me to a snatch of the black speech of Mordor and I felt inadequate. Not that that was Chris's intention: he was 78 and well practised in the art of gentlemanly rectitude. The epitome of ""tall, dark and handsome"" kept any inner demons for his acting Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and, once, as Sherlock Holmes. It's what made his Saruman so effective. With his long beard and white robes, he had the air of a stern yet benign Pope that belied his ambition to rule Middle-earth, with cruelty and spite. Between our facing-off on the set, he could easily be persuaded to reminisce. After all there were over 200 films on his CV and a couple of singing albums. His earliest intention was to be an opera bass., Touchingly he was a little nervous at the outset. ""Peter made me do my first speech 10 times!!"" I told him not to worry as the previous day I'd had to repeat a scene 27 times. His dark eyes widened and glinted but he didn't complain again. Peter was tickled to have his Hammer Horror hero as the villain and devised a spectacular death to acknowledge his vampiric past - falling onto a spike which pierced his dastardly heart. Chris didn't much approve and I think the episode can only be seen in the extended Director's Cut. An odd pity that he didn't work in the theatre, nor direct a film, like his idol Laurence Olivier who had Chris as a spear-carrier in his film of 'Hamlet.' But he was justly proud of the span and success of his career in movies and when knighted must, like all of us, have been pleased to share a title with Sir Larry. The last time Saruman and Gandalf filmed together was 'round a table in Rivendell but while Galadriel, Elrond and I were in the Wellington studio, Sir Christopher's interjections were filmed in London some months later. You can't tell. In movies, all is not as it seems. Yet when he joined the ""Star Wars"" cast he said he did all his own stunts without benefit of a stand-in. That certainly wasn't true of his gravity-defying fight with Gandalf. I suspect he just wanted to declare he was in old age fit for purpose. He needn't have worried. His acting prowess never declined. -- Ian McKellen, June 2015"
lotr,39jp6n,italia06823834,8,Fri Jun 12 12:49:05 2015 UTC,"I've always had an issue with Saruman's death, I'm glad that Lee did as well. The damn ending was an hour in itself, why didn't Jackson put the scouring of the shire in there instead of 3 different end scenes? I understand that it was probably because it would detract from the Black Gate battle, but I feel like the hobbits kicking ass is a much better close to Tolkien's message (That and I want Sharkey to fight some hobbits!)."
lotr,39jp6n,Past_life_God,4,Fri Jun 12 16:23:43 2015 UTC,"Very good read, Christopher Lee is so interesting, and he was right on the budget required. He said $200-300 million, and the budget for the trilogy was $280 million in the end.  Plus, he ended up playing Saruman even though he said he'd portray Gandalf perfectly, which I have no doubt of, but his Saruman is truly legendary. I'm just glad they got him at all to work on these movies."
lotr,39jp6n,Daxtreme,5,Fri Jun 12 14:58:39 2015 UTC,"“I don’t know whether they’d want me as Gandalf – they’d probably want a more expensive actor for something that big, because that’s the way casting is done these days, on the basis of what you get paid rather than whether you’re right for it...""   Which is exactly what happened, since they tried to get Sean Connery as Gandalf. Thank goodness that failed!  It's amazing to consider that this article's writer is probably responsible for Lee's involvement as Saruman, since Lee wasn't aware of the project and probably made a call the moment the interview ended to get in touch with his agent and Peter Jackson."

lotr,39j82x,DolorousNedd,4,Fri Jun 12 02:36:34 2015 UTC,"need something consistent.    Well, I hate to tell you this, but... even in Tolkien's world there's a lot of inconsistency.  Still, if you really want to read chronologically, it's confusing, because The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, and The Children of Húrin all overlap with one another, and the final parts of the first two overlap with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.  You could start with The Silmarillion up to the end of the First Age, read The Children of Húrin and the relevant portions of Unfinished Tales next, and then read the Second Age material in The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. And then on to The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. This isn't strictly chronological — doing that is a lot of work, to put it mildly — but it's pretty good.  This assumes that you've already read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit at least once. It's a bad idea to try reading chronologically as a first pass."

lotr,39j82x,ASliceofAmazing,2,Sat Jun 13 11:12:13 2015 UTC,"One way to read them that gets mentioned sometimes is starting with The Hobbit and LotR, and then read The Silmarillion until the chapter Of Turin Turambar.

Feanor didn't like his father getting married again, and so he was never especially close to Fingolfin. But it was Morgoth's influence that made their relationship really go downhill. When Feanor was deceived by Morgoth's lies, he began acting rather arrogantly and openly spoke out against the Valar. Eventually, Fingolfin decided to confront his father about Feanor, asking him to keep Feanor in line and questioning Feanor's loyalty. So then Feanor accused Fingolfin of trying to usurp his place as their father's heir, drew a sword on him, and threatened to kill him if he did anything like that again. The Valar were not happy with this and exiled Feanor for twelve years. Much later, after most of the Noldor had returned to Middle-earth, Feanor was killed. His oldest son Maedhros was captured by Morgoth, but rescued by Fingolfin's son Fingon. Maedhros, out of gratitude and in an attempt to repair the divide between Feanor's followers and Fingolfin's followers, gave up his claim to the kingship. Fingolfin became High King of the Noldor, but Maedhros and Feanor's other sons were still powerful lords that mostly did their own thing."

Short creation story: Eru (God) creates a bunch of spirits, these spirits create Arda (the world), and some choose to live there permanently. These are the Ainur, who are divided into the Valar and the less powerful but more numerous Maiar.  They could choose their appearance, at least to a degree. The Valar are all associated with their own ""domain"", Aulë for example is called the Maker. Sauron and Saruman were both initially followers of Aulë. Most Maiar follower one of the Valar.  Melkor/Morgoth is a Vala that turned to evil, and Sauron followed him. The Balrogs are Maiar that are associated with fire, and they chose to follow Morgoth and took the form of Balrogs. Morgoth seem to use them mainly for war, the Balrogs killed a bunch of the heroes of the Elves. ""The"" Balrog is what is possibly the last Balrog to exist, most Balrogs were killed or fled.  The Silmarillion has the whole story, but basically Sauron, the Balrog and Gandalf are more or less immortal beings that have been around since the creation of the world. Radagast is also one. Elbereth who is mentioned by the Elves a lot is a Vala. The Valar and most of the Maiar (I assume) are in Valinor, which is where the Elves go."

lotr,39apv9,Willie9,6,Wed Jun 10 15:16:10 2015 UTC,"No. Gandalf (as Olorin) before he was sent to Middle-earth was reluctant to go at all, saying he was afraid of Sauron.  But the mission the Istari (Wizards) were given was not one to fight Sauron directly. They were sent to inspire and rally the people of Middle-earth against him.  Sauron also wasn't always evil. He originally served Aule, the Valar of Smithing (as did Saruman).   There are however ""good"" Maiar who are very powerful. Melian for example kept the realm of Beleriand safe for much of the First Age with her power."
lotr,39apv9,AmbiguousAnonymous,5,Wed Jun 10 15:51:36 2015 UTC,Yes that makes a lot of sense because basically all the characters come together to defeat Sauron in the end.  And it was more of an act of God too that he was defeated--as Gollum technically destroyed the ring.

Not in the least, he simply wanted to subjugate it's peoples so he could order it in an efficient manner. Sure a great many people may die, and many beautiful things destroyed, but if it wasn't his primary intent, is it really evil? I'd argue no more so than the man trying to help, but who does more harm than good. He's not evil, simply misguided. Obviously I'm playing devil's advocate here but the point is Sauron would not have thought himself ""evil"" if he was the one writing the story."
lotr,39apv9,PrivateChicken,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:20:41 2015 UTC,"That's true he didn't physically destroy, I meant like emotionally,  he wanted to do something much worse--which is have dominion over it himself.. He has such great pride and thinks of himself as better than his creator.. therefore he hates everything that the creator made so he wants to destroy it in the way that he wants all the creatures to be unhappy and despairing so they will turn away from anything the creator made because that will make the creator sad..and yes I agree he wouldn't have thought of himself as evil he thinks he's better than all, but he is evil in the way that evil is to go against anything good which is what he does"
lotr,39apv9,ReinierPersoon,2,Wed Jun 10 16:33:33 2015 UTC,"The profile you're describing better fits Melkor than Sauron. Melkor was much more nihilistic and destructive than Sauron. Sauron was attracted to Melkor as a means of ordering and structuring the world efficiently. Here's a quote from HoME Vol X - Morgoth's Ring:   Sauron had never reached this stage of nihilistic madness. He did not object to the existence of the world, so long as he could do what he liked with it. He still had the relics of positive purposes, that descended from the good of the nature in which he began: it had been his virtue (and therefore also the cause of his fall, and of his relapse) that he loved order and coordination, and disliked all confusion and wasteful friction. (It was the apparent will and power of Melkor to effect his designs quickly and masterfully that had first attracted Sauron to him.) Sauron had, in fact, been very like Saruman, and so still understood him quickly and could guess what he would be likely to think and do, even without the aid of palantiri or of spies; whereas Gandalf eluded and puzzled him.   Tolkien notes specifically that he isn't anti-creation (Eru's creation that is), so long as he is controlling and ordering it. I understand this is almost the same as what you said, but the point is that his primary motivation was not to work against Eru and his creation but simply to order it as he saw fit. Melkor/Morgoth on the other hand was much more nihilistic. He would not have stopped until the total corruption and destruction of all creation had been achieved, and even then would have been left unsatisfied."
lotr,39apv9,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:58:27 2015 UTC,ohh great insight!! and awesome quote! That actually makes a lot of sense--basically Sauron wanted to keep the creation but essentially control it as he saw fit
lotr,39apv9,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:01:42 2015 UTC,"Sauron really didn't have a pure desire just to enslave--its much too simplistic to suggest that he just wanted slaves.  Sauron was a crafter, and a plotter, and he wanted order in Middle Earth.  His plan was to initially bring that order by corrupting the leaders into following what he wanted, but that failed spectacularly, so he decided it would be best to conquer Middle Earth and then enslave it to make his aspirations of control more effective."

lotr,39apv9,1EnTaroAdun1,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:05:50 2015 UTC,"The Wizards were sent to Middle-earth in the form of old men to guide the people of Middle-earth against Sauron, but they were not allowed to dominate them or force them. Their purpose was to organise a resistance, not to fight Sauron themselves.  Gandalf's ""power"" was the ability to convince other people to do the right thing. He also had the Ring Narya, that is only revealed at the end of the book when they are at the Havens, and that Ring was also meant to inspire hope in others.  Gandalf is likely pretty powerful of himself since he took on a Balrog, but then there are also powerful Elves that have done so. Gandalf specifically mentions Glorfindel as one of the mighty ones (he is also in the Silmarillion, briefly). Aragorn managed to wrest control away from Sauron when he used the Palantír. Sauron was also weakened by the creation of the One Ring, a part of his power was in it."
lotr,39apv9,ReinierPersoon,2,Wed Jun 10 15:48:37 2015 UTC,Interesting!  That can be connected to the angels thing because angels have free will (this is according to Catholic teaching) but they can influence us in the way of giving us ideas of hope and such.. It works the same way with demons too
lotr,39apv9,Uluithiad,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:59:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, it seems free will is the norm. It extends to Elves and Men, the Elves are invited to come to Valinor to live with the Valar, but it remains their choice. The Elves that went were also allowed to leave, though things went a bit sour after that (Silmarillion). One thing I liked about the Silmarillion is how it shows a very different side of the Elves.  Tolkien himself was a devout Catholic and there is certainly a Christian influence to the story. He was also knowledgable about different mythologies such as the Norse or Finnish ones. The Names of Gandalf and Thorin are taken literally from one of the poems of the Edda. Tolkien described Gandalf as ""an Odinic Wanderer"", likening him to Odin, who also traveled among the people as an old man without revealing his true identity."
lotr,39apv9,ReinierPersoon,2,Wed Jun 10 16:12:15 2015 UTC,hmm very interesting!! It seems that I MUST read the Silmarillion
lotr,39apv9,Uluithiad,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:18:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Silmarillion is obligatory!  In the sidebar on the right is a recommended reading order. I read the Silmarillion before The Children of Húrin, but that was because the Húrin book had not been published yet.  I haven't read the Children of Húrin yet, but it is more similar to LotR in that it is a real novel, unlike the Silmarillion which is more like a Bible or history book. The Silmarillion contains major spoilers for it though, since it has the short version of the story so you will know how it ends. There is a link at the bottom of the side bar explaining how all the books are related, might as well post the link: http://redd.it/151jct  I found the Silmarillion a really interesting read. You may want to decide if you stop reading when Húrin shows up and do the Húrin book first, or just read on anyway."

lotr,39apv9,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"The most concise way to analogize would actually be closer to an Angel from Christianity.  There's a really good video on YouTube which explains the whole mythos hierarchy HERE.  In short, after the world of Middle Earth was created, ""God"" had his choir of ""Angels"".  One of these high-ranking ""Angels"" rebels against the existing order of everything, and brings a few lesser ""Angels"" along with him.  This leads to conflict in the pre-history of Middle Earth, as well as the ""First Age"".  One of these ""lesser Angels"" is Sauron, who rises to power as we know in the Second and Third Ages of Middle Earth.  The Balrog (as well as the wizards such as Saurumon, Radagast, and Gandalf) are a step below these ""Angels"" in the grand hierarchy of Middle Earth."
lotr,39apv9,Voicy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:06:12 2015 UTC,Thanks that link is perfect!! Do you think that Balrogs are the lesser angels?  Like after they rejected God did they essentially turn into Balrogs--or did Balrogs exist before the angels?

Besides, as other people on this sub have pointed out to me, Tom really wouldn't have stood a chance against Sauron.

He's an enigma and I think he really adds to the overall mysteriousness of the Quest of the four Hobbits in the beginning.  He's a perfect example of deus ex machina and the fact that Tolkien leaves us scratching out heads make him even more, to borrow the word, queer.    His identity is intriguing because the Ring has no power over him and we're told he has been in Middle-Earth from the beginning but yet his power is limited to the Old Forest and the Downs."

I am afraid to experience that for this series.   You're going to feel that way. There's not much to do about it. I've read LotR probably around 5 or 6 times now and I get that feeling each time. Luckily, there's a wealth of literature to read beyond LotR (See Here). Personally I feel like LotR itself has a lot of re-readability (granted I like to give it a couple years in between though).

It also has the real ending for Aragorn and Arwen, and a lot of backstory for the Dwarves, the Dúnedain and the Rohirrim.  Oh, I just remembered that the Silmarillion near the end has a chapter (or book?) about the War of the Ring, which is basically a short retelling of LotR with little bits of information we didn't get in LotR. Like the appendices, it's a bit ""behind the scenes"" such as explaining how Gandalf got his Ring.  I also clearly remember when I finished the books for the first time. I think I was 13 or 14."

lotr,395jk0,grantishere,23,Tue Jun 9 22:48:05 2015 UTC,"I wrote this some time back regarding The Blue Wizards in regards to The Istari:  I have read a lot on the Istari. This is all from memory. Forgive mistakes. The Istari were meant to avoid the incredible cataclysmic destruction caused by War of Wrath in the First Age, which brought the end of Morgoth (Melkor). It was a war between 'angels' that violently changed the Earth itself. Guilt over their failure to care for the Earth (tricked by Morgoth) and care for Eru's little children (Elves/Men), the Valar planned and sent the Istari, emissaries, guides, counselors. Only 4 of these mattered or were meant for the mission of bringing war against Sauron: Curumo (Saruman), Olorin (Gandalf), Alatar (unknown), Pallando (unknown). Radagast was not initially intended to go, but was forced onto the party by Yavanna, who wanted him to check-up on the little animals she had created. Indeed he played little part, and little cared (books, not movies). Each name mattered. Curumo=engineering/craft. We do see Saruman doing just that, building the gear and devices and armies for war, but instead for the enemy. Olorin=far seeing, wise, counselor. Gandalf was to encourage the disparate peoples of Middle Earth to cooperate. We find him racing to and fro doing this. Lastly, Alatar and Pallando. It was the far east and south of the planet that was the wildest, that even the Valar knew the least about. The peoples there would be needed in the fight. Since A. there was a 'fog of war' to this part of the world and B. the people there would need much enlightenment about the history and state of things, the 2 Blue Wizards were sent. The fact that they were of the same color shows they were paired for this single mission. Alatar=radiance (one of 2 possible interpretations). And/or, the one who would enlighten and reveal. But he needed a guide, someone gifted in trail-blazing who could be his partner.  And so he was paired with: Pallando=far wanderer, a traveler. The fact that these armies instead end-up on the side of Mordor show the failure of Alatar and Pallando. Just as Sauruman, they fell-from-grace regarding their mission. Aiwendil=Radagast. His original name is translated, ""one who adores his maiden"" and reveals that this is why he was partly inept at any other sort of mission. He only wanted what she wanted and she wanted focus on the little creatures of Middle Earth she had made.   Edit: The Blue Wizards were sent East and South in Tolkien's earlier writings, to the East only in later."

Although Christopher states that Pallando may have been sent by Mandos and Nienna instead. Christopher goes on to state they may have been deliberately sent further East due to Orome's greater knowledge of those lands than other of the Valar, although this is only speculation.

It came across as an accusation of OP not knowing how to perform a basic reddit search. Why not link OP to other good disucssions and steer them away from the bad ones? You literally highlighted the search box, without giving any direction or indication as to which discussions about the blue wizards are good and which ones are bad. All Tolkien fans are well aware of how much the facts are twisted (pls no bombadil is god theory) and how many popular online theories can be quickly debunked by reading a single paragraph of LOTR/silmarillion.   Essentially my point is that you don't seem to want to help OP, but rather make fun of him/her. It happens a lot in this sub (for some reason).  When i first came to this sub I asked basic questions like why did Gollum hate the elven rope etc. Yes I could've searched for it, but after getting a few responses and seeing a discussion that went further into the lore, I decided to actually get around to reading the books. You have to remember just how overwhelmingly intimidating the books are to new readers and the plethora of lore available. It's both fascinating & terrifying to newcomers.  Additionally it only takes 30s to adequately answer OPs question and I feel that 'palming them off' because 'its already been discussed' is kinda lazy."
lotr,395jk0,Greenehh,6,Tue Jun 9 13:29:57 2015 UTC,"For a discussion about the blue wizards I agree, however imagine if someone wanted to know who Tom Bombadil was and decided to google search it.   This sub has taught me that the best way to discuss lore is to directly link the relevant passages, something I rarely see in other subs (for example /r/whowouldwin has only recently implemented lists of feats for characters with appropriate references). The only other time I'm exposed to referencing is during my studies and hence was an entirely new concept to me, when discussing fiction.   But the OP either is unaware that the function exists and that they could easily locate the answers they're looking for, or they don't care   I think you're glossing over the possibility that newcomers don't know what they're looking for when researching the lore. Many Tolkien fans would tell you direct quotes are the best way to procede, however from my personal experience I usually see opinions and feelings thrown around when discussing fictional works. This can easily be carried over by those new to Tolkien's work and lead to the creation of inaccurate theories (e.g eagle theory, Bombadil is god theory, Ungoliant is Eru's other half theory etc.).  Finally google searching isn't always the optimal solution as many of the ME wikis contain wrong information or don't tell the whole truth. This is something unique to LOTR that I haven't (yet) found for any other fictional work or at least to the same degree."

lotr,395t3j,Leftys-Wheelchair,9,Tue Jun 9 13:39:58 2015 UTC,"Elbereth is an alternative name for Varda, one of the Valar that lives in the West. She is the most beloved Valar by the Elves in Middle-Earth, which is why Gildor references her in particular.  If it was inhabited before Hobbits arrived, the Shire would have been populated with Men, as it was inside the Kingdom of Arnor, a sister kingdom to Gondor that was destroyed partway through the Third Age by the Kingdom of Angmar. Sidenote, since the lines of kings in Arnor and Gondor were related (The line of Arnor began with Isildur, Gondor with Anarion, who were brothers), Aragorn, who is a direct descendant of the Arnorian kings, has a claim to the throne of Gondor (since the line of Anarion was broken).  Anyway, the hobbits lived in the Shire for an undetermined amount of time after LOTR, though since LOTR stands in as history/myth for Earth, it is hinted that the Shire, and its inhabitants, still exist to this day, but we never see them because Hobbits are so stealthy."
lotr,395t3j,Willie9,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:51:54 2015 UTC,So are there any theories on how long ago this happened on Earth? And what continent LOTR occurred on?
lotr,395t3j,ChipotleSSW,5,Mon Jun 22 17:52:51 2015 UTC,"Elbereth is the Sindarin name for Varda, Queen of the Valar. Just to give you the quick and dirty version of Tolkien's theology, Eru is indeed God, but there is a sort of subset called the Valar that holds dominion over Arda in his place. They exist in a very real tangible sense (i.e. you could go and see them, converse with them, etc.) while Eru is sort of an omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent God that created everything. So Varda (Elbereth) is Queen of the Valar, who are subservient angels/demigods who rule over Arda (the physical earth).   Prior to the Hobbits settling it, the Shire was a part of the Kingdom of Arnor (northern relatives of those who founded Gondor). The King granted them permission to settle there (it was sparsely populated by men and Arnor was in decline anyway) and they essentially became an enclave or protectorate. They acknowledged the King's lordship, and after Arnor fell, they chose a Thain to take his place.  As for a time after Hobbits, Tolkien intended his world to exist in the history of our own. The best answer I can give is that wherever the Shire is now, it's not populated by Hobbits, but by Humans.  Enjoy your read through and feel free to ask questions! You're about to step into a truly wonderful world!"
lotr,395t3j,EyeceEyeceBaby,4,Tue Jun 9 13:57:22 2015 UTC,"Everyone has been correct but more specifically, Varda created the stars above Arda and the elves that stayed in middle earth (didn't go straight to the west) revere the stars above all else."
lotr,395t3j,OGNick,2,Tue Jun 9 14:39:29 2015 UTC,"Eru is the the main Creator-god who doesn't interfere much with the world. Elbereth is one of the Valar, they are powerful spirits. The Silmarillion has their origin, but I wouldn't read that before finishing LotR.  I won't spoil anything, but a few chapters on the Hobbits meet a merry fellow, his jacket is bright blue and his boots are yellow! That fellow will also tell a bit of history, he will make a short mention of the people Willie9 was talking about. Chapters like that get better with re-reading too."

I highly recommend watching the extended versions; literally every LOTR film fan i've come across says that they are way better. The extended versions, over the course of the three movies, add 2 hours of additional scenes. If you like details, backstories, etc, you'll get a lot of them in those editions.  I personally am not a huge fan of the books, but they are good to read once in a while. There are parts of them that I really love, but other parts that I can't stand. The Hobbit (book) is much more enjoyable than the LOTR books."

lotr,396hst,JWson,0,Thu Jun 11 01:15:45 2015 UTC,"There is no ""right way"" to absorb the Lord of The Rings series. If you want a lot of lore, I suggest the Wiki or The Silmarillion. The Silmarillion is a very slow read (it's writing style is similar to the Bible). If anything, I recommend reading Ainuilndalë, the creation chapter. It's a beautiful chapter in my opinion.  The Wiki will have background lore on almost every character. One of my favorite Wiki entries is the one about Durin's Bane, a.k.a. the Balrog of Moria."
lotr,396hst,ReinierPersoon,0,Tue Jun 9 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"Personally I thought it became much more interesting after the Ainulindalë, especially when the Elves came around and the whole affair with the Noldor. I didn't find it slow either, it's actually really fast since they go over a few thousand years in one book.  I think reading the wiki before the Silmarillion will be kind of spoilery."
lotr,396hst,JWson,0,Tue Jun 9 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"I get confused easily when reading the Silmarillion because there are so many names to keep track of. There are several passages, like the introductory portions of Valaquenta, which are just listing the names of characters. They remind me of those Biblical passages where Eli begat Samson and Samson begat Joseph and Joseph begat etc. etc.  That being said, there are many Silmarillion chapters I love. The Songs of the Ainur like I mentioned before, and the Creation of the Dwarves by Aulë is another one I like."
lotr,396hst,ReinierPersoon,0,Tue Jun 9 22:41:39 2015 UTC,"Tolkien said it himself in the introduction of LotR, how different people liked different parts of the books.  I really like all the parts with Fëanor, and the bits with Húrin and the other Men, and the Fall of Númenor."
lotr,396hst,JWson,0,Tue Jun 9 23:13:29 2015 UTC,"I also thought it was really cool to read the final chapter after seeing the Hobbit films. It was surprising for me to see that all those council scenes with Galadriel, Elrond and Saruman actually came from the Silmarillion."
lotr,396hst,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:18:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is extra information in the War of the Ring part in the Silmarillion. Also in the appendices of LotR.

After escaping Thranduil he went into the mines from the eastern side of Moria and when he got to the west gate he was unable to open it.  He picked up their trail once The Company entered Moria.  You can follow most of Gollum's movements after he leaves the Misty Mountains to seek the ring in the various texts."
lotr,3928le,AmbiguousAnonymous,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:36:41 2015 UTC,He started following them in Moria. I can't remember how or why he was there in the first place.
lotr,3928le,westernwolf,-3,Mon Jun 8 19:22:58 2015 UTC,"By the time Aragon and Gandalf had tracked golem after golem's capture and release by Sauron, golem would have suspected a wizard and a dunedai to have a purpose. He'd have a fair idea a hobbit possessed the ring, that a wizard and a man were aiding him, and that their route traversed west to east from the shire to Mordor. It's stated that golem was ""picked up,"" to paraphrase, in the mines but it seems to me this was no chance coincidence. IIRC Moria is the first time frodo perceives golem's presence. (I.e. Two lights far off like eyes and faint pattering of feet, again, to poorly paraphrase). However, the fellowship's path is we'll known. (e.g. Saurumon casts spells to heed tfotr's passing through the mountain pass) and it is implied that golem is on the errand of Sauron, I think he is privy to this information so as to aide him in his quest for the recapture of the ring.  Given this information given to or acquired by golem, I suspect his encounter with tfotr happened on the outskirts of Rivendale's domain. Continued on their passage through Lothlorien, and onto Moria. Indeed, warriors and scouts of Lothlorien recall seeing the creature golem amidst their pursuit of the orcs on the border after tfotr's arrival in Lothlorien.  It would be a smarter person than I to precisely work out the details I've proposed as support to my claim, but I'm fairly sure ive hit the broad strokes. Could be that I haven't, and sorry if so."
lotr,3928le,Turbohat,7,Mon Jun 8 20:08:44 2015 UTC,"Setting aside the fact that Tolkien explicitly noted when and where Gollum was when he began following Frodo, there are a few problems with your idea. The Fellowship was discovered after they departed by Crebain flying overhead, it wasn't known in advance so neither Sauron nor Saruman could have given Gollum this information ahead of time. It's actually left a little ambiguous in the text regarding who or what causes the weather on the mountain. Gimli seems to think it's not Sauron or Saruman, but Caradhras ""the Cruel"" itself that's attacking them and Gandalf comments that Sauron's arm has grown long. It's an invention of the films that Saruman chanted some spell to bar the Fellowships passage. Also, the Fellowship reaches Lothlorien after Moria, not before."
lotr,3928le,EyeceEyeceBaby,5,Mon Jun 8 20:35:26 2015 UTC,Yeah you're totally right. Lothlorien is where they received the boats. Gandalf was not with them at Lothlorien. Damn. Thanks for the correction. Sorry to anyone that bothered to read my comment.
lotr,3928le,Turbohat,-4,Mon Jun 8 20:43:30 2015 UTC,I believe he was following them already. He was let loose after Frodo when they finished torturing him.
lotr,3938so,flameofuldun,2,Mon Jun 8 22:59:58 2015 UTC,"I would do hobbit, lotr, silmarillion, children of hurin then lost tales. But they are separate stories. You can really read them in any order."
lotr,3938so,Jpgriffiths97,3,Mon Jun 8 23:10:12 2015 UTC,Did you mean Book of Lost Tales? Or Unfinished Tales? Usually Unfinished Tales comes next.
lotr,3938so,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:52:41 2015 UTC,"When I read books now, I keep a notebook with each book to take notes of names, dates, places, facts, etc so I can remember/reference them later rather than depending on my crappy memory. Should I do that with TH/LOTR or simply with the following books as they're more historical (as I've been told)?   I'd like to just read TH/LOTR for pleasure as stories but don't want to miss any facts (maybe those facts are in the other books as well?).  Thank you both for the help."
lotr,3938so,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Wed Jun 10 12:19:24 2015 UTC,"Well as for the notebook I suppose it's really just up to you, but if you've got a copy of LotR I suggest flipping to the back of Return of the King to get a feel for the information contained in the Appendices. Here are two pages from Appendix B: Tale of Years (Here). As you can see, Tolkien was rather meticulous in his detail, not just in documenting the events concurrent with the text, but the whole history of his world.  Going off of what you've said, I think you'd be okay reading The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings for pleasure, without notation as there is a good deal of information neatly organized in the Appendices. That timeline is just a taste, like I said if you have copies take look. You'll find histories, fleshing out of stories, timelines, notation on Tolkien's various languages, and quite a few family trees. As for The Silmarillion and all the other works in Tolkien's legendarium, making some notes might be a good idea. The Silmarillion is a bit more complex, luckily it has a nice index as well to help you reference names when you get lost, but personal notes could be very helpful as well."
lotr,3938so,cphuntington97,2,Wed Jun 10 13:20:34 2015 UTC,"Awesome. That helps, thanks. I've a history and English university degree so I'm not opposed to putting in extra work by taking notes to learn everything. It's just somewhat daunting to approach initially without a clear plan of attack for my brain to grasp. Like I said, this definitely helps.  Thanks again."
lotr,3938so,biggest_decision,2,Wed Jun 10 16:59:53 2015 UTC,The Hobbit is easy and fast and will spur you on to the larger works.
lotr,3938so,piejesudomine,2,Mon Jun 8 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"The hobbit works alright as an intro to Lotr proper, but has a very different tone to the rest. It is really short though, and you can probably read it in a couple of days without difficulty. If you can't be bothered with the childish nature of it, it is possible to skip straight to the Fellowship, and you won't miss out on much if you know the story already.  If audiobooks are your thing, I can wholeheartedly recommend the fan made reading at www.phildragash.com, it has a level of quality that goes above and beyond every professional production I have heard, on every level. Not only that, but the text has been set to the film score where appropriate, and it really brings the books to life. I always found that LOTR felt very dry, but when set with the wonderful film score it really is something else.  I am hesitant to say this, and I would never say this about anything else, but that audio version of LOTR is actually better than the original text in my opinion. Even if you have read the series before, I wholeheartedly recommend checking it out."

lotr,390wqq,flameofuldun,0,Thu Jun 18 02:52:48 2015 UTC,"Preface: I am no LOTR scholar, merely a lover and studier of it. I do, however, have a university degree in WW2 history.  That said, this is regarding the correlation of the book and the Great War.  I know this is a debatable opinion and I don't claim it as fact, but I've always assumed Tolkien so vehemently denied (more specifically) The Hobbit's ties with Hitler, Nazism, (etc.) because of Herr Goebbels.  Goebbels had a Ph.D. in Germanic literature (and we all know Tolkien pulled from Germanic myth/fairy tales for The Hobbit) and was hell-bent on pushing his ""Hitler myth"" - the theory that Hitler was infallible, omniscient, a true world leader like no other.  Goebbels was without a doubt the best propaganda expert of history. He sought out authors, musicians, poets, etc. in Germany whose works even REMOTELY could possibly reference Hitler or Nazism negatively and had them killed. The German Student Union were ruthless in their systematic book burnings in Germany in the 1930s. This no doubt was in every writer's mind at the time.  Now I know the Nazi/Hitler correlations tie more in with LOTR (which was written after Hitler's death) than with TH, but Tolkien did use a lot of Germanic culture as underlying basis for the tales. It's something that Goebbels would've easily picked up on had he even known about the book. (I know TH was published in 1937 in London so it was at least around while Hitler was growing his empire; I have no idea if Goebbels knew about TH - he did have a 15 yo stepson, a 3 yo, 2 yo, and <1 yo by 1937 so there's at least a good bet that he could've known of it as a children's tale).  If Tolkien wanted his book to do well or to be accepted in his time (with millions embracing Nazism), there's a good bet he would openly denounce any and ALL ""hidden meaning"" whether The Hobbit was allegorical or not.  *like I said, not fact but my thoughts."
lotr,390wqq,ebneter,3,Mon Jun 8 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"The Lord of the Rings was published after Hitler's death; it was written before and during the war.  Tolkien's denunciation of allegorical interpretations of The Lord of the Rings (not The Hobbit) appear in the Second Edition, published in the mid-1960s, long after the war.  I'm afraid your idea is pretty deeply flawed."
lotr,390wqq,flameofuldun,0,Tue Jun 9 05:43:26 2015 UTC,"That's why I stated my thoughts were based mostly on The Hobbit, not LOTR as LOTR wasn't out and published until afterwards.   Hence why I stressed the basis of Germanic fairy tales in TH."
lotr,390wqq,ebneter,2,Tue Jun 9 14:42:54 2015 UTC,"My point is that Tolkien never said any such things about The Hobbit, though."

lotr,38wj3u,ichosethis,29,Sun Jun 7 13:36:52 2015 UTC,"To expand on this, in LotR, appendix C, it notes that because of Gandalf, two sons of the Old Took (Isengar and Hildifons Took) ran off on adventures. One never returned to the Shire, the other went as far as the sea! Hobbits would have obviously looked down on this 'negative' influence on the youth, especially on a family as prominent as the Tooks (who hold the position of the Thain of the Shire, a great honor!)"

lotr,38wj3u,tilled,36,Sun Jun 7 21:35:53 2015 UTC,Simply coming into the Shire and discussing news of the far outside world is probably enough to be considered a disturber of the peace by the xenophobic hobbits.
lotr,38wj3u,rainmaninjapan,13,Mon Jun 8 00:39:26 2015 UTC,"I think it was summed up best by the older hobbit in the Green Dragon (yeah, I'm shit with names) -  ""It's not our problem what goes on outside our borders. Keep your nose out of trouble and no trouble will come to you.""  Gandalf encouraged them to leave (like other commenters said) and that was seen as mischievous in and of itself."
lotr,38wj3u,flameofuldun,6,Sun Jun 7 15:09:04 2015 UTC,i was always thought this was more Frodo making fun of Gandalf than something that actually happened.  do we think there was really a meeting?
lotr,38wj3u,uisge-beatha,39,Sun Jun 7 19:30:12 2015 UTC,"The conversation goes a little differently in the book. Gandalf is the one what brings up being called a 'disturber of the peace':   ‘I did mean to – but I have had to change my mind. I may be away for a good while; but I’ll come and see you again, as soon as I can. Expect me when you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan’t often be visiting the Shire openly again. I find that I have become rather unpopular. They say I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace. Some people are actually accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away, or worse. If you want to know, there is supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth.’"
lotr,38x6hz,stumpane,38,Sun Jun 7 16:33:32 2015 UTC,"""You cannot pass,"" he said. … ""I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.""   The Secret Fire could refer to the Flame Imperishable, which is what Eru, who is God, has and uses to give sentience to Life. Gandalf is an emissairy of the Valar, who are loyal servants of Eru.  Anor is the Sun. I don't know what the Flame of Anor is specifically. Maybe it's Narya, the Ring of Fire.  Flame of Udun refers to Utumno, or called Udun, which was Morgoth's original fortress. Morgoth is the original Dark Lord and the Balrog is explicitly refered to as a Balrog of Morgoth by Legolas.  Udun also refers to a region of Mordor, probably named in tribute to Sauron's old boss."
lotr,38x6hz,Xecellseor,21,Sun Jun 7 16:39:53 2015 UTC,"Flame of Anor is not referencing Narya. It is representing simply the opposition of their fires. The language, in earlier forms, far predates Tolkien giving Narya to Gandalf."

lotr,38x6hz,InTheAtticToTheLeft,32,Sun Jun 7 16:54:42 2015 UTC,"He very much is. Gandalf is also a maia associated with fire; Tolkien wrote this in connection with his opposition to Sauron, but it applies with the balrog as well: ""Warm and eager was his spirit (and it was enhanced by the ring Narya), for he was the Enemy of Sauron, opposing the fire that devours and wastes with the fire that kindles, and succours in wanhope and distress; but his joy, and his swift wrath, were veiled in garments grey as ash, so that only those that knew him well glimpsed the flame that was within"""
lotr,38x6hz,Edledhron,-8,Sun Jun 7 17:34:51 2015 UTC,"Flame of Arnor is referencing Narya. Also OP if you're reading, Narya is one of the 3 elven rings, and Gandalf is wearing it."

lotr,38x6hz,Xecellseor,11,Sun Jun 7 19:00:40 2015 UTC,"A bit of trivia from The Treason of Isengard. When Tolkien first wrote this speech of Gandalf's he had him say (the struck out part was probably crossed out just after he wrote it):   You cannot pass. Go back into the fiery depths. It is forbidden for any Balrog to come beneath the sky since Fionwë overthrew Thangorodorim. I am the master of White Fire. The red flame cannot come this way.   In a subsequent draft he wrote it:   You cannot pass. I am the master of White Flame. Neither Red Fire nor Black Shadow can The Red Fire cannot come this way. Go back to the Shadow!   What to make of these things is another question. Udûn/Utumno was Morgoth's first fortress. It is also the Sindarin/Quenya word for ""Hell"", although I've never been sure what exactly Hell is supposed to mean for the Elves.  The HoMe books I have don't say anything about when ""secret fire"", Flame of Anor, and Udûn were added to the text, but I don't have all the books. I would guess that ""Flame of Anor"" and ""flame of Udûn"" are essentially substitutions for the ""White Fire"" and ""Red Fire"" of the earlier drafts. I usually think of ""Secret Fire"" as being something like the Holy Spirit of Christianity—the creative lifeforce of Eru/God. From that perspective, White Fire (flame of Anor) and Red Fire (flame of Udûn) strike me as something like ""heavenly light/power"" and ""hellish light/power"".  The somewhat Christian way of looking at it seems strengthened by Udûn meaning ""Hell"" and Gandalf calling the Balrog a ""demon"" [edit: Damn, Gandalf only calls the Balrog a ""demon"" in the movie, not the book. I hate it when I mix them up like that!]. A Christian rewording might go something like: I am a servant of God, a powerful Angel. You cannot pass. Your being a demon won't let you get past me, go to Hell!"
lotr,38x6hz,ScallopOolong,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"Also something I've found interesting is every other person/being who had defeated a balrog had done so through double suicide. Several had fought a balrog (most notably Gothmog), but had either been killed outright (Fëanor, Hurin, Turgon, Fingon), or had only defeated the balrog by a double suicide (Ecthelion, Glorifindel).  So by the fellowship choosing to go through Moria, to me I've always thought that meant Gandalf MUST have known they'd either all be killed by Durin's Bane or he'd have to sacrifice himself for everyone else (which he does). Interesting thought anyway."
lotr,38x6hz,flameofuldun,9,Sun Jun 7 19:41:36 2015 UTC,The problem with your thought is that none of them knew there was a Balrog in Moria.

lotr,38x6hz,Uluithiad,0,Sun Jun 7 20:20:41 2015 UTC,"Tolkein leaves it unclear whether Sauron knew about Durin's Bane (and most of the outside world for that matter), but those in Lothlórien did know (which is why I think/assume Gandalf knew).  ""The Dwarves attempted to fight the Balrog, but its power was far too great. Despite their efforts to hold Khazad-dûm against it, King Náin and many of the Dwarves were killed, and the survivors were forced to flee.

lotr,38x6hz,Edledhron,2,Sun Jun 7 21:28:26 2015 UTC,Is there a wiki-type app that pulls from the books better than LOTR wikia? (Asking seriously)
lotr,38x6hz,flameofuldun,7,Sun Jun 7 22:16:04 2015 UTC,"Most wikis are better than LotR Wikia. Even wikipedia is a more trustworthy source that that site. However, none are perfect, and there's really no substitute for the books.  The Encyclopedia of Arda is the most accurate of the online reference sites - it's not a wiki, and it basically ignores the existence of anything which is not The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion. That actually does pose some issues when going beyond material in the former two works, but it isn't a huge concern for casual fans. The other big draw back is that the articles tend to be a bit sparse.  Tolkien Gateway is somewhat better than Wikia, and more expansive than EoA.   Really your best bet if you don't want to read is to just pay attention to what gets said on this site (particularly /r/tolkienfans, /r/lotr, and /r/asksciencefiction). Even when answering some basic questions, often times users here will include more expansive information to provide context and fun facts. In the event that someone does post misinformation, that tends to be corrected by someone else very quickly."

He says in the Lord of the Rings that he travelled to both Rohan and Gondor and performed services for their lords under the guise of Thorongil.   1) Served King Thengel of Rohan (Théoden's father) although Tolkien does not make it clear in what capacity other than that ""... he was a great leader of men ...""  Knowing how proud the Rohirrim are, you know Thorongil was an absolute badass to be accepted by them in a leadership role despite not being born in the Riddermark.  2) Served Steward Ecthelion II as a counselor and battle captain, where he ""... gathered a small fleet, and he came to Umbar unlooked for by night, and there burned a great part of the ships of the Corsairs. He himself overthrew the Captain of the Haven in battle upon the quays, and then he withdrew his fleet with small loss.""  It is also known that he counseled the Steward of Gondor to trust Gandalf rather than Saruman, and was begrudged by Ecthelion II's son and the future Steward, Denethor II.  3) Declining the great honors awaiting him in Minas Tirith, Thorongil ""... took boat and crossed over Anduin, and there he said farewell to his companions and went on alone; and when he was last seen his face was towards the Mountains of Shadow.""  Although I have nothing but rank speculation to back me up, I conjecture that Aragorn/Thorongil traveled to Ithilien and made contact with the Rangers of Ithilien in or around Emyn Arnen.   Taken from http://www.quora.com/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-creative-franchise/Who-really-was-Thorongil-the-mysterious-man-mentioned-in-the-appendix-A-of-the-LOTR  Just enough of a framework to make a game out of.  Edit: The end can have Aragorn actually travelling to Mordor and seeing Barad-dur with his own eyes and the might of Sauron he begins to understand that no strength of arms can ever defeat Sauron, thus priming him for the Quest with the One Ring.  http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/85480/did-aragorn-and-gandalf-ever-venture-into-mordor  There seems to be some evidence suggesting Aragorn has been to Mordor."
lotr,38x6vj,Xecellseor,3,Sun Jun 7 17:58:17 2015 UTC,"The end can have Aragorn actually travelling to Mordor and seeing Barad-dur with his own eyes and the might of Sauron he begins to understand that no strength of arms can ever defeat Sauron, thus priming him for the Quest with the One Ring.   Perhaps it would be a nice segue but then it wouldn't be canon. Aragorn spent a good deal of time very near to Mordor, but it's highly unlikely he ever would have been within sight of Barad-dur. It was rebuilt shortly before he began his journeys, and it seems to me he would have had a difficult time entering Mordor, travelling deep enough to be within sight of the tower, and then exiting would be a recklessly difficult task. If he had entered Mordor, I imagine he would have made some mention of it during the Quest, knowing that this knowledge would be key to the success of the mission since he alone had been there before.  The quoted text in your link says ""on the dark confines,"" which is explained by the author of the post thus:   This is not, it must be emphasised[sic], hard evidence that Aragorn was actually in Mordor; ""confines"" in this context means ""borders"", but it is the closest that we have and it is entirely possible that he did enter (it is equally as possible that he did not).   The author of that post began by stating ""There is evidence that Aragorn may have done so,"" and proceeded to state that it's a 50/50 shot that he actually did. That's speculation, not evidence. As I said, if he had been to Mordor it would have been rather shortsighted of him not to mention it at the Council of Elrond, or at the very least during the journey. His knowledge would have been invaluable to the Quest."

You can go from clearing out a village of burglars or marauders to fishing in a small pond near that massive tree at the start of LOTR: Fellowship of The Ring.   I know not many people can get into mmo's but as a devout Middle Earth fan (at least I like to think I am) I can say at least give this a try. The guys behind it seem to really care about the world they've built and community to who they share it."

lotr,38x6vj,mtanva,3,Mon Jun 8 13:50:30 2015 UTC,"I feel you, but the problem is that LOTR isn't like TES where its an open world with crazy stuff happening all the time in all parts of the globe. Its a fairly peaceful world with occasional magic and occasional wars that sometimes has periods of time highlighted by various things dealing with the Maiar and Sauron. Generally speaking, its a fairly peaceful world most of the time, which doesn't make for great gameplay. Similar groups have the same feeling, so many people beg for a good Harry Potter video game, but it just woulden't really fit with the story and world.   LOTRO had a good idea where your character is acting seemingly ""Behind the scenes"" of the fellowship. Like the secret extra member thats never too far behind. However, because of this, you can kind of tell some parts are just kind of thrown in, or you feel like you're not really doing anything. Like you go talk to Radagast and he says basically ""Hey there are a bunch of wights over here do you wanna kill them? Or else they'll do bad things probably"". Like even though what you're doing would be useful and all, you just end up so emotionally distant from it that it just becomes hit lists of how many goblins you need to slay.   Shadows Of Mordor tried to make its own story and was pretty good, but as you said, it sometimes felt far away from the original trilogy."
lotr,38x6vj,TD-Eagles,3,Mon Jun 8 02:49:01 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, its a fairly peaceful world most of the time   A look through appendix b will show how absurd that statement is for the Third Age. There are two periods of about 400 years each where, yeah, it is pretty peaceful. Apart from those, you have near constant Easterling and corsair invasions, evil stirrings in Greenwood (which is renamed to Mirkwood), civil wars in Arnor and Gondor, the invasions of the descendent kingdoms of Arnor by Angmar, the Wainriders, the balrog's appearance in Moria, more stirrings in Mirkwood, orcs invading Gondor, the Misty Mountains, and Eriador, the Dunlending attacks in Rohan, Smaug's attack, the War of the Dwarves and the Orcs, the siege on Dol Guldur, and evil beings generally throughout all of Middle-earth by the later years of the Third Age. The point is, there's a reason why everything seems to be in a big state of decline during the War of the Ring. Sauron stayed on the sidelines, but his servants and forces were constantly breaking down his foes. The Second Age was generally more peaceful, though it had its share of massive and significant conflicts as well. The First was even worse than the Third.  There's a lot of opportunity there for an open world RPG. No, it's not going to be quite as flashy as a follow-the-fellowship game (which LotRO is not at all the first in doing). But I think that's a good thing. If there were some other big huge event on that scale, or heroes who could rival the fellowship, I find it hard to believe that they wouldn't have been noted down in the tale of years (which in Tolkien's lore, follows the conceit that he is merely 'translating' a work in the world). I'd much rather see stories truly just 'fill in the blank' for what we already have, and not grossly contradict Tolkien or suppose events that really would have been noted down."

The Estate would not like that. Seeing its reaction to the movies. Easier to ask the Estate for game rights than for movie rights for The Silmarillion. 4) If fans are not getting the movie, a good game will satisfy them. This would also mean that the game should have no problem of profitable returns as there will be many to buy them. Esp an open-world type. 5) If not the above then maybe a part of The Silmarillion?

Remember to leave space for the front yard space! Pile the soil so that the picture leans to it. Plant some flowers if you like. Overlay the soil with moss. Secure it to the soil with some iron wire. Decorate! I used little rocks for the road, little party flags and chopsticks as poles,  string and toothpicks to make the fence and dollhouse items such as chair, watering can and teacup.

(which is a point in your favor cause it's all bollocks)  Then read the Venturebeat article and it literally has an entire section for how they aren't going to stick strictly to the lore and it's more making the world sound and feel like Tolkien.

Middle-earth Enterprises vetted all of Monolith’s ideas and scripts before sending back any notes.      ‘Here’s what we want to do with Celebrimbor, and here’s why we think it fits within the canon. … It doesn’t conflict with anything,’” said Roberts. “‘It’s not trying to tell a different version than what’s out there. It’s filling in some gaps, and sort of illuminating a part of the past that people don’t know about, or wasn’t written about. …’      he’s helping keep us grounded in terms of not going off the deep end, lore-wise, but keeping that lore as part of the underlying structure of how the world works   The only point the article makes against the lore is that, no, it isn't 'officially' canon, but that isn't something I've said the developers have claimed.

lotr,38s4dl,Lam0rak,12,Sat Jun 6 22:02:18 2015 UTC,"It's not ridiculous at all. Actually, there is very little that the game gets right.    The central character doesn't belong in any aspect. He couldn't have been brought back to life. He couldn't have been a ranger on the watch of the Black Gate this late into the Third Age. He couldn't get magical powers from a houseless elf (erroneously termed a 'wraith') co-inhabiting his body. On the topic of magic, the kind it portrays is entirely out of consistency with Tolkien's descriptions of magic in his world. The history the game presents is all kinds of wrong. It stomps on Tolkien's lore every which way so that whatever grains of accuracy there are get lost in the dunes of misinformation. As a few chief examples, Gollum shouldn't have been in Mordor at this time, Sauron should be incarnate in his own body, and everything regarding Celebrimbor is just wrong The Gorgoroth they present is far too green, especially in that opening cinematic. There are numerous other geographical errors (and no, I'm not just talking about them making up places). The orcs are not at all like Tolkien's orcs, and their portrayal of the people of Núrn is entirely their invention."

My plan was to wait for it to go on sale, then just play through it ignoring any pretense that it was supposed to be Middle-earth (an approach I adopted for War in the North). By all accounts, it is a very fun game as its own thing. However, the developers' continued insistence that the game is faithful and authentic got a little too on my nerves, so I scrapped that plan. I think that's a rather scummy marketing tactic, and vote with your wallet and all that. And I don't pirate software, so that wasn't an avenue for me."

lotr,38s4dl,Lam0rak,3,Sun Jun 7 10:00:11 2015 UTC,"The game supposedly being faithful to the lore really was a big selling point for the pr department. It was everywhere - every interview, every pr gig, they were really trying to pass it off as Middle-earth. It wasn't an occasional 'Oh yeah, we really enjoy the stories and wanted to play around the world.' From the get go, it was 'we're serious about being authentic to the lore.' It comes off to me as being more about the brand selling than actually caring that much about faithfulness.

lotr,38s4dl,Edledhron,5,Sat Jun 6 11:39:04 2015 UTC,Get over it! It's an incredibly well done game and it isn't trying to claim that it is 100% faithful to the lore.
lotr,38s4dl,Sharkey311,10,Sat Jun 6 20:05:11 2015 UTC,Actually the developers have done just that.
lotr,38s4dl,Edledhron,-3,Sat Jun 6 22:17:28 2015 UTC,Please supply me with a link where they said that it was 100% faithful to the lore.
lotr,38s4dl,Sharkey311,6,Sun Jun 7 02:10:45 2015 UTC,"PCG: It must be tough to reconcile the influences of the films and the novels. Is the game more influenced by the films or has the studio taken its own route, consulting the novels first and foremost?  Phil: Authenticity is a word Michael and I use over and over again. Everything needed to feel like it was from the lore and consistent to the lore and authentic to the lore, but to take that one step closer, we needed everything to be authentic in terms of how a real world would be presented. In a way, we thought about our world and the presentation as if it were a historical piece. This is not a high fantasy game, it's not a high fantasy IP, and we just really wanted to make sure that everything was right.    http://www.pcgamer.com/shadow-of-mordor-interview/  Do note the use of 'everything.'"
lotr,38s4dl,Edledhron,-6,Sun Jun 7 02:42:14 2015 UTC,"Not once did they say the game is 100% faithful to the Lore. All they said is what they wanted not what they achieved.  You also failed to include the rest of the quote:   For example, we really wanted to make sure the foliage was realistic relative to the type of foliage which would grow in a volcanic area, and we wanted to make sure geography was authentic and was consistent with an area with volcanic activity. The team did some on-location shoots in Eastern Washington, which is awesome for us because it has quite a lot of volcanic history. There's a place called the Columbia River plateau where there's all kinds of volcanic activity, floods and so forth. We looked at yellow stone for the world, we looked at some photography from Iceland and New Zealand. The lore was important, but we also wanted to take that further and present the world in a way that had never been seen before. There's only so much of Middle-Earth which has been visualised in the films, so we wanted to take that and present something visually new.   Their examples of authenticity was about foliage and geography. They even go as far to say that even though the lore was important, they wanted to expound on it."
lotr,38s4dl,Sharkey311,7,Sun Jun 7 02:54:00 2015 UTC,"All they said is what they wanted not what they achieved.   Technically what they said was what they 'needed,' but any of those are clearly being pedantic. No, they literally did not say 'The game is 100% faithful to the lore,' but I assumed that you would see that they came actually extraordinarily close to saying just that. Sorry for not playing that close to the rules.   You also failed to include the rest of the quote   I didn't 'fail' to include it, as if it's necessary. It's not, it's added information which does not alter or take away from the core point of the quote:   Everything needed to feel like it was from the lore and consistent to the lore and authentic to the lore   There is your '100% faithfulness.' Everything else is superfluous.  In fact, what they say is that their landscape designs are taking it ""take that one step closer"" and ""one step further."" They are not, in that quote, even saying they wanted to expand on the lore*, they have moved on and are solely talking about their art design at that point.  And by the way, whether or not they literally stated that it's '100% faithful' is really isn't important. They've made a huge push for their game to be considered 'faithful,' 'authentic,' etc. Whether or not that's 100% or 90% or 75% doesn't really matter when I would describe their game as closer to 10% authentic.  * Even if they did mean expanding on the lore here, which is something they've talked about doing in other interviews, that would not take away the point. One can 'expand' the lore and still be faithful to it - it involves the creation of fan fiction which is in line with the tone and events of Tolkien's lore, which is something that could be done. This game is not an example of that, though. Not in the slightest."
lotr,38s4dl,Edledhron,-6,Sun Jun 7 03:29:07 2015 UTC,"Fucking purists. Make you're own game that is 100% faithful and see how successful it is. If you want any future LotR content to be as faithful as you want it to be to the canon, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Give me an example of something that has come out that is 100% faithful to Tolkien's work that isn't something he wrote?  Is there any point in complaining about movies and games based on LotR? His canon doesn't translate well to other mediums and sometimes to make something engaging and good you need to deviate from the source material."

There was a mod for Medieval Total War 2 where they at least made a very good effort to remain as true to the source material as possible and they did a good job. The most obvious non-canon thing is that they decided to base the artwork/models on the movies, but that made sense because it was a group effort, so everyone agrees on what things look like."

lotr,38s4dl,AmbiguousAnonymous,-3,Sun Jun 7 02:35:38 2015 UTC,"Being one who played the game, I'm confident the devs didn't make this game purely to capitalize money using a famous brand. There was a lot of passion put into the game and it's a shame purists give it so much flack."
lotr,38s4dl,Seraphtheol,5,Sun Jun 7 02:38:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't say that was 'purely' the reason they made the game.  I am also confident that isn't the case.  However, the game is trying to capitalize on that potential fan baseline.  To then not try and integrate the two with integrity it becomes more a mark of being lazy.  Purists are purists for a reason: the real stuff is simply better.  Its pure.  I would rather see dev's invest in their own world and narrative to share with us then to carve up one that was fine before hand.  Its cool that you like the game, and I understand that.  But hopefully I've provided some perspective."
lotr,38s4dl,Sharkey311,4,Sun Jun 7 04:35:11 2015 UTC,"The amount of time and effort spent on the game doesn't change the fact that taking established canon then radically changing it doesn't allow you to call the resulting property ""canon"" or ""true to canon"". Otherwise  could apply the same terms to every single piece of fanfiction even vaguely related to the original property, so long as it involves even a mere smidgen of canon material"

lotr,38s4dl,ebneter,-2,Sun Jun 7 04:31:55 2015 UTC,Tell me how it isn't based on Tolkien's work? Because they added characters that aren't in the books? They added some mythos that don't correlate to what Tolkien wrote?  Never mind the characters in the game that are canon. Never mind the locations that are canon.
lotr,38s4dl,Uluithiad,8,Sun Jun 7 04:46:18 2015 UTC,"Using names of characters and locations is about all that they did. Seriously, you could change the names and almost nothing else about the game would have to change.  There was a fan-fiction a few years ago for the reimagined series Battlestar Galactica which featured characters and scenarios so far removed from the actual series that several of us said the author could change the names, and very little else, and publish it, because no one would ever know that it came from the BSG universe. Eventually, she did exactly that. Shadow of Mordor is like that, I'm afraid. It doesn't mean it's a bad game any more than it meant that the story was bad. (It was, but that was not because of the lack of faithfulness to the source material.)"
lotr,38s4dl,danymsk,8,Sun Jun 7 04:56:13 2015 UTC,"Naming locations after canon locations and attributing concepts to them that are against canon make those locations non-canon, not canon. If you call a gerbil a giraffe, that doesn't make it so."

lotr,38s4dl,redbirdsfan,5,Sat Jun 6 11:43:35 2015 UTC,"The actual in game explanation for how the guy came to have wraith powers:  ""You're banished from death, cast adrift in the worlds between light and dark. Curse (binds?) us together within the walls of Arda.""  What??  That's it! One barely audible sentence to gloss over the entire premise of the game. Fuck the developers of this game, they knew they were shitting over the lore, which is why they skipped any sort of explanation of 'Wraith man' (they literally couldn't without making up more shit), and still said in every press release that they were being faithful. Now people actually believe shit like this is possible in Tolkien's Legendarium.   Sauron apparently now has the power to stop the gift of men (death), and he does this just by cursing them?   What a load of shite."
lotr,38s4dl,omgu8mynewt,13,Sat Jun 6 12:07:18 2015 UTC,"Terrible lore, but still a pretty fun game."
lotr,38s4dl,Edledhron,2,Sat Jun 6 16:47:43 2015 UTC,"How did he stop the Nazgul kings dying then? I liked this game and assume the same thing happened to your character in the game as happened to the Nazgul, except they were brainwashed to follow Sauron too, whereas you weren't.  Fantastic game, loads of fun to play. Have you played? You're a human man of Gondor Talion guarding Mordor who dies but it kept undead, in a body shared with Celembrimbor the elf wraith who previously worked with Sauron. The story really drew me into Tolkiens world even if its not exactly the same."
lotr,38s4dl,sakor88,9,Sat Jun 6 16:15:32 2015 UTC,"First, not all of the Ringwraiths were kings. Secondly, they had their lives extended through the Rings (similar to Gollum, and to a lesser extent Bilbo and Frodo) until they faded and were bound to the One.  This is very different from what this game says happened to Talion, which is that he died and a houseless elf brought him back to life. This was impossible for any man, save the sole exclusion of Beren. That involved the most beautiful elf, half divine, to sing the most sorrowful song ever sung, the gods to take up the matter, and God himself to give his blessing, and as Tolkien clearly stated in a couple points, was a one time deal.  Note that there is a difference between being brought back to life and lingering in different forms. The Ringwraiths never died, until the final days of the War of the Ring - the connection between their spirits and bodies were never broken. The Dead never came back to life - they remained as spirits following their death until their curse was lifted. The Barrow Wights were not men brought back to life, but only fell spirits reanimating corpses. And do note that the developers have been perfectly consistent in saying that Talion was killed and resurrected, so there's no wiggle room there."

The only way they still exist is because they are tied to Sauron.  They have no freewill.  They are servants.  Talion was not corrupted by a ring therefore tends to suggest he shouldn't be a wraith at all, and if he had been he would've been a servant of Sauron, not fighting against him.   I played the game and loved the gameplay, but any of the lore made me cringe and feel deeply saddened by how unfaithful it is to the true lore.  Also Celebrimbor was killed after lots of torment and torture by Sauron.  And if I remember correctly, his body was crucified and carried into battle against Celebrimbor's kin.  He was not corrupted, bent or broken to Sauron's will since in all the time he was tortured he never gave away the location of the three elven rings."
lotr,38s4dl,Nimtolien712,6,Sat Jun 6 16:55:37 2015 UTC,"The Ringwraiths weren't spirits. They were corporeal, though their bodies were invisible.   his body was crucified and carried into battle against Celebrimbor's kin   I'm pretty sure that didn't happen."

lotr,38s4dl,Nimtolien712,2,Sat Jun 6 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"The Nazgul were given rings of power, and through the use of the 1 ring, sauron turned them into wraiths and bound them to his will. Another human couldn't be ""cursed"". He'd have to have one of the 9 or 7, and sauron would have to be in possession of the 1 ring. At that time, he would have no will to oppose Sauron."

lotr,38rv64,MatttheM,8,Sat Jun 6 07:23:50 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of both, along with other factors such as one's own ability to be corrupted.  Tom Bombadil possessed no ambition whatsoever, and the Ring wouldn't have any effect on him even over a very significant period of time. If it could have an effect on him in the Sammath Naur is an interesting question, but I personally suspect not.  Gollum began his ownership of the Ring with murder, and was already not a very pleasant person. He was corrupted quickly by the Ring even at a fairly significant distance from Mordor, and it only got worse from there on over hundreds of years.  Bilbo began his ownership of the Ring with pity, and so was spared some of its effects. Many decades later, and he's able to give it up willingly far away from Mordor.  Frodo had 17 years with the Ring, but it doesn't seem to bother him all that much until he gets nearer to Mordor. In the Sammath Naur, it would be impossible (again, we'll have to wonder about Tom Bombadil) for anyone to resist it, and so he succumbs.   As for if the Thundercats could do it, possibly if there was someone on their team who was as pure in thought as Tom Bombadil - but that would require them to be pacifistic at the very least. The alternative would be if Eru arranged for them to bear the Ring, similar to Frodo, and if they are able to virtuously fulfill their quest through some means that would come about."

I do agree that the length of time spent in proximity to the ring does have it's hold on you grow stronger, that's undeniable. But it's not purely that. The ring uses your own weaknesses to control your mind it made Boromir think about how it could be used to defend his people (probably so that when it was brought out it could make its bearer give it to Sauron). The ring is presented as having its own will (it does have part of Sauron in it, think about the horcruxes in Harry Potter). Examples can be seen in how it makes Frodo want to put it on when the wraiths are around; the paranoia that it inflicts on its bearers that it will be stolen (Gollum plays on this on the stairs to get Frodo to send Sam away) as well as the way it makes itself really heavy for Frodo (you can see the marks that the chain makes on his skin before Cirith Ungol) but then Sam has no trouble carrying it in terms of weight shows how the ring can manipulate itself.

The ring is often characterised as having a will of its own, so it can influence a persons mind. The ring appears to have it's strongest affect around those who would seek to return it to Sauron, such as around the ringwraiths Frodo feels the need to put it on. Edledhron did a pretty good job of fleshing it out so i don't see the need to say much more. I don't know about the Thundercats, but I would be tempted on my limited knowledge of the Flash to say that it's very hard to tell. He seems quite strong willed so might be less likely to succumb to the ring in the short period. But he also does have his own defects that the ring could exploit, and the fact that it can change its weight could slow the Flash down as we don't know how strong it could make itself on the Flash's mind (remember its not a physical weight as Sam wasn't affected by the ring in the same way carrying Frodo up the side of the mountain).

So, even when they are slain or lay down their life in grief, their spirits travel to the Halls of Mandos to wait for that or, in some cases, after some time to be returned to life in new bodies. It is unknown what will happen to them after the End. It just so happens that Mandos is over in the Undying Lands already to the fact that there are a bunch of Elves who went to live there without the dying part is handy if not exactly coincidental.  Men, on the other hand, have a different kind of unknown fate. They are not tied to the created world and are fated to die and to leave it entirely. It is unknown what happens to them after that point, but it is assumed that it is a good thing and a gift from Ilúvatar.  Hobbits are explicitly an offshoot of Man and therefore share the same fate.  Dwarves were a separate creation by the smith Vala, Aulë. He grew impatient for the coming of the Children and to have students to teach crafts, so he made his own. This didn't work, exactly, since Aulë did not have the ability to give his creation souls to animate them independently from his own will. Ilúvatar confronted him for overstepping his limits, but when Aulë showed genuine contrition, the Dwarves were granted true life by Ilúvatar. We don't know exactly what happens to them when they die, but among themselves they hope that there is a special part of Mandos set aside for them and it also seems like their souls might be recycled somewhat (many Durins have been seen as being the reincarnation of the original Durin, for example).  The ""Undying Lands"" do not grant immortality (that was a deceit that Sauron used to trick the Numenoreans, to their downfall), but are simply named for the immortal inhabitants. The Ringbearers travel there to receive healing for the wounds (spiritual more than physical) incurred in the ownership of the One Ring. They would still die, but the hope was that they could live the rest of the time they had remaining in peace."
lotr,38juby,WalkingTarget,91,Thu Jun 4 19:01:52 2015 UTC,Solid.  I love how you explained it.  Why did Gandalf travel to the Undying Lands?
lotr,38juby,WalkingTarget,116,Thu Jun 4 19:32:59 2015 UTC,"It's not spelled out in the narrative (although some questions come up when characters wonder what he is considering that he seems to have been around since forever), only mentioned in an appendix of LotR itself (and other posthumously-published writings), but Gandalf is a Maia (as are the other wizards, Balrogs, and even Sauron himself) - of the same kind as the Valar if much lower in stature. The plan the Valar came up with to counter Sauron was to send emissaries as guides for the free peoples of Middle-earth rather than coming in force themselves. The wizards were given real, corporeal bodies (and were therefore subject to hunger, fear, doubt, pain, and everything else that having a body comes with) and orders to not bully the inhabitants of the world or otherwise reveal themselves in glory for the angelic beings they were. They, therefore, were given bodies of healthy but old men - the idea being to instill a certain amount of ""listen to my wisdom"" respect-your-elders kind of thing.  Gandalf traveled to the Undying Lands because his mission was complete and he was going ""home""."
lotr,38juby,Hageshii01,28,Thu Jun 4 19:58:07 2015 UTC,"One thing I've always wondered; did anyone know that Gandalf was Olórin?  I assume Galadriel did, and by extension Celeborn, and maybe Elrond.  Then we have his confrontation with the Balrog, and Gandalf very openly announces himself as ""a servant of the Secret Fire,"" i.e. The Flame Imperishable, and thus Eru Ilúvatar.  That would probably go over the Hobbits' heads (at least I think; I'm not sure what the day-to-day Men knew about the Valar and Ilúvatar), but certainly Aragorn, Legolas, and maybe Gimli would have picked something up from it."
lotr,38juby,WalkingTarget,23,Fri Jun 5 02:58:33 2015 UTC,"Well, that name is mentioned by Faramir at one point when Frodo asked him who he meant by ""The Grey Pilgrim"". Cirdan at least knew that he was an emissary from the West upon his arrival, even if he didn't know his exact identity. I'd imagine that if Faramir knew the name, however, that others more wise knew it as well by the time of the story (although of the people in the story, only Galadriel and, depending on the explanation you choose, maybe Glorfindel would have had a chance to have known him in Valinor)."
lotr,38juby,Hageshii01,4,Fri Jun 5 03:20:57 2015 UTC,"There's also his meeting with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli in Fangorn.  I cannot recall how it preceeds in the book, but I think it's similar to the film where he explains that he has ""been sent back until [his] task is done.""  Certainly they knew something.  Did Faramir use the name Olórin?  I recall him using Mithrandir, but not Olórin."

I cannot recall how it preceeds in the book, but I think it's similar to the film where he explains that he has ""been sent back until [his] task is done."" Certainly they knew something.   He does mention being ""sent back"", but there's nothing really there to indicate his identity, only implications that he's more than he seems to be.   Did Faramir use the name Olórin? I recall him using Mithrandir, but not Olórin.   He mentions ""The Grey Pilgrim"" and Frodo asks who that is. Faramir then runs through all the names that he knows and is quoting what Gandalf had said to him.   'The Grey Pilgrim?' said Frodo. 'Had he a name?'  'Mithrandir we called him in elf-fashion', said Faramir, 'and he was content. Many are my names in many countries, he said. Mithrandir among the Elves, Tharkûn to the Dwarves; Olórin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Incánus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not.'"
lotr,38juby,ReinierPersoon,8,Fri Jun 5 13:35:15 2015 UTC,"This is very similar to a passage from the Poetic Edda, which Tolkien was certainly familiar with and even borrowed a few names from. Odin goes by many names, and in this poem he lists some of them:  A single name | have I never had  Since first among men I fared.  Grimnir they call me | in Geirröth's hall,  With Asmund Jalk am I;  Kjalar I was | when I went in a sledge,  At the council Thror am I called,  As Vithur I fare to the fight;  Oski, Biflindi, | Jafnhor and Omi,  Gondlir and Harbarth midst gods.  From here, it is the poem Grimnismol: http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/ice/index.htm"
lotr,38juby,RuafaolGaiscioch,2,Fri Jun 5 13:46:43 2015 UTC,"Really just means that Gandalf himself said the name at some point, but there's no reason to expect that anyone knew the connotation."
lotr,38juby,DuranStar,7,Fri Jun 5 17:35:27 2015 UTC,I expect very few who he was specifically but I suspect many (if not most) elves would have been able to 'perceive' that he was more than them.
lotr,38juby,WalkingTarget,66,Fri Jun 5 04:42:49 2015 UTC,"Also, if you haven't read the appendices you may have missed that Gimli also goes to the Undying lands.  When Legolas eventually leaves, Gimli goes with him - an astonishing act for a Dwarf to be willing to give up all he had and, even more, that the Valar would permit it. It's a testament to the friendship between he and Legolas and the significance it has in the mending of the rift between their peoples.  Galadriel may have also played a part in securing this boon for him as she was rather a big deal among the Elves."
lotr,38juby,iateyourbaby,51,Thu Jun 4 20:29:30 2015 UTC,"This is my favorite part of the story... that Legolas and GImli traveled Middle Earth long after the rest of the Fellowship settled down.... then decided ""Eff it- we're seen enough; let's build a boat and go to the Undying Lands together.""  It really was beautiful."
lotr,38juby,WalkingTarget,6,Thu Jun 4 22:48:01 2015 UTC,"I never knew this, that's awesome. Is this in the Appendices or somewhere else?"
lotr,38juby,iateyourbaby,29,Thu Jun 4 23:50:10 2015 UTC,"It's the last part of Appendix A.   We have heard tell that Legolas took Gimli Glóin's son with him because of their great friendship, greater than any that has been between Elf and Dwarf. If this is true, then it is strange indeed: that a Dwarf should be willing to leave Middle-earth for any love, or that the Eldar should receive him, or that the Lords of the West should permit it. But it is said that Gimli went also out of desire to see again the beauty of Galadriel; and it may be that she, being mighty among the Eldar, obtained this grace for him. More cannot be said of this matter.   Appendix B puts this in year 1541 of the Shire Reckoning, 122 years after the fall of Sauron, following the death of Aragorn on March 1."

lotr,38juby,Uluithiad,2,Fri Jun 5 03:54:12 2015 UTC,"There is so much crucial or just interesting information crammed into the Appendices it's unreal. People who never read the books and just want to bash Peter Jackson for dragging out the Hobbit or the Extended LOTR's never stop to think about this. Literally half of ROTK is stuff of this detail and importance that is left out of the main plot to not break away from the story so often. Yes Jackson did embellish some stuff but I'm not complaining. The Hobbit book is a kids book that is pretty short. If you made it exactly like the book you wouldn't care for or know shit about any characters save Bilbo, Gandalf, Golem, Thorin and a few others. But all that extra info he put into the movies (or most I should say) isn't just stuff he pulled outta his ass to drag it out into three movies to make more money (Well maybe a little lol). If you like LOTR and Middle Earth lore than don't complain, there is only so much original material and there will be an end to the movies some day if not already, I'd rather have as much as we can get. To those who don't like Tolkien, don't watch the movie. I'm not trying to sound like a dick or anything."
lotr,38juby,RuafaolGaiscioch,3,Fri Jun 5 16:05:26 2015 UTC,"You're not trying to sound like a dick? No, you just couldn't help, at the mere mention of the Appendices, to rant about how everyone is terrible because they don't like Peter Jackson. You badmouth people for not reading the books before bashing Jackson, but you likely haven't yourself (most people who spell it 'Golem' have heard the name 'Gollum' far more than they've read it).  But please, if you want to drag Jackson kicking and screaming here, where he doesn't belong, if you want to use a mention of the Appendices to grandstand for Jackson's redemption, how much of the extended editions and the Hobbit films can you identify as being from the Appendices? Can you make a list? Probably not, since you've decided to follow Jackson in pulling stuff out of your ass."
lotr,38juby,cohfee,2,Fri Jun 5 18:14:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but, his dragging out was still inexcusable.  He incorporated some things from the appendices, but most of the content was still his own brand of fluff."

lotr,38it4g,JCMorgoth,10,Thu Jun 4 14:29:03 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. Feanor had a much harder life and it caused him to be a much harder person.  Feanor is the first and at the time, the only unhappy Elf in Valinor, which is virtually paradise.  Who is the first Elf ever to die? His mother.   Who is the second Elf ever to die? His father.   He was alive to see the Trees fall and Valinor thrown into darkness, and even when he thinks he has salvaged some hope in the form of the Silarmils, they too are taken from him.  (I realize Elves are ""immortal"" and are bound to Arda but just because Finwe and Miriel could technically return to ""life"" doesn't mean Elves aren't affected by death emotionally.)"
lotr,38it4g,Xecellseor,4,Thu Jun 4 19:00:08 2015 UTC,"Hard to say, they had their own strengths and weaknesses. Fëanor was the best smith whilst also being a brilliant swordsman but his deeds have caused a tremendous amount of sorrow. Fingolfin challenged Morgoth to single combat, which is highly impressive but I feel like he might have done more for the Eldar on the whole if he hadn't charged to his death. If I had to choose between the two regarding who'd be a better leader/king, I'd choose Fingolfin. He seems to cause less woe for the Elves in general, which is probably what you're looking for in a King."
lotr,38it4g,Hurin_Thalion,2,Thu Jun 4 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"That depends, better in what?  Better perrson? Fingolfin. He cares for everyone and the common good, unlike his half brother.  Better leader? Absolutely Fingolfin. Fëanor was never much of a long-term thinker, and his rashness is a terrible disadvantage when in a position of command.   Better fighter? All signs point towards Fingolfin. I mean, having a battle against a vala and actually being able to wound him, plus defending middle earth from the armies of said vala for hundreds of years, etc etc...  Better smith? Fëanor. Obviously. Silmarills and all..."
lotr,38it4g,Timiniel,2,Fri Jun 5 11:45:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I think an argument can be made that Fingolfin wouldn't necessarily be Fëanors better in all of those things; it's just that we probably don't know a lot directly about how good Fëanor was.

Fëanor also inspired a large part of the Noldor to follow him to Middle-earth.   I also find Fëanor a more interesting character, the flawed hero, while Fingolfin is pretty much a good person."

lotr,38it4g,Timiniel,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:20:25 2015 UTC,"He is misguided, but he went after Morgoth (against the odds) while the Valar did nothing. And he told Morgoth to get lost before he destroyed the Trees. He is also the reason some of the light of the Trees is still there. And one of the reasons was to get revenge on Morgoth for his father.  Sure, he did a lot of bad things, but that seems quite common for Elves during that period. And yes, Fingolfin and Finarfin and their followers were morally better people.  (I see you got downvoted for your earlier comment for no reason, so I gave you an upvote just for that)"
lotr,38it4g,ReinierPersoon,3,Fri Jun 5 12:34:12 2015 UTC,"He is also the reason some of the light of the Trees is still there.   Actually the majority of the light of the Trees that still exists is due to Aulë and Yavanna. They are the ones who saved one last flower and fruit from Telperion and Laurelin, fashioning them into the Sun and the Moon. It's true Fëanor captured the light in the Silmarils, but only one remains viewable as a star in the sky. I'd argue the Sun and the Moon easily outshine it.   Sure, he did a lot of bad things, but that seems quite common for Elves during that period.   It's been awhile since I've read Sil, but I'd argue the majority of the ""bad things"" done by elves of the period were done by Fëanor and his sons.  To me, Fëanor is a bit more complex of a character than can easily reduced to ""hero"" or ""bad guy."" He's not exactly a hero in the sense of Turin or Beren or any of the other greats of the First Age, but he's certainly not in the same league as Morgoth or Ungoliant. The problem is he is such a great (meaning mighty or powerful, not necessarily good) Elf, who accomplished truly great things, yet was overly prideful and rash. To me, despite being one of the most fantastic characters in Tolkien, he's also one of the most real. He suffered terribly, could not control his own passion, and committed a great many rash deeds that perhaps a calmer mind might have avoided. He's not like the stoic elves we see later on, he's brimming with emotion and fiery spirit.  Personally, regarding OP's question, I'd say that Fingolfin was ""better."" He was more noble and moral certainly, and a character that one can look up to. Fëanor, on the other hand, is much more relateable."
lotr,38it4g,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Fri Jun 5 13:30:12 2015 UTC,"Ooops, forgot about the sun and the moon.   Relateable might be the right word. Somehow I was rooting for Fëanor despite the evil things he did, also partly because he went after Morgoth when the Valar did nothing. I love it that his prediction turned out to be right (""in the end they will follow me"" on the Valar).  Sam on the other hand is a true hero, he is not powerful in any way but he is just a simple Hobbit. He is loyal and brave."
lotr,38it4g,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:37:57 2015 UTC,I also think the reason that many of the elves we see later on that are very stoic are like that because the learned from their early years and arguably many are still old enough to remember what Feanor and their ancestors did. Plus they went through many more hardships then the early elves and therefor were much better equipped to handle the fallout. None of the Noldor in Valinor ever new pain nor loss so it was probably a lot harder to handle. We also see most of the elves after the fall of Feanor become much wiser very quickly when they started losing people in the wars against Morgoth.
lotr,38it4g,357turduckin,2,Fri Jun 5 14:47:07 2015 UTC,"Some certainly were old enough to remember the First Age, but many of the Noldor departed after the First Age, and after the destruction of Eregion there were very few left at all. Of those named in LotR, only Galadriel and Glorfindel come to mind who would have witnessed the events of the First Age. Certainly simply learning everything that occurred and dealing with the effects would also contribute to your point, but it's also important to think about which groups of elves we see later on. The Noldor were the craftsmen and warriors of the elves, the ones more prone to action. In the Third Age, the majority of the elves that are left are musically inclined Sindar and the very secretive Silvan elves. I guess I always interpreted the Noldor as the sort of ""movers and shakers"" of the elves, while the other clans were a bit more interested in a peaceful existence (be it on the sea, in the forests). I think this could contribute to the comparable stoicism.  More generally I think it also has to do with the decline of the elves during the Third Age."
lotr,38it4g,EyeceEyeceBaby,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:42:48 2015 UTC,"I like all of your points but I would like to counter with the fact that the elves (even if they did not live during the first age) would remember what happened, though men and the other peoples of middle earth would very likely not even know most of it had happened. The elves also kept the histories of middle earth as well. So I think that combined with age and intermingling with the non - high elves took away some of their passion and added wisdom."
lotr,38it4g,357turduckin,2,Fri Jun 5 18:14:38 2015 UTC,"You're right, I didn't really word it very clearly but I was trying to allude to that with my line ""Certainly simply learning everything that occurred and dealing with the effects would also contribute to your point."" Elves like Elrond (born at the very end of, or after the First Age) would have certainly learned of the events though."

lotr,38it4g,Timiniel,2,Fri Jun 5 13:55:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm starting to change my mind about the word hero. Someone like Sam is a true hero, Fëanor was someone who did major things, good and bad, and sometimes in bad faith (killing Teleri, burning the ships)."
lotr,38it4g,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:29:47 2015 UTC,"While true I wouldn't class him as a being and evil and or bad character in the least. Another thing is that not all of his actions were bad yet he was punished by the Valar because they wouldn't take action. In a lot of ways he was made into the character he was because of the Valar being too passive and making the same mistake as when the allowed Melkor to destroy their first land in middle earth.   Iv'e always though that the Valar were as much at fault for Feanor's actions as he was himself. I'm sure many of his actions were because the Valar basically did nothing to protect the elves, therefore he felt justified in doing whatever necessary to fix the situation he was put in (he made the wrong choice in revenge but...). So maybe he wasn't a hero but he was put under way to much pressure and never really became the villain except for the slaughter of the Teleri.  Sorry for not providing specifics but don't have the Silmarillion in front of me so some things may be a bit off but I think I conveyed my point well enough."

I'm sorry but your actions are YOUR choices, and YOU are the only responsible for them. So was for Fëanor.  It is not the Valar's fault that he did terrible things. It was his decision, his prerogative to stop all of it. He ""felt"" forced, but the only person doing the forcing was himself."

I honestly can't decide. Feanor endured so much pain and heartbreak yet still had enough heart left to try and defeat Morgoth. While Fingolfin was a calmer figure, but showed true courage and acceptance of death while riding to gates of Angband. Both are excellent characters and figures in Middle Earth."

Seventy times he uttered that cry; but they took him at las alive, by the command of Morgoth, for the Orcs grappled him with their hands, which clung to him still though he hewed off their arms; and ever their numbers were renewed, until at las he fell buried beneath them. Then Gothmog bound him and dragged him to Angband with mockery.  Thus ended Nirnaeth Arnoediad, as the sun went down beneath the sea.

Now I am NEVER someone to bother celebrities, I honestly just don't care enough, but my girlfriend is absolutely obsessed with LOTR, and I knew it would make her insanely jealous if I got a picture with the (on-screen) love of her life.  I basically went up and told him that, and he laughed and was like ""yeah, let's do it!"" Around that time, one of the venue's employees came up and pretty aggressively told me that pictures weren't allowed. Totally understandable, there were going to be a lot of famous people there tonight. And like I said, i'm not super comfortable bugging celebs anyway, so I started to say ok, when Elijah snapped back at the guy ""hey! I said it was fine. Back off, he's not bothering me.""   It sounds so cheesy when people gush about celebrities being ""omg the nicest person ever,"" but I was seriously surprised at how gracious he was. He even insisted we do multiple selfies since the first one didn't come out right.   The only thing that I kinda felt bad about is when saying goodbye, I reiterated that my gf would be totally jealous of me, and when I mentioned that she watched LOTR at least once a week, I thought I noticed his expression darken slightly.

In the book it was said that Thranduil loved white gems: ""If the elf-king had a weakness it was for treasure, especially for silver and white gems..."" in general, so I just assumed he meant those. And on a side note, any of the Noldor would be in trouble as well if they weren't the sons of Feänor.  And yes, the Hobbit movies are infuriating at times."
lotr,38f7w4,ElvenViking,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:49:17 2015 UTC,The Noldor all share in the curse of Mandos as a result of their slaughter of the Teleri to get the ships. I figure based on that all the Noldor would do whatever they had to in order to get the Silmarils anyway.

Theories that Erebor held a Silmaril tend to stand on the mistaken notion that one of the two Silmarils taken by Maedhros or Maglor ended up there, but the idea that the Nauglamir and/or its Silmaril is there is categorically impossible. It's the only one we can definitively give a location for after the First Age. (And it's not Erebor.)"
lotr,38ack1,VenerableSphinx,10,Tue Jun 2 22:35:22 2015 UTC,Dwarf/elf hatred is not a universal thing. Trade between the elves of Eregion and the dwarves of Moria was common and this is what the doors was created for.   The elf Celebrimbor wrote the words on the doors which were constructed by the dwarf Narvi.
lotr,38ack1,Wiles_,3,Tue Jun 2 23:05:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its not Dwarf/Elf hatred, its Dwarf/Sindar hatred.  The Dwarves and the Noldor got along really well.  Such as the Elves at Eregion."
lotr,38ack1,Seafroggys,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:24:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, and to add to that Tolkien writes:   `I was wrong after all,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli too. Merry, of all people, was on the right track. The opening word was inscribed on the archway all the time! The translation should have been: Say ""Friend"" and enter. I had only to speak the Elvish word for friend and the doors opened. Quite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-master in these suspicious days. Those were happier times. Now let us go!'   I find this interesting because it was Sauron's first open attack upon this region that ultimately brought its demise, and that was before the Last Alliance.  What great lore!  Here is some more text from the unfinished tales on that region and that friendship.  Consider that there are conflicting tales.  OP should read the rest here under the History of Galadriel part.  Its fascinating.   Celeborn and Galadriel therefore went eastwards, about the year 700 of the Second Age, and established the (primarily but by no means solely) Noldorin realm of Eregion. It may be that Galadriel chose it because she knew of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm (Moria). There were and always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of Ered Lindon, 3 where the very ancient mansions of Nogrod and Belegost had been - not far from Nenuial; but they had transferred most of their strength to Khazad-dûm. Celeborn had no liking for Dwarves of any race (as he showed to Gimli in Lothlórien), and never forgave them for their part in the destruction of Doriath; but it was only the host of Nogrod that took part in that assault, and it was destroyed in the battle of Sam Athrad {The Silmarillion pp. 233-5]. The Dwarves of Belegost were filled with dismay at the calamity and fear for its outcome, and this hastened their departure eastwards to Khazad-dûm. 4 Thus the Dwarves of Moria may be presumed to have been innocent of the ruin of Doriath and not hostile to the Elves. In any case, Galadriel was more far-sighted in this than Celeborn; and she perceived from the beginning that Middle-earth could not be saved from ""the residue of evil"" that Morgoth had left behind him save by a union of all the peoples who were in their way and in their measure opposed to him. She looked upon the Dwarves also with the eye of a commander, seeing in them the finest warriors to pit against the Orcs. Moreover Galadriel was a Noldo, and she had a natural sympathy with their minds and their passionate love of crafts of hand, a sympathy much greater than that found among many of the Eldar: the Dwarves were ""the Children of Aulë,"" and Galadriel, like others of the Noldor, had been a pupil of Aulë and Yavanna in Valinor.  Galadriel and Celeborn had in their company a Noldorin craftsman named Celebrimbor. [He is here said to have been one of the survivors of Gondolin, who had been among Turgon's greatest artificers; but the text is emended to the later story that made him a descendant of Fëanor, as is mentioned in Appendix B toThe Lord of the Rings (in the revised edition only), and more fully detailed in The Silmarillion (pp. 176,276), where he is said to have been the son of Curufin, the fifth son of Fëanor, who was estranged from his father and remained in Nargothrond when Celegorm and Curufin were driven forth.] Celebrimbor had ""an almost 'dwarvish' obsession with crafts""; and he soon became the chief artificer of Eregion, entering into a close relationship with the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, among whom his greatest friend was Narvi. [In the inscription on the West-gate of Moria Gandalf read the words:Im Narvi hain echant: Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thiw hin: ""I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs."" The Fellowship of Ring II 4]. Both Elves and Dwarves had great profit from this association: so that Eregion became far stronger, and Khazad-dûm far more beautiful, than either would have done alone."
lotr,38ack1,AmbiguousAnonymous,7,Thu Jun 4 14:23:16 2015 UTC,"For one thing, the dwarves preferred to keep their language a secret. Other than a few major place names and battle cries, they avoided using their language around outsiders. Even their personal names were kept secret (ex. ""Gimli"" is not actually the dwarf's true Dwarven name). Also, the elvish land of Eregion was pretty much right next door and was closely allied with Moria. It was actually an elf, Celebrimbor (who also made the Three Rings), who wrote the inscription on the door."

The Spnaish ones are done using this mode. It's not an official mode, but in my opinion - without actually knowing the language - it's the best and also most popular Spanish mode that exists.  To my understanding, Castillian (""Standard Spanish"") would be the one with [θ].

lotr,384r9p,ahbadgerbadgerbadger,2,Mon Jun 1 23:21:42 2015 UTC,"The exact appearance of Sauron isn't really described, so they had to improvise when they made Sauron for the movies. What we know from the books is that after the fall of Númenor (I think) he could no longer take fair form, and was terrible to look upon, or something along those lines. I think Gollum says he has nine fingers.  I think the movie version of Sauron may be based on the description of Morgoth when fighting Fingolfin. If you google Morgoth you can see pics of a big dude in armor with a club, towering above normal-sized people.  Tolkien described Sauron as not a giant, but somewhat taller than humans. All left vague, up to the reader to have his own interpretation as with many things in the books."
lotr,384r9p,ebneter,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:46:40 2015 UTC,"I think Gollum says he has nine fingers.   I think this is more ""Isildur cut off the ring finger"" as opposed to ""he's a scary mofo with 9 fingers, tho."
lotr,384r9p,ahbadgerbadgerbadger,4,Tue Jun 2 04:23:20 2015 UTC,"The point is that if he has nine fingers, he has to have a body to go with that hand."

lotr,387pdf,MDeeMC,10,Tue Jun 2 13:19:15 2015 UTC,"What /u/MDeeMC wrote. Plus Gandalf said that the Ring can deliberately change it's size to betray it's owner so he would lose it, like Gollum did."

Now to be fair, even with the same director the hobbit movies weren't like LotR, but people wouldn't have known that would be the outcome.   GdT has a record of ""creepy"", albeit fantastic, movies that can be quite darker than people anticipated, looking at you Pan's Labyrinth. My guess is it would have lost most of the childish aura and probably a lot of the direct story, and have been replaced by GdT's own interpretation. A lot of people wouldn't have considered them in the same universe as the LotR movies, and personally I'm okay with that. I would have definitely preferred a totally different spin on the Tolkien universe then the suck up trilogy we just got through."
lotr,37z82g,xXAUTUMNFIREXx,1 point,Sun May 31 17:46:21 2015 UTC,"even with the same director the hobbit movies weren't like LotR   I've always thought that the reason The Hobbit films weren't as good as LOTR, was because they tried to be too much like LOTR. Because the books are two very different things."

Being a dark fairytale was pretty much the point, wasn't it?   A lot of people wouldn't have considered them in the same universe as the LotR movies   I don't consider The Hobbit (book) to be in the same universe as tLotR (book). The world of the former is a sort of early prototype of the latter. Gandalf in The Hobbit is not really the same character as in tLotR: nor are the elves or goblins in The Hobbit really the same as the elves or orcs in tLotR."
lotr,37z82g,FaerieStories,12,Sun May 31 18:56:06 2015 UTC,The only thing I really take from the Hobbit is:  Bilbo went on an adventure with Gandalf.   Gollum lost his ring that turns the wearer invisible for some unknown reason.  Bilbo found that ring.   Bilbo made it back alive.   That's basically all you need to know about The Hobbit if you want to go straight into LOTR. The rest is filler that you can pick up on pretty easily.
lotr,37z82g,Lexpert1,4,Sun May 31 20:33:11 2015 UTC,You could get by just from reading the prologue bits in LotR that explain about Hobbits. They explain more about Hobbits then the book called The Hobbit.
lotr,37z82g,ReinierPersoon,6,Sun May 31 23:23:10 2015 UTC,"You're very right! There's very little in the hobbit that I would consider ""absolutely essential"" if you we're only reading LOTR, but if you want to stay true to the literature I would of course recommend reading the hobbit. If you wanted to skip it altogether then just read my basic synonymous."
lotr,37z82g,Lexpert1,3,Mon Jun 1 00:07:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, and The Hobbit definately has interesting stuff. Bilbo is an interesting character, and his lie when he got the Ring is a nice retcon (probably). The tone and style is also very different. I read the books when I was 13 or so, and they helped me learn English. I read them in Dutch first so I was surprised when some of the names were still in Dutch in the English version (Langstrand, Riddermark)."
lotr,37z82g,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:31:58 2015 UTC,"Right! Though his lie was noted in later versions of the Hobbit( I.e, after LOTR was published, if I remember correctly) it's still a very important note that shows us the nature of the Ring. Also, the Hobbit is a great read if you want to feel sad during the ""scary Bilbo"" part when Frodo and Bilbo are both in Rivendell. I always found that part to be most tragic because of how much it affected Bilbo."
lotr,37z82g,Lexpert1,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:51:23 2015 UTC,"And also interesting for seeing Gloin and Balin again (sort of).  I have no idea though what it is like to read LotR without knowing, since I read The Hobbit when I was so young. It's like not knowing what it is like not to be able to read since people learn it at a young age."
lotr,37z82g,ReinierPersoon,2,Mon Jun 1 00:56:07 2015 UTC,Not sure why you're getting downvoted for this... AFAIK Tolkien actually stated that The Hobbit wasn't supposed to be set in Middle Earth; he retconned it after starting LOTR.

It would probably be similar to fellowship in tone, and all of the orcs and goblins would have been extras in prosthetics.   GdT tries to use practical effects whenever he can, so all the sets would also be as real as possible.   Gandalf probably wouldn't have broken down crying about how acting on a green screen isn't acting."
lotr,37z82g,Saruus,9,Sun May 31 19:54:54 2015 UTC,"He probably still would have, because the issue there was that the camera angle tricks that make hobbits and dwarves short won't work if you're surrounded by them."
lotr,37z82g,bartonar,10,Sun May 31 20:35:21 2015 UTC,"The issue was with the 3D, not the amount of dwarves. Because they recorded it with a camera set up made for 3D, it makes it so some ordinary camera tricks (like the ones in lotr) don't work."

If the Hobbit Trilogy were made in the same time frame the LotR Trilogy was made, it would've been as good."
lotr,37z82g,Sharkey311,8,Sat Jun 6 20:29:21 2015 UTC,"GdT, as well as Fran Walsh, Phillipa Boyens and PJ wrote the screen play together. This screen play is then used directly to create a storyboard.   Essentially, the difference would be the exact same scenes with a different tone to them because each director is trying to recreate the the screenplay and subsequently, the storyboard. Pretty much like two different people painting something from the same set of very detailed instructions.   Another thing that you're not going to like is that GdT was part of the writing process that includes adding Tauriel and her love triangle, among other things. Also, I should mention PJ never wanted a trilogy if you didn't know that already."
lotr,37z82g,derek589111,18,Sun May 31 18:10:52 2015 UTC,"After del Toro's departure, the story was changed a lot. That love triangle? He wasn't involved at all. When he was involved, it was only planned for there to be one Hobbit movie, and then one 'other material' movie - so what ended up being the case was nothing like what he was involved in. And the trilogy was Jackson's idea, as he's said time and time again, to say otherwise would fall into the category of conspiratorial apoligism."
lotr,37z82g,Edledhron,3,Sun May 31 18:31:56 2015 UTC,"Of course the story will change. Happens even with the same director. Unfortunately though, he was part of the adaptation process from the beginning. In fact his role in the adaptation is so prevalent that he is included in the credits for every movie in the trilogy.   Where did you here Jackson say ""time and time again"" it was his idea for a trilogy?  Phillipa Boyens, Fran Walsh and Peter have all stated it was the studio who wanted three movies when they wanted two.  And ""conspiratorial apologism"" really bro?"
lotr,37z82g,derek589111,6,Sun May 31 19:04:44 2015 UTC,his role in the adaptation is so prevalent that he is included in the credits for every movie in the trilogy.   I suspect that the Writers' Guild was mostly responsible for that. They have Rules.
lotr,37z82g,ebneter,6,Mon Jun 1 04:59:44 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately though, he was part of the adaptation process from the beginning. In fact his role in the adaptation is so prevalent that he is included in the credits for every movie in the trilogy.    That doesn't mean a whole lot. Reading through this, I think, will adequately show that what we would have seen from del Toro would have been significantly different than what was delivered.   Phillipa Boyens, Fran Walsh and Peter have all stated it was the studio who wanted three movies when they wanted two.   Uh... what? Have you read a single thing from them on the matter? Even from the first announcement:   Recently Fran, Phil and I did just this when we watched for the first time an early cut of the first movie - and a large chunk of the second. We were really pleased with the way the story was coming together, in particular, the strength of the characters and the cast who have brought them to life.  All of which gave rise to a simple question: do we take this chance to tell more of the tale? And the answer from our perspective as the filmmakers, and as fans, was an unreserved ‘yes.'     And from an interview directly confronting the matter:   Look, it would be nakedly commercial if the studio had come to us, the filmmakers, and said, ""Why don't we turn this into three movies, because we can? And we can market and sell three films, blah blah blah."" But they didn't. We approached them. We felt that we had a story we wanted to tell, we had characters that we wanted to develop. We wanted to use material from the appendices that we otherwise couldn't have used. So we approached the studio and pitched the idea of why it would make sense to do it as three films. And it certainly wasn't commercially driven – it was a creative choice from us.   When you try to defend Jackson's choices by laying the blame on mysterious studio executives, yes, that is conspiratorial apoligism."

lotr,37sao9,Onkrud,1 point,Sat May 30 13:28:46 2015 UTC,"Isn't that because people pull out the main feathers or something? I think chickens naturally can at least fly a little bit, though they are not that good at it.  Balrogs are also not good at flying, they tend to die falling down."

lotr,37sao9,Onkrud,1 point,Sun May 31 13:25:13 2015 UTC,"They can indeed. I've seen them do a sort of long range, low flight (a couple feet up) as an alternative to walking, and a more normal, higher flight (such as to clear a tall fence or escape a terrestrial predator). I think some people see that chickens do not do long distance flight, e.g. migration, and assume that they don't fly at all, but that's not the case.  I've always thought that balrogs don't have wings: the original depiction of the balrog as a large human-like figure would seem out of place with wings, in my mind."

Although there is a book The Art of The Lord of the Rings coming out later this year with a lot of previously unpublished drawings by Tolkien.
lotr,37vezo,ebneter,1 point,Sun May 31 05:13:03 2015 UTC,"Sorry, im asking a very specific question! In book 2, chapter 3 (The Ring Goes South) of the fellowship, Tolkien describes the reforging of the shards of Narsil:  ""The sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on it its blade was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent Moon and the rayed sun, and about them was written many runes; for Aragorn son of Arathorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor.""   I'm wanting to get a tattoo of this and I'm looking for an accurate illustration.   Is there somewhere I can better ask this question or somewhere I can get a LOTR fan who is actually good at art to help me design one?  Edit: words"

It takes us away from what did happen into what didn't, and then asks us to consider what might have happened among the didn'ts. That's when we throw the prophecy right out. The prophecy doesn't say he only couldn't be defeated by a man. It says he wouldn't be. When we deal with things that aren't what happened, what will or will not happen no longer matters.  Suppose I make a prediction. Tomorrow, you will not get hit by a car. You either will or you will not. Those are the two options. Nothing in the universe is demanding you cannot be hit by a car tomorrow. But one of them will happen, and if I magically know which one it is ahead of time and I state that one, it is prophecy."

lotr,37tn4j,Idiocy_detox,17,Sat May 30 08:04:59 2015 UTC,"ASoIaF has breadth. People commonly mistake that for depth. But there's a reason all the fan pages for ASoIaF frame nearly all of their questions and theories on what will happen. If it was a work of similar depth to Tolkien, you would see the cascade of theories about things that have nothing at all to do with the projected narrative. Depth is not the richness Martin offers."
lotr,37tn4j,Uluithiad,5,Sat May 30 09:57:31 2015 UTC,The Lord of the Rings has more depth than just about anything ever written. There are plenty of things with more depth than ASoIaF. I'd say that even the WH40K books have more depth than Martin's series.
lotr,37tn4j,i_a1m_to_misbehave,3,Sat May 30 13:48:36 2015 UTC,"How do you define 'depth?' The difference between AGOT and LOTR has always interested me, though I've never found a term to describe exactly what they are. While both are high-fantasy, they remain completely different. LOTR has depth in that the world is incredibly expansive, with multiple developed languages, thousands of years of established history and lore etc. AGOT is interesting in that it largely has the edge in terms of character. Although not badly written per se, Tolkien's characters are far less grounded in reality than AGOT, the fact is that if Tolkien intended a far more realistic setting, the influence made on it by classic epic would have been far less. Characters in the real world make far less long and complicated speeches etc.  So to summarise, both are very different, I'm not sure if to compare them is entirely fair"
lotr,37tn4j,kingjingaling1,1 point,Sun May 31 20:03:07 2015 UTC,"The characters in ASOIAF are awesome, and hard to beat. Plus, Martin did a great job with twists and ignoring the traditional fantasy tropes. But worldwise, not as well as Lotr. Like you said, middle earth has a detailed history, languages and feel. With Martin, it's much more general. Travel Distances, area sizes, and overall world building just arent as strong"
lotr,37tn4j,metruesta,2,Mon Jun 1 03:29:46 2015 UTC,Lord if the rings is full of multiple launguges. 3 very detailed and defined ages each lasting many thousands of years and a time before time with a set pantheon. Some cultures aren't as detailed as others but there is a massive amount of depth to look at.
lotr,37tn4j,Collegenoob,2,Sat May 30 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you define depth.  In the works of JRR Tolkien, everything is connected, substantiated. Things are explained and make sense. You know where everything comes from, from the beginning of times, through millennia. Tolkien worked very hard to make it so, and he wanted ""coherence"" to be important in his created works.  GRR Martin doesn't share this. A lot of his writings aren't explained, nor have their sources and foundations visible. In fact, he works more with that obfuscation than with actual writing.  I'd have to say Tolkien's works have more depth, while Martin's works have more breadth. It's really interesting, since I adore one, and gave up on reading the other (and being an avid reader, I can say this is the only time it has ever happened)."
lotr,37tn4j,Timiniel,-11,Mon Jun 1 15:38:28 2015 UTC,You have to be especialy idiotic to think LotR is in anyway better then Asoiaf. Yeah Tolkien tried but trying ain't count for shit if you'r bad.

lotr,37sjp0,Brutesavage666,12,Sat May 30 01:15:23 2015 UTC,"LOTR is much deeper.  Most of the 'lore' in HP is relevant to the story.  But LOTR has the world building of the Sil, Tom Bombadil, all the history of the Elves & Rangers.  But I think Rowling was a better writer. Much more 'fun' to read. But Tolkien had such an excellent story, and such deep, rich world, that his tendancey to drone on about scenery could be easily overlooked."
lotr,37sjp0,Tymanthius,8,Sat May 30 01:18:57 2015 UTC,"I think largely that had to do with the era he lived in, styles of writing were just different back then. And for me, one of the things I love most about his works, is how he goes into extreme descriptions to make you feel like you're surrounded by Middle-Earth. Some of my favorite writing comes from RTOK, when Frodo and Sam are in Mordor, making their way to Mt. Doom. I just felt like I was there with them. He was a very immersive writer."
lotr,37sjp0,FusionCrayfish,3,Sat May 30 04:22:55 2015 UTC,"Thats what Im looking for, immersive writing, because Im not hugely into books, HP and LOTR are the only series that have sparked interest in me to read the books!"

lotr,37sjp0,Tymanthius,1 point,Sun May 31 11:06:33 2015 UTC,"He's more literary, that's true.  I guess I should define how I mean better. In this case 'better = more sales, more readers'.  And I'm pretty sure Rowling has had a much larger # of readers per year than Tolkien did.  But it's also not a fair comparison.  What did well when Tolkein published isn't the same as what does well now."
lotr,37sjp0,Uluithiad,2,Sun May 31 14:27:05 2015 UTC,"It's not a fair comparison because Rowling's books are relatively new. You can't assume readers per year will remain at the levels it did when she currently publishing new HP books. You should assume they won't unless there is some pretty heavy indication otherwise. And Rowling has quite a long ways to go before she comes anywhere close to Tolkien in terms of more sales, more readers, i.e. complete copies sold (as having seven books in a sequence does not give you extra readers)."
lotr,37sjp0,oberynmartel79,10,Sun May 31 19:38:26 2015 UTC,LOTR for sure... LOTR created an entire universe with a deep and long history.  It also created a new language.     I do agree with the more fun style of reading from Rowling but her books weren't beautiful like Tolkien's were.
lotr,37sjp0,ReinierPersoon,2,Sat May 30 01:26:52 2015 UTC,"Thats good, if I enjoy the background of the HP series (which I assumed was quite deep) then I will surely love the LOTR lore. Good to know!"

lotr,37sjp0,TheDivineSappho,2,Sat May 30 06:42:28 2015 UTC,That's the order I'd suggest yeah.
lotr,37sjp0,Edledhron,1 point,Sat May 30 13:35:18 2015 UTC,"Yup. The Hobbit is different in style and tone from LotR though. It was originally written as a children's book for Tolkien's own children, so it is less dark or serious. The movies included a lot of material on the Dwarves and Orcs from the appendices of LotR, stuff that wasn't mentioned in The Hobbit.  The recommended reading order is on the sidebar on the right. When I read the books The Children of Húrin had not yet been published, and I haven't got around to reading it yet.  I have read The Hobbit, LotR and The Silmarillion and they are all very different in style. The Silmarillion reads more like a history book, it has no real main character but traces the history of the world, and is a lot darker than LotR or The Hobbit. It contains the story of LotR and Children of Húrin so that is why it is recommended to read those books first."
lotr,37sjp0,ebneter,3,Sat May 30 18:12:14 2015 UTC,"LOTR, it's a no-brainer. Tolkien spent years inventing his own languages and creating histories of his world that spanned thousands of years. Overall effect: You can immerse yourself in LOTR in a way that few fantasy series can match."
lotr,37sjp0,Edledhron,2,Sat May 30 02:10:46 2015 UTC,"Tolkien wrote characters and stories for his world, which itself was made for his languages.   That isn't really accurate. You seem to have this notion that 'languages' are the base of his creation, then there's the world, then there's the stories and characters. However, those three aspects, and others, are much more interconnected. They support each with, with no one part being the chief aim, and this interconnectedness is so pervasive that you can't really separate them from each other. The languages are important for the worldbuilding, the stories, the characters; the characters and stories important for the worldbuilding and languages; the worldbuilding for the characters and stories and languages. They're more one thing altogether than separated parts.  Tolkien didn't write The Lord of the Rings ultimately to serve his languages. As he stated, ""The prime motive was the desire of a taleteller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them."" If anything, his languages served its story more than the story them."
lotr,37sjp0,ebneter,1 point,Sat May 30 02:11:50 2015 UTC,"Tolkien didn't write The Lord of the Rings ultimately to serve his languages.   Tolkien said on more than one occasion that the languages were the foundation of the whole thing, that he realized that languages needed people to speak them, and people needed history and mythology.  It's true that the motivation for The Lord of the Rings specifically was not the languages, but they were indeed at the root of Middle-earth."
lotr,37sjp0,FusionCrayfish,1 point,Sat May 30 08:04:09 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, my perception is that languages began the whole thing, and Tolkien seems to have personally cared most for the languages, but they were deeper entwined than the popular narrative that ""Tolkien wasn't a storyteller, he created languages and only wanted stories to provide a home for them."" I mean, it was certainly true that he wanted a home for his languages, but his desire and craft for storytelling goes beyond merely that. To bring up a couple quotes:   Behind my stories is now a nexus of languages . . . But an equally basic passion of mine ab initio was for myth (not allegory) and for fairy-story, and above all for heroic legend on the brink of fairy-tale and history, of which there is far too little in the world (accessible to me) for my appetite.      It was just as the 1914 War burst on me that I made the discovery that 'legends' depend on the language to which they belong; but a living language depends equally on the 'legends' which it conveys by tradition."

lotr,37sjp0,AmbiguousAnonymous,2,Sun May 31 07:07:20 2015 UTC,"Having read/loved both, I would say that LOTR is most definitely more deep in regards to lore/mythology.  Tolkein created an entire universe for his readers to experience.  In no way am I discounting Harry Potter though; J.K Rowling definitely knows how to write an engaging fantasy series."
lotr,37sjp0,LordElrondd,2,Sat May 30 04:17:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is a good comparison because these two writers are not attempting to do the same thing. They both tell amazing stories of friendship, courage and resilience, but Rowling has not tried to create a secondary world to the same extent. If she had set Harry Potter in a different world or era and written all the lore and songs that Tolkien did, that would be one thing. As it stands I see no point in favouring LotR just because Harry Potter does not even try to be something similar. I would argue Rowling is just as talented a storyteller as Tolkien, but she doesn't want to do the same thing."
lotr,37sjp0,Not_Hulk_Hogan,1 point,Sat May 30 07:17:07 2015 UTC,"LOTR definitely.  Personally, I think Rowling is more of a ""low hanging fruit"" kind of writer.  They are all essentially children's books.  I know that might ostracize me but you asked!"

lotr,37rx10,Rmachine,5,Fri May 29 22:09:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can put much stock in what people say regarding the Ring. Boromir is clearly influenced by the power of the Ring, he wants it to save Gondor. Gollum also makes up claims as to why the Ring should be his, and even Bilbo was reluctant to give it away. Boromir wants it so he comes up with a reason, there is of course no reason why it should belong to Boromir or the Númenoreans.  Boromir is descended from Númenoreans, but I don't think the Stewards are descended from any of the kings, otherwise they would likely have succeeded as kings and not Stewards."
lotr,37rx10,ReinierPersoon,1 point,Fri May 29 22:40:43 2015 UTC,The name escapes me but The stewards are actually desended from the line of either Elendils brother or Isildors brother
lotr,37rx10,Collegenoob,2,Sat May 30 13:01:42 2015 UTC,"In a more general sense, Gondor being a Numenorean settlement were a ""nobler"" people than Rohan, Harad, Rhun, or the other races of men. It's similar to the distinction between the Noldor and Sindar elves. The Gondorians trace their ancestry to the legendary peoples of Beleriand, who joined the fight against Morgoth and were rewarded with Numenor, whereas the Rohirrim, Southrons, and Easterlings came from the early men who never participated in the wars of Beleriand, just as the Sindarin elves never came to Valinor."

""high"" people as he puts it. Also before Boromir attacks Frodo he says something like ""Aragorn could use it, or if he does not. Then why not Boromir?""

lotr,37p2p9,btaz,29,Fri May 29 07:44:59 2015 UTC,Durin the Deathless was far greater than Gimli ever was.
lotr,37p2p9,Ben_Kerman,6,Fri May 29 08:01:04 2015 UTC,Seems like it.  Is there any lore on Durin taking part in the battles against Morgoth ?
lotr,37p2p9,Version_1,21,Fri May 29 14:50:18 2015 UTC,Gimli was just the biggest elven-friend.
lotr,37p2p9,DatSander,8,Fri May 29 08:29:41 2015 UTC,"Also, he was the only dwarf to travel to the undie-ing lands! But all of this doesn't make him the greatest dwarf. He was just in the right place in the right time to come along on the journey to save Middle-Earth. Of course Gimli was a great dwarf in his actions and decision's, but he was not the greatest by a long shot.  For one, Thorin Oakenshield & Company who reconquered the Lonely Mountain and before that saved his people by establishing a colony in the west. (forgot the names of the mountain range).  Also, at the same time as the great battle's near Minas Tirith and the Black Gate, the Dwarfs of Erebor and the Kingdom of Dale fought against the Easterlings to prevent Sauron in reclaiming the north.   There were many great dwarfs, Gimli is just the one we can read most about because of his contributions in the Fellowship. Tho, if I'm wrong please correct me. I am no master of lore, this is just what I now and think.  EDIT: The colony was established in the west, not the east."
lotr,37p2p9,DatSander,3,Fri May 29 13:40:08 2015 UTC,Thorin does come across a bit selfish in the books (at least in the hobbit). He might have his reasons but it did not seem justified.
lotr,37p2p9,DividingPrescott,3,Fri May 29 14:52:59 2015 UTC,"He does. But as his grandfather, he too couldn't resist the immense treasure inside the mountain. It corrupted him, the treasure and the Arkenstone. The movies show this as ""dragon sickness"" (which was IMO the best part of the movies). Not sure if the books do as well.   In the timespan of the book, he indeed comes over selfish, but from the moment they were cast away, until that part of is life, he as a dwarf who took care of his people. Seeking a new home and all. Yet he couldn't resist the call of the treasure and the Arkenstone.  As the books tell it: ""The line of Durin is failing."" (I think, as I said,no master of lore)"
lotr,37p2p9,DividingPrescott,7,Fri May 29 15:02:23 2015 UTC,"Gimli was no greater a dwarf than legolas was an elf. Both were great members of their race, but fairly weak in comparison, power, and wisdom compared to other members of their race from earlier ages."
lotr,37p2p9,SlumdogSkillionaire,2,Fri May 29 13:45:10 2015 UTC,Fair point. Hence the question. It just feels that Tolkien did not expand much about the dwarves as he did about the Elves and the Men.
lotr,37p2p9,jynxi,2,Fri May 29 14:53:58 2015 UTC,"Yes the dwarves are fairly underdeveloped in comparison to the elves, men, and hobbits. They could have used more love, but I think Tolkien was partial to the elves above all else... since the stories all developed from him creating the elvish language."
lotr,37p2p9,flameofuldun,3,Fri May 29 15:02:29 2015 UTC,"Dwarves aren't even Children of Illuvatar, so in some ways they're a lesser class of being; they're more a ""feature"" of the world like ents."
lotr,37p2p9,DividingPrescott,1 point,Sat May 30 00:24:42 2015 UTC,"This and,  the dwarves weren't exactly the most social people. They kinda hid in their mountains and didn't really do anything, whereas the elves and men were always in the mix of things."
lotr,37p2p9,WSseba,1 point,Fri May 29 15:19:05 2015 UTC,"Right. I always viewed the dwarves as a ""happy accident"" race. They weren't Children of Ilúvatar. They were created by the smith Vala Aulë who did so because he grew impatient while waiting for the Children of Ilúvatar. He wanted to have students to teach his crafts to so he made his own ""race."" But Aulë didn't have the ability to give soul or free will to his creation so the dwarves were little more than drones initially (if I can put it like that). It was only when Aulë showed true remorse to Ilúvatar that Ilúvatar granted the dwarves souls (true life).   That's how I remember the dwarves' creation anyway. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on any part."
lotr,37p2p9,ReinierPersoon,2,Tue Jun 9 00:03:05 2015 UTC,This is a good point. Do we know who amongst the dwarves was considered to be wise?
lotr,37p2p9,1EnTaroAdun1,9,Fri May 29 15:34:29 2015 UTC,"During the Third Age in which LOTR takes place, I'd say the dwarf with the most renown would be Dain Ironfoot. He was a great warrior, having proved his might by slaying Azog the goblin during the battle of Orcs and Dwarves. He was a major player during the battle of 5 armies. Once Thorin died, he took the crown of erebor and negotiated peace with the men of Dale and the wood elves of mirkwood. When Balin wished to reoccupy Moria, Dain was against it. When Sauron sent Nazgul to him to demand assistance in providing location of Bilbo and the One ring, he sent messangers (gloin and gimli) to elrond seeking council. He died fighting during the war of the ring, defending his city and the body of King Brand, and was ancient by the time he fell, making it pretty impressive that he'd march off to battle.  In my opinion, Dain seems to have the least amount of the character flaws we associate with Dwarves, making him something special.  In earlier ages, I image Durin or his direct decedents were somehow the wisest or most special, but I dont honestly know as much about them."

The most recent common ancestor of every European today (except for recent immigrants to the Continent) was someone who lived in Europe in the surprisingly recent past—only about 600 years ago. In other words, all Europeans alive today have among their ancestors the same man or woman who lived around 1400. Before that date, according to Chang’s model, the number of ancestors common to all Europeans today increased, until, about a thousand years ago, a peculiar situation prevailed: 20 percent of the adult Europeans alive in 1000 would turn out to be the ancestors of no one living today (that is, they had no children or all their descendants eventually died childless); each of the remaining 80 percent would turn out to be a direct ancestor of every European living today.   source"

I've listened to the commentaries and I have no recollection of him claiming Tolkien ever thought he should play the part. But it was definitely a wish of his own.   Q: Many people said you wanted to play Gandalf, years ago.  CL: Oh, well...years ago, when the books came out! And, I was too young to play Gandalf. I was! When the books came out, somebody said to me, ""Did you read these books, and do you think they will be made into a film?"" I said it'd be a wonderful thing, but I doubt it. And he said, ""What would you like to play?"" And, of course I said Gandalf, nothing strange about that. Who wouldn't? But now, I'm far too old to play Gandalf. And when I saw what Ian did, apart from his performance, and seeing what he had to do physically, I was extremely thankful! I was even looking at you (Ian) running through the mines yesterday (in the footage.)  Ian McKellen: Well, I'm not sure that was me.  Q: What do you remember of meeting Tolkien?   CL: Very little. I was up in Oxford meeting some friends, and we were in the Randolph Hotel. Someone said, ""What are you doing here, this is all rather correct and proper; lets go to a pub."" This was forty-five + years ago. We were sitting there talking and drinking beer, and someone said, ""Oh, look who walked in."" It was Professor Tolkien, and I nearly fell off my chair. I didn't even know he was alive. He was a benign looking man, smoking a pipe, walking in, an English countryman with earth under his feet. And he was a genius, a man of incredible intellectual knowledge. He knew somebody in our group. He (the man in the group) said ""Oh Professor, Professor..."" And he came over. And each one of us, well I knelt of course, each one of us said ""how do you do?"" And I just said ""Ho.. How.. How..."" I just couldn't believe it. But I'll never forget it."

Then again Gandalf was doing gandalf stuff for almost 2000 years so Galadriel probably figured it out eventually."

lotr,37iwv7,mikelo22,3,Thu May 28 10:47:11 2015 UTC,"This is certainly possible. Olorin was a follower of the Vala Nienna. Above all else, Nienna's greatest quality was her pity, mercy and grief for all living things in Arda. It is through the teachings of Nienna that we find some of Gandalf's greatest quotes/teaching moments:   It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.   So while Gandalf may be in a different form now than that of Olorin in Aman, it's still possible, through his beliefs/actions, to deduce which Maia he was, even if Gandalf himself couldn't remember."

Music genres and subgenres aren't as simple as that.  In this case, what you are doing is the opposite. You see something that isn't a lizard, doesn't have 4 legs, doesn't breathe fire, doesn't have wings and doesn't fly, and call it a dragon just because it sings about dragons.  Amon Amarth isn't viking metal, nor folk metal. Their thematic can't change the actual music. When determining what genre or subgenre a music is, you need to look at more than just the theme, and in fact, that is rarely the differentiating factors.  You shouldn't call something viking metal just because of the theme. That is not helpful and prevents you and other people from finding similar music, which is the main goal of using genres and categorizing music as a whole."

But honestly, that doesn't matter to me.   Playing the game is fun. It's an enjoyable experience and the Middle Earth theme makes it even more fun for me. It in no way changes how I read the books, or takes away from my enjoyment of them. I'm currently re-reading the Hobbit now and neither the games I've played not the movies I've watched have made the book lesser to me.  I feel like a lot of times we Tolkien fans look at a work and ask how close is it to the books? What has changed? But recently I've been wondering why we do that. The books are classics and masterpieces. A game being different from them doesn't change that nor does it make the game worse."

I think the only issue is when people come along who think that something in such a work accurately reflects Tolkien's work. This is especially the case with something like ""Shadows of Mordor"" or Peter Jackson's films, where the creators were at great pains to tell us all how faithful they were to the original. In these cases, there is often confusion when people who are introduced to Tolkien via these vehicles learn that a lot of what they thought was true is simply wrong (as regards Tolkien's work, that is)."

The LotR films are also much more epic, it is about the fate of the world and not just a bunch of Dwarves looking to reclaim their homeland.  I also think the LotR movies are much, much better than The Hobbit movies. The Hobbit (the book) is somewhat over 200 pages, while LotR consists of three big fat volumes. There is just more going on in LotR.  I come to it from a different perspective than you though, I read the books before there were films so I already sort of knew what was going on, and I saw the LotR movies first because The Hobbit movies hadn't been made yet."

lotr,375x90,BasedPontiff,81,Mon May 25 03:51:53 2015 UTC,"No, Tolkien was writing about the Valar long before he started The Hobbit. But The Hobbit wasn't originally intended to take place in Middle-earth. Tolkien borrowed some of the worldbuilding ideas from his other writings, but it was only well after the book's publication (around the time he started writing LotR) that he decided to merge the two fictional universes. In LotR, people do talk about the Valar occasionally. Elbereth (aka. Varda) is referenced on several occasions by Frodo and the elves. Morgoth is also mentioned a few times (ex. in Aragorn's summary of the tale of Beren and Luthien). There are a few other brief mentions throughout LotR: when Faramir's rangers ambush the Haradrim and the Oliphaunt goes berserk, one of the rangers says: ""May the Valar turn him aside!""; at Aragorn's coronation, Gandalf says: ""Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the Valar endure!""  Certainly Tolkien had written extensively about the Valar by the writing of LotR, and they do get a few mentions, but most characters just don't have much of a reason to talk about them. Some of them (especially Sam, Merry, and Pippin) might not be aware of their existence."
lotr,375x90,PersonUsingAComputer,29,Mon May 25 04:37:19 2015 UTC,"Some of them (especially Sam, Merry, and Pippin) might not be aware of their existence.   This explanation works quite well considering how isolationist Hobbits are."

lotr,375x90,mrsimmons,6,Mon May 25 07:55:52 2015 UTC,"Fantastic comment!  To add to this a little bit (hopefully):  The characters in LotR are written as though they grew up and inhabit the world that was created for them.  There's no reason for Gandalf to explain or describe the Valar to anyone, because they are a given in this world.  Tolkien did a wonderful job, I think, of keeping exposition to a minimum other than what was revealed to us through the story and character development.  If someone had just gone on about the Valar in the book, it would have been out of character and really stuck out like a sore thumb.    Another series that I think takes this to an even further extreme is the Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe.  The story is told in first person from the PoV of someone that has grown up in this world, and many things that would be wondrous if explained fully to the reader are given barely a passing mention because they are so commonplace to the character."

But like PersonUsingAComputer said, many people might not be aware of the Valar's existance. They might have a vague notion of a god and a pantheon of supernatural beings but might not know their names. I doubt if most people in Middle-Earth can read so they probably can't study it."

Here the deities are real and Morgoth is evil and bad. But what I had in mind is this: imagine that hobbits came to bree and they were burned to death because they were pagans and because Bree-landers thought that Eru didn't like their pipeweed smoking so they were stupid fanatics. I mean 'gods' in Tolkiens works are real. People are not depading if Eru or Ainur were against homosexuality or not and they didn't kill for those reasons.

lotr,373hdc,Hunt270,2,Mon May 25 02:02:50 2015 UTC,I disagree. I worked in a theater for 3 years in high school and we would have sold out showings of Avengers in 2d and like 10 people in the 3d showing and we showed them like a half hour apart. We actually stopped showing 3D because 3D movies just don't bring in the crowd and money that the 2D showings do.
lotr,373hdc,zuul99,13,Mon May 25 02:22:54 2015 UTC,Anecdotal. In my town 3D showings are routinely sold out.  If they weren't making money on it in the big picture they'd stop.

lotr,373hdc,ReinierPersoon,24,Sun May 24 15:17:31 2015 UTC,"Forced perspective only works because you are looking with one camera, one eye as it were. If you film in 3d it's immediately obvious that Gandalf is not bigger than Bilbo, but just standing closer to the camera (double cameras to get the 3d effect). Maybe they could edit it away after the fact, but then you might as well CGI it from the start."

The 3rd extended edition is not out till around october of course, but the other two are so great. The extra nine hours are more then wild IMO. But anyway they cover this topic 100% And give you video examples of why. It seems like it was much easier for the actors before to do the forced perspective idea.

The game can get a little pricey if you do like it because it's been out for a long time and there's so much of it out there, the good news is that you can - to a certain extent - pick and choose which cycles you'd like to buy into.

At least not enough for Gandalf to mention a location other than Gladden Fields at the Council of Elrond.  He does however say that Smeagol's hobbit-like folk must have settled  that area of the river some few hundred years after the fall of Isildur. He's pretty specific about all the details of Smeagol's murder of Deagol, the finding of the ring and Smeagol's eventual departure from daylight, and himself.   There is a theory by Saruman that the Ring must have been swept out to sea by the strong current of the river, but that seems like something the Ring itself would try to prevent from happening."

I could probably pick out a few other small things, but I think the Hobbit trilogy firmly makes the case for creators to step away from their work and pass the torch for sequel/prequels (Cough Star Wars Cough)"

lotr,373tb4,leroybivins,5,Sun May 24 16:49:33 2015 UTC,"If you have some other bit of Sindarin that the name is added to, I'd approximate the name's pronounciation with Sindarin orthography, otherwise just write it with English-Tengwar (or the mode for whichever language she is a native of).  I personally don't really like the whole etymological translation practice, because the result doesn't have to do anything with the name you started with in most cases. A German guy named Siegfried isn't called Victorypeace when you refer to him in English either.  And no, afaik that isn't done in the books, only the reverse (X's name means Y in English) but I'd guess they never actually call anyone after that. The closest I remember is Aragorn naming his house after the translation of strider (Telcontar)."
lotr,373tb4,Ben_Kerman,3,Sun May 24 18:10:02 2015 UTC,"Good point about the etymological translations. I never thought about it that way. My name is Sawyer, which used to be what a woodcutter was called, so I was going to try and slap something elvish together that meant (roughly) ""guy who cuts wood."""
lotr,373tb4,slmckay73,2,Sun May 24 23:38:58 2015 UTC,"You could always give her an Elven name, as that was common.

lotr,373tb4,ElvenViking,2,Sun May 24 19:04:22 2015 UTC,"Are their examples in the books of say, a Westron/Common name being translated literally into an Elvish name?   In the King's Letter from Aragorn to Sam several hobbit-names are translated into Sindarin according to their meaning. This also occurs when the Gondorians call Frodo and Sam Daur a Berhael.  We do however have ""Eomer, Imrahil, Gimli"" in a Quenya sentence along with Olórin for ""Gandalf"" and Arakorno for ""Aragorn"" (instead of a translation, but perhaps an attempt to fit them more closely into Quenya phonology - though this was not done for ""Imrahil"" and ""Gimli"")."

lotr,36yqcr,jeggro,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:17:36 2015 UTC,I was asking because recently a librarian told me that these days you can't be a 'true librarian' without one.
lotr,36yqcr,Wiles_,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"Well, the professional position of ""librarian"" typically requires an MLS or equivalent as part of the position description. There are often many people who work in libraries who are not librarians - paraprofessionals in all parts of library operations. Here is the American Library Association's short description of such positions.  There are exceptions, sometimes. My small hometown's library has had the last two directors earn their MLS remotely while already holding the position. The university library I work for has had people with their MLS in paraprofessional positions until fairly recently. I think everybody with the degree has had the opportunity to transfer into full ""librarian"" positions now, but some people with specialized duties/training but not an MLS who were in the same category are now classified as librarians within our organizational structure (although if you were to ask them what their job was, they'd probably use the job they actually do instead of the generic ""librarian"").  That doesn't generally stop a fair number of laypeople to just refer to anybody who works in a library as a librarian. Many don't even know that there is an post-graduate degree attached to the profession. This in turn leads to some librarians to take issue with this usage since they have the degree. A more extreme example of this would be referring to a nurse as ""doctor"" when speaking to an MD (it's more extreme because nurses have a fairly extensive training program of their own, while a library page, for example, has no such requirement)."

It sounds pathetic but I really needed that movie at that time of my life.  Fast forward to The Return of the King. I was five months pregnant with our oldest, but I swore I'd sit through the whole screening without a bathroom break, and I did.   Today, I am forty years old.

Upon rewatching FotR, I realized the events at Amon Hen are really what solidify Aragorn's destiny as king.  He has a moment of clarity and let's Frodo go to his fate alone. Also, in hearing Boromir's last words, he finally accepts his fate as King.  This is portrayed in the film with him taking the White Tree bracers from Boromir and wearing them from this point on.   To me this was the most accurate portrayal of 'fate' or 'doom' as Tolkien uses much more frequently in stories in the Silmarillion or Children of Hurin (mostly referring to Turin). This 'fate' is something that is almost silently accepted rather than forcefully taken, and I think this scene really shows that well.  This is of course bookended, with the scene at the Black Gate, where once again he charges many orcs, accepting his fate or doom.  http://i.imgur.com/pvCnUGc.gif"

lotr,36sxxq,bebesee,6,Fri May 22 06:40:49 2015 UTC,"I always find it funny when re-reading the books how Aragorn acts in them compared to the movies. In the movies he is leery about men, going to Gondor, becoming King, etc... but in the books he is on a high horse parading around that he is ""the King returned"" etc... I remember my first time reading it through (seen the movies at that time already) and I was a little put off at time, thinking ""damn dude, I preferred Peter Jackson's version of you better."" That being said I love how much of a wise ass Gandalf and Legolas are in the books."
lotr,36sxxq,hitokiri-battousai,2,Fri May 22 10:34:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, Sir. Viggo approaches the role with a lot of humility. Book Aragorn is slightly more of a douche."
lotr,36sxxq,EvilRobotUsses,9,Fri May 22 17:02:39 2015 UTC,"That's not really a great way to put it. Tolkien's Aragorn is very much influenced by characters like Beowulf and Sigurd. In his world and society, he is, as a matter of fact, on a higher level than other men, and extreme humbleness is not expected of him. He certainly isn't cocksure, but he does play the part of fulfilling and displaying his lineage.  I think what many people miss in the books is that Aragorn is not meant to be one of the key, starring characters. He's the foil to the much more humble and simple hobbits. He's the traditional hero - the one we expect to do all the saving. However, it is those characters almost entirely his opposite (in the 'good' spectrum, anyways) that end up saving the world.  It's a twist on the Germanic epics from which his character is derived, and from which The Lord of the Rings takes so much influence. Without the proud sort of Aragorn, that element is lost."
lotr,36sxxq,Edledhron,69,Fri May 22 17:25:44 2015 UTC,"The Amon Hen fight scene was probably my favourite in the entire film series. I've never really thought about why but I think it's probably because it's not as big a set piece climax as Helm's Deep or Pellanor Fields so there's a better focus on the choreography and individual badass moves. Also it's before Legolas's badassery went over the top, not that I don't like the swashbuckling action ridiculousness that Legolas gets up to later but I guess it just makes it that little more difficult to believe and that bit more Holywood-y."
lotr,36sxxq,windowfoam,15,Thu May 21 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I like it because it is one of the few times we see Legolas' elvish knives(I have met countless people who don't even remember they exist)."

lotr,36sxxq,Matthew_McHiniNini,3,Fri May 22 13:21:48 2015 UTC,"I like it because it is such an emotional time for the fellowship. Boromir has initiated the break up of the fellowship because he was corrupted by the ring. He then saw his mistake and, knowing he couldn't make up for the damage he caused to the group he fought to the death to protect the two hobbits, they no longer played any strategic importance but it was important for boromir to die protecting them. The two hobbits themselves put up a valiant fight against impossible odds. Aragorn has accepted his fate and accepted the really hard decision to let frodo go alone and is now again fighting to what he can only assume is to the death to give frodo enough time. The fellowship is over and gimli and legolas are the only people who don't know it. The fight ends with them unsure how to continue. Until they realise that the war is bigger than their stated mission and they adapt to fight a new enemy and divert attention away from Frodo.  This scene was more than a fight to protect themselves physically it was an emotional fight. They were fighting the break up of what had become a strong friendship and mutual respect and they were fighting to still be of help to those they had failed/left  Its a beautiful scene and the action does not detract from the sentiment"
lotr,36sxxq,Spacedementia87,3,Fri May 22 13:27:08 2015 UTC,"Even if it wasn't Boromirs fault, he would still protect them to death. He may not be as wise as Faramir, but he is pretty valiant. And their camp would be raided anyway."

He helped take down a cave troll and numerous orcs earlier in the film without batting an eye.  Waded straight out to protect Frodo against the Watcher in the Water.  And he's not intimidated by power either. He's seen one of his best friends take on a Balrog, his girlfriend took on the 9 riders, he pretty much told one of the bearers of the elven rings that he wants to bang their daughter.

It's the equivalent of Storm Trooper accuracy with medieval technology.  Making their opponents look like a bunch of imbeciles doesn't make the Heroes look badass.

lotr,36z66e,Gethisa,11,Sat May 23 10:40:23 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd read the Hobbit, then the LOTR books. Then I'd watch the LOTR films before the Hobbit. Because the LOTR films were made first, there are throwbacks to them in the Hobbit trilogy, and to be honest you can watch either series without the other and have it still make sense. But reading the Hobbit would give you a little more context to the LOTR, and watching the LOTR first will give you a bit of understanding as to discrepancies in the Hobbit trilogy.  TL;DR: Hobbit book > LOTR books > LOTR films > Hobbit films. In my opinion."

The first mention of his staff glowing only says that ""from its tip there came a faint radiance."" After that it's described variously as ""glimmering,"" ""like a will-o'-the-wisp,"" and when he lights up the great hall, ""like a flash of lightning.""  There is a line from from the guardroom that they sleep in (where Pippin pushes the skeleton down the well in the films, in the book he simply drops a pebble) that describes Gandalf igniting a ""chip,"" but it's not really worded in such a way to imply that it was from his staff:   The last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled on the floor, shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his knees. The flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose, and the puff of smoke.   As for the films, my guess is it was just a stylistic choice. It probably looked nicer/more plausible to have him put that stone on the end and light it up than to just make glowing wood. If I recall it was a pretty simple effect, they just put a light bulb at the end of his staff and ran a power chord down through his costume."

lotr,36maic,star_boy2005,3,Wed May 20 15:40:27 2015 UTC,"A word of advice. When I first got into pipe smoking I too wanted a pipe like the ones Bilbo and Gandalf smoked. The shape of the pipe is called a Churchwarden, by the way. So I found one on Amazon for about $25 and it was okay for a little while. But the stem was made of a cheap, brittle plastic and the joint between the stem and the pipe's shank was weak and it broke pretty quickly. The bowl was also carved from Pear wood, which isn't the best type of wood for a pipe.  Cut to recent times, I've since gotten into pipe smoking in a much more serious way and have learned a lot about how LotR fans are exploited for their interest in ""Gandalf pipes"" but general ignorance about pipes in general. If you want to get your girlfriend a real Churchwarden pipe that will give a much better smoke and will last her a lifetime, try searching for a Churchwarden at one of the reputable pipe retailers online. Here's one I picked out as an example, that appears to be in your price range and is a decent quality pipe. Here's a more general search for Churchwardens in the $50-100 range.  The replica pipes on Thinkgeek, although they look authentic, are made of teak, which is not a good wood for making a pipe. It's going to impart a nasty flavor to the smoke and she'll likely wind up putting the pipe on a shelf to look at instead of actually smoking. Which is fine. Depends on what you want."

lotr,36iig5,Psy_Kira,21,Tue May 19 19:04:18 2015 UTC,One of the things I did like about the Hobbit trilogy is the music score.  The Thrice Welcome/Esgaroth Theme was stuck in my head for damn weeks.

The first 3 films action sequences were far superior not only because of the lack of ridiculous cgi, but because they were used well in character development. For example  Aragorn's rage at Boromir's death and his loyalty to Frodo at the breaking of the fellowship was amazingly protrayed.   The dwarves (apart from Thorin) had so little dialogue in the 2nd and 3rd films and I thought this was the main letdown, and PJ sacrificed what could have been a wonderful set of characters."

The very dwarves that were completely bland in the book though, right? I love the dwarves in the movie, even if they could've been better."
lotr,36iig5,kerouacrimbaud,9,Tue May 19 21:18:21 2015 UTC,"I feel that they could have spent time developing those bland book characters rather than adding Azog, Radagast and Tauriel and taking away from the characters actually in the original story."
lotr,36iig5,BoscotheBear,5,Tue May 19 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"Personally, I reread the book last year and I found it lacking. I really enjoyed all the things they brought into the movies. And if you watch the Appendices you can see the care and effort they brought forth to make those things happen. Different strokes."
lotr,36iig5,orbit222,3,Tue May 19 22:06:27 2015 UTC,"Precisely.  I think the book is a great children's book, which makes sense as we all know.  Children's books intentionally lack a lot of round and dynamic characters aside from the main protagonist and maybe one other character.    However, I do think they could have focused more on the Dwarves in the films as opposed to jamming Azog into the story.  It would have been a bold move, and the studio probably wouldn't have gone for it, but man wouldn't it have been awesome if the Hobbit trilogy was the opposite of what we got?  A lyrically paced, character-centered film that uses CGI only to supplement the characters.  Three films would be a nice fit for such a venture, because the actual story took place over a similar length of time that LOTR did once Frodo and Co. made for Bree.   The Hobbit had plenty of room to breathe, but I think PJ decided to hyper-ventilate instead of opting for deep, slow breaths."
lotr,36iig5,BoscotheBear,1 point,Wed May 20 02:03:35 2015 UTC,"I think you're right in that there's nothing intrinsically wrong with treating the storyline of the source material differently in an adaptation. Even if The Hobbit was a children's book, you probably still could make a very decent epic fantasy adventure movie in the vein of the LOTR films. It's the execution, for me at least, in which the films sort of fall flat, rather than the premise."
lotr,36iig5,orbit222,1 point,Sat May 23 01:30:33 2015 UTC,"That's fair, but here's how I look at it. On the one hand, I could have nothing. On the other hand, I could have visually and musically realized scenes including Bilbo in Gollum's cave, the stone giant battle, Smaug's taunting, the lovely scenes in Bilbo's home with the dwarves, and so on. Like, to me, nothing in the movies was worse than getting nothing at all. Every minute of it was a positive for me. Could sections have been executed better than they actually were? Sure, but you could say that for just about every piece of media ever. My life is more entertaining for having the Hobbit films in them, not to mention the appendices which I adore. So when people rip the films to shreds, I'm like c'mon, they really do that little for you? It's possible, but that's just not how I see it."

I fully understand why you find it so grating because ultimately these sorts of reactions are rather silly, stupid even, and I admit sometimes I'm guilty of it (ask me about the 70's LOTR movie if you really want to see someone spout fire and brimstone). And it's true, not everything about the Hobbit movies were awful. I still like PJ as a director, I still think that Unexpected Journey is a fine movie in its own right, and even though I didn't like the next two, there were still some parts and scenes I liked. I liked Smaug, I liked Bard, I liked the scenes of Bilbo returning home. Thing is, when films like these have so much that really do work on screen, it's just disappointing that they don't have more of it instead of stuff that, for me, really, really doesn't."
lotr,36iig5,TheScarletCravat,1 point,Sat May 23 18:14:42 2015 UTC,Totally agree! It's a matter of perspective.  [Nothing <-------> Hobbit Trilogy we got <-------> what the trilogy could have been]  I'm thrilled to have the movies because they're much better than nothing and they entertain me.  Other people hate the movies because they're much worse than they could have been and don't entertain as much as they could have.
lotr,36iig5,1337Gandalf,14,Sat May 23 18:29:55 2015 UTC,"The hobbit alludes to Bilbo and Balin forming a friendship, but we don't get to see much of it ""on screen"" in the book... Balin gains respect for Bilbo when he manages to sneak past him while on look-out watch, Balin is the only dwarf that agrees to enter the lonely mountain with Bilbo when they first open the secret door, and Balin is given a scene at the end of the book where he and Gandalf visit Bilbo in the shire a year or some after the quest is finished. The Fellowship book drops a line or two about the friendship. Frodo thinking about Bilbo and Balins long friendship after they find his tomb, or Bilbo saying that he didn't really feel at home in Erebor when he traveled there before returning to Rivendell (he mentions it not being the same since Balin went away).   I was extremely excited for the hobbit movies. One of the liberties I was hoping jackson would take was to further develop Bilbo and Balins friendship. I knew they were good friends, but we never really get to see that friendship in depth. To me, its one of the greatest failures of the Hobbit movies. Rather than develop what we already had and could use more of, we got a whole new story and new relationships, casting aside the ones we wanted to have fleshed out."
lotr,36iig5,Torkoolguy,11,Tue May 19 19:00:28 2015 UTC,Yep. I don't understand how three films leaves us with no characterisation for the dwarf cast in comparison to the Fellowship.

Knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age-old hide,  but ever thickened from  within with layer on layer of evil growth.  The blade scored it with a dreadful gash, but  those hideous folds could not be pierced by  any strength of men, not though Elf or  Dwarf should forge the steel or the hand of Beren or of Turin wield it. She yielded to  the stroke, and then heaved up  the great bag of her belly high above Sam's head.  Poison frothed and bubbled from  the wound. Now splaying  her legs she drove her  huge bulk down on him again. Too soon. For Sam still stood upon his feet, and  dropping his own sword, with both hands  he held the elven-blade point upwards,  fending off that ghastly roof; and so Shelob,  with the driving force of her own cruel  will, with strength greater than any warrior's hand, thrust  herself upon a bitter spike.  Deep, deep it pricked, as Sam  was crushed slowly to the ground.   I would personally question a trolls ability to pierce her carapace. Sam only managed it because Shelob practically slammed herself into an elvish blade at full force. Trolls are very powerful, but I feel like Beren or Turin would be on a similar power level to them... and without a magic blade, the troll may be completely ineffective."

That is the first and last mention of Ancalagon in the Silmarillion. There isn't really much you can infer from that unfortunately.

Ancalagon is huge, sure. But to come close to putting numbers to it, like the chart floating around, is worthless."
lotr,36h9xc,ReallyFat,5,Tue May 19 13:59:15 2015 UTC,"The mountains of Thangorodrim are the towers. Tolkien uses the terms interchangeably in the Silmarillion. And I think that breaking all three mountains in one fall, the mightiest towers of Middle-earth, must show that Ancalagon is very large indeed. We can say that he is no less than a certain size, which we can calculate  relative to Thangorodrim. But you're right in that we can't ascribe an absolute size to him, so that chart is probably wrong."
lotr,36h9xc,Uluithiad,7,Tue May 19 14:09:00 2015 UTC,"Not much, unless we can also infer something about the size of Vanyar and Orcs from the way Beleriand crumbled in that same war. If we assumed the devastation must follow traditional physics with Ancalagon, why does the rest of the War of Wrath get a pass to do otherwise?"
lotr,36h9xc,ReallyFat,1 point,Tue May 19 18:06:44 2015 UTC,"Because the destruction of Beleriand, the sinking, the disappearence of the Sirion, and the rest wasn't caused by the Orcs and the Vanyar. That would have been caused by the tumults of the battles of the Maiar, and the dragons, and the Balrogs. Furthermore, we're already told what the size of the Elves and the Orcs is. So I think it's safe to assume that they were not responsible for that damage.   Ancalagon, on the other hand, just caused three of the most colossal mountains to be ruined simply by falling upon them. I don't see why regular physics shouldn't apply to him, since it generally applies everywhere else in Middle-earth (barring where magic is involved)."
lotr,36h9xc,Uluithiad,3,Tue May 19 18:39:14 2015 UTC,"and the rest wasn't caused by the Orcs and the Vanyar   That's not what the text says.   For so great was the fury of those adversaries that the northern regions of the western world were rent asunder, and the sea roared in through many chasms, and there was confusion and great noise; and rivers perished or found new paths, and the valleys were upheaved as the hills trod down; and Sirion was no more.   Dragons had fought for Melkor before, and arguably ones more able to ruin the very earth, since their fighting and breath would have been grounded, the earlier sorts not having wings. Balrogs had been fighting through all the First Age. As to Maiar on the side of the Valar, what Maiar? Eonwe is mentioned, and there were likely others, but when we are told of the hosts preparing, it is Vanyar, and Noldor, and Teleri steering the ships, and Men in Beleriand joining up. It is not safe to assume that the destruction was caused by forces not even mentioned to be there in any appreciable numbers.  Especially because physics does break down whenever Tolkien wants to do something mythologically grand.  Like when Morgoth is held by Ungoliant.     Therefore that region was called Lammoth; for the echoes of his voice dwelt there ever after, so that any who cried aloud in that land awoke them, and all the waste between the hills and the sea was filled with a clamour as of voices in anguish. The cry of Morgoth in that hour was the greatest and most dreadful that was ever heard in the northern world; the mountains shook, and the earth trembled, and rocks were riven asunder.   Or when Feanor died.     Then he died; but he had neither burial nor tomb, for so fiery was his spirit that as it sped his body fell to ash, and was borne away like smoke;   Those are a couple unique options from the Silmarillion. But I could easily point out how frequently people's heads erupt in fire when their helms are cloven, how water isn't deadly at terminal velocity for Gandalf and the Balrog, and a great number of other things, many to do with deaths.  It makes it important that Ancalagon crushed Thangorodrim not by simply falling on them, but by falling on them in his death."
lotr,36h9xc,ReallyFat,2,Tue May 19 19:17:02 2015 UTC,"Dragons had fought for Melkor before, and arguably ones more able to ruin the very earth, since their fighting and breath would have been grounded, the earlier sorts not having wings. Balrogs had been fighting through all the First Age.    Yes. As have the Elves and Orcs, and they never caused such destruction before that, or ever after. How then can you say that it was they who caused upheavals and destruction to the earth on such a huge scale?  And only Glaurung had emerged from Angband before, no other dragon is mentioned in any other battle except those who were present at Gondolin's fall. And those did destroy the city almost entirely. Glaurung sacked Nargothrond and burned Talath Dirnen, and that's the only time he fought any significant battle (I haven't counted his skirmish with Fingon because he was weak and he fled quickly, or his part in the Nirnaeth because he fled again after getting stabbed). And that was against Elves, not any foe to match him.   As to Maiar on the side of the Valar, what Maiar? Eonwe is mentioned, and there were likely others   Yes, there was him, and there were definitely others. The host is called the host of the Valar, and a reference is made to the Ainur present:   For the host of the Valar were arrayed in forms young and fair and terrible   The majority of the army would have been the Valar and the Maiar beneath them, if that is how the army is described. The Elves and Men do not possess the ability to clothe themselves in such forms   but when we are told of the hosts preparing, it is Vanyar, and Noldor, and Teleri steering the ships, and Men in Beleriand joining up.    They marched under the banners of the host of the Valar. Yes, they were present, but they were not the whole army.    Especially because physics does break down whenever Tolkien wants to do something mythologically grand... I could easily point out how frequently people's heads erupt in fire when their helms are cloven, how water isn't deadly at terminal velocity for Gandalf and the Balrog, and a great number of other things, many to do with deaths.   This isn't comparable to the destruction of the three mightiest towers of Middle-earth.  The Dragon will have had to be of a certain size to manage that. Perhaps that it is his death is important, but you cannot say that the same effect would have been achieved if he were an average sized dragon."

If the following ages were about 3000 years long as the 2nd and 3rd were, we would be in the 5th or 6th (in the 1950s at the time of writing). Since he believes the ages have ""quickened"" (i.e. they are shorter), we're actually in the 6th or 7th age (again in the 1950s). I imagine at this point we're in the 7th. Tolkien's ages end during events of great historical importance. If the 6th began following WWII, I think you could make the argument that the 7th began following the end of the Cold War."

None of them were worshipped, and none asked to be worshipped, except Melkor. The term 'god' was often used by Tolkien for the Valar in the beginning, but he discontinued it. To Tolkien, the Valar are the archangels, the Maiar are the angels. Melkor plays the role of Satan, the fallen archangel. But God is still one, alone. He is called by the Elves Eru Ilúvatar. That is who the Númenoreans made their offerings to before the fall, and that's who (presumably) the Elves would call upon too, or at least the Calaquendi."
lotr,36fgyl,Uluithiad,3,Tue May 19 17:37:20 2015 UTC,"He didn't really discontinue it. He moved away from it in that he found others ways to refer to them more often, replacing select uses of the word 'gods' with other words and phrases. But it was never all of them, or even most."
lotr,36fgyl,ReallyFat,1 point,Tue May 19 21:03:44 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, in the published Silmarillion, the word 'god'  is never used for the Valar. The only time it appears in the whole book is in on the back cover, on the blurb. That was not written by Tolkien. The word 'god' in reference to the Valar is only used in the older texts, such as the lay of Leithian, by Morgoth and Finrod, etc."
lotr,36fgyl,Uluithiad,3,Wed May 20 06:21:45 2015 UTC,"That's not true. There are several uses of the word in the Silmarillion. Here's one:   Below them lay the woods of Orome, and westward shimmered the fields and pastures of Yavanna, gold beneath the tall wheat of the gods.   -The Silmarillion, 'Of the Darkening of Valinor'  The published Silmarillion, though, isn't really a useful tool. It isn't the word of Tolkien as written by Tolkien. It is an attempt at constructing a self-consistent narrative by CT, as he describes in the Foreword, and is quite unsuitable for making claims about what or what his father was trying to do or ultimately did late in life.  There are far more occurrences of 'gods' left to stand in the texts found in Morgoth's Ring, for example, and those are in no way among the older texts."
lotr,36fgyl,ReallyFat,0,Wed May 20 09:31:13 2015 UTC,"My mistake, I must have missed these. But in any case, Tolkien himself doesn't present them as gods. There may be places he forgot to replace them, or perhaps, as he with many words, god with a lowercase g meant something else to him. He makes it clear that the creator is still the One, and the Valar are just under him, ruling over what he allows them to. They aren't gods at all. In fact, in the Athrabeth and the Tale of Adanel (which I understand aren't at the same level of canon, but they're still pretty much there and don't contradict other texts), we learn that the principal point that Eru became angered towards Men was that they worshipped an Ainu."

If you wanted to make this an argument about the difference between capital 'Gods' and miniscule 'gods', then you had no reason to even start. Nevermind that Tolkien did continue to refer to the Valar as capital 'Gods'. See the use of the word in Text I of Myths Transformed, and Text IV, or the B2 manuscript of the Akallabeth, or dozens of other scatterings around the last few volumes of HoME, which I've already mentioned mean more for what Tolkien actually did than the Silmarillion.

The conflict that ended that Spring of Arda was what led to the fall of the lamps. The lamps were so great that in their fall they shattered the original symmetry of Arda, one of the bigger changes in its geography. Almaren too was destroyed, and so the Valar moved to Valinor.  However, the world was also changed fairly significantly in subsequent events: during the War of Wrath in the First Age between the Valar and Morgoth, Beleriand was drowned, and Númenor was created. The final last great change was the Downfall of Númenor, also known as the Drowning of Númenor, wherein the world was stretched and made spherical, and Aman and Tol Eressëa were removed from the mortal lands - ""the Circles of the World"", and made inaccessible, save to those permitted to do so by the Valar."

Gondor's are not quite as clear on the map but then they aren't quite as static as Rohan's. These are the borders as I’d generally put them at the time of the War of the Ring (keep in mind, by rights Gondor would have claim to a much greater area than this):    To the north, the border is shared with Rohan. In the west, the border would follow the river Isen to the sea. To the east and south it would follow the Anduin to the sea.   Alternatively, you may also choose to include Ithilien which would extend the borders east to Mordor and south to the Poros. At various points in Gondor's history this as well as even more land south of the Poros would all have been considered part of Gondor proper, though I believe at the time of the War of the Ring the vast majority of Gondorians lived within the bordors defined in the bullets above.

lotr,36chks,Tandborste,6,Mon May 18 07:39:20 2015 UTC,"If you put them on, nothing would happen, since the one ring has been destroyed, those rings are simply beautiful rings with no power left to them.  If you wore them while the One ring still existed, that'd be a different story. The 7 and the 9 were the same type of greater ring, and would have reacted the same if worn by a human. You'd enter the world of shadow, be invisible, you'd slow down your aging process as its power to preserve you extended your life unnaturally by stretching it out, and eventually you'd become a wraith.  If Sauron had the one ring on his finger, and you wore any of the magic rings, you'd be dominated to his will. I am uncertain if the Nazgul were under Sauron's control while he did not have the ring because he had dominated them while he had the one ring and they had had their 9 rings, or if because sauron could control the ring wraiths without the one (Sauron took the 9 rings back after the humans who wore them became wraiths, and he did not redistribute them). So, its possible you'd be enslaved to sauron's will, but it's also possible you'd just become a free wandering wraith and not under his direct control until he got the One ring back. It is important to note that Sauron had the ability to dominate and summon any evil creature, without the one ring, as was true with Gollum being summoned to Mordor, so i'd guess you'd become one of Sauron's gimps, regardless of whether he had the one ring or not.   If you wore one of the elven rings, you may have more power to preserve the land and world around you, though I do not know that a mortal could tap into their power... though perhaps within time a human could learn to do so. The only people we see use the elf rings of power for their purposes are Gandalf who is a Maiar, and some Noldor elves who are practically demi gods. Not sure if its within human capabilities to do what they did.  http://oakroadsystems.com/genl/ringfaq.htm"

And if he often uses the Ring to make himself invisible, he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks in the twilight under the eye of the Dark Power that rules the Rings. Yes, sooner or later – later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but neither strength nor good purpose will last – sooner or later the Dark Power will devour him.’"
lotr,36chks,Brandybucks_Coffee,1 point,Mon May 18 14:12:41 2015 UTC,"Since all rings are controlled by the One Ring, assuming you'd keep on wearing one of those rings, Sauron would try to control you and your power, and you'd probably be turned into one of his servants."

It felt like Middle-earth was someplace you might go someday, but in the Hobbit it felt like, well, a movie. The cast (of LOTR) felt more like a family too, in the Hobbit they just felt like a group of actors. Honestly I think Mr.Jackson just had too many ideas that he wanted to put in the Hobbit films.

lotr,36bp0s,mtanva,1 point,Mon May 18 15:53:36 2015 UTC,"Sauron frightens them, they want to take what the Men and Elves have.  Back when they served Morgoth, Sauron's old boss, they probably were very much enslaved to his will, since Morgoth corrupting the world is at least partly responsible for their existence (the exact nature of the origin of Orcs was still uncertain even to Tolkien at his death.)  After that point, they probably kept on hating the Elves for being superior and because of their old wrongs.  Sauron probably promises them dominion of the world and stuff, and even if they don't really believe him, each individual Orc probably still thinks he (or she) can get what they want by helping Sauron.   This probably explains their horrible morale in battle; they obey only in fear, not in devotion to the cause. So once things kinda begin going south they break off."

Without Boromir attempting to seize the Ring, it's likely Frodo would not have felt the need to abandon the Fellowship. But without Aragorn to travel the Paths of the Dead and rally the forces of southern Gondor, Minas Tirith would have fallen and Frodo's quest would almost certainly have failed."

If you would let me choose, then I should appoint three companions: Sam, who could not bear it otherwise; and Gimli; and myself.

Legolas said a small piece was enough to fill the stomach of a grown man. I'd say a big meal would be 1500 calories, especially for an active hiker. Now on the eyeball test, the tiny bite Legolas takes means somewhere between 15-20 meals at the minimum per piece.   So on the lower bound, 15x1500 kcal would be 22500 kcal per square, 30000 kcal for the upper bound. Then multiply that by four since he had that many already, and Pippin ate between 90,000 and 120,000 kcals.   Given that a pound of fat is ~3555 calories we can say he would have gained between 25 and 33 lbs of fat approximately."

lotr,35yujv,Frans_Hals,70,Thu May 14 17:36:39 2015 UTC,"It started off as pride in his own skill and envy of Eru's creative powers, but eventually spiraled down into mere spite. In the very early days of Arda Morgoth wanted power and control, of Arda and every living creature in it. As time passed and this proved completely impossible, Morgoth grew increasingly insane and destructive: if he couldn't have what he wanted, neither could anyone else. In Morgoth's Ring Tolkien explains:   This was sheer nihilism, and negation its one ultimate object: Morgoth would no doubt, if he had been victorious, have ultimately destroyed even his own 'creatures', such as the Orcs, when they had served his sole purpose in using them: the destruction of Elves and Men. Melkor's final impotence and despair lay in this: that whereas the Valar (and in their degree Elves and Men) could still love 'Arda Marred', that is Arda with a Melkor-ingredient, and could still heal this or that hurt, or produce from its very marring, from its state as it was, things beautiful and lovely, Melkor could do nothing with Arda, which was not from his own mind and was interwoven with the work and thoughts of others: even left alone he could only have gone raging on till all was levelled again into a formless chaos. And yet even so he would have been defeated, because it would still have 'existed', independent of his own mind, and a world in potential."
lotr,35yujv,PersonUsingAComputer,16,Thu May 14 19:22:28 2015 UTC,"This is great.  It pairs with what I was saying, and suggests that Tolkien's idea of ""evil"" is in a sense entropy."
lotr,35yujv,AmbiguousAnonymous,6,Thu May 14 20:31:29 2015 UTC,"Phrasing it that way implies that order would somehow be inherently good. Which isn't really the case in Arda.   It isn't Melkor's objective that makes him evil (although harm it would cause to others is). Melkor's intentions are a far more important. The fact that Melkor did this out a rejection of Eru, an over abundance of selfishness, and malice towards others, are closer to the root of the issue.  Take for example Tolkien's conception of Pity and Mercy: If they are given with the expectation that there will be some personal gain out of it, then it's not really pity or mercy, and they are not really ""good,"" or at least, not the same degree of goodness. Frodo's intentions, not just his actions are what made him truly admirable in Tolkien's eyes, I would say the same for Melkor in regards to his evilness."
lotr,35yujv,PrivateChicken,2,Thu May 14 22:33:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say this is true, for the same reason PrivateChicken mentions. Tolkien's idea of Evil is simply not staying true to Eru Illuvatar's will, which is a deviation or isolation from Eru, thinking that you can impose your will into his creation.   This is exactly why the Istari are told not to use their powers, because their magic is imposing their will on something Eru has already set into motion, and that if they use their magic in a sense that is not out of desperation or absolute necessity they would begin to believe that they know what is the right thing to do when a ""faithful"" person would know that it isn't necessary because the will of Illuvatar would play out as it should and good will win.  The Valar made the mistake of not following Eru's will once and it nearly cost them all of Arda. The Numenoreans did the same and Eru smited them and their land. Gandalf is arguably the most faithful person out of all of the Ainur, Eru sees how faithful he is to the path and resurrects him when he dies so that he may complete his quest."
lotr,35yujv,xxmindtrickxx,1 point,Fri May 15 02:03:21 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to add to first part, and /u/personusingacomputer probably knows the area to find this or if it is even ""canon"", but I think Melkor spent a lot of time in isolation in the void searching for the ""secret fire"" that allowed Eru to create beings of free will, in the void and in isolation away from everything Eru created prior to the Music of the Ainur, Melkor developed strange thoughts - which then leads to the discord in the music, which creates Arda-marred."
lotr,35yujv,xxmindtrickxx,5,Thu May 14 23:23:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's mentioned at the beginning of the Silmarillion:   But now Ilúvatar sat and hearkened, and for a great while it seemed good to him, for in the music there were no flaws. But as the theme progressed, it came into the heart of Melkor to interweave matters of his own imagining that were not in accord with the theme of Ilúvatar, for he sought therein to increase the power and glory of the part assigned to himself. To Melkor among the Ainur had been given the greatest gifts of power and knowledge, and he had a share in all the gifts of his brethren. He had gone often alone into the void places seeking the Imperishable Flame; for desire grew hot within him to bring into Being things of his own, and it seemed to him that Ilúvatar took no thought for the Void, and he was impatient of its emptiness. Yet he found not the Fire, for it is with Ilúvatar. But being alone he had begun to conceive thoughts of his own unlike those of his brethren.  Some of these thoughts he now wove into his music, and straightway discord arose about him, and many that sang nigh him grew despondent, and their thought was disturbed and their music faltered; but some began to attune their music to his rather than to the thought which they had at first. Then the discord of Melkor spread ever wider, and the melodies which had been heard before foundered in a sea of turbulent sound. But Ilúvatar sat and hearkened until it seemed that about his throne there was a raging storm, as of dark waters that made war one upon another in an endless wrath that would not be assuaged."
lotr,35yujv,PersonUsingAComputer,1 point,Thu May 14 23:31:40 2015 UTC,"I posted this below, but I think I remember reading that Morgoth was the only of the gods to feel the emotion of fear."
lotr,35yujv,Raeldcr,7,Fri Jun 5 21:30:46 2015 UTC,"His unequaled power among the Valar makes him feel that to achieve the highest form of order, he must submit others to his superior will. I don't think it is envy as much as his belief that he truly is superior and so his utter control would be superior to all else.  This is shown primarily in his desire to change the songs in Ainulindalë. To make the best song he plays over everyone else and starts his own tune.  He doesn't realize that Eru is actually the most powerful and that Eru's song can be superior. He wants dominion over all, especially the children of Ilùvatar because he wants himself to be the ruler of all.  edit: I wrote this in response to someone who said that pride leads to the downfall of several characters.  Well yes, but these things are happening at different levels. At the level of the song, is changing your tune truly evil? Does Melkor really have malice or does he simply want to play a new tune? He has objectively the most ability. I'd say rather that evil happens to truly manifest only when the will of Eru is dismissed. Aule created the dwarves but was that evil? He yielded to Eru when it was done and it remained a non-evil act.  I won't say I disagree with you really, I just want to emphasize that although those analogies are completely valid, I don't know if Melkor's deviation from the song was at that time truly ""pride"". The songs are the direct cause of what happens in Arda, so what Melkor does in Arda can not be thought of as his decision then, but a direct result of how he participated in the song.  Melkor adds to the song because he wishes ""to increase the power and glory of the part assigned to himself."" This is not ""evil"" yet I would say. Nor would I say that it was simply out of pride that he did this. He simply wished to create.  Who is to say that originally it was pride that drove Melkor to deviate from the song. That deviation however did lead to his actions in Arda and so may have manifested later as pride.  Just as deviating from the song may not be seen as ""evil"" within the context of Ainulindale, but it is truly evil within the context of Melkor's actions within Arda, though the latter follows directly from the former.  I believe I can elaborate by drawing attention to the distinct connotations that ""pride"" has. On the one hand ""pride"" implies that one's conception of one's self is greater than it actually is. On the other hand, it can also mean one recognizes one's positive attributes without necessarily putting others down. The actions within the songs and later in Arda are arenas where the same attribute may manifest differently as things become more and more complex over time.  I hold that Eru did not create Melkor as evil, merely as the most capable. The evil of Melkor is rather an inevitably emergent phenomenon as perceived by others.  I hope that I am allowed to say that the power of the one ring is analogous to the power that Melkor possesses. The key here is the concept of power, the namesake of the Valar. Gandalf said that if he were to possess the ring he would use it to do good and that it would eventually result in more evil than Sauron himself could perform. By acting on his conception of ""good"", Gandalf could not escape from the inevitability that it would end as evil when he forced everyone to be good, just as Melkor wishes to undo all that was created by the other Valar.  I think this interpretation is important because it shows the relativity of morality. One can perform evil while thinking one is good. In the end, evil really is the manifestation of the inevitable rejection of Eru ""Iluvatar"" (father of all) and nothing else. These works by Tolkien are particularly focused on human nature in the context of Christian mythology. Just as man contains original sin, Eru's Ea is also born with sin. One can say that Melkor is evil, but if he were not then perhaps some time later it would be Manwe.  So, it's not ""pride"" that causes Melkor's evil, rather it is simply an inevitability that pride should arise and that it in turn leads to evil. Thus Ea itself is the genesis of Melkor's pride."
lotr,35yujv,jstock23,2,Thu May 14 20:06:10 2015 UTC,"I know you had already written this and it is smart and good writing but jesus that is a wall of text that debates alot of semantics and specific ideas that can be summed up way easier, by just getting rid of most of it.   One can perform evil while thinking one is good. In the end, evil really is the manifestation of the inevitable rejection of Eru ""Iluvatar"" (father of all) and nothing else. These works by Tolkien are particularly focused on human nature in the context of Christian mythology. Just as man contains original sin, Eru's Ea is also born with sin. One can say that Melkor is evil, but if he were not then perhaps some time later it would be Manwe.   This is really well written and I 100% agree with it. I actually wrote something to a higher comment that was not as well written but with the exact same idea. I did that before scrolling all the way down to see this.   So, it's not ""pride"" that causes Melkor's evil, rather it is simply an inevitability that pride should arise and that it in turn leads to evil. Thus Ea itself is the genesis of Melkor's pride.   Pride is definitely part of Melkor's evil. Isolation drawn from the inspiration to be greater than Eru leads to him seeking the secret fire in the void, when he can't find it he begins coveting Eru's power and creating strange thoughts, when the music begins he is angry, jealous and arrogant and challenges Eru which creates arda-marred and causes many of the other Ainur to attune to Melkor's discord. Eru scolds him and it is pride that refuses to let go of the idea that Eru is greater than him. Even though Eru points out the concept that Melkor could never be greater than him because Melkor is of Eru."
lotr,35yujv,xxmindtrickxx,2,Fri May 15 02:13:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! Sorry about the length.  I just think that Tolkien wanted to get across that humanity is fundamentally flawed and that it is not a defect but a reality. That all consciousness has this flaw and that it can't be fixed nor should it because it is fundamental to consciousness itself.
lotr,35yujv,jstock23,1 point,Fri May 15 02:53:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's what Tolkien is trying to get across. It is only all consciousness created from the original flaw that is flawed, meaning that Eru himself does not (and could not) share the flaw, and by extension that Eru's adherents ought to concern themselves with avoiding choices that would cause this flaw to impact reality (like Gandalf wisely refusing to take possession of the ring, knowing that the ring is itself the embodiment of this flaw, and that doing anything other than destroying it would violate Eru's will.)"

lotr,35yujv,jstock23,12,Tue May 19 21:24:27 2015 UTC,"To elaborate on FlieGerFaUstMe262 and add my own thoughts, I think its important to realize that Melkor is ultimately a ""tributary"" to Eru's ""glory.""  I'll come back to this.  I think the symbolism is something like this:  Melkor coveted the secret fire.  He wanted to have Eru's power of creation.  He sought it often in the Void, removed from Eru, but could not find it (because it is with Eru).  I think this means ""evil"" is ultimately the ""absence of Eru,"" or ""good,"" or whatever word you want to use.  Melkor was powerful enough to imprint it on the whole world and it had a lasting effect after he was banished.  I think its that type of spiritual ""void"" that manifested itself, and Melkor's unwillingness to seek the fulfillment of his void with that Eru makes him evil.  Why Illuvatar would create a being with this disposition is the key theological question here.   But it is only because of that evil that we appreciate the good.  I think that is the biggest ""tributary"" to Eru.  After all, the story is where evil is.  Not much happened in the Blessed Realm after Melkor left."

And he thinks that he has a good chance at it especially because: 1) He is stronger than others 2) Eru is not actively inside the creation   And if you don't follow this God's orders (instead of co-creation of beautiful things is is the case with other Ainur; but silent obedience here), you are in his firing line."

lotr,35yujv,ametalshard,0,Thu May 14 20:48:56 2015 UTC,"Have you read the Silimarillion?  If not, I'd highly recommend that as it provides an excellent account of Tolkien's story.  Basically, Eru (Iluvatar/ God) has a bunch of created spirits create music together.  Melkor, who is an exceptionally powerful created spirit decides he wants to have control over the music and to lead instead of Eru, so he starts making a different melody.  Eru/ God blends that melody into his own pattern and makes it even more beautiful than before, which enrages Melkor to the point that he just starts making noise - and many of the spirits around him become confused and choose to follow him.  Then Eru/ God surprises all the spirits by showing them that their music (and noise) has created the physical world where the void used to be, and says that even the noise shall be redeemed.   Still seeking power, Melkor ruins much good and continues to seek forced control with varying success, until he is renamed Morgoth (Dark Foe) and is eventually himself forced into the void forever, even as the seeds he planted continue to bear fruit of discord in elves and men.  This story is similar to the story found in the Jewish Tanak/ Christian Old Testament.  God is good, all powerful, and creator, and Lucifer's pride leads him to refuse his place as a created being and say ""I will be like God"" - which eventually leads to him trying to mar the other creations God loves and be renamed Satan.  Another parallel is the ability of both to appear as fair and wise, and their strong ability to deceive.  Many religious people believe this passage from Ezekiel 28 to be a dual prophecy about the King of Tyre and of Satan, and it reminds me much of Morgoth.  “You were the signet of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering,... On the day that you were created they were prepared. You were an anointed guardian cherub. I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God; in the midst of the stones of fire you walked. You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created, till unrighteousness was found in you. In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence in your midst, and you sinned; so I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God, and I destroyed you, O guardian cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Your heart was proud because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I cast you to the ground; I exposed you before kings, to feast their eyes on you. By the multitude of your iniquities, in the unrighteousness of your trade you profaned your sanctuaries; so I brought fire out from your midst; it consumed you, and I turned you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all who saw you. All who know you among the peoples are appalled at you; you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more forever.”"
lotr,35yujv,Enchiladas4Real,0,Thu May 14 23:45:12 2015 UTC,"I'm going to guess because he was lonely and all the lady Ainur rejected him (like Varda did). All the other Ainur got to go off and have their cosmic sexcapades, but poor ol' Melki is stuck alone in the Void because that confounded Eru hid the damn Secret Fire. Melkor merely had some valid complaints, and now he gets ostracized by the community for going against Eru or whatever. No wonder he turned a bit bitter. Just a bit."

Merry and Pip lived to be 103 and 95 respectively, which indicates that they did get a life span boost because hobbits can live past 100but those two were avid smokers and drinkers so I'm guessing that would shave a few years off their lives. That's purely conjecture though.  Also your point stands, but as the lad said the Witch King and Shelob's sting was the reason Frodo fell I'll on those days, it was always the anniversary of the event he fell ill."

The end of this process is their 'fading,’ as Men have called it; for the body becomes at last, as it were, a mere memory held by the fëa, and that end has already been achieved in many regions of Middle Earth.""

'What can I see there?' he asked, pointing down to the middle of the great curve of the Anduin. 'Is that another city, or what is it?'  'It was a city,' said Beregond, 'the chief city of Gondor, of which this was only a fortress. For that is the ruin of Osgiliath on either side of Anduin, which our enemies took and burned long ago. Yet we won it back in the days of the youth of Denethor: not to dwell in, but to hold as an outpost, and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms. And then came the Fell Riders out of Minas Morgul.'"

According to the Tale of Years   2942 Sauron returns to Mordor in secret  2951 Sauron declares himself openly and gathers power in Mordor. He begins rebuilding Barad-Dur and  sends three nazgul to Dol Goldur  2954 Mount Doom bursts into flame again.  The last inhabitants of Ithilien leave over the Anduin.  2976 Denethor weds Finduilas (he married late).  Any insight where in the timeline this might fit?  I've excluded some dates, because I was just concerned geographically.  Do you think it was just before Sauron returned?  That's my inclination."

He's described as a vastly superior hunter, tracker, woodsman, fighter, leader, and even a strategist. It's mentioned that he helped lead the armies of Rohan and Gondor at various times during his travels under an alias, and was even made a general.  The only part of the trilogy I remember describing their abilities at the same time didn't contrast the two. During the battle on the Pellenor Fields, they are described as being so skillful that no blade could touch them, and all fell before them. I'm paraphrasing, of course. And Prince Imrahil was grouped with them in this description. I really wish he had been included in the movies; I liked his character in the book."

Even so, Aragorn, at 88 years old, would have had plenty of time to overcome Eomer (28) in skill with horses (even if he didn't eat, sleep, and breath them as Eomer probably did).

I never really took that from the films, but that's probably because I already had that understanding in place from the books when I first saw them. Right off the bat that nixes points 1 and 3.  As for number 2, they did stab Frodo quickly and quietly, with a blade that, in any other circumstance, would have killed him/brought him into the wraith world. They pulled back because they had achieved their goal. They weren't all present, and were facing someone who their greatest weapon (fear) was somewhat less powerful against (Aragorn). No need to go up against a fire-wielding heir of Elendil. It simply was not worth the possibility of one or more of them getting ""unclothed"" as they later do when crossing the Bruinen.   Since you mentioned the films in particular though, I think you're forgetting that Aragorn turns into this Nazgul fighting badass and whoops them all before they can do any further harm to Frodo. If Aragorn never showed up in the films, I think ""Sauron wins, roll credits"" is exactly how things would pan out.  Also:   The soul purpose of the nazgul is to find the one ring. That is it.   Not sure where you got this idea. In the first film, they were looking for the Ring, but they were Sauron's servants. They would do whatever he may want them to. They did a great many other things throughout the Third Age, and the War of the Ring in particular. For instance, leading Sauron's armies to war."

I don't mean to say it's not a discussion worth having, I just don't think that you can draw the line from there to them being inept idiots (within their world at least). Characters and events often follow logic internal to a story, that when viewed objectively form a real-world viewpoint simply don't hold up whatsoever. Nearly every single Bond villain falls into this category, as well as a whole host of other ""bad-guys"" of cinema.  We watch a scene like that and think ""why are they walking at the speed of a snail?!?"" Of course they could have rushed the Hobbits and taken Frodo before Aragorn jumped out, but it's much more dramatic to walk slowly I suppose. Their chief weapon was fear after all, perhaps that slow advance with swords drawn was just natural for them as a means of evoking fear in their victims. This doesn't really hold up to when you and I think what we might have done in such circumstances, but for them I think it might."

lotr,3619hf,iamnotreallyreal,1 point,Fri May 15 10:46:18 2015 UTC,"Actually in the book it was described (by Sam, I believe) as ""smelling"" because of the way the Ringwraiths moved about . As described in the book and explained by Gandalf, the reason why they can ""see"" Frodo when he puts the ring on is because it actually transports (for lack of a better term) him to the wraith-world. In that world Frodo could see the Ringwraiths' true forms (the Nine Old Kings) and consequently they could see him clear as day which made hunting him easier. On the flip side, the reason the wraiths can't see the ring-bearer when he doesn't wear it is because the wraiths don't actually have a physical form(it's their robes or armor that give them ""shape"") I forgot which chapter in the book, but it's explained that because their horses were bred specifically for the wraiths, they basically acts as seeing eye dogs."
lotr,3619hf,DividingPrescott,2,Sat May 16 00:32:16 2015 UTC,"In the books, the wraith is scared off by the singing of a company of elves that are headed his way. I assume ""Mountain"" is weather top? They stabbed him, which would turn a mortal into a wraith, and the hobbits had blades of westerness that could kill them. After Frodo took the hit from the morgul blade, they felt it would be safest to just let it do its work and keep their skins alive. They can't actually sense the ring.   Sounds like your problem is specifically with the films. To that, i'd say they are full of pieces of shit."
lotr,3619hf,iamnotreallyreal,1 point,Fri May 15 14:19:55 2015 UTC,"Because your concerns are mainly about the movie, I'll try not to make too many references to the books.   They can't see Frodo and the ring because he didn't put it on. They can only see him if Frodo enters the wraith world. The Ring wraiths are capable of sensing the ring but they don't exactly have eyes to see them with. they did stab Frodo quickly but Aragorn managed to save the day before any of them managed to land a fatal blow. The Morgul-Blade was supposed to poison and eventually kill Frodo but because he's a Hobbit, he has a much higher tolerance for evil. (The word 'evil' is very ambiguous.) Again, they don't have eyes and Frodo didn't put the ring on."

We know Ents have fëar (souls), just the same as Elves, Men, Dwarves, and a handful of others. But there are also many living things in Middle-Earth that do not have fëar, though these are almost exclusively non-sentient beings which is a category Tom doesn't seem to fit into. Tom as an incarnate of Arda itself, however would possibly put him into this sort of a category. Being Arda, Tom isn't a fëa like the other sentient beings.

lotr,35uw8m,FusionCrayfish,3,Sat May 16 15:55:57 2015 UTC,"Tom is older, Tom wins in a fist fight because he is bad ass, Tom makes the better sammich because he is Tom Bombadil, and I prefer Treebeard and the ents to basically everything in Tolkien lore other than the hobbits of the Shire."
lotr,35uw8m,I_AM_IGNIGNOTK,1 point,Thu May 14 00:37:02 2015 UTC,"I think Bombadil is older. He's like some super being, though I'm pretty sure that is never explicitly said.  I personally rank him more or less amongst the Maiar, give or take a tier.  I don't think he is one, but he's up there somewhere.    The Ent race is old, and Treebeard I think was the oldest of them.  The Ents outdate most other races, if not all of them.  I know the Elves are super ancient as well, and they are closely related to the higher beings too.    But Tom Bombadil is one of my favorite characters of all time. He definitely knows how to make a sandwich."
lotr,35uw8m,i_a1m_to_misbehave,0,Wed May 13 19:09:37 2015 UTC,"This was posted in another, by someone with far more knowledge than I, but Elrond states that Treebeard is the oldest living thing in Middle Earth. However, Tom states that nothing is older than him, and as you said he's known as the oldest and the fatherless. I'm inclined to go with Tom being older, because he's so mysterious, which means that he's not alive in the conventional sense.  There's been plenty of discussion and speculation; the two most common theories that I've seen are that Tom is either Eru Ilúvatar or Orome, one of the Valar, whom the Elves referred to as Tauron, the Lord of Forests.   Tom would win in a fist fight, I reckon. As he's got conventionally sized fingers, he'd make a better sandwich. And while Tom is awesome and mysterious... I've got to go with Treebeard. Because he's so relaxed, goes with the flow... and yet is terrible when roused to anger."

lotr,35pver,Yazzz,14,Tue May 12 16:50:52 2015 UTC,"Even if that is the reasoning, it is still a trilogy. Whether you want to call it that or not. It's three books. It's a trilogy.   Edit: Yes, I understand that Tolkien did not consider them books. But volumes. But taking into consideration modern thought of the books. It is considered a trilogy. Like from his letters:  Letter 165 P.S. The book is not of course a 'trilogy'. That and the titles of the volumes was a fudge thought necessary for publication, owing to length and cost. There is no real division into 3, nor is any one pan intelligible alone. The story was conceived and written as a whole and the only natural divisions are the 'books' I-VI (which originally had titles).  But this is still what a trilogy is considered. It's one story told over multiple books. I understand that he would have preferred to have them be one large book. But due to the times, paper shortages, length, etc could not feasibly do that."

Each person has a different approach to how it affects them, because a story as complex and intricate as LOTR obviously has many different, deeper meanings than just the struggle of good vs evil.  In the end though, whether it's good entertainment for you, or whether it actually impacts your life in a positive way like it did with yours, I must say that we are very lucky indeed to have access to such stories nowadays through the Internet, books, movies, and whatnot.  Kudos to you for interpreting the characters in a way that has meaning in your life, and retaining life lessons from their struggles. That is very impressive, something even I couldn't do.

He's more on the negative side obviously, but that's because of the influences around him. That's how it went for me. I got in a bad way, hooked on a horrible drug, and my personality totally switched for the worse. I wasn't an asshole, but I wasn't as outgoing, or happy, or funny; all things I'm usually very much so. It doesn't mean you're a bad person, just that things aren't letting you be your best.  And thanks for the sentiment at the end...this is probably my 3rd or 4th time trying this, after a long fuckin' road, and you have the right of it.

I remember reading that when they first started their journey, that they would walk until their feet throbbed and keep walking. They were even having problems getting to rivendale while they were being followed because their legs and feet hurt so much from constant movement. So that's what I do, pretend that I am Frodo, taking the ring to Mordor. I have already gotten stronger and i don't hurt as bad as when I started.   You can find lots of inspiration from these books, life is full of hardships, and hardship is the name of the game through this whole series, and in the end they made it, they did it, and they lived, regardless of how many scars were left on their bodies and souls."

lotr,35s6cc,Fifth5Horseman,7,Wed May 13 05:50:30 2015 UTC,"Technically true, though a few days of training wouldn't amount to much. All of them are, considering their origins, quite a great heroes, though the only with great feats on the battlefield would be Merry (stabbing the Witch King from behind) and Pippin (killing a troll and living - if barely - to tell the tale).  Of course, while this doesn't really concern the Lord of the Rings, we cannot entirely discount that Merry and Pippin would have already have known how to fight. They aren't children and for what it amounts for amongst Hobbits, both are noblemen. (This is most evident later when Merry becomes Master of Buckland and Pippin becomes Took and Thain.) Frodo is ""merely"" a gentleman and Sam is his servant (the only non-noble in the Fellowship)."
lotr,35s6cc,avataRJ,3,Wed May 13 07:06:46 2015 UTC,"I'd say they're less 'noblemen' and more a part of the 'gentry' class. Shire politics seem to be fairly relaxed. Also, I thought their positions of eminence were a result of their heroic deeds, not necessarily their birth.  As to your point about being trained to fight... I'm not sure. Hobbits didn't have tournaments as far as I know, and they don't even seem to play many sports. I agree that they were capable adults and could handle themselves alright... but I don't think they knew much about a sword past which end to hold."

Key points on Hobbits, martial skills and sport: Swords seem to be considered mathom heirlooms and museum pieces. They certainly had hunters, and therefore people experienced in archery. Hobbit throwing skills are canonical. And finally, they'd probably use the word sport in the older meaning."
lotr,35s6cc,avataRJ,1 point,Wed May 13 12:11:03 2015 UTC,"Though slow to quarrel, and for sport killing nothing that lived, they were doughty at bay, and at need could still handle arms."
lotr,35s6cc,dr_amy_bishop,5,Wed May 13 20:00:30 2015 UTC,"Also, I thought their positions of eminence were a result of their heroic deeds, not necessarily their birth.   Actually they were because of their birth. The Thain was meant as a replacement to the King after Arthedain fell. It was a male hereditary position in the Took family. Pippin's father was initially not in line to receive the title but when the previous Thain died without an heir, it passed to Pippin's father (closest living male relative) and then on to Pippin.  The title ""Master of Buckland"" was established by a current Thain who removed to Buckland. This is also when the Thainship passed from the Brandybuck family (at the time the Oldbucks) to the Tooks. I think it's safe to assume (since Buckland was founded by a Thain) that Master of Buckland was a male hereditary title as well. It certainly was in practice in any case. Merry is a direct male line descendant of the founder of Buckland and its first Master.  Sam's the really the main Hobbit who's eminence was due to his heroism rather than his birth; his father was a gardener. Even Frodo would have been a person of some importance, regardless of his deeds during the War of the Ring, simply by being a Baggins and Bilbo's heir.  All that being said, their heroic deeds certainly contributed quite a bit to their reputation."

Also following the events of the Hobbit the situation in the northern Rhovanion became far better from the point of view of the Free Peoples. Kingdom under the Mountain was restored and Longbeard dwarves became stronger. Also the kingdom of Dale was re-established and it became relatively strong buffer against Easterlings. Without these two realm the forces of Sauron could have invaded more land, perhaps even Eriador. Like Gandalf said to the Hobbits following the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen, it would have been horrible prospect. Even if they had still won, imagine dragonfire in Eriador (assuming Sauron might somehow use Smaug to his advantage) and enemies in Rivendel, Breeland and Shire. It might have been possible that there would be no queen in Gondor.  And besides... simply because place A is within similar distance as place B, it does not follow that place B is not strategically important in order for you to capture place A. It depends on geography, both natural and political."

I don't fault them for taking a ""let's get there and see"" approach.  Gandalf never reveals his original intentions, if he had any, with Thorin's Company once they reached the mountain, but to his credit there were at least options. He might negotiate assistance from Elves or Men for example, or else develop some other strategy using Bilbo. Or he might have simply let the Dwarves figure it out. It's their treasure after all.  It's worth noting that Gandalf often trusts in fate to work things out after he's set all the pieces on the right path. Some these instances of ""good luck"" could actually be labeled eucatastrophes, which are a promintent theme in Tolkien's work."

The leaves the following routes:   Through Gondor - Not an option; Gondor has been successfully holding off Mordor's armies for centuries. Through Mirkwood - Not great; It was difficult for even Thorin's company to make it through. Also, Thranduil's rangers can pick off half the army at range while sustaining minimal casualties. Along the Anduin - Still not good; It takes the army too close to Lorien and, if Mirkwood isn't feeling too isolationist, Thranduil's forces. Through the Withered Heath(Northeast of Mirkwood) - Decent; It's a little out of the way but as long as the dwarves don't hold Erebor, the only resistance would be Laketown which is far too weak to withstand any real assault alone."

lotr,35kzmu,Seafroggys,8,Mon May 11 16:26:23 2015 UTC,This is fascinating. The movies make Rohan and Gondor seem scarcely populated considering as only a few small (even Edoras seems small) towns plus Minas Tirith are shown. It's more vast fields and mountains rather than towns. The books do a little better thankfully from what I remember.
lotr,35kzmu,timscheller95,5,Mon May 11 18:05:54 2015 UTC,"Well Middle Earth at the end of the third age was pretty thinly populated, much smaller populations than Europe was at any point in the past 1000-2000 years.  But yeah, the movies do make it seem more empty, mainly because they omit very important details.  For example, in the movies, the Pelannor Fields outside of Minas Tirith are empty all the way to Osgiliath, also empty.  In the books, the Pelannor Fields were full of farms and small villages.  Also Gondor had many inhabited cities, Pelargir, Linhir, Dol Amroth, Calembel, and others.  Rohan also had several cities that were named (Aldburg mainly).  And this doesn't count the unnamed towns and villages.  Middle Earth had way more people earlier in the 3rd Age, before the fall of Arnor."
lotr,35kzmu,Seafroggys,9,Mon May 11 18:13:34 2015 UTC,"Don't know about most of them, and I doubt there are specific numbers, but its mentioned that the population of Minas Tirith had been in decline for some time, and was only half the total capacity of the city as of ROTK"

lotr,35ml81,JollyGreen37,15,Mon May 11 19:10:58 2015 UTC,We do not know their colours or other details. Other than that if I remember correctly all the Great Rings had a jewel in them except for the One Ring.
lotr,35ml81,sakor88,-1,Mon May 11 19:18:09 2015 UTC,Well I guess they were golden because the Dwarves just threw them to the other stuff resulting in them being not corrupted
lotr,35ml81,-Hendrik-,5,Tue May 12 15:39:12 2015 UTC,"This isn't true. The Dwarves absolutely coveted the Rings and did not simply toss them into a big treasure pile. The reason they were not corrupted like Men was because they desired gold and jewels more than power and fame. Sauron could not corrupt them into ringwraiths this way, though they still were ultimately destructive to the Dwarves (Dwarves got lots of gold using rings, hordes of gold attract dragons)"
lotr,35ml81,Willie9,1 point,Tue May 12 21:37:29 2015 UTC,"Kind of. The Arkenstone is what made Thrain mad with greed. The rings are what drove the dwarves in Moria crazy, which caused them to dig too deep and wake up the balrog"
lotr,35ml81,WowzersInMyTrowzers,2,Wed May 13 03:18:04 2015 UTC,"Smaug wasn't the only dragon to attack a Dwarven treasure horde. 3(or 4) of the rings given to Dwarves were destroyed by dragon-fire, presumably the same fire that killed their bearers. These bearers became very wealthy because of the rings they bore, attracting dragons.  The horde of Erebor was also created in part by one of the rings, which escaped the sack of Erebor by Smaug and ended up in the hands of Thrain, who was captured by Sauron and it was taken from him.  The Dwarves of Moria weren't driven crazy by the ring, though their master may have been more greedy because of one (though I don't think we have any confirmation that the Moria-dwarves had a ring). Mostly they just wanted Mithril, digging for which awoke the Balrog."

(Although there are some oddities amongst their selections.) The Hobbit certainly doesn't fall into the realm of what they consider ""important"" films. The Lord of the Rings one might be able to make a case for, but if any Bakshi film is considered it's probably going to be Heavy Metal or Heavy Traffic.

I don't know how much you already know of the general story since it's been pretty hard to avoid LOTR for the past 15 years, but without revealing too much, watching the Fellowship movie will spoil you the beginning of the Two Towers book.

Nothing else will be ruined. They just moved those events up to the end of the first movie.  The Two Towers movie actually only covers about half the book. Watch Two Towers after you've read through Two Towers Book IV, Chapter 7, ""Journey to the Cross-Roads"". Or at least the first few pages of it.  Don't watch Return of the King until you've finished. Or if you get really antsy, you can watch the first half after you've read up through all of Book V.  The only real spoiler is the Aragorn and Arwen stuff which comes from the appendices."

lotr,35boch,Sprutnums,8,Fri May 8 19:43:12 2015 UTC,"As far as I could find, Sam never says ""Oh god."" I'm guessing you're referring to this passage (bold emphasis added):   ‘Well, sir,’ said Sam dithering a little. ‘I heard a deal that I didn’t rightly understand, about an enemy, and rings, and Mr. Bilbo, sir, and dragons, and a fiery mountain, and – and Elves, sir. I listened because I couldn’t help myself, if you know what I mean. Lor bless me, sir, but I do love tales of that sort. And I believe them too, whatever Ted may say. Elves, sir! I would dearly love to see them. Couldn’t you take me to see Elves, sir, when you go?’   Specifically, he says ""Lor bless me."" In fact he uses the phrase twice, the first time occurs a few sentences prior to this passage when Gandalf first catches him eavesdropping. As for the actual question, I'm not sure there's a definitive answer. Certainly there is a supreme deity (Eru Iluvatar) in Tolkien's mythology, and several other deities beneath him (Valar), but to what degree Hobbits are religious is left unclear by Tolkien. He makes no mention of their religiousity (or lack thereof) in the Prologue, which is where we learn most of our cultural information regarding Hobbits.  Another option is this is an artifact of Tolkien's translation. The whole premise of most (if not all) of Tolkien's work is that they are translations of first-hand accounts. The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are supposed to be translations of various portions of the Red Book of Westmarch, itself a compilation of works by Frodo, Bilbo, and a few others. This ""Lor bless me"" could be an English translation of a roughly equivalent Westron idiom. (Westron is the language the Red Book was written in.)"
lotr,35boch,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Fri May 8 20:33:11 2015 UTC,"Your last paragraph pretty much nails it, in my opinion. The hobbits are supposed to sound like English country folk, so Tolkien has them using English country folk phrases.  I would argue that we only think of the Valar and Maiar as gods because we're used to fantasy books having pantheons. They're more like angels. This also makes Melkor make more sense - the greatest of the angels who rebelled against God? Sounds familiar. :P"
lotr,35boch,SeeShark,1 point,Sat May 9 14:02:18 2015 UTC,"I think by ""Lor"" he meant Manwe, the unanimously elected lord of Middle Earth. Less of a religious lord and more of a ""I live on the planet that this guy rules"" kind of way"

lotr,35boch,SeeShark,0,Sat May 9 16:20:09 2015 UTC,I know that he was Catholic.  My point is the mythology he created (that clearly isn't the Christian mythology) is still separate.  Its also very much Nordic in some ways and Greek in others.  Its a really nice synthesis of mankind's different takes on gods.  I like that its both polytheistic but ultimately truly monotheistic.
lotr,35boch,AmbiguousAnonymous,1 point,Sun May 10 00:38:22 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but there's a lot of very compelling evidence:    ""Catholic,"" "" religious element,"" ""symbolism"" Supreme creator being His servants, the greatest of which rebelled against him and became ""the great adversary"" The supreme creator explicitly says that even that act of rebellion was part of his plan Humans must not fear death because their creator has a plan for them   You have to be in denial to think that this world isn't supposed to represent elements of Christian mythology.  I understand that it can be uncomfortable to think of one of your favorite books as a Christian work if you're not Christian yourself (I'm Jewish), but you can't pretend that the author didn't intend it as such."
lotr,35boch,SeeShark,1 point,Sun May 10 01:23:22 2015 UTC,"Tolkien also hated allegory, so it's just as silly to try and fit it all into a narrow view.  I have already said he is clearly Christian, and maybe I haven't said this but I agree that there is a ton of Christianity in it.  But there is also a ton of other stuff too.  Its ambiguous enough that I could connect it to many other things just as well.  Anyone who is Christian is going to see the world through Christian eyes.  I guess what I am trying to say is that I like Eru and the Valar more than I like God/Jesus and the angels.  And he intentionally left it ambiguous, despite being able to include tons of Christianity."

I think it's popular in Scandinavian languages. If you round your lips a bit and try to say ""ee"" it will sound different than if you open your mouth into more of a smile and say ""ee"". If you play around with [this chart](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_vowel_chart_with_audio) then you can learn some more about vowels.  /i/ is super common. That's like cheese, please, etc. the ""long vowel"" of 'e'  Even though English differentiates some of the most amounts of vowels, we still miss a lot of them."

These sounds expose some teeth, but it's not what I would call anything near a smile.  The /y/ sound occurs when I close my lips a bit more, similar to where I would make ""oo"" as in ""book"" and part the way towards the ""ooh"" sound as in ""boom"".

lotr,351uut,Smailien,10,Thu May 7 14:20:24 2015 UTC,"Tolkien wrote, ""The Black Speech was only used in Mordor; it only occurs in the Ring inscription, and a sentence uttered by the Orcs of Barad-dûr (Vol. II p. 48)1  and in the word Nazgûl (cf. nazg in the Ring inscription). It was never used willingly by any other people, and consequently even the names of places in Mordor are in English (for the C.S.) or Elvish"" in letter 144. I guess that means, no, no examples of the Black Speech are given with the letter e. But it doesn't seem that Tolkien deliberately omitted that letter, or said that the language didn't contain it."
lotr,351uut,apologeticCultist,1 point,Wed May 6 15:10:10 2015 UTC,"It could have been deliberately omitted, simply because there are plenty of languages that can be written in the Roman alphabet but do not contain certain letters.  For example, the L sound is not a part of the Japanese language."
lotr,351uut,workingboy,4,Wed May 6 17:29:08 2015 UTC,"Sure, but there are phonological patterns that are more likely. The Black Speech has the vowels [a], [i], [o], [u] and something written as û that is probably either [u:] or [y].  A three-vowel system with [a], [i], and [u] makes perfect sense - those are the three vowels most easily distinguishable from each other, forming a large triangle in the vowel space. Then [o], a mid vowel, is added. [e] and [ɛ] (the letter ""e"" could refer to either of those vowel sounds) are also mid vowels. Once your system is no longer a simple three vowels and you have a back mid vowel, why not have a front mid vowel too? It wouldn't be unheard of for a vowel system to be like this, but it'd be at least slightly unusual, especially since I believe it's more common to have diverse front vowels than diverse back vowels.  I suspect it's more likely just a less common sound. We only have the inscription on the One Ring (which doesn't even contain [o] - it uses only [a], [u], [i], and whatever û stands for), one sentence from an Orc, and a few scattered words."

lotr,356pz0,BarelyOriginal,15,Thu May 7 15:48:08 2015 UTC,"It's not quite accurate. You're right to be a little suspect of tumblr as a source. Here's the relevant portion from The Lord of the Rings:   Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to laughter, and to eating and drinking. And laugh they did, and eat, and drink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests at all times, and of six meals a day (when they could get them). - Prologue: 1. Concerning Hobbits   Probably the ""eat every two hours"" notion comes from this. Assuming 12 waking hours each day, 6 meals evenly spaced is every two hours. However the important note is the line ""when they could get them."" They may enjoy eating often, but they don't have an imperative biological need to. They can survive eating much less. Prior to settling down in the Shire, Hobbits led a rather more difficult existence. Later on in the Prologue, Tolkien writes:   Nonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough. They were, if it came to it, difficult to daunt or to kill; and they were, perhaps, so unwearyingly fond of good things not least because they could, when put to it, do without them, and could survive rough handling by grief, foe, or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well and looked no further than their bellies and their well-fed faces.   So to answer your question regarding how the Fellowship and the Elves handled Hobbit appetite, they didn't really. The Hobbits simply went without the comforts of The Shire for the duration of their adventure (barring a few brief respites)."

I really hate to admit it but I think he did Algren better than Viggo could have. The real question on my mind now that we're discussing it, is who might have made a better Aragorn!

Not a chance.   Assuming he stays in Middle Earth during the Second Age, would Sauron have gone after Feanor or Celebrimbor to make the Rings of Power   We don't have enough information. Who knows if Feanor would even get interested in rings? We simply don't know.   Could Feanor even duel Sauron one on one or would it still require Gil-Galad and Elendil?   Well, Feanor, for all his impact, didn't really win any fights, sooo, we don't know. He had a fierce spirit, but that's not enough.   How much of a setback could Feanor put Sauron into for almost taking over all of Middle Earth?   I have no idea what you are asking.  Still, I don't think it would be a good idea in any way to have him remain... Have you considered that he was reckless, self-centered and didn't care at all for the common good?

And I wouldn't be so hasty to assume the Valar would have given the Silmarils back to him anyway. I mean if we assume events played out largely the same during the First Age (again that's a big if in and of itself), then ultimately the Host of the West would need to come and would themselves recover the Silmarils. If Feanor stole them back just as his sons did, I suspect his fate would be the same: either to commit suicide or pass into some lonely forlorn  existence (or fall in some other unforseen way). If he doesn't recover the Silmarils and yet survives then I have no doubt his pride would be much too great to return to Valinor, even if the Valar still pardoned the Noldor."

He doesn't just have a claim to the title of High King, he was the High King. He would have taken Gil-Galad's place in ruling the elves fleeing Beleriand. I'm not so sure the Sindar would have joined him the way they joined with Gil-Galad though."
lotr,354u16,Timiniel,0,Thu May 7 18:03:09 2015 UTC,"The fact he held his own against 7 Balrogs is case enough that he was a pretty damn good fighter.   ... We have different definitions of ""holding his own"".  He was beaten and defeated. The silmarillion doesn't speak of him killing any single balrog. In fact, it doesn't mention 7 balrogs anywhere. What is your source?   I think he would have returned once he got the silmarils back, if he was pardoned like the others.   We have no evidence of this whatsoever. The others were pardoned because they showed regret and repented their ways. Feanor was utterly incapable of such a thing."
lotr,354u16,Seafroggys,2,Thu May 7 15:34:52 2015 UTC,"I don't own a copy of the Silmarillion so I'm going from memory here.  I have read that different scholars have said there's something in the order of 7 Balrogs (I was under the impression there were a lot more when I originally read the Sil but after reading the evidence it seems there were only a handful).  Also, from quotes I've read, Feanor wasn't defeated until Gothmog came; he was fighting off multiple other balrogs before that time.  I guess you can argue he was beaten against Gothmog, but he was fighting other balrogs beforehand."
lotr,354u16,Timiniel,-1,Thu May 7 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"Listen, is this really important? We have no evidence he was a good fighter. None. We have no evidence that he would repent. None. All you are doing is conjecture and wishful thinking. Don't. Focus on what we know."

Evidence that he's a good fighter?  Tolkien didn't explicitly state ""Feanor was a good fighter"" but its implicit in the facts.  Your average joe wouldn't last 2 seconds against a single Balrog, let alone several.  Was he the greatest fighter?  I don't think anybody thinks so, but he had to have had competence.  You are right, we have no evidence that he would repent.  If you read my words, I never explicitly said he would.  I said if he was able to, and after he got the silmarils, he would return to Aman.  Good job putting words in my mouth.  Wishful thinking and conjecture is also the vast majority of threads in this subreddit and Tolkienfans, so its strange that you hang around when something that apparently bothers you so much is so prevalent.  So now that your questions have been satisfied, have any other questions for me?"

'Here I set it,' he said; 'but I command you not to touch it, nor to permit any other to lay hand on it. In this elvish sheath dwells the Blade that was Broken and has been made again. Telchar first wrought it in the deeps of time. Death shall come to any man that draws Elendil's sword save Elendil's heir.'   I was just a kid when I first read the books (I was 11, it was 1963) but I was very into mythology. I didn't have access to all the lore we have access to now.

Surely it wouldn't take 170 years to bring a ladder and clear away some rock. Especially since they did clear away the rock in a day in TH3.  This scene shows the balcony that leads directly to areas that Smaug has breached. Even if these areas were closed off by gates or rock by the time the dwarves came to reclaim Erebor, there would be dragon-sized holes everywhere or movable rocks. https://youtu.be/PgW7PRN-ADI?t=49s"

You're wrong in saying that it has to be the One Ring - many more lesser rings were forged beside the greater 19 and the One. Gandalf assumes that Bilbo has found one of the lesser rings, and I'm quite sure he explains this in The Fellowship of the Ring. At this point Gandalf doesn't know about Gollum, and Saruman holds to the view that the One Ring has been lost in the Anduin and washed out to the sea.   I agree with some of your other points, but if you've read the books it's pretty clear that Gandalf would hardly suspect Bilbo's ring to be Sauron's."

Those elves that refused the summons during the Years of the Trees (Avari) were excluded from sailing into the West after the Second Age.  In short, he could be talking about about either the Noldor specifically, or all Eldar. Both would be correct. As far as I know though, the specific line ""My people..."" is only in the films."
lotr,3514t6,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Wed May 6 14:16:42 2015 UTC,"Um, I'm pretty sure that  the Avari and their descendants are not prohibited from returning. That would also exclude the Sindar as well as well any Middle Earth- born Noldor. In any case, there are numerous references to Moriquindi returning, including Legolas and - of course - Cirdan himself. In fact, I'm not sure where, but there is an explicit passage that states that Galadriel alone was forbidden to return."
lotr,3514t6,newtonpage,3,Wed May 6 23:00:15 2015 UTC,"Regarding Valinor:   After the Downfall of Numenor, and its destruction, all this was removed from the 'physical' world, and not reachable by material means. Only the Eldar (or High-Elves) could still sail thither, forsaking time and mortality, but never returning. - Letter 151   Tolkien clearly says only Eldar were permitted after the Second Age. Also, you're mistaking meanings of Moriquendi and Avari. The Avari were all those who refused the summons of the Valar and remained in Cuivienen. They slowly trickled westward long after the Eldar did. The Moriquendi include a large number of Eldar who never completed the Great Journey to Valinor. Legolas, Cirdan and Thranduil were all Moriquendi, but they were also Eldar (Sindarin).  Check out this chart for a pretty decent breakdown of the various groups of elves. After the Second Age, only elves branching from the Eldar were able to sail West.  P.S. As for Galadriel, her return to the West was only in question because of her association with the Flight of the Noldor. She was forbidden to return like the other Noldor, and when given the chance of forgiveness at the end of the First Age, she refused and remained in Middle-Earth. My understanding is that this was why there was any question at all regarding her ability to return. Of course we know ultimately, the Valar did accept her.  Edit: Just to be clear, all Sindar and ""Middle-Earth born"" Noldor were also Eldar. Moriquendi simply means elves who never saw the light of the two trees in Valinor. Avari means ""the Unwilling"" or those who refused to come to Valinor."

lotr,3514t6,AmbiguousAnonymous,2,Thu May 7 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"They certainly could if they wanted to, but not all did. In fact not all Eldar (Eldalië) did either. Many remained houseless fëar:   But it would seem that in these after-days more and more of the Elves, be they of the Eldalië in origin or be they of other kinds, who linger in Middle-earth now refuse the summons of Mandos, and wander houseless in the world, unwilling to leave it and unable to inhabit it, haunting trees or springs or hidden places that once they knew. Not all of these are kindly or unstained by the Shadow. Indeed the refusal of the summons is in itself a sign of taint. - Morgoth's Ring, ""Laws and Customs Among the Eldar"""

The Avari are Moriquendi because the word Moriquendi means Dark-Elves, as in Elves that have not seen the Light of the Two Trees. The thing that separates the Avari from the rest of the Moriquendi (Sindar,Nandor-Silvan elves) is that they refused the summons of Orome and never started the Great Journey hence their name the Unwilling. The Sindar started their journey and settled in Beleriand because some of them were looking for their lost lord Elwe Singollo and others made it to the shores of Beleriand but too late and settled on the coasts and at the mouths of Sirion. These elves were named Eglath or the Forsaken because they were too slow on their journey and arrived too late, after Ulmo had transported the rest of the Elves to Valinor. On the journey, some of the largest host of the three groups of the elves (the Teleri, the Sindar and Nandor elves belong to this group) grew afraid of the Hithaeglir (the Misty Mountains) and settled in the vales of Anduin, inhabiting those forests that would later be known as Lothlorien and Eryn Galen(Greenwood the Great, later known as Mirkwood). Some were led by Lenwë and settled south along Anduin and were named Nandor and only much later, a group of them arrived into Beleriand and settled in Ossiriand and were named the Green-Elves.

Sindar, Nandor, and Silvan elves are all Eldar and Moriquendi (except for Elu Thingol, who is alone both Sindarin and Calaquende). The Avari were also Moriquendi.  The point of my reply was that he/she was interpreting ""Avari"" as completely synonymous with ""Moriquendi"" which it is not.

lotr,34w2ia,Balfezor,3,Thu May 7 18:39:58 2015 UTC,"I hate to be the one to break it to you, but as /u/slumdogskillionaire suggested, the nauglamir resides in the night sky on earendils brow during the time of the hobbit. Another thing to note is if the dwarves of erebor had a silmaril they would have had much bigger problems than a dragon. These are the things that drove the highest family of all the elves to forsake the lands of the undying for a chance to murder a valar to get back. Sauron himself would have come grabbed it before the numenoreans came along."
lotr,34w2ia,standardusernamehere,2,Tue May 5 05:48:24 2015 UTC,"I think its most likely at the bottom of the ocean, but I suppose its possible the necklace portion of Nauglamír could have been recovered, but to be sure you should check the exact wording in the books. At any rate, its probably at least a reference to the Nauglamír."
lotr,34w2ia,SlumdogSkillionaire,5,Tue May 5 01:32:23 2015 UTC,"Wasn't the Nauglamir the one that Earendil took with him? So it would be in the sky, while the other two that weren't recovered until the end are in the ocean and the earth.  Side note: was there any stated connection between the Silmarils ending up in the sky, water, and fire and the three Elven rings being the rings of Air, Water, and Fire?"
lotr,34w2ia,gil_gondreth,2,Tue May 5 03:52:48 2015 UTC,Your side note is a wonderful detail and worthy of much pondering.
lotr,34w2ia,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Tue May 5 04:30:41 2015 UTC,"Without going into detail since you clearly haven't finished reading The Silmarillion yet, it is certainly not the Nauglamir. If you want to know: Elwing had the Nauglamir when she cast herself into the sea. She was saved by Ulmo but thereafter only the Silmaril itself is mentioned. Either the necklace was saved as well, in which case it is with Elwing in Aman or with Earendil in the sky, OR it sunk to the bottom of the sea and they retained only the Silmaril.  As for Thranduil, in the book he was simply after the treasure in general. He never specifically mentions a necklace or any other object. In my opinion this makes a bit more sense than going to war over a single necklace. The wealth of the Dwarves was known far and wide, and all the participants in the Battle of the Five Armies (barring the Eagles and Beorn probably) were initially just there for the treasure.  Hope that helps."
lotr,34w2ia,SlumdogSkillionaire,2,Tue May 5 13:44:21 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make sense that he'd go to war over the necklace I'll agree. I figured it would be the Nauglamir because after he mentions his claim, the movie cuts to Thorin having found a necklace.  As far as the Silmarillion goes, I believe Elwing was just mentioned so will find out soon enough I guess."
lotr,34w2ia,fileg,1 point,Tue May 5 14:22:42 2015 UTC,"You're definitely on the right track! Canonically speaking, all we know is that Thranduil wanted some of the treasure. PJ basically copied the Nauglamir story and put it in the Hobbit to make it more of a personal feud between the Elves and Dwarves and to add a little more detail to that part of the story."
lotr,34w2ia,fileg,1 point,Tue May 5 03:50:41 2015 UTC,"I won't argue for or against, but if there was a silmaril in Erebor's treasure, why would they have made such a fuss about the Arkenstone"
lotr,34w2ia,96Buck,1 point,Tue May 5 04:40:08 2015 UTC,I figured that maybe the Arkenstones WAS a Silmaril but then I thought that didn't seem quite right...
lotr,34w2ia,Devouringvoid,3,Tue May 5 10:04:00 2015 UTC,"The Silmarils are all accounted for.  Tolkien liked repeating motifs - the arkenstone is a motif that echos the silmarils, but it isn't one."
lotr,34w2ia,ToffeeKing,1 point,Wed May 6 10:42:00 2015 UTC,"I interpreted it as, similar to Bilbo's mithril shirt, a craft commission...had Smaug not taken the Mountain, the necklace would probably have been delivered/sold to Thranduil.  The Dwarves under the Mountain, especially if their Ring was any help, would have been superior craftsmen to the Elves of Mirkwood."

If your question is geared more toward whether or not JRRT could've written it that way, I suppose he could've written it any way he wanted it, but any changes could've had a big impact on the story.  While it's true that the dwarf lords were primarily just driven to be more greedy and eventually to ""delve too deeply,"" this could've had a big impact on the plot. If Gimli somehow came into possession of the ring, his ""logic"" may likely have been similar to Boromir's: while Boromir argued the Ring could be protected/used in Gondor, Gimli may have begun to argue that the Ring should be kept and protected in one of the Dwarven strongholds, where he would likely continue mining and doing Dwarf things..."
lotr,34ue2d,some_dunkaroos,3,Mon May 4 18:16:14 2015 UTC,"Dwarves are not affected by the Rings that were given to them in the same way that, for instance, the 9 Rings affect men. The seven Dwarf Rings were unable to bend the Dwarves to Sauron's will. The only affects that they had were, as you said, to create greater greed and the ability to grow their wealth.  This doesn't necessarily speak to the power of the One Ring though. I don't see any reason why it would not have corrupted Gimli eventually. It might have, in which case it might have been a better choice for Gimli not to follow Frodo.  Not to mention if Gimli had left, Eomer would likely have died at Helm's Deep."

'I will do now what I must,' he said. 'This at least is plain: the evil of the Ring is already at work even in the Company, and the Ring must leave them before it does more harm. I will go alone.    Whether he was correct or not, at that moment in time Frodo has decided the burden he carries is enough, and he does not want to be responsible for what might happen to anyone else.   Sam has to force him to allow him to come. No one else is there to do that, nor can he afford to wait for any more debate. He recognizes that he is the chosen one."

The first leadership decision Frodo made was when the debate for going through moria was decided. Aragorn is definitely a leader but he does not take charge until Gandalf is lost. The group dynamic and leadership is very interesting to look into, don't be afraid to look more into Boromir as well as he takes a more controlling stance on things in the book. Hope this helps and if someone disagrees, feel free to explain."

For the first leg of the Fellowships journey it's obvious Gandalf is in command. Later Frodo and Aragorn take leadership of their respective parties. Aragorn's most crucial decision occurs when he decides to pursue Merry and Pippin rather than Frodo. There was a nice discussion of the difficulties of that choice here.  An interesting topic would be to compare Gandalf the White and Aragorn's position as leader after they relink up. One would imagine that resurrected Gandalf would carry even more authority however this also occurs at a time when Aragorn is finally embracing his identity as the true King. Which character's words carry more authority? Whose counsel was deciding factor to march on the Black Gate?"

The 3D guys and the 2D comp guys. The amount of effort put into even the third movie is a masterpiece even though it wasn't implemented well. If the compositing was better the CG would have looked amazing. But with so much CG comes even more composting work. PJ got in over his head with the CG and it could have looked amazing if the compositors had more time. People underestimate the amount of roto and just color correction that goes into each individual cut. And you say like the rest of the internet, ""use more practical effects!"" ... practical effects are a dying, expensive, and unpractical way of approaching effects now and a huge waste of materials.

Or did Melkor turn them into what you ultimately would find in LOTR?   Thanks!"

The whole ""I am going to take on Sauron alone"" thing was a bit much, but the scene where he goes into the tomb of the nine was really cool.  I also like how in the movies, Smaug was missing a scale because Bard's father shot it off. In the books he was just missing a scale because he hadn't been lying on that part of his chest, and the treasure horde hadn't fused with his scales or whatever. I thought the movie explanation was much better.  I also thought they did Smaug's voice very well."

Sauron is another similar being to them — a lower order angel, basically, but in his case, turned to evil long ago by the equivalent of Lucifer/Satan. Despite what the films might make you think, he does have a physical body."
lotr,34orjh,ebneter,10,Sun May 3 03:49:35 2015 UTC,"In the beginning, there was Eru Iluvatar, a creator-god. Eru created the Valar and the Maiar, beings that were sort of analogous in ways to the different types of angels in Abrahamic religions. The Valar are the highest order of these beings, with the Maiar still extremely powerful in spirit and strength (if assuming a physical form) in comparison to Elves and Men.  First, a Vala named Melkor (later recognized by the name of Morgoth [Legolas' line, ""A balrog... of Morgoth"" is in reference to him]) started shit in discord with the other Ainur (the collective term for Valar and Maiar). He eventually fled to the North of the world the LotR is set in, hiding there.   In his service were corrupted/evil-willed Maiar, most of whom became balrogs. Sauron was among the Maiarin servants of Morgoth, but actually became his most powerful servant.   Long story short, Morgoth was banished from the world entirely, and Sauron took power. After Sauron had the Rings of Power created by Celebrimbor while forging his One Ring in the fires of Mt Doom (and giving them out to Men and Dwarves, while the elvish rings were not touched by his evil), The Last Alliance of Elves and Men fought against him, with Isildur cutting the One Ring from his hand.   At a point after Sauron's apparent defeat, the Valar sent 5 Maiar to Middle Earth to ensure Sauron stayed defeated, as the One Ring--the source of his power--was never found after it was lost by Isildur. These Maiar were forced to assume bodies similar to those of Men. They were called the Istari, or in the common tongue, the Wizards: Gandalf, Saruman, and Radagast (and two others Tolkien never really went into detail on).   Saruman was prideful and wanted power. For many years he served his purpose, but once rumor of the One Ring's continued existence was suggested, he started coveting it for himself. This grew and grew until the fight between him and Gandalf in Fellowship.   As for the connection between Sauron and Saruman, the two towers--Barad-dur and Orthanc [Sauron's and Saruman's respectively]) each housed one of seven ancient seeing-stones, the palatiri. These had different functions in some cases, but all could be used to see from afar. The two stones were connected, and allowed communication between Sauron and Saruman. Saruman had planned to get the One Ring first and supplant Sauron.  I can't go any further in depth due to spoilers."

Short answer: the wizards of middle earth are angels in mortal form, Sauron is a corrupted one whose physical form was destroyed, but whose spirit remains, tied to the Ring. Saruman is an angel who is becoming more and more corrupted and who has chosen to ally himself with Sauron.  Long answer: too long to type out on mobile, may come back later."

(Besides that the name Aragorn is Sindarin and means ""Revered King"")  1) He came during a time of war and played a hugely important part in saving Gondor from ruin.  2) Denethor dies before Aragorn tries to claim the throne and the heir to the Stewardship, Faramir, is thrilled that King has come at last.  3) ""The hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known.” is some wisdom said by Ioreth. Aragorn cements his claim as the rightful King by healing Faramir, Eowyn, Merry, and I believe unnamed others of their hurts during the Seige of Minas Tirith.  4) He returns to Gondor victorious beyond hope, The Dark Lord is no more, Barad-Dur is destroyed, The Southrons and Haradrim are fleeing, and Orcs and all manner of fell-creature have been destroyed or kill themselves. Honestly, even if Aragorn wasn't the rightful heir don't you think the people would desire his Lordship anyway?  Even if the people don't think Aragorn single-handedly saved Gondor (which he did not) many of the major characters and factions have already been rallied to support Aragorn. Eomer, the now King of Rohan, considers Aragorn to be a dear friend. You can bet Southern Gondor already supports him when he came through with the Grey Company and the Army of the Dead, routing the Corsairs. Gandalf, know as Mithrandir in Gondor supports Aragorn as well."

The claim was rejected.

The thing is they were going to have Arwen at Helm's Deep, hence the elves, but changed their minds and were stuck with a load of Helm's Deep footage with elves in, so they added Haldir and I guess they added that corny dream sequence because he was suppose to connect with Arwen.  The main problem is it was damage control, I think they did a good job reducing the damage although it is kind of pointless to have him fake die in the middle of the film.  But yes, the main issue with Helm's Deep is all the elves conveniently dying. I suppose Arwen would've just buggered off home afterwards instead of joining Aragorn on the paths of the dead, having a weird warrior-but-love-interest scene with Aragorn while Gimli and Legolas just awkwardly sit there.  I understand changing the army of the dead's role and removing some of the other Dol Amroth armies is to simplify the film, and it meant we could spent more time with the siege and the Rohirrim charge, but that created a plothole, or logic hole, with the whole ""yeah just go away ghost army, no need to clear out Mordor or anything""."

What I'm planning to do is after I finish the books, I'll rent the theatrical versions on Blu-Ray from a local movie rental shop, and watch them with my brother, sister and dad. My sister and brother were big fans as kids when the LotR films came out (we have TTT on VHS and the PS2 game), but now they've forgotten a good amount of it since they were pretty young at the time. My dad and I have never seen them, and it seems like something he'd enjoy.  One reason I want to watch the theatricals first is to get a good idea of what people experienced when they came out in cinemas, and to watch the ""weaker"" versions first. As well, I'm not too sure my family would fancy sitting through bordering on or over four-hour films, lol. After, if I enjoy them, I'll probably buy the Extended trilogy box set on Blu-Ray shortly after and they'll be my go-tos from then on.  Don't know when I'll watch the Hobbit films. Funnily enough, the only Middle-earth movie I've seen is Desolation of Smaug when it came out in cinemas. My friend wanted to see it, and since I didn't care about them much at the time and was bored, I decided to go. I really enjoyed it. I guess I have to thank my mom though for getting me into LotR by advising me to read more fiction novels, since I wasn't reading at all and it would help my school work in English.

What I did was get a downloadable version for my iPad, downloaded a detailed map on my iPad of Middle-Earth, and got the Extended Edition blu ray box set of the movies.    As I read, i would constantly check the map to see where they were and where they were headed.  The adventure felt so real this time!  Aftet every 50-100 pages I would watch the movie up until where I was in the book and stop.  It helped me visualize and recap all that was going on as I was reading.  I essentially started TFotR about seven times before I finally watched it all the way through.  It was also fun to compare the books and movies with both so fresh in my head.

lotr,34j4x0,twiggyace,45,Sat May 2 02:54:56 2015 UTC,"Gandalf says ""don't tempt me"" when Frodo tries to hand him the ring.  The ring has a supernatural ability to tempt the hearts of men that Aragorn is aware of, and he's aware of the deceits like Gandalf so naturally he says nothing of any sort to show he wants it, but he never has a chance to hold the ring or be tempted because he never puts himself in the position to be tempted by it. They all know fully well any temptation is magic and dangerous so they try to ignore the temptation. Besides if anyone did try to take the ring they'd be dead before they knew where to run. So that argument falls there.  For Gimli and Legolas, they were basically told by their lords ""touch the ring and die"" like everyone else except Boromir who had no order from a superior, so that's why there is no indication. Also, I think it should be said that Boromir had no respect for Gandalf's opinion on the matter and was a brash, out spoken man. Which is why his temptation was obvious. He knew fully well he was a dead man if he took the ring and ran, that's why he uses the opportunity of the battle to try steal it and run.   So to summarize, just because there was no obvious temptation from Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli does not mean there was none. Maybe if they had've ended up alone with Frodo they may have tried to take the ring. But where would they take it? Back to the lords that told them to have it destroyed?"

lotr,34j4x0,Jarderz,1 point,Tue May 12 18:59:18 2015 UTC,Also in the films there is the moment after Frodo falls off the stone structure when he holds out the ring where it looks like Aragón is going to take the ring before he closes Frodo hand around it. Can't think of any moment when Legolas or Gimli was tempted. I guess if the fellowship had stayed together it would just have been a matter of time maybe?
lotr,34j4x0,xColxMustardx,10,Tue May 12 19:06:44 2015 UTC,"That's not true.   Gandalf,  Aragorn, and Gimli, (not sure about Legolas.) have all been manipulated by the ring in some way shape or form.     Gimli is tempted into an outburst of strength as soon as he sees it,  Aragorn is tempted when Frodo offers to give it up to him,  and Gandalf is also tempted at least twice by it in the movie,  and once in the book."
lotr,34j4x0,igneel77777,12,Fri May 1 23:23:56 2015 UTC,"Boromir does tell Aragorn before he dies that he tried to take the ring, though Aragorn doesn't share it with anyone until much later."

He was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was resting. But Aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black-feathered arrows; his sword was still in his hand, but it was broken near the hilt; his horn cloven in two was at his side. Many Orcs lay slain, piled all about him and at his feet.  Aragorn knelt beside him. Boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak. At last slow words came. 'I tried to take the Ring from Frodo,' he said. 'I am sorry. I have paid.' His glance strayed to his fallen enemies; twenty at least lay there. 'They have gone: the Halflings: the Orcs have taken them. I think they are not dead. Orcs bound them.' He paused and his eyes closed wearily. After a moment he spoke again.  'Farewell, Aragorn! Go to Minas Tirith and save my people! I have failed.'"
lotr,34j4x0,svantevid,28,Fri May 1 17:07:42 2015 UTC,"The Fellowship knows, that it's impossible for them to come unnoticed into Mordor. Frodo and Sam alone had much more chances. Also, Saruman knows that some hobbit has the ring, but he doesn't know which one. If Saruman caught Merry and Pippin, he would have probably tortured them and found out everything about Frodo. While orcs were busy looking for Merry and Pippin and Saruman was busy attacking Helms Deep, Frodo and Sam got into Mordor almost unnoticed by Sauron and Saruman."
lotr,34j4x0,Long-SHOT,15,Fri May 1 17:49:01 2015 UTC,"This is not stated in the books or movies, but I have always thought that if the hunters did not chase after merry and pippin it would be suspicious to sauruman. He has crows watching everything, so he would notice if no one seemed to care that his orcs captured a few hobbits.   I know that seems like a longshot, but there is a lot of feigning in LotR. I still think Aragon taking an army to the black gate knowing that all of them are going to die JUST to distract Sauron is one of the most heroic moves in literature. They know that battle can't be won, and they all marched anyway."
lotr,34j4x0,TheLoudThoughts,9,Fri May 1 17:54:53 2015 UTC,"Tolkien, always keeping the grim strength of Germanic heroes in mind, certainly wanted you to see the bold hero marching into his doom. They are so faithfully bound to their duty that they are willing to march into certain death. These scenes hearken heroes like Beowulf and his final fight with the dragon, the unstoppable force. He sought to put the Germanic myths into a grander context."
lotr,34j4x0,DividingPrescott,14,Fri May 1 18:07:17 2015 UTC,"The fellowship did not know Gandalf's plan once they escaped Moria. This created tension within the fellowship, as Boromir wanted the party to travel south to Minas Tirith, where he was headed back to. Aragorn wanted to go to Minas Tirith as well, but would not abandon Frodo, if Frodo wished to go a different route. Frodo did not want to go to Minas Tirith, because he knew that Boromir desperately wanted the ring to be taken there to use for the aid of Gondor. When the fellowship left Rivendell, they were told that none were bound to Follow Frodo. That they could travel as short or as far with the Fellowship as each member pleased. The idea of the fellowship splitting at some point was something to be expected, as it was known that they would reach a point where they would have to choose between Minas Tirith or an alternative.   After Frodo fled and escaped, Sam was the only one who was able to realize what Frodo had done… abandoned the group to save them from the burden of the ring and passage into Mordor (Frodo, from the time of leaving the shire, hated that anyone, especially his friends, would follow him in his exile). The other’s discovered this, and figured out also that Frodo did not want them along. They had a few choices at that point. Pursue the Ring bearer and ignore his decision, continue on to Minas Tirith to rally the troopes around the  returned king who had not yet proven his valor or legitimacy, or pursue Merry and Pippen who were captured. In the end, they felt like the only obvious option was to help their friends who were in dire need of rescuing.   The rest is history."
lotr,34j4x0,AmbiguousAnonymous,8,Fri May 1 17:13:05 2015 UTC,"Totally agree.  Plus Aragorn knew he had a path back to Gondor that he had to fulfill for the kingship, and that was his part to play in all this.  It was really only Gimli and Legolas who were left with any choice, and even then Aragorn bent their wills toward his.  I always loved that pursuit, its described to be so epicly in the book."
lotr,34j4x0,DR_SAP,18,Fri May 1 20:47:30 2015 UTC,"A few thoughts on this, which perhaps you have already considered.   1- The elven cloaks, which hide them from spying eyes above.  2- Lembas - they didn't seem to need much in the way of survival skills, given they already had food.  3- They got a guide, in a way, with Gollum.  4- The Ring itself - I have always taken to the interpretation that the One didn't want to be found by a lesser being. That although the Ringwraiths were searching for it, it was not searching for a Ringwraith. It was answering the call of Sauron, and using Frodo as a means to get to Mordor. I know that some people will argue that the One took part in it's own destruction, but I don't favor this reading."
lotr,34j4x0,WowzersInMyTrowzers,13,Fri May 1 21:56:26 2015 UTC,"Well the One did take part in it's destruction, but I don't think it intended it to end that way. It wanted Frodo get captured which is why Frodo wasn't able to let go of the Ring. The only reason the Ring wast successful is because Gollum acted outside of the Rings will.   So it played a part in it's own destruction. Albeit, unintentionally."
lotr,34j4x0,DR_SAP,6,Fri May 1 18:40:10 2015 UTC,"I think we agree more than not.  However, I should say that I was addressing reasons why I think that Frodo/Sam didn't get caught on their way to Mordor. The ring, aside from being this least useful version of invisibility regarding Nazgul, I always inferred offered some protection to those that served its own purposes. For the purposes of returning to Mordor, Frodo was a good ticket to ride. After they got there would be a different story, and one that involves the interference of Gollum.  So from when the fellowship breaks up until arrival at Mt. Doom, the ring is pro-Frodo. Once there, the ring is anti-Frodo. But really it only really self serving. Am I close?"
lotr,34j4x0,WowzersInMyTrowzers,3,Fri May 1 19:04:49 2015 UTC,Yea that definitely makes sense.
lotr,34j4x0,DuranStar,1 point,Fri May 1 17:36:22 2015 UTC,"I have a very different opinion of how the ring works which explains all the temptations characters suffer and more importantly why many characters where not tempted by the ring.  The ring has will but not intelligence.  The ring can't plan or scheme, all it can do is try to fulfill its function which is to dominate and control. It kills Isuldur out of spite for taking the ring away from someone who wielded it, missing that it would eventually be able to corrupt one of his line. Gandalf tells Frodo 'don't tempt me' not because he's actually under the rings control or being affected by it's temptation, he knows eventually he will want to use the ring for the power and he'll be stuck. Galadriel says it herself she always wondered what she would do it if it came to her and she resisted not the power of the temptation but the wanting the elven world to be sustained, she accepted the time of the elves was ending. Boromir succumbed because he didn't understand the danger and was easily twisted and even he was fine until Loth-Lorien where he found out that Minas Tirith would surely fall without it (not explicit in the books or movies but heavily implied).  The biggest proof is Sam's internal monolog after he gets the ring. It is the only time you see a characters temptation from their own perspective as they are being tempted. The ring offers him the power to conquer Mordor and turn in into a realm of gardens. It's obvious to readers this would not work on Sam he's never desired power in any form, but it's the only thing the ring can offer is power. It can tailor it's offering to the things you want but it can't offer anything else.  The ring doesn't care who wields it only that someone is, since if they aren't the strongest someone else will take it away and then it will control them. It only wants to get back to Sauron because it was once a part of him and it knows their goals will always be the same."
lotr,34j4x0,Gredorian,1 point,Fri May 1 18:11:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I fully subscribe to this interpretation, but it would be a good way to explain why the Ring, as hard as it was to carry any time, would only REALLY start to fuck with Frodo and become absolutely unbearable to carry (by becoming extremely heavy, for instance) once he started to get closer and closer to Mordor and Orodruin."
lotr,34j4x0,BrotyKraut,0,Fri May 1 20:05:39 2015 UTC,Wouldn't the only reason that the ring failed be due to Eru intervening and pushing gollum?
lotr,34j4x0,Gredorian,1 point,Fri May 1 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree. The Ring had to be on the brink in the first place for Eru to give it a final push, I'd say that was definitely not the only reason. Now if you want to be pedantic and say that Eru already had the entire journey in mind and it couldn't fail, well, then don't read fantasy books loosely based on Abrahamic religions because that's what an all-powerful all-knowing deity does, it makes everything sound rather pointless.    I think this comment sounded rather aggressive but it's not my intention by the way, I don't actually think you want to be pedantic."
lotr,34j4x0,kern_q1,1 point,Sat May 2 00:33:05 2015 UTC,I don't see a problem with Eru knowing that the whole thing wouldn't fail. The characters did not know it and they still had to do the work.   It seems to me that Eru or the Valar affected events more than people suspect. Sauron was never going to have final victory even if this particular quest failed. The Valar/Eru would have kept striving for his destruction.
lotr,34j4x0,twiggyace,1 point,Sat May 2 01:47:29 2015 UTC,"In addition to the survival skills. It was well known by the hobbits that they were considerably smarter than men.

lotr,34j4x0,CrookedMinded,4,Fri May 1 21:19:53 2015 UTC,"I think the real reason is that they're is only a fools hope of them succeeding from the beginning. They could have sent Glorfindel at the beginning of the quest, whose one of the  greatest warriors, but decide to fill up the Fellowship with Merry and Pippin. They put their hope in Frodo, and when he leaves them, they have to do the best they can, which is to try to save Merry and Pippin."

lotr,34j4x0,diacute,1 point,Fri May 1 21:56:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, so stupid! If the temptation of the ring was too much, rather than let him go alone, let him think  he's going alone but secretly track him, stay hodden, but be there to defend him when he gets in trouble. So much could have been avoided had Aragorn followed Frodo. Then again the world of men would have failed so maybe it's a wash."
lotr,34j4x0,dr_amy_bishop,1 point,Fri May 1 16:34:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's also that Frodo was the carrier, I mean he choose to go alone (with Sam) and take the ring to Mordor, and the fellowship had  to agree and trust him, and try to save the other hobbits."

It would be an unbelievable miracle even if they had a guide. The whole idea was fundamentally a fool's hope.  Anyway, Aragorn explains his thinking explicitly:   'Let me think!' said Aragorn. 'And now may I make a right choice and change the evil fate of this unhappy day!' He stood silent for a moment. 'I will follow the Orcs,' he said at last. 'I would have guided Frodo to Mordor and gone with him to the end; but if I seek him now in the wilderness, I must abandon the captives to torment and death. My heart speaks clearly at last: the fate of the Bearer is in my hands no longer.'   He lives in a world of categorical moral imperatives. It's not morally permissible for him to not attempt to rescue Merry and Pippin. The fact that they're relatively ""unimportant"" to the fate of the world is irrelevant; they're innocent captives of Saruman and Frodo and Sam are currently free and safe."

lotr,34kq0t,doymand,3,Sat May 2 02:17:01 2015 UTC,"While that is true, there are a few things that I considered:  1 man vs 20 larger foes and having the man come out on top is not just excellent. It's legendary. And Boromir not only would have continued that way for some time had they not switched to ranged combat, but he wasn't even the best fighter in the Fellowship. Give him the Trio of Epicness that is Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas working alongside him, and they could do significantly more damage (hell, even the hobbits might do some stabbing work)  In addition, the Rohirrim also fought a larger force than the initial raiding party. Remember that a group from Moria and another from Mordor had joined with them (though some, but not all, split off), and another group of Uruk-hai was waiting in the forest and attacked as well. The Rohirrim might well have killed the original raiding party without a single casualty if not for these factors.  I'm not saying the Fellowship won't lose a member or two, but I believe they had the potential to eliminate the raiding party, at least to the point where the rest go running off in fear of the team of elite badasses."
lotr,34kq0t,doymand,3,Sat May 2 02:27:29 2015 UTC,"Given the numbers it seems like a longshot:  In ""The Uruk-Hai"" it says:   ""Most of the Northerners broke away and dashed off, over a hundred of them...   And this is before Grishnakh returns with his company of Mordor Orcs, so they were all present at Amon Hen.  Then of the remaining Orcs:   The hobbits were left with the Isengarders: a grim dark band, four score at least...   That puts the tally up to 180 (some of the Northerners stayed as well) at least that are still living and were present at when the company was attacked. And those 80 were the uruk-hai. Of the ones Boromir killed, he only took out 4 of Saruman's uruk-hai.  Then let's say Boromir killed 20 which would then be 200, and we know Gimli and Legolas killed some and those other numbers were the minimum. So for a final number let's say 250 were present.  Now the question is whether the 8 of them could have stood against 250 Orcs?  I would still be inclined to say no. Saruman's group seemed well disciplined and would have helped to keep the others in line longer before they would have otherwise scattered.  We know that Legolas runs out of arrows even before him and Gimli meet up with Aragorn after Boromir's death, so there goes their ranged component. And much like Boromir they would have no protection against arrows. None save Frodo had any sort of armor. Aragorn, Boromir, Gimli and Legolas would have put up a strong fight and the Hobbits would probably have sliced a few but I think they would have succumbed to sheer numbers."
lotr,34kq0t,PersonUsingAComputer,3,Sat May 2 03:23:32 2015 UTC,"None save Frodo had any sort of armor.   Gimli also had a shirt of chain mail, but I doubt it would make that much difference against >200 orcs."

While they would still be able to put up a decent fight, I have a lot more doubt about their odds. I was imagining the original party was closer to 100 total. And even with all of them, they couldn't intimidate the Uruk-hai into running, so they'd at least fight to the last man.  I guess the real question is now how many would they have killed? And that is before the Uruk-hai wise up and just shoot them all."
lotr,34kq0t,2rkpride,2,Sat May 2 03:38:47 2015 UTC,"I think The Fellowship's true value to the ring bearer was not sheer force but guidance.  They traveled as a group and hid.

lotr,34ka3y,Gredorian,3,Fri May 1 23:07:24 2015 UTC,"To illustrate this, if I remember correctly, it's said that pretty much everything, to the last grain of sand, has at least some evil influence of Melkor imbued into it. I'm not sure what that means, but it sure as fuck sounds like it takes a lot more power than being able to kick any particular Ainu's ass."
lotr,34ka3y,PersonUsingAComputer,8,Sat May 2 02:01:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in Morgoth's Ring, this is how Tolkien describes Melkor's influence:   Melkor 'incarnated' himself (as Morgoth) permanently. He did this so as to control the hroa, the 'flesh' or physical matter, of Arda. He attempted to identify himself with it. A vaster, and more perilous, procedure, though of similar sort to the operations of Sauron with the Rings. Thus, outside the Blessed Realm, all 'matter' was likely to have a 'Melkor ingredient', and those who had bodies, nourished by the hroa of Arda, had as it were a tendency, small or great, towards Melkor: they were none of them wholly free of him in their incarnate form, and their bodies had an effect upon their spirits.  But in this way Morgoth lost (or exchanged, or transmuted) the greater part of his original 'angelic' powers, of mind and spirit, while gaining a terrible grip upon the physical world. For this reason he had to be fought, mainly by physical force, and enormous material ruin was a probable consequence of any direct combat with him, victorious or otherwise. This is the chief explanation of the constant reluctance of the Valar to come into open battle against Morgoth. Manwe's task and problem was much more difficult than Gandalf's. Sauron's, relatively smaller, power was concentrated; Morgoth's vast power was disseminated. The whole of 'Middle-earth' was Morgoth's Ring, though temporarily his attention was mainly upon the North-west. Unless swiftly successful, War against him might well end in reducing all Middle-earth to chaos, possibly even all Arda. It is easy to say: 'It was the task and function of the Elder King to govern Arda and make it possible for the Children of Eru to live in it unmolested.' But the dilemma of the Valar was this: Arda could only be liberated by a physical battle; but a probable result of such a battle was the irretrievable ruin of Arda. Moreover, the final eradication of Sauron (as a power directing evil) was achievable by the destruction of the Ring. No such eradication of Morgoth was possible, since this required the complete disintegration of the 'matter' of Arda. Sauron's power was not (for example) in gold as such, but in a particular form or shape made of a particular portion of total gold. Morgoth's power was disseminated throughout Gold, if nowhere absolute (for he did not create Gold) it was nowhere absent. (It was this Morgoth-element in matter, indeed, which was a prerequisite for such 'magic' and other evils as Sauron practised with it and upon it.)  It is quite possible, of course, that certain 'elements' or conditions of matter had attracted Morgoth's special attention (mainly, unless in the remote past, for reasons of his own plans). For example, all gold (in Middle-earth) seems to have had a specially 'evil' trend - but not silver. Water is represented as being almost entirely free of Morgoth. (This, of course, does not mean that any particular sea, stream, river, well, or even vessel of water could not be poisoned or defiled - as all things could.)"

lotr,34j9w3,Aerosteel,3,Sat May 2 04:38:38 2015 UTC,I read the study. But I wonder what was their point. During wartime and in great danger people are known to do amazing feats. And nothing suggests that Aragorn or the men of Rohan were constantly in very intense physical struggle and in their maximum oxygen uptake levels or that they did not have ANY breaks.
lotr,34j9w3,sakor88,2,Sat May 2 14:39:58 2015 UTC,"A fun theory, though probably not necessary. Humans can do extraordinary things when pushed to it.   Throughout three days and nights of fierce fighting, Major Currie’s gallant conduct and contempt for danger set a magnificent example to all ranks of the force under his command. [...] Since all the officers under his command were either killed or wounded during the action, Major Currie had virtually no respite from his duties and in fact obtained only one hour’s sleep during the entire period.  Nevertheless he did not permit his fatigue to become apparent to his troops and throughout the action took every opportunity to visit weapon pits and other defensive posts to talk to his men, to advise them as to the best use of their weapons and to cheer them with words of encouragement.  When his force was finally relieved and he was satisfied that the turnover was complete he fell asleep on his feet and collapsed.   If a real human can manage a defensive position for three days and nights, it's no stretch for Aragorn to run the defense of Helm's Deep for one night."
lotr,34hi2d,Forgotten_Prodigy,4,Fri May 1 04:51:50 2015 UTC,"Sounds awesome!  I guess you've got to decide whether to use the films or books as your main source material. A lovely character to use if you choose the books would be Tom Bombadil, especially as he doesn't seem phased/affected by the power of the ring - why?  For an essay I'd generally start with a sort of overview of what we mean by - in this case - ""power""....I'd head to a dictionary, but I'm thinking in this case that it would lend itself to mean control over others and events.  There's a really interesting contrast of power in LOTR. It has Wizards and noble kings interacting with lowly Hobbits. Then Legolas et al using his elf powers to do stuff the others cannot, and all kinds of magic.  You say you're looking for about 5 characters...just off the top of my head, 5 interesting characters in the Fellowship of the Ring and their relation to power might be as so:  Bombadil - as above, he's not affected Gandalf - magic powers but isn't power-hungry Gollum - corrupted by the power of the ring Saruman - corrupted by desire for power Frodo - no particular magic/influential powers, but does awesome stuff nonetheless  Sauron would be an obvious choice too. Interesting subject, hope it goes well!"
lotr,34hi2d,Toasted-Dinosaur,5,Fri May 1 10:15:30 2015 UTC,"If you want to talk about how Power can corrupt then the best characters for that are probably Feanor, Melkor, and Saruman.  Unfortunately the first two characters aren't in the Fellowship of the Ring so I guess you gotta work with Saruman.  From a perspective of Power Saruman is the greatest of the Istari. Power is often related to where you are in a particular hierarchy and Saruman is both head of the Istari and the White Council. I think that it's confirmable that Saruman should have been the most ""Powerful"" when Gandalf returns from death as the White and says he is now as Saruman should have been  As far as corruption goes, he was sent from the West to encourage the Free Peoples of Middle-earth to resist Sauron and as we know, Saruman fails utterly.  It is a shame you can't use more of Tolkien's work.  Morgoth is the archetype for Power corrupting.  Feanor is a great example. He is supposedly the greatest of the Noldoli (A house of Elves) and creates the Silmarils (3 perfect Jewels) and starts a war against Morgoth when he steals them.  Ar-Pharazon would also work.   ""Ar-Pharazôn the Golden was the proudest and most powerful of all the Kings, and no less than the kingship of the world was his desire."" —The Lord of the Rings, Appendix A   He leads a Numenorean invasion of the Undying Lands, because of the counsel of Sauron, to take immortality by force."
lotr,34hi2d,Xecellseor,2,Fri May 1 19:04:14 2015 UTC,"And idea : Maybe you could focus on the geatest power of them all but one that is so ubiquitous, its hard to determine that its even there.    A relevant quote:    Gandalf : ""Saruman believes it is only great power that can hold evil in check. But that is not what I have found. I've found it is the small things, everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keeps the darkness at bay. Simple acts of kindness and love. Why Bilbo Baggins? Perhaps it is because I am afraid... and he gives me courage.""     It might be hard, but definitely will be very unique. And might even turn out to be a discovery-fueled fun personally as well."

lotr,34gsu7,TheHoodRat,6,Fri May 1 14:25:39 2015 UTC,No
lotr,34gsu7,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Fri May 1 01:06:31 2015 UTC,"Since you're premise is that the films are racist, lets stick to what we see in the films:   White Orcs White Nazgul Balrogs and Spiders I admit you've got me. Even if we were to slip back on the text, Tolkien describes them as dark. Though I'm not sure how much racism you could cull from their textual descriptions  White Wargs I assume by ""Shades"" you meant the spirits of men that comprise the Army of the Dead, which is actually a bright greenish-yellow. If you meant something else, please explain. Barrow-wights aren't in the films. I'm not sure what you're referring to. In the books they were spirits and admittedly were described as dark. As for men, I admit once more that the Haradrim are pretty clearly dark-skinned...Or are they?. The few closeup shots of Easterlings there are clearly show light-skin. The Corsairs also pretty clearly include many men of Caucasian descent, though I admit certain of the costumes might have an Asian influence. I assume the first thing that comes to mind when you think Dark-skinned men in LotR is this guy. Who was played by Todd Rippon...But you know you're right, he does look pretty dark skinned for a white guy.   Bonus: (All white or light-skinned)   Saruman Wormtongue Dunlendings Mouth of Sauron Smeagol Gollum       Now can we please put this notion that LotR contains racist themes because all the evil guys are black to rest? There is no pattern (see above). Light vs. dark imagery is some of the oldest that human civilization has come up with. It symbolizes good vs. evil. It does not symbolize light-skin vs dark-skin. You could certainly present the argument that the films lack diversity in the casting. I would agree with you there, but you're trying to argue that the evil is portrayed only as dark-skinned which simply isn't true."

lotr,34gsu7,Farthain,1 point,Fri May 1 02:13:12 2015 UTC,"It's not actively racist, but I think making the ""good guys"" white is just a symptom of a more fundamental issue, and that's the assumption that white is ""normal"". If they made them black, or asian, or hispanic, they wouldn't be normal, they would stand out. A black elf wouldn't be able to just be an elf, it would be defined by the fact that it's a black elf. And obviously, the fundamental nature of this issue means that the only way to overcome this issue is to include more of those group in films as not defined by the fact of their skin color, but just as a person (once again, the black elf isn't a black elf, its just a regular elf just like every other elf.)   In terms of the ""bad side"", orcs tend to be various shades, so I wouldn't call them black. Nazgul, Spiders, Wargs, etc. are all portrayed not as black the race, but black as in the color (black the race is honestly not referring to a color, black people don't actually have black skin. It's just a word that's been decided to refer to that particular group.) Finally, the men of the east being bad is less a racial thing and more a symptom of the world. They're right freaking next to mordor, and Tolkien also may have had some old world assumptions about the east that carried over to their design, but we definately do see evil men coming from all racial backgrounds.  Finally, I do not believe Tolkien was a racist: http://io9.com/5892697/whats-classier-than-jrr-tolkien-telling-off-nazis-absolutely-nothing"
lotr,34gsu7,Uluithiad,0,Fri May 1 01:10:18 2015 UTC,The films are certainly whitewashed. But no more than usual from Hollywood.
lotr,34gsu7,ktchong,-2,Fri May 1 01:55:43 2015 UTC,"The movie, mostly no.  The books, yes, a little.    The books were written back when white racism was the accepted norm.  The movie had to made changes to do away with that racism that is no longer accepted in our time. (For example: in the books, the portrayals of Easterlings and Southrons are somewhat problematic racist stereotypes of certain ethnic groups in our world.  However, the movies made modern changes to the characterizations of those people, i.e., by not staying completely faithful to how the books describe those people, by not casting certain races as Easterlings and Southrons as how they were portrayed in the books.)"
lotr,34gsu7,Uluithiad,4,Fri May 1 16:23:26 2015 UTC,"That's a crock of shit. The films made greater breaks with the books when it cast all the good guys as extremely white. The only difference between movie Rohan and movie Gondor is that Rohan is hair color. Where are the darker-skinned Gondorians? And why do the films drastically reduce or neglect to include all of the lighter-skinned evil people, like Dunlendings and the Mouth of Sauron?"

It has been some years since I last read RotK so I may be wrong, but I remember book Faramir like a «guy with more balls» (hope.it doesn't sound very rude :P )  Anyway, I understand that Jackson thought this change would make for a better plot, but I just wanted to share that I don't share his point of view on this particular topic (but I do on a lot of others.

I really can't remember what my favorite chapter was upon first reading, but my favorite chapter since then is The Passing of the Grey Company. It was fantastic on its own, but it's enhanced by the Aragorn backstory that you'll eventually read in the appendices. Without going into detail, it richly contextualizes a lot of what occurs in that largely Aragorn-centric chapter."

This meant keeping elven ""magic"" alive in rivendell and lorien, as well as stretching the life of the wielders of the great rings of power. When the One was destroyed, the power of the rings to preserve was nullified. Bilbo, who had not aged since he was 50 finally had time catch up with him, and he was ancient when he finally left middle earth. Gollum, who was a decedent of hobbits, was several centuries older than the oldest hobbit could possibly live. He would have been undone. As a matter of fact, part of the reason gollum wants the ring back so much is because he knows its destruction will kill him.  Edit: During Gollums attack as Sam and Frodo climb Mt. Doom:   'Don't kill us,' he wept. 'Don't hurt us with nassty cruel steel! Let us live, yes, live just a little longer. Lost, lost! We're lost. And when Precious goes we'll die, yes, die into the dust.' He clawed up the ashes of the path with his long fleshless fingers. 'Dusst!' he hissed."

lotr,341cwn,sagemoss5,2,Mon Apr 27 16:02:58 2015 UTC,"I have always wondered if that was the case, why didn't Bilbo die as well. I know it is theoretically possible for a hobbit to live as long as he did but at least he should have rapidly aged after the ring was destroyed, right?"
lotr,341cwn,DividingPrescott,10,Mon Apr 27 16:46:58 2015 UTC,"He did rapidly age after the ring destroyed. When he left middle earth, he had outlived the oldest hobbit in history (the Old Took) by 1 year. Its possible he did so with help from the ring, but once it was destroyed, he did age and became really really freaking old"
lotr,341cwn,Gilgamesh-,4,Mon Apr 27 17:00:55 2015 UTC,"Not quite. He did begin to age rapidly, but it wasn't an instantaneous transformation to 'really old'."
lotr,341cwn,sakor88,10,Mon Apr 27 20:13:16 2015 UTC,"Tolkien wrote in some of his letters (if I remember correctly) that if Gollum had repented, he would have thrown himself into the Fire with the Ring, thus in a sense preventing Sauron from taking it away from him."
lotr,341cwn,EyeceEyeceBaby,13,Mon Apr 27 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"Regarding the hypothetical situation in which Sam recognizes Gollum's repentance, rather than shutting it down:   ...what could then have happened? The course of the entry into Mordor and the struggle to reach Mount Doom would have been different, and so would the ending. The interest would have shifted to Gollum, I think, and the battle that would have gone on between his repentance and his new love on one side and the Ring. Though the love would have been strengthened daily it could not have wrested mastery from the Ring. I think that in some queer twisted and pitiable way Gollum would have tried (not maybe with conscious design) to satisfy both. Certainly at some point not long before the end he would have stolen the Ring or taken it by violence (as he does in the actual Tale). But 'possession' satisfied, I think he would then have sacrificed himself for Frodo's sake and have voluntarily cast himself into the fiery abyss.  I think that an effect of his partial regeneration by love would have been a clearer vision when he claimed the Ring. He would have perceived the evil of Sauron, and suddenly realized that he could not use the Ring and had not the strength or stature to keep it in Sauron's despite: the only way to keep it and hurt Sauron was to destroy it and himself together - and in a flash he may have seen that this would also be the greatest service to Frodo. - Letter 246"
lotr,341cwn,DividingPrescott,7,Mon Apr 27 16:20:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing that. Very tragic. I wish the story ended like this, as I was amongst those who always pitied gollum more than anything."
lotr,341cwn,EyeceEyeceBaby,7,Mon Apr 27 16:33:58 2015 UTC,"You're not alone. If you haven't read Tolkien's letters yet, he mentions a few times that he always ""most moved by Sam's disquisition on the seamless web of story, and by the scene when Frodo goes to sleep on his breast, and the tragedy of Gollum who at that moment came within a hair of repentance - but for one rough word from Sam."" I think it might be the Catholic in him that was truly torn with this figure who came so close to repentance, but at the crucial moment had forgiveness withheld from him."

lotr,341cwn,sakor88,6,Mon Apr 27 17:35:54 2015 UTC,"No... they are ""immortal"" by nature. With their rings they had made their lands little gardens, little bit separate from the rest of the world. In Lórien, time moved differently (for outside world the Fellowship spent one month in Lórien, but it seemed just few days for the Fellowship). Elves (at least the ones who came over the Sea) wanted to be embalmers of Middle-earth, I suppose because they wanted also to stop their own fading away, or at least slow it down. When the One Ring was destroyed, the Three Rings lost their power."
lotr,341cwn,DividingPrescott,3,Mon Apr 27 17:51:55 2015 UTC,"To add to this, the elves wanted to make middle earth as beautiful as the undying lands, because in middle earth they were the masters and eldest race. Overseas, they were the children under the gods. This power struggle was partially why they wanted to cling to middle earth   I just started reading the silmarilian last night for the first time. I'm still going through the preface, but there is a letter from tolkien in my 2nd edition version, and he basically is explaining to someone how the story unfolds. So far it's really good, and sums up nicely the 1st and 2nd age history in a few pages. I suggest it to anyone who wants to better understand the elven motivations."
lotr,341cwn,Zaxor42,2,Mon Apr 27 18:13:08 2015 UTC,"Hum... I don't think so. If I'm not recalling wrong elves are immortal because Eru made them immortal, not for any kind of spell or sorcery.  But I might be forgetting some important detail here."

lotr,341oll,valley_pete,14,Mon Apr 27 16:40:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think Aragorn, Merry and Pippin would have been allowed into Valinor, even if they wanted to go. In all of history, the only mortal to ever have been granted life in Valinor was Tuor (although that's based on a single line that's somewhat ""it was later said"" rather than a definitive statement). More than that, he was a man that was counted among the elves. I realize they all played important roles in the War of the Ring, but I don't think their actions merit a trip to the Undying Lands. The fact that Bilbo, Frodo, and Sam were Ringbearers makes them special. The Ring was an unbelievable burden, despite the (comparatively) little effect it had on Bilbo and Sam. This was a special gift given to them for that purpose.   As for the others, all except Gimli had the right to be there. Gimli is another somewhat special case. If memory serves, he was granted this special gift due to his friendship with Legolas, and the fact that he had Galadriel's favor (not sure on that though)."

We have heard tell that Legolas took Gimli Glóin's son with him because of their great friendship, greater than any that has been between Elf and Dwarf. If this is true, then it is strange indeed: that a Dwarf should be willing to leave Middle-earth for any love, or that the Eldar should receive him, or that the Lords of the West should permit it. But it is said that Gimli went also out of desire to see again the beauty of Galadriel; and it may be that she, being mighty among the Eldar, obtained this grace for him. More cannot be said of this matter."

He was a restoration of the kings of old, and their honor was in giving way to death - the gift of Iluvatar to man. Aragorn was bound to Middle Earth as a means of restoring the line of kings and ushering in the Age of Men, thus the great sadness of Elrond for the love between Aragorn and Arwen, he knew that no matter what, she would feel the loss of love and grow weary beyond hope.   Merry and Pippin, in short they were ineligible. Yes, they helped move the pieces that lead to Sauron's destruction, but in the eyes of the Valar, they were cogs.

I actually flew back to my hometown to go see it at opening with friends I grew up with. Lots of fun and I did that each year for the next two movies.   As for the movies themselves, it took me many viewings to appreciate them since I had built up in my mind a different version from the books for so many years, but once I did I love them as an alternate vision of one of my great loves in literature and media.

I couldn't even leave my seat in the theater for awhile, I was so overcome.  So, when my husband told me there was going to be a new version made, I actually burst into tears.

lotr,340u90,DividingPrescott,13,Mon Apr 27 15:03:04 2015 UTC,"I was young, still in high school. It's hard to recall how I felt, but i know I was pumped. I do remember the intro sequence with Galadriel's voice and the history of the ring when I first saw fellowship, and I remember getting chills and teary eyed, and being so grateful that I lived in an age where seeing LOTR in a live action visual medium of the story was possible.   With the hobbit being my favorite book, it had the opposite effect on me. It was like all the magic was sucked out of the story, whereas LoTR felt like finally being allowed to step into a world I had always wanted to visit.    I didn't doubt that the movies could be made when they were announced, mainly because the technology was ripe and ready for that sort of thing, which to me always seemed like the barrier to putting the films on screen.  Now that I'm older, I don't appreciate the films as much, as I feel like they are very basic, and miss the mark in many ways. I find them to be overly flashy, usually too concerned with how to execute a fight maneuver than worry about lore, and that puts me off. I'll still give props to the original trilogy for what it is, though I typically prefer the animated Trilogy to the live action hexology."
lotr,340u90,behemebash,4,Mon Apr 27 13:29:20 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree with you more.  To answer OP's question, I was also in High School when Fellowship came out. All of my friends and I were extremely hyped about the movies, and saw all of them in theaters. I knew people that went so far as to dress up for the midnight premiers of each movie. No one doubted that the movies could be made, as we had just gotten the Matrix in '99. It proved that the technology was there. I remember most people being okay with Peter Jackson as the director. The general opinion seemed to be that a lesser known director (who reportedly loved the books & was looking to do a passion project) would be better than a big name just trying to make a blockbuster. But really, no one seemed to care because we were finally getting a LOTR movie. I thought the casting was perfect, with the exception of Elijah Wood as Frodo (Which I still think was a gigantic mistake to this day). Seeing pictures of the actors in costume basically confirmed my mental images of the characters. The posters & screen caps drew me right into Middle Earth. It was like the book was coming to life.  The, Fellowship finally released. I remember being extremely excited during the opening scenes, seeing the Shire come alive in front of me. I was completely drawn-in by the imagery. I remember watching the scene where the hobbits are hiding off the side of the road from a Black Rider, and thinking ""They have nailed this. I can't believe it."" I left the theater already hyped for the next one. The same hype was still there for second movie, but I feel like it had died off by the third. There were die-hard fans for all three movies, but the hype train definitely lost steam by the third movie. I think it is for the reasons /u/DividingPrescott said - The movies were more style than substance & people had picked up on this.  I loved the Fellowship at the time. I enjoyed Two Towers when it came out. I had some bones to pick with Return of the King. Now, I really don't care for the movies at all. I watched the Hobbit & found it ok. I drunkenly picked apart the second one when I saw it, and I have yet to be convinced the third is worth my time. The old Rankin-Bass cartoon still stands, to me, as the best screen adaption of Tolkien's world."

You see it now with Star Wars VII, the internet goes nuts every time a new trailer comes out.

I remember going to different websites to see what the casting was (Sean Bean as Boromir?  heck yes!)  Since not many people I knew were fans of the books (I only knew one or two) the only hype train I knew of were in the online communities that existed (and as much as the young people of Reddit think otherwise, there were big thriving online communities back in 2000-2001).  I remember taking a school field trip to see Spy Kids in the theater for those that got good grades, and saw the first trailer for Fellowship.  I also remember my brother going off to college in fall 2002, finally with access to broadband, and downloaded the Two Towers trailer, put it on a CD and gave it to me.  I still have that trailer saved on my computer.  It was awesome.  I admit I was impressed with surfing Legolas (although the trailer just made it out that he was sliding down the stairs on his feet, with no shield, so that was disappointing).  There was definitely a bit of hype.  But it wasn't as big as the SW prequels were.  The hype for all three was freaking huge."

I was nine when the Fellowship came out, and my mom, dad and brother (11 at the time) went to see it. They came back with amazing  stories about it so I wanted to see it sooooo bad... but I wasn't allowed (too violent). I found an old translation of the Hobbit in our local library (recognized the word 'Hobbit' so I brought it home) and my mom was very surprised that I loved it so much, because she read it when she were a teen and never liked it. I had to wait for my birthdays (10, 11 & 12) to get all the books (books are expensive here). The wait for the third book was so long that I tried to read it in English (god it was way too hard for 11-year-old me). Still wasn't allowed to watch the movies because they were too violent (which was frustrating!).   When I was 11 we got the Fellowship on video and I fucking. loved. it. Holy shit. It was all I could think about for a long time. I think it might be the only thing that completely lived up to the hype for me (even though they cut out Tom Bombadil, I kept waiting for that part). I wasn't allowed to watch the next parts until I turned 12 so by that time I had read all the books and learned a lot of the poems by heart and even wrote them in my friends poetry albums. I remember being shouted at to 'shut up' when we watched Towers because I was complaining so much about what they all changed from the book haha, but I still loved it (so much violence though, those ringwraiths were scary). Got my grandma on it too. We went to all the live versions (with live music) together and she still sends me quotes from the books.  The movies are such a part of my childhood. Hated the Hobbit movies, those felt like those 'part 2 Disney movies' like Mulan 2 or the little Mermaid 2, which had a lot of the elements of the first parts but none of what made it good."

They were trying to connect The Hobbit to LotR, but apparently ignored the fact that Aragorn not only would be 10 years old at the time, but also have no knowledge of his true heritage or taken on the identity of Strider.

We know Gandalf still visited Minas Tirith between Bilbo's birthday and Frodo leaving the Shire, and that such a trip would have taken months (Gandalf was clearly not riding Shadowfax yet, so no super horse). Bilbo's birth date was either changed to much earlier in the year to allow Frodo to set out at the correct time, or else his departure date is changed. If they skipped a year or even just 6 months, that still leaves us with timeline issues because Aragorn states that he's 87 in TTT (in the corresponding section of the book he was 88). He would have been closer to 26 during The Hobbit in that case in order to make up for the (much shorter) intervening time.  All this is pretty irrelevant to the real point though, which is that they obviously did not stick to the text in this case. And that is the sense in which I meant it was an error. Perhaps it was an inaccurate word choice."

But then in Battle of the Five Armies is the first time the gap, or lack of a gap, is mentioned. What pisses me off about it is it didn't even need to be mentioned. It was a final fuck you to the audience.

A cup of salt is not equal to a cup of sugar, for example. And it's uniform. I don't have a massive amount of American recipes. If I were to buy the typical measuring stuff you guys would use, which one should I buy? An American cup is smaller than a UK cup. I also like to cook simple Japanese food every now and then. They use cups as well. And their cups are different again.  I can't even use a table or tea spoon because we don't use them for measurement and are not the same size. They're usually smaller than the measurement tools because people prefer slimmer spoons these days.  Of course, it's not a problem with water. If I have to measure stuff like 1/4 US cups water, I just put it on a scale and get 60g of water because 1ml of water weights 1g.  But the nuts in this recipe? Of the sticky honey? Fuck that.

The recipes are written how it works, so it doesn't matter that volumes are different with various substances, just the ratio. One cup flour and one tablespoon of baking powder is essentially the same as two cups of flour and two tablespoons of baking soda, you'll just get more in the end.

lotr,33yfaa,suchamazewow,15,Sun Apr 26 20:46:48 2015 UTC,"The problem with trying to find an answer to your first question outside of the movies (which is, I assume, what you want, since you say the movie doesn't answer them) is that the whole situation is invented by the movies and really makes pissall for sense from the perspective of the books.  The answer to the second is a resounding 'no'. Galadriel's own powers reflect quite strongly the powers of the Maia Melian, who Galadriel was quite close with during most of the War of the Jewels. For several hundred years Galadriel 'abode with Melian, and of her learned great lore and wisdom concerning Middle-earth'."
lotr,33yfaa,Uluithiad,3,Sun Apr 26 21:44:57 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, I figured the movie might be taking great liberties. Thanks for explaining that much.  Would it make any sense at all that Galadriel would be so incapacitated by the mere presense of the Nazgûl? Or is it completely just a fabrication for the movie plot?  There is this fascinating book cover from 1995 for a role-playing game that has a depiction on the cover that almost looks like it could have inspired the movie scene:  http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dol_Guldur_%28book%29  They are all there, that appears to be Galadriel and the Nazgul floating in the background?   Was it invented out of whole cloth or do the books somewhat describe the scene?"
lotr,33yfaa,Uluithiad,4,Mon Apr 27 08:27:15 2015 UTC,"Whole cloth. There shouldn't even be any confrontation between the White Council and any heavy-hitters from Sauron's side at Dol Guldur. The Nazgul were in Mordor at the time, prepping it for Sauron's arrival, and Sauron himself had left Dol Guldur in anticipation of Galadriel and the rest arriving.  MERP isn't exactly a good source of lore. They were making a role-playing game, and so they had to make up stuff to generate material. Sometimes that's forgivable, and sometimes it isn't, but it's never helpful to the lore. And they must have been completely off the reservation with that one; they claimed Dol Guldur was a cinder cone."
lotr,33yfaa,DividingPrescott,4,Mon Apr 27 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"The Nazgul feared elvish power. In the books, when Frodo, Sam, and Pippin (Marry joins later) leave the Hobbiton, they are followed by the black riders. When one is doing the ""sniffing"" thing, a group of elves passing through can be heard singing, which scares the Nazgul off.   The Nazgul's main power is that they can cause a supernatural aura of fear to demoralize those around them. Galadriel is one of the most powerful beings in middle earth. Since they never had a showdown in the books, Its hard to say how it would have effected her. But, I will put this quote from the fellowship from Gandalf, to give you an idea of what someone of such power experiences when dealing with them...    'I galloped to Weathertop like a gale, and I reached it before sundown on my second day from Bree-and they were there before me. They drew away from me, for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it while the Sun was in the sky. But they closed round at night, and I was besieged on the hill-top, in the old ring of Amon Sûl. I was hard put to it indeed: such light and flame cannot have been seen on Weathertop since the war-beacons of old. `At sunrise I escaped and fled towards the north. I could not hope to do more. It was impossible to find you, Frodo, in the wilderness, and it would have been folly to try with all the Nine at my heels. So I had to trust to Aragorn. But I hoped to draw some of them off, and yet reach Rivendell ahead of you and send out help. Four Riders did indeed follow me, but they turned back after a while and made for the Ford, it seems. That helped a little, for there were only five, not nine, when your camp was attacked.   This doesn't go into any sort of great detail, but we can gather that Gandalf found them to be a challenge while the sun was down. Its hard to compare Gandalf to Galadriel, and we're dealing with all sorts of hypotheticals. What I will say, is that the White Council all together should have had no problem dealing with the 9 as a team."

Eregion and Moria were close allies in the 2nd Age, and that particular entrance to Moria would have been primarily used for travel to and from the elvish lands. The elves and dwarves worked together to create that entrance to Moria, which is why the carvings and password are in elvish and why the Star of the (elvish) House of Feanor is on the door alongside the emblem of Durin."

I can't remember if the Watcher in the lake was a defensive feature too, but as /u/Ebneter reminded me; the lake wasn't there when the door was built, which makes sense because a shadow was cast over Moria long ago and the terrain became more treacherous for mortals, it's a neat little metaphor but Tolkien was not a fan of metaphors ironically."

lotr,33v0fd,Nan0min,12,Sat Apr 25 22:02:30 2015 UTC,"Thought I'd link to this illustration of the Ainulindale as I think it's a brilliant attempt to visualise the chapter.    It's a very dense chapter in a lot of ways, the images it conveys are I think deliberately outside of the way we can truly understand it. It should of course be remembered that this is sort of written as an attempt by the Elves to record the history of Arda, and therefore it essentially crystalises that. What the Ainur did in their song is far beyond our understanding, and so we end up with a retelling that relies on the idea of singing shaping the world, when perhaps singing was merely the only way the Elves could make sense of the shaping of Arda. The idea of song certainly occurs often in the Silmarillion, the supposed death of Tuor is written as him no longer coming into 'any tale or song.' The Battle of Unnumbered Tears is named as such as 'no song can contain all it's grief' and I think that the Elves may have taken this idea of song being the way they tell tales and compared it to the shaping of Arda.  Figured I'd add a favourite quote from the chapter which is ""Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined."" I think this is an important idea both for the Silmarillion and LOTR, that essentially all the toil and trouble created by Melkor, and in LOTR Sauron, ultimately forms part of the beauty that Eru desires from the world. For instance the evil which Sauron creates leads to Men taking control of the world and making it theirs, that without Sauron the Return of the King would not be necessary and Men would remain perhaps disparate and weak.  Looking forward to this, Sil has been my favourite of the books since I've read it and it's a book with a lot of potential interpretations."
lotr,33v0fd,ajgmcc,3,Sun Apr 26 00:51:59 2015 UTC,"...this illustration....         It certainly has appeal, and props to the artist, but I don't really think that this could or should be attempted; for one, before the creation of Arda, Ea was mostly void (even the here mentioned ""in the midst of the innumerable stars"" is an ""Elvish interpretation"" or tale, given that Varda had not yet begun creating the stars) and the Ainur had not taken any shape, so there isn't much that we could imagine or visualize of that time and secondly attempts to visualize it make the whole less mythical, robbing it of its grandeur and magic in a way. (same would go for the Silmarils, Telperion and Laurelin, for example)      ...I think that the Elves may have taken this idea of song being the way they tell tales and compared it to the shaping of Arda.      Not just that. Given that the ""magic"" in Arda is the power of creation or manipulation (Eru being able to create the world and beings who are able to create themselves, the Ainur being able to create and shape matter and create life-forms on their own, Elves being able to crate and shape less, and so on) and art essentially is creation, I'd say that song is a form of magic. Don't forget that Finrod battles Sauron in song and Luthien's singing also has ""magical"" properties. So, whilst the music of the Ainur may be unimaginable and incomprehensible, I'd say it is still ""a music"" of a kind.       ...I think this is an important idea...       Which therefore is condensed and phrased in more modern English in the summary :-) This strife is indeed necessary and out of it indeed more beauty arises (even the ""foiling"" of the perfect symmetry of the world makes it more beautiful and exciting.)      For instance the evil which Sauron creates leads to Men taking control of the world and making it theirs....        Can't quite agree here, tough.  The Firstborn would have faded eventually, so unless Mankind was extinct, it would have taken over.   EDIT: sorry if I'm sounding criticizing, I'm glad you've joined and are contriguting to the conversation!  EDIT 2: About the whole art=magic thing, I'll quote Tolkien himself (who had written this in a letter to Milton Waldman in 1951, which is in the Preface of some Silmarillion editions):   ""Their 'magic' is Art, delivered from many of its human limitations: more effortless, more quick, more complete (product, and vision in unflawed correspondence). And its object is Art not Power, subcreation not domination and tyrannous reforming of Creation. """

lotr,33v0fd,PrivateChicken,2,Sat Apr 25 22:28:11 2015 UTC,"Great question! My take: In eternal bliss there can be no growth and without strife there cannot be heroism and beauty can only be distinguished as such when its lack is known. There has to be conflict of some sort, else everything would be stasis.     I think that Tolkien had something similar in mind when writing (To Milton  Waldman in 1951 (same letter I had already quoted)) that       ""There cannot be any 'story' without a fall - all stories are ultimately about the fall - at least not for human minds as we know them and have them.""           For the story of the world to unfold, this fall, or rebellion was necessary. And therefore, as Eru said, it only contributes to the glory of Creation."

Essentially the Ainur had a choice between remaining as spirits or coming down to Arda, Manwe calls them down to reside in Arda to help fight Melkor. It can probably be assumed that this includes Olorin (later Gandalf), Curumo (later Saruman) and Mairon (later Sauron) amongst others as these were some of the most powerful or wise Maiar."

lotr,33v0fd,HBot106,3,Sun Apr 26 14:29:32 2015 UTC,"Philosophical observation:  We see in this first part that Melkor, in a desire for power and worship and for his own ideas to take hold over Iluvatars, creates his own heavy metal guitar shredding solo over the song of unison that the Ainur play. This seems fairly parallel with the christian concept of the Fall of Lucifer. This creates problems for me, from a very base level of what it means to be good or evil.  Iluvitar created Melkor, and in doing so, gave Melkor the ability to create his music, straying from the intended theme was granted to him by God himself. Doesn't this mean that Iluvitar, not Melkor, introduce evil into the world? It is stated that none of the Ainur could see Iluvitar's end goal, and that only Iluvitar could see all ends. Wouldn't this mean that Iluvitar created Melkor with the intention of having him Fall, as all parts of the song, even those that Melkor corrupted, were part of Iluvitars plan? This creates a dilema for me. It's hard to point at Melkor and blame him for his crimes, when he was created in this exact way per the designs of Iluvitar, who, as far as I can gather, is supposed to be the Melkors opposite, a being of sheer good. However, it seems that his actions would make him more of a Neutral entity, seeing as he created both good and evil.  One could argue t hat Melkor made the choice to disobay, and to turn to his selfish desires, but to that I'd say, even if Melkor had a choice, wouldn't Iluvitar know Melkor's choice before he ever made it. Wouldn't Iluvitar know of Melkor's fall before Melkor existed? So why, in the end, should Melkor be punished for following the path that Iluvitar had knowingly set before him? Isn't it evil to create something, knowing before hand of its failure and faults, and then punish it for doing exactly what you knew it would?"
lotr,33v0fd,DividingPrescott,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:37:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for contributing! Glad to see an engaged reader! Here's my take on things;      Melkor, in a desire for power and worship....   His desire initially is to create himself something on/of his own, that is outside of Iluvatar. This ambition leads him to stray, and when he realises that he cannot be a creator himself he seeks the next-best-thing, so to say, which is domination of the creation, and its perversion out of spite. So initially he wanted not the glory in the form of reign, but a creator's glory, therefore I see quite a significant difference to Lucifer.      ...was granted to him by God himself. Doesn't this mean that Iluvitar, not Melkor, introduce evil into the world?   It was certainly known to Eru that it would come to this; this character was the nature he gave Melkor (the name meaning ""he who arises in power/might"") and Eru himself told the Ainur that no music can be made that does not come -in its core- from Iluvatar himself (and that the ""evil"" will only contribute to the glory of Creation). Yet I would not say that he introduced it. He laid the foundations, yes, but he gave the Ainur free wills. (It is at least quite reasonable to assume this, given that else Dwarves would not have been created)      and that only Iluvitar could see all ends.      From what I remember he knows his own plans and how everything will come to an end, but I don't think it is anywhere stated that he is omniscient and I don't think that the universe he created is a fatalistic one ( which I consider reasonable to assume, given that else Man would be unable to shape their fate, despite this ""ability"" being a gift to them).  Sure, he could know everything he wished to, but I don't think that he knew everything from the beginning. (though, granted, I'm speculating a bit here)       Wouldn't this mean that Iluvitar created Melkor with the intention of having him Fall, as all parts of the song, even those that Melkor corrupted, were part of Iluvitars plan?   Absolutely! He even hinted at that in the speech he made that the Ainur did not yet understand. But still, I don't think that the type and amount of corruption was planned.      It's hard to point at Melkor and blame him for his crimes, when he was created in this exact way per the designs....      Absolutely! Though I would have to add that he had a free will. But I think that ""hateful"" might be a better description for him that ""evil"" per se.      ....Iluvitar, who, as far as I can gather, is supposed to be the Melkors opposite...      All Ainur are created from the mind of Eru and therefore they are part of him, in a way.  And he is not ""all-loving"" or ""all good"" or holier-than-thou; the darkness of Melkor is part of him as well; Melkor is only a subset of him. (which is theologically far more elegant and not to mention far more logical than Christian myth) And I do quite enjoy that, given that there is no claim of him being perfect(ly moral) and yet he's -unlike the Judeo-Christian and Muslim God- not a vengeful, anger-filled, madman and tyrant.         wouldn't Iluvitar know Melkor's choice before he ever made it...      I don't know. I don't believe it, to be honest, but I don't think that the answer can be found in the Silmarillion.      So why, in the end, should Melkor be punished...      The second time that he is being ""locked away"" isn't punishment, really, it is to protect the Creation from him, the way I see it. And keep in mind, that he is not sentenced by Eru, but by Manwe, who thinks that he is doing Iluvatar's will."

lotr,33v0fd,PenthusLuctus,2,Sun Apr 26 18:54:02 2015 UTC,"After countless read throughs of the hobbit and and back-to-back readt throughs of LOTR, I finally cracked open the Silmarillion last night for the first time. I'm only reading the the Intro so far. One thing i've noticed is how self depreciating tolkien always seems to be about his work when talking to others about it. It's like he's embarrassed by what he's created, referring to his work frequently as some sort of silly thing. I hate that he does that, but i guess at that time, it might have been somewhat absurd as Fantasy wasn't ""mainstream"" like it is today.  One passage really interested me, but I struggled to really comprehend it in its entirety. I was hoping someone with slightly better reading comprehension could help explain this. This is from a letter in the intro about the 2nd Edition of the Silmarillion.   Anyway all this stuff is mainly concerned with Fall, Mortality, and the Machine. With Fall inevitably, and that motive occurs in several modes. With Mortality, especially as it affects art and the creative (or as I should say, sub-creative) desire which seems to have no biological function, and to be apart from the satisfactions of plain ordinary biological life, with which, in our world, it is indeed usually at strife. This desire is at once wedded to a passionate love of the real primary world, and hence filled with the sense of mortality, and yet unsatisfied by it. It has various opportunities of 'Fall'. It may become possessive, clinging to the things made as 'its own', the sub-creator wishes to be the Lord and God of his private creation. He will rebel against the laws of the Creator – especially against mortality. Both of these (alone or together) will lead to the desire for Power, for making the will more quickly effective, – and so to the Machine (or Magic). By the last I intend all use of external plans or devices (apparatus) instead of development of the inherent inner powers or talents — or even the use of these talents with the corrupted motive of dominating: bulldozing the real world, or coercing other wills. The Machine is our more obvious modern form though more closely related to Magic than is usually recognised.    Since, so far, Tolkien has spoken more about the Fall of the elves than the Fall of men, I fail to see how Mortality binds to this... except that the elves experience the mortality of middle earth around them while men experience mortality first hand. Can someone help explain what tolkien's conveying here? maybe ELI5?  I will admit, I am dyslexic and have a learning disability so sometimes I struggle. I honestly reread this 5 times last night thinking he was saying the themes were Fall, Morality, and the Machine... only to have to edit my post here when the stupid word finally clicked straight in my brain as mortality... which makes the reference to biology actually make some sense. Though the entire passage is still not crystal clear to me.   Thanks!  Edit: Only a few pages in and I'm blown away by the depth and how cool his world is. The concepts he's talked about with elves and men and their experience of death in different ways, and how they're bound differently to this world is so cool and chilling."
lotr,33v0fd,DividingPrescott,2,Mon Apr 27 13:18:12 2015 UTC,"It's like he's embarrassed...      I think it might have to do with modesty and what he is attempting; the creation of a mythology. Not a novel, not a story, but a whole myth (and several languages of course) which is a grand undertaking.      One passage really interested me, but I struggled to really comprehend it in its entirety.      I'm assuming that you've used the bold part to highlight what you had trouble with so I'll focus on that, though I cannot guarantee you ""truth"".     Now, what he is speaking of is that art and creation, (which are not necessary biologically or even for being content) are separating us from nature and the natural state: that they are in a way making us fight against the natural world. And the reason for this he sees in our mortality; it fuels art and creation, maybe as a ""rebellion"" against our fading. In the case of the Elves it might be the mortality of the world around them (at least outside of Aman) and the love for the world that causes this rebellion of preservation; not of oneself or ones kind as with humans, but of the world. He adds that most of our art is inspired by nature, that it is filled with love for it, and therefore feels ""mortal"" as well,. Yet despite this love for nature, in art we are not content by simply having a sense of it and are striving for more; stringing to ""transcend"".   Since, so far, Tolkien has spoken more about the Fall of the elves than the Fall of men...      The word ""fall"" is a bit tricky, here, because here he is speaking in philosophical terms as well and the Fall can be that of an individual. What you mean most likely is the Fall of Feanor and the Noldor, but those are only a part of the Elves. In the second edition there is the ""Akallabeth"", which describes the Fall of the Numenoreans, who are human.     In the letter he is speaking broadly and philosophically, not just about the plot. And he also speaks of different types of this fall, making reference to Feanor (It may become possessive, clinging to the things made as 'its own') and Melkor(the sub-creator wishes to be the Lord and God of his private creation). There will be others; some will fall because of pride, for example.      Hope I was able to help, and if not, I'll try again, and again and fail better until I get there!  Really glad that you've had such a response! And thank you for contributing! It is one of my favorite aspects as well; especially given that it describes death as a gift; as freedom, which is quite an existentialist viewpoint. Cursed to be free, as Camus would say."
lotr,33v0fd,PenthusLuctus,2,Mon Apr 27 20:44:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for spelling this out for me. I appreciate it. That does seem to fit with what the professor was trying to say, so I think it's probably a fairly accurate interpretation.   I have one followup question on the FALL. In his letters he mentions that this book will not contain the first fall of Man, that it doesn't enter this story. He says that the fall of Numenor was the second fall of men. I'm just wonder if you can shed any light on what the first fall of man was. Is that what the story of the children of hurin is?"
lotr,33v0fd,DividingPrescott,2,Tue Apr 28 12:32:11 2015 UTC,"Nothing to thank me for!     Though one. The story of the Children of Hurin is the story of his daughter and son, Hurin is not a ""father to a race"" as are the fathers of the Dwarves. But given that in the passage he says that it was before the first meeting of Elves and Man. I assume it might have to do with humans having been under the influence or dominion of Melkor and some ""repenting"" (if I remember correctly that was mentioned in the latter). It is not known when Man awoke, only that they met the Elves ""quite late"". And those who met them were migrating from the East, maybe to free themselves form (the influence of) Morgoth. They had already created languages and established ""clans"" of sort, so they must have had a longer history than ins described in the Silmarillion."
lotr,33v0fd,PenthusLuctus,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:52:46 2015 UTC,Maybe it's a bit late but Silmarillion contains heavy spoilers for The Children of Húrin. I have not yet read The Children of Húrin but the major parts of his life and that of his children is covered from about chapter 20 (Nirnaeth Arnoediad) and after of The Silmarillion. Not completely sure where in the story Children actually starts.

lotr,33v0fd,WeFightTheBlues,2,Sun Apr 26 02:22:38 2015 UTC,"Not sure if such questions would work well. It would either mean making elaborate theries and asking if the others agree or just a general ""what did you think?"".       I'm quite confident that just by people sharing their impressions or asking the questions they have we'll have discussions, yet how many those are would depend on the number of people involved.     I'm also assuming that our number will grow, as I hope that this read-along will motivate people to read it."

I travelled around NZ solo in the Summer (NZ Winter) of 2014 and it was truly the most wonderful and indescribably time of my life. I tried to visit as many filming locations as I could while I was there. I got to see a fair amount and it was honestly a surreal dream come true; the number of times I was profoundly emotional and legitimately teared up is unbelievable. The movies have had an incredible effect on my life and I love them with all my heart, and I'm sure you will know what I mean and understand what it feels like to visit these places.  I just wanted to say thank you for all your efforts in capturing these spectacular and timeless places in such detail and with such dedication. It transported me back to not only my trip but to the movies (I've actually just finished yet another marathon and what I believe is near my 400th viewing) and I sincerely appreciate your effort, time and work.  I hope there is someway you would be able to geotag or define the GPS co-ordinaries to these locations because I know I and probably countless others would appreciate it. I intend to travel to NZ again within the next 3 years and hopefully take up residence there at some point in my life and having these locations would be truly amazing.  Again I just want to thank you. The movies mean the world to me and the world of the movies is unlike any that ever was or will be and you have helped me travel there and back again and have brought a little more joy to my life.  I wish you all the best in your future endeavours and may Tolkiens world, New Zealand and The Lord of The Rings trilogy bring you endless happiness.

lotr,33uygk,eL_daYa,26,Sat Apr 25 21:45:04 2015 UTC,"Gandalf was Istari and did not properly belong to the mortal lands of Middle-Earth anyhow.  Elrond (by his choice) and Galadriel (by her blood) were Elvenkind and destined to grow weary of Middle-Earth. They long to take the Straight Road1  to the Blessed Realm as time goes on; they do not pass their days forever in Middle-Earth.  The Hobbits Frodo and Bilbo (and later Samwise), although of Mortal kind, by virtue of having borne the One Ring also bore a weariness in their bones. But in Middle-Earth they could find no relief from this. Although the Gift of Men (halflings being of Mankind) might bring them relief upon their death, they were granted a boon to travel to the West and pass their long days in peace until the Gift was granted them.2  1 Since the Bending of the World, the only way to travel to Westernesse was by Elven ships following the Straight Road.  2 It is also told in the Red Book of Westmarch that Gimli son of Glóin travelled to the Undying Lands in the company of his steadfast Elven companion Legolas, and for his love of Galadriel.  *This is from one of the first links you find online."
lotr,33uygk,Cottonbuff,20,Sat Apr 25 22:00:33 2015 UTC,Good answer. But note that Westernesse is the Westron name for Númenor and not Valinor. Westernesse was under the sea at this point.
lotr,33uygk,ToffeeKing,2,Sat Apr 25 22:43:44 2015 UTC,"You'll have to forgive my ignorance, but is the Blessed Realm sort of like Heaven where they get to live eternally or do does who are not from Elvish decent pass away as they would in Middle-Earth also do they Undying Lands reside within the Blessed Realm? Once more sorry for being so dull?"
lotr,33uygk,Willie9,15,Sat Apr 25 22:13:09 2015 UTC,"The Blessed Realm and the Undying Lands refer to the same place, but geographically it is best known as Valinor.  Valinor used to be a regular continent on the world, just like Middle-Earth, but it was special because the Valar (sort-of deities) lived there, and it was a very ""light"" place, peaceful, good, etc. (it should be noted that at this point the world is flat)  Due to the events of the Second Age, the world was changed from a flat world into a sphere. A consequence of this is that Valinor is no longer west of Middle-Earth--instead there are new lands to the west. When the world was curved Valinor stayed in place, so now in order to get there ships must follow the ""Straight Road"" (As opposed to sailing around the curvature of the earth) to get there.  The Undying Lands are called so because immortal beings live there; not because it makes people there immortal. Mortals in Valinor still die, and their souls leave the world like all other mortals."

lotr,33uygk,ungolden_glitter,-31,Sun Apr 26 12:09:51 2015 UTC,"Simple answer is that he is dying from the stab wound he receved on Weathertop. The morgul blade poisoned him and if he stays in middle earth he will die, soon."
lotr,33uygk,BaronVonBallsack,11,Sat Apr 25 22:15:22 2015 UTC,"No. The Elves healed him of that wound. Elrond removed the tip of the blade, though it had very nearly reached Frodo's heart. He suffered what might have been phantom pains each year on the anniversary of his wounding, as well as horrible memories, dreams and hallucinations.    Frodo, and Bilbo for that matter, left Middle Earth because they were psychologically scarred from their time as Ringbearers. The same damage the Ring inflicted on Gollum's mind had also happened to them. Not to the same extent, because Gollum had the Ring for much longer, but if they'd held it for centuries, they would have succumbed as Gollum did.    They went to the Undying Lands simply because they were suffering, and no help could be provided in Middle Earth and the realms of Men."
lotr,33uygk,ungolden_glitter,-3,Sun Apr 26 00:13:17 2015 UTC,If that is true then why did Frodo get deathly ill on each anniversary of his poisoning?
lotr,33uygk,BaronVonBallsack,8,Sun Apr 26 00:41:38 2015 UTC,"If the Ringwraith that stabbed him had hit his heart, or if the broken tip had succeeded in reaching his heart, Frodo would have become a wraith as well. Just not as powerful as the Ringwraiths, and completely under Sauron's power.    The wound could not be wholly cured, so there would be lingering effects that cause him pain. It's not killing him, it's wearing him down, both mentally and physically.    I don't believe it's ever explained why it affects him so much worse on the anniversary, though."
lotr,33tmwo,mycourage,17,Sat Apr 25 14:50:30 2015 UTC,"As interesting a read as this is, I have to disagree. Tolkien STRONGLY disliked allegory. He wouldn't purposely alude to Catholicism in LOTR."

lotr,33tmwo,ToffeeKing,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:39:13 2015 UTC,"Given Tolkien's obsession and life-long study of the Nordic culture and literature, I highly doubt he would so explicitly state a catholic allegory."

You could apply that thinking to nearly every dramatic death scene in any story and come it saying how ""catholic"" it was.   The part about the bread and the Eucharist made me laugh. Aragorn running back to the shore for some bread is a hilarious image and oddly enough sums up how hilarious this in depth look at Boromir's death really is."

lotr,33uzqi,cats_are_pussies,13,Sat Apr 25 21:56:42 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean. To be frank, it's not that Hurin has a dwarvish name but rather that the Dwarves have names in Men's tongue, Westron. Dwarves have secret names in their own language, Khuzdul, that they do not reveal. Names like Thorin, Balin, Dwalin and Gimli (all the Norse or Norse-inspired names) are, as far as I know, supposed to be their ""common"" Westron names that they'd use in public while keeping their true names hidden. Khuzdul is much more reminiscent of some Semitic languages. It's not impossible that names like Hurin and Turin would be connected to Durin and Thorin, though someone more well read may inform me otherwise."
lotr,33uzqi,ToffeeKing,4,Sat Apr 25 22:48:08 2015 UTC,"Not only is Khuzdul vaguely semitic, so is Adûnaic, (and presumably it's Beleriand parent language). Men would have had contact with Dwarves before Elves so it makes sense their languages would influence one another."
lotr,33uzqi,PrivateChicken,3,Sat Apr 25 23:07:19 2015 UTC,"Well, weren't there some elves left in Middle-earth before the Wars of Beleriand? Men could have met both right?"
lotr,33uzqi,russmcruss52,2,Sun Apr 26 01:19:07 2015 UTC,"Possibly. I supposed I should have said that Men would have encountered Khuzdul speaking Dwarves before Sindarin speaking Elves. Mannish speech was merely influenced by Dwarvish, and not descended from it, so that leaves open the question of it's origin.  In the Lhammas, a linguistic essay Tolkien wrote from the perspective of the elf Pengolah, it is supposed that all languages are descended from three of the Valar. My knowledge here is pretty spotty so take this with some caution:   Oromëan, named after Oromë, taught the first Elves to speak. All languages of Elves and most languages of Men are Oromëan. Aulëan, named after Aulë, is the origin of the Khuzdul language. It had some influence on the tongues of Men. Melkian, named after the rebellious Melkor, is the origin in the First Age of the many tongues used by the Orcs and other evil beings. (This tongue is unrelated to the Black Speech of Sauron.)   So we might guess that Men learned an Oromëan tongue from the Avari still present in the east of Middle Earth. I'm not really sure how this stuff reflects Tolkien's later ideas. I've heard that later Tolkien decided that Elvish and Valarin should be unrelated (but I have no source on that). Whatever the case, the basic premise, that the Mannish language of Beor and Hador are descended from some variant of Proto-Quenya and then influenced by Khuzdul via contact with dwarves, still stands."
lotr,33uzqi,PrivateChicken,2,Sun Apr 26 18:12:42 2015 UTC,"That was really well explained, thanks for that! I haven't read the linguistic essay, so that was cool to learn some of that."

lotr,33rbcq,Gilgamesh-,44,Fri Apr 24 21:46:42 2015 UTC,"spoilers, if you have not read the unhappy tale of the Children of Húrin.  The dragon in the painting was named Glaurung (meaning something akin to 'golden-shadow', or 'golden-cloud'), and he was the first dragon - although he was less of a dragon in the traditional Arthurian sense (unlike Smaug, of 'The Hobbit' fame, having no wings (he was closer in form to a Komodo Dragon). He first appeared in the course of the 400-year long Siege of Angband, in Year 260 of the First Age - but his first fight in his full might was during the breaking of that siege, in the Dagor Bragollach the 'Battle of Sudden Flame' (F.A. 455).  It was then here rivers of fire poured from the volcanic mountains of Angband; the forces of Morgoth took possession of the north of Beleriand, and the Noldor were scattered and divided. The year after, Fingolfin, the High King of the Noldor, enraged by the losses they had suffered, rode to the gates of Angband alone, and challenged Morgoth to single combat.  And Morgoth came.  In the battle which followed, though he wounded The Bauglir seven times, the High King was crushed under his foot. He managed to leave a permanent mark on him, however, for as he died he slashed a wound in Morgoth's foot; a wound which never healed. Morgoth walked with a limp ever after.  It was forty years later, in F.A. 495 that Glaurung first met Túrin Turambar son of Húrin, the man in the painting, while leading an army of Orcs against Nargothrond; Túrin , at that time known as the Mormegil, or Blacksword, was the leader of the forces of Nargothrond against Glaurung in the Battle of Tumhalad. But he was defeated entirely, and King Orodreth of Nargothrond was killed, and Nargothrond taken.  As the Orcs the dragon that had followed the dragon took Nargothrond, Túrin entered and attempted to reach the captives, but Glaurung emerged from the doors and put him under the binding spell of his lidless eyes - Túrin could but watch as Glaurung's captives, among them the daughter of Orodreth whom he loved, Finduilas, were led away to Angband. Glaurung was known as 'the Deciever', and Turin would have done well to heed that, for in speaking to Túrin Glaurung convinced him not to go after Finduilas but to save his mother Morwen and sister Niënor, saying that they were living as thralls in Dor-lómin, in misery and want - when in truth they had before fled to Doriath, the land ruled by Thingol and Melian, the Maia.  So Túrin in searching found not his mother and sister, and, returning, found only the grave of Finduilas - for it was Glaurung's deceit that lead to Finduilas' death, pinned to a tree by a spear by the Orcs who had captured her, ere she was saved by those assaulting them - and her dying words were ""Tell the Mormegil that Finduilas is here"".  Morwen and Niënor had gone to Nargothrond to attempt to find out what had befallen Túrin, but they and their escorts, among them the elf Mablung, were scattered by Glaurung, who found Niënor, and made her forget all of her former life with that same binding spell of his eyes, and flee into the wilderness, meeting Túrin as she ran.  Now Túrin and Niënor had not met for many years, so then in meeting, neither knew who the other was, and, falling in love, they were married. At that time, lacking her own name, Túrin named Niënor Níniel, Maid of Tears. When Glaurung was finally killed by Túrin Turambar, in dying, the dragon named Túrin her brother. She thought Túrin dead, for he had fallen into a deep sleep (something shown in the painting linked) and, realising their true identities, leapt of the edge of the gorge of Cabed-en-Aras.  Now Túrin did not believe the word of those that told him that Níniel was the daughter of Húrin, even slaying one; but when the elf Mablung told him of what had happened, he returned to Cabed-en-Aras. There he spoke to his sword, Gurthang, Iron of Death, asking it to slay him - and it answered. ""Yea, I will drink thy blood gladly."", and did, breaking under him."

lotr,33vsow,fileg,-6,Sun Apr 26 03:51:23 2015 UTC,"My point was not exactly about the rhythm of the whole thing, but actually that the main plot (and I'm beginning to wonder if there's one main plot) isn't the most important thing of the book."
lotr,33vsow,ebneter,7,Sun Apr 26 04:06:28 2015 UTC,"There is a main plot, but you're right: It's not the most important thing in the book."
lotr,33vsow,sakor88,5,Sun Apr 26 04:21:34 2015 UTC,Perhaps the main plot is not what you think it is...

lotr,33vsow,Tolkienite,2,Mon Apr 27 01:48:44 2015 UTC,I have read LotR many many times. I'm not sure I would have if the plot was the most important thing (to me).
lotr,33vsow,ebneter,5,Sun Apr 26 06:00:01 2015 UTC,"Not to discount an opinion or offer evidence as a means of pigeonholing Tolkien, but remember this;  Two of Tolkien's three best friends died in WWI, when all involved were in their early twenties. The man must have watched hundreds of people die pretty uselessly. Hence, he is not keen to go into gruesome detail about the ebb and flow of battle or the manner in which an Orc gets killed.   This, in my opinion, partly explains why he wrote the way he did."
lotr,33vsow,ebneter,3,Sun Apr 26 06:30:46 2015 UTC,"Well, this is an interesting point of view. Actually, maybe it's a reason for his major interests in world-building instead of the action-adventure plot."
lotr,33vsow,ebneter,4,Mon Apr 27 01:45:39 2015 UTC,"You haven't seen the films?  It's important to remember that The Lord of the Rings is not an action-adventure novel. It's kind of hard to describe what it is, but it's definitely not that."
lotr,33vsow,ItsMeTK,-3,Sun Apr 26 04:01:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed. For example, I read The Hobbit when I was younger and I really enjoyed it. And this book is much more focused in a ""single adventure"". Perhaps LoTR just is not for me, though.  (And I have seen the films, but it was a long time ago, and I don't remember all the details!)"

lotr,33vsow,SeeShark,3,Sun Apr 26 04:36:09 2015 UTC,"I think so; I find new things in it every time I re-read it, and I've probably read it all the way though 15 times or more."
lotr,33vsow,Bananafrosted,3,Sun Apr 26 04:42:03 2015 UTC,"The Battle of Helm's Deep has actually very little to do with the main plot. One chapter is just right for it. I'll grant you the Tom Bombadil stuff, but everybody knows that. It's more about taking time on the journey to Rivendell (and to give Gandalf time to do everything he has to do in between).   Nestled within those chapters though are moments of thematic importance and foreshadowing that will pay off way later."
lotr,33vsow,sakor88,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"I hope so! And I haven't thought about this ""timing aspect"", this is a good point!   About the battle, actually I think this battle deserved more proeminence, cause it's one side of the whole war! (good guys v.s. Saruman) Unless it's not finalized yet (I'm in the middle of the saga, after all), one chapter really seemed a little short for me..."

lotr,33sjea,CaptainSioulserrot,2,Sat May 2 17:38:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's quite nice, but the reason behind the name I chose is that it has two little crescent moons on each side of the blade. It's the traditional mark which the blacksmiths put on each of their blades as a ""copy"" of the first European blade they saw, during the medieval crusades. Many believe those marks denoted that these blades originally came from a German blacksmith.  Plus, the tribe it comes from is Muslim, so it's only fitting that I name the sword after one of their most important symbols.  TL;DR: I love researching sword history.

While swords may carry meaning and significance even away from battle, like Narsil being reforged for the heir of Isildur, a weapon is first and foremost a tool for harming and killing others and something you don't want to use unless absolutely necessary.

I get that this is a fun little illustration, but to me it just come across as the illustrator completely missing the point of sam, which throws the whole thing off. If he had mary or pippin be silly, maybe. But sam's personality isn't only central to his character but really to the plot of the whole thing. The whole frodo-sam dynamic works because sam turns out not to be some silly oaf."
lotr,33ljaw,jrlovejr92,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:36:11 2015 UTC,"Neither Merry nor Pippin are very silly characters (except occasionally when in contrast to men). Sam is continually shown to be overly-rustic and ignorant of proper manners throughout the book even by Hobbit standards, so he's a much sillier character than either of them (albeit with a heart of gold).  And yes, this picture is based on the books. Aragorn is clearly depicted carrying Andúril while in the company of Gandalf the Grey.

It doesn't have illustrations but it has very detailed, useful maps of different areas as the characters travel to them. It's really great if, like me, you struggle to visualise what's going on with the landscape/layout. To give an example, THIS is the depiction of the prancing pony, the page before shows Tom's house relative to the Barrow Downs, the page after shows Weathertop and Rivendell. I really can't recommend it highly enough.  It sounds like you're more interested in an artist's interpretation of different scenes, in which case I know that Alan Lee's Lord of the Rings Sketchbook is in roughly chronological order. I'd recommend having a look at the preview section on Amazon here first though to decide whether it's the sort of thing you're looking for."

In Sindarin it is ""Law pain i reviar mistar aen"" for which this is a decent rendering although I think the first diphthong could be using Úrë (looks like a lower-case o) instead of Vala.

The only changes that the rings had on the wielders who were susceptible to its corruption was to transform them into wraiths... so they would not look like anything as they'd be invisible.    While you might look at gollum and attribute his to the 1 ring, it's more likely that gollum was unrecognizable as a hobbit because of 500 years of living in an underground pond. The book doesn't really imply that he was ""transformed"" or ""mutated"" by the ring, and if he had been, it would have been to become a wraith, and not some sort of mutant corrupt thing that we see in the jackson films. Remember, The ring didn't so much change the wielder. It actually did the opposite. It preserved the wielder, stretching out their life. Other than invisibility, the wielder would actually change less than if they didn't have the ring!  Gollum as described in the book is gangrel, wild, slimy, emaciated, and black skinned. None of these are necessarily the effect of the One, but rather what happens when you live naked in the wild eating raw animals for eons. The blacked skin is the one thing I shrug at, but we don't know that his black skin was necessarily an unnatural tone."

Sorry for not documenting the edit changes :-/  I do see your and /u/PrivateChicken 's point.   I am acting under the assumption/understanding that the ring's ability to turn the wielder invisible is also tied to it's ability to make one a shadow or wraith. Since invisibility, as I understand it, is not simply turning invisible, but rather stepping into the spirit/shadow realm, they seem tied together. Since the dwarf's rings didn't effect them so, I'm assuming the One's power would be neutered in the same way.  I acknowledge that's an assumption, and you know what happens when you make an assumption. You make an ass out of ""You"" and ""Mption""."

The seven did not enthrall the dwarves to Sauron's will as he had hoped, but the seven most certainly affected the dwarves. There's not many (if any) direct quotes regarding the dwarven relationship to the One, that I'm aware of, but it would be safe to assume that it affects dwarves in much the same manner as it affects Men and Hobbits. They would still turn invisible, have their lifespans stretched, and would still have their minds filled with the Ring's deceptions."
lotr,33lthv,PrivateChicken,2,Thu Apr 23 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with that. The 7 and the 9 were the same rings, they were just dealt out differently. The dwarves were not turned invisibile by these, nor were they turned into wraiths, while men were. One could argue dwarves were corrupted with greed, though I believe that is only speculation in and out of universe (please provide a quote if i'm wrong; though i'll state i personally believe the rings did corrupt the minds of dwarves, i just don't think its a hard fact). However, there is nothing to state that the dwarves were physically altered or preserved by this.   The reason dwarves are effected differently than Men and Hobbits is because of their creation story. They aren't able to be dominated in the same way the other free people are."
lotr,33lthv,DividingPrescott,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not aware of any quote or clause saying that Dwarves were not turned invisible. I don't know why you would suppose the One Ring would not do this. There's also no definitive evidence to say that the lesser rings did not grant invisibility. If the nine grant invisibility, and as you say the seven should be considered the same sort of rings as the nine. Then it follows that the seven too would turn the owner invisible when worn. The fact that the dwarves were not enslaved as the Nazgul were does not contradict this.  You're likely correct in in thinking that the Dwarves' unique origins likely contributed to their mental hardiness. All the lesser rings of power were designed to ensnare Elves originally. Dwarves are very unlike Elves so the rings didn't function as intended entirely. Men are closer, so it worked better then.  Frodo and Bilbo also proved resistant to the Ring, but this did not nullify the Ring's other effects. Gandalf's description of the rings of power and their effects on lifespan, applies to mortals. Dwarves, while long lived, are mortal. I see no reason not to presume the one Ring would have stretched and faded Dwarves as well.  Another point to consider is that the One Ring is far more potent than any of the lesser. I find it unlikely that dwarfish resistance to the lesser would translate to immunity to the One Ring. If that were the case then why was Gimli not the Ring Bearer? Or you arguing that a Dwarf like Gimli, would be susceptible to the mental dangers of the One Ring while immune to the physical effects? That seems a shaky conclusion because your earlier argument rested on the premise that the Dwarves were immune to the mental effects of the lesser rings. (A premise I agree with, I just don't extend it to the physical effects, and certainly not to the physical effects of the One Ring.)"
lotr,33lthv,PrivateChicken,3,Thu Apr 23 18:45:00 2015 UTC,"I'll admit, my interpretation could be way off. This is from Durin's folk, and is partially where I drew my conclusion from:   None the less it may well be, as the Dwarves now believe, that Sauron by his arts had discovered who had this Ring, the last to remain free, and that the singular misfortunes of the heirs of Durin were largely due to his malice. For the Dwarves had proved untameable by this means (I interpret this as mental domination, in the way the 9 Wraiths were enslaved to Sauron's will and command). The only power over them that the Rings wielded was to inflame their hearts with a greed of gold and precious things, so that if they lacked them all other good things seemed profitless, and they were filled with wrath and desire for vengeance on all who deprived them (I interpreted this that the ONLY effect these rings had on the dwarves was to give them insatiable gold lust) . But they were made from their beginning of a kind to resist most steadfastly any domination . Though they could be slain or broken, they could not be reduced to shadows enslaved to another will; and for the same reason their lives were not affected by any Ring, to live either longer or shorter because of it (This would be, IMHO, proof that they would not have been invisible, life extended, or made a wraith by ""any Ring"", including the One ring). All the more did Sauron hate the possessors and desire to dispossess them."

That's taken from the closing section of the Silmarillion correct? I'll have to check when I get back from work. As always with the Sil though, you have to be careful. Any particular passage is of dubious authority; one must compare with the most recent and complete drafts in HoME to see what Tolkien's thoughts on the matter were, and when those thoughts were. Actually in this case I would also examine drafts of A Shadow of the Past to see where the potential inconsistency developed. You'd think Gandalf, of all people, would have known about this exception.  I would concede, that the effects of the Seven are much more unclear than the One. However, I would still consider invisibility on the table. Invisibility was only an effect that occurs when the owner placed a ring on their finger, and has little to do with will."

lotr,33lthv,PrivateChicken,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"Also, I wouldn't put all my faith in Gandalf to judge on these matters. He waited so long before determining that Bilbo's ring was the Master ring. He says in shadow of the past he knew from the start that bilbo clearly had one of the Great Rings of Power. He  says he did not know which one. The 9 he knew the fate of, as well as the 3. This means he could have only believed it to be one of the 7. Yet Gandalf knew that Thror had the last ring, and that it was taken by force from him over a hundred years ago, when Gandalf found the Key and the Map to erebor. I have always believed that Gandalf had basically not drawn conclusions correctly... and it would either be because he did not want to accept the truth (not within his character), or because he had been manipulated into believing it could not be the One ring through the voice of Saruman (the only thing I can think of to fill Gandalf's gaps in jumping to the correct conclusion)."
lotr,33lthv,DividingPrescott,2,Thu Apr 23 19:47:56 2015 UTC,"See, the problem there is Gandalf is basically the primary authority when it comes to the Durin's folk. The knowledge that comes to the reader about anything is done so through the frame that it was set down in a document that the author is now translating. There's no objective source within LotR, it all comes from historical documents Frodo/Bilbo copied into the Red Book, or their personal accounts of what people have told them.  Any information about 2nd-3rd age dwarves has 3 likely sources, The Elves of Eregion who did business with Durin's Folk, Gandalf who had dealing with all sorts of people, or Frodo and Bilbo themselves. Of those three, Gandalf would be the most knowledgeable post Eregion's destruction.  That doesn't mean Gandalf is infallible, just that he is infact the most authoritative source, sans words out of a Dwarf's mouth."

lotr,33lthv,Gotpilkkkkkk,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:34:57 2015 UTC,"So are you asking for fan hypotheticals, or information supplied by the actual source material?  I'll paraphrase Gandalf's words from A Shadow of the Past, an early chapter in LotR:   If any mortal individual keeps the Ring they will find their lifespan lengthened unnaturally, they are not granted extra life, their vitality is merely stretched out.  If a person were to wear the Ring often to turn invisible, eventually they will become permanently invisible. They will have ""faded."" Gandalf also describes the Nazgul as being ""faded,"" so perhaps the lesser rings, or at least the nine (and possibly the seven as well) also grant invisibility. And of course, the Ring would eventually come to dominate the thoughts of the bearer.   So that covers Dwarves†, Men, Hobbits and probably Orcs.  Ents? I don't know. They're probably in the same group as the previous, but it's not clear how their lifespans work. Treebeard appears to be immortal, but probably not in the same way as Elves or Maiar. Who knows if an Ent would have their life stretched as Gollum's was?  It's less clear how the One Ring would affect Elves. Galadriel believes she could master the Ring, and if so then surely other powerful Elves could as well, but in a letter Tolkien notes that a fundamental property of the Ring is to fill one's mind with deceits.  The final category are the Maiar in Middle Earth. This would include Gandalf, Saruman, and Sauron. Maiar are also immortal, and their angelic properties could mean that they would have more control over over the Ring (ex. perhaps they can turn on and off the invisibility at will.) In the same letter where Tolkien addresses Elven mastery of the One, he also supposes that Gandalf with the Ring could conquer Sauron, only to replace Sauron as a new Dark Lord.  †Turns out Durin's Folk have an exception when it comes to the seven lesser rings extending their lives. In my opinion that means the jury's out on the One."
lotr,33lthv,PrivateChicken,2,Thu Apr 23 17:44:08 2015 UTC,"So that covers Dwarves, Men, Hobbits and probably Orcs.   Are Dwarves considered mortal? Does mortality in Tolkien merely mean ""can die of old age,"" or does it tie into the fate of men to depart Arda entirely. If the latter is the case, I would argue that Dwarves are not, in fact, mortal. The little that's said of what occurs after they die points to them remaining in Arda, under the care of Aulë."
lotr,33lthv,EyeceEyeceBaby,5,Thu Apr 23 18:24:57 2015 UTC,"The word 'mortal', as used by Tolkien, has several different meanings. Some of those encompass Dwarves. Some do not."
lotr,33lthv,Uluithiad,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:41:12 2015 UTC,"Dwarves die. They have life spans of several hundred years, but they are not immortal as the Elves are.  Whether or not one's spirit leaves Arda is probably irrelevant. One function of the Rings of Power was to ""preserve."" This is how Sauron, under the guise of Annatar, marketed the Rings of Power to the Elves. The Elves of Eregion wished to preserve their kingdom in Middle Earth for as long as possible, together with Sauron they fashioned 16 Rings for that purpose. Later Celebrimbor fashioned 3 more that were even better at this without Sauron's help. The Three were a big factor that allowed enclaves of Lothlorien and Rivendell to continue as long as they did. It turned out the rings had the effect preserving their owners as well. But that effect was clearly not designed with the Gift of Men in mind.  EDIT: However, it's been brought to my attention that other circumstances apply to the dwarves."
lotr,33lthv,PrivateChicken,2,Thu Apr 23 19:03:29 2015 UTC,"True. But my point was geared toward the definition of ""mortal"" as used by Gandalf in that chapter. Dwarves certainly die of old age, but their fëar don't leave Arda. The question is, are elves immortal because they don't die of old age, or because they are tied to Arda forever? Conversely are men mortal because they do die of old age, or because their fëar depart Arda forever? I think Uluithiad hit the nail on the head though, and it's difficult to say precisely which meaning Gandalf intended. In light of DividingPrescott's argument though I think I agree with your emendation, the jury is still out on the Ring's affect on dwarves.  Personally I'm tempted to say that it would indeed grant, at the least, invisibility. The argument doesn't come from the ""Dwarves are mortal"" camp though, but rather how invisibility itself works. The ring makes a being invisible by pulling them into the wraith-world; something Tolkien called the ""Unseen."" Many beings exist simultaneously in both the Seen and the Unseen realms. Maiar are one example, as well as elves such as Glorfindel and Galadriel who, in the words of Gandalf, ""have dwelt in the Blessed Realm [and] live at once in both worlds."" I don't think there's any evidence to say that Dwarves exist at once in both realms. This seems to be something reserved for Ainur and very powerful elves who have lived in Aman.  As far as I can tell it's pretty difficult to say one way or the other definitively though. Once again, Dwarves remain an enigma."

lotr,33lthv,fileg,1 point,Fri Apr 24 07:36:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know that the intent was to preserve the owner, that may have been a side effect. They were mainly to preserve the kingdoms in middle earth, as the elven magic and power and hold over them would fade over time. The rings would help slow that significantly.  Now, this next statement is way outside of my area of lore. As I understand it, elves would fade in middle earth. They have a ""soul"", which is called a Fëa(i think Fëar is the plural), and their bodies. I recall reading that if elves stayed in middle earth, their bodies would eventually fade and the Fëa would be left behind. After the 4th age, the elves who refused the call to go west basically had their souls stuck in middle earth, and men came to fear them, as they were basically ghosts, and some became malicious spirits. Perhaps the rings also had the ability to slow this process to.   I need to read into this, because I have very little comprehension  about the elves. I'm one of the few Tolkien fans who love the dwarves more than all the other races, and their written lore is a fraction of what tolkien developed for the Elves."

I have a theory - and I say again, it's just my theory and I don't pretend it is canon.   I have a problem with the whole ""fading"" thing.   If the elves aren't meant to be in Middle-earth, why did Eru put them there?  The Valar want them all to cross the sea, but why?   Instead of leaving the elves where Eru put them, learning for themselves, the Valar want to take them home where they basically treat them like children and don't want them to do anything without permission.  And the more they obey, the better the Valar like them - The Vanyar, who don't seem to do anything but sit around and praise the Valar are the big favorites. The Noldor, who want to do things all the times, are always in trouble.   Do the Valar just want to have subjects, however benevolently they treat them?   My heart is with the Avari.

Not reaaaaaally. Aragorn is a descendant of Elros. Elrond, Elros' brother was indeed married to Celebrían, daughter of Galadriel, but Elros and his descendants had no such marriage.  If we look at the ascendants of Elros, we see that he is a descendant of Ëarendil, who was married to Elwing. Elwing, while she was an elf, had no direct kinship to the line of Galadriel. Upwards, we see that Elwing is a descendant of Dior, who was a descent of Lúthien. He is also a descendant of Idril, who was the granddaughter of Fingolfin.  If we go all the way up to the first generations of elves, what this tells us is that galadriel is descended from Finarfin (she's her daughter) and Aragorn is descended (VERY VERY thinly) from Fingolfin. They are both descended from Finwë and Indis, but all in all, the conclusion is:  No, Aragorn is not a descendant of Galadriel.  Finwë + Indis -> Finarfin (+ Ëarwen) -> Galadriel is a quick family line of Galadriel.  Finwë + Indis -> Fingolfin (+ some elf maiden whose name I don't recall) -> Turgon (+ Elenwë) -> Idril (+ Tuor) ->  Ëarendil (+ Elwing) -> Elros -> (many many many generations of men) -> Aragorn is a not so quick family line of the Noldor ascendancy of Aragorn.

Returning to Tirion was not an option because of their oath. Indeed Fëanor forced Fingolfin and his house to make the journey, and many ended up dying.  Again I really would argue that all the evils committed by Fëanor and his sons were driven by the oath they took. Not because they were morally justified. Fëanor's sense of morality was corrupted by Melkor. Imagine if Fëanor hadn't so jealously guarded the Silmarils, if he had maintained his relationship with Fingolfin and the Valar. The history probably wouldn't have been nearly as interesting to read, because the Valar might have been more likely to aid in the retaking of the Silmarils right off the bat. After all, they needed them to revitalize the Two Trees. That's all wild speculation though, the point is that I don't think their violence was justified. Perhaps justified in their minds, but not objectively."

lotr,33l3wm,Wrath_of_the_Lamb,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"It's never explicitly stated that Valar or Maiar (Other than Eönwë) participated, but I think it's generally assumed that at least some joined. I think Tulkas in particular might have wanted to join.  On the other hand it seems notable that Eönwë is the only Ainu mentioned at all in the host, which maybe is an indicator that it was indeed primarily Vanyar and Noldor.  Personally, I've always imagined the host including at least some Ainur. After all, so much power was unleashed during the War of Wrath that Beleriand was sunk beneath the sea."

I really started getting lost in the middle just with the sheer number of people and places to keep track of. I already ordered the middle earth atlas which should help we the geography. Can you recommend a way to keep all the characters and their families straight in my head? I look forward to following along with yall for my second reading!
lotr,33j1h1,HBot106,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:48:43 2015 UTC,"Download the lotr project app for your phone or tablet. It has maps, family trees, character bios, time lines, etc. It's worth the few dollars that I paid for it."
lotr,33gzsu,MrRathalos,106,Wed Apr 22 13:24:32 2015 UTC,"Alright so there are a few things we should cover here. First, as to why the Nazgul didn't simply attack Bree and acted stealthily to an extent rather than pursuing Frodo more openly, it comes down to strategy. There are no GPS or cell phones in Middle-Earth, no spy satellites or anything to simply say ""hey where are they?"" and the Ring does not work like a homing beacon for the Nazgul. All they have to go off of are ""Baggins"" and ""Shire."" Think about it, which has a higher chance of success? Riding openly so that news travels ahead of you and perhaps scares off your target, or remaining under the radar as much as possible until the last moment. The same idea applies to Bree. The Nazgul know the Ring is within the village. Why risk the chaos and confusion of ""wreaking havoc"" in Bree (which may allow someone to slip away unnoticed) when they can surround the area and wait for Frodo to depart? He's much more vulnerable on the road. If they were to enter Bree in an attempt to retrieve Frodo, again stealth would be preferred rather than tipping him off to their presence.   I guess I just feel like so far, the Black Riders are closer to men in black cloaks hiding their faces, as opposed to faceless mysterious servants of the Dark Lord.   In a sense, that's exactly what they are. The Nazgul are/were men. Great, terrible, fearsome & non-corporeal, but men nonetheless. Tolkien described them thus:   Their peril is almost entirely due to the unreasoning fear which they inspire (like ghosts). They have no great physical power against the fearless; but what they have, and the fear that they inspire, is enormously increased in darkness. - Letter 210   Their chief power comes from the unrestrained, unbearable fear that those around them experience and in that regard, they are the faceless, mysterious servants of the Dark Lord."
lotr,33gzsu,EyeceEyeceBaby,20,Wed Apr 22 14:04:56 2015 UTC,"It sounds like that fear was conveyed well in the movies, then. To find that they are just men is jarring when they seem like so much more."
lotr,33gzsu,Dirty_Socks,4,Wed Apr 22 19:41:45 2015 UTC,"At this point you dont really know about the 9. Your fear you have of them,  like the characters in the book, come from stories and tales past to one another. To read how gandalf reacts after meeting the king in the white city is chilling. But for now, they're just ominous figures hunting frodo"
lotr,33gzsu,JustWiggl3s,11,Wed Apr 22 21:21:50 2015 UTC,"Minor emendation.   Great, terrible, fearsome & non-corporeal invisible, but men nonetheless.   They are corporeal (they literally have bodies). They ride real mounts, they wear real clothes, they wield real weapons, and the Witch-king dies when struck with a mortal wound (to the face/neck) with a mundane sword (following the loss of whatever Merry's barrow-blade undid).  Their bodies may not necessarily follow normal human biology anymore, but they aren't just ghosts like the dead men of Dunharrow."
lotr,33gzsu,WalkingTarget,6,Wed Apr 22 20:18:38 2015 UTC,"No they're certainly not ghosts. They exist in the Unseen realm. They are wraiths. Perhaps it's merely from my interpretation but I always placed the Unseen as something outside of the corporeal world. That's precisely why Sauron needed to give them mounts and clothing and weapons that they could use to interact with the Seen.  The more I think about it though I think you're right, it was a poor word choice. ""Invisible,"" or simply ""Unseen"" would be more accurate."
lotr,33gzsu,EyeceEyeceBaby,19,Wed Apr 22 21:00:21 2015 UTC,"Well, later on in the books (when they're riding their fell beasts) they are much more imposing.  Still, their chief weapon is fear, not actual physical force.  In some ways the movies did a very good job of translating the fear surrounding the Nazgul into the language of hollywood.  The audience feels a similar fear of them that the characters do."
lotr,33gzsu,Mr_Spaz,25,Wed Apr 22 17:38:12 2015 UTC,"Well your second to last paragraph is sorta correct at the moment. They're sent deep into enemy territory and powerful as they could be, there are still only nine of them hundreds of miles away from any reinforcements.   Now even the collective force of Bree standing up to them would probably only slow them down IMO unless Aragorn was leading them, but destroying Bree would pretty much announce their presence to everyone and they'd be hunted by the elves of Lindon and Rivendell and the Dunedain, who can actually fight them and in doing so seriously hinder or completely stop their search for the ring. They could not ride openly against the collective strength of The Elves and the Dunedain AND complete their mission so they turned to stealth. Which is Ironic considering that's exactly what the forces of the west do in the end."
lotr,33gzsu,WizardBrownbeard,12,Wed Apr 22 13:49:58 2015 UTC,"I fully understand what you mean here. The Lord of the Rings are my favourite movies and books, I don't hold one above the other.  There are parts of the books that I superior to the films and vice versa.  The way the Nazguls are described in the novels work in their setting, but actually seeing them like that wouldn't work while still trying to evoke fear. That's while the films opted for the glidy mysterious cloaks who barely make a single sound outside of that piercing scream.  So I don't think either one is better, but like you I prefer the movie wraiths."
lotr,33gzsu,korrt106,13,Wed Apr 22 16:13:33 2015 UTC,"I think you're doing a really good job of not letting the movies unduly influence your view of the books, and I'd be really interested to hear you do the same compare and contrast of the depictions of Nazgul after The Siege of Gondor.  You're in for a treat."
lotr,33gzsu,confusador,15,Wed Apr 22 15:52:38 2015 UTC,"Eh, is he, though? There's a bit too much of 'should' and discomfort surrounding the book Nazgul not being mimics of the unsubtle movie Nazgul. OP has the reading comprehension to see the two treatments aren't the same (more than can be said for many), but his desires seem heavily tilted in favoring the films. He's in for quite of a shock when he hits 'A Knife in the Dark'."
lotr,33gzsu,Uluithiad,9,Wed Apr 22 16:40:05 2015 UTC,But the Nazgul during the siege and prior to the battle are fucking scary.  They just swoop around the sky instilling fear and leaching any kind of bravery or hope from the city.  The book really gets at that instead of setting them up as some kind of badass solider or something.
lotr,33gzsu,cakebatter,5,Wed Apr 22 19:04:27 2015 UTC,"I mean, in the movies they come in like shrieking demons, and almost everyone panics and flees at their sight.  I would say the movies do a good job at making them seem frightening, faceless terrors."
lotr,33gzsu,losphobos,3,Wed Apr 22 22:15:21 2015 UTC,"I suppose I'm just repeating things already mentioned - but for me it just seems that terrifying and / or killing everyone they encounter doesn't help them in any way. It announces their presence, potentially scaring off the ones they seek - and it's going to make it more difficult for them to get the information they need.  I suppose they could be terrifying and torture and kill their way through Bree and then the Shire - but honestly that actually seems like more work then just being a little creepy and asking about ""Baggins"".  As far as the narrative is concerned, I think it works better for the book that they are an obvious threat but maybe not overwhelmingly scary. It's early on in the tale, and while you want the protagonists to encounter obstacles I think you also want to build tension and work towards bigger threats. So the hobbits are being sought out and are in obvious danger - but to them at first it appears to be just some strange men looking for the ring."
lotr,33gzsu,Orangemenace13,2,Thu Apr 23 02:44:42 2015 UTC,"OP, you might enjoy the essay called The Hunt for the Ring in Unfinished Tales."
lotr,33gzsu,newtonpage,2,Thu Apr 23 01:17:02 2015 UTC,"One of the big reasons why the Nazgul have to act with stealth is there are people in the north lands that can fight and defeat them. And one of the reasons that Frodo and company escape them is the Nazgul are noticed by powerful forces and hunted. When they meet Glorfindel he's chasing the Nine. The elves they meet in the Shire send messages ahead to warn other of the coming of the Nine. Gandalf is able to fight four or five of them at Weathertop and hold out all night. Aragorn fights off 5 with just two burning branches.  The nazgul are not like the wizards or balrogs they don't have that much power in themselves, they are Sauron's most capable servants but that isn't staying that much consider who normally works for him.  It comes down to stealth and fear are their most offensive powers, they can't assault Bree as /u/WizardBrownbeard suggests, they would lose badly. They need minions to do a lot of their work, it's two people in the Prancing Pony that time them off the ring being there. Every time the Nazgul are confronted by large numbers they flee.  The Nazgul are powerful men that are really hard to kill, but there are a lot of forces in Middle Earth that are much more powerful."
lotr,33gzsu,DuranStar,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:05:40 2015 UTC,"Reading this it sounds like their chief value to Sauron was propaganda. The fear of the nine was key. When stood up to by their equals, they lost. Badly."
lotr,33gzsu,RedEyeView,1 point,Wed May 13 04:46:52 2015 UTC,They are more powerful than regular people but they aren't a army. And in the books Elrond ever says what few we have here (in rivendel) that could stand against the nine I sent forth to find you (the ring bearer)(very much paraphrased).  And as shown later in the books the fear 'of' the nine was not their greatest power it was the fear they could 'inflict' on all but the most stalwart.
lotr,33gzsu,DuranStar,1 point,Wed May 13 22:19:53 2015 UTC,"My impression is that as the Black Riders they are 'disguised.'  As others say, they're relying on stealth.  After the flood at the Fords, and they go back to Mordor, and on the fell beasts, they are more open, and more powerful, more in line with what you see in the movies."
lotr,33gzsu,Seafroggys,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:34:08 2015 UTC,"In addition to what others have said here, one of the main reasons that the Nine are relatively weak while in the Shire is because they are so far from their power source, Sauron.

lotr,33cev4,BullFrog_96,63,Tue Apr 21 11:46:29 2015 UTC,It is beautiful but as a fellow artist I think it could benefit from more contrast. Like maybe use a 4 to 6b soft pencil to darken the dark areas to make the effect more dramatic.
lotr,33cev4,bexyrex,22,Tue Apr 21 14:32:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your feedback. Posted it on /r/drawing yesterday and there were a few people already mentioning the light tones.

Still a very important thing I need to improve. Thank you for that :)"
lotr,33cev4,monsterscribbles,13,Tue Apr 21 14:42:46 2015 UTC,"It's great. Contrast has always been my biggest problem, I just can't seem to get comfortable with it.

Keep at it though, this is awesome."
lotr,33cev4,flammafemina,8,Tue Apr 21 15:32:33 2015 UTC,Thank you very much. It means a lot to me to hear that from a professional!
lotr,33cev4,draconum_ggg,2,Tue Apr 21 15:37:22 2015 UTC,"One way to ensure higher contrast in a drawing is by starting with your darks. Don't go too dark too quickly of course, build them up with layers, but this way you're able to base your other values on your darkest darks. Sometimes starting with lights forces you to continually darken the shadows in an attempt to achieve more contrast until you can't get them any darker, giving you a dark image overall. Also, before beginning, plan out your highlights. Mark them out somehow so you won't be tempted to fill them in. Preserve that shit for the white of the paper.   In short: map out highlights, start building up darks, work back from there. Hope this helps/isn't too confusing."
lotr,33cev4,bexyrex,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:02:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I will definitely keep that in mind. Helps a lot!"
lotr,33cev4,OkAgain,2,Tue Apr 21 19:05:31 2015 UTC,Another common technique for learning to use contrast is to start with a medium grey paper and draw over it in a dark black pencil and a white pencil. This way you get to dictate where the darks AND the lights go. My biggest problem was always either not darkening the shadows enough or covering over my highlights.
lotr,33cev4,giantsfan97,3,Wed Apr 22 13:46:10 2015 UTC,Yeah being afraid of contrast is a very common problem among developing artists. But stepping into it can dramatically change the quality and appearance of skill In your work. Keep working hard! :)

lotr,33cev4,abbytheobesemanx,2,Tue Apr 21 15:40:37 2015 UTC,"I like the subtly of the contrast because a balrog is supposed to be a creature of smoke and fire. So it was kinda nice to think of him as part of the surrounding gloom, not just a standalone creature in the dark."

lotr,33cev4,KittyBitMyFoot,6,Tue Apr 21 15:58:29 2015 UTC,It's not so much contrast the piece needs so much as it just needs some heavy darks to balance it out and make it more striking.   I'm on my phone right now. I'd put it back in photoshop and use levels to tinker with just the dark tones for a better outcome.

I think Christopher Tolkien explained some of these edits in his intro to ""Children of Hurin"".  Anyway, you could skip that section of Unfinished Tales if you really wanted."

lotr,33i5rt,lukatory,2,Wed Apr 22 18:40:45 2015 UTC,"Well, here's my speculation. Denethor seemed very sure of himself, even enough to use the Palantír. So how I see it going down is Denethor basically forcing the hobbits to give him The Ring. Unless Gandalf stepped in (Which I honestly don't see ending well), Denethor would've held off the enemy, and after that it kind of gets iffy.   Denethor could've turned the men of Rohan against him because he has effectively doomed them to failure The men of Rohan could grudgingly help Gondor fight the war Most likely: Aragorn squares off with Denethor after all the battles but right before they would have gone off to the Black Gate and tried to retrieve the ring for the hobbits."
lotr,33i5rt,ThatRadChickRoxy,2,Wed Apr 22 20:10:48 2015 UTC,"but to answer your question, maybe they could have won????? Maybe? But even if they did, it wouldn't have been nearly as good as how it went in the book."
lotr,33i5rt,ThatRadChickRoxy,3,Wed Apr 22 20:11:26 2015 UTC,"They would not have ""won."" They might have defeated Sauron, yes; but at the cost of a new Ring Lord."
lotr,33i5rt,ebneter,2,Thu Apr 23 05:10:30 2015 UTC,"The men of Rohan could grudgingly help Gondor fight the war   Rohan is bound to Gondor by an oath of alliance spanning 500 years and Denethor has the Ring. Rohan's fealty is utterly, completely assured."
lotr,33i5rt,dr_amy_bishop,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:15:36 2015 UTC,This isn't Game of Thrones. Men are honorable here. That's one of the many reasons why Middle Earth is my favorite fantasy world.
lotr,33i5rt,dr_amy_bishop,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"So this boils down to three questions:   Who ultimately would have ended up with the Ring? Would have they have been capable of wielding its power of command? Did they have enough time to use that power to amass enough military power / large enough armies to resist the might of the armies that Sauron had amassed by that point in the timeline?   I would say the answers to those questions would be, respectively:   Faramir Yes. No, hell no.   I would say that upon his return to Minas Tirith, Faramir would be so alarmed by his father's desire for the Ring that he would fear the thirst for its power had corrupted him, and feel he had to depose his father for the good of Minas Tirith. Frodo could never be allowed to leave Minas Tirith, and would have been kept under guard. Gradually the desperation of the war and the accessibility of the Ring would bring him around to the idea of using it, but by that point it would be so late that he would barely have had time to learn to use it at all, even feebly, before Minas Tirith would have fallen.  It's possible that Denethor could have outwitted him on his arrival and successfully confiscated the Ring. If so, things would have gone slightly differently... Denethor would have been corrupted much more swiftly, meaning that he would have had more time to use the Ring, and is probably stronger willed and more qualified to use it than his son. The thing is, Sauron's head start is just so massive that I think the only difference this will make is a slight change in the margin by which Gondor gets crushed."

I actually have all of the LOTR games although I've never really tried to beat the Fellowship because its insanely buggy.

lotr,33al8n,rchase,5,Wed Apr 22 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd rather no one tried to adapt the Silmarillion into a TV show or film.  The Lord of the Rings was made into great movies. The Hobbit was made into mediocre movies, despite seeming easier to adapt.  The Silmarillion would be significantly more difficult to display in a coherent manner on TV.  The chances of it being done well are low, if you ask me.  It seems to me that most adaptations of beloved books are mostly attempts to make a fortune off of a known fan base.  I don't want to see that happen with the Silmarillion.  I love the book, and the book is enough for me."

lotr,33al8n,iamnotreallyreal,4,Tue Apr 21 04:28:26 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem aside from Tolkien estate is that Middle Earth already has its look.  And that look costs a fuck ton of money to achieve.  Then you have the sheer amount of CGI that would be needed to be able to accurately portray what happens in the book.  This isn't Game of Thrones with just Dragons.  This would require a lot of CGI.  Is Peter Jackson doing this?  Because he ain't cheap.  And he either writes or he doesn't direct.  Is Netflix cool with giving him that much control?  Does Netflix understand that this will never be the next Game of Thrones, even if you commercialize it, it would not be nearly as accessible.    Some things belong on TV, and some things belong on Film.  The Silmarillion could easily be split into 3-5 films.  And honestly, that's what should be done.  It would then have the proper budget.  And despite what Reddit may think of the Hobbit, it did teach us something:  regardless of reviews and perception, a Jackson Middle Earth film will make about $1 billion per film worldwide, not taking into account the insane revenue they must get from licensing and sales of BluRay/Digital.  I know miniseries or show sounds attractive, but it just wouldn't work unless it took a huge hit in quality, visually."

lotr,33bkn9,ellimac32,8,Tue Apr 21 04:36:40 2015 UTC,"I would say good storytelling.  However, not being accurate to the story doesn't inherently make your story better. When you have a much beloved work like The Lord of the Rings (the books), it's probably for good reasons. Paying attention to those reasons and using them to guide your work, while making sure you continue to make a fine product of your own, will likely make your work stronger. In the case of Jackson's films, there are many areas where I think he should have stayed truer to Tolkien not simply for the sake of accuracy, but because I think it would have raised the quality of the films.  Secondly, if you do stray from the text, be honest about it. Don't sell it as faithful. Don't sell it as accurate. That's Jackson's chief mistake for me in regards to the 'faithfulness and accuracy' discussion."
lotr,33bkn9,Edledhron,2,Tue Apr 21 04:43:00 2015 UTC,Being accurate on translating the book to film does both.  Bc its already a good story to begin with and the descriptions the books use play off the imagination of the mind... so I guess accuracy is in the eye of the beholder

""Fornost"" translates as ""northern fortress,"" but rather than just call it that, Tolkien came up with something fitting that sounds like a place. In this case, ""Norbury"" is derived from Old English - you can see the roots there for ""northern"" and ""burgh.""

Though originally CS, the name was given long before the time of the tale, and contains the old word tind 'a spike', which if it had survived would have rhymed with find, etc. But it now appears as tine 'prong' with loss of d. The ON equivalent was tind-r, OHG zint. It might be possible to use the latter as an archaic form; but the current (probably related) Ger. Zinne has precisely the right sense. Of this Zinne the Swed. equivalent is Tinne, Dan. Tind(e) - which also seem suitable. Tol Brandir should be retained as an Elvish name.  [...] In the manuscript of Nomenclature Tolkien says that 'Tol means a sheer-sided isle, Brandir was of uncertain origin and meaning; prob[ably] a corruption of *baradnir Grey-elven [Sindarin] for tower-steep = ""steep tower""'. In his unfinished index he notes for Tol Brandir '(tol a high steep-sided isle) an isle so steep that none could land on it, in the midst of the outlet of Anduin from Nen Hithoel to the falls of Rauros'."

Game of Thrones is the only thing I can think if that even comes close in terms of depth of history, but Tolkien's work was really language creation with some story added.

For example, I think the Tywin/Tyrion relationship is one of the best father son relationships in all of fiction. Utterly brilliant. I think the culture building Martin did is amazing, and he provides more dialogue to establish things like typical sayings and catch phrases. That his characters reference things without bothering to explain them gives a great sense that this world is a real place. It's not without flaws, but whenever I read Martin, I really believe the characters are real people.

lotr,334ktl,humeanation,41,Sun Apr 19 21:39:44 2015 UTC,"The diversity of his books? When Frodo and Sam split form Aragorn and crew, he was writing basically two different stories. One the now classical hero returns to reclaim his throne, Lead armies and do bad ass stuff, giant battles good against evil at its finest. The other is 2 weak creatures trying to save the world virtually on their own with the help of Gollum who is making it even harder and isn't' that trustworthy. They deal more with personal things and fight against monsters, they are weak creatures burdened by the ring. It's like Whaaaa dude. Two completely different stories within the same world happening at the same time which started up the same.   I didn't read your question correctly so I wrote stuff about Tolkien's writing as a whole at first.   Lets start with the diversity within his world. It's not just the one character we follow through the entire time. He writes about hundreds of people each having their own story. And they are as diverse as it gets and yet still within the same world. Take ""The hobbit"" and ""the children of Hurin"" for example. One is a Child story the other is somethign almost post apocalyptic. Turin experiences death all around him, he falls lower and lower in his quest experiencing failure after failure. Shit is grim."

Tolkien writes as though he isn't the creator, but the discoverer, and that certain pieces of the lore have been lost, or destroyed, etc.   The Red Book of Westmarch, the missing Palantiri, the blue wizards, the entwives, Bombadil.  Tolkien imagined these things, but never fully fleshed them out. I doubt he even had specific plans for many of them.  He was literally the author, but figuratively, he was simply a discoverer of his own world and it adds am unfathomable depth to his world that simply doesn't exist in many other works."

As you say, the characters have heart and depth and you can tell T really cared about them and the world he set the story in.   I think that's a very important point - he cared so much about his setting. The languages, names and places often came before the plot. The Lord of the Rings is a breathtaking story, but it's also a glimpse of a much larger legendarium. In my eyes Tolkien remains unparalleled in worldbuilding. Not that Arda doesn't have flaws (I've heard all kinds of remarks about its geology and demographics), but I doubt Tolkien was interested in such matters. He concerned himself with the mythology and philology of his peoples, and very successfully drew inspiration from Germanic legends in this. Middle-Earth has an otherworldly quality that I have yet to find in any other fantasy novel. I also love that, as much material as he did create, he did not explain everything. I think a mistake modern fantasy writers sometimes make is to get stuck in worldbuilding and explain everything down to the last brick. Conjecture and inconsistencies add to the appeal for me, and I don't like it when fantasy gets scientific (though this is just personal taste, of course)."
lotr,334ktl,ToffeeKing,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:42:06 2015 UTC,Why would anyone complain about the geology? Middle-Earth is literally the geography of a world after an apocalyptic war between gods that formed and then shattered it. Repeatedly.

lotr,334ktl,ToffeeKing,34,Thu Apr 23 13:15:38 2015 UTC,"Really? Characters in The Lord of the Rings are easily the first thing I would flag up as being a weaker element. To some extent Tolkien was adhering to a tradition coming from the likes of Arthurian mythology: writers like Malory didn't create characters with any sort of psychological depth to them: in the hands of masters of character like Shakespeare, Melville or Nabokov, King Arthur and co. could have been very interesting case-studies in power, loyalty, jealousy and dozens of other interesting topics, but Malory only really gives us the characters' actions.  Tolkien goes a little further - but not much. His characters grow, but there's nothing complex about them: they're fully understandable: we either know what makes them tick, or (in the case of people like Treebeard and Bombadil) we're not given enough information to work that out. A lot of the characters are incredibly simple, and tend to just be embodiments of certain ideas connected to their race. Aragorn, for example, is about as straight-forward a character as you could get. Even the characters who exhibit moral change are relatively simple: they have weakness and the ring brings it out of them. In the hands of a better author of character, much more could have been done with the temptation of Boromir, but rather than a Macbeth-esque fall into temptation, Boromir's failure is basic and unconvoluted.  However, I should point out that this is not the point. Tolkien wasn't a writer of character, like I say. He created worlds: he created environments and - most importantly - languages. Tolkien is all about the big picture. I think it's this that makes him 'different' to his forebears and more recent imitators. He poured in a level of detail into his fictional world that allowed it to compete with mythologies which have spanned centuries and been told by many."
lotr,334ktl,FaerieStories,2,Thu Apr 23 18:51:56 2015 UTC,"I agree that the language of Tolkien's world is a huge difference between his stories and other authors'. He was a creator of entire new languages just for the his books. I cant recall exactly what I read or where, but I think that Tolkien started his world building from the language and then worked his way out to some degree."
lotr,334ktl,infernobassist,5,Sun Apr 19 15:31:37 2015 UTC,"In addition to the reasons others have given, LOTR was a literary masterpiece. You touched on it a bit with the depth of the characters, but its more than that. Tolkien was able to paint the entire world as vividly and as real as the characters. LOTR is regularly included when people discuss the greatest writings of last century and will likely be studied in universities and classrooms for centuries."
lotr,334ktl,vanwe,4,Sun Apr 19 16:11:36 2015 UTC,One thing I realized is that a lot of fantasies use the 'powerful protagonist'. A lot of the time he starts out weak but by the end he is literally stronger than anyone. However in both The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings the protagonist are these weak(read as normal) people. They literally have little to no reason to be involved in the events surrounding them. Which makes the trials and endeavors they do all the more thrilling because it actually feels like they are a real person from the beginning to the end.
lotr,334ktl,Xattm15,6,Sun Apr 19 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"To me part of it is how Tolkien uses English in a way that feels somewhat archaic yet genuine. I've been rereading it out loud to my kids, which results in my noticing this more. Every few pages there's a word I wouldn't know except for having read Tolkien (or still don't know). Like, oh, wold, eyot, hythe, writhen, and so on. Then there are many words I understand but rarely see, like thither, whither, and many more.  There's also something about how he puts sentences together, word order and such, that often evokes an archaic feeling to me. But it always feels very natural and not forced, as if that was just the way Tolkien spoke himself.  I suspect to some degree these kind of things really are the way Tolkien's English was in general—some words are certainly ones he grew up with and used without thinking they were unusual, even if they are to me. Some of it is, I think, Tolkien deliberately emulating medieval styles. It doesn't come off as fake probably because of Tolkien deep familiarity with medieval texts and language.  Lots of other fantasy books use archaic-sounding language, but too often it comes off sounding fake and shallow.  None of this is about the characters so is a bit off topic. Still, it feels completely right for Aragorn to say, for example, ""Whither now shall I go?"" In many other fantasy books the forced archaic language makes the characters feel fake too."

lotr,334ktl,iamnotreallyreal,2,Sun Apr 19 16:32:35 2015 UTC,"Most fantasy fiction uses world building as a kind of theatrical stage or film set. You take a cast of characters who could be from a young adult novel or a political thriller, dress them up in wizard robes and spiked armor, and order some castle scenery and dragon animations, so to speak.   LoTR has a much richer texture of mythology and historicity than anything else. There is an ancient and ephemeral quality about it, a sense of tales out of the mists of time. It reads more like a fairy tale, or like the romances from the middle ages, than like a science fiction novel.

Everything just feels like the natural progression of things and I think that's where it really separates itself from other fantasy series - the lore (which seems like fact).  When I went to school, I double majored in Film and History. Looking back, Lord of the Rings had a HUGE impact on that decision.

lotr,334ktl,patpentz,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:35:30 2015 UTC,"It's intended as a mythological pre-history to the real life modern age. It is about a decline of magic, elves and dwarves. Men and Hobbits interbreed so the original sized people no longer exist.  Narnia and Harry Potter are different. Narnia is ongoing and people from our world can go to Narnia. It also exists on a different plain, time works differently. With Harry Potter they're more like secret enclaves hidden in the real world and we explore the relationship with the real world. In both instances magic is ongoing and is more about escapism than a mythology that could've existed. I think they make room for more complex characters whereas Lord of the Rings is about great heroic deeds and events, less about Gimli being a wisecracker, Aragorn acting like a confused ""no-one-understands-me"" teenager or Gandalf being a freeloving marijuana consumer. I'm not even sure if the books' characters even had character arcs.  One thing I'll say though. Tolkien wanted England to have a mythology, except it did pre-Christianity. We believed in Norse mythology essentially except with different names, hence the days of the week are mostly named after Anglo-Saxon gods. We also had a range of other paganism before Norse with Brythonic and Pictish people but we're not entirely sure what that could've been."

lotr,334ktl,Dantheman146,2,Wed Apr 22 04:52:02 2015 UTC,"I definitely wouldn't call it the ""origin of the subgenre"", the books were written in the 50s, fantasy stories and myths have existed for thousands of years."
lotr,334ktl,JakeHasCake,18,Sat Jun 13 21:01:15 2015 UTC,"But it has been that argued that fantasy in its current form has a lot to do with Tolkien's writings. Tolkien basically created many of the common fantasy tropes.  Just as a short example: Elves and Dwarves were nothing like we think of them today before Tolkien wrote about them, they were more comparable to pixis or sprites than the the typical tall fair Elves and stout metal working Dwarves."
lotr,334ktl,TanithArmoured,4,Sun Apr 19 14:33:09 2015 UTC,"In Norse mythology where they originated, elves and dwarves definitely aren't pixies or sprites. They're supernatural, but they're at least man-sized and they don't have the flitting ethereal quality that we associate with pixies and sprites. Interestingly, they're also interchangeable to a pretty great extent. You can read two different versions of the same story and in one it's dwarfs who do a given thing and in another it's elves  This doesn't really damage your point any, you're still correct that Tolkien made them what they are today. Just a minor nitpick"
lotr,334ktl,estolad,3,Sun Apr 19 15:02:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are right, but in other cultures they were considered more of a smaller pixi/gnome type creatures. Tolkien did base a lot of his work off of Norse and Anglo-Saxon writings (it was what he taught after all!),   but I think what I meant to say in the first comment was that he gave elves and dwarves their culture as it is seen today. almost all generic fantasy that includes the two races show their cultures as that of Tolkien."

Take for example how little he describes something as massive as the misty mountains in the trilogy.  Compare his work to something like Jordan's Eye of the World. He is commonly compared to Tolkien, but Jordan is a goddamn fanatic when it comes to describing every little thing down to the smallest detail.  So his books are a lot harder to get into, not because the stories aren't fantastic, but they moved at a glacial pace.  So slow in fact that Jordan died before he was able to finish the story."

I read a lot of half-assed, boilerplate swords and sorcery bullshit and it burned me on the whole genre. The prose was just so crap. And then I read LoTR and it was literally like a breath of fresh air.   I don't know why you talked about ""character development."" as that is on an entirely different tier from the nuts and bolts of the prose style that I'm talking about. ""Very cut and dry dialogue about what's happening."" i'm not sure what you mean here, do you mean the dialogue or the actual description of events? Because those are two very different things.

Great voice for Gandalf.  Not a big fan of the music and Gollum is altogether wretched and lacking the comedy Andy Serkis brought to the role.

lotr,33599o,Bananafrosted,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:47:14 2015 UTC,"These graphs are based on Amazon Kindle's X-Ray feature which shows you where a character appears in the book. I couldn't tell exactly how they determine it but it seems to be that if a character is mentioned once in a chapter then they are marked as being in that chapter. It doesn't seem to matter if they are physically present in the scene, just is their name is mentioned. So, Frodo, for example, has almost complete appearance even though he isn't in books 3 and 5.   I'm not 100% convinced that these are completely accurate but I thought I'd give it a go anyway and if you guys notice any glaring errors, please let me know.   Thanks!"

There is no possible way that Aragorn and co. could've exited the Paths of the Dead and been able to see Pelagir.   Another example is the distance between Minas Tirith and Osgiliath and the fact that the view from Minas Tirith shows that Ithilien doesn't have any trees.

However, if on your first go around you can just push past these parts (don't skip though) I think you can really get engrossed in the novels.

Take Fellowship of the Ring for example, where Frodo and Sam just walk out of the Shire. In the book, there's a long procedure. It includes selling Bag End, shifting the furniture, little insight of Frodo's past, more talk with the elves, old forest, Tom... There's a lot to it and I don't want to spoil it. Where the movie took hardly 20-30 minutes, the book is much longer and more explaining."

There are moments in the book where the feeling become so real, for example, while Aragorn & the hobbits were being chased by the Nazgul there was this dark vibe to the story and fear was everpresent.

Here's Lee's own account of the meeting Tolkien:   Q: What do you remember of meeting Tolkien?    CL: Very little. I was up in Oxford meeting some friends, and we were in the Randolph Hotel. Someone said, ""What are you doing here, this is all rather correct and proper; lets go to a pub."" This was forty-five + years ago. We were sitting there talking and drinking beer, and someone said, ""Oh, look who walked in."" It was Professor Tolkien, and I nearly fell off my chair. I didn't even know he was alive. He was a benign looking man, smoking a pipe, walking in, an English countryman with earth under his feet. And he was a genius, a man of incredible intellectual knowledge. He knew somebody in our group. He (the man in the group) said ""Oh Professor, Professor..."" And he came over. And each one of us, well I knelt of course, each one of us said ""how do you do?"" And I just said ""Ho.. How.. How..."" I just couldn't believe it. But I'll never forget it.   He was almost too star struck to say anything at all, much less be promised the the role. He has said though that he always wanted to play Gandalf, should a film ever be made. He auditioned for the role but didn't get it, obviously (probably because of his age). The whole ""Tolkien gave him his blessing"" idea is unfortunately propagated by an uncited line in Lee's lotr.wikia article. If it is true, then I haven't seen a credible source saying so."

Then consider how special effects can make anyone old, young, even different enough to be completely separate characters (Gary Oldman roles, Austin Powers movies, Eddie Murphy movies, etc). In the Hobbit, Legolas didn't have a ton of screen time so in theory Bloom could easily play another character. Enter Bard who, to some, bears a striking resemblance to an older version of a certain Pirates of the Caribbean character and we have us some confused viewers.

It speaks to a certain lack of imagination or innovation that they had to cast a guy whose outlook and demeanor is already in the public psyche as an action person, perhaps not to confuse the audience with yet another character archetype even when they have the actor responsible for the original archetype already cast (thankfully out of character)."

As for why they alone are allowed to leave Arda, I always interpreted it as being tied to the notion that they are much more able to effect change in their fate compared to Elves. Elves are tied to Arda for the entirety of its existence. As such, they are bound to the consequences of their actions in a much more concrete way than Men are. Men, on the other hand, are able to leave Arda altogether. They can live their lives more free from the burden of consequence."

My point is basically this, though, I think the elves might think that Eru favors humans because they envy their ability to die. I think the humans think that the elves are Eru's favorite because they are envious of the elves' longevity.  Short version : I don't think Iluvatar plays favorites."

That being said, Games-Workshop is frightfully expensive, and there are more expensive games out there by different companies. Warmachine/Hordes is very similar to GW games for much cheaper. I've never played it myself, but those who've played both Warmachine/Hordes and GW games generally say they actually think that Warmachine/Hordes as a game is more fun.  Also thought I'd mention you can easily buy cheap models online. A dude on /r/dfw the other day was selling a full-sized Eldar army that would have cost ~$500 to buy in stores for only like $100.

They all seem either unfounded or it's something where there's an actual answer to the conjecture in the appendices/HoME/Silmarillion/UT books and more often than not I either ignore it or internalize my annoyance that people haven't read more thoroughly.  I know it's kind of a pedantic stance but I'm kind of a pedant. On the bright side I like to think I'm not a jerk about it. I don't downvote peoples' theories or make a big stink about disproving them, I just move along. Tolkien fans are kind of blessed in that there is so much appendical material which can be pored through; so fan theory to me seems a little pointless. Tolkien spent basically his entire life building this magical world, if there's something that he didn't specifically mention in the published narratives, there's a chance it'll be mentioned in the appendices/HoME/UT, and if it's not mentioned there then it just doesn't exist; and hardly needs to, right? It would have been awesome if he had fleshed out the eastern and southern parts of Middle-Earth, but the story doesn't suffer for its lack.

lotr,32rimc,gloamingchild,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:20:46 2015 UTC,That's funny because Tolkien himself loved to take on the persona of a theorist. Albeit of the scholary rather than fan persuasion.

I know it's ridiculous but the last paragraph really sells it:   The spell that binds Bombadil to his narrow and cursed country was put in place centuries ago by the Valar to protect men and elves. It may last a few decades more, perhaps a few generations of hobbit lives. But when the last elf has gone from the havens and the last spells of rings and wizards unravel, then it will be gone. And Iarwain Ben-Adar, Oldest and Fatherless, who was ruler of the darkness in Middle Earth before Sauron was, before Morgoth set foot there, before the first rising of the sun, will come into his inheritance again. And one dark night the old trees will march westward into the Shire to feed their ancient hatred. And Bombadil will dance down amongst them, clad in his true shape at last, singing his incomprehensible rhymes as the trees mutter their curses and the black and terrible Barrow-Wights dance and gibber around him. And he will be smiling.   Least favorite probably goes to pretty much anything that bases it's premise on incorrect assumptions based on the films.

Gandalf would have recognized the hell out of it 2. In all likelihood Thranduil would have either recognized it or at least desired it above anything else after seeing it 3. All the Noldor and their exiled descendants probably would have ""felt"" it when it was revealed 4. Thorin is simply too insignificant a character to be buried with the gem- they tend to end up with grand heroes who have done the impossible and kicked reason to the curb.

lotr,32qaes,JRDerpwing,6,Wed Apr 15 21:14:40 2015 UTC,"Not that I'm aware of.  An issue you might run into is that Tolkien was pretty clear that, for the most part - and especially after the Children show up, the Valar and Maiar generally take on forms of general humanoid outline. [Melkor/Morgoth and Sauron might be] Demonic in appearance otherwise, maybe, but still human-centric given the relative importance of Elves and Men in the world (unlike the utter insignificance of Man in Lovecraft).  Ungoliant, however, just screams for a Lovecraftian horror in spider shape IMO."
lotr,32qaes,WalkingTarget,0,Wed Apr 15 22:52:14 2015 UTC,"Ungoliant is definitely an Eldritch Abomination. I'm a bit rusty but IIRC even the Valar have no idea where the hell she came from. Between that and the existence of an Outer Darkness/Void, as well as sea monsters that are unexplained in origin (Deep Ones?) I'd say a crossover fanfic where Eru is only carving out a small region of sanity (Ea) to protect from the cosmic horrors is very doable.  It would also neatly explain the theodicies- a benevolent Iluvatar allows great amounts of suffering? Not a problem, he's just doing his best to ensure that not everyone goes utterly insane forever., and can barely handle that."

lotr,32prsj,gloamingchild,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:21:54 2015 UTC,"Might I recommend the History of Middle-Earth series, then? Just having a bit of fun. HoME is all of Tolkien's notes and drafts that relate to the world where LotR takes place, his son Christopher compiled them and wrote some framework for them to be published as The Silmarillion, which was the history book you're looking for. Just be warned that it's written in a very high register, even more lofty than that of LotR so at times it can be like reading the bible. It is SUUUUPER worth reading though if you want to know what the world was like before The Hobbit."
lotr,32nn7z,Ben1313,11,Wed Apr 15 06:03:19 2015 UTC,"OK, there's a lot here.  Why was Minas Tirith so important? Well, there's the obvious answer of it being the capital of Gondor, the strongest single force standing against Sauron. But beyond this, Minas Tirith was important because Sauron directed his main attack there. If he had sent his primary attack against Erebor or Lothlorien, then either of those would have become the ""most important."" (they were still attacked, of course. But Minas Tirith was where the hammer fell hardest.)  Sauron's goal was never to wipe out Men. I'm simplifying a bit here, but Sauron originally fell because he loved order and hated waste, and thought that he had a better chance of achieving his perfectly ordered world under the tyranny of Morgoth, rather than the rule of the Valar. So he wanted to rule Men and everyone else, not destroy them.  Theoden gathered as many forces as he could, but there was a time crunch. He had to leave with what he had if he was to make it to Gondor in time to help.  As for the rest of Gondor: this was a fairly major plot point that the movies glossed over. Denethor indeed called for the Gondor hinterland to send forces to Minas Tirith, but far fewer came than had been hoped for; the provinces needed to keep the bulk of their strength back because of the threat of the Corsairs. So what happened was that Aragorn brought the Army of the Dead against the Corsairs at the harbor of Pelargir, and defeated them. At this point, Aragorn held their oaths fulfilled, and the dead were released. Aragorn then took the Corsair ships, and with that threat gone, the forces that had been defending against the Corsairs were freed to board the captured ships and sail up the river to Minas Tirith.  And as an aside: the Army of the Dead wasn't the Scrubbing Bubbles of Victory shown in the movie. They were ghosts, and as such, not capable of hurting anything. Their weapon was fear; they sent the Corsairs into a panic, and many drowned in the river, and the rest were easily defeated. This tactic wouldn't necessarily have worked at Pellenor Fields, since the armies of Mordor were driven to attack by their fear of the Witch-King."
lotr,32nn7z,MikeOfThePalace,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:44:15 2015 UTC,"Theoden gathered as many forces as he could, but there was a time crunch. He had to leave with what he had if he was to make it to Gondor in time to help.   More than that, he also needed to leave some behind. When he receives the Red Arrow from Hirgon, Theoden remarked that he might have sent 10,000 men to battle, but now will only come with 6,000 because he must leave some men behind to defend Rohan."
lotr,32nn7z,EyeceEyeceBaby,4,Wed Apr 15 13:18:04 2015 UTC,"Minas Tirith is the capital of the stronghold of Men on Middle Earth. Besides being the most important city to Men, the race that is supposed to be coming to prominence now that the elves are leaving Middle-Earth, it is the stronghold of the line of kings, waiting for the return of a true king instead of the stewards that had been holding power for a while. So taking Minas Tirith would be THE crushing blow against Men. Dwarves wouldn't care. Elves are leaving. Crushing Men would ensure Sauron's dominion.  The bulk of Sauron's attacking force actually WAS sent to Minas Tirith. But it's important to remember that he had armies fighting all over Middle-Earth. Erebor saw a good deal of fighting. It's just that Minas Tirith was his prime target.  As for Rohan, they called as many forces as they could. They had a meeting place and a set amount of time before they couldn't afford to wait any longer.  And Osgiliath was taken. Gondor had no forces there by the Battle of Pelennor Fields. The bulk of Gondor's forces were in Minas Tirith. In the book, Minas Tirith received extra reinforcements from other areas in Gondor.  If any of this is inaccurate, someone feel free to correct me please."
lotr,32nn7z,Aerosteel,2,Wed Apr 15 06:23:30 2015 UTC,"Just look at the position of it. It lies at the end of a mountain range. To the south there is the rest of Gondor and Rohan lies directly to the north. Of course he could just have walked by Minas Tririth, but it's always smarter to conquer strongholds like these before going further."
lotr,32nn7z,Version_1,1 point,Wed Apr 15 09:27:18 2015 UTC,"Minas Tirith was so important not because of the city from without but those within. The Gondorians are the descendants of Elendil and they were, with the possible exception of Rivendell the strongest force not supporting Sauron in Middle-Earth. Sauron's emphasis was on Minas Tirith because he figured that Saruman would wipe out the Rohirrim, and that was the other large force. And he did divide and conquer; he had armies attack Mirkwood, Lothlorien, Dale, Laketown and Erebor. He needed to keep some forces in Mordor or someone could just walk in and destroy him (that did happen anyways though). Rohan only sent 6,000 cavalry because they only had 6,000 cavalry. Other parts of Gondor didn't help because Sauron sent troops to stop them. They came for the battle when Aragorn and the dead freed them.  Hope I Helped"

He had no interest in Eowyn, because for him, there was no competition. He wouldn't have reciprocated her love, other than the love he gave to all the free people, because he didn't want to lead her on or give her the wrong ideas. Aragorn was a top-notch fellow.  Eowyn was a shield maiden, and was trained in combat. She was likely more competent with a sword than the movie portrayed. However, I'm pretty sure Peter Jackson wanted her to seem weaker, timid,  and more vulnerable to make the showdown with the witch king that much more intense.   As for extending the battle longer, no thank you. Peter jackson already invented and interjected extra fight scenes that weren't in the book all throughout the franchise, and this particular scene was fairly true to the book."

This stems from a little artistic license PJ took in the films. In books, Aragorn and Arwen have already ""plighted their troth"" 38 years prior by the time of the War of the Ring. We can't have Aragorn engage Eowyn in her advances, it would be cheating on Arwen! I always loved the Eowyn/Faramir love story anyway. I wish they had delved into it a bit more in the films."

Well, not really, the extended editions show us what the books showed. That's all we need, and no more.   its the only time in the whole trilogy we see a woman actually fight and I think there should have been more of that in the movie, maybe a longer version of the witch king fight?   No, thank you. There is no reason for that whatsoever. Can you not look at Eowynn as a character instead of as a woman? That is not a woman fighting, that is Eowynn, and the character exists regardless of its gender.   was it just me or do you think that she lacked any sort of fighting style?   What do you mean by ""fighting style""? As in, the actor was awkward with a sword? It's always hard to train people to use a weapon in such a short time, in fact, out of all the actors, only Vigo Mortensen (Aragorn) passed the sword course with flying colors.   They could have gotten a double for that, but they didn't do it for any other character in the story, so, I don't disagree with the choice."
lotr,32kqz7,Timiniel,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:40:03 2015 UTC,"I've grown to loathe the character and her inclusion, to be honest. In such a lofty literary work with timeless moral messages, we get this sitcom-level petty crush. For one thing, the book makes perfectly clear that Aragorn is checking her out. Why? This to me lowers my opinion of him as he is committed to Arwen. This is supposed to be one of the most noble men alive here. Also, Eowyn is in my opinion actually one of the emotionally weaker women in the story - she essentially follows them driven by a schoolgirl crush on a man she barely knows who has shown no real interest in her. When she married Faramir it always felt more to me like settling on her second choice because the passion she felt for Aragorn is described and intense but I don't recall reading that regarding Faramir.   From a female perspective, all aspects of her outside of the actual fighting are in my opinion dark spots on the story for me."
lotr,32kqz7,throwitaway7212,0,Thu Apr 16 15:23:02 2015 UTC,I think when you look at the battle of plennor fields as a whole everyone gets equal screen time considering there are about a dozen main characters fighting. I guess the reason why eowyn feels awkward when fighting was because miranda otto wasn't a fighter. She would have just had a crash course on sword fighting and the end result of that is what you get in the movie

Although there are a few scenes left out of it that I wish weren't (Beorn, and the affair of the Arkenstone), it's a much more satisfying adaptation. It's about The Hobbit, and not so much about Thorin's quest. Also the tone is more true to the playful and somewhat lighthearted tone of the book. PJ's adaptation is not only a slave to his LotR universe, but suffers greatly from a desire to make it a more interesting story by modern [epic movie trilogy] standards.

Bilbo was clearly affected by the ring, as can be seen by his lack of aging while it is in his possession, his sudden rapid aging after he abandons it, and his growing desire for it, and he had not been around Gollum for decades. Frodo was affected by the ring before he met Gollum, and his and Bilbo's relative resistance to the ring was due to their being hobbits, not their not being near Gollum. Also men, like Boromir, were heavily affected by the ring, even though they never interacted with Gollum even once. Sure, you might say Gollum was following them so he was nearby, but Boromir was tempted to use the ring themselves against Sauron (an effect of the ring) in Rinevdell, long before Gollum was following them. I understand this article was not meant to be taken seriously, but it seems to only be based on a shallow interpretation of the movies.

After five hundred years, it is very possible that barely any evil powers remained in the Ring at all!   Entropy only increases in an isolated system. It's certainly not isolated to just Gollum and the Ring for all that time, Sauron is more connected to the Ring than any other being!"

lotr,32l2rt,stumpane,2,Tue Apr 14 18:26:13 2015 UTC,I like the way the author thinks but the theory doesn't hold water. Frodo and Bilbo were seemingly unaffected because they didn't use the ring a lot while Smeagol constantly used it to hide from the orcs and hunt an occasional one too which is why the ring corrupted him so much. There surely was malice in the ring which is easily seen by the effect it has on Boromir and to an extent Galadriel too.

If Frodo never got the ring, I would assume Bilbo just decided to keep it.  Maybe Gandalf never realized it was the One Ring and never came to inspect it.  I think in that case the shirelings would be in dire straights.  They may have located/killed Bilbo, found the ring, and taken it to their master.  Now, if BILBO never found the ring, I would assume Golem would still have it.  He kept it secret under the mountain there for a long, long time.

Frodo even asks something to the effect of ""wouldn't it have been better for an Orc to pick up the Ring?"" mistaking Gandalf's sentiment to mean the Ring intended to be found by Bilbo. In fact, if ""chance"" (as I believe Gandalf puts it) hadn't intervened, then likely an Orc would have discovered it and returned it to Sauron. After that it's GG Middle-Earth."

lotr,32fkna,Unlifer,7,Mon Apr 13 11:53:02 2015 UTC,"The One Ring doesn't really give ""powers"" in the ""superhero power"" sense. Invisibility is more of a side effect than a power in this context. To elaborate a little bit, there are at least two planes of existence in Tolkien: physical and spiritual. Beings can exist in one or the other, or both. Sauron, Gandalf and a number of others exist in both. In their case, the Ring would not turn them invisible, they would remain just as they are. If a being exists only in the physical plane, the Ring has the effect of pulling them into the spiritual plane, making them invisible.  As for other powers, it's chief purpose was the domination of others and that's the primary enhancement you would get from it. Sauron designed it as a means of controlling and dominating others, specifically wearers of the other rings (though this plan never really panned out completely). There are other ""side effects"" that would be present though, namely the corruption of your own will to evil. That's why many of the Wise (e.g. Gandalf, Galadriel, Elrond) are so against using it.  If you're interested, Tolkien actually spends a few paragraphs of Letter 246 (p. 331-333) discussing what would occur if Gandalf, Galadriel or Elrond attempted to claim the Ring and use it."
lotr,32fkna,EyeceEyeceBaby,3,Mon Apr 13 14:08:19 2015 UTC,"'In the last need, Sméagol, I should put on the Precious; and the Precious mastered you long ago. If I, wearing it, were to command you, you would obey, even if it were to leap from a precipice or to cast yourself into the fire. And such would be my command. So have a care, Sméagol!'"
lotr,32fkna,dr_amy_bishop,2,Mon Apr 13 20:25:15 2015 UTC,"Sauron forged the One Ring with the purpose of controlling the thoughts and deeds of those who wore the lesser Rings, hoping to gain dominion over the remaining Ñoldor in Middle-earth. However, its secondary function ended up being far more useful to Sauron in the long run. So long as he wore it, it enhanced his power in the same manner that one of the Seven or Nine would do so to its wielder. A person with sufficient willpower and native strength — such as a Maia, Elf-lord, or some lords of Númenórean heritage — could use this power to their advantage. Only someone of such power could fully master the Ring, while others would gain only its side effects of invisibility and long life. If they were to do so, they would become a new Dark Lord, while Sauron would lose his power just as if the Ring were destroyed.  When a typical person put on the ring, he would be partly ""shifted"" out of the physical realm into the unseen realm, walking its threshold. A side effect (but usually the first effect noticed) of this was that it made the wearer invisible to physical beings like living men, but highly visible to other unseen beings like Ringwraiths. This ""unseen world"" was the world the Wraiths were forced to live in but it was also a world in which the Calaquendi held great power.  For mortals, the ring had several side effects, most of them negative. Like the other Great Rings of Power, it would extend the lifespan of its owner indefinitely, but that person, as Gandalf put it, would not grow or obtain more life, but would merely continue, until every minute was an unbearable weariness. One potentially positive effect was that the Ring may have granted the wearer some understanding of the speech of evil creatures. While wearing the Ring, Samwise Gamgee was able to understand the Black Speech used by the Orcs of Mordor.  Gandalf held that if the Ring was worn too frequently, the wearer would become wraith-like over time; entirely subsumed into the spirit world. This would depend largely on that person's race and inner nature. If the Ring was destroyed, the mortal being would begin to age again. Merely keeping the Ring without using it greatly slowed most of the negative effects of the Ring, but it could not do so indefinitely. Additionally, its owner did not need to wear it in order to benefit from it's effects on aging; Bilbo and Gollum both hardly ever used the Ring, yet were both seen to age remarkably well (even in Gollum's case, though his lifestyle and extreme age warped his body in some ways).  The Ring, being essentially an extension of Sauron himself, was evil in nature. The Ring caused those who possessed it to become enthralled by it; parting with it in any permanent fashion was virtually impossible once someone had gotten it. Only Bilbo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee ever managed to give it up of their own accord, and Bilbo needed a great deal of help from Gandalf in order to do so. The Ring seemed to possess at least a limited will of it's own, and could ""call out"" subliminally to other people, in an attempt to get them to pick it up or possibly kill the current owner. It was also capable of changing sizes and could easily slip off of a finger where once it had been tight, with no obvious explanation as to why. Frodo Baggins was warned by Bilbo of this oddity, and kept it on a chain to make sure it never got lost.  The Ring's power grew throughout Frodo's journey, particularly on the last stage of the quest when Sam and Frodo entered Mordor and approached Mount Doom, the place of the Ring's forging.   Besides a partial, if not complete, loss of sanity over time, there were possibly physical consequences of keeping the Ring, as Gollum had been physically ruined by the time of his death; emaciated, pale, and hideous to view. However, it is not certain whether or not this physical transformation was a direct result of the Ring itself, or simply a consequence of Gollum's subterranean lifestyle and the fact that he was nearly five times older than any halfling-esque creature could ever naturally age.    http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/One_Ring"
lotr,32fkna,AnotherSmegHead,2,Mon Apr 13 11:58:51 2015 UTC,And what did Sauron do of the 9 and 2 dwarven? Did he wear all of them to gain other's powers?
lotr,32fkna,AnotherSmegHead,2,Mon Apr 13 12:47:00 2015 UTC,"I don't recall hearing that he did, but as they were designed more to enslave than for their unique properties, he probably doesn't need to wear them himself to achieve his desired goals either."
lotr,32fkna,EyeceEyeceBaby,2,Mon Apr 13 12:52:06 2015 UTC,"Sauron held the 9 rings (to be clear though he did not need to wear them). Without the One he would not have otherwise been able to control the Nazgûl. By holding them, he was able to retain control of them without the One. The Dwarven rings are pretty much retrieved and then left unused (as far as we know)."

He might hypnotize you to make you kill your family or steal something and bring it back to him just for fun, but I doubt he will let you in and out.   Also, you have to realize, Smaug had enemies encroaching outside. He knew this. He only tolerated them because he wasn't bothered.
