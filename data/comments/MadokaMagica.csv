MadokaMagica,3e3khj,frsota,3,Tue Jul 21 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"About 2nd theory: I think that Madoka IS a savior for magical girls, even though she ""destroys"" their soul gems in one way or other.  If magical girl's gem is too corrupted, she (or in more detail - her soul) changes into a witch, as we all know. Then, from now on, the only rescue for her soul is to be killed by another magical girl and eaten by Incubator (we don't know what happens to their souls).  Until then, if she can still think, she would become more and more insane.  Madoka, indeed, kills them. She makes magical girl's gems and bodies disappear to save them from a terrible fate. She probably frees their sould, which is also likely scenario. That's why I think that Madoka is more of a savior and less of a death bringer."

In the one I saw the point of view was at the base of the hill of bodies looking a bit upwards to Homura at the top - who I believe was kneeling.

MadokaMagica,3dtwdc,darklooshkin,3,Sun Jul 19 12:36:28 2015 UTC,"Hmm, this falls flat with further thought. I'm sure in my delusional heaven I wouldn't be a self-hating, spiteful mess of a human being who fucks with her friends while letting my familiars jeer me by throwing rotten tomatoes and creating a habit of throwing myself off great heights in glee. Not to mention as soon as Madoka starts remembering her past state as a law of metaphysics Homura's very sense of reality begins to break.  If this is Madoka's heaven for Homura, it's a pretty shitty heaven."
MadokaMagica,3dtwdc,yahooeny,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:44:46 2015 UTC,"Well, she is pretty screwed up after,  well, everything. And considering the degree to which the whole thing seems designed to fail, I cannot help but feel that it was intentionally designed that way by either Homura or Madoka.  And on balance,  I like to think that it was Madoka who rigged it that way. However,  it could be Homura designed it that way instead in order to eventually push away Madoka when she awakes."
MadokaMagica,3dtwdc,yahooeny,2,Mon Jul 20 06:55:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's a lot more plausible that Homura merely has no idea what the hell she's doing and has unintentionally boned herself.   Her decision to rewrite the law of cycles doesn't stem from some selfless desire to protect Madoka but from a selfish need to gain power in their relationship and be the stronger person, whether usurpation or whatever means. Every time Homura expresses her desire to ""save"" Madoka she always leaves out the detail that Madoka chose this path and is relatively satisfied with her decision. Even at her most intimate moment with Madoka in the near end of the field she chooses, subconsciously or not, to manipulate the info Madoka knows to help justify the decision she probably already committed to.  Sorry, bruh I like Homura too but honestly she just seriously fucked up."
MadokaMagica,3dtwdc,yahooeny,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:15:54 2015 UTC,"That she did, regardless of whether or not the theory actually is more than a load of horseshit."
MadokaMagica,3dtwdc,mcroller,2,Tue Jul 21 02:53:12 2015 UTC,"Also Madoka having made a seperate realm for Homura requires her to have foreseen that Homura would do Really-Fucked-Up-Thing. She didn't have omnipotence due to the barrier made by the Incubators which is why she decided to erase her memories and sneak into Homura's Witch Field with Sayaka and Nagisa.  Unless you're arguing in the two minutes between Homura's Witch Field being broken and Madoka arriving as the Law of Cycles, she instantly knew Homura was about to do the Really-Fucked-Up-Thing in which case.... why... not... just stop Homura from doing the Thing?"
MadokaMagica,3dtwdc,mcroller,2,Tue Jul 21 03:20:35 2015 UTC,Inception type stuff. The universe devil Homura has created for herself is just another dream that Madoka made up for her. Is that what you're saying?
MadokaMagica,3dtwdc,mcroller,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:43:00 2015 UTC,"Kinda. It'd be more of a nested  infinity Homura actually does totally control to me, complete with replicas of, well, everyone.  Gods don't fuck around when it comes to people they like/hate.   Besides, shunting the incubators in there as punishment for screwing with a divinely favoured, deeply troubled war machine they tried to mind screw into betraying the one and only person in the universe she cares about? I like that idea."
MadokaMagica,3dtwdc,Diyonysus,2,Mon Jul 20 07:04:11 2015 UTC,The only setback to this is how the incubators never really got tortured by Homura; that was a delusion in the nested infinity.
MadokaMagica,3dtwdc,luisd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:41:14 2015 UTC,"Oh no, they do get tortured.  See, one of the side benefits of a nested infinty is that it is a fully realised selg-contained universe running on similar,  if not the same, principles as its parent universe. The difference between a dream and a nested infinity is like the difference between a program and a virtual machine.  Homura,  to clarify,  is in control there. The incubators do get their comeuppance.  It's simply the size of the universe she controls that is tiny when compared to madokami's domain.  Madokami would simply make the punishment homura comes up with happen on her domain as well."

It'd be fascinating for me to find out.  Personally for me, Madoka Magica kinda hit close to home when it comes to deals that are too good to be true. Imagine I was Madoka, and my friends who were negatively affected were Mami and Sayaka. I learned what I could to avoid worse cases, while others were pretty much blind to whatever appealing and misleading promises were made to them.  These days, ""the devil is in the details"" is my mantra."

Long story short - I had a friend who left us and I felt like Homura was an extension of my feelings for her. I saw so much of myself in Homura, and in turn so much of my deceased friend in Madoka. It made me realize the purity and the rightness of these feelings. I'm not sure if that made any sense. Basically in short I felt like if I could look at Homura and Madoka and see the real love and caring between them two, why couldn't I allow myself the same and let others know how I feel?"

Kyubey took advantage of that and forced the events of Rebellion. With the help of the others she overcame her despair. However, there still existed her drive. Madoka.   Homura isn't evil, but I think the being she became is. If the entity of Madoka can exist within God madoka (and be torn away), then surely the same can be said of demon Homura. Someone just needs to get through to her again, like in the labyrinth."
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,Brendoshi,3,Sun Jul 12 23:17:43 2015 UTC,"I like your ideas. That bit about getting her back is really interesting, i hadn't thought about that being a possibility.  I for one don't see her demon persona as evil though, at least in my sense of the word, since she seems to not be entirely selfish yet (even the redo of the world is for madoka to be happy) edit: I forgot to say that my justification for this is kinda like kyubey and his analogy with people and livestock, how they're still letting people do their thing and not forcing girls into magic, they do it themselves and how that isn't fundamentally wrong; she's still letting them live their lives out in the end of it with little interference from what i can see"
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,Brendoshi,2,Sun Jul 12 23:38:51 2015 UTC,"I honestly hadn't fully pondered the idea until I saw your question. I also like the idea of both Homura and Madoka getting pulled away from their god forms and having to live in a world they quite literally made.  She could very well not be evil, but she's certainly acting in a way none of the rest of the cast would agree with. Honestly I think I prefer your idea overall. Thinking of Homura as evil doesn't sit quite right with me  I suppose it's unfair to say I can't wait to see where things go, I didn't watch Rebellion until much later than most everyone else (this was mostly due to my own stubbornness in trying to find a copy), but I really cannot wait.  Edit: I've edited this about five times but can't get it worded quite right. Think I need a second watch before I can give a more educated opinion on things :)"
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,Gargoame,2,Mon Jul 13 00:05:40 2015 UTC,Evil is all relative though. Most of the cast minus Madoka don't understand the shit Homura went through/ where she came from (dorky girl with health issues and no friends).  Just like Kyubey its hard to determine if she's evil or not
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,ZacProductions,7,Mon Jul 13 02:00:16 2015 UTC,"The interesting thing is that she thinks she's evil. She thinks she betrayed Madoka, and to her that is the ultimate sin. Yes, her world seems to be better and yes she did it because she loves Madoka, but it will be interesting to see where this self-hatred will take her if we get a sequel."
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,ZacProductions,2,Mon Jul 13 01:07:04 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting actually. I knew she considered herself evil, but I always figured it was because she knew she dethroned a god.   I think it's less self hatred and more self doubt. Like a ""did I really do the right thing for Madoka"""
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,ZacProductions,6,Mon Jul 13 01:57:40 2015 UTC,"I personally think Homura needs more love than she gets in both the show and the fandom. I feel like a lot of people took the way she acted in the final scenes of Rebellion the wrong way. In the flower field scene Madoka had told Homura how much it would hurt her to leave behind her friends the way she did. She wasn't given much of a choice than to separate Madoka from her God form what with the Incubators wanting to control Madoka and bring back witches. Homura acted fast and was under a lot of pressure. She's gotten to the point where she doesn't even care if Madoka hates her for what she did as indicated when she says ""Then one day to too will be my enemy, but I don't care. I'll keep wishing for a world where you can be happy."" Madoka is the only thing she cares about anymore. She's willing to become a demon and have everyone hate her, including the only person she cares for, just to make Madoka happy. She knows her solution is wrong and that it's bound to fail, but she's going to keep trying until she finally has a world were Madoka is safe, even if it means she has to endure all of the pain of Madoka hating her.  It's not well worded, but I'm on mobile and wanted to get my thoughts down, if anyone wants to get even more in depth your welcome to message me."
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,wikingwarrior,2,Mon Jul 13 05:13:36 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda in your boat.   Like at the end of my first Rebellion watch I felt cheated. I felt like homura was public enemy #1 in my eyes. But after a 4th rewatch this weekend of the whole show (note i started liking her just a little around the second rewatch of rebellion. Pre rebellion homura was super cool) I feel like she's just doing what she feels is best for her best and only real friend madoka.   The issue I see with it is it feels very Gendo-esque in the ends justify the means.  (Spoilers for anyone who hasn't seen evangelion)  In evangelion gendo is willing to sacrafice all of humanity to see yui again through instrumentality, much in the way that homura is willing to tear apart a god and create a new world to see madoka again.  And while Homuras actions are certainly less bad they feel much the same (only do it for yourself and the one you love). And while most people wouldn't argue gendo is evil, they'd argue that gendo is wrong in his doings."
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,ZacProductions,2,Mon Jul 13 05:22:16 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like Homura is doing it to be selfish. If she was she'd want to be closer to Madoka. The way they've drifted apart certainly bothers her show by her crying on Madoka's should in episode 11. At this point it's less about having Madoka for herself and more about letting Madoka be happy. She's drifted further from Madoka than ever at this point. I'm worried about how the poor girl would handle Madoka not liking her. She's already used to the hate from Sayaka, Mami, and I guess Kyouko. That's why I said more people need to show her some love, her self loathing has gone to a really horrible place and I can only imagine how awful that must be for her."
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,wikingwarrior,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:30:47 2015 UTC,"I see, I can definately see how she is largely selfless in her actions. I still get the gendo vibe kinda (maybe it's the only having one friend ever) but Gendo was very selfish in his motives.  I do agree she needs much more love btw, people give her so much shit on an issue that isn't black and white. And just like calling shinji ikari a bitch; people can't compare normal happy people with good lives and lots of friends/their ideal character to a character like that."
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,butistillwork,2,Mon Jul 13 05:59:47 2015 UTC,"I'm new to anime so I have no idea who you're talking about, but okay. I've only been in this fandom for like 2 months. I'm glad that my opinion isn't as unpopular as I thought."
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,darklooshkin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:10:52 2015 UTC,"Ah. If you haven't seen Neon Genesis Evangelion the gendo talk is going to go over your head. I thought you had m'bad.   I'd highly suggest you'd see (and the movie End of Evangelion) it as it is in my humble opinion the best anime made to date, due to the depth and realism of its characters, and the message it brings with it, about human interaction and self worth.  It's also one of the most influential and discussed anime ever made, and is very polarizing even among fans of the show. Even 20 years later it's still being hotly discussed.   You might like it if you like madoka, shows that aren't afraid to do stuff that isn't normal (although NGE has been copied a lot over the 20 year lifespan it has had many aspects copied) and espically if you are able to deal with a flawed (mentally) character at beyond face value and even accept them because you realize who they are (eva is not short on flawed characters at all)"
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,darklooshkin,2,Mon Jul 13 06:22:09 2015 UTC,"To be fair that's essentially an entirely different Madoka given her lack of understanding, experience, and context regarding Homura's questions.  Not blaming Homura, she's a little crazy and feels guilty and probably a little betrayed over Madoka's decision (given how hard she fought to keep her from contracting)."
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,wikingwarrior,2,Mon Jul 13 19:03:37 2015 UTC,"It is, but Homura probably uses this as more justification because of the way she said ""I can tell you're the real Madoka."" If anything she feels like she's doing her favor by bringing her back."
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,darklooshkin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:37:49 2015 UTC,"Right, I'm not saying she's wrong or unjustified, just pointing out that line of questioning by her was flawed. Homura's justifications and decisions throughout the movie are arguably the best part."
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,wikingwarrior,2,Mon Jul 13 22:43:32 2015 UTC,"NO SHE IS FLAWLESS BEST GIRL 10/10 HOMUCIFER SAVE US ALL  No really, I mean it. I just don't feel like writing out why. May still do so later."
MadokaMagica,3d27zu,animufuku,2,Mon Jul 13 16:30:53 2015 UTC,"To me, I think she did what she did with the intent of saving Madoka. Her penultimate goal was always this, regardless of the cost.   However, she is immortal now and a mortal Madoka is, well, not. She knows it cannot last.   If Madoka and her friends not age while everyone else does, she runs the risk of 'remembering' things early. So she has to age and watch her friends pass away if the charade is to be maintained.  In the end, Madoka will die too and the game, as they say, will be up.  But that's exactly what Homura always wanted-for Madoka to live out her life without becoming a Puella Magi. After eighty years tops, Madokami will return.  Homura's probably already figured that out. Does she give a shit? I don't think so. With her ultimate goal achieved, the Incubators thoroughly leashed and a lifetime to deal with any problems that might befall Madoka after re-ascension, Homura can position herself as the only viable threat to Madoka herself. Anyone hoping to harm the goddess or her universe would either go to Homura or try and tiptoe around her, which means that Homura can continue playing the villain whilst killing off any actually viable threats.  Why would she do this? Because she would be a credible threat already, making it that much easier to play the villain. Also, because for all her bluster and self-loathing, I believe she actually will continue on the goal she gave herself after Madoka ascended the first time-namely protecting the world Madoka gave her life for.  Even if that means acting out the villain bit.  TL;DR: Sleep deprivation and bias make for happy fun times."
MadokaMagica,3czrz7,LightDragonman1,5,Sun Jul 12 07:03:51 2015 UTC,"I love it.   She doesn't reject both, though.  Yes, the first cave, that of the maze, collapses as her eyes adjust to the light of the real world; but, instead of realizing the superiority of the real world, she sees it as awful, painful, terrible.  So, she turns her back on it entirely and recreates the cave from scratch.  Yes, a little different, but not because she hated the cave, but because she now knows she can (as much as her own mind lets her) make it however she wants, so why not make it even more perfect? And then, just as she was dragged out, she drags people in, trapping them despite their protests, until their eyes adjust to the darkness and they can see how much better this reality is than the other one.  Definitely a twist on the original, but a good one."
MadokaMagica,3czrz7,Domynik,3,Sun Jul 12 21:19:14 2015 UTC,Awesome write up. I can  definitely agree on all those parallels between the older story and rebellion.
MadokaMagica,3czrz7,icefire4114,2,Sun Jul 12 18:58:44 2015 UTC,"I like your post and I do think this type of story is very compelling. The point I'd like to raise is the viewer's perspective and desires.   The narrative emotional force through the whole thing is the impetus for Homura to return to what we know as ""true"". We want the events of the series to matter, and things to be as they were. That's why we rooted for her to escape the Barrier, and that's why it felt so weird when Homura actually didn't want to return to that status quo in the end.  You see the same thing in The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, but I think Kyon's internal decision on what world he wants to live in is shown a bit better that Homura's."
MadokaMagica,3czrz7,ClearandSweet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"The whole Madoka series in general fits this theme, to an extent. It just goes to show how well thought out the Madoka series really is; it's an homage to numerous famous works ranging from Faust to Paradise Lost (with others that I'm sure I'm missing) while still being almost entirely original. Nice write-up!"
MadokaMagica,3czrz7,ReggaeManMurphy,-1,Thu Jul 16 03:13:10 2015 UTC,"I didn't read everything you posted up but I'm aware what the Plato's cave metaphor is. I learned it  from the book To Kill a Mockingbird in my high school English class. Basically, the girls in this anime are stuck in a metaphorical cave in the series, and even more so in Rebellion. If they weren't stuck in Plato's cave then Kyuubey would never have asked them to sign a contract."

MadokaMagica,3czmv5,TheVengefulMany,2,Sun Jul 12 17:30:45 2015 UTC,Yeah creases can be tricky to draw. I just recently got the hang (heh) of it kinda and it still throws me off. Yours look more like lines you'd see to outline muscles as I mentioned above and that's not really a bad thing in this case. Short-sleeved combat uniforms are a thing!

I also added slightly more expression and emotion to her eyebrows as well as her eyes. Again thank you so much for the compliments, it means the world! :3"
MadokaMagica,3ckvhm,slushygames12,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:01:49 2015 UTC,Wow shit... That is pretty amazing for graphite and pen friend. Seriously though. Any pointers for anyone using conventional paper/pencil/pen?
MadokaMagica,3ckvhm,Kumiyo_Nakamori,2,Thu Jul 9 03:41:39 2015 UTC,"Well I always outline my piece in graphite, typically a lighter pencil (HB or maybe 2B) and then if I feel like I need to outline in a darker pencil I typically use a 3B or 4B pencil, however I usually skip that and just outline it in pen. If your piece ever requires a straight line ALWAYS use a straight edge to achieve that (stencils are also really nice for certain shapes). Just be careful when using any ink because it's permanent! So pencils are an artists best friend. :)  Also, when it comes to shading always shade lighter then gradually make it darker. To achieve a universal colored shade I use a smudger (you can purchase one at any art store or simply use a q-tip).   Hope that helps! :) Good luck with your art."

I know looking back into history we always talk about the ""great"" artists of time.. most of whom were nobodies in their actual lifetimes; even failures. I can't imagine the hell you would have to go through to source media/art from the current internet age, from the future."
MadokaMagica,3cgtz4,itaShadd,3,Wed Jul 8 07:41:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I can guess. Artists abandon projects fairly frequently. It may be that they want to move on to a new style or just think that they need a new start since their old stuff isn't up to par but there are plenty of reasons that artists abandon old aliases/work. I produce music as a hobby so I can kind of understand how stuff like this happens. Looking back at old work can be embarrassing for artists that have improved or changed and you have to remember that just because you like it (or a lot of people like it) doesn't mean the artist likes it, and that's all that really matters (unless they're making money from it).

MadokaMagica,3c6low,frsota,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:05:22 2015 UTC,"I've actually been meaning to post it for some time, sorry for stealing your thunder lol  As for overcharge, it works like this: If you roll a 6 you get a natural overcharge (mentioned as an involuntary overcharge in some places), and when this happens you get to roll another 1d6 and add 2 to the damage. (the extra d6 can also overcharge if you're lucky.) You can also choose to make an overcharge, which sets a dice to 6 instead of rolling another, and 2 is added to the damage just like before. Dice set to 6 like this don't trigger natural overcharges. You can overcharge as many dice as you like, but there is a greater cost.  If you use overcharge on a Mundane stat like Strength, then it costs 1 Resolve per overcharge point. If it's a magical stat, your corruption raises 5 points per overcharge in addition to the 1 point for using magic.  Hope this helps!  Edit: Tiny correction."

Madoka Magica     Speed Damage Defense Utility    Mami B (S with magic) C-SS A S   Sayaka A B-A C A   Kyuoko A B-S B A   Homura B C-S C SSS   Madoka A B-S C B      Making this was actually fun, I think they're well balanced to their level at that point in the series (Or.. at the point they lasted). I may make Rebellion if people actually care about this discussion at all.  OKAY. Arterius, I kept Sayaka's C at defense. Why? If Sayaka was attacked by a burst type damage she wouldn't block it, the battle with Elsa Maria shows that she can handle weak hits and she can regenerate quickly, I added that to Utility, giving her an A from a B instead. She didn't go unconcious or in shock because of the mental state she was in, I won't give Mami a B in defense because she was reckless in a fight that got her dead.  Edit: Looking at it.. someone please teach me how to do a table here.  Edit 2: Thread got sticky, I don't people looking at the mess that it once was. So why not add Rebellion too?    Madoka Magica: Story of a Rebellion     Speed Damage Defense Utility    Mami B (S with magic) C-SS A (S?) SS   Sayaka S B-A C S   Kyuoko A B-S B A   Homura B C-S C SSS   Madoka A B-S C B      Rebellion Spoilers  Doesn't seem like much changed, Mami got a SS in Utility because Rebellion spoilers  Sayaka seems like.. she became strong. She was able to Rebellion spoilers, those are buffs to her Speed and Utility.  Most of the reasons why the rest of the magical girls are still the same is because Rebellion spoilers"
MadokaMagica,3banjk,Arterius_N7,4,Sat Jun 27 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"You mean like this?  You can klick ""source"" to see the formatting.     Speed Damage Defense Utility    Mami B (S with magic) C-SS (Bitches love cannons) A S   Sayaka A B-A C B B   Kyuoko A B-S B A   Homura B C-S C SSS   Madoka A B-S C B      On another note, I'm sensing some favourite bias here. Wouldn't Sayakas sword blocking and amazing regenerative abilities (and ability to block out pain (not go unconscious or into shock), meaning she will stay standing when others would fall) count for at least a B or even an A?  Defense/Endurance is just not how hard you can get hit. It's also how long you can keep going after the fact you got hit; repeatedly.  I'd pick A.  Other than that I basically agree with you."
MadokaMagica,3banjk,Artunique,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:23:48 2015 UTC,"UTILITY! I tried to remember it but totally forgot.  Next time I need something I will try calling you, that looks much, much nicer.  About that bias.. huh.. maybe. Kyouko was able to catch Sayaka in their fight from Ep. 5 (Most likely due to her being reckless) and it was established in Ep. 4 she was pretty fast, I still gave Kyouko A because she is a veteran (More XP) and she has to be fast to get personal with her target.  I may have forgotten about Sayaka's regen.. yeah.. bump that to B. Kyouko has that because she can make cages and that can work as a shield, meanwhile most of the others don't show a single defensive ability, sword/spear/muskeet blocking doesn't count.  I said that I may have nerfed Sayaka's stats because this isn't Rebellion, where she has a dumb speed and better utility. Now REsoleSurvivor will tell me how much I nerfed Homura.."
MadokaMagica,3banjk,Arterius_N7,3,Sun Jun 28 03:13:10 2015 UTC,"Now REsoleSurvivor will tell me how much I nerfed Homura..   Haha, yeah maybe."

MadokaMagica,3banjk,Artunique,3,Sat Jun 27 22:25:58 2015 UTC,"Idea.   We're making stats for MM girls. This means we have numbers, abilities, and pretty much all the information to make a game/rpg.  What if /r/MadokaMagica had a CSS game-type thing where you could be a Magical Girl and battle other users?  Food for thought."

MadokaMagica,3banjk,Arterius_N7,2,Sat Jul 4 02:02:37 2015 UTC,"Why not keep them all together?  Witches would be the big bad bosses, familiars would be rare encounters and spectres would be random encounters. Nightmares would be other users in a PVP fashion (We don't want others stabbing you during your sleep).  Give users warnings through their own soul gem (These would be private messages) if they're nearby a familiar or a witch, since they're moving in areas they can keep those to themselves if they wish to gather their own goods.  Oh, and make users die if they are inactive (A month?) or don't get a grief seed (You'd get the first warning at 50%). If they actually leave with a good reason they go into stasis."

However, think about it for a minute. Sure, Mami just died and they're sad and feel horrible about it but more than anything I think Madoka and Sayaka were terrified. It kind of acted as a wake up call to both of them about just how dangerous it could get. They're not going to put themselves in that position after watching their friend get her head chomped off even if it means bringing her back to life because at that point they were too afraid to do it. In one of the episodes after Mami dies Sayaka asks Madoka if she still wanted to become a magical girl and Madoka just shakes her head, starts crying and says something like ""When I think about how Mami died..."" and then starts sobbing. So I think it's safe to say that it scared them out of it. Sorry if any of the details are wrong, it's been a while since I've watched the series."
MadokaMagica,3b95cz,TheGhostlyBagel,14,Sat Jun 27 00:09:22 2015 UTC,"Considering what EVENTS TOOK PLACE, I'd say it's definitely possible to resurrect someone. You're right, Mami's death basically scared Madoka so much that she's now unwilling to contract.

Especially with the shy little ""...Madoka <3"" at the end.  Even though she's a demon now, I still believe there's a squishy little Moemura deep down in her heart."

And here is a download for Chinese scans of the same chapter.  I don't know why an English scanlation is taking so long, but I guess we just have to be patient."

MadokaMagica,3avsp2,PoniesRBitchin,15,Tue Jun 23 22:14:43 2015 UTC,"There's a new manga being serialized now, called The Wraith Saga, that takes place between the series and Rebellion.  Scanlations are hopefully to come.  There haven't been any announcements or even hints about another season, movie, or even an OVA, so as far as animated media goes, don't expect anything new.  That said, there are two things to keep in mind: 1. Everything Madoka brings in crazy amounts of money, so there's always incentive to make more Madoka.  2. The Rebellion Story came out in October 2013, two years after the original series was released.  It's now been nearly two years since Rebellion was released, so a lot of people suspect an announcement of something big to come soon(ish)."
MadokaMagica,3avsp2,man_and_machine,5,Tue Jun 23 22:59:57 2015 UTC,Man even if something came next year I'd be mega-pleased. I'm gonna go with patience being a virtue here especially with the Tart manga and what you mentioned being in our near futures.

Shaft made bank with Rebellion, so I would imagine there would be at least OVAs or something eventually. Or maybe they're putting all that ¥¥ towards Kizumonogatari."

It's been two years. If something is going to happen, it will be announced before year's end. If it isn't, don't hold your breath. SHAFT isn't exactly going bankrupt from riding Nisio Isin, and I wouldn't bet on them doing anything BIG with Madoka until that condition is met."

MadokaMagica,3ar781,gianttabby,6,Mon Jun 22 21:14:51 2015 UTC,I had a similar thot when I finished the movie. It's almost like the entire principle of Rebellion is to show the darker side of the relationship Homura cultivated as her entire reason for being in the original series. It also seems to undo a lot of the hopeful endings the main series gave us... but maybe it's just to say that there's a duality in all emotions? I'm not really sure.
MadokaMagica,3ar781,5lash3r,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:12:28 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I would say the original series left a ""hopeful"" ending. Sure, Madoka remade the magical girl system to come closer to the genre's more optimistic approach, but that didn't stop a new threat from replacing witches. And let's not forget that after-credit scene where Homura wandered around a barren land fighting wraiths while glowing with a witch's colors. Hope can only take a person so far in life given the situation."

MadokaMagica,3ar781,enigmatican,2,Tue Jun 23 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"The only reason Homura hadn't become a witch, is because she held onto hope that she could save Madoka.  If Madoka disappears, Homura loses that hope and becomes a witch.  Homura has to do whatever she can possible do to keep Madoka around."

Oriko Magica...The art style put me off a bit at first, but it turns out to be surprisingly touching. Kyoko is a main character again and she shines in the spotlight."

If you want to go the extra distance you could use some bold and italics for empahsis. For instance using bold on ""1)"".  Also, you probably need to put the text for the discussion in the post. A lot of people probably wont bother downloading a textfile. Also odt? Is that OpenOffice? Because I don't think I have that and I'm not sure if it still does but last time I tried to open one of those in word it didn't work. Even if you have to make a continuation comment with the rest of the text I'd still prefer that. One way you could connect them is to link the permalink for the comment at the end of the post.  Also, you still seem quite hyper, just take a deep breath and relax a little bit. We are all people here so just relax and have a possibly nice discussion (depends on how active/interesting it get's). Your text gives me this impression, mostly due to a liberal use of exclamation marks and some words in all caps (and lacking paragraphs).  And don't worry about replies, people don't expect you to give immediate replies. Just do it in a timely manner if you participate in the discussion (so maybe not next week, but within a day or two is cool)."

(Click SOURCE first to get the formating and everything then copy-paste it) and don't forget to remove my comments in italics first ;)    Basic rules & suggestions for the weekly discussion thread:  1) Be nice to people even if they don't agree with your opinions. If you disagree then try to discuss why your opinions differ and understand what their point of view is.  2) If someone tries to troll, please ignore them.  3) Even though it's weekly discussion threads it doesn't mean that you can't respond to older threads if they are still active. Nothing wrong with more discussion :)  4) Try not to go off-topic. if you feel that your topic is worthy of elaborating on then feel free to send it in as a suggestion for future discussion threads.  5)If you have suggestions about future topics or the structure of the discussion thread then feel free to mention it in your reply. [Just a note here, it would probably be easier if you had some comment for taking topics and feedback which they could comment under. Keeping everything in one place. You could permalink the comment here for convenience.]  6) I'm infinitely sorry if I can't be accurate with the time or the exact date of the release of the weekly discussion threads everytime. I have other things to do like work or other stuff... but anyway I try to be as precise as somehow possible whenever I can !  I apologize for possible inconsistencies regarding when I post these threads. I'll try to stick to a schedule :) [That's probably not an issue, just relax.]  7) If there are problems with the dropbox link  please send me a mail to the following adress : francois.le.heros@hotmail.fr . If you have suggestions for other Puella Magi projects , please contact me too.  8) I'm sorry if you can't understand my english very well. I'm not a native english speaker but I try to be comprehensive and clear regarding the things I write.  9) I will try to continue with these threads and eventually other projects as long as I have time for it.  10) I'm also sorry if I can'r reply to you in a timely manner but real life comes first. I hope you understand :)  I think that's it for now. If I notice the need for more rules I'll add them.   Regarding myself, I also have a youtube account where I make amv's about PMMM which I try to upload on a weekly basis. So feel free to check that out, I would love the hear your oppinions on it.

MadokaMagica,3aay75,Arterius_N7,3,Fri Jun 19 12:29:38 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know what kind of sword Sayaka actually uses?   EDIT: so either Cutlass or Sabre, one for sea faring folk. does make sense considering the water theme she has....besides the fact she has blue hair."
MadokaMagica,3aay75,patchesyar,3,Thu Jun 18 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"Think it was a form of sabre, supposeldy one of the naval variety. Supposedly that's a pirate saber, or used by pirates in any case."
MadokaMagica,3aay75,Arterius_N7,6,Thu Jun 18 19:35:49 2015 UTC,"First off: official art of the sword  The two best sword types to describe it are either sabre or cutlass. Both are very similar, featuring a large handle with a prominent hand guard, making them excellent skirmishing weapons, quiet fitting for Sayaka's fighting style.   As for which of the two it technically is, a sabre is traditionally a cavalry weapon, longer and curved. A cutlass is generally shorter, broader, and straighter.  In this regard I'd probably consider the sword to be a cutlass. Her sword is very straight, curving only a few inches behind the back of the tang. The blade is quite broad as well. We're never given a proper measurement on her blade's length, but based on her size it might make more sense to say that it's the length of a sabre.   TL;DR: the PMMM artists have no idea what they're drawing"
MadokaMagica,3aay75,SoldierofNod,2,Thu Jun 18 22:49:38 2015 UTC,Alright. I agree that it's definitely not a pure saber and that a combination of the two is most likely.
MadokaMagica,3aay75,CarVac,2,Thu Jun 18 22:57:04 2015 UTC,"actually, we can only speculate about it because ( at my knowlegde ) it isn't said nowhere in the anime or said in any canon thing... so we don't know and can only speculate about it ... maybe we will have a answer for an eventual saison 2.  Ty for being the first one to answer! does the dropbox link fuction well?"
MadokaMagica,3aay75,wikingwarrior,2,Thu Jun 18 19:18:19 2015 UTC,It's pretty neat that she can go Unlimited Blade Works with it but it's unfortunate it's not really useful for anything special. Except throwing. God knows how the aerodynamics of that work.

MadokaMagica,3a52s4,gianttabby,5,Wed Jun 17 08:03:00 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that their wishes are capable of bending reality to match their deepest desire.  Homura wanted too freeze time into a single moment -- not just to save Madoka, but to experience, over and over again, the wonder of meeting her friend for the first time.  Kyouko, after her wish failed, lost many of her powers -- but she gained the ability to compartmentalize with a barrier of spears, as she wished she had been able to do before.  Mami's ribbons are a symbol of connection to the world, e.g. Red Ribbon of Fate.  Homura's arsenal that you brought up -- I'd argue that's something she developed, in time.  As she grew used to the idea of utilizing specific tools for specific circumstances, her magic adapted to provide her with that capability.  It definitely seems like a pocket dimension, but not one that can be used offensively -- she never fills it with water to flood a building, or anything like that.  It's only there as a giant toolbox.  She is able to fish out exactly what she wants because the arsenal is an extension of her magic, and therefore, an extension of her will.  It gives her the weapon it knows it needs.  TLDR magic is a reality-warping extention of the magical girl's will.  It gains whatever powers their unconscious mind desires.  I think.  But really, it's impossible to say."
MadokaMagica,3a52s4,Sa_Rart,2,Wed Jun 17 18:15:23 2015 UTC,"Someone give this guy/girl/other a Nobel Prize, because this is the most plausible explanation for Madoka Magica's magic."
MadokaMagica,3a52s4,Sa_Rart,3,Wed Jun 17 19:35:27 2015 UTC,I live for the day that one could earn a Nobel Prize for Madoka material.
MadokaMagica,3a52s4,Elvenoob,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:42:02 2015 UTC,That's a very good explanation as for why Sayaka grew weaker as she lost her self-confidence... And we all know where THAT went...
MadokaMagica,3a52s4,mashibana,8,Thu Jun 18 03:49:31 2015 UTC,"They call it 'magic' but it's more like 'really really advanced science that fucks with people's emotions'.  About the powers, I think what you get depends on your personality + the wish you made."
MadokaMagica,3a52s4,carlyfannyonyourface,4,Wed Jun 17 10:04:25 2015 UTC,I know that aside from their weapons they get a power depending on what wish they made. As for the weapons I have no idea.
MadokaMagica,3a52s4,shinyskarmory,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:00:45 2015 UTC,"For weapons, specifically, I think the weapon each magical girl gets is somehow tied to what they want to do as a magical girl, which is different from their wish.  As an example, Sayaka made her wish for Kyosuke, but her weapon reflects what she wants to use her magic for. She wants to be a hero of justice who protects the people, so she gets swords because heroes always use swords.   Meanwhile, Homura's wish was to protect Madoka, which coincidentally is what she wants to use her powers for. As a result, she uses a shield."
MadokaMagica,3a52s4,carlyfannyonyourface,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:41:25 2015 UTC,Makes sense!
MadokaMagica,3a52s4,GoGoCircleNine,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the weapons. Would be nice to know how that and their clothes are provided."
MadokaMagica,3a52s4,GoGoCircleNine,2,Wed Jun 17 14:22:08 2015 UTC,"It's sort of explained with Sayaka's and Mami's powers.  Her wish is to heal another provides her with a deeper well of health even compared to the other girls in the series.  Mami's wish for life means she needs far less Grief Seeds to purify herself.  Everything is a reflection of the wishes and dreams of the girl in question.  There is a degree of ""its magic, I ain't gotta explain shit."" with the hammerspace.  Though, it seems like a power they almost all get (at least Mami uses it for her flourish kills) similar to witch finding."
MadokaMagica,3a52s4,proindrakenzol,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:12:03 2015 UTC,So wishes affect the magical girls' powers. Got any idea about how Kyubey helps makes it so? I mean it seems as though his race can do anything.

I find this idea SUPER SUPER cool and I tried to introduce this idea  a month ago on Walpurgischan and people have said that I'm a crazy guy and that I have some obsessions about that anime and that I should kill myself...... But I would be REALLLYYYYYYY happy if this happened here ! You have my eternal gratitude from the bottom of my heart ! Thanks man really ! Should I begin a discussion next weak ?  this week maybe? I have also suggested on walpurgischan that we could go for that on a new forum/site.... would this be a idea ?  but anyway if we can do it here it would be great ! let me know if you want some help for organization topics or something else !

Tell me, who are some good writers to follow on the typical fanfic sites like Ao3, FFnet, and Tumblr? I am open to any pairings, though I prefer yuri over het for more mature stuff. Good writing is a must, dark fics don't bug me, but crossovers/readerxcharacter/Kyubey/rapefics are out."
MadokaMagica,3a32au,Sa_Rart,3,Wed Jun 17 19:13:55 2015 UTC,"Aye. Fanfiction reader here.  I was on vacation and didn't even realized I was called out, but I've got a couple writers that some good fics and some nice one shots as well. -Keep in mind that this list is not in order because I just went through my favs and follows-  One-Shots/Scenes  Magical Challenges-Multiple oneshots mainly comedy and a lot of OOC  ""Homura Made Me Do This"" is an author with a few good oneshots and would recommend for feels. -and some nsfw I think-  Bong Bong Bong's ""Country of Sweets"" fic. It's a sorta fluff, sorta feel series of oneshots that somewhat tie together in a Post Rebellion setting. I think it's pretty nice. Ongoing  Lynx Hates Everything has a some good one shots and a main one shot collection fic called ""MadoHomu Collection"". Pretty Self explanatory.  Good Writers and Stories-  Cynical Banshee's ""Silent Melody""Fic Pairing:KyouHomu. Involves Homura dealing with Post Rebellion events with Kyouko and Mami. Ongoing  Rumiberri and all the feel fics. All Madohomu. Mostly one shots but there's a couple ongoing longer ones that are totally worth.  JR Salazar's ""Ding Dong"" fic. Sorta hard to follow but fluffy MadoHomu in a good way. Completed  xMad.Hatterx007's ""Stargazing"" Fic. This one I ABSOLUTELY LOVE. Have read this one shot. I thought it was pretty poetic and certainly provides a good end. Disregards Rebellion events though  Already recommended but Hieronym's to the Stars has fabulous world building and brings our girls hundreds of years into the future told through an OC Protagonist. Extremely well written. Ongoing Fic  This author known as MadoHomu has pretty much all yuri Madoka Magica fics which can vary from being weird-poorly written- fics to nice and fluffy fics. Recommended for comedy and fluff. The author has a vast collection of written works though  TakerFoxx's ""Resonance Days"" fic. It's KyouSaya, and it's a fic about their time in the afterlife between their deaths and probably Madoka's wish-because time works differently in the afterlife-. It's certainly an adventure because some afterlife people are after them. Ongoing  Hecacarrotcakes's ""All but Forgotten"" fic. This is a non-fix timeline fic where Homura forgets her memory on start of the timeline.  redlerred7's ""The Consequence of Failure"" shorter fic. It details a timeline with detailed descriptions of Homura's thoughts and what she does this timeline. Ongoing. -I'm Sad that it hasn't updated in a while-  VoyeurtheNinja's fics. I haven't read most of his fics but he's got a few of them and a big ongoing fic that I've read being ""Protector Servorum : The Puerum Magi"". I didn't stay too interested in it after I got the most recent chapter though.  An author called Dessert Maniac has some nice fics and a main on called ""The Bodyguard and the Client"", it's mainly AU and pretty much abandoned. Ok to check it out if you'd like.  Azecreth is a good writer and has many fics. Mostly oneshots, but there's some crossovers to browse if you're interested. I particularly liked ""Afterimages""-oneshot- and ""Math and Other life lessons""-Ongoing series-  I just realized how many links I just put up and how many more I can still add. There are a couple spinoffs on the ""To the stars"" world that are very well written as well and I would recommend.  I think this could be a post on it's own, so if anyone wants to post this as one you have my permission lol.  I hope this list helped if it wasn't too confusing, since I alternated between posting fic links and author links where I thought one over the other was more helpful for the aspiring reader.  Enjoy!  Edit: I feel like I didn't add enough lol. I still have more."

MadokaMagica,3a32au,Sa_Rart,2,Sun Jun 21 02:26:10 2015 UTC,hi ! sorry but I'm not really interested in fanfics so I can't help you very much but I have at least something.... maybe that is something what you're looking about.... if not I'm really sorry about it.    http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Magia_Series

MadokaMagica,3a32au,Sa_Rart,2,Wed Jun 17 20:12:42 2015 UTC,"On fanfiction, I'd recommend rumiberri; this is a good example of the sort of mood and style.  Mostly MadHomu stories.  All good stuff.  Hieronym's To the Stars is 500,000 words of epic.  It's OC based, but both Mami and Kyouko are prominent figures of peerless authority, and Homura, while MIA, represents a significant part of the plot.  Madokami is very relevant.  Worth reading, especially if you're looking for immersion."
MadokaMagica,3a32au,wanderingscribe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:00:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I liked Breathe a lot. Very nice, though I'd like someone who writes more than one or two pairings.  I'll pass on the longer fic. OCs don't interest me as much as the main cast unless they're really, really well written."
MadokaMagica,3a32au,PrinceRazor,2,Thu Jun 18 00:03:56 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with you on principal, but given how prominent the main cast and how intricate the worldbuilding, I found this one worth reading.  But if not, then there's not a any giants to follow that I'm aware of -- not any that might interesting a wandering scribe, at least.  This author I've always enjoyed, but she's not writing anymore, I don't think.  Cynical Banshee's pretty decent.  There's not much else that comes to mind offhand.  The archive isn't exactly Harry Potter levels of popular."
MadokaMagica,3a32au,Sa_Rart,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:07:42 2015 UTC,"I guess it comes down to not wanting to invest in a giant work where the main character doesn't appeal to me. I read through some of the first chapter - it was well written, but dull.  It's a shame that ZipCode won't be updating with more fics, but I thoroughly enjoyed All the Time in the World and Heaven is a Zombie Apocalypse. Thank you for the link.  Haven't tried Cynical Banshee's stuff yet, but the fics look promising, if a bit scarce.  Shame about that. And there's no need to place such importance on my username; it's just a reference to an old habit I had when I was a writer. When I found myself suffering from writer's block, I would take long walks to clear my head.  Instead of clearing my head, I found myself thinking more than usual. Ideas would sprout and grow the farther I walked until I didn't find myself blocked anymore. In fact, I'd often have more ideas than ever."

Speaking of Rebellion...  I feel so mixed about it. It was both a satisfactory ending, and not one. Part of me wants more and sees the ending as a cliffhanger, the other part of me sees it as a very good ending that you just need to read between the lines to see, and hence would rather not have anything come after it.  So with that said, I think it would be a good idea to have discussions about Rebellion every now and then.  Btw, which Madoka related media should I read/watch next?"

MadokaMagica,39tirv,gianttabby,3,Mon Jun 15 06:06:30 2015 UTC,No one has mentioned Kimi no gin no niwa (Your Silver Garden) yet? It's an absolutely perfect ending to the series because it summarizes the relationship between Homura and Madoka in a way that only music can.  Bonus piano cover if you haven't heard it already.

I mean, it's a legitimately well written and well thought out show. What do I have to be ashamed of?  My friends might tease me about it on occasion, but I've seen it with them too, and they enjoyed it. So it's all good.   edit after checking your list, you'll definitely enjoy it.

MadokaMagica,39sgnb,InquisitorDianne,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:27:06 2015 UTC,"To be honest when I first heart about madoka I didn't know what to expect, the designs for the girls were done be the same person that did hidamari sketch and the script by the same person that did saya no uta. Those two things seemed like a contradiction to each other, but I liked both so I went and checked it out. It seemed slow at first but then picks up after episode 3, thats when the show really started to get interesting. I enjoyed how it explored the reasons each character decided to become a magical girl, and the plot was certainly not something I was expecting, it felt fresh and kept me intrigued. Overall I think its definitely something to check out."
MadokaMagica,39sgnb,nbmon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:34:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you made a decision yet, but let me try to sway you. I see most of these as reasons to watch, but they might not be for everyone.   At twelve episodes and a movie, it's pretty short and rewatching is easy. Its rewatchable.  Something like Utena or Higurashi present a lot of the same level of subtext and deconstruction, they are both a little long to watch a second  or third. its popular and understandable enough for both the US and Japan that I feel it's an important show to see for the sake of discussing anime for the next couple years at least.  It may or may not be criterion level, but it's good.   If you give it a shot, give it at least 3 episodes to decide if you are on board.  That's the point where you'll know if it's for you.  Edit: my biggest gripe is Madoka has about as much agency as Renton from Eureka.  It's explained and kind of justified, but I wish she was a little more active in the action."
MadokaMagica,39p43q,Lingenfelter,6,Sat Jun 13 11:35:17 2015 UTC,"And you see, through it all, the Incubators also completely, utterly, dangerously…full of shit.   Actually, this is the opposite of true. In the main series, ultimately the point came down to that nothing they said was a lie. The worst they did was selectively leave out information they knew would make people reject them. They really were saving the universe by this. And homura, revealed to be selfish all along was fighting against this simply because she didn't like that she would have gotten the short end of the stick otherwise. Homura even pretended to be non emotional herself. She was doing this so long that she pretended to be like kyubey on the outside, even though it was acting for good reasons, and she was for purely selfish ones. And the ending isn't them toppling an evil regime. Its literally them in their mad bumbling screwing over the universe for personal benefit. But like kyubey says about them being the ones who get the short end of the stick is that its a reality that no one else understands their suffering, so you can't really judge them even if they are doing something that is ultimately wrong. And the narrative plays into this. Every single step implies that they were doing something wrong. But its hard to judge them for it all the same. Since the scope of the benefit was simply too large and abstract for them to even understand.   The interesting part of the plot is that it seems the writers realized that this was the case despite perhaps not actively trying to make it be. In the very end you see the kyubey in the new world panic more over energy collection. Despite being identified as having no emotions. Which shows that in this universe there's literally civilizations dying out as they speak. Something they had managed to prevent in the main one. The show represents this as trivial despite the honesty of them in terms of what they say ultimately meaning that they were right all along."
MadokaMagica,39p43q,bunker_man,2,Sat Jun 13 13:33:27 2015 UTC,"I'd more argue that Homura was fighting for her version of reality that she believed to be best for Madoka. Not exactly selfish except in the fact that she never really councils Madoka properly on what she wants.  They do also argue that Earth will benefit from this and then straight up say ""Oh well, it's humanities problem now,"" when things go to hell.  I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you, but I think both sides have selfless and selfish things about them. It's part of why it's so good."
MadokaMagica,39p43q,wikingwarrior,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:03:10 2015 UTC,"Selfish means more than just doing things for your literal personal self. If you hurt five random people to help someone close to you, its still selfish. Because what actually differentiates the person close to you from the three? Intellectually you'd have to admit that its nothing. You care about them more because of their relation to you, and what they mean for you. So doing something for them at the expense of others is still selfish. Which is something that a lot of people struggle to realize because their scope of who they should care about literally extends no further than people close to them, and so they see it as the less selfish alternative, not realizing that this is because they are so self focused that they can't see the big picture.   For madoka herself it implies that she wasn't necessarily overtly selfish, but simply didn't understand the scale of what was going on. When the reason behind everything was explained to her, she couldn't even make a real response saying it was wrong, but just broke down and made emotional appeals about how cold it was. So in her case, there is some selfishness, but its less overt. For homura though, her selfishness was more overt. She was obsessed with madoka, and didn't care about anything but saving her, with the world being saved being effectively incidental. In one of her pasts when she thought they were going to die, she even overtly told madoka how little she cared about anyone else, and said they should destroy the world together as witches. She may still too not understand the scale of protecting the universe since its too abstract to her, but where to madoka it ame off more like not understanding only, with homura it comes off like she openly realizes that there's something she could hypothetically be understanding, but chooses not to care.   Also, selfishness is a big theme in the series, since one of the points is that humans by their nature struggle not to be, even when trying to be. Even the girls who with their wish thought they were being selfless by making it ""for someone else"" are revealed to have been ultimately doing it because they wanted something personal all along. Sayaka didn't want what's his name to be healed. She wanted him to be healed so that they could be together. And she feels cheated when that didn't happen, because it was never purely meant to be a gift for him himself. It was for what he meant to her. Kyouko obviously did the thing for her dad because of what he meant to her as well, etc. All homura's actions should be viewed in the same light. This is highlighted by the fact that the kyubeys on the flipside are a totally selfless race. Even though they're an entire race, they consider themself one entity, and their individual deaths to be not a huge deal, if its for the greater good. Death in the line of duty to them is just a thing that happens. And the things they do aren't for ""themself"" but for the universe at large. They even point out that if they could, they would be doing what they do to themselves. They do say they're willing to let madoka take over earth, but this too is meant to show the pure scale they're thinking on. Homura accidentally turned madoka into a self regulating loop of so much energy that getting access to it would mean so much that the loss of one planet was still for the greater good. Which isn't showing that they're bad, but rather that the god they are doing is so insanely immense in scale that it highlights what fighting against it actually means.  In the end, what is being seen is that while people talk day to day about selflessness, actual universal selflessness where something has no emotional biases and coldly works towards the best good comes off as so cold and alien that its hard to sympathize with, and people react against it. Even how small and insignificant it makes them personally feel makes them get emotionally bent out of shape. Its natural for people to not want to accept that the universe may be so large that they (meaning not just as individuals, but their whole planet) are expendable for its benefit. But it can simply be true. And the narrative implies that here it was. So the narrative implies that its reasonable for them to act out even though their actions can be wrong in the objective sense. Since like kyubey says, that's something people who are suffering just do, and which people who aren't can hardly sit around judging them for, when they don't know what their suffering is like. But understandable =/= for the best. And its left ambiguous what its trying to make you think about the sequence of events."

MadokaMagica,3947pw,FullmetalCowgirl,8,Tue Jun 9 21:18:37 2015 UTC,"If we're living in the world Madoka created, then my wish would just be to become a magical girl.  That'd be enough for me.  I'd live a great and exciting life as a magical girl, and at the end I'd be redeemed and join Madoka and all the rest as a part of the Law of the Cycles.  I suppose it'd be a bit of a waste for that to be my wish.  But I don't know what else I might wish for."
MadokaMagica,3947pw,man_and_machine,3,Tue Jun 9 05:06:24 2015 UTC,I was tempted to make a wish like that at first but it just would seem too boring. Thanks for coming up with your own wish though :P. Also what weapon would you wield?
MadokaMagica,3947pw,man_and_machine,3,Tue Jun 9 06:35:31 2015 UTC,"A bow, probably. I envision that wish making me the quintessential magical girl, and that would likely mean I'd use a bow. Which would be pretty nice."
MadokaMagica,3947pw,homu,6,Tue Jun 9 14:37:50 2015 UTC,Homura be happy.
MadokaMagica,3947pw,winterd,5,Tue Jun 9 09:51:07 2015 UTC,Can I wish for more wishes?
MadokaMagica,3947pw,winterd,2,Tue Jun 9 21:39:15 2015 UTC,hmm
MadokaMagica,3947pw,JubJub87,2,Wed Jun 10 00:00:37 2015 UTC,what di you think?
MadokaMagica,3947pw,JubJub87,2,Wed Jun 10 00:00:49 2015 UTC,"Yes! Grant my wish, incubator!"
MadokaMagica,3947pw,JubJub87,2,Wed Jun 10 00:48:12 2015 UTC,He is staring at you with anger now lol xd
MadokaMagica,3947pw,darklooshkin,5,Wed Jun 10 01:48:28 2015 UTC,I think your wish would end with Kyubey just asking them to make another wish. The incubators are greedy. And you would need to be powerful enough to make that huge of a wish.  Don't know what my wish would be. Immortality sounds pretty sweet. If I would be powerful enough to make that wish though.
MadokaMagica,3947pw,Breakfast_Explosion,2,Tue Jun 9 04:00:58 2015 UTC,hmm that would be hard. You do have a good point though.At the time I thought about this I thought the specific part would help deal with that. hmm I guess having a magical name would not help in this situation helping me become more powerful lol xd
MadokaMagica,3947pw,darklooshkin,2,Tue Jun 9 04:31:25 2015 UTC,But wouldn't the incubators not know what would be on the paper if part of my wish is that they do not know what is on the paper. Also BTW since I forgot to mention it. My name would be Mahō Shōnen Rune Magika lol xd I guarantee you are gonna pronounce my name wrong in my head the first time til you see this text as well :P
MadokaMagica,3947pw,skylar__,2,Tue Jun 9 04:44:22 2015 UTC,"Who knows. That could be a loophole. If you could trick the Incubators who are borderline gods lol. The wish still has to overpower entropy, like if your batteries don't have enough juice they can't power the remote.  Rune is a pretty cool name though. I am surprised none of the girls in the series used nicknames."
MadokaMagica,3947pw,rainbow-sailor,2,Tue Jun 9 05:39:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess it is but it can get a bit annoying when it is your real name and people always mispronounce sometimes on purpose or they make jokes about it. BUt at least I can make jokes about it too :P. Now on to the real thing, just because they are god does not mean they can defy everything. Based on who they are they still have to and in fact may even purposefully follow laws of rational just have more ability to do what we would consider supernatural but likely follows its' own laws"
MadokaMagica,3947pw,Valiantttt,2,Tue Jun 9 06:34:07 2015 UTC,"It is your actual name? And how is it pronounced? Not like ""Roone""? Like someone would say a magic rune.  Right, they do follow a set of rules. Kyubey says to Madoka that she is powerful enough to make any wish that she wants, which would imply that others are not powerful enough to make ANY wish. But by all means in this hypothetical question we could be one of those that are able to make any wish. I was just kind of stuck thinking in the dark tone of the series. But by all means a hopeful wish like yours probably could be done."
MadokaMagica,3947pw,FiveOfTime,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:46:06 2015 UTC,Yeah it is my actual name being half-Norwegian. It is pronounced like a combination of how most american would pronounce it which is Rune(or kinda how you spelled it I guess) and then the Ah. If you want to be fully correct you would pronounce the R as a rolling R but not like a Spanish one more like a norwegian accent
MadokaMagica,3947pw,FurbyTime,4,Wed Jun 10 00:09:15 2015 UTC,"I would wish for technological omnipotence-the ability to visualise, design, prototype and build anything at the drop of a hat. Be it a flashlight, power armour, a new body for myself, cloning vats, neural laces, AIs etc., I would wish to be able to draw out blueprints for them in minutes, make them capable of manufacture at our current level of technology and basically make a fully functional version of whatever I want in an hour with common household items.  Using said technology, I would be able to basically build my own weapons (40 watt-range plasma rifle vs wraith? You betcha), make money through both industry and billionaire geeks (I mean, a fully functional light sabre? A batch of artificial midichlorians? How about safe to use Eezo implants? A tricoder? A motherfucking holodeck? How much would any self-respecting billionaire shell out for any one of these items? How much would a tech firm shell out for the blueprints and a 'building this piece of scifi bullshit for dummies' booklet?) and make the lives of my fellow magical people a lot easier.   Need backup? Here, have a t-888 or a TOK series modelled after whichever badass picks your fancy. Need companionship? Hal 9000 tickle your fancy? What about a replicant? Or an Asimovian robot?  Need a ride? Here, have a fully autonomous Panem gunship for all your taxiing and close air support needs.  Walpurgisnacht jump dimensions again? ALL THE GUNDAMS!  Still feeling a bit... exposed despite all of this? Well, you're a magical girl (or a very, very confused magical guy wondering just why your transformation leaves you in, well, a pouffy dress with high heels and stockings to boot), so making you a Space Marine would probably take a while. So here, have a Sisters of Battle power Armour instead, complete with bolter pistol, chainsword and PLASMA RIFLE-though a more stable version from another setting, just to be safe.  And if you end up trapped in the midst of an army of wraith, witches and/or Homura Akuma avatars? Well, BFG 9000! When you absolutely, definitely have to turn a city into a smoking glass crater, accept no substitutes until the no-rad nukes have undergone sufficient testing.  You see, that is what I would wish for. Something that is versatile, scalable, adaptable to the new life of neverending, vicious and insane warfare I just walked into with eyes wide open and that would leave a legacy behind for future generations to point at and scream 'Remember that? That was bullshit!' while they FTL-explore the universe on ships designed by me.  TL;DR: My wish would be selfish AND munchkin the fuck out of the universe, rendering any and all fights I enter after the first week completely and utterly one-sided. As it should be.  PS: And yes, I would totally build an evil AI. Then I would give it a perishable human body, a hard-coded restriction not to copy, transfer or reproduce itself elsewhere, lock it in a concrete dungeon for a week and then let it loose-right into the middle of a wraith/witch/fucked-up Homukuma construct barrier/attack."
MadokaMagica,3947pw,Revenge21,3,Tue Jun 9 17:49:50 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah? Well I wish for the ability to cause any and all forms of technology to spontaneously fail without any limitations in range of any kind. Now, if the world wants your Utopian future they must pay tithe to me.   Bonus: since I could could potentially cause misery on a universal scale, it would also make me an incredibly powerful mahou shoujo (shounen?)."

This just my opinion but I think you shouldn't go for the DVD series if you plan on a blu-ray. I did that with Toradora and had to buy the series twice since I wanted the blu-rays for my archive lol. But its your money.

MadokaMagica,38s4v8,Nielsjen,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:52:37 2015 UTC,"This is only somewhat related, but you could make a WebM for yourself.  https://github.com/nixxquality/WebMConverter Here's a program I use. Basically just a GUI slapped on top of ffmpeg, hence the name WebM For Retards. WebMs tend to be better than .gifs, anyway, due to higher quality, support for audio and much better size/quality ratios.  I've converted a few .gifs to WebMs. Even saw one go from 22 MB to less than 1."
MadokaMagica,38s4v8,SoldierofNod,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:18:53 2015 UTC,I'm pretty new when it comes to making gifs but how I get the source material. Do I need to download an episode from Madoka on my PC?  Thanks though.
MadokaMagica,38s4v8,Arterius_N7,2,Sat Jun 6 21:25:55 2015 UTC,"Gifs can be pretty good too though, here's one I made.  And yeah, it's converted to webm on gyfcat but the original is a gif and it looks exactly the same. The advantage with gyfcat here is that it makes it quicker to load.  Edit: I also looked up the scene in question but didn't see how it would make for an interesting gif so I didn't do it."
MadokaMagica,38s4v8,SoldierofNod,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:16:37 2015 UTC,"That's not a very good case study.  For one, compressing something to .gif is lossy. This means that it loses data when you create it. So, comparing something converted from source to .gif and something converted from source to .gif to WebM isn't going to be a very good indicator of quality. All the data that's lost when you initially converted it doesn't come back just because it's made into a WebM. (And the site uses VP8 rather than VP9. VP9 has better compression, though it takes longer to encode, especially with high quality settings.)  What would work is comparing something converted from source to .gif and something converted from source to WebM.  Compare the file sizes, too. The reason gfycat's conversion to WebM makes it quicker to load is because it's much more efficient at compressing video than .gif is.  Seriously, WebMs are better than .gifs because they're actually made for what they're used for. The .gif format was initially just used for clipart rather than what it's used for, now. Not to mention, they can have audio.  What anime is that?"
MadokaMagica,38s4v8,Arterius_N7,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:16:12 2015 UTC,All the data that's lost when you initially converted it doesn't come back just because it's made into a WebM.    That's not what I said. I said it looked exactly the same as the gif. My point was that you could make gifs that looked really good.  Edit: Hellsing Ultimate btw.
MadokaMagica,38s4v8,SoldierofNod,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:51:33 2015 UTC,And you can make WebMs that look better and have audio for a smaller size.
MadokaMagica,38s4v8,Arterius_N7,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:52:08 2015 UTC,Do they loop?  I also find them fun to make occasionally. It's also how I learned photoshop.
MadokaMagica,38s4v8,SoldierofNod,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:06:44 2015 UTC,"Let me correct myself, first. I looked it up and .gifs are lossless. Not very efficiently, though, hence the hueg file sizes.  They can loop. It really depends on your player. The web player on 8chan and cuckchan has a loop function. MPC-HC has a loop function. Same as anything else, really.  It's your call, really. I just prefer WebMs."
MadokaMagica,38s4v8,Arterius_N7,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:11:49 2015 UTC,"How much easier is making a gif compared to making a WebM? Your gif looks good enough to me so I don't really want to bother with the more fancier stuf, at least not yet.  I might be asking a bit much here but I'd really, really appreciate it if you could make a gif from the Madoka scene I was talking about.  Thanks anyway!"
MadokaMagica,38s4v8,Arterius_N7,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:20:05 2015 UTC,"Eh, it it actually probably easier to just convert a piece of the video to Webm than it is to gif it. Although I have never used it so idk.  Because for that gif in perticular I used a special trick where I first made each part of the scene as a gif with an optimized palette (pngQuant) and then stitched them together using gifsicle. To increase the amount of total colour in the gif.   But making gifs isn't that hard and it's only advanced if you have to do some special editing like a fading loop or something."
MadokaMagica,38s4v8,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:45:23 2015 UTC,"That all sounds pretty complex O.o  I'll try to figure it all out though, thanks for your help."
MadokaMagica,38s4v8,Arterius_N7,2,Sun Jun 7 11:14:37 2015 UTC,"Hey, I actually made it for you.  Was 333 frames to start with but trimming some duplicates took it down to 203. Also used some masking to reduce the size. Then I tried to create an optimal colour palette for each scene. Mostly using pngQuant but I used indexed colouring for one scene becuse there was so much grey it overruled homuras colouring making her an alien D:  Then I just created each seperate gif with that palette and stitched them together. Took maybe 1.5 ~ 2 hours altogether.  Also, here is how it would look if I just made it as a single gif with one palette directly from photoshop. Looks really bad but it's also over half the size.  Also, if you can't see them, let me know because I didn't set them as public. But I just assumed they wouldn't be public on gyfcat and direct links would still work."

MadokaMagica,38h8y9,b1000k,2,Thu Jun 4 04:57:29 2015 UTC,For the manga I don't think there is an order to read them in. I think most of them can be standalone. Someone correct me if I'm wrong though since I never really read too far into them.   Madoka is essentially an anime original so anything besides the movies and anime series are spin-offs/side stories.
MadokaMagica,38h8y9,FrozenFyre,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:08:35 2015 UTC,I guess if that's how it is I'll just read them in any order
MadokaMagica,38h8y9,Kraziub,2,Thu Jun 4 05:18:08 2015 UTC,"The only prerequisite for reading any of the manga is watching the show, and even then that's not entirely true.  The release order /u/REsoleSurvivor1000 gave is correct. Personally I'd read Different Story before Kazumi due to it sharing the same cast of characters while Kazumi and Tart have completely new casts. Oriko has some overlap between it and the main series. Suzune isn't officially in English yet, and Kirara is more oneshots and info"
MadokaMagica,38h8y9,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Thu Jun 4 05:17:47 2015 UTC,"All right, thanks for the response! This'll definitely help me read them and to understand everything better."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,twinfyre,8,Wed Jun 3 20:19:52 2015 UTC,Best fight in the whole series is Mami v Homura. Totally fucking rad. I've seen the movie a few times and its the part i look forward to the most.
MadokaMagica,38f52y,SmokeyHooves,3,Wed Jun 3 22:22:40 2015 UTC,Definitely the hype high point of the film. I added the music from the fight scene to my playlist almost immediately after it was over. I've already listened to it well over ten times.
MadokaMagica,38f52y,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Wed Jun 3 22:34:25 2015 UTC,Oh yes. It's just too damn good.
MadokaMagica,38f52y,b1000k,5,Wed Jun 3 22:59:06 2015 UTC,"Although I can't exactly say that I like the way the story went, I think they did a great job of showing Homura's thought process that led her to become ""homucifer"".  This is probably obvious to most of you, but one scene that really stuck out for me was the scene where Homura asked Madoka if she would've sacrificed herself to save everyone and madoka said something along the lines of ""I don't think I could do that. I would be really depressed to be cut off from everyone I know"". At that point, Homura knew (or at least, thought she knew) that Madoka wasn't happy being a God. So her actions at the end made a lot more sense for me."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,TheAlienBanana,3,Wed Jun 3 20:23:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, kind of what my thoughts are about Homura. I feel like she really let herself out in this movie. She did what she wanted and it seemed like everything involving her was a lot more important."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,Xirema,3,Wed Jun 3 20:26:08 2015 UTC,"What I really like about Madoka Magica is that other than Kyubey, there really isn't a true villain. Everyone has their own motivations and their actions seem completely justified. Yet there is still major conflict."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,wikingwarrior,4,Wed Jun 3 20:46:11 2015 UTC,"And even Kyubey isn't a villain in the traditional sense. He has no evil intentions, and he isn't doing what he does in order to bring suffering to others or personal gain. He's basically just doing his job, for the good of the universe. He's still a horrible little beast from the girls' and audience's perspectives, but he doesn't actually seem to have any sort of sinful desire."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,b1000k,7,Fri Jun 5 05:39:26 2015 UTC,"Rebellion is an imperfect movie. And I don't even mean that in the way that sequels to fantastic series' inevitably fail to capture lightning in a bottle twice. On purely structural terms, whether analyzing storytelling beats or character depth, Rebellion doesn't work quite as well as the TV series, and even if I agree with the decisions/premise behind it, the execution of Homura's character arc probably needed a few more passes in the editing room. Even at my most generous, the critic in me tends to put this movie somewhere around a 7/10.  But here's the funny thing: When all is said and done, I think I actually prefer this movie over the series before it, both in terms of which ""canon"" I think is more interesting, and also in terms of which I like more on a personal level.   I've always been a sucker for Character Vignettes and I've always felt that the development of Homura as a character was held back by the fact that Episode 10 was only a single episode, which meant that huge formative moments in Homura's psyche were blitzed past in the effort to properly explain the scope of her journey. I've mentioned before, but it bears repeating: there's something unsatisfying about the fact that the show jumps straight from ""You can call me Madoka!"" to ""IT WASN'T WORTH SAVING ME IF YOU'RE NOT ALIVE!!!!"" in the span of about 2 minutes. The relationship between Homura and Madoka was crucial to understanding the nature of Homura's character, and in the TV show, it's a non-fatal (but still substantial) failure of ""Show, don't Tell"".  Rebellion fixed that problem, and in doing so, unveiled layers to Homura's characterization that feel more honest to the way she was characterized throughout episodes 1-11 of the TV series than how she is characterized at the end of episode 12. Because again: we're not shown the deep emotional/romantic connection that she and Madoka shared throughout the timelines in episode 10, it's only implied. What we are shown is a teenaged girl with a profound obsession with a girl she hasn't really known that long.  The end of the TV series characterizes Homura as a well-adjusted woman bitterly-yet-fondly recalling a warmer past with someone she deeply cared about.  Rebellion characterizes Homura as a teenager whose obsession with the object of their desire has driven them to a state of deep depression; whose inability to forgive themself for (what they perceive to be) their own failures has led them to lash out in destructive and suicidal ways.  I'm not speaking abstractly with respect to the latter, by the way: there's no less than 7 times in this movie where Homura threatens to kill herself1, actively attempts to kill herself2, or simply pantomimes the act of killing herself3. And personal interpretations, yadda yadda, but I do feel this is a more accurate manifestation of the kind of person Homura would become, given her experiences in the TV series, than how we see her at the end.  And I think that's where this movie finds its center: a story about a depressed girl trying to find happiness; seeking it in the one person she loves more than anyone else; and making everything worse when she impulsively takes what she wants for herself, at the expense of what (just about) everyone else wanted. Throughout, she's haunted by her own internal demons made manifest (Sayaka, Kyouko and Mami all act in subtly offputting ways that resemble who they were in the real world but are fundamentally distinct), and in one of the movie's most iconic scenes, we're treated to a brief flash of what she considers to be her ultimate, unforgivable failure.  It's haunting and traumatizing, especially for someone her age4, and it brings out the worst in her, in ways that we can't fully forgive either, but sympathize with all the same.  Homura Akemi is, at least for me, one of the most fascinating Anti-Heroines I've seen in fiction.     Now, again, the execution of that story was less than perfect. And I'd be lying if I said that I felt this was a 100% satisfying conclusion to the series. But I still love it, and I still feel confident that I'll be thinking fondly on this movie a decade out from now.     1 - when fighting Mami  2 - Shooting her soul gem, attempting to shoot herself again before Madoka tries to save her, not to mention biting her soul gem in half, plus the fact that her witch self immediately constructs a guillotine for the express purpose of ending her own life  3 - Her familiars flinging themselves off a cliff, her attitude when having her heart-to-heart with Madoka in the field  4 - I'm aware that she's chronologically 22, but given that those 8 years of time leaps were spent reliving the same events over and over, it's probably more accurate to characterize her as stuck in a state of arrested development"
MadokaMagica,38f52y,REsoleSurvivor1000,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:12:06 2015 UTC,I wouldn't necessarily bet on this being the ending.  It is also fairly heavily implied that Madoka will become aware of her past again.
MadokaMagica,38f52y,b1000k,5,Fri Jun 12 19:55:36 2015 UTC,"I really feel like the ending didn't leave me satisfied. It left us thinking if they were going to make a season 2 or another movie. The way Homura became a demon was kind of mysterious due to the fact that she stole Madoka's powers(maybe)? I still have TONS of questions about the things that happened in the anime, but they will all stay unanswered unless they give us a sequel."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Wed Jun 3 20:28:46 2015 UTC,"As far as questions go, I'm content with rewatching to come up with theories (i'm the type of person who likes ambiguous endings). But as much as I like this movie, I can't exactly say it's a continuation of the series. Now don't flame me on this, but here me out.  I felt like it made the whole ending of the anime pointless. It's sort of like comparing the dark knight and the dark knight rises. At the end of Dark Knight, Batman is being chased by the cops and is now something of a guardian vigilante. So you'd expect that to be the subject of the next movie, right? But nope, at the beginning of the Dark knight rises, Batman's name is cleared.   The same thing happens in Rebellion. I thought the focus would be more on fighting wraiths like the end of the anime implied. But I don't even think we saw a single wraith in rebellion.  Anyway, I don't want to turn this into a ""rebellion hate thread"", but I kind of like the idea of considering Rebellion a separate canon from the series. Sort of like a branching point. That way, we can have the satisfying conclusion of the anime (and assume everything afterward turns out alright) but also have the more open ended ending of rebellion.   The idea of endless sequelization of franchises just really bothers me. If the characters are withheld a happy ending for too long, I'll eventually stop caring about the conflict and assume they'll never get one."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,b1000k,3,Wed Jun 3 20:43:57 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: I consider it canon. I'm FAIRLY certain that the beginning of Rebellion is after the show within the ending of the series. Homura has fought many Wraiths up until the end of the world where then she falls into despairs, creates her labyrinth, and hides inside of it.  I personally think it ties in together fairly well. However there are A LOT of things people can miss on the first watch. I did, and I was still learning new things for the longest time even after my second watch. I do plan on going back to it really soon just to keep it fresh in my mind of course, but the last time I watched I felt it was a bitter-sweet ending in a way. Fucked up for sure, but Homura for the most part accomplished what she felt was correct."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,wikingwarrior,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:04:01 2015 UTC,Rebellion is a really confusing movie that leaves us all with questions. I just hope that they make an OVA or just something new to answer everything we were unsure about.
MadokaMagica,38f52y,REsoleSurvivor1000,2,Wed Jun 3 23:59:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, like I mentioned above, I didn't have too many issues with it. First-time watchers it's completely understandable as I was in the same boat, but after a rewatch and other discussions posted here it was easier to understand. People like /u/jdragon as well as a few others have made some valid points regarding the story. It's quite the chore to do the in-depth analyzing work to decipher this story understandably, but I don't feel it needs an OVA. Not that I'd be against it mind you!"
MadokaMagica,38f52y,jadedctrl,3,Thu Jun 4 00:20:20 2015 UTC,"It's sort of like a more divisive end of evangelion. There's a lot of ways it can be interpreted, and first time viewers are going to be very confused."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,gianttabby,2,Thu Jun 4 03:49:52 2015 UTC,"All right, I just rewatched it, and I gotta say so many things are cleared up. I don't think I have too many questions about the anime anymore."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,gianttabby,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:19:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm not sure it does render the ending pointless.  Essentially as far as I'm aware Madoka god exists still as a separate entity and the law of cycles continues as it had, Hamura just took Madoka out of it.  I could be completely wrong."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,gianttabby,3,Fri Jun 12 19:57:12 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I'm still awed that it made its way to Netflix as they are notoriously bad for holding anime contracts with their respective companies. Other good shows have disappeared from their stock before which has been saddening, but glad it's not the case here!  Madoka Magica, the show, has to be one of my favorite (if not THE number one) shows of all time. After learning about Rebellion last year I picked it up and WAS AWED at how well it was written. The story and the emotion was just as intense if not more than the show which is incredible! Another user here mentioned the Mami x Homura fight: One of my favorite fights of all time! Just too good.  Had a friend of mine rewatch it with me a few months back and she loved it! I really hope more people get onboard this magical train of amazement with the rest of us, because it's hella worth it.  OP. If you haven't touched the manga ""The Different Story"" I suggest you do. Especially if Mami or Kyouko is your best girl. It's a different timeline-ish than the normal story that is pretty dang good on its own."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,Vegito1338,3,Wed Jun 3 23:12:07 2015 UTC,"When I watched in theaters, all I was thinking was ""What the fuck just happened""-- part of the confusion was because it was subbed, part of it was because of the movie itself. I just watched the dub three times, in order to rid of all this confusion and such, but part of it remains. I thought it was me, but I've come to the conclusion that it's the movie itself. Homura's character makes a pretty big leap, in my opinion. In the series, she goes from valuing Madoka's sacrifice, with it being ""why I keep up the fight"" to caring more about protecting Madoka from a single, short conversation with a less developed Madoka with abosultely no memories of the struggles that the 'real' Madoka went through in the series. In the series, Madoka learns and matures leading up to her wish, but the Madoka in the labrynth doesn't remember this, and as such, doesn't reflect how Madoka felt at the end of the series, yet Homura accepts this immature Madoka's opinion as if it reflects the real Madoka's feelings. Madoka was happy with her sacrifice-- she said so, didn't she? Oh, and Homura is able to just freaking grab Madoka's hand and take her power just like that? Because she hatched and her soul gem was dotted with love? Part of me likes that ""love is the most powerful thing,"" but part of me doesn't like the deus ex machina ending. Why did Kyuubey tell Homura the truth, anyway? Kyuubey's lied in the past, and surely could've twisted it in a way to make Homura go along with destroying the seal, right? And Nagisa. Nagisa, Nagisa, Nagisa. Displayed prominately on movie posters and advertising, but she gets five lines. Yea, I guess the ""backup"" thing makes enough sense, but seriously? Couldn't they have given her more lines by-- having Sayaka and Nagisa inform the girls about the situation earlier in the movie? They were just going along with this ""happy dream"" when they could've probably wrapped it up from the beginning, saving a lot of time... The movie did have an obvious villan-- Kyuubey. In the series, there wasn't really an obvious villan, and that was something I really liked about the series... I'm not saying I hate Rebellion, I loved the movie, and intend to watch it plenty of times in the future, it just kinda led to the metaphorical cup that is my suspension of disbelief to overflow. 'Tis just my opinion, and I'm probably wrong, or maybe I just need to make my suspension of disbelief deeper..."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,Vegito1338,2,Thu Jun 4 00:33:38 2015 UTC,"I'm still kinda going back and forth between ""Homura's love didn't contradict the rules of magical girls"" to ""How the hell does Homura's transition to a devil make sense?"" I mean, I can understand and accept a story thematically if there's an intended conveyance like Homura's unhealthy obsession with Madoka. But the nit-picky, Cinema Sins part of me wants to poke holes at the film's logic."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,b1000k,3,Thu Jun 4 06:07:35 2015 UTC,"Rewatching this movie, a few things crossed my mind.   The ""Welcome to Cinema"" and ""Did you enjoy the movie?"" signs, along with Homura's film shutter motif, make the Labyrinth a meta-analogue of the audience and the film Rebellion itself. Homura sees what she wanted to see in this ideal world, the PMMM fans see what they wanted to see like the magical girls working together, Charlotte/Bebe's re-appearance, Sayaka x Kyoko, etc. So is this some kind of meta-commentary on the popularity and franchising of what's supposedly a complete story? When Homura became a demon and affected the universe, I keep wondering three possible outcomes. Did Homura actually change the universe itself? Did Homura create a labyrinth as big as the universe? Or is this is an amalgam of the universe and the labyrinth? For that last example, imagine working on a Photoshop picture where half the picture is layered over the second half. Put together and they make an indistinguishable whole. During the transformation sequence, Madoka's felt like it reflected on her desire to be a magical girl like the ones in anime. Copies of her dance along a fim roll, you see a profile view of her face in a different art style, and she reaches her hand out to break what could've been a TV screen."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,HugYunoGasai,3,Thu Jun 4 05:57:25 2015 UTC,"That ""Did you enjoy the movie"" thing did make me think a little when I saw it. But your interpretation makes a lot of sense. Given that the anime draws a lot of inspiration from end of evangelion, it's only fitting that the movie would have a lot of jabs at the fanbase.   As for the homura point. That really got me thinking. Given that dream symbolism is thrown around a lot, how do we know if Homura isn't still inside her ""Soul gem prison"" made by the incubators? (because inception) If you look at the ending, it makes a lot of sense. Everything is just too perfect. Homura stealing part of Madoka's powers? reverting everything to the status quo, while also majorly screwing over her enemy Kyubey? (and also possibly raping his mind.) It seems like the ideal world homura would create for herself. Also, tainting your soul gem with ""love"" seems like it came out of nowhere.   But who knows, maybe I'm just grasping at straws."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,b1000k,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:10:25 2015 UTC,"I'd probably chalk it up to not all questions answered in the ending. There's a bunch of things left up in the air. Which makes me feel kinda uneasy because I'd want those questions answered in a continuation, but at the same time I don't want to beat a dead horse when we already have the TV series' satisfying conclusion."
MadokaMagica,38f52y,b1000k,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:33:52 2015 UTC,"I kind of like this kind of ending though. I mean, besides making it seem like they'll continue the series, I like how they left things like this hanging. It gives me room to speculate and also keeps the show in my head much longer than if they were to just straight up say, ""this happened then this happened and then...""  It's one of the reasons why I like the ending to the original FMA anime (sans movie) It left a lot open to interpretation and also had a pretty brilliant spin on equivalent exchange. Baccano had a good ending too because the characters themselves basically took a step back and said, ""We'll just let you guess what happens next."" Yet it was also satifying because all of the main story arcs ended. (although a sequel anime with more focus on graham specter would be nice.)"
MadokaMagica,38f52y,b1000k,2,Thu Jun 4 06:39:01 2015 UTC,Do they explain in any of the puella magi works if Kyubey was telling the truth about trying to save the universe?
MadokaMagica,38f52y,aspiesinger,4,Thu Jun 4 03:03:35 2015 UTC,"I don't really see any reason why he wouldn't tell the truth there. Kyubey never tells full lies at any point in the series. He only tells half truths. In the scene where Kyubey tells Madoka about the laws of the universe, he's being incredibly blunt and insensitive. I don't really think he held anything back in that scene."

MadokaMagica,389uwr,zaturama008,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:06:11 2015 UTC,"Serial Experiments Lain is a 1998 psychological cyberpunk anime, 13 episodes. It's about a girl Lain who gets involved in an internet\virtual reality called The Wired. It has a unique ""show, don't tell"" style where it leaves a lot of things open to the viewer's interpretation.  It can be rather confusing, but also pretty deep. No action, low animation quality, and a slow pace, but very thought provoking. It's my all-time favorite anime, but it's definitely not for everyone, especially anyone who likes to turn their brains off when watching anime."

MadokaMagica,38amwk,Vegito1338,4,Tue Jun 2 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"In the first instance, Homura met Madoka after she (and Sayaka) had met Kyubey and had become magical girls. She became friends with them and eventually entered a scenario where Walpurgisnacht had killed Madoka, allowing Homura to make her wish: To redo the meeting with Madoka.   What this means is that she went back in time to before she had met Madoka, and just before Madoka and Sayaka met Kyubey. While the story would change with each telling, who died, who became a magical girl, what their wishes were, et cetera, the end result was always the same: everyone dies and Homura resets the timeline.  Basically, at the end of every reset, Homura resets the timeline. She retains her magical powers and status of Magical Girl, but everyone and everything else returns as they were before.  TL;DR"
MadokaMagica,38amwk,patchesyar,2,Wed Jun 3 01:05:57 2015 UTC,I mean why is madoka magical at the beginning of some times but not others?
MadokaMagica,38amwk,Artunique,2,Wed Jun 3 01:31:50 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way:  All of the following events happen after Homura makes her wish   Wake up in the hospital  Acquire weapons  Hunt down Kyubey before it reaches Madoka.   This point in particular shows up in the series after Homura gives her speech of not trusting anyone and having to do things herself, she tells Madoka ""If someone tells you they can grant you any wish, don't trust them"" which what I believe Madoka meant when she says that she ""Dreamed"" about Homura, she may have just seen her at 2am or something instead."
MadokaMagica,38amwk,Arterius_N7,3,Wed Jun 3 03:06:07 2015 UTC,"Ok so it was a while since I watched the show but I think it went something like this:  First timeline  Madoka makes a wish to save a cat (think it said so in the wiki, it's the cat she's holding in the OP) and becomes a magical girl. She learns under Mami and homura becomes a magical girl shortly after she was rescued by Mami and Madoka from a witches labyrinth (I think it was the art witch).  Something something walpurgisnacht happens and they failed (think Mami died and Madoka went of to challenge the witch, it's the first episode) so homura starts the spiral with going back in time to save her (cue Rocky training montage).    So regarding your actual question (I'm tired...). She wouldn't actually know anything bad would happen the first time around. It wasn't the fact that she was magical that made her timetravel, it's what happens next which is why she would try and prevent her from ever making a contract in the first place.  Hope that helped :P  Edit: Also, if you have any questions, I'll be right back.  Wait, maybe I mixed it up..."
MadokaMagica,38amwk,_mynameismissing_,2,Wed Jun 3 01:07:44 2015 UTC,actually in the first timeline homura makes her wish at the end of walpurgisnacht to go back in time and save madoka
MadokaMagica,38amwk,mashibana,2,Wed Jun 3 01:29:47 2015 UTC,Yeah. It's all in the Memories of You  drama CD.
MadokaMagica,38amwk,Arterius_N7,2,Wed Jun 3 09:07:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought I mixed it up. That's what I get for trying to just remember it without checking first when I'm tired."
MadokaMagica,38amwk,Wolfefury,3,Wed Jun 3 12:09:33 2015 UTC,"If you watch carefully, there is actually a calendar in homura's hospital room, with a date a week away from when she wakes up circled as the day she goes back to school.  So it's implied she has a week between her waking up in the hospital and going to school and meeting madoka.  Edit: Here's the calendar."
MadokaMagica,38amwk,b1000k,2,Wed Jun 3 02:33:35 2015 UTC,Think about as that is the first timeline as you said. Imagine yourself in a normal world where you transfer into a new school. You then meet a new girl who is a magical girl. Your fate then destines you to become a magical girl where you gain time traveling powers. That is when Homura starts to time travel so Madoka can  live.  Edit: Don't listen to me but I'm keeping this up
MadokaMagica,38amwk,Xirema,2,Wed Jun 3 01:06:44 2015 UTC,"Episode ten doesn't handle the passage of time well.  Basically, imagine that a week happens between ""You have an awesome name!"" and ""Don't tell anyone in class, alright?""  Really, the exact amount of time isn't terribly important. One could even imagine that the reason Madoka acts so flustered at the beginning of the second timeline is because she doesn't even understand what Homura's talking about."
MadokaMagica,38amwk,ZacProductions,2,Wed Jun 3 01:58:17 2015 UTC,Something that gets me is that Homura was in the hospital at the time Madoka became a Magical Girl and wasn't allowed to go back to school until a week after. How could she go back and save Madoka from making a contract if at the time she was still hospitalized? She couldn't heal herself the way Madoka did in the first drama CD because Madoka could only heal her because of her wish to save Amy (the cat) from getting hit by a car. Or am I wrong?
MadokaMagica,38amwk,ZacProductions,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:13:06 2015 UTC,I was looking at the madoka magica wiki more after making this thread. It has a table of events for each timeline. I think madoka contracted 2 days after Homura wakes up. So I guess in some timelines she just killed Kyubey for a week straight maybe. She did tell kyoko she was sure you can't kill Kyubey.
MadokaMagica,38amwk,ZacProductions,2,Fri Jun 5 23:01:32 2015 UTC,Okay. Thanks for clearing that up. I recently got into the fandom so I don't know as much as others I'm sure.

MadokaMagica,37hcrr,volhaka,6,Wed May 27 17:18:41 2015 UTC,The ending is pretty open to how you see it. Personally I saw it more as Homura 'losing' Madoka  In the end you could say that Homura's universe is better although it isnt certain how long it will last. Might be evil how you look at it though.
MadokaMagica,37hcrr,Valiantttt,4,Wed May 27 19:39:46 2015 UTC,"The after-credit is the most emblematic thing about Rebellion and no one is really certain of its meaning (here's a ton of fan speculation), I'm for the theory of it symbolizing Homura's descent into madness.  I think the best Universe is the one ruled by Homura, the one with the witches was full of despair and the one without Madoka was too sad for Homu-chan to live in.  EDIT: It's almost sure you missed something, especially if you can't read the runes, take a look here and here."
MadokaMagica,37hcrr,mashibana,6,Wed May 27 19:51:57 2015 UTC,"My interpretation of that scene is it representing that Madokami is ""missing"" from Homura's new universe.  This is a scene from the opening of the first movie, and they reference that scene again earlier in Rebellion.  The after credits scene is conspicuously missing Madoka.    As for which universe is better, that's a matter for personal opinion.  There are advantages to Homura's new creation, namely that the incubators don't seem to be running the show anymore.  But I think that after credits scene alone shows that Homura herself isn't truly happy with her new universe.  It was the best she could do to foil Kyuubey's plans though.  And yeah, there is a ton of symbolism scattered through Rebellion.  A lot of other people have done some great analysis of this movie, so I'll just link some here.  I'll just note that while I don't agree with the thesis of that last one I linked, it has some great discussion and analysis in each part so it's definitely worth a read for hardcore Madoka fans."
MadokaMagica,37hcrr,-d-a-s-h-,2,Wed May 27 19:57:43 2015 UTC,I didn't realize that was supposed to be related to the Luminous scenes.  The ending makes some sense now.

MadokaMagica,37hcrr,Acknown3,1 point,Thu May 28 20:00:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if Homura's universe is legit. What if it's just a universe-sized Labyrinth? It seems to work exactly the same way like recreating the city, changing people's memories, and set up in a way that Homura perceives as ideal. Biggest difference is that Homura is calling the shots, and anyone who opposes her rule gets their memory messed with.  Think of Homura's Labyrinth as The Matrix. Except once she got out, she built an even bigger Matrix that she controls."
MadokaMagica,37hcrr,gianttabby,1 point,Thu May 28 01:26:42 2015 UTC,What does the after credits ending mean (where Homura is on the hill and the moon seems to be cut right in half)?   There is more than one meaning there.   Also which universe is ultimately better for everyone (not just Madoka or just Homura)?   It's the same univsere; Homura simply took the Incubator's plan of locking Ultimate Madoka away from Homura's Soul Gem and ran with it on a larger scale. It is also temporary; Homura has no capacity to stop Madoka from reawakening and reestablishing the pre-Akuma state of affairs. That is the nature of Homura's tragedy and Madoka's character.

MadokaMagica,378vr3,Sa_Rart,2,Mon May 25 20:48:58 2015 UTC,"As you said, I think the two best ways that they could create a sequel would be to either:   a) Introduce a new cast of characters whose story intersects with the original group (a la Oriko Magica). That way they could explore new characters and their dynamics while still benefiting from their previously established lore and characters.  b) Age everyone up a few years. We've only seen these characters at ~13-15, so there's still plenty to explore as they grow older and more mature. We're basing our impressions on when they were young teenagers, but weren't you totally different when you were thirteen? Personally, I was planning on living entirely on Hot Pockets and Spam, since those were the only things I knew how to ""cook"". That's... mostly untrue now.  From a plot standpoint, I think there's still plenty of options available. An increasingly unstable teenage girl does not rewrite the cosmos without inadvertently leaving some threads unresolved. After all, the entire plot of the show revolved around a mechanism to avert the heat death of the universe, so this is a series that already revolves around details you wouldn't immediately think about. Similarly, there's still a bunch of plot threads from the franchise that were never directly dealt with (i.e. the Wraiths/Demons, the implication that Homura was offing Oriko and Kirika in every single timeline, presumably a whole bunch of shit in the other manga series) that could still be introduced into the main series for sequel purposes.  Also:   Maybe Sayaka kisses Kyouko, maybe not. There's nothing innovative about it. There's nothing new.   I deeply disagree. It would be super unexpected so urobuchi do this plz"
MadokaMagica,378vr3,CrypticRandom,1 point,Tue May 26 01:26:25 2015 UTC,"Technically, according to Word of God, Homura's like 23, now, and I think Kyouko has definitely been through enough shit to be considered an adult.  Mami would be the most interesting one to develop, I think -- even if she already knows how to cook.  Also   Maybe Sayaka kisses Kyouko, maybe not. There's nothing innovative about it. There's nothing new.   Make Kyouko kiss Homura.  Or ANYONE be straight.  THAT would be unexpected!"
MadokaMagica,378vr3,CrypticRandom,2,Tue May 26 02:31:00 2015 UTC,"They may have experiences, but from a maturity standpoint, none of the characters other than Mami have really dealt with things in a way that suggests emotional maturity (Homura least of all). Kyoko's the closest with her ""nothing really matters so fuck it"" attitude, but she and all of the other characters have plenty of room for growth and development.   Also   Maybe Sayaka kisses Kyouko, maybe not. There's nothing innovative about it. There's nothing new.   Make Kyouko kiss Homura. Or ANYONE be straight. THAT would be unexpected!   Ah, but Sayaka's only technically canon love interest is male. Therefore, the truly innovative and new thing to do would be for her to ask Kyoko to a school dance and for the pair to then slow dance at the center of a ring of students, the sweeping orchestral score slowly building to a crescendo, as Kyoko stares into Sayaka's eyes and confesses that it doesn't matter whether this universe is ruled by god, devil, or nothing at all, all that matters is this moment, their faces meeting in the finest goddamn animation that Shaft has ever produced. 'twould also coincidentally fulfill my otp."
MadokaMagica,378vr3,CrypticRandom,1 point,Tue May 26 03:08:49 2015 UTC,"I tend to think of Mami as the least emotionally mature, actually.  She is completely unaware of her limits, and her strength is a facade.  But all of them have their own little lies that they tell themselves -- Homura believing that she can save Madoka, Mami that she can do things by herself, Kyouko claiming that she doesn't care.  Kyouko, at least, breaks her own illusion during the series.  It looked to me like Homura did, as well, in the last couple of scenes.  I'm vaguely curious about your last paragraph, actually, and not in a completely sarcastic way.  Would a slice-of-life sort of thing like that be interesting, do you think, as a subset of a possible sort of series within a post-Rebellion TV series?  And as long as we're pretending, let's make it a ballroom dance that Kyouko sneaks them into! or the roof of a symphony hall under the stars.  Or a copy-and-paste from this week's Hibike.  And you might wanna specify lips meeting, not faces.  Otherwise we're going to get a forehead smash instead of a kiss."
MadokaMagica,378vr3,ZigglesRules,2,Wed May 27 06:30:22 2015 UTC,"I think part of it is just that Mami never got nearly the same amount of character development, what with her being whacked in the third episode. However, I will still argue that she was easily the most emotionally mature out of the group, pre-2/3-of-the-cast-dying. While she was about as mature as you would expect a fifteen-year-old magical girl to be, she was still a whole lot better off than Sayaka's suicidal ""nice guy"" complex, Kyoko's nihilism, or Homura's suicidal ""nice guy"" complex. Madoka's arguably the most healthy, but she's a fourteen-year-old girl, with all the insecurities that come with that. I love these characters, but let's be real here. After everyone dies, Sayaka does get a major burst of maturity, but a lot of that derives from her gaining the experiences of infinite lives. Homura though... well, that's why we have Rebellion.  On the slice of life thing, I'd say yes and no. On one hand, I'd love the shit out of it. I'm the kind of person that enjoys gooey Starbucks-AU shipfics, and I also thoroughly loved the beginning half of Rebellion. That said though, beyond the characters, Madoka is driven by its dark and emotionally-complex story, to which an adorable slice-of-life episode is somewhat thematically incompatible. There's still a lot of value in those moments, like when Madoka interacts with her parents, as they help ground the characters, but at the same time it can't distract from the overarching story.  So, in a nutshell, gimme a Prom-AU OVA and I'll be over the moon, but as long as the main series continues largely the same."

MadokaMagica,378vr3,Radguy1990,3,Wed May 27 06:22:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the main things I would want out of a new movie are   An actual resolution to the story The Sayaka and Homura conflict to finally take center stage   Sayaka and Homura have been established so similarly, yet so differently. I love the contrast between them, and how Rebellion only furthered it. I want this conflict to stop being teased now, and for it to actually be fully explored. It's been built up gloriously by the original series (honestly, Sayaka and Homura were basically the real main characters) and particularly Rebellion. And I am more than ready for some payoff. God has been dethroned, and I am hyped for conflict between her right hand (Sayaka) and her Devil (Homura), especially with their particular past histories.  Taking this into consideration, I definitely think there's enough to explore with a new movie without drastically time-skipping from the end of Rebellion (a few years' skip could work) or severely altering the main cast."
MadokaMagica,378vr3,mcroller,1 point,Fri May 29 22:53:14 2015 UTC,"It'd be nothing but resolution, though, without any of the intricacies that the series has used as its backbone up till now.  That's one of my biggest complaints with Rebellion -- it ended in a place that's very hard to pick back up without being simply a one-dimensional, if awe-inspiring and visually stunning, simplistic sort of close to a beautifully detailed story."
MadokaMagica,377dmp,Kar_Athri,3,Mon May 25 14:10:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure on the first question, but for the second I believe Homura mentions that wraiths exist in her new world and Kyubey is also seen in the end so I believe it will basically be like Madoka's universe just with Homura acting as an opposition to Madoka eventually."
MadokaMagica,377dmp,MageOfHope,3,Mon May 25 14:42:16 2015 UTC,"The isolation field was destroyed when they got out of the soul gem so it was all Homu's doing, and the new world isn't unstable: both wraiths and magical girls exist and the law of the cycle is still working(-ish?). All Homura did was to separate Madoka's physical form from ""Godoka"" so she could live her life like a normal girl."
MadokaMagica,377dmp,mashibana,1 point,Mon May 25 15:49:54 2015 UTC,"So, there are other magical girls, but all the magical girls we know are now normal girls?"
MadokaMagica,377dmp,man_and_machine,1 point,Mon May 25 15:55:45 2015 UTC,"Whether or not the Law of the Cycles still functions the way it was meant to is disputed.  On one hand, Homura meant for the Law of the Cycles to exist in her new universe, and only intended to split Madoka from the Law so that she could finally live a normal life.  But on the other hand, Madoka's wish was to kill every witch with her own hands, and with her hands (along the rest of her) separated from the Law of the Cycles, the Law may no longer function.  I'm not quite sure which side I stand on.  Personally, I'm hoping for a new movie soon, and that part of it will explain what happened to the Law of the Cycles when Homura created her new universe."
MadokaMagica,377dmp,man_and_machine,2,Mon May 25 17:34:03 2015 UTC,"To your first question:  When Mami explained witches to Madoka and Sayaka the first time, she said witches are analogous to magical girls, in that while a magical girl is born from a wish, a witch is born from a curse.  Even though she didn't know the true nature of witches at the time, I think Mami was sort of right.  Madoka's wish was so strong that, instead of simply becoming a magical girl, she became a god.  In the same way, I think because Homura's soul gem was tainted with love rather than (or possibly in addition to) despair, she didn't become a witch but became a god herself."
MadokaMagica,377dmp,Sa_Rart,2,Mon May 25 18:18:35 2015 UTC,"She broke Madoka off of the Cycles and inserted herself in the place of Madoka as the so-called ""hand"" of the cycle -- the one who personally intervenes.  It would appear that she is making Kyuubey bear the weight of humanity's curses in some way -- she mentions that they still need the Incubators, so he'll be ""helping out,"" and the next shot of him is ragged, helpless, and utterly terrified.  How it works, precisely, is undetermined.  It is clear that she is far more willing and/or able to trifle with the world in strange ways, or -- at the very least -- her familiars see no problem with stealing Kyouko's apples or mussing up the trees.  Whether there are Witches, Wraiths, or other Puella -- only she knows."

MadokaMagica,3763n9,GelatinGhost,2,Mon May 25 04:52:37 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, when someone mentions ""evil"", it gets mixed up with the chaotic alignment. It just depends on what you consider to be moral.  Madoka acting as a sort of goddess who established her own rule of preventing witches' birth and bringing magical girls salvation at her own expense places her on the side of Order. Meanwhile, Homura cared less about what others wanted and used her pent up emotions and power to create her own personally ideal world by defying Madoka's routine, thus making her aligned with Chaos.  Personally I'm a bit mixed on how justified Homura's actions are in the ending. If you recall, you'd see that Homura pretty much controlled everyone else's lives and memories without their consent. That's pretty much a mind rape. Speaking of which, her obsession with Madoka is unhealthy. Like, stalker/clingy girlfriend kind of unhealthy where it motivates someone to do as they please without caring if others object to the methods."
MadokaMagica,3763n9,gianttabby,1 point,Mon May 25 07:47:59 2015 UTC,"I didn't really remember any evidence for Homura controlling others' lives, other than the initial memory wipe (which is controversial yeah, but memories were altered in Madoka's universe too). I don't really understand why Sayaka even required the memory wipe, seems like the recreation of the universe should have taken care of that like everyone else. Anyways having memories of being dead would have made it nearly impossible to live a normal human life, which is what Homura wanted for her and everyone else.  I agree Homura's love for Madoka never really felt healthy, and seems likely unrequited to boot. But nonetheless I guess I fell on Homura's side of ignoring Madoka's wish to be a Goddess just because I always feel like immortality is a curse (which unfortunately Homura has now)."

MadokaMagica,370hs7,gianttabby,6,Sat May 23 18:48:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm, maybe something like an RPG with Assasins creed movement (or just bayonetta movement all around) set in a city with a day mode and a night mode.  I havn't played persona but if I get it right it does something similar where you allocate time to your frinds at the day and fight some macguffin at the night. So something similar where you talk to characters and do other things at day, frankly I'm not sure what. Probably something story-related.  At night you would have to go out on witchhunts I imagine which could be cool if it was like super mario world 64 paintings when you find a labyrinth. In that labyrinth you would face the witch minions and eventually the witch as the final boss. I imagine something like a Bayonetta setup and combat for these levels would work. Also the labyrinth would obviously close on completion but maybe you could keep a ghost version if you wanted to replay it or something. Or just have it accessible from the main menu.  In that, the magic system would probably be something like a mana.bar combined with the witcher potion system that if your mana depletes you die so you have grief-seeds like mana-potions which became auto-use at a certain threshold. You would also have an HP bar.  Diffrent girls could have diffrent HP, regeneration and Mana-bar size depending on their stats. Diffrent movesets for diffrent weapons too would be cool ala Dark Souls. Although these would be bigger considering the combat style.  If you want to be even more out there you would include the Dark Souls multiplayer system for magical girl fights and co-op (would have to find a way to share loot).  Also considering the combat, you would have to balance your mana consuption in such a way that people just don't skip past the small minions because they arn't worth the mana. You should be able to fight them without to much of a cost since otherwise it would just be boring.  Just some thoughts. That would be a pretty huge game so I don't really think someone is going to make it."
MadokaMagica,370hs7,Arterius_N7,1 point,Sat May 23 22:05:39 2015 UTC,"That really would be a huge game. That doesn't mean you can't make a AA game with a less costly budget and still somewhat ambitious though. Maybe if it were on the scale of NieR with some tweaks, such a project wouldn't be out of the question.  Though from what I've read, it sounds like you want to glorify being a magical girl. Which, last time I checked, PMMM is very cynical about. lol"
MadokaMagica,370hs7,Arterius_N7,1 point,Sat May 23 22:13:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe, I just gave a shot at making something I would probably find fun to play using the theme, no restrictions."
MadokaMagica,370hs7,Arterius_N7,1 point,Sat May 23 22:17:21 2015 UTC,"You can have it both ways where a game both matches its theme and is compelling to play. Using Dark Souls as an example, it's a dangerous and mysterious world and basing its RPG mechanics around that makes it so satisfying to go through.  I wouldn't mind your idea of how a magical girl would play out, if it weren't for the unspoken consequences of Kyubey's contract. XD"
MadokaMagica,370hs7,Arterius_N7,2,Sat May 23 22:29:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I atleast included it inform of death/witchification when your mana depleted.  But you could probably exapnd on it and make it a bigger part of the experience. Maybe using the story too and choices you might make? Like would you save this girl even if it meant you might run out yourself later? etc etc.    About dark souls, a lot of the fun came from the fact that the combat is for the most part pretty spot on without ""bullet sponge"" enemies from most other games and where your weapon and tactics matter a lot. The fact that it has a nice leveldesign, cool enemies for the most part and an interesting lore makes it great but if the core gameplay wasn't good then it wouldn't be as big as it is today."
MadokaMagica,370hs7,darklooshkin,1 point,Sat May 23 22:36:33 2015 UTC,We all know how that turned out in the show. Even worse when someone goes mad from the revelation. o_o
MadokaMagica,370hs7,shadotterdan,1 point,Sat May 23 22:38:16 2015 UTC,Adding a sanity gauge could be fun to haha. But you would also probably have to worry about nedless complexity. If it doesn't add to the experience it's probably a good idea not to include.  Also added a response about darksouls to that other reply.
MadokaMagica,370hs7,shadotterdan,3,Sat May 23 22:41:48 2015 UTC,"Well, there's a number of ways that you could do it.  An open world environment would be a must.  After that, it depends-RPG system?  Could work, since it structures everything to a nice, cohesive set of commands and decision trees (do this, get that) which, whilst being understandable, could end up limiting the decisions you want to make.  GTA-style story-telling on a timer, where you can roam free but woe betide you should you miss deadlines? That, too, could work after a fashion. The gameplay would be freer than under the RPG system, but would require some heavy playing to get used to the options involved.  But, essentially, my scenario for the game would be like this-Mami's the intro chapters' character. She is, essentially, one of two high level characters in the game. You start the game about a week before the other two show up and get a soft-ish intro to the games mechanics-querying kyubey for hints, finding witches' barriers, finding familiars, navigating the landscape, completing the 'school day' recovery challenges to help negate any personal damage accrued during the missions etc. Basically, you spend a highly structured week in-game learning the ropes.  Then you get Homura as a playable character. The overarching goal of these chapters is to keep Madoka from contracting (which she will if your gameplay is bad enough) and be enough of a hardcore player to keep Sayaka from contracting (90% or better completion rates). You have access to time-stop and Homura's arsenal as well as a plethora of side missions that can be used to improve on both. The only problem? You have half the health of the other characters. In a witch's battle, should you run out of timestopping power, you can take maybe two-three successive hits before dying. You are also nowhere near as fast as Mami and, aside from guns/bombs/timestop, you have next to no in-battle magical abilities.   Next come Sayaka's chapters. In that one, you have the same level of health as Mami and the fastest health recovery in-game to start with. However, you have next to no hope of unlocking ranged attacks and your stats take damage whenever you get near a witch. Also, your attacks and stats are very, very low-Miki is half as powerful as Sakura's character at the start and tops out at two-thirds of Sakura's capabilities at best. Timing and strategy are the name of the game here-you need to kill the witch quickly if you want to make it through the round alive. As the chapters draw to a close, the rate at which your stats degrade gets faster, but your attacks get better. In the last battle you face, at full strength (health, soulgem purity, SAN etc.), you'll have a minute's worth of CQC before your stats hit zero and you witch out.   The next chapters are Sakura's. You actually start midway through Miki's chapter, which means you'll occasionally see Miki undertake your actions across the game world. So if you had Sayaka draw a dickface by spamming swords on a highway overpass, you can have Sakura go check it out. Also, your first fight is against Sayaka and lasts until she hits 50% HP. Sayaka's the strongest melee character in-game and is close to Mami's level when it comes to agility and she doesn't take stats damage from proximity to witches. However, she does take stats damages whenever Miki or Mami get hurt in battle. So for the first half of Sakura's game, you're going to be paying for the mistakes made in the latter half of your Sayaka playthrough. Hope you remember where, when and how you took damage! It gets worse in the second half, as keeping Miki alive without 'tutoring' her through a series of mini-games is stupidly hard. Also, no matter how well you do, you're going to need a lot of grief seeds as Miki and Mami both take almost damage proportional to the averages you ended up defining when you played through their characters.  Finally, Walpurgis Nacht comes along.  You're playing as an unpowered Madoka.   You have, essentially, one HP to your name, a normal archer's bow with fifteen arrows to it, a grenade given to you by Homura and Kyubey as a telepathic danger radar-that occasionally thrusts you into ambushes in order to make you contract.  The entire chapter is you navigating an increasingly hellish landscape, evading or killing familiars, scrounging for weapons & armor/protection and performing escort missions for people left behind during the fight. Your goal? Reach what's left of Mitakihara Tower before the fighter(s) engaging the witch die. In the final chapter, you'll have one hour before that happens.  The degree of mastery you have over the game determines the outcome. An overall minimum score of 70% is needed for all the girls to survive to fight Walpurgis.   If any of them doesn't, you get a bad end with a 1% chance at a 'good' end thrown in even if you complete the game: Madoka makes a wish (99% chance of Kriemhild Gretchen, 1% chance at Goduka).  There are only two good ends-the 1% chance one mentioned above, but whose chances can be improved via character interaction. The other is complete survival-all girls survive that day. In that one, you get to see the ending Homura wanted-Madoka embracing her, the girls all holding hands together watching the sky clear...  Then Homura's shield activates, whisking them all back in time.  This unlocks 'time war' mode. The objective? Complete all the missions at 97% or better to clear each girl's loop, with all five girls stuck in the loops. Also, Homura is now Moemura-half her health, has bombs and a golf club to start with. The faster you clear her loops, the higher the reward. Finish it on loop one (1 hp, a set of golf clubs and a bunch of firecrackers as initial equipment) and you unlock 'Hommando' mode.  But she's not the worst character to play. That honor belongs to Madoka. Clear the loops with one HP, a bow and a bunch of grenades.  Then, and only then, does the actual good end happen."

MadokaMagica,36y70t,twinfyre,3,Sat May 23 18:44:54 2015 UTC,"That would be hard to imagine. The guys kind of a key ingredient when it comes to a nihilistic story. Just compare the Fate/Stay Night series versus Urobochi's involvement with their prequel Fate/Zero? Now that I think about it, Kiritsugu Emiya is pretty much Homura as an older man with limited time magic. They're both disillusioned, cynical, and underhanded. And the positive aspect of their life is a friend/daughter who either dies or a magical girl, depending on the continuity."
MadokaMagica,36y70t,gianttabby,1 point,Sat May 23 18:53:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really want to watch Fate/Zero sometime. It's right near the top of my watchlist. But I have this thing about always watching a show in the order that it came out. The way I see it, watching the shows out of order could ruin my experience if I decided to go back and watch Fate/Stay Night."
MadokaMagica,36y70t,twinfyre,1 point,Sat May 23 19:32:03 2015 UTC,"Since it's a prequel, I don't think you need to know Fate/Stay Night's story. If anything, that would give you quite a few surprises to see. Since I was already a fan before Fate/Zero, that meant I already knew who lives/dies or whatever else happened to some characters that reappear in the next continuity. Which pretty much robs me of tension with some of the characters' fates."
MadokaMagica,36y70t,gianttabby,1 point,Sat May 23 21:25:32 2015 UTC,"Ok so here's the thing: people like to pretend like the original F/SN adaptation was ""fine"" or ""not so bad,"" but watching it will confuse you so much more than Fate/Zero will. The show pulls from other F/SN routes, doesn't really explain things as well as it should, and is generally just a damper on the Fate Franchise, so you should definitely skip it. Now normally, what you would do is read the Fate Route of F/SN (the original F/SN anime covered this), then the Unlimited Blade works route (airing now), go watch or read Fate/Zero, and then finish it all up with Fate/Stay Night's ""conclusion"" (all three routes are alternate timelines if you aren't familiar with routes). HOWEVER, since you are probably only going to watch the show, some things change. The current adaptation of Unlimited Blade works is great, but since you are skipping the Fate Route (if you follow my advice), some things will be a bit confusing since they aren't explained as well (it assumes some prior knowledge). Therefore, the best way to not miss out on anything is to watch Fate/Zero first. It doesn't leave out any major details and leaves you with very few questions as to how things actually work. The only possibly confusing part is the ending, but since it isn't explained until Heaven's Feel (the movies haven't been animated yet), it will confuse you even if you watch the original Fate/Stay Night and Unlimited Blade works first. I hope I could help, and feel free to ask any questions you might have.  TL;DR Watch Fate zero first"
MadokaMagica,36y70t,DaughterScrewball,1 point,Sun May 24 05:14:27 2015 UTC,Alright. I guess I'll go with Fate/Zero first then. lately I've been watching a lot of Urobochi anime and I just can't get enough of his writing style. this should be able to hold me over for a bit longer.

MadokaMagica,36y70t,twinfyre,2,Sun May 24 19:49:44 2015 UTC,"As a watcher of Fate/Zero (and currently watching UBW, the currently-airing sequel anime), I really wouldn't say it requires prior knowledge before going in. The first episode is about 50 minutes of exposition to get you up to speed with the universe and characters before the anime starts proper. Everything is fairly well explained over the course of the first few battles, except for what's left ambiguous until UBW. On top of that, the new UBW anime adds in a lot of tidbits for F/Z watchers (F/Z was made as a light novel after F/SN the VN).  But, long story short, I don't see why so many people insist that Zero will confuse people. If you have half a brain and pay attention, you'll be fine. Both F/Z and F/SN spoil each other, though - the tail end of F/Z spoils a lot of F/SN's Heaven's Feel route as well as the identities of specific servants, whilst F/SN (from what I can tell from watching UBW) lets you know who survived until the end fairly early, and how certain characters meet their end. Also, the ending, since it's a sequel.  Long story short, just go ahead and watch it however you want, coming from an anime-only watcher. But don't watch the DEEN adaptations."

Also, this might just be me, but a magical girl show doesn't really scream out ""feminism"" to me at all. The only decent example I can think of is the mother, and she really only has a few minutes of screentime in the entire series.  One topic which you should probably cover is the whole Madoka vs. Homura issue - that is, the value of the world vs the value of one, since that is inherent within the series itself and doesn't rely on any prior outside knowledge."
MadokaMagica,36mkgi,MerlinAesalon,5,Wed May 20 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"There are a few things you'll need to consider:   Will they be watching the TV series or the movies? There's more nudity in the TV series than the movies, and depending on your audience you could get raised eyebrows. That the nudity is non-sexualized and non-objectifying won't change that. How will they watch it? Will it be presented in the classroom or given to them to watch in the dorms? (""For tonight's homework, open up Netflix in a web browser..."") Avoid discussing Gen Urobuchi. You can't expect that kind of discussion unless Anime is a regular presence in the class. Same goes for the discussion about deconstructions, which aren't interesting conversations even when people know the genre well enough to appreciate the deconstruction. Have them watch it in English. Seriously, if you're doing this in an academic setting, you don't want to be fighting the barrier of students who don't do well with subtitled media.   Other than those concerns though, I'd say it's a great idea. If it were me I'd probably focus on Feminism (particularly with respect to Madoka) and Utilitarianism (particularly with respect to Kyouko and Sayaka)"
MadokaMagica,36mkgi,Xirema,5,Wed May 20 15:17:20 2015 UTC,I disagree on the English part. When I took a film class the professor made it a point that the foreign films will be shown in their original language as respect for the media.
MadokaMagica,36mkgi,BitJit,2,Wed May 20 18:50:26 2015 UTC,"And for a show like Madoka where character interaction is so important, it makes more sense to watch with the original.

MadokaMagica,36mkgi,MerlinAesalon,2,Wed May 20 19:47:37 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, having been to film school (during my own undergrad years) and having done scriptwriting, I always saw PMMM as having elements of deconstructing storytelling and character stereotypes in general. I never once considered it a deconstruction of the mahou shoujo genre despite that being how most people talked about it.   Nor do I consider it a fullblown deconstruction. I think it has parts that are deconstructive, but I don't think that the whole show is a deconstruction (I'm of the belief that if the whole show was a deconstruction of the mahou shoujo genre, that the story would've suffered because of it)."

MadokaMagica,36mkgi,MerlinAesalon,1 point,Wed May 20 16:48:25 2015 UTC,"PMMM IS a direct deconstruction of the magical girl genre, but it doesn't rely on that to be enjoyable. Kyubey, the girl's fates, their bodies, their relationships - all of that is written off as ""magic"" and not brought to their logical conclusions in the magic girl genre like they are in PMMM.

MadokaMagica,36mkgi,darklooshkin,3,Wed May 20 20:00:18 2015 UTC,"Suggested topic:  Time travel and the various literary interpretations thereof-  -fundamental concepts behind time travel in fiction  -types of expected roadblocks and consequences of time travel in a fantastic setting by type (paradox, trousering time, partial/complete erasure of previous timelines etc)  -early examples thereof (HG Wells, Mark Twain)  -Doctor Who, Star Trek et al; modern takes on time travel.  -Resolving a loop; the logic behind how a loop starts, how it is supposed to end and how it does end.  -Time as a resource in fiction: time as a weapon, an energy source and more.  Final: time travel in Pmmm-the concepts behind it, the inspirations behind those concepts, what the conditions of victory were and how it could have naturally resolved itself.

MadokaMagica,36mkgi,twinfyre,4,Sat May 23 01:17:17 2015 UTC,"I think it would be better if you avoided the topics of deconstruction and Feminism. I see deconstruction thrown around a lot, but Urobochi never really intended for the show to deconstruct the genre. As for Feminism, like others have said, there isn't really that much actual feminism in the show. Also in light of recent events, Feminism is a bit of a touchy subject. What with Anita Sarceesian making a fool of herself on the internet. Just thinking about the subject makes me uneasy.  As for the other stuff, I'd say go full force with the the german influences, tragedy, and other things like that. For tragedy, I highly recommend you watch this review by JesuOtaku I know I'm sort of contradicting myself since she is a feminist, but she's probably the only sane internet Feminist I know. And she knows what she's talking about.   Her review also covers the subject of deconstruction too. So you'll be killing two birds with on stone.   One other thing I really think you should add to the list is symbolism. There is a lot of symbolism in Madoka. Especially in Sayaka's story arc. Just read up on the madoka magica wiki and you'll learn tons of things about the show. For example, the runes seen throughout the series (I thought it was really clever how the words ""look at me!"" were written all over the posters in Sayaka's labyrinth). Just try reading the wiki episode by episode."
MadokaMagica,36mkgi,MetasequoiaLeaf,4,Wed May 20 15:54:16 2015 UTC,"There's some really obvious Feminist symbolism integrated into the story. Setting aside the fact that Kyuubey & The Incubators could be a placeholder for just about any sufficiently Patriarchal system, there's more explicit refences throughout the series. Sayaka taking tertiary revenge against the two men on the train pretty much only exists as an attempt to call out shitty attitudes on the part of men. The Kaname family structure being Matriarchal in nature feels very deliberate, especially when Madoka's distance from her mother becomes a plot device in episode 11. And the entirety of the KyuubeyxMadoka conversations are so laden with predator-assault subtext that I actually gasped out loud when it dawned on me (around the third or fourth rewatching) what the writers+animators were going for with those scenes. If you're not sure what to look for, rewatch their conversation in episode 11 and watch Madoka's body language. It's not subtle.  Also, I don't think bringing up Anita in this context is appropriate. To my knowledge, she has never expressed an opinion on this show, and whether you agree with her opinions/rhetoric or not (I can go either way depending on the topic she's discussing) there really isn't a space where you can criticise her without genuinely coming across as a petulant anti-feminist."
MadokaMagica,36mkgi,twinfyre,-1,Wed May 20 17:16:30 2015 UTC,"The reason I brought up Anita Sarkeesian was because she's an example of what modern feminism has become. Thanks to her influence, discussion of Feminism just puts a bad taste in my mouth. Words like ""patriarchy"", ""Rape-culture"", ""misogyny"" and ""oppression"" have lost their meaning because they've become buzz words for people in the Anita Sarkeesian/tumblr movement. It's very rare for me to hear the word ""Patriarchy"" used in a non-ironic fashion.   I'm sorry if you don't think it's appropriate for Madoka Magica, but honestly, her name was the first thing that came to mind when I heard the word Feminist.   So yeah, you could say past experience has made me a bit anti-feminist (I'm egalitarian). Whether it's ""petulant"" or not is up to a third party.  Back to the subject at hand, though. There are definitely a lot of scenes in the anime that draw parallels with problems that many women suffer from. But these parallels could be pointed out without bringing the subject of Feminism into the discussion. For example, when I saw the show with a couple of friends of mine, we couldn't help but notice that the scene where Sayaka made a contract with Kyubey seemed very... suggestive. Like how his ""ear things"" stabbed into her chest. Kyubey can be very creepy if you listen to his dialogue outside of the context of the show."
MadokaMagica,36mkgi,MerlinAesalon,2,Wed May 20 18:38:50 2015 UTC,"Discussing ""problems that many women suffer from"" IS discussing feminism, by definition. If you don't recognize that, you don't know what feminism is -- which doesn't surprise me, since the only points of reference you seem to have for feminism are Anita Sarkeesian and tumblr."
MadokaMagica,36mkgi,MetasequoiaLeaf,-3,Wed May 20 20:07:38 2015 UTC,"That's my point. The definition has been muddled. It used to be considered a movement for equality. But now it has devolved into misandry and hate mongering. ""problems that many women suffer from"" might be feminism by definition. But by context and social background, it isn't anymore."
MadokaMagica,36mkgi,MerlinAesalon,0,Wed May 20 20:21:31 2015 UTC,"None of those except the kaname family is academic feminism, which is what I'd assume they'd be discussing in an academic setting.  Of course, if they're going to be discussing modern feminism, then all those points apply."
MadokaMagica,36mkgi,MetasequoiaLeaf,3,Wed May 20 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"Patriarchy, misogyny, predatory behavior, assault -- these are all things that get discussed very often and very thoroughly in academic discussions of feminism."
MadokaMagica,36mkgi,twinfyre,1 point,Wed May 20 20:09:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe academic was the wrong word. Classical feminism? The feminism I learned about in an academic setting was about equality between the sexes (which now that I think about it did include patriarchy and misogyny to some extent - although I don't think the Sayaka scene was really feminist in that sense), not about assault or predatory behavior."
MadokaMagica,36mkgi,FierceAlchemist,3,Wed May 20 20:23:55 2015 UTC,"You don't seem to have any idea what the study of feminism actually consists of. If your only points of reference for feminists are Anita Sarkeesian and JesuOtaku, then I can assume you've never taken a gender studies or women's studies course, that your only source of information on the subject is heavily distorted and editorialized stories on the internet, and that you therefore have no context for the types of discussions of feminism and feminist readings of literature that actually go on in academic settings.   And before anyone gets on my case about ""gender studies classes are bullshit,"" I have two things to say. One, as someone who has studied gender studies in an academic setting, along with several other subjects reddit seems to hate on (such as Philosophy and Anthropology), I can tell you that the first thing discussed in these sorts of courses are why the subject matter is worth learning about. Two, do you think it's acceptable for someone to declare things like evolution or astrophysics are bullshit if they've never studied them and know nothing about them? Or history, or pharmaceuticals, or anything else? If not, why do you feel that it's okay for you or anyone to dismiss studies of feminism out of hand?"

Though I personally believe that the self hatred thing only really comes into play after the Rebellion movie starts, the timing is a minor issue in the end.  I also posit that her guilt at having done such a thing is also why she doesn't want the others to awaken.   One of the reasons that I believe contribute to the instability of her world is the idea that this is as much her Hell as it's meant to be Madoka's paradise, a nightmare of her own making from which escaping would mean unraveling it, making her own personal damnation essentially meaningless. She probably doesn't want to stick around,  but she dare not leave. She probably doesn't have a choice there and, as a result,  is constantly reminded of what she can never have. Hell, she'll probably drop the whole thing once Madoka dies of old age..."
MadokaMagica,36kqtp,darklooshkin,2,Wed May 20 03:34:34 2015 UTC,"One personal opinion I have is that Homura would disagree with everyone who says that ""Homura did nothing wrong"", and one reason she calls herself a devil is that Homura believes that her choice is morally wrong and understands that Madoka may have been happy.  Although, I always thought that Homura's conclusion from the flower scene was accurate, and that yes it's possible to be satisfied ""dying"" in order to save the lives of others, but that doesn't mean being dead is itself more enjoyable than being alive.  I also thought that the Homuverse, where Kyubey suffers from grief, was better than the Madokaverse, where prepubescent girls die fighting against grief."
MadokaMagica,36kqtp,aattss,1 point,Fri May 22 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"Madoka and Homura are said to represent selfless and selfish love, respectively. I would argue, however, that both characters represent opposite forms of selfless love.       Yes, yes, yes! I couldn't agree more. I agree with practically everything said here because I have had more or less the same ideas. Your sister was able to put into words concepts I could only roughly outline.  Something I never considered was her interpretation of the flower field scene. That scene has always made me uneasy, for I always viewed it as Homura's false idealization of Madoka reinforcing her crazed ideas. However, I really like the interpretation of this moment being one of equalization, one that Homura cannot bear. I won't say I'm 100% in agreement, so I will have to rewatch the scene with this in mind.  Lastly, I never made the connection between Homura's complete lack of self-respect and her utter rejection of potential reciprocation of love from Madoka. That is a fascinating idea that I am going to have to think over for a while.  Great post!"
MadokaMagica,36jdqp,BlackOptx,9,Tue May 19 20:39:02 2015 UTC,"I always loved how polarizing Sayaka was. I ran a survey a while back for best girl and Sayaka had the second most #1 votes and at the same time the most last-place votes.  I always felt that a lot of people that dislike her say that she's a very flat character whose sole purpose is to show ""Magical girl bad. No become magical girl,"" but I never saw that as being her only raison d'être. She's a really dynamic character, one of only two of the Quintet who actually ever seems to show any emotion (the other being Kyouko), and probably the most human of the 5 too.  I mean nothing against Homura, but like she's the most cold-hearted person in the entire anime. While I know she's got emotions deep, deep down in that shriveled up heart she has as a result of seeing her love die over and over and over, I can't help but feel a little disgusted at how sometimes I think Kyubey is more emotive than her.   My favorite thing about Sayaka though? She moves on. When the series ends and Sayaka's still dead, she listens to Kyousuke Kamijou perform one more time and then she's spirited away with Madoka to their little corner of the universe. When she's next seen discussing Kamijou, she refers to him as ""Captain Oblivious,"" a move some might see as just being a little poke of fun at him, but I saw it as being a whole lot more than that. She accepted her position in the universe, she accepted that she couldn't be with Kamijou, and she accepted that if she couldn't then it would be best for her own sake to move on and find greener (or in her case redder) pastures. And she was happier for doing so too!  TL;DR: Sayaka is best girl."
MadokaMagica,36jdqp,patchesyar,4,Wed May 20 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"Idk man, after the movie I sympathise a lot more with Homura than Sayaka. I mean Sayaka is at least my second favourite, and she was my favourite after her arc. However, I felt that my enjoyment of teh character was larguely influenced by how she was fleshed out throught Kyouko. So when I look at the character exclusively, I think there is some to be desired.   Whereas Homuhomu is just fucking op and my tears can't deal."
MadokaMagica,36jdqp,Wowbad,2,Wed May 20 00:41:52 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. Sayaka was the most tragic character in the show, in my opinion. At the beginning she seemed really positive all the time. But as things went on she slowly got worse and worse until her tranformation at episode 8."
MadokaMagica,36jdqp,twinfyre,3,Tue May 19 23:44:40 2015 UTC,"I posted a comment about why Sayaka is unique in her struggles in another thread and I'll re-post it here:  ...Sayaka's story arc is the saddest of all. I think that's because she was such a child, right up to the end. Homura is clearly the most mature of the girls, for obvious reasons. Kyoko keeps her shit together and grows up in a real hurry, then seems to soften towards the end of her story as she becomes more invested in the others' lives. Mami's death is gruesome, but she had the fortitude and maturity to survive on her own for a while, plus she got to enjoy a brief spell of hope and happiness before she bit the big one. Madoka ends up receiving Unlimited Cosmic Power without the itty-bitty living space. And Sayaka...well, she makes a sweet but childish wish, watches her hopes and dreams wither irreversibly on the vine within the span of weeks, and exhausts herself night after night fighting hellish abominations, until ultimately she succumbs to despair when she finally, finally matures enough to see how brutal and cruel the world can be. I don't really see any of the other girls as children, except for Madoka for a while, but Sayaka stays a little naive kid from start to finish. So, to see a kid experience all that...it's heartbreaking..."
MadokaMagica,36jdqp,PrinceOfCups13,2,Wed May 20 02:38:00 2015 UTC,"She had the second-best Holy Quintet transformation after Kyouko. The music was good, the animation was good, but I still don't like her that much."
MadokaMagica,36jdqp,ChainedProfessional,2,Tue May 19 23:02:08 2015 UTC,Best girl. She deserves to be happy
MadokaMagica,36jdqp,exusia,2,Wed May 20 00:02:34 2015 UTC,"I loved Sayaka's characterization, from beginning to end, she just had this youthful enthusiasm for doing the right thing even if it seemed hopeless, it was heart breaking to see her eventual corruption and transformation.  But honestly, all the characters from the show are well written and sympathetic."
MadokaMagica,36jdqp,waterfromhell,2,Wed May 20 15:14:20 2015 UTC,"I love Sayaka because she is human and by far the most relatable character of the show. She never was intended to become a magical girl, she is not naturally talented with magical power like Madoka is, she just got caught up in it. Still she signs the contract for pure selfless reasons, to cure the boy she loves, knowing that her fights are gonna be harder and can lose her life. All she wanted was not for Kamijou to love her back, but to show little respect to her. She is the only one of his classmates that cares about him and visits him frequently in the hospital. And as soon as he leaves the hospital and comes back to school he does not even say a simple ""Hi"" to her. At this time she realizes that by becoming a magical girl she is just a husk, an empty soul less shell made for fighting. Her real self is separated in a vulnerable object that can be easily lost or broken. Not only this but her close friend Hitomi, the person she saved a few days ago moves in and takes Kamijou. The final straw was when she heard those men bad-mouthing their girlfriends in the train. Sayaka realized that everyone she saves is ungrateful and selfish, but she hated herself the most for being ""stupid"" to believe she can make the world a better place by risking her soul.  She saw all of her ideals crumble before her eyes, and fell into despair."
MadokaMagica,36jdqp,vesper8008,1 point,Fri May 22 02:33:57 2015 UTC,"She's second place for me. I like Homura for the utter selflessness she shows for Madoka and I sympathise with her struggles and sacrifices.  Sayaka is a bit ingenuous but she too has that element of sacrifice that for some reason makes me like her; unlike Homura, she maintains her human traits (for good or bad). I don't know what makes me like Homura best; it's probably the extreme suffering and frustration that distinguish her journey from Sayaka's intense but shorter-lived ones, and her motives."
MadokaMagica,36jdqp,itaShadd,1 point,Tue May 19 23:40:14 2015 UTC,"My favorite character may be Homura because I'm in love with Groundhog Day-style time loops as a concept, but Sayaka is definitely a close second because of how human she feels. It certainly helps that she's the one who develops the most over the course of the series+movie; everyone else seems to stay in generally the same place from beginning to end. (No I'm not saying that the others don't have any character development, but they don't have as dramatic a change.)"
MadokaMagica,36jdqp,Kyakan,1 point,Tue May 19 23:58:45 2015 UTC,"Sayaka wasnt my favorite, she was more like just above Kyouko. However, very well fleshed out and has a good background/development.  Also Homura wasn't exactly evil/cynical, unless you consider desire and being selfish evil(perhaps you could)? But again those were the reasons why I liked Homura and probably didnt exactly like Sayaka."

MadokaMagica,36a1cr,goanimals,3,Sun May 17 17:22:35 2015 UTC,Like in relation to the manga? I haven't read it but according to MAL it is an adaptation of a sequel to the manga. So yes.   In relation to the anime? Definitely. It is a continuation of the events of the series. First 2 movies simply recap the series.  So yes it is.   Edit: Read below I was mixed up on what came first in terms of anime and movies/manga.
MadokaMagica,36a1cr,Kyakan,9,Sun May 17 17:33:45 2015 UTC,"The manga is based on the anime/movies, not the other way around. Other than that, you're correct."
MadokaMagica,36a1cr,darklooshkin,1 point,Sun May 17 17:57:39 2015 UTC,"And since they both supposedly reflect the same continuity, though some of the designs are different (Homu's shield, kyubei's insanity-inducing grin), which in itself could be an indicator that the manga continuation could go down a different path should they actually make a second manga series, then we can assume that the ending of the manga may well be the ultimate ending of the overall series... hopefully.  Besides, time travelling protagonist/possible antagonist. Is a faceoff between Homura and her own personal Valeyard on the cards? Because that would be epic in scope-and Homura's eventual suffering ('Why do you wear my face?' 'Because I am you.' 'NOOOO!'). Not to mention the grimdark shit both of them would probably pull to stop one another from succeeding in taking away/protecting Madoka.   ... Actually, I've been thinking about that idea a lot.

The manga has one route -- one possible outcome, where Madoka takes Homura with her almost immediately.  The second is the end of the anime, where Homura is shown using wings of despair -- where she masters her own darkness, and is unaffected by it.  The third is Rebellion, where she is overcome by despair and taken advantage of by the Incubators and becomes.  In light of that, I'm picking the anime version, in which she becomes an eternal warrior, touched so deeply by despair that she would never fall to it again.  I like that ideal more than I like her death in the other routes."

MadokaMagica,35yv0g,FoleyX90,6,Thu May 14 17:40:35 2015 UTC,"If my memory serves (I haven't researched this in a long time though), the reasons are as follows-  Homura: She had no memories of the outside world due to being trapped in the labyrinth, just like how you can't tell when you're dreaming 95% of the time  Mami and Kyouko: They died in this timeline (note: Different from changing to a witch in this context). This means that Kyouko and Mami were, in a sense, recreated by Homura in her labyrinth. So they had more or less the same memories as Homura did. This is why Kyouko's home town didn't ""exist,"" because Homura didn't know it.  Madoka: She had no memories so that she could enter Homura's labyrinth undercover and rescue her from inevitably becoming a witch without alerting the incubators to her identity as an all-powerful being that could be exploited to combat the ""entropy"" incubators hate so much  Sayaka and Bebe/Nagisa: these two are Madoka's bodyguards in a sense. They came with Madoka from their little section of the universe. Their role was more or less to make sure that Madoka stayed safe in Homura's labyrinth and that when the time was right, they would break the labyrinth open and rescue Homura (ideally by saving her before she turned, which obviously didn't happen)  I believe that's the explanation for the status of everyone's memories, more or less. The gist is that Homura, Kyouko, and Mami all had Homura's memories, Madoka basically had no memories at all, and Sayaka and Nagisa actually knew what was going on.  [EDIT] Listen to the replies beneath this. I've been meaning to rewatch the series and Rebellion because, as shown, a lot of the details I've completely forgotten.

There's no mention of ""you"" in that line, but in his previous line 僕は君たちの願いごとをなんでも1つ叶えてあげる he specifically says 君たち (kimitachi) which is the plural of ""you"". So he's telling both Madoka and Sayaka that he can grant each of them any one wish."
MadokaMagica,35u55k,krkes551,1 point,Thu May 14 08:25:58 2015 UTC,"Eh, semantics.   He has the capacity to do so, provided his target has the resultant karmic force.   If you think about all the wishes in the series, you could see how the outcome ties to the resultant power of the magical girls."
MadokaMagica,35u55k,TheSeaOfThySoul,1 point,Wed May 13 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"You're agreeing with me. I was wondering whether or not Kyubey actually ever says he can grant anyone any wish, or whether or not he just says he can grant any wish (in madoka's case)."
MadokaMagica,35u55k,TheSeaOfThySoul,1 point,Wed May 13 16:18:13 2015 UTC,"""I can grant the most impossible of miracles.""  That's the important part, it's not a lie, he can.   Can he grant anyone's wish though?   Yes, but to certain extents. As I said earlier, think back to all the wishes made by the girls and the varying power levels and wish-outcomes."

MadokaMagica,35opdz,winterd,8,Tue May 12 07:04:56 2015 UTC,I thought the only reason why Madoka could make such a big wish was of the karmaic shit tied to her.  Some wishes just cant be granted by the incubators. I am pretty sure the show itself discussed this.
MadokaMagica,35opdz,Valiantttt,3,Tue May 12 07:55:45 2015 UTC,"Kyubey itself even expresses its astonishment that Madoka's request is granted as the wish contradicts the contract. Madoka's wish in this case was ""I wish to erase all witches from existence before they're even born. Every witch in the universe, from the past and the future, with my own hands."" Keep in mind that the contract you sign with your soul is that ""I promise that I will turn into a witch in return for having this wish granted.""  It's safe to assume from its reaction that a contract that would break itself would be ungrantable by the powers-that-be behind the incubators and that the wish of Madoka Rebellion Spoiler was an extreme exception to the rule."
MadokaMagica,35opdz,patchesyar,0,Tue May 12 20:20:57 2015 UTC,"Sure, but she changed the fate of thousands of girls throughout much of human history. A wish that would affect just one girl can't require nearly as much energy.  And as far as I know, no limits were specifically stated in the tv show."
MadokaMagica,35opdz,_silentheartsong,1 point,Tue May 12 13:23:49 2015 UTC,I think they have mentioned that Incubators can't bring back the dead.
MadokaMagica,35opdz,Sa_Rart,4,Tue May 12 17:37:01 2015 UTC,"Wishes are intended to grant hope.  If a wish does not generate hope, then it does not generate despair.  If a girl wished for her soul gem to never darken, then it would not -- for as long as she hoped that it would not.    At some point, there is a reckoning, though; there comes a point when you realize what you wished for is not what you hoped it would be, or suffered some form of regret.  That's when it would get you, and you would become unable to maintain your own wish.  But I think it's possible to die before that happens -- that is, it is possible live without feeling regret for a indeterminate time.    The Incubator's mechanics don't always resolve the same way, but according to the series, it is impossible to twist the universe and create ""hope"" without also creating ""despair.""    Madoka was unique in that she was capable of creating an infinite amount of hope and an infinite amount of despair.  In doing so, she become something unbound by cause and effec; thus, time did not apply to her.  Her own reckoning never had to come."
MadokaMagica,35opdz,Sa_Rart,1 point,Tue May 12 23:59:37 2015 UTC,"Dammit!  um...  What if I wished I could never feel emotions again? I would never create hope, but I would never create despair, right? Would I still become a magical girl if I couldn't feel anything?  What now, Incubator?!"
MadokaMagica,35opdz,CarVac,3,Wed May 13 19:05:50 2015 UTC,"Then someone you love would die, and someone would get angry with you for showing no emotion for it, and then you would realize you are closer to an Incubator than anybody else in the world.  Alternatively, you would have created no hope with that wish, and therefore would make no despair, and can therefore waste your life killing things without a reward."
MadokaMagica,35opdz,mashibana,3,Wed May 13 22:16:51 2015 UTC,"In my head canon, if your wish exceeds your potential, you turn into a witch immediately."
MadokaMagica,35opdz,homu,2,Tue May 12 19:36:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think paradoxical wishes could be granted.  As for removing the contract consequences, maybe you could in theory, but the incubators would just refuse requests like those, since you wouldn't turn into a witch and they couldn't harvest your energy."
MadokaMagica,35opdz,Imosa1,2,Tue May 12 15:14:14 2015 UTC,He probably won't.
MadokaMagica,35opdz,SoldierofNod,2,Wed May 13 06:16:14 2015 UTC,"My head cannon is kinda tending toward that the incubator will simulate the universe prior to offering a wish, in order to lower the likelihood of a system breaking wish from ever occurring to a point where it will practically never occur (still trying to figure out if Madoka's wish was actually a problem). So the question is effectively nonsense. The incubator will never offer a wish to someone who will wish for something paradoxical. Hell, it probably wont offer a wish to someone who will wish for something that it can't exploit."
