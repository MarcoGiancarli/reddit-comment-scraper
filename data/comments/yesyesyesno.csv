Also I don't know many hunters that would throw a multi hundred dollar bow on the ground like that and risk breaking it rather than just letting it go. I say the hunter is a pretty good guy.

Battlefield 3, to perform a rendezook a player aims his jet straight up, ejects (which sends him upwards, due to game code working to move players upward instead of in relation to the plane), aims down and shoots an RPG destroying his enemy at his tail, then his jet catches back up with him falling and he re-enters the jet.  Planetside 2, mechanic allows the player to roll the jet / ESF and eject upwards slightly if inverted (again eject angle allows the player to travel in a motion outside their vehicle in relation to the vehicle and catch back up to it), to rendezook the player begins the roll, ejects and then shoots a decimator / rocket, destroying another aircraft, then re-enters the jet / ESF.    about | flag for glitch | Summon: urbanbot, what is something?"

What I mainly object to is countries (e.g. France (they basically invented the fucking things!) and Germany) where you can't change credit/banking card PINs, which is borderline criminal.  So far, I've always got to go back to glorious Schwiiz to change mine.  Seriously, though, there's no legitimate excuse for the US to have remained magstripe-only territory for as long as it has - none whatsoever.  It's a combination of cost sensitivity and laziness, both of which are incredibly shortsighted, as it's been the cause of fraud-related losses in the hundreds of millions, maybe even billions of dollars.  RFID is not vulnerable per se.  It's just a transmission mechanism, just like wifi.  Whether it's susceptible to MITM attacks or other exploits depends entirely on the card and point of sale implementation."

yesyesyesno,31q7oj,tmiw,2,Tue Apr 7 17:07:11 2015 UTC,"Oh holy shit.  Holy holy shit.  Well delivered, +1 for you.  I'm actually surprised that someone from Oberthur would let themselves be quoted on the potential cost of going chip & PIN rather than the unfuckingbelievable stupid of NOT doing it.  Wow."
yesyesyesno,31q7oj,DontMentionLobsters,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:51:47 2015 UTC,"EMV is coming to the US this year   I guess I should remember it then.. and then maybe change my PIN today. After all, I'm in glorious Schwiiz myself :).  Usually I'm not lazy about security, but I only use my credit card on travels and for online shopping. Both don't require a PIN in most cases, so I keep forgetting it because I don't use it."
yesyesyesno,31q7oj,P1r4nha,2,Tue Apr 7 12:26:43 2015 UTC,"Yup, I know, I've seen your username pop up a lot in /r/switzerland.  Your CC is actually one of the securest and most reliable means of payment, if you use it correctly and stay aware of risks (and pay off your balance).  Every card issuer spends a lot of resources on statistical risk analysis, which includes building up a very powerful consumer/payment profile for you.  As you're Swiss, this is subject to very strict data protection rules, so it's not something to worry about in any big brother kind of way - e.g. they may not use it to market to you or sell it to third parties, that kind of thing.  The reason this is important is that a good issuer will understand your spending profiles and call out anything suspicious.  My main card issuing bank has gotten extremely good at this over the past 10 or so years I've been with them; so far they've only blocked my card incorrectly twice, and each time have gotten it working again immediately when I called to bitch.  Compared to several dozen dodgy transactions which they correctly blocked for whatever reason.  Card payments also give you one of the best recourse options for disputing payments, you get insurance for payments, etc. - a lot of people read panicky stories about card fraud, which are largely nonsense.  It exists (again, much much more with magstripe than EMV) but it's not that huge an issue, particularly if combined with outside verification (e.g. Verified by Visa with either a password or an SMS code for online payments.)"
yesyesyesno,31q7oj,DontMentionLobsters,3,Tue Apr 7 12:41:28 2015 UTC,"Yup, I know, I've seen your username pop up a lot in /r/switzerland.   I'm famous \o/!  In everything you said, does it matter if it's a debit card or a credit card? I usually don't use the credit card, but the debit card all the time, except in foreign countries that are less likely to accept 'Maestro', but 'Master Card' most of the time... like for paying for lobsters or something."
yesyesyesno,31q7oj,P1r4nha,2,Tue Apr 7 13:02:29 2015 UTC,"Not really, unless you're doing payments where a credit card specifically is required (e.g. an online purchase.)  I am not familiar with any debit cards that require a signature, but while a magstripe Maestro where you enter your PIN code may be less susceptible than a signature-based credit card (less opportunity for duplicating it), it's still vulnerable to attacks on old point of sale terminals.  Basically, a magstripe is trivial to (a) read and (b) duplicate.  Take it from there.  With chip & PIN cards, it doesn't make much difference, since they're equally secure, and if in any way vulnerable, vulnerable in the same way.  Again, the only real difference is that of online payments, since you don't get an opportunity to validate the card with a PIN (it asks for card #, exp. date, verification #, and your name/address).  That's why you should use SMS- or password-based authentication for web card transactions whenever possible.  The main difference is that with a debit card, you pay whatever fee the issuing bank (or the bank managing the point of sale) wants to / is able to charge for the convenience of using it.  With credit, you or the vendor (or both) pay some small fee which basically subsidizes the card issuer's anti-fraud work, (and helps the CEO buy, uhm, lobster...)"

Depending on what company you go with, you can either use a snowboard or the flat board they had pictured there. It's not cardboard, it's like a sort of building material that's waxy on one side. I never thought to ask what it was.  Anywho, if you go on a wetter day (the Namib desert runs right up to the sea so it can get pretty damp), you'll want to do the flat board but if it's really dry, a snowboard is apparently tons of fun. Also, the dunes are absolutely teaming with life by the way of sand fleas. You don't really feel them biting, but you can see them if you're sitting out there.  I can't really describe sandboarding except that it's just like sledding, only its 70 degrees out. You never want to stop. The dunes are awesome. I was shaking sand out of my clothes for weeks afterwards. Please go if you ever get the opportunity."

She changed lanes into a lane that she couldn't clearly see. I'm sure she's done it successfully before but it's like closing your eyes and stepping out into traffic to cross the street.
yesyesyesno,2wcfn5,MotherFuckin-Oedipus,8,Thu Feb 19 18:40:24 2015 UTC,Or just show it as a PSA on television.  Most idiot drivers I see on the road are far beyond driver's ed.  They should be reminded that they'll inevitably cause an accident if they don't improve.
yesyesyesno,2wcfn5,MattieF,4,Thu Feb 19 19:00:59 2015 UTC,True. Maybe it needs to be in Youtube/Hulu ad's or something.

Something that looks like a little surface rust could be rusted through and completely ruin the integrity of the frame/bars.

yesyesyesno,2tdrvw,ekarter,10,Fri Jan 23 07:09:58 2015 UTC,I believe you both are wrong. If you notice the ripple is slightly ahead of him and when it hits the end wall the reverberations are what cause it to break.
yesyesyesno,2tdrvw,funkpandemic,2,Fri Jan 23 14:55:36 2015 UTC,Alternate theory: There is one well-lit end of the pool and one dark end - the light could be causing one end of the pool to be warmer than the other and thus have thinner ice.
yesyesyesno,2tdrvw,asouer,5,Tue Jan 27 02:47:51 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that when he has forward momentum he isn't exerting as much force on the ice. He falls through after he slows down.

yesyesyesno,2qlmga,sohcgt96,11,Wed Jan 28 22:36:31 2015 UTC,"You know what though, that guy is in pretty could shape if he could climb up there drunk. I'll give him that."
yesyesyesno,2qlmga,Hello-Universe,12,Sat Jan 3 22:16:18 2015 UTC,"""I'll buy you a shot if you don't do this"" - real friend  ""K, dude, your in the way of my camera"" - asshole  ""He gonna crack his fuckin head open"" - asshole  ""dude don't do this"" - friend  ""No definitely do it. I'll buy you a shot if you do it"" - asshole"
yesyesyesno,2qlmga,zakii,32,Sun Dec 28 18:10:22 2014 UTC,"Wow, the guy holding the camera is an asshole.  Dave needs some better friends."
yesyesyesno,2qlmga,WestonP,6,Sun Dec 28 07:32:41 2014 UTC,"Not really. Friends are the leading source of bad ideas. If you don't want to do something, then stand up for yourself (and come up with your own bad ideas)."
yesyesyesno,2qlmga,gibsoncoca,0,Sun Dec 28 19:10:16 2014 UTC,"Yeah. I think the biggest problem here is the suggestibility of the guy climbing, owing to drunkenness. There are 4 ways I can see this going: 1. Establish the need for self control when drinking, 2. drink less, 3. stay away from people who will persuade you to do stupid things, or 4. keep doing what you're doing, ""for the story"" or whatever"
yesyesyesno,2qlmga,dcoupl,12,Sun Jan 25 18:45:00 2015 UTC,that looked pretty dead. did he died?
yesyesyesno,2qlmga,augmaticdisport,12,Sun Dec 28 09:41:30 2014 UTC,"It's on LiveLeak, of course he died"
yesyesyesno,2qlmga,syncerr,12,Sun Dec 28 16:18:29 2014 UTC,"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2891855/Is-dumbest-dare-Video-shows-drunk-man-climbing-bike-sign-outside-store-horrific-results.html  Rendered unconscious. Suffered ""several broken bones"". Wow."
yesyesyesno,2qlmga,Divamergency,5,Sat Jan 3 13:31:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume no, because that allows me to continue to feel good about laughing at his stupidity."
