startups,3e2rew,rootfiend,6,Tue Jul 21 22:28:09 2015 UTC,"You are correct, Github could handle the code, but there needs to be a story behind the code, that's what the site would be about"
startups,3e2rew,Jiekkdk,6,Tue Jul 21 23:52:09 2015 UTC,so... github? A repository with just a readme where anyone can open PR to add there own dead startup repository?
startups,3e2rew,dibsODDJOB,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:15:53 2015 UTC,He's asking for a site that compiles failed startup code. There would be a list with stories and the listings would then link to the Github repo.

startups,3e2rew,coffeeonsunday,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:04:34 2015 UTC,interesting idea!  but there's so much emotion there.
startups,3e2rew,TDaltonC,2,Tue Jul 21 21:11:18 2015 UTC,I think this is a good idea
startups,3e2rew,ifyoucantcallme,2,Tue Jul 21 21:54:00 2015 UTC,You should find a way to reincarnate the codes for equity. People will be more inclined to put their codes up by salvaging some potential finances.  Maybe you were the weak link but the product itself had potential. I only say this because I've had to go through 2 developers with the interpersonal skills of squirrels who were brilliant coders. Don't know how they would be able to survive and thrive on their own.  This concept is great. Bappfromthegrave
startups,3e2rew,JrRogers06,3,Tue Jul 21 23:36:16 2015 UTC,"1) Maybe. But there's not much in there for me to be proud of or anyone else to covet.   2) Probably not. If it's a general problem, then I'd rather use a code base that has always been open source. They tend to provide much more of a framework then someones one off rat's nest of code. They are also maintained going forward. If it's an idiosyncratic problem, I'm going to have to build most of it myself anyway. Starting with someone else's (maybe awful) code wouldn't make that any easier.  I've seen startups do this before (open source their git repos when the money runs out), and I don't think I've ever seen them really get used.   tldr: There's a big difference between 'open source code' and 'published formerly-private code.'"
startups,3e2rew,tacos_are_good,6,Tue Jul 21 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for chipping in, although I am not expecting people to necessarily use the entire codebase. There might be a particular feature that you were curious as to how it was implemented. Or just to look at code structure and style of a startup that was probably well funded and had the best developers but just couldn't find product market fit. Or maybe you DO want to run a similar startup but think the failed startup had a wrong approach."

If did a little bit of annotating for each project/startup, you could charge a small fee for someone to be able to browse the project from behind the scenes. Would be best on a case by case basis, where the failed startup would post to the site and set/suggest a price."

startups,3e2rew,FearAndLawyering,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:39:50 2015 UTC,"lots of people would love to have it, but i don't think many people would hand over their hard-created work so easily. establishing an open-source product from the get go is very different from putting it up somewhere afterwards, and i feel like anyone starting open-source would be on github already, since it handles the entire process well from archiving to forking to compiling, etc.  nice thought, though. i just think that there's already a really good method in place."

startups,3e2rew,tsredd,10,Tue Jul 21 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"Code quality is rarely why startups fail, it is usually finding product-market fit. Maybe the CEO sucked at his job, maybe they couldn't get funding, there are a myriad of other reasons good code gets discarded"
startups,3e2rew,somethingrather,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"Speculation, source? I'll agree it may not be the code's fault but anything beyond that is guessing. Ultimately, it's code written by/for people that couldn't execute and is usually terrible, outsourced and written below market rates.  I get hired to fix these kind of codebases all the time. I would not recommend using code from a failed product. It's not literally the code's fault but it usually does point out red flags.  Lots of startups that don't fail have terrible code as well. These are dangerous generalizations to make but I think the sentiment remains the same - there's a taint surrounding failed startups and something somewhere didn't work."
startups,3e2rew,FearAndLawyering,5,Tue Jul 21 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"There's also a taint surrounding junkyards but you can find diamonds in them. Besides I am not advocating grabbing an entire codebase necessarily, it's more like a particular feature that you would love to see how it was done. This would obviously be for a niche set of people who have the ability to dissect code. The question really just asked if you would like to see under the hood of old startups, maybe to learn, maybe to criticise or just because you are curious."
startups,3e2rew,somethingrather,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:25 2015 UTC,"I think your point is clear and great, yes, there are some startups which had products I loved but had to close down. They had perhaps a nice global toaster service or something like that which I'd like to compare my implementations with.   I'd feel comfortable (I love open sourcing things that are not generating revenue and could possibly generate revenue for others) Yes!"
startups,3e2rew,FearAndLawyering,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:57:03 2015 UTC,"Call me cynical, but I don't see any use for it. A google search will tell you how to do just about any particular feature you could want to do with an open source project that's always been open source.  The idea of a startup graveyard itself is neat. I don't know of any sites/subreddits that are SPECIFICALLY that. You can definitely learn a lot from a startup from how they failed, but I dunno how much you can learn from their code. 90% of the time it seems like if you're capable of reading/following the code, you're capable of making it yourself to begin with."

I do personally believe that the culture in the business world (especially startups) is one that celebrates the workaholic martyr entrepreneur.   Look at HBOs Silicon Valley - the main character Richard is hardly ever seen outside the context of working on his startup. He is working so hard he is having borderline panic attacks. Yet, his company is valued at millions and he is cast as this everyday superhero.   Take his foil, Urlich, who is portrayed as a lazy hanger-on to Richard. Urlich takes credit when it's not his, he talks over people, and generally acts the fool. Yet Urlich might possibly be the most valuable member of the team: he's sold his startup already and has experience in the business world, he's helped get Pied Piper noticed and funded, and defended their business when the founder wouldn't.   The audience is meant to worship Richards character and idolize him as what we need to become if one day we want to ""make it big"" in the tech world. But it's really Urlichs character who has figured out how to have fun, relax, and balance his work/life so he's not constantly having nervous breakdowns or jumping off roofs.   My two cents."

startups,3e3wjg,consumerfocused,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:30:56 2015 UTC,"It definitely feels like the symptoms of depression can equally be those seen as classifying you as a ""proper"" entrepreneur. If you're not stressed and working long hours you're doing it wrong... I don't really believe that's true.   I've been on the verge of total burnout a couple of times because of trying to live up to those expectations. Changing my outlook from looking busy to working to be more productive as been a big factor. However, what I really think had kept my team stronger is having a day emotional check in. Usually it's nothing more than a ""yeah I'm good"", but every so often it's been a place for someone to reveal their concerns and stresses and has allowed us to stop things escalating.  I'm not saying everyone should hold hands and reveal all, but feeling supported and comfortable enough to say you're struggling can be a lifesaver in itself."
startups,3e3wjg,TiddlyWotsits,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:48:35 2015 UTC,"To be honest I think all employment/startup members and anyone for that matter should be speaking to a psychiatrist/mental health worker on a regular basis, once every 2 weeks/1month, even if its a 30minute session on the phone. Depression and anxiety are really bad things and can easily escalate into more problems and manifest themselves.   By being able  to have someone to talk to about those thing it can prevent them and if they do ever pop up can be solved asap and get the person back to feeling normal and happy and then being more productive.  We have a weird thought process and culture of seeing these people when its to late, and i'm guilty of it myself, we need to be preparing for these things.

The core feature that will set this website aside is, simply, being user centric. We've found that many other sites are bloated, slow, and hard to use. Some websites which are simpler, don't look as clean or professional. We're trying to find the middle-ground, where our core services go unhindered - searching. We will have secondary pages with articles, job application prep, and so on; but we will try to segregate that from the search (think Google vs Yahoo for instance).  Our goal is to make a job-search engine that we ourselves would love to use, and build on top of that for the user.  Appreciate your feedback! If you have any more, feel free to contact us!"

I was wondering, did you have a pure account when adding Starup Stash to Product Hunt?  Here is a point why I'm asking. When we were launching our first project, we decided to put it on Product Hunt and got around 40 upvotes, but the app is still in upcoming. And it's okay! Because we weren't ready to thousands of users that could come from PH (I understand it now :) ). But still, why was it so?  And now, regarding the fact I love Product Hunt with all my heart (from PH I've learned about loads of startups which I use every day) and contribute, and I'm active, and I'm feeling like I'm a part of it, I'm scared to share my new project on it (which I belive PH community will love).

startups,3e3v7p,gobstopper89,2,Tue Jul 21 19:23:38 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest only accepting money rather than equity. The problem with equity is most startups will fail. The chances of the next Snapchat walking through your door and offering you equity is extremely minimal. Also, equity can be a very difficult thing to deal with because how are you to know if the person presenting you the startup knows anything about that startup's field, how to get users, how to scale, how to get investment, etc. You would really be building their startup for free and cross your fingers that the person offering you equity knows what they are doing. You'd really need to sit down with the person if you decide to take equity and set goals for the startup. If the startup doesn't meet these goals in this period of time then payment will need to be provided to you."
startups,3e3v7p,froglax11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:00:21 2015 UTC,"Is it common for startups to offer an ""if these goals aren't met, then cash payment will be provided"" conditions, rather than the ""here's equity, we sink or swim together"" deal?"
startups,3e3v7p,froglax11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:43:27 2015 UTC,"It's probably not extremely common, but it is the best way to not get involved in an at risk investment where it is all or nothing. I know when investors give investments to startups, they will set a goal system. The startup will continue to have to meet the goals in order to continue to receive funding. This way the investor doesn't get completely screwed over if the startup just decides to drag their feet on the project and chew up the investment. Also, if a person doesn't have the money to pay you to create their app/website then they probably don't have money to spend on marketing and bringing in customers/users. You could also ask for equity upfront and start making the project but let the person know that once you reach a certain milestone on their project, then you expect to get paid."
startups,3e3v7p,summerinside,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:04:02 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I work at a consultancy that has a history of partnering with early-stage startups and following those endeavors from POC to private sale / IPO.  The model that I find to work most often is variant of incremental funding.  Investors do incremental funding it all the time - it's more common than you'd think.  An entrepreneur brings an idea to an investor, and they work together to determine a contract of very specific schedule of milestones, and the related funding increments that will be unlocked at each milestone.  If the entrepreneur doesn't (can't) meet the milestone, the investor minimizes her losses.  A hyper-simplified example of incremental funding:   $1.4M of initial seed $1M for acquiring 1 million users $600k at the point of the first $200k of income, (etc, you get the schedule)   Now, for a technical partnership, I'd schedule the contract in the same way, putting a dollar value on development time (with a higher value for more senior/experienced resources).  Additionally, the owner(s) of the dev shop should also require a position on the board of directors, so that there are controls over the CEO should the company be mis-managed.  In exchange for equity and a position on the board, the development shop can offer:   technical direction & architecture technical implementation Project delivery & quality analysis HR capabilities (network) for identifying and hiring  Connections to network of funding sources and other interesting partners   When it's done right, it can be a very effective partnership."

Perhaps you could make it fixed width and keep some padding so the distance between the left and right text isn't as high.  I think because of similar reasons the headers don't stand out as much. They're all the way on the side and duplicated left and right, but not exactly the same (Enter data instantly vs. Instantly Enter your data).  On a positive note, I'm usually not a big fan of these one page scrollers, but I actually like this effect of the repeated phone image that alternates sides.

This is pretty big in my opinion because: The Founder doesn't seem to have a strong track record of building businesses if you judge his credentials per LinkedIn. Program structure is very casually defined. ""we'll meet a few times / week, you'll need to make appointments to meet with mentors"" Very little time has been invested in the website.   This program smacks of an MVP, though I'm not even sure the minimum requirements (knowledgeable mentors, program definition) have been met.  If you're truly just starting out, want to ""get your feet wet"" in learning ""startup basics"", and can get in at a substantial discount/free, this may be worth it.

You're targeting both those looking for a tour guide and those who might provide them and tour operators.  Personally, I think your home page needs to sell to your revenue generating market. Whether that's tour operators or actual tourists is up to you.   A good copywriter can help appeal to the target market on the homepage and then write the secondary pages to go after the other groups you need to run the business. There could be a page for tourists, offering guides, a page for tour operators and one for people you want to submit local guides.

What worked for us was to hire a business law firm that had deep connections with VCs.  They made the initial intro's as well as handled all of the business setup and such.  They were an utter godsend in ensuring we were structured correctly to achieve our goals.  Their intro's led to me finding a CEO with strong venture contacts as well as direct contacts with VCs.    Another route is Silicon valley bank.  The bankers there are super connected and are open to making intro's as well if you are polite.  I can't stress this enough the VC community is tiny.  They all know eachother and you don't want to do something stupid and get known as being difficult.    If you really want to guerrilla it your best bet is the bar at the Rosewood hotel on Sand Hill Road on a thursday afternoon.  Tons of deals happen there and a huge number of people in that bar are part of the VC world.  You may be able to make connections just from doing that.  It actually happened to me once when i was relaxing after a day of pitching.   Above all have your 1 line pitch, 30 second and few min pitches down cold before you try to speak to anyone.  I'd also suggest using your first meeting with a VC not for pitching but disclaiming that you are there for feedback and would like their opinions.  Pause with each slide and ask questions.  LISTEN to what they say even if it contradicts your thesis on success.  Ask if they know of others who might be interested and if they would be willing to make intro's."

Unless you're on some type of commissions based job (eg sales) then generally your exact output within a company isn't so perfectly correlated with your income.  You can dance around the facts all you want and I'm sure there are exceptions, but if you remove the financial constraint of actually committing to a startup and people aren't able. I wouldn't bet on them getting anywhere. They just aren't the kind of people that generally succeed. A few get lucky, sure, but that's exactly luck. A few people win the lottery too.

Many of my colleagues at Facebook, Google, and Apple have significant equity positions based on term deals (measured in years) that facilitate their lifestyle while working on new ideas.

startups,3dyylw,PvtUnternehmer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:19:02 2015 UTC,"Go to the frats   I like the idea of going to colleges, but I think the better market here is groups of roommates who don't throw parties quite as often. (I'm not trying to argue, just giving them some things to think about if they take their product to campuses.) You might find some of these people around frats though, so it could still be a good place to start in general. Looking at the only party package currently available, it's not something I could have seen a frat buying.  For example, my frat in college used to buy solo cups in packs of 200, not 20, and since someone is still going to need to stock up on supplies with this product (it doesn't include liquor), we'd have preferred to pick up our own cups, mixers, liquor, et cetera from local places that we know have good deals.  For a frat, I could see buying a ""theme in a box"" rather than a ""party in a box"", where the expectation was that we have everything needed to party but that the box would fill out a theme with a bunch of decorations. I think there's more value in a true ""party in a box"" with all the cups and drinks and such for groups that don't party quite as frequently so won't keep those things stocked up, doesn't know where to get the best deals, doesn't know exactly what they want, and so on."
startups,3dyylw,prahv,2,Tue Jul 21 13:17:45 2015 UTC,As someone who just graduated and was in a frat I thought party in a box was kinda dumb but my ears perked up when I read theme in a box.

startups,3e2sac,Intra78,2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:06 2015 UTC,"I think you need to have a clear understanding of who your target is. My startup is also built around clients putting code on their site. What we did was create a wordpress plugin that put the code on their site. Since wordpress has a huge market share, a majority of our clients use the wordpress plugin. Unless your target is web developers, most people get really confused when asked to put code on their site. Also, I remember when first using adsense, google provided a simple form for you to enter your web master's email and directions were automatically sent to them. I thought that was pretty cool.  Regarding onboarding: At the beginning, individual meetings is absolutely necessary. This is the easiest way to build trust. Otherwise, if you're driving traffic to your site, an informative video can be well worth it.  When deciding how to pitch your service, remember that people don't buy features, they buy value. Tell/show them the benefits of using it, not the features."

If you don't want to hire someone then your best bet is probably trial and error, set both up running the same ad campaign and see which sells more within a week.

startups,3e1sj9,XPostLinker,0,Tue Jul 21 08:24:17 2015 UTC,"A standard way of building up e-commerce customer base is start by going where the customers already are.  That unfortunately means listing on amazon, ebay etc. They have a pre existing customer base of people who are looking to buy - it can also help you prove the market exists.  once you are listed on those types of market places and you are selling then need to provide a solid customer experience between the customer and your brand. Send branded packages, free gifts(?) and discounts or incentives if they buy from you direct. You need people to know that you exist - this is much easier when they have one of your products in their hand and they are using it.  That way - you are making money while also hopefully converting to repeat business and working on generating loyalty through positive customer experience.  Give discount codes that can be used on your site directly, so buying the product is always cheaper from your site.  You then have data on which products sell best, from which you can create PPC campaigns to those items that are more likely to sell - this keeps your cost per sale down - and then do your best to cross sell to additional products [customers who bought this product, also bought these...]  building a brand as well as a customer base from scratch is hard work and takes a long time.

startups,3dxcfh,xxabbxxxd,14,Mon Jul 20 08:53:14 2015 UTC,"For most of our parts we became the supplier as we purchased sveral cnc machines and learned how to use them. I had some background in this as I worked in a amchine while studying industrial design at Arizona State. We don't make every single component, though, so I sourec parts via google and the telephone. One of our products needed a rubebr grip. I found one I liked in a bike shop and searched for the name of the manufacturer on the packaging. Called them up, and eventually reached a sales rep and negotaited an order.  I calulated how much it costs me to run the shop per minute (that includes fixed costs as well as labor, consumables, power, insurances, etc. and is based on a 40-hour work week. If we ever run multpile shifts, that cost will come down a bit as we'd be getting more from the fixed part of our costs.) When we design a new product, I time how long it takes to go from raw material to finished part and multiply that by the minute cost. I add in materials costs and use that as my manufacturing cost. this then gets multiplied for fun and profit. I don't use anything fancy to keep track of this. I figure it out once then forget about it. From there, I just watch the accounting software, which is very basic, to make sure that our real costs aren't creeping up and that our pe-minute costs remain accurate. We're a company of 5 so time is not somethign we have lots of, so I like to come up with Rules of Thumb (based on real data) and use those, whith a sanity check once a month.  We don't import materials or parts, but we do sell a lot to customers overseas. These are direct sales so we just mail stuff.(we've actually sent an order to Timbuktu...irrelevant but fun to mention.)  Almost every day. Manufacturing stuff yourself or letting someone else do it and managing the resulting supply chain is like captaining an old russian submarine. Stuff is always breaking and there's no reliable manual to tell you how to fix it. The biggest issue for us is having our vendors run out of stock on critical parts. This can not hurts production, but customer relations as well because the vedors don't always know or won't say when they'll have your critical part back in stock, which means you can only give vague answers to your customers. Not good. We get around this by either moving more of those parts to internal production (often requiring costly but one-time expenditures) or finding multiple vendors or making huge purchases (our least favorite option.) And though it sounds funny, we use mcmaster carr a lot for stuff. They're not the cheapest, but they have a shitton of components and you can almost always get them next day. Great for prototyping and to get you out of a pinch. I always design around a mcmaster part then find a cheaper source for production. This gives me warma nd fuzzies knowing I can always get the parts I need and keep customers happy (at the expense of some profit.)  Selling more product and keeping all the stuff the shop needs to run (raw material to hand cleaner) ordered. It seems like I spend way too much time ordering stuff. I keep meaning to automate this ."

Biggest roadblocks have been lack of ""caring"" by 3rd parties. No one will care as much about your product as you - that carries across your entire value chain.

It's best to have someone there nearly 24/7 who speaks the local language to ensure that things are being done properly.  Without knowing the type of product, it's hard to identify what challenges you'll run into. However cash flow is usually challenging until you get going at a good pace.

How do you keep track of unit costs?

Easy, we use local post services, for EU shipments it is piece of cake, for international - also not hard, as most of the responsibility is on receiving side - customs duties (if applicable)   Were there any unexpected roadblocks you ran into that hurt production?   Yes, many of them, some of them could be cured if I would start over again, some not, especially the ones concerning production process, manufacturers have 100 and one problem and there are a lot of promises made, but the work is stall.

startups,3dyffv,JFT96_,3,Tue Jul 21 13:03:35 2015 UTC,"I used the beta. Was not impressed.   A lot of the items I saw were actually more expensive than other major online sites. That makes more sense now that it appears their business model is essentially just buying the stuff elsewhere and selling it at a big loss. It appears the magic pricing algorithm the site speaks of is mostly just a scraper that finds the prices on other sites so they can then ""sell"" the item below that price (but they're actually just buying it on the other site and selling it at a big loss). There was a lot of hype around this site but the reality isn't looking that great so far.  Site figures out a way to sell $500 worth of merchandise for $250... thinks it's worth $3 billion. If that's not a bubble then I don't know what is!"
startups,3dyffv,applebaum7,2,Mon Jul 20 16:20:25 2015 UTC,"I too had early access and was also not at all impressed. Will wait and see but there are a lot of fundamental problems with the proposed business model.  1) They boast about having some 'proprietary' logistics algorithm to dynamically change pricing. All the big guys already do this in one form or another. This isn't new. Ultimately the only way to have better pricing based on logistics is to actually have better logistics than Amazon, Wall-Mart and such and that's a tall task to put it lightly.  2) They boast about having lower prices. In my own observation some of the prices are lower but others are not. Even where it's lower it seems to mostly be 'fake' (as highlighted by the Wall St Journal earlier this week) in that they just intentionally sell the stuff at a huge loss. Anyone can setup a website and just intentionally sell everything at a big loss to generate buzz. That's not a business. The only way they can actually have lower prices in the long run and not implode is to actually have better sourcing and logistics than the big guys. They've presented no real strategy for actually doing this and of course whatever they can do the big guys could likely copy and deploy even faster.  The founder's first attack at Amazon with Diapers.com made a lot more sense... it was targeted to a specific market (new parents) and battled a giant on a specific area. This new attempt at trying to beat everyone on everything seems to border on insanity, but only time will tell. They might be a nuisance to other retailers while they're essentially just giving away VC cash to consumers to fund these mostly fake low prices, but in the long run I don't see how they can survive."

startups,3dyffv,deadwavelength,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:26:51 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the ""Jet Insiders"" that got access early, and for the most part I'm not too sold on it on a number of fronts. Even with the free trials they offer, in the long run, requiring a membership to make a purchase is an annoying barrier that will be a turnoff to Amazon users and others alike.   Trying to undercut everyone and making money solely on membership fees with a business model that the founder stated won't work until it sells $20 billion a year is questionable at best.   I'm not entirely sure what problem they're trying to solve here. Their prices aren't that much lower than the competition, so if it's a price problem they're trying to solve, they're going to have to do better than that, in which case profitability will be even more difficult.   From my own research/observations, the 3 most important things to buyers are price, trust (in the marketplace itself, in the seller, that they're seeing the best matches for them personally, etc), and effort/time required to accomplish their shopping goals. I'm having a hard time seeing how Jet is a substantial improvement on any of these 3."

As far as a TOS and Privacy Policy goes, there are a lot of cookie cutter ones you can fill in your own information to online. Tax stuff is a bit harder since you will need to register an EIN, but most of it is laid out step by step if you search around.

We hit the holiday season where anyone with money is on holiday - or the lawyers are on holiday... we worked hard for 3 months and nothing happened. October, Nov, Dec - we worked just as hard and everything started to come into place. It still took longer than we imagined - we had to cover a month of staff wages with a personal loan from a parent...  there are many start ups around me all raising - my guess is, if you do it at the right time of the year - i.e. October where everyone wants it done before christmas, or 3 or 4 months before the end of the tax year when angels are after their tax breaks then it will go a lot smoother.

By all means build up your brand so it's ready but I wouldn't worry about the legalities of LLC yet until you know it's definitely going to work for you.

startups,3e0fc5,littlewyvern,2,Tue Jul 21 02:44:40 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference between an LLC and a partnership is in liability and taxes.  In a partnership your personal assets are at risk and in an LLC they are not.  In a partnership you're personally responsible for any losses or debts by the business.  You could be forced into personal bankruptcy if your partnership business does poorly.  Meanwhile, an LLC is table stakes.  An LLC is also able to raise outside financing by selling equity, a partnership generally cannot.  There's not really any strong reason to set up as a partnership over an LLC.  And if you are doing work for external clients (which you are) the legal protections of an LLC could be very important.  It only costs a few hundred dollars at most and takes maybe an hour to complete the paperwork online."

I would try adding a picture or two maybe. I would also suggest adding a description on the ""Submit Listing"" page. If I were a service provider I wouldn't have much trust submitting my info, it looks boring as well. Maybe give a brief description on how listing your services offers the opportunity to reach users easily and with no effort. The bottom dark grey portion of the site is also a little large (where the contact link is), it gives the initial impression that there may be more content below; which is not the case. I would make that portion smaller, only as much space as you need.  Other than that, I really like the color scheme and layout. I think this site has potential, but what makes it better than yelp or other service directories? Put a little more effort into assuring your site has more to offer than yelp, etc."
startups,3dz1xv,DisposableGlove,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:05 2015 UTC,"Hello!  First off, thank you for taking the time to go through the site and provide feedback.    I agree with you about it being dry, but that was the route I chose to pick. Afterall, this is a listing directory so when I look at Yelp, YellowPages, Craigslist, Kijiji etc, then I see that they dont have to be all fancy. As for adding a description to the submit listing page: I did not put anymore text or summary there since I feel like the users have read the benefits on the main page and the about page and have clicked ""Submit Lisiting"".  What distinguishes ServiceVouch from the rest is that we focus on promoting the person, the individual promoting the service, not just list business. In way, we can be looked as a lower level yelp. For example, Yelp would list the barber shops, we would be listing the barbers within the barber shop.   As a service provider, you will have your own, permanent, page where they can list details about the services you offer. This can include:   A description of the services you offer Your rates Availability Location Promotional pictures and videos Social media links, etc. Improved SEO i.e. your services will be displayed better for people searching for the services you offer in their area. Good point, I will decrease the size of the footer.   Thanks again for your feedback much appreciated :)!"
startups,3dz1xv,froglax11,2,Mon Jul 20 21:06:12 2015 UTC,"I would think some stock photos of services for ex. (barber, carpenter, landscaper) would liven it up a bit. A good way to reward your early adopters would be to have them send you a picture of them on the job/with their name or something and place that on a random appearance every time someone visits the site. I know you don't want to go fancy and you reference Yelp, YellowPages, Craigslist, but you have to offer something that they don't. The reason they don't have to be fancy is because they were the first to do what they do. They dominate the industry so making their sites more appealing wouldn't matter to their users. You have to differentiate in order to get people to stop posting on Craigslist and start posting on your site. Your differentiation has to be a great user experience."

You need 3 points of trust that a user will see within the first 7 seconds on the website.  Right now you have a clean layout with text.  Color Scheme isn't bad.  Seems to be a common one.  Your site is about finding the right worker, it took me a while to figure out what exactly you are doing here.  That will not fly with the general audience and your conversion rates will suffer.  Get a few REAL faces to your site.  Profile interesting people in businesses that you would see frequent the site (Barbers, hair dressers, sales reps, etc)  Large background picture of a sick looking barber in a hipster shop, or have a cutout friendly worker on the left in X field with something catchy ""Customers come for ME""... something that gives people an idea what it's about.  It has to be inviting.  A blurb from a user ""Finally found an experienced gardener, thanks ServiceVouce!"" - Mary North Dakota  Mobile single page scroll down sites I think will be the best for you.

startups,3dys9w,zimetone,3,Mon Jul 20 17:07:13 2015 UTC,"In a past life I worked in various roles in the music industry although for pretty small artists.  Most were on major labels or labels distributed by major labels but they maybe sold 50-100k records.  The best advice I can give is that your success in the music business is tied to your connections.  It really pays to have - and grow - a good network.    Don't do a record label unless you already have an awesome network and a shitload of money.  I've seen a ton of labels come and go, even those that had a ton of money behind them.  One thing you can try to do is be a show promoter. If you can work out good deals with venues and can reliably fill them with warm bodies that drink a lot of booze, you can make OK money. It is the kind of thing that can start small and build into something bigger over time as your reputation and personal network grow.  Keep in mind this is only a good idea if your area has a strong music scene. If you're ambitious and in an area where the markets are close together you can do pretty well.

Our startup is very small (a few people, all developers, including the CEO, except me) so I do the work that's related to online marketing.  Since every startup is different and can be at different stages (funding, profitability), it's hard to pinpoint the exact role of a business development / marketing manager. For example: What's the advertising budget? We don't have one because organic search engine traffic has worked well for our previous startup in the past.

startups,3dvp15,jascination,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:12:04 2015 UTC,"Glip is in a hot space, competitive with HipChat and Slack, so there is no shortage of interest in the product we built. In fact we had been approached by six companies in 2015 who expressed interest in acquiring our business, including some big brands you know well.  I've been pretty fortunate to have worked with mostly the same senior management team over the last twenty years and three startups. We work hard but we also recognize that we've got a pretty special thing going.  We've had a pretty good track record, making money for every one of our investors along the way, and never having a down round.  This acquisition, as is often the case, was just a matter of good timing. Part of it was the money, but a large part of the decision was the future of the product, since the company was only 2 years old and we see tremendous opportunity in the market. RingCentral not only allows us to pursue that opportunity, but to do so in a much more aggressive way.  There are pros and cons for every acquisition, so I'd be happy to dive into any other aspect you might be interested in."

For example, a few months ago a friend and I tossed around the idea of an app that monitored you and kept you safe while you were out-and-about during the night. If you didn't check in within a certain amount of time, a message would be sent to your emergency contacts with a brief notice and your current location.  We later found out that the market was saturated to hell (and I ended up signing up for the service of one of our bigger threats!), but if we'd kept the idea, I have absolutely no idea how to begin creating a SaaS product."
startups,3dvp15,vitaliyv,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:24:12 2015 UTC,"A product can only be a SaaS if it can bring immense value to a business, preferably an enterprise-type business, I think.   It's remarkable that the industry is still growing, and it shows that more and more businesses are feeling comfortable paying for something monthly if it removes some of their headaches.   If you're looking to develop a customer service software, even something as simple as an email / chat client - go for it! Even if you can't differentiate much at first, you can find your angle later. Example zopim,freshdesk all started only few years ago, they were a step above a reg. email client. Now they are billion dollar companies.  In the end, If you are solving a problem with your software, there will definitely be a customer (or two) lining up for you."

startups,3dwne8,sstugatz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:04:20 2015 UTC,"Everyone has an opinion on design. It's only when you become an expert or gain experience that it becomes worthwhile. Wireframing has a very low bar to entry so unless you can position yourself as a UX expert you're unlikely to turn this into a commercial service.   Wireframes are typically created by the product owner to save on designer costs or by the designer for rapid prototyping. Would either of those 2 be interested? For the budget minded product owner, are you an extra cost they'd gain value from? For the designer, what do you offer that they don't? It sounds to me like what you have just described is an incomplete designer.  If you fancy developing into UX, go for it. There's a lot of money being thrown into this profession and consultancy for it. And it's not all people with background in design or some sort of psychology background, it's also People With An Opinion Who Have Passed An Interview too.

startups,3durr1,marckohlbrugge,3,Mon Jul 20 05:45:13 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect.  1. We feature non-expedited submissions all the time. Currently a little over half of the startups we feature do not pay for an expedited review. In fact, whenever too many startups start paying, we increase the price to limit demand and make sure we always have 'free slots' available for those that don't have the financial means. Startups in a hurry with the budget basically finance the free startups who fairly wait their turn.   2. Paying does not guarantee getting featured. The way expedited reviews used to work is that when a founder submitted their startup and paid for the expedited review, we'd check to see if the startup qualified to get featured ( http://betalist.com/criteria ). If it did not qualify we issued a full refund and didn't feature the startup. This happened quite frequently. If we'd feature any startup willing to pay we'd quickly lose our audience because of crappy content.  As of a few weeks ago we changed the process a little bit, so that we first do a quick check to see if a startup qualifies, before the paid option is presented. That way within a few days the founder knows whether their startup qualifies (and if not, why) and there's no need for us to issue refunds for unqualified startups. (We do still offer refunds if the founder wasn't happy with the results of being featured.)  I'm sorry to hear you're still waiting to hear back. It's likely that your startup didn't meet our criteria ( http://betalist.com/criteria ). Until recently we didn't notify startups if they didn't qualify, because we weren't set up to deal with that efficiently due to our small team and increasing volume of startup submissions. As I've noted before, this has changed for new submissions. If you could email me your submission ID which you can find at http://betalist.com/dashboard I'll check your submission status.

In my experience many founders think them launching their product is newsworthy by itself, but generally it's not. It's a big deal for you, since you've worked on your startup for so long, but for a journalist is just another startup. They get a ton of pitches every day.  So how do you make sure you stand out? Try to look at it from the journalist's perspective. What's their job? How can you make it easier? How does your startup fit in?  Try to find an interesting hook. Something that can make an article about your startup interesting. Perhaps it's a funny anecdote, maybe you're playing into some bigger trends, but generally speaking just describing your product isn't very interesting.

startups,3dudcz,Plastic_lemons,13,Sun Jul 19 15:49:55 2015 UTC,"I work at a startup myself and I will tell you the few things I have learned in the year since I joined.  This are not necessarily things that happened at my startup but things you learn just being in that community.   Forget about any bonuses, even if they tell you there will be one.  Do not make your decision based off of salary + bonus. Just salary alone. Startups don't just give you stock, it vests over a period of time at which point you can buy the stock at the predetermined price.  Figure out what the vesting period of your stock is, usually you will have to wait a year for 25% of the total promised stock to vest.  It will then continue to vest every month for the next three years. Ask about 401k, health etc.  I would be surprised if they have any sort of 401k match, something you should consider.  No, a startup is not your retirement account, most startups fail and you should not put yourself in a worse off position if it does. What kind of vacation time do they offer?  If it is unlimited vacation, as some startups do, it really means, you won't have enough time to take a vacation and we won't have enough money to pay out your accrued  vacation when we fire you or you quit. Make sure the founders / CEO are not big headed but are down to earth.  Founding a startup can get to some peoples heads and make them think that they are literally God, you don't want to work with those people, it will not be a good time.  I was lucky that the CEO / founder of my company is one of the nicest people I have ever met.  I have heard horror stories from friends that work at other startups though.   One thing that is concerning is the $4M valuation with you being employee #10.  You said the company is bringing in revenue and has secured some seed funding, my guess is 400k.  It leaves me to wonder how much runway your company has left before they run out of money.  I would ask this exact question to whoever gave you the offer.  You are taking a risk and you should know how much runway is left taking into account the current cash flow, not some projected bs.  Then figure out what needs to happen before the money runs out for you guys to continue working?  Do you need to raise money, become profitable, etc.  Figure out if the company is on the right track and don't join if you don't think it will succeed because It seems like your company has less than a year of runway left.  Remember they can fire you at any point for any reason, you could be there for 11 months and all of a sudden it is not working out and you get no equity."
startups,3dudcz,iamthekris,5,Sun Jul 19 17:28:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your insight!  Let me answer each bullet point by point to give more context:   Definitely not counting on bonuses.  It's gravy on top if it materializes. Stock is a stock grant (not options) with 4 year vesting and 1 year cliff. No bennies, but I get most benefits through my wife.  I will leave a small 401k match at my former employee and handle retirement through an IRA. They've got a modest policy for PTO and I have already gotten a few requests straightened out (mainly, I'm having a baby a few weeks in and need to make sure I can have a couple of weeks off almost immediately). I got a good vibe from both co-founders.  They've got a lot of money invested here and have their hands in the day to day, extensively.   With regards to runway, I asked that exact question in my interview.  They said that with their current revenue + their money in the bank, they've got  2 years.  With their sales projections, they see profitability within 18 months.  Obviously I don't buy it word for word, but do trust that they have a path paved."

That being said ... Just do it.... Why waste you life wondering if you have the chops to kick it in a startup ... Try it and find out.  Best of luck."

But you have to be careful about undershooting on equity. If this co-founder believes he is worth more and can prove he is worth more then you will have a real mess on your hands. But if you overshoot the equity then you will have a hard time getting investment as investors will easily see a co-founder that is being greatly overvalued for the work he is providing.

Even if your goal is to be an entrepreneur, it might behoove you to gain some experience in either academia or a more established company so that you bring real, technical skill to your startups down the road.

Startups really appreciate ANY technical major, so I wouldn't be worried about the lack of formal coding knowledge. Go on to Crunchbase, angel.com, and other startup job sites (Y combinator jobs for example) and find recently funded companies. Funded companies need to grow fast and appreciate any smart people they can find. Start out maybe with a paid internship and show them that you are worthy of a full time position.

startups,3duk7k,validated1,2,Mon Jul 20 07:25:21 2015 UTC,"I work as the lead generator at a company. So I do not manage or compensate them. My job is to get the reps leads that buy. If they don't get the leads or sales they yell at me lol.   I can take a stab at what you might want to try though, having worked as the main lead generator at 2 companies. Most companies pay base salary plus commission. So they pay a base salary of a bit above minimum wage and then a significant commission on all sales (about 10% of the revenue). the managers at both places I have worked at created a competitive environment where the reps were ranked against each other. They made a very big deal every time a sale occurred so there is an immediate validation of the person for getting the sales. One place used to do a call over the PA system to the whole company congratulating the sales rep, and the other used to flip a switch that made sirens and lights go off. There were managers that coached the reps to increase the sale rate and average sales price. One strategy my previous company used was upsells. Basically, immediately after the person makes a purchase and their credit card number is already in your terminal, you make them another offer. This works pretty well.  I think that if you follow the above you will have most of your bases covered, since they seem very standard. With regards to hiring, they standard rules apply here too. Try to find people who are entrepreneurial, have previous successes, and are dependable. I have hired employees in the past for an agency I ran and no matter the strategy, only 1 out of 10 interviewees were good. So go for volume and interview tons of people. personally, I dont like the idea of creating a call center and having an office and managers, since that seems like a major time killer. I have pondered hiring remote sales reps which is not unprecedented at all, but I believe that it might be hard to create the right competitive environment virtually.  edit: can I see your site?

You can do it on your own, and probably should if you're small, but those 'messaging strategies' all quickly turn into ""do CPC ad buys to our landing page and put out press releases that no one reads or covers journalistically"" - not really a ""direction"" so much as pure per-dollar growth. One might say that that's a fine way to grow, and it is, but I'd point out that really successful things like Uber or AirBnB didn't get started by buying Google Ads paying per click - they pushed a message."

I suppose I'd have to understand what they mean by ""basic PR.""  Is it just writing all your materials?  or are they going to be doing some press strategy and press outreach as well?  if generating press attention is important to your startup - does this agency have a good track record of getting press results for its clients?  i'll also add that most agencies worth their salt in the tech space are charging minimum 8-10k a month.  Maybe some of the newer, very small agencies are charging a bit less.  As a consultant I charge about 5k a month.  So the notion that an agency, a team, is going to come in and do good PR for you for under 1K a month seems pretty outlandish to me.  again, just my opinion here, so take it as you will.  that all said, if the agency just acts as ""advisory"" and helps guide you on what to do but doesn't do the actual work, then I suppose i could see that being really low cost.  as for managing stuff on your own - there's nothing wrong with trying to learn and do PR / marketing yourselves.  it will just require that you invest the time and hours to do so - and be open to making mistakes and understanding it's a learning process.  a lot of startups do their early pr / marketing on their own until  they can afford the spend required to bring on an external partner."

startups,3drosg,kxw3656,6,Sat Jul 18 20:24:38 2015 UTC,"1) Strategy? I honestly don't have enough marketing knowledge to have a strategy. I guess my strategy is finding communities (such as reddit) that might be interested in content on my website, and posting. I've tried Twitter, Facebook, G+ with no success at all. I don't know enough to know if it needs improvement. My target demographic is vaguely, ""people who want help making a decision"", which comes down to everybody at some point or another.  2) I didn't even consider marketing until the website was launched.  3) I don't have much of a ""brand"" at all. A friend is making a simple logo for me, and the website is the business.  4) I've found the most success with reddit. A couple of my posts have made it to the front of large subreddits, and most of my traffic comes from that. I've made a total of about 60 posts on Facebook, Twitter, and G+, and nothing at all came of them. I do get traffic from Facebook, but that's from other people sharing my content.  5) Website is designed to scale automatically from the start.  Other notes:  I've had a lot of trouble finding resources on HOW to market. Most of what I find assumes you're trying to sell something. My website is free, and most of it doesn't even require an account. I want to learn how to attract people to the site, not how to convince them to buy something.  Furthermore, most resources don't give enough details. I see advice like: ""Post on Twitter, and don't forget to use proper hashtags"". Ok, what do I post? What are ""proper hashtags""? Should I just post on my page, or should I focus on replying to other posts and posting @ people?  The website I'm mentioning, for reference."

However, when apps like this launch there are very few users and very little content. This leads me to believe that the first users will be bored since there is not much on the app and stop using it.  Obviously, the app can pre-populate content but if they want to remain honest they don't want to create fake profiles/content etc...   The only solution I have thought of is in beta testing before release to get people who know they are early adopters to join up and be patient while the app builds.

startups,3drhpl,tibb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:47:15 2015 UTC,The ones that puts the project together and keep it in motion are founders.  Sometimes that's the money guy who approaches others.

startups,3drhpl,Ambiguous_About_It,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:56:56 2015 UTC,"Eh, you're one of two project managers, so you aren't even developing the app yourself...and you're collecting a salary below market rate with the understanding that your equity share will one day make up that difference + something.  And you should, but that's not going to be what you think it's going to be.  There is no way, for example, this split should be 50/25/25 based upon what you have written here.  If I was the founding member who put up the cash to not only pay you but also pay for the cost of development I'd want at least 70% of the company, and I'd deserve it.  No, no bonus when investment is sealed, though you may see an increase in salary.    You haven't really given detailed enough information to take it much further than that.  I'd shoot for 15% if I were you...maybe 20 if your financier is super cool, or a bit naive.  I'd expect something like 5-10% as it all shakes out."

You should get this settled ASAP, it will be a lot messier when millions of dollars are being thrown around.  If I had to guess, you deserve ~50% and will be offered ~5%  Sometimes founders will take some money off the table during a funding round, it's part of the negotiation with the investor if it's something you want.  If you've been getting paid a lot below your market rate for a while, it's a reasonable thing.  A good investor won't want a founder who is worried about making rent, or worried about money at all, but they also want founders who are hungry, not resting on their laurels after getting funding."

If your business really starts to take off they will literally resent you. So first your billing will begin to edge up but then they will start making suggestions about your getting board members such as one of their senior partners. Remember that lawyers live in a world where networking is king and can't understand that other businesses can have success without it.  So once you have some success and smell your billing creeping up get something minor done by another law firm but make sure that they see it. This will be a huge wake up call reminding them that you know that lawyers are a commodity.  Also I suspect that when you get the other lawfirm to do something small they will kill themselves trying to get all the business. At this point begin leapfrogging your lawyers about every 2 years unless you hit one you love.  The moment you think that you are dependant on your lawyers then you must realize that they have completely snow jobbed you.  Lawyers are little different than the guy who changes the tires on your car. If you don't change the tires on your car when you should then really bad things can happen.

Having your landing page a large signup is like asking a tinder date for another date before the first one starts.  Use the landing page to either explain what your site does, and why I want it, or if you think its pretty self explanatory (I believe it is) then feature some events to promote exploration for ourselves.  As you dont want to leave things to chance, I would somehow make the user filter the events by either event type or location before they browse to get a better first impression.

startups,3doe0w,nogo09,61,Fri Jul 17 22:40:39 2015 UTC,"So, it means on-demand startups will (hopefully) be doing what they already should have been doing: paying serious attention to where and how they make their margin.  Homejoy's implicit assumption was that if they could get to scale, they could find cost efficiency to compensate for their low gross margin. This is a hand-wavey assumption that ignored where they made their margin, which is on the backs of low-pay contractors. This meant the contractors --> (1) weren't generally the best worker performing that type of service out in the market and (2) were incentivized to work with the clients directly after being connected through Homejoy to cut them out of the deal.  If Homejoy could find the right price that still made small gross margin, it could have worked, so long as that gross margin didn't lead to low quality workers --> you'd need to be giving the $ they could make working without you or be providing them some hyper efficiency through your business. Uber, for example, provides drivers immediate clients + secure payment.  What markers should on-demand startups be paying attention to?  Where you make your money. You should be paying your service providing workers a wage that makes them interested and providing them an amount of business (or other efficiency) that keeps them interested. Make your margin outside of wages and on something systematic, like customer retention, superior trust/payment mechanisms, or efficiency through logistics.  Frequency & nature of transaction. A Homejoy worker cleans your place every x weeks, so is willing to give you their contact information and say ""let's work outside the system"" and establish a relationship. You need Uber more frequently and on-demand, so the app isn't just healing the ""intro"" & referral wound [service provider <> client] but is also providing it at pace.  The ticket price. If you can make a larger amount of dollars per transaction, you can spend a lot more acquiring transactions and improving transaction retention. Airbnb provides a trust mechanism that's extremely valuable for their buyers & sellers, and so their buyers & sellers are ultimately willing to keep Airbnb's higher margin in their lives. Airbnb can use this margin to improve their marketplace and eventually for profit.  TL;DR: If your business model is a UI on top of connecting ""gig workers"" to the upper middle class, you're going to fail. You need an additional logistical or service advantage that allows you to make high margin infrequently or low margin frequently."
startups,3doe0w,inevitableidea,6,Sat Jul 18 01:03:05 2015 UTC,"Yup, this. This is why pure software plays are so popular. The margins are HUGE and they scale so beautifully. It's a shame to see Homejoy go, but that is just the nature of the beast."
startups,3doe0w,dtft,7,Sat Jul 18 02:57:33 2015 UTC,"I was talking to my sister and called out Homejoy failing because of what you cited: their workers will just work outside the system.   How do I know?  I found my house keeper on Homejoy and now I pay her directly. She even still uses their little bag.   That said, I think there was a business here Homejoy didn't pursue. They could have had the cleaners pay them for leads.  I for one think there is a barrier to finding a cleaner for millennial a because it's not cool enough.  Most housekeeping outfits that are locals are absolute shite. Homejoy was filling that spot and I think another company should."

startups,3doe0w,wahdeh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:41:32 2015 UTC,Yea but not really. They have the same revenue mechanism but their marketing is towards all projects. One of homejoys strengths was its marketing house cleaning to gen y.
startups,3doe0w,rdudejr,5,Sat Jul 18 19:01:00 2015 UTC,"Cool post, but this doesn't address the real question at all. Sources say it's in light of lawsuits on the subject of employee versus contractor designation/treatment. What does this mean for the other Uber-like startups?"
startups,3doe0w,xPerplex,14,Sat Jul 18 02:29:51 2015 UTC,"Sure. It's not because of the lawsuits. If Homejoy's unit economics were working, they would have been able to raise the money necessary to deal with legal battles. VCs would be more than willing to put capital to work to get them through those tough times.  A lot of people are citing the Uber ruling that just came through, but that was a ruling about a single driver and is otherwise non-binding. It's an interesting case because, if expanded, it has implications for Uber & everyone else. But it doesn't change the fundamentals here, and neither do any of these legal battles [YET -- if a new worker classification ever comes through, things will change].  Whether they use and can justify using contractors or fully employ their service providers, Uber-like startups need to be paying attention to the markers I mentioned above. In some cases, that means a business won't be viable due to cost of workforce. In other cases, they'll still be fine using employees instead of contractors (a lot of startups are successfully making the switch).  [Edit: Just to expand on this a bit, keep in mind what's happening with these lawsuits. Courts and regulators aren't saying contractors as a worker class should be eliminated. They're dealing with startups who are stretching the boundaries of what it means to be a contractor. So, as long as your business actually deals with contractors (like Thumbtack) and isn't creating pseudo-contractors [called ""gig workers""], you'll be fine.]"
startups,3doe0w,inevitableidea,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:39:42 2015 UTC,"If Homejoy's unit economics were working, they would have been able to raise the money necessary to deal with legal battles.   In theory yes, but raising VC is not always this simple. Often conflicts, lack of expertise, assumptions that the space has one winner, render some VCs unappraochable."
startups,3doe0w,wahdeh,6,Sat Jul 18 07:46:49 2015 UTC,"That's true of the VC space generally, yes. However, Homejoy is a YC startup with a speaker circuit founder and some of the best investors in the world already on the cap table. If Homejoy's problem was not core to their business, they could have easily raised money from existing investors or found dollars elsewhere. So, it must be the case that the business was failing."

startups,3doe0w,dtft,2,Sat Jul 18 02:58:57 2015 UTC,"The key here is that they incentivized their workers to connect with people outside the app. You can't do that with Uber.

startups,3doe0w,amosschorr,2,Sat Jul 18 04:41:53 2015 UTC,What would you suggest being the additional logistical or service advantage for a company like homejoy?
startups,3doe0w,testmypatience,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:53:30 2015 UTC,"Home cleaning is tough because it's hard to price. Thus far, startups have tried to price down the service so they can sell it to millennials who wouldn't be traditional buyers of home cleaning. The problem being you need actual professionals who know how to clean -- now, you can't price appropriately without subsidizing with VC money. There's no real urgency to home cleaning, so logistical advantages are hard to see.  Two ways it could go:  1: Homejoy could've become more like a marketplace, which sells a large amount of leads to a large amount of independent contractors [rather than trying to brand, hire for, & price the services themselves]. However, this is a smaller per-transaction business, so you'd need to move out of just home cleaning to make it a large tech company (which Thumbtack is already doing).  2: Find added services that set them apart from agency or independent cleaners. Then, charge their users on a subscription basis for that ""experience."" So, you'd package things related to home cleaning and charge a set fee that gives you margin over the cost of services. This is what Alfred is already doing."
startups,3doe0w,inevitableidea,2,Sat Jul 18 21:42:35 2015 UTC,"Love your comments so far.  The big issues I saw were that cleaning professionals wanted:   Find a way to find customers quickly Organize the appointments and get the payment securely Have a way to have repeat customers Get work even if it isn't for a local company that you already don't like   So finding the leads is a big part that is done. The issue of making sure the contractor didn't pick up the contact as their own and cut out the company with the website and organization system.  At this point you can already just use a lead generation pricing for people who want to use it to get leads. Now if they want to use the platform as Homejoy intended, then you could make it so that the system recognizes that it is being used for repeat orders and will just charge for that usage. The initial lead will cost X but the follow up orders would not cost so much since the initial lead is hard to get and now you would just be charging for the organizational tool. This way the company could still do well in either situation and both situations would be treated appropriately. Basically you are taking two companies and merging them into one so that you are taking care of the services that two separate business would take care of. This way you can swing from one direction to another."
startups,3doe0w,testmypatience,2,Sat Jul 18 22:51:40 2015 UTC,"Great post.  Another way to think of your point about homejoy's workers being incentivized to work directly with clients (in the context of uber vs homejoy): uber is a business with a strong network effect, i.e., in order for customers to be satisfied, there need to be a ton of drivers on the road and available pretty much at all times. In contrast for homejoy, customers just need a single worker to stop by at a prescheduled time -- no network is really required on an ongoing basis, so it's much easier to cut homejoy out of the equation."

startups,3doe0w,Techynot,3,Sat Jul 18 08:20:50 2015 UTC,Got any links about the profit statement?  The only reason I would think Airbnb isn't making a profit is because they are focused on putting all their revenue into funding growth.

startups,3doe0w,frankcrest,4,Sat Jul 18 13:58:58 2015 UTC,No way.  First off take what the previous poster said with a grain of salt they take third review system very seriously.  Second as a host I set my own prices so I'm not really an independent contractor like uber or homejoy.  Airbnb is more of a marketing platform for short term rentals that you pay a fee on for each reservation.
startups,3doe0w,therealrico,22,Sat Jul 18 15:58:13 2015 UTC,"Having used homejoy, I felt it was a disaster. Cleaners almost always did a horrible job. One left dirty sheets on the bed and put clean sheets on top. Many no showed without any warning at all (even after the appointment time came and went).  Others left early and billed for extra hours (doorman and security camera told me this). I kept trying them for a while because they were one of the only ways to deal with my changing schedule (most cleaners want a regularly scheduled visit).  Uber is a better experience than taxis. I get picked up, driven safely and without complaints about my destination.  There's little to infer about ""uber like"" startups here."
startups,3doe0w,travis-42,3,Sat Jul 18 02:18:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, because basically anyone is a professional driver, or could pretend to be one. More skilled trades like cleaning, not so much."
startups,3doe0w,Its_free_and_fun,3,Sat Jul 18 03:15:30 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but my multiple experiences with Homejoy had pretty extreme levels of incompetence. I'm pretty sure the person who thought you should put clean sheets (and pillow cases) over dirty ones was just high.  Homejoy even sent one cleaner 3 different times to our apartment and that same cleaner no-showed each time. I didn't even always get notice -- I sometimes had to contact Homejoy to get a refund when I came home 8 hours later and it was clear nobody had showed up. I couldn't exclude the cleaner from cleaning our home in the Homejoy system because the cleaner had never yet actually cleaned it.  For Homejoy in particular, I think there was even more going on than just ""cleaning is actually kind of hard."" I'd be hesitant to even extrapolate from Homeboy's failure to cleaning on demand services in general, let alone other ""Uber-like"" services."
startups,3doe0w,travis-42,2,Sat Jul 18 17:05:58 2015 UTC,Sounds like they had no quality control at all.  Uber is crazy about reviews and I think it's crucial to their business model.

They forget that services like these aren't like software. Facebook could turn on the cash stream after reaching scale. It didn't have physical assets to take care of (besides servers - which are a lot easier to manage, legally and operationally, than people).

Governments lose tax revenue on the 1099 economy so plenty of incentive at all levels to prefer on-demand workers be classified as W-2 employees. Factor this into your margins rather than bank on a century of labor rights being tossed out the window because VCs would like it so.
startups,3doe0w,mercurious,5,Sat Jul 18 03:27:02 2015 UTC,Why do governments lose tax revenue in a 1099 economy? Taxes should be fairly similar either way.
startups,3doe0w,Pzychotix,3,Sat Jul 18 04:14:35 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong here, but one possible explanation --  1099s shift the tax burden to the ""contractor"" from the would-be employer.  But, contract workers are issued 1099s i.f.f. they make more than $600/year.  If their total annual pay is less than $600, then no form is issued and the employee...er, independent contractor, possibly won't report to the IRS (although they're supposed to)."

First, there was absolutely no training for contractors. Basically they hired everyone that came to the half hr trial we had even though most of them had never cleaned before. After that we all got sent alone to brand new customers, as their first experience. I bet a lot of my customers got a terrible impression of me and of homejoy.   They would have never attracted successful long term cleaners, because a good cleaner easily makes 20$ an hr and has a great reoccuring client base. And Homejoy goes up to 15$ hr and starts at 13$.  Second, I noticed at least in the Austin market, the lionshare of customers were groupon customers who wouldn't have bought the service unless it was a groupon deal. They usually are just groupon customers, they very seldom convert. Here is more about that.  Third, letting customers self price was a terrible idea. Sure a bedroom might take 1 hr to clean, but what if it hadnt been dusted in a year? What if (as one of my assignments) the bedroom had a bird loose in it that had absolutely crusted the place in months worth of bird droppings? An experienced maid would be able to adjust the quote accordingly, but Homejoy never really gave us that freedom, we had to take the assignment and 'satisfy the customer' no matter what.   Lastly, cleaning isn't an a la carte service, it needs to be reoccuring. You have to work with a cleaner several times for them to understand your tastes, priorities and preferences. Additionally, cleaning isn't a one time fix, its a matter of upkeep. Homejoy didn't really go into it with that mind set. Instead it rarely ever matched people up with cleaners they liked. Additionally there was no incentive for a customer to set up that reoccuring schedule either.   edit a word."

There are far more appartments in my area than are listed and that is a bit frustrating. I would like to see a comprehensive listing of information with nice breakdowns to work with.   I want a robust system that allows me to live life without a bunch of stupid hoops to jump through.  Oh, you want to find an appartment?

It can be done, but unless you're going to focus on one area (eg. housing for rent/sale) it'll be nearly impossible without a ton of investment.  If you wanted my armchair advice I'd pick one specific industry and hit that hard. To follow through on the property one you could focus on your home state and get an aggregator site together for all the housing available for rent or purchase and get a great, simple, easy to use search function. From there you could charge realtors / landlords for priority listings. www.daft.ie is the biggest one in my country and their search is great and they've cornered the market almost."

startups,3do8xg,brainhash,4,Sat Jul 18 05:32:02 2015 UTC,"Employers will buy tokens in order to list work to be completed. Initially the token purchase will be done with Bitcoin, but 3rd party services might crop up to accept other forms of payment to buy the tokens.   Once they put the tokens in their account and create the job that they want completed, a worker can do the work and the token is assigned to them pending verification of the quality of the work   The employer will have 24 to 48 hours to verify the quality of the work before the payment is released. If they don't think the work deserves payment, it'll be assigned to another worker that'll do the arbitration. The worker could also acquire their earnings more quickly by requesting an arbitrator in advance who will take a portion of the value of the work in exchange for verifying the quality.   In essence, I'll be using workers on the microwork platform itself to do quality control if the employer won't do it themselves.   Once the funds are unlocked, the user can buy goods at a participating merchant using their tokens with just one or two clicks. The tokens will be sold automatically to a cryptoasset exchange and converted to BTC, which will be sent to the merchant.   If they wish to buy something from a merchant that isn't participating, but they do accept Bitcoin, they'll be able to do a manual transaction by entering the BTC required and the deposit address and we'll sell the right number of tokens and perform the transaction for them.   In essence, they're earning Bitcoin but we want to hide the complexity of Bitcoin from the user whenever possible.   An example using entirely made up numbers:   Padman in New Delhi wants to pay for a VPN that costs $6 USD a month from a US provider so he can watch Netflix. He signs into his LegionWork account and spends an hour doing things like data normalization or sending emails or researching information. He's earned 60 minutes of credit, pending verification of the quality of his work. A few hours later 45 minutes of the work has been verified but the employers were so impressed they tipped him a combined additional 20 minutes.   He then goes to the VPN service website to pay his monthly membership fee. The payment checkout system determines that $6 USD is currently worth 46 minutes worth of tokens and deducts it from his account.   The LegionWork site hits the VPN providers callback URL to inform them that the payment was complete and his account is funded for another month. At the same time, the LegionWork service sells 46 minutes of tokens at a cryptoasset exchange for BTC and receives 0.0215 BTC ($6 USD worth of Bitcoin) and sends that to the VPN providers Bitcoin address.   Padman managed to pay for his VPN service in Bitcoin without even having to know what Bitcoin is or how to use it. The VPN service can sell their Bitcoin on Coinbase or somewhere else (or just keep it in Bitcoin to pay for stuff).   Everyone's happy!  No need for escrow as it's built in, fraud detection is built-in... acquiring workers won't be a big problem since there are always people looking to make money online.

I can put up microwork jobs for people to log into mturk and try to find out who is posting work that they want done and then to contact them to tell them about the LegionWork platform.   Not enough participating merchants? I can create jobs and may pay workers to contact VPN and VPS providers or adult sites or message forums with memberships.   Not enough workers?

Thats challenge with mturk too you are restricted to what purchase you can make. Anyways no better option than enabling semi closed wallet. Keep in mind you need good set of vendors on board for wallet purchase.  Bitcoin use is little questionable due to lack of chargebacks. But may be for micro payments no one cares enough.  But overall you should consider motivation of workers. Is it just to pay bills or buy something nice. I think i would go for it to buy something i usually woudnt. And plan accordingly.  I also thought this could work best on mobile too. People can spare free time in making quick bucks.

The lack of chargebacks is actually a strength for some merchants that normally have to suffer from high rates of CC or PayPal fraud.   The way I'm building it, if the merchant accepts Bitcoin the worker will be able to pay for the product or service. Merchants that sign up to use the LegionWork payment platform will be able to provide an easier checkout process.    If the person has access to a banking infrastructure and a way to sell Bitcoin, they can always cash out to their wallet and sell the Bitcoin for real currency in their bank account. I just don't want to be part of that last step because it entails all the difficulties with compliance, regulations, and working with banks.   As for mobile, I agree that it should be a focus. In fact, I want to target two main demographics.   People living in developing countries or in areas with high unemployment who want to do this all day long to earn a living. Hopefully the platform can provide enough work to earn a living wage.   People who want to casually make some ""fun money"" working maybe 30 minutes a day while they're on break at work or stuck on the bus or during commercials."

I was planning on going after niche cases first and dominating them and then moving onto more general microwork categories.   Using MTurk is the standard practice with businesses and universities. I'm not sure of the best way to compete with that. All I can think of to compete with at first is by targeting the smaller microwork employers, which are sometimes sketchy.   Suggestions?"
startups,3do8xg,amosschorr,2,Sat Jul 18 02:52:35 2015 UTC,At least allow workers to rate requesters (like TurkOpticon) but allow them to also rank how ethical they think a particular requester's tasks are.   That way workers that want to avoid doing tasks that are sketchy can easily do so.

Are you telling me that moving to Puerto Rico reduces US income taxes more than leaving the country? That's pretty messed up.  Anyway, I LOVE the concept. It has near-limitless utility. My friend has been doing something similar with cryptocurrency microtransactions, but he focused on social media influencing. Facebook likes, retweets, youtube views, etc.  But my question to you is are you holding onto any bitcoin? When people exchange coins for tokens, are you immediately converting it to more stable currency? Because even with the Grecian crisis presenting an obvious need for it, bitcoin is still very volatile. So if someone buys tokens from you and you hold onto the coins, and they plummet in value, you're losing a good amount of money when users redeem their tokens.  EDIT: are you planning on phasing in higher-ticket items once you're able to gain traction, develop trust, and provide a feedback system? Is there any long-term notion of underwriting deals to ensure workers don't get screwed over? And what DOES happen if the worker gets screwed over?"

It's the best of both worlds.   At the moment, the plan is to create a cryptotoken (probably CounterParty, but maybe NXT or whatever token is the most awesome in about 2 months when I get to that part). The token will represent a second of work. Then I'll convince some exchanges to list the token for trading and the market will decide what the wage level will be at.   Employers can choose to pay for more time than the job will require in order to attract workers.  In general, time IS the currency.    I won't be holding onto any bitcoin. Employers will purchase the time tokens from an exchange or third parties to fund their account and then assign the time tokens to tasks that they are listing. Workers will perform the tasks and add time to their bank. When they wish to spend it, it'll get the current exchange rate of time tokens to BTC to determine how much time is required to pay for the invoice.   I won't actually be listing things for sale on the site. That portion is not a market place, it's a payment platform like Paypal. If a merchant participates, they can have a ""Pay by working"" checkout button to make things easy. If they don't participate but they do accept Bitcoin, the user can go to check out and get the BTC amount and deposit address and then go to their LegionWork account and issue a withdrawal request and enter that information.

My guesses are that the folks either leave due to insufficient inventory or lack of trust. Validate the case with your users then run some experiments to close that gap.  If it's inventory I like the previous suggestion to go niche. Eg yard tools as a niche (recall that Amazon started with books only).   Also have you modelled the financials. $10 to drive a product around a city seems awfully cheap (how much does an average cab ride cost in Atlanta). Can you still be profitable with a 10% return rate?

startups,3dr4nb,zohotis,2,Sat Jul 18 17:31:14 2015 UTC,"I dont have any factual evidence, but my intuition is that   1) great short domain name may affect your CTR from google search results (i.e. if you and you competitor sit at positions 6 and 7, users might click on the one with better domain name - it implies more trust).   2) anywhere it mentioned or advertised, the great short to-the-point name of your product would imply more trust and would work in your favor during those first 7 seconds while you still have their attention. They dont know nothing yet but the product name so they unconsciously judge you buy your product name. Pick something stupid and they will judge you on that, without even reaching to your website. This works literally anywhere your product is advertised or mentioned. Anywhere.  All being equal, the great name wins you better first impression in first 7 seconds while you still have your customers attention. Of course, that is just the beginning of your customers ""funnel"", but without them making their first click to the top of your ""funnel"", nothing would come out at the bottom.  With that said, I think the most important factor to technology business success is by far NOT the name but the ""Network Promoter Score"" or call it ""Word Of Mouth"" or ""Organic Growth Rate"". Once you have reached some positive dynamics here, also known as ""Product Market Fit"", you would have a sustainable model that might just need an initial push of ""paid ads"" to start breathing some life and gaining some sort of traction.  And great product / domain name also serves as a small but tangible factor here."

There are a few ways you can go with it, firstly names can be direct and to the point (ex - BLUECHAIR.COM if you sell blue chairs, or similar synonyms, internet explorer). Another way you can go with it, is something that explains what your product is, but not directly. A more abstract description of your product (ex - Facebook, its roughly a book of faces. The version of it which would be direct, like above would be something like socialnetwork.com) A third alternative could be something completely unrelated, but catchy (ex - Firefox is the prime example)  Something else which you might have to consider is SEO. Find out how people search for the  product/service you are selling (if you are an internet based company) and name it accordingly.  Hope this helps!"

startups,3drevz,dtft,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:18:59 2015 UTC,"Ideas aren't important.  Let me try and illustrate this. Years ago, I worked for a social startup. The core 'idea' of the app is something I'm sure you've heard before: people should be able to take photos with their phones and upload them so their friends can see them.  That 'core' idea could easily be describing Instagram, Flickr, Facebook, et cetera... except that this was in 2004-5. No iPhones, no 'real' browsers on mobile devices, et cetera. We're talking WAP uploading photos from your candy bar Nokia.  Conceptually, the idea was great. The execution was top notch for the time. It had a reasonable user base (lower 5 figures as I recall). Had the site pushed through the awkward years where the technology really wasn't there to support the idea, the site might have been worth a significant amount of money. But the idea didn't seem good enough at the time and everybody moved on.  Imagine the flip side of this. Imagine you're back in 2010. Facebook has long been in full swing, open to the public mode. It's been years since Flickr was picked up by Yahoo. Social photo sharing powered by smart phones exists everywhere. I'm talking simple editing workflows, organization and grouping, sharing with your friends, long term storage of originals, et cetera.  Would you really want to start another site where the premise was taking photos on your smart phone, doing simple organization/editing and sharing them with your friends? Seems pretty done to death. Yet a different take with fewer features than many of the existing sites started in 2010, gained 100,000,000 users in a couple of years, and sold for $1,000,000,000.  Creating an application that takes off is as much about doing it at the right time, in the right market, with the right subtle differences as it is about the overall concept. You can influence what ideas you choose to run with by doing market research, but you're not going to discover that 140 character limited, asides-style blog posts are the next big thing by looking at demand. You need to pick something that you can be passionate about and just go apeshit on it.  It doesn't matter if it's completely original. As long as it has appeal to a decent sized audience, you should run with it.  I've been doing this professionally for over 15 years. I've worked for a lot of startups that had brilliant ideas that folded over things both within and outside of the company's control. I wasted a lot of time making things for other people because I was waiting for that billion dollar, totally original idea to just pop into my head.  Mine isn't coming, and neither is yours, so I strongly advise you take that to heart and do what I'm doing: make something you care about. Hell, make everything you care about. But stop worrying about the idea and put yourself out there."

Whoever reaches the goal first wins the pot.  For example:  Just use Android or iPhone GPS. You can make it an all cardio workout. Whoever reaches 10 miles within 2 days?   Maybe you can register to compete for prizes that companies can offer you to advertise for them.   For example:  Run 10 miles by Thursday, watch this video, and be entered in to win tickets to some local event.  I literally just came up with this as I was typing it. Not sure if it's a great idea, but just get in a room with people and brainstorm what hasn't been done yet or what you can do to improve a product."

I've also imported user emails from a different source to help manage a beta community, VIP community etc. Outbound emails can be targeted to sub-population and pull in dynamic fields, for example I used a custom field to send out a unique coupon code to each person on a list. It tracks open, reply, and click through rates.  There are some more direct communication channels that it enables for you but right now we're only using email."

startups,3dnd55,oohcharlie,4,Fri Jul 17 18:59:22 2015 UTC,"I've have had the privilege of rubbing shoulders with a variety of successful entrepreneurs. To list a few:   My father has been in business 36 years.  A close friend that stays out of the public so shall remain nameless, that built some of the first cell phone towers when the big carriers were paying crazy amounts to rent space. Sold his company for $25 million. Doug Greene, inventor of the fireplace remote. Mark Mullins, serial entrepreneur and was an EVP of Zoom Systems where they pitched to Steve Jobs putting Apple products in vending machines around the world. Glenn Campbell, founder of Hat World, Inc., now LIDS. Another close friend that stays out of the public, that sold a company for $400k at 19 years old, ended up starting 12 successful companies, the best selling for $30+ million.   There are others - some on a smaller scale and some on the same playing field. Being an entrepreneur myself, I am like a sponge to these guys and try to pick out the qualities that have made them so successful. I think we all are always looking for that successful trait, talent, skill that will get us to the next level. But you know what's funny/interesting that I've learned? There is no such thing. If one successful entrepreneur swears by a talent getting them there, another one tells you the exact opposite. Other than the obvious traits like work ethic and persistence, there are two things I have noticed is a common denominator:  1.) They knew what they were good at, who they were, and what they liked and they focused on those things. Instead of working on their weaknesses, they were masters at attracting talent to make up for what was not their skill.  2.) Luck. This is my biggest disagreement with Peter Thiel's section about luck not being real in Zero to One. Every single one of the guys mentioned above have unique stories about luck playing into their stories and success. Yes, they worked to get there but they also had something completely out of their control give them a little nudge forward.  EDIT: A word."

startups,3dnd55,myprivatetemp,3,Fri Jul 17 18:20:05 2015 UTC,"People need to like you. That's the most important one. As an entrepreneur, you need to be able to cultivate social currency wherever you can, because you won't have the resources to buy it.   Hard work is obviously important, but it's not nearly as crucial. You can manage output without hard work (unlikely, but possible), but you can't manage output if nobody wants to help you.  Relationship development is the most useful thing you can spend your time on. That's how you get advisors, that's how you get people to give you free consultations, introductions, and referrals. That's how you get people to help you for free, which is necessary when you're trying to be lean.  Grit? Being a problem solver? Good qualities to have. But if you can surround yourself with the right people, they become a lot less necessary.  If people don't WANT to help you, you need every quality an entrepreneur can have. But if people like you and want you to succeed, they can compensate for what you lack.  edit: obviously people won't be as helpful if you're just a likable moron. This concept extends beyond that, because I'm referring to the kind of like that makes people BELIEVE in you. It's not just charisma, it's not just charm, it's not just likability. It's a kind of human vulnerability, honesty, and candor that draws people in when combined with intelligence. It's somewhat ineffable, but it works."

When you spoke to the last party holders in your TM you found that they there searching for a solution?   And how much forward planning goes into this? Can you ship in the time between party idea and party date?"

startups,3doo0u,cephalopod1,3,Sun Jul 19 00:44:23 2015 UTC,"Let me say, as a college student who does his share of partying, I can never ever see people wanting this service. You say that the problem you are solving is that parties ""require way too much planning"". Even if that is the case (which I don't think it is) that isn't even the problem your service solves. All you do is provide supplies for the party. And what is worse is that the supplies that you offer can ALL be purchased at the same location, likely for cheaper than you offer (minus maybe the t-shirts) with no shipping required. What is stopping somebody from going to your website, looking at what you offer and then just driving to the store and purchasing all of the items (and saving money doing it)? After all they still need to go to the store to buy beer. I'm sorry if this comment comes off as too harsh but I think there are some serious flaws with your business plan that you MUST address if you want to aquire customers.  My personal recommendation, and I know it may be hard to hear, is to take what you have learned and come up with a new business idea. Don't view the time that you have spent on this company as having been wasted time. Not every successful entrepreneur succeeded with their first business. Best of luck!"

If you present yourself this way, they'll want to help you. They probably do what they do because they enjoy it, and they enjoy working with people who make their jobs pleasant. I doubt they'll give you any trouble, so be nice and they'll be nice back. Present yourself as a collaborative sort, make this a team effort, and everything will be okay.

Instead of focusing on what you don't like start off by saying how great XYZ are then say you have a few notes. Camera stabilization is readily available with even the most entry level software. I would ask them to stabilize the shots. If they can't do it someone on fiverr or elance can easily do it for next to nothing.  Overall is the flow of the story well thought out? Is the video over 2 minutes long? If so, I would advise you to bring it under the 2 minute threshold.  How are the titles/graphics they're using? Are they on screen long enough? Do the colors fit with your branding?  I would need to see the video to give more detailed thoughts on easy ways to make the video more appealing.   Side note - Did they sign a copyright agreement transfer or a work for hire agreement? If not, I would probably do this ASAP. Technically they still own the copyright on all of the material if nothing was signed."

You can absolutely have a bunch of DBAs under a single LLC (this is a fact, not just my opinion). An LLC operating agreement can (and should, from the operator's perspective) be as vague as ""this LLC exists to perform all activities legal within the state of blablabla,"" and so if you did that, you can have all kinds of unrelated business activities under that umbrella.  As for the rest, I don't know whether it makes sense for you to do it. My understanding is that these activities can be named differently, but are technically all under the same LLC umbrella. Which means they're operating under the same liability. If one of your businesses, for example, has a storefront and someone slips and falls in front of it and you're liable, all of the assets for everything under the LLC are liable.  Everything is effectively just a subdivision of your LLC, so it doesn't matter where the IP is claimed, and it doesn't matter what bank accounts you have."

At best, you might be able to sue the customer afterwards to reclaim the tax and penalties from them.   I went to a short seminar on new EU VAT rules earlier this year. The accountant recommended collecting and saving at least 2-3 matching pieces of evidence about the customer's location: IP, billing address, browser language, self-reported location, etc. If some EU country disputes your VAT payments and asks for more tax, you can use this evidence to show them that the customer was not resident in their country."
startups,3do032,lehmakook,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:15:42 2015 UTC,"Yea I totally get that. But how on earth are you supposed to get 2-3 matching pieces of evidence when there is only so much you can collect for digital products?   IP address - OK this will most likely be good unless they're using a VPN Billing address - none required for digital products (paypal or stripe). Even if you ask for one, they can just give another country Ask customer to confirm location - customer can lie again   The entire system relies totally on your customers being honest with you, and if they're not, you could get completely screwed?"
startups,3do032,amosschorr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:41:45 2015 UTC,"No idea. EU really went full retard with these regulations. It was designed to get Amazon, Apple and Google to stop billing VAT through Luxembourg, despite all the hassle and extra work it creates for all small online businesses.   Back in March or so when the seminar happened, there were no court judgements on these questions, so nobody really knows how the rules will be enforced in practice. Maybe it's changed since then, not sure.   The accountant basically said:   In theory, any EU country's tax office could demand VAT from you for customers who actually live there.  If you are small enough, nobody will probably care to check the records.  If you have 2-3 pieces of location evidence, and they all match, this should be sufficient to argue that you billed it correctly.  If you don't, or if this evidence is conflicting, it's up to you to decide whether to risk paying VAT again to another country if audited, or whether to refuse to serve the customer at all."

Are there new rules that have changed the VAT game?"
startups,3do032,Hallucinaut,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:26:51 2015 UTC,"VAT is a consumption tax, but sellers are usually responsible for collecting and paying it to the government, at least for within-country sales. It was a bit more confusing when the buyer is itself a VAT-registered company, or if the sale crosses EU country borders.  Selling digital goods used to be taxed as a sale where the seller is registered. So the online shop would register in one EU country, add and collect that country's VAT, and pay it to that country's tax office. Big online shops chose Luxembourg for its low VAT, and other countries were upset at losing the VAT from sales to their residents.  But starting from 1st January 2015, sellers of digital goods are responsible for accounting, collecting and paying VAT to all EU countries, based on where the customer is located. For example, the UK tax office explains it here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vat-supplying-digital-services-to-private-consumers/vat-businesses-supplying-digital-services-to-private-consumers  There is a special ""MOSS"" scheme for small sellers, where they pay all the VAT to their own tax office which distributes it further, but they still have to do all the customer location tracking and accounting themselves."
startups,3do032,lehmakook,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:45:31 2015 UTC,"I thought you had to check two forms of data on an accepted list, IP being one of them, but the other being something like credit card registered address.   In the case of an investigation sure you might be able to take a lying customer to court for the missing VAT but you won't be able to discharge any fines for not taking adequate procedures that allowed that to happen.   While onerous the procedures to follow to stay in the right side are pretty transparent I thought."
startups,3do032,Hallucinaut,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:00:04 2015 UTC,"Yes but if you use Paypal or Stripe, then you never get the card's registered address before completion of the sale (if selling digital products).   Take this scenario - eBook is €10 excl VAT. Customer goes to checkout and as they're from Ireland their product is now €10 + €2.30 VAT. Customer decides they don't want to pay VAT, so change their country to US at checkout. Checkout asks them to confirm their country as their IP is detected as Ireland. Customer again selects US. No billing details required for card as done through Stripe.  Now customer pays €10 with credit card at checkout and gets product. After the payment I can see their card billing details are actually from Ireland, so now I've been screwed over by the customer as their IP address and card billing address are both in Ireland. I've now lost 23% of the sale as I have to pay VAT for the customer.  I don't get how that's fair?"

A lot of the ideas I have gotten come from 37 Signals which puts out a blog with some very interesting work practices.  Some of the things I would like to implement are:   Unlimited vacation Unlimited sick days 32 hour weeks Remote working, where I would encourage employees to move not just to different places in the country but live in different countries. Team and single person projects where people could pursue different ideas that interest them.     The last thing I would want to implement and probably the most difficult is a sliding job description is the best way I can describe it.  Basically I am bored and sick of doing the same job for the past three years with no promotion and hardly any raises.  What i would want is the job to evolve with the person as they learn and grow.  I see this being difficult because I think finding managers who not only can stay on top of employees and how they are improving but also seeing their skills and where they fit in the company will be really difficult to find.  But if you can keep a job fresh and give a person the feeling of moving forward both monetarily and career wise will help keep them invested in the company.  The other issue too is if you offer too many perks like the above, will they be abused?  Will anything get accomplished or am I overdoing it too much?  It definitely would be a balancing act."

I read of one company (can't remember who) that then implemented a ""2 weeks minimum"" requirement to their unlimited PTO.  I think it's just one of those things that sounds awesome in practice, but doesn't really go exactly as planned.

startups,3divmp,ballinismyhobby,8,Fri Jul 17 00:40:56 2015 UTC,"Let's say everyone gets 2 weeks. Then when you're there for x years you'll get y days more. You don't feel bad because it's 100% yours. You have those 2 weeks. If you leave without using the 2 weeks you get paid for those days. You earned it.  On the other hand, unlimited feels like the company is doing you a favor. Like you want to take 2 weeks vacations in the summer? We'll grant it for you and approve it but you'll feel guilty because instead of those 2 weeks being yours. The company was nice enough to grant those 2 weeks. It's not only long vacations. Even a day off feels like you didn't earn it. It was given to you as a gift.   It'll also be dependent on the manager. Some managers hate when you go on vacation, so they'd really be annoying even if you take a day off. Or hey can you make your vacation a bit shorter? Other managers will be like oh a month? Approved! Have fun!"
startups,3divmp,Hannachomp,2,Fri Jul 17 01:00:30 2015 UTC,I'm in this boat. My manager is awesome but there is no reference for how much vacation is okay and how much is too much.
startups,3divmp,YikYak,2,Fri Jul 17 13:52:35 2015 UTC,And even if the manager is awesome other people will still talk. One of my coworkers would take a week off every other month sometimes more.

startups,3divmp,Hannachomp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:29:17 2015 UTC,"2 weeks is the basic entry-level for semi-professional jobs in the US. It typically does not include sick days (e.g. it is explicitly vacation days, not PTO).  Most professional jobs, especially software development jobs, will start you in the 3-week range and increase yearly at a pretty decent clip. My current employer gives you 20 days on the first paycheck in Jan to use as you wish. My last one gave 5.5 hours per paycheck (approx. 3.5 weeks). Both are/were in addition to unlimited paid sick time off (within reason obviously)."

It's ridiculously hard to take off at an early stage company for obvious reasons. It's more so they don't have to pay you when you leave the company for another job."
startups,3divmp,Hannachomp,4,Fri Jul 17 16:11:33 2015 UTC,"I have a different perspective to offer as someone who is moving from accrued PTO to unlimited PTO. In the past, I've felt bad for using PTO simply because both me and my co-workers were often doing the work of multiple people. If I took time off, that would require someone else to watch over my projects and respond to client e-mails.  I've also been in positions where accrued PTO was simply a ""guideline"" of sorts, where you could negotiate with your manager if you didn't have a sufficient allotment of hours available. In that sense, it was effectively ""unlimited"" PTO.  Bottom line? Respectfully, I feel that any hangups over unlimited PTO are purely psychological. If you feel guilty, it's because you learned that from somewhere or someone. Unlimited PTO is a different way of doing things, and as such, you have to take some responsibility to recalibrate your emotional responses.  Think about it this way, in a different sense: In order to maintain some sanity, get your work done, and have a decent work-life balance, you will have to tell people no at some point. ""No, I am too busy at the moment,"" ""No, I do not have time to help you presently,"" ""No, we can't do x since it will extend the project by 3 months,"" etc. Some people feel guilty for this. Others do not; because they have learned not to feel guilty for saying no."

startups,3divmp,Pawn1990,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:32:02 2015 UTC,IIRC companies offer these instead of pensions because they are cheaper for them. The downside for the employee is that a pension guarantees a payout whereas a 401k does not because its basically a stock portfolio. So if the market goes down so does the value of your 401k. This caused problems during the great recession because lots of people found themselves unable to afford retirement when the value of their 401ks dropped through the floor. This meant that they didnt retire (bad for them) which didnt free up their jobs (bad for other people).
startups,3divmp,TestEagleHQ,2,Fri Jul 17 09:44:05 2015 UTC,"Pensions are defined benefit (e.g. 90% of your inflation-adjusted salary after 20 years of service once you hit age 65 or whatever) while 401k is defined contribution (4% gross salary per check).  The typical argument against pensions is that you can't guarantee a certain payout many decades in the future, while the typical argument against 401k's is that they offer no real security since the money is in the market and unless you're at a high bond allocation you're vulnerable to a large downturn."

It's what is important. And it doesn't even need to be content you have produced yourself. Look at other pages in your niche. See what their posting. What works for them? Share it. (Obvious create your own content too!)  2. Interact with your community. Like people's likes. Respond to their comments. Tag people. Ask them questions. Ask for shares. Ask for invites.   3.

Even if you DONT have a tool like that, you can simply refer that user to a page/topic/discussion on your site, using support software.

I'm gonna give it to you straight, it's not an attack on your business but rather my attempt to be direct about the VC perspective.  You said so yourself that in 3-5 years consumer adoption of VR hardward will reach the critical stage. That means in 3-5 years, either you would have invested a lot into updating your equipment or be obsolete. And in any case for your business to grow, each new location will require significant investment and a relatively long time to recoup that. Essentially yours is a brick & mortar business selling VR experience as your product. It's just not as scalable as online plays. Besides, how will you exit? Maybe 250 stores worldwide and get an IPO, or acquired? Perhaps what you are looking for is not VC investors but investors who want yield, not exits.  As to why VC firms are willing to invest in these companies 3-5 years before the market matures. When the market matures 1 or 2 of these 15 companies will be unicorns and the gain will make up more than all the losses on the other 14 failures and the 10% that their 1m can buy now will be worth 100m. Each VC believe their own investment in the space is that one to blow up and is willing to bet for the insame upside.

From the business point of view, if there are different audiences that don't get along on one site so the management has to choose a stance, you choose one based on which audience monetizes better or has more potential for growth.   I would love to see the statistics on which subreddit users buy most gold or click the ads more often. Oh and don't forget that drama can generate publicity and money on its own. Only real numbers can tell which course of action is more appropriate for the management."

Founders that have all their chips in one company (without creating some stability and savings for their family) start to be very risk averse. They don't go for the big win like trying something risky that could push Digg to the size of, say, present day Facebook.

If you're a true entrepreneur, your car is the least of your concerns. The impact and growth of your company is the primary concern. So, makes more sense that it's the stability leading to bold decisions.  A VC will get very nervous if they see a founder cashing out fast, though. If I saw Kevin Rose dump most of his chips during a round of funding, I would rip up any term sheet in front of me. It's a sign that the founder lost faith in his model and wants to safeguard him/herself for life afterwards.  Reddit has too much to gain, Digg just didn't quite have the timing or platform correct. Reddit just needs smarter leaders – like a Travis Kalanick, the co-founders of Upworthy, or the boys from AirBnb."

startups,3diqa0,Naptowner,3,Fri Jul 17 08:55:04 2015 UTC,"Reddit has a massive audience, but how do you monitise it? Users are anonymous, highly resistant to overt marketing messages and generally don't believe in paying for content as a matter of principle. Unless they find some currently undiscovered way to make money from a giant, anonymous message board, this site will never generate much in the way of revenue.   Reddit is a success as a community though. Thousands of volunteer moderators keep the site going, it has huge brand affinity amongst its users and is generally seen by them as being more than a business. It also has massive reach and a level of authority as a source of information and conversation (though this is obviously being tarnished, hence the sites latest crisis).   If it was me, I'd tell the investors the bad news about reddit's monitisation potential, ask them to convert their investment to a long term loan and turn the core of the business into a non-profit. (Easier said than done, I know).   Non-profit status would lend reddit the moral authority to raise money directly from users to fund the site - donation drives, exclusive subscription only subreddits, ways to gift other redditors with goodies (expanding gold basically) - without the FUD that currently gets thrown up around that stuff on this site."

From the IRS website:   The exempt purposes set forth in section 501(c)(3) are charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition, and preventing cruelty to children or animals.  The term charitable is used in its generally accepted legal sense and includes relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged; advancement of religion; advancement of education or science; erecting or maintaining public buildings, monuments, or works; lessening the burdens of government; lessening neighborhood tensions; eliminating prejudice and discrimination; defending human and civil rights secured by law; and combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency.

If you as a person haven't changed & matured at all over the last three years, perhaps you should think about that. We want to encourage free speech, not hate. The First Amendment does not override other people's rights (besides which, not everyone is American!), and all redditors should feel welcome here.

At the end of the day, we need to pay the bills.   What is your revenue model?   New mod tools to empower moderators further. This will alleviate strain on paid admins, and accelerate growth of communities. Re-vamp the advertising tools for paid sponsorship. Currently, they're crap. Targeting is lousy, payoffs are terrible.

I would also like to see Reddit embrace the fact that it is a content sharing PLATFORM and use that to guide itself towards revenue. If Reddit is the front page of the internet, they should package their platform to be the front page of entire enterprises? Imagine Adidas pays reddit for Adidas.reddit.com, a protected corporate subreddit where people with an @adidas.com email can share company-related content and discussions.

Basically unpack the reddit experience so that more people can understand and interact with the parts of it that speak to them.  Revenue Model  Create more incentives to buy reddit gold.   Create a new model called reddit shiny which is a monthly giftbox subscription. Draw gift sources from relevant reddit trends and popular subreddits. A community giftbox of sorts.  Instead of advertising, focus on promoting subreddits that hold value for brands, advertisers, and consumers (ie: /r/DestinyTheGame , /r/wicked_edge , etc.).

Continue the unbundling process to provide single use apps/websites that have more value to brands and advertisers.  Create an enhanced avatar/badge system.

startups,3diqa0,Fredselfish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:18:17 2015 UTC,"Interesting Question, let me take a crack.  External PR: Outsource Public Image to a top PR firm, and Focus on the positive aspects of the Reddit Community. How many stories have there been on here where a random person or people have touched the lives of others in a positive way?! Seriously, thousands. Have that PR firm drill down for these things and focus on them. I would immediately set up an interview with 60 minutes, CBS nightly news, Tech Crunch, etc. Give them full access to reddit etc. Show that we take our community and image seriously. This is to satify investors and public perception of reddit.   Internalize Reddit Community PR: First order of business is to truly engage with the Mods and ensure their needs are met. I would also suggest that they agree to a Mod code of conduct. The admins would review the work of the Mods to see if they promoted hate speech, upvoted remarks by users of inflamatory language, Review the PM's etc. If they didn't meet the code of conduct in the past they would be gone.They would hate the hell out of this, but it would be to their advantage to sign it and here is how.  Revenue Model: Well, pretty simple really. Have reddit gifts become an etsy type marketplace for millions of Redditors to tout their wares. This will keep money within the community and make redditors and reddit money. Secondly advertising. You want to know why that code of conduct was important to sign? Well you do now. Mods that sign and keep an active robust community are now sharing in the profits for their hard work. Subs that are hate filled and derogatory as well as hateful users eventually will die off. No one is going to advertise on r/ihate...whatever. If they want that money they have to keep the community legit. Mods who are diligent in banning commenters who are all about that hate and don't contribute positively to the community will not have the advertising revenue. Obviously the Mods of the large subs will make more, but they deserve it because they have the most subscribers who the advertisers will obviously want to target. However, there will also be an activity score which will also lead to revenue. For example if one of the smaller subs has a seriously active userbase with lots of comments and discussions even if it is small will appeal to advertisers too. For example /r/IAmA has like 8 million subscribers, but how many of those actively comment % vs, a smaller community which is incredibly active %? This score will be presented to advertisers as well as using those subs to create target or geographical based advertising algorithms. There will also be a promotion system based on Growth and Activity for the Mods of smaller subs. Are we getting the picture here? IS THIS STARTING TO LOOK LIKE A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS!!!  I am the CEO, I have no power over the board; however, I would become friendly with the Money Guys, not the Founders. Why? Because the idea guys don't pay my salary and it's those idea guys that got us into this shit hole in the first place. That being said, I would make sure I listen to Alexis and see what his vision is. I would take that vision and talk it over with the Admins to see if A. It is possible B. Can we implement it C. Can we make money on it D. How will it affect the community. We need to have a company wide vision and compromise is necessary. Also tell them to get the hell of Reddit for awhile. They shouldn't answer to the community, let me and our PR team do that. Essentially we need to start to run like a company and not community.  Let the PR team handle it. Draft a statement blah blah blah and address what Yishan said in my interview with 60 minutes. Be real about my feelings but respect his opinion on the matter. LIKE WHAT REDDIT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT ANYWAY!! A forum for discussion and respectful debate! ""Yes he said that and I feel...but this is how we are tacking these problems and how we are addressing the needs of the community at large...""  The free speech issue will be handled by the Mods if they want to receive bonus income won't they. I would also make sure that we do a ""Auditt"" of the subs and content on a yearly basis to identify users who use ""free speech to incite hatred"". Because fuck them. I am not saying I would ban someone for insulting someone else, like calling them an idiot, but I would ban them if they didn't back that up with a solid reason. Three dumb comments and you are out policy, but I would generally leave that up to the mods.   Hate subs would die off anyway with an Auditt anyway and No Mod of the hate subs would agree to the code of conduct anyway. No advertisers will pay to be associated with them. They will all die a relatively quick death without having the community backlash that we saw with the banning of r/fatpeoplehate.   EDIT: Lastly, i would hire the best Ad-Sales people and pay them well to bring in revenue. You can't make money if you can't sell your product. This is the 1 thing that start-ups lack in spades. They have a great idea, but they don't know how to sell it or how to valuate the product. That is what I do for my company and we do pretty damn well.  Sorry this was so long.

Without communication, there is no path to opening peoples minds and exposing them to knew thoughts.  Looking at the long-term benefits, even bad/harmful communication is better than no communication  So how do we fix hate and manage free speech without censorship?  Personal filters.  Everybody has different subjects and different limits on what they want to be exposed to.  For example, some people don't want to hear about fat people hate, others don't want to hear about marijuana, etc...  Each reddit account should have whitelists and blacklists of terms that are applied to each post.  The lists should be able to be applied site-wide or to specific subreddits.  Eg: I want looser standards on news subreddits than on other subreddits.  The admins should provide site-wide whitelists and blacklists that users can subscribe to (and can override with their own preferences).  Mods should also be able publish whitelists and blacklists for their subreddits.  The public reddit account and newly created accounts should default to using conservative white/black lists.  This will even help with legal compliance.  Users from countries with specific content policies can have additional blacklists automatically added at the time of account creation.  This personal filtering could be made even more useful by factoring in response postings.  With a more advanced filtering model (eg: bayesian), the contents of responses could count for/against the parent message.  Eventually this could grow into using AI training.  How do you handle the board/executives?  Show them the money.  More users attract more advertisers.   Being 'free speech' is attractive to many educated people.  Automatically restricting legally banned content allows you to enter more markets.  Blocking distasteful speech by default makes average users more comfortable and avoids bad PR.  tl;dr Replacing censorship with personal filtering fixes most of reddits problems."
startups,3diqa0,Adjudikated,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:35:00 2015 UTC,Why doesn't reddit do advertising? I have never understood this. They are losing out on so much money.
startups,3diqa0,StanTheRebel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:40:15 2015 UTC,If I was charge of Reddit I will do many things. One I would put in place ways to get things other than Reddit gold. I would also have ways to contribute.    Reddit Gold=$25    Sliver= 10   Bronze=5     Because not all of us can afford to give gold but allowing for smaller contributes would also show support.   Also make karma actually worth something. Allow karma to cash in for prizes or be use for privileges on Reddit. It would encourage more people to post good content and discourse those who only troll for negative karma.  I think not banning subs but instead allow only things to show up If you are subscribe to them.   That way things that you disagree with you will not know exist. And allow individuals choose to ban subs and content they don't want to see.   Examples would be if you don't want to see content that is political incorrect you can check a box and basically shadow bans such content. Also language or words you find offensive. Tailor Reddit to your personal liking. Which would allow the rest of us to enjoy the free speech we enjoy.  So subs like fatpeoplehate could still exist but those who don't want to know such things would never have to deal with it.    I think that would limit the amount of botching from people who complain about these things and at the same time allows those community to do what they enjoy even if others disagree.    I know most of this is unrealistic and probably be lots of flaws but some of it could work and weed out what doesn't.    Most importantly the admins NEED to listen to the community and do what is best for them. Since without them there is no Reddit. Not carter to the advertisers.

startups,3diqa0,rand486,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:46:38 2015 UTC,"1 - How to Handle PR You can't have one solid fix-all solution that fits all scenarios. PR is something that is fluid and dynamic; a PR plan really needs to be fluid in a situation like this. However due to the negative press right now I would actually look towards a Company like Blackberry when John Chen first took power for the turn-around; I feel like the level of transparency was healthy, especially in the way in which he delivered it, while at the same time giving himself and the Company enough room to migrate some of the smaller issues troubling the Company at the time. But prior to even diving into the PR side of things a solid plan would probably need to be formulated and begin getting implemented in regards to how Reddit would actually follow through with some of its recent promises to investors and the community.  2 - Revenue Model The beta mobile site looks beautiful; and I'd push to complete that across re-design across all platforms prior to chasing changes in the revenue model. After the re-design was implemented I would focus heavily on sponsored content similar to how Ebay and Kijiji currently run sponsored advertising. This would make ads more visually appealing to users and probably increase click through rates. Gold members would obviously have a reduction/elimination in this advertising. Thus creating a Freemium/Premium membership system.  I'm not quite confident in the current plan to monetize AMA; however I do believe there might be some opportunities with the proper implementation to make some money in this area. For example creating a subreddit during political campaigns that provides politicians a chance to engage voters in a new-age type of debate platform would be HUGE. I could see the site being able to provide this service and being able to pocket a fair bit of the proceeds because you could literally have this subreddit front and center for all the constituent users of that region.   3 - People Problem Not 100% sure what context you see the people as being a problem over. If you mean in relation to the talent retention of reddit itself or the users of reddit.  4 - The Board The board is either your greatest ally or your greatest enemy. If you are going to walk into the role of CEO you better damn well know how to work with a board (the Reddit board or any other for that fact) or at least be humble enough to learn to work with them.   However right now with this tidal wave of troubled waters circulating around Reddit; the best thing any new CEO could do is draw up an action plan, present it and humbly look for advice from the board to improve it; since at this point they  probably have a better idea of the underlying operational concerns then you will as joe blow redditor crowned supreme overlord of the reddits.   5 - Alexis Alexis is a co-founder. Like him or not he helped to provide the vision for this glorious bastion of free speech. Now some might say he is losing his vision for what he wanted this to originally be, and definitely it would appear as though the direction he wants to head isn't what the community wants. However I think Alexis would serve great as an adviser to a person walking into the role of CEO in a situation like this; granted the newly crowned CEO wasn't a pussy. Alexis is in a prime position to play devils advocate and to become the perfect counter-balance to where this site needs to go. Even if you weren't a strong willed CEO and couldn't work with him; it would still be smart to keep your friends close and your enemies closer in this situation.  6 - Yishan Revelations Yishan has made acouple revelations relatively recently. Really alot of what I've seen ties into problems addressed elsewhere. As a CEO your job is to provide vision, focus, and leadership. Right now there are alot of voices with alot of opinions. Pick a direction, communicate it (have an AMA, as risky as it is, if need be), and work your ass off to implement it. Not everyone is going to like your direction and not everyone is going to agree with it. But if the majority are happy then thats worth the few.  7 & 8 - Free Speech & Hate Subs In a perfect world; the best choice of action would honestly be a three pronged approach. Evaluate first and foremost what your free speech policy is going to be; which should be legal, tolerated among your user base, and which does not promote hate.   Secondly look at the reporting process for reporting hate materials so that it can be as an effective process as possible.   Lastly; the rating system of posts should be reviewed and should have a feature that allows community moderation based on how the community is offended by a thread's contents. Currently we already have it to a minimal degree where comments below a certain threshold aren't visible. Subreddits below a certain threshold should probably be the same for some individuals based on their user preferences. Basically the more un-desireable the content for a user, the less chance of them interacting with that content. And that isn't trying to muffle the rights of any individual, I'm talking about doing it in a manner that maximizes user experience."
startups,3diqa0,manys,0,Thu Jul 16 23:56:42 2015 UTC,"I elect myself to be the new reddit CEO.  As the new reddit CEO, I will create several core values starting with but not limited to free speech, transparency, reservation, profitability and communication. Since reddit is not only a business but a movement, I will do my best to balance the two while maintaining integrity of our core values. Reddit needs to make money, but it must also cater and care for it's users who submit all the content.  My first idea is to allow subreddits to start selling merchandise once they reach a certain size. Reddit will take 15% of all sales, which will be used to pay off investors and fund future development of reddit. What subreddits can sell and the rules behind commerce are yet to be discussed. It must be fair to everyone while maintaining our integrity. It's bound to be abused.  My second idea is to add more value to reddit gold. Reddit gold must provide more features than it currently does. Things like being able to read deleted comments (before an expiration date), post more content per hour and connect a bitcoin wallet to your account are just a few ideas."

I think that you would be better off investing in, say, an S&P  500 index fund and just hold it forever. In his case, he wasn't well diversified like that and wasn't willing to wait out the market cycle.

He points out that a ""successful"" career as an employee and patient investor will - at best - give you enough money to probably last through your old age.  Or not.  To be rich, take a risk, start a company.  DeMarco does tend to minimize the chances of that path failing.  He tells his own story modestly.  ""I taught myself to program, created a website, it made a lot of money, and now I spend my time cashing checks and driving the car of my dreams.""  Great, but that didn't work for everybody who tried it.  I take it with a grain of salt, but it has influenced me."

I'm biased towards his views on business but I think most of the points he makes are fundamentally sound. It all comes down to the fact that your time caps the amount of money you can make in a normal job. But a business gives you a chance to leverage your time massively.  Anyway, I did enjoy it, if only he stopped talking about his Lamborghini!"

startups,3dhla3,themindofmany,3,Thu Jul 16 09:44:31 2015 UTC,"One of the most important things people need to do is find something that forces them to be in the moment. De-stressing activities are crucial, but the problem is that many of those will fail to keep you in the moment when you're really stressed, and hence will fail in their purpose.  For me, it's improvising while playing guitar or cooking. Improvising requires you to focus on the music you're playing over, which prevents you from being preoccupied. Cooking involves so many senses that it's almost like your mental RAM doesn't have the processing power to think about your stress.  Obviously this won't always work. If you're massively preoccupied, these activities won't necessarily be able to kick your ass out of the thought loops you find yourself in. Which is when I recommend breaking the routine. Go to a concert, see a movie in IMax, go to a casino, whatever."

If your app handles this WAY better than facebook, I might download it- but I would never bother convincing my friends to do so to. Not to mention, you're relying on all attendees being iOS users.  There are two situations under which I can imagine myself using software like this:   It's web based, with no registration required, I can send my friends a link and they can use it right away. It's for business use, I can tell my employees what event software to use."

Looking at the 'create event' part, why do I need a picture for it? description? an end time? I think all this can be cut out to make it a lot faster. To solve the problem of me not having any other friends with the app, you may want to look into letting me interact with my friends via SMS or something of the sort. I think you really have to shorten the time from downloading the app to getting inside of it. It took around 5 steps to get there from downloading the app. Interesting idea, if you can make it a more effortless experience I'd be a happy user."

startups,3dgg2u,Jbasket,16,Thu Jul 16 02:00:38 2015 UTC,"This is interesting, but I think it's a little bit too business-y. Your tagline is ""Optimized Resume Solutions"". I know what a resume is. What's a resume solution? If you create me a great resume, use that tagline.  Looking further down the page, I feel like I'm not entirely sure what I would get from the three options. The free tier, ""Resume Optimization Critique"" -- do I get an automated report about my existing resume? One of the three description lines is bolded, so it must be the most important, right? It says ""Include your email"". Include my email? Where? Why? Is this a resume tip? Or is it just that if a submitted resume doesn't include an email, you don't have a way to give me the report?  The first bullet point is ""Improve your own Resume"". As opposed to improving someone else's? The middle bullet point -- ""Effective Recommendations"" -- is the closest thing to telling me what I'm going to get.  You might want to rewrite the bullets to say a few things:   What the process is; what you get from it (""automated report about your resume"") The content of the results (""concrete suggestions for wording, content, and formatting"")   If I look at the expensive package, two of the three bullet points don't speak to me at all. I have no idea what the second -- ""ATS Optimized Format"" -- means. Is the format of the review you do? Is the format of the resume you give me? Heck, do you make me a resume here? What's ATS?  The bullets for this could be something like:   A custom resume we create by hand Formatted to easily pass HR hurdles Copy written by experts   Remember that you're speaking to me, a person who doesn't like the recruiting process. If your sell is ""this format you don't know about? We do that"", I won't care.

I'm thinking Snapchat where you show 'Crazy ways to eat your cookie', or other themes. Periscope the process of making them/packing them/pitching to retailers. You get the idea... maybe it sucks, maybe not.   Website   Low image quality (as mentioned elsewhere in this thread). Various typos (e.g. ""caffeinated chocolate chip smart cookies cookies""). The URL sounds too much like a marijuana edible (i.e. ""get up and go, baked!"") - could be because I'm in the PNW, so feel free to disregard as bias. :)   Product   Where is the ingredients list? Do you want the association with energy ""shots""? Why not coffee? ""Shots"" makes me think of artificial ingredients and things far worse for me than baked goods or coffee - again, could just be bias. Speaking of which, why chocolate chip cookies?   Service   Why 12 cookies monthly? If I cancel, why do I need to do so 4-5 days before the first of the month? Need to minimize friction/effort for consumer.   Misc.   For what it's worth, I like the name ""Smart Cookie"" more than ""Get Up and Go"". Product positioning seems scattered. For example:    ""Who doesn’t want to be a smarter cookie? With one of our caffeinated chocolate chip smart cookies cookies, your day will become a little brighter, and you may become a little smarter.""  You're saying that these cookies make me smarter - but do I drink coffee to be smart, or to be alert and ready to go? The ""Get Up and Go"" accomplishes this, but the blurb above detracts."

startups,3dg06t,Sybertron,7,Thu Jul 16 13:58:07 2015 UTC,"An expensive mistake most relatively inexperienced marketers seem to make is to think and experiment tactically, rather than thinking strategically and choose tactics to support a strategy.  I see plenty of evidence of it scattered throughout the responses in this thread.  A winning strategy begins with an analysis of where you are today, versus where you are trying to take your business next. There are various models for this kind of analysis, but keep it simple. Taking stock of your competitive (S)trengths and (W)eaknesses, (O)pportunities, and any real potential (T)hreats to your ability to achieve your strategic objective (this model  is called ""SWOT"" analysis) can be an enlightening experience.  Another common and expensive mistake is to focus exclusively on acquiring new customers, without maximizing sales and referrals from existing customers. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush. Assuming you have a great product/experience it will always be easier, faster and cheaper to sell more to your existing customers and their friends/colleagues than it is to acquire a new customer.  Think strategically, then decide which tactics fit. There are a lot of very good ideas in the comments you've received so far, but how do they fit your strategy? Don't put the cart before the horse. Based on your SWOT analysis, develop a strategic marketing plan to accomplish measurable objectives that achieve your goals for (for example) the next 3 Years. Finally, develop and execute annual (tactical) marketing plans for accomplishing your objectives.  My recommendations: - Set some goals for your business - Conduct a thorough SWOT analysis - Develop a strategic marketing plan - Be sure to leverage your customers - Develop and execute annual marketing plans - Peruse this thread for tactics that fit  If you haven't gone through the process before, and you're not in a position to hire experienced marketing leadership – consider contracting an agency or an experienced consultant (ahem!) to guide you through the process.   Make sense? Questions?  Good luck!"

startups,3dg06t,chubbyasianfeet,2,Thu Jul 16 02:08:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is the feedback you want, but here's my two cents. My first impression was ""that sounds awesome, I'd love some!"" I went to the site, found the shop page, and then was turned off by the prices. I've used caffeine pills regularly at different points in life and so there's no reason I can't eat a caffeine pill then eat a cookie for maybe 1/2 or less in price. I thought it was definitely an upgrade to have price reductions for monthly subscriptions, and maybe that should be more prominently featured on the shop page to reel back cheapskates like me.   It almost seems to me that in one way your target demographic depends on not knowing the price and convenience of OTC caffeine pills (~$3 for ~20 grams, which is a lot). As such, it seems to me that your return buyers would be interested more in the brand/lifestyle and taste over the utilitarian aspects. I mean, cookies aren't exactly utilitarian anyways. I liked the idea /u/mailto_devnull had about targeting fitness-oriented groups: you're selling something to be consumed in the morning/afternoon and if you packed them full of protein you could definitely brand it as more of an active-lifestyle snack.  You have something that people can only get from you. If they like the taste (which, taste being  a fairly subjective thing, I think it's a reasonable inference that statistically someone has to like the  taste), then they will want more. I think maybe the biggest reason you're having trouble selling online though is that people aren't used to buying snacky foods online. When I buy stuff online, I find the most ridiculously cheap prices and best deals possible. People spend higher prices on convenience food when it's in convenient places: at the end of a checkout aisle, in the vending machine in the break room, etc. I think you will find way more subscribers if you push your product irl in places that people want snacks on the go. I think /u/very_nice_how_much hit this pretty well on the head and I would say the takeaway idea is to innovate a way to reach hungry commuters in the mornings who missed their breakfast. Think subway, bus, sidewalk, etc.   P.S. Use transparent pngs!!!"
startups,3dg06t,chubbyasianfeet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:37:01 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you for the detailed comment :). We sell in a lot of retail stores, but are focusing on subscription and online because we it helps pay rent. To be transparent, I currently pay myself about $1,000 per month, not much! But, I love doing this.   Yes OTC caffeine pills are cheap, but we also use all natural ingredients. We NEED to market that better, and good thing you pointed this out :).  Arguably, you could say the same thing about coffee as far as high price (think starbucks), but then again we are very focused on the product tasting really, really good, so with cheaper prices I couldn't pay myself. Although, in the future i'd like to be at a cheaper price point.   Thanks again for the feedback, i'll work on that stuff!"
startups,3dg06t,scottrepreneur,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:46:08 2015 UTC,"You are welcome! :) A quick followup: are you saying you use natural caffeine sources too? Like actual coffee beans or similar as an ingredient? Or is it a caffeine powder mixed into other natural ingredients? If it is a powder, maybe make some cookies with really good coffee in them.. That sounds pretty fantastic honestly. Mmmm, sumatra cookies to dip in almond milk... [side note: just read the ""about"". It mentions espresso cookies, but they aren't in the ""shop"" section? you tease.]  I agree with the Starbucks sentiment. It is a luxury product, as are your cookies. I actually drink Starbucks pretty regularly (I make their coffee at home though), and I pay a little extra because I know the quality is good. But I can't know that for the cookies unless I try one. I hesitate to go through with getting a free one though. I think that's because I don't know where you're located right away when I get on the site and it seems like the effort will take so long to be rewarded. I'd rather buy one at a street corner on a whim than have to think about it online.  Oh! Something I was going to mention: I can't tell how big your products are from the website. There's no images of people eating them/etc. for scale. If the cookie looked bigger, I'd maybe be more willing to drop $30 on some.   Good luck! :)"

I am one of the founders of a company called GridApp Systems whose first product was a.....database appliance!  We raised a bunch of VC funding, pivoted to a software-only model in an adjacent field, and eventually sold the company to BMC software.  This is a space and problem set and market I know very well.  Here's my advice: do something else.  Databases are a terrible industry to try to sell into generally, and this product in particular is in a rough spot:   DBAs are typically risk-averse.  Data protection is extremely important to them.  Startups around data protection have a high bar to cross before people will use them, and sitting in the middle of the data path makes it even less likely. Databases that need to be accelerated usually are extremely important and are even less likely to have an untested product in the middle You have to think about your target market as a series of intersecting circles.  In your case, your requirements are: using Hibernate, facing performance problems, but can't scale their database currently, at a mid-size company.  I suspect the intersection of those circles is very very small, and it will be extraordinarily difficult to identify those people You're also in a situation where you have to hit them at the right time, where they have performance problems, but haven't yet fixed the problem themselves.  It's a very narrow window scaling has gotten easier - hardware scales very big vertically before you need to scale out, so you can often buy your way out of problems.   So - this just isnt' a big enough market for you to effectively address."
startups,3dhpk8,mzito,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks a ton for your inputs Mzito, appreciate it.    I agree with your perspectives and have received similar inputs. I have a few more questions and would love to hear your thoughts:    Others have told us what you are saying - touch the database, its environment and you will be road-kill. Which is why we are positioning ourselves as yet-another-application in the application/web server space as against being a component in the database space.  We would rather take on SLAs applicable to the applications space.    You are also right when you say that getting into the middle of the OLTP thread of applications will not be easy - others have told us that too. However, as we talked to people, it looks like there's a class of applications - the (so called) analytics applications. These apps. extract data out of the database (no, no hadoop here), crunch it and produce daily/weekly reports - a more sexed up name for the reporting tools if you will.  These don't fall into the main production application bucket.    The issue is that, these new apps put additional (and increasing) load on the db - thus requiring further addition of partition licenses, hardware, db tuning etc., etc.,  ACID compliance and such like things are not too important as these apps only read and crunch data on a regular basis.    We (hopefully) could use this segment to get off the ground and then leverage our position inside the enterprise to become more mainstream (a.k.a move into the applications part of the OLTP thread).    We have just begun work on a POC that fits this kind of application and were trying to get better insights on who should we approach for POCs and what our go-to-market would be like.    My questions are:      * Do you think the above could be a viable way to go?      * Which are the segments that have an ongoing and increasing need for such analytics/reports - where the data sizes are significant and increasing as well as the need for running such reports are getting to be more frequent. * Which companies within these segments would be best suited for us to approach to see if they are interested in doing a POC with us? * Is there some other similar class of application (not mainstream) that will not have high reliability requirements but yet is necessary for running the enterprise?    BTW, I wondered if we could do a con-call to get more insights.  We're happy to talk about what we've done so far, the POCs around this.  A Skype call or a Google hangout at your convenience would work."

startups,3de4e6,nezia,3,Wed Jul 15 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"yeah, you could go with location, and have a map so that it looks more general and less specific."
startups,3de4e6,blakeseven,6,Wed Jul 15 18:09:40 2015 UTC,"in addition...the question is if it is reasonable to open up with a general address field right from the beginning.  The issue is that you seem to offer storage space everywhere, but you merely will have providers in the beginning. Many customers that accidentally end up your page will be bummed out about no provider being near them.   As with most location based businesses (uber, instacart, spoonrocket etc.) you should seize one city at a time. Start locally and limited and then expend."

Enter an address seems too personal for my first interaction.  Why not use Zip Code?  The pictures show boxes in a room and your drawing kind of indicate that too... so it that the service?  Put my stuff in a cardboard box and leave it in someone's empty corner?  I don't think that matches the text on the service so it seems the imagery might be miss leading and a turn off (since it lacks security).  No information on who you are (or privacy statement, terms or contact).  again this might come off as a phishing website since it lacks anything real to back it up.  Also on the WHO... frankly, who are you?  You want me to be engaged but you can;t even share who the team is, where you are located, why you are the company to look to for this service?  You have to try a little harder than that.  A minimum of a founders page, short bios, a contact page and some social streams must be developed to be taken seriously.  Plus you mention in the copy you have insurance - prove it.  Also that you are the lowest in the ""biz"" - compared to what?  You have a solution...  what might that be?  A mobile app?  Website?

So OP should either vary his fonts or switch for another one.      Try Lobster for the tagline maybe?   IMHO Lobster is a terrible font, it was ok to use it during the whole webfonts revolution but is now generally regarded as a bad move. But you're on the right track, OP needs more curves in his titles.   I'd suggest throwing in something in the vein of Signika in combination with Open Sans if he wants to keep it.   here is a screenshot of the page with Signika everywhere, feels friendlier already without looking cheap (Lobster does that)."

As a potential users I'd want to scroll through a list of currently listed spaces and get an idea of what the cost is, what the actual spaces are like and a little bit of a feel for who the hosts are.  For testing purposes this can be FPO content, but it needs to be there. Give the user a way to passively click around the site and get some type of value for spending time here.  A featured hosts section would be good too. Show me what kind of people are willing to store my couch in their garage. What kind of neighborhood do they live in. Is their place nice?

Very picky, but I don't like how the green button is on top of the green ladder.  You haven't established trust yet, I'm not doing to give you my address. Start with a smaller ask first. Your content is broken up into two rows of three columns. Break this up with some full width content, or a 1/3 - 2/3 split content.  Don't make me read.

Forget rephrasing the damn text in the box, that part doesn't actually matter.  Just come out and say what city you're going to launch in, and when (roughly). Ask for my email address so I can say I'm interested, tell me when you come to $city, but really, I'm already using my IP address to access your site, so you don't make me enter anything. GeoIP may not be perfect, but it's enough to realize I'm three states away from your launch market.  I'm sure you're tabulating the entries into the box and using that to help determine launch market, but you should already have a short list you've made from other reasons. The number of people in a given market that have interacted with your signup page is an interesting detail, but at the end of the day on the list of reasons to pick a given market to launch, ""number people that used your pre-launch"" site should be far from the top list of reasons.  Add a manual button/hover thing so I can put something in if the geo-ip is bad and I really want to test out the service.  But seriously, just say ""San Francisco"" or ""Boston"" or whatever.

I have no idea where spaces are available, and whether it is supposed to be global or not. Also, there is a huge loss in the level of trust of a company by having .co instead of .com  I am under the assumption that that site is only serving the purpose of finding people that need storage space, not of finding people that want to store stuff in their house. I don't see any copy directed toward the latter.  I would think that having someone only type in their city or zip (postal) code would be a good thing, or perhaps a dropdown list of countries/states to give the user an idea of where the service is available.  You might need a safer-sounding platform to leap off of. Uber started with licensed taxis before moving to normal people, AirBNB grew by grabbing a B&B market while Couchsurfing tanked. Maybe calling it a shared storage location or something would be better. Make it sound like a warehouse of safety deposit boxes.  If the address is going to be a house/business address, then make sure the copy states that there is some kind of vetting process for the contractors leasing that space.  Also, how are you the ""cheapest in the biz"" if it's cheaper for me to get a 5'x5' from public storage than it is to store a bike using your service? Prices should be location dependent; a 5'x5' space is much more valuable in SF or NYC than in suburban/exurban areas."

There isn't enough diversification in the type either. The headline is huge, the logo is big, the tagline is big. I'd make all of them smaller and adjust the sizes to spread things out a bit. Customize the border on the input field (the 3d bevel makes it seem very dated). Change the styling on the button. The hover state with black outline is strange and too drastic. Try making the hover state marginally darker than the normal state to give it a cleaner transition.  For the next section, I'm not a big fan of the green, black, and white. It just doesn't seem to flow, especially with that typeface. There isn't enough subtlety and whitespace--everything just seems huge and distracting. I'd tone the sizes down to add some white space between them. Consider using a grey to tone it back.  Overall, it's not too bad. Mostly design critiques from me and the biggest thing is the lack of typographical hierarchy. I'd switch the font entirely and give the sizes more variety. Neat idea, too!"

My GF and I used this when we shacked up and consolidated 2 x 1 BR of furniture to 1 X 1 BR.  While $70 storage for a couch is certainly less than $80 for a small room dedicated to dump a whole ton of things (including a couch), I'm wondering if you've really thought out your competition here? And if I can't find room for a box of things, I'd typically look at ikea or the container store for creative storage, or make room by discarding less valuable items. Not to be a wet towel.

startups,3dh164,Bich_tits,2,Thu Jul 16 05:15:23 2015 UTC,"If you cut out the bit in the middle (the business) - this means you are taking a loan to fund the living expenses of the founders - with a bit of small change to be spent on the business.  I'd say that's just about OK if you're super confident that the business will pay you that back several times over in the next 6-12 months.  If you have any doubts at all about that last bit, don't do it!"
startups,3dh164,dotcomdude,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:43:38 2015 UTC,With only $30k I'd hope you all had living expenses saved for at least 6 months already.  You should be using your own money to support yourselves over this time and put the whole $30k into the business.  Spending almost all of it on salaries is completely the wrong way to do it.
startups,3dh164,sanswork,2,Thu Jul 16 05:49:46 2015 UTC,"I work on the side as a software engineer contractor. It's super flexible and allows me to work remotely if I want to. The others don't have jobs so they need income more than I do right now. I have been unpaid for about 1 year since I started this company, the others have been unpaid for about 5-7 months. I do think we need some money for bills and living but 4k a month seems very high.  I agree that it's not the right way to do it but they seem very lax and their rationale is we are going to raise even more money (but nothing has been promised).. I really think it's a terrible idea and as CEO I want to spend money wisely and make the dollars stretch, it seems that this is going to cause tension so I wanted some input from others."
startups,3dh164,sanswork,2,Thu Jul 16 06:05:05 2015 UTC,It really doesn't matter if they don't work that money isn't enough to go around and depending on money you haven't raised yet is a great way to run out of money way before you can raise.  If you're CEO I think you really need to explain to them that the money is worth a lot more spent on growing the business than their pockets.  As long as they all have fairly equal equity as co-founders and not employers they shouldn't be expecting a salary from the start.  Basically what they want is stupid and if you let them do it then your company will probably be broke in a month or two and you'll all be stuck owing $30k for nothing.  Tell them to get side jobs or something if they can't afford to live without it.  $8k isn't much money they should be able to earn that much fairly easily through other means but it can mean a lot to your company.

startups,3dh164,justjimm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:56:54 2015 UTC,"It depends on what your startup needs. If you're in a position where money is going to be particularly helpful, save more of that for operating expenses. If you're in a waiting stage, where you just need to get a few things done before you're ready and the primary concern is not starving before the product is ready for launch, use a good portion for living expenses.  Live frugally and at least double the money you're putting toward operating expenses. You never know when you'll need it."

But you shouldn't be paying yourselves with a loan, or even investor's money (the initial round). To be frank, it's irresponsible.  30K is nothing in the long run and in the short term, if you can't survive without taking a salary, you shouldn't be doing this. I'd understand if it was only a small part, and for ramen money, but 24k out of 30k is way too much!   Unless you guys are grinding 16 hours a day, set a side 4 hours a day and get part time work."

If you walked away today...what would it take him to rebuild all unpaid code you wrote....plus what is he going to have to pay to bring on another person with full stack experience?  People see a little bit of daylight and want to be greedy...which ultimately destroys the company from within.  These types of people never learn.  With an offer of 5%...that is a slap in the face.  Estimate your unpaid hours and then send him an invoice at $100 per hour (typical market rate value) for all the unpaid hours worked.  Then being the nice guy you are...offer to trade equity of 40% to his 60%.  If he doesn't, then take all your unpaid code with you.  I am sure there is no way he can spin it that you would have agreed to work 6 years for only 5% up front...that is insane.  Now that he sees there might be some money in the future, he is getting greedy and thinking his idea is a multi-million dollar idea and the only reason the company is gonna make it big.  The fact is that people/founders make an idea a multi-million dollar idea.  Most of the time, investors are looking more at the team than the product.  A good team can market, sell and build anything....and make money as a result...even with a mediocre product. There are much better people out there who are more qualified to do sales and marketing, don't get stuck another 6 years with the wrong one."
startups,3de4os,the_brizzler,2,Thu Jul 16 04:02:37 2015 UTC,"This is good perspective.  He is building his team, which has taken a while but has just really come together in the past weeks or month.  He has not found his tech side as far as I know.  We've both agreed however that qualified tech people will be difficult to find, and he doesn't have the funds to pay a great salary or offer security.  We were considering a junior tech guy to expedite my lead, but even then were considering a recent college grad or similar.  He doesn't know how to find tech talent, nor is he qualified to interview for it even.  In fact, he knows so little about the real details of the back end, I'm not sure how that would even work.  It would not be his best next move for the tech side for sure.  As for separating the code-- there is no real dividing line of what was paid and what was free.  It's a very large code base, with many parts.  Nothing can really be removed without the entire thing becoming dysfunctional or having a hole in it.  It's usually more like being paid to start a large new initiative, and then working free for a medium period until something large is needed again.  Or expanding out new sections together when no payment is really needed.    One could assign a dollar value to that, which is not what I'm interested in, but there is something also to be said for contributing X hours unpaid/under-market for the first few years grows to something bigger as it all comes together.  The goal of early equity (even sweat equity) in early years startup is not the face value, but the value of the end product years later if it succeeds, and being a part of that success."
startups,3de4os,the_brizzler,2,Thu Jul 16 13:54:38 2015 UTC,"Yea, assigning the dollar value isn't because you are interested in the money, but to help him understand the true value/cost of development and what you could have made if you had chosen to work on other projects. Non tech people typically have a hard time of understanding the worth of a good developer. I had some people come to me with their startup and asked me what I would charge to build their product from the ground up...and I told them $100 an hour. They did some research and came back saying they couldn't find anything near that rate....so I asked, what did you find? They said, ""We googled full stack developer salary and we found that the average was 120k a year (or whatever it was) which equates to about 60 an hour. "". So I asked them if they had an office for me, with a garenteed paycheck every 2 weeks at an established company (to minimize my risk of the company going out of business and me losing my job) and we're they offering dental, health and vision insurance, plus paid time off? It was obvious they had no idea that is why a contracting rate is typically much higher. So for your friend at this point is taking advantage of you and trying to profit off your hard work. Problem is that he probably doesn't understand the real cost of a developer like yourself and might think 5% is fair. So you may need to help him realize what the true cost of development is."

""What will it take?"".  I've told him I expect not an employee role but some sort of cofounder role based off the last 6 years, where we can negotiate exact percentages as needed.    He suggested 5% based off history, growing with responsibilities added, and I baulked at that a bit.  Partially because of the low percent, but also because I'm not looking to start a job and maybe ""add responsibility"" when I prove myself.  I've been doing EVERYTHING until now, and want to manage it as a founding partner.  I feel I've already earned or proved that.  We've not yet been in a place to do anything more than discuss in conversation, where we probably need to sit down and weigh factors.

If you have no written agreement, then you have no reasonable expectation to any share, none, zip, nadda.  Sucks but it isn't like your partner misrepresented the situation by promising something and not delivering. If anything you're guilty of that for agreeing to work at $25/hr (plus unpaid hours), if in reality you actually meant $25/hr + equity."
startups,3de4os,FITGuard,2,Wed Jul 15 16:32:51 2015 UTC,"You were taking below market salary with no agreement asking for equity.  For all he knew, he was paying you exactly what you were worth.  He was risking everything, money, all his time etc.  In his eyes, you were only risking a few hours a night here and there.   Regardless of how you and he feels, the only thing that matters is the plan going forward.  If he truly has no technical ability, he will want you to be part of the business going forward, especially when you raise your A round.  VCs are not going to look kindly on a founder with no tech experience running a tech company and may give him a lower valuation unless he can convince them that a replacement for you is easy.  (He is likely already working on this if you are asking for 40% of his company)  If you are willing to quit your job and start full-time right now, I could see you asking for some equity on a 4 year vesting schedule that starts right now.  The last 6 years were work you offered in exchange for payment.  The next 4 will be work in exchange for equity and payment.    Also, one caveat.  I haven't read your emails over the past 6 years and before you do anything, you may want to consult with an attorney. You may have a legal right to ownership or other employment related payments owed.  Before offering anything to him, I would consider hiring a lawyer.

My co-founder and I decided to form an LLC which I own 70% and he owns 30%, for mainly of the reasons similar to yours above. Then the that LLC we owned, opened a whole-owned subsidiary where we actually run the business, take investments, and gross revenue.   Therefore, you could approach your friend to explain that you were a co-founder since day one and you want to form a parent company to reflect that. Then when investments came in, or more equity was distributed you would split everything X/Y. This was beneficial for us because it means we both had the same incentive, earn as much money as possible. Rather than compete for one another or ever fear we were being screwed over."

So you are nothing special and there is an entire ecosystem dedicated to providing funding for the exact growth pattern you want to create (seed, angel, VC, late-stage VC, Mutual Funds)  Investment businesses actually require sustainability over rapidity.

startups,3deah5,iamkenrogers,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"As you were starting to describe it my first thought was Jira which I've used for several years myself now at two different companies and many projects. What do you think is the main differences between what you're suggesting and Jira? At my last company we used it just for requirements and bugs, but now at this company we're also using it for task management. In both cases we get instant notification of something being assigned to us and you can add yourself as a ""watcher"" to any item so that you get instant notification over email if any edits are made. It was powerful enough for a company with over 1000 active Jira users, and is scaleable enough for that it's perfectly viable for my current company of less than 10 people.   Not trying to discourage you - just honestly curious how you're different from Jira."
startups,3deah5,malica77,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"Not discouraging at all, this is the kind of feedback I was looking for. I've only had minimal experience with JIRA, so I really wasn't sure if what I was describing was much different.   Here are the main differences I'm thinking in my head, and maybe you can provide some feedback since you seem to have quite a bit of experience with JIRA.   Simpler to use, designed specifically for small development teams where each employee might not be in the same location and might have varying schedules. One of the things I noticed about JIRA is that there is just a ton of stuff. The idea I had would massively simplify this, keeping most of the information developers need on one screen. I'm kind of envisioning a hybrid between Slack and JIRA, where you can see what developers are currently available, and assign a bug to them to fix, they instantly get notified on there end, similar to receiving a message on Slack, and can start working on the bug, add it to their current to do list, etc. This would allow bug fixes to be deployed rapidly for remote teams where members may have varying schedules, without having to wait on a developer who may or may not be available. Being able to choose when you receive and don't receive notifications. For example, maybe you work from 9-12 and 2-6 every day, it would allow you to disable notifications from 12-2 in the afternoon, and have them catch up when you resume work. Strong mobile integration. Another difference I see is that this would integreate with mobile devices, so that if a project manager is away from a computer, and gets a notification about a bug, he gets a push notification and can assign the bug fix to a developer right there. More of a focus on bug fixes, less on task management. I suppose I was a little inaccurate in the post title, but I'm thinking of an app that would be more of a bug monitoring application that a task management application. So new tasks are only created when a bug comes in via the tracker. I haven't thought about this much though, and am wondering if that would require the use of too many tools to do similar things if they do also require general task management."
startups,3deah5,malica77,2,Wed Jul 15 17:42:05 2015 UTC,"1_ Simpler to use, designed specifically for small development teams ...   Jira is as complicated as you want to make it to be. At my previous company with 1000 employees there was rigid workflows and roles defined to make sure people couldn't do things they weren't supposed to. It doesn't at all need to be this complicated though - with my current company (most of us coming from that other company) we decided to keep it as simple as possible; everyone has the same permissions and everyone can do anything - We don't think we'll run into issues with some random developer trying to close an issue without fixing it since there is only one developer so far and we trust him. Jira is very customizable in this regards and really it's only as complex as you want/need it to be. Pretty sure the project manager and IT guy only took a couple of hours one afternoon to install and configure and add all the users so very low overhead there.   If there's a ton of stuff on your screen for jira it's because it was set up that way. Fields can be hidden/removed by the admin.   1_ ... where each employee might not be in the same location and might have varying schedules.    Our current model is hosted on a work server behind a firewall, but all us remote folks connect back to the work server over VPN and then can access Jira. Jira also offers a hosted solution I believe (they host it for you) but due to privacy concerns we opted to host it ourselves.    2_ Being able to choose when you receive and don't receive notifications. For example, maybe you work from 9-12 and 2-6 every day, it would allow you to disable notifications from 12-2 in the afternoon, and have them catch up when you resume work.   With jira everything is just over email. My own personal strategy is to just ignore email when I'm not working and it's sitting there waiting when I come back. In your case what would you see happening to notifications between 12 and 2? Just delivered as a digest at 2pm? Honestly the notification system in Jira could be improved a lot - I get notification about every little change on every defect I'm watching when sometimes the changes are trivial, expected or just not interesting to me. If I could set up my own notification criteria (i.e. email me when some jerk developer tries to lower the priority of the issue, but don't bother me if someone adds themselves to also watch the defect), I'd be happy.    3_ Strong mobile integration.   I'm not sure what Jira's mobile integration was like - I know I could use it well enough through my mobile browser but just tried to stay away from it off-hours. Since most work for each task/item was typically done on a computer, having access to jira away from the computer wasn't a priority to me (except perhaps to view only to check the current status for updates)   3_ ...  so that if a project manager is away from a computer, and gets a notification about a bug, he gets a push notification and can assign the bug fix to a developer right there.   Even small agile development shops don't really need to move that quickly IMHO. But Jira would allow you to auto-assign new bugs to a designated person who would automatically get notification when it's created (again through email). Most teams I worked on had a process to review new issues once a day and at that time decide what the priority of the issue is - and assign to whomever will fix the issue (or to the team, who will then manage dividing up the defects amongst themselves)  Maybe a bit more playing around with Jira will help you figure out what it can do already and if what you're describing is sufficiently different to make a good go of it. Jira is primarily in my mind a bug tracking tool only because that's what we chose to primarily use it for. It's only later we've added requirements tracking and now sprint tracking and to do items."

They might take it in a different direction, but you know the product and its capabilities better than anyone. Show them that."
startups,3ddxjz,deadwavelength,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:20:23 2015 UTC,"A lot of this really hinges on the executive team and angel's ability to make a deal happen. If the failure was in those roles, it seems like you might be in for a bumpy road.   First, your valuation might be wildly lower than you hope, making any payout more of a nice to have than life changing.   My slant on this comes from working in VC and helping on some deals like this.   what's the shortest transition-the-product-to-new-ownership period I can reasonably look for?   This will be a function of the interest level at the acquiring company, and if the deal is sourced from the CxO office or from CorpDev. If it's corpdev, the shortest would be months. If its CxO, it could much quicker, as short as weeks.    Is there typically any short-term payout for acquired employees or will everything be in salary and slow-vesting options?    Again, this depends heavily on the deal structure. First, you need to understand your existing investors and their liquidation preference. Assuming that doesn't eat all the proceeds of the deal, you can expect to get either cash, stock, or a mix of both for your stake in the company. The pay out of this varies in each deal, but it could be anything from you getting a check the day the deal closes to you getting cash over time.  Depending on the deal, you might also be in line for a retention bonus or earn-out. However, in a tech-only play, this is unlikely, since they know the team already is a failure or they wouldn't be at this point. Likely they'd want to keep you on for a transition period, usually 6-12 months.   It is much more rare for a deal like this to have an earn out, since again, the team has failed to prove they can scale and hit benchmarks.   Is there any likelihood of an acquirer being interested in purchasing the product but not its developers?    Yes, but even in this case they'd want the developers to stick around as contractors or bound by some sort of bonus for transition time period. As the key dev, you'd likely be desired to stay around and help them understand the technology.    Assuming I do stick it out as an acquihire, what's the likelihood I'd be allowed to remain in charge of my product vs having to execute on someone else's vision?    This is 100% dependent on the acquirer's plans for the technology and their organization, so its impossible to answer.    When, if ever, is it appropriate for me to ask to be included in negotiations with acquirers?    Unless you are dealing with the operational side of things, you probably shouldn't ever ask to be included in negotiations. You will be likely asked to be included in diligence talks, where you'd be responsible for helping the potential acquirers understand the technology. However, you shouldn't try to insert yourself in the negotiations, just like the CEO shouldn't tell you what data structures to use, etc. Leave it to them and hope that, as a shareholder, they do what is in your best interests. (By all means talk to them and let them know your thoughts and wants.)   Most importantly: how do I best stand up for my own interests here, without being the asshole that ruins the deal for everyone?   You probably can't ruin the deal if you're not on the board and/or don't enough to out vote them on the terms. Your best bet is to be open and honest with what you're hoping for. Keep in mind your company is negotiating from a position of weakness.   Happy to answer any other questions as best I can through PMs also."

startups,3dapu5,wingwingherro,9,Tue Jul 14 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"Another old standard here: http://avc.com/2010/11/employee-equity-how-much/  For a little more insightful comment, just remember that they're likely going to lowball you on cash and promise a bunch of equity. Equity is great, but 90% of the time is worth literally zero (because the company goes out of business, or just because you can't sell it until an acquisition or an IPO). Make sure to get a reasonable salary - whatever reasonable is for your family's situation."
startups,3dapu5,slevin28,7,Tue Jul 14 21:25:36 2015 UTC,"This.  Salary is salary and you should expect and ask for fair market value. Keep in mind most startups won't offer benefits so adjust your salary expectations accordingly (factor in that you may have to purchase your own health insurance).  Working for a startup will typically mean longer hours, higher work loads. Salary is going to be the primary motivation behind the ""why?"" in those first few years when you're pulling yet another all-nighter/weekender or explaining to friends and family why you have to cancel.  Equity is the reward for sticking through that, as /u/slevin28 points out, most startups fail and so most equity is worthless. Worst still, if you take equity in lieu of salary you'll have been busting your tush for years and heavily discounted yourself in the process.  Even making it big is no guarantee of equity value, I consulted at one startup now turned multi-billion dollar company where long time employees were still sticking with horrible working conditions and pay, always working on the promise 'soon' was when they could cash out and leaving meant forfeiting all value."

startups,3dapu5,blakeseven,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:54:35 2015 UTC,"Equity at the beginning of a startup's life is as valuable as you believe it to be. Many take the (often overly) pragmatic approach of saying that it is worthless. It's not. It just doesn't have a MONETARY value until the first round of investment is made (ergo a company valuation is generated). Equity can play a hugely motivational role and that kind of value is exceptionally important for small companies.  So, given that it is worth as much as you believe it to be worth, tell your wife that if she believes the company is a potential unicorn / billion dollar business, then her stake is worth millions.  You sound like practical people so it's doubtful that you'll get carried away by that philosophy.  Good luck to her!"

You'd probably have a better chance winning the lottery.   Here's what I would do: Go search up the average range for her position in a startup (by people, industry) in your city.  Ex. A junior rails developer in Vancouver BC in the tech space is 45-55k.   Highlight her experience and come in at the deep end (I said 55K). The employer would try to get you in the lowest price he can think of. Then you can just get the average of the 2 ranges, your wife and employer mentioned. That is one way.  Do, however, figure out how much you need to support your lifestyle (i.e. if you have any kids and such)."

As far as advice on this specific situation. Ask your group who is interested in working on it full time and if they aren't interested, if they mind if you take over the project. Get them to sign away their rights/interests.   You might need to pay them, if someone actually wants to be a part, have a serious discussion about their roles, expectations and requirements. Talk to a lawyer, do vesting in the startup. See if you can design it in a way that you have majority control and can fire someone for not meeting requirements/deadlines. If they get fired before the vesting cliff, they get nothing. I'm not a lawyer, but there's two options.   Option three could be just use what you personally own the rights to and do it again under a different entity.   I repeat, I'm not a lawyer, check with one about your options."

Put your name right on the front page or cover. You need to sit down with them and go over everything they have contributed, or not contributed. Ultimately, what you need is to get them to sign a release, then go away.  Once this is done, you need to find new partners. It's ok if the people you find do not have programming skills.

IMO, you should have a serious talk with your team and see if they are motivated to pursue this business venture. If they are, then work out a strategy to get them more involved by delegating tasks, teaching them, and ""taking a step back"" once in a while (note: sometimes when you delegate a task, it won't be done as well, but that's a small cost compared to the benefit of gaining a more closely-knit team)  If, by chance, your team doesn't want to work on your company anymore, then you can ask them to leave. No point in them spending time doing something they are not passionate about.  tl;dr If your team is motivated, help them gain the skills. If not, cut them out.

startups,3dbl52,startupstuck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:23:34 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem you will probably face is that software development is expensive and takes a lot longer than a layman expects, because they forget or might not know of a lot of details that seem small but are actually a lot of work. For example i've met many people who seem to forget that if you want to show data in your app it needs to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is usually a backend that also needs to be built. And that backend runs on a server that also needs to be configured.    Also investors usually want to see a minimum viable product before they actually give you money to finish the piece of software. That puts you in an annoying catch 22: You need money to pay a developer to build your MVP, and you fund this you need an investor who wants to see the MVP first.    A way to break out of this circle, is indeed trying to get friends and family to fund the MVP. The problem is that you will need serious money, and if it all blows up your friends and family will probably be upset.  What i would suggest is setting up a LLC (Limited Liability Company) or something similar (i am no expert on this!). When it's set up distribute the equity of the company between your shareholders, and try to find a developer who wants to become a co-founder in your LLC to build your MVP (and expand it later to your full product). In reward for his/her work give him part of the equity of your company. Know that developers like me get these offers all of the time so you really need to show that you are the real deal, and not some bozo with only a dumb idea that he wants to get rich of. There are many ways to meet a developer who's up for something like this. Here on reddit there are several subreddits made for this, and there are also many sites to help you. When you meet a developer you need to really sell yourself; Do not fall in the trap of trying to keep the idea secret, letting them sign NDA's or anything. Show them everything you have and try to reel them in. Try to make them feel excited of your product. Do not be stingy on your equity offer; He/she is the person who is going to take a big risk to build something over the next months for what is basically a lottery ticket.  Got your technical cofounder (as the developer will now be called)? Good! Let him/her build the MVP while the rest of the team should be busy selling the product, and trying to get investors interested. Do not let the technical cofounder get the idea that they're the only ones working, because that's a surefire way to lose him/her. When the MVP is more or less done, show it to investors and get their money for a part of the equity pie, and continue at part 2 of the list of your post."
startups,3dbl52,bukake_attack,2,Wed Jul 15 06:44:17 2015 UTC,"To add, research all upcoming startup tech fairs in your city and university if you decide to look for a developer to join your team in exchange for equity. A face-to-face pitch is valuable experience in any context, and you'll also have the opportunity to speak with potential investors, connectors, end-users, and other entrepreneurs.  While having a working prototype is a plus, it doesn't count for much if your idea tanks with investors. What they really want to see is a company with a captivating pitch, sound business plan, and thorough market segment understanding. I'd focus your efforts on perfecting your actual sales pitch and foreseeing and addressing any potential concerns (competitors, consumer receptiveness, longevity, etc.) Don't focus on making your product perfect, that's what their money is for."

Estimate that it will take you $10,000 to get a nice mobile app built (if you have the $$ and need one built, contact me and I can make some introductions). Pre-seed funding is incredibly unlikely (you're not even at the seed stage) unless you have some good connections and are in a profitable space. What kind of app are you trying to build? Angel List likely won't yield much fruit, but it's free as I recall, so you may as well. The friends and family route is a risk, but it's your call. You don't want to have a stake in people's stakes in your business beyond that you obviously want it to succeed.   The odds are heavily stacked against you to succeed as a college student without a technical co-founder. I suggest you find one. Being in college is a rather significant advantage here, as it shouldn't be too hard to find a comp sci major capable of building your product who is willing to do it for equity."

For me it means a central computer that stores information that the clients (in this case apps) can request or send.  Lets say they want to make a photo sharing app. In the app you have a friendslist, and when you make a picture, the picture gets shared with all your mutual friends. Now as far as i see i this would mean you would need a server to:  1) Store login information. 2) Store who is friends with who. 3) Store the photos. 4) Send the taken photos to people you have in your friendslist who also have you in their friendslist. 5) Keep a record of who has received which photos already, so it won't spam people with the same photo over and over again.

Then have a think about which strategies would make most sense for you, considering your product, your capabilities, and (most importantly) your target market. Choose 3-4 strategies and read even more about them (blog posts, books, etc.). Then, test them properly.   By that, I mean, for example: don't throw in $100 in Facebook advertising to gain Facebook likes. Learn about all the Facebook advertising possibilities (likes, content promotion, conversion-based, click-based, remarketing, custom and lookalike audiences, etc.), read Jon Loomer's blog about Facebook advertising, and then put, say, $15 a day on conversion-based advertising, testing different audiences and testing different ads."
startups,3d9fwz,ricardofayet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:28:38 2015 UTC,"So I got the book and I've got mixed feelings about it.  I like how it's testing oriented. Through ""The Lean Startup"" and ""The Millionaire Fastlane"", I've grown fond of quantifiable growth (and I think investors enjoy these numbers as well.)   However, my qualms are:    So far, it doesn't seem like the author enjoys going into depth on the details. When speaking about Brainstorming, he references the resources. In there, we find a spreadsheet that we're supposed to brainstorm from given only poorly-described columns to work with. It's capital intensive. Ironically so, because testing-oriented systems like this usually come about as a system in order to prevent unnecessary spending. However, he mentions in the book that you should be able to test each channel for no more than a few hundred each.    A few hundred doesn't sound that bad until you spread it across 19 different channels. $200 becomes $3,800, $300 becomes $5,700.  Add that to the cost of developing an MVP and suddenly the process of testing an idea (which should be <$1,000) is almost a $10,000 endeavor!"

That definitely changes the things you need to know to do your job on the business side.   The most important thing is to understand who gets value from your product/service and why. The more technical the audience who gets value is, the more you'd need to be able to speak their language and articulate why your solution is better.   Aside from that, knowing the data that proves your solution is better.

startups,3d80jz,YoungCaesar,4,Tue Jul 14 14:14:44 2015 UTC,"Good question. I had a shitty company for 8 years although I managed to get a great portfolio of customers. I failed at growing it. In any case, when I hit the wall and was super burnt I searched for a job and landed a great job in a consultancy. They actually needed to transform the company through a small disruptive unit, actually a company in the group for which I ended being the CEO. I stayed there around two years and a quarter, made them shitloads of money and then I quit to start another startup where I am still working.  So it depends. If you are applying to IBM it probably hurts, if you are applying to another startup, consultancy or more modern company it will help. They will balance your entrepreneur half vs your valuable creative employee half and then they will hire you knowing that you might jump ships in two years, but in the meantime you will get a lot done fast."

startups,3dct0p,amosschorr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:06:58 2015 UTC,"It doesn't end piracy, it gives existing pirates a way to pay off their content (by supplying content that they can prove is identical, which is authenticated by the network, to customers who have paid for it). It makes money from customers buying that content, plain and simple. Part of the money from the purchase is held by my company- this goes to paying overhead, salaries, hosting, etc- and part of it is allocated to pay to the people doing the uploading, at some pre-determined ratio (for the sake of argument, uploading a song that costs a dollar on iTunes would be worth 10 cents for a complete/verified upload from a person who had that song legally, or 10 cents would go to paying off the content that a pirate with the same song uploaded).   edit Just so this is clear, the rest of the money goes to the content rights holder- the person or entity which legally holds the right to make money from the intellectual property distributed on this network.  Currently, the plan is to have an 80/10/10 split, 80 going to the rights holder, 10 held, and 10 for the uploaders.  However, I'm not married to this ratio- I just think this is what would be competitive, given the nature of other distribution systems that already exist (Steam, iTunes store, etc), and because these networks are also well established, they're also a native target market. I'm making this, from the ground up, to also work as a b2b solution for them, if they want to use it.  /edit  As far as me being a good programmer- look, I know I'm not a complete idiot, but I've never worked on a group project with other people. I've read lots of code, and I get it, and I am getting better very rapidly now that I'm on this full time, and I know I'll get there- but I just want to get there in time to have a stable product that can handle the holiday season at the end of this year, and I'm really worried about getting there in time."

I have a content store. I sell content through it.

They'd need a reason to give you some kind of a price break or even read your goddamn email, and it's hard to imagine you being able to provide one. And at the scale you'd be operating at, I don't think they'd see much value.  Your strategy effectively relies entirely on organic growth using only user-contributed content to gain a critical mass of users that you could then use to get licensing deals and grow it for real. But the issue is that critical mass is fairly large, and you're going to try to compete with a lot of established businesses that are more specialized (and therefore better at what they do) than you are. So that critical mass is going to be nearly impossible to reach."

You've heard of youtube and instagram for this. I'm not trying to be them- don't conflate that reference for that- but this is an attempt to build a better mousetrap, and this- the whole thing- is literally step one. This is groundwork that needs to be laid.  The other stuff that gets built on top is where this goes from being cutesy bullshit that scrapes by to making more serious amounts of money- so this needs to get to the point where it pays for itself, and then it can get bigger and do fun stuff- but it isn't limited by this.

All good points I've long since covered.  The first iteration of this- I think this would have been around 2008- was intended for ebooks.  I looked around, decided I could adapt more of it to suit the stuff I saw around me at the time (I was living in Thailand, and didn't have any legal software- it just wasn't even available) and so this is what I came up with as being able to compete.  So video, music, and games where there's something you need to have on your local machine- which is, I think, almost all of them- can be distributed by this.   Are you seriously trying to tell me you actually believe you're going to get licensing deals from anything approaching a major company?    Look, I'm not even trying. Balls out, I don't give a shit. There are enough content creators out there looking for small scale money to start that I'm not going to give a shit about companies that are terrible for me to work with- because I want to make money, and that won't let me, for reasons you're rightly pointing out.    Writers are my favorite examples, usually. You can self-publish, but then all the risk is on you.  You can give away ebooks, but then they get spread around everywhere.  Or you can go the traditional publishing route, and they'll make most of the money, even though it's your book.  So there's an open market, as far as I can tell.  So that's a field that's wide open to being undercut by a system like this.  But the numbers are really compelling on this side of things, too. There are between 5 and 6 billion people on the internet- only about 2 billion of them participate in any sort of online economy.  The idea isn't to start with the biggest fish in the pond, because, as you're pointing out, sharks have teeth- It's to start with the plankton.  And, just so this is clear, you're making excellent points, and these are things I thought long and hard about- and started thinking about 10 years ago.  I've got a viable path forward that accounts for these objections and many others you haven't voiced, and I'm building it.  If you want to come along, and you have some way to contribute, you're invited.  But I'm not going to sweat it if you (or anybody else) thinks I can't do this.

On AWS the marginal cost of storage is $0.03 per GB per month and the marginal cost of sending data to the Internet is $0.09 per GB.  So you could pay something like $0.0003 to someone who uploads an MP3 of a song or maybe $0.09 for a 1 GB movie.  Since the cost of the IP ($1 for a song or $10 for a movie) will dwarf the data costs there can't be enough volume to incentivize uploaders to upload IMO."

Let's say you need the following (the numbers are all made up):   Network Equipment - Can service 500 domains - $3000 Big Server - Can handle 1000 domains - $5000  Big Database - Can handle 1000 domains - $5000 IT guru - $150k/year (with benefits) - can manage everything for you. You can estimate a per domain cost here too - let's say 10,000  so thats another $15 / domain / year    Total for 1000 domains:    Hardware: $16k or $16/domain name  Staff: $15 / domain   You can go down a list like this, and then get a sense of the costs per domain. You can use this to set your pricing, validate if your idea is economically feasible, and all that good stuff. Build in some margin too!

Is it an S/C-corp where you own 10% of the equity?   Its important to understand what the terminology entails. For example, if you start out owning 10% of the corporation's equity and then they bring on another shareholder, does your position get diluted?   Additionally, who makes the decision on profit/loss? Let's say the costs of running the business are $100k, and the business is looking to make $500k revenue. The majority shareholder decides that its worthwhile to run a $400k marketing campaign, making the business profit $0.   Finally, a word of caution: Past performance is not indicative of future results. It is hard to know if it was his product genius, business sense, timing, or maybe something his partners added that caused the success of his former businesses. They could be in totally different industries, so his contacts might not translate.   Without the specifics of the deal and your role in the venture, it is hard to say if this is a rocketship you have to get on or a classic tale of getting paid below market rate and abused by a family member with the hopes of making it big.   So here's some things I'd ask:   What's the structure of the 10% ? Could he match your current salary, since $8k is probably very little to him if he's spending lots of cash?

startups,3d6muh,bdo11,7,Tue Jul 14 21:36:17 2015 UTC,"I work at a startup and here are a few pointers (When it comes to equity) that I wish I knew when I got started:  The goal here is to secure your equity and get the lowest tax rate when you cash it in. You want to structure your ownership correctly (to get your millions). You want to establish it upfront, in writing. If he says he isn't a believer in documents, you decide.    Ask for NSO (non-qualified stock option) and early exercise rights. This gives you the option to buy your 10% at the share price when you joined (should be close to $0).  Then file form 83(b) Election within 30 days. When you sell your 10%, this form will qualify your proceeds from the sale as a long-term capital gains income, so you will only pay 15% tax on it.  If exercising (buying your 10%) is too much money for you, ask for a signup bonus equal to the value of your stock options.    While this is not an easy thing to ask for, but think of steps 1-3 as a way for you to show that you are all in. You can still get screwed (dilution, preferred stock terms, debts), but doing steps 1-3 is easy and very important.   As for joining ths company, you already know what you should do! Good luck!"
startups,3d6muh,SoMuchArt,5,Mon Jul 13 23:32:43 2015 UTC,"Two of these points are partially correct, but partially wrong.    ISO > NSO, generally.   83b elections have nothing to do with long term capital gains, but rather the way you are taxed as your stock (not options) vests.  Early exercise can potentially help get long term capital gain treatment.   Nothing wrong with asking for a bonus equal to the exercise price; as an alternative the company can simply give you the stock, and you'd be taxed on the value of the stock (assuming you file the 83b election).   Disclaimer - I'm not your lawyer; talk to a lawyer."
startups,3d6muh,LukeFitzpatrick,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:33:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you know more than me. I just want to pick your brain, I am not arguing:   ISO > NSO, generally.   If you have ISO and your company sells in less than two years, you will have to pay tax on the value of the stock the date the stock vested. ISO must be held for 1 year from the date of exercise and two years from the day of the option grant. What are the benefits of ISO over NSO?   When you file 83b election, you are preventing this scenario: Common stock is high(fair market value), restricted stock was sold to you low. The IRS wants to tax you on the difference between FMV of common stock and restricted stock. If you file 83b election, your common stock price=your restricted stock price, as far as IRS is concerned."
startups,3d6muh,KingOfDaCastle,3,Tue Jul 14 05:19:52 2015 UTC,"No problem - sorry if I came across as terse; I was replying on a phone on a plane, and just wanted to make some clarifications.  Thanks for contributing to our community; you certainly don't have to be an expert to be helpful.  ISO is better than an NSO (at least for the employee receiving it), because it is like an NSO with superior tax treatment, and if it fails to meet all the tests (like the holding period test you mentioned), it automatically becomes an NSO.    The NSO tax problem (which ISOs don't have  isn't at each vesting date, but rather at the date you exercise your NSO.  There are some good resources to read; here's a decent summary: http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2008/03/05/whats-the-difference-between-an-iso-and-an-nso/  83b elections are what prevent you from being taxed at each vesting date, and it only applies to stock (or options that are exercised early), not options.  Instead of being taxed at each vesting date, you're taxed up front.  With startups, the value of the stock is much lower up front (hopefully), compared to when the stock vests, so it's generally better to be taxed up front.  Here's one of the many summaries of 83b filings.  Best of luck!  Standard disqualifier:  I'm not your attorney, and this isn't intended as legal advice."

You should feel... not much. Having competition comes with good and bad. There's someone else to take your customers, but their marketing will grow your market. There's someone who might steal your secrets, but you can get information from them.  As for things you should do differently, you asked about patents. I don't know what country you're in, but at least in the US, all you have to do is used your thing in public before the patent was filed and you would be safe.  Other than that, do try to learn what you can. Who are their customers? Why are they customers? What problem is your competitor solving for them? How could it be solved better by you?  Sourcing people for those kind of interviews, and figure out what questions to ask can both be kind of daunting if you've not done it before. If you want to chat more about it, just PM me."

CJ is literally the largest affiliate network on the planet.  yet the incredible majority of deals either have no data, or the eCPC is dismally bad.  how does that happen?  the reality is that it's still an attention economy.  the bulk of digital ad spend is CPM, followed by CPC.  CPA is barely on the map.  between adsense and ad exchanges, anyone who has any ad inventory worth anything sells it there.  not through CJ or other affiliate channels.  on top of that, most publishers flat out won't trust you to implement it correctly unless you're one of those gigantic global brands with an army of engineers to make sure it actually works.  end result is that you get the worst inventory that they can't even sell on adsense or adx.  expect ultra-low conversion rates, if any at all."

startups,3d6zyx,whatsupanders,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"You should start off by making all your customers affiliates automatically when they sign up. Make sure you give them an affiliate link that gives people they give it to a discount too. e.g. £10 discount to buyers, £20 to the affiliate or whatever your price points are.  Your customers should be your biggest evangelists, especially for you since you'll have a bunch of website-developers as your customers amongst the many end-user customers you have. Your website developer customers will be very happy to run an affiliate program for you if your system is good.  Don't pay for CJ - waste of time - if you're using a CMS of any decent quality there will be an affiliates plugin you can get, but if you have to code it yourself it's not really that complicated. CJ and their ilk charge a significant up-front fee (I think £400) and they also take a big chunk of the affiliate commission (I think about 35%)."

You're going to end up with a collection of headphone shots that are not standardized, are of varying quality, in different poses, lighting, etc.   It will look like you just randomly grabbed pictures off the internet.  I'd instead go with the top 2-3 brands, either by popularity or name recognition and create professional custom product shoots that you can then replicate and expand with additional brands later.  Lets say the product shot is Beats for instance and the photo doesn't change unless you pick a brand you do have a picture for.   The idea is to show off the most enticing imagery rather than showing an unprofessional mish-mash of imagery to prove 'look we can scrape google images'.  The customer photo idea is great, it helps engagement and building trust with other potential customers, but keep in mind the sites that do this also have professional product shots for a reason."

startups,3d4qvr,Hassviper3,11,Mon Jul 13 15:31:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a business to business salesman in NYC during the day and a wantrepreneur the rest of the time. I have one failed startup (www.zaloot.com).   Right now I'm working on a new idea and have an app almost ready for launch.   I'm looking for a technical co-founder that has a strong mobile programming background. I know that most developers are wary of teaming up with someone non-technical, so here is what I've done so far, I hope you think I'm someone you'd like to work with:   1. I built out the basic framework for android myself.  I tried to learn programming and was able to get pretty far, but quickly hit some obstacles that I couldn't overcome in a timely manner.   2. I've hired contractors to do a lot of the work already.  I have working iOS and android prototypes. This was not easy to accomplish, I hired them on Odesk and had to really challenge myself to manage them. I had to give them a lot of the logic for the app. It also put a dent in my pocket, but it was worth it to make my vision a reality.   3. I put together really good project plans.  This was key to succeeding with overseas contractors. I had to put together really good plans to build out the app. I couldn't just give them my vision and tell them to create it.     What I need a co-founder to help with:  1. iOS development  My android developer has been great, and all that's left is one final round (hopefully) of bug fixes.   The iOS build is another story. The iOS developer was bad, and after a lot of missed deadlines I had to part ways. I am looking for a new iOS developer. Right now the plan is to hire a contractor, but if I can find someone to partner with to do the iOS version themselves, that would be a dream come true.   The iOS build is allegedly 75% complete. Most of the screens are completed (with bugs). The iOS and android version share a parse backend, and most features have been integrated. If you can bring this home, that would be great.   2. fbinfer  I'm enamored with this. I have no idea if it works as advertised, but I'd love to have the builds run through fbinfer before launching.   3. App store preparation  I've read some horror stories about Apps getting pulled from the app & play stores, and want to make sure I don't make the same mistake.   4. Additional features after launch  I have a laundry list of features I'd like to add, and would love to have someone focused on building that out. If you can build iOS and backend (parse/javascript) while managing the android developer that would be ideal.   While you focus on that, I would focus on user acquisition. I have a marketing plan that will require all of my free time to execute.   5. Finish the website  I have a wordpress site I built using a theme I bought, but I want to make some changes. I can handle this, but if you'd like to do it I would be happy to step aside.     I didn't include my idea, not because of fear of theft, but because I want someone to join me for me, not for my idea. I know that this is a developer's market, and that most devs are hesitant to work with non-technical folks, especially only for equity. I've seen the ""you want me to do all the work for half the credit"" line a lot in the programming world, with good reason.   I want to partner with someone that doesn't have that attitude towards me and thinks I'm the kind of person they'd like to work with, a non-technical guy with technical understanding.   I'd rather not put my contact information in the open, so PM me for it. If you're in the NY/NJ area, I'd love to meet up person. I'll pay.   Finally, I know it's not market value in the U.S., but I have a budget of  $500 for the remainder of the iOS work (that's why I usually post on odesk/upwork to hire overseas contractors). I'd be happy to pay you to finish the iOS build as a trial run to find out if we could work well together.   Thanks,"

I developed the prototype out of my house, originally for my own injury.

This turned out to be a hybrid of the ""supine"" position I mentioned above and the ""zero gravity"" position that every retailer has been bastardizing. Most are getting it wrong.

I believe there's more than enough room for 2-3 price point levels of product, while staying under $1k.     I'm looking for a front end developer that can handle a little back end as well. At least some of the below capabilities:     *SEO / SEM. *Content Management Systems. *Wiki dev & management. *Product Development *CRM  I have been learning to code myself over the last several months, but my coding skills haven't yet caught up with my product development.  I'm currently not planning on financing inventory, as I'd prefer to kickstart.   A little background on me. I'm a mid-career changer as of a few years ago, from about a decade spent as a special operations targeting officer for the dept of defense and marine corps. I started a real estate business on the side after the bubble popped in '09 (pre-foreclosure residential), and after a couple years had enough success to go full time.     I've caught the web dev bug too, which is why I'd like to parlay the product into a community. I.could see the product maturing into a modular custumized build, with video instructions for assembly.     I want to change the way we look at working in front of a computer all day. And if I could build an online community like /r/battlestations but for variations and iterations of our product, I'd be tickled pink.     Forgive the typos. This is a post via phone.

startups,3d4qvr,CJ_Rockstar,3,Tue Jul 14 00:23:05 2015 UTC,"Hello /r/ startups!  The Idea   GURU is a social platform that connects people who want help with people who want TO help. Our goal is to connect users within their defined network, streamline communication, and enrich the mentor/mentee experience through our platform. Guru leverages personal demographic information and common interests to identify likely connections between mentees and mentors. Guru's value add for mentors is that they can give back to their community without all of the red tape encompassing traditional mentoring programs. For mentees, the value add is simple: access to all of the pooled experiences of the mentors in your network at the click of a button.    We've set up a preliminary landing page in which you can check out the concept at www.enterguru.com   Team Background Information  The team consists of myself, a Pennsylvania native who just moved to NC after completing a ~3 year stint working in finance in NYC. I'll be handling general execution, business planning, and marketing. My co-founder, a NY based MIT graduate with an finance and engineering background, who will be handling the analytics and also plays a key part general execution and fundraising. The last member of the team is mobile and web designer who will be handling exactly that. We recently had found two undergraduates from MIT who were interested in the project and had offered them the role as CTO with compensation in the form of equity. We had spent 6 months working with them but eventually split as they weren't able to dedicate the amount of time required by the project.   Since then we've fully flushed out our design and have compeleted a whole mockup of the product (which I'd be more than happy to share should you be interested). Established our go-to-market strategy in terms of an MVP and have been actively searching for our next CTO. We've recently been in talks with a contractor to have the MVP built and have bootstrapped the cash to pull that together.  What We're Looking For   iOS and Android mobile app developer who can write clean and efficient code.   If you're not interested in joining the team but interested in the idea we'd love to hear feedback on the idea and how we can improve the concept.   Please feel free to leave a comment below, pm me, or leave an email address so we can set up a time to speak on google hangout.   Thanks everyone!"

startups,3d4qvr,Cbitezvagoo,3,Mon Jul 13 21:13:31 2015 UTC,"Hello Reddit! I am a cofounder of Hexolve, which is a web platform (still in the early works) for the gaming community based around networking and crowdfunding, among other things to give people a positive experience and to push forward creativity and collaborations.   At this moment, we are looking for another technical cofounder that is experienced in web design and UX design. Someone who knows the in's and out's of making and maintaining an elegant design and coming up with positive new ideas on the front-end.  Let me give you more information (a snippet of a piece marketing created) about the site and what we are trying to accomplish.   What is Hexolve Hexolve is a community based website with a focus on games, development, and creativity. Hexolve will be a place where artists, programmers, developers, and gamers of all kinds can get together and thrive. Communication between creators and players will be constant and feedback will always be readily available. The key to making this site work is you, the community.  What sets Hexolve apart?  The leading benefit of Hexolve is the funding option. This function is what the site was built around, it allows people with great ideas to be noticed, with an intuitive voting system that allows the gaming community to finally have a say in what they want to see created. Our final goal here at Hexolve is for someone with a really awesome video game idea see their ideas get noticed, and have the community vote to get them to the top. Once there, Hexolve will fund, market, and develop your game with YOU, the creator and the gamer working with us every step of the way. After all, we love games too. We want to have a part in giving back to the gaming community!  So, if I want my game idea to take off, I need to get it voted on first?  Not necessarily! Here at Hexolve we believe in aiding the creative process, so in line with our beliefs using our voting system is not the only way for you to see success in the creation of your game. We are providing the platform for you to find all the key components of the team you need to create your game. Additionally, you will be able to easily manage the creative process of your game, receive optional funding from gamers that want to see your game made a reality, and market the progress of your game within the community of Hexolve. We will give you a project page that you can share and update­­ so that you can take matters into your own hands if you prefer!  Sounds great! One problem. I don’t have any ideas for a game, I’m not a programmer, artist, nor am I looking to develop. I just want to play games! Your site is great, just not for me.  We have designed Hexolve to be for everyone. We are not just here for the developers, we are also here for the players. Without the people who are passionate about playing games, we wouldn’t have a website. Upon signing up to Hexolve you can customize your profile, adding games you frequently play to your profile will allow you to meet other people with similar interests! We will have a forum board for discussion, and you will have plenty of opportunities to beta test some great games! Based on the games you have liked, we will make recommendations for you so you can always been on the cusp of the newest games! We plan to implement social media features such as private messaging and comments. Additionally there will be an entire part of Hexolve geared towards guides, walkthroughs, and cheats. These are just a few of the big ideas we have so far at Hexolve to keep you fully immersed in the community and meet other people who share your love of gaming!  Additional Launch Features   The Create a Project page: Team List, Picture updates of story boards/etc, About the Game, Goals for the Game, Updates, Apply, Like, Fund, Share, Hexboard and Group Message Buttons, and “If You Like These Games.... You Might be Interested in this game as well!” The Discussion Boards: A place for discussion about programming, game creation, feedback, and for gamers to get together and discuss games they love! This will include Official Forums and Unofficial Forums. Hexboard: This is a creative and designing workspace. It will allow you and the members of your team to get together and chat about your progress and goals, and having the ability alter the board in real time. It is brainstorming and progress boards, it is your calendar, it is your goal list, it is everything you need to organize and present your progress to each other. Creating A Profile: Options for developers to set status to “no longer accepting projects” or “ready to accept projects”, adding games you like, profile photos, things you have worked on previously, badges based on things you have involved yourself in within the Hexolve community!   Future Goal Features   Group pages for niche gaming communities to get together and discuss gaming tips and news. Events (limited 1 per day per person, to prevent spamming) invite your friends for an unofficial championship round of your favorite game, create challenges and send them to your friends! Team building: the option to display and submit your team into events and group message among your team. Twitch/youtube widget to your profile, for streaming etc.   Now obviously this is a big undertaking and once we have a suitable landing page for people to sign up to keep updated on the progress via email, we hope this idea will inspire more people to help us in the creation of the website. Another key feature not mentioned and one many other redditors wanted to see is the ability to use this platform for all forms of entertainment, which was already a goal in mind. So we want to use this for people that love film, comics, novels, etc. Anyway, we've hit some road blocks since we've started. If anyone likes this idea and has experience in UX design or front end design, please PM me and we can discuss matters further. We're also looking into other routes to getting funded(Our first goal is to hit $100,000) so we can afford all initial startup expenses."

startups,3d4qvr,friendsable,2,Tue Jul 14 01:29:27 2015 UTC,"I am currently working on a social app It's called Friendsable.   The idea:  A social networking app aimed at helping people meet and make new friends. This app is specifically targeted at people like me who find it hard to make friends since the left college. Friendsable uses your location to match you with nearby people based on your interests. If two people share two or more interests you both get a notification when you are nearby. The app further encourages people meeting by rewarding them with points, nudging them with points, and offering icebreakers.  What I have done:  I just started working on this app a month ago, so I am in the early stages. At this time I have validated the idea by presenting an MVP (build as an HTML app for Android) to various people. The people I showed it to were from various background: Friends & Family first, Friends of Friends through Facebook, and finally some true testing done through a landing page I had up, which linked to the MVP.  Survey results: Out of a total 5000 users surveyed: 78% Said they were looking for an app like this and would use it on a regular basis (every other day) 10% Said they would use it once and a while, 5% said they would use it as long as it notified them and they didn't have to think about it and 7% said they had no use for it.  I have more details about demographics that I can share with anyone who joins up.  What I am looking for:  I am looking for either an Android and iOS developer OR Someone who knows Xamarin and can use that for cross-platform development.  You would be a Co-Founder and receive equity.  You would be responsible for developing the app and backend systems. I will provide servers and cover all early on expenses.  My Background:  I have started and helped start many businesses. Some very small and some have become a decent size and went on to get VC.  My tech skills are in the IT & Pentesting/Security Research side of things. All of my development skills are based around what I need to know for Pentesting, so I may not be able to design the most pretty thing, but I can read and understand code. I also fully understand what developers need to get their work done, you wont  get unreasonable deadlines/tasks from me. I have freelanced for years and know how that feels.  Comment or PM me. :)"

But along with incorporation comes a lot of compliance related activity, and this is where you'll need expert advice. If, however, you just want to run a small business or even test a few ideas out, then sole proprietorship is sufficient, although you take on more personal risk. Sole proprietorship is faster."

Otherwise if it's a high growth startup go with clerky(which will set you up with a c corp which makes life easier for investors).   I would suggest starting with an LLC from a local lawyer, then if things get serious just create a new corp with clerky.

You can't just have a single database backend, you have to use clusters, you have to have front end load balancers, servers just for login, servers for accounting... how will you prevent cheating?

If sales revenue could both pay the remainder of the purchase price and give the company the capital it needs to grow, why would you sell? Additionally, having several other revenue producing businesses would mean even less incentive to take the cash out now.   Secondly, you list the assets that the business has - but do you really value those at whatever price you agreed to? Wouldn't it be more effective to hire someone who could build out artwork and the social network, use off the shelf website and inventory controls,  and not pay a markup over the cost of these things?  Third, what are you actually buying? Is the company incorporated and you're purchasing 100% of the shares? What about any debts the company has? How about other liabilities?

The business and all of the assets (website, social media, inventory, etc.) were listed for sale on flippa.com, but the auction ended without a sale. The auction listing was pretty explicit in what is to be included in the sale, and from a monetary standpoint it seemed to be an incredible deal (but not too good to be true!)   The major appeal for me is that everything is already set up and taken care of, it would just be taking over and growing the business from where it is now. I work a full-time, Monday-Friday job, so although I've considered starting something from scratch, I just honestly don't have the time (or energy, probably). Plus, I can see ""paralysis by analysis"" tripping me up every step of the way.

I suggest reading ""The Lean Startup"" by Eric Ries and the chapter he talks about minimum viable product (I'm sure lots of people on this sub have read it).  But, in summary, you won't be able to focus on something entirely if you are going to be leading a startup. No startup succeeds alone. That doesn't mean that you are not valuable.

startups,3d2blv,BastardOfDriftmark,9,Sun Jul 12 23:23:32 2015 UTC,"My standard advice (which has been confirmed by every developer I've ever talked to): Build a wireframe before you look for a developer. Most won't seriously consider your idea without some kind of visual aid.  Events are the best places to meet people. Developers these days often aren't the asocial basement-dwellers they're portrayed as. Smart developers who freelance or look for startups to work with network a lot. Meetup is a great place. If there's an Impact Hub near you, they run events you could check out."

First You Must Do These Things 1). Do customer discovery  2). Build detailed wire frames (it doesn't have to be fully functional or designed well) think low fidelity, but detailing the functionality as thoroughly as possible based on your customer discovery calls. (These will change a lot between now & actual build time b 3). Write a detailed scope of work describing as much as you possibly can on the program & how it will work.  (Will change a lot between now & build time) 4). Research & decide what language you want to use for the back end. Be thoughtful on this b/c it will continue to show the programmer that you've done your homework.   Then You Can Do These Things 5). Go on GitHub & search for active members who've posted &/or contributed to projects in the language you want the program written & with similar functionality.  6). If they have a site/blog or whatever READ IT. Get familiar with their work.  7). Request a BRIEF phone call ""regarding your project which shares some similarities with this other project they did which you loved reading about in their blog."" BE SINCERE!  Don't expect an answer right away. These people are on a makers schedule. Midday meetings/emails mess their flow up.  8). Don't ask them to sign an NDA/NC for showing them the idea.  9). Let them play deviled advocate on the call & poke holes in your idea if they want. Don't be defensive & show them that you've done your research. Or be honest & tell them that you don't know the answer to their question, but you're working to figure it all out.   Chances are that if they're active & good at their craft they'll be too busy to help you or they'll cost more than you want to pay.  However, they will respect the leg work you've put in & your ability to be honest about what you don't know.   In turn they may be able to recommend someone with more availability or with a lower rate or they may be willing to help you vet potential programmers as long as you limit the time to do so.

One was to have the landing page I built be mobile responsive and the other was to build the front end of my mvp. In both cases I had a lot for the devs to go off of. I used proto.io to build the mvp. It allows you to build the site like it should behave.   When negotiating how much, you should have an idea of how much you're willing to spend. Also, I find it easier to price things in terms of project costs and not by the hour. Payment I do through PayPal and usually work at a 25% down, with 3 milestones for the remaining 75%. Most devs have been ok with this. I actually ended up giving The guy who did my backend an extra 50% because his communication and work were unreal.  I don't recommend elance as you get bombarded with offers. For small gigs you can try Fiverr. It won't cost $5, but the platform is nice to find someone for quick fixes. Also checkout sevendays.co.

startups,3d0xvl,TheDicktator,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:03:13 2015 UTC,"I think the product/market fit for that thread isn't quite there yet :P  On a more serious note, I think the reddit algorithm has some nepotism for older comments on threads as opposed to newer ones, and therefore having a monthly thread discourages people from wanting to post in that thread. Which is fair because realistically, that comment probably won't be seen.  Of course, given how passionate everyone is about what they're doing, they still want to post about it somewhere, which is why you see stuff leaking outside that thread. I think if it was a weekly thing, not only would people be a lot more likely to just post it there the community might also prefer that this not leak out of that thread so that we can stick to more interesting discussions."

startups,3d2nnl,adamrcarmack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:29:58 2015 UTC,"Kickstarter is awesome. But it isn't a one-stop-shop for promotion and fundraising. You need to invest in Kickstarter to get a good return. You need interest first. Start making stuff with it, share it with people, make videos, etc etc and get your friends to spread it. Once there's some interest in it, spend 500-1000 bucks on a high quality video to use for Kickstarter.  EDIT: I'd also price your product higher btw. At least $250-350 (and I'd go closer to $500). If your product is as good as you say, people will be MORE than happy to pay for it. It's great if you want to do a service for people and sell it cheap, but people will assume it's shit if it's that cheap. And having a higher price will free you up to give several tiers of early bird prices on your Kickstarter campaign.  Another important thing to remember about Kickstarter is milestones. The most successful campaigns have a ton of great milestones to incentivize people to buy and get their friends to buy. Make milestones past what you expect you'll make and keep some in the wings to keep adding to.  EDIT2: there's an article I was looking for that compared the Kickstarter campaigns for the Castlevania and Planescape: Torment sequels (this was before the Castlevania campaign ended). Castlevania ended up making more, and it also hit the $1MM milestone quicker. Both campaigns got far more than they expected to, and the article postulated that was due to how the Torment team obviously didn't plan for the immense success and stopped releasing milestone incentives while Castlevania kept adding more and more to keep people interested and make a late surge."

Be warned, that having a working prototype and going to manufacturing are two VERY different situations.  We were in a similar boat a few years back, a new product using new technology which resulted in a substantial cost reduction from commercial solutions.  We built a proto, and did the Kickstarter thing. We raised ~$80K and with that exposure managed to raise a few more hundred thousand of investment capital.   We then tried to build a few hundred of these things (ourselves) and soon discovered its not that simple... ~3/4 of a million later and at roughly ~2x loss on kickstarter units and we are going to be FINALLY going into REAL REAL production next month (for a Kickstarter campaign that ran in 2013.)  Hardware is NOT software, and if your truly doing something new and unique contract manufacturing is very very dangerous.  **Plan for your first batch to cost ~2 times your projection and plan for them to take three times as long. **  Use crowd sourcing to show market validation but expect your going to have to pour a hell of a lot more cash into it, get as many credit cards as you can NOW, get as large a line of credit as you can NOW, start lining up outside sources of funding NOW, get the ball rolling on all the government grants you can NOW.

startups,3d3dka,danmay,3,Mon Jul 13 05:00:37 2015 UTC,"If you are a ph.d student, you are likely employed by your institution.  As part of your employment contract or as the result of your employment contract incorporating a bunch of other sections about intellectual property, it is likely that you agreed to assign any intellectual property that you created.  First, you probably agreed to assign any IP that results from the use of university facilities.  Separately, you also probably agreed to assign any intellectual property that results from university sponsored programs or research projects.  As a result, you (and your fellow Ph.D.s) probably assigned the ownership of the intellectual property to your employer, the university.  You should talk to your university tech transfer office about licensing the technology to a startup company that you create.  Ask for terms similar to those found in the North Carolina Express License (Just Google it). That way, the university gets to say it created a startup, you get the technology usage rights, and the university only gets 70 percent of the 5 to 10 percent that you pay in royalties to it.  As inventors, you can get 30% of the 5 to 10 percent that you pay, and also use the university's expertise.  It's a win-win all around.    Additionally, don't underestimate your university tech transfer or licensing office's employees.  Your university tech transfer and licensing officers are there to help you patent, setup your company, and help you commercialize the tech.  Most of them are very helpful with finding investors and grants.  Due to their experience with many different technologies most of them will have a better idea about the monetary value of the technology and market potential than your team will.      Despite this, do not sign anything and do not agree to file an invention disclosure until after you have the discussion about licensing to your startup."

I know it's wacky, but if you take an entry-level coding job (after learning the basics yourself), you will be mentored and guided by people who know what they're doing.  Pick a hot framework like Ruby on Rails, learn to build basic webapps from tutorials and then take an entry level job for 6 months and see where it takes you.  After 6 months of study and practice, if you haven't burnt out, you can probably move (or take a promotion) to an ""intermediate"" level and always be sure you're somewhere that has some helpful senior-level developers and regular reviews (or even pair-programming to start).

Unlike virus scanners though security if I had some specific requirement of compliance to meet then I can find products that are geared towards those specifically. eg ISO27001 flavour of FISMA with the review processes etc.  The core tech may do this now, its just a matter of how it is presented (and checking that it can). You dont even need to do 100% of the compliance you can 'contribute' to a compliance.

Whether it's a month free, or a 15% discount, or whatever, that will help you maximize conversions. (EDIT: I see that it's in beta now and is currently free, but presumably won't be when you do a full launch. So I'd suggest offering a code for a month or two free when it DOES launch to PH users.)  Use that additional traffic and hype to boost everything else. Tweet the shit out of this, posted on facebook, reach out to startup news sites, everything. Make sure you use being featured on PH to the fullest.  Also, you should make a ""featured on Product Hunt"" thing for your website. It's kind of like putting a gold star on your own forehead for being a good boy, but this kind of stuff does work.  Then you should add a ""press"" section to your website. I know the landing page is really basic (very nice though) and it might stick out, but if you're starting to get mentioned in several publications and blogs, it's worth finding a way to integrate it. To make it look less weird, I'd suggest adding a menu bar to your website. Add an ""about"" section so you can have your mission statement, info about the team, and a press section. I know you're in beta, but that's the best time to start testing these things."

If so then sure I do it. The company could grow to become a powerful force for good and will inevitably help customers on the way up. We have also assumed away the down side.  The problem is you can't really assume away risk and the money issue and still have the same startup. People might do the same thing but only spend 10% of the time on it.

It's possible that your failure rate might be with the way you're treating your startup or developers. If you get another one I would ensure you're   1) consistently hitting small milestones to establish a sense of personal accomplishment among the team. Grinding away on a list of features for months in the shadows gets old and doesn't provide any motivation  2) paying your team well enough to keep them focused short term. Most people would rather have fun tonight rather than work on something with a1% chance of making them some money.  3) catching personality conflicts early and actively managing the project. Most developers need constant reminders of what's outstanding and why it's critical to get it done right now  Again, you might be doing these things, but figured I'd offer up another POV. As far as learning software development, absolutely do it. I wouldn't count on you being your own lead developer though. You'll be 5+ years before you're even sniffing the capability to be the lead engineer/tech arch that you want in charge of your shit.

Now that that's out of the way, it's not entirely a bad thing. They sound more like dead weight than developers in regards to your project and hopefully your situation allows you to bring in some new blood. I would not suggest you build it yourself anymore than I would suggest you build your own house. Find someone you can properly motivate to see the idea though (if its worth doing).

But that's nothing compared to the real issue, which is that you'd have to have enough cash on hand to reimburse everyone according to their level.  A better idea is some kind of browser plug-in that you can activate on ecommerce sites that will find you the same product for a lower price so you don't overpay initially. Your service is reactive; this is proactive. If I'm not mistaken, something similar is in the works, but I can't remember the name.  EDIT: there's a good chance people wouldn't really redeem this for minor purchases, but they also wouldn't be very likely to buy a policy for smaller items. And if the payout is commensurate with the level subscription you have, I just don't see the appeal for someone who just wants to buy some tchotchkes on amazon. If you're targeting bigger ticket items, that makes some sense, but that will also be a very volatile market, and you'll have to do some SERIOUS number crunching just to set a pricing model."

Putting myself in the subscriber's view, I thought ""how is this different from a regular savings account?"" to this very minute, I can't really think of what actual value it'd bring if the reimbursement level was commensurate with the subscription cost. I also can't think of a way I would be making money; I originally thought of adding an agreement like ""I do not plan on using this for 30 days"" and invest in something that protects the principal yet pay interests, like a cashable gic. However with the crappy interest rate, I don't know.  I have few other ideas, but this one stuck with me when: 1) I applied for my prescription reimbursement through the insurance policy at my company, and 2) I heard that buyer's remorse is very frequent, especially for shopping addicts (surprisingly).

Why would people pay you instead of going to forums or just googling the answers?

But then you're basically just internet tutors."
startups,3cyhv5,amosschorr,3,Sat Jul 11 23:09:22 2015 UTC,"I originally got this idea after watching MIT/Stanford videos. Not being in the actual course prevents me from asking the professor and TA questions. Having a readily available TA to ask questions helps incredibly, especially if questions are unique in nature.  I'd rather not build my own OCW, since there are plenty of online courses taught by some of the world's best professors. I'd rather just take advantage of that.   And the thing about internet tutors is that they may not be familiar with all the content of a specific course, which prevents them from responding to questions as quickly/effectively.  If I played off the OCW platform, I could hire actual Stanford and MIT students (just an example, but logically anyone who has done well in the class or subject material) to be an online Teaching Assistant.   It's not really a tutoring service. Teaching Assistants in college aren't expected to tutor individual students (way too many students/packed hours/etc, but just to answer their questions."

But when you're struggling to understand a very difficult concepts (Special Relativity) talking to an expert is the way to go.   I haven't run a test example yet. I can't predict the future but I'd pay a decent amount($20 per week?) if the TA's were good.  Very small commissions off of TA's. The potential benefit of this idea far out ways the money I could make from it in the early stages.  If any of those it would be per class.  That's actually the easiest part. If they have the credentials then interviewing them wouldn't be too difficult (we'd just require them to glance over the course material to make sure they don't forget anything).  However, if they don't have the credentials, interviewing would be far more difficult. However if our company currently has good teachers, they can just verbally test these individuals to see if they have enough understanding/intuition/detail of the material.  Like for aerospace, ask them many open ended questions about key concepts of topics. The level of detail they can answer these open ended questions helps to show how well they understand it. Why? Because if we give a slight adjustment to the question, they'll be able to update their response accordingly."

Figure what that is and build that."

This isn't a business you can start small and slowly scale, this is something that's only feasible at a large enough scale. Meaning, to launch even an alpha, you'd need a handful of TAs and a few dozen students."

startups,3cyhv5,brblol,2,Sun Jul 12 15:16:37 2015 UTC,"Several reasons, including the first user paradox. In order to get students signed up, you'll need TAs signed up. In order to get TAs signed up, you'll need students.  But let's say you get a TA or two signed up before students show up because you're paying them a contingency. That's still only a class or two covered, which means it's immensely unlikely students would sign up, since the odds that there's any relevant TA for them are infinitesimal. But even more than that, if all you're offering is a class or two, students will assume your service is not legit and click onto the next website. The average user spends FIFTEEN seconds on a website, and that number decreases as age decreases (to a point), so if they see you only offer 2-3 courses, they're immediately going to leave and never come back.  In order to alpha launch, you'd need to first sign up 10-20 TAs (depending on how many courses each one could help out with) so there's a broad enough course offering to actually appeal to enough students and so you can get traction right away. Then allow for requests so you can see what courses you need to get TAs for next.  EDIT: this is by no means impossible. The move would be to reach out to various professors (you wouldn't be able to target prominent ones right away since the odds they'd help you when your service is still non-existent are slim to none) and ask if they could put you in contact with promising students. But you'd have to work out your pricing model first. The difficulty with that is that there isn't really a MVP you could put together without a significant expenditure of resources (mostly time and effort, and a lot of each). So you'd have to talk to a ton of random people to find out how much they'd be willing to pay. Then you can put together the website and approach your TAs."

Professors are generally friendly people where I'm around so I'm sure they'd be willing to help out.   MVP - Phone calls with TA's providing 1 on 1 explanation of questions.

In fact, people rarely ask questions in rooms of just 30 students (even when they probably have a few to ask).

startups,3cyhv5,amosschorr,3,Sun Jul 12 18:50:11 2015 UTC,"OCW doesn't just lack teaching assistants. Although OCW is fantastic, the whole reason why it's popular is because it costs $0. Why would people who specifically use OCW because it's free (which is likely the majority) turn around and pay for online tutoring on their chosen subjects?  Also, how is this more compelling than summer school? Students get more than just knowledge out of summer school, they get some recognition for their study.  Maybe it's unfortunate that most people want to be educated for the direct benefits it will bring them (i.e. jobs), but I think OCW is mainly a supplemental form of this education - popular because it's free.  Just as a final critique: even if this was somehow something that people wanted to pay money for, how would you plan to keep up with a large volume of learners from completely different levels? We're talking about children all the way up to senior citizens. Do you live in neighbourhood completely filled with veteran tutors, or would you just expect to be able to verify the skill of the necessarily massive amount of online tutors who you would never meet in person?"

And they've been pretty successful. But you're right, the majority learns for free. At my school students can take exams that let them test out of classes. So people can still receive recognition.   I love your final critique. The good thing about getting learners from completely different levels is that the requirements to be a TA changes. To teach someone algebra, the only thing you need to know well is algebra. So the bar is dropped for TAing easier courses. People on the site itself could apply to be TAs if we recommend them to TA (for doing very well). We'd still interview them.  Being a child versus senior citizen isn't really relevant, only what they're learning and their current skill level.   This is one of the best critiques I've ever received btw."

If you're investing at that amount of money its more likely you're probably not seeking other investors anyways.

If every equity holder contributes their pro-rata share of cash, then you can issue new shares and maintain the same ownership %.   If there's unequal amounts of capital being invested, then you will need to place a value on the company and issue shares accordingly. This can cause conflicts of interest, since those who are not contributing capital will want a lower valuation while those contributing will want a higher valuation. The easiest way is for everyone to contribute their pro-rata ownership %  Loan: this is also easy, but you will certainly have to be careful to price the correct interest rate on the loan. You are in a startup, so the market rate would probably be astoundingly high, which might cause conflict again.  Convertible options: this option can be more complex to paper. However, you could give the person lending some security while also affording upside without a crazy high interest rate.  The easiest way to do it IMO is for each member to contribute pro-rata. Perhaps you can make personal loans to those members who cannot afford to contribute at the moment. That way the person would still owe you even if your business fails."

I think you can appeal to a broader audience if you have like ""Split Sell Pickup locations"".    I think you have one major flaw.  If college students are broke, then why would they pay a monthly fee?    I think your process/steps needs a better example.  I would assume that step one should be about getting a deal, not shopping with friends.  For example, check out what ""bundles"" or ""savings"" are available and which bundles are ""%"" from being completed.  I assume you would have to have a process that says:   User is looking for x User then searches to see if x is included in a ""savings/bundle"" User finds deal and adds item to complete the transaction   Why do you need ""friends"" to do this?  They just want the deal right?"

startups,3cy233,brevig,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:30:15 2015 UTC,"I honestly wouldn't worry about the landing page so much. I think the most important thing is running a real test.    See if you can find a group of college students to buy something together. Find out what kind of items they are buying. If you cannot do this, do you have the correct market? For example, office workers. I actually live abroad (temp), I miss food and other products I can't buy, way too much. This could be another potential market. Americans living overseas.    Ideally you want to find out and validate, who your users are. What items they want to buy. Set up a 'group buy' without using your website. If you can do that, you'll have a much higher rate to succeed. To do this, target one location (example Rutgers University). If you can't get enough College students to use this, then your product market fit will be slightly off, and you will have change your market segment. It's important to sort this out before you build or do anymore testing - so that you are building it for the right market."

startups,3cyaya,techsin101,3,Sat Jul 11 21:47:56 2015 UTC,"If you're trying to find something on alibaba, you're gonna have a bad time. The manufacturers on alibaba are producing so many units that they're selling to people other than yourself, so that's going to lead to price wars. And ecommerce sites that have more traffic, and therefore higher volume, can afford to price things lower. They can take lower profit margins because they know the inevitable volume will more than make up for it. Amazon, for example, has algorithms that calculate their price based on expected volume at all price points to maximize profit. A lot of e-book sellers were mad at them for lowering their prices, but they didn't realize that they lowered prices because they knew they'd sell more units that way, and so would end up making more money.  You don't have that luxury.  There are a few ways around that. You can offer packages that nobody else does. Say there's gadget X that people want to buy, but that you can't afford to sell at the price amazon does, you can package it with complementary products, add a slight markup, and profit that way. Gift baskets operate on this principle.  If you can't compete against someone directly, find a niche. If you're selling specialized car wax, for example, package it with some polishing cloths, soaps, ""new car smell"" air freshener trees, etc."

startups,3cxwn9,crazy_idea,2,Sat Jul 11 19:41:05 2015 UTC,"Share your service with wedding blogs. Maybe do a joint promotional role playing thing where the blogger will act as though he/she (probably she) is actually the bride/event planner planning the wedding and is using your service. You might have to offer the blog a cut of profits you get from their referred traffic, but it could be worth it.  Look into this: http://www.weddingblogs100.com/ to find the right ones for you. Reach out to them and see how they feel.  I don't know what your capital situation is, but if you have the resources, it's not a bad idea to use social media influencing platforms like tapinfluence or sverve. I know that 80+% of the influencers on sverve are women, and I'm sure there are plenty of relevant blogs to tap into there.  So essentially, my recommendation is social media influencing, whether it be you reaching out to influencers directly or through influencing platforms. I know the team at sverve and they're a great bunch of people and are very hands-on.  EDIT: it's worth reaching out to blogs directly at first to see what kind of response you get. Maybe try to have a conversation with one to see what kind of promotion (or cross promotion) the two of you could work out. If that seems unsuccessful, or if the terms of whatever promotional agreement seem like they'll be sapping too much profit, reach out to the influencer platforms.  Some other stuff: your homepage has TONS of white space. I know that for weddings, white is a super great color and so that's not a huge deal, but you could fit the entire contents of your homepage on a single screen without requiring any scrolling. On my browser, there's about a 2-inch gap between the menu bar and the iPhone. I doubt it needs to be that big.  And this is due more to style than anything, but I find it a bit weird to read ""We have got you covered"" instead of ""We've got you covered."" In my experience, not using any contractions makes it seem like a 4th grader is writing it. You website is rife with ""we will,"" ""we will not,"" ""do not,"" ""you have,"" etc. It seems less professional to me. I'm not saying you should ALWAYS use contractions, but it seems you're allergic to apostrophes."
startups,3cxwn9,amosschorr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:52:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for taking the time to provide such detailed feedback.  I particularly love your marketing suggestions, especially cross-promoting with bloggers and employing the services of Tapinfluence or Sverve.  We got a great response from Product Hunt, but we definitely need to capitalize on that and keep the momentum going.  I agree with you about the home page.  We’re definitely going for the minimalist look but you make a valid point. Watch this space, though; we are working on some solutions.  As for the apostrophe’s, I suppose I’m just a bit old fashioned in that regard (due to my Aussie roots). I have shared this with my colleagues and will follow their lead (if I survive the flack).  Once again, much appreciated. You are an awesome contributor to this sub."
startups,3cxwn9,amosschorr,2,Sun Jul 12 02:54:42 2015 UTC,"I definitely dig the minimalist look. When going for weddings, you want to keep it classy. Minimalism, with lots of white space and dark font, accomplishes that, along with preventing anyone from being put off by your site. Unless they're looking for a goth-punk style wedding (ew). So the white space isn't BAD, I just think there's a bit too much of it. When it comes to the apostrophes, it's definitely the traditional vs. the modern, and I tend towards the modern. The traditional writing style stays away from contractions for formal writing, like my 10th grade English teacher taught me. But the way I look at it, you should be able to read your copy to someone without it sounding weird. And most people speak with contractions. Again, not a big deal, just something I'd tweak.  I'm always happy to help, so if you want to have a more detailed conversation about this stuff or something else, shoot me a PM. I love this kind of thing."

Being wealthy doesn't mean you're qualified to be an investor in anything other than maybe your area of expertise.

I also agree that you'll need to instill some sort of confidence in your potential user base.  Even if you're not charging much for your service, this is incredibly important because the people who will want to use a service like this are insecure in their choices and don't want to have any fashion faux pas (especially those based on other peoples' advice).    So you need to say what your credentials are, and even more important (I think), you need to give people some sort of an idea of what you'll do for them.  Right now you just have an advertising-like shot of two model-type people.  These are unlikely to be your customers.  So while it's great to use pictures like this to inspire people, you need to balance it with some idea of real world results and expectations for real people.  I'd venture a guess that most of the people who will be coming to snapchat for fashion advice wouldn't even feel comfortable in clothes you're highlighting.  Who is your desired customer base?  Who needs your services?  What will speak to them, and what will intimidate or drive them away?  Even if your actual money is coming from the fashion companies (as someone else suggested, a VERY good suggestion), you need to ask these questions, both for marketing purposes and simply determining how to run your business."

A key differentiation is that we're trying to make it instant, in the style of a personal assistance/friend.  2) Why does it feel so haphazard? We are at a Startup Weekend and have pulled this out of our asses is less than 24 hours.  In true lean fashion, all we've tried to do is establish if there is market demand before we consider the other 1000 challenges ahead of us.  3) What gives us authority on fashion? Honestly, we don't have anything amazing. We're a group of 3 women and 3 men in our 20s in an Australian city who aren't pants-on-head retarded - so we can tell when an outfit is a terrible idea.  That's why the people who've used us so far (you're all awesome!) get don't get crazy responses. We tell them what we think is good, what we aren't into, and that we're just another opinion, not the fashion police.  So why are we doing this? See response above.  4) Will get to other questions when we have time.  <3 you all"

The only issue here that would keep me from doing this is that this puts you squarely in the biz of building a social network...

What didn't work for me personally was that it didn't get me hooked for a longer period of time. random/anonymous people are fun for short periods but not for longer periods, the interactions tend towards more shallow fun/humor sometimes.

If your software is patented, that's a different issue, but there are probably ways around that.

Pros:   client and server can share the same code real-time reactivity is built right in really easy to pick up abundance of community packages/plugins available you can still choose to use node.js modules if you really want to   Cons:   security & permissions can be a little tricky it's quite new only officially supports MongoDB as of now (MDG did say they will support some other RDB in future releases)   Edit: Meteor uses MVM (model-view-mapper) and not MVC.

Let me know, I would be happy to help!"
startups,3cv76a,neilparkertx,4,Sat Jul 11 01:20:09 2015 UTC,Personally I'd build the proof of concept without the licenses in place and go raise capital to get the license deals/users afterwards.
startups,3cv76a,bowlofudon,4,Sat Jul 11 01:39:04 2015 UTC,"Neither of those are the first steps you should be taking; those are high-risk and expensive moves.    First, you should map out wireframes and build mockups to depict realistic use cases of the app.  If you can demonstrate your idea to the point where others get it and love it, it doesn't matter if what you have is a working demo, or just mockups, because your idea will be validated.  The next step would be creating a business plan, followed by finding someone to give you money for your seed round.    Now that you're funded and you still have that $20,000 in your pocket, you can put it to better things (like giving a healthy stipend to a CTO who is finally interested in joining your team now that the equity you're offering him may actually amount to something).    And it almost never hurts to have a co-founder."

startups,3cplln,zymergi,22,Thu Jul 9 19:35:41 2015 UTC,"Before I answer your specific questions, I think the best thing all advertisers can do to get better with their digital advertising is to measure their shit. Every day. Keep a notebook or a Google Doc or something else to refer back to a couple weeks after you make your changes.    The sad truth about AdWords is that you will not hit a home run your first time you're at bat. There are too many forces that dictate success or failure when you're first starting up. My first suggestion to startups looking to spend on AdWords for the first time is to come up with a test budget, something that won't make you cry yourself to sleep at night if you loose. Use that test budget for two weeks and measure performance across all your campaigns daily. Figure out what's converting well and why. Maybe females in Florida on Mondays are killing it for you. Write down all the trends you see in a notebook somewhere and include the actions you make in response to those trends (bid increases, budget increases, etc.). You know you're getting closer to doing it right when you're spending less money and acquiring more customers. If this question was more around how do you setup campaigns for the first time that you're confident with, let me know what your business does and I can provide more feedback.  This is a tough question because success will vary depending on your company, customers, and competition. When I see a piece of targeting perform well, I double down on it and trim the fat on the targeting that is not converting well. I continue to double down until I no longer see it working (for most companies that's seeing conversions become more expensive).  The world of PPC agencies can be a slimy one if you're not careful. I've worked with some that get paid by their clients every month, but haven't logged into their client's accounts in 2-3 months. My biggest piece of advice here would be find a referral as some PPC companies are great at talking a big game. Reach out to your network, learn who's happy with their PPC team, and go from there.    Edit - Apparently I suck at formatting."

startups,3cplln,salvage,9,Fri Jul 10 01:17:38 2015 UTC,"Hey,  Happy you are here to help!  I am with a startup that is trying to revolutionize the locksmith industry. The current locksmith industry is composed of lead gen agencies, mostly scammers, advertise for $35 lockouts and get in touch with the customer via Google Ads. They then sell the lead for around $75 to locksmiths who are unscrupulous who goes there, drills the locks, and charges around 200-300.  We're advertising real prices of 75-100 and we also have a smaller margin since we want to pay locksmith a fair price while still paying for some of our ad costs.  What do you think our strategy should be to bid against the scammers who has a larger budget for leads?"
startups,3cplln,bodhi_mind,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:47:19 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting concept.   The part Google play in the value chain of the locksmith industry is shameful. Typically, people need locksmiths within a very short window of time, which enables the highest bidder to win the auction. The issue of quality and price go out that window, and neither Google or the leadgen company care much for it.   I believe you can only make this work if you can charge enough to win these auctions, either by having your own locksmiths, or charging higher commissions. Neither area ideal in the short run, but you can make it work eventually.  Short of those two options, and the leadgen companies will always win those auctions."
startups,3cplln,bodhi_mind,6,Thu Jul 16 06:31:26 2015 UTC,It appears that past users would bid on a keyword with horrible ads/content which would jack up the min bid price. So there are tons of low traffic/ no competition keywords with ridiculous min bid prices. Is there any way around this?
startups,3cplln,purewisdom,8,Thu Jul 9 19:54:00 2015 UTC,The best thing you can do is make sure your keyword appears in your ad and also appears in your landing page. Does that answer your question?
startups,3cplln,PsychMarketing,3,Thu Jul 9 20:14:28 2015 UTC,Does keyword density on your landing page matter? ie. Number of times it occurs.
startups,3cplln,Toovya,2,Thu Jul 9 20:55:24 2015 UTC,Yes - it affects your landing page relevance score. It's not as relevant as it is for organic search though.
startups,3cplln,tangosolo,3,Fri Jul 10 05:00:24 2015 UTC,"There is another aspect of Adwords that people don't always talk about, and that's' relevancy.   The long and short of it is - if your landing page (where visitors go to after clicking your ad) is more relevant to the visitor and what they're searching for - you will typically pay less for that click - than someone with the same ad, same bid, but less relevant of a landing page.  So you can still compete against high cost keywords, just ensure that you content is spot on."

That's an extreme example, but I believe most AdWords users don't do a good enough job monitoring and adjusting these target areas. Second obvious thing people miss is the search terms report. Use this report every single day.  My business is called adHawk. You can learn more about it here: http://tryadhawk.com/ (Mods, let me know if this violates any rules and I will edit the comment).

startups,3cplln,RosscoGiordano,11,Thu Jul 9 19:38:43 2015 UTC,"If others are bidding on your brand, they are paying exponentially more per click than you are.   To be scientific, the cost per click for a keyword is derived by: Quality Score * Bid  Quality score is derived by: Landing page relevancy * ad relevancy * keyword relevancy  If someone is going to bid on your keywords, they are going to pay a heck of a lot more than you are. Let them do that. Although users may go to your competitor's site, the chances of them being converting to ""sales"" is slim.  I would highly suggest bidding on your own keywords as well, that way you steal some of your traffic back, and make your competitors pay more per click."

Do you have any recommendations as to how I can find ""string"" words/phrases or keywords and not have to mortgage my soul.  I think the issue is our product/service has a nitche market and so many people offer ""free app maker"" tools.  Need to know what we do?  It's a Native App SAAS Platform for Shopify stores.  We offer native apps with scalable structures and built in growth hacking tools to help medium to large stores.

You would know as they typically reach out to advertisers a couple of times a quarter.   If you do have one, my suggestion for you guys would be to have them whitelist you for the Gmail Sponsored Promotion (GSP) beta. You can target users with GSPs in two ways: by keyword and by domain URL. That means as long as you guys know the domain Shopify Plus users get emails from, you can target ALL of those users. The only thing about GSPs is that it is currently still in beta, so you will need someone to hook you up with access. That being said, it should be rolling out of beta in the very near future. GSPs also convert pretty well and see clicks at around 5-10 CENTS."

I was really lucky in that I went from college, to a successful startup that I joined during my last semester, to Google, to this new startup I founded. That being said, I've hired a ton of people during each of those stages and hold a very specific view on employment holes.   If I see one on a resume, it's usually one of the first questions I ask during the interview and what I want more than anything from the interviewee is a great story. If you tell me that you spent 3 months chilling at your moms house playing FIFA, you're not going to get any further along in the interview process. If you tell me that you spent 3 months traveling the world / country to experience cultures different from your own, or that you spent 3 months teaching yourself how to code even though you're skillset is in sales I'm going to get pretty excited.   Going through the hiring process at Google was pretty interesting. I was competing with people that went to Stanford, Harvard, and MIT, and the most famous thing about my university was that is had an 85% acceptance rate.

If this is something location specific, let's say a national chain of plumbers, setting up a campaign for each major city would be my suggestion. It's a little more to take care of, but it will give you the ability to control budget at the city level. This way, if New York is not performing well but Chicago is killing it, you can make slight adjustment to each budget to get the most value.   Also, for this scenario, targeted ads with the city name and other landmark info (Green Monster in Boston for example) will  typically convert better in that local market.   As far as general nationwide product targeting tips:   Leverage zip code targeting to get super precise on what locations are converting the best Leverage income level targeting if your product is in a specific income bracket (luxury mechanical watches for example)"

In the past three google AdWords team we wish with has talked about how important it is to continue bidding on keywords even if we have a top organic position. They cited a study they did with Levi on how it actually boosted organic search click through and helped reinforce the brand. They said we should do this even for branded terms.  They never could produce any other results like this so my question to you is: was this all marketing bs and how does google paid search really affect your brand image/click through if you continue bidding on terms you rank well for?  Bonus question: should I bid on my branded terms?

startups,3cplln,zaidka,3,Thu Jul 9 19:52:26 2015 UTC,"If you're not up and running with remarketing, that would be my first move. Lot's of folks think remarketing is limited to display ads, but Google offers remarketing for search (RLSA) and remarketing on YouTube. This will help you to convert the folks that fall out of your conversion funnel. Start with a remarketing group around shopping cart abandoners and work up the funnel from there.  Big thing for shopping campaigns is to break up your feed so that you are bidding differently for each product based on your margins for each. That car freshener shouldn't have the same bid as a nice set of rims. Once you've tackled this, I would focus you attention on the product info in the merchant feed. This article is a great resource for everything you need to do: http://blog.whitesharkmedia.com/optimize-data-feed-for-google-shopping-adwords You're not approaching this problem all wrong. You saw X was working and Y was not, and then doubled down on X.

I thought that after I joined Google, I would be taken to a room and they would tell me every thing I always wanted to know about quality scores. Sadly that didn't happen.   The truth is there are hundreds of different factors that go into determining your quality score, but the most important one is relevancy. You want to ""thread the needle"" so to speak.

I've come to the conclusion the relationship between Google and professionals trying to ""hack""(the 'get-the-most-out-of' variety of the word) their services is the same as videogame development and the hardcore extreme usage players.  In some cases the community has wider knowledge about the product than the developer does, mainly due to having more hands on time actually using and manipulating it functionally rather than playing with the backend, code and theory. The unintended consequences a developer didn't foresee are often known and abused by the community long before the developer knows of them, and it takes even longer for the developer to then understand what caused it.  Fortunately less people are trying to abuse Google SERPs at any one time than the number of gamers daily trying to abuse x change in y update to z currently popular game.  Find a reliable community with some good hardcore people, exchange ideas, build upon that, experiment. Once you've found that you're generally ahead of 99% of the competition's information."

Always. Like every day. Google will sometimes serve your ads on some irrelevant traffic based on the match types you are using. This means money out of your pocket that wont earn you a single customer.  If your website is not mobile optimized, make sure you set a negative 100% bid adjustment on all your campaigns (we made a short video on how to do that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AR2D94eeCg) Make sure you take advantage of the free ad extensions Google has available (Sitelinks, Call Extensions, Callout Extensions, Location Extensions, etc.) Don't pay your friend to manage your account for you, they are most likely just as bad as you are (this is partly a joke, but boy have I seen some jacked up campaigns run by someone's ""expert"" friend)    Edit - will to won't"

I would get this one a lot, and the short answer is that it totally depends on you business and how competitive your market is on AdWords. If you're average CPC is $1, that means you're looking at a 2 clicks per day to gather data on to improve your performance. It's not going to work. I would spitball a healthy budget for testing purposes to be in the $20-$30 a day range. Also, you're better off allocating it to one or two campaigns to avoid spreading yourself too thin."

startups,3cplln,blinkergoesleft,2,Thu Jul 9 23:18:52 2015 UTC,"General rule of thumb is to ignore things like impressions and clicks as they don't really tell you how well your campaigns are performing (unless you are just looking for people to visit your site without doing anything). Are you set up with conversion tracking? If you're not, read this article to get up and running: https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/1722054?hl=en  I would say the biggest issue you have is a fucked up quality score. Make sure you read about what impacts quality score, and adjust your keywords, ads, and landing page to help boost them up.

I was the 5th employee (not on the founding team) and got to experience the crazy ride that is the highs and lows of startups. Although Google is an amazing place to work, it was impossible for them to move as fast as a 10 person startup. I missed that level of excitement and energy around building something from the ground up. Also, I'm 24 and feel like now is the time for me to risk everything to pursue an idea I totally believe in.   And yes, starting a company is totally scary. I've talked to founders that have exited for $100+ million, and they tell me every new venture they start is a little scary.

You are saying I should more clearly define the need I hope to address, which seems to go hand in hand with figuring out what could be financially feasible. So when is it not to early to start working with a future cofounder?"
startups,3cu1d5,createtoday,2,Sat Jul 11 03:39:28 2015 UTC,"The problem with finding a cofounder before the idea is somewhat fleshed out is twofold. When trying to find a cofounder with some kind of idea in mind, the idea itself will naturally select for candidates who meet certain criteria. The less fleshed out your idea is, the less effective that is. Which means the odds are higher of finding someone who isn't a good fit for your concept. And then there's the fact that it's harder to tell if they're a good fit for YOU (both in terms of your respective styles/habits and skillsets), because there's less to go on. It's like having a conversation when neither participant is 100% clear on what they're talking about. Doing it this way could even result in you disqualifying someone who could be the perfect partner because you just weren't certain enough on the details. Odds are you have something in mind, but you just haven't figured it out yet. Do yourself a favor and try a bit harder.  The reality is that this isn't a one-size-fits-all scenario. For some people, working with a cofounder the day the company is conceived is the proper move. For some, it's once they have a MVP, etc etc. (Though those day 1 people typically have some kind of prior relationship.)  Now, I majored in philosophy. I'm a big proponent of using dialectic to sharpen and clarify your own ideas, and I did it all the time. I had one friend in particular who was GREAT at helping me that way. I'd make my point, he'd ask an incisive question, and I'd walk away more knowledgeable. I wholeheartedly buy into the notion that a good team is greater than the sum of its parts.  But you won't know if your team of 2 is any good. That's why I think you should talk to friends, family, strangers just to develop your idea. Speak to some nonprofits who operate in the space you're interested in. Consider the idea of starting a for-profit company that gives back to the community somehow, whether it be through donating a % of the profits or providing a useful service for free to X group (this is the route I'm taking)."

The product isn't worth more because of the effort you put in - its worth more if the usefulness to customers is valued more than $1.

You've made a huge amount of progress, and now you have some good problems.  1) The answer here isn't clear from the information. First off, you are in a much better place to negotiate with your employer since you have a solid alternate. Sounds like commuting is the biggest problem - ask for the ability to WFH a couple of days a week (or, entirely if you're feeling particularly ballsy). You could also discuss a pay raise or a leave of absence for a time.  2) It's not about how much code you write, it's about the value being provided. Getting a thousand customers at a dollar profit each is better than one at ten dollars of profit. Now, if you're underpricing the competitors that significantly, it's good to have that conversation but in the end it comes down to ""Will customers buy at that price?"" As the business matures, if it's a large market, you'll naturally be able to charge higher prices, so the pricing on your first 50 customers won't matter all that much."

startups,3cs6gl,alexmobile,3,Fri Jul 10 13:01:09 2015 UTC,"I agree you need to have a conversation with him. Keep track of the hours you work and when they were; midnight on a work night might speak more to him than noon on a Saturday. This will give him a grasp of what you've done and allow him to be more empathetic. But, if it's the price driving these people to your product, you might need to have a few more sleepless nights and it will be worth it in the end.  Random thought: Hire someone to do your work at %50 of your share. That way you still get $750 a month and you're literally doing nothing. Just a thought!"
startups,3cs6gl,creeker7gen,2,Fri Jul 10 17:42:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a great idea. I will let him know in more detail the hours I put in. And I think I have to somehow figure out the value each person adds isn't just the number of hours. It's hard to remember that, because sometimes it feels like he's barely putting in much hours but his business relationships are very valuable. And it also feels lame when he starts telling me what to build/change as if he was my boss, or as if I was just a contracting engineer. I usually respond with, ""have you got us more customers yet?""  I think hiring someone would be good but also kill all the profit."

I have money saved up from previous ventures and passive income from some mobile apps I put up a while ago. Also you should try as much as possible to cut down on expenses you don't need.

Yes it's a lot of work but here's why it's also smart:   I have a steady paycheck coming in so I don't have to worry about a tiny 6 month burn rate I have the money to hire virtual assistants to help move things faster. I can also hire devs and whatnot if I need them and don't want to do things myself My business is not yet viable. Instead of freaking out about it and eating baloney sandwiches I'm ok with it moving at the pace it's going. I even take weeks off at a time to deep dive into the next thing I want to learn. For example right now I'm learning how to write awesome copy.  Healthcare. This is a biggie. Not sure if you are in the US or not but if you are then you're aware that healthcare premiums costs a TON if you aren't under a company plan. Right now I pay $80 per month. When I was ""all in"" on my last startup without a regular job I was paying $1600.    Freelancing is cool if you can get a solid client base. One big downside of freelancing is that you're going to spend time marketing and selling in addition to doing your actual freelancing work. This combined work might even be more than the 40 hours you would have at your regular job."

startups,3cqfvb,privatly,2,Fri Jul 10 13:50:12 2015 UTC,It's best to have at least a regular part time job while starting up. That way you can focus your energy on the startup without having to worry about how to pay the bills.   I think freelancing while working on a startup is a mistake as with freelancing I'd think you'd have the added pressure of chasing people to pay you what they owe you. That's one thing if you are purely a freelancer but having a startup on top of that pressure would be too much for most people. Better to have a mundane but secure part time job while working on your startup.
startups,3cqfvb,thalassography,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:04:58 2015 UTC,"Freelancing/contracting is a great idea.   Before leaving my full time job (also as a full stack developer), I was able to secure a long term contract with a previous employer which provides me 6 months of guaranteed income.  I recommend trying to secure some freelance work before leaving your job, if possible. Some of the best sources of work are advertising/digital agencies. They handle sales, account management, etc - generally all you have to do is deliver code. The downside is that the work is usually not glamorous or exciting."

Since this is the place where your potential customers become real customers, i think this is only a distraction from completing a sale. You force your customers to create an account so don't you collect their email there? I think you should remove this modal.  The page where you collect credit card information is not secure. This is a red flag for internet shoppers. I see that the payment form is an iframe, so technically, the data is secure, but your potential customers don't know that.

startups,3co57o,bellyfloppy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:26:26 2015 UTC,"It's a new world in the last few years.  They could IPO, they could raise another round or they could sell.  Cash is cheap lately so IPOs are down because of it.  In some cases it makes sense to take more vc money rather than deal with everything that comes with being a public company."
startups,3co57o,not_karma,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:06:04 2015 UTC,Doesn't that mean that the founder lands up with less money at the exit though?
startups,3co57o,bellyfloppy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:44:07 2015 UTC,"Depends.  If your valuation is sufficiently high it could drive an even higher IPO, so you'd make more even while owning less.  It also allows for taking money off the table, in case you end up in a place where a downround or sell because of less advantageous circumstances.    But I think your question is more: Does that mean that the founder ends up owning less of the business.  The answer to that is yes, most likely.  Unless the round is a liquidity event for employees.  Ultimately it's all an it depends thing and that's all based on how well the company is doing and perceived to be doing."
startups,3co57o,Geminii27,2,Fri Jul 10 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly sure you need to pay for an organizer account on meetup. Hence, meetup is less suitable for casual meetups.

startups,3co57o,amosschorr,4,Thu Jul 9 15:20:14 2015 UTC,Well put @amosschorr.  meetup.com is a tool for an event organiser who is ready to pay money to get a bunch of other people to a given place at a given time. klavado.com lets all participants figure out when and where to meet together.

If you can corner the market before they get traction, they'll probably either eventually shut their service down or attempt to buy you (or another Microsoft-level company might attempt to buy you in order to be able to say they're outcompeting Microsoft at something). Don't bet on it, but be aware that it's a possibility; you might want to decide before it happens whether you'd take such an offer, and from whom, and for what minimum amount.  (btw, see if you can get some press about ""The plucky local who's beating Microsoft."" That always makes for a good headline. Just make sure you're prepared for a massive influx of the curious.)"

What I don't understand about doodle though is why they never added an option for deciding on a place.  Its seemed the logical next step and I even wrote a blog post recently about that:  https://redemptionthongs.wordpress.com/2015/06/29/why-is-doodle-com-failing-to-innovate/"
startups,3co57o,wenqinYe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:49:17 2015 UTC,"It's true - Doodle's been relatively static for a long while. Not really much happening in terms of new features or anything. That said - what it does, it does really well.  As for why it doesn't have location stuff, I think that just greatly complicates things. Like say someone's times they are available are dependent on which location the group votes on?  Like the one friend who lives way out in one side of town can't make the 6PM movie if you decide to see it at the theatre on the opposite end of town.  Then it slowly changes from figuring out when people are free to figuring out what everyone wants to do, AND when they're free which I think are two separate ideas. If you were to have both, I'd do Phase 1 - pick the thing and place. Phase 2 - pick the time.  If you try to blend the two, the workflow can get complicated, or frustrating for users who have odd conditions."
startups,3co57o,mlloyd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:14:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, I see what you mean.  It is a pretty difficult workflow if there are people who can only do specific combinations of places and date/times.     Right now I don't have a solution for that but I also don't see any harm in giving people the option to vote for both date/times and places on the same page.

startups,3co57o,Ian_Dess,3,Fri Jul 10 14:59:43 2015 UTC,"I don't have an answer to your question but I do have some unrequested feedback. With your product it strikes me that more so than the vast majority of web apps your url structure is pretty important because they're going to be shared around a lot. Personally I'd try to ditch the ""meet/m/"" part and get the randomly generated bit down as short as possible. Just makes it look neater/more professional and makes it easier to share the link verbally if necessary. Also without knowing your marketing or anything I definitely would have went with a short, relevant domain name. I just looked on a domain checker for ""meet"" and it tells me meet.gd, meet.gg, meet.gl, meet.gy, meet.sh, and a ton others are available. Imo something like meet.gd/a5t9 would be a lot more shareable than http://klavado.com/meet/m/jbgmflun-1618."

I am working on an option to allow people to give their meets a more friendly url.  In the meantime you are right, I could make the url shorter - I'll have a go at that tomorrow. Regarding the domain name, I did think about that quite a bit and ended up going for klavado because I wanted to create something distinctive.  Its a bit of a gamble as for now it means nothing but I hope after some years people will recognise the name and associate it with quick easy meetups / meetdowns....."

I do prefer their name as a simple / familiar type words/names  I'm much more willing to try out something with a common phrase or name than something that sounds foreign.  Yours would be harder to remember how to spell and market.  If someone mentioned the names I'd think of that tomato drink, a travel site, a health app, a type of avocado company, it really could be anything. Even using a K vs a C can be confusing.  When I search your app in the google store it changed it saying did you mean clavado? Of course, it doesn't matter if you become very popular and a household name, but otherwise I don't think your company name has any value.   You won't get any accidental people searching for Klavado either. It just makes things harder to start.  Good luck, you've come this far why not see if your work will take off.

I'm working on a startup that will compete against some pretty big competitors. Microsoft has a terrible track record with releasing stuff that people end up hating. Microsoft is a failure machine - just look at their history: tablets, phones, operating systems. Look at the Microsoft surface generation 1: it was awful. They also didn't know how to market it. It took them three generations (6 if you count all the various flavors) to get it right (yes, the surface 3 is actually a pretty nice machine). Their modus operandi is to throw billions of dollars at a problem until they achieve market domination. That strategy doesn't have a very good track record. Look at the Nokia fiasco.  Microsoft doesn't know who their customer is anymore. You are better off focusing on giving customers a great experience - deliver a product that provides intuitive interface, and makes life easier for people. Segmentation and differentiation is one of the pillars of success in any business. Find your customer segment, make your product unique, and keep hammering away at improving it."

However, I don't want to be rude (so please don't take this the wrong way), but why did it take months to build the app in the first place? Could you have not built a quick mvp of the app that has the core job that the user is trying to solve and nothing else?  Second, maybe Microsoft's vision of the app is different from yours. There have been many cases where bigger companies have ceeded to larger companies where the smaller company had some insight that the larger company did not.  For example, you might invision that your app helps facilitate making formal meetings easier, while microsoft might have a vision of just having random casual meetings (I don't know if that is the case, it is just an example)."
startups,3co57o,RiPont,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:38:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for your honest feedback - I am not offended at all.  Part of the reason it has taken me so long to build something so simple is that I am not the best javascript coder in the world and the site is essentially an ember js (a javascript framework) frontend to a Ruby on Rails backend api server. Also, a lot of the effort has gone into making it super simple.  There used to be a lot of extra steps involved in selecting a place, voting etc and it has taken me a while to simplify all of that. I find that whole thing about tossing out (pun kind of intended...) an MVP in a few days and seeing how people respond quite misleading.  Even after I had spent several weeks on it, I found it quite hard to get people past the landing page till I made it super super simple."
startups,3co57o,RiPont,3,Thu Jul 9 14:06:36 2015 UTC,"Read the following blog post: https://blog.intercom.io/the-dribbblisation-of-design/  Foucs on the ""Job To Be Done"" of your app. Right now you are focusing on what your app does, instead of what it solves.  Your app (correct me if I'm wrong) helps people facilitate meetings easily. In that sense, your biggest competitor is not Microsoft but things like emailing each other to arrange a meeting, or even a simple post on Facebook to friends.  Second, your app is inherently a marketplace app, and thus the value of the app does not come from the app itself, but the people on the app. Just as how the value of reddit does not come from the site but the people that make up the site. Without a minimum threshold of users, your app is not very valuable.  Thus, I would make your product distribution strategy your most important (e.g focusing on a local area, or even organizing events yourself using the app)."

Yes, defining the problem that I am solving is actually not so easy.  The essence of the problem I am trying to solve is indeed that of people meeting.  There are many layers to that though.  The logistics of meeting up is the obvious problem which is why I am starting with that.  For this you are right - I have to be better than email, whatsapp etc.  My value proposition here is one url which combines a map, a calendar and voting.  Beyond solving the logistical problem though I want to make the process so painless that meetings that might never have occurred will happen.  For example, right now I am in the newly opened google campus in Madrid and I am surrounded by people who may well be interesting to talk to.  If klavado becomes well know, I could start encouraging people to publish their meets in a public space.  I could then see who else in my vicinity is planning on getting lunch or up for climbing at the wall round the corner. A bit like what used to be ohours but for leisure. Anyway, that is much further down the line but yes I do need to think more strategically.  Not many people realise that this could be a marketplace app but yes, there is certainly that potential."

So far your problem would be IF you have 20 customers how much are they spending?  What is customer retention, and lastly what is the profit?  Oh, I almost forgot how are you going to get new customers?  These are the few questions you better have solved if you're going to get serious about raising money.

startups,3cqlor,luxstyle,3,Fri Jul 10 19:05:18 2015 UTC,"I think I've seen something like that before in SF a year or two ago. Forgot the name though.   Interesting idea. Here is how I'd validate it.   Can you cook? Or a friend? The best way to test something is to really get into the guts of it. Put together 2-3 different meal options first. Just a menu is fine but make sure it tastes great. Take some decent pictures of them and write a nice description. Figure out prices to make sure that you and the cook make enough. Usually you would charge 15% - 30% for a service like this.  Talk to your neighbors but make sure you don't sell anything until the very end. Start out by saying you have an idea you are working on where they could get food delivered by local cooks. Ask them if that's something they would be interested in. If yes ask why. If no, ask why. Keep asking different questions so that you can find out what their desires, reservations and questions are. Why would they feel this can help them? To save time? Try something new? Because they can't cook themselves? This initial insight will help you create your customer personas and positioning as well as the product they are dreaming of.   When you find someone who's interested have them put their money where their mouth is. Show them the menu and ask them to pick at least one meal and a day they want it delivered. Get the money up front.   This part is super important because many people will tell you it's a great idea to be nice but won't actually buy. If you can get 10 people to buy then you've got something. If not, then you'll want to work on it a bit more.  Now you just need to cook and deliver the best meal and experience you can. No website, no mobile app, just do it bare bones, door to door at first. You'll learn what you need to build in the app by doing everything by hand and with paper or basic xls spreadsheets.   Once you get a neighborhood down expand to others. HOAs might be a good way to get into a new neighborhood. Church groups could be a great way to get local potentials as well.   Good luck!"

I also really appreciate your post because it made me step back. As a dev, I instantly jumped into the technical side and started thinking strategy but you're totally right: the name of the game in this context is an AMAZING meal experience - not amazing technology.   I hope you'll stick around and keep in touch. At this point I'm refocused and ready to go rock hard on the experience rather than the tech.

You say you talked to some people you know and they like the idea, but are you sure they're actually going to spend any money on it?  Do you know how much everything is going to cost, both upfront and maintenance? You're looking at a lot of hardware, furniture, physical space, food/drinks, software/licences, marketing/advertising, etc.  There are some gaming lounges that have done pretty well for themselves, but they're usually situated in large, urban areas/cities. If you're not then you most likely won't do as well. Maybe try contacting some of them and get advice?  Do you also think you are the right person to run a place like this, do you have any business experience already? If possible it would be best to get a partner in this. Also contact business lawyers and maybe a bookkeeper/accountant if you're not ready to do that yourself.

startups,3cpmm1,rsteele1981,2,Sat Jul 11 21:11:53 2015 UTC,Look at licencing for using the consoles in a business environment. I remember running into a problem some years ago when trying to put a ps3 in a bar. Maybe the landscape has changed a bit or I may be completely off base.
startups,3cpmm1,nabilvirani,2,Thu Jul 9 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it won't be easy. You need to give them a reason to come to your business, instead of just buying their own console and going home and getting to use it whenever they want, for free. And, most people already have their own console of choice.  Also, you need to be able to keep your prices low enough that people will keep coming instead of just buying their own console with the saved money, without putting yourself out of business.   It won't be impossible, but it will definitely not be easy.   My local mall had a place called ""Gamerzland"" and besides the cringeworthy name, it was just in general not a great business. He charged an absolute metric fuckton, and that was just for an hour.  My advice? Charge for day passes. Make your money off of concessions (snacks and drinks) rather than hourly/daily passes. When a customer comes in, they buy a wristband or whatever that's valid for that day. They get full use of facilities; consoles, chairs, headsets etc and full use of games. From what I can tell, the best way to make a successful venture in this way is to just make money from concessions, akin to a movie theater. Hope this helped."

startups,3clx9v,spivnv,3,Thu Jul 9 07:39:32 2015 UTC,"I think so, a lot of these people have been getting by on what's called cottage industry laws protecting them allowing them to cook at home to sell direct to consumer at swap meets and that sort of place. States however are raising standards now. If they want to make large batches for catering retail etc they need to have made it in a commercial kitchen. This type of thing is also good for people who want to test their concept bakery for example won't need to outfit a whole kitchen to find out if they are going to make it or not they can just rent a time share and open a smaller storefront and still be legal. There's two ways to monetize this market the one I mentioned with an entire business that is just a kitchen sold on time share with 24/7 access. The way I think you are asking about in under utilized space is something similar to airbnb where existing restaurants can rent their empty kitchens to people for extra income. I own a pizzeria open from 11 to 11 so my kitchen is empty 12 hours a day if someone wants to use my mixer and bake some things that would be a great way to offset some of my overhead. Some places don't open until 4 so they have even more convenient time slots."

startups,3clx9v,18nleung,2,Fri Jul 10 04:06:59 2015 UTC,"Decorated apperal is part of that. I work in the industry.  So the bigger shirt decorators or screen printers belong to those groups and then distributors have access to those suppliers.  Then you have the apperal suppliers in general which supply the clothing you buy as a screen printer.   Are there local small time screen print shops? Sure here's the issue.   Schools usually follow a bidding process so this wont work.  Groups.. which i think you mean school group? Follow whatever person somebody knows or they go local anyway.    Etc? Etc what i persobally sell to businesses, nonprofits, and associations now as do many other people in thosr worlds.  I have beaten local screen printers because they need to make money and can't buy in the bulk my company can. So i can sell a tshirt for 4 dollars and make money they usually can't make much or anything on that.  So now how are you going to make money here? I assume you planned on taking a cut of the transaction.   But this industry has some thin margins or loves cash (local guys) so now you're adding credit processing?   Or you were going to charge them a fee to be listed when they are already paying tons of fees to other similar things.  ASI for example you pay to be listed then distributors can find you.   I suggest you do more research into this as if you don't know about asi or how the whole model works now you will sound silly talking to these companies.  Many local shirt companies already got into the groups/nonprofit local aspects they dont need a website that lets people search.  I have never went into a company, school, nonprofit or talked to groups that couldn't find a tshirt printer..   Your idea is noble but do more reaearch.  It could work but what will you offer me as a group better than the local guy i use?"

On average, machines are only using about 75% of their total capacity which equates to a lot of down time. Any time a machine isn't running, it's not making money. Utilizing this spare machine capacity could pump billions back into the US economy.   First, it will reduce overhead for successful manufacturers and machine shops.  No need to buy a new machine when you can rent the time. Second, monetize idle machine time in shops where there is lack of work. Wouldn’t that be great – to fill machines across the country?  Third is risk mitigation and new development in large OEMs through time based machine extensions to their own capabilities – think on demand, aggregated contract manufacturing.   I think this is the next great frontier, which is why I work for MakeTime (www.MakeTime.io). MakeTime is a tech startup creating an online marketplace for buying and selling machine time which helps to reduce overhead and puts to work unused assets in machine shops around the country."

Some machines are better suited than others for some things, i.e. a lathe is for turned parts, a plasma cutter cuts 2D, a mill can carve 3D, but what it really boils down to is tolerances which we have our users specify what they're expecting before projects begin.

There is an anonymous danger to it but people thought that about Uber in the beginning too, one bad ride or one bad (food poisoning) review can really hurt someone's rep.  You want to make a nice meal for you and your girlfriend, it's simply unfrugal to buy such small portions, and would take next to none of your time to prep the meal for a family of 4, so how do you capitalize? Put out an ad for the meal, another couple interested in a home cooked meal on the cheap sees it and ""buys"" the portion, comes over with their own to-go container at when you say the meal will be ready, looks at food so it matches description, pays digitally and leaves.  When both meals are the buyer gives a review on food quality, and the chef gives a review that the buyer didn't show up and back out because they were super picky (would make chef's hesitant to sell to them in the future).

startups,3clx9v,spivnv,2,Thu Jul 9 14:22:46 2015 UTC,"I don't understand what you mean by how you hold it? Well that is a gray area i am working out.  Sorta the same deal that is going on with Airbnb if say someone slipped on my driveway and broke my arm and sued me I could be liable.  Currently homeowners insurance in some cases will carry over to a certain amount to your possessions stored elsewhere but not the full amount.  I would probably have to offer some sort of 1 million dollar guarantee like what Airbnb does. Yes, just like airbnb, this isn't for everyone but just go on craiglist and see that people are seeking places to rent and store things.  I had 4 fake craiglist posts up for different types of properties going for about a month and half.  I had about 88 e-mails inquiring about the space. Again I point to Airbnb, because these things can happen in that scenario as well.  However what Airbnb has as a huge selling point is the background verification and review system that incentives people to be honest.  I am a huge airbnb host and make a lot of money doing that.  I could go in and steal my guests camera or computer and sell it for a few hundred bucks.  But I won't 1. because I am an honest person but 2. even if I wasn't I can make $2,985 max each week renting out properties.  So even if I did steal and make a couple of hundred bucks off of it, a bad review where they mentioned theft in my home could cost me way more in the long run.  I imagine the same would be true of storage and trust."
startups,3clx9v,therealrico,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:05:24 2015 UTC,"I mean like, do you have a case or a box? Or is it just, you bring your stuff packaged however you want and leave it in someone's garage?  How often/when can I access my stuff? If I was renting space out, I'd want to limit how often someone I don't know was in my house, checking out their stuff. If I'm renting space from someone, I want to know when my stuff is available. And there has to be some limit so I can't store a pinball machine and come over to play it when I want.  I rented a 10X15 storage locker for under a hundred bucks a month last year for about six months. So let's say you rent a similar space for 50 a month in someone's house. I assume a 50/50 split between you and the renter? The incentive to be honest when you're making $12,000/month and don't have immediate access to other's belongings is different than the incentive to be honest when you're making $25/month and have someone's stuff accessible to you 24/7.   By the way, what are the legalities if you're storing something illegal in someone else's house? I'm, uh, asking for a friend. Or what if it starts smelling really bad or something? What is your recourse as the homeowner?"
startups,3clx9v,spivnv,2,Fri Jul 10 02:05:51 2015 UTC,"I've been on my phone all weekend and wanted to give you a good answer typed out on my computer, since you took such a keen interest in my business.   You would bring stuff boxed or packaged the way you wanted your self.   You would have to determine that ahead of the time with the person you were renting from.  Each owner would have different comfort levels, some might be ok with daily access, some might want to be there when you are there.  Some might give you a key, others might not.  Expectations need to be set ahead of time to ensure the storage area is a good fit for both host and tenant. Well prices will be set by the host so they can rent it for what they deem is worth their time and energy.  The other thing that I really want to tout is the flexibility of this service.  So say you have something you need to store, but you don't need or want to rent an entire storage unit for it.  Such as seasons things.  Some examples that come to mind are snow tires, or summer tires, or a Jeep hard top.  While storing say 4 tires for a winter might not make you much money, lets say 50 bucks for 5 months.  You could store 10 sets of tires in your garage for those five months earning $500 bucks.  Because you might live in an apartment and not want to store your tires in your apartment but also not rent a storage unit for 50 bucks a month just for tires.  Does that make sense? You obviously can't store things that are illegal, simple as that.  I don't have the exact terms and conditions figured out.  But I imagine self storage units already have terms and conditions regarding that and I could probably copy that for my company.   Let me know if you have other questions."

Before anyone wants to help, let me tell you what you are getting yourself into. Your computer is going to be working near 100% capacity, it will gobble up electricity, produce copious amounts of heat and be constantly transmitting data back and forth if you have a data cap. As well it might even be slow if you are trying to use it at the same time and might even freeze if you open up a program that immediately demands a lot of resources.   Other examples of people/institutions using those extra cycles are the group mining of crypto currencies and ATLAS @ home and SETI @ home.

Trucks and containers to transport waste from one place to another.  Overall you're looking at easily over a million in funding.    After this you run into energy production per pound.  I believe you need several hundred pounds of manure for 2 kilowatts.  So a constant and reliably large source of shit.  You will then need to store the biogas or pump it directly into the next part   Either scrubbing it to clean it to either pump into pipe lines or containers   Or   Burn it to power generators or other types of fuel producing systems.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogas_upgrader  There's currently plants now that do things like this with garbage yards and sewage treatment plants.  My idea has always been around animals particlarly dogs.  We are killing the envirment with animal waste.. but if we diverted dog waste and captured farm animal waste collectively I believe regionally we could  power heavy power using companies and events with plants built next too where the power is needed.  If nothing else its recycling waste.   The biproduct is a great furtilizer there's little to no waste as the trucks you buy could run on the gas you generate if you wanted to convert them.  The plants electricity would be powered by itself becomes almost 100% off grid and carbon nutrual.   The major and most important issue..  I have not found any way of making money..  just solving waste issues particularly animal. Some farms do this but my thoughts were around domestic animals  San Francisco uses dog shit to power their gas street lights.  That's the type of thing I'd like to do but on a larger scale.  Like make dog waste 100% recycled product.  Working with or creating dog yard clean ups.   But I think having farm animals including cows horses goats etc.  Will allow for more production of gas.  I've now rambled on too much. Lol"
startups,3clx9v,skankingmike,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:47:53 2015 UTC,"Biogas upgrader:       A biogas upgrader is a facility that is used to concentrate the methane in biogas to natural gas standards. The system removes carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide,  water and contaminants from the biogas. One technique for doing this uses amine gas treating. This purified biogas is also called biomethane. It can be used interchangeably with natural gas.  Raw biogas produced from digestion is roughly 60% methane and 29% CO2 with trace elements of H2S; it is not high quality enough to be used as fuel gas for machinery. The corrosive nature of H2S alone is enough to destroy the internals of a plant.  The solution is the use of biogas upgrading or purification processes whereby contaminants in the raw biogas stream are absorbed or scrubbed, leaving more methane per unit volume of gas. There are four main methods of upgrading: water washing, pressure swing adsorption, selexol adsorbtion, and amine gas treating.

When you do not promoting yourself relying only on presence at the shelves - find biggest suppliers in each country and make deal with them. Often they are quite straightforward guys and will set their requirements fast and clear.  If you need media support (reaching potential customers with your unique proposition) - this part should be separated from distribution channel or you will end up with dramatically marketing budget cut after first short period and your brand will not grow in the country.

Also, unless you're trying to offer outsourced customer service (which doesn't sound like a good idea to me), startups aren't a good space for this. There are two usual customer service outcomes with startups: 1. It's a relatively small, but passionate team. Hence they're excellent with customer service. 2. The CEO/COO/whomever thinks his customer service system is damn good because he's an arrogant, stubborn bastard.  In either case, you'll find it nearly impossible to get their business.  If you're trying to offer more basic customer service TRAINING, like seminars and the like, that's a better option. But I think you should rethink your model here."
startups,3cmrev,amosschorr,0,Thu Jul 9 03:57:53 2015 UTC,"How is it possible that you've done any of this without an established network?   This is a question I ask myself all the time. Truth is I don't know, I honestly probably shouldn't have been but good fortune and a lot of charisma has helped me... but I am better at making my users and customers happy than building up a network of people around me.    In either case, you'll find it nearly impossible to get their business.   I think you might be right, though I don't like the idea of customer service training although I always figured it would be an aspect. I guess I figured I would come in, help the client really figure out who their customer is and what they want and how to best communicate with them, establish a plan which improves their ROI and keeps customers happy and increases word of mouth marketing for their company, and then I just stick around to help keep them to the high standards.   You are right though, it might be a small market and even then the way I want to do it might not be that great for many businesses.   :P Really, part of me just wishes I could be back working at a call centre (my first job before all this) because I really just love working with customers and although I hated my limited options there at least  I got to be on the ground making people happy. I just want to somehow translate that into a higher paying job and perhaps improving a lot of people's satisfaction instead of one person at a time."
startups,3cmrev,amosschorr,2,Thu Jul 9 04:37:37 2015 UTC,"...then your users and customers are your network. You might not be good at following up or staying in touch, but the people you make happy are the best kind of people to have in your network.  My ""how've you done this without a network"" was a rhetorical question. Because you haven't.  In any case, what you want to do has a huge market. Just not among startups. Until you're able to get a client list together, get some testimonials and referrals, and build up a network in the proper space, startups won't touch you. Startups focused on growth will not expend any resources unless you can make them believe you'll help them grow much quicker than they could on their own. Until you have a more proven track record that's relevant to them, that won't happen."

Find the super connectors who are likely to refer people to you over and over again. Super connectors know lots of people, they know those people's problems, and they're easy to talk to.  Now most people that actually do know the people in their network well enough that they know their problems also really care about helping those people in their network. Before they make an introduction, they will have to believe that you're actually providing value. And if you don't provide value, they'll stop referring people to you really quickly."
startups,3cmrev,PaybackTony,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:22:19 2015 UTC,"Not to sound like a broken record, but I touched on a similar idea at popflame.com in regards to establishing an enterprise sales channel. Really, without a network it's hard to do in a cold-call fashion, but it's also likely that you can find other business' who cater to your target market, in which you can provide additional value to their customers. I am actually one of the founders of Calltacular, and we service call centers and SMB's who handle inbound calls etc themselves.   Having worked in this industry for some years I can say that many CEO's know if their customer service department is doing a good job or not. The problem is selling them on the value of making it better. As we've discovered with our own business, good customer service can most definitely double your income from satisfied clients, especially in the enterprise market. This is becoming more widely known and I think you won't have any issues finding some strategic partnerships to help grow. Finding those partnerships is something I've done well and at least lay out the basics of in that post.  Long story short: find strategic partners where your service is complementary and get referrals that way."

Stripe is good, and does support more than just Visa / Mastercard (https://support.stripe.com/questions/which-cards-and-payment-types-can-i-accept-with-stripe) But it's still lacking in support for couple brands.  PayPal supports many brands but you must deal with everything that goes along with PayPal. If you're like me, and don't run anything high risk, it's not bad (I've used it for a decade with no issues). I use Stripe as well, and have used WePay (US) as well as traditional merchant account options.  So in terms of coverage PayPal is one of the better options. Stripe covers a lot of those options as well, and may be rolling out ACH payments in the near future. Another option is to use a mix of traditional merchant accounts, but that is a time investment and more paperword.  Basically, international payments are a bitch because of all that goes on behind the scenes, so options are limited for all-in-one solutions."

You may have proof of shipping up the ying-yang -- email, PDF receipt, scan of a printed postal receipt, whatever -- but it doesn't matter: The credit card company will give the buyer back his money no questions asked, and PayPal obviously is not going to eat that, so guess what? You're out of luck.  The key, I've learned, is to only accept overseas orders marked as ""Seller protection: eligible."" If it says ineligible, refund the buyer's purchase and move on.

Are you trying to serve the niche between normal wordpress users and thegrid.io?   ""Become a founding member"" button just redirects to the home page. Your site loaded in 7 sec when I tested in on pingdom. You should try to bring that way down. Free SSL - It's a little misleading to say that cloudflare's free ssl will provide security. This only encrypts the data between the client and cloudflare, not between cloudflare and you. I see that your product is open source, but I don't see a place to download it. A big thing that I noticed is that your landing page is filled with features, but doesn't tell me what value I'm getting out of it. People generally don't buy features, they buy the value. Since the pricing page redirects to the home page, the only info on pricing is found on the membership levels page. This page doesn't tell me what I'm getting for each package. Bandwidth limits, storage limits, etc. Finally, after looking at each page, I understand that you're selling a hosted web site builder with built in analytics, a/b testing, ecommerce.

In a sense yes, but my main goal is to create a platform that bridges the technical knowledge gap that is required for people to get their own WordPress site up and running. Unlike thegrid.io, or any other propriety platform, WordPress is by far the most empowering with its licensing. I also believe that it is becoming the most advanced technology in the web publishing space.   1.) THANK YOU for catching this :) 2)I will see if there are any images that need to be optimized.  3) We are using wild card ssl certificates on the entire network, so I believe they will be secured between cloudlfare and brandit?  4) only users who are members will be able to download the self-hosted GPL version.  5) This is a great critique, I will start working on the content to focus more on value gained.  6) I agree, I will add all of that info here.  7) We are using stripe and paypal to accept payments. There are a few steps on the user end to get Stripe up and running. For PayPal, all that is needed is a PayPal email to start selling.

startups,3cn41u,amosschorr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:25:45 2015 UTC,Can you expand on how this is managed...   Does it require someone to manually input the data into CRM as a lead ( and mark it as referral)  Can you then email( engage) the referrer during different phases of the lead. Is this an automatic process with some C RM's or shoul;d this workflow be customised into a CRM  Can referrals be input in directly via a referral form on a referral or lead page ( I have seen a Campaign feature  in some CRM's like Zoho but they seem forcussed as a lead capture tool rather than as a referral one)

This is a great platform for an entrepreneur who has trouble getting from 0 to 1, but it is not a passive income stream. There is a certain amount of churn with the monthly customers and you will always be fighting to replace them and grow on top of that.   The closest thing to a catch is that we have a competitor that has outraised us, making VC funding more challenging. That said, growing the business organically or through alternative sources of growth capital is very possible.  If you would like to learn more, you are not putting yourself at risk by filling out the application. It shouldn’t require more than 20 minutes to fill out."

Given that you've also offered absolutely no details but that it's profitable, has 90+ clients, and is in the black, I'm sure you can forgive my skepticism. In addition, the likelihood of having built this with no partners who would either want to take over or would be against you giving it away for free is about 0%.  Put simply, I call bullshit.

startups,3cl4x3,virgil_c,2,Wed Jul 8 19:29:49 2015 UTC,"This is most definitely the most overlooked growth method. No question. Finding the right partnership (really, just someone who can send referrals) isn't easy, but it has been key to my last two companies not having the sales problem. Because of this strategy, I found a whole new way to fail on my rent payment startup, having too many people wanting to use it, and not enough support for the demand. That's a whole separate story.  In my current company, we are in that same boat, and it is largely due to strategic partnerships that were forged both in the US and internationally. I recently wrote about this at popflame.com. Contrary to a couple comments here, it's not ""rare"", but it's not going to magically happen either. Your products needs to have a real, tangible value, and moreso, needs to have a way to help your partners increase their business by including your service or product in their offerings.  How to apply that to your network is another story. The fundamental idea that it's a great way to grow a start-up is right. Still need to stew on the viability of a platform for it. To me, it feels like the ones who make the best partners for start-ups aren't going to be actively looking for strategic partnerships with start-ups, which seems to introduce a sort of road block in the networking affect of the platform."

However, I think the strategic partnership approach is much more popular among B2B and enterprise startups.  A problem, like you said, is to fill a side of the network since the best partners are not actively searching for partners. That's why I thought about a lead exchange program, on which I won't have 2 sides to fill, just one, match them and provide some tools to make it happen."
startups,3cl4x3,amosschorr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:37:10 2015 UTC,"Official partnerships typically aren't the best idea to start out with. It's a better idea to simply start sending referrals to each other, flesh out the relationship organically, and then make it official if it seems like a good idea.  I have a number of unofficial partnerships for a political organization I work with that make some good introductions for me, throw us some sponsorship money now and then, and plan joint events with us sometimes. And the entrepreneurial organization I work for has some official relationships, but those need to be more official in order to work properly."

startups,3cl4x3,mrssheep,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:56:24 2015 UTC,"Well, my point is that the moment you officially get in bed with someone, your reputation is impacted by theirs. I'd never form an official partnership with anyone without having an unofficial trial period and the time to get to know them and how they do business. If you're an unofficial partner with an organization (meaning they just throw you some leads and a few referrals) and it comes out that they, say, have been stealing from their clients or something crazy like laundering money for ISIS or something, your reputation won't suffer much. Maybe some of the people you referred to them will think a bit less of you, but that's it.  Starting an official partnership, on the other hand, means you're officially vouching for them. And if it turns out they're bad people, that looks bad on you. Imagine if you worked for XYZ company and told them to hire your friend who then embezzled tons of money or was drunk at work all the time. Wouldn't that make you look terrible?"

startups,3cl4x3,EdTwoONine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:56:39 2015 UTC,"My idea is to focus on finding partners based on company's customer profile. You complete a form that determines your customer profile based on targeting, demographics, etc and you'll get  a list of companies that match that profile. From there you can research the company, send contact request or partnership proposals, review partner, etc.  Probably we'll zoom-in to automate partner programs like lead exchange which I know is popular in B2B space."

I am at the point that I have a good idea of what I want and just starting to look for someone to help move it forward, but have three kids and not much extra income to pay a service to build so I was hoping to find someone that wants to go in together.

I would also recommend you specialise at least at first because it will help you to establish relationships with journalists in that particular area. For me, it's local Scottish media. Not the greatest and most lucrative area but you have to start somewhere. Smaller media sources (IE not The Guardian or the LA Times) need to fill column inches. They love getting proactive contact. They'll always welcome another source for a potential story.  Press releases! You need to also be able to do something like write a press release that is effective for the subject matter and for the intended audience. Don't think of journalists as lazy, think of them as busy. If they can take my release and almost publish it word for word with minimal editorial tweaks then that's better for them. Learn their deadlines and respect them - if you have a story, don't send it to them one hour before deadline. Either give it at least a day before or wait until the next publication - this applies less to online news sources.  And always remember that 50% of your efforts will probably fall on deaf ears. Even the best PR person in the world can't force the media to write a story. A journalist who is friendly is more likely to write a story - those relationships take time though.  Writing and formatting! Send press releases that aren't .txt simple but aren't Photoshop complicated. Make it stand out so it catches the eye but it's not meant to be a flashy complicated thing.

Sucks though cause they tack on a credit card charge for each transaction... it's like a buck which makes it only worth it if you don't have change. I'd rather put in 25 bucks and have it debit from it and then recharge like a tollpass.
startups,3cgzp4,ishouldquitsmoking,2,Tue Jul 7 23:46:40 2015 UTC,This is already pretty prevalent in the UK - mainly for on street parking (if you haven't got cash for the meter) and in some car parks too. You can pay by text as well.   It's a bit of a pain to set up though the first time and I think there's scope for improving it.

I would assume almost all cities have some sort of ordinance that mandates you shovel like 24 hours after the snow stops. I know my city has a program where senior citizens can sign up to have people volunteer and come shovel their drive, because they can't do it themselves. So it's something that absolutely by law HAS to get done, there is a significant portion of the population that physically CAN'T do it, and you can connect the two.   I also thought it would incredibly valuable to small business that wants a parking lot plowed, and any dude with a plow and a pickup that can plow it for a hundred bucks. The guy in the comments below found a service like it, but right off the bat, I hate their design, and I've never heard of their service, so they must be doing something wrong.

Here's an example. I was recently buying a plane ticket. Apparently, I had a discount code from an airline I ended up using, but I didn't remember and/or think to search in my 'Promotions' tab. When buying things online and comparing prices, it would be good to have information on where I might have a discount and for how long without having to look through my emails. Call it extreme laziness, I don't mind.:) There is a Romanian (or maybe Moldovan) app that works like your discount card wallet, but it's not quite the same as it is based on collaboration with a group of retailers, from what I can gather, and is limited to one country.    (2) An app that connects aspiring photographers who need portfolios/experience with people who need good photos for various social media services and/or personal websites. I recently paid a professional photographer for pictures I hated, but I would have probably been less disappointed if the service was cheaper. I think there's one company in the US that specializes in photos for dating websites, this is based on a similar logic.:)    Edit: completely forgot about the third idea.  (3) A safety app that tells you where the nearest police station/hospital/place where you can get help and/or shelter is. I travel alone for work quite a lot, and have often ended up in, let's just say, unfamiliar places late in the evening. Sometimes you don't speak the local language well, or have poor signal, or fail to get Google Maps to work. This may sound to complicated, but I'm thinking of a system where you can get people from these types of emergency services to volunteer to be put on the local contact lists, so you can send a signal directly to someone's phone, say at a hospital, and get help if needed. Is there a way to simplify this and make it work?"

I would set up a landing page to get feedback before pitching anyone.  Anyone you pitch will want to know if this is going to make them money. FYI - I wouldn't tell anyone your age right away because they might not take your seriously. Not fair but it can work against you.
startups,3cjdt3,ashtrack,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:51:26 2015 UTC,"I'm adding ads and in app purchases right now to monetize. How am I supposed to convince whom I'm going to pitch that its going to make them money? How do you make money out of blogs? I don't know about that but I'm sure people will like reading about someone as young having a company to operate. For now I'm not really considering any specific audience but would love if you could suggest some!  Ps- I didn't understand your last line, can you explain it. Thanks!"
startups,3cjdt3,ashtrack,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:08:16 2015 UTC,"The only way you can convince them is with historical data - past sales numbers, growth numbers, conversion numbers (showing that everyone person who comes to your site ends up purchasing more than they did in the past month, week, etc)... Keep it simple and stick to 1 method of monetization and research it to make sure you're doing it right.  Ignore my last line - I was rambling."

Certainly not perfect, so I'd like to make this better if possible.  Thanks again for taking a look! :)"
startups,3ckgly,TheDicktator,2,Sat Jul 11 16:31:44 2015 UTC,"Well essentially, I had a sign up forms on the home page, I created two versions of the form and had them display but the problem was when trying to track conversions. Since the form was displayed on the home page, and there was no re-direct to a thank you page I couldn't really figure out where to put the conversion shortcode. I tried to place it in the messages and additional settings areas in addition to a bunch of stuff like <php> and do_shortcode calls but it didn't really track the conversions for me.  Although given that you've used it to test CF7, it's probably an error on my end! Regardless, thanks a lot for sharing such a great plugin! :)"
startups,3cjn7m,EBonFiyah,2,Wed Jul 8 12:49:29 2015 UTC,"It is never too early to do usability testing.  You don't need to do anything large scale or expensive. The most important thing is to make sure the test participants fit your user personas.   Come up with some personas and then find people that fit them.    You should test as early as you can. I've done usability testing of really terrible pen & paper prototype drawings.  The earlier you can get feedback the better because it is far easier to make changes. Get the feedback, iterate, and verify."
startups,3cjn7m,karlgroves,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:26:31 2015 UTC,"Great advice. Right now most of our users are the ""super user"" and I find that this type of user becomes a much smaller segment over time as the community scales.   You're right it's a good idea to make the personas but also be okay with them sliding around on the scale as the community evolves. I feel like Ive seen certain situations where companies are solves problems for personas that don't necessarily match their user base anyone.   Any thoughts on how not to dilute the pool of users? That was another concern I had. Assuming only a percentage of people will be open to giving feedback - how many times can I user test with the same pool of people before the feedback becomes too personalized."

To answer your question, from a startup PM perspective, it's never too early. In fact, after you've built your MVP is too late to start testing. You want to be running experiments from day one.  Starting with a customer-problem experiment (""I hypothesize that x customer has y problem"") builds the foundation for your solution experiments (""I hypothesize that z solution solves y problem for x customer""). Solution experiments are how I would categorize usability testing. If you use this perspective, your tests are not about ""Does my user understand me?"" Instead they're about ""Do I understand my user?""  I'm happy to go into detail about the types of solution experiments we employ, and what you can learn from them. And since I mentioned it, also what a customer-problem experiment looks like, and how you can feed what you learn back into your product and marketing. Just PM me."

If I were to do it, I would have a few cartoon illustrations that shows someone going in a restaurant, frustrated from waiting, then pulls out his smart phone, presses a button, and poof! A waiter appears.  This would get the point across much faster, what you have now is a tutorial. The video should be selling your service not training how to use it (you can put this video, or parts of it elsewhere).   Maybe have a thumbnail for the video?  2 ... This:    Imagine you are sitting hungry in a restaurant and waiting to order. You pull out your cell phone. You push the button and voilà, the waiter comes.

About the cartoon (we have similar thinking) - that's exactly what I asked my friend yesterday to replace it with story so it is in process. It is gonna be like short comic.

However, the English is still not 100%, which is understandable. One suggestion though, in your app, remove ""Send me"", ""Bring me"", ""Call"", and ""Call me"" as they all have the same meaning and just add clutter to the buttons. If you must type something though, replace those words with ""Ask for"" because it sounds more polite.  All the best."

startups,3ciw36,amosschorr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:23:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but your site looks terrible... It's dry and boring - wall of text combined with too intense color scheme.  1) Try using a bit more pastel blue and lighter gray for text.   2) The video pop-up solution is weird too... Simply add an embed video and text underneath it, if you wish, but then make the text shorter.  3) I really like the idea of CSS-based tablet design, but you're not pulling it off. Better search Google for freebie tablet/phone mock-up. Real iPad mockup would make your site a bit more lively, too.  4) It's really weird that ""Get started"" has dark background, but ""Sign up now"" button has white background. It makes me think these are two different sections and I was actually expecting ""Get started"" to be link too.  5) Instead of ""Sign up now"" button at the end of the page, consider using sign-up form, it's pointless extra click right now. Simply ask for name and e-mail and instead of using verification code, take a look at Google reCAPTCHA. And don't ask for password, generate it for them yourself. If possible, add Facebook/Google verification too. And the ""Sign up"" button at the top of the page should just scroll down to the footer sign-up form.  Anyway, take a look at here. I'm pretty sure you can find free landing page template to use as a starting point to enhance your landing page."

startups,3ciw36,ashtrack,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:48:39 2015 UTC,"More images, nice! Hero image is quite spot-on too if not considering the mac and map :) Anyway, couple of more suggestions:  1) Don't be afraid of spacing/whitespace. For example, something like 100px top-margin and bottom-margin would make the hero section even better and would emphasize the text more.  2) The heading and text underneath kinda melt together. Simple solid single-line divider would help a bit ( look here for example )  3) ""Use worldwide for free"" and tab menu underneath it should be center-aligned, left-alignment seems illogical considering how the content is structured underneath it.  4) Features part still seems boring. Just a wild guess what might make it better: full-screen screenshots as background (fixed or with parallax effect), then, when scrolling, they'd slowly be covered with rgba(0,0,0,.7) or something like that, and then text would fade in or slide in from somewhere. It would add some extra scrolling, but would make this site feel alive. Or just give this section a fixed background and make those screenshots and text slide in with jquery effects as user scrolls down.  5) Again, don't be afraid of spacing. ""Get started"" heading could easily have more top-margin, same goes for ""learn more"" bottom-margin.  6) ""This website works on any device"" - I'd call it application or software instead of website. Sounds fancier :)"

I mostly have been focusing my research on how to market and build a startup organically - but I imagine one thing that you might not want to overlook here is flyers or advertisements in your area(like school newsletters and the like).

Basically anyone can take Bitcoin down with a few 1000 dollars.   If you're gonna use a crypto coins then something like Litecoin will work well.   You will see a lot of Bitcoin spam in this thread as you've been linked from their sub. Bitcoiners love to shill and brigade all over Reddit. They're always looking for new suckers who they can sell their bags to. As all early adopters cashed out long ago what's left is 1000's of bagholders who bought at $600 and higher. Their daily task is to shill Reddit and try to pump the price. As you just witnessed.   They will tell you to use Bitcoin but they won't tell you it's not even working at the moment.

There is nothing wrong with showing a passion for a subject that interests you, not to mention suggesting it when the topic could strongly benefit from it's use.  Everyone has their opinions, but do you understand transactions, because I think you are confused. Could you specify details and evidence behind your claims?      I do find it ironic, that not only do you consider people with a passion for something cultists, but look at your history.  I have yet so see such a negative comment rating, which would insinuate that people do not agree with your opinion on the topics you are active.  It's ironic, that a subject you do not agree with has captivated your interest so much.  I am not religious, but I do not use that as a point to dedicate my day to hating religious subs, or slandering them all day.  Might want to look in the mirror about cult like behavior.  Your dedication to negativity is one thing that is obvious.         Also, have a question for those such as yourself that dedicate hate to Bitcoin.  even if you do not use it or like it, (you can save 20% off all starbucks, must not be a coffee drinker) why would you dedicate your day to blasting a topic that puts constant pressure on banking services that you use to decrease fees, increase transparency and increase innovation in the traditional system?"

Instead, I'd have it go to a new page where you really expand on your features and what differentiates you.  For example, my startup will have competitors when we enter the market. But our focus is security, and we do it better than any of them. So our landing page is covered in things like that to effectively say ""We don't compromise on security for your convenience bla bla bla"""
startups,3ch6j4,amosschorr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:57:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback and the kind words!  Your idea makes a lot of sense and is a good place to showcase what is different about my product. It makes sense that the differentiation table would be one click into the site, as it's one of the first questions people ask. My first gut instinct was to put it right on the homepage but it made me feel a bit uneasy.   I definitely like your idea and am going to craft up a comparison table soon.   Can you expand a bit more the copy on your homepage and how you focus on security? Did you pick your biggest focus and stress that consistently within the copy? I'm not sure I have one major focus that is different, but a few different things, but now that I am thinking about it, I probably should...."

And, well, the copy on my landing page sucks right now, but I didn't write it. I'll be fixing it soon, but it does stress security very consistently.  One thing I DID write on the landing page was ""The people's privacy is paramount."" That's kind of our motto right now. Since our differentiation focuses on how we're more secure than others, we talk about how we don't compromise security for convenience (like our competitors do). We're very consistent with the message.  To give an example: we do encryption. One of the level of encryption we're using is RSA encryption, which requires the generation of public and private keys. Many encryption services will generate your private key for you. This is convenient and easy, as the user doesn't have to do it, and if the user loses their private key, the service can give it to them. With us, if you lose the private key, you're SOL. But since we don't have it, that means we can't decrypt your data. Since we don't have it, that means even if we're hacked, your data remains secure. Since we don't have it, that means even if we're subpoena'd, your data remains secure.  We talk about things like that."

One thing i've learned for sure is that people don't read - so if you're banking on trying to explain the features in body copy most users won't get through the first sentence.   Personally when I'm designing I try to use images paired with some clear statements, whether it be one word or a short phrase. If I can then lean away from my computer and get the gist in glances I feel like i'm moving in the right direction.   Sort've like what you're doing with those 4 callouts paired with icons. Simple.

And you have to keep grabbing them with each successive sentence. This is an article that has really helped me write better website copy. Numbers one and two specifically.  Now, you'll still have to experiment to find out which experiences resonate with your potential customers most, but customer interviews should speed up that process."

I really like the way Paragraphs does it:  http://paragraphsapp.com/  Theres a MILLION note taking apps but I love love love how clean and beautiful the product is and how easy the tools are. I don't need to read a list of their features - i can see it clearly in the images. I think users are instinctually drawn to good design even if they don't overtly know it.   You could maybe use those bold copy lines to talk about how your product is smarter and or more intuitive than the competitors. It's powerful but yet it's so easy because it doesn't force you to make every ""decision"".  Not sure if that makes sense but I like the idea of the products i use being sort've magical and knowing what I want instead of giving me choice."
startups,3ch6j4,EdTwoONine,2,Tue Jul 7 23:46:38 2015 UTC,I believe table comparison is good and clear way to represent the differences.

Personally, don't take any offense, but u don't like the dot com thing on your social media channels - but it's already set up now & pain in the ass to change it.

I'm good at Twitter marketing but really need to work on FB. I followed u with @iamwormify @ghacklabs & liked ur page :)  I think ur vid is ok & can be made better to explain the real pain point.

But it's expensive & time consuming :( I still have to make an explainer vid for my service, but too bootstrapped at present + I'm focussing on creating content, setting up blogs & trying to get more engagement on Fb.   I think (if it's possible), what wounld really make ur product stand out, if it acted like a ""temporary VPN"" - that's something u can definetly market. So users can sign in anytime to unblock sites privately. Rather than just paying 30 bucks a month for a VPN.

We probably had ~8-10,000 email addresses. There were problems being able to send out email blasts quite often, the whole system is so dated, the UI sucks, the UX is even worse (somehow). Their support wasn't awful, but still.  I haven't used mailchimp in a few months, but their support was light years ahead of Constant Contact's. I always used their chat support feature, and it was fantastic."

It's has slightly lesser features compared to sendy and is more expensive. But it is way easier to setup for someone without any I.T. knowledge compared to sendy. Still works out to like a tenth of the cost of Mailchimp or whatever. Support is pretty good, Gareth answers the questions within like ten min or so. So if you have no or little I.T. knowledge I'd recommend them. But if you are comfortable with programming and servers etc. then sendy would be cheaper on the long run."

startups,3cdw9w,thinglistr,2,Tue Jul 7 18:07:35 2015 UTC,"If you only need 1 landing page and you don't need a lot of special features or updates just code it on html. If I was a one man show with extremely limited resources and a lot of time I would code them myself  We do offer a lot of features that you would no be able to get by yourself.   Easy to create: no code needed, don't worry about JS or even HTML, everything is drag and drop You can crete forms in 2 clicks: you can create any type of form, super customizable, where would you host the data? how would you create the forms. You don't need RoR, PHP or Mysql, everything works fine. Integrations: we integrate with most email providers and CRMS, again, no need to code a line 24/7 support: We have live chat 24/7. Mobile, Twitter and Facebook integrated: You can deploy the landing page on your facebook, or Twitter and works on mobile by default Dynamic Text Replacement: this is a bit advance, but works for ads, the text on the landing page can change based on parameters. This is an example https://ebooks.wishpond.com/landing-page-9/?keyword=Hi%20Reddit if you change the ""hi reddit"" for anything else the text will change. Templates: unlimited royalty free templates. Marketing Automation: You can do actions based on what people do, this is a bit more advance, but for instance, you can create a different website if someone visits your pricing page A/B testing: You want to show the best converting landing page, create multiple version and see what preforms better One Click Signup: if you know the email you can create a one click sign up, so if you send them an email to enter a landing page you just append the email and they will enter by default Pre Fill Landing pages: this is similar to the one click singup, but pre-fill the forms Analytics: nice user analytics Multi user accounts: you can control who can see, manage or edit your landing pages More apps: we offer over 20 different contests apps, Popups, Forms, and Automation Leads management: you can manage and score the leads and visitors.

I would've assumed that your target market are those who do not have the budget to hire proper designers/developers to make their pages. its no different to wix, just for landing pages. you will never get a multinational corporation building their site on wix. how many of these people/businesses would actually receive more than 5000 unique visitors to their landing pages?"

startups,3cgcub,TheSerialTaco,3,Tue Jul 7 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"For this type of thing you probably do not have to draft a grant proposal. You are really looking for sponsorships from these companies. Its the same thing as a local baseball team looks for.  My advice would be to write down concisely all the details of this (why you want the money, how much you need total, how it will be spent and on what, etc). Once you have this you can go in two directions. One would be to contact local businesses, tell them everything you've now got written down and ask for a sponsorship. In this case it might be good to tier out the minimum levels of funding you need for things and make a stretch goal. I would exhaust this option before going onto option two for a number of reasons (ROI for time being the biggest one). The other way would be to search for government grants for schools and start applying. This method means you will have to add a lot more details to what you've already outlined because its government funding. A lot of governement funding is a long shot as well.  Hope this helps, cheers."

Not only because they definitely don't care about a grant proposal, but MOSTLY because you don't want to approach your A prospects until your pitching game (and pitch) is on point. Practice on the D prospects, move on to the Cs, the Bs, and finally the As.  If approaching a larger company that has an office or is headquartered in your locale, you will likely need a grant proposal. Use google."

Your concept is interesting but being devil's advocate - Why would someone pay for a subscription service to then (potentially) pay for a product + shipping on top? Other companies already give crazy deals on products - Amazon, GroupOn, etc.   Also, if you were to do this, you'd need to have a large amount of tech products on your website, in stock or have 3rd party manufacturers or affiliates signing up to give deals. Similar to drop-shipping. They order from you, ship from the manufacturer or middle-man and you are only the market place.   Can you provide clarification?"

If you take the name that you are thinking off, and then add ""app"" to the end, or ""try"" to the start of it, you can get that same domain for seventy times less. e.g. if the domain name was startupco.com for $690, you could probably get trystartupco.com for $10 a year.

The fact that it started with a ""the"" in front of it does not support the idea that domains are not incredibly valuable when leveraged properly. If you do not have at least $1,000 to cover your domain, logo, SEO/SEM, hosting, website design for the first year you probably should not be starting a business in 2015 IMO. It all depends on how valuable the domain name is. Everything else is a moot point, this thread should focus on evaluating the true value of the domain, although the user probably is wise not to share with us."

I would say start the business. Choose whatever domain name you like that doesn't cost too much (and is easy to spell for your target market). Get a basic website, but don't spend too much on it.  The value of the domain comes via the business value (unless it's a catchy name that lots of people will like, in which case your business should be selling domains). Starting and growing a business is really hard. You'll make a tonne of mistakes, and if you're still going strong in 2years time THEN the domain you have will be worth something, regardless of what it is.

Most domains that are easy to spell and relate to any target market that is even remotely penetrated will cost you. This is like saying just pick any idea that has not been thought of and has a lot of demand for it. Like I said I am answering this question as someone how has bought and sold 10,000 domains. Let me be even more clear, if it's an easy to spell .com domain that contains one to two keywords related to anything remotely valuable it will cost more than $2,000 USD end of story.

I suggest to spend some time thinking what the strongest points of your business right now are. amosschorr's comment about conversions or returning visitors is a great one.  Also consider engagement measures such as ""time spent per session"" or ways to measure the amount of content a user is engaging with.  Not knowing your team composition, it sounds like you're first time entrepreneurs and will have to find a way to spin your background to make it clear you're the person(s) they should drop hundreds of thousands/millions on.  A exercise we found helpful before raising our seed was to just go through the Ycombinator application process. It forces you to find your strengths, know your weaknesses, and weave together a reasonable story. If you get the interview, it's even better prep for your story, regardless of whether you're accepted or not.  Edit: also, have you considered an angel round from friends, family, and local angels?"
startups,3ch68s,redditneight,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:33:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. Yea, we're first timers when it comes to funding / launching a startup and we don't really have any major contacts. We have spoken to many users and potential partners getting feedback / ideas / conversations going but it's a different ball game when money is needed.  The problem is that our bounce rate is quite high due to how the site is designed... so the user can just look at the feed of content and scroll down without needing to click on anything. I'm tempted to try out a 'show more results' button at the bottom of the first 10 results, but from a UX point of view i'm not sure if that would be helpful.  I'll have a look at the Ycombinator application, sounds useful.  I don't think friends / family are much of an option at the moment. We'll start sending out the investor deck to some local angels soon. Any idea what the best way to find them is?"
startups,3ch68s,9190vc,2,Wed Jul 8 09:11:43 2015 UTC,"The site design issue is also related to who your initial target market is. It's unclear if you're attempting to be a content consumption platform (similar to bestofyoutube.com) or a tool for companies to better understand popular content (buzzsumo.com)  You can't optimize for both since usage patterns and goals are quite different, which means the design will need to be quite different.  It seems tempting to leave the design more open to all types of audiences. This will hurt more than it helps since there are many sites similar to Ruzzit. People will just choose the best one, focused on exactly what they want.  Right now it seems like you build a solution in need of a problem. I don't want you to fall into the common engineering trap of building something and finding ways to get people to come to it.    Before even considering funding I think you'll need to much more clearly work out what problem you're solving.   Why is ""not being able to discover content online"" a problem?  For who exactly? People who like memes? Social media interns being tasked with generating quick content? What are their current solutions?  What exactly do you provide that is so much better than existing solutions?  Does your target audience even care enough to switch from their current method to you? How do you know they care enough?"

For this type of site, they'll want to see a high growth rate imo -- but also depends on how you plan to monetize. How do you plan on monetizing this?

startups,3cgv4p,grumpyGrampus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:42:16 2015 UTC,You are referring to your new company's registered agent for service of process.  I found via a Google search the following page which contains some info you may find helpful. The bottom line is that there are a number of legal consequences that come with incorporation (including choosing to incorporate under Delaware law).  You really need to consult with an attorney to understand all of this and make the choices that are best for you and your situation.  https://www.delawareinc.com/before-forming-your-company/understanding-registered-agent/  Edit: URL
startups,3cgv4p,crestkid,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:35:09 2015 UTC,"I thought so. I did consult with an attorney about incorporation, and specifically about incorporating in Delaware.

startups,3cgv4p,crestkid,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:37:47 2015 UTC,"Other than incorporation - you won't be going through the registered agent in Delaware for other parts of your business - they won't be ""forwarding your mail"" or anything like that. Your principal office is where you work - in NY, PA, wherever.... You made the right decision incorporating in DE, but that doesn't impact what you're putting in your Operating Agreement. 2 separate issues."
startups,3cgskj,DannyS333,2,Tue Jul 7 20:09:21 2015 UTC,"Before doing that, I recommend you do a little bit of investigation on how enforceable a non-compete is, especially in your home state.  Each state is different, and in many states they are effectively illegal - I mean an employer can put one in your new hire paperwork package and you'll probably sign it.  But often about the only thing in them that is enforceable is a clause that talks about not revealing trade secrets.  I've worked in the software business for some time now, and while I've often signed them, I've never had to worry about their ability to limit my options when it came time to look for work.  Standard disclaimer - I'm not a lawyer - I don't even play one on TV."
startups,3cgskj,RoadSurfer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:20:02 2015 UTC,My old company got rid of non-competes because they were not enforceable.   Although my friend who was contracting at MIT said he cannot benefit from any side work because his ideas while he's there actually fall under MIT's intellectual property rules. If he does anything it has to be contributed as open source or free. Not sure how true that is - it's just what he told me.   I'm not a lawyer either but my guess is unless your working for said company and meanwhile you're helping a competitor - it's probably not a big deal.
startups,3cgskj,EBonFiyah,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:05:27 2015 UTC,"Why are you concerned about raising red flags? Worst they can do is fire you, but you were planning on quitting anyway so congrats on your severance package."
startups,3cgskj,Disanlar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:48:25 2015 UTC,"You need to do research for your state, but in almost every single one non-competes are damn near un-enforceable...and borderline illegal. Even if it somehow got to a trail (which it never does) you would probably win. What it comes down to is from the states perspective a company has to have an exceptionally compelling reason for the state to deny that person employment especially in right to work states. So unless you are a very high ranking individual that actually possesses extremely valuable competitive knowledge your company is never going to spend the money to come after you. I can guarantee you are not that valuable because if you were you would be getting paid so much money that entertaining leaving would never occur. Lastly, in some outland scenario where the company did take action against you, if your new employer has a California office they can just say you will be located there even if you won't be. Its completely illegal for non-competes in California so this is a classic tech world workaround.  Source: I've quit multiple jobs and gone to direct competitors or company's that fell under non-compete clauses i've signed. All that happens is some scare tactics from your current HR department and legal team to which your response is ""does company X plan to take action against me?"" They don't say yes or no because Lawyers and then you both sign a nice mutual non-disclosure agreement which is also just about un-enforceable. Assuming you had good relationships with your boss and colleagues all your references remain good."

I gave them a search URL that already had a filter applied, and asked them to pull down the easiest 20-30 emails. Not worth wasting time if someone doesn't want to be found.  If you need someone to do research across the entire web first, so that you have a list of urls or something like that. It's probably best to break it into two requests. The first would be something like ""find 50 companies that have X and Y attributes"".

Now, there's some debate about the clauses of the CAN-SPAM act, but the consensus is that emailing harvested email lists is illegal. And under the CAN-SPAM act, each email sent is its own violation, which can be fined as much as $16,000. For emphasis: PER EMAIL.  http://www.projecthoneypot.org/law_of_harvesting.php  Now, the odds of you getting caught are low. The odds of being fined the maximum are even lower.

Phase 1: Startup Registration, startups register their profile & list out what they would like students to do. This will begin very soon, and we might make it exclusive/ invite-only to limit how many startups sign up.  Phase 2: Student Registration, students register their profile.   What it actually does: Merges Product Hunt (students vote for startups they'd like to work at), Medium (text editor), LinkedIn (a profile for students to showcase their portfolio, videos, pictures, blogs, stats, follow etc).   The goal, students do remote internships, showcase their portfolio and get scouted by recruiters. Everything they do for a startup will be displayed on their profile. Employers have the benefit of seeing more than just a resume, they see what students can actually do - which is what we are emphasizing, 'practical experience.'

Unless the people buying at the end of the supply line are demanding it, but I don't see getting enough support to justify the short-term of paying more for food that's on a block chain.

That said, it depends on the terms of use of the sites you are scraping from. I have a startup that does all kinds of scraping and we're certain that it's been noticed. We expect a DMCA notice from anyone who takes issue with us - which just doesn't happen. If you are direct linking to their page, you are driving them traffic. Why would they want you to stop? If anything, a future aspect of your monetization strategy might be to have source sites pay you to drive traffic. Until then, you can monitor how much traffic you are driving through your analytics and have a good sense of what you're working with. I also don't think you should be overly concerned about scraping algorithmically vs manually. And least I personally am not. Rather, will your method scale? Anyway, keep in mind that ""scraping"" has become a word to describe all kinds of data aggregation - not all of which legally problematic.  One last thought: I have always had positive responses if I've needed to ask. Talk to the right person at the source site and say, ""Hey, we we're doing xyz and we want to know where you'd like to have traffic linked to. What url should we use?"" It's mutally beneficial.

In essence, you can leverage existing services (Vimeo etc.) to promote yours.   How it would work: It would be a video survey, users click and interact with it. If you want to go one step further, you can add a testimonial widget too. However, I do not recommend this as it creates both positive and negative PR - if reviews are bad."

When someone says the idea isn't fully though out... well, yeah... like I said early stage conceptual.  The original thought in fact was to provide in-store ipads/stands with associated signage which would encourage shoppers to ""leave their thoughts"".  Say in a grocery store, you could have 4 - fruit section, prepared foods section, etc.  Shoppers could leave positive testimonials, leave a comment about selection, say something stupid, whatever.  I still want to get to that in the long run.    As with the whole thing... still trying to narrow in on where the value is to the customer/client.  The thought, however, is that the world is DEFINITELY moving towards short video as much as text, and that this product should exist... just got to find the right fit.  So is it (i) a widget embedded into digital businesses websites?  More for testimonials, back and forths, etc. (ii) Is it a separate platform plus embedded widgets to create a video-only Yelp? (iii) Is it more of a video survey focused product?  Not sure... but thanks all!"

Upcharging for a content monitoring service (and user-friendly access database for download) to sort the positive videos for re-purposing and funneling the negative or suggestions to customer service/marketing would be helpful to take the burden off the client to weed through everything. As a start-up we've had trouble finding the time to go out and get meaningful sound bytes or videos from our consumers trialing the product (positive or negative/constructive), which we would love to have. An offshoot business could be an interactive focus group style service for customers to provide feedback via video chat so the company can ask followup questions to get more detail on the customer's likes/dislikes/questions related to the product. A subscription could cover a set amount of consumer interactions in this way. Good luck!"

startups,3cb487,canoe123,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"I believe, considering its a calculator and not a game, black and white would work well, because you also write black on white. Maybe a minimalistic design would help, to get the attention on the actual funktionality of you app, and not on its Design. I hope this makes sence to you. :)"
startups,3cb487,canoe123,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:48:02 2015 UTC,Hey I updated the design a bit to very dark blue and green. Hope it looks better. I even updated the trailer. Is it looking better now?

startups,3cb487,nolightsplease,2,Tue Jul 7 18:03:03 2015 UTC,"I think the app concept is pretty strong! I'd consider what your core customer is and work toward targeting them specifically. Are they students? Entrepreneurs? Store clerks? Depending on who they are, I'd adjust accordingly.  Secondly, the overall branding/design aspect of the application seems to be on the weaker side. I think that's where you get the ""5 year olds"" comment. There are some simple things you can do to improve, but I think some great design would go a long way in generating additional downloads. (Some people will download an app based solely on appearance.)   I'm a graphic / UX designer by trade, shoot me a message! Maybe we can work together on getting the visuals up to snuff!"

startups,3cb487,HotlyContested,2,Tue Jul 7 17:23:56 2015 UTC,Who is your target user?   Most people I know who need to run specific calculations daily have the formula memorized or specialized software that also does advanced calculations. They don't need the other formulas in your app.   If it's a one time calculation people do occasionally (like weight or currency conversions) they can just use google or other online tools.   So who is your customer? What are they doing in their daily life that your app helps them more than all the other options available?
startups,3cb487,pumphump,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe this app has a much cleaner interface and when they don't have their computers with their softwares with them and want to calculate something quickly they can use this app, or perhaps for some non mathy people who would like to calculate something like loan but don't know how it works they can refer to it and understand the terms and how it works.  as for who is my customer, i'm still trying to figure out whom i should consider. It would be great if you could guide me, or help me find out the right customer."

There will be problems, failures, successes, disappointment and triumph along the way.  But in the end, it all serves to make you a better person.

startups,3ccq3m,amosschorr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:45:36 2015 UTC,You need to have interest already built up for kickstarter to work. You'll also have to spend at least $1000 (probably) on the campaign to make it a success.

startups,3cc5as,KidTix,2,Mon Jul 6 19:36:00 2015 UTC,"I think your product has potential and you have a few options that you may not have seen.    Consider integrating 'teachers' into your app. Both teachers & parents can give rewards to students. Parents can view any rewards children have received from their teachers, students use this as an incentive to study harder and prove to their parents they are doing well at school. Of course, limited to age groups. If this worked, then you could partner with schools (edtech is a hard market to tap into), and charge schools and make it free for users. Focus on student levels of 'happiness' + test scores.  Financial incentives. When I was a kid, I did household chores and was always counting how many pennies I had. This could be used to store this data, and teach students about budgeting daily expenses, saving etc.  Scaling it. If you receive enough traction / get an investment, you could make it THE app for kids. Shows rewards, tracks their finances & teaches them about budgeting, can message friends and family, take online courses and list them etc ~ A full fledged children's social network so-to-speak. Partner with a startup like SmileMom and leverage their API + parent network."
startups,3cc5as,LukeFitzpatrick,2,Tue Jul 7 05:50:04 2015 UTC,"Absolutely this this this. We had ""points"" in elementary school to get pencils, small toys. I'm sure this could SAVE some teachers."
startups,3cc5as,buzzlightbeard115,2,Tue Jul 7 16:21:12 2015 UTC,"I do Edtech startups. I was thinking in the lines of student awards and feedback.  But with your pencil idea, it's also good, just costly. However, schools may fork the bill. An alternative, a market day, parents/ schools host events every semester. Parents bring in food, snacks, toys etc & children can redeem things by points. Just throwing an idea out there."
startups,3cc5as,LukeFitzpatrick,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:03:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you'd have to do pencils and stuff. I'm assuming that wouldn't excite a 2nd Grader as it did for me back then.

startups,3cc5as,tnethacker,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:12:25 2015 UTC,"Hi,   Love the whole concept and the look of your product! Could you just fix a few things on your website to make it perfect -    The call-to-action is missing the word ""your email here"" on the box before the ""try it for free"". Add a menu structure to the page that has contact details, details where to buy etc. Fix the small mistake from the bottom of the page where it says: ""My 5 your old"" - well, you get it :)   Otherwise, I wish you good luck with your business. Hope you consider selling pre-made packages via kickstarter, since a product like this could easily make it through there.    EDIT:   I actually went a bit further here on your concept, since I can see how good it is. You seemed to have a webshop already on 2012 *(http://kelliekowalski.com/work/kidtix.html) - what happened with it?   Also, the video is 2 years old and your concept seemed to have been the same ever since. I think that all you need is some courage and a good kickstarter campaign :)"

I'm also very open to the kickstarter idea since we do plan on switching from printer based services to pre-made packages that we can ship.

Why should I pay to remove an image, no offense but it feels kind of 'spammy.' Couldn't you go with a SaaS model instead? Up-sell users on additional features?   Alternate business model: Offer your service for free. Any additional designs, crowd-source them. The web/graphic designer gets commission off every sale, you do too. Kind of like 99designs business model.  Intensity: Your landing page doesn't stand out or make me want to sign up. This an is area you can definitely improve on."

startups,3cba1s,j4390jamie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:33:06 2015 UTC,"First, if you want to use this service for a physical product, you will have to share a blogpost with an affiliate on that post. Because we want also to create value for our readers.  What does it do: You submit the link to your mobile phone case blogpost. In the create section, you will have to give a title to the link. Then you can add some hashtags if you like. But you can only use up to 140 characters. Next you will have to set a goal of supports/spreaders, time and date. Once you have enough supporters for your link, it will be shared on all the social media profiles from your supports at the same time (You can see the create section on spreadwall.com under screenshots).  How does it do it: After you have submitted your link, it will be display on the homepage and new section of the website. A reader can “spread” your link by pushing the “spread it” button. They then have to sign in with either Facebook, Twitter or Google+ and as soon as the goal is reached, will automatically posted in in their feed.  Thanks, any additional questions?"
startups,3cba1s,j4390jamie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:03:23 2015 UTC,"Alright i'm kinda getting it.  So from a users point of view whats the point, is this some form of kickstarter for products?. Because thats how i'm seeing it. Really the content 'Spreader' isn't getting anything of value from it, other than helping spread someone elses content.  With kickstarter I kinda get it, you pay for the product early (ignoring the small donation amounts), and they are able to develop it and ship it to you.   Am I getting it right, or is there something i'm missing?."
startups,3cba1s,j4390jamie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:17:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks, take a look at thunderclap.it. They are doing what you think we are doing. The difference between us and them is, that we are spreading articles, videos and other links, but they are sharing product launches and events."
startups,3cba1s,wheatclove,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:28:16 2015 UTC,"So other than them being foucsed on products, how does your work, is it the same principle of kickstarter, you list a product and your goals, if it receives those goals, all the social media interactions are released?.  Also why articles, videos and links?, why would someone support that?, I get the products, but videos, articles and other links don't seem to be the same for me.  Also once again what is in it for the customer?, I understnad the appeal for the client, but why would the customer be interested in promoting these articles, videos and other links?  On top of that how is this monetized?, are you planning to charge the content creator/client?, ad based source of revenue?, charge the customer?, I highly doubt that.  I don't mean to be a dick, but i'm asking you the same questions an investor might ask you, because right now as a potential customer, I don't understand your site, I don't understand the appeal for me, and I don't understand how it would generate money."
startups,3cba1s,LeanLearner,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:40:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, these are exactly the questions we want to hear. Yes, once the goal is reached the link will be shared by all the supporters at the same time.   Why articles and links: You are surely reading and sharing lots of links daily. So why wouldn’t you want to share interesting stuff together and so having much more power over the content and also helping the authors?  We will monetize it with promoted links and there is also space for a freemium model, for example the support for campaigns.  We can create value on both sides, because bloggers and  publishers can spread their content further and readers can find the best links from their favorite authors."
startups,3cba1s,mrcrassic,2,Mon Jul 6 19:02:22 2015 UTC,"So why the hold up on the releasing likes or shares?. In short you're a news outlet posting interesting articles, but instead of users individually clicking like or share, you hold off your shares until a certain number.   Apart of me understands that it may work because it might become a 'game like' model in which because there is a combination effort it gets more traffic and customers. But its going to be a really hard sell. Not only that but I really doubt it will generate any signifcant income in a short period of time, but I could be wrong, who knows.   All i'm saying is break down that idea more, figure out how to captivate a broader audience, while being able to generate income now."

startups,3c9ba6,PsychMarketing,5,Mon Jul 6 17:36:36 2015 UTC,"Both of the commas in the delivery section of the front page are unnecessary. And in the about section, there's a bad comma after ""Those who committed to the winner..."" It's one of my pet peeves, so I noticed it immediately.  Anyway, I like the idea I'd try to find some rarer items. The things you have are cool, but I've seen the wine sippy cup around a bunch, as well as the clock fan.  As for where to market, you have to think about that. Who would be interested in something like that? Something that cheap is cheap enough to qualify for impulse buy status, but the difficulty is that they aren't really buying anything directly. They don't get the rush of ""hell yeah, I just bought something awesome!"" And it will often take an extra long time for them to receive it (though this is the lesser issue).  Even so, I think those people would find this appealing. Read into impulse buyers to find out how to structure your site and capitalize on their habits.  The research I've done on impulse buyers indicates that they buy to improve their mood, whether it be boredom, anger, sadness, etc. You need to pick the kind of quirky products that make people smile just from seeing them. Elevating their mood is the best way to get them to buy your crap.  So if bored/upset people are your target market, try advertising on social media. People who spend a lot of time on social media are typically less satisfied with their lives, and they're often bored at the time. Facebook Boost is good because it's really, really cheap, but it's also not the most effective. It's probably still worth it. Twitter isn't worth it, I don't think, unless you just want to go for the grassroots, nonpaid route where you just post quirky, funny, interesting tweets. Then you can try just organically posting on imgur, try some forums, etc. To build up the initial user base, you'll need to do nonscalable things.  Also, PROMOTIONS. 80% of impulse buys occur because of sales. Your items are already pretty cheap, but to drive up initial interest, discount codes are a good idea."

startups,3c9ba6,LukeFitzpatrick,3,Mon Jul 6 12:27:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, it appears to be fixed."
startups,3c9ba6,cinemafest,3,Mon Jul 6 13:24:46 2015 UTC,"You may be best to take a step back and redefine your marketing strategy.   This is what I'd do: 1) Take your product offline temporary if you don't have enough users (if it's less than 20). Go out and ask your friends and people in your network 'how' to make it better. Find 100 people that will use it and test it for you. Then, focus on making them love it.   2) Set up social media: Twitter, Facebook etc. And, don't abandon it like a lot of startups do. Have a strategy on 'who' you are targeting and what content you want to share. On your page, you have the social media icons, but they do not connect to any pages as of yet.   3) Consider creating a Facebook group. I'm creating one for Startup AMA's to run a test. If anyone wants to join, email me at lukejamesfitzpatrick@gmail.com - for your purposes, I'd use it to target the products you want to share & have members of your community suggest them + comment. Target influencers for this group, they can help you determine which products might fit well on your service.   4) Set up a landing page, A/B test the web copy do see what converts best for signups. I think you have to run more tests.   5) Put your landing page on Betalist, you should expect to get around 400 signups + if your service suits their audience.   6) Submit your site to StartupLister. This is a startup directory of 40 startup sites for beta testers/ reviews. Costs I think $50, or you can look at their directory lists and submit manually to skip the charge.  7) Try Product Hunt. If you are successful to get featured, you will definitely see a large traffic/ signup boost.   8) The honesty curve: Your family and friends are likely to give you honest feedback BUT only when it's free. If they have to pay for it, the feedback is often biased. Something to consider.   9) Who is your target market? Which type of products? Which country? What city? For example, my service, College Brand Ambassadors for Startups. If I targeted worldwide to start with, I'd have a much higher percentage to fail. However, if I target one specific location, like New York (which I am) and focus on that, and grow it - it becomes much easier to grow & manage. Think like Facebook, one college campus at a time. Or Youtube, musicians and leveraging MySpace. And, Quora, targeting VC's in the Bay. The trick, choose a small market, within a large market.    10) Tip: When you do launch, spend $20 on Facebook Boost, and write a post on your Facebook Page Wall announcing your launch. A friend of mine did this, and got 1,183 likes which is awesome, some signups and payable users. On the downside, he made a spelling error + a grammar mistake in the promotion :( This idea would work well if you were featured on Betalist or Product Hunt to increase your exposure."
startups,3c9ba6,mjwb99,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:26:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. This has been helpful. I am seeing a lot of traffic from reddit, but I'm starting to think the concept can be more refined in how it is explained to the user...  I know some people who have been featured on product hunt, so hopefully i can get listed there with an invite.  I'm going to also try to get listed on all the sites you listed.  For #10, did you post to your own personal facebook page or to your startup's page?"
startups,3c9ba6,LeanLearner,2,Mon Jul 6 13:55:29 2015 UTC,"No worries! I actually wrote a post on this recently because my friend did a similar thing to you. Here is the link: http://www.slideshare.net/LukeJamesFitzpatrick/startup-launch   The point im trying to stress with the PPT, their is usually a launch process. First Betalist, then Startuplister, last Product Hunt... If u skip these steps it's much harder to get featured as nobody knows about your startup... Didn't want to post the slides to the group as it can be improved and my comment might of looked like spam.   With number ten... this was done to the startups facebook page, you can check it out: jobcv.me on FB - this is not mine, im just an advisor for them + help out with some marketing. So, if u do get featured on Betalist/ Product Hunt, id pay the fee to advertise on FB via Boost.  I got CodeCloud.me and RocketClub.co featured on PH via Bram - they also have a slack group: PHglobal  I'm really good at Twitter marketing and suck at FB, if u know any startup that's interested in doing a marketing swap - please let them know!

However, what became a major concern was that they were going to send me shoddy products via Alibaba. I have a friend who works with Chinese manufacturing who is going to help me with quality assurance, as he has people IN China, so that made me decide to follow through with the idea.  I don't think that the fact that these are mostly novelty items is an issue. I for one would buy both of the listed products if I only paid literally $10."
startups,3c9ba6,PastaHenk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:06:58 2015 UTC,That's a fair concern. I also considered finding US sourced products that can just fit under that price range where the brand is willing to do such a deal for exposure and promotion. However this is really only possible if I can build up a huge customer list. That said would it make sense for the small brand if my list was big enough?
startups,3c9ba6,captain_obvious_here,2,Tue Jul 7 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"This is very cool  My advice would be to run this ""test"" of the concept, and if/when it goes well (major kinks worked out) start sending it around to tech blogs.  Also. Keep in mind that promotion/marketing/etc is an entire artform unto itself. Twitter had only 5k registered users for most of their first year and only started scaling when they started making some very creative moves to promote. SXSW 2006 for example"

startups,3c9ba6,chipsandbiscuits,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:16:17 2015 UTC,"Im a big fan of advertising and marketing for software/websites in real life. I believe it gives people the feeling that it's real, and most non tech savvy people need that. Flyers can be terrible if badly designed and handed out without discrimination, or they can be great if targeted and interesting.  So find out where your target audience hangs out. To me, this is really just a bit of fun gamble rather than a way to shop, so target gamblers (on that note I would suggest you make it more of a gamble, ie one team 'wins' a $10 item for $5 and the other 'loses' buy purchasing shipping or something like that).  If you have casinos or anywhere that people can go to gamble, post up flyers there. They will be taken down so go back regularly.  Otherwise universities, kids there are always looking for ways to procrastinate and word spreads."
startups,3c9ba6,maxxam87,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:31:41 2015 UTC,"The only problem I have is that you are stuck with the $10 price point because of the name. Coming up with a new offering every day will be difficult. You're obviously not going to lose your shirt on anything so that rules out items that cost you more than $8 and you will have to include cheaper items so I just assume I'm not really getting a good deal typically.  Still, I like the concept and I think it will word-of-mouth very well."
startups,3c9ba6,CX3,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:41:37 2015 UTC,"I'm really interested to hear where the money is coming from this - because I'm assuming you're getting these from somewhere super cheap, like alibaba or something?    There is definitely something here - as far as an idea/concept is concerned... but it's just off a little bit.  Maybe because it's a weekly thing - maybe you'll be able to do it daily.  There are a lot of things you could split test with this - like doing a new item daily, maybe letting the public see the vote (either as a count, or just as a percentage of which side is winning) - granted it'll make more people potentially buy the cheaper item - but - that depends on what your margin is currently at with the $8/item.  The other thing you could do - is charge $10... right away - and ship the item right away...   Then if the item they bought wins after a day/week, you give them a $2 credit towards their next purchase... This way you can collect money immediately, ship immediately (my hold up with this site, would be that I'd have to wait over a week before being charged and getting my item - look at Amazon... I can buy something and receive it tomorrow if I want... try to get closer to that model)...  But Getting a $2 credit on their account - could make it an interesting model... it would help promote the idea of ""purchase more"" - At that point, I know... If I buy 5 items, I'll eventually get my 6th one for free... you can give people the option to pay with credit or with their card on file...  You have a really good idea here, it just needs a tweak...."

I just think there are some things I can help with. An example is that his feedback to the intern was mostly negative all week. There was no training. After he left the office one day I could see he was not feeling it from his body language. So, me and said manager got into a healthy debate on training vs doing. I debated that training was necessary (our first day we were making calls, no script or product training) for someone without sales experience. This led to me going home, drafting a script and helping the intern. He got better! We both want the same result. Im just trying to find a way to do it in a way that lets my manager 'save face.'

startups,3c8vch,spacemanJ,4,Mon Jul 6 07:53:42 2015 UTC,"Tough situation. It definitely sounds like your intentions are pure but unless you were brought in specifically to influence/change the culture then you definitely need to clear those types of emails with everyone above you. They might be of the opinion that there's nothing wrong with their current culture and then you coming off looking like a jerk. I'm not saying it's right but from experience with start-up egos, a lot of these people think they're infallible.  Can I also state how much I despise culture mandated work hours? I hate them. Not everyone has the same productivity peak times and duration so why make everyone be there for exactly the same hours. I personally like to work 8 hours straight, very little chit-chatting, no long lunches, no long walks and then get the fuck out of there. I use the subway ride and dinner with my wife as time to clear my head and gain some new perspective on things I was having difficulty with at work. Then around 8 or 9 I'll jump back in and put in some more time with a refreshed take on things. Some people like to leave work at work, i get that, but after working for 15+ years I've figured out how to get the most out of my time and structure it in the most beneficial way. My apologies if that doesn't fit into your culture (which I can guarantee will lead to burnout)."

As far as hours go. . I do an extracurricular activity 3-4 times a week but I am the same way as you. Being in sales means I cannot call people at 6PM with a productive connect rate. I can send emails, organize my CRM, etc. But most times after I get home and relax a bit, I find myself doing research or working on something company related. I really do love business and figuring out startups. Im kinda obsessed. Unfortunately, the other intern they hired had no idea what startup hours were and he has a 90 minute commute! I went to lunch with him the following day so I could hear his concerns, he was quite shocked to say the least. After a good talk and me selling him on the vision he seemed better all week.

Instead of listening to your advice and experience, they let their pride get in the way and felt like you were ""stepping on toes"".  A start up flourishes because of people like you who bring in initiative and insight.

I did get a response from my email about culture and we have a meeting setup this week. The CEO has stated he wants to empower people and believes everyone has greatness.

In which as we were leaving my manager let me know that the culture is to stay til 630-7PM. So, culture hadn't been communicated.  Now that were hiring like wildfire, I would like to prevent that! I think the best course of action would be to talk to the founder directly and tell him that I didn't know the team's core values and the companies mission statement.

This is a very popular idea in Brazil and I'd like to expand it more here.   I don't know if I said anything here about an app, but ideally once we have office space, the app would be used to check assignments, schedule class (private and group class) and for attendance, where we could scan a barcode on the student's phone at the start of class and the payment would be made electronically.

But to give you a bit more information:   Preferred shares: these kinds of shares are the ones that get paid first. Say there's a buyout and the company is dissolved. People with preferred shares are the first to get paid back, which means their investment is lower risk. Investors will typically demand preferred shares. Voting shares: what it sounds like Common stock: you just have equity, no special privileges. You're the bottom of the barrel. Though it's worth saying that most very early stage startups will only have common stock."

startups,3c9wm1,nebuchadnezzer1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:18:21 2015 UTC,"Personally speaking, this is what I'd do:  1) Don't take the offer unless they have experience in your field or are willing to help. They are just after money with deadweight, and if they don't care - then the relationship will not be useful.  2) Partnership: Since your line is fragrance technologies, which I assume, some kind of perfume. I'd be looking to either partner with another company that is more well-known and sell one of your items to them under their name. Of course, it will be discounted but will allow you to scale and grow much faster with less risk.   3) Investors: I'd be looking to seek some kind of investor that is either well-known in fashion or film. 25% for 100K is a huge stake in the company and will hurt you in the long run. However, if this came from someone in fashion or film, it will benefit you immensely. Since you are based in India, I'd be looking for an investor within this criteria to endorse your product but also invest in it. A win-win situation.   4) Don't take any investment and look for creative ways to market your product instead. Read Paul Graham's essays on ""Doing things that don't scale"", and see if you can come up with some ideas. Or, try creating a growth hack team, and dish out some small amounts of equity. Read about/ watch Sean Ellis on his ICE method for evaluating growth ideas.   A personal note: I once had an option to get an investment from a small VC firm, I turned them down - and it was the best decision I've ever made as they offered me a bad deal."

(Just waiting/confirming steps).   WordPress can be hosted on any web host you want, or just WordPress.com (though I have no experience with them).   I'm not currently using wordpress as my current projects are using django/node but hosting will depend on your requirements. For a low traffic site you can probably get away with shared hosting from DreamHost, media temple, a small orange, Host gator, 1&1, or one of the many, many other web hosts out there.   Eventually you'll want to upgrade to a VPS, dedicated servers, or cloud hosting services like Amazon EC2 but those require much more configuration and management to work properly.

I think your best options are Squarespace or Shopify. These are Canadian prices, US prices are likely a little lower:  Squarespace starts at $12/month for a site that lets you sell one product. Next plan up is $25/month.   Shopify has a starter plan for $14/month that lets you sell up to 25 products, and the next plan is $29/month.  Both services use Stripe for payments and start with a 2.9% + 30¢ transaction fee. Shopify's higher plans reduce the fees, while Squarespace's stay the same regardless of your plan. From that perspective, Shopify will end up being a better deal when you are selling at a higher volume. Shopify also has numerous ""apps"" that you can connect to your shop that give you additional features or connect your shop to third party services like mailchimp.

Do you want a nice, modern looking website with a couple touches of your own and so easy to manipulate if you don't want it to look ""generic""? Go with WordPress. It'll take you at least a day to get the hang of how all the tools in WP work, including how to install themes you can buy at ThemeForest (which has tons of themes you can choose from), how to install plugins (thousands of these), and how  to use certain tools to your advantage in terms of getting things to go to a certain place. WordPress gives you more control and in the long run, it's a good investment. However, it's time consuming and at times you'll feel like ripping your hair out. It really comes down to how you want to approach it. If I were you, considering you don't even have a product yet, I'd set up a quick okay-looking website with Squarespace and use that to show off the MVP version of your product.

I used them years ago but saw the light when their support for SOPA was made public and tons of people suggested better alternatives.  I personally recommend using someone like ClouDNS or Google Domains to register your domain with and then using Squarespace to set up your website, especially if your product is physical.

Urban Dictionary doesn't have to add the definitions themselves, the community does that, and saying that definition of words can be copyrighted is questionable. If that were true, why could this site host those definitions and no one else could? I just don't understand that point.  My point is more that Urban Dictionary could easily squash this startup by just adding a feature that groups together all definition and words related to a genre or tags, like Silicon Valley or Dr Who, etc. I get if this is just a fun site, but it's not a startup and could do better as a Tumblr page"

If you give the product away for free for alpha users, it devalues it. But more than losing paying customers, I find that the bigger damage is you not being able to get the right insights from the testing. I have seen many businesses give trial offers for free to get these insights, but paying and evaluating a product tends to give better results.  We decided to sweeten the deal by offering trade discounts and bundled it with free training.  In addition, we are doing the whole sales thing and making a formal pitch for their business."

Is that right?  You're not asking whether you should charge your alpha users, but I'm going to encourage you to charge your alpha users. The whole point of your product is to provide value to people. And in exchange for that value, they give you currency.  By charging your alpha users, you can get some really great immediate feedback. Whether people will pay. You don't have to charge what you're going to charge in the future, and you can refund the money to anyone who has a bad experience, but if you don't charge, you're missing out on a really important piece of feedback.  Additionally, users who are paying give better feedback. They have some skin in the game. They actually care about your product working. Most of the users who aren't paying don't really care if you're solving a problem for them or not. They'll sign up because the barrier to do so is so low. More than likely, they never would have been your customer after your hard launch, and so their feedback is meaningless.  I'm starting to ramble a little bit, and I'm kind of rehashing an article my business partner wrote a while back. And I'm not even answering your question. :P  So to answer your question as I understand it, hustle for your first users. Just reach out to them. Post your shit where they read about things. Engage them on twitter. Use your scraping magic. Your first version of marketing copy is just a guess until you talk to customers, and ask them lots of questions about what problem you solve."

Having worked in commercial HVAC systems, you can easily get better gains on your home system by changing your air filter more often, cleaning your heat exchangers and ensuring your system has enough refrigerant.

Motorola had $3bn in cash at the time Google purchased it. Also there were other tax assets (reportedly up to about $2.5bn) as well.

Sure, that's a lot of acquisition money for a single product company, but remember that Google's ad revenue has been dropping in recent years while Facebook's continues to grow. The most access points wins. Being able to go to Ford/General Mills/P&G and tell them they can guarantee to reach their audiences when they're at their most vulnerable is a huge advantage. Facebook and others can tell you where someone is and, on occasion, what they're doing (video uploads, activity-based posts, etc). Google has the ability to tell you all of that plus all of the data that home automation collects. When you add in cameras, wireless speakers, tragedy-based data points (smoke, fire, & carbon monoxide detectors), consumables-based access points (refrigerators, trash cans and toilets) and on and on...

These points are the following-- ""But a great company is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future"" and ""the value of a business is the sum of all the money it will make in the future"". I don't personally keep up with Nest/home automation devices, but my guess is that Google saw the inevitable rise in home automation/smart homes in the future and wanted to be armed with what they saw was their ""best bet"" to enter the market once it came into fruition. Add that to the fact that the smart home market is set to be a $71 billion dollar market by 2018 and it's clear that Google bought Nest because it would be valuable once the smart-home trend kickstarts -- so as Peter Thiel said, the value of Nest is in the future. Keep in mind that Apple also just released its first smart home devices (HomeKit) and that Google is notorious for releasing technology that's been too early for the market and thus flopped (Glass, Google Wallet, and Google Health) while Apple released identical technology shortly after and succeeded. They both want to time the market just right so they take the largest market share they can before the other once the smart home market booms; so again, the value is in the future."

startups,3c6qr8,Alcoholic_zeebra,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:16:19 2015 UTC,"I'm the founder of a startup in this industry and know a fair bit about the strategy behind it. There were a few reasons for the valuation (I believe it was roughly 10X gross annual sales).  Here are a couple of the top reasons behind it.   Excellent equity, funding, and valuation structure. They set the company up for acquisition from day 1.  Google wanted a foot in the energy market after both them and Microsoft miserably failed with their monitoring technologies. (Power meter and Hohm). They had terrible adoption and market penetration. Data/Control value: Decentralized energy and demand response is a huge future market. Being able to control the largest consumer of energy within homes, is worth billions in itself. Honeywell has kept their monopoly and prevented innovation by purchasing competitors or burying them in lawsuits. Otherwise, they are not able to compete.  Track record of founders are excellent. They wanted the team more than they cared about the product. The product itself is a 6/10. Gives them entry into the IoT market. Clean tech is the fastest growing industry in North America."
startups,3c6qr8,Technologian,2,Mon Jul 6 01:03:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with the IoT reasoning. And with the introduction of Brillo you can see Google putting the puzzle pieces together. Now you have a IoT OS and a hardware IoT company that can make products that integrate it. Additionally, having Tony Fadell control your hardware design is a major plus."
startups,3c8jg2,tophercurtis,2,Sun Jul 5 22:16:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure from your post what you feel is your limiting factor for growth at the moment. Are you having trouble getting new users, or are they churning out; are your costs too high? etc. Knowing that would help zero in on some strategies. But here are some loose thoughts without having tried you out:  Direction (option 1): Everyone is using Slack. You should determine if your platform has any obvious integration points with Slack, and code up an integration for it. Slack does team communication very well; I know there's likely overlap there, but the Project, Time and Task tracking options of Slenke might work nicely for a team that's already using Slack. An integration and listing within Slack will get more eyeballs on your platform.  Direction (option 2): based on your current userbase or your own perception, what feature is the number one feature for your platform? Is it feasible to simplify your platform and focus on only doing one or two things really well and integrating with other platforms for the rest? This has a few advantages: you'll simplify your value proposition and messaging for new customers; you'll simplify your codebase; you'll be able to better focus your marketing efforts. It may seem extreme, but if you succeed then the number of users you'll have in the future will be a huge multiple of the ones you have right now.  Name: I am not a huge fan of the name, sorry. I don't feel like it resonates with what you're offering. Mentally I'm saying ""Slinky"" which I think probably has all the wrong connotations.  Site: I like your site. I think the blue/grey gradient background behind the pricing section is a mistake though. It feels like a bit of a dead colour. The ""Start Free Trial"" buttons need to pop much more. They're grey on white. Make them stand out more. Between your various links and buttons you have about 6 shades of blue going on. See if you can unify them. Your Twitter link 404s. On your contact page the headline says ""Got question about Slenke?""; you need an ""a"" there between ""Got"" and ""question"".  Pricing: You're scaling by users and also by two features: the support plan (Premium vs Priority) and the number of projects: 50/100/unlimited. I have some thoughts here but it only makes sense to dig into them if you think your growth problem is related to pricing. You could simplify here again if it made sense or else experiment with different approaches/bundles.  Hope that helps; happy to take a more specific look if it makes sense."
startups,3c8jg2,randommultiplier,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:06:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you for you comment, we are are looking at  multiple integration's currently and Slack is definitely one of them and I agree with your opinion there.  One of the reason we developed this software was to have a integrated platform which was almost our virtual office that we could use for all of our day to day work rather than having to buy multiple subscriptions and having to login to different software that was one of the major pain point for us. All the features are very interconnected, for example communication and collaboration directly effects project management which kicks starts time track and which feeds into invoicing.   I appreciate your honesty about the name, Slenke is bird whose name is pronounced as Sl-en-k we thought it was good name because a bird needs all of its wings to properly fly and we have a system with multiples modules and our system needs all of them to give the best value to our users.  Which page did you find the 404 link for twitter ?  Our growth problem is currently users because we are new and trying to reach out to as many companies as we can.   again many thanks."
startups,3c8jg2,hamza_warraich,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:21:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the additional detail! The 404 link for Twitter is in the footer on the main page. It goes to https://twitter.com/Slenke_ instead of https://twitter.com/SlenkeHQ  Most enterprises use a mishmash of services, so I understand the value that a comprehensive platform suite can bring. The flip side of that though is that you're asking prospective customers to go ""all in"" on your platform, and that is a difficult proposition for medium to large organizations because they have entrenched ways of doing things within their teams, and asking them to change everything is challenging. It works better for small and newer organizations, but they're going to be much more price sensitive, so again it's a difficult pitch. One of the reasons that Slack is doing so well is because they can function as the glue to make a bunch of diverse systems work for a team within a single space. They are solving the same problem you are, with a different approach that doesn't mean a company needs to change multiple systems at once.  You should try to identify where in the acquisition funnel to direct your short term efforts. If your traffic conversion rate is ok, then it's a case of marketing, so you may want to look at running ads (if you're not) to increase traffic. If your traffic is ok but your conversion rate is low, then you can try running A/B tests to change things like button and background colors, text, font size, maybe even experiment with pricing and the number of options you present.  In parallel, I think you should determine what your killer feature currently is and put together a roadmap for making it the best offering in that space."
startups,3c8jg2,randommultiplier,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:36:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for pointing out the twitter link its fixed now :)  Also really appreciate your advice and comments, we knew coming into this market that it will be challenging to get medium and large business on the system immediately because of there dependence on systems they are already using. So we have to develop integration that will let those medium and large enterprise either transfer their data to our system from their old system or make them work together. We will developing those integrations to make it easy for them to move to Slenke.   In mean while We have to attract small businesses, we are the most cost effective solution available on the market at the moment for what we offer, if you compare prices of our first paid package with Slack we are almost $2 cheaper than them per user.  Our conversion rate is great problem is traffic right now for sure which I am trying to address. You are right we will have to pride our self on one trademark feature and rest comes along with it.  Also, great suggestion about 'Start free Trail' button already implemented :)"

startups,3c8jg2,fatmoocow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:46:09 2015 UTC,"Hey Guys,  I am founder of Slenke, I developed Slenke because I was tired of having to buy, manage and organize multiple subscriptions to manage my day to day activities at my company. We used Yammer for communication, Basecamp for project/task management, fresh books for invoicing and harvest for time tracking. It was simply inefficient so we decided to develop our own software which would be the only software we would have to use to communicate, manage projects, task, track time, and invoice essentially a virtual office which you can carry with you and all time. It keeps everyone at the company up to date about what going on with project they are working on or anything else from anywhere and whenever.  Our sweet spot is definitely services companies such as web development, marketing and consulting firm because we cover all the basic functions of this target market from collaboration to project management to time tracking and to invoicing.

startups,3c8jg2,hamza_warraich,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:30:47 2015 UTC,"What I'd do:  Focus on Privacy: Slack is great but still buggy and easily hacked. I saw someone hack Slack in 20 mins (shocked), good product, security sucks.   Leverage: See if you can land a big partnership with a company & leverage their status to increase yours.   Pricing: Have you run enough tests to validate it? I think this is your biggest weakness in your product. I'd personally want to try it out for free - which I can do on other platforms - of course with limited features. Due to pricing options, it doesn't give people the option to 'try it for free', which means your growth will be ONLY 'organic.' Meaning, your service will only grow by word-of-mouth & users will REALLY have to love your service to recommend it when it's payable. What I would do: possible make it for free for startups/SMB's, and only charge large corporations - but of course, this would depend on your target market. Or look for an alternative business model.    Web copy/ UX/ UI: I'd consider giving it an upgrade. Focus on simplification.

Right now a 30 day trial is available, but we are looking at introducing a free package in future which will allow users to only to start few projects. For a startup with limited cash its really hard to offer a free package, but it is definitely a driver for growth.

Have you considered any alternative biz models? Example like Zenefits. For example, what my startup does, college brand ambassadors for startups. I don't charge students or startups, it's free. I found another way to make money.   This is a lecture from Harvard ilabs on disruptive business models/ partnerships. its really long, i watched it 3 times before it 'sunk in' & now i can apply some of the concepts. That's how i came up with the idea of making it free for my users, and finding another way to make money = high growth curve. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Eu6cL0BR8  With partnerships, you can make partnerships at any time, even before you have a built product, I've done this, just don't be scared to try. Once you land one, your confidence will go up & it's becomes easier to get more. Another option, add on a new feature that is different from your current product that gives some extra benefit & make money by selling that and make Slenke free instead.   Cashwise, its really hard in startups. I just had to sell all of my things, got accepted to a startup accelerator, but i cannot go as im too bootstrapped (this is with another startup i work at, CodeCloud.me) - having interviews in Sydney to find a paying job in the mean time.

I don't know what kind of company you have, but investors are there to evaluate how much risk there is, and ultimately gauge how much money they think they can make by giving you money.

What I'm thinking:   Better website - there are lots of good product landing pages and templates out there to emulate. Right now it looks like something for a not-so-popular open source software package, such as http://izpack.org/ or http://www.tryton.org/ The introduction video is FUBAR right now. It is too long, contains too much cruft (how-to-use should be left for another video), the font for text doesn't fit the purpose, the text should actually be replaced with narration. I think the gold goal in this space is something like Square or Erply have done for their videos. Basically, just try to show the main use case anyone should use your app for.

startups,3c6mp3,nothingtoworryabout,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:36:36 2015 UTC,"Basically yes, my idea is to have a 'remote control' for waiter or services offered by particular place. Lot of young people have smart phones with internet connection I am sure they will use it. This is really common in Japan where restaurants have 'call buttons' on tables. I have created a software version of it so places do not need to invest into hardware but can simply just mark their tables with number and use my system.   I see. My idea for landing page was create a simple one - to describe what does it do in as few words as possible so people do not need to invest their time into long reading. But probably it would be better to write more and use some fancy template :) I know video is not that good but I work on the whole thing alone and I am not perfect at everything. I am gonna make shorter video and put how-to-use to different one. Yep narration would be great maybe I should look for a designer. Just the thing is that I am burning my savings to this so I really need to think how to invest the money. I used to live in Canada and there are lot of big restaurants. The problem was when we were with friends we had to wait long while a waiter passed by and sometimes they did not notice that we raised our hands. And I see that as a problem in more places for example in Europe sometimes the waiters come and ask if we want something while we not and when we need them they are not around. So I haven't done any research I just think that this would be a great tool to have. I have travelled the world and I can notice this problem almost everywhere."

startups,3c48p9,mrcrassic,-2,Sun Jul 5 01:54:05 2015 UTC,"Hijacking your comment (sorry.)  But I definitely recommend ""The Millionaire Fastlane"" by MJ DeMarco for newer entrepreneurs like myself.  It does a great job of getting you in the mindset of being a producer versus a consumer, and starting to think in terms of ""how can I add value"" instead of ""how do I make $2000/month?""  The only negative thing I can really say about the book is that I think he focuses on passivity a bit too much. Passivity as a goal is important, depending on your personal goals of course, but I also think it's important to work your ass off in the early days of yor company.

So then I questioned the validity of the rest of his stuff because he had been so wrong about something that I do happen to know a lot about, and a lot of his stuff is really to sell his book.   The four hour chef isn't great as a cookbook or a learning tool he says other books will have you buy tones of equipment then asks you to do the same, his first few chapters are great but the cooking section isn't very good.   Admittedly the four hour work week has made me more efficient at work and stress free 80/20 and time blocking emails etc. so he's not all bad, I thought he was awesome till he made that claim about building muscle and then had to question everything else he'd said"

I felt it was kind of cheesy, that I didn't learn a lot and wasn't that practical (or incredibly interesting, really), but for a reason I ignore, I read it cover to cover in like 2 days.  Maybe because it's full of short chapters, I don't know, but if you ever want to read something that you don't need to be 100% focussed to understand, I'd suggest it.  Also, How to Win Friends and Influence People."

For the past three months I have been discussing my idea with everyone from suppliers to friends, to potential partners and everyone in between.

startups,3c68kz,atfirstiwaslikelol,2,Sun Jul 5 05:41:51 2015 UTC,"AWS has scores of products that go beyond virtual machines. They even have CloudSearch if that is what you mean by ""search intensive"" (http://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/).  While they may not be bottom of the barrel in terms of instance pricing, AWS has tons of little extras for free or super cheap that reduce complexity. Need to add a deployment system? Just setup CodeDeploy. Need basic logging and alerts? Add CloudWatch. Everything is there so when you scale, it's ready. If you went with Heroku or Digital Ocean you get none of those things and will wind up wasting time implementing them on your own rather than working on your app."
startups,3c68kz,cddotdotslash,2,Sun Jul 5 17:33:36 2015 UTC,"Firstly, one thing I would be careful of is over-optimizing before you even have an MVP-level product/app. Focusing on getting something initially built first is more important than optimizing for thousands of queries per second when you don't have it yet.  As for what to use, it really depends; are you looking to build your own backend service, or use something out of the box like Parse? If you're comfortable building your own backend, then a database like Postgresql can go a LONG way performance-wise before you would have to move to a database built for large (we're talking millions to billions of rows) volumes of data. Both Heroku and Amazon (RDS) offer a hosted Postgres option so you dont have to manage it yourself.  You mentioned needing search capabilities; I know Postgres supports full text search, but I would highly recommend Elasticsearch as that's what it is meant to do (assuming you're searching text fields).  You'll probably have to change out components as you scale your app/service so pick whatever is easiest that can scale to a certain point that will still allow you to build out the first version of your app. Shipping something, even if it can only handle a small volume at first, is better than shipping nothing that can handle millions of users."

AWS has dozens of fully-managed services, including mobile app services that might help speed you up. You want to reduce the effort it takes for you to build.

It is also created on a platform that is provided for free without usage limits. Sure there are some ground rules, but in the end the complaint is that the free service isn't worth the money if that makes sense.  Can Reddit improve their tools? Sure. Can we have our gripes? Sure.  Can we contribute to the tools and code if they don't serve our wishes? I think so, but could be mistaken. Isn't Reddit built on an open-source platform? Isn't that what Voat et al use?"

But yes, some of reddit is open source (not all iirc, some key stuff like spam filtering is what they left out I think)  AutoModerator is a good example of an outside tool being used (it became official when they hired the guy that wrote it a while ago I believe).  I think you've also misunderstood the issue, the biggest problem is transparency and communication. It just doesn't exist between the free labor force that is the moderators and the admins who are the owners. The admins don't seem interested in listening to the moderators who actually make this whole thing work. They need the mods more than they seem to recognize to get their ad dollars (which they are doubling their ad rates if you didn't know - this month I think). It's not saying the free service isn't worth the money, it's saying we're making them money and not being listened to, in the slightest. If all the mods walked away and stopped volunteering this site would be a giant horrible mess."

It seems like the number of posts and discussions, active subs, and 24 hour usage could easily overwhelm a group as small as the 71 number I've heard tossed around. (Even with automated assistance) I mean we all know about a single employee that got let go now. How likely would that be if there were a whole team dedicated to AMA as much as she was?  Doubling their ad rates seems like an attempt at profitability to me. Not an unreasonable goal IMO. Conde Nast probably won't  pump money into it forever.  We're making them money yes, but only because they're delivering value at no monetary cost to us. Would we use the site if it was just a place to go to write code or do marketing for their benefit? They're providing a platform that is superior for our purposes here to other mediums.  I think we all want it to succeed (well, most of us anyway) or we wouldn't care."
startups,3c46rl,haltingpoint,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:02:42 2015 UTC,"It's been years with little to no improvement on the moderation front. As literally the frontline to handling almost every community here, you would think it merits some investment. But it doesn't seem to.  For a site built around community, we see very little actual participation from the admins. Back in the day I remember actually engaging with the staff. Alexis was around. Jedberg was around. Lots of the actual staff participated and actually seemed to give a shit. That... just doesn't seem to happen anymore. I have no idea what the 71 (I'll just assume your number is correct, no idea) people are actually doing. Just selling ads? They could just tell us, the users, what they are doing.  Doubling ad rates is absolutely a profitability move. It takes two minutes to update a default CPM cost? That's a move that should also have little impact on the users. But doubling is pretty huge, I expect to see more intrusive moves soon to increase profitability further. Consider the ad pricing a bellwether move. Also Conde Naste isn't piling in money, Reddit was spun out into a separate company that raised 50M from some of the biggest names in the business less than a year ago. If they are already running out of cash, they fucked up huge. Which, wouldn't be that shocking given the circumstances.  It's historically been a mutually beneficial arrangement. That relationship is being neglected by one side pretty badly lately. And the other side is pissed. We hope that it changes. I do wonder what the future holds if it doesn't."

startups,3c46rl,rftracker,3,Sat Jul 4 18:09:30 2015 UTC,"I support the decision for r/startups and any sub for that matter switching to private yesterday. I largely stay out of the reddit drama and just use this place to get informed as well as to just relax and have fun. As an owner of a medium sized company though I do take exception with how reddit seems to be making decisions as of late, at least in regard to sustainability.   I understand that this is a free platform from which we communicate but I see the distinction between a free service and a service that is free to use. Rarely do you find a free service these days, instead we make up the nuts and bolts of what Reddit sells (FB too). Essentially, we are the product that with the help of moderators and others who start and manage subs continue to create new content so that the product continues to be available to sell (to advertisers). Reddit and other social sites are successful because the products think they're the customers.   Because the content creators (Redditors) and the content managers (moderators) fuel this wonderful site, we as a collective should have the right to want the admins' decision making to be in somewhat of an alignment with ours.  Just look around at all the news outlets that use reddit as an information source to determine the value of the content you create to others, and check your browser history to see how often you choose to come back to this site as a measure of how valuable it is to you.   Even if the site chooses to censor certain subs and that doesn't affect you, or if the person who coordinates the IAMAs is let go without communicating with the affected moderators and that doesn't affect you, it's hard to deny that the site as a whole is affected. If you like the direction reddit is going in then by all means show your support but I would venture to say that the masses that make up the user-base are uneasy with the idea that Reddit is starting to look and operate as something other than what it was proposed to be. Combine this notion with poor communication from the top to the moderators (who are volunteers) and you have the makings of a relationship moving in a bad direction.  It's just my opinion but I think we should be happy to support something that makes this site more easily managed and also to protect the site from degrading away."
startups,3c46rl,rftracker,8,Sat Jul 4 21:14:12 2015 UTC,I don't understand why /r/startups has to get involved in such meta subreddit drama..   Doesn't make sense to me.
startups,3c46rl,lxaa,11,Sat Jul 4 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"As a moderator, the tools and lack of support is real.   You don't like spammers and vote manipulation? We have virtually no tools to help us remove it.  You use modmail to reach out to us? Modmail interface is terrible and there's basically no way to track interactions with users. I can just infinite scroll to maybe find our last interaction and reference it. Which is really nice when you're trying to coordinate amongst multiple moderators about long standing issues over days, weeks or months.  You get messaged constantly by users who are shadowbanned and can't really offer any legitimate help because there's no way to actually interact with admin staff. We have no real communication with admins, we've pretty much left to our own devices and helpless if it's not something our rudimentary tools can do.  You want to search for anything that's happened in moderation past? Ha. good fucking luck. Mod log goes back a month. That's it.  So, when the one employee who actually seems to give a shit about the moderators and users in the community gets fired without any reason (and rumors of being uncomfortable trying to make it too commercial), yeah, we're not happy. It's not the only reason, but it's a catalyst.  Do I think shutting it down for a day has changed Reddit? No. But I at least think it added to the showing of support from the moderators that there is a serious level of displeasure with the current system and that things need to change.  If you don't and can't understand that, well, I can't really do much more to convince you. The only way you'll learn is to moderate a community of any decent size and you will quickly understand."

Surely you could have added a paragraph to the sidebar about your disgruntledness. Or you could have had stickies at the top about it. Etc.  Why did you feel the need to hold hostage user-created content, locking out the very users who created it until you got your way?

I found it pretty helpful/informative the first 2 seasons or so, still entertaining for another 2 seasons or so and really repetitive by season 6. Half of season 6 seems to just be advertising the 'shark tank' section at some store.  At a certain point, the show just becomes a brand itself and they all have character roles they want to play. Most deals fall apart after the show anyway, usually because the sharks 'let their ego get a hold of them and get cold feet' so at the end of the day, how much actual knowledge can you get out of something 90% fake/put on.   It is great to learn questions you can expect from investors and things you should be required to know like all of your numbers such as rev/margin/customer acquisition costs.

Not saying they're lazy people, but they begin taking far less risks, sticking to patterns and they come up with catchphrases and things.  I actually liked the show until I did some reading on their backgrounds and saw how likely the deals are to fall through and how they treat other people offscreen. I think the meanest guy on the show Kevin, is the nicest in real life, another example of them playing characters.  A big portion of the later shows feature these 'Previously on Shark Tank' callbacks where they bring the person back on to basically advertise some more and try to sell the success image.   It's just not real enough compared to the stories you can find on /r/Entrepreneur and some of the other related subs or podcasts out there.  I actually wouldn't mind if they did a spinoff following the companies more closely, showing the day to day operations, what worked and what didn't work.

For the peole, man). After 15 minutes of painful meetings you could see dawning on them they just flew half way across the world to listen to a guy talk about nothing.  In another agency we had loads of fun. The boss drove an old porsche and would start his day with a big joint. Good intentions but just clueless on how to run an agency. Through family connections he got some very big clients that kept the agency afloat. He’d invite the whole company to his amazing house and get everyone drunk and high.  On my second day there he decided he’s had enough of this pesky server that (in house!) hosted ALL our client’s stuff, so he goes and presses the boot button like 10 times in 30 seconds. Thing crashes and it takes some consultants two weeks to try to recover it all while discovering multiple mallwares and spam bots.  One of the managers had a serious drink and coke problem and basically smoked crack at work. They would go out for lunch, get wasted, drink whole bottles of liquor and then show up shitfaced and pass out in the meeting room or with their head in the toilet bowl. At 2PM on a Wednesday. We’d take pictures of them through the keyholes for fun.  One day we showed up to see all the hardware got robbed out of the office, probably an inside job.  A hottie graphic designer and myself started fucking in the meeting rooms and now she’s my girlfriend who I love like no other.  Good times."

I think the most i have had is 2 interviews. 1 interview followed by a programming test is the most common selection process in my own personal experience.  Maybe its a regional thing.

As long as you're not removing any service from them, you don't need to tell them anything now.  If you planned to remove it, I'd indicate a free period, like a trial, ""this plan free for 6 months.""  Otherwise, when the time comes, simply say, ""Hey, we offer a premium service now...with it you get x, y, z as well as what you already get.  Don't worry, we're still going to maintain your account if you don't upgrade but you'll lose out on the new features.""  That's more than sufficient in my opinion.  Besides, iterating on price is important.  That means changing what features come in each plan, etc.  So never think of your pricing as ""set in stone.""

We all know the history behind amazon starting in books, and Facebook starting as a social site for a targeted student audience.

When users tap in, they get from the current date on (continuous feed as RSS feed data gets submitted), but if the interface they're using browses back in time, they reconnect to the swam with an older piece request date.  Sort of implements USENET, but with the request for resends automated.  The time series aspect also allows the end user app to use data science techniques to preen the feed of spam, duplicates and reposts (or maybe just combines or tags them).  Comments, chat, messaging and karma would work in a similar manner, but would have a monetary mechanism for insuring quality (in fact, you could argue that users who cash their *coin out for real money receive more hard karma because they've accepted a monetary community reward for their contributions).  Bots would run at each end user's level and would talk amongst themselves in a sort of automated meta-karma system.  The time series torrent would allow for content contributions from participating nodes in the swarm that would add to the torrent (thus the idea of a never ending torrent... not to be confused with a quine)"

startups,3bvw4s,ih8hdmi,22,Thu Jul 2 18:32:03 2015 UTC,It's a good test by fire. Raising money means you gave enough confidence into your potential for revenue that a well known firm is willing to take a huge risk into funding you. The VC also puts his name into the game.

I view it like a necessary curse. Having to give up a large chunk of the company for cash changes the underlying core of a business. Shifting it typically away from passions to profits. Not that profits are bad but it's not the end all be all. Much more interesting things are created from passion projects (and ultimately more useful things).

However, I do think it's important to also understand the interests of other people, and why they pursue certain things.   If some startup gets a good valuation, and goes in fast to get an IPO. The founders can sell equity from that company on the stock market, without having the company to be a success ( except for its valuation ).  This is a brilliant way to make a lot of money, but it also does seem to have quite a toxic effect on all other entrepreneurs and the ""startup industry"".

Many employment agreements have clauses that makes employee generated IP the property of the employer. In the U.S., this may mean, for example, the code you generate is work-for-hire and automatically belongs to the employer, or that you are required to assign the rights to your inventions to your employer. Many people incorrectly advise that if you work on project at home, after work, without using work equipment, then you are generally safe. This view tends to come out of a partial understanding of California's state law, that provides a degree of protection to employees (See California Labor Code Sections 2870-2872). California's lenient rules are not the norm.

But, for example, it was possible to predict that the picture of Victoria on the front page would get loads of attention once it had a tiny bit of traction (and in this case on reddit had some upvotes) - leading to million clicks and an increase of mentions all over the web. It's news that you and I can predict, and no need for the top 10 tips. See what i'm getting at here? If this process was possible to build as an AI we have a prediction tool."

You could probably find some correlation when examining posts that have gone viral, like the Victoria photo for example. But even with those findings, I don't think it will have an impact on creating future content and substantially increasing the chances of it going viral. There are simply too many factors that go into creating a viral post.  Don't get me wrong, I definitely think you should further investigate this concept.

If you're just building the software that the client will then take over, you don't charge monthly you charge for the project (which can be broken down into monthly payments if it's a large amount).

startups,3bvnan,redditneight,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:02:40 2015 UTC,"No you wouldn't charge them a setup fee before its built. But if you're building this software specifically for a client, then there should be up front fees.  There's basically two ways this works:   Client requests they want software built for their SaaS business. You estimate what it would cost to build the software, charge them a percentage up front, then the balance at the end (or a percentage up front and a monthly amount after that until the project is complete if it's a large project). When the project is completed the client takes over the software entirely and you get no further payments. You have an SaaS business which your client is interested in using. You should already have the software built before on-boarding this client. You charge them an initial set up fee then normal recurring monthly payments.   It sounds to me like the first scenario is most likely what you're dealing with, in which case it doesn't matter if it's SaaS or just a static website - you're just building software and should be billing it as a software project, not as a SaaS business."

He told me that in 15 years, he's never been screwed over.  When I asked him why he'd take such a big risk, he told me that his sales process naturally selects for the right kinds of clients. In conversing with leads, asking questions, and pitching his services, only those who are truly right for him end up signing with him. Only those who could truly derive value from his services end up hiring him. He told me he went from an 80% close rate (meaning once he gets to the proposal meeting, not from any kind of lead) to a much lower rate. But he makes more money, he's happier, and his clients are happier.  A rule of thumb he gave me was to obey the client triangle and NEVER settle for less than 2 of the 3 corners: 1. They're easy to close 2. They're easy to service 3. They're profitable  Taking on any client as long as they'll pay you isn't a good idea. Revenue is revenue, and sometimes you need it, but it just ain't worth working for people it ain't worth working for.

I actually recently blogged about selling SaaS stuff, some of it applies here (popfllame.com).  Ultimately trade shows / events are a good place to start. I would also look for other software or service providers in the same market that your product might work well next to, and add value. Perhaps striking up a conversation with them wouldn't hurt.  It's a process, and selling software like that is very much an example of the trickle effect. Landing the first few is hard, but from there it's rather easy to get referrals. My personal strategy as I pointed out in the blog is to try to establish partners who can really help drive those first sales.  No matter what, it will still be hard work and will require a lot of putting your head down and working through the start."

A great example in KashFlow.com (although I’m biased since I used to work there). Its accounting software for small businesses and was the first focused on the SME business owners, prior to that there was only Sage which was a mammoth company that only accountants or highly experienced/finance educated business people could understand.  Duane (the CEO & Founder) and my old boss (has since sold the company) wrote a whole book about it - it’s a great read in general but the chapter you’d be interested in is called ‘The Sage Wars’ - http://www.amazon.co.uk/Four-Thousand-Days-Journey-Business/dp/151143192X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1435877923&sr=1-1&keywords=duane+jackson (I promise I’m not on commission).  There’s a bit more online about it if you google :).  Anyways, don’t be discouraged.

Think about what Stripe and Square did for merchant accounts. Before Stripe came around it was Authorize.NET attached to a traditional merchant account (which most went through First National for a long time), or PayPal. They realized that those options were too complicated and required too many hands in the pot to get right.  It sounds like you're on a similar trajectory in thinking. But selling to the SMB market (Small & Medium Businesses) is hard. The very reason you see market need is the reason it will be hard to sell: Business owners don't have a lot of time. This is a bit more difficult than what I usually take on (a more enterprise sales strategy) so my take can only carry so much value, but in my opinion it is feet on the ground or bust to get some early traction.

Betting on one person is much higher risk. Work with a local incubator. In the US, many cities have a few and they generally take startups in the ""idea"" stage and provide office space and minimal capital to get an MVP (minimally viable product) ready. You will have to compete with others to get in. Here in Portland, there are a few, one of them being PIE.   That is just speaking to the VC route. There are Angel investors, of which you can reach on things like angel.co. But much of what you'll hear is telling you to raise money from friends and family first.  Be prepared to offer a more robust explanation of what you mean by ""backing from some of the leading companies in the internet security industry..."" Just as those here, it's confusing what ""backing"" means if there's no funding involved.  At the end of the day, it's hard to raise enough money to get an office, hire, etc. without a working prototype at least.

This means that for hourly work you're competing against people who have work history full of projects that are of a similar caliber as yours but could be charging half as much or less per hour as you. It can be difficult to convince someone that your rate which is double that of another guy (who also produces quality work) will actually come out cheaper so some people just like to take the risk of that on to themselves and do fixed price. That way they can look at a project and think ""I can do that in 20 hours"" and quote $2000 whereas the cheaper guy will be looking at it and think ""I can do that in 40 hours"" and quote $3000."

startups,3bss13,e2jk,2,Thu Jul 2 06:50:05 2015 UTC,"BT (the old nationalised telecom provider in the UK and probably still the largest) also offer it on by default to their broadband customers.  In return you get a free subscription to the service. Their router splits out into a separate SSID and of that traffic would be logged as public so doesn't eat into any data allowance, is ringfenced from your internal network, should be legally seperated (i.e if someone does something dodgy on your IP it'll be logged that they were using the public wifi function - perhaps via a proxy I'm not sure) and finally they say that your own traffic gets priority over someone using the public wifi service.  It's a good service in general although they were a bit sneaky about defaulting to on. I don't think most people even know they have it. They also have the benefit of a huge install base.  Another approach is Microsofts Wifi Sense - http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/connectivity/use-wi-fi-sense-to-get-connected - which doesn't require any changes to the router but insteads manages everything from the smartphone side. A bit more of a risk technically but should be much cheaper and simpler to roll out.  Good luck with it. I'm quite lucky as data is cheap and reasonably fast here so I tend to teather to my mobile even if I'm somewhere with free wifi"
startups,3bss13,srmarmalade,3,Thu Jul 2 08:52:16 2015 UTC,"One thing you need to consider are the legalities, and I'm not talking about ISP ToS.  If a person (host) rents out their Wi-Fi and a ""guest"" comes a long and does something naughty, then it's the host's IP address that is going to get logged and investigated by the authorities. They may be a bit shocked by the 5am raid on their house.  One way around this is to tunnel the guest traffic to something you control, so moving the liability away from the host. But this means you end up operating as an ISP and have to worry about peering and bandwidth etc.  Maybe you've considered this, maybe it isn't relevant for some reason. Full disclosure: I used to work for a Wi-Fi ISP (aka Hotspot provider)."

startups,3bss13,zeroXten,2,Thu Jul 2 21:51:48 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same ""What if someone would use my WiFi for nefarious purpose?"". But there could be a solution to it by having verified users (credit card info maybe) & unique ids  (so that the enforcement can track which user caused the trouble). I assume there could be ways technology can handle these issues. Interesting idea if it costs me less than my data pack."
startups,3bss13,maxxam87,2,Thu Jul 2 17:08:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe, could be hard to implement properly.  The authorities are investigating something. They have an IP address. They go to the ISP and ask who had the IP at the time. The ISP tells them. At that point the ""host"" has to prove that it was actually a guest using their IP at the time. This could be quite hard to prove if that security policies are somehow enforced on the hosts equipment. Could be easily spoofed etc. Hence this sort of takes you back to tunnelling as the service would be in full control of any security/usage policy enforcement."

startups,3bss13,techsin101,2,Fri Jul 3 09:41:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that would be a tunnel. It just means someone (the service?) would have to aggregate that traffic. I guess it could be possible to partner with a VPN provider in some way,"
startups,3bss13,zeroXten,2,Fri Jul 3 10:18:12 2015 UTC,"You will need to look into ISP TOSes (and apartment contracts) as this might qualify as business usage or reselling which some disallow in some places. Also be aware of data caps as I highly doubt people would be happy to pay for others going over the limit.  As for the idea itself? I love the idea of it. I have 100mb a month of cell data and so have to be very stringent with my usage. Some ISPs in my area (BC, Canada) have been replacing guest WiFi at businesses with their own free WiFi which would be great except some of them (Shaw for example) only allow their own customers to  use it. I suspect as ISP Hotspots become more plentiful, they will have to try to undercut their competitors but until then, that's not the case.  At this point I am blathering on with no real reason so I will close with my last current thought on the subject. If you do intend to do this, I would suggest you create a device that plugs into the ""provider""'s router and acts as a sub-network and has it's own wireless in it instead of attempting to use their current devices as that would help keep their personal network safe and would make it easier to setup (like plug-n-play)."

It does essentially this but rather than pay users, it's an add-on service for subscribers.  They use a portion of the Xfinity-supplied wifi routers to create a silo access point called ""xfinity free wifi"".  Understanding their reports on how many people use this service may give you some understanding about who might be in need for access to other people's wifi."

startups,3btz42,houstonspace,2,Thu Jul 2 03:20:58 2015 UTC,"I think that bringing in an outsider with previous startup experience would be valuable - especially when pitching to VCs, who will heavily scrutinize your team to understand if you are capable of starting a successful company. That being said, I do not think that this outsider should be appointed CEO. The CEO of the company needs to be in charge of creating and implementing the company's vision, and bringing an outside person into that role may result in a change in vision. While this can be good for struggling businesses, your internal team, if built correctly, shares a similar vision of where your company will be in 5 years, and changes in the direction of the company raise the possibility of angering some of your early team members.   Unless you find someone who very firmly believes in what you are doing, and meshes very well with your team, I would not recommend offering them the CEO role."

So I'm sure our procedures are different but I would guess that you are being personally vetted. It seems like so much of any investing is doing a gut-check of the team. For instance, I instantly was curious as to what your roles will be going forward. Who will do sales? Is there a plan to bring on another cofounder, just hire, etc because it looked like it was just two product people in the business. So if it is a character/team check, just be cognizant of your strengths and know your weaknesses (though no need to advertise them! Just don't write them off either). Understand the general steps to the next phase of the business.  As to exact numbers, know any that are particularly valuable for your company but if they're interested they shouldn't mind a ""I'll need to get back to you with the correct number"" for specific questions.

The positive aspect to that in my mind is that engineers are expensive and we won't need to bring on another engineer for some time. Neither of us have trouble putting in leg work, chatting with customers for gathering initial customers but we will inevitably have to hire sales / marketing people after beta testing is complete.

Ask for at least 500k and come up with a plan for what you'll do with it.  2) Actually, physically, with your mouth, ask for the money from these people.  Say something like ""so can I put you down for $100k?"".  It's far too easy to have coffee meeting after coffee meeting, always beating around the bush, and it's all a waste of time.  Just be blunt and ask for the money."

Still like the concept a lot, but to be honest I was underwhelmed by the content for the course I took. The summaries were quick to read, but very cursory IMHO. I took the Ancient Civs course. I didn't feel like I learned a tremendous amount, and the content was kind of scattered. I would consider instituting a steady format for each course email, with categories that repeat. e.g. Architecture, Social Organization, Tools, Cultural (incl Religion), Modern Day Heritage, Collapse.  If the categories repeated for every Civ, that would help me, as a reader, feel like I was learning clear points about each history, instead of a kind of scrambled summary.   I expect that kind of consistent outline-like approach could help many other courses as well. The content will be key!  It was fun to get an interesting email each day but I don't feel motivated to sign up for another course yet because the content wasn't that great.   The one email that sent me down a Google/Wiki rabbit hole was the one on the Rama civilization. I had never heard much about this, or this wild theory ( http://blog.world-mysteries.com/science/ancient-weapons-of-mass-destruction-and-the-mahabharata/ ) so learning about this was genuinely fascinating.  And fun. The more of the Highbrow emails you can create that deliver that kind of learning, and intrigue folks to learn more, the better.   Love the book links for recommended reading on most emails. Very smart. Should always be there, as I imagine you get revenue from those referral links as well.   I hope this is helpful. I think I will take another course eventually!  Best of luck."

As someone who decided to quit their job and work remotely in order to travel, I can tell you there are absolutely ups and downs. However if you're motivated (and you seem to be) and disciplined,  you can not only pull this off but thrive moving forward.   Your good work will speak for itself.

So that's kinda worst case scenario, realistically be safe with your money, that extra 30k a year, pretend you never got it, put it straight into a S&P 500 or Roth or any 3-10% interest account and let it build up. Meanwhile focus hard and be smart about what you do, don't just work for someone else, use the connections and opportunities to grow yourself while working for them.

startups,3briw3,lubos,2,Wed Jul 1 18:22:31 2015 UTC,"I used to work for a funded startup in the education space. They bought a tiny (one-man-show) SaaS product and the plan was to build a lot more features on top of it aimed at a slightly different market. We migrated a few of the customers over from the old-to-new product in the early stages and solicited feedback from them.  One customer ran a small summer school in our city, and was very vocal about how things should be. Our management assumed he was right and kept asking ""how high?"", so we spent months building features specifically for him. He got annoyed whenever a feature was delayed, and we got annoyed building all this highly specialised stuff for him.  A few months later we got a much bigger customer, and they didn't need any of those features. Then later the company completely pivoted so they were all useless.  TL;DR; If you are an early stage startup it is useful to filter customers, just so you can avoid the angry emails from people who think they own you by paying $49.99/month."

Suddenly everyone listens and starts changing things around. That effect of an external suggestion of having way more weight can be really dangerous.  Instead you need a test driven mentality, customer suggests X? Fine test it, create a lightweight version or even (my personal favourite) just stick a button in or add it to the menu that leads to a coming soon page and count the clicks. Almost no dev time and you pretty quickly get an idea of if anyone else is even interested in the feature.  Also don't rely on surveys for this type of information, customers will come up with all kinds of stuff they think they need, doesn't mean that if you build it anyone will use it."

On the free trial / free tier I'm actually split testing having both at the moment.  So we have a free and a paid plan. Free being free forever and no cc details. We were getting the free sign ups but then the difficulty is converting those to paid.  My thinking is that if you clearly differentiate between free and paid and offer the paid with a free trial, your saying to the user this plan is better and look it's the same price as the free one. They are going to go for the paid plan for free as they get the perks and then should be much easier to roll from free trial to paid.

In general, if you want to enter a crowded niche, you have two options 1) buy your way in with lots of $$$ 2) find a sub-niche and own that.  For instance, a lot of companies sell candles, but how many sell candles that have scenes of Turkish mythology on the side, or smell like types of soda (root beer scent), or contain chocolate inside?  Think about how you can differentiate your self from other candle vendors, and your marketing will become a lot simpler.

If you really believe in your product, then I think a website re-design would be the first step.  One thing I notice was the nondescript candle names.  What does dragon's blood / beach linen really mean.  I would suggest 2-4 sentences that helps me ""smell"" the candle without selling the candle.  2) You only have ten products short-term, rather then make people click through, I would list all 10 on the home page with above said descriptions.  Much easier for people to scroll down and see everything then have to click, back out and then click back in.  Also, I would have top candle be this month special offering it at a small discount.  You might have to take a $2 cut on the first order and if the candles are as good as advertised, people will buy others at regular price.   3)  I love the ""why soy candles"" section, I would find a way to better highlight this.  4) I would downplay the ""pass gas"" aspect.

If it's not running Wordpress already I would seriously consider switching to this. That way you can get a nicely designed site up and running with little technical knowhow for ~$100.  Some other off the cuff advise would be to look at other channels that don't require the site. Ebay shop, amazon reseller and Etsy all immediately spring to mind.  I don't know what traffic you have, if you don't either then Google Analytics would be a good place to start. No traffic = no sales. Even if you have a little bit of traffic or are running paid media your design will be why it isn't converting. Don't take this to heart, lots of sites need changing to get them working properly. By reselling on other channels you can sidestep these headaches for now.  One final note, go on to fiverr or a similar site and use your current branding as a reference point for an expert to redesign it with your original design in mind. It will cost a small amount and be well worth it."

Chrome was the best of the 3, but still not great. The product pictures aren't the product! I get wanting to evoke the scent, but except for that lone candle image in the header, I literally can't see what I'm paying for. There's a lot of roadblocks on the checkout page. I have to uncheck ""ship to a different address"", which is an unintuitive way of asking ""use the same address for shipping?"" I also have to agree to the terms and conditions. Don't redirect to PayPal. There's plenty of online store builders (like Shopify) that offer integration with services like Stripe that let the user stay on the page. I admittedly don't know the candle market, but I bet lots of people associate candles with relaxation, a touch of luxury, and just feeling good.  But I don't get any of that vibe from your site.

startups,3bs0ds,RoadSurfer,2,Wed Jul 1 19:56:54 2015 UTC,"The word ""startup"" is such a nebulous term.  It says nothing about what the business does.  I think in any job search it helps to get answers to the below questions:   What's your degree in?   What skills do you have that would be particularly suitable for a startup? What sort of startup are you looking for?   What sort of work would you really like to be doing for a startup? What are you doing to ensure startups see your applications?   I've worked for a number of startups as a software engineer, and I can tell you that they look for employees basically the same way any other company does.  They run ads (online and print) and list jobs with placement agencies, they go to recruiters for the more technical or specialized jobs, and they take employee referrals for open positions.  As an applicant, your job (it doesn't really matter if its for a startup or not), is to make yourself look like the ""ideal"" candidate.  If you can't do that, you're not going to get considered.  So, it comes down to taking their requirements and reformulating your experience into something that looks like what they want...  and THEN you have to get your resume in front of a hiring manager that will see it - blind submissions are generally not that successful.  Quick Note: Just putting some phrase in your resume that says you want to work for a startup is probably not sufficient, if you haven't addressed the above points: a) applicability of your submission for the job - and 2) getting your resume in front of the right person."

What value is you bringing or how can you create value for a company is what you need to enthusiastically show. Persons of a company (especially startups) do not want to hire some one who simply does their job for a paycheck, they want persons who can give it their fullest and help grow their business to new levels of revenue and cashflow.

It could work as a rough proxy for user growth, but you should really rely on your analytics tools for that.  This pretty quickly turned into an advertisement for them, but I don't really care. It's a product I happily recommend as we've had a great experience all around, customer support included."

Inevitably some of the keywords are going to include words like ""suit.""  However, in a broad match search, someone might searching ""Bathing Suits"" and end up with your ad served to them. If they click it, clearly they're in the wrong place, and you've just wasted a click's worth of adspend.  A negative keyword allows you to essentially blacklist a keyword so that it doesn't show your ad for that word/phrase. In our previous example, something along the lines of ""bathing"" should be blacklisted.  You can see what keywords are serving up your ads/where you're getting clicks from within Adwords.  Of course, it gets more complicated, but that's the basic rundown."

Our ad and landing pages make it clear that we sell widget financing to widget business owners (Grow Your Widget Business!), but still we have people clicking all the time who are clearly using consumer queries. Maybe they love widgets so much that they want to make a career out of it, but going by the data these are wasted clicks.  You want to control the targeting enough to avoid those situations if you can. In our case though, we can't eliminate all the consumer queries without missing potential business queries as well."

startups,3boatz,fellars,7,Tue Jun 30 20:36:37 2015 UTC,"You really should only consider someone as a partner who brings a substantial and complementary skill set and experience pool to the table. In many verticals it's pretty common to hire someone, and they can become a partner as they prove themselves by earning more equity.  To have them start under the premise of being a co-founder, it really creates a complicated system of determining equity, control, etc. There's a lot to it. If you've made it work to the point you have the cashflow to hire, I would recommend hiring every time unless you know beyond a doubt the value that person can bring to your business."

Most people(that I have talked to at least) do not like to hear the terms cofounder and vesting schedule/equity in the same sentence. I think it might be easier to bring someone on as an employee and give them a guaranteed pay, as opposed to 'hiring' somebody as a cofounder. Especially due to the fact that you already have a well established business. But I WILL say, that if you are looking for someone who bring things to the table that will grow and expand your business, then they would be an acceptable cofounder candidate.

In most instances the documentation itself was never really referred back to.  I’d be keen to learn about how it could be made more engaging, compelling and actively facilitate teams to stop repeating a mistake that was picked up in a previous retro, and if there was a tool or app which made it so.

startups,3bmb0k,taylorlistens,5,Tue Jun 30 13:40:57 2015 UTC,"But these people did NOT complete this form as users looking to create a race and open registration, but as users looking to REGISTER for a race that wasn't even on my platform.   Ouch! Attracting the wrong audience. :D  I can only help you with the copy (somewhat, because I'd have to do research to be able to really help you). So, here comes some critique:  Your headline   Race registration in minutes.   Contrary to the advice here, please don't use the word ""tool"". Nobody cares about tools. People only care about the things they can do or will get by using these tools.   To make this headline better:   Quantify your promise. Say how many minutes it takes exactly. A quantified promise is tangible. You can imagine spending 5 minutes and it's definitely super fast. But ""minutes"" could mean ""120 minutes"".  That's why quantified is always better. Make it actionable, e.g. ""Register a race in X minutes"", not ""Race registration in minutes"". Because, see above, people care about what they can do. Make it specific, e.g. not ""a race"" (which has double meaning) but ""a road race"" or whatever the term is.   Now, considering what you said up there, perhaps you're confusing people with that verb ""register"". If this isn't what your target audience uses to describe the act of creating a race, do a quick research to find out what they call it. If you're sure this is the correct verb, use the text below the headline to say who this website is for (a quick Google search tells me they are called ""race directors"")  Your benefits   ""setup"" is the noun, you want the verb ""set up"".   Your calls to action  Too many!!! I've seen this on a number of startup landing pages and I get the logic: ""What if they don't click that button? I'll just put a fallback here. Okay, but... if they don't click that... let's put a third one, just in case.""  This is flawed logic!   It doesn't work this way. Your landing page has to have one and only one goal. This means that you can only have one type of call to action. If your copy can't make the visitor click on your button, then you should work on improving the copy, but don't put extra buttons. You're confusing people by giving them too many choices. Google ""paradox of choice"".  So, get rid of the ""Learn more"" buttons. If you think it's important for people to see the pricing, then put it on the front page, A/B test.   I'm also pretty sure you're pushing it with those 4 CTAs spread on as much as 132 words. 2 would be fine.   I found important info about the platform buried at the bottom   SimpleRace is the perfect tool for race organizers looking to provide online race registration. Our platform is specialized to the needs of the race organizer looking for an easy and affordable way to offer online race registration. SimpleRace is great for running races (5k, 10k, half-marathon, full marathon), cycling races (Time trial, criterium, MTB, downhill), multi-sport races (duathlon, triathlon) and adventure races (Mud runs, fun runs).   So, perhaps a better headline would be ""Open race registration in 5 minutes""? You should say who this website is for and what types of races people can organize with it at the beginning, not in the fine print that nobody's going to read.   Like others have said, move this copy up."

It auto loads a second type of race (obviously for 5k / 10k/ half marathon etc.) but through up an error when I went to move on with only one race type. It took me a few seconds to realise what the hold up was but possibly a button to add a second type of race or, the site allowing the user to move on if everything in the 2nd race is left blank would be helpful there.  Your main page could use some clarification on what the site does.

There's no point in polishing step 1 if you aren't solid on step 0. Which is Acquiring the right people.  What you should be validating now is:   Step 0. If I bring in the right set of people, does the product make sense to them?... And only then  Step 1. How can I scale this user acquistion process?  Adwords and FB ads come in when you are trying to get users at scale. Until then, actually make the product difficult.   Here are a few VERY stupid pieces of advice you should follow till you cross step 0:   Acquire very very few very very targeted users. Even if it means you have to go through non-scalable, time consuming efforts like directly talking, content, or participating in specific forums. Make your copy long, straight and boring. Explain WHO this is for, WHAT the product is and WHY it's any good. Forget all the marketing and salesy BS (complete in minutes, 30 seconds to racing freedom, etc.) If you have to, make the signup process HARDER. You want to be absolutely sure you have the right people with a burning problem, and see if your solution makes any sense to them.   Once you get an affirmative answer here, move on to Step 1, start looking for how you can scale your customer acquisition.   Once you know how to bring in leads, focus on reducing friction, make signing up easy, etc. From your website right now, I don't think you'll have any trouble at all here..."

Where does that fit into the larger workflow?   I would expect organizing and launching a race to be a larger process where creating race registration is just one part.  Get out and talk to as many race organizers as possible. What's the workflow and how best would your product fit into that workflow?   Then position the top of your sales funnel as soon as possible aligned to that already existing workflow. Once in your funnel, users will be diverted into your product when it comes time for creating race registration. Note this may require creating content for parts of the race organization workflow earlier in the process."

Postcards, or thank you notes (hand written in particular!) though are supposedly exceptionally successful when it comes to customer retention and satisfaction and very likely to be shared on social media via photo for example.  I think you’d probably be better off investing in some really quality landing pages with good SEO copy and very targeted adwords campaigns.  Similarly - I’d approach the listing sites - in the UK there’s spareroom.co.uk for example which has a ‘suitable for students option for listings, if you could aggregate them you’d likely get more traction and traffic from the students themselves, once you’ve for traction and traffic you’re in much better position to approach bigger management agencies for them to list their portfolio of properties. You’ve then become an established player with demonstrated metrics and individual landlords without a management company would be encouraged to list their properties.  Just my opinion.

startups,3bnx77,StackMe,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:10:42 2015 UTC,I love the concept! Great idea.  My advice would be to get in touch with as many student unions (I’m assuming you’ve got the equivalent over in states?) as possible and look for a launch partner.  For market research if you can even get the student social social accounts to put up a post about your site along with your short survey you should gain a lot of insight pretty quickly.  Similarly for going to market you’d want to go for the student unions and student associations and get as much exposure on their sites as well as their social media featuring a post pointing to your site.  Once you can gain traction with them you’re onto a winner :).  Best of luck! :)

Also getting some friends/college students and having a photoshoot party would add credibility and display the product.    Also to test it, post it on different college groups on Facebook. I've done some market testing there and get great results. I just recently posted a survey on 3 ""class of 20XX"" groups and got 40 replies within a day.

Admittedly I’ve not registered for it and just browsed the website and watched the video so don’t know if you’ve got this as a feature already - but I’d see the employer creating a specific template of questions and tasks that the employee should document per job description. i.e. a member of admin staff leaves, the questions the employer should ask is “how do you process a refund, how do you decide if a refund is to be authorised or not, etc etc etc).

I’d still say when starting up $2000 is an absolutely massive chunk of capital to be spending when starting up.

startups,3bjzlf,f00gers,6,Tue Jun 30 14:57:01 2015 UTC,Nah his comment is level headed. There would need to be an insane track record with the designer to warrant such a price.
startups,3bjzlf,caseharts,0,Mon Jun 29 21:52:20 2015 UTC,I paid $50 for the best logo !!! You just have to search and be patient.
startups,3bjzlf,sap323,6,Mon Jun 29 22:12:29 2015 UTC,"Again, it’s in my opinion. If you’ve got the capital to invest in an all singing, all dancing design agency thats going to charge $2000 for a logo alone then by all means do it.  But then again, this is a startups thread, and the choice the OP was referring to was between getting a brand - like you said done properly done scientifically - or traction and traffic in order to generate revenue.  I’ve had a lot of involvement in startups over the years and haven’t heard a success story that begins with ‘The first thing we did was invest the majority of all available capital in getting the perfect logo’.  I completely agree that graphics and branding are indeed a science and should be done professionally. But when you’re starting up, again in my opinion, they come secondary to getting at least some revenue in the bank."
startups,3bjzlf,steven_hammond,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:46:22 2015 UTC,What does this mean?  2000 for a logo vs no adwords is a silly decision it would be smarter to spend under 1000 and the test on adwords. The 2000 dollars doesn't directly buy you a better logo.
startups,3bjzlf,caseharts,2,Mon Jun 29 21:53:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a brand strategist. Have designed many a logo over the years. What people are saying about the value of logo design is sad. Far more than half your entities value is locked up in the intangibles and invested in its brand. That said, the critics are correct in saying that at this juncture in your business development you need market testing more than brand recognition. Spend the money on the Adwords. (But for gods sake buying a $50 logo is a total waste of resources. If you aren't spending enough to get the strategy work that goes with creating a solid narrative save your money and do it yourself in MSPaint or something."

startups,3bjzlf,1q2w3,3,Tue Jun 30 06:47:41 2015 UTC,"Use 99Designs.com. They made the Docker logo. They're perfectly adequate.  If your ad keyword targeting is already perfect, I'd spend it there. Otherwise, the $ you'd spend on a logo is just to get keyword research done, which you can do for free elsewhere."

I suggest not to spend more than $400.  Your money is much better spent investing in other areas until you have enough traction that your brand recognition will matter.

I'm a mediocre guy but 300 dollars is pretty standard and doesn't value my time at some nutty 50 an hour unless I hit it out if the park first attempt.   your success won't be determined between the 400 dollar logo and the 2000 dollar one.

But demand is middling, supply of designers is high.   But that's now how it is.  The people charging 2k are few and far between because they prefer contract work with creative studios it's freelancing with out the worry of pay but the same freedom usually.    I know a few illustrators that work for fox on contract bars for concept art. Trust me they aren't easy to get for a start up.  They'd charge these rates.   I just don't want to see a guy starting a company have a budget of 2k for his logo and ad words And at all think the best option would be to spend all of that on the logo.  The best results would be a mix and a lean towards more money on ad words.    This is my opinion. The perfect logo won't make a company more than intelligent spending. If the budgets 2k it wouldn't be smart to only use it on the logo.   I'd put my middling skills up against a 2k guy and see who you get more value out of.  I'm sure theirs is better but in the start up phase 2k is huge the amount of lost business if any would be inconsequential."

startups,3bjzlf,independent_hustler,2,Tue Jun 30 07:31:25 2015 UTC,"This is a good approach.   You can do a lot of the high-level branding exercises yourself, and once you've done those, a logo is much easier to do.  For example, can you identify your target market? What type of design requirements do they have?  Can you also identify a single unique selling proposition for your brand / product?   Also, it might be a good idea to talk to the designer and let him know about your budget. Tell him what you're looking for, have it all prepared for him, and get him to do a draft version for cheaper.   Maybe $2-400 just for a logo and nothing else.  You can then find someone to get you some more branding elements from that for very cheap.  Then, when you have additional funds you can go back to him, and I'm sure he will have a much better feeling/idea of what to do after having some more time to percolate on the idea.   If he's willing to do that, that would probably be optimal imo. Generally people are willing to do more than you're asking for, as well -- all you need to do is to explain your situation and that you really want to work with them."

And color it at least with a type of red, because it's the color that evokes emotion - heck, even this sub-reddit uses red icons and lettering.

Now go onto the most popular forum they hang out and start researching them. You'd be looking for ""pains"" and ""dreams"". What are they struggling with? What do they complain about? What tools do they use to solve their current problems? What do they hate about these tools? Once you spot a problem (trend, lots of people whining about the same thing) start looking at their dreams: In a perfect world, what do they want to be able to do? How will the world look like when the problem is removed? Note your observations, you'll need them later. Also, copy/paste the exact words people use to describe their pains and dreams (you'll use that in the copy). How. Then comes the time to start problem solving. Brainstorm. How can you solve this problem? There is always more than one way. How can you ship a painkiller the soonest? What are you most qualified to do? You can ship a tool (like a SaaS) or you can ship an ebook, or something else. The solution of the problem can take on many shapes. If you're better at coding, you'd ship software.

startups,3bif4j,KobeBeanBryant,3,Tue Jun 30 02:37:47 2015 UTC,"In my experience, every investor is different. Some are very focused on the revenue model while others don't care about revenue and are more concerned with user growth and your burn rate. Try to cover all the basics in your pitch deck and have the details to back up your claims in the pitch deck ready to send out. Keeping the deck too 11 slides the first time you reach out to investors to get them excited about what your doing. The team should always been in there though because early stage investors are investing more in the team than in your idea.  I actually follow the opposite of your approach. Emailed presentations are much shorter and say this explicitly in the deck. I inform investors that if they would like to know more about what we are doing there is a longer version we can send and setup a meeting to review. It leaves the door open to continue a conversation with the investor and educate them about your startup."

When I e-mail a PDF it's more wordy and a few slides longer to give investors an idea about the team, MRR, opportunity for investment, etc.  In a meeting when you're actually doing a pitch, a lot of that stuff is simply discussed. That's why I'm clear about my actual pitch being really concise and generally just showing off the product, while the actual materials I send out are far more rich."
startups,3bif4j,UXAndrew,4,Mon Jun 29 14:25:47 2015 UTC,You're missing a slide or two about your team
startups,3bif4j,JJJ_JJJ,0,Mon Jun 29 16:32:39 2015 UTC,"If you're doing a pitch then you introduce yourself and your team and you can address any questions.  Like I said, the materials I send to investors/clients differ from my actual pitch deck.  For example, if I'm sitting in front of the guy, I don't need a smiling picture of myself with my job title, etc. I can just say ""Hi, I'm UXAndrew and here's my title.""  Later, when I send PDFs, then I give that information because they might have forgotten or pass those materials on to someone who wasn't present in the meeting."

startups,3bif4j,JJJ_JJJ,-3,Mon Jun 29 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"Are you recommending that I show a slide to a room with text about who the people sitting in front of them are? That's silly.  Again, there is a difference between what you present and what you send.  It's simply more effective to say ""I'm UXAndrew, I went to Big State, I've been working in X for 3 years, and I am the Head of VPs"" or whatever.   Also, across the board-- Please do not ever write text on slides if you're going to read it aloud to people or it's longer than a few words. People can either pay attention to you OR your slides, but not both."
startups,3bif4j,UXAndrew,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:44:05 2015 UTC,"Again, you're putting words in my mouth, I never said to write it out on slides then you'd look like a middle schooler. But some bullets are always good. You want to show who are the people behind it, what is the opportunity, the context, and your deal. On that note (the deal), your pitch deck format is missing an ask or a call to action to your audience. Won't go too far if you're not clear about what you are asking."
startups,3bif4j,JJJ_JJJ,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:13:48 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this, I think /u/UXAndrew is dead on.  Your pitch deck is going to be different from the takeaways - if you have a PDF that summarizes everything - sure - put it there.  Then again, yes, some people make their pitch deck, what they send out, etc etc... but no - if you're standing there in front of people, you don't need a slide that talks about who you are, when you're about to do that yourself.  And do investors really care about who's sitting behind the desk pushing pencils - or do they really care more about the numbers, facts, figures, and how your business can make them more money...   Just my $.02 for what it's worth"
startups,3bif4j,PsychMarketing,2,Mon Jun 29 20:37:28 2015 UTC,"Investors DO care and they care A LOT about the team behind the product. They are investing in you and your ability to execute.  If you have an already established revenue and growth model (actual numbers, not forecasts), then I can see a need to de-emphasize the team.  Most startups pitching investors have none of those things, so you're selling your team. To effectively do that, you should have a slide that breaks down how and why you're the people that will make the impossible happen.  Research both empirical (see link below) as well as personal experience suggest the team slide is one of the most important slides to have in your deck.  Talking about it isn't enough. You need visuals to drive home the right takeaways. What elements in your background do you want to reinforce? Famous companies? Previous exits?  http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/08/lessons-from-a-study-of-perfect-pitch-decks-vcs-spend-an-average-of-3-minutes-44-seconds-on-them/#.xoq9f9:MILd  (like any study there are flaws, but not enough to impact the specific point about the team page being critical)"

startups,3bif4j,PsychMarketing,0,Mon Jun 29 23:42:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that they care about that information, what I'm disagreeing with is whether that is something that needs to be a slide in your deck or just something you can talk about during the meeting with an investor.  I don't see the purpose of a dedicated slide that explains who the team is considering that the first thing that happens in virtually every meeting is that we sit down and everyone introduces themselves and we talk about the team. The information is present, but it's not part of the pitch deck.  Face-to-Face > Powerpoint  Me sitting there telling someone who I am is going to be far more powerful than whatever Keynote/PPT that's flashing on the screen. These people see thousands of people just like you every year, so either you're making a resounding first impression or you're not. I don't think I need visuals in a PPT as much as I need time to sit and talk face-to-face.  People are going to make a deal with YOU (!!!) not with your pitch deck."
startups,3bif4j,UXAndrew,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:35:20 2015 UTC,"I understand your point about to include or not to include. That's a strategic choice related to presentation style, if your entire team joins you for each investor pitch, whether your deck is for an investor meeting/pitch event, etc  It sounds like you choose not to have visual aids to emphasize certain points about your team and background. I can also appreciate the choice you made here, though it's not one I agree with.  About halfway through though you switched to a different topic which is ""Face to face vs. Powerpoint"". I think you misunderstood me a bit. I'm not comparing the 2. I don't suggest to just throw a slide up and expect investors to read it.  Having a Powerpoint slide to emphasize/reinforce certain points about your background is a complementary strategy to talking about it.   Our team is strong and I place a lot of value on using any tool we have too emphasize our backgrounds."
startups,3bif4j,jstandard,0,Tue Jun 30 02:12:01 2015 UTC,"I never said to write it out on slides then you'd look like a middle schooler. But some bullets are always good.   That's a bit of a contradiction, no?   You want me to write it on the slide you just want me to write it as bullet points. Same thing.  So then what am I going to do with those bullet points? Read them one-by-one to people who already know how to read? It's easier and more effective to just talk to people.  I'm not sure how many pitches you've done, but there are two general formats of pitches that I've done... The first is basically a sit-down meeting where we discuss the opportunity. In those cases, the first thing that generally happens is an informal introduction, then a pitch, then Q&A and discussion of details.  The second type is a ~5min. pitch at some kind of pitch day event where you're speaking to a larger audience.  In both cases I'm going to SAY the information about who I am and what I'm after, but those materials aren't a part of my pitch deck.  In other words, they're part of the general, overall pitch. I don't neglect that information, but I'm not making an actual slide/slides that have that information on it.  Then when I send materials to investors/clients, I send specific materials that matter most based on the meeting we've had. For example, if the person was an investor and asks me a lot about traction, then I send extra slides in the deck that deal with traction."

In terms of fitness I've always enjoyed the idea of the zombie run and other VR kinda apps, but completion is always something that I feel more motivated by.  I got a Fitbit the other day and filling your daily goals is just intoxicating. I can't stop wanting to just walk and run everywhere.  I love when I unlock a badge or a challenge.  The best thing for me therefore would be an app that shows your progress, has many many many trophies to unlock (to keep you coming back) and perhaps even an element of fun using VR/imagination (I.e zombie run).

We didn't approach anyone to post on PH, and neither we had access to post on PH, but we thought, we would simply launch on HN and if people like it, we can ask them to post it or some nice person post it.  However, what it happen was crazy, someone posted it on PH and he even did not bother to let us know, also he posted few products on this same day (and i believe it was the first time he was submitting, and till date none of this submission featured) -  anyway now, after 2 day of posting on HN, I reach out to a hunter, and he willing to post it for us, and then surprise surprise, someone already posted on PH, so this hunter cannot post again at all.. I spoke to Ryan and team to help me put on maker, they did the changes,  but they did not approve it... (at this point, i did not realize how important is PH is, ... read more...)  What it means, that all our competitors are featured on PH and we didn't so obviously even with same or similar product and very good pricing we lost the game, at least at this point, due to PH fail launch.   Most people/customer etc think that hunted on PH is a big thing, and that perception is very very important, unless our product is next instagram... or we got huge twitter etc fanbase.  so long story story.. unless you have other good avenue to market for initial product, ensure to post it on PH first. try to get it feature on PH first.

Read your stock option agreement for the terms to figure out how many options have vested. Read the part of the agreement that talks about leaving the company. There is now a timer (usually 30 days, but each agreement is different) where you must choose to exercise the stock options you have or they expire and are given back to the company. Just because options have vested does not mean that you now own stock. You need to exercise the stock options, which means tell the company in writing that you want to buy them for the strike price in your agreement. You do this only if you think the company will do well in the future. You can try to ask for an extension on the exercise rights if you think the company likes you enough to do and wants to keep working with you after you leave. If you worked on any side projects on company equipment, make sure to remove all traces.  If you used your personal mobile phone to check your company's email, and did any side work, that may be considered company equipment. Review any signed non-disclosure and non-compete agreements to see if there is a conflict with what you may want to be doing next. Handle everything with written communication, including your resignation, as well as any promised compensation, severance, outstanding money due to you or otherwise. If you rely on the company for insurance, make sure they set you up with COBRA or equivalent if you need to continue your insurance coverage needs. Your insurance premiums will go up (if the company was covering any part of it). It may be worthwhile for you to pursue getting an individual insurance plan in case the company's plan was too expensive for your needs. When you leave, if you like, offer to provide paid consulting work. It could be a nice pad of income to you, and it shows the company you like them enough to want to help them succeed. Up to you if that's true or not. Typical rates are at least 3x what your hourly rate would be. Note any money you make here, you want to set aside a third for taxes.  If they counter-offer, keep in mind the dynamics are now ruined and they may be looking to replace you should you choose to remain with the counter-offer.   Good luck!"

I don't have any actual cases of this happening in the real world so I can't speak to how true it is.  It boiled down to the lawyer advising that any work-related mobile communications be done from a separate work mobile device that has no affiliation or connection to your own personal mobile device.
startups,3bimgx,exitstrategy1,3,Mon Jun 29 19:31:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I did a bare minimum amount of research and discovered that a personal device used to check company emails or do company-related work may be confiscated if the company is sued, but doesn't sound like it actually ever becomes company property.   If a company is involved in litigation — civil or criminal — personal cellphones that were used for work email or other company activity are liable to be confiscated and examined for evidence during discovery or investigation. [From an NBC article]   Bunch more good info about it on the Bar Association's website."

startups,3bimgx,dbcy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:06:20 2015 UTC,nope. Not options. They are an 'option' to buy shares based on a current valuation of the business. Typically even with publicly traded companies options are worth nearly nothing when they are granted since the company needs to grow and increase value before the options come worth anything other than a higher tax bill.  Options are NOT equity.

startups,3bimgx,ChaosMotor,2,Tue Jun 30 03:14:29 2015 UTC,"For the stock options, definitely check the agreement to see how long you can hold onto them before they disappear after the termination event takes place.  Remember that even though you think they are worthless, others may still be interested.   While the company may not be publicly traded, you may still be able to sell to interested buyers. Start by asking the middle/senior managers that you are comfortable asking if they know any that wants to purchase your vested options. Give yourself a reasonable mark-up that you'd be comfortable walking away with, and make sure to factor in your country's capital gains tax (up to 40% in the U.S. for stock that has changed hands less than one year after purchase) to see how much money you actually walk away with.  Note: some agreements may have a clause that requires majority shareholder and/or company consent on who you are allowed to sell your stock to in a secondary market prior to a sale or public trading event.  Edit: just wanted to add I think it's a bit odd that your resignation letter isn't being 'accepted' by the boss. Just to protect yourself, it may be worthwhile to email it (so there's a paper trail) to them as well and/or ask for written confirmation of your exit terms such as your last day of employment, final check, and any outstanding reimbursements."

Meetups are a good way to meet people but honestly usually a waste of time. Having gone to a good college is usually big help because it gives you a network of people to tap into, it's about the only useful thing about college these days. The important thing to remember is, the more you talk about your idea, the better chance you have of finding that partner.  As far negotiating equity distribution, you have to look at a variety of factors to determine how much equity you and your co-founder will receive, these are the main points to look at:   1. Direction, Vision and Leadership. 2. Pre-existing IP or Technical Expertise 3. Intellectual Capital & Business Development (Fundraising) 4. Sacrifice & time commitment   You can break down these categories into a percent and determine how much each of you will receive. If you have spent a lot of time and own the IP, it can be slanted in your direction. One thing to remember, if you find a co-founder, he DOES NOT receive his equity immediately. It is typically paid out over the course of 4 years and usually doesn't receive any for the first year. So there is little risk on your end to try someone out for a while and see if it works out. This is common practice in silicon valley."

It's a free platform connecting people with ideas or early stage startups and people interested in joining a startup. You can create a free profile for your idea/startup and specify the person or people you're looking for.  As far as the negotiations are concerned, one thing you could consider is working with someone on a project basis first to find out how well you work together before you decide to really go into business with them. Of course, looking at their portfolio or experience will give you a bit of an idea but ultimately there's nothing like actually working with someone.   In terms of equity, maybe you should look into a vesting model so you don't give whoever joins you a large amount of equity from the start. Hope that helps!"

startups,3bkt7h,cosmo7,3,Tue Jun 30 01:18:46 2015 UTC,"Afraid to say I agree with the above. The unfortunate thing is that unless you can afford patent lawyers and non-disclosure agreements you really can’t not tell anyone the idea to get it developed :(.  If you invest in a good developer or team (it’s actually a lot easier than it sounds) in most cases you’ll find them trustworthy, competent and will deliver your app for you.  Another important note is that to deliver a good app and one that will sell you’ll actually need input from those that would be the users - that could be businesses, impartial and upfront friends and family, colleagues or whatever your app market is. Only with this input will you be able to create the product that they can use and meets the markets needs. In a normal setting this is done by someone called a Product Manager.  If you have a read up on something called lean / agile software development it talks about stakeholder input heavily - these stakeholders are the ones that ultimately end up using your product and who will be your market.

Every developer I know has at least 10 ideas on the ""would be cool to do if I had free time"" list. If they wanted to run a startup business, then they would already be working on their own startup with their own idea. If you can hire them at all, it's because they prefer the stability of getting paid for their time instead of the complexity and risk of running a startup.  The same with investors - they aren't interested in running one business, but owning a fraction of tens or hundreds of businesses. Perhaps it's a risk only when they have already invested in a competitor, and might pass on details. But if you want their money, you have no choice but to explain everything in detail anyway."

But I did know that I was not fully wrong - only mostly wrong. I knew for certain was that there was a big problem there to be solved, I had experienced it myself, and if I spend enough time with potential users I could figure out how to solve it. The real key is admitting to yourself that you are already mostly wrong and then trying to figure out how to correct course for the right path.

As a CxO you are supposed to make decisions that are best for that area and know what happens if certain levers are pulled.  You will go to the CEO and say, ""This is best"".  The CEO will listen to all the CxO's and then made a strategic plan.  If there is no conflict in the best options, it will probably be pursued.  If there is, the CEO will try to find optimal solution for the business given the tradeoffs.  The CEO is kept in check (aka making sure they make the best decisions) by the board.

startups,3bjees,ashtrack,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:54:25 2015 UTC,I think I'm your target customer as I have no experience and just spent ~$100 for very little value as far as I can tell now.  Since my problem is that I want to make sure my money is spent wisely I wouldn't pay $20 for this unless I'm learning something I can take with me so it effectively makes this $20 almost pennies when I think of a per use case.

I have theories on who they are based on free tools and I'm trying to get a connection with them.  If you could somehow show that I can get closer to speaking with them face to face through your service faster than I would on my own and I can take what I've learned with me than I'd pay for it.
startups,3bjees,negative34,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:30:23 2015 UTC,"Ah ok. What I do is drive $100 of targeted traffic to your site. So you can capture those leads with whatever service you'd like (Mailchimp, Getdrip, Aweber, etc.) and contact them through their email addresses and setup customer development interviews (Which I highly recommend). So I help you build your initial list and you can do with it what you please. If you can get face to face interviews that's great, phone interviews work as well.  I drive the traffic, tell you what I did to drive the traffic, and then you keep all of your leads and use them to learn."
startups,3bjees,Unomagan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:48:56 2015 UTC,Yes that process works.  As far as the value you'd have to show me that it's worth the $X you'd be charging especially since lean startuppers are already focused on effective and efficient spend.
startups,3bjees,OkSt00pid,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:10:30 2015 UTC,If you know how to setup ads that convert well and are  comfortable you won't be blowing $100 then this isn't for you. But if you have never are a FB ad before and don't know much about PPC then you are testing your skills making ads just as much as your idea. I take that out of the equation because I know what I know PPC already and will make  you a great ad.  Also it would be $20 so in all honesty a lot of value.

Personally, I'd see a lot more potential in changing your model to split for both those use cases - but definitely focus on the latter.  For example; to get a user to sign up they could find your easter eggs by reading through X pages of features for promocode to increase trial length > this should increase trial sign up conversions.  In the latter case though where a user is in their sign up period > you want them to explore as much of the app and its features as possible - teaching them how to use the software whilst demonstrating its value and therefore increasing their desire to start a subscription.  There's a few bits of tech out there that can do the instructional part pretty well, overlaying a tutorial with (click here to begin > then click here > then click here), but I've never seen it gamified before personally - because of that I see a lot of potential personally.  You'd need to make it dynamic enough to accommodate users exploring on their own (something I learned personally that as much as of a 'getting started' process you've got the majority of the time they want to explore whatever area seems most appealing to them at the time).  Like I said, looks like it could have really good potential.  Hope this helps."
startups,3bii38,winstonl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:30:09 2015 UTC,Just one quick note though - for businesses to actually subscribe you'd need to really demonstrate metrics. If you can prove that this software increases conversions by X% you're onto a winner.

startups,3bjbxz,astp,2,Mon Jun 29 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"There is a talent shortage in social & digital, so when you find great people to work with you need to help them grow & achieve their goals.    Absolutely, I think the problem is a lot of start-ups are going the in-house route which offers, better work/life balance, salaries, and perks. I'm interested to know how you keep your talent?   Very few business owners understand marketing and advertising, which I found very surprising when I first started out.   With the amount of time educating my clients about their brand and target market, I might as well get a teaching degree.   A lot of people want you to work for free. Learn to say no.   Amen, I've received too many offers undercutting my services without taking in the fact that we're an investment.   Bad companies to work with put agencies at 'arms length' with the rest of their business, and think marketing is a solution to overnight success.   Personally I have no problem them doing that, as long as they're not telling me what to do. How the hell does a business get successful enough hire an agency without understanding basic marketing principles?   Good companies to work with see you as a partner, not as an outside service provider.   A lot as to do with communication and setting expectations. Too many marketing agencies are ran by monkeys.   The great companies to work with integrate you into key decisions and operations, so your strategies can be implemented, and are willing to budget for it. They see you as part of their team.   Bingo. Those are the ones that will reap the benefits.    Marketing isn't the silver bullet to sales, so it shouldn't be sold that way.    True, but the reason why agencies do it because it gets people's attention. What would you say is the correct way?   'Self learning' - i.e. reading articles, books and listening to people's stories, is critical to personal growth.   These have been a mixed bag for me. Some are just ""you can do it attitude"", or ""follow these principles for success because ____ did it"". What I've learned is that these aren't meant to be read, but studied in parts.   I've said this before but I'll say it again: There is no substitute for hard work. Literally no substitute.   I'm more of a fan of work smart, not harder. Always experiment and continue what gets results.   Working with different companies, different people from around the world and being exposed to many peoples opinions is one of the most rewarding things about working in an agency.   Personally it's been making this world a better place by helping business's solve people's problems.   Having been client and agency 'side' now, it's important to know neither 'side' is more hardworking than the other. There's just different kinds of work, different kinds of pressure and different workflows, that ultimately combine to produce excellent work. It's important to remember this.   Hell Yeah   We need to remember the work we create ends up in front of millions of people. When you're working full speed to deliver something, its sometimes easy to forget that. Stop, take a breather and make sure that what's about to go live is the best it can be.   As long as it's within their budget and deadline.   In a world where automation wins, we now need human editors and input more than ever.   Can you give examples? personally I find it the opposite because humanizing(sorry if that's a buzzword) businesses are a lot more effective.   Our services at their core are about influencing peoples behaviour in our clients favour. All campaigns and activity should come back to that goal.   Amen   The agency model is not broken, as many say. Like any business or idea, you just need to know your market and see a gap, then prove yourself, your value and keep your customers happy.   I wouldn't say broken is the correct word, I would say adapting to the growing problems businesses need in order to stay relevant.   To thrive in this business you need to work hard and play hard.   And do work that matters.   The agency team is the most valuable asset to the business.   Unless they go in-house :p  Overall this was a great post!"

It was initially a hobby whilst I was at college but earned up turning into quite a decent money spinner and ran for over three years.  For monetisation, I'd look into if there was any other similar local agencies promoting smaller businesses and feed their content (i.e. tweets and FB postings) into your app.  An example use case could be the user gets a notification that a local restaurant has a special on the menu.

We've developed a solution to increase security, reduce risk and thus enhance margins for shared economy companies by analyzing people's online conversations in the context of a specific transaction (renting a house on airbnb, getting a car from RelayRides, going on a date you met online, etc).    Background checks can be expensive, so our solution serves to augment - but not replace - the more traditional methods of consumer assessment at a much cheaper price and much faster turnaround (scores come in seconds and are updated in real-time.) We've done the same thing for financial information in the form of an algorithm that does sentiment analysis on individual stocks.  The flexibility of the algorithm is pretty cool.

startups,3beebl,ShetlandJames,3,Mon Jun 29 06:18:59 2015 UTC,"these comparable valuations seem odd to me because Marriot owns these buildings.   Actually, Marriott (as with many major hotel brands) doesn't own many of its hotels-- for these hotels, it enters into management agreements with an independent hotel owner to manage the hotel as a Marriott.  Four Seasons also does this:    Four Seasons does not own most of its properties; it operates them on behalf of real estate owners and developers."
startups,3beebl,cluless22,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:41:45 2015 UTC,This should be higher.  Most hotel chains don't own the real estate and just make fees and % of revenues for management services.  Airbnb's business model is quite a bit closer to Marriott than lots of people think.

startups,3beebl,JustThall,5,Sun Jun 28 14:00:01 2015 UTC,"I think Airbnb has much more data than the traditional hotel chains. First off, most hotel chains have to focus on a specific tier of housing. For example, Marriott is pretty high end. Your typical broke college kid is not very likely to stay at a Marriott and much more likely to stay at a local hostel.  Airbnb's beauty is its positioning as a platform. The seperate listings can cater to anyone's needs - a cheap couch in the living room, to a top floor penthouse in major cities.  Additionally, using the data is still very hard. Data science is in its infancy and talent is hard to come by. Top data scientists are being paid like sports stars. Airbnb's name/growth/potential is much more attractive than what Marriott or another hotel chain can offer."

Now that I think of it, and this may have been mentioned before by others here, how much does it cost to build and/or maintain each unit? That doesn't seem like an issue that greatly impacts AirBnB whereas for Marriott that issue has a pretty significant impact on their bottom-line."
startups,3beebl,coffeeonsunday,2,Sun Jun 28 22:11:01 2015 UTC,"You could argue that because airbnb does not own the properties, it has little to no overhead, it doesn't have to worry about so many little variables.

Kinda like how a fiat currency allows the growth of money a lot more than a gold base currency."

startups,3beebl,987f,2,Sun Jun 28 22:06:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah your right, but once you have that foundation oftechnical management in place you can kinda automate the entire system, with custom service you can create a framework in which you add/remove people without your customers knowing.   However with Airbnb, they could take on 100k new properties tommorow, and there would be little difference in how their system operates (assuming they have a stable system setup already). Were as the Marrior has to deal with property developers, landlords, estate agents, lawyers on an almost case by case basis which would make it so much slower. Not only that but it also needs to have cash on hand or it needs to rack up debt to afford these places, and then theres the chance that it might not make money.   Airbnb has very few of those issues, it may have to have some money on hand for insurance purposes, but only as much if not less than the Marriott. But Airbnb is basically profitable from the get-go, you put a property up on the site (cost them nothing), you rent your property, they get a commision, thats it.   It's a system changer, like how uber was a system changer to the taxi industry, you can completely disrupt a physical business without ever having to physically compete with them in anyway."

I know West Hollywood is getting close to banning also. I think its fine if you own the house or condo and want to rent, but most of the AirBNB rentals in Los Angeles  that i've seen seem like apartments that people are renting. I saw three people in my old building get booted for only renting the apt to use for airBNB, not that building will not let people use AirBNB. The app might have to become a rental service from people that own their own homes or apt's, which takes a large chunk out of the places to stay on the app. Personally all the AirBNB's that I have stayed at were renters, that about 12 stays across the country."

Apartment buildings, condo buildings, etc. aren't really playing ball anymore. I think there will end up being a huge reversal of the number of listings in the future."
startups,3beebl,pershingcubed,3,Mon Jun 29 01:56:06 2015 UTC,"I worked at Airbnb for a while so I have a bit of insight into this.  The tl;dr is that the valuation is based on 1 thing and 1 thing only. Financial numbers. Airbnb is in a huge market and has been growing exponentially for years. Unless something goes wrong they'll be one of the largest companies in the world within a decade.   AirBnb has somewhere around 600k ""properties"" and Marriot has around 4,000.   This is an inherently flawed line of reasoning. Not having to own expensive physical properties is a huge advantage Airbnb has. They get to profit by being the middle man which scales much much better.   The AirBnb barrier to entry is being their first, not structural (which I'm not fully discounting, it is just less concrete).   No. Many of their competitors started before them. The Airbnb barrier to entry is their network effects. On Airbnb a single bad review can cost a host 1000s in lost rent because they'll have to lower their prices to get their listing more views to fill it. This only works because there's always another option on Airbnb because it's so much bigger than the other sites. The upside of this is that hosts to a great job.   I'm probably a 3rd wave kind of customer for AirBnb. I don't need it, don't really want it, but would try it now that I've heard so much about it. I think their safety aspects for the consumer are questionable.   Trust and safety is definitely still one of the biggest challenges Airbnb has. However a big part of the reason they are where they are is that they have excellent retention. Most people who use Airbnb will never use a hotel again if Airbnb is an option. You should try it! I bet you'd love it.   Can AirBnb grow 83% again? They likely can in listings, but are there people interested in the product?   Yes. Airbnb has been a supply constrained market since very early in its life and continues to be so. An increase in listings has always directly corresponded to an increase in bookings."
startups,3beebl,ProfessionalShill,2,Mon Jun 29 05:45:40 2015 UTC,"Interesting response. I don't think the properties or units comparison are as flawed as you think since apparently Marriot operates in a similar fashion actually for many of their properties which they just manage, units produce the revenue, and price per unit is the baseline of value for a consumer.  Interesting that it is supply constrained in your opinion and will be well into the future. Where were these people staying prior to this? Who's lunch is AirBnb eating?"
startups,3beebl,drule101,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:03:58 2015 UTC,"this is the answer. In addition, Peter Thiel talks about valuation in his book Zero to One in the following format: • Cash flow and perceived cash flow is what gives a company a valuation that may not reflect in their current profit margin ratios at present.    The value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future(must also discount those future cash flows to their present worth since a given amount today is worth more than the same amount in the future). Technology companies often lose money the first few years. It takes time to build valuable things; therefore, delayed revenue. Most of their value comes 10-15 years in the future Growth is easy to measure; durability isn’t. Companies must endure and that's where their future value is illicted."
startups,3beebl,sachbl,5,Sun Jun 28 21:00:48 2015 UTC,"Here's what I know about AirBnB: I haven't used it, however I had my house for sale and all of a sudden it was on the website. Turns out my neighbor put it on the website to see how much money he could get if he bought it and then rented it. So that was a fake listing on the site. Another thing I know is that he lied about his name and said he was a cop. He's not a cop. A third thing is that we contacted AirBnB and they never got back to us at all or did anything.   Not saying any opinion because I don't know how to feel, but just saying my whole experience with the site.   On a side-note, condo boards don't like having their apartments rented out, so there may be a decrease in properties, pushing people back to hots."

Attach a camera to the head of the blind person, preverrably in the form of a pair of glasses, send the video signal to a small computer, like a raspberri pi, that takes this signal, greyscale it, possibly does some additional tweaking of the image to accetuate details and then send it to a mat attached to a large area of skin, like the back or the belly; Where there is a light area, the mat should press down, like a braille display and it it's dark it should not. With training a blind person should be able to see to some extent.

Here is a list of the qualities of a good founder by inc.com : http://www.inc.com/ilya-pozin/5-qualities-of-successful-founders.html They are all compatible with the fact that you're an electrical engineer student :)  As a program manage in a tech accelerator (Startup42), I met a few startup founders. You can definitely find a startup idea where your input as an electrical engineer matters, and you can be a great founder if you have the qualities mentioned in the article.  Take a look at this startup that created a Circuit Board Prototyping Machine (kinda like a 3D printer) for instance https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voltera/voltera-your-circuit-board-prototyping-machine?ref=b9x1eo  Try to go to as many startup networking events as you can and read books on the topic (like Zero to One by Peter Thiel) and ideas will start to spur :)"

startups,3bfr8r,Chuck3131,6,Sun Jun 28 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"I think the most obvious barrier is Android fragmentation as other have mentioned - a million different handsets and all of everyone running different releases; but there's also the fact that iOS developer tools are soooo nice compared to the crap you have to put up with developing for Android.  It's great that Android are ditching Eclipse for IntelliJ, but it's still lightyears away from iOS on xCode with LLVM.  Take for example the iOS Simulator vs Android Emulator. iOS simulator runs your apps super fast. Android Emulator is incredibly slow unless you use HAXM - which seems to cause things to become super fragile. It needs sooo much handholding and sooo many tweaks to configuration profiles - and then you're still not sure if you're emulating anything near the sort of hardware you were intending.  It really feels like Android was thrown together in a rush in order to play catch up with iOS and there are still fundamental things, like the SDK, that really are just subpar."

Those people tend to make for crumby customers.  20 bucks vs 100 for registration is a rounding error on the actual cost of development, which is significantly higher on android because of having to test on so many kinds of devices."
startups,3bfr8r,imack06,3,Sun Jun 28 21:18:00 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine is developing an app for iOS and android. He says that android is infinitely harder to build an app for - particularly if you want to utilise camera functionality in any way.   For comparison, he has 4 people working with him on android and 2 on iOS, and the iOS version of his app is at least 3 months ahead of the android version.   It's just very hard to get a cross device app that works well on every android phone without putting in a lot of effort. For most developers, it makes more sense to just test the product on iOS first before committing all those resources to android."
startups,3bfr8r,tsanity,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:11:44 2015 UTC,Same here. Our Songtive 1.0 app version was build for 3 months and it took about 9 months to build the first-very-raw version for Android...

Although the Android market is slightly bigger, something like 60% Android 40% iOS.  Now depending on your app category you can find a benefit for either platform.  It really comes down to what you're tying to accomplish.  But I think most people would agree that Android is unnecessarily difficult as well and would rather wait to enter that market."
startups,3bfr8r,Robby_Rob,2,Mon Jun 29 05:06:37 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion, but I believe there is a difference between the average Android user and the average iPhone user. As a product/ brand, the iPhone is beautifully designed - and everything about it revolves around UX, UI and details. From my armchair research and personal experience, iPhone users therefore care more about looks, interactions and the experience than latency, speed and optimizations.  As a startup, you first want to crack these basics in form and function before you start worrying about optimizing things. You want to build for one device, one type of user, get their feedback, and get to Product/Market Fit asap.   So it kind of makes sense to build for iOS first. Nail the design, interaction and experience for the 1/4 of your userbase that are strongly similar in their tastes and aesthetics. Then try and port it out to the 700,0000 devices on android. And finally patch it up for speed and efficiency."

We developed first for iOS(with a lot of the code in a shared lib) and it took us around 1 month to get android up and running which is pretty impressive, because others in our market with bigger teams took around 1 year to get theirs on Android.  Our main problem was GUI on Android, only because it looks good on one device doesn't mean it will be even usable on the other devices(and I dont mean because of size of specific elements, the behaviour of the GUI seems to change a lot)"
startups,3bfr8r,michiluki,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:11:12 2015 UTC,"Even with a team that knows what it is doing add at least 20% to dev and testing at a minimum over iOS. Also worth checking out is a CMS to App strategy with a set-up such as AEM > PhoneGap > iOS/Android (Adobe's other App pathway Illustrator > DPS > iOS/Android makes for pretty brochureware but is functionally a nightmare). AEM is not cheap but you can maintain a decent ""point of truth"" with your publishing strategy."
startups,3bfr8r,DashAndGander,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:27:41 2015 UTC,I think it is all down to how complex the android ecosystem is and android has different versions of phone sizes. For a startup looking to build apps they might find it too difficult to support all types of devices on androids so therefore they will be more strap cash.  On the iPhones you only need to focus on building on 1 version of devices that can reach millions of people worldwide.
startups,3bfr8r,drule101,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:50:00 2015 UTC,"Like said already, the big reason behind this is simply market share and fragmentation of Android. To be honest though, I think there will be a certain obsoleteness of dedicated platform apps in the future - there's already companies getting on the band-wagon now.  In the future an 'app' will be JavaScript, responsive to any screen size (desktop, mobile, tablet...) and then potentially compiled in order to get it on a platforms App Store (Apple won't like losing their 30% revenue share!). A lot of companies are already starting to adopt this approach and it's definitely an exciting prospect. Means you get the full functionality, less expenditure on dedicated platform developers to change and maintain features, and quicker releases to the users."
startups,3bfr8r,steven_hammond,-1,Mon Jun 29 05:00:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why, but this is another reason to use services like PhoneGap that let you build an app in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML and it automatically compiles it to android, iOS, and Windows Phone. Plus, then you don't need to learn Java, Swift, C#, etc. and can just use what you know from basic web development. There's also Xamarin that lets you do the same things, but you would write the program in C#."

In reality, the development is awful and for the most part you loose the advantages that were supposed to be gained from developing for a phone/device in the first place.  All that aside, the performance isn't acceptable except for the smallest of apps, and even then there is a noticeable lag in user interaction.  In theory it's great, but the whole build once and run everywhere idea isn't every going to work.  There are just too many variables to account for.  Note: When I say ""hybrid apps"" I'm referring to the PhoneGap/Cordova platform using web tech.  I don't actually have any experience with Xarmarin so can't comment on that, but C# would have to offer better performance than JS."
startups,3bfr8r,alt51,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:25:05 2015 UTC,"I did some work with a hybrid app last year and it worked well.  I was able to create a plugin for a native library built with the NDK and access it through Javascript.  It was a SIP library (PJSIP) and I was able to make calls with the hybrid app.  Since Android 4.x, performance for hybrid apps is much, much better (the input lag you mentioned isn't a problem any more), but you still have to worry about issues with the different WebView implementations across manufacturers.  One way around that is to bundle Crosswalk with your app and use that instead of a regular WebView.  Crosswalk is very nice and fast, but it will add something like 20MB to your app size."

In Australia you need an imaginatively-named Australian Business Number (ABN) for a business. Wherever you live probably has the same sort of thing.  I'd recommend also seeking out any local coworking spaces for networking and potentially somewhere to work if a home office is an issue.

It could be a non-compete clause issue (if you somehow compete with apple) or it could be an assignment clause depending on his job.

startups,3bd82b,customheart,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:02:43 2015 UTC,"Usually there is a non complete clause https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause which, depending on how his employer has written it, may prevent him for some defined period of time from working on a side project even if he or she were to leave the company. Usually it states this in the context of ""competing"", but software is often especially broad that it may even apply to things that do not seem like direct competition (that is if the company's lawyers feel it the effort to make a case for that).   If you both feel that it doesn't qualify as competing, so long as he's not working on the side project during company time, you can go ahead with it and always lawyer up to defend yourself if the company ever does feel the need to take issue with their former employee. You should of course have at least a consultation with a contract lawyer upfront if you are really that worried about it."

startups,3beie6,f00gers,2,Sun Jun 28 21:06:06 2015 UTC,"Some things to note about start ups I've met is a lot don't have any real funding. Granted I'm no where near any VC's but a lot only have enough for their MVP.   Yeah this is what I have noticed and honestly I know it is expected. The thing that is blowing me away is how many startups on AL are getting hundreds of applicants a day for free internships/potential equity.   Unless these interns are actually passionate about the industry, the project and experienced in content creation/curation/online outreach/distribution/SEO/social etc, wouldn't bringing them in be a lot of wasted time when you need X amount of users/targeted traffic to raise more money and reach growth milestones ASAP?  I can understand having interns handle basic social stuff and customer service outreach etc, but I get the feeling that a lot of ""marketing interns"" are basically going through the motions of posting online in different places with no real growth strategy/aggressive channel testing etc.   I understand that is they can afford and better than nothing, but seems like A LOT of time spent communicating tasks rather than actually growing traffic/users? If the interns are assisting paid employees/managers I'm sure things can and obviously do turn out different, but just relying on interns giving them some blog posts and social accounts to handle hoping that people will notice the startup project?   I just get the impression that a lot of startups don't realize the amount of traffic you need coming in to make an impact? Social accounts with a few hundred followers, vague social posts with little to no interaction, generic topical blog posts aren't likely to get them where they need to go? Is this kind of ""marketing filler"" more valuable than having nothing at all for the startup in a lot of cases?   Another problem is a lot of businesses don't understand the importance of good design. Many think it's just pretty pictures, colors, and words. Hence why everyone just jumps towards Fiverr and calls it day.   For sure. I'm definitely guilty of going the ""function"" over ""form"" route many times for projects too. I can understand being ""lean"", but the facts indicate that simple changes on landing pages for example can make HUGE differences.  I feel like on one hand I can understand not wanting to focus on design as a startup, but when you seen the kinds of ROI changes that occur in different industries when it comes to branding/design changes...you can see just how important design can be. How many startups would grow with design/branding changes, based on their already occuring traffic?   I'm strongly against unpaid internships, being one sucked I'll never do that to a person. Work is work, if you can't afford them, then you deserve to have one.   I just don't see how in any but the most basic tasks they could really accelerate startups to get from A to B. For a lot of industries I think it takes a lot more creativity/strategy outside of ""basic tasks"" like just going through the motions trying to get noticed online. Still I guess basic tasks are better than nothing if it is free? I still feel like these founders have to be spending serious amount of time trying to introduce new interns to the industry/project/assigning basic tasks needed.    OP, if you're interested pm me for my info.   Yeah my goal would be to get a chat going or something similar."

Absolutely. I wouldn't be surprise if the case is these kids don't know any better or even know their self worth. When I started out freelancing, I learn real fast no is going to value you if you don't value yourself.  There's also a bit of the capitalistic mindset in cutting overhead to generate more profits. I'm sure most successful businesses had to hit some grey areas of ethics in the past to get where they are now.

Is this kind of ""marketing filler"" more valuable than having nothing at all for the startup in a lot of cases?   I feel the misconception in generating content is they try to copy other's successes and wondering why it doesn't work for them. Start ups need to ask themselves why they are generating content because it seems like they are doing it just because everyone else is.

In many states, when two or more people begin a joint venture they are considered to be in a general partnership by default (i.e., unless you have formed a valid entity such as an LLC).  I found this article online:  http://www.pashalaw.com/fall-general-partnership  So, if you do not want to be subject to the duties and obligations of a general partnership then you need to incorporate in some form or another.   What's the best type of incorporation for hardware startups?    Depends on where you are located, and what you intend to do.  Here's another article I found on the google: http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/38822   What are thoughts on using a lawyer vs doing it ourselves?    Lawyers are the only ones qualified to give you legal advice.  If you are serious about your venture then you need to make sure you understand the consequences of the decisions you are making now regarding your business.   You either need to do a lot of reading and learning yourself or you need to hire an attorney."

Having you put in the majority of the investment makes sense to me since you're the none tech, but it's also a good idea to have the CTO invest so that he has ""skin in the game"".

However, they were paying close attention to how people were using the game. What were the good/bad metrics. And they noticed one feature was overused by the players: the photo sharing mechanism inside the chat! So they stopped the game and launched a new product out of that feature: Flickr. Bought by Yahoo! a few years later.  A few years later he goes on another journey to create a game. This time he's a lot more informed on how to manage a team. But he's not satisfied with the messaging systems the team uses. So he starts to build their own messaging service. It was so good that they stared too open it to the world.

I'm partial to TestRail, but find something that works with your current bug tracking tools.  Aside from that, start to set up the foundations of TDD (Test Driven Development) and creating automated acceptance tests.  Automatic UI testing (like Selenium) is also helpful."
startups,3b9riv,Mr4Strings,2,Sat Jun 27 12:25:31 2015 UTC,"As you have mentioned that your first task is going to be gathering requirements, I would recommend, map your requirements to acceptance criteria. In that way you have something to start with. Then if you are familiar with Selenium, start creating your BDD kinda test framework that uses the acceptance criteria you have created while requirement gathering. That way you will ensure that your acceptance criteria is automated. This can be your baseline for test automation. Next time when anything new is developed or existing stuff modified, you can run the automated test suite to ensure that your acceptance criteria for features are still intact.  Depending on what  bug tracking and reporting tool you use, try to see if you can integrate your testing with those tools.  For mobile you can start with Appium. If you are using Selenium, you are covered for mobile automation as well.  Hope this helps!"

startups,3b6huj,GuruCam,27,Fri Jun 26 10:52:20 2015 UTC,"Hey, just a little warning that you should take with a large grain of salt. I'm prefacing this post with the disclaimer that I am going to be making a strong assumption that may not apply to everyone ITT or in this subreddit. Here goes:  If your friend wants to invest in a startup, he should try and find friends, or friends of friends through social platforms (FB, LinkedIn), etc. rather than looking for people to give money to on reddit. The r/startups community is great, but that doesn't stop it from being an anonymous gathering of people. Generally, startups like only taking money from people who they know, or who someone has recommended to them, unless the people they know are famous investors, in which case they likely got a recommendation from someone who knew them anyway.   This brings me on to my next point, which is that if a company is looking for investment on reddit so readily, one of two things has happened:   The company saw someone like you posting and is taking the money the easy way because they haven't started reaching out to investors yet. In this case, your friend does not want to invest because the company may be too early for an investment raise, and giving a company a random $20k this early will actually be bad for them because they will likely have no plan about what to do with it. The company is getting desperate and has had no luck with investors so far, sees your post on reddit, easy $20k. In this case, you definitely do not want to be the first to invest because your friend is not an experienced investor and losing this amount would leave a significant hole in his wallet. There ARE many seasoned investors, who will invest in a company no one else has invested in because they personally believe in the founders or idea and they'll risk bringing a company like this out of the dumps for the 1% chance that it will explode (positively). This investor, however, likely wipes his ass with $20,000 and so this wouldn't be near a significant loss for him.   TL;DR your friend should either be investing in a startup that is run by someone who he connected with through a friend, or one that has been invested in carefully by several investors that your friend might know, and needs a $10-20k top-up. Both scenarios are much less risky (still incredibly risky), than what he is doing right now, which is going to reddit."

Whereas if you dive straight into another company with that money there's no guarantee that the company will survive.  With all that said, if you want to invest in a startup, think about dividing that money by 4 and investing it into 4 different startups - higher probability of having a startup succeed.  Obviously 20k may not be enough to do this, but with an inevitable rise in poplulation, there will always be a high demand for housing. You just need to do your research and make the right connections and in 10 years you could be a multimillionaire from it. From experience I have seen people go from nothing to everything and having that 20k gives you a huge headstart.  Also meet more people, your success will 'generally' be based on who you know."

This is going to be kind of difficult as people looking for investment can't ask people they don't know to invest due the SEC bans on general solicitation.  Sooo, how to get around this?  Get to know them.  How to do that?  There are a few routes.  There are companies that are actually in the business of making introductions to kick off these relationships that can eventually lead to investments.  There are also meetups for entrepreneurs and tech folk who are likely to be entrepreneurs or know some.  My advice would be to find where these people are gathered, drop in, have a few drinks and get to know people.  Find out what they are like and what they are doing and when you find something you like offer to invest.  Trouble is, these groups tend to be concentrated around metropolitan areas.  I am not sure if there are any online social networking communities for this space or even if that would be very effective.  Maybe a metro area is not strictly necessary and there are some large towns around with similar groups.  Otherwise, maybe he could make a daytrip out of it once every couple of weeks.  Go to some meetups, get some introductions, get a feel for the scene and keep in contact with people he likes until he is ready to pop the question.  Keep in mind that many entrepreneurs will not be willing to take investment since having such a relatively small amount from a non-accredited investor might be more trouble than it is worth since they are limited in how many non-accredited investors they can take on."

startups,3b6l85,kowdermesiter,7,Fri Jun 26 11:36:49 2015 UTC,"Hello. I understand. It's daunting to start with 0 or 10 followers and try to grow an audience. Especially when you look at your heros and see they have 150,000 subscribers, or 1 million Twitter followers. But they started with 0 once too.   I've done well building an audience for my blog at http://ninjasandrobots.com which has led to my writing on Fast Company, Life Hacker, New York Observer, etc., and now on Basecamp's Signal v. Noise (signalvnoise.com/writers/n8) Here are some of the things that have helped me:   1) Play the long game. You aren't going to see success on the timeline you are probably hoping for. We all want these things faster. But it takes a long commitment. Which means, writing and blogging should be fun for you even when there's no one reading. If it's not, I wouldn't spend time on it. There's other things you could be doing that you'd enjoy during our short lives :)  I've been writing and blogging for over decade. It's only in the last 4 years it's taken off for me and given me a great channel to reach people.   2) Focus on getting better. This decade of writing hasn't been mindless posting. I've worked my ass off trying to become a better writer. Studying what makes people interesting. How do speech writers make such an emotional impact. How does Malcolm Gladwell tell a story. On and on. I've taken classes, read a ton of books, and just practiced and practiced.   Write a ton, but post much less. Write a ton, drafts of the same thing. Write a ton, and edit later. The progress will pay off. Even if your projects and blogs don't turn into exactly what you want, becoming a more interesting writer is useful everywhere in life.   3) Answer more questions helping people with things. This post is a great example. Share some advice, and let people know if you've written more about a topic somewhere. Helping people on a forum like Reddit or Quora or wherever is a great place to start dropping your name and where people can find you.  4) Repeat yourself. Don't make everything unique. Too many people write something and then it's dead. Keep recycling it into other things. Turn a blog post into a video. Turn it into advice for a Reddit answer. Turn it into an ebook. Turn it into an article for a magazine.   5) Magazines. Get good enough at writing, and you can start sending Tweets and emails to editors at magazines. They are always looking for new things. And they'll link back to your blog and help grow your stuff.   6) Team up. Find some other writers, help edit each other's work, and then make sure you all cross promote each other. Noah Kagan does with a handful of others. I did this too with Product Hunt founder, Ryan Hoover. He gathered a group of us, asked us all to blog about the same topic, we all edited at each others stuff, and all agreed to post our writing at the exact same time, linking back to the list of everyone's post. It's like a modern ""blog circle"". Great way to meet some new friends and share each others traffic. I'm sure you can find some like minds here who will do that too.  7) Write about other people and let them know. Study how other people especially alive work and what they are doing. Then write up lessons you've learned from them. Then make sure you let those people know you've written about them!   I've gotten a ton of traffic from folks like Jason Fried (https://twitter.com/jasonfried) or Tim Ferriss (https://twitter.com/tferriss) because I've written about them, their projects, and what they've taught me. Let them know on Twitter or email that I've written about them. And then they tell all their followers to check it out.   8) There's a lot of Reddit like sites out there. For products and writing and design and hacker news, etc. There's a bunch of places you could be promoting your work. It probably won't get the traffic you want at first from these places. But once you learn your craft better, interest will grow.  9) Don't forget to ask for a follow or newsletter signup!  Dustin Curtis (https://twitter.com/dcurtis), writer and designer, did an experiment on getting people to follow him on Twitter. Simply adding ""You should follow me on Twitter: here"" at the end of his articles. Twitter followers went up a ton. I mimicked this and I grew my audience by 335% in a single week.   You often don't get what you don't ask for. So don't forget to end your posts for a follow or signup to your newsletter.     If I can be of anymore help, please just ask. Twitter is a good place to reach me: https://twitter.com/natekontny."

I tend to easily abandon new things where I don't see instant success factor, but sometimes I can get real attached to things over long periods of time. I'm ok with blogging, but not really into it for the joy. I write code for the latter.

I've heard Malcolm Gladwell talk about looking back on his old writing and cringing. Writing is a hard craft just like anything is. It's going to take a long time to get good at it. But yeah, if you aren't enjoying it, I wouldn't do it. Life's too short, and I doubt you'll stick with it long enough to get better and then get the payoff you want.   I'd find another way. Use code then as a way of drawing an audience. Create and contribute to more open source projects. Release more things. Every release is a chance to get people excited and point them at things you're doing. Every release of an open source project I make sure to write up a great Readme that points to other places people can follow me:   https://github.com/n8  Don't squander those assets.   Also teach more. Don't focus on writing, but on teaching other people to code. Show people something on a youtube video, or teach an online class even. Show off code samples.   There's a lot of great ways to get people to engage if you focus on teaching people things you also really enjoy."

Okay, I feel I have to stop you right here. Your approach isn't wrong. Blogging is powerful and it does drive business. I can attest to that.   Your attitude is what's wrong   If you want to drive business using your blog, then just give something before you're asking to receive. Help people. They will start following you and sharing your posts. But it won't happen on day one.   You don't need to be a great writer  You need to be consistent. And you need to share actionable stuff that helps other people with their work (that's not to say essays don't get shared, but I wouldn't say that kind of content could be directly translated into business value).   What you want to do is called ""content marketing""  To be successful at it, you'd want to be solving problems with your writing. And, not just about any problems--problems directly related to the problem your product solves. This means that at the end of each post it will make sense for people to try out your product because you reminded them of related problems. You have to mention your products and services in context.   And speaking of context... Context is king!  A paraphrase of a super-clichéd slogan. What I mean to say is this: Context determines the success of any attempt to promote anything. If you mention your product in context, people will be interested to learn more about it. If you mention your blog posts in context (like I'm going to do in just a few more sentences), people will click on your links and they will be happy to read your blog posts. Because it makes sense. We're desperate for things to make sense in life.   Always be the first to give  Provide value, give away helpful tips, cheatsheets, free products and then share your links in the context of the conversation. Then ask people for their email addresses or whatever else you want from them.   Promotion is... just simple human-to-human interaction  If there is one thing I learned, as a copywriter and marketer, it's that promotion is just human interaction. It doesn't require special magic tricks (although you could employ persuasion tactics). Just think about it as a normal conversation. If you weren't thinking ""Hell, I need to promote this post. But... how could I spam people? I tried and nobody pays attention!"" and instead you were thinking ""Okay, I wrote that and it's pretty good. I'm sure somebody could find it helpful. Let me go around the internet and try to start conversations related to what I just wrote."", then you'd be more successful and you'll actually enjoy it. Because the fact that you spent your time writing on that topic means that you care. And you will enjoy talking to other people who care about the same topic.   With that being said, you can read more about how blogging helped us and our business here.   And no, I'm not going to try and sell you anything with that post. I wrote it because I was happy and wanted to share the experience and inspire other people to blog. Still, one day... I might attach an email list to it and start teaching others how to blog, right?   Oh, hey, I just wrote another blog post. See? It's pretty easy. :)  I hope this makes sense.  P.S.: Clicked that Twitter link and found the landing page of your app, the one you want to promote, I suppose. Your copy could use a bit of work. PM me for more info on that."

startups,3b6l85,Fristy4,2,Fri Jun 26 16:59:42 2015 UTC,"Happy to help. :)    Let me go around the internet and try to start conversations That's my problem. How do you do it that's not spam? I don't see much difference between promotion and starting conversations.   Well, when you're not thinking about promoting your blog posts, what do you normally do? That's the answer.   It might be easier at the beginning to join a conversation somebody else has started. So, someone posted a thread, asking a question that you can answer (like I did here). You chime in with something valuable. If you have a blog post that's relevant and actually digs into more details about the topic at hand it's okay to give a link for further reading in context (like I did). This could have been promotion (if I had a product to promote :D) and would have been okay, because I already helped you. You'd be actually interested to learn more about what I do/write about.   My other question is that I'm interested in a load of topics. If I start to share in a broad topic from UX to JS coding and marketing, then it will be a mess. Or not. Should I care?   I'm interested in a load of topics myself. :) And that's not a bad thing.   But I chose to make my blog very focused right now. The audience is very specific. It's niche. There aren't many other blogs so focused on startup landing pages.   I could talk to a larger audience if I wanted to. I could talk about copywriting and marketing in general, about email marketing, about customer support, about blogging, about creating info-products and so on. But that would mean my audience is just about any business owner out there. And I'd be the small fish in a big big pond.   But then I could also talk about all of these things in the context of startups. So, I could talk about copywriting for startups, email campaigns for startups, customer support in a startup, content marketing for startups, creating lead magnets that could grow the email list of a startup in beta and so on. The pond would be times smaller.  Start as the big fish in a small pond. As the go-to resource for one small audience. The topics don't really matter as long as they are interesting to the audience. What you listed up there isn't disconnected. It's actually a list of topics most startup founders or freelance web designers will be interested in. It's not like you want to talk movies and then switch to UX.   Context is what matters. Any content (piece of advice) can be put in lots of different contexts. Context depends on the audience you choose. Which brings me to:  Think in terms of audience. Who are they? Are they interested in UX? If yes, how can you help them with that?  It's not about what you want to blog about today. It's definitely not about brainstorming topics (that's total B.S., sorry). Start off by helping someone on a forum and transform that into a blog post. This ensures that you're solving a real problem which makes your post shareable and shares bring more traffic to your website. Score!   Now, all of this might still seem a bit abstract. Things can only start to fall into place when you start doing something.  But when you don't know what your next step would be, you'll postpone it.   Here's how to get started with blogging and promotion today   Go to Quora. People there seek help.  Find one question on a topic that you've written about/want to write about Write a helpful reply. Include your link where appropriate. If you don't have a link, wait for the reaction of the person/community. If you get upvotes or somebody says ""Thank you"", you did your job. Go to your blog and transform that reply into a blog post.    Note: What I just wrote to you in the context of content marketing for a startup is the same piece of advice that I used as content for a blog post targeted at freelancers."

Asana - Not visual enough, it's harder to generate a high-level picture I can comprehend at a glance. Engineers tended to like this one a bit more.  Jira, Pivotal - only a little experience here. Both felt too big and bloated for our current needs.  In addition I use:   Spreadsheets for high-level / longer-term planning I write functional specs in Powerpoint or if it's really big, a google doc + powerpoint for flows Visual specs in AI, outputted to PDF Tons of checklists within Trello cards as it moves through functional > design > development to keep each group on track with deliverables   Uservoice has a decent post on how they set up their tool stack that helped get me off the ground a year ago: https://community.uservoice.com/blog/trello-google-docs-product-management/  My process is a bit different now, but the uservoice core is a decent place to start and tweak to suit the team/nature of work."

startups,3b4co8,jstandard,2,Thu Jun 25 23:53:32 2015 UTC,"Breaking down stories/features into the right level of atomization is equal parts art and science, depending on how quickly you need to get working on something.  I group very closely related features/use cases into a single card, then create a checklist item for each ""atomized"" feature. When reviewing with a dev, if a checklist item looks big/complex/time-consuming and can reliably be separated, I'll break it out as another card, assign it a priority, and order it in the backlog.  As you mention above, Pivotal is a little better tuned to that part of the process (but lacking in others).  In Trello, Checklists, daily board monitoring, and saved searches (gold feature, but you can also just paste them into a word doc) help me slice and dice the boards quickly."

startups,3b4co8,mr-aaron-gray,3,Fri Jun 26 21:36:06 2015 UTC,"Our entire company is 8 people: 4 engineers, 1 PM (me), 2 designers, and marketing/biz dev/admin spread across a few of us.   I started using Trello + spreadsheets from the beginning, was also using Github for bugs until we centralized bug reporting and product backlog under 1 roof in Trello. (some big trade offs here, but it's net positive so far)  I'll mention a few things about us that give context to our tooling/processes:   We're early stage and our product is undergoing large, rapid change Things get messy at the schedule ""micro-level"" I've adapted a light form of Agile/Scrum as some parts of Agile/Scrum aren't flexible enough for how quickly things are changing (even at the 2 weeks sprint level). Externally this looks chaotic, but internally it works because we make it a point to relentlessly communicate.   That said, I still follow a lot of the standard practices of defining our end functional goals of the sprint are, breaking apart features/stories into varying chunks, prioritizing the chunks, mapping a high-level schedule, tracking progress against it, re-prioritizing and compromising as deadlines loom, etc.  The basic idea is:   Build the sprint backlog of high-level features on a planning board in Trello, adding high-level feature descriptions. Sit down with engineering and run through high-level points estimates. (more easily done via a google spreadsheet) Reshape the sprint backlog in Trello if needed Build high-level deliverable schedule in Spreadsheets Breakdown sprint backlog cards into the right levels of depth for  design to get started (on a design board) Once design is finished, break them down into the right levels for engineering (on a development board) Turn up ""G&R - Welcome to the Jungle"" and get cranking."

startups,3b4co8,kshitagarbha,4,Fri Jun 26 03:36:58 2015 UTC,"I've used trello and jira pretty extensively.  Trello is the easiest to use, and it's basically a card/task organizer without opinions. You'll have to come up with your own processes and have a little bit of discipline with Trello, but it stays out of the way and lets you get stuff done.  Jira is the reverse. It works with standardized processes like Scrum or Kanban really well. And if you're following these processes, it gives you some pretty awesome reports and stuff like velocity calculation, burndown charts, etc. It also usually plays well with other Atlassian products - branches and pull requests in Bitbucket can be created straight from Jira and often if you name the branch the title of the card it'll automatically find and link it for you (though I don't know how difficult it was to set that up). However, if you want to do something a little different than the norm for these standardized processes, it's kinda kludgey (for example, rather than create a separate task for QA testing and assigning it to the testers we prefer to just assign the tester to that card once it's in the testing phase - it's understood that it's the testing task you're doing, we don't need the redundant card. Since tasks are only done by one person in Scrum/Kanban, Jira doesn't allow multiple people to be assigned so in the reports it appears that the only people who finish tasks are the testers since they're the ones assigned at the end; also, there may be some way to do this because there's tons of stuff hidden in layers of settings and submenus in Jira, but if there is a way it's not obvious).  I prefer Trello, but you have to have either a really small team or a really disciplined team to make it work since it's basically free-form cards. In a bigger or less disciplined team, Jira's hand-holding is probably better. And from a pure software standpoint, Trello seems to follow a more Unix-ish philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well, and I like that. Jira on the other hand seems like it's trying to do everything, which makes things sort of cluttered and annoying."

startups,3b4co8,jm838,2,Thu Jun 25 23:31:21 2015 UTC,I feel like I've started to outgrow Trello.  I'm curious about your experience with Pivotal Tracker and Jira though.  What sorts of things are missing from PT and what's overbuilt in Jira?  What did you like with those two?
startups,3b4co8,taylorlistens,3,Thu Jun 25 23:54:39 2015 UTC,"Sure! :-)  Jira:   Jira gives you enough rope to do almost anything, which is a good thing. Unfortunately, they give you so much rope that you are going to find yourself tangled up no matter what you end up doing. Jira has so many features that it is painful to use. Onboarding new users is time-consuming... there are so many things to click on that their software is anything but self-explanatory. It seems like there are 3 ways to do everything, and none of them are quick and easy. Most tasks take longer in Jira than in Pivotal Tracker or Trello. Click fatigue is real, and Jira will give you a bad case of it. When we were using Jira, I found that I spent more time talking about what I was working on than actually working.   Pivotal Tracker:   Pivotal Tracker's api was probably my favorite thing about it. Some guys on our team coded up some command line apps that used the api so that we could move stories, comment, etc. all through our terminal and we never had to use their web interface. That was really cool. Their overhaul/new beta version took forever. I feel like they do not move quickly when they are improving their product. Their design and UI was dated for years. Also, it used flash (I think it still does) for some things instead of good ole' HTML/JavaScript. It was not keyboard friendly when I was using it. Their rigid process of Icebox/Backlog/Started/Delivered/Accepted sounds like a good thing, but it will bite you when you scale your team and your SCM process gets more complex. And Pivotal refuses to add more states. So it becomes almost impossible to figure out what tickets you were working on last sprint, which ones you wanted to finish, etc. etc. So you start shoehorning new process states by creating tags and updating them all manually as a ticket moves. Then you start using release banners to denote sprints. And thus the path to insanity begins..."
startups,3b4co8,mostlyemptyspace,3,Fri Jun 26 00:47:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for sharing your experiences! I've used Jira at another company and my biggest gripe about it was that it was just so overbuilt as well.  Plus I found myself getting lost really often and I was never really sure whether an action I took would completely change the view or if it would just open in the page.  Plus, using the sprint planning functionality was a nightmare on mobile...  In my very limited experience with using Pivotal Tracker, I absolutely experienced what you described with using tags to denote sprints, releases, etc.  It actually became nearly impossible to actually READ the stories because each is so noisy.  If I could change anything, it would definitely be to improve upon the noisiness.  On top of that, having more than 4 or 5 columns open at once makes my head explode as I stare at a wall of text, tags, and icons all mashed together..."

I wonder if there's a way for Pivotal Labs to clean it up while maintaining what we all agree are positive features.  I might hide the tags for instance, because I'm already overwhelmed by blocks of color. I might even replace it with the name of the engineer or stakeholder who is currently working on the ticket. I might even use bold to denote tickets in a sprint that haven't been picked up yet, using an email metaphor. Any other thoughts?"

startups,3b70tm,radumazilu,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:12:10 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with logo design for a small business is that it's often the time when money is tight.  I think everyone can understand the importance of a nice logo and hope they get it right on the first go, but the problem is that good logo design is expensive.  I'm currently going through this where we don't have the funds to pay for a good designer.  We will likely go the route of 99designs and spend $300 or so on a logo.  The fear (for lack of a better word) I have with going with a single graphic designer like yourself is I pay the money and I don't get something I like.  That's the appeal of 99designs, you get lots of people submitting work.  So perhaps you need to emphasize the process of back and forth to help assure customers they will get what they want.  When I see a site like yours (and it's very nice) I immediately think that it's going to be thousands of dollars for a design (and perhaps it is) so a new small business may not be your target.  Maybe you are more so looking for existing small businesses that have some funds to pay for a good logo design."

But over and over again I see people caught at the name stage. Then, even when they do come up with a name, then the process of finding a good url comes up. And they get stuck again. So much energy and thought that could be spent making things people want to use and are different from everyone else.  I'd give yourself a deadline and launch the thing. Use the name you've got by then. If you come up with a better one later, change it.   And don't worry about URLs. Tools I've made are Draft. I changed its name 3 times after people started using it. Now it's also at http://draftin.com. draftin? That's not even English. Is that like Drafting but you skip the g? Yeah, but who cares. Stick with it long enough and you can be at the top of Google for your name anyways (unless you compete with the NBA Draft :) then you have a few weeks of sports news above)   Highrise (http://highrisehq.com) is what I run today. Again, it's done well, and has the +hq.com in it's domain. Also at the top of Google for Highrise.

startups,3b90i5,spivnv,-3,Fri Jun 26 23:30:24 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Thanks for your questions and helping me map this out mentally. The biggest differentiating factor I see is how we approach the customers. I think we would like to target people who do NOT know beer and cheese rather than a connoisseur. The point of the subscription is to broaden your knowledge about various products you enjoy. The pairing of the mobile applications allows for users to discuss, share, and purchase select items they themselves have experienced. This is different than current ""beer"" or ""cheese"" clubs that simply ship you a box of stuff and that's that.   The value we are providing is new experiences with a technology base to share those experiences within your social sphere, one could recommend and purchase sampled product to their friends and loved ones. We eliminate the hassle of trying to source the product and offer one-click dropship to the customer straight from our suppliers.  Age demographic was more of just a starting point, we are focusing on individuals in their late 20's/ early 30s who have excess spending capital but aren't' quite in the ""wine club"" price range. This offers a lower cost alternative while still experiencing the finer things in life.   At the end of the day most of the current competitions is quite dry and distant from their customers, I feel I could create a strong brand that individuals could constantly interact with throught their mobile device.  Cliffs: Club + mobile app is better than just a club."

startups,3b2c2n,emanresu_sdrawkcab,5,Thu Jun 25 16:41:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not disputing that. If you want to grow, you should surround yourself with people smarter (or more experienced) than you. Not saying the slackchat is a bad idea. It'll probably help some.  If the expert doesn't know how to teach the beginner, then they are simply a bad teacher."
startups,3b2c2n,roodleguy,2,Thu Jun 25 16:57:15 2015 UTC,"If the expert doesn't know how to teach the beginner, then they are simply a bad teacher.   Well yeah, not everyone's a good teacher. But I feel like of two people with equal teaching ability, the one with a lower level of experience will be better able to teach a beginner than the one with expert-level experience, as it'll be less of a mental effort to lay things out in a way a beginner can understand for the one who can more vividly remember what it was like to be a beginner. The real problem with this is if ""lower-level"" means they don't fully understand what they're doing.  I'm thinking more about math and CS stuff though, it might not translate to business all that well."

startups,3b2c2n,roundfishbook,2,Thu Jun 25 22:44:31 2015 UTC,Just curious: any reason to not use a subreddit for the discussions? I am not sure what that other forum's capabilities are that a subreddit doesn't have.
startups,3b2c2n,businesstravis,4,Thu Jun 25 14:26:32 2015 UTC,"A subreddit is nice for broader topics. But for something like ""Hey, can I get some quick feedback on this idea!"" or ""I need someone who can quickly explain to me what shopify plan is the best for my project."" I feel something like a communication platform like Slack is better. We have different channels for different topics like #currentprojects or #idea-dump where you can quickly chime in, get into a nice discussion and then leave. Also most of the time in a chatroom you have better luck getting answers for quick answers like that, on a forum like reddit they mostly go under between all the posts that have topics which more people are interested in.  Also I have subscribed to some 'Beginner Entrepreneur' subreddit but most of them just went inactive after a few days. So I am trying this out as a new approach to see if it can work out better."

Just so that we can agree on the functional definition, I've pulled it from wikipedia: ""...a sunk cost is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered..."".  The fallacy portion in that is the belief that it can be.    As you've mentioned, some people try to develop further to attempt to reclaim the investment.  Other people spend a great deal of their time (which also has a value) to reclaim the investment, but the net result is the same.  Investing more to recover something which is not recoverable because of the delusion that it has value.    By OP's admission; it's an unfinished product, which is the center of a failed business.  So the thing that is up for sale is intellectual property that doesn't do what the creator set out for it to do.

Will they cut you off, compete in parallel, or buy you out and take over?   Right. Whether this ends up being a Joint Venture between an individual (me) and a business (them) or a Software License Agreement, I imagine they would like to put an expiration date on that contract where a renewal is required every couple of years. I'm sure any investor in the destination country would raise the same concern. As a matter of fact, it might be a deal breaker for them. I feel like the only way to put the investor's mind at ease would be to negotiate with the startup a provision in the contract that says they HAVE TO do a fair buyout based on the revenue I was able to establish up that very point. I hope that makes sense...      Would the foreign franchise use the original or your own brand? Both choices have plusses and minuses for the startup.   This definitely crossed my mind! They might be worried about hurting their brand because they would essentially be handing over operations in a foreign country to someone they don't know and let's be honest - most startups are pretty paranoid about managing every little aspect while scaling (which isn't totally unreasonable BTW). Hence, why I would most likely propose marketing under a different brand.     Thanks for your feedback!"

This is great CRM - assuming a relationship has been established between you and the client, or as a means of the community to contact you.   SMS is not a growth hack. It is playing with fire.  We have shot ourselves in the foot multiple times experimenting with growth tactics and I can say with 101% certainty that texting is like running through a minefield.   If there's one thing we've learned, it's that pitching via SMS really brings out the worst in people. Text messages are, in a way, an intimate form of communication, and receiving a sales pitch via text is like waking up to a car salesman cooking you breakfast.   It's weird. It's unnatural.   I'll even admit I have received pitches from texts. It looks like spam and feels like it came from a call center.

startups,3b51a0,9190vc,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:17:41 2015 UTC,"Experience: a year and a half in the industry; half a decade learning about coffee, studying proper brewing, practicing serving. Years of studying cooking, baking, and love for the industry. I've been around coffee my entire life, my grandfather was a coffee all day every day kind of guy and since I've been old enough to drive I've gone to coffee shops a few days a week and learned from baristas and owners both in a direct and passive sense.  Differentiation from competition: All ingredients will be made from scratch including syrups, spice blends, and pastries/baked goods. Spices will be sourced to the highest level of quality and will be bought from a local importer. One of the goals is to provide an atmosphere, a place to come and work/date/hangout and have everyone feel welcome.  There is one competition shop in 50 miles of me, there are no others in the state. I worked for the competition shop for a while and want to give them a run for their money. No shops in the area can produce a drink at the level of quality that I can. The issue is less about the drink quality however, and more more immediately about the environment it will provide.  Projected startup costs are about 40k for equipment, pricing is still needed on initial investment for spices and ingredients, need to know space before I can look into cost for seating and tables. Initially there will be only about 10 retail items for sale, I have connections and can get significant discounts on custom logo'd products including mugs and shirts. I expect to be able to undercut Starbucks by at least a dollar a drink, provide a quality brewed coffee using the proper brew method for each roast of coffee.  I've considered going the food truck route, the initial investment on that is significantly cheaper, the only tradeoff is irregular customer base. You only have regulars when you're in a specific area. The up side is setting up is being able to travel to major festivals and sell a cup of coffee for 2-3 dollars more a cup than starbucks. The reason I'm leaning away from this is because I don't want the business to be entirely about money as it will be if I get into the idea of charging more for a better cup. I think a good coffee should be available at a reasonable price point for anyone that wants a good cup.  In response to your personal side note: Well I guess it's a good thing that you wouldn't want to work for me or employ me, I want to neither employ nor be employed. However, with the fact that this business needs to be open at least 16 hours a day if not 20 I'm going to have to employ somebody, that somebody will be specifically chosen by meeting exact criteria and nothing less will be accepted. As for being employed, I don't want to be employed, this is why I want to own a business.

startups,3b51a0,Intern11,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:44:43 2015 UTC,"IMO:    Your best course of action is to start small and to make a name for yourself in your community. Start at community events and farmers markets. You can set up a small stand, focus on manual brewing methods and educating customers. Another option for the summer months is to do a cold brew.   If you read the lean startup, it will give you the right type of mindset you need since you are starting without much capital. Your goal here is to create a proof of concept and to improve your desirability for a small business loan/grant/funding, as well as to build your customer base so that you can hit the ground running once you start. You may also be able to find out what areas work best for your concept, if that is an issue.  You can also see what people are most interested first hand -- what roasts are popular, what drink variations, are they more concerned with freshness or origin, etc etc.   I don't think crowdfunding is viable for you, and neither is investment (not enough possibility for return). Your best course of action is a Small Business loan, which I think you have identified.   I would start now and go visit either your local bank or small business association and begin to develop a relationship there. It's important to show them that you are serious about this, but also to start to network with them. They are more likely to approve a loan if they have a good relationship with you and are able to see your progress over time.   Decrease your spending on yourself and start saving more money. You may not be able to secure a small business loan, so you will want to have a longer term strategy to be able to afford to start the business yourself.      What you will need is a detailed list of costs (equipment, etc), product costs (call up some roasters and get some wholesale pricing info), as well as data on your target accessible market (for a specific neighborhood, is probably best) as well as some data on how your competition is doing (cafes in that specific neighborhood, as well as the competition shop you used to work at). This means spending a day there to figure out their sales data (typical sales amount per customer, number of customers per day).   I responded to your post more in depth below. Not sure if that is useful at this point, as most of the actionable stuff is above and a lot of the stuff below is nitpicky. But at least it will give you some insight into an investors mentality. Cheers.  ""Experience: a year and a half in the industry; half a decade learning about coffee, studying proper brewing, practicing serving. Years of studying cooking, baking, and love for the industry. I've been around coffee my entire life, my grandfather was a coffee all day every day kind of guy and since I've been old enough to drive I've gone to coffee shops a few days a week and learned from baristas and owners both in a direct and passive sense.""  That's a good start.   ""Differentiation from competition: All ingredients will be made from scratch including syrups, spice blends, and pastries/baked goods. Spices will be sourced to the highest level of quality and will be bought from a local importer. One of the goals is to provide an atmosphere, a place to come and work/date/hangout and have everyone feel welcome. There is one competition shop in 50 miles of me, there are no others in the state. ""  Made from scratch sounds good (but, depends on your area/target market).   Spices shouldn't be a huge cost for a coffee shop -- listing them is a red flag for me.   When are you planning to make baked goods from scratch? This sounds good in theory, but it is a lot of effort and the payoff may not be worth it. It is probably better to partner with a local pastry maker to start with (especially if you can find someone with a similar desire for quality). No employees and you are looking to be the best at baked goods (with no training)? This seems much harder than just saying you will make great coffee and serve it with great, locally baked goods.   One similar coffee shop in 50 miles sounds risky. Is there truly a need for this, and enough to run a sustainable business? SBA will look at this similarly, and will probably be more harsh.   I worked for the competition shop for a while and want to give them a run for their money. No shops in the area can produce a drink at the level of quality that I can. The issue is less about the drink quality however, and more more immediately about the environment it will provide.  Again, proving that there is a need for this environment will be fundamental to you getting a loan/investment.   Projected startup costs are about 40k for equipment, pricing is still needed on initial investment for spices and ingredients, need to know space before I can look into cost for seating and tables. Initially there will be only about 10 retail items for sale, I have connections and can get significant discounts on custom logo'd products including mugs and shirts.  Do you have a list of equipment you will get? What espresso machine? What about manual brewers? If you're going to be baking on site, what equipment will you need? How much will the build out of a location cost? What about permits/licenses in your area?   I've considered going the food truck route, the initial investment on that is significantly cheaper, the only tradeoff is irregular customer base. You only have regulars when you're in a specific area. The up side is setting up is being able to travel to major festivals and sell a cup of coffee for 2-3 dollars more a cup than starbucks. The reason I'm leaning away from this is because I don't want the business to be entirely about money as it will be if I get into the idea of charging more for a better cup. I think a good coffee should be available at a reasonable price point for anyone that wants a good cup.  You can still have a truck and not charge more. My main point is to have some proof that you can bring customers to you and that you can establish a business model that works.   If you can do that, you're much more likely to be able to secure a loan/investment.   In response to your personal side note: Well I guess it's a good thing that you wouldn't want to work for me or employ me, I want to neither employ nor be employed. However, with the fact that this business needs to be open at least 16 hours a day if not 20 I'm going to have to employ somebody, that somebody will be specifically chosen by meeting exact criteria and nothing less will be accepted. As for being employed, I don't want to be employed, this is why I want to own a business.  In my experience, this type of attitude doesn't lead to positive things. Maybe it will work for you. It's just not a pleasant way to look at the world. I don't meant to attack you; just my opinion.   Crowd sourcing: Eh don't like the idea, don't really have anything to offer but a punch card for a certain number of free drinks of your choice, free meals of your choice, free events and dates, general shit like that.  I don't think this is the path you should go down.  Guerilla marketing: People get ideas when they think other people hate something or love something. Doing aggressive marketing AGAINST competition and corporations will draw people who hate the fact that they have to get a shit cup and bring them to me when they look up my site. I've got a few ideas on how to make this work.  Campaigning against people -- not my style. Anyway, maybe it will work for you. You will need to start early to avoid burning your capital upon opening.   High end ads: Again, just bringing in attention to business. Start with something amazing that doesn't look like someone's first ad for their business like someone's put some real effort into creating the poster is just a means of impressing people who have taste. I've got this stuff pretty much figured out. The issues I'm concerned about are figuring out how to get my physical business started.  Having style is definitely good. But, it depends on your target market. I worry about a smaller city/town and hearing things like ""impressing people who have taste""."

startups,3b3rge,cat_trick,4,Thu Jun 25 18:54:25 2015 UTC,This place in Indiana has sheds for every person. And they're on locking casters so they can wheel them over to another person's shed if they're working on a project long-term together. The interiors seem pretty customized for each person.

startups,3b3rge,fiveguy,2,Fri Jun 26 03:18:47 2015 UTC,"Do you mean put the shed inside the building or is this a garden office?  Though it doesn't really make much difference, the answer would be no.  Primarily because these sheds aren't insulated, aren't meant to be insulated and don't have windows.  If they are outside, they would be unbearable for most months of the year.  If its inside, then you can't close the door because you would loose all natural light and have no air circulation.  --Edit--  Honestly, putting up 3 walls with a door isn't expensive.  If there is a drop ceiling you can use a pressure wall that can be easily demolished post lease.  http://homeguides.sfgate.com/secure-wall-suspended-ceiling-32832.html has information on how to do it.  If you can do the work your self and keep the office to a reasonable size, 8'x8' then you can probably build it for less than $500."

The biggest advice I can give you is to manage expectations - Adwords is a bit of a beast and takes quite a bit of time and effort and tinkering to figure out. Until you get to a comfortable spot with it, you're gonna be wasting a bit of dough. That's just the nature of the platform. Which means $100 isn't going to take you far, and probably won't give you enough results to really teach you anything about market testing. But, a few initial tips:  1) Spend 90% of your time on keyword research. This is the foundation AND design schematics for your house. The more targeted you can get on those, the better your campaigns will be.    2) Long-tail keywords are best right now. Cheaper for you. Classic example of someone buying shoes. You can bid on ""new nikes"" or you can bid on ""where do i buy cheap jordan 8s in wichita, kansas"".  3) Google's quality score is kind of everything re: Adwords. Make sure your ad copy matches your URL which matches your landing page. A score above 7 is what you want.  4) Read a few Adwords 101 posts. There are some basic tips that will help you reduce $$$ waste."
startups,3b3zxp,MostProphetable,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:56:35 2015 UTC,"I agree that $100 probably isn't going to give you much feedback, but make the most of what you have.  Start with a handful of ad groups sorted into logical groups.  For instance if you sold 3 types of insurance - life, health and disability - you might had 3 ad groups that match.  Once you have your ad groups setup ad some exact match keyword phrases.  If you need help coming up with options just use the auto suggest feature of google's own search engine. Set a reasonable max bid, and just watch the account for a day or two.  Make adjustments and add keywords.  What you don't want to do on a limited budget is start off with a bunch of broad match keyword phrases that'll have people landing on your site for stuff you don't sell.  Using the insurance analogy above if you had a broad match keyword for ""life insurance"", Google might show you ad to someone who typed in ""home insurance"" or something to that effect.  Also install something like HotJar on your site to watch visitors moving thru your site.  Install remarketing tags (Google, Facebook, PerfectAudience/AdRoll) so you can target these initial visitors cheaply later on as you iterate on your project."

startups,3b1gwl,Robby_Rob,7,Thu Jun 25 16:04:38 2015 UTC,"Stop trying to be better. Be worse.  We should stop worrying all the time about being better. Coming up with better is actually easy. All of us look at the world and imagine how it could be better. There's an endless supply of ideas for better. But most of those ideas don't ship. And of those that do, most don't get any attention and no one cares. Better things still go out of business most of the time.   Use the energy you'd spend trying to out-better everyone to figure out how to actually make a product worse than the competition. What things could you take away. What could you remove, or do in such a way that it gives you more resources and time to apply to other places. Does your competitor have 1 hour customer support time; could you get by with 48 hours; or no support at all? Does your competitor have a team of slick designers with fancy animations and polish on everything; could you get by with a black and white website with nothing but text?   Everything you find that you could make a little worse than your competition gives you time, energy and focus you can apply to other things. And apply that focus to making something different. Find things your competitor hasn't yet and probably won't consider doing.  This isn't easy, but with all the time and energy you gained from moving your focus away from out-bettering everyone, this gets easier.   Examples from my life: I've made Draft (http://draftin.com), a popular word processor. But if I worried about out-bettering Google Docs and Word I'd still be spending years failing to build what they've built with hundreds and thousands of engineers. So I didn't worry about being better. I couldn't do formatting better, or charts, or inline images, or any of the hundreds of tools they have. So I used that time to focus on different.   They don't have humans editors a button away. I added an Ask a Pro button which sends your doc to humans for help. Google Docs also doesn't let you accept or reject individual changes, I could add that. It wasn't easy, but I had a lot of extra time and energy to put into that single task, since I didn't worry about out-bettering everything else.   Even marketing site design. I knew I couldn't out better their designs and logos and polish. So why try. I kept it all text. Even skipped worrying about a logo. Done. More time to work on different.   And of course this doesn't mean I made the next Google Docs or Word. Draft will never be that big. But it's big enough, and makes decent money to make it all worth it.  Now I'm CEO of Highrise (http://highrisehq.com), and I see the same thing at play. When Highrise first came out in 2006, 37signals/Basecamp just focused on different. They couldn't out-better Salesforce's features, a public company with many more resources at their disposal. So they removed almost everything to focus on just a few things. And it paid off.   Now, since Highrise came out, there's a ton of new competition. Some great companies also doing CRM well in their own ways. Of course, there's this itch to look at the competition and out-better them. We don't have this. We don't have that. Should we add our competitors XYZ and make it better? The answer is again: probably not. Let those things be worse. We can use the extra time to keep coming up with different.   For some more rigorous thought on this, I highly recommend a read of Blue Ocean Strategy (http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Expanded-Uncontested/dp/1625274491/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435257353&sr=8-1&keywords=blue+ocean+strategy). It's full of great exercises - like actually listing out what your industry is doing, and trying to come up with what you are going to do worse than them.   You should easily be able to rattle off how much worse you are than your competition, not how much better. If it's hard for you to settle on what you're going to do worse, than your time is going to be far too unfocused. You won't have the energy to apply on the things that matter."
startups,3b1gwl,n8dog,2,Thu Jun 25 18:38:08 2015 UTC,"Good point. The whole idea of being better stems from the idea that it is possible to quantify what a successful product will be, because customers decisions are assumed to be made on understandable and quantifiable criteria all the time. That's reassuring, but definitely a fallacy. What matters is that people use your stuff, not that your stuff is better per se, because it doesn't mean anything."
startups,3b1gwl,Ericooooo,7,Fri Jun 26 02:29:04 2015 UTC,"The examples given are all huge sites that cater to the entire world.  All these sites started much smaller, so you would need to do the same.  Start with a niche site that caters towards a particular geography or topic first. It's easier to seed content and find users then.   Get close to your users. If they don't come back to the site, find out why so you can keep improving.  Once that's successful, then expand to other areas until you eventually take over the world.   If you can't master that one niche, then that's probably a good sign that your idea needs more work."
startups,3b1gwl,HarveyHound,3,Thu Jun 25 07:47:15 2015 UTC,I agree and I struggle with this as well. I think what's better is to pick a sub-sector of that idea that you care about most and cut scope. Let's take Craiglist for an example. You can buy anything on Craiglist and catering to the needs of the whole world probably isn't the best play but picking a specific vertical and nailing it can be incredibly profitable.

For example, when someone says I'm creating a Facebook but better, everyone will laugh, and rightly so.  But if you want to come up with new business-software, you'll have far less obstacles. Business software needs to be in line with company culture, policies and growth - in this case, there's always room for something different. Take customer service software for example. Some companies just offer support via email, some just chat and email. There's a trend in some industries to remove the phone altogether from their support."

I don't think it needs to be 30% better - it just needs to be 30% cooler and fresher. The younger generation dictates a lot of what products succeed and they always want what's new and cool. No matter how cool something is initially it always fades out for something new before too long.  Take Tinder for example. It was the coolest thing around last year. Now Hinge and Bumble were just a bit different/better and have taken the spotlight. Although this evidence is ver anecdotal, every person I talk to in the West LA (Santa Monica, Venice, etc.) are totally over Tinder and haven't opened it months.   The more social the product is, the more this is the case. If were talking enterprise software than I believe this is also true, but on a lot longer cycle (would rise and fall in 3-5 years instead of 6 months-1 year.)"

If you are the marketing manager you are not going to tell the programmer much about their daily task, you're probably just going to distract them.

startups,3ay4g6,worldalpha_com,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:27:51 2015 UTC,I agree. This is what prevents a lot of people from sharing their idea--the thought that they'll get their Facebook-sized idea stolen. Most ideas aren't great or aren't something the market wants/needs. I've worked on multiple ideas and wasted a lot of time on market research.

We have ""minimize risk!"", ""MVP and don't build your full product right away!"", etc. beat into our heads.  Why not apply that advice to your startup idea.  Work on it part-time while maintaining your full time job to determine if you have a viable startup.  If you do, quit and THEN do it full time."
startups,3ay4g6,cycloneworld,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:01:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, but many of us are also passionate / insane enough to work 35-40 hours at our full time job, and another 20-30 on our startup. I don't think the intention was to say ""you need to devote 60 hours a week to the startup"" ... Simply that if you're an entrepreneur, it doesn't matter whether you are in the shower, cooking, or even at your regular job, your startup will always be on your mind. If you think about it once a week, it's probably closer to dreaming than realizing.  At least, that's the way it makes sense to me."

Yet we are always thinking about it throughout the day and kicking stuff around via email and Evernote. So I guess I agree with both of you in the sense that it starts part-time as an addition to the full time job, then slowly transitions over to full time once enough funds are generated to pay yourself to work only on the startup. I think #48 just sounds good to say on paper but you have to make a living to pay your bills, or what kind of entrepreneur would you be? An irresponsible one."

startups,3ay4g6,Jayd3e,4,Wed Jun 24 17:25:02 2015 UTC,"I like your list and there is some good wisdom in here that every founder/person needs to learn at some point.  I really respect that you compiled all of this thought.  I have to address one thing here though that gets regurgitated everywhere that I'm absolutely tired of hearing.   Ideas are worth sh*t. Execution is key.   Ideas are not shit!  Ideas are the start of everything.  A good idea that tackles a big problem can lead you on a 5 year roller coaster that results in the problem getting fixed and a successful/perpetual company to thank.  A bad idea can lead you on a 5 year roller coaster of making a product that no one wants and you could not know with 100% certainty until late.  My point is that the idea is the beginning of both of these tracks, and it's very important to have a very clear, focused, and well defined idea.  At best the idea can lead you down a very straight path, and at worst it can lead you down a zig zag of a path that results in ruin or wasted time.  I have lead a startup for the past 3 years, and the problem we're solving has remained the same from the start, but the idea has changed multiple times.  It would have been 100% times easier if we had arrived at the right idea from the start and made more of the assumptions we've made now.  So my point is the closer you can get initially on the right idea, the better.  I really feel like this whole trendy ""Ideas are sh**"" catch phrase came about to combat a lot of people who would walk around having all of these ideas and never acting on them.  I get it, ideas have no value by themselves until they are acted on.  But they start all of the action.  Execution IS important.  But you can't have good execution without a good idea, so they are both important.  Spend some time carefully crafting what you're going after, before executing on it.  It will save you time and headache down the road, and will cut out a lot of the noise that you're likely to encounter along the way."

startups,3ay4g6,mr-aaron-gray,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:06:08 2015 UTC,"If the person is one of the original bakers, which is usually the case when deciding on how to divvy up the pie, then they can help write the operating agreement/bylaws in a way that says that one person or a group of managers is in charge of managing the company. This way, they can take a smaller piece of the pie, maintain some control, and allow for investors and stakeholders to take portions of the pie so they can build a larger pie. That smaller piece of a larger pie is usually going to be worth more than the larger piece of the smaller; hence why someone would go that route."

Also, what kind of company is this, your rights differ slighly dependin if its an LLC, C-corp, S-corp, Partnership.  You most likely have the rights to ask for the financial statements.

You do have some legal recourse if they heavily inflate their salaries out of the norm.   They can protect themselves on their end too though.  I was just on the opposite side of this.  I fired a owner who was not showing up to work.  His lawyer said that I should suspend my salary and only do distributions. (He thought his termination was illegal)  I went and got an appraiser to set my salary to the norm of a ceo in our area.  After that we were going to build in performance bonuses.  In the end we ended up buying him out.  My point is there's nothing much you can do.

If you want to have a say regarding decisions like dividend pay outs then you probably need be on the board. If you are a director, bring it up at the next meeting. It seems like that isn't the direction they are leaning though.  If you aren't on the board you are at their mercy.

Think who is your target.  Are you wanting to go after actual trading firms or are you wanting to go after individuals?  Individuals is a huge opportunity in my mind as long as you have a product that is easily understandable.  Course if you are going after individuals that have been in it for some time it doesn't matter as long as it works period.  If you are wanting to go after individuals I have some ideas to help you get off the ground so you do not have to worry initially about needing outside investing.  The key is to be able to connect with individuals on their level.  Again I'd like to help you out as much as I can.  Not looking at taking any share of your company just wanted to lend another set of eyes and some help.
startups,3b23gb,mikkom,2,Thu Jun 25 17:31:16 2015 UTC,"Your first stop should be trading it with your own money and establishing an auditable track record with your broker.  Then you can start on sites like covestor and collective2 where people can throw money into your system.  You'll need 6-18 months of returns before people start getting interested.  Trading is a tough business.  You aren't the first guy to run an ML system.  Most people these days have had at least some experience with an algo system and understand that it will need to be tested out of sample to be relevant.  Alternatively, there are some small prop desks that will take you on and leverage your account.  You will still have all the PnL risk.  Maverick Trading comes to mind.  There are a few others, but prop has been destroyed over the last few years."

Do you think it would be possible to get seed investment (from investors in exchange for equity, not as clients) that I could use to grow a bit before this 6-18 month period, or are investors not going to touch me until then?"
startups,3b23gb,Startup_Startup,2,Thu Jun 25 16:46:08 2015 UTC,"You need to test your system with real money. There are risks there that will only be realized after you are trading with real money. Backtesting a fx system is very hard as prices are not centralized ie, there is no real ""history"" of prices as there would be with for example stocks or futures also depending on how much you know about machine learning it's very easy to overfit.  You should also be very careful when selecting your broker. As you probably know, FX is not centralized nor usually regulated so the execution and account risks are real."
startups,3b0kcn,Shawnmattcraw,2,Thu Jun 25 00:19:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as a amateur entrepreneur it is best you find two people who are local to your city, town, or village, because startups require physical meet ups more than most people expect and it strengthens the relationship between you and your co-founders. Also, if you are worried about your lack of skill in Telecom programming, then hire/find people who are more skilled than you and then focus your skills towards being a leader - a good leadership is more important to the survival of a business than anything else, fact."

Find websites of companies/businesses that are shitty or mediocre...then code them and make them better.  Heck, you then can try to sell it to them.

If you get some good feedback then you can build a simple MVP, set up some branding and a Twitter account, and then pour your effort into building a user base. You can iterate from there.

The pros:    Its very modern with a simple and clean look  It would look great as an app icon/favicon Its 90% better than most logos people to ask me to critique   The cons:    Im not in love with the color scheme.  The black orange and white doesnt complient your current landing page. Im not entirely sure what your logo is communicating.  I can see the p and maybe understand that it has to do with cameras but the pool aspect doesn't come across.  I might experiment with incorporating the color blue. It immediately reminds of me the beats by dre logo   Like I said, I think it looks better than most logos I get asked to critique, I just think it could use a little tweaking."

I will seriously consider the advice you gave.   the logo is suppose to look like FP (FocalPool)  and a camera lens. And the orange color is too much embedded within our product right now.  If you look at the logo on its own and not in the context of the landing page,  do you think the color scheme still has a problem?  Thanks again"

I see what you were going for now that you've explained it but I don't think the F translates well.  I think you could work on that by shifting the line to a more straighter angle then its at right now.  It doesnt have to be completely straight.  If the orange is embedded within the product, I would still experiment with different blues instead of white, just because I still dont think the pool aspect comes across very well.  Maybe remove the black border? I would just play around with it until it somehow conveyed pool a bit better."

startups,3b0ghv,Jbasket,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:20:38 2015 UTC,"Glad to help.  First things first, I would change that blue border around your website.  If your going to leave it blank try white.  It will look more professional, whereas the green on solid blue looks really template-y.  Second, you need a logo.  Right now all you have is text.  AKA you have no visual identity which isn't going to translate into any brand recognition. There is nothing that strikes out immediately at you when you first land on the page.  It would be nice to see a professional graphic logo at the top to help contrast all the text and again to look more professional.  The two package offers on the side throw off the remaining page.  As I scroll down, all the text isn't centred and there's all this space to the right.  I would recommend creating a separate page for your packages and adding a see packages now button. The fonts and icons you use on the site work well so I wouldn't change those. Aside from that I think your site just needs a little face lift and it would be looking great"

startups,3b0u5e,ChornWork2,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:49:53 2015 UTC,"Most likely B2B. I've seen interest in white-labeling for insurance companies to offer as a feature to their users. We would also like to build a dashboard for doctors that would let them monitor their patients, and could charge hospitals for that access. I know there are plenty of other avenues too, but this is not really my realm of expertise.  Another option is to build up a big base of users and data, which could attract an outright sale of the company.  I am ideologically against charging the users to access the app (and I don't think B2C would be the right way to make money here anyway) or advertising to them."
startups,3b0u5e,ChornWork2,2,Thu Jun 25 13:29:35 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting.  Not my area of expertise, but obviously lots of attention being paid to opportunities around healthcare.  A multi-prong approach has some appeal if you can fund a light version available to the public, while building out a more robust solution that you can offer on the enterprise side.  Navigating the restrictions/requirements of patient data has to be a huge priority if you are going the B2B side.  Integrating directly with healthcare providers seems like a potential 'bridge too far' in that respect, but obviously not my area of expertise.  Presumably information self-submitted by the user is different from integrating with third party health providers.  Have you looked in the type of services that niche managed care companies provide and how they are delivering those services?  From what I have seen they are more advocacy services for navigating the process versus actual treatment, but I imagine there probably is more to it than that.  Wonder if there is a sweet-spot application that can be your entry point.  For example, offer a lifestyle focused tool as the entry point for enterprise b/c it may not be a huge regulatory burden, while developing your expertise on medical treatment management via B2C for niche chronic illnesses.  By lifestyle, i mean tools for tracking exercise, diet, sleep, etc, as part of a healthy lifestyle support pitch that enterprise can flag wave about.

You have EAPs (employee assistance programs), which provide services to employees of their clients.  They help people manage through certain types of problems, such as counseling services for things like healthcare, substance abuse or personal crises.  I think that space is now broadening.  For example, Health Advocate is a company I looked at not too long ago (was recently acquired).  It helps employees of clients to navigate healthcare issues (eg., selecting providers, managing insurance process), but also offering some wellness and chronic care services.  Frankly I don't know the scope, but sounds up your alley."

I know these people personally (all of them upwardly mobile professionals from different industries interested in making something extra on the side) so am able to get 90-95% of what I want without having to micromanage. The Indians who speak/write English very well usually have a childhood influenced by Hollywood, English music and literature. You probably won't find these people offering their services through writing companies.   So, IMHO, outsourcing your writing to a firm/company in India might not work out very well.

Something like:  ""Joe Schmoe, I'd like 5 minutes of your time to talk about how my Shed Painting service can help XYZ Corp do [something core to XYZ Corp's goals]""  Then, in the body of the email get to the point FAST.  Your email needs to get to the point immediately without a bunch of jargon, marketing speak, or unsubstantiated claims.    If your email is any longer than your Reddit post above, then it is too long.  Your first email doesn't need to sell your service. It needs to sell them on the idea that talking about your service in more depth will be useful."

I would get an email tracker (yesware, 100 events/month is free) and see what your open / response rates are.   That being said, I would significantly shorten your email pitch. A lawyer is probably very busy, so you don't want to waste their time with platitudes.  Instead, focus on the benefits for them and what you are helping them do.   I would try something simple, like this:    Subject: ""Legal Translations (to help grow your law firm)""  Hi [First Name],  I'm emailing you from ______ to offer our help growing your business through our legal translation services.   For example, we have helped firms like xxx, yyy, and zzz grow their businesses by [some monetary value or percentage, or growth statistic].   Our rates are _______, and we work 24/7, holidays and weekends included. Our work is done in several languages, always high quality, and always in a timely manner.  Do you have something you need translated? We can start right away.   If you need more info just let me know and I can answer any questions you might have or set up a call at your convenience.    Send out this email, track opens/responses, and create a funnel.  You can also add links in the email and track if people are clicking on them. For example, you could have a link on ""several languages"" that goes to a page that has a list of the languages you work in, or ""grow their business"" with a link to a short white paper on the kind of growth they can expect.  If someone opens your email several times, or clicks on the links, take that as interest and follow up with a second email, asking if they are using a legal translation service and maybe including a whitepaper on how legal translations can help them grow their business.   I think that's a good starting point -- though personally my emails are generally much shorter.. I don't have the expertise in your field to determine a better starting point.. For example, is it likely the companies you are targeting are already using a translation service? If so, it doesn't make sense to tell them the benefits."

startups,3axu3v,tinkerer13,2,Wed Jun 24 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"In business terms, I think ""viable"" means ""viable in the market"".  ""Delightfulness"" is a metric or strategy to optimize marketing.  For an established (non-startup) business, some customers may value ""delight"" more than others.

startups,3axu3v,kaiserk13,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:22:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I'm glad you mentioned this.  It seems like an important concept in the lean startup book.  It's true to the core theory, to speed up the design cycles, even if it seems a bit counter-intuitive at first.   Design is a chicken-and-egg paradox.  How do you know what product to build if you don't know what the market wants?  How can you know what the market wants without having built the product?  The MVP theory says to address this by speeding up the design cycles.    ""Simulation"" allows you to virtually-build the product, test the market, and refine the product, all on a much faster cycle.    There is a faster time-to market to sell a ""service"" than a ""good"".  Even if the product experience must be so customized it is absurdly over-the-top, and is way too expensive to ever be a viable product, you're testing a lot of product ideas very quickly, and collecting very valuable marketing data.  I suppose it's valuable data because: 1) you acquired it early on, 2) it's real-world / realistic, and reasonably accurate, at least as much as it can be for being early-on, and thus it's high quality data.  3) You also would tend to find the so called ""unknown unknowns"" earlier on.   4) you've collected a good quantity of data.    A good strategy for a lean startups might be to find and partner with a pre-existing service-oriented business, (so that the startup doesn't have to re-create it from scratch), and then design ""goods"" (aka ""products"") having something to do with that business/sector.  You'd be using the marketing capital of the service-business to inform the product design."

The most important thing is to keep things organized such that someone else could take over fairly easily, and don't make yourself central to the business. You also need to set up ways that the company can grow, even if you won't necessarily be there to grow it - for example, don't sign long-term contracts for low rates, or sign noncompetes, if that could potentially interfere with growth in the future, even if you think you won't be around at that point or that the company will never grow that big."

If you're starting a typical business (aka 95% of businesses) and it's bootstrapped, etc., then you'll need to do 2 things:   Once it's successful and bringing in cashflow, systemize yourself out of a job. You want it to run even if you're not there. Sell it. Interestingly, doing #1 will make selling it a LOT easier, and increase the value of the business. In order to sell buyers have to know who you are, so it's good to start meeting people ~1 year in advance. Don't tell them you're looking to sell, just meet with the intent to talk shop, etc.   On #1 you have 100% control over, whereas #2 you can of course influence, but ultimately it's up to a buyer to decide.  The genius of #1 is that it gets you ""off the hook"" of running the business, while also increasing the chance you can sell and wash your hands for good."

startups,3ay9rp,TheBenjamin8,7,Wed Jun 24 13:50:45 2015 UTC,Why are you linking to the main PH page to avoid the voting ring detector?
startups,3ay9rp,minimaxir,4,Wed Jun 24 14:48:48 2015 UTC,Sounds like you answered your own question there
startups,3ay9rp,wtsktte,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:20:48 2015 UTC,Is it considered bad to promote one's own PH page?
startups,3ay9rp,halfercode,2,Wed Jun 24 15:26:33 2015 UTC,"It's bad to link to your page since it encourages vote begging. But since Product Hunt doesn't actually punish people who do it, everyone does it. Which is why PH is terrible. (Reddit would probably shadowban you for doing the same things people do with a PH page)  Apparently, PH does have a voting ring detector to discount votes directly to the page from non-PH referrers (I honestly don't believe it). Linking to the home page to sidestep this is very very very bad."
startups,3ay9rp,minimaxir,2,Wed Jun 24 15:45:17 2015 UTC,"It's probably difficult to police. Here in /r/startups we've recently had requests to take part in promotional Twitter memes, requests for votes to pitch to Richard Branson, and votes for an entrant in an American bank's start-up contest.  I don't vote in these things, since I think votes should be organically obtained by people who've really experienced the product. But booting someone off the platform (any of the above) seems rather harsh. And I don't agree each of the platforms are entirely without value because people have been going vote-begging (it's annoying, but I wouldn't make someone unemployed over it)."
startups,3ay9rp,halfercode,2,Wed Jun 24 16:52:05 2015 UTC,why shouldn't I?  Posted here to share the love... not solicit upvotes.
startups,3ay9rp,minimaxir,2,Wed Jun 24 15:33:11 2015 UTC,Then why did you explicitly link to the PH homepage instead of the product page?
startups,3ay9rp,7amWDG,3,Wed Jun 24 15:45:38 2015 UTC,because i dont want to hurt ourselves either.  who the f really knows what their algo is.
startups,3ay9rp,thegraduate,3,Wed Jun 24 17:26:11 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the publicity, your company is also one of his investments so you've got that going for ya ;)  Looks like lots of fun ahead for you :D"
startups,3ay9rp,thegraduate,10,Wed Jun 24 14:02:17 2015 UTC,"Well that's slightly misleading on his part, isn't it? :)"
startups,3ay9rp,TheThunderbird,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:41:57 2015 UTC,why is that misleading?

startups,3avfc9,PvtUnternehmer,8,Tue Jun 23 20:58:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It took me a bit to realize that the site itself could be an MVP., but now we're getting everything on track.  I've added a lot more content and working on throwing together the finishing touches right now!"
startups,3avfc9,PvtUnternehmer,7,Tue Jun 23 21:06:51 2015 UTC,"Man! That's so fucking great to hear! Let me know when you guys're done, I'll check it out again for you."
startups,3avfc9,crescentcityclouds,5,Tue Jun 23 21:08:37 2015 UTC,"PSA: If you don't have an MVP or a landing page yet, still read through these threads. There's a lot to be learned from others here. :)"
startups,3avfc9,crescentcityclouds,4,Tue Jun 23 21:19:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for donating your time! I run a small e-liquid manufacturing company. Would love to get some feedback from our retail site if you get a chance.  Crescent City Clouds
startups,3avfc9,crescentcityclouds,5,Tue Jun 23 21:54:33 2015 UTC,"Sure thing buddy!  First things first, the adult verification page.  Why did my little ""spend $50 and get free shipping"" banner disappear once I said I was 18 and clicked enter?! (a lot of people are going to rush through things and click to get to the site and miss that, and free shipping is always a great incentive!)  And then there were banners!  Your banner with ""Sunday Funday"" and a chance of my order being doubled, does that mean you randomly double orders? What's going on there? I click on it and I'm just taken to a long page of e-liquids but no information on if this is a promotion or if you're just fucking with me. That can be a barrier right there.  And product pictures  These product pictures are a little blurry (that happens with jpg). Maybe they were meant to be smaller, I don't know, but with this kind of thing can wreck your ecommerce business!   You'll want to have pictures that people can click on and enlarge; I should be able to read all the words on your label to know exactly what I'm getting.  And products, too!  Your product descriptions are okay, but with strong ""cloud""/NOLA branding I'm expecting something really special and unique. Also, watch out for misspellings, it can screw with customer trust like nobody's business I know it sounds nitpicky, but after years of working for little shops it really is the little things that convert or chase the customer away.  Now back to your front page. I'm looking at your text here, I'm guessing it's for all that lovely SEO benefit... but if you're selling ""artisanal"" e-liquids, you don't have to go heavy handed with the ""hand crafted"" ""all day vaping pleasure"" ""Each flavor has at least four different flavoring agents in them to create complexity"" talk. I mean, I've sold $100 bottles of French olive oil that wasn't sold that hard ;) You do something, you do it well, you don't have to oversell your product, just sell it buddy!  No FAQ page, no contact page (that little mail icon is cute but some people might just think it's more social media). That can be a problem.  Finally:   SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER  Subscribe to our newsletter and always be the first to hear about what is happening.   If someone came up to you at a tradeshow and asked you why they should sign up for your newsletter would you say that? Hell no. You'd tell them that signing up to your newsletter meant they learned about new flavors and products before anyone else, special promotions, etc. That's the kind of stuff that gets people into signing up for your newsletter! Get 'em excited OP!"
startups,3avfc9,crescentcityclouds,2,Tue Jun 23 23:37:38 2015 UTC,You rock. I will work on these things and pass them forward to my team. Thanks for your time!!!! Mucho appreciated.

startups,3avfc9,korkboard,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:52:33 2015 UTC,Vaporium? Also what should the product pic format be? Png?
startups,3avfc9,korkboard,3,Tue Jun 23 23:53:55 2015 UTC,"PNGs are great too, you can keep your tiny jpg if you like so you don't have to go back through and redo all of your photos. You just always want to offer high quality images of the product for the people that want to compare what they bought with what they got or finicky people that just want to see what they're about to buy."
startups,3avfc9,korkboard,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:57:02 2015 UTC,"We are also about to implement a blog which should clear some of these issues. Ie the Sunday fun day post, and throw me something Thursday."
startups,3avfc9,PvtUnternehmer,3,Tue Jun 23 23:51:54 2015 UTC,Well make sure you link your banners to those blogs so people know what's up. The last thing you want is to make people hunt for information when they should be adding stuff to their orders and checking out ^ ^
startups,3avfc9,korkboard,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:54:08 2015 UTC,You know it!!!!!!!!! Thanks again.
startups,3avfc9,Sythic_,3,Wed Jun 24 00:12:05 2015 UTC,"We're in the process of reworking our site from our current landing page to be a bit more fleshed out, would appreciate the feedback!"
startups,3avfc9,korkboard,6,Tue Jun 23 21:07:05 2015 UTC,"Hey hey!  Block #1  I love your little FOMO tag, but I had to mouse over it to find out wtf FOMO is. If I'm on mobile I might not have that instinct to ""mouse"" over the word like I would on a desktop (which is kind of bad if I'm looking at a mobile app!) ""Fight the FOMO"" would be an awesome call to action button later on the page, haha.  You've got a scroll-stopper top block; you'll want to use a visual element like an arrow to let people know that there's more content down below.  Block #2   ""find events near you. make new friends.""   Simple and to the point!   But here you state the problem in a lengthy bit of text and then present yourself as the solution, you might want to flip this around a little. Korkboard makes communicating on campus easy, build on that here.  Block #3, #4, #5  Do these really need to be separate blocks? Are you hogging valuable screen time where you could have a benefit block (which these three easily are, though it's kind of a mixed features/bennies bag), a ""how it works"" block and an FAQ block? Could be!  Block #6  Sign up block.   Now this could be way more exciting here OP! You're about to revolutionize how people connect on campus... but you're not putting that energy into this form down here. It's just boring and sad.    Give us your contact info and we'll be in touch soon!   Not really actionable, right? What's the benefit of signing up? Do I really want to you to get in touch with me, or do I want to download the app? Maybe get notified when it's live?! Make it more exciting, give me a reason to pony up my information and click that button.  Speaking of the button (/r/thebutton), ""SUBMIT"" isn't really exciting. I submit an application, I submit that my grades aren't the best during Freshman year... But really! ""Get notified"", ""Fight the FOMO"", ""I'm Interested"" are just a couple other ways you could put this. You've gotta get 'em excited OP to click the button, you can do it!"
startups,3avfc9,PvtUnternehmer,3,Tue Jun 23 21:29:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the feedback! We'll definitely take this all in as we're working to make the site more thorough and I'll be sure to follow up with what we have when we're finished with the revamp!"
startups,3avfc9,korkboard,3,Tue Jun 23 21:40:38 2015 UTC,"Yay! Good luck, it looks like a sweet app!"
startups,3avfc9,_nigelburke_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:21:06 2015 UTC,Hey /u/terpin! Just got done with our site revamp and was wondering if you'd be willing to take a look at it. Tried to take into account all your feedback in reworking much of the copy.  http://korkapp.com
startups,3avfc9,charitypush,3,Fri Jun 26 01:40:35 2015 UTC,"Hey! Quick question.  I love the idea behind your app, definitely something I would've liked to use in school.  Are you really already registered as an LLC? If so, how did you validate your idea that allowed you to get that far?  Thanks!"
startups,3avfc9,charitypush,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:42:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  Yup, we filed our LLC back in February actually, though it looks like we eventually are going to have to pull the ol' Delaware reincorporation. At least we didn't file as a Florida LLC...  Anyway, our validation thus far has been through first user interviews and then a bit more of an empirical mini-study where we allowed potential users to play with a static prototype of the app and then had them fill out a short survey afterwards.  This gave us enough validation to go through with finishing up our MVP, which we'll be launching in August when University starts back up."
startups,3avfc9,Revolar,2,Tue Jun 23 21:48:25 2015 UTC,Can you ELI5 why a Florida LLC is bad? I was planning on getting one for general projects at some point and since I'm in Florida figured it'd be less hassle than dealing with mail forwarding services and stuff in Delaware. Is it just tax stuff?
startups,3avfc9,Revolar,2,Tue Jun 23 21:54:57 2015 UTC,"Haha I was just making a stupid Facebook joke, I don't actually know what specifically is bad about Florida LLCs. My understanding though is that the majority of Angel Investors, VC firms will want you to reincorporate in Delaware before they do a deal anyway for tax/legal reasons. I'm not an attorney nor a CPA though so I couldn't do a ELI5 justice."
startups,3avfc9,tomt0m,2,Tue Jun 23 22:14:36 2015 UTC,Can I send you a pm? I'm really interested in your process. :)
startups,3avfc9,tomt0m,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:05:46 2015 UTC,Sure thing!
startups,3avfc9,scttrvl,3,Wed Jun 24 01:06:09 2015 UTC,"Hi terpin, have been reading your feedback for a while and think you have your great insights (although the delivery can be a little brutal).  Would love to hear your thoughts on www.rusdens.com  Thanks for your time"
startups,3avfc9,scttrvl,5,Tue Jun 23 22:58:57 2015 UTC,"But it's like /r/ThePopcornStand/ but for business... and it comes from a place of love :) Plus if I talked all nice about all the things wrong with a page who would listen to me? Nobody! And I don't blame 'em!  Block #1  From your logo/tag line I'm asking myself, are they targeting HR people who need help onboarding new employees or are they targeting new hires that need help getting acclimated to their new position? It's just not all that clear here, and that's a bad thing.   Then I see this:   We're here to help you make sure your new job is a success.  Sign up today for your free six week coaching program   If you've seen my feedback, you know how I feel about the words ""sign up"". Why not ""Create your account and get started in seconds"" or something more actionable? People come to your website to have you tell them what to do - so tell 'em what to do. Just don't tell 'em to sign up.   Also OP, why is this disastrously small?   Free, no obligation program. Get started today in less than 60 seconds   Look at how tiny this thing is! So tiny!  If I'm on a mobile device, I may not know there's more content here other than this big 'ol prop block. You might want to have some kind of visual indicator to help people move down the page and be convinced to sign up.  Block #2   Congratulations on your new job,   Why is there a comma there? A comma is a thoughtful pause. We don't need a thoughtful pause here, we need them to keep moving so we can sell them something.   You are no doubt experiencing a mix of emotions right now; excitement, trepidation, worry. One thing for sure is that over the coming weeks and months you will be faced with a whole number of challenges; how to identify the key skills and abilities you will need to perform in your new role? who do you need to establishing successful personal relationships with? and what are your new employer's goals and values?    Now, if I was a person on the phone with you interested in coaching, would you say this to me? No, you'd just talk to me in a friendly, natural and even tone. You probably wouldn't talk about ""trepidations"" or say ""whilst"" in conversations with clients, so you'll want to avoid weird stuff like that when writing about your services on your site.  You're using ""Let's"" a lot in your CTA buttons here on the page. Never end a CTA with a period, because that's a statement, not an invitation. Again, try to find something more actionable like ""Get your one-on-one session"" or something, demonstrate a benefit and give them a reason to click the button :)  Block #3  You've specially developed training for virtually every professional role? Some visitors might be a little incredulous.  Block #4  Check this picture Your explainer video is super small here. I can't fast forward it and the text is so tiny people may not be able to read it. I got a good laugh out of unchecking the box to show that I wasn't interested in the offer and the form disappears. That might be a bit of a problem though if someone goes to instinctually check the box and ends up losing their form.  Block #5  This is your benefits block, but it's more of a feature block. People don't want to know what they'll learn, they want to know what rusdens does for them. BTW, what does rusdens even mean? It's never explained and I'm wondering if it's the name of a person.  Try phrasing ""What you will learn"" as a question or as a awesome benefit that rusdens provides. Something like ""After 6 weeks of one-on-one coaching you'll know..."" or something like that. I can learn personal development, business models and networking anywhere else. What does Rusdens do differently?  Block #6  ""Get Started Today""  Not bad OP, but you need to bait the hook here. It's the final countdown, the last chance you have to get them to convert to your service (the data collection here is a little weird, I can sign up now or I can sign up to maybe sign up later? Has that landed you a lot of leads? If you can't sell free coaching for six weeks, it's a problem)  I like how you borrow social proof from the Harvard Business Review, NBC and Forbes. The execution here could be a bit better though - heck, if you've worked with people who have worked at certain companies you can work that into your social proof box!  You're missing a contact page, an FAQ page, a Privacy Policy page, an ""About Us"" page (you need to establish yourselves as authorities and that's a good way to start). You can link to all that in the bottom and up top if you like, but you're going to need that stuff here so people who want to find out more about what Rusdens does can."
startups,3avfc9,psysick1,3,Wed Jun 24 00:12:57 2015 UTC,"I'd love your feedback on the landing page for my startup, CharityPush. It's mainly meant for a mobile audience and I'm trying to get people to scroll to the apps section and click to download any of the apps.   I am at your mercy."
startups,3avfc9,theGodstopper,6,Tue Jun 23 23:09:58 2015 UTC,"Nonprofits are some of the toughest to sell, so don't feel too bad.  Problem #1  How do I know that by completing this action something positive will happen (other than you getting some kind of affiliate kickback for making me download a game)? You don't link to Trees for the Future, I found their website via Google and they don't mention you as a partner on their website. This is a major, major problem. How does a visitor verify your story of one download/installation plants three trees?  Problem #2  Are you just merging your main landing page with whatever charity you're promoting at the time? If so, you could end up having trouble getting indexed later on (Google hates duplicate content with a passion). I see you've done mobile marketing, so you know what I'm talking about and you know how to get around that.  I'm going to just judge your main page from now on.    CharityPush is revolutionizing the way people help charities by donating money to your favorite cause each time you download a free mobile app!   This seems like you may have had something once that was just about CharityPush and later decided to add some ""yous!"" in there to connect emotionally with the user. It's a little weird, you may want to revise this to make it flow better.  How Does It Work?  What you have here isn't really a ""how it works"" kind of block. A how it works is a clear progression of steps that helps me understand what I do and what you do. ""Unique Charities"" isn't a first step and ""Monthly Updates"" shouldn't be the best outcome in a how it works type block. Figure out how to frame this better, you can do it OP!  Also, I should be able to click on ""unique charities"" and find out what charities you work with, your selection criteria, stuff like that. Where does the money come from? What's the catch? People are suspicious and it's your job as the salesman (even for a charity!) to get them to understand how it all works. If you have partnerships with top app developers, where's the social proof block littered with logos of big name companies, game logos, charity logos, stuff like that? I'm not accusing your of anything, but this is what's going through people's heads when they see this kind of a site.  Share with your friends  Your block here says it's been shared three times? You say you've got partnerships but stuff like this makes your venture look anemic - remove the share counts, it just looks bad.   I just checked your ""About Us"" page, love the whole reluctant hero spin on your story - BUT - you may want to focus more on the good works you're doing and less on yourself since you don't have much credibility yet in this sphere.   Quick TLDR;  Right now you have zero credibility or authority and you need to focus on showing that. Your site just comes off as thrown together and sketchy, like you're trying to make a quick buck. Not saying you are, but this is how it looks and as a marketer you know appearances are everything.  I know this is a startup and I know it's hard to establish yourself that way, but you have to figure this out or your idea is going to flounder. Talk to the devs/companies + charities you're working with and set up some cross promotion. You might not have credibility yet, but you can borrow it from your partners and get this thing off the ground!"
startups,3avfc9,theGodstopper,2,Wed Jun 24 00:51:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback, I really appreciate it. I've been waiting to get my landing page polished before having the charities, such as Trees for the Future, crosspost about us. I think the credibility factor is the main thing holding people back. Thanks again!"

startups,3avfc9,Deathspiral222,3,Wed Jun 24 00:29:43 2015 UTC,"No problem!   Block #1  In your first block, you have some readability issues:   ""Revolar.  Live Smart. Fear Less.""   The text fades into the horizontal slats of the park bench and makes it difficult to read. You'll want to make sure this gets fixed before you launch.  Another problem is that at first glance I don't know what Revolar does. Not to sound crude, but possibilities that ran through my mind were feminine hygiene stuff, something that helps with anxiety - it's just not very clear from that first block - but it needs to be. ""Live Smart, Fear Less"" is an awesome tag, but there needs to be more information here.  Also, I don't know off the bat if there's more content to scroll down and see that there's more content waiting, you might want to work on that here's what it looks like on a desktop  Block #2  The story here is very touching, but ""Live More with X"" feels out of place. I know we can't say what it really does, because it's terrifying that any of us should ever have to worry about that in a free and open society, but when we think of life we think of death and it's just not a good selling point.  Try framing it from the peace of mind angle, a gift from one sister to another so she'd feel safe and never be alone again.   Block #3  Here the little block could actually be interactive and help push conversions. Aside from living my life, what else can the product help me do? Feel safe? Go anywhere? You could ask your beta testers to fill out what Revolar helps them do and just have a few alternate to help people visualize the benefits (aside from the big horrible one that we all want to avoid)  Block #4  Here you find all of the benefits but it's structured in an odd way. ""It's hidden"" is definitely a benefit, while ""emergency alerts"" is a feature. Same for the other two features down below the image block ""Communicate, Simply"" (this one may also be difficult to read, and you'll want to avoid weird pauses between words for effect unless they really need to be there).  How can we translate these features into real-world benefits that women are searching for? ""Information Security"" could be reframed as ""Revolar Keeps Your Information Safe, Too"". There's lots of ways to help your customer visualize the benefit of your product's features (because most won't be able to figure it out on their own, that's our job as salespeople :)  I noticed on your old landing page that you have LOTS of media coverage that you're going to want to carry over into your new landing page (just shrink those icons down a bit and put them into a block of their own!).   You might want to have a link to an FAQ page that addresses some common questions that people have before they buy. And one last thing...  Your page has no call to action! There's a subscribe box waaaaaaaaay down there are the bottom, but if you don't tell people what you need them to do they'll just wander away and find someone else's site who will :)   Good luck!"

startups,3avfc9,Robby_Rob,4,Tue Jun 23 21:07:46 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/tomt0m! I remember you!  First I googled ""analytics for blogs"" and I found you  That tagline doesn't make me want to click it :( You'll want to work on that and make it more impactful and show the benefit so people click and sign up!  Block #1  The text here isn't bad, it could be tightened up a bit.  The problem here is that you've got a blurry gif and when I try to click on it to enlarge it I'm taken directly to the sign up page. You might want to use something like an HQ png file so it looks better, and reconsider making it a hotlink because I might not be ready to buy just yet (if I was I'd have clicked the ""Sign Up"" cta button!)  Block #2  Okay so in the ""Analyze your traffic in real time"" block you have:   ""Real time web analytics""  ""Per page analytics""  ""Live traffic""    And it's all looking kind of samey (real time, live, analytics, etc. etc.) so you may want to work on differentiating each of these. Also, these are features, not actual benefits. What's the benefit of real time web analytics? You say it right there: instant updates! Same with the other things. If I've been looking at analytics solutions all day for my block seeing the words ""page per analytics"" might not really grab me, but someone saying ""Full Reports for Every Page"" might. I know you have to balance SEO with this kind of thing, but you can always do that in your little descriptor texts.  Block #3   ""Do people actually read what you are writing?""   This sounds a little unnatural (I know you're not a native English speaker), this needs to pique interest like:  ""How much of your audience are you really reaching?""  ""Find out how far you reach with ReadRatio""  ""Learn who's reading and for how long""  or something like that, focus on natural language you'd use in a conversation while addressing questions they already have in their head. There are dozens of ways to do it!  Same goes with the ""reads count"" and ""scroll depth and active time"" sections. You'll want to probably just hire someone to come in and make this all flow together a little better and demonstrate the benefits of each thing (example: I know that you're tracking the number of times my articles have been read since that's what this does, does this need to be here? Probably not:)  You're running into the blurry pictures problem here in these sections, you'll want to update these too.    ""Never miss a beat and react at the right moment.""   More awkward phrasing here, (the two things are kind of the same so you're saying the same thing twice), it's also really general and could be applied to ANYTHING. What's the ultimate benefit of being notified during traffic spikes and referral tracking that makes ReadRatio special?  Block #4  Plans and Pricing  This is a UX thing, but you may want to find a way to make the plan you want to sell the most stand out. Other than the amount of pageviews I can track per month, it doesn't look like there's much of a benefit between the $10 plan and the $140 plan. That's not great!  Your CTA buttons on the page are a little sad (""Sign Up"" and ""Try the demo"" are very bland). These are probably the same calls to action that people have been getting from every other website and they're kind of blind to them now. When people sign up for ReadRatio, they're not just signing up - they're getting the best damn analytics thingy for blogs and your buttons need to reflect that! Try:  ""Get started today""  ""Create your account""  ""Start tracking now""  Anything that prompts me to take an action.   I notice down below you have a ""start your 14 day free trial"" thing, but you don't mention this anywhere else on your website. You should! The CTA on that button is generic, but knowing I can try it risk free on my own site for a couple weeks is going to help me sign up and give it a try :)  Stuff to Think About  A mini-FAQ on the front page might help you head off any objections and help people see the benefits (and it'll help save time for you, since you won't have to answer silly questions via email). Later when you're powering more bloggers, you can leverage their names (with permission, of course) as social proof to help boost conversions here, too."

startups,3avfc9,Robby_Rob,5,Tue Jun 23 21:24:41 2015 UTC,"Hey hey! I actually started off my career working for one of the huge vacation resellers, it's a brutal business. Lots of fun though!  Block #1  First thing I notice is there's no contact page up top in the nav bar. You'll want to fix this as it both builds trust with your users and many advertisers require you to have that on your page to comply with their guidelines. I know you're pre-launch and everything, but still, a good idea to get that on there now.   Do incredible things. With zero planning.  Instantly find and book things to do through locals who know.   Dat. Walken. Pause.  Can we write those two broken sentences up top without making it a weird little disjointed thought? Maybe!  I notice you don't mention Scout at all here! That's a mistake buddy! You want them to instantly see the benefit of scout and associate good things with you. The last thing you want is people to scroll up or check the url bar in their browser to remember what they're looking at again.  Something like ""Scout makes it easy to yada yada"" helps people to form the idea in their minds that Scout knows what's what and can help them plan their next trip. We need to condense that second sentence, it's 11 words and could be 9.   Your first block also appears to be the only block, you may want an arrow or visual indicator that there's more content below this block, or heck, a ""What can Scout do for you"" or some crap button that just pops me down to the next block.  Block #2  ""Get insider tips"" - is something you tell to an overworked stockbroker that wants to make a quick buck, yeah? Travelers want to know about all those cool little places off the beaten path, they want an experience, not tips. Reframe this to be experiential!  ""Leave the Planning to Us"" is really, really overdone - especially in the concierge/hospitality industry. Your descriptor text is an awesome benefit statement (""A real person to find and book your experience""! Work this into the text up top!)  ""Think Big"", well, how is thinking big a benefit of working with Scout? I can think big on my own, and for free!  Your pictures are okay, but they could be better. If you're providing me with awesome local experts, why are you showing me some lady doing her Sunday Brunch shoppin'? I can get the vibe of the middle picture (party on the beach with sparklers because we got this), but these images are super important to how people perceive your service. You want everything to align with your messaging to lead people further and further down the page :)  Block #3  Guarantees are great. But this should actually be further down the page. A ""How Scout Works"" block would be so awesome and help people know what they're in for. You want to put guarantees super close to your final call to action that way I've already prepared myself to open my heart and wallet to what scout has to offer me!  Block #4  I don't even. You... threw down some pretty pictures? Alright! But how is that propelling me towards signing up? Were you worried you didn't have enough content here?  Block #5  Are these real people, OP? No offense but they don't look like real people (placeholders are a-okay with MVPs, btw!). If they ARE real people, put their names below 'em and a little bit of text about their experience, etc. to build trust.   Avoid ""hand selected"" when talking about staff. We hand-select gifts, and we carefully screen staff. ""Seasoned pros""? Pro-whats? Are they licensed travel agents? Different states have different laws, and ""pro"" is always open to interpretation!  Block #6   ""Sign up for our waitlist""  ""join now""   Well, these two CTAs seem to be at odds with one another. Also, no one wants to sign up for a waitlist... but they would love to know when you're live! They'd like to be notified, get their own personal scout, etc. etc.   You just need to make this a little more actionable here buddy! You can do it!"

startups,3avfc9,Nailbrain,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:19:23 2015 UTC,"I think that sometimes when we're trying to put our ""business face"" on to attract customers we kind of turn into robots.   Here are some things to look out for:  The text of your website has some unnatural language and unnecessary text (i.e. the viewer knows where they are, it says right up there in your logo!). When you're trying to sell to a client, you'd probably never say ""There is no project I can't tackle"", right?  You'd use conjunctions, and make that flow into a more natural order of words. Take a few days away from your site, go back and look at that intro text with fresh eyes and start again.  One more thing, people are coming here to learn about you, not just your work.    Consider including a page called ""About"" where you talk about your experience, education, training and former clients.   Separate your portfolio out into types of media you worked on so people can find relevant examples a lot easier.  Look into Wordpress. With it you'll be able to build a more professional, current site (even with a template) that'll help you stay competitive. This site is a little dated and that may scare some customers off.   Best of luck!"

Sorry buddy.  Quick TLDR;  Right now your page is very BitMetronome focused when it should be BitMetronome Customer focused. We get it, ya'll are the bees knees, but now it's your turn to translate all these features and programmerese into something that the small businessman can understand.   Block #1  ""In rhythm with your business""  This is kind of an odd pun, like some kind of Salsa dance studio slogan, but it's not the worst thing I've ever seen really. The problem is that you've got white text on a moving background that's bright; when the metronome timer thing gets close to business you can see the word, but the word fades away when the little hand moves away. Your customer shouldn't have to fight to figure out what the text on the page is.   Your CTA ""Find Out More"" is pretty bland. What's one amazing thing that you can do for your customers? THAT should be your button.  Block #2  ""Our Specialities""  I don't know why one word is black and one word is blue. Changing colors should be done for a reason, but it's kind of done throughout your page in a weird way.   Now, you talk about how you bring passion and expertise to everything you do - but what's the benefit to the customer? That's what should go here.  Same with the three things below, you tried to play around with the different services you offer by giving them cutesy names but it's kind of weird. Three places business happens don't go along with ""OUR SPECIALTIES"".  Block #3   WE’RE GREAT AT WHAT WE DO  We deliver handcrafted solutions tailored to your business needs.   People handcraft stuff at Etsy, but you're... solutions architects! Or something professional! You can't bounce between trying to be super businessy and super folksy, it makes your messaging all weird. You guys are going to have to figure out the path that best fits you and your customer and stick with it.  That being said, you haven't really made me excited about what you guys are up to over there. Right after this block you've got a CTA block with a ""let us know"" button. Try to avoid using ""lets"" type calls to action. Like we talked about waaay up there.   ""Revolutionize Your Business with One Email"" (button text: Get Started Now)  You want something exciting that spells out the benefit and gets them to do something. No one wants to ""let you know"" that they want to give you piles of money :) Always remember that.  Block #5  ""How We Work""  Cool, but you could frame this in a way that tells me what you can do for me! LIKE THAT TINY TEXT BELOW THAT! Everyone wants their customers to love them, why not use this as a benefit to drive your own customers to you?  Block #6   LET’S BUILD SOMETHING GREAT  Heard enough? Here’s how to reach us.   They don't want to reach you, they want you to transform their business and help them stop worrying about this dumb crap ^ . Build around that, not around your contact form :)"

startups,3avfc9,thetermy,2,Wed Jun 24 03:48:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry I had to take a break, everything started looking the same to me and that's never good.  Quick TLDR;   It's all a little generic, but I bet with a little time you can focus more on the needs, wants and benefits that managers and developers. Speak to their pain and demonstrate how you can make it go away!  Get rid of the screenshots and split that second block into easier to digest bites. Give me a reason to download! Differentiate yourselves as much as possible, too.   Block #1   Test Coverage, without the pain   Someone. Went to, Christopher Walkens... School of Copywriting!  Does that comma REALLY need to be there? No, it doesn't. The main attention grabber needs to be short and sweet, avoid commas here as much as you can.  Block #2  So here I'm looking at three things that look like a mixture of benefits and user types, but the last one just says anyone anywhere can use it. It's a little confusing. It's like you mixed up ""Why you need x app"" and ""x app is for x and y"" a little. You can probably separate these out to make them shorter and make sure people are actually reading as they go down.  Block #3  Social proof! It's scrolling through the same one over and over again, that looks a little silly.  Block #4  Screenshots are cool and all, but this is the last block before your main CTA with ""download now"". A bunch of aimless screenshots aren't going to further your goal here. Think about going with a mini-FAQ, a how it works, something that focuses on the benefit and makes them try it.   Block #5  The problem with this page is I have no idea what your app does by the end of it ^ ^ I could have wandered in here, not been a developer and still wondered if this thing would do something for me. I should have a clear understanding of what's what by the end of the page."

startups,3avfc9,MyKickback,2,Wed Jun 24 04:22:28 2015 UTC,"I just chortled like a Ferengi when I saw this site. I think I scared my cats a little. Ohh this is going to be good.  I love squeeze pages.  First things first, I run adblocker when I browse and 15 items were blocked on your page. I couldn't even load your ""trusted by"" social proof block and all the little blocks of tweets 'n things because of my adblocker. MTG is the realm of nerds and nerds use adblock. You might want to think on this a bit.  block #1   MTG doesn't have to be expensive.  Magic is a trading card game. ProTrader improves your trading skills by helping you research prices, spot the hottest cards, learn new trading strategies and more!   This block here is the first thing people see, the thing that makes them lose their minds and keeps reading. If you saw this on another site... would you lose your mind and click that big orange sign-up button?  No, probably not.  Your customers already know that their MTG habit is threatening their marriage and ruined their small child's last birthday party. They know they need to get smarter about how they trade cards - but they don't need to know that it ""doesn't have to be expensive"".  What's the main benefit of your site? Protrader can help MTG-addicts save hundreds if not thousands of dollars each year on their cards. Capitalize on that.   block #2, #2.5  Your social proof block is blocked by adblock - which is worrying. If I'm running adblock it just looks empty, like no one trusts you. If you're an affiliate of protrader or something you should have a talk with them about this.  And the block below that is littered with 9 different mini-blocks of features that someone with a raging MTG habit isn't really going to be able to translate into a direct benefit.   ""Daily Market Emails"" might be great for advanced traders, but regular traders are probably going to worry about being spammed every goddamn day by Protrader.   All of this stuff could be broken up more effectively into a features block and a benefits block. Shit, a ""How it works"" block would probably be helpful.  block #3, #3.5  Meh. As social proof goes, it's okay. If you could source quotes about people being able to make a good profit (as much as arbitrage was mentioned above) or discover hidden gems in their collection with Protrader, you might be able to frame this stuff for maximum impact.  CTA Buttons  Your CTA buttons, or call to action buttons, are pretty boring.   ""Sign up now!""  Well, you sign up for just about every other website - but you don't have to pay $5 a month to sign up to those. Why should I give you $5 a month, OP? Why should I give one goddamn about Protrader?   What wonderful benefit will I derive from signing up in the next sixty seconds? Is there a free trial?   I'm not trying to be harsh here OP, but if you don't prompt them to take an action and demonstrate the benefit of performing said action, they're going to shrug and wander away. Even ""Get Started"" or ""Become a Protrader"" would work better.  There's also no mini-FAQ on the page. This can be a good way to head off any objections.  Have a friend take a look at this and get their opinion, keep working on it buddy!"
startups,3avfc9,sillyjewsd,2,Sat Jun 27 00:21:45 2015 UTC,"This is amazing! Thank you so much :)  One random tidbit: ""Become a Protrader"" was my choice too but A/B testing had ""Sign up now!"" completely blow it out of the water - we saw a full 16% lift with the more boring version. I don't understand either - perhaps it's because the video ends with an exaltation to ""sign up now""?  But seriously, this is amazing feedback, thank you so much!   If you're an affiliate of protrader or something you should have a talk with them about this.   It's my site (www.mtgprice.com) - any idea why adblock would be picking it up as an ad?   There's also no mini-FAQ on the page. This can be a good way to head off any objections.   Any suggestions on where best to put this?  Again, thank you!"

It really is hit and miss, but if you're testing well with your current CTA keep it! Just make sure you keep testing as you grow, because things can randomly change.  I have no idea but I zoomed out here so you can see what's missing. It's blocking your little twitter pictures AND the little icons for the businesses that like you. http://i.imgur.com/I52JEPs.png I'm only using the default stuff in adblocker so no clue what's going on here :(  Towards the bottom is a good place for an FAQ! People usually have questions by the end of a page, and questions can easily become objections ^ ^ If you can overcome those, you'll convert better."

I see multiple sizes for your <p> tags and <links>.  Your <p> font size is WAY too big.  You use 24px for <p>!!!!!  Why are you using fixed font size when you are trying to make the site mobile friendly?  Calculate the size from px to em to ensure a good user experience on all devices or at the very least use @media to change it.

You need to have a stern talking to with your designer (you're your designer, aren't you OP?) and try and make this less crazy making. I mean, we've got bright yellow, bright green, ULTRA BRIGHT ORANGE and blue. And white text! Woo! This is going to make it hard to critique your words, OP, but I'm gonna give it my best shot.  Block #1   A New Subscription Box  Every Month  The Subscription For Subscription Boxes  Too Many Subscription Boxes to Choose From?   laptop with subs (lol did you really tag your image this?!)   Why Not Try Them All?   Why not both, OP?! You need to find a way to tell them that you send them a different subscription box every month (a new sub box every month is what sub services do, you need to tell people what makes you different right in the first line!) so they don't just get bored and wander away.  Your laptop graphic could use some love here, OP. The graphics down below are kind of generic and rough too (if this is just an MVP it's cool, but your thingy says it's live and it never hurts to improve as you go on.)  Block #2  A ""How it Works"" block already! Yay!  Do you pick the random box I get or do I?  Some people might be confused here and you'll want to avoid confusion this early in the game. Under #3 ""A New One Each Month"", it's pretty apparent already that they're getting something customized just for them - what you want to do here is reassure them that they'll be getting something new every time... like:  ""Yes, seriously, a new box each month or it's on us."" Guarantees like that are hard to beat!  Your CTA button here is super generic. ""Let's Get Started"". Meh, OP. You can do better than this. You're running the best goddamn subscription for subscription boxes that ever was, put that energy into your buttons!  Block #3   “Seriously? A Subscription For Subscription Boxes?!”  -Everyone   Now OP, I have made levity my life's work... but ""everyone"" is not a credible source of social proof to help convert lookie-loo browsers into buyers. It's cute 'n all sure, but again, you can do better.    The Subscription You Never Thought Existed, Yet Always Knew You Needed.   Not bad! I like the information presented off to the side about all the cool stuff you can get... but the graphic is horrendous. What's the mantra of the day OP? I bet you know it by now... c'mon...  YOU CAN DO BETTER SO DO IT.  You've changed up your CTA button to ""Choose a Smarter Subscription"". Your offering isn't smart, it's awesome. People could literally get a new box every month for almost 4 years before they had to repeat a box from the same company. No one else can offer them this, capitalize on that!  Block #4  Social proof amirite? Good job, but this block just looks horrendous :( The weird hands reaching out of the void to give me an upbum, the tiny little rows of happy subscribers. There's gotta be a better way to show off this information here!  Block #5   Launch Day Is Here!  You HAVE to Try It   Well OP you're not the boss of me so you can't make me try it ^ ^ Seriously though, this is your last CTA for the entire page, this is your time to shine here.   Speaking of shining, why is there ANOTHER CTA button that's all orange and sad and square right below it that says ""SUBSCRIBE""? It's stealing the thunder of your bigger button, ain't nobody got time for that.  There are a few problems overall that you might want to address:  First, what's the price? I know you want to keep it a secret until after they're invested in the whole sign-up process, but not having easily accessible prices is an enormous barrier to conversion OP. Seriously. Your customer should never, ever have to work to find out how much something is going to cost them. If you're worried about costs, use the lowest (usually annual plan) price per box and put something like:  ""From $27 per month!""   to tease them in. I only found your prices after I found the opportunities page, that's bizarre man! The only work a customer should have to do on your site is adding items to the basket and inputting their credit card information.   Your third block needs to be reworked into a more solid benefits block. That graphic with the numbers does more than anything else in this section and that's not good. You guys are providing a solid service, just don't overthink it and you'll be okay.  You fix up all that stuff and let me know how it goes!"

startups,3avfc9,YPCrumble,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:12:23 2015 UTC,"I love your swinging button!  Block #1  The main value prop here is a little generic. The text below it is confusing (do you really want them to text you first and then use your portal as a second option? Probably not.)  ""Get Legal Help"" is a bit of a wonky CTA. That's the main objective, but what's the benefit? Helping your customers find a solution or *get your answer"", you know, something more beneficial. There's a lot of ways you can spin that.  Block #2, #2.5   Legal.io powers legal communities everywhere.   In the United States? Abroad?   Then I have a big block of legal guides, but I don't know how the site works yet. A ""how it works"" block would go better here, people like to know what they're getting into.  Block #3  You have a block of professionals here, but professional-whats? Are they paralegals, attorneys, lawyers, researchers, professors? I know you might want to frame a paralegal as an expert alongside a 20 year veteran attorney but if people don't know what people do they might get confused, and a confused customer bounces back out.  Block #4  Your ""How It Works"" block could be further up. You might also want to reframe your ""steps"" as a mixed action/benefit, like you already have in the text below :) You're empowering people here, show 'em how you're doing that!  Additional thoughts:  There is no mini-FAQ on the front page to address objections (not always necessary), and no full-fledged FAQ (that I can find, anyway) linked on the front page. You want to have those available so people can easily find answers to questions like ""Are these real lawyers?"" or ""Is this legal?"". A question answered is an objection overcome :)   Are the legal guides the most important part of the site? The amount of screen they take up and their position on the page makes me think they are. If they're not, reconsider finding a way to reframe this to give the thing that's most important on your site time to shine.  Right now you just don't have a lot on the page that makes me want to hire you. Work on building trust and demonstrating value and you'll be able to get more people to work with you :)"

startups,3avfc9,killthenoise,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:38:01 2015 UTC,"Falcon marketing.com   I've got 24 gigs of ram in my machine and your animations made my computer hrrrng a little bit. You might want to dial that back some, just to stay on the safe side with users who might not have the best hardware.  Also, I know a lot of this stuff is weighted with SEO/LSI keywords/terms, so I'm trying not to be too harsh here. Just remember you can always load crap terms into the smaller text, but your Headings/Headers need to wow them and keep them moving down the page to where you want them to do something.  And as always, I'm analyzing this from the point of some random business that wandered over to your website looking for a solution.   Block #1   WE BUILD SLEEK,  RESPONSIVE  WEBSITES  We build scalable websites that work great on your tablet, smartphone and all other devices. Your website is your storefront; trust the experts at Falcon Marketing with your next project.   And all of your competitors are saying the exact thing. The problem is that customers don't want a sleek, responsive website - they want something that works and makes them money. They want the benefit, not the feature. What's the benefit of a great website? You state some of them below - websites that work with every device, and always-on storefront, etc. etc.   Boil down to what makes you guys special, how it benefits them best and then knock their pants off with it OP!  Block #2  VERY GOOD. TOO MANY PEOPLE MAKE WEBSITES AND DON'T HAVE CASE STUDIES. It makes me crazy. I'm not sure why there's a comma in ""beautiful, modern web design"". I know it's not grammatically correct BUT a comma should be a thoughtful pause that addresses something in copy. You don't want them to just pause on ""beautiful"" out of nowhere.   We've been producing beautiful and powerful websites since 2012. Our websites are built using PHP, CSS3, HTML5, JS-- you name it, we can do it. Our specialty is ensuring your website will be cross platform compatible so that they look great on any device or medium, from mobile to tablet and desktop pc. Don't hesistate to contact us, one of our designers is ready to take your call and help bring your vision to life.   So have your competitors. this is your time to shine OP and show them what makes you different. You buttered them up with your case studies, now it's time to deliver and wow them. Avoid generic language here and hone in on what you guys do best.  Block #3  Yes, you do build stunning, scalable websites - but what's the benefit? You've already stated everything in this block before, you could use this block for something more important like your ""What we do"" block.  Block #4  The text here is pretty cringey, OP. I know you're trying to address objections with this block, which is always a good thing, but it's not great.   After the down payment, your final payment isn't due until you are 100% satisfied with the final product. We really do believe that the client comes first, we don't just say that.   Well that just put an idea in my head that may not have been there before - i.e. ""have they had problems in the past with clients accusing them of not really being concerned with the work?"" It's important that you watch how you word things in sections like these so you can creating new objections while trying to solve existing ones.  Block #5  Now, your business/website is called ""Falcon Marketing"" and you only talk about marketing here down the page at the very end - and the marketing block is way at the end, too. It makes me wonder if you're really a marketing company trying to be a design/dev shop, or if you're a design/dev shop trying to be a marketing company.   Block #6  You have a big portfolio block here - but only one category, web design. You say that you do WD, App dev, branding AND online marketing but where's the proof? Also, are these all of your examples or all of your best examples? You don't want to overload the customer.   Block #6, #7  These should essentially be the same block, I'm not sure why you separated them out. There's also no FAQ page, which can be helpful in overcoming users objections before they buy. Remember that you shouldn't just say you'd love to hear from them. Businesses don't want to hear from you, they want you to fix their shit :) Capitalize on that and get them excited to enter their information, OP!"
startups,3avfc9,SparkyRobinson,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:15:57 2015 UTC,Site name is MyKickback.com. We are releasing a new design later this week so I would like to hear what you have to say to see if we are making the necessary adjustments.
startups,3avfc9,SparkyRobinson,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:22:03 2015 UTC,"I may be looking at this new design today! Have no idea! I needed to take a break before I looked at any new websites, sitting here for hours on end is exhausting ^ ^  block #1  You've started with benefits, which is not bad - but there's three and if I'm not paying attention to the manually triggered slider I'm going to blow past it. That's not really ideal. This first block should state the very best benefit you offer your customers, mention your service and get them to click that button or keep scrolling to read more.   A generic benefit with a big block of text isn't all that inspiring :)  block #2  You do it better, for less?! TAKE THAT WALMART!  You can focus on value, but you don't ever really want price to be the main benefit you put forward for your service (and what do you do better? Try to be specific!)  ""Quick Registration"" is a good benefit, but how does this benefit the customer? Can they start receiving refunds in a day? maybe ;)  Same for ""powerful platform"" and ""set it and forget it"". These are both very generic but could become very juicy bits of text to get them to keep scrolling!  block #3  So your mission is to make my life easier. AWESOME. But that's every company's promise :( Also, how does Mykickback work? If I'm a customer I might wonder if it works on mobile, what shippers you support, stuff like that. Make it more benefit oriented instead of trying to promise them the world.   And always try to make sure that the longest thing on your page is the most important. If your guarantee that you won't muck things up is the most important thing to you guys, still try to pare this down a bit or give it its own page for people who want to see what makes you different.  block #4  Is BS&P an important company? Do you have other quotes from other customers? I know you're probably a startup and may not have a big audience yet, but don't be afraid to ask for quotes from your beta testers and make this flip through several testimonials.   Protip: testimonials with pictures test good, and testimonials with pictures and a link to their website/twitter/whatever test even better.   block #5  ""We're Social!""  YAY SOCIAL! But this is the final block on your page and it dead ends. No talk about different packages you offer, no call to action asking me to take a risk-free trial or anything. People who reach a deadend like this are going to turn around and go back to Google. Always be mindful that your page is a road that needs to go somewhere!"
startups,3avfc9,KevType9,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:58:43 2015 UTC,"Off topic, but what should I pay a copywriter of your skill level (freelance) and what should I look for in potential candidates?"
startups,3avfc9,KevType9,2,Wed Jun 24 01:28:47 2015 UTC,"Freelance isn't a skill level :)  Many freelancers have years of agency experience under their belt, they may have just burned out from all the politics or wanted the freedom to work on projects that actually interested them. But the longer a copywriter survives the more they cost to hire, because it's really not an industry for people who can't provide results.  What you're looking for also depends on what you're having them do. Landing pages, printed sales collateral, product copy, email marketing, all that stuff takes different skill sets and many people only specialize in a specific thing. That makes work that's not your own difficult to price.  I have a freelancing friend that makes six figures just doing email stuff for a couple  different mid-range e-commerce companies. Another that makes $40k/year writing advertorials, another that makes $25k/year blogging about random crap. It varies pretty wildly."
startups,3avfc9,KevType9,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:49:47 2015 UTC,"Freelance isn't a skill level :)   Sorry, what I meant was ""What should I pay a freelancer of your skill level"".  I work at a sizable ecommerce operation, 5-6k orders per month. It's a hardware/industrial type of store. I'd be looking for copy for 1 email per week. A set of several transactional emails. Review of category descriptions, policy pages and faq. A few oddball pages about once a week.  Not exactly exciting stuff, but I'd like for it to be as effective as possible."

startups,3avfc9,chingflingfung,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:05:16 2015 UTC,"Dammit I lost the entire thing I was writing here and I want to scream.   Quick TLDR;  It's important that you work on differentiating yourselves from other companies, right now you have a very boring, very bland marketing profile page; some of it looks faked even, and you want to be very careful about that. I'm not here to judge, I'm just telling you that a business that's been around for a bit is going to be very incredulous here.  I'm going to be brief because it's almost midnight here and I'm tired ^ ^  First, there is nothing original about this website. I understand you're a SEM/SEO/Marketing company, but there is nothing that makes you stand out. This is bad, because if you can't sell yourself how are you going to sell my stuff?  Your tag line:   Smarter Organic Marketing Consultancy   Is literally a bunch of buzzwords strung together. You are six guys that are doing amazing things, there's just no need for this kind of sameness. What is the primary benefit that you provide your customers? What's the main thing that you can do for them? THAT is what your tag should be.  Block #2  You just wrote out 4 popular marketing terms, nothing special. These are FEATURES, but what's the BENEFIT, op? What's the benefit to a really well done SEM/SEO campaign, SMM, or content marketing strategy? Drill down to find the benefit and put THAT on the page.  Block #3  You call yourselves a group of renegades and marketers, but you need to back that claim up.  Block #4  You use a quote to try and drive me to the contact page. That's different.  Block #5  I don't know why there is a comma here:   How We Join The Dots, And Get Things Done.   It's cool you have a bit about your process here, but you need to focus on getting the customer excited about what you do first before you start breaking out project workflow and Emerson quotes.  Block #6  Another quote block, with a ""Let's Start"". You don't ever want to use ""Let's"" in your call to action buttons. You should incentivize the user to act, like ""Get Your Free Consultation Now"". You know, something that gets them excited and gets them clicking  Block #7  You have a big list of companies you've worked with, but your Facebook has 53 likes and you don't really have much of a history from what I can tell. It's important to be very careful about your social proof, you can embellish a little but you don't want to over embellish here.   Expanding on that point, your social proof below that is two written statements from previous clients. If you say that you worked with Nissan and Groupon, you should be able to get recommendations from them."
startups,3avfc9,Asswizards,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:12:16 2015 UTC,"Awesome.  Just my replies to explain some stuff :)  Block #2  Fully agree, I have some case studies that I need to publish here. True.  Block 3  I mean, I've been a disruptive asshole in every company I was in, delivered great work and impressed clients, but stepped on my superiors toes and ate their lunch in the process.  Not sure how that really translates into copy, other than testimonials from my former bosses to say ""He's a disruptive fucker, but he delivers results like nobody's business""  Block #4  Hangover from the template I used. might well just kill the quotes.  Block #5  Should be OK once Block 2 is fixed up, no?  Block #6  Similar to Block #4, if I keep it, I will change the CTA text.  Block #7  This is where I was careful to use ""Background"" and not ""Previous Clients""  These are all clients I worked with, but via my previous agencies or directly.  I worked for Groupon, I worked in an Agency for HSBC, etc... Here is my resume: http://danclarkie.co.uk/cv/  I will certainly try and get some testimonials from them though :)     Really appreciate the feedback, will action on all of these!!  Thanks!"
startups,3avfc9,Asswizards,2,Wed Jun 24 04:38:52 2015 UTC,"Remember, you don't have to explain anything at all to me - these are just objections you're going to encounter when you're trying to bring in new clients. I'm not going to check out your resume, it's none of my business. I'm just reviewing things like a random user coming to your site would.  Block #3 isn't bad, it just needs to be moved further down. You should have them hooked pretty good before you talk about yourselves (aka you can't say you're disruptive after two blocks of doing the same stuff everybody else is doing, you gotta back up that claim ahead of time!)  Years ago when I first started out as a junior copywriter my boss said something awesome to me that I'll never forget:  ""The customer doesn't give a fuck about you or about who you are. They care about themselves, their problems and what you can do to fix them. That's it.""  It's super harsh but it's very true. Even when you're establishing your authority, it has to be framed in a context of benefiting the customer. Let those angry alcoholic words fuel your quest for the perfect landing page my friend!  Good luck!"

I'm trying to answer these in the order they're received ^ ^  OK so I tested this on two monitors and a phone just to make sure I wasn't being nitpicky:  Block #1  Man, Arima looks great I wonder what it does!? I'll probably never know because it's white text on a bright background and I'm gonna squint myself blind trying to read!   Arima is a Q&A website for mass opinion. Ask questions, get answers from users all around the world, and see them visualized and compared with the rest of the planet.   Visual.ly meets Quora?! Sounds cool! But that's all kind of squished in there.   And you might not want to make your big tag up top ""Welcome to Arima"". People usually know where they are, and you could use this space for something snappy about answering questions instead.  Block #2   With Arima, you can...   This is basically ""how Arima works"", not exactly a benefits block. But you're trying to make it benefitty which always I commend.  So you've got a nice looking page but there's nothing really happening on it. And it doesn't look anything like the rest of your site!   Consider doing this:   block #1: snappy question related intro big text to replace ""welcome to arima"" + shorter non-run-on sentence showing the benefits of going with Arima over Quora. block #2: how it works. you have this already, but don't be afraid to use more than one word to explain a single step. block #3: Benefits of arima. You have over 40,000 current contributors. holy crap. that's a benefit, so's being able to visualize stuff. help them see what they can do with all your awesome features that'll lure them inside.   If you don't want to change anything, just make that text and ""browse Arima"" button a little bigger. (and browse arima is kind of a weird CTA, think something more action oriented that your customers want to do than browse a website they may have never heard about before!)"

Block #1   Kitty Couch by Feline Be Mine   You might not want to start off with your product name right up there in big letters. The purpose of that headline there is to get me to keep reading - but a user will see that and keep scrolling to see if they can find something more interesting to look at.  I like your text below: ""No one loves a shredded couch""! You could incorporate this into the headline, grab their attention.   Negative: ""Because no one loves a shredded couch"" large   ""Kitty Couches by Feline Be Mine"" somewhat smaller  ""dkfjsdljfdsljk"" body text   Though starting it off with a negative can have negative effects. Terpin prescribes testing a positive and a negative headline to see which works the best.  Your image of the cat looks like you just plopped it on the page.   Normally I harp on people with puns, but in this area of things you can be corny. Cat people love cheese :)  ""Buy Now"" isn't really much of a CTA. Anyone can buy anything at anytime, you need to differentiate here.  Block #2  I like all the features and benefits listed here, but they're all squished together into a tiny space and people might just scroll over it thinking it's not important.  Consider titling this section with something that catches eyeballs and formatting this area better.  Block #3  PICTURES OF CATS!  Block #4  Your social proof is 3 meme cats saying good things about your product. This is astounding. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing but I can't help but laugh at this.  Block #5  Hah! Your pricing!   Your middle option to buy is purple. This is a bit odd. I know you have a theme thing to be keeping with here, but if it was yellow like the ""Buy Now"" button it might work better.  And your ""buy now"" button. Buy Now is just a terrible CTA. You've been all whacky and creative on this page so far, I bet you can figure out a better CTA (call to action) here.  No contact page, no FAQ page, no About Us. That can be problematic, you might want to think about that.

This:   Record your guests in high quality directly from their web browser    Isn't as clear as it could be. Just your guests? What about yourself? ;) You'd be surprised how literal people can be with things, so you'll want to make sure this not only grabs their attention but isn't generic.  ""Get Started Now!"" is okay, but could you use some kind of podcasting phrase in here instead? Probably. I don't know much about podcasting so I can't suggest anything  block #2, #3, #4  Do these honestly need to be separated into different blocks? probably not. You could do all of these together more condensed (I thought you were maybe doing this for mobile scrolling but the pictures are huge on my phone)  If you put all of these into a single block (aka: ""how it works""), you can have your #3 block for features, and #4 for a quick FAQ.  You don't have an ""About Us"" page or a contact page. What if the thing doesn't work? What if I have questions pre-signup? Does it work on phones, of iOS, Android, Windows? You don't have any of this information on the page. No social pages? Think about it, sometimes it's easier for them to bitch at you on twitter/facebook than it is for you to try to respond to a long angry email when the plugin isn't working.  Is the offering free?

Block #1   ALL-IN-ONE SECURE COMMUNICATION ENVIRONMENT  THAT GIVES PRIVACY TO BUSINESS   Businesses don't want to be given anything, do they? This is a bit fuzzy, you need to drill down to the ultimate benefit and put that here.  Below I just have a jumble of features meant to excite me, but I'll tell you a secret that you probably don't know:  Most customers don't care about features, at least not right away.  What they care about are benefits. The decision maker is looking at this thing and thinking ""What's the difference between VOIP and Video Conference?! What's the benefit?!"" It's your job OP to provide them with that benefit.  Block #2   LEVEL OF COMPLEX PROTECTION  NEVER REACHED BEFORE   Did you really put a picture of a mountain here? Woo! Damn.   Block #3  Finally, we reach a place that kind of talks about what this thing does. ""How it Works"" should usually be higher up than some random mountain looking thing.  Could we make the content of this block shorter and horizontal? Probably.  Block #4  And right below that you have something titled ""Convenient"" like it just popped up out of nowhere. It's a bit jarring. Do you really need all this text? Probably not.  Block #5   Advanced   That's not a title that makes me want to read. Same goes for the little text below this, it's just formatted to make my eyes glaze over and keep on scrolling.   Block #6  ""Effective""  Oh. These are benefits blocks I think! The way everything is structured, I'm just breezing over it. That's not good.  Block #7  Pricing and Costs  First it looks like it's free, then I keep scrolling down and it's $379 per year plus more money per extension. That can be confusing and turn people off.  Your contact form at the bottom, it really doesn't make me want to contact you. You want this to invite a question, not more tedium for the reader.    Are you selling to tech people or to normal people? Either way, you can pack a lot of this meandering information into other pages - right now it's just a big jumbly mess of stuff. Good news is that if you could condense things and focus on the real benefits of your offering instead of trying to force features to look like a benefit, you'd be okay!   You really, really don't need to ramble on about ""advanced, convenient, efficient"" page filler stuff. You'll get there OP!"

When you guys finish your new design (the new one DOES look better), post it in the next thread.  Sorry that's not as helpful as it could be, I would just be too critical based on how it looks than how it reads right now and wouldn't be all that helpful anyway.

startups,3avfc9,geraldpereira,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:18:58 2015 UTC,"E-commerce is a strange beast - luckily for you I know that area really well!  Landing Page  I know people that go in for this kind of product are usually on the spartan side, but that doesn't mean your site has to be spartan. There's no value message here, it's just a page with three different (and increasingly expensive) products that I can buy.  There's no information about why this is better for me, how this is going to save me money. You don't even try to tell me why ketosoy is better than any other option. I don't even know if it's actually keto or not, there's a lot of questions going through my head.  I mean, there's just nothing here other than a store - and that's okay if you're driving people to this page from somewhere else.  But if someone just comes in from Google (which is not really going to happen, since you don't really have anything that Google can index onsite) they're going to have no idea what's going on.  If you want ideas, you should check out your competitors to see what they're doing and start figuring this out, OP.   https://www.soylent.com  Look at all that, they've got an explainer video, they tell you why you should buy it and have all kinds of information on there.  Product Copy  Very spartan and doesn't inspire me to buy. You might want to explain what sucralose is, for people paranoid about adding calories (yes, it's calorie-free but they might not know that). And why each item is fucking awesome. That'd help you sell some stuff.    I'm not going to jerk you around here, you have a LOT of work ahead of you. Right now you basically have a glory hole and are asking people to stick something inside and hope they don't get burned. Keep working on it!"

Your signup box could be a bit better. Drop ""sign up"" from the top of the box and focus on their action more. Also, the ""sign up"" button below could be ""get started"" or something that's more action oriented. People are really blind to boring ""sign up"" buttons, you should avoid using them at all costs.  Block #2, #3  The text here actually isn't that bad, but the icons are kinda meh OP. They're really generic, something that any site could have. You'll want to differentiate yourselves from every other website using the same iconset.  It's just a super lean page that doesn't give me a lot of information. Why would I want to organize my book club, for example? And why would I want to organize it with you? Is it free forever? These are questions you'll want to figure out :)"

This looks a little dated and the ""alcoholic star trek"" font is cool and all... but it doesn't make me think ""These guys know bars!""   “Working with Bar and Restaurant Owners to Maximize Growth, Taking Their Business to the Next Level""   As a head bartender, if some salesguy came in and SHOUTED THIS REALLY LOUDLY AT YOU, what would you think? Would you be intrigued? Would you ask your bouncer to get him out?   Why are you talking at the customer like they're not even there, not mentioning the name of your business? This doesn't tell me what you can really do for my bar, and it doesn't really spark a connection between me and what you're doing either.  You are offering one of the most valuable services that a bar or restaurant owner could ever want: control over their business. With your help they're going to be able to wrangle vendors + food and drink costs, know where every drop of liquor is going and help set their staff up for success.  That's what you guys do, OP. And that's what you have to demonstrate here on the first page. Screw all this ""YOUR SUCCESS"", ""OUR TEAM"" and ""OUR SOLUTIONS"" stuff. Talk about real tangible stuff you guys can do for them. Do you offer pricing analysis to help them save? Run workshops to help keep management and staff aligned with the goals of the business?  Give them reasons to join up, OP!

I know that's probably a milestone, but it's pretty small and could make your audience wonder if they're really signing up for an ""upgraded nightlife experience"".   After all, how much leverage can 1100 users really buy you across an estimated 45,000 venues in a country of 200,000,000+ people 18 years and up?   Block #2   Your Nightlife Membership to the Hottest Spots in Town  With one Tipsy membership, you get Free Drinks, Front of the Line Passes and No Cover Charge entry to the hottest bars, clubs, lounges and pubs.   This could be confusing for the reader; what about their friends? What areas is Tipsy available in? This is what people are wondering about right now, you need to address that.  Block #3  Tipsy is a culture, cool. But I still don't know what regions you're available in - I only figured it out because I started digging in the nav bar. People on mobile aren't going to care enough to dig in to your site to figure out where Tipsy events are, y'know? The more work people have to do, the more they're not going to do business with you.  Block #4   The Ultimate VIP Experience = Users Love Us  With amazing membership benefits of complementary drinks, skip the line passes and no cover entry, Tipsy is your ultimate VIP app.   Users don't care that other users love you. They want to know the main benefit of what's going on with Tipsy that'll keep them moving down the page. Avoid using ""="" signs when trying to state your case.  The same could be said with your venues block at the bottom. You don't have a ""how it works"" block. Do you have to reserve a spot ahead of time? Do you show the bouncer your app? What if you lose your phone, will you lose your spot? How does Tipsy work?  At the very bottom of your page it just dead ends, there's no final call to action inviting me to try Tipsy for myself to see how it's going to revolutionize my nightlife or anything. It just falls off.  On this page you need to figure out who your primary target is. Is it patrons or is it businesses? You can have separate landing pages for each and direct them toward that so your messaging is tighter and makes more sense. You've focused on benefits here and you could pare them down a little bit, make room to explain the benefits of Tipsy AND the costs of Tipsy. Right now I don't know if it costs money or what. There are lots of unanswered questions here.  You can fix it OP!"

And you want to have a money-back guarantee. And to do all of this you need to sell your car?  The amount of risk you're taking is way too high for my blood. There are thousands of companies doing outsourced work. If you want to start an agency, go for it, but understand the market saturation. The money back guarantee I can't see working. This isn't like a candy bar delicious guarantee where if the candy bar isn't satisfactory you get your 99 cents back. This is giving back 10's of thousands of dollars and even worse, months and months of labor. Who cares when it's a candy bar, but actually work, I wouldn't go there. What happens when the startup fails (a likely scenario), and the company blames the product (a likely scenario)? They'll want their money back.  Lastly, don't sell you car if you need it to live. Maybe you don't if you commute via other means.  Honestly, I don't see anything wrong with starting a Digital Agency.

Charge less than you normally would to make small, simple projects to show your team's ability. Cold emailing can be very effective. It's easy to separate 'Indian Companies' from companies you'd want to work with.    You need to be able to target the right people and have the right message. For example, find an issue with an app/business, and suggest a solution. I would suggest 1-2 small changes in your email, and either leave it open ended or offer your services. This is costly, in terms of time, but can be very effective.    You will need to network. Networking is a give and take. Help others first and they will want to help you in return.  You're unlikely to find a good sales person who is willing to work only on commission (unless you get very lucky). Networking is the best way to build your sales team, but your main job for the first year (if not more) will be sales.     (PS. In the future, try to be more concise.)"

(Geez, I'm saying this 2 days in a row) Actually, I don't think anyone ever started big from scratch.   So, in your case, you're going to offer a service. That's great! Because you don't need much more than your skills and your time.    To validate your service idea, just find one company that will pay you. After you complete a project, make a landing page for your services, survey your first customer, research your other potential customers and use their feedback to improve your landing page and service.  Ask for referrals.  Rinse and repeat.     There are hundreds of offshore companies hunting for projects and thinking about being one of them discourages me.   So, what I'm seeing here is avoidance. You're avoiding doing the hard part—getting clients. And this is making you want to build something big which is probably just a way to make yourself feel secure. But that's false security.

""IT arrogance"" was about double with Turkish devs compared to people here, and didn't have much luck finding talented people anyhow.. I could argue, getting 3 developers for the price of 1 and still be positive, but didn't feel like it was worth it..  That being said, if you have access to good people and you have good project management skills, it could potentially be a viable business.   I don't see the need for selling the car though, where would you spend the money on? How would you find clients, and how would you convince them to choose you instead of in house? Price should never be a competitive advantage, neither the things you listed as ""Indian"" companies doing wrong.  Those are business 101 anyways. So you have to be able to define your selling point.

startups,3axltr,chebum,4,Wed Jun 24 08:59:48 2015 UTC,"First things first  I don't mean any bad but you're approaching this in a little odd way. You see, first you find a market and then you create the product. First, you find the problem and then you create a solution. Does this make sense to you? What you're doing here is you have first created a prototype that might have customers. Do not repeat this mistake again.  Okay, but let's focus on our current reality and situation. There are a couple ways you can interview more people.  1. Finding people offline  Where do these developers hang out? Physically, where they are? You gotta go where the fish are, the sea is not going to come to you.  Focus on them and their problems, rather than just ""pitching"" your idea. By doing this, you'll get free information from the right people without having to ask for it.   This:   ""the less I know the person, the less happy he is to speak with me""   speaks very loudly about your situation. You need to focus on them, rather than yourself. If you're showing how you just want to listen what struggles they are having   Is any developer struggling with this who you can:   call and ask for a coffee (you're not selling anything at this point)  go visit (offer free quick consultation or just talk face-to-face about the topic) write a letter to (yes, I'm serious)   2. Finding people online  Where do these developers (who are having the problem and want to get it solved) hangout online? Quora? Any other forums? What social sites?  Here are some quick tips:   Every time you find someone, ask after the interview: ""You know anyone else who might benefit from this?"" This way you're focusing in helping, not selling. And if you're talking to the right people they often know someone who they can refer. Approach people on these community sites and listen to them. Offer them the opportunity to test out your product (but talk about their problem and giving them an opportunity to solve it with your product)   The bottom line  After you have interviewed these people, you can say something along the lines of: ""If there was a product/thing that could solve that for you, would you be interest to try it out?"" If not, end of conversation. These people are not your customers.   But if they do want to hear more, offer them the opportunity to join a test group, or talk about customized product for them that they can try out for free/with a discount, and so on.  People are not interested in your product. They are interested in themselves. Learn to use this for your advantage.  Hope this helps and good luck!"

My general opinion is that videos are not a good idea.  Why not?   I A/B tested some videos and none of them did better than my previous text/image only landing pages. Videos are expensive. Unless you're large enough to have a significant marketing budget, you can almost certainly find better things to invest in. Videos are basically impossible to change. This means that once the video is made, there's no A/B testing, no pivoting, no tweaking your message, etc.   Number 3 is the most important thing to me. Getting a good landing page is all about iteration.  Of course, plenty of startups have videos on their landing pages so presumably it works well for some people."

I've done split tests with a lot of my clients with great results (I'm not just saying that). 2. This is correct, a good video is expensive, but I can't comment on what other options you or OP have to invest in. 3. You certainly can change videos, and have alternate versions (length / content / style / CTA) to split test.  Definitely easy to do with animated video."

Whiteboard explainer videos are a little long in the tooth, in my opinion, but there are lots of different styles for whatever budget.   There are a benefits of having a video on you website.  It's easier for visitors to watch a video than than read a bunch of text.   A well crafted video will deliver a lot of information in a very small amount of time both visually and audibly.  The music, tone, style, movement, and characters communicate something intangible immediately to the viewer.  There's nothing quite like it.   The reason why everyone has a video is because everyone visiting your site has broadband internet.  Videos show up in Google and Bing search results.  It's good SEO.  YouTube is the #2 largest search engine.  A video is an integral part of a overall online presence.   They are expensive because they take a lot of effort and expertise to make, but if you make them right, they will work and they will last.  Those are my thoughts.  :)"

Not because of the money that you'll spend on a really good one, but because you can send the wrong message. Video editing is costly.   On the other hand text costs nothing to edit... I'm not saying that you shouldn't use video at all, even though chances that people would watch the entire thing aren't high.   The human attention span is about 8 seconds. In these 8 seconds, you've got to capture your visitor's attention and make them stay and read more. With a video, you're asking people to invest something like 1 or 2 minutes of their time to watch it.    But why should they? What is their motivation?   That's what the copy around the video should do—to convince people to stay and read more or watch a video.    And if you think you've already got the copy, think again (unless you've got experience with that). I see startup owners struggling with copywriting every single day.

When you get to a version of your copy that actually converts visitors into email signups, then I'd advise you to work on that video.   So, that being said, here's how to go about creating the landing page copy for your beta landing page:   Headline   The purpose of the headline is to make people read more of the text on the page.  Since your visitors only care about their issues and desires, your headline, as well as your entire landing page should not be about your product.  Your best bet for a headline is to tell your visitors in 2–5 seconds what benefit they are going to get or what they can do with the software, and why this is important to them.  This is what the headline should do.   Subheadline   The purpose of the subheadline is to reinforce the message from the headline and clarify it.  If there are unclear terms in the headline, the subheadline should expand and explain what they mean exactly.  A great example of headline + subheadline on a beta landing page: http://sansmagi.cc/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HotJar.jpg   Create an exclusive club   Something that a lot of beta landing pages try to do and fail. People like having exclusive access to things they want. Nobody actually wants to ""start a free trial"" of any app. People only care about solving their own problems and satisfying their desires.   The simplest thing to do would be to copy what HotJar did:    Mention that “Access to closed beta is by invitation only”. Use text like “Request free early access” for your button. Create a queue like HotJar did and make your future users wait to be allowed to access the app.   By the way, exclusivity is what HotJar used to go viral.    Add an incentive   Give something away if you want to get something in return (e.g. an email).  HotJar were giving away free invites.  That’s not a real thing. They could let all of their users in (probably), but limiting the availability of the service allows them to give away invites and make you feel like you’re getting something in return for your email.   Use urgency   Urgency tells the visitor why they should take action now.  Often urgency comes as some sort of time limitation.  Like limiting the free invites giveaway for a strict period of time.   Use scarcity   Research has proven over and over again (my experience as well) that limited supply of a resource makes it more desirable.  For example, you can motivate people to sign up by telling them that you’re giving away a limited amount of invites for your private beta.  When you do all this, you will get email signups without a whiteboard video. :)  Advice taken from here & from a future post about viral beta landing pages that I'm going to publish this week.   TL;DR:Human attention span is very small these days (8 secs). What can you tell them in 8 seconds that's going to make them stay and read more? You can't use a video for that purpose. Only text will work. That's why my advice is to work on your copy first and then invest in an explainer video. You can actually persuade people to give you an email with the old tricks listed about. You don't even need a fancy video."

startups,3awq49,thinglistr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:56:23 2015 UTC,"A huge part of this depends on how likely you are to get funds and how good the product is. If you're begging people to join, you'll have to give up a big chunk of equity. Assuming a solid product that does get funded and that you've done all the work up to this point (smart move IMO), I would say 10-15% for each co-founder would be fair, before you get diluted by outside investors.   In terms of HOW you do it, stock options with a cliff (e.g. 12 months, 18 months, 24 months so they get their shares in stages) are your friend here. You want to check your hires out first to see if you can work with them - even friends. I got burned hiring a friend who turned out to be useless, so be careful. Luckily I had vesting in place.

startups,3avd3m,Drop_,0,Tue Jun 23 23:24:49 2015 UTC,"1) This is a really cool idea.    2) I find the front page copy a little off putting and disingenuous.    3) Signing up:  For some reason the form looks cheap to me.  It seems like the fields are too big.  Page 2/3 should have more degree options.  It isn't clear to me what someone with an MBA or JD should choose.  Or both.  How much ""work experience"" you have is a weird question.  What do you count?  Relevant work experience?  All work in your life?  Part time?  Work in your intended field or degree?  Maybe specify something there.  How much work experience in your field of study, or in your prospective field might be better.  Your industry selections are somewhat restrictive.  I know you can't just have infinite tick boxes, but even off the top of my head you're missing some major industries/fields of work.    4) If you log out on the third page (during the survey thing) it doesn't let you complete your profile when logging back in (works fine if you exit on the 2nd page).    5) Not totally convinced on the value of Zyn credits.  Have to click a button to see what they're about.   6) A little skeptical about the ultimate setup of the site.  Rather than being ""collaborative"" between employers and job seekers it seems to me that it's mostly crowdsourcing granular company ratings and matching the ratings to individuals, it might be work but I suppose I expected more collaboration between your site and the employers (I expected an employer portal of sorts).  I think this will hold you back to some degree.  a) employers might not want to be defined by former employees as places to work, particularly potentially anonymously, and b) it may inhibit your ability to have a robust list of places to work, particularly for smaller companies.    I think you should work on your site more before trying more PR, personally.  It's a really good idea, but the execution needs to be much better in today's online world."

startups,3avd3m,gekorm,0,Tue Jun 23 23:22:56 2015 UTC,"Basically, we match people to companies based on how their priorities/personality matches corporate culture   Does your site say this?  Your site overwhelms me with text. I have no idea what you do unless I stop and read everything, and even then I'm a bit confused. I'd cut out the fluff and cut to the chase. I can't even figure out why I should use your service. Be clear cut why you're different. Eg: ""We match you to a career based on your personality."" Say that if you do that. People have limited attention spans.  Your testimonials sound fake. Are they real? Eg: ""Zyn Careers has the potential to disrupt the entire job searching industry. - Margaret S.""  The amount of centered text on your website is an eye sore. Submit your site to a design feedback subreddit and get help cleaning it up. Hire a designer or study great designed websites and mimic them.  Lastly, show me your product. I don't see a single screenshot. Personally I never sign up for anything if I don't see the product first. Also, don't require a login to use a single feature of your product. Require a login to use all the features. But get people in the door and see some magic before they fork over an email address.  p.s. Even after logging in I find this confusing. I'm greeted with a dashboard and a skewed reddit logo. I scolled up and down looking for a ""jobs"" button or something. So again, I have to stop and read (which means it's not obvious). Why is the career finder button a brushstroke with a 93 in it? You need to study ""call to action"" buttons. It should be incredibly idiot proof where I click to get the product. And once I'm logged in, I should be greeted with the product asap."

startups,3avaez,mr-aaron-gray,2,Tue Jun 23 23:01:54 2015 UTC,"If you are going into business with partners, its really best to go a formal route. When you say ""DBA"" I assume you mean ""without starting an LLC or other entity."" If so, that is a general partnership. As a general partnership, all of your personal assets are subject to the liabilities of the business. You also need to prepare for how you will resolve disputes. For example, let's say your business goes big and you need to divvy up a million dollars between the partners. You should decide now how that will look and why it's fair. You would each be taxed for your share of the profits (or losses).   Regardless of how you arrange your entity, you will technically need a business license from your state, county, city, or all of the above.  You can often reserve a name with your secretary of state. If you are wanting to protect your brand, that is a trademark issue. You can register a trademark with your state, federally, or rely on a ""common law"" trademark--meaning once you use an original mark in commerce, you have an exclusive right to that mark.  What does your business actually do. IMO, a podcast is not a business. It's more like a marketing tool for a business. If you are just hoping to build an audience, you may consider just starting the podcast and then formalizing everything once you actually launch a product.

Pros: I think forming an LLC and carefully drafting an operating agreement would really help you and the others in your venture understand the relationship, obligations, and potential benefits. I can also see how using one bank account would be useful administratively.   Cons: If you don't start making money with the podcast, you will just be adding administrative expenses which will have to be divided between everyone. So it can be a downer if you have to pay your annual registration fees and its just more money out the window.   Since you all have put in some considerable time, to me it sounds like you're at a good point to really formalize the relationships and decide what you're going to do moving forward, so I think the pros outweigh the cons.

(People who want me to sign an NDA to tell me the simplest idea.)  To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.  Explanation:   AWFUL IDEA  = -1 WEAK IDEA = 1 SO-SO IDEA    = 5 GOOD IDEA = 10 GREAT IDEA    = 15 BRILLIANT IDEA    = 20      NO EXECUTION    = $1 WEAK EXECUTION    = $1000 SO-SO EXECUTION   = $10,000 GOOD EXECUTION    = $100,000 GREAT EXECUTION   = $1,000,000 BRILLIANT EXECUTION   = $10,000,000   To make a business, you need to multiply the two.  The most brilliant idea, with no execution, is worth $20. The most brilliant idea takes great execution to be worth $20,000,000.  That's why I don't want to hear people's ideas.

startups,3aupv3,suineg,2,Tue Jun 23 17:40:34 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a great idea and it looks like you're on the right track based on your plan. All that I'd suggest is to prototype and build your product asap. If you're serious about creating a viable business for yourself I would not suggest that you set your sights on investors (If by that you mean selling equity and not taking out a loan). This type of funding should be your last resort after taking out loans. I assume that you already have the appropriate industry connections (a software, hardware, and business guy). Just build the product prototype and do your best to develop a distribution network. The reason I'm not to fond of investors is because ALOT of money can be lost following this path. If you're set on taking capital for a reasonably large share of your company I'd genuinely like to hear your reasoning behind this decision. Best of luck!"
startups,3aupv3,Insanity_-_Wolf,2,Tue Jun 23 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"Right now the reason is because we have no capital.   I work for the government and was over in Germany, got cancer and paid a lot of cash out there and then moved back here to get treatment. Six months of leave without pay and I am in full remission but my cash flow is diminished greatly. I still have great credit, a high paying job, and very low debt. I just don't have the resources it would take to most likely get a loan in the amount that I would need.   I am fine with selling equity because  I am in this to get the product made and not to make a billion dollars. I think I can still sell off quite a bit of equity yet still have a nice return on an exit. I think the timing of the market and the future of IoT is requiring me to come to market sooner rather than later or miss the boat entirely. While that will be sad for me at least the product I want made will come out."
startups,3aupv3,Insanity_-_Wolf,2,Tue Jun 23 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"In your case it would make sense I suppose. It's just that many firms look for already established companies with a product(prefferably atleast). And for those that do not yet meet their prefferences they are much more likely to offer a much smaller injection for more equity. In my opinion it's best to keep overhead as low as possible. Keep costs low while making the product and isolating on a good manufacturer. Are you planning to pay your employees in equity, salary, or both? If you're planning on scaling as quickly as possible then you'll need investment either way. It's just a matter of prefference I suppose. Low cost and longer timeline = highest possible return for you or investment capital and shorter timeline = variable return based on how much equity you retain. Keep in mind that the more equity you give away, the less and less control you have over your company. A very common mistake is to see the large number and sign the dotted line. Not very fun leaving, what is basically a product of your own blood sweat and tears with a 5% stake. Ownership is power and that is usually very much worth fighting for. Not saying that it can't be done in moderation, just that it can be easy to get carried away. Btw congragulations on the remission!"

startups,3aupv3,cr0wmium,3,Tue Jun 23 19:31:49 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume you're joking. Based on your post history you have some pretty good general advice, so yeah, gotta be joking, right?  To the OP: Please, please, please never do this. There is no glory here, instinct will take you nowhere near as far as just collecting and understanding data. If you ignore the data you will fail, if you don't collect the data you will fail.   Good entrepreneurs analyze. They do not over analyze because there is no such thing. Trust your gut sometimes, trust the numbers always."
startups,3aupv3,hootener,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:52:31 2015 UTC,"I never said ignore the data. You misread my advice. You tell OP not to do this. Do what? In the world, you either are in the pool or you are not. There is no middle ground. The same applies to entrepreneurship. This startup world is becoming convoluted and inundated with people who inherently aren't risk takers. That is being an entrepreneur - risking, and still standing up after all is said and done.   ""When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it."" - Henry Ford  If you are questioning whether you should be an entrepreneur or not, then you aren't really cut out for it in the first place. My advice had nothing to do with data, it had to do with deciding to plunge into entrepreneurship, and based on his post, he needs the push to make it happen.   Edit: also, I said ""over analyze"" because I do believe there is such a thing. ""This feature should be added, what about contacting those reporters, how do we arrange the cap table for our next round when we raise it so as to not structure a full-takeover from the VC we might inevitably have given our MAU counts are accurate and the business model addresses the shift in market control...yada yada yada"". That is over analyzing a situation. Entrepreneurs SHOULDN'T over-analyze because the initial analysis is enough to make the jump. Anyone who doesn't think there is a majority of luck in entrepreneurship is foolish."
startups,3aupv3,cr0wmium,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:33:14 2015 UTC,"I never said ignore the data.   In my defense you never said look at it, either. Which gets at the heart of the matter. There's a lot more to becoming an entrepreneur than just jumping in. You obviously know that, but it took you three paragraphs of context in your reply to make it clear to me that that wasn't the advice you were specifically giving.  In light of the rest of what you say, of course you aren't wrong. There is inherent risk in entrepreneurship. But all risks should be calculated before being taken. An uncalculated risk isn't a risk, it's simply a mistake.   Taken without context, this advice:   Entrepreneurs shouldn't over analyze; we live day to day taking leaps and hoping we stick the landing.   sounds a lot more like a leap of faith than a calculated risk to me. And leaps of faith are something OP should strive specifically to avoid. So that's where my reply was coming from. A leap of faith is the this I'm referring to when I say:   Please, please, please never do this.   I get it, though, you know what you're doing. I also apologize for misinterpreting you, but more importantly, has the OP misinterpreted you? I agree with you to an extent, but understand that this guy is looking for advice, so generic platitudes like:   we live day to day taking leaps and hoping we stick the landing.   Could perhaps be wildly misinterpreted. Maybe that's just me, though."

startups,3aupv3,scttrvl,2,Tue Jun 23 19:52:35 2015 UTC,"Hey suineg,  Thanks for posting! I think your idea sounds cool. :)  I will say, however, that the best thing you can do is go talk to a group of your potential customers as soon as possible, before you do anything else. Get their feedback, and then make adjustments to the product, and then go get more feedback. I would suggest doing that at least 3 times before you build anything else at all.   It sounds like you have all the people around you and the contacts you need to get the actual thing done, and the passion to go talk to investors and get this product done, but your idea needs more feedback and iteration.   No product survives its first contact with customers.   So before you invest any more time, effort, or money into your idea go validate it with customers.    Offer them a $5 gift card to somewhere and get 30 minutes of their time to talk about the problems you are trying to solve with your product, and make sure your product solves those problems for those people. Ask them about your solution.  Ask them if they would pay for it. If they will, find out how much. If not, find out why and then iterate on the product (or even ask them what you could change to make it something they would pay for)   You can find out a ton about what your customer needs before you ever even spend time and money on the deck, product, software, business plan, time off work to go to investor meetings, etc. if you go do this exercise.  It will change your world!  Also, on a more personal note, you have what it takes! Learn whatever skills you need to make it happen. We all started out not having the experience we needed to make our startups successful and then we picked it up as we went along. Go for it!"
startups,3aupv3,cdiems8,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:44:31 2015 UTC,I have done most of this except for beta testing of the software.   I am a motorcycle rider myself and hang out with quite a few.

startups,3aupv3,cdiems8,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:50:33 2015 UTC,"Asking your potential customers if they WOULD buy something is different from actually exchanging money for your thing. So here's my suggestion:   Ask them to pre-order it. Tell them you're glad they have an interest, but you need the money in order to actually build it. If they don't place a pre-order (some actually will) then find a way for them to pay to use your prototype. Or provide the value that you're selling in some other way. This is sometimes known as a ""concierge experiment."" Find a way to provide the value without having the product developed.   If they say no to both of these things, ask them why not. This will help you find out the things that you're missing that people won't tell you if you just ask if they would pay."

startups,3auah5,n1ckra,3,Tue Jun 23 15:49:33 2015 UTC,"When people come to your site they just see a list of kickstarters, no information about what you guys are about. No cool tagline up at the top that spells out what pledgeworthy is. Your ""about"", ""faq"" and ""help"" pages are hidden in the bottom. If I'm coming in here blind I don't even know what's going on and I'm going to bounce right back out.  Maybe you need a landing page that explains how things work? The purpose of the whole thing? Users shouldn't ever have to work to find out what they've stumbled on to, y'know?   Then all of your reviews on the front page look like they're by you, so that's kind of a problem trust-wise. That makes me think this is leaning more towards an extortion racket for creators running kickstarter campaigns than it is geared towards helping users.  No offense but you don't need a logo, you don't need to get press coverage (honestly what are they going to cover right now?), you need to get people in there to write reviews. People who have actually participated in that kickstarter.   Just having a spare bulb swinging in a basement isn't going to attract a lot of users (not the kind you want, anyway); you need to establish yourself, how it works, what the benefits to joining up and sharing reviews are.

startups,3ax9wk,crazy_idea,3,Wed Jun 24 06:17:11 2015 UTC,"It looks to me like this idea could use some validation. You shouldn't ask yourself and answer ""absolutely"" to yourself. You should ask other people.  My two cents: I love wine but I never drink it alone, so I absolutely don't care what kind of music plays while I'm drinking it, as long as it doesn't interfere with conversation."
startups,3ax9wk,Lara_the_dev,3,Wed Jun 24 07:02:23 2015 UTC,"Start note: this might sound harsh, don't take it personally.  So you found an idea that could be worked with, that's a nice step, but you are far from having value. I'll start off with the product and after that with the landing page.  Product  So you got something that might catch on as wine is drank more and more. I believe in the concept that music can make any experience better and especially wine which people drink mainly in company. Your target audience seems like people who either drink alone or in groups, as long as they are at home where they can control the music. If that sounds like a big enough target audience to you than you have a possible valuable idea. The thing is that you barely have anything on your site yet. I can only find three wines/tracks that are combined. If I have anything else that I want to request I have to wait for you to reply to my e-mail I guess?  Why not create an actual (web)app where you can create a big database of playlists (not single songs) that go along very well with certain wines. Not everyone likes the same kind of music, so give them some options that they can choose from. Get a sommelier as soon as possible to start making this, but also try to form a community of wine/music lovers who can come with their own suggestions. That way you won't have to do every single bit of work and you get involvement. Main thing is to make things automatic instead of having to wait for your e-mail to come back. Let them fill in their current mood and what wine they might have available (or suggest one) and then give them the music possibilities.   But that's just my two sense on that.   (forgot about dinner time, I'll edit this in about an hour for feedback on the landing page)  The edit  Landing Page  At first sight this doesn't seem that bad, but when I looked closely I thought it was pretty dreadful. I get that you try to make a picture and text line for every viewing page, but the ""contact us"" button is too far too the middle so it overlapse the text (a standard 15"" Google Chrome user). The title is not really catchy, you basically say the same thing twice, just the oter way around. Your tagline should say something about your title, not just make it more elaborate. With a headline like that use something like: ""Music that makes your tastebuds go berserk"". It's not a great tagline, but I hope you get what I mean. (Sorry if I use the word tagline wrong, not a native and couldn't think a better word for it soz )   I wanted to explain more about your landing page, but I guess you can get more from it from Terpin who is a professional copywriter and does a weekly free commentary thread.

Stop thinking your idea is going to change the world. Executing your idea possible could change the world and make you billions. But your idea alone won't. It will take a ton of work.  You have no idea that anyone even thinks your idea is worth anything. You need to get it out there and get feedback. Look into the Lean Startup Method. Look at the Ikea problem. Figure out who will pay you for this idea and then don't do ANYTHING ELSE until you call, with a phone and talk to 10 potential customers. Ask them to buy the product. Say it can be ready in 6 months etc.  Good luck."

Check out the front page and compare it with ours, and you'll see what I'm talking about.  This sub also has posting restrictions, which really helps keep bullshit content to a minimum.

startups,3at79a,PerkyPangolin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:40:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) For now we are relying on in flight wifi, and the pre flight access (which could be months in advance of the flight anyways).  We have Multipeer connectivity / bluetooth on the phase 2 list, like FireChat and Jott, but not at this time. A lot of people have mentioned it today though over on producthunt and twitter, so will definitely be increasing its priority."
startups,3at79a,korkboard,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:21:53 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is a really cool one, but I think making the app such that it works without being reliant on in-flight wifi is what takes it from being something that is kinda cool to something that is usable enough to be a powerful way for people to connect in a new and interesting way.  I'm not a copywriter, and I'm sure there are others who may disagree with me, but I would say that your site is somewhat annoyingly vertical. I would look to see how you can revamp your site to have a more interconnected site map that will help with some of the feeling that I'm just endlessly scrolling through it. This is something we're actually working to do right now with our site. Also, this improves SEO!  On a totally different note, I think it would be cool to later introduce a feature where you can start a game of tic-tac-toe or something simple like that with another user on your flight. Small quirky feature but I think it could be quite valuable and it shouldn't be too difficult to implement."
startups,3aubnb,leet24,3,Tue Jun 23 15:58:54 2015 UTC,"It's a hard business bc it's an incredible saturated market.  If you want to compete with PostMates and GrubHub type companies, you'd be wise to have a background in food delivery, which if you did you wouldn't need to ask these questions.  If it was me though, I'd be researching the market. Who is doing this? How did they get started? How did they fail (if they did)? Did they pivot, and why?  There's just so many people in this space that it's impossible to list them all. Make sure your idea is different and solves a key issue that others have not. It would be a big shame if you spent years building this service, and all PostMates has to do is add one feature to their service and it takes you out."
startups,3aubnb,roodleguy,3,Tue Jun 23 19:53:23 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. The market is really saturated. Caviar. Munchery. Postmates. Peachd. Lish. Bitesquad. Eat24. GrubHub. Yada yada yada.   With few exceptions most of the food delivery startups aren't generating profits they are just acquiring customers and building relationships while burning through their funding.  And outside of the U.S. there is a lot of consolidation going on. Rocket Internet seems acquire a new delivery service each month. Last I heard they had Delivery Hero, Foodpanda, FoodPanda,  JUST EAT, , Food Runner’s, City Deliver,  EatOye , Koziness,  and Food By Phone, La Nevera Roja,  Pizzabo, Hello Fresh, etc.  So not only are you competing in a low margin, saturated market and fighting against behemoths with huge cash stockpiles, because of current litigation you must considering the possibility that you will no longer be able to rely on the independent contractor model. So now you might be dealing with having employees do your deliveries, which adds a whole new layer of complexity to the business.  So unless you have a revolutionary idea or you plan to service a market that's not appealing to mayor players you are gonna have a bad time."
startups,3aubnb,ihaditsoeasy,2,Tue Jun 23 21:15:00 2015 UTC,"It is important to note the differences in workflow/approach between GrubHub and Postmates.  How they engage consumers, how they work with the restaurants, how the money flows, etc etc.  They are vastly different.  That said, they all focus on the consumer first. Another key trait that could lead to innovation in the space."
startups,3aubnb,GaryARefuge,2,Tue Jun 23 21:26:09 2015 UTC,A lot of the businesses you want to deliver to have corporate relationships with GrubHub and the bigger local companies (LABite for example).  They have a lot of tools in place to help with accounting and ordering per department.   If the businesses aren't using said companies to do the delivery they are usually working directly with the restaurant to get their meetings/events catered and the restaurant is using their own delivery drivers or outsourcing it.  This is a tough thing to do if you're looking to deliver for any restaurant to businesses because it is being handled already by a multitude of others.  You need to figure out who your primary client is:the restaurant or the businesses. I think then the next step is to figure out how to approach things in a better/new way to give them more valuable benefit by using you.  The trick is to do this while giving some benefit to the other party at the same time.   Good luck.
startups,3aubnb,GaryARefuge,2,Tue Jun 23 21:24:13 2015 UTC,"I did try running a business for a year with food stocked to sell in offices in a refrigerator along with a wholesaler.  All the other points brought up are valid, super competitive business, if you produce and/or deliver there are scaling problems. If you do only a marketplace there are issues with margin and winning user engagement.  Assuming you're thinking of fresh food delivery, its a combination of two very operationally intensive and time sensitive businesses - food production and delivery. In other words if you have a 90% success rate for operations in both of them, together they will succeed 81%.   That means only 4 out of every 5 orders will make it through production and delivery!  This is a gross simplification, but moving that success rate higher is hard, day in day out. You could try taking on only one of them, but you will still have a dependency on the other. Think of the labor pool you're using for this, there's high turnover, you'll be retraining staff as you hire them. Plus you need contingency to cover ""failed"" orders.  Lastly what you eat for food at work is a very discretionary decision, so your service has to win a user every time that decision is made.  Feel free to PM me for more advice if you'd like."

To help it get there, the San Francisco startup raised $80 million in a round of funding led by Tiger Global Management, said Chief Executive Bastian Lehmann. The investment values the four-year-old company at more than $400 million, he said.  Postmates expects total revenue from the fees of nearly $100 million this year, Lehmann said.

startups,3aqvbf,QuackWare,5,Mon Jun 22 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"Based on your description, I think your app sounds pretty neat. That's about all the validation I can give.  Instead, I want to share with you how I validate products. Many of mine die extremely early into stage 1, but that's what you want to happen. The faster they die, the better.   Disclaimer  The following advice is how to grow/develop a product slowly. Based on my experience it results in much less heartache than just throwing something out there to the masses. Others may tell you differently, perhaps that's a debate for another day.   This approach is all about controlling the input of feedback and the output of features in a sustainable way. I'm giving you this advice because I'm assuming this is a hobby project for you and you can't really dedicate 12 - 16 hours of your day to this thing.  This approach also allows you to suss out fundamental problems (i.e., those potentially related to product/market fit) without wasting a bunch of time and money. If a sampling of 30 diverse people can't find anything good to say about your product, odds are 3000 won't either.  Advice:  Stage 1 - Product  Have you spoken to close friends about this tool? I think the next logical step is opening the valve a bit, but not the floodgates.  I'd recommend a really small portion of friends and family. Between 5 and 10. Try to target friends with interests or usage patterns that are really diverse when compared with yours. This will give you a varied, but small, data set that you can use to improve your product.  The benefit of reaching out to friends and family is that they'll likely be much more patient and willing to provide feedback than strangers on the Internet.  Give your friends and family test period at least 8 weeks. You really want enough time to iterate on feedback, improve, and see how usage looks with this small subset of people.  Operating at this scale will teach you a lot about your product, what's missing, what's ''fluff'', and what people may really engage with. You'll learn more from your first outside user than your 100th. Don't forget that and choose your initial users wisely! Don't choose people that will simply agree with you because they want you to be successful, but those that actually stand to benefit from your product and will give you real, honest feedback.  Somewhere in this stage you probably want to define key performance metrics. Things you can measure that will tell you if you're app's actually any good. Is it avg session length? user count? something else? You don't need to obsessively measure them now, you're still making the product good, but they'll come into play in Stage 2.  Stage 2 - Simulated Growth  If that goes well, consider casting a wider net. Maybe you reach out to a subreddit that you think will like it, a sampling of facebook friends, whatever.  The idea is you want a little more separation between your users and yourself, but not so much separation that at least some portion of them won't give you feedback. The whole idea with this step is learning about what it's like to be not fully aware as to who is interact with your app and how on an individual level. You'll have to learn how to do things like tracking and monitoring usage, understanding behaviors in the aggregate, and triaging what to fix, what to build, and what to ignore. If you think this product may have legs as a legitimate software business, it is vitally import that you learn how to do this kind development, because as the product grows the signal of ""what to do next"" gets noisier and noisier.   Obsessively track your key performance metrics. Even with a small subset, be very diligent about measuring them and being absolutely certain that they're actually indicators that your app is ""good"". Don't lie to yourself. If the numbers don't bear out correctly for you, they won't for anyone else, either.  Stage 3 - Limited Release  Honestly you may never get here for many reasons, some of which have nothing to do with your product.  But if you've hit 50 - 100 people and you're seeing some promising numbers in key performance metrics, it's time to consider opening things up. You may still want to do an invite only beta, but you'll definitely want to pull in people that you don't know at all.   This is the point where you attempt to grow your key performance metrics as highly as possible, and really push yourself as much as you can. What you're hoping to see is that those metrics you defined in step one, and saw some increase in in step 2, continue to climb here. Maybe they will, maybe they won't, but your goal is to push those metrics and continue learning from your users.   Bring on users, onboard as many as you can. Look at churn, look at your metrics, and get all that data together. If things continue trending upward, you may have something great on your hands..."

It might not be a bad place, but you might have more luck in /r/battlestations to view others and /r/AskBattlestations for questions   Curious to know what type of desk, chair or other amenities you use to increase comfort and productivity while you work?   Everyone is different, you need to try things yourself.  Personally I would invest in a good chair, not anything from Office Depot or the like.  Go to a high end shop and try their chairs from Herman Miller / Steelcase etc.  That $200 chair from OD might seem nice at first, but they wear out quick for someone like me 6'1"" ~200lb.  Also consider getting a sit/stand desk for health reasons.  Sitting all day has negative effects, as does standing all day.  Mixing it up is the key.  Bonus if you get a walking sit/stand desk.  The healthier you are the more productive you will be in the long run.  I had a custom cherry desk/bookcases made for my home office and it looks beautiful but it doesn't budge.  I'm looking at Varidesks so I can stand and get a walking treadmill underneath.  Right now I just take my laptop and go stand somewhere else for a while, but I'd rather have all 3 monitors accessible.  http://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/2dmwz5/from_shittybattlestations_to_battlestations/ is my current setup, but again, pick what works for you :)"

Much of this you can do with the API, or at least suss out a platform to do it easily.

Automatically send a follow up email if no message is received after X amount of days and move status in our CRM to hot/cold/whatever you need it to be Create a contact from a email received automatically and set to a CRM pipeline   Those are a few of the automations we're creating.

startups,3aqqeq,PvtUnternehmer,5,Mon Jun 22 19:10:47 2015 UTC,"A model I've live by is what can you remove to make it ready, not what can you add to make it perfect.   When you sit down and create a list of everything you'd want to see if this was a perfect world, you should then strikethrough everything that is too tedious, time consuming, or difficult to scale. That product is your v1.0, in my opinion.   To get to your MVP, scale that down to something you can release quickly and market readily; too many people create a complex MVP (though it is still an MVP by terms) that is then difficult to market.   Name most of the huge $BB services today and they started as a barebones, feature-minimal version of what they are today; the MVP is the step before that version where it WORKS, but obviously needs improvement. Plus, when you hit on that product, you can incorporate user feedback and customer validation into the story."
startups,3aqqeq,cr0wmium,3,Mon Jun 22 20:28:46 2015 UTC,"Another way to think about this is, what is the smallest thing I can build and launch that delivers the smallest meaningful unit of value to a customer/user.  For example, if you were building an company that delivered groceries from the grocery store to your house, an MVP could be simply a phone number that people could text when they want groceries, and then you would manually go pick them up. Once you show that that works, then invest more time/money to making an app/website/company/rocket-ship. You'll already have users too :)"

startups,3aqqeq,TrainedMonkey7,2,Tue Jun 23 18:23:04 2015 UTC,Let me coin a new term: MVV - minimum viable validation.  It is possible to create a homepage with a NON-EXISTENT product. Validate that you have customers with an email box. (It's cheating you say! It's actually ingenious)... You first GET customers. And then develop the product skipping the MVP entirely. Afterall you'll create what the customers wants.  Sorry for the short spitball post. But I hope this brings up some thoughts! Good luck.  EDIT: Awesome startup idea btw. I don't think it would be easy to sell. Consider looking @ NY. New yorkers make bank but don't have time for things like shopping. Just an idea.
startups,3aqqeq,TheFilmGod,2,Tue Jun 23 03:12:46 2015 UTC,"I like to frame it as a job story in the Jobs To Be Done Framework. So for example you create a simple job story:  When I ______ I want to ______ so I can ______.  If someone pays for your product or service they are hiring it to fulfill a job. If I'm starving, but late to work, I need to find a place that I can hire to fulfill a job for me.  The MVP simply needs to do enough to get hired for that job.  So for example say I think job searching is broken. You go to a job search site and while you can narrow some criteria down, there isn't enough to help you find the exact job you are looking for. You can go through headhunters, but their interests lie in finding you any job so they bug you daily with job options that you don't care about.  I just want a place that finds me the right jobs that fit my exact criteria. So in this case you might think that you need to setup a site that has a search engine that does a lot of fancy shit. You'll also want to allow people to register and save their favorites jobs and maybe even the status of each job (interviewed, resume sent). Oh, you'll also want to keep resumes and cover letters on file for easy access.  That doesn't look like a lot of stuff, but it can pile on quickly.  Instead let's look at the job to be done.  When I am searching for a job I want to be able to get the jobs that perfectly fit my criteria so I don't waste my time.  So if that's the job I can setup a simple site with a form that you just have to enter your email and all the criteria for the job you want. The next day I send you a curated list done by a human with the 5 jobs that I found that exactly fit your criteria. All you had to do was fill out a form and all I had to do was create a page with a form.  If you want more jobs I can tell you it is $20 for 10 more jobs and send you an invoice. Enough people pay for that then I know I'm on to something and can start to build out the bigger website.  With subscription box services though there really is no MVP. You understand what the business is so now you're just seeing if people will pay for a subscription or not. I guess the MVP would be not going too crazy with a website, but there are services like Cratejoy that make it hella easy to do these websites."
startups,3aqqeq,MrAlmostWrong,2,Tue Jun 23 06:55:47 2015 UTC,"MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product.  Think in terms of software. If you are building an Uber clone, you need the app to find your location, and send you a cab/ride. You should have user management, etc, but that can wait.

startups,3aqqeq,amosschorr,2,Mon Jun 22 19:43:45 2015 UTC,it doesn't really have to be a quality product. It just has to be good enough to faithfully show what your product actually does.
startups,3aqqeq,HelloYesThisIsDuck,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:15:19 2015 UTC,"It's easier to apply to things like software, which can be easily upgraded, or services.  If you want to open a daycare, you could, for instance, start babysitting for one neighbour, then get another, then another, and once you earned enough to rent a proper building, you rent it.  The MVP is you babysit 1-3 kids, before you can offer the full service (babysitting + the location + toys / food, etc.)  In your case, MVP is less applicable, but if you look at another box that was posted here recently, the bachelor's box, they seem to be printing boxes with their logo. Of course, it's more elegant and you could say that it's the core of the concept, but you could also say ""It's an MVP, let's see if there's any interest"" and ship a couple of ties in an envelope, or a garbage bag.  Those are silly and kind of extreme examples, but I hope you get the idea.  As for what your MVP could be, you'll have to come up with that on your own; just remember you don't necessarily need an MVP for every business. In fact, in yours, unless you want to customize your packaging, an MVP does not really apply, unless you started with only one pack and expanded the selection later on, but having more options from the get-go might bring you more sales."
startups,3aqqeq,sansmagic,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:51:52 2015 UTC,"Like /u/cr0wmium pointed out, an MVP is the barebones thing that you can ship.   To get to the MVP, you just need to think in terms of the problem. Every (successful) product exists around some kind of a painful problem.   What is the minimal set of features that solves your customer's problem? Focus on this. This is your MVP. Everything else is optional.   Step 1: Minimize your promise  Looking at your website, you have quite a promise there:   We have pre-built boxes for some of your favorite themes.  Want to throw a Luau? A Frat Party? A Kentucky Derby Bash?  Simply choose your theme,  choose any add-ons you'd like,  then open your box and call everyone over!   Why not focus on one type of parties at the beginning?    Every box comes with enough theme-relevant foods and snacks, costumes, cleanup supplies, and party supplies for 20 people, and a guide on how to throw the most bad-ass party ever!   Do you really need to offer all of these? If you could choose just one of these things to put in the box, what would it be?    Instead of going around and hunting down supplies, wondering if you have enough snacks for everyone, and stressing about clean-up, we allow you to order a box with everything you need and focus on actually having fun!   I can see at least 3 problems being tackled here:    hunting for supplies stressing about clean-up getting snacks   What's the most important of these? Just choose one and focus on solving it.   Step 2: Launch  Once you choose a small enough MVP, you can proceed to launch:   This is the kind of service that you can ""launch"" to friends first. Offer to help a friend, see what they like, what they complain about, i.e. gather beta testers, analyze feedback. Also, this is how you will get word-of-mouth around town.   Think small. Start small. What's the smallest thing that you can do right now?   You don't start a full-fledged business from scratch. Like with software, your best bet is to iterate. That's the reasoning behind the lean methodology.   Hope this helps."

If your looking for anything more than brand awareness than social platforms may not be your best bet. Statistically speaking conversion rates from social media to sales or signups are low. How low? Less than 1/100 of 1%. That being said, putting in the effort to build a targeted community on these platforms can be beneficial for brand awareness. Seeing that you are a startup, it's better to try to get noticed through search. You want the traffic that comes to your site to be ""pulled"" rather than ""pushed"". How can I pull my customers to my site? Well, through inbound marketing. Build a 4-5 month content marketing plan and execute on it. Write 2-3 articles a day that are relevant to your user base. At the 4 month mark you should see a large spike in site visits and conversions as your site will be ranking on search engines."

I am 35 years old and the oldest person in the startup I work for. The owner of this startup is 5 years younger than I and has made tens of millions already in life. Age has nothing to do with the measure of someone's success or ability to succeed.   Is it proper to say up front that I'm only interested in working ~40 hours?   Yes, but know that they might choose another candidate over you if you drive that point home deep enough, especially if you are salaried. Startups need people to be all-in when necessary, even if that means working a 12 hour day to meet a deadline. Almost all salaried positions should operate in this fashion, because you're not being paid for your time you're being paid to do a job. If that job takes you less than 40 hours per week, great, but if you can't meet your deadline in a 40 hour week then you better be prepared to put in the extra time necessary."
startups,3aq0pp,sachbl,2,Mon Jun 22 19:12:47 2015 UTC,"I am 35 years old and the oldest person in the startup I work for. The owner of this startup is 5 years younger than I and has made tens of millions already in life. Age has nothing to do with the measure of someone's success or ability to succeed.   Sorry, but I did say this: ""I don't mean to be judgmental"" -- people base knowledge on what the world around them is like. I just graduated college a year ago (for reference, I'm 23), and there are very few people that had their shit together. I know it's possible (since I think I'm doing it, as well as a few others) but from my experience, it's definitely not the norm around here.  I'm definitely aware that our interests may not line up if I were only working 40 (see the above posts/comments). I like to think that I'm efficient with my time all the same and I like the idea of a task-oriented approach, but I've never actually been in a company that approaches it that way. Most companies around here that I've worked for are managed by an older generation and aren't very progressive in that sense.   Additionally, I guess I didn't state it in the OP, but I'm cool working more than 40 hours some weeks, I just don't like it being the norm. It depends on how people look at it -- if they offset 60 hour weeks with 20 hour weeks, sure, that'd be fine. If it's a constant 60... it's just not for me."
startups,3aq0pp,jstandard,3,Mon Jun 22 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"All good questions - 1)  Practically, you cannot verify.  Most companies who raise capital disclose it to the press within 2-3 months of closing.  Typically, there will be at least 12 months of capital for existing employees from the date of closing.  Companies wouldn't be hiring unless they can pay for at least 6 months.  Otherwise, cheating employees out of salaries is a criminal offense (not just civil) - I don't think most people would mess around with heavy potential consequences.  2)  I think you should consider consulting instead - startups are all about equity and working beyond.  If that isn't where you want to be, maybe you should focus elsewhere, or at least ask for a consulting job at these startups, esp if your work wouldn't be core IP to the company.  3)  I think most of this comes down to believing in the team and concept.  If you feel comfortable and you have lots of communication with your team, you should be good."

I know it's a huge problem but I just don't want to be put in that position (I don't think anyone does, really).  2) This is probably a better choice, yeah. I dunno, maybe I'm just getting old, but I'm not single anymore and I just can't swing it, haha. The thing is though, my work would likely be on the core product, so I think being an employee makes sense. I'm not sure equity is a sensible choice for me, but that's likely just my faith in the general idea and being suspect of the ""investment bubble."" I will still ask about the consulting though.  3) Agreed. Thank you!"
startups,3aq0pp,swizyl,3,Mon Jun 22 18:57:33 2015 UTC,"Your questions make me think an early stage (Pre Series B) startup isn't the right place for you.  They're reasonable questions, but focused on ways to separate you from taking on the risk of a startup.  Re: Funding verification. Ask them how much they raised and what their current runway is.  Re: 40 hours. Yes, you should let the founders know this up front so they can mitigate their risk rather than being surprised after hiring you.   Working a max of 40 hours in an early stage startup is an unrealistic expectation unless you're not a critical member of the team. I'm huge proponent of value of output over # hours worked. There is simply that much to do that 40 hours almost never covers it.  The phrase ""I went down a rather startup-like phase of my life ... and I don't like what it did to me"" shows that early stage startups probably aren't for you. That's 100% okay!  Re: Remote Work. If you haven't worked full-time remotely before, be prepared for a big adjustment. You need managers who are skilled in managing remote work forces and building remote cultures. Also, dig down really deeply to think about if remote is the right working style for you. Think about how much you feed off the energy of others. Think about how disciplined you TRULY are at personal time management. (random youtube surfing is a 1000x more appetizing when someone isn't around to see you watching ""Fails of the Week"" for the 3rd time) Work with your colleagues to ensure there are ways to keep you motivated, in the loop, and accountable.  My biggest suggestion is to focus on Post large Series B/C in larger development teams with more established processes.  You'll feel more comfortable, be more likely to get the lifestyle you're looking for, and will be less of a risky burden on an already risky business."

Predictably Irrational is also a great book to read, but for anyone really. Sure there are interesting insights for entrepreneurs but, big lessons for your life generally as well.

Value in context. You need to provide some sort of value or make a promise before you ask people to take action. A relevant benefit-oriented call to action name. The name of the call to action has to be relevant to the context, the current situation of the person who clicked the link, and it has to be benefit-oriented. Examples of bad choices for call to action names are ""Sign up"" or ""Subscribe"". Nobody actually wants to do these. I wrote more about naming call to actions here.    As to Snip.ly, I hadn't heard of the tool before but now that I did and tried it briefly, I realized it's a service that displays popups. If you want to interrupt people while they're reading something on your blog (I presume), you have to be careful. You have to offer them something valuable, much more valuable than what they are reading right now. Personally, I wouldn't use this exact popup service. It's too obtrusive. I'd wait for my website visitors to finish reading and offer them something related to what they just read at the end. At most, I'd put a call to action on the sidebar, but not this kind of popup that is just annoying.   Since I don't know if you're trying to do content marketing or something else, I need some context to be able to help you (pun totally intended :))."

startups,3amekz,victorantos2,2,Mon Jun 22 14:46:04 2015 UTC,"I would suggest that you look at starting your own thing rather than working on someone else's.  Even if your business is a dismal failure you will forever be able to put ""founder"" on your resume. If it is a success you as founder will reap much of the financial rewards and it will be your name on the company.  As an employee even if your start up is a big success you will receive a fraction of what the founders receive and people care about employee #N way less than they do the people that started the thing.  Plus from the other comments you seem pretty insistent on remote work. It is not impossible but companies that allow full-time remote work are few and far between at any stage in the company life cycle. If you are in charge however you get to decide where and when you work.  Start your own thing.

Google 'uk invoice template' for examples.   2) Are you employed by someone else? If so the easiest thing would have been to pay yourself dividends, but because of the 51/49, you can't just give yourself dividends or you'd have to give your mate money. Instead you will have to pay yourself, which means paying a bit extra tax (because of NI). If the amount you will have to pay yourself is less than £6k in a year you don't have to tell HMRC about your company paying you (i.e. PAYE, the company doesn't have to tell HMRC it's paying people and do loads of forms), but you will personally have to tell HMRC that you are earning extra money and pay the extra tax on top of your day job (i.e. you will have to do a self-assessment tax return).  If it is more than £6k (in a year), if you only want to pay you and not your mate afaik you would have to register your company to pay PAYE with HMRC and pay yourself. As you sound like you have no clue about this stuff, your best bet will be talking to an accountant. You can do it yourself, but they don't make it easy.  3) As per above, depends on how much. Generally speaking you will have to personally register for self-assessment so you can pay the extra personal tax you will owe. It sounds scary but it's fairly simple, though they ask a bunch of weird questions. If you get confused googling helps. Let's assume you've got a normal job too. You take your P60 you get from your normal employer, you put the figures on that form into your online assessment form, you then add your self-made earnings, and HMRC tells you how much you owe. Then they get you to pay it in chunks by the 31st Jan of the next year. So effectively you have almost 9-21 months after earning the money to pay the tax. e.g. if you earnt the money in 01/07/2015 you pay the tax on it 31/01/2017).  The odd bit is then if you pay over £1k in tax, they try and charge you in advance for what tax you will hypothetically be earning in the next tax year so you don't end up owing them huge sums. This could effectively double your tax bill in 2017. It gets complicated. But you can tell them you probably won't earn it.  You can see why people employ accountants."

As long as it's less than 6k pay myself and then just declare it in my self-assessment and do nothing from the company's side. Is that 6k to an individual or overall? Being realistic if it's more than 6k get an accountant to help.   Should I being going to my bank and getting a business account, they unofficially told me not to if it's going to be small amounts?

I care about the company, but they did not part with as much equity compensation as I would have hoped. I care about the longterm health of this company, but I also care about the longterm health of my financials and being remunerated for the inherent risks I am taking.  Would you say $150k is fair? $100k? In your opinion, what would you pay your only business guy who has exceeded every milestone? What is he/she worth to the company after a small raise?"
startups,3amvzz,moakus,3,Mon Jun 22 00:55:27 2015 UTC,If you want 100k from a startup you are possibly cutting out one or two additional employees who can help grow your business.  It really depends on the equity and how much it can be worth. I don't know your situation but 100k sounds pretty unnecessary.  do you live in sf or NYC? If you are working too many hours just cut down your hours and hire someone else to be your assistant
startups,3amvzz,moakus,2,Mon Jun 22 02:23:02 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the long hours. I'd rather take on more hours than hire employees right now; we can't handle more business at the moment, so no sense in bringing on new people. Our currently bottle neck can only be solved with $150k+ engineers, so does paying me an extra $25k matter to the company? It would matter a lot to me; I could save up for a house!  I am trying to find a fair balance between the company's financial best interest and my own. I'm asking on reddit to help me determine what could be considered fair."

startups,3amvzz,veltche8364,3,Sun Jun 21 23:43:06 2015 UTC,Hard to tell without knowing the dynamics of the company.   Are you guys making any profit? What's the burn rate? What are the next mile stones and will your salary take away from reaching it?   Those would be some questions I would ask if you we're in my SAAS startup.
startups,3amvzz,kylecares,2,Sun Jun 21 23:47:08 2015 UTC,"No profit and only project-based revenue right now. We have 4 big pilot projects we are starting. These will be 6 mo - 1 year paid Betas, which will help us to develop the rest of our technology and tailor it to the specific industries. Once these projects are completed next year, the technology will be ready for public launch. Not that this means anything, but we project to have roughly $5M -$10M in sales the first year of public launch, if the current pilots are successful.   We have raised a small round prior (also received a couple grants), so this raise is almost a Series A, but we are considering it a late Seed round. Current burn is roughly $30k per month with everyone (6 people incl one very expensive consultant) + server costs (which are free right now because we won Amazon credit). We just brought on a couple new people who are making market rate, I am just not sure what my market rate is.   Next milestones are mainly based on the tech development. We can't handle more customers right now, and for the next year, so I will fill a project management role as opposed to a 'filling the pipeline' business development role. My next milestones will be ensuring these pilot projects are completed successfully, the customers are happy, and the product is built with the appropriate functionality.   I hope this doesn't sound like I just want money, but I have worked 70+ hrs a week for the past year on less than market salary and sweat equity. Now, we have raised $1M and everyone (except the founders) is getting market rate salaries. Because we're still in Beta, I can't really get paid based on commission, so I am trying to determine what my salary should be. Any thoughts?"
startups,3amvzz,vansoftware,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:15:04 2015 UTC,"ok, so I would think that this at the very least should be discussed with the founders.  Based on some of your comments it looks like you're maxed out on equity.  What are the founders like?"

I got a job offer on Friday for more money, but it is an ""easier"" position in academia.   I would like $150k per year, but would be happy with $125k, and think $100k is the minimum (not sure I would be ""happy"" working 70 hrs/wk for this) I am the entire business side of things and will remain that way, at least until late next year, where we will raise our official Series A and onboard a sales and marketing team. Does this salary seem in the ballpark, or way off base?"
startups,3amvzz,vansoftware,2,Sun Jun 21 23:29:42 2015 UTC,"I don't have as much experience as the other people commenting here, but $150k per year after a Series A that you're saying is more like a Seed, sounds like way too much.   I mean, if you are the entire business side of things, and you're bringing in all the clients, then I guess, depending on how true it is that they would be in a crisis position without you, maybe you could ask for 150 and settle on 125 with them after some negotiation. MAYBE. If you are lucky. I don't think anyone deserves $125k after a million dollar round unless you're one of the few devs who is competent at some emerging technology/concept like NLP that is core to the biz.

In my case, our crowdfunding platform was made to be industry/market agnostic. We have several markets that could definitely utilize this crowdfunded business model (creatives, non-profits, clubs/organizations, etc.) and decided to hone in on clubs/organizations to begin with because we found a couple great organizations that were fully behind the project before our platform was made."

What you want to do is personally reach out to people in different industries that would use your product. Identify the industry that continuously reacts to your solution positively. Then, woo them with discounts or freebies on your platform to get them onboard.

If you go up against the general market you will face the incumbents who are radically better suited for the market than you are.  Scaling is not your concern right now. Validating your business is. By picking a smaller market you can fail smaller and learn more about your product from product enthusiasts (happens in SaaS).  Think about how Elon Musk went after eco-rich people with super expensive Tesla's. On the surface it's dumb, he neglected the entire popultaion of normal US car buyers (Toyotas, etc).  But what was genius is that he entered a market that was small, niche and incumbent free - he knew he could charge a high price at a low manufacturing output.   You guys/gals will have a similar small output (small sales team, small dev team, etc). You need to sell high, and plan for low sales."

startups,3aog9i,hermanaut,2,Mon Jun 22 05:22:31 2015 UTC,"We feel that previous social prediction markets failed because 1) they are too complicated and 2) the incentive is off. The average 'social' user doesn't want to read about odds or probability, or navigate a confusing website. They just want to place their prediction, see what their friends are thinking, and then, eventually find out if they were right. It's a point of pride to predict accurately, especially in competition with friends.  Secondly, on those sites, betting/winning money was the incentive. In today's social atmosphere, the biggest incentive is being visible to your friends and seeing them react to your posts/action. Whether it's posting pictures/status updates on Facebook or ""snapping"" a selfie, users just want their friends to see it. With Cassie, we want to offer the most social interaction possible. By providing a way for users to make predictions in friendly competition, we are creating a new form of expression: future forecasts. Cassie is not about betting. It's about creating a new form of social media that gives a formal outlet to our everyday informal speculations on the future.  We still have a long way to go and a lot of features to add, but that's why we need users! With more users, we can hopefully get funding and make our vision a reality."

""I will only connect with people I work with, do business with, or who I genuinely want to be part of my 'network'."" That's all great and fair for you to do, but that's not how networking really works. I recently met (in everyday life, not LinkedIn) someone that I thought would have no impact on my business. By your definition, you wouldn't have networked with him. But I talked about my business, and it turned out his brother-in-law was someone who was interested in my business & I got a new client.    LinkedIn works the same way. Sure, my high-school friend who's an entry-level accountant that I haven't talked to in years doesn't seem valuable at all to my business. But maybe one of his connections will see me & my description in his contact list. Or maybe because I've connected with him, I'll be in the back of his mind & he'll mention my service to one of his clients when a certain topic comes up.     And lastly, I think you missed a group of people: Group C. I spend very little time on LinkedIn, maybe 15 minutes a month to accept connection invites. I don't try and connect with everyone possible.

Could they be useful at some point in the future? Do they add value to your network? Given there's no real downside to having more connections, that answer is almost always going to be yes.   How little networking do you do that you only have 66 connections?

startups,3ajx5l,Grande_Yarbles,7,Sun Jun 21 03:24:16 2015 UTC,"Hi there. I work in retail supply chain. I wouldn't concern yourself about repercussions from retailers. The intention of promotions is marketing and to move product, and frankly with today's difficult retail climate any incremental business would be warmly welcomed. There may be some issues with individual promotions tied to sales history, coupons, etc but in general nothing that would prevent this business from operating.   Biggest complication I can see is in regards to payment, ownership, and returns. Regarding payment, who actually pays the retailer for both Joe and Kate's orders? If Joe/Kate are paying you and you're paying the retailer then bear in mind you become a reseller, which means certain obligations... such as handling returns, which can be significant for some categories like apparel.   Another option would be for Kate to pay Joe, and trust on both sides managed by the social network that is set up. But then Joe will wind up being key in the transaction- placing the order, receiving goods, passing them to Kate, and also handling returns on behalf of Kate. Seems a lot of obligation for that $9 he saved.  Not to say your idea wouldn't work- I think it needs some thought as far as how to manage the transaction itself and returns. Aggregating demand has big potential."
startups,3ajx5l,Grande_Yarbles,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:45:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the insightful comment. Really appreciate your input since you're more familiar with this space. I mentioned in another comment, similar to ones you brought up, some options for processing payment/accounts 1. They pay me and I pay retailer 2. One pays both, the other pays first with Venmo, which has no transaction fee and is popular with college kids 3. I pay for both and they both pay me Venmo.   These options juggle pros and cons around cost, trust, privacy, and ease of payment. Might offer all three as payment options honestly. Different people might look for different things; some will pay more for security, some don't mind the privacy and want lower cost; some might match with a friend and have no issues with trust/intra purchase payment. The ""social network"" aspect comes into play here, and everyone's past ratings for their role in eh transaction will be public too to foster a community of trust. They can choose to show off what they bought too, etc etc. and other typical social media stuff.   Moreover, discussion elsewhere has led me to the conclusion that it's best to make sales final. Unless I can come up with something genius for the returns/ownership debacle. Maybe returns only for paying subscribers? Do you have input on this?"
startups,3ajx5l,thatsnotpc,2,Sun Jun 21 06:07:59 2015 UTC,"Seems like you'd need to lean towards the other parties buying product, as otherwise you'd somehow have to create a way to make payment on behalf of folks as they browse the Internet and come across those promotions. Maybe an app or plugin could do that but it seems complicated, at least from a non-techie's perspective.   Otherwise you'd have to wind up curating the deals... and then you'll wind up just being a Groupon clone.   Sales being final might be tough given how frequently folks return products. One option might be to look at non-apparel to start, as if you look at return rates across different categories you'll see that apparel tends to trend much higher than other categories. Or incentivise the 'Joe' in the transaction financially or via some sort of higher ranking in the social network to want to be a coordinator."
startups,3ajx5l,InaneMembrane,2,Sun Jun 21 07:40:09 2015 UTC,"Just chiming in with my two cents worth of advice. You don't want to be the middleman in the transaction, just in the match. It will be cheaper for you to insure against bad actors than manage returns, etc. you want something that can scale very quickly. This also has the added advantage of being able to say to VCs ""were the uber of buddy buying."" They eat that shit up.  Edit: almost first to say, great idea! It's still going to be hard to get traction, but this is an idea that can conceivably get traction once someone smart and scrappy figures it out."

startups,3ajx5l,fitzthebill,6,Sun Jun 21 15:51:27 2015 UTC,How would they do a return or exchanges.  I think that's where your going to have the issue. Customers will need the original receipt or at least the card used on the order.
startups,3ajx5l,mighty_falcon,5,Sat Jun 20 23:01:31 2015 UTC,"I agree. Plus how will you actually make the payments and collect them etc? Gonna bring in costs for yourself like the processing of credit card payments from the customers to you so that you can then pay it on. So then your 2% could be gone. Plus, as you become the retailer you have to do customer service so there could be salaries there if it does grow."

Reddit has no screening whatsoever, no way for me to start small and physically track every purchase, no way to ensure the buyers are close enough/trust each other enough to buy together online, and the subset of the target reach who will want to come onto reddit is smaller because reddit is not specialized and/or stigma.

I've seen 3% be the norm and it can range up to 25% in very rare situations.  I built a shopping app in the past.  Which brings up getting the deals!  How are you going to get the inventory?"

If you meant shipping as in the original shipping of the products, then I don't think you understand the economics of this. If you meant for the returns, which I assume is what you mean, I can either put return shipping on them, count it as a final sale since many stores who do special sales do that already, or subsidize some or all of the return shipping with credit."

Contact the brands and negotiate a price, commission, and return time.  You'll never have inventory, and you hold the funds for 30 days.  Also the items get shipped from the brand.  This will would be the optimal model I think.  Just my two cents."
startups,3ajx5l,CalvinsStuffedTiger,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:36:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback. I have looked into Gilt's model. It is quite different from both the retailer and customer end but there are definitely learning points.
startups,3ajx5l,TheRationalPaki,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:50:39 2015 UTC,"If Joe returns his item, the store will probably ""claw back"" the discounts, meaning either Kate or you will get screwed. It is an interesting idea though, I'll give you that. Also, for pricing, I'd take like 30% of the savings, not a tiny percentage of the total. For someone to bother using it, it would be because they will save a good amount."

I like that. Like I said the commission amount is just a placeholder for now, and I will definitely adjust it after a good amount of data comes in after a first purchase with no commission promotion or something like that.  As for the returns, I might just consider making it a final sale. Maybe. A lot of the comments are describing the problems that a return might cause."
startups,3ajx5l,dylan,2,Sun Jun 21 02:15:28 2015 UTC,"If people are shopping from your site, and the order was consolidated, then pushed through to Amazon (or whoever), I can't see how they'd stop you.  Also, from the standpoint of an eCommerce owner, I'd actually be ecstatic about this. Anything that helps me close sales is a good thing.  And if they have loss leaders, they're already likely big enough to have taken ""devils"" (the type of customer who exploits loss leaders) into account anyway."
startups,3ajx5l,dylan,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:46:54 2015 UTC,"Good point about the leaders. Yes I wasn't really thinking about smaller ecommerce at first because college kids i think are more likely to use big well known retailers. but that's definitely an option to expand on in the future when the audience goes beyond college kids. which i can see happening very quickly because this benefits every single party: customer gets lower price, seller has higher volume, i make commission. I'll hit you up when we partner with ecommerce haha"
startups,3ajx5l,zynoda,2,Sun Jun 21 03:31:54 2015 UTC,"I think you should try it out at a few universities and see where it goes. Try adding a social aspect to the experience.  Friends generally shop at the same stores and fb, twitter, etc. can make those connections. Also, have the option to create wishlists so when a sale does come around it'll be easier to connect others. Think about adding a small membership fee."

The other option is to look at the suggestion Google gives you and just contract someone off elance or upwork to do each specific task.

I was on a special team for Activision (dealing with games like the CoD series and many others). Essentially, we'd get free games in return for helping bug-test games in the late-alpha stage.  Getting on the team wasn't that easy, though. We had to fully detail 3 exploits/decent bugs for games that aren't found online (i.e., you have to personally hunt for things that others haven't discovered), and then detail them, and explain how to reproduce them.  It was a pretty great experience, and there were ~25 of us on the team total I believe.  I bring this up because you won't necessarily need to offer monetary compensation. You can offer up other things as well.  The high point of the testing was that our names are also included in the credits for each game, :)."

So many people have opinions and they could potentially lead you down a never ending build cycle and have no intention of paying for your service.  I would just get out there, pitch dentist until you get one to pre-pay.  I know this is probably very difficult, but if you can manage to do that you'll really learn a lot.  One, how to sell the idea and refine it.  Two, you'll learn what the low hanging fruit is in your industry.  Hit those first so that you can start building a small list of clientele.  You'll be able to expand from there.  I know this is easier said than done, I've had to do it.  I think the idea sounds interesting and might have some possibilities - but I'm not a dentist.

Spend 30 minutes generating a list of all dentists within a 5 mile radius of where you live (wider if you're outside the city). Find the details of the dentists themselves (skip the receptionists - they'll likely try and fob you off) and have a nice pitch prepared."

Anyone can get stuff done once it's broken into bite-sized todo items.  For example, ""where do I start?"" == way too broad. You should think: how do I sell a bottle of lotion to someone?  Well to do that you need 3 things: (1) a bottle of lotion, (2) a customer, and (3) a way to collect payment.  Okay, so next breakdown: (1) how do you get a bottle of lotion? You have a few options. Since you're experimenting with this idea, you could just go to the store and buy one. Or, even better, you could set up the website without ANY inventory and only buy the bottle once someone's bought it from you.  (2) How do you find a customer? I'd break that down to ""find out who my ideal customer is"" and ""where does that ideal customer hang out online"".  (3) This is easy and I can just give it to you... setup a store like Shopify, they'll walk you through the whole thing.  The actual steps I've given aren't nearly as important as the idea of breaking down a huge idea (""I want to start a business!"") into smaller, manageable pieces."

If THEY fire you then you have the option to collect unemployment where the company would be responsible for some of that cost from the government.

There are lot of stuff like that you must pay attention to in the corporate world. For example if you have someone consulting for you as a freelancer, but they are working regular 9-5 hours for you AND you are supplying them with a laptop then legally they are an employee that you are offering no benefits to.

I read the other comment where you said you don't like him using you as leverage, but you're going to be leaving effective immediately regardless, no? If you can harmlessly help the guy out, regardless of your feelings towards him, why not?  All you have to do is remove 4 words and you could save his behind.  If this could arise as a problem for you later on, If he didn't email you to revise the letter, get him to. Then send a copy with the original text to yourself so you have proof of your original intent in case you ever need it, then send the revised version. Everyone wins!  If you don't want to, by all means don't. I just don't see the harm in potentially helping the guy out with (Again, not knowing enough about the situation leaves me blind to this) 0 downsides."

You're obviously burning a bridge by calling him out on this (which it sounds like you're well aware of), but I feel like the only one that has anything to gain from rewriting is him. It sounds like he's already on shaky grounds with the investors and trying to cover up anywhere he can.  Realistically, if someone were to ask him about this, he should be able to say ""Yes, X and myself discussed this issue and I was aware that he would not have been able to proceed if we didn't resolve the situation."" If anything this scenario will make you look bad for calling him out in such a way (that is assuming the investors are on his side).  Like others said, read your paperwork (and perhaps consult with a lawyer).  I personally wouldn't be worried about positioning this as a firing or not. IMO, you not receiving pay is effectively the company firing you."

Yes.  And I think that's a pretty obvious yes. You want to give people a taste of the good stuff, get them used to it, and then once the trial runs out, they can't live without the amazing features you put into the full product bc it's just that damn good.  Take golf tickets (I'm watching the US Open right now). You provide people tickets to golf tournaments. The free tickets are for the grand stands on holes 1-9. But if you pay a premium, you have access to all 1-18 holes. You give away premium tickets on the first 2 days (4 days total). The free model still let's you watch golf in person. Still gets to see the pros. But who wants to miss the final hole where the champion celebrates on the last day? Nobody (well, almost nobody). That's the best part. That's your full featured premium golf pass. Make your full featured version irresistible and totally worth the pay. A no-brainer."

In addition to MVPs, we have a UX team dedicated to leading potential customers through the UX before we build the backend. Sometimes it's even just screenshots just to get initial feedback.

Two example mvps we literally wrapped up today that I plan on spreading the word about next week  are www.expirify.com and www.printablecalendarhq.com  Following the initial launch we then wait to see what feedback we get and iterate from there, or not if the feedback is negative or worse still nonexistent."

Once the torrent is done downloading, you can connect to your seedbox (with an FTP client like FileZilla) and download your torrent's contents to your personal computer.  I'm not sure how difficult or how good of an opportunity starting a seedbox company is, but you can investigate it yourself.

I don't want you to get the wrong impression.  I'm not knocking what you're doing.  In fact I was interested in it and that's why I clicked through.  You should write your messaging around benefits you can deliver.  There's every likelihood that a startup put together through your website will fail - and that won't be your fault.

We're also establishing relationships with university and a student close to graduation who wants to get some experience could be another good option.

How would you know if they are manually filtering email since she hasn't had any signups yet?   We might still be too easy in trusting haha. We reasoned that since there wasn't actually any kids yoga at that school right now, that the owner would benefit as well by gaining money from my gf renting the place and maybe even some spillover parents. And since that school already has clients maybe some spillover kids as well from practicing parents for us. Although that hasn't happened yet.   Has she had any email contact at all through that address? What about a phone number? Without a website, you can't measure any kind of response.   The e-mail address is managed by the yoga school owner. She is having good phone and mail contact with my gf all throughout, so we didn't see any danger in it for now while she was still starting up.

She also came up with the idea for the festival and such so on one hand she does seem to be actually helping my gf get started, but... yea who knows.

I would suggest not trying to spin up too many different CMS options and focus on marketing and the overall biz plan. You're obviously a talented dev and adding features is great, but perhaps focus on providing as much value for the product in it's current iteration. As /u/bodhi_mind suggests, customization can be a good revenue source, but would distract IMO from the main business model. Perhaps you can find some good referral partners and take a nice fee.   A few comments about the site:  Home/Let's Start - redirects to the home page. ""Let's Start"" makes me think that's where I would click to sign up.

startups,3aefko,agoraforce,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"Forgive my random comments. Some are nitpicky, some are future ""nice-to-have"", so don't interpret my comments as explicit requirements, this is just what I'm seeing so far. By the way, most of these comments are about WP, but probably apply to joomla and other CMS's as well.  I like that there aren't a ton of themes pre-installed in wordpress. But what about adding a ""hosted by jhost"" in the footer by default? The subdomain on it's own isn't going to drive a lot of traffic. For the free customers, you need to make the experience super-smooth, but leave enough reasons to want to upgrade at some point in the future. Do you have a way to report back the usage to the customer? You mentioned ""fair use"" somewhere along the way, which means a single user shouldn't be grinding too hard on the CPU/Storage/Bandwidth, but a nice way to be able to see that would be interesting.  You could spin up piwick and offer that as a paid add-on (or free). Or let someone pop in their Google Analytics ID. Automatically installing tracking codes would be awesome.   The more the account dashboard increases a user's productivity and automates the boring stuff, the more success you'll have getting users that aren't super-comfortable with managing open source cms installations to build quality sites. For example, are you familiar with wpremote.com or cmscommander.com? Being able to click a single button and update themes or plugins that are out of date is a huge win and makes your site much stickier. Or, considering wpremote is free, you could leverage that (for WP at least).  Other setup options, like ""choose from one of these 3 templates"", choose the reading options ""static front page vs blog"", ""allow comments"" would be great. Also maybe default the permalink type to post name?  What about a link in the dashboard of the CMS that takes you back to jhost control panel?  This seems very much a clean install of the CMS. That's great, but keep in mind that you need to ""own"" the sites created on your platform. You don't have to make it impossible for someone to migrate elsewhere (actually making it easy would be a great selling point as well), but when someone's using the free service, keeping an unobtrusive fence around the experience is totally ok.  What about the login link on the home page in the far upper right, as a button in the middle of the other links it seems a bit hidden.   When I first log in, it took me to create a new blog. I think the dashboard of existing blogs would be useful. Then, ""create new"" from there. At some point, I imagine it won't be unlimited new blogs right (at least for free users)? Start enforcing that ""admin home"" concept instead of always driving logins to create a new site.   What about some type of single-sign-on? I know it's possible, but might not be worth the trouble. IDK. Once a site is setup, users can always be setup within the WP panel itself (standard functionality). So this concept would only apply to the primary admin. Unless...  Think about any of the functions that each of the CMS tools has that can be more easily managed in your control panel. What if an admin could create additional users under jhost and then apply that to one or more blogs? Then their users would have one place to login if they needed to manage more than one site, deactivate a user in one place instead of 10, etc.  Again, stuff like this might not fit your business model and may be far more trouble than it's worth (for now). I don't want any of this to distract you from making the core functionality bullet-proof and focusing on the UI and getting to a point where you can start marketing this.   How are you trying to get users?  Any idea about pricing tiers?  CMS's that would be nice next: ghost, drupal, jekyll?  Realize that executing well on this project at this puts you in a pretty aggressive category of service providers. This is a ""one click install"" service. There are many that do much more than this, but the angle you're coming at it is very interesting and if it were marketed right could be a real success. Simply scale up your hosting to support the load of your users and make sure your pricing model supports that at all the different models. (95% free, etc). You can offer a ton of different services within this tool.  btw, I use the shit out of Dreamhost. $10/mo + as many domains as I want to pay for, one click installer for a ton of different OS products including CMS's such as WP, drupal, joomla, concrete5, and a few others."

For example, are you familiar with wpremote.com or cmscommander.com? Being able to click a single button and update themes or plugins that are out of date is a huge win and makes your site much stickier. Or, considering wpremote is free, you could leverage that (for WP at least).   This is a feature that I most definitely want. Being able to keep your sites up to date without your own intervention is a huge win. I'll will try implement this as a premium feature, because I think this is something people would kill to have.    Other setup options, like ""choose from one of these 3 templates"", choose the reading options ""static front page vs blog"", ""allow comments"" would be great. Also maybe default the permalink type to post name? What about a link in the dashboard of the CMS that takes you back to jhost control panel? This seems very much a clean install of the CMS. That's great, but keep in mind that you need to ""own"" the sites created on your platform. You don't have to make it impossible for someone to migrate elsewhere (actually making it easy would be a great selling point as well), but when someone's using the free service, keeping an unobtrusive fence around the experience is totally ok.   I half agree with this. I'd like to offer a 'Download Backup' feature as premium at some point. With the download backup it would be fairly easy to migrate away from jHost, which is not all that bad. People should be free to do that. I will try to keep the CMS as vanilla as possible, and changes should be fair and transparent. I aim to own the trust of users.    What about the login link on the home page in the far upper right, as a button in the middle of the other links it seems a bit hidden.   Agree with this... maybe also a drop down with who is logged and such? I'll put it on the list   When I first log in, it took me to create a new blog. I think the dashboard of existing blogs would be useful. Then, ""create new"" from there. At some point, I imagine it won't be unlimited new blogs right (at least for free users)? Start enforcing that ""admin home"" concept instead of always driving logins to create a new site.   You are right. It wont be unlimited in the future, I will keep it unlimited in Alpha stag. I intend to overhaul the login landing page where the list of blog resides later on when more features are being released.    What about some type of single-sign-on? I know it's possible, but might not be worth the trouble. IDK. Once a site is setup, users can always be setup within the WP panel itself (standard functionality). So this concept would only apply to the primary admin. Unless.. Think about any of the functions that each of the CMS tools has that can be more easily managed in your control panel. What if an admin could create additional users under jhost and then apply that to one or more blogs? Then their users would have one place to login if they needed to manage more than one site, deactivate a user in one place instead of 10, etc. Again, stuff like this might not fit your business model and may be far more trouble than it's worth (for now). I don't want any of this to distract you from making the core functionality bullet-proof and focusing on the UI and getting to a point where you can start marketing this.   I like where you are going with this, but i'll leave it for now, it's a bit too much off course for the time being.   How are you trying to get users?   To be brutally honest, have not yet thought about this. I was wanting to get the main functionality up and running.. do you have any suggestions?   Any idea about pricing tiers?   I intend to make 1 pricing tier (Premium). Not sure yet how much.   CMS's that would be nice next: ghost, drupal, jekyll?   Drupal en Ghost were on the list, added jekyll to be inspected.   Realize that executing well on this project at this puts you in a pretty aggressive category of service providers. This is a ""one click install"" service. There are many that do much more than this, but the angle you're coming at it is very interesting and if it were marketed right could be a real success. Simply scale up your hosting to support the load of your users and make sure your pricing model supports that at all the different models. (95% free, etc). You can offer a ton of different services within this tool.   I like that you mentioned the scaling up  part. I've been really smart during the development. Everything is built to scale with the amount of users. I can migrate websites between webservers with minimal downtime (seconds), which will come in handy at the time of maintenance and such.   btw, I use the shit out of Dreamhost. $10/mo + as many domains as I want to pay for, one click installer for a ton of different OS products including CMS's such as WP, drupal, joomla, concrete5, and a few others."

startups,3af084,halfercode,2,Fri Jun 19 16:19:51 2015 UTC,"Congrats on launching an alpha!  I see a lot of startups trying to solve the 'getting a job' problem (some in tech news, other started by people I know), its a huge and expensive problem.  But as you work on this, there are some key questions you should try to answer when thinking about how a solution should look. Here are some major ones that I think you should know in detail: Why do recruiters exist? What service do they provide that online job boards don't? Recruiting is big business, so you should be able to explain very clearly what makes it lucrative, and how you can leverage that knowledge What factors into someone's interest in any given job, and in what proportions are they relevant? What factors into an employers interest in any given candidate, and in what proportions?  There are many other important questions you should be working to find answers to, but those are a few major ones.  From the design of your platform, you seem to think that location is an extremely important factor in matching tech people with jobs. Is that true (i genuinely don't know the answer)? How important is it?   If you can figure it out, you have the opportunity to make a looooot of money. But this is a very complicated problem. Hope this helps, good luck!"
startups,3af084,whys_wise,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:59:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughts! Anything that gives me new stuff to reflect on is most helpful. I should say that I am not a recruiter so my understanding of the general model is from the other side of the fence - I've dealt with recruiters quite a bit as a seeker (and my experience is a mix of good and bad).  My first response is that I don't see recruiters as a competitor - the model is predicated on secrecy and (if company/location info is important) it wouldn't work with the business I have in mind. As a seeker I much prefer Stack Overflow's approach: all information the seeker needs to apply is available up front, without an intermediary. I can shoot an email or set up a tel convo, to get some further info, on the same business day.  Now, I think I understand the recruiter's model, and to my mind there are two components. Firstly they are effectively offering an insurance policy: here in the UK, with senior devs in demand, it is quite possible to spend £10K on advertising for the post and still not fill it satisfactorily. The recruiter's offer is to take a £5K finders fee to find a successful candidate, and then take the same again if the new employee transitions to permanent (usually within six months). The recruiter handles first-line admin and in some cases a telephone interview too, so I can see why busy hirers are tempted to go for it (and the fees are bound to be negotiable).  The other part of the recruiter's advantage is that they are sucking CVs into their database all the time, so they have a large set of passive candidates to choose from. This a substantial advantage over the hirer who advertises a few posts a year and who doesn't have the time for this level of admin.  So, recruiters are filling a need, but my view is companies are using them because they are busy and/or cautious, and not because £10K per filled seat represents good value. In my post I said I felt that recruitment business is dropping off somewhat: it looks like small tech firms and startups are increasingly marking roles as ""no agencies"" and are using Stack Overflow and other self-service boards to get exposure (one hiring firm I saw recently was even throwing in the finders fee, nice touch!).  Thus, whilst I'd like my proposition to offer better value than recruiters (and thus tempt a few hirers to cross the line) I see myself as tapping into the section of the market that already does not use them.  Your point about location is well worth further research. I presently consider it important because it's directly related to commute (and thus quality of life) that factors into the seeker's decision process, but maybe that's just me? I may look into examining attitudes amongst more job seekers here. Out of my two USPs I regard it as valuable but not critical - data freshness is much more persuasive."
startups,3af084,whys_wise,2,Fri Jun 19 18:43:45 2015 UTC,"Glad you're thinking a lot about the problem. I'm in no way trying to discourage you from pursuing it, but make sure you understand it to the fullest extent possible. You definitely need to understand the value that recruiters bring, and I think you are selling their value short a little bit. Its not just insurance, they are also acting as a filter as well. Maybe there's more value that their bringing, I don't know, but definitely talk to lots of people who use them to ask why they do. Above all else, do your research. Figure out what matters to job seekers and job posters, so you can provide the most accurate and relevant matches. I don't think you need a search bar, I think you need an integration with LinkedIn where you can match them with the right opportunities. At least thats my guess. If you have any questions about user research, I have a startup helping founders organize and conduct user research to better understand how to build amazing user experiences.

Quite possibly true - perhaps my one or two negative experiences have coloured my perception of the business. As it happens I know an IT recruiter, so I will pick his brains on that question.   I don't think you need a search bar   That's interesting, quite a lot of my usability feedback thus far is that the search facility needs to be front and centre! I think the approach you're outlining is in the realm of automated matching, which quite a lot of folks are trying to tackle already. However, I certainly would not rule it out - my ideas agile board is already bursting, so no harm in adding another :-).

Tunneling through the ports is solved with TURN/STURN servers."

startups,3abie6,terpin,3,Thu Jun 18 19:26:46 2015 UTC,"I'm working on Bugblur. It's a service for programmers and sysadmins . Basically, it sends you alerts when you need to update a component of your website, like a web server or a database.   I'm still working on the code but I'd like to have your opinion on the landing page."
startups,3abie6,bloup,7,Thu Jun 18 19:51:01 2015 UTC,"Hey hey!  Block #1   Bugblur alerts you when you need to update a component of your website.   Not bad for starting off your page.   We sift everyday through dozens of security advisories (CVEs) and send you a short recap of what you need to patch. See what a typical email looks like.   The ""See what a typical email looks like"" should be separated from the main text. Since it's all black text, they may not know they can click on it or might just skim it.  Good CTA button.  Block #2  The most important part of writing text on your website is to keep in mind that it's a conversation between you and the reader. Example:   Stop wasting your time reading through CVEs you don't care about.  The most tedious part of running a website is keeping it updated. It's hard to keep up with security announcements, especially because there's so many of them.  Whether you have a dedicated ops person or not, having one of your engineers go every morning through all the newly-released security advisories is a poor use of their time.  Bugblur sends you a short and to the point email whenever a security vulnerability is announced in your software stack.   You probably wouldn't say this to someone standing in front of you offering you money to invest in your company, yeah? You touch on pain points in this section about wasting time combing through all this crap, but do you really need all this text? No, you don't. We need to condense this down while addressing the problems, you can do it OP!  You did really well with illustrating how it works here, though your benefit statements could be a little tighter.   Vulnerabilities are ranked by order of importance  Because not every vulnerability requires you to drop everything.   Can we combine the stuff in the second sentence into the first one?  For the last one I'd use ""No News is Good News - Only Get an Email When You're Affected"". You can combine these things together, you don't have to always have a big TITLE followed by tiny descriptor text. If you can get it all done with the title, do it!  Block #3 ""How does Bugblur work?""  You ramble on a bit in each section here, try to reign that in a bit. Step #2 is a good example; of course you have humans reading it, unless you have robot staff members :) Try to condense this, I know it's a pain in the ass but it's important and when done well will make your page sparkle!  Block #4 ""Pricing""  Well, this is a bit of a mess.    We have two plans right now.  The main difference between them is the maximum number of alerts you can have. We're also planning to add exciting features to the Business plan (integrations, etc.) which won't be in the Startup plan. Of course, you can switch plans at any time.  Every plan comes with a free 30-day trial.   OP, if you saw all this when you came to a pricing section on a website, would you wonder if these people were up to shady doings? Probably. You need to dial it back a bit, you have a solid offering and you don't need to put this much here in your pricing section.   You have an ad-hoc FAQ section parked under the payment section and it looks like it's all together. Separate this out a bit. Most of your FAQs are payment related yes, but you don't want people to think that the payment section is the most important section of your landing page, especially when you're trying to get them to click that little orange button. If that little FAQ section is meant to be an FAQ section, you should probably address some common questions you guys get via email about your offering. If you address their objections immediately you'll save time and money.  Overall not a bad site! Focus the most on what Bugblur can do for your customers and you'll do just fine!"

startups,3abie6,Jbasket,3,Thu Jun 18 20:42:58 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go through this and analyze it like a user would, so if my analysis is disjointed, that's why.  Quick TLDR;  No offense my friend, but this website is a total clusterfuck. You seriously need to work out these problems, define clear benefits of your service, differentiate your service, create an FAQ page, make information easy to find, and put your phone number on the top of the page. Woo. Please read below.  There's nothing wrong with minimalism, but you don't really back things up on your landing page. It all leads me to other parts of the site - and since everyone is on mobile now, you want to have tid-bits of stuff on the front page in blocks that lead to other parts of your website for people that want more details.  Landing Page  Right now you literally only have 30 words on your landing page and half of those words come from your contact bit at the bottom.  Now OP, less is more - but what am I doing here? What makes you guys different? I googled ""brilliant resume solutions"" and Google kicked out 453,000 results in a third of a second.  In your second block on your landing page, your CTA block, you say ""You have the experience. Let's get to work, together"". This sounds great...  But you've yet to demonstrate to me how you can help me do more with my resume. All of your buttons lead to the same page, I don't understand why this isn't on the first page with a smart call to action button? Why have that enormous contact information eyesore on the front page instead of this?  Choose the option to best fit your needs  The ""Choose the option..."" page is not exciting and doesn't sell me on anything. What are the benefits of going with you? Why should I care about anything that Rezi has to offer me, why would I trust you with my career?   There are so many objections to converting for me here. This is just bad.  Also, why isn't there a pricing page? What about an ""About Us"" page that establishes your credibility, authority and tells me about where you draw your experience from? It's one thing to say you're going to get my resume into the hands of hiring managers, another thing to demonstrate it.  Your job as a salesperson (that's what you are when you don the copywriter hat) is to figure out the user's objections and eliminate them. This site needs lots of love.  Just Figured Out That Each Type of Resume has a Landing Page  Hidden in plain sight! People aren't going to click on things if they don't know they're there! I had to go through like 3 pages to find pricing! That's insane! Prices should never be hidden or a barrier to conversion, ever. If it takes me this many steps to figure out how to buy your services, I'm probably not going to trust you with my credit card. (""pay with card"" is a terrible complete action button, buddy. you can do better)  Content Page  Ah shit. Okay. So I'm looking at this page and the way this is laid out makes me think that you're not actually a company but a one (wo)man shop fixing resumes. There's nothing wrong with that, but it does bring up trust issues. I have to pay first, and then email you a resume? There's no form or anything, some kind of professional way of automating it? How can we frame this so you look like someone trustworthy that knows what they're doing?  You've got some benefits off to the side explaining stuff. ""Content is King"" is so cliched now, you'll want to ditch this and find another way to put it. There's a lot of programmerese here that could be put into plain, natural clean language the explains the benefits of your service instead of the features - everything on this page should be pushing me forward to make me fill in that form and click that button.   Template Page  On this other page here... it needs help OP.    Would you exchange about 4 cups of coffee for your dream job? If yes, read on...   Would you say these words aloud to someone on the phone when trying to get them to buy your services? It's so unnatural, it comes off like you aren't an effective communicator (SO BAD WHEN THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SELLING!) or that you're outsourcing. Both of these are just horribly bad for trust and reputation. You have to fix it. This should all be clear, clean and easily understandable.  Also, your customer shouldn't have to work to see you demonstrate your proof of how this works. You need to fix this whole    For a larger view: Right Click. Open Image in New Tab. Left Click   bit. Seriously, never make them work to find out what you can do for them. I know it sounds like a stupid little thing but services live and die by this shit.  Contact  Your contact page URL is the FAQ page. You need an FAQ.   YOU HAVE A PHONE NUMBER?! Why isn't this on the top of your website where people can access it at all times?! Seriously! You need this in there!  There is a lot of stuff you need to work on here OP. I could probably keep going but I'm already over 5,000 characters. Please, please, please work on this. No one is going to give you their money or trust you with their career and financial information unless you give them reasons to trust you."

startups,3abie6,jfelient,2,Thu Jun 18 21:42:23 2015 UTC,"OK. I just checked out your user history to see if you were a programmer (programmers tend to write things a certain way that delights me but isn't the best for landing pages), and I noticed you said that you just started the first Tesla-based rideshare company.  THAT IS ONE HELL OF A HOOK WHY ISN'T THAT IN YOUR FIRST BLOCK?! WHY?! Seriously OP! I'm over here losing my goddamn mind because that is such an amazing thing that no one else is doing... and you're presenting your business like it's just another uber clone. Don't do this!  THIS SHOULD BE IN THE FIRST BLOCK. YOU GO DO THAT RIGHT NOW OP!   Block #2  This block is boring, it's long, and no one is going to read it. I hate putting things this way but the people who come to your site are looking for a ride, not an investment prospectus. The proof on the side is good, btw, just the wall of text tunes me out.   Split this block into two sections: what makes drivr different, and a section that talks about three amazing benefits of going with drivr over something like uber. You need to sell them on the beauty of drivr and set yourself apart (fuckin' tesla!)  Block #3  This block, I'm going to call it the social proof block, is nice and all... but there are two. Just two. Have you guys been featured in any magazine articles or anything? If not, kick your marketer in the pants and start setting up a press kit. This is a neat service that really sets itself apart, but no one is going to pay attention to two random people saying you're the bees knees, y'know?  There's also no mention of price on the first page, so people might be afraid that it's like asking for the market price of seafood (if you have to ask, you can't afford it). Always have an easy to find pricing page in your nav bar :)"

startups,3abie6,Agent_Cody_Banks,2,Thu Jun 18 21:26:09 2015 UTC,"PREPARE YOUR ANUS OP. I suggest a tube of carmex from the nearest corner store, it soothes and hydrates all at the same time.  Now OP, you know you've done the bad thing, don't you? You do. You're a bad cat man.  I checked this out on both my phone and my desktop, to be fair. Sometimes stuff is mobile only and I get that...  BUT OP. WHAT IS THIS THING? YOU DON'T EVEN TELL ME WHAT THE THING IS?! WHY?! WHY DID YOU DO THAT?  I get the less is more philosophy, I love not having to do too much work or write loads of crap, it's great. I don't want to write it, they don't want to read it, we're all happy.  I worked off of your initial message where there was no explanation. I shouldn't need an off-site explanation to know what I'm looking at. I know you're probably drawing inspiration from SnapChat's website, but SnapChat can have their website like that, they're known. People know what it does. People don't know what Checkitnow does yet. You have to tell 'em. Them's the rules, OP!  I mean, you don't even throw me a bone. I have no idea what I'm doing here. You could explain it in three words in that CTA/""Sign up"" button with something like ""Discover Your Next Favorite Thing"" or some bullshit here.   So I sent this to three people that test things for me.  Two of them thought it was some kind of price checking app. One thought maybe you like snapchatted them pictures of things to buy. People shouldn't have to guess at what you're offering them, you should tell them in clear language that makes them want to download the app.  So you need to explain what you're doing here OP. Make an FAQ page at the bottom, come up with a clever tagline or something that explains it.   Explain it."

First thing I notice is some readability issues: http://i.imgur.com/pNCjGZ3.png  The opacity of your content box is too low, and the text is kind of iffy to read depending on the picture that shows up. The last thing you want is for people to not be able to read your thing - finding out how you help them should never ever be work for the customer.   Find the right barber the first time.   No. This is iffy and weird, you can do better OP! Don't be afraid to shoot for the moon, you guys are offering a unique service that can make men's lives easier, find a way to speak to that. Avoid being generic. What does the customer want the most? What's their dream, OP? To find the perfect barber?   We are helping barbers find more clients and clients find better barbers.  For more details on what we are doing visit our blog here: blog.ratemybarber.com   Your value prop here is good, connecting barbers and clients and clients and barbers, but do we need to say the same thing twice, or just say it once in the right way?    We are currently taking Beta Users! If you would like to be a beta user please sign up below.    Do you take a user? Perhaps over on Pornhub, but you're a classy barber startup! You're currently accepting new users into your closed beta, because again, you're classy mofos.  Your CTA button is ""Notify me"". People get notified when something goes live, not when they sign up to be a beta user. This is confusing with the text above. Does this mean that you might take me if I qualify? Are there criteria to be in the beta? What's going on here?  Overall not bad OP! You just need to put a little more love into it and connect with the customer more.

I would love it if you could check out our site http://dabblenews.com/  I won't say too much about what we are since I would love feedback if our site conveys that clearly, but I will let you know that we are a social news website aiming to help users share and discuss interesting news articles with their friends! Thanks for doing this!"
startups,3abie6,Robby_Rob,2,Thu Jun 18 22:18:44 2015 UTC,"Hey! No problem.  Okay here we go!  Block #1   Discover. Share. Discuss.  It's social news harmony.   Okay, so your whole ""discover, share discuss"" thing here is not bad. It's what a lot of other people doing what you do are using though, so you may want to alternate some of the words (seriously I did three of these this week) so you don't run into a ""messaging snowblindness"" situation and lose users because they've already heard it the same way 5x already.  ""It's social news harmony""  Say that out loud for me five times OP. Does that sound interesting? Does it sound kind of silly? Does it sound like someone was trying a little hard to sound different and cool and kinda belly flopped a bit?  Just a little.  What does Dabble really do? It cures your information overload, kills white noise, helps you reclaim your time and helps you focus on the information you care about! News doesn't have to be boring, just think about what people really want from the service and give it to 'em like your app already does.    Features Blocks   Your little blocks here aren't the worst, they could be tightened up a bit, more actionable (aka they help me visualize in my head what makes this app the greatest damn thing since sliced bread).  Let's look at the ""Discover"" block real quick.   Discover  News tailored to fit your tastes. Designed just for you.   You just said the same thing twice, why not combine these sentences into one strong statement that makes me want to sign up, OP?   Now for the things you're missing!  No FAQ page. People are going to have questions about anything they have to install on their phone. I know it seems silly, especially if you don't have a complete MVP right now, but it helps people convert when you overcome their objections (aka: questions).   You don't have a contact page or an about page. Would you install an app on your phone, or hell, just give up your information to some company that doesn't even have a facebook fanpage or something? I wouldn't, most users that would want to use an app like this probably wouldn't either.  You need to establish some trust here; even if it's a free app, people are skeptical. You have to show them you're trustworthy, that there are great benefits, and get 'em to sign up!"

startups,3abie6,Robby_Rob,2,Thu Jun 18 22:23:10 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow Texan!  This might get a little rough and tumble, but it comes from a place of love.  Block #1   Is your website your top salesman? If not, don’t worry, it can be.   Oh. It's, the, Walken, pause, to exacerbate, the situation and, build suspense.  Except it looks weird and makes me wonder if you outsourced your writing to someone whose first language is not English. Not great buddy. This little line here, your tagline, should tell me what you guys are all about. Instead it tells me that my business probably isn't all it could be, but it might be maybe one day.   Which is pretty much like you just told me my business has a small penis. And offered me a free consultation. Because it might help.  You can present this a better way! Avoid the Walken Pause, avoid pointing out my business' small penis!   Block #2   Pixelguard Manages Your Online Presence  You Manage Your Business   Let's be real here, OP: how many other webshops in DFW are offering the exact same premise to get people to sign on? This is super generic, you can do better.  We know you're going to do the annoying marketing crap so we can focus on what matters... making our business successful, but you need to work on making your side of things more interesting. Nothing makes a business owner's eyes glaze over faster than using the words ""Online Presence""  I'm looking at the text block here, I know you have to balance between informative content and SEO bleh that will help you climb the SERPs so I'm gonna go easy on you here...  That being said, you could try to blend together your terms and the text here a little better. It just feels like you're packing it with terms (which I totally understand) and people are going to ignore the content.   Your social proof in this block with all the stats about users is great. Leave that alone!  Block #3   The Internet Is A Big Place  Let Us Help You Outsmart Your Competitors   You can do better here, OP. Really. Of course the internet is a big place, but how are you going to help me outsmart my competitors? This is the opening statement for a big infodump which most people are going to struggle to get through without skimming. You need to give 'em some meat, make them invested.  What are you really offering? How are you going to make their lives easier in ONE single sentence? What's the payoff here for making me read 8 facts (as far as I know as a businessman you made up all these facts and are lying out your pie hole), if these facts are true, why not link to a credible source for the most important fact to establish your credibility and legitimize this wall of text I'm scrolling through?  Block #4   How Do We Increase Your Business?  Through Inbound Marketing   Man I'm gonna say something here that's not terribly nice: your customer doesn't give a damn about pixelguard. They care about their problems. You need to frame everything you do on this page about them, their business, their problems.  ""Inbound Marketing is the Solution to Get Noticed Online""  I just addressed their problem and stated a solution in 9 words. No infodump required, no crazy piles of statistics, just pure, simple problem:solution presentation.  Block #5   Inbound Marketing Methodology   Your little in-flow-graphic here isn't bad! I can't say the same for the tidbit under it.  Are you interested in improving your business with inbound marketing? Let’s Talk  This person is about to spend thousands of dollars a year with you (if not more!) and all you can muster is ""improving your business"" and ""let's talk"".   You can do better than this OP. What are three direct benefits of improving their online presence that they'll see in the first six months? STATE THOSE, and use something other than ""let's talk"". Businesses don't want to talk. They want to hand you a pile of money and watch their cares melt away (most of us do, when you think about it), capitalize on their fears and desires to get them to click the button!  And make this look like something I can click! It just looks like a bit of text that deadends at the end of the page. Like you just lead me all the way down here to the bottom of your page so you could have a laugh and run away.   Block #6 - What You're Missing  Benefits! Where are they?! As a practitioner of the dark art of long-form squeeze pages, even I think hiding the benefits of inbound marketing under a pile of perhaps-imaginary statistics which might make a business owner fearful and quit reading altogether, well, it's just not good copy.  Pricing page! I can't find it! How much am I gonna have to pay for this thing? You want me to come to you and you don't give me a general idea of how much this novel thing that's going to transform the way I do business forever is gonna cost me? Well I'm not gonna call you!  Speaking of calling - where is your phone number? Your contact email? It's not on the landing page!   Where's the FAQ page? Sure you cater to probably a dozen different kinds of businesses, but there are overlaps and an FAQ page can help you address questions before they become objections and eventual barriers to the sale."

startups,3abie6,glitterlok,2,Thu Jun 18 23:27:04 2015 UTC,"I still can't believe Sourceforge is gone :(   Block #1  Your tag at the top gets everything across just fine. I don't know why you have a login and a sign up button together. You need to put your login button somewhere else, and make it look different from your sign up button! People get confused by that kind of thing.  And ""Sign Up"" is pretty boring. ""Get Funded"" ""Create Your Free Hub Now"" or just about anything else that prompts the user to action to get them to mash that little orange button is going to be better than a simple ""Sign up"" button.  Block #2   You have your code, but your project also needs:  Powerful community discussions  Rewarding of project backers  Paid support system to simplify deals and payment   If you were telling someone at a tradeshow about your offering and they asked you why they should join, would you say  ""POWERFUL COMMUNITY DISCUSSIONS, REWARDING OF PROJECT BACKERS, AND PAID SUPPORT SYSTEM TO SIMPLIFY DEALS AND PAYMENT!""  No, because you would sound crazy and be asked to leave. No one wants to look crazy, but it's sometimes hard to remember that your landing page is a conversation between you and the customer. Your language has to be succinct, yes, but it also needs to be natural and flow together. What are the best three benefits of your service? Figure them out and put them here.  Block #3  You could literally combine backing and powered by stripe (Seriously: ""Project Backing: Powered by Stripe"") and find a fourth awesome feature to show off here.   Things You're Missing  You don't have an FAQ page. You kinda need one, especially when you're running a service that depends on revenue to survive.  Your payment page is very programmery, but people who back stuff may not necessarily be programmers and you might want to make this a bit easier to figure out than demanding the user do math. A calculator app in a skin that matches the site for both paid support/backing might help, there are lots of ways to do that.  I don't instantly know how to contact you. It took me a bit to notice that floating orange thing down in the corner, the live message thing. On larger desktops/screens this may present a problem, on mobile it looks fine.  Details. I should be able to click on ""Paid Support"" and land on a page that explains how paid support works. Same with all the other features.   Other than that it's not bad. GL OP!"

startups,3abie6,Breakpoint,2,Fri Jun 19 23:19:45 2015 UTC,Would love to hear your thoughts on our landing page as we are still making some tweaks: http://tryadhawk.com/
startups,3abie6,Breakpoint,2,Thu Jun 18 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"Alright customer #1!  Quick TLDR;  You're focusing heavily on features here instead of benefits. People have a hard time translating features to benefits in their minds, so that's our job as the salesman. It's not a bad page, just follow the notes below and start translating your features into benefits so they'll mash that mighty orange button and help you move forward!  Block #1   Online Advertising Simplified   How does this appeal to the user? Doesn't every ad-thinga-majig promise to simplify my online advertising? Differentiate or die, my friend! What does adHawk do better than everyone else? Is it fast to set up? Does it simplify data analysis, help make it easier to make decisions on cross channel platforms? There are so many ways to frame this!   Sign up for adHawk today and we'll let you know when we launch   You haven't told me why I should sign up yet! You may want to move this under the benefits or get a stronger tag here. Also, the ""Sign Up!"" CTA button could be punchier. ""I want in!"" or something like that will make this shine a bit better.   Understand your online advertising across multiple accounts.  Set benchmarks to measure performance.  View data in real-time on your mobile device.   These are solid benefits, but you could word them better. Right now it's just super generic stuff that doesn't make me excited. I can set benchmarks to measure performance on virtually EVERY platform and that's more of a feature - what's the benefit of setting benchmarks? Find the benefit!  Block #2 ""Save Time and Money""  Shit son, and is all slanty and now you have my attention!   From Google AdWords to Facebook Ads, adHawk gives you a bird's eye view into your digital advertising data in seconds. The days of logging in and out of accounts to measure performance are over. Support for other ad services soon to come.   Well this comes off as if you guys are trying to sound big but aren't there yet. Try this instead:  adHawk brings all of your digital advertising data together in one place, giving you a bird's eye view to make intelligent marketing decisions in seconds.   (your little pictures tell me what you support, and it doesn't matter what you support right this second because you're pre-launch!)  Block #3: Benefits  These benefits are kind of weak and generic. I say this out of love OP, I know it's not easy to translate programmerese into business-y speak.   On The Go   We get it, it's a mobile app. But what's the benefit? The ability to manage all my data in one    Benchmarked Data   Data benchmarking is common, but this is no common app OP! Benchmarking gives us actionable insights that allow us to move our ad money around and get the most benefit. Try to find a way to make the feature of benchmarking into an honest-to-goodness benefit.   Simple Graphs   Another feature, not a benefit. What's a benefit of being able to look at a simple graph instead of mounds of data? Put this into words, OP!  Block #4   Understand Your Advertising  Sign up for Free   ""Sign Up"" is a term most people are blind to. How can we make this shit more actionable, OP? What do they get by signing up? Demonstrate the benefit and they're going to click that little orange button with all their might!"

startups,3abie6,JamesYazda,2,Thu Jun 18 21:48:15 2015 UTC,Hi /u/terpin ! I'm not sure if you are still providing feedback but I would love to get some on our landing page: Nicaragua Motorcycle Adventures Much appreciated!
startups,3abie6,thinglistr,3,Thu Jun 18 20:01:50 2015 UTC,"Block #1  The thing about these kinds of pages is that you have to balance interesting stuff for humans to read and smart SEO stuff to make sure you get indexed.   Example:   HAVE FUN RIDING A MOTORCYCLE IN NICARAGUA!  NICA MOTO ADV IS THE FIRST AND BEST IN NICARAGUA   Your tag up above is obviously pulling for SEO, but I'm not sure why you condensed your company name into abbreviations that don't make much sense here. You can just type out the whole name, it'll help people remember you and keep you in mind as they scroll down the page. I'm also not sure from the start if you're offering motorcycle tours (you call yourself ""adventures"") or if you're just renting bikes. You need to make this apparent as soon as possible.  In the Nicaragua and About Us sections, there are some grammatical errors and it's not as amazing as it could be. You might want to hire a native english speaker that'll bring this up a few notches. Here's an example:   Nicaragua   Ride along scenic country roads, visit colonial towns, climb volcanos, have coffee at a plantation, relax, enjoy the sunset in a beautiful beach. Experience this and much more in Nicaragua.    My edit:  Nicaragua is one of the few places in the world where you can start your day by racing on a motorcycle along pastoral country roads, stop in a centuries-old colonial town for lunch, climb a volcano in the afternoon and finish off the day by lounging on a world-class beach and watching the sun sink below the horizon.   Come see the best Central America has to offer with Nicaragua Motorcycle Adventures!   The people in Nicaragua are friendly, they love to smile and make you feel welcomed. The scenery of the country will amaze you but the people will make you come back.  The country is the safest one in Central America according to the United Nations making a great destination to visit by motorcycle.   Now, we all know that Central America has had some problems in the past, but there are ways to frame the safety of Nicaragua without saying it's the safest in Central America (that just makes me think it's the least dangerous in the region). You'd think that people that like to ride motorcycles wouldn't be afraid of things, but they are.  Block #2: Rent a Motorcycle  The picture here is not bad, but it could be better. (especially when I scroll down and see how much I have to pay per day to rent a bike! not a judgment, but we have to rise to customer's expectations, right?)  You need a native speaker to come in here and rewrite everything. Some sections are longer than others (tool kit is so short!), and many could be pared down a lot to save the reader time and get your message across more clearly.  Block #3: Additional Services  Again, you'll need someone to come back in here and fix it. I'm going to pick a section and show you what I mean.   Online Training  There is no substitute to learning and training on top of a motorbike. We know that. However, we believe that learning is the combination of theory  and practice. In particular when planning a motorcycle trip it is important to understand the theory and checklists (e.g. what to pack) to have a fun motorcycle trip!   My edit: ""While there's no substitute for real-world riding experience, a little planning can go a long way. We offer online training and preparedness checklists that'll help you plan the perfect trip and have a great time when you're here!""  Block #4 Motorcycle Rental Prices  I don't know why the previous block and this block are so far apart, or why the information in this block is all smooshed down at the bottom of the page.  Not good, fix this!  Quick TLDR;  There is no FAQ section on your landing page. No phone number, no contact information (you have the big green button down below but that's not helpful, ""Contact"" isn't even listed in the sitemap down below.) You need to fix this. You've gotta get my trust as soon as possible, if I have to fight my way through tons of text to figure out the answer to my question I'm going to quit and just go find someone else to work with.   Please, please find a native speaker to help you redo your text. It's going to make you guys so much more trustworthy! Good luck OP!"
startups,3abie6,thinglistr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:45:24 2015 UTC,I'll bite.  www.Twixxies.com
startups,3abie6,GilfOG,2,Thu Jun 18 22:07:20 2015 UTC,"Quick TLDR;  You need to first differentiate yourselves and demonstrate the value you're providing the customer. What makes Twixxies different? What are the BENEFITS of your offering? Why is there only one signup/cta button on the page (aside from the pricing one way down there at the bottom), these are some major barriers that you're going to have to overcome.  Block #1  This is your prop block, the very first thing I see when I come to your site.   First, your tagline is generic and vague, every service doing what your doing promises that they're the one thing that's going to help people sell on mobile... but you have to SHOW them how you're going to do it. Figuring this out can be an enormous pain in the ass but once you do you're good for years.   Twixxies gives you the professional tools to reach into every corner of your customers lifestyle with native apps for Apple, Android, Tablets, and Mobile Websites. Sell where your customers are - mobile devices.   Lots of hype, but how? How do you do this? You state a benefit at the end (sell where your customers are - mobile devices) but I shouldn't have to sludge through tons of text that feels like you're just trying to hit your LSI targets to get indexed better and rise in the SERPs. This needs to be clean, clear and make me want to click that call to action button right below this block of text...  But there is no call to action button! If I was ready to sign up right now, I couldn't. Because all I see here is that you're on Android, iOS and mobile. And you offer a ""14 day free trial"" (differentiate or die, find a way to frame this to be unique to your offering), but I can't click on that either. So I continue to slog down the screen. Or just go back to Google and find someone else.   Block #2  I'm guessing this is a benefits block, (""Build relationships"", ""Professional Tools"") but you're mixing the two together. It's a bit like putting M&Ms and skittles together in a bowl, nobody knows what they're getting here.  Build relationships is a solid benefit, but professional tools are a feature. Users just honestly don't care about features, they care about solutions to their problems. It's your job to show them that you can fix this thing that's bugging the hell out of them.  In your slider it's the same story. ""Deep Linking,"", ""Affiliate Program"", ""Multi Languages"" and ""Beautiful Designs"" are all features of your offering. How do these features translate into tangible benefits that the users NEED?  Block #3   ""Shopping & Lifestyle Apps Grew 174% Year-Over-Year""   Okay that sounds great, but again, how does this relate to Twixxies? You namedrop to borrow credibility here companies like Forbes, Kissmetrics and Flurry, but you're not doing it the right way. You need to find a way to borrow that social credibility and build yourself up. Just saying the name of a big brand and then throwing down your CTA button isn't going to bring customers in. You need to provide proof and value, not just a random statistic, y'know?  I get down to the very bottom of your page and I FINALLY see some pricing. Fantastic. But there's no FAQ down here at the bottom to sway people who are on the fence about your offering. It just dead-ends there like a gangrenous limb telling me that plans start at $399 without really telling me why I would want to sign up. No link to the pricing page either to see if there are other packages/pricing offerings. Does sign up require a credit card? What happens after my trial period is over? There are so many objections that arise here at the bottom of the page and I get no answers. Not good!"

I'm talking to my co-founder now and we're really trying to find ways to fix these issues.  Terribly hard when you code it all.  So I just asked a customer on skype, ""hey, what value do we bring to your business?""  Our name is just a combination of ""what the hell is available"" and ""has to be short and not super lame"".  Oh and don't forget, it was actually available and not thousands of dollars!"
startups,3abie6,bsie,2,Fri Jun 19 04:12:07 2015 UTC,"I work with this fellow that sells most of the fake gold/street fashion jewelry you find over on Amazon (he brings me in for seasonal stuff so Amazon doesn't come after him, they are SUPER finicky over there), he paid something like $5k for fakegold.com last fall - and that was AFTER a bunch of haggling.  Total insanity.  Honestly though, that's REALLY the way to figure out your messaging and how to talk to your customers. We call it a ""question funnel"" or ""survey funnel"", where you basically ask general questions at first to your users, then narrow it down more and more so you can find out what they want, what they like and what they hate so you can target your user better. I think a lot of us have this crazy philosophy of ""we'll build it and they'll come"" and it's so goddamn ass backwards. Everything starts with the user, then you build it up from there.  Just keep in mind that while you may be the absolute best at coding features and the like, you might require a translator to help you go from ""programmerese"" to English. Successful people delegate, blah blah blah."

startups,3abie6,aubreyfight,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:28:39 2015 UTC,"Block #1: More Engaging And Objective Opinion Polls  Your tagline at the top, ""See the Bigger Picture"" is very generic to the analytics field. Thin about what CrossPoll really as to offer and zero in on something that makes you guys stand out.   ""More Engaging And Objective Opinion Polls""   You'll want to avoid using the word ""more"" unless you're actually giving them something ""more"" (like more time, more money).   Try:  ""The Easiest Way to Make Engaging and Objective Opinion Polls""  ""Create Objective and Engaging Polls in a Few Clicks""  Find something that doesn't just sound like a ""half-thought"" and you'll be good.  Your benefits listed here aren't bad, you might want to revise them a bit later. Your CTA button again isn't bad either, but you may want to change it up every once in awhile to something like ""Create a Poll (yes it's free!)"". You're offering something cool, present it that way :)  Block #2  I like how you've mixed up benefits into an FAQ format here, it'll play pretty well with bloggers. For now it's not bad for an early prototype alpha offering, but you'll want to improve it as time goes on. You might want to include a contact and about page at some point, too!"

startups,3abie6,H_o,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:30:33 2015 UTC,"Block #1  Your little tag up above, ""Where women go for a better workplace"" is awesome - but   ""Make it Possible to have it all""    is borderline cringey. I know your heart is in the right place here, but it just feels like inauthentic pleading.  First, have you ever said your tagline here out loud? Try saying it out loud a few times and see how it sounds to you. Sounds kind of weird and unnatural, right? This little sentence needs to tell me exactly what you guys are about, and what you have is kinda meh.  As a woman in a highly competitive field I can relate to what you're doing here, but I also know it's impossible to have it all. Most of us know that we can't have it all, no matter how upsetting that is. So when I see some awkward phrasing of how I can have it all as a woman, I'm gonna just shrug.  We don't have to have it all, but we do have to have a better place to work that isn't going to treat us like crap because we might need to take parental leave in a year or two when we have our first kid. There are so many ways to tap into that, you can do it!  Your CTA button is good, I'd leave it alone.  Block #4  ""How it Works""  That picture for ""Involve your coworkers"" is hilarious in all the wrong ways. You may want to find a picture where a woman isn't clasping her hands and absent-mindedly laughing at something in the distance.  Block #5  Your social proof block, are these outlets that have reviewed what you guys are doing? Why not put a little ""InHerSight in the Media"" title above this?  You might also want a quick FAQ section on your landing page or create a page and link to it.  Also, one of the most important objections you'll have to overcome (especially since the site is anonymous) - how do i know these are authentic reviews? How do I know that a company hasn't just paid interns to spend a week generating good ratings for their company?"

I DO THE THING THAT YOU NEED ME TO!  You don't want to ALL CAPS something because it feels like you were shouting. If I walked into your store to buy an affordable dynamometer for brushless motors and as soon as I walked inside you started screaming at me, I'd walk away, quickly.  Does this affordable dynamometer have a name? You might want to include that here. Your subhead ""measure torque, thrust, efficiency and more"" is good, you can leave it alone.  The picture... well. It looks like you guys tried your best cutting it out of the background but still had some trouble with it. It's not bad, it's just kind of weird on this BRIGHT LOUD ORANGE BACKGROUND, it's all very loud. I don't know much about dynamometers, but I'm going to guess they're not this exciting all the time.  The alternating bright orange and bright white is giving me a headache. It's kind of crazy. Ahh!  Block #2  This block is a weird mix of features an benefits. ""Measurement Circuit"" could use some benefitization (not a real world, but what's the benefit of this?). ""Graphical User Interface"" is too feature-y. Is the GUI easy to use? Put that in the title. Same with ""Online Database"". What's the benefit of the online database that you can put into 3-4 words?  Block #3 ""Specs""  This looks imbalanced. Tons of measurement capabilities on one side, then two outputs on the other side. There has to be a way to present this information where it doesn't make one side seem like it's lacking (even though it's not, it's just a presentation thing).  Block #4 ""Kickstarter""  This is fine.   You might want an FAQ section, and if you don't feel like blogging, you don't have to have a blog.

That combined with the realization that I didn't have the business chops to mitigate risks of building the company I wanted to.  I left my second company when my cofounder left. I didn't think I could run it alone. In hindsight, I should have shut it down sooner, as we were not making progress, and I wasn't being disciplined or intentional about getting us on a path to success.

A start-up needs tons of passion to survive and constantly providing that passion is what makes a start-up so challenging."

Maybe not every day, but I'm caught up on all the startups they publish within a couple days.  I've also emailed them before and the owner responded quickly and was very helpful.  But I wonder if it's right for me.  Yes, my customers are startups...so it is potentially the right audience.  But, how many visitors did you receive?  You paid $0.38 per lead.  I'm curious how much you paid per visitor to compare it to Google AdWords.  At the cost of $99, I'd need to get 1414 visits from betalist to get it to compare with AdWords.  However, it could be argued that being on betalist starts to at least spread your company name, even if the person doesn't click through to your site.  The money isn't really an issue, if the overall marketing is just the plan.  What I'm struggling with now is that they want you to be private.  It makes sense.  Though in my situation, my mvp is almost done.  So it just seems weird to publish on betalist to then wait artificially to start trying to get visitors from AdWords.  I'm a firm believer that your product should never be free.  So should I really launch a new product on betalist that's ready to sale and not provider a ""free beta"" account?  I suppose this is a question I should ask Marc (the owner).  Maybe betalist should only be used for companies looking for un-paid users.  I believe users should be paying from day 1, otherwise you're really not solving a problem for them."

Let me try and address some of the questions you have:   But I wonder if it's right for me. Yes, my customers are startups...so it is potentially the right audience. But, how many visitors did you receive? You paid $0.38 per lead. I'm curious how much you paid per visitor to compare it to Google AdWords.   I'm not a huge fan of comparing CPA's in this way, because you tend to get very different types of leads depending on the source. That said, since you're targeting startups specifically it might be less of an issue here.  Keep in mind that you're talking about a $0.38 CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) not a CPC (Cost Per Click). I don't have a lot of experience with AdWords, but I doubt they can match that. We have a pretty flexible refund policy, so if it turns out the fee of the expedited review wasn't worth it I'm happy to issue a full refund.  The results between featured startups do vary quite a bit, so you'll likely end up with different numbers, but especially since you're targeting startups I think BetaList will get you a much higher ROI.    What I'm struggling with now is that they want you to be private. It makes sense. Though in my situation, my mvp is almost done. So it just seems weird to publish on betalist to then wait artificially to start trying to get visitors from AdWords.   The reason for us only accepting pre-launch startups is because we've found that a very clear way of distinguishing between really new startups and older ones. It's far from perfect, but at least it's a pretty clear policy that prevents uncertainty.  You could just feature it now on BetaList and go live a week later. That's perfectly fine with us. That way you have a week to work out all the bugs and integrate the feedback you receive from BetaList users which will ultimately increase your AdWords ROI.   I'm a firm believer that your product should never be free.    I agree it's not a business, until you have paying customers. That said, I don't think you need them from day one. What you do need is a certain type of commitment, but that can come in variety of invested currency. Having your users invest money (i.e. pay) is certainly one way, but having them invest their time or other scarce resources also tells you you are on to something. You have to be very careful with this as you don't want to listen to the wrong feedback (i.e. of those that will never become a customer anyway), but I wouldn't rule out a free tier when starting out so you can initiate a discussion, rather than risk losing out on potential future customers."

If (a), the credit card processors usually deposit funds to your account on a rolling basis.  That's how stripe works.  So your customer's card is charged, and then x days later, it's deposited into your account.  If (b), there are a number of methods to do this.  However, I suggest you look into Stripe's Connect: https://stripe.com/connect  They charge your customer and then allow you to re-route some of that money to other people.  The alternative is to set up your own system with ACH (automated clearing house) which would allow you to deposit money from your bank account into other's bank accounts.  Stripe includes that feature.  Another option are ""payment cards.""  Where you issue the people you want to send money to a debit card.  The provider of that service then takes the money from you and deposits it onto the cards for you (this is very popular for payroll with employees that don't have bank accounts).    So, three options for (b): 1) Stripe's connect/marketplace service, 2) your own ACH through a bank or other provider, or 3) through payment cards."

It doesn't sound like you signed a copyright agreement transfer so as of now you own 100% of everything you created. If there were multiple people who actually worked on the designs (not just providing ideas) than the situation get's a little more difficult to assess.   Also, registration of a copyright is not required for protection to be recognized in Canada. They will need to go through you before using any of your work.

For new businesses with limited funding I always like to say the old expression ""pick a niche and get rich"". Don't try to do everything under the sun.  Get sales rolling in right away. A lot of new companies put way too much time/energy into aspects of their business that don't really get the needle moving. Instagram promotions/shoutout's will probably convert well for you  (fitness, fashion, beauty, etc, convert well on Instagram).  If you plan on starting online some key concepts to focus on would be: always review your numbers and try to lower your costs without decreasing your quality, increase your conversions, increase purchase frequency, increase the average sale price and increase the amount of targeted visitors to your site.  Treat your first few customers like family and get a lot of feedback from them.  If you don't have an accountant on board from the beginning use software like LessAccounting. Keep track of your  cash flow."

I have learned 10x as much from my first business ventures than I have from business school! That being said:   Make sure that you do your market research. I always see comments about ""niching down"" which is nice, but the fitness apparel line is one that is very flooded with competition, companies with great awareness of their target market and very intense and loyal customer bases. I started a more casual apparel company with the design themed around fitness and we got great feedback and support on social media, we spent months just promoting our brand while we built our online store behind the scenes, we were thrilled to launch... out of all the people that ranted/raved and said they wanted our gear, about 5% actually purchased.   My advice, set up an online store - check out shopify or a similar source if web design isn't your thing. Get everything up and running almost to the point where you are ready to launch (short of taking billing information) and see how many people actually click on the ""buy now"" button. This should help give you a more realistic feel of what you can expect once you are ready to put your money down.   This process can be a pain, but it could help you not end up with a garage full of athletic apparel gathering dust."

An easy way to get started could be to go to a local independent health food store, a specialty food store, or a boutique. Typically, these stores focus on local, artisan goods."

Just because MailChimp is making a lot of money doesn't mean that every other player in the market is too.

Bootstrap while you find some traction, then raise money on results instead of better pricing (which means you make less money per customer than mail chimp) and features (which not everyone will be convinced matters). With some traction you can say you will get more people even if lower and the features clearly matter. Then raise money, lose some equity, but increase the value of what remains."
startups,3aak04,ryanakron,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:15:04 2015 UTC,Yes I can see how this would be a very effective way to get off the ground and retain all of the equity until it needs the extra money to accelerate and innovate.

I personally am against people that do door to door things and I get heavily turned off when people leave business cards on my wipers and door jambs.  Right now though, I'm mostly trying to line up cars for friends and family and doing their jobs for half off, $25/hr for the detail which will basically just end up with me and my friend only profitting minimum wage and paying for our equipment.  Another incentive I'm considering adding is to polish my friends' and family's car for a $50/hr rate since they're helping in investing towards my DA."
startups,3a8oab,CaptainRedbeardish,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:55:59 2015 UTC,"I'm in complete agreement here. I dislike flyers on my windshield. And the friends & family route is not going to help like you think. Friends & Family (almost) never gets a business going. You need complete strangers.  There's a way to say, ""Hey, I'm gonna be here all day. Send me a tweet or email, come hand me the keys, I'll detail it and have it back to you in X minutes (90?)"". Provide collateral. Maybe a standard written statement, that you'll return the car in the same condition (just cleaner).  You want a non-invasive way. It's called organic advertising. A natural word of mouth. What if you hung out with food trucks? Follow food trucks on twitter. Find em, and hang out next to them. Food trucks hang outside offices during lunch hours and at night at breweries and like places. ""Concierge Service for the Busy Californian"" - have a chalkboard sign of some sort, and hire someone with excellent penmenship (eg: 1, 2, 3). Express that you'll be back to that exact location next week, and please come book a time slot. Ask the food truck owner, Stan, if you can offer a discount to all people who make a purchase from Stan's Taco Truck.  If you work 5 days a week, set up 5 office building areas. And do one a day. If a day fills up, ask them if they can do the following week and give them 10% off for booking early. Before you know it you'll be expanding your business. But the booking part has to be completely painless. A calendar of time slots online requiring Name, Business Address, Phone Number. And don't forget to push reviews online if they enjoyed their experience. All you want is to make sure the client has only 3 things to do: Book, Drop Keys, Pay. Use square for payments in-person, or something square-like. Or pay through the system online.  There's your strategy. You owe me a car wash.  Edit: Definitely run an Instagram & Twitter account to show off all the cars. Ask in booking form if the car has a name, and then post ""Eleanor this morning"". And don't forget to duplicate the same posts to Google+. You'll gain lots of SEO posting pics to Google+, and you can build good reviews there too."
startups,3a8oab,bunmango,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:49:56 2015 UTC,Is there are plenty of car enthusiasts there should be meet ups and small conventions. Try to visit and talk with people there who would use your service. Don't even approach them as potential customers in the beginning. Just talk with them and ask about what drives them (no pun intended) and what they normally do for cleaning and stuff. You will find your competitors and will know what you should be doing.
startups,3a8oab,bunmango,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:45:04 2015 UTC,"Check out www.autopia.org if you haven't already. It's dedicated to detailing, both hobbyists and professionals.  The site has gotten quite a bit more commercialized since I was active there over 10 years ago but there is a lot of good content.  There was a guy based in West Covina (Superior Shine, I think?) who was pretty active on the forum (not sure if he still is) - I met him at a meetup at Meguiar's a while ago when they flew in a few of Autopia's top contributors.  You'll find that the higher end detailers charge are able to charge a good amount of money...  Also, good paint care is all about the prep - primarily around paint correction, as you mentioned.  Adding protection on top of swirl marks really doesn't do much and ""real"" detailers will look down on you.  You mentioned not having much practice with this - go to a junkyard and buy a few body panels to practice on.  Don't worry too much about wet sanding - you'd be surprised at what you can fix with an orbital and a good compound. Back when I was into detailing I used a bunch of Meguiar's Pro line - their Dual Action Compound Polish and Swirl Free Polish were as abrasive as I went.  But this was like 15 years ago, I'm sure they have some new stuff.  I never got into using a rotary but from what I've seen they can save you a lot of time if you know what you're doing... However, you can really muck up a job (or even burn through the paint) if you don't, causing buffer swirls and holograms all over the place.  I definitely don't want to discourage you, but I considered starting a mobile detailing business in your area (based in Diamond Bar) - at the end of the day I felt that it was too much manual labor and that scaling the business while maintaining quality and profitability would be next to impossible... Ended up using my degree and working in Tech :)  Side note - look into rinseless/hoseless washes, I hear Optimum No-Rinse is the new standard these days..."

However, the owner of the domain has a name of Nissan, and if he wants to sell cars that's up to him. I think a court would have to show he was deliberately trading off someone else's good name prior to confiscating the domain.  (I do wish he'd drop the flag-waving/freedom iconography though - I condemn using the legal system to bully people, but I don't think the corporation's behaviour amounts to fascism)."

The problem in your example is that no-one would believe you, but in his case, his name really is Nissan. I don't think he changed it based on the name of the motor company.  The question I think is whether he was passing off as the motor company, and on that question I don't know. Is there any evidence one way or the other?  I recall Mattel attempted to sue a woman who opened a shop called Barbie's in the US. She successfully defended the suit, and was able to show she was not attempting to trade on the name of the toy, and that she had been called by that name for many years unrelated to the trademark (linky evades me presently, but it will be online)."

Negotiation 101 - never make the first move or name the first price. If they want the domain, they will get in touch. (fyi - BusinessInsider has many articles about negotiation tactics.)  All the best."
startups,3a6zzs,ckellock,2,Wed Jun 17 22:33:45 2015 UTC,"Actually negotiation 101 generally says you should make the first price. ""Let them make the first move"" is a common misconception for people who haven't actually studied negotiation theory.   Making the first move is called ""anchoring"". It anchors the conversation. If you're selling a TV, and you want to sell it, and the other person really wants to buy it, then you're both invested in the sell happening. If you want to sell it for $300, but your opponent anchors at $100, then suddenly you're having to talk him up $200 which just isn't possible. So you settle for much less. Whereas if you anchored at $400 then he would have to settle at $300."
startups,3a6zzs,verossiraptors,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:00:27 2015 UTC,"It depends on the situation. In this case he has all of the leverage so he doesn't necessarily want to name a price. If they lowball him he can ignore them or simply say no and they have no other option, but to try again with a higher number.

You can anchor at top or bottom of the price range, but not way above or way below. Some prices, for some goods, are simply outrageous.  In this case, there isn't really a known price range.

But if you really want to just bootstrap then you should try X front end development + Firebase system (back-end) and them move to aws after you get a high level of traffic.

It's been a challenge for us. :)   I run Hump the Bundle,  a NSFW porn parody of a very popular game bundle site.  We launched 6 months ago, have revenues of $100,000, have raised over $30,000 for charity, and I think we're around 6 or 7,000 customers at this point.   Social media has been a major challenge for us as you might expect.  If you owned my website, what would you do?"
startups,3a89j7,parasocks,2,Thu Jun 18 00:34:48 2015 UTC,"O_O So I viewed your site...  Seriously great concept. Kudos on your 100K. It's one of those business that you should've thought of because it's right in front of you.  You are sitting on a gold mine. Reddit loves stuff like this. I would definitely get involved in some subs. You could try advertising on Reddit but it's janky. Like measuring clicks is really hard.  Facebook isn't welcoming, however Twitter is. You could try Facebook, but expect for your page to get deleted.  Just be tasteful. Educate and inform.  I would try to reach out to some stars of the industry. Everyone can get behind a good cause.   Have you reached out to journalist? HARPO (or Help A Reporter Out) is always looking for things to write about. Also you may get picked up by a major publication."
startups,3a89j7,parasocks,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:45:54 2015 UTC,"Nice thanks! We've been able to measure clicks from Reddit ads by using Google's ""URL Builder"" which lets us make big long stupid URL's that track results in Analytics for us.   Reddit has been huge for us, Twitter not so much, but we have a new project that's starting to show results on Twitter too.. I think almost 500 followers in maybe 5 days or something. More than HTB has after 6 months!   We thought more pornstars would be attracted to the charity aspect but so far nothing has materialized. It's mostly ""fuck you pay me"" I think. :)   I'll try Harpo that's a great idea. We've been in Slate, Cosmopolitan, Daily Dot, and Dr. Drew even invited us onto his show. We'll need to reach out more. Our first sale I expected a lot of interest from media, but literally 30 days went by and not a single person responded to me. :) Then finally something clicked in sale 2 and things picked up a bit. I think we needed to show some sales first."

From what I understand you get a lot of likes from unengaged people, which in the long run drives down your overall post reach. Is this true? And does selecting a target audience help in avoiding this issue.  2 - What's the best way to define your target in these kinds of posts/adds?  3 - Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google Plus. Do you have any opinions on the pros and cons of each one?  Thanks in advance"
startups,3a89j7,needawp,2,Thu Jun 18 01:46:25 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I've built and managed communities of over 500k on FB.    Yes, absolutely. Don't just click boost post though. Do it in the ads editor and get way more specific.  It depends. If you have an existing email list upload that and create a 1% lookalike. Use that as the target.  Twitter is worth it. Instagram depends (Although paid instagram is coming later) and Google+ is only worth it if you're doing an SEO play"
startups,3a89j7,geeklimit,2,Thu Jun 18 19:30:34 2015 UTC,"/u/needawp have some great points.  Facebook algorithm is getting ridiculous. I have clients who have to spend money to see the same reach they used to see just by posting.   With ads you can control everything and really decide how much you want to spend. It really depends on your goals. Try them both.  Pro tip: Review your best content and boost it.  Instagram - has a rolled out for everyone yet. But if you can find someone in your industry with a lot of  followers, you can pay for a shout out. This can be expensive depending on the follower size.   Facebook - Much cheaper than Google, Twitter, and Instagram (influencers). You can show your ads to a laser-targeted audience. It cost money to do what you could've done for free.  Twitter - Find out which users are engaging with your business. More expensive than Facebook. Analytics aren't great as other social platforms. Targeting works most of the time and some time it doesn't.  If you are serious about Twitter ads I would allocate at least $1k."

startups,3a89j7,garuda_crafts,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:46:02 2015 UTC,"A great SMM should be a great communicator.  They need to be able to communicate your brand well.  How are their emails? Do they pay attention to details? Are their statuses clear?  They need to be engaging and creative.  Look at their blog posts and status updates. Would you follow them?  Follower count and likes mean nothing if your audience is not engaged. There should be a discussion between them and the audience.  Can they make connections? Are they willing to take risks? This is where creativity dwells.  Currently, I am working on post on what Nigerian scammers can teach you about marketing.   They should be technical.  They don't have to be a web developer.

Here's the link  http://sourcesofinsight.com/ten-types-of-difficult-people/  Best advice  is to use the  lace technique     listen  (don't interior at all. Let them vent. Then give your reply)    acknowledge - not necessarily  their complaint  but that they have an issue  e.g I understand  your concerns however we obtained your information on a public website  and thought  we could  be of service to you...  confirm / clarify  any actions or clarify points  if their complaint.   Explain  - what  you can do  time frames etc  Some people  are just dicks  and will be an absolute  arsehole  to ya over the phone as it's faceless. Ignore it. That's  their issue.

If you get a chance to interact with this person face to face, sometimes reasoning can work: ask them directly how they would feel if they had to give up a business they'd worked damn hard on.  That said, it sounds like it's an empty threat in this case - just remove his account and thank him for his feedback. If you are worried about legal action, you could always get in touch with legal counsel over the internet. It's quite inexpensive just to ask a question these days, I believe."

startups,3a8kno,erdomester,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:24:37 2015 UTC,"So there is conflicting thought and research on this. Here's the BIG issue for super early projects... You don't have enough traction for the social proof to be worth anything. I wrote an ebook on this exact subject that you can get at cuttle.com. Regardless there is another thought I want to share with you. The more options people have the less they tend to do. It's a rule in our company that every point of contact (email, website, landing page, etc.) has a single CTA (call to action). Keep the flow very focussed. If someone does but one thing from your efforts what do you want them to do? We set up our landing page like this... User enters email (landing page has no visible share buttons at this point) > User is presented with thank you screen (copy encouraging sharing and the 4 major share channels). Our rates of people sharing have increased as well because of 2 things I think. 1) Once you give us something the likely hood of you giving us something else (like share) increases 10 fold because of the Benjamin Franklin rule (he asked a rival constituent to borrow a prized book from him even though he knew the guy hated him. The psychology of giving something of value to someone makes you like them more). 2) We are extremely focussed with what we want you to do. I'm not saying social proof doesn't play a role. You can put up testimonials and user counts and press... The difference is they aren't a call to action... They are enhancing the call to action of sign up / pay."

startups,3a8kno,garuda_crafts,2,Thu Jun 18 17:17:26 2015 UTC,Yeah... Great question. I'd recommend define sub criteria. For example let's say you have a new SaaS product for Chemical Engineering companies. It might be very hard to find many groups that are relevant. However you can actually start filtering and doing research on people that hold the job title that would be your ideal customer and see what groups they are a part of. In addition take it as an opportunity to actually reach out to the people that are helping you discover your groups.  Let me know if this was helpful and if there's more info you would like.

Pretend that you are not pitching a developer to parter with you....but rather an investor.....now just think for a moment....if I was that investor....would I invest money into my business.  The answer at first will be....probably not....and not because it is a bad idea....but that most people haven't put in the time and research to validate the idea.  You need to start researching, finding similar companies and businesses....seeing where they hit it big and where they failed.  Devise a plan on how you will make money once the app/whatever is built....and do not say ads....because ads require users....so then you need to answer how you will get users.....see where I am going with this?  So you need to cover all basis of how the business will work, run, make money, get customers, retain customers, and where the business will spend money and what your financial forecasts will be.  If you came to me with all that research and knowledge about your idea, then I would see that you are serious and would consider sitting down and listening to your idea.

It is therefore inevitable and expected that other people will be trying to create the same thing that you are at the same time. You just have to do it faster, better, or cheaper.   Recent examples:  Uber/Lyft couldn't have existed until a majority of the population had a portable GPS unit with internet access in their pockets everywhere they went.  Oculus couldn't have existed until palm-sized high pixel density displays were economical to produce.   Dropbox/google drive/etc couldn't have existed until large drives were economical to purchase en masse, high speed internet was the norm,  and there was distributed 'cloud' technology easily available and already deployed.

The funding and the e-commerce revenue aren't as closely linked as you think.   This is because the revenue is generated by a select few big players who aren't participating in the fund raising.   The problem is that most of the fund raising is happening on cash burning companies. It's not Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, et al.   Furthermore, the users online is part of the problem. Most funds are being raised on the user metric rather than the top-line. Some of these entities haven't figured out how to monetize without completely killing their business (losing current user base).   So while this was an eye opener on how the landscape has changed, I don't think it addresses the underlying issues that people have been raising."

I do think there is a lot of dumb money going into dumb companies (every time I hear ""Facebook for X"" I cringe), but I also don't think there is a bubble... yet.

That said, I will say that price is always negotiable, so you can develop an app for anywhere from $100 to infinity, really. It's just whatever you want to spend.   Depending on where your developer is from, some countries, because of cost of living, offer labor significantly cheaper than others. So, again it's whatever you want to spend."

startups,3a7dp4,valiantX,2,Wed Jun 17 21:04:58 2015 UTC,"It's termed and called delegation, because the main purpose of a founder isn't to think micro but to think macro! Founder(s)/creator(s) main job is to acquire funds and more revenue flow, not micromanage the technical processes, which is why there is a person position termed or called 'CTO' or Chief Technology Officer to manage the programming aspects of a product or service. However, if the founder/creator of a business idea is only skilled in mobile app programming, then he/she will have a harder time trying to fund their business - one's technical skill excludes one from learning and performing other skills e.g. litigation, business pitching, Legalities/Law, etc., it's just how nature works.  Andrew Carnegie is one of the best example of an entrepreneur who knew little about business technicalities, in regards to steel making and whatever else is involved with the business of the metal, but his ability to listen and talk with others is what eventually made him a rich man. Another example is the military general, he/she doesn't know how to manage all the logistics required to maintain an army, because he/she has to focus on a strategy to utilize every man and tools to win a battlefield and war - the most effective groups are composed of separate individuals with specialized skills working in union."

startups,3a8fbl,PabloENGR,3,Thu Jun 18 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"I too have had a lot of great ideas, but I also have a lot of tech experience and enough competency to build them. I have documented many of them in the past and they have been proven to be wonderful ideas based on the business that have done exactly what my idea was and have been extremely successful.  For example, back in 1998, I had the idea of a web-based email, calendar, chat, and office document editing website. (I called it ""Webuter"".) Along with this, you could store large files that could be accessible from any computer with a web browser.   How do I know this was a great idea? Because google has been extremely successful with Gmail, google apps, google talk, and google drive many years later well after I had my idea.   Do I feel like google owes me something because it was ""my idea""?  No, absolutely not.   The truth is that truly great ideas are nearly never unique. If it really is a good idea and worth doing, someone else has thought of it and is working on it, or it will happen. Multiple people will work on similar ideas and the one(s) that win are going to be the ones that execute the best.   I have a REALLY good idea that could further revolutionize cloud computing, save a lot of energy, and benefit billions of people, but I have no plans one executing this idea. I am fairly confident someone else will do it within the next 10-50 years and it will be awesome. I'm looking forward to it. (Think radiators in homes and business built out of computing resources that can be leased out (similar to AWS, but the heat generated from running them, is used to heat homes, business, and other things. This brings a few challenges like security, fault tolerance, and other issues, but those can all be handled).   Ideas are worth (less than) a dime a dozen, no matter how good they are. The execution is what matters. Executing is more than being able to build out the idea. Timing matters, as well as marketing/sales, and management. These are almost always harder than the actual creation part.  Here is the deal about great ideas and sharing them publicly, no one is going to steal the idea that hasn't already thought of that idea themselves. Here is the reason why: True entrepreneurs want to build something of their own. They don't want to take some other person's random idea and execute it themselves. This is why you don't see true entrepreneurs do franchises.   Essentially a franchise is a good idea with a recipe to execute. Even then, they still fail. McDonalds and Subway are great ideas! There are stores that make many millions of dollars a day, but there are also franchisees who open new stores that fail and close within a few years because the execution wasn't good enough.  EDIT: So I checked to see if my cloud heating idea was being worked on yet. (I emailed a friend the idea back in 2007 and can see it in my gmail). It looks like someone has a similar idea and has created  proof of concept: http://projectexergy.com"

startups,3a6d85,dashfinn,2,Wed Jun 17 22:00:20 2015 UTC,"So what is the question? Are you asking for feedback for the product or support for the mixed feedback you've gotten?  Let's start the feedback you've gotten. As a person who does anything online, you'll always have people who will think you're the incarnation of anti-christ and all that jazz. You need to commit in hearing this kind of mixed-bag feedback and learn what in it is valuable and what truly is not. That's part of the hustling as a business owner.   You mentioned how the negative feedback feels personal. Now, here's something I want you to remember: they're commenting about your product, not you. They are judging the product, not you. Try to memorize this. Those are two different things: what RocketClub is and who you are as a person. I know you put a lot of effort in this, but still the product is a separate thing from who you are. Don't take it personally, because you really don't need to.  Also, you are right about that it's good to be polarizing. The worst kind of feedback that anyone can get is something like: ""I mean it's okay, looks fine"". That is HORRIBLE!   About the website: For me, it was a little hard to find out what RocketClub is about. If you had been more in my face ""Own a piece of a startup for exchange of you time"" (which I think it is about), then I might have understood faster.   Lastly, how was this product created? How did you customer research? Did people ask you of this kind of service? Is this a problem that a lot of people are having? Is this a problem that people want to be solved? I'm just trying to throw these questions into air to invoke your thoughts on thinking about real demand for a service like this. Meaning, go out, ask 1 people for a coffee and talk that person about the problems they're having and then tell how your product is solving that.  All in all, keep going. I'm sure you've heard what Winston Churchill said about giving up. Listen to him and keep building a better product. I'm sure you'll get there. Hope this helps and good luck!"

I guess I'm really just venting. But any feedback is always welcome. To give you a better idea of how this came to be, we built this product/service for ourselves. A way to incentivize and give my community or network a piece of what I am working on in return for their vested interest in my success. The origination came from wanting it for my previous companies, and we spoke to 30+ startups about the idea before we decided to run with it and build out the platform. As per the user/member side of things, we did what you suggested, we pitched strangers about the idea using a landing page (mostly at coffee shops).  Thanks again for the motivation."

When I went to the homepage, it wasn't dead obvious what RocketClub was about, how I could benefit from it and what I should do next. That's what a landing page is largely about.   I'd be interested to hear what aspirations you found from the customer research, and how much that have you addressed on your site. Not just when pitched the idea, but when you listened their problems around this. How the website addresses their wants and needs? That wasn't clear to me on the site. It's about deeply understanding the user: who they are, where they come from, what they want, what they need and so on.  How does RocketClub fit into their life?

Is this the homepage you see? http://imgur.com/y07AoXg  I'm just trying to make sure because it seems fairly obvious to me what the value proposition is (I'm probably wearing goggles here): You can earn startup shares for promoting/trying/adopting cool products on my website?  I think the problem I am solving is attracting engaged users/customers for startup companies. The problem is much bigger from the startup side. The majority of consumer startups have this need.  The problem I am solving for users is access to startups. This is a way for them to engage/participate in startups and also benefit in the upside from afar. The need I am solving is very much similar to Kickstarter -its discovery of cool products. And allowing anybody to vote for the creation and success of products they believe in, usually products that solve a problem for the user him or herself."

This looks much better; the layout is nicer and clearer. But yes, I can see the value proposition message there. My concern is that are potential customers using those kind of words? Are they using that kind of language? I might be wrong, but I doubt it.  Things like getting to be a part of a startup by doing more what you already like doing, might talk better in the customer's mind.   To me, the idea sounds fairly complex and hard to do. It seems like you have two types of customers; the users and then the startups. My main point is that you should focus on making the product as simple as possible, when you're introducing it. Don't make the visitors think on your website. Do the thinking for them. I'm worried that if I'm having a little hard-time understanding your product, how others who understand it are not as technical or in the community?   I hope I offered some perspective for your in thinking about this product and idea!"

Is it that, or within/across my own teams?"
startups,3a5ron,rory096,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:34:58 2015 UTC,"It's somewhat of a flow chart maker in which you can automate some steps (such as sending emails). You can document a whole process and if there's a step in which you can send emails, you can make that automatically by placing a condition step before it. Let's say you're making a procedure in which you have to send someone an email if it's after 5 o'clock. You can add the time condition before it, the teammate who runs the procedure is asked if it's before or after 5 o'clock and the tool automatically send and email.  You can be a manager and give access to some procedures to your team members.   We're building the tutorial as we speak and hope to have it finished in a few days.

startups,3a0o40,mustra,2,Tue Jun 16 10:13:17 2015 UTC,1. shoto may be very cool. But yet I haven't known how to use that in China since they send the app link directly by SMS only. Do you know how to get it without a U.S. phone number? Or just paste the link here. 2. cluster looks just like shoto. gonna try later.

startups,3a0o40,privatly,3,Tue Jun 16 16:17:55 2015 UTC,I think there's something to say about having competition in your market.  You can see what you like and see what you don't like.  Try to improve your app based on this.  It might be cherry picking from other products but this is literally a cornerstone of what businesses do.

You are on the verge of shutting down your startup just because you heard Facebook just made something similar..."
startups,3a0o40,zeroXten,9,Tue Jun 16 18:25:35 2015 UTC,"Well, I would look at this in a handful of ways.  1) Don't take this personally, but, while the product certainly has appeal, simple ideas like Phlock are dime a dozen. Take a long hard look at what you can do with it. Snapchat is a great example of this: they started as just self-destructive photos and while a lot of clones came out in its wake, the app has evolved by building around this simple concept. What can you build around the idea of spontaneous private sharing? There are plenty of people that for a variety of reasons could never use Facebook Moments to do what the app does; there could be some non-social environment where the functionality might be useful. Can you adapt it to B2B? Corporate events? Some interest group?  2) It's really, really hard to fight a company like Facebook. They have a thousand times the resources you and your roomate could ever muster, especially when working on innovation. So get that kind of thinking out of your head, cause it's a losing battle. Look at it from the other angle: now that Facebook is doing it and you're thinking about pulling the plug, you got nothing to lose. Experiment. Be bold and daring. Crash and burn and then pull the plug.  3) There are plenty of people who either don't use Facebook or straight up don't have it. Maybe you can build something super lightweight for older, crappier phones or an alternative target market.  4) All that hard work you put in didn't disappear overnight. You still have a product and while getting somewhere interesting might require you to put in more hours, what would have happened had Facebook not come out with its app? You would've kept working on Phlock right? Then that's what you should do.  I know it sucks when someone else has your same idea and runs with it, but that's life. It's how you readjust that defines your success. If you came this far, you just have to keep going; the finish line has just been pushed back by quite a bit."

startups,3a0o40,zeroXten,9,Wed Jun 17 04:44:10 2015 UTC,"I think there's a big market for people who just want to limit the exposure of their Facebook account. I don't want to add everyone around me on Facebook, but I might want to share pictures from a particular event.   If you can build a 'networked photo app', where pictures you take are shared in real-time with other people in that network (have Phlock installed, have joined your 'event' - which can be a proximity dependent thing) super easily, I think that is still very appealing.   Personally, I'm not likely to feel inclined to install yet another Facebook app on my phone - and their solution definitely seems more complex than necessary.   Keep going!"

startups,3a0o40,helguita,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:21:31 2015 UTC,"Fair enough question. The simple answer is no, it isn't a security risk.  If you do not appropriately disclosure your security model, then you are trying to use obscurity for security. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but comes at a cost. The cost is a lack of transparency which can limit the amount of trust people put in your platform. Also, if someone finds a vulnerability (which eventually they will) and you weren't upfront, then you could have a bigger PR problem. The other cost comes from a lack of peer review. Even experts get thing wrong, and being upfront about things allows other experts to review your decisions and feed back to you. If you're compromised and it turns out you were using some sort of home-brewed authentication or encryption system, you're going to get ripped to shreds.  There is a thing called Kerckhoff's Principle which states that a crypto system should be secure if everything about it was public, except for the key. This was reformulated by Shannon as ""the enemy knows the system"". Basically, you have to assume implementation details are known, and build your security accordingly. [1]   Obviously, you're not going to public all your internal operations documentation etc, but some level of transparency is advisable.   [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs's_principle"

Kerckhoffs's principle was reformulated (or perhaps independently formulated) by Claude Shannon as ""the enemy knows the system"",   i.e., ""one ought to design systems under the assumption that the enemy will immediately gain full familiarity with them"". In that form, it is called Shannon's maxim. In contrast to ""security through obscurity"", it is widely embraced by cryptographers.

How did you make that elegant youtube video ? Did you pay a specific organization or you made that by your own using software? 2. How far would you think your app go? 3. Have you done a detailed research about the Facebook moments , which may include the difference between yours and his, the sameness, the uniqueness, technology, and conclude those into SWOT ?    For me, I am in China. There is a giant just like Facebook who is called Tencent. Their famous social product QQ, which has more than a billion users in the world, is very popular. Yet, Tencent has a product called wechat which is similar and more functional than that of whatsapp which was bought buy Facebook in $15 billion. The QQ product has been keeping updating very often. Once in the market there are some popular apps or tendencies, they would definitely copy the model and build the product as fxxking as possible. You will get some notices about updating to the latest one or your app will not be functional soon, you may think this is very immoral. But Tencent's being immoral in China is a well-known truth.  But I think at the moment, Tencent is also not very sure what the market is going on even though he did add some new features just as you or even worse. They have kept eyes on you and want to know what you are going to do next. Yet, their product is mainly about chatting and some kinds of photo sharing, but not in a brand to do that. I made an app both in English/Chinese which was a little popular, when some kinds of anonymous social communications were/are still popular. I want everyone in the world can use it. Tencent/Facebook would definitely add some features based on their gargantuan platforms very easily and often. Their most successful product is QQ/Facebook itself, others are really bullshit.  They lie.  And do not be pissed off. Be wise and do some research. I always think if I am in America, my enterprising would be much more better.

startups,3a0o40,Diarum,2,Tue Jun 16 18:09:23 2015 UTC,"A few things.   Young people aren't really using FB anymore (yes they have accounts) FB has put lots of focus on permissions and keeping things within friends. Sounds great, not really. They have to account for all ages and levels of tech savvy. This means using Moments for some big group event like a concert isn't good PR for FB. (Think mom finding drunk son.) Young adults won't use it because their parents will be one it (pretty much automatically). You need to win this in marketing. Know your demographic, be their cool friend. Focus on the passive social tactics people use in small groups that contain close friends and also acquaintances. Someone will want to photo stalk someone later.   Don't give up."

startups,3a0o40,DontQuixote,2,Tue Jun 16 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend seeking out a way to be able to market it to groups as well - e.g. college/uni clubs, societies, and frats/sororities, businesses, etc.   An issue I've faced with uni clubs is being able to collect photos from events, and have them be only accessible to people who were at the events. The biggest reason I'd look at for using this app if I was still in that point of my life is privacy for saucy/drinking/etc. photos I wouldn't want to risk becoming public on facebook. What are the options for that while still sharing photos? People posting private albums? Then anyone not in your friend's list can't see the album. Posting them in event/club FB groups? Even if they are ""private""/""closed""/etc. those settings could be changed by admins outside our control, or the group could contain a few years of alumni or the like who we still wouldn't want seeing photos from nights out. All my friends under 25 use facebook for two reasons: messenger and events. I think you can create an app out of this that handles 90% of what people use events for.   I think what you have going for you is your ability to focus so much on ""privacy"", on sharing with people you're not immediately connected to without opening your entire online life to them. For example - you could have it so you could ahead of time create hashtags/passwords for certain photo sharing groups (e.g. #PaulsWedding2015), you could have it so you could ""add"" someone you meet out to your friends on the app via phone number/email/twitter/insta/etc usernames or app username - essentially have it as a way to ""connect"" with people you meet without having to add them on every social network as well. There have been so many times I've met a person at a party and if I've wanted to find them again (a LOT of my friends have fake names on FB so can be hard to search for), I go to the now ""past"" event, go through the attending list and find them. If there was just an app that did events and photos and all that easily thats 50% of what I use facebook for gone.   I think you can focus on expanding your platform over time (as in adding functions over time post app launch) to fill these niches - with what FB is trying to offer with moments, there's only so much they can make it into without taking away from other elements of their own site and hurting/diluting their own services. What they're launching now is pretty much as good as it can get. I think you're in a much better position to evolve and develop your product. Don't give up, even just watching the videos, yours seems to have hit the mark better in terms of targeting the market correctly. I can see you guys going far with this."

You still have a head start on all of the people who are about to start copying/improving fb's idea so get yours out there! I work with teens and they are all still on fb and then in addition to fb they use Instagram, Twitter, and snapchat and ooVoo. I don't use snapchat so I only know what the kids tell me, but I think the pictures disappear after they're viewed and they expire after some amount of time if not viewed, so I don't know if you need to worry about snapchat anyway. I don't know if ooVoo counts because I've never used it. It's like Skype or FaceTime for video chatting. I don't know what else it does, but FWIW more of my teens use ooVoo than the alternatives."

Do you have any other ideas that would set you apart in tangible ways? If so, I'd keep going.  Remember, FB's threshold for success is much higher than yours. They'd probably need at least tens of millions of people to use this app for them to even bother keeping it going and I'd wager they'll kill this thing off in a year or two.  What's your success threshold? If you got 100k users would that be enough to keep going with it? It's probably easier for you to get 100k users than FB to get and keep 30+ million."

A shared dropbox folder would work, but you miss out on the whole photo sharing/editing/managing front end.   I imagine the use case for your app would be similar to an event that includes two people and never ends.   I haven't looked at your app, but I assume there's some basic album management features. Once all the photos are in the same place you can share them, create albums (or even events?), or manage them as you would any other photo library.  The difference is that your app would become the place where we store all of our pictures, not just for specific events."

A provisional patent is easy to file on your own if necessary and costs basically nothing.  You'll have a year from that time to file a ""real"" (non-provisional) application. In the mean time, you reserve your spot in line, and can freely shout your invention from the rooftops. Plus, if you have ideas that branch off from this one, you'll be able to (hopefully) use that original filing date as a backstop for the whole slew of related patents you're itching to file.  All that being said, have you at least run a basic patent search to see what others patents exist in your tech field? (Full disclosure, that link is to my startup's patent search engine.)  If you're hell bent on waiting though, as an aside, my startup is launching a patent marketplace in the next month. Should bring the cost of filing down significantly. If you want to be included in the beta users and file soon, just go to that lander.  If you have more specific questions, I'm happy to answer here or in a PM."

startups,3a28yp,GarageJim,3,Wed Jun 17 07:09:35 2015 UTC,"There are pros and cons to each approach.    Reasons to not file for a patent: 1. having a patent doesn't guarantee that your idea won't get stolen, and they can be hard to enforce.  To be honest, though, it is unlikely IMO that someone will steal your idea (unless it you have developed cold fusion or something equally mind-shattering); other companies will generally rip off something that already has a proven track record in the marketplace.  They are generally not looking to take on the risk and expense of bringing something to market themselves. 2. Getting early feedback from the market is extremely valuable 3. Filing for a patent is expensive. I do not recommend trying to do it yourself.  Also, in many cases provisional patents, which some people recommend,  are not appropriate.  Reasons to file for a patent: 1. Opens the possibility of licensing your intellectual property to another company. 2. Once the idea is public you will [edit: should say ""may""] no longer be able to patent it. 3. Even if you don't personally have the resources to try to protect your patent, a future partner (e.g., a licensee) might.  I faced a similar decision and chose to go the patent route, and am now in conversations with potential licensees.  Also I recommend checking out the USPTO site and reading through their intro materials / faqs if you haven't done so already.    BTW I think it was wise of you to build a working prototype.  As I'm sure you know there is a lot of work between prototype and a market-ready product.  Also, make sure you do your research before trying crowd funding - a lot of potential pitfalls / downsides there.  Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.  Good luck!"

It'd allow a number of efficiencies:  1) People wouldn't apply for jobs where certain aspects of the job would be ones which would have made them quit two weeks in anyway;  2) Employers would get fewer applications from people who were unsuitable for the job, would have quit quickly anyway, and who went in not knowing exactly what they were getting into;  3) It'd be a lot easier for both applicants and employers to determine what aspects of their preferences / the job were causing the most mismatches. It might even be something they'd never previously considered, particularly if it was largely limited to a specific industry/location.  (For instance, an applicant might find that >40% of the jobs they are close-but-no-cigar-matched with required just one fairly simple certification in order to match. An employer might find that they would get a significantly better quality of applicant matched for a specific job if they offered telecommuting one day a week, or slightly offset shifts, or employee parking. And in both cases, this might apply solely to that one applicant/position.)"

I just want to search for jobs and contact the company.   Why not create a product that doesn't require a login (like Reddit) but to get the better features requires an account for good reason (to save searches, get notifications, etc).  I just want to be able to upload my resume, a robot scan it, and it spit results back. Adding a keyword scan of your reddit account, twitter, linkedin, facebook, might even yield better results."
startups,3a0ui8,very_nice_how_much,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:18:36 2015 UTC,"Companies want a standardized process to get their job applications in -- imagine an employer having job applications come in via email, phone, twitter, linkedin, and also through the job website they posted the job at -- it would be quite the headache! If you have users sign up and submit through the service they posted it at, however, they only have to check one system. PDF parsing is a large pain -- it's not impossible, but PDF's can be structured in a bunch of different ways so that some you can just read the text out of, others you'd almost have to do computer vision type of analysis to get the correct text. Even then, resumes are formatted wildly differently, meaning that you'd need a system that could recognize names, positions, skills, descriptions, phone numbers, emails, etc. For some of those you can use regex's, and perhaps even some sort of machine learning recognition system, but it makes it way, way easier if you just put in your text in a way the system wants. Recommender systems work from improving over time -- let's say the PDF parsing worked perfectly, and it spit results back -- but all were UX Designer positions. As much data as you can slurp up, it's still useful for the user to tell you whether or not your assumptions were right. You'd want a way to improve those results by saying ""no, not this"" and ""yes, this"". Without an account, you'd have to do this each and every time you visited the site.  Sites that don't require a login also usually don't recommend you things as well. Reddit isn't recommending you articles personalized to you without logging in, OkCupid isn't recommending you matches without logging in, etc. There are some exceptions, but in general it's hard to recommend things with any good validity without keeping track of past preferences."

Your website sucks. From what I understand, you want to be the guy who teaches others how to dress and act like men. Everything about your brand should show that. Asking me 25 times to ""get the box"" with the same boring CTA button doesn't really do it for me.  Like /u/zeroXten said - I find the site a bit too busy as well. You might want to try playing with the paddings in each section and add a bit more breathing space on top and bottom.  The email subscribe CTA at the bottom isn't styled too well. Consider making it a bit taller and curvier.  The box page can do with some design and language tweaks as well. Right now it looks like ""grey wool tie"" and ""100% wool"" are 2 different products (or attributes) - ideally the ""grey wool tie"" should be bigger, explaining it's the header of this section.  I would add at least a paragraph in each section explaining why this product is great. Eg: ""A grey suit, paired with a grey wool tie is an absolute essential in every man's wadrobe. Wear this combination to a formal dinner and watch every eye hold you with respect as you sip your single malt"".  Just my thoughts... Sorry if I were too critical."

Usually these kind of services, invest a lot in the pre-launch period with paid ads, building the social media audience number, etc.  With only 300 likes on facebook, I don't think you invested much time and effort. I would drag the pre-launch period longer and wait for the numbers to rise a little more and then send the first edition box.  Have you thought of sending to Europe as well or is it only UK & Ireland? For example, I live in Greece, I would like to subscribe, you are missing out on a wider audience, I don't know about shipping costs but can't be that hard to find something that can work (within EU).  The website is great, I really like the design, looks professional and the box mockups are amazing. Honestly I want to subscribe.  In my opinion the problem is that you lack social media presence and marketing efforts. What I see is a great product but without all the necessary side actions to push it effectively.    try contacting bloggers in the same niche and have them feature your service and maybe review a box if you have a spare keep working on fb. You need more original content. Work on some articles about mens' fashion, grooming, health, fitness, there is tons and tons of material available Publish those articles on the site's blog to. Content is king! More activity on instagram. Personally I follow a lot of men fashions profiles and they keep pumping out content on a daily basis. Make a pinterest account and start sharing material there. Pinterest is photo-based and exceptionally perfect for your niche.    So imho the lack of content and weak social media presence is the problem. Also try to ship to other countries as well."

Definitely use pinterest and start creating content for all your mediums. You need daily activity. Thankfully there is tons of ready material on the web. If you have the ability to write some original articles here and there, that would be excellent.  Also keep in mind that proper photography is the a and z. Hiring that model is a great idea.   Another good idea is to have all the items from the box worn and featured on a real life model and have a photoshoot each month with the items suggesting available dress combinations for different occasions. Photos win the day ;)  Make that into a monthly full featured article and you have steady monthly content.  Honestly you have a huge pool of choices.  P.S. I am waiting for shipping to Greece and I am subscribing asap ;)"

startups,3a0pe3,robertDouglass,2,Tue Jun 16 10:42:33 2015 UTC,"For the landing page, I think ""A Men's Gift Box Filled With <strike>the</strike> Essentials For The Modern Day Bachelor"" would be better.   The Order/Experiment/Enjoy is a little confusing, not clear if it's what you do with a box, or different types of boxes, since there's a 'buy now' button for each. I'd personally like it if the bottoms weren't red (red feels a little uninviting) but maybe a personal preference.   I think hiring a copywriter to clear up and the landing page text in general might be a good idea, if you have the money to bring in a freelancer for one gig."
startups,3a0pe3,6180,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:55:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.   Though I like your idea, I found your descriptions to be too wordy and often contain redundancies that don't flow.    Example:   You have ""A Men's Gift Box Filled With The Essentials For The Modern Day Bachelor.""  In my opinion, too wordy, and not specific.  It describes you as a one off of many other gift box services for bachelors, that may contain essential items.  You also don't need day, modern already implies this.   Try this instead:  ""The essential gift box for the modern bachelor"".     This separates you from the competition, and highlights it as a must have item for the modern bachelor.    I'd also build a story from here.  People don't buy product descriptions, they buy stories.  You can paint a dearth of ideals with just a few key words and an image.  You can:   Describe why you felt this box is needed.   Develop an ideal image of a dapper, young bachelor; who always gets the girl, wins the fight, and looks fucking awesome before, during, and after.  I'm thinking a younger version of James Bond.   Tell a story and build an image around each box, make people connect to out by plugging into their sense of humor, emotional, or nostalgic sides.  ""How dad got mom"" or something.   Just some ideas.  I'm a 25yo male and have a degree in professional sales.  I currently am a financial and business consultant."

startups,3a0pe3,PabloENGR,2,Tue Jun 16 17:22:48 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen it mentioned yet, and maybe it's a translation/language/dialect thing, but I was thrown by the term ""gift box"".  I consider a gift as something I would give or receive one time, but this is a subscription service.  Who's being gifted?  I sort of expected to see a selection of products that I could put together to make a custom gift box for a bachelor.  That would be great for guys getting married that are buying gifts for the dudes in the wedding party, or just to send your dad on Father's Day.  Along those lines, I would include fashion accessories, grooming products, and a selection of ""guy"" gifts, like darts, or a pocket knife, a fancy drinking glass, or a coupon for a free house cleaning.  It seems, though, that this is more like a tie of the month club.  tl;dr - change the name and/or description to be more precise and accurate"

startups,3a0pe3,NoGoodVeryBadDay,2,Tue Jun 16 17:18:02 2015 UTC,"Where the sales have come from? If they came from the email list with 150 people on it, 10 sales is actually quite good.   Forget the likes on Facebook and Instagram. They do not turn into sales. I’d advice you to ignore completely for now. Instead, do experiment with Facebook ads. With Facebook you can really narrow down the right target audience for your ads, for which you of course need to know your target customer well. You can set up a really simple ad campaign for 1 month. Doesn’t need to be expensive either – $100 is enough with $3.33 budget. We’re just trying to find out what kind of image and ad text works, leading people people to your sales page. Once you know that, you can amplify it with a bigger budget, bringing you more sales.  2 things for the website that are going to 10x or 25x your sales (if you nail them well): design and copywriting. By design I do not mean anything fancy or complex. Most people like very simple and easy design, like you’ve heard from many here. And for the copywriting, I do not mean being “sales-y” or pushy. I mean looking at how guys are already searching men’s underwear online. I mean, you can start with really simple methods. Neville Medhora has a simple book on Amazon to get you started, and with that you can dodge the BS in the industry.  For example, you’re not really communicating why I should buy the box. People don’t care about you or about the company, they care about themselves. What is the result I’m getting out of signing up? Result. People often care just about the result. In this case, they want to be more stylish because XYZ (their desire/pain/problem/dream) but don’t want get up and look for this stuff themselves, so for them the package is perfect.   Another thing, that I’d be interested in is how much customer research you’ve done? Have gone out there, face to face people, talking about shopping clothes online? My guess is that you haven’t done this enough. Otherwise you’d have people giving you money and asking when they can buy the product already.  Also, look at the top 5 best-selling books on Amazon most closest to your business and especially see the reviews people have left for books. Pay attention to what kind of language they are using.   From all this customer interaction, you can start to include elements to your site. Words that they use, pains that they have, dreams that they aspire to and so on.  Anyways, this is close to mini-novel already, so I’m gonna stop. Hope this helps and good luck for the sales!"
startups,3a0pe3,daveime,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:27:22 2015 UTC,"I found this advice particularly helpful, and want to lend some additional food for thought.  Largely, u/dashfinn makes an excellent point about knowing your target customer. Who is it? Do you have multiple personas? Ie., I imagine sisters or friends that are girls would be interested in this as well. The better you know who you are selling to, the better you can hone in on what they care about, and cater to them through language, imagery, vision. From here, where do they hang out?   For your emails, how did you acquire the 150? Who are they? Who are they friends with?  Right now the feel is ""check us out, we're new,"" when I (as a consumer) don't really care about you. I want to know how this is going to make me feel, how this will influence my presentation to others...   As for why you exist, I found this ""ON A MISSION TO IMPROVE THE LIFESTYLE OF EVERY MAN."" on your ""About"" page. I could see this being a useful core focus for your blog."
startups,3a0pe3,jackstack1,2,Tue Jun 16 14:21:22 2015 UTC,"For me, 10 paying customers from a mailing list of 150 for the first month isn't all that bad (6.7%).  I personally totally discount the FB and Instagram followers since there is a different communication expectation there.  As for your site, your logo's to GQ, etc either have to link to an article on your product by that company or be removed.  Nothing will ruin your small reputation quicker than having to deal with a legal letter from one of those firms.    I would reach out to fashion bloggers to see if there is any interest in reviewing your service.  Thinking you could find contacts very quickly in:  /r/fashion/ /r/malefashionadvice/ /r/malefashion/ /r/BusinessFashion/  Additionally, your blog should start to focus on being a thought leader about men's fashion rather than just a place to self promote.  The reason this is important is your social share will be quite low when it's just about you.  Pushing toward social share will help grow your brand socially since you will be publishing articles about interesting topics men would share with other men.  Lastly, my not some in-the-street marketing.  Standing outside of Waterloo, Oxford or King's Cross dressed in a sharp suit you could engage potential buyers and get them interested.  You could identify both the right age and those who would appreciate fashion (by how they dress) and offer them a coupon for a discount on their first order.  Additionally, I would use the Blue Apron model of allowing a good customer to send a box to a friend giving both your good customers a way to gift a friend and a cheap way to find new customers.

You describe yourself having a lots of ideas in your head, but you’re not actually doing them. So the first step is to get them out of your head on to paper, so you can focus on and see the bigger picture.  Buy some Sharpies (or other markers if they’re not available) and some Post-It notes. If you look at how the big companies (Airbnb, Dropbox, and so on) organize their work, is they use Post-It notes.  You can also use index cards – one card per day, and come up with 3-5 most important tasks for each day. Then you could have all the week’s cards next to each other, which allows you basically to see your whole week in one view.  For the other tips: start every day by looking at 3-5 most important things to do on that day. The stuff you most put off is usually the most important. Experiment with the Pomodoro technique: where you work in intervals and focus on a single task in 1 session (pomodoro).   At the end of each week, take out a piece paper (notebook or just one sheet) and write down things that are bringing 80% of the results. Be brutally honest with yourself. Then write down the things that are bringing 80% of the problems and headaches. In life and business, we should do more of what works and less of what doesn’t. With this exercise, you map out things to do for the next week as well as things you should avoid repeating during the next week. This helps you create priorities, which fight your feelings of being overwhelmed.  Also, make you bed in the morning. Again, I’m serious. If you want start light and keep things simple, this would be your first choice in becoming more organized. Make your bed for 7-14 days in a row, and see how that affects your organizational skills.  Sorry for not giving many app options here. I hope this helps though. Good luck, and remember: this is an ongoing process!"

startups,3a3c0i,roodleguy,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:13:32 2015 UTC,"Hey roodleguy,    The reasoning this is being made into an app mainly because of the added notification benefits it provides. Without it the best notification processes would be through email, which has become cluttered with spam and notifications would be overlooked. As for an app we can specifically target individuals we believe can claim from a settlement.  When we integrate with facebook login we will be able to use their data to target individuals with greater precision. For instance, ""Comcast Corp. has agreed to settle a class action lawsuit alleging it engaged in business practices that resulted in subscribers paying higher prices for cable television services in the Pennsylvania area"" (Real settlement) We can send notifications to all our users residing in the Pennsylvania area that which, more than likely, 40+% of them would be potential claimants. Yes it would be simpler. More than likely we will launch both a online and mobile version. Making money is our secret sauce. Basically we are advertising for class action investigations."

startups,3a1pa2,MarmiteToast,2,Tue Jun 16 15:21:36 2015 UTC,"Look around to see if similar/same products are available elsewhere for cheaper, or more easliy accessible. If you find a plethora of like products then your company isn't unique. Unlike small town boutiques, as an online store you won't get a sympathy ""support the little guy"" purchase for being small; being small online is perceived as being scammy.  If the product is good, and rare, you can offer more to the customer in their buying experience. For example, photojojo sends a plastic dinosaur in every package.  I only see 2 things on your site: watches, and boho bracelets. Add 1 or 2 more things to the mix with fanfare so the site can't be digested in 1 page. Release the new items by emailing your customer list.  To legitimize your business, use a proper advertising source. Once people are accustomed to the name and have a feel for the brand, you can go back to guerilla marketing techniques.  I hope you can find this useful!"

I have had other product ideas that I have really wanted to try but I thought I should get rid of the ones I already have, just so I have an idea that I could see the new things, or is that a bad way of thinking about it?  Many thanks"
startups,3a1pa2,account_seven,2,Tue Jun 16 15:53:22 2015 UTC,"Depends. Fashion depends on NEW NEW NEW to live, and same with your store. How long have you had the bracelets up? Repeat customers may have come and gone if the same items have been there with no change for a while. Playing within your budget is always a concern, though.  Who is your target customer?"
startups,3a1pa2,account_seven,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:57:13 2015 UTC,"Very true, my target customer would be men of around 17-35. I think I am going to have to just wait until I start my actual brand as I don't really like the products I have at the moment and they're really no different from what a 1000 other people and chinese ebay sellers are selling.   thanks"

startups,3a1el5,whys_wise,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:05:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply!   $19.99 is on the higher end of app pricing. My logic with putting the price there is to be able to control stick shock. If the price isn't on the page at all the user might go ""Sweet, this looks great… I'll go to the App Store to get it… $20?! Screw that!""   With the price up top next to word ""Professional"", it (hopefully) softens the blow a bit. Especially since I can basically make it read ""The Professional WiFi Camera remote … only $19.99!"", and even add some marketing in there with ""Only $19.99 $14.99 until the first feature update!"" to advertise more features are on the way.  Putting the price further down makes even more sense to reduce the sticker shock since the potential user will have seem more of what the app has to offer. However, I'm still concerned about people seeing the first screenshots and clicking the button without scrolling and being put off about the price.   Thanks again for your input. I'll mull it over!"

That said, I'm not your target market, though I would think that there is another application for this tech.  I'm sure there are many people who would like a service like this for security cameras in their home. I think the fact that they could look at their wrist or phone and see wants going on in their home or garage (especially a second home/cottage/timeshare if they have one) at any moment is a pretty strong value.  I don't know how big the market you're going after is, but you may want to see if you can adapt your tech for other purposes as well.  Hope that helps! Also there is way too much text in my opinion.

startups,3a1el5,dashfinn,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:30:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughts. Interesting what you say about text — I was originally going to have two pages: a landing page with only the main headlines on it, then a ""Features"" page with more text and detail. I ended up consolidating them because I didn't feel there was enough content to warrant two separate pages. I wonder if I should A/B test the two approaches."
startups,3a1el5,ZipZapDotCom,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:09:05 2015 UTC,"I would definitely not go with 2 separate pages. In general, its a good idea to do A/B testing but i don't think that it makes sense to do that right now. I struggled (and continue to struggle with) writing content that resonates with users, because its always hard to take yourself out of a founders shoes and be a potential customer who has never heard of your startup.  My guess is the best use of your time would be to go talk to people in your target market, ask them what they think the value of your service is, and how they would use it. Then match the content of the page to what they see the value is, and leave out the rest. Do you have a bunch of photographers you can talk to?"

Search for quality over quantity. It's better to meet the 10 high potential leads and give them more time than visiting 100 low potential random ones.    Be sure who you want to meet E.g. investor interested in fintech for tickets up to 100k E.g.2 Innovation director of am international energy company If you don't know a specific name join the for the person relevant sessions. Usually people gather around specific topics in smaller groups, use that rather than the big stadium hall sessions to network. Use event tools. We for example have a networking app, a matchmaking algorithm, speednetworking rounds and focused master class sessions. Choose and use wisely you can get a lot more out of every minute with that extra help."
startups,39z6wn,PichlerD,2,Tue Jun 16 11:45:50 2015 UTC,"Just talk to 5% of the people and really get to them. I'm at 2-4 network events per week and I've noticed how the ones yoy can talk to for 30+ minutes are the people you can so business with.  Next: ALWAYS follow up. Don't make them an offer right away, but give them something for free. Let's say some tips (in my case about their website / online marketing)...  Make time to meet them for at least 1 hour (coffee / lunch) and talk 70% about their business. Make sure to listen a lot and give advice when they ask for it (or they would really need it).  And don't forget: not all people want to talk about their business or business in general. If you can talk about sports / your children / the news thats fine as well.

I've no idea about Android, but for iOS if there's any way to get to payment on your website from your app, you'll be rejected. The user will have to exit your app, type in your website address, navigate to your payment, type their card details into a fiddly stupid form, etc etc.  If you use In-App purchases, the flow is: ""Hey, to do this thing you need to buy a subscription CoolApp Pro do that? [YES/NO]"" -> Yes -> Touch ID to auth -> DONE. The user never leaves your app and it's a completely seamless process if done right.  The company I work for was so morally against the 30% Apple charges (which is kinda silly IMO since without them you wouldn't have a platform to run on, but I digress) that they did this for ages, trying to sneak in workarounds which were eventually discovered and rejected, etc etc. Finally, they succumbed and added IAP. BAM! Conversion rate went through the roof.   I mean, another thing you could do: Think of the price you'd be happy selling the subscription for on your site. COMMIT to it.

If your app is successful, there will be more attention to it (tech blogs might pick you up). This leads to more scrutiny from Google/Apple and a higher chance you'll be de-listed from the app store. Marketing success becomes almost an enemy.  Also, my guess is the amount of additional revenue gained through the extra 30% will be more than offset by the loss of customers who don't want to go through the hassle of signing up on your website."

startups,39xt9m,almithani,3,Mon Jun 15 18:08:15 2015 UTC,"Here's a copy-paste of what I wrote to someone in a similar situation:    The most important thing is that you trust the founders.  If you don't trust them, walk away.  It will only lead to heartache.  If you do decide you want to join the company, you have a negotiation on your hands.  You must now decide how much the company is worth and tie that to your equity stake.  A lot of startups offer a lower salary and some equity, and the hope (for all parties) is that your equity bonus will be worth at least as much as you would forego by working at another company.  For instance: Company is worth $100,000 They offer you 50% of your current salary+5% of equity That means in 1 year's time, 5% of the company should be worth 50% of your salary.  In 2 year's time, 5% of the company should be worth 100% of your salary (assuming you don't get a raise).  Let's pretend you make $50,000/year.  They offer you $25,000 + 5%.  That means, at the end of the year, the company has to be worth $500,000 for you to break even (5% of $500k = $25k).    Of course, you don't want to just be breaking even, you want to be making a lot of money for taking this risk.  Anyways, this is turning into a wall of text, but please let me know if you have any questions, and PLEASE DO THE MATH!!!  Good luck! =)"

What would be interesting is the vesting schedule, are they saying 1.x% up front or vested over 4 years with a 1 year cliff?  It is slightly odd the the cofounder gets an out after 2 years... If they are keeping their shares and is nondiluteable - this wouldn't seem healthy in the bigger scheme of things.  Also, can your equity be diluted? If so and they get new investors your share gets squeezed."
startups,39xt9m,almithani,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"4 years with a 1 year cliff   This is correct. And no, it will not get squeezed.  Also, the COO was not a co-founder. The CEO is the sole founder. He was in the consulting business and the software was developed out of that, then he hired help because the company became software-focused as opposed to just consulting."
startups,39xt9m,ventrix,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:26:01 2015 UTC,"It doesn't hurt to negotiate. However, in your case you are negotiating over the amount of bonus you get, rather than an alternative form of compensation (if the $75k is a good rate on its own).   But consider that you haven't taken on risk, or done the work to get the company to where it is now. This is just incentive, and that is harder to bargain for when everything else is taken care of already."
startups,39xt9m,jad3d,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:51:35 2015 UTC,"Whether or not it hurts is completely up to the CEO.  He may feel he's being more than fair and take offence to asking for more.  He may admire your tenacity be impressed that you want more.  It's important to look at things from his perspective.  Will you add enough value to the business to make it worth the extra equity?  What are you willing to give up for more equity?  These are the kinds of questions he's going to be asking himself if you ask for more equity.  Honestly, if I was him and I already gave you a fair deal, I'd probably ask something like, ""Okay, you can have more equity if you're willing to give up some of your salary...are you ok with that?""  This is a bit of a trap question: if you say yes, it means you're dedicated...but you're taking on more risk.  If you say no, it means you aren't dedicated...maybe you'll need to accomplish more to impress him.  The important part to note is that when you get into the negotiation game, the CEO has more power than you.  Unless he desperately needs/wants you, your negotiation power is not very high i.e. you're already getting a raise AND better benefits AND equity, so you probably want the job.  But go ahead and ask and see what happens, the worst thing he could do is rescind the offer, the best that could happen is that you get free equity just for asking.  I'd start like this, ""I'm really excited to start working with you guys!  Just wondering...is there any way I could increase my equity package?"""

So if you have 0.12% of the company after your internship and they get the initial deal for $750k for (I am guessing) 33% roughly....that means the company would be worth roughly $2,250,000...which means your shares would be roughly $2,700 at that point in time.  However, usually there is a clause when issuing shares that mentions when they vest.....meaning you can't actually sell the shares off until a certain amount of time.

startups,39vcrg,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:23:35 2015 UTC,"The Mythical Man-Month:       The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks, whose central theme is that ""adding manpower to a late software project makes it later"". This idea is known as Brooks' law, and is presented along with the second-system effect and advocacy of prototyping.  Brooks' observations are based on his experiences at IBM while managing the development of OS/360. He had added more programmers to a project falling behind schedule, a decision that he would later conclude had, counter-intuitively, delayed the project even further. He also made the mistake of asserting that one project — writing an ALGOL compiler — would require six months, regardless of the number of workers involved (it required longer). The tendency for managers to repeat such errors in project development led Brooks to quip that his book is called ""The Bible of Software Engineering"", because ""everybody quotes it, some people read it, and a few people go by it"".  The book is widely regarded as a classic on the human elements of software engineering.   The work was first published in 1975 (ISBN 0-201-00650-2), reprinted with corrections in 1982, and republished in an anniversary edition with four extra chapters in 1995 (ISBN 0-201-83595-9), including a reprint of the essay ""No Silver Bullet"" with commentary by the author.
