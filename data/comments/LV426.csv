LV426,3e19eh,itza_me,3,Tue Jul 21 13:26:54 2015 UTC,"I have to finish that game. At the time I played it I couldn't give it the attention it deserved. Was going through divorce at the time and kind of forgot about it. What I did play though, holy shit is all I can say. First time the alien burst up in the room like who's making all that fucking racket had my heart racing faster than my characters. It actually had me nervous and had me holding my breath. Hell Im 29 and it had me in suspense like the first time I played Resident Evil 2 as a teenager. Damn good feeling. Now that things are winding down I may see about picking it up again so I can actually enjoy it."

LV426,3e19eh,case013,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:07 2015 UTC,Loved Alien Isolation. First game I played on my PS4.
LV426,3e19eh,certop113,8,Tue Jul 21 17:55:04 2015 UTC,It will go down in history as the biggest gaming atrocity to hit the market. Especially for an aliens fan. SO fucking pissed.
LV426,3e19eh,case013,5,Tue Jul 21 05:32:49 2015 UTC,Especially when it came to how SPOILER hicks lived. The writing was just fucking awful. I won't lie I enjoyed the hell out of the escape mode in multiplayer but that was about it.
LV426,3e19eh,Hispanhick,3,Tue Jul 21 05:59:02 2015 UTC,I pre ordered the special edition. I effectively spent 15 dollars a minute on that game.
LV426,3e19eh,Discomushroom,2,Tue Jul 21 12:12:07 2015 UTC,Never played it. Think you could shed a little light as to why? Just curious...
LV426,3e19eh,case013,6,Tue Jul 21 06:42:47 2015 UTC,"The writing is just atrocious. It starts out promising.  It takes place during not long after Aliens and Alien 3. The Sulaco is actually an alien nest with WY scientists on board. Another marine ship shows up at Hadley's hope. Things get crazy as the marines fight aliens Weyland Yutani scientists. Hicks is still alive it was some random guy in his tube who was knocked into it after they woke hicks up. Then insert the cliche everything is going to blow up, the company is evil, two marines are in love but the girl has a chestburster in her. And top it off with some of the cheesiest one liners and one dimensional characters you've ever seen. That's just the story. Then there's he gameplay. Where they showed demos that weren't even in the freaking game after saying they were. Downgraded the graphics to hell. AI was dumber than hell. Your marine team mates would get hung up on everything and keep running against the object with no way to get them loose. It was heart breaking. The multiplayer was the only saving grace. They had a horde mode and escape mode which rocked. The escape mode was like Left for Dead just with Aliens and Marines. It felt like you were playing the scene from Aliens where everything goes to shit towards the end and everyone is doing whatever it takes to live."
LV426,3e19eh,itza_me,2,Tue Jul 21 06:54:26 2015 UTC,"I literally couldn't finish the game single player because the AI teammates are so dumb on that section where you fight the queen, despite even telling you your weapons can't hurt the queen, they continue shooting it rather than the drones attacking you whilst you are pretty much defenseless against them in the powerloader.  Fucking appalling."
LV426,3e19eh,case013,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:42 2015 UTC,I redid a lot of mission progress because my AI teammate got hung up on some boxes in a hallway. It was right after that female marine dies when they can't remove the chestburster. I had to run that whole mission six times before I finally figured out where I needed to stand to keep him from getting hung up on the boxes in he hallway. We would run down the hallways he'd get hung up and keep running and running even though he wasn't moving. So I'd try to go back a checkpoint but it wouldn't register and I'd have to start the whole mission over.
LV426,3e19eh,Ghostalker474,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they fixed this in a patch, but when it came out, the NPCs just killed everything. The environment was scarier than the actual enemies. If anything, I felt like I was following the NPCs around because they knew where to go, and by the time I caught up, everything was dead."
LV426,3e19eh,durandal59,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:58 2015 UTC,"The multiplayer was almost the saving grace.  The most frustrating thing about it was when the alien's leaping attack - which was pretty tough to connect with due to twitchy mechanics - would glitch out and leave both you and your prey locked in a sensual embrace, unable or unwilling to either disengage or harm each other until someone else happened to barge in and finish one of you off.  I estimate this would happen 8 times out of 10."
LV426,3e19eh,the_cutlery_drawer,12,Tue Jul 21 16:32:35 2015 UTC,I found the making of Alien 3 much more entertaining than the actual movie. After watching it I was impressed they were able to make any film at all. It certainly seemed like a battle.
LV426,3e19eh,shroombablol,5,Tue Jul 21 07:01:06 2015 UTC,shows how much of a talented director fincher already was at the time.
LV426,3e19eh,Roof_Tinder_Bones,10,Tue Jul 21 08:17:29 2015 UTC,"I watched Resurrection about a year ago. It was so unbelievably bad, that the next morning I tried to convince myself that I had actually not seen it, and that it was all just a bad dream."
LV426,3e19eh,JangoF76,21,Tue Jul 21 05:47:58 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the theatrical release or the extended cut? The latter is much better.  I loved Allen 3. I never really get the hate about killing off newt and Hicks. Why would you expect a happy ending in a horror film? I thought killing them off fit the bleak tone of this film perfectly, and contributed to Ripley eventually reaching the point where she is prepared to kill herself just to put an end to this nightmare she's been living."
LV426,3e19eh,Aaganrmu,8,Tue Jul 21 06:54:11 2015 UTC,"Killing Newt and Hicks also countered the 'character creep' often seen in other sequels. Because they are favourites from the previous movies, these characters are guaranteed to survive. It will be hard to add a lot of suspense if you know they'll be alright at the end anyway. The next sequel will then need to handle the survivors from Alien, Aliens, and Aliens 3. By killing them before the movie even starts you remove this potential problem, and can start out with a blank slate.  It also sets the stage for everybody being able to die: no punches pulled, no plot armour, it's an all out battle for survival now!  Not that it's the best movie in the series, but I also don't get why people hate this particular thing so much."
LV426,3e19eh,TwistedBlister,2,Tue Jul 21 11:48:08 2015 UTC,"Killing Newt and Hicks also countered the 'character creep' often seen in other sequels.

The next sequel will then need to handle the survivors from Alien, Aliens, and Aliens 3. By killing them before the movie even starts you remove this potential problem, and can start out with a blank slate.   Then by your own logic, why was Ripley still alive? A ""blank slate"" means completely blank.  Aliens 3 should have been about Ripley, Hicks and Newt, and in the end, only Newt should have survived.  But I'm still mad that killed off Jonesy in Aliens, it makes no sense that Ripley survived and he didn't... if anything, he could have been carrying an embryo while is stasis."
LV426,3e19eh,Keranth,5,Tue Jul 21 16:57:48 2015 UTC,"I wasn't mad that they killed them off, it was that they did it basically offscreen. Two of the most prominent characters from Aliens deserved more than an obscure opening credits scene death with Ripley finding out secondhand. To me a similar comparison would be if Hudson died in Aliens and all you heard was an offscreen yell or something and saw his heart monitor stop. Just wouldn't do him justice."
LV426,3e19eh,Ahabs_First_Name,7,Tue Jul 21 13:50:18 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, while they do die off screen, the film doesn't trivialize their deaths; it spends the next 20 minutes dealing with the fallout and they even get a big, beautiful funeral scene that is awesomely juxtaposed with the first appearance of the Alien. I think they do the characters justice after their deaths--the fact that they die unceremoniously off screen beforehand I feel like is part of the point: This is a bleak, unforgiving universe."
LV426,3e19eh,JeanLucPicKev,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:53 2015 UTC,"The fact that Ripley has to examine the corpses is also such a wrenching character moment. 3 knocks her down a peg after how heroic and badass she was at the end of 2, and I'm alright with that."
LV426,3e19eh,Theopholus,3,Tue Jul 21 17:31:38 2015 UTC,Extended!
LV426,3e19eh,JangoF76,2,Tue Jul 21 11:43:16 2015 UTC,"I never got the hate for it. Although, Alien 3 was my introduction to the franchise. I liked both the theatrical release and the extended cut."
LV426,3e19eh,itza_me,3,Tue Jul 21 16:34:21 2015 UTC,"I liked both too - hell, I went and saw the theatrical release twice at the cinema (which I almost never do). But the extended cut definitely fleshes it out for the better, and has some really cool sequences."
LV426,3e19eh,avickthur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, but this was partly necessary for the script as Sigourney stated she wouldn't do another film.  But so much for that."
LV426,3e19eh,rod_munch,6,Tue Jul 21 13:24:36 2015 UTC,You should watch the making of for Alien3. It's a good one.
LV426,3e19eh,milopkl,11,Tue Jul 21 08:33:00 2015 UTC,I actually like Alien 3 as much as 1 and 2. I have a soft spot for it because it is so hated in the fan community. Resurrection can go fuck itself though.
LV426,3e19eh,itza_me,9,Tue Jul 21 10:38:17 2015 UTC,alien 3 is my favourite
LV426,3e19eh,max_vette,4,Tue Jul 21 08:01:13 2015 UTC,I now prefer it to Aliens (the Assembly cut that is).  It's aged a lot better except for the composited parts.  Be great if they re-did all the dodgy looking bits with modern CGI.
LV426,3e19eh,Mechbiscuit,4,Tue Jul 21 13:21:14 2015 UTC,Alien 3 is also my favorite
LV426,3e19eh,Mechbiscuit,4,Tue Jul 21 15:45:12 2015 UTC,The directors cut is the better version of that film.
LV426,3e19eh,psych0ranger,4,Tue Jul 21 10:46:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, my bad. I forgot to mention that's what I watched!"
LV426,3e19eh,GreenEclipz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:42:36 2015 UTC,"Theatrical cut is a 2/5 film, the director's cut was a strong 4/5 I thought. Haven't seen them in a while however and it's a very different film to the change in tone Aliens gave us. It's closer to the original."
LV426,3e19eh,bipolar_sky_fairy,2,Tue Jul 21 11:51:02 2015 UTC,There's really only 2 things I love about alien 3: the rumor control scene and the alien. I believe Giger was brought back on to design the alien for alien 3 and he fuckin killed it. Thats a good lookin alien.
LV426,3e19eh,bipolar_sky_fairy,2,Tue Jul 21 10:18:24 2015 UTC,Agreed it looks amazing. Except how it looks in some of the chase scenes doesn't really hold up well.
LV426,3e19eh,njrogers81,2,Tue Jul 21 20:37:04 2015 UTC,"People always complain about killing off Hicks and Newt, and I always say ""Did you really want a 10 year old girl running around a prison planet, surrounded by rapists, pedophiles and murderers?"""

Tey would have to have recast newt, as the actress would have been much older, which doesn't make sense if they were in hyper sleep. Otherwise, they would have really needed to change the plot."

LV426,3e19eh,rootless2,0,Tue Jul 21 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"I hate to sound stubborn, but literally just change the opening. Find a new way for the alien to appear on this prison planet."
LV426,3e19eh,BRODUS,0,Tue Jul 21 17:26:21 2015 UTC,"Make it take place in the future. Just something. You can change the opening to where the actors are older, it's been a while since aliens, and they still land on the prison planet or somehow get sent there. Maybe Weyland-Yutani has been testing an alien on the prisoners. Ripley and company gets caught up there at the wrong time."
LV426,3e19eh,rootless2,3,Tue Jul 21 17:28:10 2015 UTC,"You have to remember Alien 3 was released in 1992. And it was Fincher's first movie.   Its rather telling that opening weekend Lethal Weapon 3 was the top box office draw.    Fincher is either hit (Se7en, Fight Club) or miss (Panic Room, The Game, Alien3). Alien3 is historically one of the defacto examples of being in production hell. Right up there with Dune. People forget that Weaver had juice, and the script had to be ""non-dependent on guns."""
LV426,3e19eh,earlytocraft,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:23 2015 UTC,What do you mean by Weaver having 'juice'?  Steroids?
LV426,3e19eh,itza_me,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"She had a lot of power in terms of the production, given her character was central. She got a lot of money (and even more when they had to cut off all her hair) for the movie, and had sway concerning firearms in it, as she is pro gun control and found all the hardware in Aliens distasteful and uncomfortable."
LV426,3e19eh,hughk,2,Tue Jul 21 20:00:15 2015 UTC,"She's the star, so she had pull with the studio...her contract stated that the script had to contain very little in the way of guns, as she was an anti-gun supporter. They basically wrote a new script for her. Juice = power."
LV426,3e19eh,TwistedTrent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:33 2015 UTC,Ah I didn't know that.  Thanks  I wonder if that stipulation was just for her character or the film entirely.  If it's the latter like you say then why are there so many guns in Resurrection?
LV426,3e19eh,BRODUS,2,Tue Jul 21 21:24:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, again I think she had weight with Fox because she's listed as co-producer in Resurrection. There were scenes that they wanted cut but she made the studio keep them in. I'm sure its a contractual trade off, where she might have had more say for the final cut in exchange for more violence, as a producer she would represent Fox on the business end, so she definitely had literal clout on set, and possible input on editing.  Think of it this way, she threatened not to do film promotion for certain scenes. She dictated where the movie was going to be filmed, LA not England."

LV426,3e19eh,GreenEclipz,2,Tue Jul 21 07:50:22 2015 UTC,"They couldn't have had Newt alive in the prison for obvious reasons.  As Sigourney stated at the time it would be the last Alien she would ever do, I think it was appropriate to have them killed off."
LV426,3e19eh,Looter629,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:23:00 2015 UTC,"The distributed version kind of sucks as it lacks some of the character development. There was a dispute between Fincher and the Studio about the pace. Although there was no director's cut, an attempt was made using cut footage to produce his vision and this is known as ""the Assembly Cut"" and I believe it was even officially distributed on some of the Aliens collections but can be found online. This is well recommended and gives a lot more context.  Hicks and Newt stay dead. However, you can understand why it was done. Ripley needed to be alone."

LV426,3dy7db,Bigtiger27,11,Mon Jul 20 14:35:55 2015 UTC,The image quality of Alien is superb on Blu Ray.
LV426,3dy7db,Lofarl,8,Mon Jul 20 16:00:30 2015 UTC,"It really is one of the best blu ray sets available. Loads of features, great transfers, audio, everything is top notch. On par with the LOTR set."
LV426,3dy7db,Sparkling_Beverage,2,Mon Jul 20 16:01:34 2015 UTC,The only frustrating part is that LotR inexplicably still splits the movies across discs like it did on DVD.
LV426,3dy7db,gordogg24p,5,Tue Jul 21 03:13:33 2015 UTC,I bought those the day they came out and still don't regret paying almost 4 times as much as what they go for now.    Enjoy!
LV426,3dy7db,mewithoutCthulhu,4,Mon Jul 20 15:15:23 2015 UTC,I got it on amazon on sale for $24.99 as apposed to what it normally costs at $80.
LV426,3dy7db,mewithoutCthulhu,4,Mon Jul 20 16:12:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I paid around $75/$80 when it first came out and that was the cheapest you can find it since it was brand new.  Now you can find it for $20 pretty regularly.  Amazon sometimes does a bundle of the box set + Prometheus on Blu-Ray for $25."

LV426,3dy7db,itza_me,3,Mon Jul 20 18:36:03 2015 UTC,I managed to snag this along with Prometheus on blu-ray for $20 a while ago. Fantastic set!
LV426,3dy7db,ON3i11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"You should watch Prometheus: Giftbearer - a fan edit available on a certain site.  It really improves on the original cut, primarily by the use of the alternate scenes, inexplicably not chosen in Ridley's cut. The first scene is a little long though."
LV426,3dy7db,Yeshivas,2,Tue Jul 21 13:34:35 2015 UTC,"Hey I just picked up my set last month. I already had them all on DVD, but my copy of Aliens mysteriously disappeared, so when I saw the bluray set was on sale at HMV I picked them up right away. ALready watched all 4 with my buddy. They look fantastic."
LV426,3dy7db,PREDXENO426,3,Mon Jul 20 21:55:56 2015 UTC,I picked up the Quadrilogy when they first came out on DVD years and years ago for $80.   Picked up the BluRay set for $22 about a week ago. Can't get enough of them. The quality on the BluRay is breathtaking.
LV426,3dy7db,handsomescot85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:29:38 2015 UTC,Prepare to spend weeks going through 60+ hours of extras. My favorite being the ALIEN 3 documentary being fully uncut. The DVD set had around 20 minutes cut because it put FOX in a bad light.

LV426,3dy2xz,mewithoutCthulhu,5,Mon Jul 20 14:00:47 2015 UTC,AvP depressed everyone.
LV426,3dy2xz,Nrksbullet,4,Mon Jul 20 16:33:50 2015 UTC,"I really liked AvP. Sure it was silly, and there were some big plot holes and continuity issues, and the characters were forgettable. But it was fun. You get to see a predator fighting a xenomorph - that shit is cool!  And hell, it was still better than Prometheus."
LV426,3dy2xz,JangoF76,4,Mon Jul 20 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"Woof!  To each their own, but I couldn't disagree more.  I'll admit, I haven't watched AvP since I saw it in the theater.  I just remembered coming away completely baffled by how they screwed it up.  Crappy characters and story can all be forgiven.  They were tasked with giving us Predators fighting mother 'effin Aliens and make it look cool.  Most of the work was done for them and they failed.  The fighting was so poorly shot and edited that you couldn't even enjoy it.  That and the Predators and Aliens both looked piss poor.  I remember leaving very disappointed.    For all of it's shortcomings and non-sense, Prometheus still trumped it on every single level.  Most of all, visuals.  If we just want something cool to look at, Prometheus stomps all over AvP.  Again, that's just my opinion."
LV426,3dy2xz,JangoF76,3,Mon Jul 20 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"Prometheus was the only film where I've been close to walking out of the theatre in disgust. But whaddaya know, we can both be fans of the franchise and love/hate different bits of it. Probably wouldn't surprise you to learn that I also loved Alien 3 and Resurrection too!"
LV426,3dy2xz,JangoF76,3,Mon Jul 20 18:45:05 2015 UTC,"I love both Alien 3 and Resurrection and think people shit on them far too often.  Yeah, they don't compare to Alien and Aliens in my mind, but to say they're trash?!  C'mon now!  They were still enjoyable movies.  I've said on this sub before, I consider there to be 4 Alien movies: Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, and Alien: Resurrection.  I don't exclude AvP out of spite or hate for them.  It's that they were so terrible and forgettable in my opinion that it just slips my mind that some would consider them in the same franchise.  I don't make a point of excluding them because I want to shout and make sure everyone knows that I think they suck.  My brain just thought that they sucked so bad they don't even register with me."
LV426,3dy2xz,itza_me,3,Mon Jul 20 19:08:37 2015 UTC,"I know, what's up with that? I can kinda understand the hate for Resurrection, but Alien 3 was legit, especially the director's cut. I think I even liked it more than the first film. I agree about there being 4 Alien movies. I wouldn't count AvP either, even though I enjoy both AvP movies, they're just dumb fun spin-offs that don't warrant a place in the Alien canon for me."

The one part in the 2nd movie where the National guard were rolling up i got really excited and thought i was gonna see some hardcore combat go on they could of did so much with that part alone.
LV426,3dy2xz,hetoowasthere,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:48 2015 UTC,One of the producers wanted the movies to be set in the Predator universe rather than Alien. Also I'm sure budget was a concern too.
LV426,3dy2xz,DippyMcDumbAss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:32:24 2015 UTC,Hardcore combat would cost too much. A slasher movie is much cheaper.

LV426,3dudwv,rootless2,15,Sun Jul 19 16:52:11 2015 UTC,Yup. It was quite a lot.... £95 for just her or £110 for this one with powerloader too.

LV426,3dudwv,tslime,8,Sun Jul 19 18:23:24 2015 UTC,That's pretty reasonable for convention photo-op prices for mainstream celebrities. Kind of sad but unavoidable aspect of convention culture.
LV426,3dudwv,zodberg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:44:07 2015 UTC,"It is sad, the only reason they're charging that much is because they know people will pay it."
LV426,3dudwv,tslime,3,Sun Jul 19 20:07:12 2015 UTC,"Keeping a high price on tickets keeps the line shorter and if celebrities couldn't bill the individual fans, they would just increase their appearance fee, and that means all the admission price for the convention would rise regardless if was and wasn't meeting ripley."
LV426,3dudwv,MiCK_GaSM,0,Sun Jul 19 20:22:10 2015 UTC,"Well that may well be so. It's a shame though, all this money grubbing, kind of feels like sticking it to the punters."

LV426,3dpsw3,PROTOXAKIRA86,5,Sat Jul 18 07:12:03 2015 UTC,I imagine this is what sleep paralysis is like.
LV426,3dpsw3,tit_wrangler,8,Sat Jul 18 11:54:16 2015 UTC,"Sleep paralysis sufferer here! The hallucinations that I get during an episode of sleep paralysis are almost entirely indistinguishable from reality. Here are a few fun examples:   Looking up from my bed to see a black hand with elongated fingers slowly reaching around from the doorway, and knowing that the owner of the hand was some kind of Lovecraftian horror. Seeing my cat sitting at the end of the bed facing away from me, then turning her head slowly to show me that her face had been chewed off. Waking up after having an attack I rolled over to tell my wife, and the thing that was on her side of the bed sat up and started smothering me with a pillow, and then I actually woke up.   All of these are hyper-real; they are not abstract, there is no dream-like quality to them. I haven't had an episode for quite some time but at one point a couple of years ago I was having an attack every 2-3 days. That is the kind of shit that makes you swear off sleep altogether."
LV426,3dpsw3,overkill,3,Sat Jul 18 13:26:17 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, dude. That makes even the worst horror movies seem cute by comparison. If you don't mind my asking (I'm fascinated by the subject), I've heard that many episodes of SP involve being unable to move - was that the case as well? Also, when you say they were not dream-like, is that true even looking back at them? I.e., I've had a few hyper-real dreams that were more vivid and during which I even thought to myself that it wasn't a dream, but in retrospect they were still obviously dreams.

Colonial Marines reminds me of Christmas as a child. You hope and hope for some awesome present and then get basically shit. Its like a certain level of childhood disappointment that will never be fulfilled.    To be honest it plays like an Unreal mod with a sprinkling of authenticity in the form of voice work. As a game it is horribly broken and may in fact be one of the worst games ever released. The Doom mod was probably better.  Also, as someone who preordered...I feel a deep shame at my own idiocy. Not for the fact that I preordered, but for the simple fact this dev studio was responsible for the greatest farce in PC Gaming history, Duke Nukem Forever. That should have sent warning bells ringing in my ears that Colonial Marines was going to be a disaster.    I will never buy a Gearbox game ever again."
LV426,3dmgqv,rootless2,12,Fri Jul 17 15:00:26 2015 UTC,I was blinded by the fact that the original Colonial Marines game was due out in April 2001 on PS2 and I had been waiting for that supposed squad based shooter based in my favorite movie franchise....but I didn't get that. I got some joke.

LV426,3dmgqv,JandersOf86,3,Sat Jul 18 01:58:57 2015 UTC,Even something remotely close to that would have been awesome. As it was ACM was basically an on-rails shooter.
LV426,3dmgqv,chiaestevez,8,Sat Jul 18 02:02:41 2015 UTC,Isolation was a well crafted addition to the Alien universe. I personally loved the game. If the same dedication had been shown to Colonial Marines it wouldn't have been such a disaster.   In all fairness though Duke Nukem was pretty well finished by the time they bought the rights. They just released it to get it out there. Could they have scrapped it and remade it? Yes. Why didn't they? Because it was a cash grab to recoup the money they paid for the name.
LV426,3dmgqv,MindlessMe13,7,Fri Jul 17 20:55:37 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, didn't Gearbox take over Duke Nukem Forever after it was already beyond fucked and was tasked with releasing it as a marginally playable game?  I guess I don't care enough to look into it.    I will say that I played both Borderlands 1 and 2 and enjoyed them greatly.  So, I can't agree with everything Gearbox shits out, but they have built up some goodwill with me for those two games."
LV426,3dmgqv,rootless2,6,Fri Jul 17 15:32:16 2015 UTC,The fact that Duke Nukem Forever was released at all is surprising. Whether they should have released it is another question entirely.

This is the quote from the article:  ""So there’s this rumour we’d embezzled money from Aliens and spent it on Borderlands. Firstly, that’s absurd, and secondly the actual truth is the opposite, which is a lot more embarrassing. We took a huge amount of the money that we’d made off the first Borderlands, invested it into Aliens trying to make it as good as we could, and still ended up disappointing a huge number of people.""  *Edit, not saying I believe him.

I'm a pretty big gamer, but also very picky.  Life doesn't afford me an abundance of personal time to play all of the videogames I want.  So when the reviews bombed, I steered clear.    I have a feeling that going in with such low expectations, I may actually enjoy it.  Still hasn't convinced me to spend the $10 on it though.  Amazon had the collector's edition with the power loader figure for $20 for the longest time and I almost pulled the trigger daily for about a month but still couldn't justify it."
LV426,3dmgqv,Jaeflash,11,Fri Jul 17 14:27:55 2015 UTC,The main campaign can only be reasonably enjoyed with 3 other people. So you can all collectively laugh at it.    It is historically bad. I rank it up there with Superman 64.
LV426,3dmgqv,Entropius,6,Fri Jul 17 15:03:44 2015 UTC,"I bought it a few months ago and actually enjoyed it. My expectations were completely tempered; I just wanted to run around and see Hadley's Hope.  I didn't run into any crippling bugs. The story was a bit ridiculous, but otherwise fine. It had a very Halo-ish vibe to me in that it's one scenario after another. The Alien AI didn't seem awful to me, the graphics were fine, albeit nothing special.  I think if you're a fan of the series and spend less than ten bucks on it, you'll probably enjoy it after all of the patching that's been done."
LV426,3dmgqv,rewddit,3,Fri Jul 17 15:21:53 2015 UTC,"That's my experience. Not the best game ever, but I did enjoy it. No major bugs here either, the AI was average, and the graphics were okay but not ground-breaking. I've played through twice now and had fun both times."
LV426,3dmgqv,King-Bruce,4,Fri Jul 17 19:03:49 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with this assessment.  I got the game to shoot at aliens, run around Hadley's Hope, and get scared a bunch.  And as far as I'm concerned, mission accomplished.  But the thing is that when it first released, there were crippling bugs.  There were NPCs who needed to help you getting stuck forcing you to solo stuff that shouldn't be solo'd.  There were aliens acting incompetently (bad AI).  But these issues eventually got patched up, but by then the damage had been done.  (This is why buggy first releases are so dangerous to a game's rep, the scores that appear on websites are not going to take bug-fixes into account)  So if you got the game on release day, it was a steaming pile of crap.  If you waited for a few rounds of patches, it was an okay aliens game.  Maybe not a masterpiece like Isolation, but enjoyable enough."
LV426,3dmgqv,treblah3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:39:31 2015 UTC,Right. I'm very glad that I didn't play it when it first came out and held off for as long as I did.

The only thing I have to add is why they just HAD to make it a direct sequel to Aliens in a way that's just so fucking ham-fisted. They just had to keep hitting the player over the head with, ""Remember this part of the movie? Remember this dialogue we recycled? Remember this location? Remember this character that ought to be dead?""  Remember the old AvP2 game? It had an original story. There were a few nods to the movies, but it did it's own thing. I wish more games would risk writing something original instead of playing it safe with the nostalgia trip.  Alien: Isolation's plot was technically a sequel to Alien, but it's still an original plot with original characters with zero attempt to retcon the movie's plot. Instead, it's done with so much attention to detail and pure love for the subject matter. (Okay, the flashback to the derelict was pretty dull, but goddamn beautiful)"

I think most of Elysium's problems were with the script, and that's something Neill freely acknowledges, which is refreshing.  I enjoyed Chappie...it wasn't great, but it was really good. My two big gripes with that one were 1) Ninja and Yolani weren't awful awful, but I could have done with less of them, and 2) The most intriguing part of the story came at the end and was barely touched on. I don't want to spoil it, but my wife and I were both REALLY hooked on that plot point and wanted more of it.   I'm optimistic about Alien 5. Blomkamp will hands-down nail the look and aesthetic. Scripts are his biggest weakness right now IMO, and he's getting more and more experienced with that with each film."
LV426,3dlg5t,gordogg24p,10,Fri Jul 17 14:37:50 2015 UTC,"Plus, we don't know how he could react to having a universe already constructed for him. That structure could help him tighten things up immensely."
LV426,3dlg5t,bbqwoa,-17,Fri Jul 17 15:54:21 2015 UTC,"yes. thats the fucking point, pinhead. He has made a single good movie.  Everything else he has made is garbage, and everything just rides on District 9's success.  Hence, One hit hack."
LV426,3dlg5t,dcresistance,9,Fri Jul 17 13:16:52 2015 UTC,"He also made Elysium, Chappie, Tetra Vaal, and Halo: Landfall, which were quite good. Stop with the insults; they really don't make you look good."
LV426,3dlg5t,FishtanksG,6,Fri Jul 17 13:38:33 2015 UTC,I didn't see any of those movies but liked the concept from most of them. I just hope we don't get another Alien 4.
LV426,3dlg5t,dcresistance,3,Fri Jul 17 13:43:03 2015 UTC,"Oh god... It's not Jeunet directing Alien 5, thankfully, so we can still have hope."
LV426,3dlg5t,bbqwoa,-2,Fri Jul 17 13:48:27 2015 UTC,those are bad movies.
LV426,3dlg5t,dcresistance,6,Fri Jul 17 13:58:55 2015 UTC,"Are they, though? It just sounds like you want to hate on Blomkamp every chance you get."
LV426,3dlg5t,bbqwoa,-5,Fri Jul 17 14:01:10 2015 UTC,Wrong. District 9 is a fantastic movie. The rest are shit. This isn't some personal attack on the man. He made one good movie and the rest are demonstrably the products of a hack.
LV426,3dlg5t,treblah3,3,Fri Jul 17 15:07:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say completely talentless, but I also have concerns about the quality of this movie after seeing Chappie (I was on the fence with Elysium)."
LV426,3dlg5t,rewddit,3,Fri Jul 17 15:03:37 2015 UTC,"It's not just you. I wouldn't go quite so far with the talentless hack stuff just yet, but I do wish Blomkamp wasn't driving this project. I don't have high hopes."
LV426,3dlg5t,A_Goon,4,Fri Jul 17 12:32:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly seeing the aliens we love on the big screen again will be great. If the film is ok at best I will be satisfied. District 9 was decent in my opinion and I enjoyed Esylium. I have not seen chappie so cannot express myself on that movie.  I believe most of us are talking about aliens when we fear what he will create. Without aliens we would not understand the creature to this day. That movie broke the lifecycle down for us. The movie alien on the other hand was pure horror not understanding what the creature was, where it came from, or for most of the movie what it even looked like. It was mass confusion and felt like a story that didn't explain the creature much at all leaving it to your imagination. Prometheus had aspects of this but didn't deliver it as well.  I believe the movie will go one of two ways. It will either be a movie that doesn't explain much and has many horror aspects or it will be a movie that explains everything and has new aspects of the aliens (see resurrection). This is sole speculation of course and I hope for the first direction over the twists."
LV426,3dlg5t,rewddit,3,Fri Jul 17 15:01:39 2015 UTC,"Who would you have rather seen take the wheel? I think Blomkamp was by far the best choice. I really enjoyed all of his films thus far and feel like his love & talent for sci-fi and world building is evident in his work. In my opinion, he obviously loves the Alien franchise and is arguably going to do more good for it than even it's original creator is doing. Not that I hated Prometheus, I just wished for the story to be deeper."
LV426,3dlg5t,A_Goon,3,Fri Jul 17 15:57:00 2015 UTC,"I guess anyone with a better track record than Blomkamp. I don't think he's awful by any stretch, I also enjoyed District 9 and Elysium, but this is one of my favorite movie franchises and I think Blomkamp is less of an ""awesome movie"" guy and more of a  ""that was a fun rental"" type.  I would've loved if there was someone like a Matthew Vaughn attached to it.  That said, I still have hope that it could be good, unlike the weird hype I keep seeing for the Superman vs. Batman movie that's being helmed by Snyder who's record has been mediocrity."
LV426,3djgzj,mewithoutCthulhu,4,Thu Jul 16 19:39:13 2015 UTC,So has a Korean company bought Weyland Yutani or is there a Korean/Japanese cold war perhaps. Ripley and Hicks helping the enemy to destroy the derelict? Blomkamp does like his geopolitics.
LV426,3djgzj,gogoluke,2,Thu Jul 16 21:16:47 2015 UTC,"That was Hicks? Is this movie going to consider the Colonial Marines game canon then?  Edit: also, I think the Korean/Japanese cold war idea could be further thought on, that maybe Weyland-Yutani splits, and that's someone from Yutani Corps."
LV426,3djgzj,CaptainJesusNFriends,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:25:49 2015 UTC,"I can see them easily taking Prometheus into consideration in plot points but I doubt Colonial Marines will still be canonical as it will not be a revenue stream now and it was only ever Pachter that said it was canonical anyway, he is a grand self promoter and snake oil salesman."
LV426,3djgzj,gogoluke,3,Thu Jul 16 22:41:12 2015 UTC,I'm guessing you mean Randy Pitchford? I only asked if it would be canon because of Hicks appearance.
LV426,3djgzj,CaptainJesusNFriends,2,Thu Jul 16 22:58:00 2015 UTC,That's it Pitchfork.
LV426,3djgzj,gogoluke,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:58:47 2015 UTC,"I'm slightly ashamed to say that I bought the collector's edition of his game, I was under the impression he was socially awkward and doing what PR said in all the interviews and such. Neatish statue though."
LV426,3djgzj,CaptainJesusNFriends,2,Thu Jul 16 23:11:59 2015 UTC,"This would be the worst option. They need to ignore colonial Marines, ignore 3 and 4,and especially ignore Prometheus."
LV426,3djgzj,ManofManyTalentz,2,Fri Jul 17 03:24:16 2015 UTC,"I could only wish they'd stay true to the level of tech from the time period, similar to how Alien Isolation handled it.  Instead of going full Prometheus on us and having everything super advanced"

LV426,3djgzj,qspec02,9,Fri Jul 17 00:07:05 2015 UTC,"Is it bad that I have almost no faith in this project? I couldn't stand his last 2 films, and that means for me he's got one good one and that is worrying. Conceptually all of his films are great, but so far he's nailed it once and it makes me afraid for this film."
LV426,3djgzj,clwestbr,7,Fri Jul 17 01:20:35 2015 UTC,"Chappie was really good! District 9 is  now a classic! If you don't like his style, then yes, you probably won't like this either. Me, I'm super amped for it."
LV426,3djgzj,ManofManyTalentz,11,Fri Jul 17 03:22:48 2015 UTC,"I really didn't like Chappie, and would say it is way too early to be calling District 9 a classic.  Honestly I felt like Chappie suffered from a lack of direction and pacing. Characters vanishing for 45 minutes or so at a time, phoned in performances by big stars, and a wonderful mo-cap performance that kind of kept me in. I dunno, just wasn't for me. Elysium was worse by far but Chappie was no bag of candy to me.  District 9 is great but I wouldn't say 'classic'. It is a really wonderful, intelligent science fiction film and I will readily admit that but not quite that caliber."
LV426,3djgzj,clwestbr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:25:52 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking it's fairly safe.   But I did forget about elysium. Such promise..... Chappie I had a blast with though. Apart from one Meh actor, and maybe a tweak at the ending, everything else was pretty awesome."
LV426,3djgzj,ManofManyTalentz,6,Fri Jul 17 03:32:25 2015 UTC,"To each their own. I sat through it with a friend who enjoyed it a lot, I just felt like some of it was incredibly forced. It rotated between that and phoned in for me, and it didn't land.   I thought Sharlto Copley did great, though. He was the best part of the movie."
LV426,3djgzj,clwestbr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:34:57 2015 UTC,I wonder if Copley will be in Alien 5? He's excellent in everything he's been in so far.
LV426,3djgzj,granddayandamornin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:14:16 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna guess yes. Two things Blomkamp always has are Copley and Johannesburg, so both will probably factor in."
LV426,3djgzj,clwestbr,2,Fri Jul 17 11:25:56 2015 UTC,"I think that worst case scenario we get a fanboys fantasy project that bombs. Best case we actually get the first properly GOOD Alien movie in a while. (Which I'm kinda optimistic for). After how ridiculous this franchise has gotten toward the end I don't see that too much harm can be done at this point. He has good ideas, nice visual aesthetics, let's give the guy a shot and see what comes out."
LV426,3djgzj,granddayandamornin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:13:18 2015 UTC,"We thought it couldn't' get worse than Alien Resurrection, but then came AvP2. It can be bad while still being made by a loving fan with good ideas.  Look, no one hopes I'm wrong more than I do, but Blomkamp's track record is against him."
LV426,3djgzj,clwestbr,2,Fri Jul 17 11:26:56 2015 UTC,"My biggest worry is that it's going to just a bunch of ""wouldn't it look cool if..."" moments. But no real substance to the story."
LV426,3djgzj,BoothaFett,4,Fri Jul 17 11:49:39 2015 UTC,It does suggest power suits might be involved. That suit on the right looks too bulky to just be armour.
LV426,3djgzj,AttackTribble,6,Thu Jul 16 19:58:01 2015 UTC,"Still looks like armor to me.  The most interesting part to me would be the Japanese part on the shoulder.  Which isn't too surprising with Yutani and supposed company angle.    But Blomkamp seems to have a thing for weaponry, enhancements, and robotic exo-skeletons.  So I wouldn't be surprised.  They're likely be a nod to the power loader somewhere."
LV426,3djgzj,Gnome_Chimpsky,8,Thu Jul 16 20:06:19 2015 UTC,That's a South Korean flag. Personally I'd rather see him give the mech-suits a rest for this movie.
LV426,3djgzj,CaptainJesusNFriends,5,Thu Jul 16 20:43:02 2015 UTC,"Could be drawing from the comic, Berserker I think? Where the criminals were re-purposed as pseudo-marines that attack and destroy hives?"
LV426,3djgzj,ManofManyTalentz,5,Thu Jul 16 22:29:14 2015 UTC,"Completely disagree. They have the technology, of course they'd weaponize it. That's like complaining there's too many cars in all 20th century movies."
LV426,3djgzj,avickthur,2,Fri Jul 17 03:27:28 2015 UTC,Mech-suits would make sense against xenos though
LV426,3djgzj,Gnome_Chimpsky,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:15:37 2015 UTC,"Indeed they would, and they featured frequently in the comics. I just never liked the idea of full-on armored combat in this universe, and much prefer the vulnerability of unprotected people being stalked by stealthy aliens."
LV426,3djgzj,Rasalom,4,Thu Jul 16 22:55:21 2015 UTC,You have plenty of movies with that. Time for a change.
LV426,3djgzj,RWRWRWRWW,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:50:09 2015 UTC,Yeah fuck world expansion. Dude there are only so many times you can do people getting chased down a tin can. I want some kickass big scale action in the vein of Edge of Tomorrow. You can't do a small scale horror film forever.   Re reading your comment and am baffled. You don't want full on armored combat in this universe? How oddly specific. You just made that shit up now. Weirdo.
LV426,3djgzj,Gnome_Chimpsky,2,Fri Jul 17 04:36:07 2015 UTC,"Haha what a reaction. Yeah I can see why people want that, but there are still plenty of angles you can take with a tighter, creepier setting. Look at Nightmare Asylum and the first one (Earth hive?) for instance.   I didn't make it up on the spot. The main things that annoyed me about the comics were 1: demystifying the Alien and constantly adding abilities to it and 2: too many suited guys shooting the shit out of the xenos.  But all this is apples & oranges so I'll shut up now."
LV426,3djgzj,RWRWRWRWW,2,Fri Jul 17 07:20:48 2015 UTC,Well if you paid attention to any of Neill's interviews you'd know he wants to do some creepy dark corridor stuff as well.   Sooooooo worry not.
LV426,3djgzj,Gnome_Chimpsky,2,Fri Jul 17 07:22:32 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I can't believe I didn't realize that considering there is one right across the office from me.  My mind automatically went to Japan because of Yutani.  That actually raises some questions.  Why specifically South Korea on the shoulder?  I find it somewhat weird that the countries would even exist as is in the future.  I agree with the mech suits, but I wouldn't be surprised if they play a part, especially if the company is involved and focusing on using the aliens as weapons, we're bound to see a display of futuristic power.  Those xenomorph inspired suits from the concept art would be way more interesting."
LV426,3djgzj,whats_not_in_a_name,4,Thu Jul 16 20:54:11 2015 UTC,"Britain and Japan merged around 2100 and became one of the three world empires. As far as I know Korea isn't mentioned anywhere, but I would assume it joined them at some point."
LV426,3djgzj,ahriik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:14:24 2015 UTC,"As would I, but lets be honest here, he loves mech suits and aliens is his favorite movie of all time. the aliens power-loader is the granddaddy of modern mech suits. its so iconic. no way do i see him passing up the opportunity to expand on it."
LV426,3djgzj,BRODUS,2,Thu Jul 16 21:01:54 2015 UTC,I was honestly kind of hoping that this film would steer away from Ripley's point of view. I'm curious to see the influence and interaction of the aliens on another person; why does it always have to be Ripley?
LV426,3djgzj,Vladamiur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:26:13 2015 UTC,I hope this is not another space hardware film.  I think Blomkamp captured government/general population response to an alien 'threat' very well in District 9 and it would be cool to see that in this new film.    I'm not too happy to see new xeno lifecycle stuff in the concept art.  Prometheus already introduced plenty of new mysteries about xenos so I feel like Alien 5 will convolute things even further.

I really want to like it, the atmosphere is amazing and the game itself is pretty fun, but as soon as the alien shows up it just stops it dead in it's tracks.   The first couple of times are fun and scary, but then it kills you and you have to reload and play the last five minutes over again, including all the scripted cut scene things. Then you have to do it again. And again. One section I had to reload at least ten times.  So after a while it gets to the point where the alien shows up and you're like ""oh, lame"" because it means that instead of making progress and finding out what happens next, you know you're just going to be repeating this section half a dozen times over and getting frustrated."

The story centers on Neytiri and her singer/bandleader husband Jake, along with their best friends and landlords Fred and Ethel Mertz. Neytiri is naïve and ambitious, with an undeserved zeal for stardom and a knack for getting herself and her husband into trouble whenever Neytiri yearns to make it in show business. Neytiri's husband, Jake, is an up-and-coming Pandoran singer and bandleader with an excitable personality. His patience is frequently tested by his wife's antics.

LV426,3d8a9v,bluefuzzyoctopus,2,Tue Jul 14 19:53:25 2015 UTC,What makes you think that? Ripley was created a long time before Hadley's Hope.
LV426,3d8a9v,Rasalom,2,Tue Jul 14 20:28:20 2015 UTC,"So? Doesn't mean the names weren't rolling around in someone's head. Maybe Ripley reminded them of that corner so they named Hadley's Hope.   Just saying, correlation is not causation."

LV426,3d5v55,CylonSpring,3,Mon Jul 13 19:42:23 2015 UTC,"That kinda depends on your source. If you've only seen the films, that's true. But it's explained in some of the novels that any xeno can become a Queen, given the right circumstances. It needs enough space and a large enough food/host source. It starts to generate a mass amount of hormones and pheromones, and slowly grows out into the new carapace. It wont be as big or powerful as a true Queen, but the first egg laid will be a Queen larva.  Interestingly enough, if a Queen is born and doesn't have enough space/food, it can postpone it's growth until it can fulfill the requirements."

LV426,3d4u8z,CoffinDancr,13,Mon Jul 13 15:13:50 2015 UTC,"I watched Aliens when I was about 5 or 6.  The part that stuck with me from that showing was when Bishop was ripped in half.  At the time, I didn't understand what an android was and assumed that humans' guts were white.  I also saw Jaws for the first time.  When they gutted that shark looking for a victim, all that white stuff spilled out.  Additionally, I watched Empire Strikes Back around this time. When Han slices open the Tauntaun, all the guts were white.  For years I thought our guts were all white on the inside."
LV426,3d4u8z,postal83,3,Mon Jul 13 19:28:59 2015 UTC,"I was 4 but it was the exact same scene that stuck with me. My father said I watched the whole movie, but after that scene I quietly got up and left the room lol."

LV426,3d4u8z,Infinity6,2,Mon Jul 13 17:40:35 2015 UTC,This is pretty much how it happened for me too.  Been hooked since.  Probably my second favorite movie (behind John Carpenter's The Thing).
LV426,3d4u8z,B-rizzle,8,Tue Jul 14 06:05:10 2015 UTC,"Aliens when I was about five or six.  I was only half watching it so I wasn't paying attention when Bishop was outed as an Android.  I only caught when he licked up his own blood and thought it was something related to the Aliens.  So when the Queen stabbed him through the chest, I thought it was exploding from inside him."
LV426,3d4u8z,jason80,7,Mon Jul 13 15:22:00 2015 UTC,"Mine is kinda similar...     I was around 9 or 10, watching TV with my mother at night when some show just ended. One of us started channelsurfing and found a group of people sitting around a table, eating and talking(thought it was about truckers at firdt).  We left it on for a few seconds waiting to see what happened, when suddenly one of them starts convulsing... Next thing you know, there's blood everywhere, and I was like ""Let's leave this on a bit longer...""

I grabbed Aliens because I thought it had a cool cover, and then proceeded to watch it with one eye open while my Aunt laughed hysterically at my fear."
LV426,3d4u8z,SteelChicken,5,Mon Jul 13 19:26:45 2015 UTC,Parents took me to the original Alien theatrical release.   I was 7.  They paid the price later in child psychologist fees.
LV426,3d4u8z,f0k4ppl3,4,Mon Jul 13 19:57:46 2015 UTC,Watched it in the theater on release week. I should have been 12 at the time. I nagged my mom for weeks before it opened because we all still had Star Wars fever and this looked so cool! Mom never liked sci-fi. It was the most visceral and terrifying experience that I had ever had in a movie theater. We would not have a VCR in our house until 1985 so until then I didn't know how it looked like when Brett gets chomped in front of the cat because I closed my eyes at that point. My consolation for whimping out is that my neighbor across the street fainted out cold after the chestburster scene when they saw it on their fancy-smancy VCR.
LV426,3d4u8z,gloomndoom,2,Mon Jul 13 19:59:21 2015 UTC,"Saw it in the theatre as well. I think my mom thought it was also like Star Wars. I made it until Bishop was rekt and I walked (ran) out, my mom coming to get me a few seconds later. Scared the epic living shit out of me but remains ones of my top five favorite movies. I have older kids and we do ""classic movie night"" at least once per month. They watched Aliens in their teens and I think they might have been as flipped out as I was in 1979."
LV426,3d4u8z,rbrumble,4,Tue Jul 14 04:30:36 2015 UTC,"I read the book by Alan Dean Foster, because I was too young to see it at the theatre when it came out.  Watched it on VHS not long after, and was blown away."

The first two movies I remember seeing are Commando and Predator when I was 7 I believe. A few years later my dad brought home Aliens and said we should watch it, and we did. After that I remember getting the entire series on DVD and watching then in order with him over the course of a few nights."

It wasn't until many years later I figured out it was Alien I had seen.   The whole thing with an unimaginable horror running loose on a claustrophobic spaceship always creeped me the fuck out, but then a friend showed me Aliens on a shitty VCR and a shittier TV (which was interesting because you couldn't tell what the hell was going on most of the time, so your imagination filled in the blanks). That one was almost worse because of the insane buildup before you even see an alien for the first time."

We got a copy of the movie on VHS well before it hit the stores for sale.  I remember watching it with my dad when I was like... 8 years old.  Haha..... I remember my dad telling me not to repeat the bad words on the movie.  It was scary,  but I've been hooked on the Alien franchise and world ever since.  No regrets and hey.... I turned out okay."

LV426,3d4u8z,handsomescot85,3,Mon Jul 13 19:55:07 2015 UTC,I was about 11 and I recorded Aliens off the television without my parents knowing. Had a vhs recorder in my room. It was a Saturday night. The Sunday I put it on in my room and it's my favourite movie till this day.
LV426,3d4u8z,AttackTribble,3,Mon Jul 13 20:30:34 2015 UTC,I saw it in the cinema on its initial run. Knew next to nothing about it in advance. Loved it.

LV426,3d4u8z,Looter629,3,Mon Jul 13 22:21:28 2015 UTC,"I was 10 when my mom got a Beta copy of Aliens from my uncle. Watched it that night,2 times the next day, and at least once a week for an amount of time I can't recall....I know I annoyed my parents to death though. I am 35 now and when we all get together my whole family will make Aliens references, not because they like the film, but because I made them watch it 8 million times. I still watch it at least every other month now.  Edit: I was in Florida 2 weeks ago and it was 90-100 degrees (feels like temp) every day. My mom must have said ""yea man, but it's a dry heat"" 20 times."

I still have that copy too. Oh man that was such a memorable day.   That was where my love for the franchise started. I sadly didn't end seeing it in order though. I didn't get to catch up until later, and the order ended up being Alien, Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, and finally, Aliens. I was about 8 or so by then so I don't think it was a huge deal. I remember asking for xenomorphs toys and drawing them and all that. Ripley became a childhood hero of mine. After kind of forgetting the franchise for awhile, I picked it up again back in 2013. Felt nostalgic and watched the first two films. And from then on its become my ""Star Wars"" like you said."

My dad (who didn't know much about it, in his defense) thought ""oh, this is a sci-fi movie, and Hugo loves sci-fi!"" In a terrible moment of parenting, he let me watch it until Brett died, then he realized he should probably send me to bed instead. I still have nightmares to this day. I couldn't watch monster movies for years, until I decided to rent the entire Alien trilogy when I was 18 to watch it by myself, alone in my apartment. Now I'm a fan. :)"

They had never heard of it, but after much cohersion she allowed it.  My brother in lay and I spent the whole movie laughing and cheering while she averted her eyes and dreaded the lecture to come from my mother.  I've been a massive fan since and can recite every line from Aliens (and have done so during long boring shifts, to the delight of some and the frustration of others)."

LV426,3d4u8z,DreadAdvocate,2,Tue Jul 14 01:54:40 2015 UTC,"I've been playing Starcraft since I was 5, and around the time I was 11, I started reading about how heavily influenced the original game was by the first two films. So at 11 I watched Alien and fell in love, and at 12 I got the Aliens collector's edition on DVD for my birthday and fell in love again.  I mean, my love for sci-fi was really blossoming at that time. I was already a fan of Star Wars, Doom, and obviously Starcraft, but at the same time I discovered Warhammer 40K, started taking Star Trek seriously, and sneaking Halo and Doom whenever my mother couldn't enforce her no-M-rated-games rule."
LV426,3d4u8z,justformemes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:18:50 2015 UTC,My mom(now in her 60s) is a big fan and she got me into sci-fi in general.  My dad loves history and non-fiction so bit of a contrast there.  In the late 80s early 90s when I was around 10ish I'd watch Star Trek TNG with her and my elder sister and when around 12 I probably saw Aliens for the first time.  Scared the fuck out of me but I recognized Michael Biehn from The Abyss and Terminator so that was cool.  Terminator also scared the living shit out of me when I was about 8 or so.  I was a bit of bitch when it came to horror movies when I was younger but damn did it make me love all things science fiction.  I honestly can't remember when I first saw Alien but learning about it's creation it really made me appreciate it and I watch it probably twice a year at least.

The scene that struck Me the most (this was the 1979 one) was at the very beginning when everyone was sitting around the table drying their hair, smoking, complaining about the coffee. The alien was definitely frightening but the human story about ongoing working class struggles  during a time when ftl travel is a common thing really intrigued me."

Like most of you the movie had me from the start and I sat in rapt fascination and horror through the chest bursting scene; it was so original and terrifying and I genuinely don't think there was anything quite like it at the time.   I think the most frightening part for me though was Ripley being all alone and her seeing the fully grown alien for the first time while all the strobe lights and warnings were going on.   I had never seen Sigourney before and to me she was exotic and beautiful and I couldn't help falling just a little bit in love with her.   The whole experience made a tremendous impression on me and I've been hooked ever since."

Among the things on display was the Power Loader and Queen from Aliens. I had no idea it was from Aliens at the time, I just thought it looked awesome.  Later, in 1990, I was pawing through the spinner racks at the local comic book store and happened across the Earth War series.  I immediately recognized the creatures on the cover, made the connection and read the Hell out of that series.  Then, one day while I was down at the video store my parents owned, I snuck Alien and Aliens into my backpack, brought them home and watched them back to back...  Been hooked since..."

Overuse of quotation marks, no understanding of proper comma use, and completely unresearched other than ""some shit I remember reading at some point somewhere."" Add in the petulant, know-it-all tone and this definitely doesn't endear me to the writer's opinions.  I thought District 9 was a good film, didn't see any of the others mentioned, but most of all I will never understand all the shit Alien 3 gets. ""Oh boo hoo, they killed my favorite characters, that's so unfair and inapropriate in a series characterized by unrelenting fatalism and inescapable tragedy.""

Chappie was fun, and definitely touches on the AI rights topic.  Blomkamp makes good scifi with interesting visions of the future coupled to very human social messages... my only concern is I don't really want to see Android Equality messages in the next Alien.  If he can avoid the social commentary aspect of his storytelling and stick to hard scifi, he can do the series proud."
LV426,3czx2k,john-five,14,Tue Jul 14 13:20:51 2015 UTC,"This is punishment before the crime. Alien 3 (while not the best) is still a worthy addition to the alien saga. Alien resurrection isn't in many ways but it's still entertaining in its silly gung-ho kind of way (I know, I know get the lynch mob).   Ripping a director apart who, to my knowledge, hasn't even started filming yet is ridiculous.   Believe me if alien 5 is terrible, I won't be disappointed because the franchise has not done it's self any favours in the past 15 years. However, judging something based purely because of who is attached to it is really narrow minded. You might even like it. So give it time wait for more info and maybe a trailer and then you can start throwing about opinions, until then STFU."

I just think you should reserve your opinion until you've more solid info about where the series is going and basing an argument on a directors past work is not the way to go. Take Ridley Scott for example, he's done questionable films (Robin Hood, Prometheus and exodus: gods and kings) but he's also made masterpieces (gladiator, blade runner and of course alien), love the guy for creating excellent cinema but he's not perfect."

The last person who's going to ruin this already DEAD and in need of resuscitation franchise is the District 9 auteur. Ridley will balance him out and vice versa.   The resident evil guy, the black comedy French guy, and the visual effects nobody-duo ruined the franchise. But Neill? No chance. He's the best mix of experienced and compatible we've had since Cameron who had The Terminator under his belt.   Fincher was compatible but inexperienced. Jeunet was experienced but incompatible.

District 9 was okay, Elysium and Chappie were just god awful. He's always trying to be preachy and teach some moral lesson about social classes, humanity, etc. And it's always set in South Africa. Nobody cares. I wish Ridley Scott or Cameron would return and take the helm to restore Alien to its former glory."
LV426,3czx2k,granddayandamornin,14,Sun Jul 12 08:24:25 2015 UTC,I liked both district 9 and chappie a lot.  He could really take this franchise is a new and exciting direction.  At the very least it will be nice to have a new alien movie to watch.

So Hicks has already been confirmed as being one of the characters returning, so the speculation was who else besides Ripley would also be returning from Aliens.

He is very much dead.  I suppose the only angle would be to say that Bishop came across him somehow, saved him and had stashed him aboard the ship, and for some reason not initially told Hick or Ripley, maybe because Hudson was by then impregnated with an Alien, and that Bishop was smuggling the Xeno back to Weyland....   ....Oh crap, that actually works.

It's better than some executive getting the bright idea of hunting for a new Alien script because market research says it will do well (Although that obviously still happened afterwards).  The only sure fire way to make Alien 5 worthy of the first two would be with James Cameron behind the wheel, but I think we've been holding our breath long enough on that."
LV426,3ce11m,durandal59,7,Tue Jul 7 07:23:54 2015 UTC,Being a fan doesn't make him the genius director he needs to be to meet the standards of this legendary series. If you ask me they should just stop it and earn their money on the curb.
LV426,3ce11m,dr_rentschler,6,Tue Jul 7 09:52:29 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that sentiment. But there was zero interest in even making another one. Sigorney Weaver is getting too old. I don't mind one last stab with her as Ripley. He has passion and a somewhat unique vision, I'm interested to see what shakes."
LV426,3ce11m,Beeslo,14,Tue Jul 7 13:16:11 2015 UTC,I hope it doesn't end up being Ripley's Crystal Skull.
LV426,3ce11m,TheSharkFromJaws,2,Tue Jul 7 14:40:15 2015 UTC,"I don't mind if Sigorney Weaver is in or not. It surely does not take Sigourney Weaver to make a good Alien movie. The fact that they're dragging here in every time just illustrates their desperation. Why not ""just"" make a cool spin off, or sequel (it shouldn't be hard if you think about it, just put aliens in it and make it half decent)...but no, Hollywoods script authors just have adapted totally to modern times... make the quick buck with recycled shit. Shit i'm just 35 and already raging about modern times..."
LV426,3ce11m,dr_rentschler,2,Tue Jul 7 14:57:42 2015 UTC,"I agree. There only element that makes me want this is the Dark Horse comic psuedo sequel that came out after Aliens. In it Newt grows up on Earth, interacts with a crippled Hicks, aliens appear in masse on earth, they escape, and Ripley shows up to kick some ass. It was great. Then Alien3 got made, characters in the comic were renamed not to add confusion to Newt and Hicks dying at the beginning of Alien3. So if this is potentially a way of giving us a what if scenario of that storyline, I'm down especially if Weaver is onboard. But with that said, I feel like this will be her last, so hopefully its a good enough movie on its own, that the franchise can continue with other characters."

LV426,3ce11m,TheSharkFromJaws,2,Tue Jul 7 13:04:13 2015 UTC,I've conversations that simply state this is possibly a what if scenario. That the Alien 3 continuity still exists and its being erased by Fox. Sigourney wanted another shot and they didn't like where Resurrection took the character. So just do a what if scenario where an egg didn't somehow get planted on board the Surlacco.
LV426,3ce11m,Beeslo,2,Tue Jul 7 13:18:42 2015 UTC,"I think I'd be more accepting of that if this story were presented as a comic book or novel. Alien: Out of the Shadows was a very effective and thrilling book that did backflips with the canon, but in the end it was OK because of the format. As a film I feel that this just confuses the timelines and what not. Weaver's significant clout at Fox might end up doing more long time harm than good to the Ripley character.  I like that Disney has made the decision to have 1 canonical timeline with Star Wars. It may be a bit much to not have any fun off-shoots in the SW canon from now on, but I feel like they are taking the legacy of that franchise very seriously."
LV426,3ce11m,TheSharkFromJaws,2,Tue Jul 7 14:38:09 2015 UTC,"Well, its more that the EU got way too big for Star Wars, I wasn't surprised when Disney pretty much declared they were starting from scratch. Hell, the EU pretty much already told the story of what happened after Episode VI for pretty much all the characters. All the relationships they had, children, deaths. Disney had no choice but to pretty much declare it non-canon. Yes, there were other EU elements they could have kept in place, but I imagine having a clean slate to work with makes it much easier to shape the direction of the franchise in the way they want it, which is fine. Being plagued by continuity issues down the line, best to avoid those."

LV426,3ce11m,TheSharkFromJaws,0,Tue Jul 7 12:57:00 2015 UTC,"Elysium was a good follow up, but it wasn't as good as District 9. It had some excellent direction, camerawork, and visuals.

Most of the criticism I see from it is about an obscure african band being cast as themselves. As someone who isn't familiar with them, I couldn't care less; they suited things fine.  My own criticisms are mostly that it tried to explore philosophical themes well beyond the action and drama movie that it is, but dropped the ball completely by not bothering to try to do anything with them.

As a director alone his style is absolutely perfect for this franchise, as a writer I know people aren't his biggest fans but at the very least I think he's competent and will be able to write an enjoyable movie.   People like to point out the he's 1 for 3 in his efforts but I'd like to point out the before Aliens, James Cameron was 1 for 2, one of which is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, or if you include is short film as well, was also 1 for 3."

And though I'm really into this movie I'm also scared about this issue."

The Blade Runner sequel is being directed by Denis Villeneuve and shot by Roger Deakins. Also, I don't know where your ""more is better"" assumption is coming from. I've never heard someone mention how many movies were made when they talk about whether a franchise was good or not. Sequels can be good. And it's not only science fiction and horror; it's pretty much every genre. I'd rather not be overly cynical towards future movies, and have hope that they'll be good. I also disagree with ""the franchise becomes cheap and meaningless."" Alien and Aliens will always be the movies that they are. All the shit movies that came after aren't going to change that.

LV426,3c8t06,1upD,2,Mon Jul 6 02:41:17 2015 UTC,"Dan O'Bannon's and Giger's original idea was that the alien fed on some victims, others were captured, cocooned, and turned into eggs. That way one alien, even if killed, could leave behind eggs that could lay dormant until disturbed, releasing facehuggers, which would then produce more xenomorphs; a self replicating biological weapon. Hence the deleted scene in Alien where Ripley finds Dallas and Brett; Dallas was still somewhat human but Brett was almost completely transformed into a new egg."

This means that the chestburster will probably emerge in an unsecured area and will not encounter much resistance and so will have a better chance to survive and wreak havoc.  The aliens are shown to have an insect like hive society and so it's likely that no xenos other than the queen even have reproductive capabilities.  Also that's just the way their biology works, the argument could be made that it would make more sense for humans to photosynthesise but we never evolved that way so we can't.

We meatbags spend a great deal of energy just keeping ourselves at 98.6; if you don't have to do that, you can be more energy efficient.  There is a cost though; you may be sluggish in the cold. Who says they don't eat?  They're not shown consuming things on screen, but then we never see Ripley poop, yet we know she probably does at some point. The chestburster eats its way out, so it has at least some energy stores from that.  It may go find a corpse or food store somewhere thereafter; there could be rats, dogs, cats, or other small mammals on these large space ships for them to eat.  Since people die in every Alien film, the morgue is also a good bet for meat. They may not need food exclusively in the way that we do.  For all we know, they're just eating meet for the nitrogen (like a Venus fly trap), and they actually get their energy from some sort of chemo- or photo-synthesis.  They could pull carbon out of the air in the way that plants do (if they're even carbon based) and chew on electrical wires to get the energy to assemble their tissues, for all we know.

Insects have traditionally been considered as poikilotherms (animals in which body temperature is variable and dependent on ambient temperature) as opposed to being homeothermic (animals which maintain a stable internal body temperature regardless of external influences). However, the term temperature regulation, or thermoregulation, is currently used to describe the ability of insects and other animals to maintain a stable temperature (either above or below ambient temperature), at least in a portion of their bodies by physiological or behavioral means.  While many insects are ectotherms (animals in which their heat source is primarily from the environment), others are endotherms (animals which can produce heat internally by biochemical processes). These endothermic insects are better described as regional heterotherms because they are not uniformly endothermic. When heat is being produced, different temperatures are maintained in different parts of their bodies, for example, moths generate heat in their thorax prior to flight but the abdomen remains relatively cool.

LV426,3c5d12,cokentots,8,Sun Jul 5 18:40:37 2015 UTC,Not in the films though the first films novelisation says the Alien finds a cold store of meat to feast on. The films are different and ambiguous with Alien 3 being the first film to show the alien eating. This is in the lead works where it eats then drags a body away when startled. There were plans to cut the scene and have cocooned prisoners but at the directors behest it was kept as an idea.
LV426,3c5d12,gogoluke,3,Sun Jul 5 00:23:17 2015 UTC,"Alien nearly had a scene where Brett finds the Nostromo's food stores have been all eaten, but it was cut for timing and pacing reasons, IIRC. It's in the novelization."

It isn't explicitly stated, but alluded to by Vickers. The life pod had two years worth of atmosphere and by the time Shaw hides away in the grounded pod, the alarm is warning her of the lack of atmosphere. I was under the impression that the giant facehugger used the atmosphere to grow. The Xeno is designed to survive so it can proliferate and kill, and every time we see them, it's in a contained atmosphere. Also, the containment area where the eggs are stored was controlled, and once the stasis field was broken, an atmospheric source (a space suit) was introduced and the egg awoke. I think the Xenos can eat meat, but they can also rely solely on breathing to grow."

LV426,3c5d12,dfurball,2,Tue Jul 7 18:19:20 2015 UTC,"In Alien Ash makes the comment that the facehugger does some fancy cell regeneration with silicon:  ""I have confirmed that he's got an outer layer of protein polysaccharides. Has a funny habit of shedding his cells and replacing them with polarized silicon, which gives him a prolonged resistance to adverse environmental conditions.""  Knowing Giger's work one could assume that the xenomorph may in fact be a created organism, further a biological weapon, possibly synthetic in nature. With complex chemistry the organism could just simply consume things within the air and then self-replicate. Plants do this. There's no telling how a silicon based life form could generate energy or replicate cells, possibly by simply moving. Think of the Andromeda Strain.

Captain Dallas, Executive Officer Kane, and Navigator Lambert investigate a derelict spacecraft that contains the fossilised remains of an unknown alien species, and thousands of Xenomorph eggs. One of the Xenomorph spore (‘facehugger’) attaches itself to Kane’s face and plants an embryo in his throat, which then hatches, killing the host. The hatchling (‘chestburster’) grows to over 7 feet tall and kills Dallas and Engineer’s Mate Brett. Warrant Officer Ripley discovers that Weyland-Yutani want the Alien specimen and the crew of the Nostromo are expendable. It is revealed Science Officer Ash is in fact a Hyperdyne Systems 120-A/2 android, who has been protecting the Alien. Chief Engineer Parker renders Ash inoperative when Ash attacks Ripley. Parker and Lambert are killed by the Alien whilst evacuating the Nostromo. Ripley rigs the ship to self-destruct and escapes on the shuttlecraft Narcissus with the ship’s cat Jonesy. The Alien also escapes on the shuttle, but Ripley manages to blow it out of the airlock, effectively killing it.  http://alienanthology.wikia.com/wiki/Alien_Universe_Timeline  I'm assuming June 3 is waking the crew up and getting to the planet, 4th is exploring LV426 and returning, along with 25 hours of repairs as quoted by Parker and taking off again, chestburster pops out somewhere between the 5th and 6th day and the Nostromo is destroyed by the end of that day."

LV426,3bv7g7,Skullmonkey_,6,Thu Jul 2 23:21:23 2015 UTC,A possibility is that the runner received some human characteristics because the queen it originated from was birthed from a human. So perhaps the Alien is an ever evolving creature and the iconic version we know is only one generation.   That's been my assumption. The reason they're such perfect killing machines is that they're constantly taking in new dna and adaptations and improving themselves. And have probably been drifting around space doing that for millions of years.
LV426,3bv7g7,Trullius,3,Thu Jul 2 19:13:58 2015 UTC,I like the idea that it is only queens who incorporate host DNA. Meaning any subsequent face huggers would pass on the new characteristics of that queen. This would mean that every new queen could adapt herself to the environment based on her hosts features. This would make for a more consistent hive with a clear cast system instead of a variety of individual xenomorphs all with their own Incorporated adaptation's.
LV426,3bv7g7,AndrewEpidemic,2,Thu Jul 2 22:57:47 2015 UTC,"I've always looked at it as the Facehuggers and the embryos they carry are genetic blank slates.

LV426,3bv7g7,darkempath,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:31:35 2015 UTC,But then how do you explain all the human traits in the runner?
LV426,3bv7g7,Razoride,3,Fri Jul 3 01:59:24 2015 UTC,"What you consider ""Human traits"" could be part of the standard Xeno genetic template.  The Xenomorph might not assimilate ALL the genetic features of its host and take on a 100% similar appearance.  Another thing to consider is that this particular Xeno didn't seem to have the normal gestation period in either the dog or the ox.  The Facehugger wasn't attached to its host nearly as long as it was with Kane otherwise it would have been discovered still attached to the dog or ox.  That could be why it didn't more closely resemble a dog because it didn't have enough time to grow into its new form.  However, my real world answer of ""Someone decided to do their own thing when they should have left it to the Master and botched it"" still stands as a reasonable explanation."

LV426,3bmk56,wfo92gt,6,Tue Jun 30 18:07:50 2015 UTC,"It gets better: [Alien Isolation/Metroid Prime] is a game that took the franchise back to its roots, was highly praised, and takes place after the first and second main installments of the franchise.  And when you play Alien Isolation, there's also a pervasive Metroid Fusion vibe during the whole game.    Spoilers for both games onwards:  . . . . . .     Both games are metroidvanias that railroad you a lot before giving you freedom of exploration in the late game. The games take place in a space station composed of different sectors connected by trams/elevators. You can't defeat the Alien/SA-X and you must escape or hide from it. The backstory is pretty much equivalent (expedition lands in planet LV426/SR388, a crewmember gets a attacked by a lifeform and said lifeform ends up being taken to Sevastopol/BSL where it wreaks havoc You find yourself in an isolated sector that gets jettisoned along with the Alien/SA-X and you escape it just in time, then you realize Weyland-Yutani/The Federation was using the station to get the Aliens/Metroids. And then you find out there's more than one Alien/SA-X on board. The station has problems with its reactor. You go down there and find it covered in organic material (Alien Nest/plants from a boss creature) that you end up destroying, restoring the reactor to normal. You're accompanied by a cybernetic advisor that ends up being humane (Christopher Samuels the synthetic/Adam Malkovich's uploaded consciousness) The game ends by going to a command bridge in the first sector of the game, behind a door that was locked when you first arrive. At this point you can harm the SA-X/Alien due to the Plasma Beam/Flamethrower. Then you have to reach the ship you arrived in, but right before it you have an encounter with a major threat with cutscenes (In Metroid's case there's the Omega Metroid + Last SA-X giving you the Ice Beam, and in Alien's case this is the extended second nest escape and the swarm surrounding you while disengaging the Torrens' anchoring) and the station is destroyed immediately after by crashing and disintegrating against the nearby planet.   And finally, as things go to hell in Alien Isolation, especially during the second nest sequence, it feels like a Metroid escape sequence without the countdown. The explosions, fires and quakes do not help at all. Personally, I found myself unconsciously playing this on my head during the late game as I had to hide from the Alien and escape the crumbling station at the same time - This was the point when I realized it was just like Metroid Fusion. Naturally, Ridley's theme started playing on my head during the final escape from the second nest."

But EVERY AvP comic storyline was set in the future....how could it be set on another planet if - Wait, the setting is on present day EARTH? Come on; Ripley's overriding goal of the ENTIRE 'Alien' film series is to prevent them from reaching Earth at ANY COST...so, I guess now that's just, tossed out the window or whatever... Not only on present day Earth, but in a frozen pyramid on Antarctica? ANTARCTICA? But...if we know ONE THING about the Predator, it's that they seek out the hottest climates... ""Only in the hottest years, this happens..."" ... ""Drawn by heat and conflict...""

LV426,3bkqtf,TheSporkening,4,Tue Jun 30 01:00:50 2015 UTC,"It's simple. The movie is showing us how does the infestation work right there.  If you're unconscious, you're not moving. If you're not moving you're not vibrating the environment to tip off the eggs that there's someone nearby to infect. When Newt woke up and tried to move while cocooned, an egg immediately reacted and the facehugger started going for her, but Ripley arrived just in time.  This is the exact same thing that happens in Alien Isolation. As soon as Amanda wakes up, she escapes. There's an egg in front of her that doesn't hatch at all. Obviously this one was meant for her and presumably hasn't matured yet/it's a narrative device to show she's clean. To drive the point home, free facehuggers still attack her during the escape.

LV426,3bkqtf,gogoluke,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:01:46 2015 UTC,It can be fairly surmised that News was intended to incubate a Queen. She is at ground level in a separate antechamber with different biography that she could have eventually escaped from. From this we can assume that as the alien colony was a certain size and hosts less prevalent the Queen created a Queen face hugger in the egg. Newt would free herself and infect new areas... if she were in a differing location...

So when filming Alien, Kotto would walk up to Ridley Scott like every day before they got to Parker's big confrontation and he'd tell him that he was gonna kick that alien's ass, that there was no way this Alien was gonna get Parker. That's just the way it was and Scott would have to know that.  Just staying in character or actually trying to get Scott to reconsider the script? I don't know. But I always liked that story."

I got Ripley with the flamethrower.  I'd love to get the facehugger, facehugger Kane, Big Chap, Egg, or Chestburster Kane, but with the mystery boxes, I can't justify $12.50 a pop.  I'm happy with my Ripley one.  I added her to my excessive number of 4 aliens from the Funko Mystery Minis.  Those are a little more accessible at $7 a pop.  http://i.imgur.com/g2Jz0c2.jpg"
LV426,3b7gyv,mewithoutCthulhu,2,Fri Jun 26 16:55:52 2015 UTC,I feel up the boxes its easy to identify the facehugger and big chap because they're lighter and heavier respectively also you can feel the big chaps head through the box they're about 7.99 pounds in the UK!
LV426,3b7gyv,mewithoutCthulhu,2,Fri Jun 26 17:07:11 2015 UTC,"I might have to do that this weekend.  That's how I ended up with so many aliens from the Funko Sci-Fi ones.  I go the alien on my first try by gambling with the heaviest one with as little wiggle room in the box.  I bought three more using the same technique.  Little did I know that that was a pretty solid way of getting the alien, because I ended up with three more, including the limited edition silver alien."

LV426,3au4ge,no_awning_no_mining,19,Tue Jun 23 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"Yes.   Biosyn (Dodgson's company) becomes the biotech base of Weyland Industries.  After the Ingen and Masrani incidents, international law prohibits de-extinction of animals that cannot be integrated into modern ecosystems.  However, Biosyn has already acquired viable dinosaur embryos from both the Ingen and Masrani incidents, leading to a huge, unused genetic library. It sits, abandoned, in cold storage.  Decades into the future, Peter Weyland rises to power and Biosyn is one of the first companies to be purchased by Weyland Corp. Before the events of Prometheus, Weyland has been busy terraforming: Building Better Worlds.    International law doesn't apply to other planets.  One of the terraforming tests in the Alpha Centauri system yields a planet that is too close to the sun for comfortable habitation by humans.  Weyland sets up a research base and begins cloning dinosaurs for possible military and medical applications.  The project is largely automated and run mostly by androids, but a small contingent of scientists and military personnel maintain a presence.   But wait, do we know any species that love hot conditions and large, dangerous prey...?   Tl;dr: Predators take over the planet and tire of killing mundane dinosaurs, so they introduce Xenomorphs to up the ante.  Scientists, military, and androids fight to stay alive.

Hell, I'd look at a Xeno at the zoo. Could you imagine how cool that'd be?  The only reason that attempts to study the Xeno have been so bad in the movies is because it's either done at the careless cost of human life (Alien), or captured as a bio-weapon (Aliens). If they found a way to capture a Xeno without, say, tricking Ripley into getting facehugged, I'd have no complaints."

That's the largest piece and has the towers. It's a small space station that must have been in orbit above a mining planet. Now that it's full of refined ore, it's heading back to Earth. The Nostromo is the tug ship that's bringing the station back to Earth. That's what detached and went down to LV-426. The Narcissus is the small shuttle and escape ship on the Nostromo's undercarriage. This is what Ripley escapes in."

LV426,3al06i,gogoluke,0,Sun Jun 21 15:39:23 2015 UTC,The pose and costume is at odds to the film. This makes Ripley vulnerable and available seemingly in perpetuity in her hypersleep. This is at odds to the nobsexual and survivor as portrayed in the films. She may be temporarily terrorised but she is never a victim as she is portrayed here. She never needs us the viewer to gaze upon her or save her as here.

I was just wondering what others have done and if they have any pictures of how they have it setup to see it out of the box."
LV426,3a6d7p,b0yfr0mthedwarf,3,Wed Jun 17 18:52:26 2015 UTC,"Got mine from Entertainment Earth a couple weeks ago - its one of the best Alien figures NECA has done by far. I'll post some pics when I get home. As for the box, they've been using high quality boxes (not bubbled plastic) for ease of unpacking and repacking - same goes for the Terminator line. A great step up for the company."
LV426,3a6d7p,RomRipper,2,Thu Jun 18 16:47:52 2015 UTC,"If you really want to leave in in the box & show off the blue side they also sell them boxed showing off the blue side. Got mine today,took it out of the box."
LV426,3a6d7p,RomRipper,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:25:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed that.  I actually bought mine while on vacation in Seattle at the Pike Place Market.  The stores they have in that place are so random, but they had a fantastic store full of action figures and geeky shit.  I could have bought an alien bust from Aliens for like $1200.  I didn't know the Alien 3 figure was out yet and was pleasantly surprised to see it.  The only one they had the with blue side facing out was in a box that was slightly damaged.  Being as anal as I am, and considering I might leave it in the box, I got the one that was in the most flawless box I could find."
LV426,3a6d7p,BoothaFett,2,Wed Jun 24 13:21:08 2015 UTC,My wife works in downtown Seattle.She found it @ the store you speak of:Golden Age Collectables. I didn't know it was out either. she was going to grab it for me but I thought the $30.00 was steep. I found it on Amazon for 21.00 free shipping.
LV426,3a1gez,hughk,19,Tue Jun 16 14:11:15 2015 UTC,"honestly, it amazes me every year that this guy is still pushing out movies.  he was 39 when Alien was released.    him and harry dean stanton (who was 53 for the movie and 90 this year) just amaze me at their longevity and film/tv output."
LV426,3a1gez,mrmyrth,6,Tue Jun 16 14:19:32 2015 UTC,"Not so many movies these days, but still a lot of stage and TV work. Recently for example, played ""The War Doctor"" in Dr Who.   Actually, one of the things that got me about the movie was the quality of the ""B"" character actors like Harry Dean Stanton and John Hurt, let alone the slightly more prominent Ian Holm and Tom Skerrit. They were responsible for the world-building of Nostromo as a ""working ship"" as opposed to research vessel or whatever."

LV426,3a1gez,NathanBarley,8,Wed Jun 17 13:56:27 2015 UTC,It is kind of ironic that an actor famous for portraying a person with an alien growth in him has been diagnosed with one. It seems to have been caught fairly early and Sir John Hurt is optimistic about his prognosis and is continuing to work.

LV426,3a1gez,Brandon_Storm,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:21:42 2015 UTC,They apparently caught it really early. That very good. It does increase chances of survival from 20% to something closer to 50-60%. Good thoughts to him.

LV426,3a0o35,onetruebipolarbear,24,Tue Jun 16 08:37:33 2015 UTC,"Say what you will about Alien 3, the setting was fantastic."
LV426,3a0o35,Flaaarp,6,Tue Jun 16 11:46:44 2015 UTC,"I didn't particularly care for it at first (not that I disliked it really, just felt considerably weaker than the previous two films). Then again, compared to the fourth film, Alien 3 was a tour de force.   That said, I enjoyed it more each time in subsequent viewings, which tends to happen with Fincher films. And when the Assembly Cut came out, it finally felt like a complete and compelling movie (even without Fincher's input).   I never did see the re-dubbed Anthology version."
LV426,3a0o35,dziban303,2,Tue Jun 16 15:50:19 2015 UTC,I tried picturing other routes for Alien 3 but I couldn't really think up better ideas. Going bigger than Cameron would've made everything really shitty. Going for another original was not an option either. They could've gone for introducing the Alien's makers like Prometheus but I'm not sure the time was right for such an attempt. And I really wouldn't want to see anyone else but Ridley Scott explain it.    So in the end Alien 3 is a really humble movie that simply tried to offer something with the aliens that hasn't done before while still remaining faithful to the franchise.    Couldn't be saying the same thing about what followed.
LV426,3a0o35,Thefriendlyfaceplant,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:44:54 2015 UTC,There was an idea of the film being set on a wooden planet which was inhabited by a religious group of the sort. Some of the producers thought the idea of a wooden planet was unrealistic so they can'ed the idea. There's a lot of info regarding it out there mentioned in the quadrilogy. Its super interesting. Would love to chat about it if you get the chance to check it out!
LV426,3a0o35,monsterluv,2,Sat Jun 20 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"Sorta in the same boat. The first time I saw it, I was like 15 after my buddy recommended the series to me. ""Avoid Alien 3, though; it's just horrible,"" he said. So naturally I watched it, but I think with his prejudice playing a significant role, I hated it.  Once I got to college, I read up a little more about how Fincher got screwed over during production and the mess he had to deal with. After I watched it a few more times, then saw the Assembly Cut, I actually really started to appreciate it."
LV426,3a0o35,mike_rotch22,3,Tue Jun 16 19:52:47 2015 UTC,"It's quite possibly my favorite one. I remember watching it when it came out as a teenager and saying 'holy shit, this movie is dark'. The atmosphere was bleak, and you had that sense of no hope up to the end."
LV426,3a0o35,WhatImMike,10,Tue Jun 16 17:38:48 2015 UTC,"They also filmed at Blythe Power Station. The North East of England has a history with the Alien franchise, and Ridley Scott grew up here. He based the opening hellscape of Blade Runner on the steelworks and industry around Teesside."
LV426,3a0o35,SickTriceratops,-1,Tue Jun 16 12:08:57 2015 UTC,Paul WTF Anderson is also from Newcastle and he clubbed the franchise to death and screwed the corpse as the final insult with AvP...  Ylou know which bits were Blyth?

I'm pretty sure it has to do with the pre-Lindelof script and was kept in to create some level of mysticism/possibly just shots for the trailer to tie the movie closer to being an Alien prequel. I'm pretty sure that's it; either its the best shoehorn to a prospective sequel (which wouldn't make sense bc Prometheus 2 is set in Paradise) or they kept it in for marketing/added mystery due to the film's pseudo-spiritually/scientific nature."

When human-, dog- (or bull-), or Newborn-based xenomorphs were generated in the films, despite their individual characteristic specific to the host species, they all had that same elongated skull in back. Even the Deacon had it (albeit a bit pointy).  Much like you would see a biohazard sign at a hospital, a nuclear radiation sign near a waste dump, or even a good old-fashioned skull-and-crossbones label on a old-timey bottle of poison, maybe this has a similar purpose or warning?  Just my two cents...maybe it's just a really weird sundial . : )"

LV426,3a0etx,BoardroomBimmy,-3,Fri Jun 19 07:52:13 2015 UTC,"I think the reason a lot of people didn't like it is because they didn't understand it. They didn't see an immediate connection with the events that took place on LV426 (because there wasn't one implemented in the film) . I believe this was done purposefully with the intention of making the story even more grandiose. Explaining everything just in one movie(Prometheus) is not only a very simple format of story telling, but its also predictable and thats what the audience expected. but didn't get it (And you know what happens when baby doesn't get his bottle). Instead, we got a new story line, one that indeed has relevance to the story but is disconnected enough to stand on its own, and in the future we ""will"" get the story we ALL want  to see. A lot of people just don't see the bigger picture of this film and thats ok. Big things have small beginnings my friend."

LV426,39kysb,neoteotihuacan,9,Fri Jun 12 13:31:50 2015 UTC,"This video assumes that the Alien evolved naturally, but Prometheus highly suggests that they may have been engineered.  We simply don't know, but it seems unfair to subtract a point for not evolving with their host as we do not know that they didn't.  We know that their origin is tied with the Engineers, who share our DNA and created us.  So the fact that the alien can use us as a host isn't far fetched at all, even if they weren't engineered and simply evolved with the space jockeys.  This video also makes the assumption that they incorporate the DNA of the host.  The ""dog alien"" could have simply been another form of the drone, perhaps something that is born to protect the queen.  The original director's cut footage has the dog alien birthed from an ox, which heavily implies that it does not take the form of the host.  It once again seems unfair to subtract a point based on a huge assumption."
LV426,39kysb,fantoman,2,Fri Jun 12 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"Well the video doesn't talk about it, but the Predalien that we saw in AvP 2 clearly took on the traits of the host species with the mandibles and dreadlock hair. But then perhaps many people don't consider those movies to be canon."

LV426,38snab,kielmaru,19,Sat Jun 6 13:49:13 2015 UTC,"There was a lot of talk about the opening scene when the movie first came out, and here's the theory I liked best:  The Engineers are some kind of god-race, who go around creating life or whatever they want to do. They do this with the black goo, that breaks down cells and reuses them to create new life.  The one that did it on Earth was a member of a breakaway cult- there was one ship, they dropped the dude off and then got the hell out of Dodge ASAP. His DNA is responsible for the jumpstart our planet got to create life, leading to humans. Every now and then the cult would return to check on things, hence the cave drawings. The cave drawings led to other military outposts like the one visited in the movie.  The fiasco at the military base was because the rebels used the black goo in some unintended way - it's been shown that it can create life, but apparently it can also create monstrosities. I think that's because the goo's effectiveness is relative to the user's intentions/morality, which is why it gets all twisted and messed up when humans use it (which also seems to follow with the religious themes of the movie)  Anyway, the rest of the Engineers see humanity as a mistake and abomination, hence the planned bombing of Earth, and that is why the one at the end got super pissed off and tried to kill everybody.   Also, on the ""prequel"" part of the movie. We got our first glimpse at the proto-alien at the end after it popped out of the Engineer, we have the Weyland corporation (first half of Weyland-Yutani from the Alien series), and here's the Space Jockey from Alien, which was the same layout as the ship's navigation room in Prometheus."
LV426,38snab,servantoffire,23,Sat Jun 6 16:13:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said except for the break-away cult rebels part. I'm under the impression it's part of what engineers do:   Find a planet.  Sacrifice one of their own to create anthropomorphic life-forms by using the black goo to dissolve their DNA in a water source where it recombines to jump-start evolution that lead to a life-form similar to them. Keep tabs on that life-form and study and occasionally visit them. If that life-form doesn't evolve in a satisfactory way to their standards destroy them by sending the xenomorph virus.   I think this is what Shaw thinks as well. She believes humanity was created purposefully by the engineers and they changed their mind for some reason. In Prometheus 2 she is going to their planet to find the answer to the question ""what did humanity do wrong to deserve their genocide.""  It's analogous to humanity creating ""life"" as androids which is basically the same thing only much more primitive. Weyland uses computer technology and engineering to make androids that look like humans while the Engineers use advanced biochemistry to create life that resembles them. Just as Weyland destroys prototypes that don't live up to expectation to replace with another generation so too do the Engineers wipe out unsatisfactory creations (in this case humanity).  Old man Weyland has the hubris to compare himself to the engineers and being proud of his accomplishments (""we are the same, we both create life"") but to the engineers he is nothing more than a badly made obnoxious android."
LV426,38snab,Arctorkovich,2,Sat Jun 6 17:14:46 2015 UTC,"I know that is the Engineer rationale (Humans killed Space Jesus so the Engineers are pissed) that Scott retconned in via interview.  However, my interpretation is that the Engineers' plan to bomb Earth with the ""Weaponized"" Black Goo was not a malevolent act.    This particular subset of Engineers seemed to be studying the effects of the WBG on biological organisms.  They probably started out with single celled organisms and then advanced on to more complex forms of life.  The ultimate goal might have been to see what the WBG's effect would be on a sentient species (Humans).  Eventually, one of their experimental subjects got lose or one of the Engineers was accidentally infected and shit went downhill fast.  The Sleeping Engineer was probably already in stasis before that point because why put someone into stasis in the midst of a containment breach if whatever caused the containment breach might get into the chamber and kill the person in stasis.  So he had no idea that the facility had gone to hell and was probably confused as to why someone other than his own people woke him up.  The Engineer had no beef with Humanity other than Weyland arrogantly asking for more life when he had already created the means to secure his own immortality (Androids).  He went on a killing spree of Weyland and the others because he assumed that is what they were all there for.  It probably didn't view the Prometheus' suicide run as an attempt to save their homeworld from getting dowsed but rather as revenge for not getting what they wanted (Immortality)."
LV426,38snab,Arctorkovich,2,Mon Jun 8 09:23:17 2015 UTC,Scott retconned in via interview   I haven't seen any such interviews. That was just my take-away from the movie.
LV426,38snab,alpacafox,5,Mon Jun 8 16:02:11 2015 UTC,"The official infographic about the goo implies that the effect of the goo depends on how it is consumed: inhalation or ingestion.  So there is no effect by morals or intentions imo.  Inhalation will lead to mutations and monsters (DNA recoding) and seems to be regionally restricted. So this can be used as a biological weapon. Ingestion will lead to DNA disintegration, which will pollute the hydrosphere, which leads to other organisms ingesting the goo, which in the end leads to a complete infection of a planet and a complete restart of life on that planet (which is exactly what happens at the beginning of the movie)  Stage 2 of the ingestion process lists sexual arousal, which is what leads to Holloway/Shaw having sex.  I would guess that this is a branch-off of the ingestion process, but it's not clear if this only applies to humans or all lifeforms."

LV426,38snab,get_logicated,2,Fri Jun 12 04:30:39 2015 UTC,I hate this idea that the Black Goo is a psychically attuned substance that reacts differently based on the intentions of the user.  Why can't the Black Goo shown at the beginning of the film and the Black Goo shown for the rest of the film be variations of the same substance.
LV426,38snab,nameless_gods,6,Mon Jun 8 09:03:48 2015 UTC,"How did the geologist and the biologist (?) got left behind? Werent they gonna go to the ship early in the first place? And why didnt they go back?   They probably just got lost.   Why would David poison the guy? And did he expect him to sleep with Shaw and was it part of his plan for Shaw to be pregnant?   He was probably acting under directives from Weyland.  We know they spoke from his sleeping pod.   Either way, it's probably safe to assume that prior to the mission he was given explicit instructions for a wide variety of situations and discoveries that they might encounter.   Where did they get the decapitated head? I dont remember seeing that in the movie or i missed it.   From the giant head room.   Why would the old weyland guy lie about being dead?   He was the head of a giant mega corporation who wanted to leave a legacy.  He faked his death, presumably got his affairs in order on earth and left on this highly secretive mission.  From the start, the mission was a 50/50.  Either he would come back to earth with the answers and enlightenment he was seeking from the engineers or he would simply die and never be heard from again but he would still have his legacy on earth.  If he had announced his plans to spend a trillion dollars, sleep in a freezer for a few years, so he could seek out humanities creators... Don't you think people probably would have called him a senile old fool?  People would have reacted the way that biologist did and his legacy would be in the toilet.   How exactly did those giant ass ripped dudes made life on earth anyway? (i think im gonna read into this later) What i dont get is why the last giant wanted to kill the humans... And where the hell is he going with the ship? Destroy earth? Why?   Everything I can gather from the movie suggests that the act of creation might be sacred to them.  They probably think themselves as gods and should be worshiped by their creations.  My belief is that they travel the galaxy ""seeding"" worlds to see what evolves under different circumstances.. The whole while, marveling in their own superiority and god-like creation capabilities.  At a certain level in a planets progression and evolution they simply start over with a blank canvas with that black goo.  What I believe happened was a few thousand years ago when humanity got to a point where they stopped worshiping them as gods, it was time to schedule a reboot aka drop some black goo off to start over.  In the process leaving for earth, some goo got loose and their mission was aborted hence the first hologram they see of the engineers running for their lives and then the one ended up getting his head severed in the door so they were never able to leave.   Then the engineer woke up and realized what had happened.  The ship never launched, their goo never made it to earth, and the people who no longer worshiped them advanced to a level where they could CREATE A.I. and seek out the ones who created them.  That's why he was pissed.  That's why he tossed all those fools around the bridge of his space ship.   Im still trying to connect this movie to the original Alien film. They say Prometheus is a prequel. And I dont think they focus enough on the alien.. and I dont see the connection of the Engineers and the Alien.. Like.. they were more focusing on the Engineer. Did the Engineers make the Alien?   Take my above comment into consideration and realize that it's as a chain of events/fuck-ups that spans thousands of years.  Their black goo which is made to alter or extinguish lower life forms than themselves was used on one of their own(engineers).  In a religious type context that would probably be looked at as sacrilege.  Anything that spawned from it would be an abomination.  So yes.. the engineers inadvertently created the Alien.   Where was Shaw going at the ending with her speech? And where did she get that ship? Didnt it already explode?   David reaches out to Shaw on the radio and says that the ship that blew up wasn't the only one and that he knew how to fly them and use their navigation.  Shaw wasn't going home.  She was going to search for the engineers homeworld.  She wants some god damn answers and the wants them now. - Prometheus 2"

LV426,38snab,nameless_gods,2,Fri Jun 12 15:52:52 2015 UTC,Thanks guy.  It bugs me that so many people write this movie off after seeing it once.  I guess a lot of movie goers just expect to have every explanation of every detail laid out on a platter.

I think that the film requires some thinking outside of what is considered traditional movie-going fare but not too much. The element of mystery in the film is wonderful and is complemented beautifully by the impressive set-design. I don't get the hatred for this film. Not to rant on and on, but I was watching the planet entry sequence in this film a few minutes ago and was blown away by the scale. Wonderful film."
LV426,38snab,K1i1,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:28:00 2015 UTC,"David poisoning Hollaway is indeed probably a command that plays on the orders Ash had and is evidenced by the conversations of him and frozen Weyland.  It also shows a some what malevolent character he is with child like emotions wishing deadly revenge on the robophobic Holloway. The first 20 minutes with David developing and playfully changingbhis hair style is a red herring. He is not Bishop but Ash. Cruel, following orders and a company man through and through.  By the end it is ambiguous if he has developed better emotions or is he still as calculating and as on mission even though his puppet master is now dead. Did he even enjoy thevpower of life and death and lure Weyland to finish him off and free himself?"
LV426,38snab,AestheticJellyfish,31,Sat Jun 6 22:57:38 2015 UTC,"I think everyone was asking the same questions as you. I'll do my best to answer some of them:   ""How did the geologist and the biologist (?) got left behind? Werent they gonna go to the ship early in the first place? And why didnt they go back?"" Yes they did go back early- but somehow the guy who mapped the whole place himself couldn't either use the maps or retrace his steps, so they got lost. Don't ask me how. ""Why would David poison the guy? And did he expect him to sleep with Shaw and was it part of his plan for Shaw to be pregnant?"" He wanted to test the effects of the black oil, and since it's Weyland, they apparently have a quota policy on how many of their robots turn coldly, Britishly evil and decide to test their findings on the crew. As for expecting Shaw's little bundle of writhing tentacled joy, that's anybody's guess. David seemed smug enough about how it ended up, but he could just be taking credit for results that were blind luck. ""Where did they get the decapitated head? I dont remember seeing that in the movie or i missed it"" This is the first question where I probably couldn't just answer with 'I don't know, this film is not well written.' There was a big door leading into the black oil chamber with a corpse outside. It was one of the engineers who had fallen and been decapitated by the door. The scientists gathered up the loose head and brought it back. As for reanimating it and making it explode... I don't know. ""Why would the old weyland guy lie about being dead?"" ...I don't know. ""How exactly did those giant ass ripped dudes made life on earth anyway? (i think im gonna read into this later) What i dont get is why the last giant wanted to kill the humans... And where the hell is he going with the ship? Destroy earth? Why?"" They're referred to as Engineers, but I'm going to take what you called them and call them GARDs from now on, because that is indisputably better. At the beginning with the waterfall, that one GARD left behind drinks some black oil, and it breaks his body down into little cells etc, which mix into the waterfall, proliferating through the ecosystem and introducing GARD DNA into our planet's... yeah, something. This is getting progressively more frustrating since I'm mentally recapping all these nonsensical scenes in my head. Why the remaining GARD wanted to kill us... we were a mistake? The ship he was flying was full of the wildly inconsistent black oil, which when at one stage creates the beginning of human life on earth, now creates womb squids and zombies and will be a plague, I suppose, when released on Earth? The black oil is basically a massive, unexplained macguffin. ""Im still trying to connect this movie to the original Alien film. They say Prometheus is a prequel. And I dont think they focus enough on the alien.. and I dont see the connection of the Engineers and the Alien.. Like.. they were more focusing on the Engineer. Did the Engineers make the Alien?"" Originally, they stated that it was a story set in the same universe as the Alien films, but much earlier. They intended it to be its own story about the origins of life and creation but with 'Alien DNA' woven into the story. But then they had that mid  credits scene with the creature that looked like the Alien, and all the life cycle stuff, and the statue of the queen in the cave, so... I don't bloody know. The Engineers seem to have made the Alien alright, but who knows? Black Goo's gonna do what Black Goo's gonna do. ""Where was Shaw going at the ending with her speech? And where did she get that ship? Didnt it already explode?"" There were other ships in the facility that didn't explode, which David helped her find, despite his head being bounced around inside a massive chamber on a ship that exploded and crashed. Come to think of it, his head appeared to be in the exact place where the GARD had dropped it before the ship even took off. Nevermind. Anyway, I think she was going to follow coordinates to another planet where the GARDs had been to try to question them about why they made us and then tried to kill us. Hopefully, she'll find the answers to some of the questions you asked as well, because I'm woefully underequipped to try to make sense of this mess.   Still, it looked gorgeous and Fassbender was great as David, I'll give it that much."

LV426,38snab,anotherDocObVious,6,Sun Jun 7 22:21:27 2015 UTC,"My theory is the geologist/biologist team got lost as their mapping devices malfunctioned intentionally. They were being used as live bait.  There is evidence there were artefact urns left on Earth. These were studied by Weyland corp, and Peter Weyland believed what was in these urns could create some form of immortality. He wanted to live forever, whatever the costs.  The decapacitated head was in a Jockey helmet. They opened the helmet after finding it inside the urn chamber.  Weyland was dying at the start of the movie. They decided to freeze him because at least then he has a chance. The same idea is entertained by people opting for cryonic suspension today.  A few speculations http://khannea-suntzu.zerostate.net/?p=3380  The Xenomorph is most certainly a biological weapon. It effectively sterilizes planets.   There were several pyramids.

LV426,38snab,ManofManyTalentz,4,Sat Jun 6 20:15:50 2015 UTC,Only saw the movie once at the cinema so my memory is quite hazy but so much of it's plot points and character actions make no sense. A few of your points there were widely criticised and discussed when the movie came out so might be worth searching for older threads from then.   In my mind I like to keep it separate from the Aliens movies even if it is considered cannon.  It does a complete disservice to the mythology of the Xenos and Space Jockey.
LV426,38snab,Musingmike,2,Sat Jun 6 15:02:27 2015 UTC,"The geologist and biologist were clearly agitated and upset and so they took a wrong turn on their way back out.  David poisoned Holloway after Weyland told him to try harder to find answers as to what was there are this place. He was trying to push the envelope to see what they were dealing with at the site.  Weyland might have lied about being dead because he did not want to reveal the true purpose of the journey to those involved, perhaps so they did not get a chance to speak to the engineers before he did.  Shaw also wants to know why they wanted to destroy humanity, perhaps she will find out why in the sequel. Clearly the engineers were upset with or disappointed in their creation.  The engineers made th black too and the black goo makes xenomorphs, they made the aliens and then began to worship them as the perfect life form.  There were other ships, not just the one, Shaw was going to the engineers' home world."
LV426,38snab,ManofManyTalentz,2,Sat Jun 6 17:20:08 2015 UTC,"A: because this movie makes no sense. Seriously, apart from the art direction the whole thing was a gigantic mess that most fans just ignore. We have high hopes for the aliens sequel in the works though"
LV426,38snab,rbrumble,2,Sat Jun 6 23:25:58 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree with that. I think it was pretty clear and people shouldn't have to have everything baby birded to them. However, I think a major issue a lot of people have is that it didn't fully connect everything in one film, but anyone should know these days that everything is left a little open in order to make more films because original thought is basically extinct at this point in the entertainment industry."
LV426,38snab,Musingmike,2,Mon Jun 8 15:43:59 2015 UTC,"everything is left a little open    There's a difference between ""a little open"" and ""nonsensical"". Prometheus was the second of these. I'm also a fan of not having everything explained, but again, this movie went into ""nothing explained"" to the point where it seriously affected the cohesion of.....well, everything.  A beautifully art-directed, terrible mess of a movie."
LV426,38snab,miggitymikeb,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"The reasoning given as to why the engineers wanted to destroy life on Earth was because humans were deemed too violent to be released on the universe.    There's a couple clues in the film.  There's a timeline given to the outpost somewhere in Prometheus.  It's said to be 2000 years old.    The inference is the Engineers were wiping us out because we killed Jesus - who was either an Engineer or a human/Engineer hybrid or something else they highly valued.  Sounds weird, but there's a butt load of support for this theory online."

I did a quick search on eBay and found one (and they even advertise it as being a Sigourney Weaver Alien Watch, which is funny) but they want $210 for it.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/1977-Casio-52-F-100-Chronograph-Vintage-Digital-Sigourney-Weaver-Alien-Watch-/251981771299?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3aab48b223  The funny thing is that until I found that publicity photo of her that I posted I am not sure I even noticed that watch until now (or at least hadn't thought about it since the late 70's early 80's) and I am a huge and longtime Alien fan going back to 1979 when I saw it in the theater and countless times on video since then."

I'm sure there was a period when synthetics were under development and I wouldn't be surprised to see robots used in hazardous environments or older synthetics used in poor colonies.

LV426,38m066,GriffinTB,2,Tue Jun 9 02:04:11 2015 UTC,"Alien (franchise):       The Alien film franchise (known as Aliens in most media) is a science fiction horror film series consisting of four installments, focusing on Warrant Officer Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her battles with an extraterrestrial lifeform, commonly referred to as ""the Alien"". Produced by 20th Century Fox, the series started with Alien (1979), which led to three film sequels, as well as numerous books, comics and video game spin-offs.  Related to the franchise is the two part Alien vs. Predator series which combines the Aliens with the Predators from the Predator film series. Prometheus, an indirect prequel to Alien released in 2012, is also related.  On February 18, 2015, director Neil Blomkamp revealed he was officially working on a fifth Alien film, with Weaver soon confirmed to reprise her role.

I don't feel it was the kinda game that gave me time to explore.  It gave me enough time to do what I needed to do and get the fuck out.  My advise is to stop living on the motion tracker.  I was on playing on the Hard setting and once I got out of medical, that took me about a week of trial and error, I had a buddy tell me his theory was to lay off the motion tracker unless the Alien was 'on screen'.  Armed with this advise I was able to make progress in the game and also spend most of it crippled by fear.  Still one of the best games I have played.  ONLY game from the 'scare the shit out of you' genre that I have ever finished, unless you count RE2.    Other than that, I'd say you can be fairly liberal with all of the stuff you make.  I didn't really run out of anything for too long.  I did hoard mats for the first half of the game and ended with all kinds of stuff I never used.  Dig deep, take a Xanax and keep pushing."
LV426,387gdz,FishtanksG,3,Tue Jun 2 12:01:53 2015 UTC,"That sounds fantastic! I should have added in my original post, that I also only play the game past midnight, in a pitch black room with surround sound headphones and the game difficulty on Hard. I think I have trouble like you said almost always having the motion tracker out, and I heard that it will also attract the Alien if he is close and hears it.  I've thought about trying the game on normal or easy difficulty, but I feel like I would just be cutting myself and the developers short of their original vision. Also like you said, I was terrible about hoarding materials! I would barely ever use my flashlight as I was always scared of running out of battery and such, although I should have learned my lesson from all of my single player RPGs where I have way too many potions and money at the end of them.  I think I might try your advice, take some benzos, and then give it another try. I've found that when I smoke though, I get even MORE into the game. I believe this happens because my brain can only really focus on one thing, and that turns into just hiding in the vents with the flamethrower out quivering because the Xeno has made me his little bitch."
LV426,387gdz,Dcornelissen,4,Tue Jun 2 12:29:26 2015 UTC,Haha.  After the I got the flamethrower I never used the flash light.  I would just run off the small amount of light put out of the FT.

LV426,385tk4,wtfisajesus,25,Tue Jun 2 01:40:24 2015 UTC,"this has been a debated topic among both fans and creators. really it just depends on your preference.   in the original alien, the alien was supposed to be smart. like, higher than human levels of smart. however as said in the movie its mind is unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality. so while its very intelligent, its also a killing machine. problem is this was never really shown on screen even if it was the intention, so it was up to interpretation.   this changed when the second film came around. james Cameron really wanted to put his stamp on the franchise, and he filled in the blanks that the first film never answered.   the queen and hive like social structure of the aliens was Cameron's invention. (the alien was always meant to be insect like, however the hive mentality was Cameron's addition) under this idea the regular aliens, while still relatively smart i am sure, seem to be pretty mindless and just follow orders from the queen, who is the only really intelligent one.  some fan theories try to say that both can be true, when part of a hive a xenomorph will give up its individuality and higher intelligence to the hive and acting only as a body to be ordered. however when a regular alien finds itself alone without any hive, it will need to use its intelligence in order to start a new hive.   really it just depends on what you want them to be when you view the movie. the aliens are supposed to be mysterious, we don't really know everything about them, so their intelligence could still be up to the viewers interpretation."

LV426,385tk4,RoadBuster,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:55:50 2015 UTC,"(Ignoring Alien 3 and predalien nonsense)   I think you're right on. The Queen is sort of given control of the hive group, but alone they are still built to survive at all costs. The ability to have a psychic link would require quite a bit of brain power. I would even go as far as to argue that the Aliens ability to incorporate the host DNA might have given them some basic understanding of human mechanisms or a boost to intelligence- basically for the sole purpose of surviving in the environment it was born in and to kill human hosts most efficiently. This is how they cut the power, how they navigate the facility so easily and intelligently, and how these pesky things always seem to get in places they're not wanted (and stow themselves on every damn ship in the series).  Now the question becomes how much does the Alien borrow from its host? Is this how the Queen figures out the elevator door mechanism so quickly? Or is this how the Alien in the first movie was able to take out the whole crew and be aware that the self destruct mechanism meant danger was coming. To immediately adapt to a foreign environment and hunt within a matter of hours/days requires a pretty high degree of intelligence, albeit focused solely on hunting prey it is genetically built ad-hoc to hunt.  I like to think that the xenomorphs borrow more from their hosts than we've seen, only because we have been limited to the hollywood (and purposely familiar) models. We'll never know how the Alien 3 xenomorph truly compared to the human host form. I think having the alien be born from an animal and not changing the appearance of its head was purely an aesthetic choice and not in the spirit of the true xenomorph biology and the first two films.  I'm not saying I want to see a xenomorph zoo like the old figures- the bull xeno, the praying mantis xeno (although that one was pretty cool), etc., but my theory is that the Xeno borrows what it needs from the host in order for it to kill or capture similar hosts. Therefore, it will inherent the instincts, basic knowledge or genetic memory, and evolutionary adaptions (two legs, two arms) of its host so that way when the adult xeno is born, it skips millions of years of adaptaton and is already at the point where it can hunt and be successful in the home environment of its prey.  Anyone have any good examples from books, comics, or movies that support or contradict what I'm saying?"

LV426,385tk4,Kurauk,6,Fri Jun 5 19:35:53 2015 UTC,"/u/mrcarkeys42 pretty much nailed what I was going to say. When a xeno is out solo without a hive, it can act on its own in a very intelligent way with the purpose of survival so that it may start a new hive (a theory supporting this is the cocooned Dallas in the Director's Cut of Alien.)  In Aliens, the Xenos are a bit more reckless, as you see them flailing themselves towards the auto sentry turrets and get slaughtered in a few scenes. Don't forget though, they're animals... HOW CAN THEY CUT THE POWER?!?!?  Either way, a lot of it is up to interpretation, and I do believe myself that if you had to I suppose ""rank"" their intelligence, I would say they are very intuitive.  WOW ALMOST FORGOT! - At the very end of Alien, R. Scott's original ending was that while aboard the Narcissus in the final scene, the Xeno gets the better of Ripley, killing her, and then putting an entry into her voice log using Sigourney Weaver's voice! I really can't elaborate on that more, but I remember reading that it was maybe planning on taking the escape shuttle back to Earth? Either way, the execs at Fox weren't too happy with such a dark ending, and made it so that Ripley would survive. I included this part because I believe in the R. Scott's original vision, the Xenos were indeed smarter than humans, able to navigate a spaceship, make it to the emergency escape shuttle, start the makings of an early hive, and in the supposed original ending able to manipulate human devices."

Rather, art inspired by his art.   [Shoe from a different angle: 1 / 2  These pumps are based on an Alexander McQueen design very clearly inspired by Giger's Xenomorph. They debuted at Plato's Atlantis, McQueen's 2009 fashion show but sadly were never actually put into production (SURPRISING, right?). Probably because they look equal parts terrifying to behold and impossible to walk in. (You might also remember the shoes from Lady Gaga's Bad Romance music video if you watched it as obsessively as I did.)  In a nutshell, I bought some pumps and added on things sculpted out of craft foam and polymer clay, covered those pieces with heat-molded worbla, primed with gesso, painted with iridescent acrylic and sealed with polyurethane spray.  Just wanted to share!"

Is that surface roughness a result of the design or creation process or just an artifact of the image? Honestly they are a awesome design but the way the texture appears makes me think they would hurt along every edge meeting your foot. A slightly glossier surface might do well to temper that impression. Otherwise superb job in capturing Giger's style.

Watch Alien for the artistic horror, Aliens for the action and world-building, and Alien3 for the mood.  Resurrection, though?  THAT campy affront to the franchise can be skipped.

The first is at the approach to the pressure door; the second is an assault on an alternative route, probably easier access. Both scenes are in the directors cut, but not the theatrical cut.

LV426,37mfwu,yatpay,1 point,Fri May 29 10:30:36 2015 UTC,"are you sure there are none of the gun scenes in the theatrical version? i could have sworn that the first scene (where the ammo counters go all the way down and we here the aliens banging at the pressure door) was cut and is added back in the directors cut, but the second scene (where the ammo counters almost go down but then stop, and its a good thing because that's the hallway with the barricade they could have broken through) was in both the theatrical and the directors cut. its been a long time since i saw the theatrical, so i could be wrong, but i swore thats the way it was."
LV426,37mfwu,OlafTheSpaceViking,1 point,Fri May 29 19:21:48 2015 UTC,"Positive. I remember seeing ALIENS at the theatre, and when I read the novelisation I read about the automatic sentry scenes and wished they had been in there. I didn't even know they'd actually filmed those scenes until I saw the director's cut in the 90's."
LV426,37mfwu,nibcrom,1 point,Sat May 30 01:24:19 2015 UTC,I am absolutely positive there were no sentry guns in the original theatrical version as I saw in the theater when it came out a few times. I remember being excited when the directors cut came out on Laserdisc to see the sentry gun scenes as well as the other scenes.
LV426,37mfwu,pelicanIncident,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:32:44 2015 UTC,"For Aliens I usually go with my own cut, which is the Director's cut but skipping the two DVD chapters immediately after the inquest. This brings in some crucial scenes that explains Ripley's motivation while keeping the mystery alive later on."
LV426,37mfwu,notHooptieJ,2,Fri May 29 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"Same, actually."
LV426,37mfwu,GloriousHam,25,Fri May 29 16:49:40 2015 UTC,"Watch the theatrical cut.  ""Scott noted that he was very pleased with the original theatrical cut of Alien, saying that ""For all intents and purposes, I felt that the original cut of Alien was perfect. I still feel that way"", and that the original 1979 theatrical version ""remains my version of choice"".[89]"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28film%29#Home_video  In this case, the term director's cut was more of a marketing term than a reflection of him being unsatisfied with the original cut. The director's cut is more of an alternate cut than anything else. Interesting in it's own way but not superior."
LV426,37mfwu,itza_me,2,Thu May 28 18:47:26 2015 UTC,Enjoy the ride. They don't make movies like that one anymore.
LV426,37mfwu,GloriousHam,7,Thu May 28 23:47:59 2015 UTC,"the ""directors cut"" of alien kind of muddies canon with the whole re-added ""implanted Dallas"" scene, otherwise its not any ""better"" than the theatrical cut, just slightly different pacing.  i'd watch the theatrical release of Alien,  then the Directors cut of Aliens,   then the ASSEMBLY cut of Alien3   (this one so radically changes the film i cant even suggest watching the theatrical release EVER, closes almost all the plotholes, and even gives another sequel possibility that wasnt explored in the theatrical. literally takes it from the ""worst"" to competing with the original)"
LV426,37mfwu,itza_me,2,Thu May 28 20:45:40 2015 UTC,Where can one find the Assembly Cut?
LV426,37mfwu,GloriousHam,2,Fri May 29 00:28:58 2015 UTC,"The Alien Anthology box set has it.  The making of documentary is good too, more honest than I expected."
LV426,37mfwu,bluefuzzyoctopus,1 point,Fri May 29 11:46:49 2015 UTC,"Well shit, I have the Anthology on Blu-Ray. I have never noticed that there was an alternate cut for Alien 3. Awesome news!"
LV426,37mfwu,notHooptieJ,1 point,Fri May 29 11:49:32 2015 UTC,"I could be mistaken, but I think it gives you the option of the theatrical or assembly cut when you put the disc in :p"

LV426,37mfwu,zgh5002,1 point,Fri May 29 12:16:43 2015 UTC,"What's the assembly cut, and how does it differ from director's cut on 3?"
LV426,37mfwu,gosassin,3,Fri May 29 00:40:50 2015 UTC,"the ""assembly cut"" has a bunch of unfinished SFX, and bad sound in some of the ""recovered"" footage.  its the second version of alien3  included with the Trilogy Box set - the first 2 are ""directors cuts"" alien 3 is the ""assembly cut"", most people refer to it as the ""directors cut""- BUT.  but since the director wouldnt have anything to do with it after the way it was butchered for the theatrical release, the crew assembled the best approximation of what was there before the studio editors gutted it, hence the ""assembly cut"" not the directors cut.  its quite a bit longer, the pacing is a lot better, the whole toxic waste containment was explained and used- the plot flows, the characters are actually developed, its a downright crime ""what was made"" vs ""what got released"".  with actually using that cut it wouldve gotten a wholly different critic response at the theaters."
LV426,37mfwu,Tyranniac,2,Fri May 29 01:02:50 2015 UTC,"ahh, so there is no ""director's cut"" of 3? I have the quadrilogy that has a couple versions of everything. :P And i definitely prefer the non-theatrical cut of 3."
LV426,37mfwu,LibertyIsNotFree,2,Fri May 29 01:27:05 2015 UTC,Nope. Fincher doesn't even acknowledge the films existence.
LV426,37mfwu,Tyranniac,3,Fri May 29 06:15:31 2015 UTC,Try to get it on bluray if at all possible. They look sooooo good.
LV426,37mfwu,clwestbr,4,Fri May 29 12:00:27 2015 UTC,What the hell? I'm the only one that prefers the Director's Cut?
LV426,37mfwu,chumblespuz3000,2,Fri May 29 01:26:56 2015 UTC,"Nope. I do too, and usually get downvoted for it.  I saw Aliens first, never liked Alien until watching the Director's cut. The hive scene that is generally paned here is what changed my view, it created a continuity across the whole quadrilogy."

LV426,37hqk6,Beeslo,18,Wed May 27 18:50:16 2015 UTC,This must be the first action figure made of Bolaji Badejo.
LV426,37hqk6,nibcrom,7,Wed May 27 19:25:03 2015 UTC,"This has got to be the weirdest and funniest bootleg I've ever seen.   because he dared to dream, and never stopped believing.    What the fuck has that got to do with anything?  And why is the picture of Bolaji Badejo in the suit with the mask off, if the figure is a (presumably) human body with the Alien's head? Does the head come off?  This is so odd. I don't personally collect action figures, but I'd totally get this just because of how weird it is.  Also, it'd go great with the ""USCS Nostromo"" (missing the last S on USCSS) shirt I bought. At Comiccon. That has a proper copywright notice on it. I didn't notice the missing S until I got home."

LV426,37hqk6,BoothaFett,2,Thu May 28 02:19:25 2015 UTC,Is this a Glorp product as it has enough coherence and absurdity to match the Star Warsiors figures.

LV426,37hqk6,Tyranniac,1 point,Thu May 28 13:56:47 2015 UTC,So the figure has a man body and alien head but the picture has an alien body and man head. WTF
LV426,37hqk6,kingeryck,3,Thu May 28 04:15:12 2015 UTC,When you dare to dream and never stop believing anything is possible.  Even if it doesn't make any sense.
