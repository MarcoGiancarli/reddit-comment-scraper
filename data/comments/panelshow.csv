panelshow,3dw055,ThumbtacksArePointy,11,Mon Jul 20 03:06:34 2015 UTC,WILTY is not the first show to make people try and guess a true story.
panelshow,3dw055,pacdude,0,Mon Jul 20 00:30:11 2015 UTC,"Which show like this came before it? Each of the truth/lie games have a distinct format, like TTTT with three people claiming the same name and identity and the panel deciding who's the real Tina Fey or whomever. I thought the ""famous people read a card about themselves and take open-ended questions from the others who vote truth or lie"" was a uniquely WILTY format."
panelshow,3dw055,Amarsir,8,Mon Jul 20 00:42:47 2015 UTC,"Ever play ""two truths and a lie?"" WILTY is a lot like playing Two Truths and a Lie. Parlor games, the lot of them."
panelshow,3dw055,centech,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:56 2015 UTC,"All the truth/lie shows have similarities and distinctions, I think. Two Truths and a Lie has someone sit quietly and not take questions while the others choose which of the three claims are real/fake. That's a lot more like the Meet the Makers opening round of Virtually Famous, where a contestant sits silently and doesn't take questions while the others choose which of the three videos are the real/fake ones created by the contestant. I just think that, given that The Tonight Show has mined US and Japanese shows for their games, they've probably looked at British shows, too."
panelshow,3dw055,Electricjohn,3,Mon Jul 20 03:04:29 2015 UTC,"I can certainly see the similarity.  Probably a coincidence.  We'll see what happens with the To Tell the Truth revival. Traditionally that sort of show doesn't get better than mid-day filler in the US. And I don't know why, but it's probably because the show doesn't work without high-caliber comics like David and Lee, and anyone with that talent in the States either can do better elsewhere or the network doesn't want to pay enough for the idea.  (It would also be a problem that US shows like long runs and WILTY is inherently using up material as it goes.)"

panelshow,3doimq,Cannington,19,Sat Jul 18 04:29:01 2015 UTC,"It's always a minefield for Americans on Brit shows. I always cringe when an American is on one of these shows. Amy is great and funny and I love her to bits but on American shows you come on, show your clip, talk about how great it was to work on this project you're promoting, tell a funny anecdote that you've repeated on every one else's show and then you go home.  Adam Hills doesn't let anyone do that. Neither does Graham Norton for that matter. Both shows are conversations about whatever and are often far more revealing about who this person actually is. In the US, they just need to have that safe anecdote ready and unlikely to alienate anyone that might see their film.  Most Brit celebs that come on these shows are just dropping by cause they were home when the booker called to see if they were available. If an American is on one of these shows it's because they're on a huge promotional tour for which they're contractually obligated to not piss anyone off by having an opinion."

panelshow,3cur89,duck867,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:58:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I think it's weird, too, but I'm just going off of what Channel 4 is saying.    Here is the clip posted from the 3 July 2015 episode, which is labeled as s8e1. And here is the direct link to the on demand content for that same episode. Notice in the URL that the last numbers are ""001"". This is because those numbers represent the episode number for the series. Contrast this with the episode right before it (labeled with a ""006"" implying s7e6) and the episode right after it (labeled with a ""002"" implying s8e2)   I'm not saying that this is the best numbering scheme (or even reasonable on Channel 4's part), just that this is the episode scheme they're using.  I suppose there's the chance that somebody in IT just screwed up the numbering system, in which case I'll totally back down on this. I'm just presenting the facts I see."

Explicit sexual acts are allowed to a degree after 10 pm. It's not that common, though, as there are advertiser considerations, the potential for controversy and negative reputation for the network as sleazy, etc. There used to be more of it on Channel 4. I remember ""documentaries"" about penis enlargement and other excuses to show genitals on TV.  It's also legally allowed on US broadcast TV by the FCC after the 10 pm ""safe harbor,"" as well as anywhere on cable, but the networks' own ""standards and practices"" prevent it because they don't want to risk losing advertisers in any sort of controversy."

panelshow,3cmsrs,canausernamebetoolon,10,Thu Jul 9 12:52:34 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how you count the first few episodes, which were considered specials at the time, but now could be considered the first and second series. (There were also less-successful mashups of other Channel 4 shows.)  There was a single episode in January 2012. There was another single episode in August 2012. There were two episodes in April 2013. Then the first real series started from July to September 2013.  According to Channel 4, this is Series 7, which means those specials are now considered two series. I would go with that."
panelshow,3cmsrs,blekkja,4,Thu Jul 9 05:37:02 2015 UTC,"I'm with you in that normally I would side with Channel 4, but they have a weird numbering scheme for the current episodes. For example:   The most recent episode on 3 July 2015 (where Rachel and Susie joined the teams), is apparently considered s8e1, and is the 39th episode.  If you count the two very first specials, that's 41 episodes, which means potentially that they aren't even considered part of the absolute episode number... which would mean that somewhere we have an extra season unaccounted for. The episode from 3 May 2015 (with Nina Conti in Dictionary Corner) is apparently listed as s6e7, although it aired three months after s6e6 and 1.5 weeks before the next episode. (I'm referring to the wikipedia page here, for reference).   So with that in mind, should we still go with what's currently listed as the Wikipedia entry?

For fuck's sake.
panelshow,3cmsrs,Isit1981,6,Thu Jul 9 06:22:36 2015 UTC,"Here's how I see it.  (DISCLAIMER: This is off of research I did back in September 2014.)  I got upset on the fact that it seemed like every site had a different numbering scheme for 8oo10cdc. So I decided to try to find an official episode numbering scheme and update the Wikipedia page with it, hoping other sites would finally use the same numbering scheme. (Spoiler alert: They don't.)  After looking at Wikipedia, the British Comedy Guide, and Channel 4's website, I came to the conclusion that, since C4 is the closest to 8oo10cdc, therefore they must be the most accurate. I also noticed that for some reason, C4 only lists the series and episode numbers on video clips from the episode. I ended up using The Wayback Machine to start filling in the gaps.  There was one huge inconsistancy. C4 never listed the first special anywhere on the 8oo10cdc page. Not on the clips page, episode guide, or on 4od (and they still don't to this day). I came to the conclusion that the first ""special"" is actually considered to be an episode of ""The Channel 4 Mash Up"", and the second special is the actual first episode.  Finally, to answer some of your questions/concerns:   What is the current season of '8 out of 10 cats does countdown'?   We won't know until C4 posts another clip of an episode. However, it seems safe to assume we are still in series 7.   Could we, as a dedicated community, determine what we agree should be the official series/episode numbers?   I really hope so.   The most recent episode on 3 July 2015 (where Rachel and Susie joined the teams), is apparently considered s8e1...   By channel4.com? I'd like to see a source if you have it.   ...and is the 39th episode   ...that is available on 4od. The first episode (second ""special"") is not on 4od for whatever reason.   If you count the two very first specials...   Not the first one :)   that's 41 episodes, which means potentially that they aren't even considered part of the absolute episode number... which would mean that somewhere we have an extra season unaccounted for   40 episodes (technically), which means that all series/seasons are accounted for with the exception of the most recent episode being series 7/8.   The episode from 3 May 2015 (with Nina Conti in Dictionary Corner) is apparently listed as s6e7, although it aired three months after s6e6 and 1.5 weeks before the next episode.   C4 lists the episode with Kathy Burke as s07e01. Therefore, it can be assumed that that episode was still part of series 6.   So with that in mind, should we still go with what's currently listed as the Wikipedia entry? Or should that be changed to reflect the weird episode scheme by Channel 4?   I laughed at this at first because they were the same. I made them the same, and I checked in periodically to make sure no one reverted my edit. However not periodically enough. I see someone has decided to add a series 8 box even though there is no evidence for it. IMHO this should be corrected back to series 7 until C4 says otherwise.  And while I'm on my soapbox: I really miss Joe Wilkinson. I don't miss Jimmy introducing him as, ""He dosen't work here anymore, but he keeps turning up."""

C4 labels the Kathy Burke episode clip from 15 May 2015 as s7e1. Therefore I think the 3 May 2015 episode with Sarah Millican and Nina Conti should be officially considered s6e8. Notice similarly that the 3 July episode here is labeled as s8e1.    Why am I telling you this? Because you said you edited the Wikipedia page, and I think you and I are the ones currently editing the page :) So I wanted to see if you agreed with my deduction.

To be fair, there is little to discuss, but I feel like I've tried starting discussions on basically everything at some point or another. Articles mentioned in the show, relevant news about the panelists, stuff about the guests, etc. It's just hard to discuss the show.   Besides, there is a guy who runs a website about Wait Wait that has some really in depth analysis of running point totals and winners that includes most of the information mentioned in the show. It really does make a sub about it pretty useless if there isn't going to be a lot of discussion."

It really made me like the guy, so many ""popstars"" come on that show and it seems like they didn't know what they were in for and they get all sulky and miserable (especially when Simon was hosting), but Anthony seemed to be rather enjoying it. Kate Nash came across like a bit of a  twat but Anthony seems like a pretty fun guy."

He came in there knowing he would take a beating and looked like he had fun with it. IIRC, Simon had done a lot trashtalking of Blue long before that show, so Anthony knew what he was getting into."

panelshow,3c1lbd,Lhyzz,10,Sat Jul 4 10:57:59 2015 UTC,He has an autocue - he uses it for the monologue at the top. He uses cards at the desk because he pretending he is reading mundane introductory information about the contestants. It would feel weird if he directed those jokes at the camera or directly to the people he was joking about.
panelshow,3c1lbd,Isit1981,2,Sun Jul 5 08:00:20 2015 UTC,"He introduced the guests straight to camera in the Rematch episode.  When Jimmy reads the guest introductions from his cards, he usually faces the guest/ looks up at them afterwards as an opportunity for a reply – I guess it doesn't work as well if you're facing the camera. Just my thought."
panelshow,3c1lbd,doceezy,-1,Mon Jul 6 20:50:27 2015 UTC,Not sure why this got downvoted. Someone must enjoy watching a guy look down at a card and reading instead of making eye contact with the person he's speaking to or audience or camera...
panelshow,3c1lbd,slayer1138,6,Sat Jul 4 14:36:01 2015 UTC,"to be honest - yes, I actually enjoy his delivery, card-reading included. for some reason it gives it a different feel which is still very funny to me, and actually perfect for his delivery. almost as if he's just the messenger for the zingers he brings out against the panelists, and he's just reading off truths :P"
panelshow,3c1lbd,doceezy,-1,Sun Jul 5 07:37:45 2015 UTC,"Oh don't get me wrong i don't care if he reads from cards it just looks awkward to me when at the end of the sentence he is still staring at the card rather then reading a few words ahead and looking up towards the end.  It's like doing an oral presentation back at school and reading from palm notes but not actually looking up at the intended audience at the end.  Just looks a bit unprofessional to me but to each his own, i am a Jimmy Carr fan."

panelshow,3bj1tw,Electricjohn,2,Wed Jul 1 11:30:17 2015 UTC,"A Big Thanks. Years ago I was a fan of The Goon Show, I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again and Monty Python. Because in the past, in America it was hard to get anything from England, I lost touch with British humor. I rediscovered it via QI (I've seen every episode at least 3 times) and reddit. I've now watched every back episode of every panel show that I have been able to find. I was Jonesing for more. I'm going to spread the viewing of these out over several days. The real downside of all this is that it has made it almost impossible for me to watch American television again. Thanks again and keep up the good postings."
panelshow,3bj1tw,Electricjohn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:31:05 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the thanks! I adore the British humour, and how instrumental it seems to be within British society. Granted, I may be wrong about that assumption, given how much time I spend here on r/panelshow.  Like yourself, I'm not a Brit, but Canadian, and just can't enough of this style of programming!"
panelshow,3bj1tw,Blacknarcissa,2,Tue Jun 30 07:49:41 2015 UTC,"I just finished watching these episodes. I love this stuff. Where can I find more? I believe that you are right about humor in Britain being endemic. Americans tend to think of British humor as being too dry. They have never seen UK Panto. I love word play and sarcasm which British panel and quiz shows are saturated with. That intelligent humor on TV just does not exist in America.  The Green Room with Paul Provenza was a wonderful exception but I've only found 11 episodes online. Aside from most of the individuals being well educated and intelligent what really strikes me about British TV is not that it is non racist but that the whole subject of race doesn't seem to even be an issue. How refreshing. In the US, race is always the elephant in the room. Yikes, I currently live in Phoenix, Arizona which is nationally famous for profiling minorities. Not only race but shows like The Last Leg would unfortunately be impossible here. After living on British TV and radio for 3 years, it is with a sense of pride that I can say I now get over 90% of the jokes on any Big Fat Quiz Of The Year. If you have Netflix and subscribe to a service like Tunnel Bear, which for $5/month makes your computer appear to be in whatever country you choose, select Britain or Ireland and over half of your selections change to British shows unavailable in the US or Canada. Unfortunately I have been unable to locate many back episodes of the excellent quiz shows from Radio4. In the past I have avoided using torrents for security reasons but after seeing HansHubert's post about complete Seasons, I may have to try it."

panelshow,3b4iop,fuzzyjedi,4,Thu Jun 25 23:03:47 2015 UTC,Yep. His prepared material is very well crafted (the stand up/jokes bits) and he creates a good dynamic in any panel show by being the Paul Merton kind of guy in more free range sections (I think that's why people didn't like his appearance on Have I got News for you).

They are recording a new series at the moment and Limmy is going to be an upcoming guest, which will be amazing. If you've not heard Richard Herring before (Stewart Lee's erstwhile comedy partner), his comedy might take a few episodes to sink in, a lot of it is based around repetition so obviously you need to listen to several episodes for it to make sense."

panelshow,3agdvt,savois-faire,6,Sat Jun 20 10:57:29 2015 UTC,That quick wit can also get him some ridiculous synergy with other comedians. I'd almost say they get dragged along to his speed.

I think his comedy is like his show 'Not Going Out', it's not the most thought provoking or original but there's so many jokes that you're bound to find something funny in it. It's an easy watch.

Not that I blame the comedians, they probably forgot they even told that particular story, it's just funny what I noticed through binge watching them."
panelshow,3agdvt,CapAhab,2,Sat Jun 20 20:21:29 2015 UTC,"I had the same experience. to be fair, I don't begrudge the comedians for re-using jokes - the sheer amount of screen time and performance time would demand an exhausting amount of writing, even with repeated jokes, not to mention the ones who do stand up comedy or sitcoms as well. also I suspect that there are actually few of us who obsessively binge-watch these shows - I suspect most of the viewing public tune into whatever they prefer when they're able to, and therefore the odds of them noticing repeat jokes are lower, and I suspect a lot of the comedians know that."

Producers explain: ""Each episode will see two teams, made up of a celebrity guest and two comedians, compete in a competitive 'roast' format. The celebrities will have their public profiles scrutinised and their social media accounts hijacked as the rival panels poke around their personal and professional lives. The only thing that can help the celebrities is using their safeword to make it all stop.""   I know a lot of people here are not fans of Katherine Ryan, but maybe the time commitment for this role will reduce her appearances on other shows."

I much rather would like to see him on something like 8 out of 10 Cats, where the ribbing can get merciless. It would inevitably culminate in Clarkson punching Jimmy Carr in a fit of giant manbaby rage. And that would be good television."

Jimmy gave his monologue, then basically just looked at the camera and said ""Well then, lets just get this over with..."". 30 minutes of merciless teasing later (where he didn't defend himself, and basically acted with what seemed to be genuine humility), that was that. Brilliant PR move really.  21 hours later edit: I just decided to go back and rewatch this episode after thinking about it all day. Here's a link in case anyone wants to join me..."

I know what he Angus did was socially unacceptable, but ian and Paul seem particularly harsh in this episode where they publicly shame him for his actions.  I'm not sure to appluade them for sticking to their guns to poke fun at the top story of the week, or be saddened that they went so viciously after one of their own..."

panelshow,37xqh0,canausernamebetoolon,9,Sun May 31 09:49:09 2015 UTC,"In some interview, Parkinson I think, Paul flatly admits they didn't like him. He didn't last long on WILTY, either, so he could be hard to work with. I think they saw an opportunity to push him out. They didn't seem to have any problem with certain guest hosts who had their own hookers-and-blow scandals, so I don't know if the motive was entirely moral outrage. If the call girl hadn't gone to the papers first, they might have leaked the story themselves."
panelshow,37xqh0,hengehenge,10,Sun May 31 10:28:01 2015 UTC,I think both Ian and Paul were very good friends of Deayton's wife. Probably adds a little context.

panelshow,37xqh0,slayer1138,7,Sun May 31 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"Carr took it SO well. I actually admired him for it - he can dish it out to people (have you seen some youtube compilations of his harshest heckles?), but he can also take it, and he can also make fun of himself. he'll still throw out self-deprecating jokes about taxes sometimes."

panelshow,37xqh0,lobster_johnson,3,Sun May 31 11:14:52 2015 UTC,That would certainly be a way to earn the disaffection of your coworkers.
panelshow,37xqh0,yokky,1 point,Sun May 31 20:52:02 2015 UTC,"I've never heard that Merton's mental problems were severe enough to really cause work problems though - I read (albeit from Paul himself) that he left the show temporarily because he thought the format was a bit tired, and then came back because he thought his leaving had shaken it up enough. IMO, checking into a mental hospital was a wise decision on his part - I admire his willingness to seek help. I've also read (from Ian Hislop) that he and Paul have always gone out for a beer after every show (although they don't hang out other than that), so that suggests to me that perhaps he's not that difficult to get along with.   of course, a lot of this is all just gossip and interpretation. I have to admit I'm a die hard Paul Merton fan so I may be biased towards him. :)"
panelshow,37xqh0,savois-faire,4,Mon Jun 1 20:02:58 2015 UTC,"I can understand their reactions. Regardless of the morality of what Deayton did, and of what Merton and Hislop personally thought of him, the scandal become a burden for the show; given that the show is about the news and about satirizing people who misbehave in public, there was no skirting around such an elephant in the room."
panelshow,37xqh0,yokky,3,Sun May 31 23:58:04 2015 UTC,"Ya the clip savois-faire posted expresses this, and it makes sense that they just couldn't go on with him as the host"

What was the scandal precisely?  The strange thing is - everybody (here or on that HIGNFY ep) looove to referr to the 'scandal', but never explain what he actually did. )  So did he killed somebody? Did he rape the Queen?  Then I can understand Fry's support..."
panelshow,37xqh0,Mahaloth,12,Sun May 31 16:02:08 2015 UTC,"Basically, he was caught cheating on his wife with a number of prostitutes, with which he was also found to be doing tons of cocaine. This contrasted heavily with his image as this boring, clean-cut guy so people were very shocked about it. Also, Paul and Ian were known to be good friends of Angus' wife if I remember correctly, so they were quite genuinely annoyed with Angus.  Here is a clip of Paul Merton talking about what happened."
panelshow,37xqh0,Vancha,-7,Sun May 31 16:06:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Actually I'm happy for Angus, happy that he has a life! :) I respect him more now. :)  Although yes, when you look at him you can say, 'he's not attractive enough / rich enough to live such a lifestyle'. :)  So I'm glad that he aims higher! Reach for the staaars, Angus!  Good on him! :)"
panelshow,37xqh0,Mahaloth,1 point,Sun May 31 16:27:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah this was not a good natured ribbing, nor was it a case of defiantly sticking to a principle.  This was a public vendetta mostly from Merton but also in no small measure from Hislop. Theres was already large amount of personal animosity there, and the scandal was pounced on as an opportunity for payback. The biggest indication of this was the following episode was more of the same. Merton kept it up until Deayton was gone.  Its a shame really. The show has had its moments since then, but It's more often than not easy to miss with no regrets.  Edit Just been reading links while watching the link I provided, and it appearers I remembered it wrong. There were actually a few more episodes and then fresh tabloid revelations on Deayton provided the impetus for further baiting from his co stars."

I don't tune in to watch actual countdown.  I'll say this for Joe: he filled a spot despite having absolutely nothing to work with, and did it every time. The rest have a field to get creative with: intros, mascots, language. The ""assistant"" is told to put cards on a board and make it funny. That's hard. He may not have always hit, but it was something.  So I wouldn't necessarily keep the assistant position if they can't find someone who fills that time well. But I'd like to see something else because it's not really about the game."

Also, the jokes are often so related to UK current events that it neither travels well or works with reruns. When I don't understand like half of the jokes, the show doesn't do much for me.

Maybe as an American he's just not used to the panel show format and is just uncomfortable, much how like David Mitchell was on his first QI episode, where he was afraid to contribute and stuff.

A long one, because a lot of people's experiences don't come readily to mind. And it's a finite resource. So the idea that they would arrange an experience rather than waiting for you to do it of your own volition and then asking about it: that just seems a convenience.  The ultimate result is the same: describing an experience you may or may not have had.  The only problem is if on the show you're asked ""why"" and it's not something you actually wanted to do.

I think that was the one where they said 'non-comedian' guests are asked if they have any funny stories they want to tell etc and they try to give them an 'in' to tell them. Have I got news for you : Guests are told to just read the news, but can request a specific topic be brought up if they have a piece they want to do on it (at producers descretion). This is written into the Host's script, which is the only script in the show, but shapes the conversations and direction etc Would I lie to you : Mostly unscripted and improv, but they do know what mystery guests and items they will be getting.

panelshow,35o7vb,SuddenlyGiraffe,6,Thu May 14 13:49:09 2015 UTC,"I think what you have to keep in mind is that even if things are partially scripted that still doesn't mean there isn't loads of improv or 'wit' going on during the show.   Let's make a quick and sloppy list of 'writing versus wit':   HIGNFY: Hosts are well prepared by writers and producers, the rest is told to read and follow the news. Obviously any smart guest/comedian can and will think of funny things about a certain news story or issue beforehand. However, even though the hosts are heavily scripted they vary massively in quality every series, so I think there's plenty of room on the wit side in this program. Mock the Week: People say it's heavily scripted, but that probably means people basically get a lot of info about the content beforehand and of course the standup bits are like snippets of the comedians' actual shows. They still have to make or write jokes and when Mock the Week is funniest is when there is nice banter going on which I doubt is rehearsed.  QI: QI has the advantage of being able to fall back on the interesting part when it is not overly funny and it has the advantage of always having Davies and Fry there who can make things funny from two different angles if needed. Not to mention the fact that most weeks one or more of the guests will be extremely witty comics.  WILTY: Of course Rob Brydon is well prepared as the host and many panellists will likely need some preparation on the things they are going to say and how to lie without immediately giving it away, especially if it's the mystery person lie, but the interrogations themselves and the ridiculousness that comes from that is genuine I think. 8 Out Of 10 Cats: I think this is comparable to HIGNFY in terms of just reading the news and other current events to help you prepare. I think this program is just being gracious about helping out non-comedian guests by prepping them a bit or even giving them a 'bit' so they don't stand out like a sore unfunny thumb next to the comedians. And even with that preparation they still often do, while Locke and Richardson are just funny. Buzzcocks: I'm not so sure about this one. Obviously the show has undergone a lot of changes in recent years, but I personally don't think it's completely scripted, as far as the guests go. One of the reasons I think this is because the show has become significantly less funny the last few years even though it can still be fun to watch.    Overall I think a panel show can be both heavily preproduced with lots of preparation and one can still easily see where the wit and improv is happening. Panel show quality can vary wildly depending on the week's events or guests present while having the same writers and producers. I don't think it's a coincidence that someone like David Mitchell is somewhat of a panel show master. He has great wit and is not really someone who tells jokes, but has funny thoughts on subjects, e.g. his so-called angry logic and things like that.  In the end I think one other thing should be mentioned, and that is editing. While I have no doubt my favourite panel show personalities are genuinely funny and someone like Paul Merton is probably one of the wittiest people on the planet, these shows are recorded in a timespan that varies from one to two all the way up to many many tiring hours of recording. All of this is then boiled down to 30/45 minute shows, which helps to maximise the amusement and take out the mediocre or bad jokes that did not land.  edit: spelling, grammar, etc."

Even the pro entertainers tend to re-use material on other shows (Alan Davies' As Yet Untitled in particular sees a lot of old WILTY material), so it's definitely not 100% off the cuff. I'm sure some of the stories on WILTY have been staples in these performers' routines for ages.  That said, I do believe that the quicker wits like Lee Mack or, say, Bob Mortimer are doing mostly unscripted riffing and there's enough of it that the show stays fresh and fun to watch, unlike Mock the Week which is so obviously canned."

panelshow,35o7vb,opt_in_out_in_out,8,Tue May 12 04:08:00 2015 UTC,What the presenter says is almost all scripted give or take any ad-libs  during the filming.  In most cases the panelists will know what the questions will be so they can have a think and prepare a bit. How much this happens depends on the show. On Never Mind The Buzzcocks for example  they'll be given the songs to perform beforehand and they'll practise.   Remember though that the recordings aren't as spontaneous as they look. The opening round on HIGNFY is a good example. On TV they talk along to a 30 second sequence of clips. In the studio they actualy start talking mid way through the clips and carry on for a while afterwards.... that is then tightened and fills the sequence neatly. It's not scripted but it is given the illusion it might be

panelshow,35o7vb,jeobleo,3,Tue May 12 14:35:21 2015 UTC,"The host normally has both cards, aswell as the teleprompter to follow the script, which is very sensible to keep the shows moving on.  When it comes to QI, you have to remember that the actual recording goes on for hours, and only the ""best bits"" end up in the normal or XL version. It may seem scripted when ""everything"" they say is very funny or on topic, but thats mostly due to the editing. If you saw the 24 hour panel show thingie that David Walliams did, you would see how much randomness the recordings are.  WILTY is much of the same thing, they even edit the show to change the winners (depending on which segments they use of course). I have seen episodes where one team ends up winning, despite the other team actually scoring more points during the recording.   This is much more obvious in 8 out of 10 cats, where the scores are decided much later, and you rarely ever see Jimmy Carr on screen when the scores are read out.  Much of the ""feel"" of scripting may come from the way the scoring is done. In shows where the ""winning"" team gets a specific amount of points, it would seem extremely odd with the lesser funny team (less on screen time) ends up winning in the end, when you barely see them score any points. With QI they have solved this by using an unbelievable complicated scoring system, so nobody really challenges the scores in the end. But when you have standard 1 point per right answer, the scores have to add up in the end, so the focus is more on being funny rather than right."

panelshow,35o7vb,SolopsismSux,2,Wed May 13 15:33:48 2015 UTC,The host has a script obviously and then it's either quite obviously prepared thoroughly (8 out of 10 cats does countdown/Mock the week) or edited a lot (Would I lie to you/QI). My guess is that Just a minute is the most spontaneous. I don't really think it should matter to your enjoyment. I always come back to the idea that it's a medium that creates a type of comedy that you wouldn't necessarily see elsewhere and that like most things a lot of panel shows are mediocre and most of the time it's because their format allows it to be too heavily scripted.
panelshow,35l8bd,Scary_,2,Mon May 11 12:29:57 2015 UTC,Shame there's no Ryan. Love Colin and Ryan together.
panelshow,35l8bd,victionicious,-3,Tue May 12 00:21:33 2015 UTC,"Shame there's no Merton, Toksvig, Steen, Mcshane, Slattery etc. The series went downhill once they were replaced with the Americans"
panelshow,35l8bd,victionicious,4,Tue May 12 08:45:22 2015 UTC,"It definitely became very Americanised, but I don't see it as particularly bad or anything. I only caught the US version on occasion but I found Colin, Ryan, Wayne and Greg great. The early UK episodes with a predominantly UK cast felt like a different show, but I personally separate the two and enjoy them both.  Really though, all I'm saying is that if Colin is on the show, Ryan seems to make it funnier. The chemistry between the two of them is unmatched, I think."
panelshow,35l8bd,victionicious,-1,Tue May 12 08:59:20 2015 UTC,"My problem was that it ended up with Colin, Ryan and Greg every week, normally doing exactly the same games week in week out. The 'Helping hands' game being a good example, they basically did the same thing every week.   It just seemed a lot more dumbed down and less intelligent - and that's not a smear on those appearing, just what they were being given to do"
panelshow,35l8bd,Amarsir,2,Tue May 12 09:04:53 2015 UTC,"I get what you mean. And to be honest I didn't watch WLIIA on a regular basis, only catching it from time to time, so it didn't feel stale.  I suppose it's comparable to 8 Cats Does Countdown in terms of the repeated gags and stale humour after a while. It's funny if you watch one or two episodes, but when you've watched ten you realise it's all the same.  I don't mind Colin or Ryan not being there at all, but I always find when it's just one of them on the show it feels almost incomplete."

panelshow,34rk3r,mtmdog,9,Mon May 4 02:44:48 2015 UTC,"First of all, she's not really meant to be funny - and I think 'unwatchable' and 'just the worst' is going way too far, but that's just an opinion, I personally find the Joe Wilkinson bits in this 'unwatchable' and 'just the worst' myself.  Secondly, I've only seen her in that QI episode and this 8 out of 10 does Countdown Episode - both run by different channels. I'd hardly call that 'keep getting booked'.  Don't be so harsh on her - she's bringing an unusual gimmick into a comedic situation and trying to pull it off well, combine that with being a female entertainer in the first place and everyone is pretty much pitched against her from the word 'go'."

(I used to be super excited about his appearances, but now I'm pretty indifferent) While I think those episodes are still hilarious, I think I'd like them a lot more if there were more regular series in between each series of Countdown.   (Also, with each additional season of countdown, Sean Locke seems to hate the game more and more, and I'm kinda starting to feel bad for him.)"

I too really loved some of Joe's bits - especially the one where he was a magician - but there's no need to have him on every episode.    And yeah, you can tell Sean hates it. I really hope that hasn't caused friction behind the scenes that might jeopardise the show.    One thing I really like is that they've had guests who, for whatever reason (in Dara O'Briain's case maybe some sort of panel show exclusivity deal) haven't been on the original show that much over recent years.    Some of my favourite of those include Vic & Bob, Bill Bailey, Josie Long & Adam Buxton.    So yeah, I still enjoy Cats Does Countdown, but nowhere near as much as I enjoy 8 Out Of 10 Cats."

I got introduced to more panel shows and personalities through it and went back and watched a lot more of the regular 8oo10c too after enjoying the spin off so much.   So I have a fondness for the format and participants now that I haven't let go of and I don't want to see it die but it is tired right now. They can only talk about how good Jon is and how much Sean hates it so much and how Jimmy fired Joe, who I love by the way, (mostly for how much he makes Sean and Jimmy laugh! They really have no idea what he is going to do or say sometimes) before they really lose momentum.

It would be much easier if Clarkson goes off the radar for a little bit to let the story die down, and then he can reappear and people can love him again.  While it might make for good television, I doubt Clarkson would be able to host so soon after being fire, and be able to continue on with the show without making remarks about the situation. If he didn't make remarks it would be like the elephant in the room."

He allowed the comics to rip into him, and you could even see it deeply effected him, but he weathered the storm and didn't back down from the harsh criticisms launched his way.  Clarkson's situation is obviously very different, but there is a precedent from a host continuing through controversy and coming out on the other end with earned respect."

The comedy intertwining of Clarkson Hammond and May cant just be replicated like that. So i would say that top gears potential future may be in making it more focused and then allowing the hosts to grow into the same kind of relationship as C H and M. Let top gear become more focused on a car show, focus on trying to find a point where the cast start complimenting each other and then develop it in whatever way is felt right. Sure some viewership will go but at least the viewership interested in cars will stick around, then when the cast and crew find their humour style it can start capitalising on that.  Tl;Dr : the new top gear should start more purely as a car show, then capitalise on when the cast find their settling point on styles and comedy."

The Daily Show is at its best speaking to broad, global truths, not bogged down in the minutia of US partisan politics. As much as I love the show, it's grown stale over the past few years because of the impression that it only caters to standard liberal talking points. I'm basically the target demographic, but it doesn't feel good being preached to.  When Stuart first took over, he characterized his political stance as ""passionately opposed to bullshit."" As long as Trevor Noah is able to detect and attack whatever bullshit comes his way, he'll be just fine."

panelshow,30u8hv,BrianBoyko,3,Mon Mar 30 19:26:44 2015 UTC,"It sounds quite interesting. You might like looking at a show called The Mole, which plays on this idea, albeit in the form of physical and mental challenges (think high budget, 90s gameshow). It might help you refine some points and create an atmosphere of mystery.   The only slight issue I see is the reveal to the panel being at the end whilst the audience know who is it anyway. Could potentially be solved by not giving each panelist 1 go, but having a format whereby Dave could be the traitor all 5 times, or 0 - otherwise you may finish on a strange note of panelists just simply saying ""oh, Dave was the traitor 10 minutes ago... I thought it was a, x, y, b, c but it was actually x, a, b, y, c!"" which doesn't make for great listening.  On the whole though, I think it's a fantastic idea."
panelshow,30u8hv,Jordalordalord,3,Mon Mar 30 23:41:09 2015 UTC,"We've prepared five true or false statements on five separate topics, and it is up to the panel to separate facts from fiction. However, on each topic, a different panelist will act as a traitor and will attempt to lead the team into selecting the wrong answers.   This was enough to convince me. This is a really good idea. I'm sure that if the podcast was succesfull or done really well, this could easily be turned into a tv show. It combines elements from so many shows, but it is unique. Well done."
panelshow,30u8hv,bobbyfle,4,Mon Mar 30 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"WOW this sounds awesome... (not sure I am feeling the name) but the concept is GREAT!   ""Traitor to The Truth"" or maybe ""WhoDunKnowIt"" or something... I'll let the name grow on me."
panelshow,30u8hv,JMElmore,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:58:09 2015 UTC,"I think your basic premise is fantastic, and would absolutely listen to this show.  That said, I think the specifics of your execution are wobbly.  I think if you played it following the rules you've set here, the traitor will either be obvious or ineffective.  Rather than having very specific and detailed facts for your panel to rule as true or false, keep the facts basics.  That gives the panel the chance to recall the specifics on their own if they know them, and gives the traitor more wiggle room to sow doubt and confusion.  Then, at the end, the host can say who was right and who was wrong, and fill in the remaining details.  This is closer to the format that QI and The Unbelievable Truth use, and for a good reason.  I also suspect that your scoring mechanism is too complicated, especially for an audio only broadcast where you can't display scores on the screen.  But scores are not that important in a panel show, especially in a case like this where the players all have pretty clear goals.  you might just try testing the format without scores at first, and develop a system based on how your tests play out."

TV shows copy each other all the time"
panelshow,30ozkc,IAMyourSOLIDturd,5,Sun Mar 29 12:54:28 2015 UTC,"I used to work in film and TV development. The advice you're getting here about ""just change the title and make another small change and you'll be fine"" is not correct. If that were the case, every channel would have its own version of The Price is Right, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy, etc with slight changes. Concepts are intellectual property owned by the creator, and they can enforce their rights if they feel like your show is too closely aligned with their show. Basically, ask yourself this: if you explained the concept of the show to someone and then they could respond with ""Oh, you mean it's exactly like the unbelievable truth?"" you've got a problem.   This can seem confusing because seemingly similar movies and TV shows get made all the time and the lines between original ideas and ""based on"" can get really blurred. In this instance though, taking an existing product and remaking it, the law is pretty straightforward and regards that as theft.  To be brutally honest, chances are nothing would ever happen to you if you ripped off the show wholesale, especially if you just preformed it locally in Austin. When you start talking about doing a podcast, things get more complicated because you're going to be going out to a larger audience and there's more of a chance someone will get wind of what you've done. For brevity's sake, here's the worst case scenario:   You start a podcast that is awfully similar to The Unbelievable Truth. After working very hard on this podcast and gaining listenership, it lands on the iTunes Top Ten. (Yay!) Someone from BBC legal listens to the show and believes you stole their concept. You get a cease and desist letter from the BBC, and then you have to decide if you're going to stop doing the podcast or continue to do the podcast. You continue to do the podcast thinking that the cease and desist is just posturing. The BBC learns that you've been making revenue off the podcast in the form of live ticket sales and podcast sponsorships. They sue you, and now you're involved in a court case.    This post is not meant to dissuade you from doing this, but just to warn you that you really need come up with your own concept, or drastically change the idea. 99 times out of a 100, you could do this and no one would notice or care; however, there is still the chance that if you make it too similar, it could get shut down or at the very least, messy. Then, you've worked on something for nothing. It all depends on if someone, somewhere decides to care.   On a personal note, I would love to see more American panel shows, especially if they featured Austin improvisors. I know a bunch of those guys/gals and they're great. So, again, I'm not trying to say ""don't under any circumstances do it"" just make sure you're smart about it."
panelshow,30ozkc,timesuck,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:12:07 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, would the legal situation be different if the show had it's own concept, but did a ""panelshow tribute round"" each episode? So 90% of the show is original and at the end there is a Just A Minute/Would I Lie To You?/etc. round."
panelshow,30ozkc,Millennium_Dodo,2,Mon Mar 30 18:13:11 2015 UTC,"It would be the same situation. Anytime you are profiting off of someone else's idea, you open yourself up to trouble. Basically, it's like covering a song. You can't just cover any song you want to. Technically, you have to pay the songwriter for the performance rights; however, there's an economy of scale. If you're a band playing for 10 people in a bar in Cleveland covering a Beatles song, you're probably fine not paying for the rights. If you're in CBS primetime and you cover a Beatles song, even if the rest of the show is your own original music, you better have paid for that song or you're in for one hell of a lawsuit/penalty."
panelshow,30ozkc,timesuck,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:33:41 2015 UTC,"Looks like I need to brainstorm some ideas.    How about this: ""Obfuscating Stupidity""  On the panel are five panelists, and a chair, and five rounds:  Chair:   We've prepared five true or false statements on five separate topics, and it is up to the panel to separate facts from fiction. However, on each topic, a different panelist will act as a traitor and will attempt to lead the team into selecting the wrong answers.    Once the answers are revealed to be correct or incorrect, the panelists will vote on who they believe to be the traitor amongst them. At the end of each round, the traitor will get points based on how many panelists they deceive and how many statements the panel gets wrong, while panelists will get points if they correctly identify the traitor or their fellow panelists falsely accuse them of being the traitor.   Ultimately, the game will be won by the panelist who can best discern who is obfuscating stupidity, and who is exhibiting the genuine article.    So, for example, Alan, Bill, Carrie, Dave, and Edgar are all panelists.  The first topic is ""Psychiatry"" - which Dave knows is his category to be the traitor.   The host reads off five facts:    According to the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, electroconvulsive therapy, otherwise known as ""electroshock therapy"" is more effective for the treatment of depression than antidepressants, with a response rate of 90% in first line treatment and 50 to 60% in treatment-resistant patients.  Side effects include headache, muscle soreness, confusion, and temporary loss of recent memory.   (Debate, they give their answer: True) ""Yes, You're right.. Electroconvulsive therapy is actually considered one of the least harmful treatment options available for severely depressed pregnant women, and is administered under an anesthetic with a muscle relaxant.""    The practice of psychiatry was common in ancient Greece and Rome, with those with psychotic traits being kept at special academies where they could either be kept out of harms way or loosed upon enemy warriors.  Of the 700 Thespians who took part in the battle of Thermopylae, historians estimate that about 30 were part of Lochoi from the Boeotian League, one such academy.   (They say ""True"") ""Sorry, you're wrong - the Greeks and Romans thought mental illness was caused by supernatural factors - modern models of mental health did not come about until the 1800s, although the ""mental illness is caused by supernatural factors"" theory is making a comeback in the form of Scientology.    In 1973, Dr. Rosenhan sent 12 pseudopatients to psychiatric hospitals in the U.S. To gain admission, they feigned auditory hallucination, but after admission, the patients acted normally and told staff they felt fine and no longer experienced any additional hallucination. All twelve were forced to admit having a mental illness and agree to take antipscyhotic drugs as a condition of their release, eleven of them being diagnosed with schizophrenia. After this first study's findings were released to the hospitals, Rosenhan announced he would send out more pseudopatients to a targeted mental health facility.  Over the following weeks, out of 193 new patients at that facility, 41 had been identified as pseudopatients by the hospital, when in reality, Rosenhan had sent no one.    (They say ""False."") No, this is completely true! Despite constantly and openly taking extensive notes on the behavior of the staff and other patients, none of the pseudopatients were identified as impostors by the hospital staff, although many of the other psychiatric patients seemed to be able to correctly identify them as impostors. In the first three hospitalizations, 35 of the total of 118 patients expressed a suspicion that the pseudopatients were sane, with some suggesting that the patients were researchers or journalists investigating the hospital.   From 1953 to 1973, the CIA's MK-Ultra program included a subprogram dedicated to psychic warfare, in response to Soviet experimentation along the same lines. One of the goals was training troupes to bend spoons, in the same manner as Uri Geller, and the use of psychic ""remote viewing"" to spy on Russian military installations.    (They say: False) ""You got it right - it's false, but not as false as you think. The CIA's MK-Ultra program was entirely about mind control and truth serums, used to gather intelligence, however, Major General Albert Stubblebine, who was commanding general of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command from 1981 to 1984, tried to create a breed of psychic super-soldier who would have the ability to become invisible at will and to walk through walls, and required that all battalion commanders learn how to bend spoons in the manner of psychic Uri Geller, who was discredited by Johnny Carson on the Tonight Show back in 1973.    In the early 1800s, England and France had thousands of individuals in various asylums, however, after the passage of laws in France in 1838 and in the U.K. in 1845, that number dropped to less than 900 combined by the 1900s.    (They say: False): ""Yes - while the laws were passed reclassifying 'lunacy' as it was then known, as mental illness and was a breakthrough step in the treatment of the mentally ill, it actually went in the other direction, with only hundreds of people in institutions in the early 1800s compared to thousands at the end of the 19th century - part of that, of course, was the building of more mental institutions and, some would say, the move from a rural lifestyle to an urban one.""    At the end of that round, you got three right, two wrong.  Cast your suspicions now.     Alan votes for Bill Bill votes for Edgar Carrie votes for Dave Dave votes for Edgar Edgar votes for Dave.    The chair secretly discards Dave's vote.    Alan has no points, he got the traitor wrong, and nobody said he was the traitor.  Bill didn't get the traitor right but Alan falsely accused him, so he gets 3 points. Carrie correctly identified Dave, so she gets 3 points.  Dave fooled two players, so he gets 4 points - two wrong answers times two wrong panelists.  Edgar correctly identified Dave, for 3 points, and was falsely accused by bill, for another 3 points, 6 points total. Dave's vote for Edgar doesn't count because Dave was the traitor.    These scores are secretly tallied up and revealed to the audience at home, but kept secret until the end of the game.    The game continues for 5 rounds, with each panelist having a turn at being the traitor."

It's a completely different game that you made up, so you shouldn't have any problems even though it's vaguely reminiscent of The Unbelievable Truth (but only very very tangentially in that they both have to do with ""facts"" and lying).

Unless you're gonna hand out a dictionary at the door because most people don't know what that word means, lolololololol am i rite?! But seriously, that's a tricky word.

panelshow,30ozkc,AjBlue7,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:42:42 2015 UTC,"There really isn't an enforcable copyright on a lot of panel shows. For example, whose line is it anyway, can't stop comedians from playing those games, because comedians have been playing those games well before whose line came around. However the name is definitely copyright, and the only way you get sued for copyright is if you copy the shows format completely, play all the same games, and have a host with 4 performers, with the host giving out points.   I would suggest that you don't make money from the videos, as long as you aren't commercializing it, you should be fine.  Also, I don't think you would have much trouble if you were an assorted show that would do a different panel show format every week.  Just think about most panel shows though, a lot of them have barely any proprietary stuff, obviously you can't copyright getting a group of people together with a host, and talking about the new, or interesting facts. However once you start getting into using the same points system (of which doesn't matter in most panel shows), thats when it becomes proprietary.   So you either go with the song cover route where you don't make money off of it. Or you go with the route of putting an ounce of effort into making a format that is a little different than everything else. Just use logic, they can't copyright things like a standard quiz show. Just like how pawnstars can't enforce a copyright on having a reality tv show in a pawn shop.  The sad part is that, your panel show probably won't get a lot of views because the comedians/hosts are generally the only reason most panel shows work."

panelshow,2w7jil,shadowmask,7,Wed Feb 18 16:31:37 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered - if they're so delicious and so endangered, why don't we just take a few, breed them like crazy until we get a sustainable population, and sell their meat as a delicacy?  Animals useful to humans and the least endangered animals on the planet. Why not save the species by letting us eat them?"
panelshow,2w7jil,Amarsir,17,Wed Feb 18 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"I'm going to guess they don't breed very well. For such a long-lived species if they had many offspring their habitat would be over populated quickly.  It would be a solution, much like there are rare animals people might like as pets if they could be bred and sold. But often it's just an innate breeding issue."
panelshow,2w7jil,shadowmask,8,Tue Feb 17 22:16:34 2015 UTC,"That and the other thing are why I said delicacy, like Kobe beef or something. If you charge enough, anything can be profitable."

So if your lead time on a giant tortoise farm was 10-20 years you'd never be able to charge a low enough price to sell in a meaningful quantity.

He acts as the head of the (fictional) titular museum, while a panel of three guests – typically a comedian, an author and an academic – each donate to the museum an ‘object’ that fascinates them. The radio medium ensures that the suggested exhibits can be absolutely anything, limited only by the guests’ imaginations.   First three series have Bill Bailey, Sean Lock, and Jon Richardson as co-hosts (respectively), alongside three other guests per episode.   Kind of seems like a QI/Room 101 hybrid."

But apart from that he was pretty clever and was on point with stuff like that ""That would be my Dad"" and the mascot. Plus, he's got a persona similar to Jack Dee - not smiling or applauding much - which doesn't fit in perfectly with the whole parody theme of the show."
panelshow,2u9fde,larkhills,12,Sun Feb 1 02:07:54 2015 UTC,"romesh's style is definitely more suited to mock the week and more serious shows than this. maybe if he had toned it down a bit, it would have been better.   he also sucked for most of the rounds, which never helps. if he was actually good, i probably would have enjoyed his comedy elements more, if that makes any sense... doing poorly and complaining just comes off as bitter rather than if he was doing well and complaining where it might have just been funny to see him focus so much on complaining and still win.   worst part of the show by far was josie. she provided nothing to the show besides bragging how well she was doing with the dictionary infront of her."

Also, Vegas looked far more... sober? this week than I usually see him. Often enough in his appearances on QI he looks as though he's just come off a bender. For all his own jokes at his own expense with regard to his intelligence I think I'm coming around to the idea that he's far cleverer than he gives himself credit for."

Established panel shows last for decades, so unless there's a new host or team captain, renewals rarely make news.

Also a rare opportunity to see Jon's wit fail him when they made fun of his H-less name.    Here you guys go. No borders thanks to Nick.
panelshow,2soqnt,RaaaR,3,Sat Jan 17 01:57:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. Jon did amazing. He made everyone proud!! Wow.  Also I felt like Sean was really genuinely bothered by Roisin.

panelshow,2soqnt,TheInkEyes,3,Sat Jan 17 05:26:53 2015 UTC,"I have noticed that Sean doesn't really seem to enjoy Countdown, or at least didn't a couple of series ago, he was pretty rude and acted like he genuinely didn't want to be there for a couple of episodes and was replaced for the remainder of the series by guest captains."
panelshow,2soqnt,OH6Cayuse,7,Sat Jan 17 14:32:55 2015 UTC,"Being amusingly clueless for comedic effect is one thing Sean seems to enjoy, but being ridiculed for stupidity loses its appeal after a while. Alan Davies has managed to get a better balance on QI between being the clown and contributing interesting answers.   On cats countdown Sean just doesn't do well enough to get respect, and his partners just get thicker. He may have resigned himself to the role, but he isn't getting happier with it."
panelshow,2soqnt,cheesiepoofs,2,Sat Jan 17 18:10:56 2015 UTC,i always thought alan's role on qi as the clown was a little bit strange. Its funny that they make fun of him for being stupid but more often than not he does better than anybody else.

Then Stephen Fry, who I think is great but who has a sense of subtlety more appropriate for American comedy than British, has been continuing to go all out in playing along with Alan's role of the fool."
panelshow,2soqnt,AjBlue7,3,Sun Jan 18 06:26:08 2015 UTC,"Actually they have talked about it before, there was a documentary about how qi came to be, and alan job is to be the person that breaks the tension in the room. It is what prevents the show from being a standard quiz show. If there isn't a clown on qi then everyone on the show would only talk when they think they have the answer and then it would be boring. I think alan helped open up the guests and its almost like a competition to see who can clown the most.   There has been episodes before with smart people, and in my opinion the show is quite boring when all the questions are known by a guest. However that one show with the audience member that knew every answer is one of the best in my opinion. Kind of an awesome dynamic was created where all the guests would get the question wrong and they would joke and send the question over to the guy yelling in the audience."

I don't know if Jack is coming back or not. Jack was supposedly upset last year that a listener complained the Samantha jokes were demeaning to women. But Barry Cryer later said that the row was over. And I guess ISIHAC does live episodes that they don't record, and the BBC doesn't like that.  This tour has ten dates, which is a lot for a show that usually airs only 6 episodes and records two shows a night. I don't know if any of these episodes are being recorded."

You've probably noticed by now that in most of the panel shows the actual score is irrelevant - it's about the game and improvising some funny comedy. ISIHAC takes this a step further - the games themselves aren't taken seriously. New rules are invented on the fly and can be broken for comedic effect whenever the panelists feel like it. The most famous game is Mornington Crescent, which really is just improvisation chaos masquerading as a game. For comedic effect a special rule or variation is used nearly every time the game is played, try  this one on Youtube for a prime example.  The game features a lot of long-running gags, the most famous of which is Samantha, the completely fictional scorer. She's only an excuse for sexual innuendo."

Assuming a radius of 400 ft and a dome height of 50 ft (both generous but reasonable assumptions), the volume can be approximated using an oblate half-spheroid to be about 16 million cubic feet—or about half of the 30 million cubic foot volume of the Stratos balloon. Close, but no cigar!  Edit: After posting, I realized I made a mistake in my estimation of the height. I used an image of BC Place to estimate the height of the dome to be about an eighth of the diameter, but in my calculations I used an eighth of the radius. That doubles the result of the previous calculation, meaning that the dome on BC Place (since removed) is still in the running for the world's biggest gasbag (pending more accurate calculations)."

panelshow,2r5md9,NickFromFulham,3,Sat Jan 3 00:42:27 2015 UTC,"I understand what they're saying about leap years, but can someone do a better job explaining the why the day was inserted in the middle of the month?"
panelshow,2r5md9,CheezyMcWang,7,Sat Jan 3 02:08:12 2015 UTC,"I can try, but it is going to sound crazy.   The first thing to know is that the length of a year for early Romans was 12 lunar cycles or 355 days (a lunar year is actually 354.37 days). Before about 713 BC, the Romans only had 10 months (which each had 30 or 31 days instead of the 29 or 30 required to keep a lunar calendar in sync), leaving 51 days just hanging out outside of any months. The first month of the year was March, which contained the vernal equinox (i.e. beginning of spring). This makes some sense as the new year, because it was when you planted seeds and began the agrarian cycle.  Circa 713 BC, Numa Pompilius decided to fuck with the calendar. First he took away a day from each of the 30-day months (because even numbers aren't lucky). Then, he added two months (January and February) for the now 57 days without a month. Unfortunately, you can't split 57 days into two odd-numbered months. So, he took the unlucky 28-day February and split it into two odd-numbered parts: pre-Terminalia February (the first 23 days) and post-Terminalia February (the last 5). Terminalia was the traditional last day of the religious year, and placing it here meant the new year was still close to the beginning of spring. So, essentially, he solved the problem of an even (and thus unlucky) month by using the new year to split it into two odd parts. When leap months (known as Mensis Intercalaris) were necessary to realign this lunar calendar with the solar year, they were added right after Terminalia and the last part of February became the last part of the leap month. Weirdly, though, January 1st was considered the beginning of the civil year.  When Julius Caesar came along and fixed the Roman calendar to approximate a solar year, he put his leap days at the beginning of the religious year: after February 23rd. Here's where Stephen's mention of the Ides comes into play: Romans didn't count up from the beginning of the month like we do, they counted down to the next phase of the moon. February 23rd wasn't called ""February 23rd"", it was called (basically) ""the seventh day before the Kalends (new moon) of March"" —  despite being in February. The leap day was called ""the sixth day before the Kalends of March"" and the shifted day became (basically) ""the other sixth day before the Kalends of March"". When we started counting up from the beginning of the month, we could have stuck to this pattern and had ""February 24th"" and ""the other February 24th"", but that's silly. Instead we insert February 24th, what would have been the 24th becomes the 25th, what would have been the 25th becomes the 26th, etc. A fun consequence of this is that if you were born between the 24th and 28th of February on a non-leap year, you have technically been celebrating your birthday a day too early every leap year.  TL;DR Because February 24th was the first day of the Roman religious calendar."
panelshow,2r5md9,SkatchyBrad,4,Sat Jan 3 20:35:53 2015 UTC,"This also explains for me why we have:  September, October, November, December which clearly correspond to the numbers Septem (7), Octo (8), Novem (9) and Decem (10), despite them now being the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th month."

panelshow,2q0jjb,savois-faire,8,Mon Dec 22 18:10:21 2014 UTC,"I feel like Angus Deayton never had the right playfulness for the show.  I say that less about his own jokes and more about his ability to get what others were doing and add to it.  For example, remember one episode where David reads something embarrassing, and then Lee jokes ""Well this is definitely true, no questions needed."" Then Angus turns and goes ""OK there's their answer, let's find out."" And Lee has to stop him so they can actually play the game.  Now that came off as ""host doesn't understand that this is comedy and not an actual game."" I want to give Angus benefit of the doubt and assume that he was just over-the-top deadpan playing along with it. But just the same it didn't work.   Rob brought in an energy where everyone's just having fun first and structure is second.  And  i think that works a lot better."
panelshow,2q0jjb,Amarsir,3,Mon Dec 22 14:25:24 2014 UTC,"The whole point of Angus' character is that he is distant and official, and thus works quite well as a panel show host.

There is no way you could imagine Angus having a go at the game, where as Rob's are quite good fun."

panelshow,2pa4cc,obilankenobi1138,27,Sun Dec 14 21:31:43 2014 UTC,"He's like a combat comedian or something. He can size up a situation, identify the comedic bits, and start firing off jokes while everyone else is still trying to rub the sleep out of their eyes. He's amazingly quick-witted.  And he's also great at that self-deprecating humor, even more so than most British comedians. He's good at looking dumb and hiding just how funny he's trying to be. He could be an undercover combat comedian.  He may have failed in the BERMUDA incident, but in my opinion that scenario was unwinnable, like the Kobayashi Maru. I think he handled that mess far better than any other comedian on the panel show circuit could have. I mean come on, Una Stubbs? He thinks on his feet."

panelshow,2of3bz,tristesse_bonjour,7,Sat Dec 6 12:10:12 2014 UTC,"I vaguely remember something I saw in a documentary more than 10 years ago, about how laws in pre-hanseatic and hanseatic Bergen functioned. I think there was something about if a man accused you of being the receiving one, so to say, in a homosexual relation, you had to react in the way that Stephen said, and defend your honour, or you would be put in front of the court. The accusation would allow you to enter in holmgang, a duel.  I found something on the legality from NTNU (Norwegian university for technology and science): (my translation since google translate and norwegian is a horrible combination)    Det var straffbart å beskylde noen for homoseksuelle handlinger. Likevel finner vi mange norrøne tekster om dette, med ordene rass-argr eller rass-ragr - betegnelser for en umandig, homofil, pervers eller foraktelig person. Mannfolkgærne eller nymfomane kvinner ble omtalt som fudorg, forteller Seim. It was punishable to accuse someone of homosexual actions. Still, we find many norse texts about this subject, with the words rass-argr or rass-ragr - Implying an unmanly, homophiliac, perverse or despicable person. Man-crazy or nymphomaniac females were called fudorg, Seim tells us.    Also, rass means ass, and argr indicates effeminacy :  wiki   The practice of seiðr (sorcery) was considered ergi in the Viking Age, and in Icelandic accounts and medieval Scandinavian laws, the term argr had connotations of a receptive, passive role of a freeborn man during homosexual intercourse. There are no written records of how the northern people thought of homosexuality before this conversion."

In your circle of friends, family, and coworkers, aren't you the person that the others frequently consider to be the sort that knows a great deal of random information? You watch QI. You go out of your way to be able to watch QI.

QI is not a general knowledge quiz, not only on many occasions they ask about very obscure facts, but also sometimes they distort fact or questions so they are more interesting/easier to work for comedians.  With that in mind look at Hawks in this episode. He provided answers to main parts of obscure questions and that's it, never answered follow up questions, never provided interesting extra info about it. He might be very knowledgeable, but what a unlikely circumstances must have occurred for him to be able to show his knowledge in such way.   Panelists who are genuinely knowledgeable (Sessions, Toksvig, Baker, Hamilton) act in a very different manner. It's useful to be able to recognize people who are possibly trying to look more knowledgeable then they really are."

British TV has much less of an ADHD feel to it than American TV, which also comes across when you compare @midnight to a typical British panel show.

I'm not sure how ""in love with the panel show"" America could be, based upon the way @midnight is actually presented. The thing about UK panel shows is that they use the premise of the game show in order to get to the off-the-cuff banter, but @midnight very strongly sticks to the game aspect of the show. I often find myself wondering what the show would look like if they left in all of the verbal sparring that's going on between questions, and which have obviously been left on the cutting room floor.    But, hey, maybe America is actually falling in love with the panel show, rather than the ""fake game show"" that @midnight is really presenting itself as, and maybe we'll get a show or two that's more focused on the panel aspect, the personality of the panelists, the discussions, and wit rather than punchlines.    Come to think of it, and if I'm being totally honest, the closest thing to the standard UK panel show format that I've actually seen on American TV was the first half of Chelsea Lately, where the comedians would come on and talk about the pop culture headlines of the day."
panelshow,2n08o6,justjokingnotreally,1 point,Sat Nov 22 08:07:01 2014 UTC,I'd never really considered @midnight a panel show but I guess it kinda fits that mold. Even still I probably won't be mentioning it to other Americans when I describe what panel shows are after they find out my nerdish fascination for them.  I had watched @midnight a couple times when it first came out and was mostly ambivalent but in the last month it has become a go-to event for me. The last week has been some of the strongest episodes I've seen and at least 2 have left me laughing until tears started falling out of me. I know it's not for everyone and certainly some shows aren't very strong but it's very entertaining.
panelshow,2n08o6,cutofyourgibberish,0,Sat Nov 22 06:52:28 2014 UTC,Can you recommend particular episodes?

panelshow,2n08o6,ConTully,6,Fri Nov 21 18:55:33 2014 UTC,"I disagree. It depends whose on, like all Panel shows. The episode a couple of weeks ago with Paul F. Tompkins, John Hodgman an Greg Proops was absolutely hilarious ."
panelshow,2n08o6,Serberusprime,2,Fri Nov 21 19:12:09 2014 UTC,"guests very much, make the show, on panel shows. those guys you mentioned are seasoned comics and have their timing down very well. proops is often seen on british panel shows, too.  i watched a few episodes early on and it seemed quite clunky, as expected. all panel shows are scripted, in the sense that the guests are primed to what the topics/questions will be and they can either come up with gags themselves or the writers may give them gags. so, it takes time for them to find their timing and for it to seem natural. i really feel they should reformat the show and have two regular and 2 guests each week and the host in the middle. lose the podiums and sit behind desks. this gives the guests a more relaxed feel and less like the jeopardy style they have now, which seems too urgent and forced."
panelshow,2n08o6,ConTully,1 point,Sat Nov 22 05:04:18 2014 UTC,"So make it like every other panel show?  I prefer it the way it is, to be honest. It's set up like Jeopardy because the rounds are a quickfire style. I prefer that, it keeps the energy of the show up and makes it a little different than other panel shows.  Also, I was only using the Proops episode as an example, they've had plenty of good episodes with other American comedians. Sure, not every joke kills but because of its style and speed you don't really notice.  Edit: Spelling."

He got a fair bit a flack when he charged 31 Pounds for a short, unfinished ""warm-up-for-my-big-tour"" show of work-in-progress material, basically the sort of shows major comedians do to test out material and see what needs to be fine-tuned and what needs to be trimmed, for which they usually charge at most about 12 Pounds (I saw Simon Amstell do a 30 minute show like this at the height of his Buzzcocks fame for which he charged 4 Pounds a head, in London), this drew particular criticism as it was an Edinburgh Fringe show, which are supposed to be cheap as chips."

If you go to see Jimmy Carr or Frankie Boyle or Sarah Millican, you can expect to be offended by at the language or the type of jokes they tell - if you're the kind of person who finds offence at such things.  That means that the easily offended crowd won't go to their gigs, and they won't bring their kids, friends or family either. With McIntyre this is much less of a concern.  He just appeals to a broader audience,"

It's the same reason you used to see a lot of things mirrored, or why you're liable to only find Simpsons clips that are filmed with a root vegetable and have the cameraman laughing at it (though I kind of enjoy that)."

It’s sort of an experiment I’m engaged in: it will take five years before anyone notices I don’t do it anymore, because it’s repeated so often. It’s done its job for me. People see it, I’m on television a lot, it helps keep my profile, helps sell tickets when I’m on tour. I don’t need to go back and do it.  I might go back and do it in the future.

Additionally, the stories that the writers make up tend to be a lot duller than reality (truth being stranger than fiction, etc) so I tend to go with the more outrageous of the initial claims, but I try to factor in the personality of the person reading it as well, and trying to think if it matches what i know about them.

Jack is very and his humor is very camp and very pop culture centric and I don't think that plays off of Victoria's very dry delivery, and vice versa. They don't enhance each other.   Other episodes she has been on she laughs a lot. I don't think she's a fall on the floor giggling kind of person, but I don't think this one episode really shows off her personality.   I wish Jack wasn't on this one, even though I like him and I love his flirting with Stephen. He has such a strong personality he needs another strong person who is a veteran to balance it and kind of keep him in line so to speak. Lloyd and Victoria are very quiet and dry and kind of got lost. But I like them together a lot.  Lloyd has a wonderful silly and almost whimsical humor, they didn't need another silly person. He and Alan can do the more light hearted jokes, Victoria and someone else could do the more informational jokes.  This one just didn't mesh that well. Which is a shame because I like all of the people and I was so happy to see Lloyd on it. He quickly became one of my favorite guests on Undeniable Truth and I wish he had a bit more room to expand on qi. Maybe on the XL there will be more of him."

I appreciate it :) I don't mean personal offense but downvoting me for saying what I think and taking it so seriously and personally is not really mature...  Anyway. I agree. Jack is very loud and dynamic and he some times takes over and goes on for a bit. I just think she was a little too annoyed by things for a comedy panel quiz show. I can't wait to see the xl.

panelshow,2jka0t,TheInkEyes,1 point,Sun Oct 19 03:15:47 2014 UTC,"I didn't down vote you. I responded because I noticed there was a bit of a disconnect between Victoria and Jack as well (that's the diplomatic way of putting it) and was thinking about why during the episode. Your comment spurred me to write about it. It created discussion, and while I may disagree with some of your points I wouldn't down vote because of that.  Your second comment seemed a bit more antagonistic and not as ""furthering discussion"" as before. But it also had already been down voted and it seemed unnecessary to add more."

That's how she usually is when she's a guest, she asks a lot of the good questions. She's a good guest because she balances out Alan, who's basically employed to be the voice of the audience and get things wrong, and the other two guests, who are generally more interested in being comedians than treating it like a quiz show."

panelshow,2j6e0q,That_Guy_JR,5,Tue Oct 14 03:12:23 2014 UTC,I've never heard of him before. I can't help it - I'm young(ish) and the elders in my life have neglected to introduce me to such genius.

I always try my best not to watch the episodes when I see they've come out, and wait for the XL version, but I don't always succeed. I believe they actually film for about an hour and a half each episode but half of it's cut."
panelshow,2ifff6,Lolkac,3,Mon Oct 6 20:27:01 2014 UTC,Oh so it's extended version. Thanks
panelshow,2ifff6,phyphor,2,Mon Oct 6 20:32:41 2014 UTC,eXtra Long version
panelshow,2ifff6,Calpa,7,Tue Oct 7 00:44:29 2014 UTC,I just can't stand Ross Noble.. whenever he's on the panel the show just seems to be mostly jokes revolving around making funny noises.  ..I'd like some more David Mitchell please
panelshow,2ifff6,cl3ver,17,Mon Oct 6 10:48:47 2014 UTC,I'd say the 'funny noises' was definitely centered more around Colin Lane. Ross Noble was pretty clever. I still think the Ewok/Lake of Farts moment is one of the better moments in the whole series.   Nothing like a riff about butterfly penises.
panelshow,2ifff6,theehill,5,Mon Oct 6 17:54:50 2014 UTC,"I thought he was funny, but sometimes doesn't know when to end a joke and that put me off to him a little."
panelshow,2ifff6,larkhills,3,Mon Oct 6 22:34:10 2014 UTC,"i think on an episode based on animals, funny noises and comedy with ross noble and crew would work a lot better than david mitchells and the intellectuals.   save them for the more historical-based shows. we need some silly episodes too..."

panelshow,2ie8zn,canausernamebetoolon,6,Sun Oct 5 22:55:23 2014 UTC,Why can't America have fun panel style shows? Why is everyone here so useless in making comedy? Why do they seem to care who wins?
panelshow,2ie8zn,HerbaceousMeteor,8,Mon Oct 6 09:32:32 2014 UTC,"I've seen a few attempts at panel style shows here in America, whether they're bits on Fallon or whole shows like Craig Ferguson's Celebrity Name Game. There are two main differences that I notice, which I think makes the American versions far inferior to shows like QI/WILTY/etc.   One, the points actually somewhat matter. In America, even though they're fun games, in the end it's about who wins. Even panel shows like WILTY or 8/10 Cats Does Countdown that keep legitimate score don't really care when you win in the end.  Two, which goes hand in hand with one, is that American games feature non-celebrities (regular people), or are not focused on celebrities. When I watch QI, I want to see a bunch of funny celeb comedians I'm familiar with tossing jokes around and not caring if they embarrass themselves. American panel shows will have laughs, but not jokes, and contestants, but regular people who I don't care about. Regular people are fine on shows like Family Feud or The Price Is Right where the whole point is to show regular people winning things. The whole point of panel shows, IMO, is to watch funny people be funny."
panelshow,2ie8zn,orbit222,2,Mon Oct 6 19:58:58 2014 UTC,The only half decent one I've seen is @Midnight on Comedy Central.
panelshow,2ie8zn,ConTully,1 point,Mon Oct 6 22:54:54 2014 UTC,"Well your final question answers the other two, and winning is pretty ingrained in American culture. The best American version of a panel show is the old Whose Line, where they wrote in a joke at the beginning of each episode to explain that ""the points don't matter."""

panelshow,2i8p7c,MartinSchou,5,Sat Oct 4 18:31:00 2014 UTC,What's a bun seller?
panelshow,2i8p7c,optimous012,16,Sat Oct 4 02:11:20 2014 UTC,"Someone who sells buns.   Apocryphally, elephants like (sticky) buns. Some believe this is because people used to feed bread to elephants at western zoos, so they developed a taste for it. Another possible source or reinforcement for the myth is Nellie the Elephant (children's cartoon) who likes buns. Here's a humans vs elephants bun eating contest and here's an old newspaper article telling British elephants prefer buns to peanuts.  The joke thus being that the elephants were attracted to Kevin the bun seller (a concept made up for the joke), not David."
panelshow,2i8p7c,Piqsirpoq,3,Sat Oct 4 05:37:33 2014 UTC,"Yes, something along these lines. I wondered the same thing after all of Gervais/Merchant/Pilkington's elephant man jokes in their podcasts"

panelshow,2i8p7c,spaaaaaz,1 point,Wed Oct 15 22:40:08 2014 UTC,I have no clue! Was that a callback to an earlier joke we missed due to edits? Is Kevin the bun seller a British thing? I was so confused by that line and the response it got.
panelshow,2i8p7c,Dashtego,5,Sat Oct 4 03:55:45 2014 UTC,"If there are any Americans asking (as one myself who has now read this thread), I believe the equivalent would be a peanut seller...as the stereotype in the US is that elephants love peanuts."
panelshow,2i8p7c,gllyflower,2,Mon Oct 6 19:12:56 2014 UTC,That makes a lot of sense. If it was peanuts I would have definitely gotten it.
panelshow,2i8p7c,Dashtego,3,Mon Oct 6 23:08:49 2014 UTC,"I assumed David implied it was the actual reason elephants showed interest whenever he was near one, since the bun seller was the only one always with him."
panelshow,2i8p7c,RaaaR,1 point,Sat Oct 4 04:24:02 2014 UTC,"Right, but why Kevin the Bun Seller rather than anyone else with any other job? Do elephants like buns? Or is a bun sellers just some common figure at British zoos who would always be around because he's at work?"
panelshow,2i8p7c,Dashtego,3,Sat Oct 4 04:28:21 2014 UTC,"yes, elephants liking buns is the joke."

panelshow,2gx9qu,sirgregg,3,Sun Sep 28 19:53:31 2014 UTC,The show was never intended to be a series. There were a couple one off episodes in 2012 as part of the Channel 4 Mash-Up 30th Anniversary event. Same with the 8 Out of 10 Cats does Deal or No Deal. Each of those two episodes are counted as an individual series. And the next two episodes made in early 2013 are the third series. While cappers usually consider the first 4 episodes to be one series. So that's why numbering is always off from cappers vs wiki.

He left Not Going Out to be a more serious drama actor (from what I read), and here is with Joe Wilkinson as the resident comics. His performance was what I expected, but there was an overwhelming feeling for me of, ""Well, turns out drama's not for me, and Not Going Out won't have me back, so I'm doing this..."" Here's hoping he's back on Not Going Out. His character went away for a bit, not killed or permanently removed in some way."

To me, all the celebs in this episode look like they're having a great time and they make some quality jokes. If /r/gameshow is referring to Joe Wilkinson's indifference, that's how he is all the time. It's part of his character. This makes me wonder if /r/gameshow actually has any appreciation for British comedy.  As someone who has seen a lot of Hollywood Squares, the humor in it is really hacky/groan-worthy and the celebs usually don't look like they wanna be there.   I laughed harder at this episode than I ever have at Hollywood Squares."

The atmosphere that I expected from a modern revival of Hollywood Squares wasn't present in the episode I watched yesterday.

I get that it was supposed to be funny but I honestly think he was paying that more attention than the game.  Three, I think Joe's whole thing went on a bit too long. I love him, don't get me wrong, but that was like a good 10-15 minutes, all things considered.  Other than that, it was pretty good. Not an outstanding episode but it wasn't terrible."
panelshow,2fm7u7,RaaaR,3,Sat Sep 6 23:54:55 2014 UTC,"I actually think David's letter and number joke went too long that it lost its comedic value and became cringe-worthy. I generally appreciate his rants, but it felt like he was trying too hard to be funny on this episode."
panelshow,2fm7u7,ThumbtacksArePointy,1 point,Sun Sep 7 16:26:38 2014 UTC,"If I had to guess, it was probably something like this:  ""Okay it's about letters and numbers. Let's talk about those and break them down, that's some harmless fun and education.  ...why does he have a puzzle? Shit, abort! Abort! ""Sorry, I forgot to do the puzzle."" Good.""  And by the end he more or less stabilized. The real problem was not pairing him with Sean, IMO."

Even in a prior when he did that whole tennis thing, it wasn't really funny. I think the problem is that he's good at the game and Sean just isn't, and Jon can't seem to be interested in something that isn't at least a little bit of a challenge. I don't understand why, when they get someone with a half-intelligent brain, don't they pair them with Sean so it can at least be somewhat fair?   Though, I must say, Jon's puzzle was still better than those times he would shout ""nine"" and then come up with un-funny god awful words.  Unfortunately, it just looks like Sean and Jon are both over Countdown but in it just for the money/contract at this point."

But in the same way that I still love my cat, even after it's thrown up on my bedding.  It's getting old, and Joe is just off-putting. I don't know why he's there, except to fill time in a show that is normally 30 minutes long. And I don't find him particularly funny. There's ridiculous and real and Adam Sandler/Rob Schneider ridiculous. Joe is just not funny. He's had a moment, here and there, but he's too serious about his ridicularity. The funniest thing he did was when he tripped in his Genie shoes. It seemed unscripted and his little smile gave me a small laugh. It shouldn't be that the only out-of-character misstep is the only thing that made me laugh about his performance. If he's fired from the show, then, please, just let him go.  There's only so many times you can laugh at Sean's boredom with the format or Jon's knowledge that he's going to win, anyway. I get the feeling that the comedians are bored of the format, too. I think that's the biggest detractor."

I'm also curious why they seem to be pushing the Countdown version so hard. I hope they do something to even out the teams, because it's starting to get stale to have Jon Richardson repeatedly sabotage his own efforts in order to keep things fair.

panelshow,2er0av,mihametl,-8,Wed Aug 27 23:51:28 2014 UTC,I'm with you. He's simultaneously feeling his opinions are being restricted (left/socialist views that are almost always the only political opinions represented on bbc panel shows) and happy about the bullshit arbitrary quotas being enforced.
panelshow,2er0av,radiobaby,22,Thu Aug 28 00:33:06 2014 UTC,"Frankie Boyle is a leftist. A representative tweet:   Some attack benefits & immigration but I think it's worth remembering IT WAS THE BANKS. THEY TOOK ALL THE MONEY. IT WAS ON THE FUCKING NEWS.   Also, the BBC is a public broadcaster, paid by the entire TV audience to represent all of Britain. That's why they go to great expense to have a BBC Alba in Scottish Gaelic and a BBC Cymru in Welsh, as well as a ton of smaller BBC radio and TV channels in every region. If you're against the BBC representing everyone, fighting for the return of exclusively male television programming isn't the most obvious place to start."
panelshow,2er0av,radiobaby,-1,Thu Aug 28 02:35:36 2014 UTC,"I'm certainly not for 'exclusively male programming',  but arbitrary gender based quotas like that are just totally absurd to me.   I'm not totally sure what the first point is you're making, I know he's a lefty, but what I'm saying is left opinions are almost always the sole political point of view on panel shows and he's acting like his views are being somehow censored.   I wonder how he would feel about panel quotas based on political demographics?"
panelshow,2er0av,radiobaby,6,Fri Aug 29 15:08:56 2014 UTC,"The quota, such that it is, is ""not zero women."" That seems defensible for a public broadcaster.  As for conservative representation, the BBC obviously does have mandate to represent all views, up to and including giving Nick Griffin airtime. HIGNFY, the one panel show that invites politicians, and the one with by far the highest ratings, rather notably invites politicians on the right. But when it comes to comedians, who are the hot young conservative comics coming up in the comedy clubs who these shows should be choosing from? There just aren't conservative political acts in the clubs. I'm quite sure the only reason Gyles Brandreth is still invited is because he's a former Tory MP. The reason women comedians are specifically invited is because there were many to choose from in the clubs but they weren't getting airtime. There just isn't a collection of conservative comics in the clubs who are fighting for airtime and being denied it, else conservative papers would be championing their cause."
panelshow,2er0av,halfajack,2,Fri Aug 29 20:09:47 2014 UTC,"I think you've effectively changed my mind on the quotas. I didn't know it was 'not none', for some reason thought I read it was based on how many men were on the show they had to have a certain number of ladies. As long it's not always Katherine Ryan or Sarah Millican, you're right, that is perfectly defensible for a public broadcaster.  Even being the conservative libertarian type guy I am ""hot young conservative comics"" made me laugh, but that's also partly why I mentioned it in relation to Frankie's comments. The BBC being public--as you sort-of stated--attempts to be all things to all people, at least in the minds of the liberal oriented, as I see it. They (for short) seem to see everything as fairly balanced as long as there is a decent ratio of penises to vaginas, while the matters of political bias and general social thought is presented in a one sided manner that definitely does not reflect the electorate.

Currently out of power).  Shows absolutely no leadership whatsoever, which is odd because he screwed his brother over to win the position of leader of the Labour party.  Will become prime minister if Labour win the next election.  Nick Clegg - Cowardly liberal democrat (The 3rd party.  Used to just be a ""protest vote"" more than anything serious.) who sold out the principles of his party and his election promises in return for being deputy prime minister.  Nobody won the last election in the UK and as such, liberals had to join forces with the Conservatives in order to form a Government and he basically let the conservatives do what they want, whilst letting election promises like ""we wont allow an increase of student tuition fees"" to fall by the wayside.  George Osborne - Chancellor.  He basically controls the countries purse strings.  The economy seems to be improving in spite of his policies, rather than because of them.  When something goes right, it was all his master plan.  When something goes wrong, it wasnt important anyway.  Posh boy, born into power and bred for it.  Pretty much one of the most hated men in Britain.... so obviously hes tipped to be one of the front runners for next leader of the Conservative party.

George Osborne is not well regarded in England...look no further than his announcement at the London 2012 Olympics and the cacophony of boo's that followed.  It is bigoted to judge someone on their class. But the class system is very real in this country; to say otherwise is just disingenuous given the backgrounds of the front benches. You focused on that part of the  Lebens funny and concise overview rather than the points he wished to get across. The pretty thankless fucking task of being the Chancellor of the Exchequer...it certainly doesn't help when you're pretty smug looking in the process.  However, it is interesting (and rather saddening) to note that Labour are electing more officials from political classes than the Conservative party.  Personally I find all three of our leaders as a bunch of Blair-lites in disguise...a bunch of cunts put simply.  But that doesn't add much to the discussion so I will add that since New Labour it is becoming harder and harder to discern between a left wing party and a right wing one in this country.

All preach their respective corners then when given an opportunity to legislate and legitimise their political leanings tend to sit somewhere right centre when it comes to actions and policies.

As for the newspapers, each one caters to each of the many, many, many political/social viewpoints in the UK. One of the most beautiful things about London is walking around and seeing what papers the people are reading and carrying - you can instantly stereotype them.

panelshow,2aht0y,AjBlue7,3,Sat Jul 12 19:25:17 2014 UTC,"I feel like the channel encourages them to do more countdown episodes, because that allows them to have two productions for the price of one essentially, its the exact same set and game, yet they have drastically different audiences.   Also, I never really liked 8 out of 10 cats, the show is clearly a way to get a panel of comedians together, and the actual game of the news is quite boring, and becomes outdated fairly fast.  I imagine 8 out of 10 cats countdown episodes can be rerun as much as they would like, while I think regular 8 out of 10 cats gets outdated because half of the fun as an audience member is supposed to be guessing what important news happened.  I like cats does countdown, but I'm a little disappointed about the dynamic the game has went on. I like Jon Richardson, but I feel like he ruined the series by being too good at the game, so now a bunch of people playing the games just make up bullshit in order to be funny, and clearly Jon handicaps himself a lot of the episodes and it can get quite boring.  The ones where he makes up 9 letter words every turn, is particularly bad.  Also, Its not really just his fault, because Sean is weighing down the series as well, by acting like he doesn't care about winning every game. Its gotten repetitive, when it didn't need to be. There are plenty of jokes built around the show that the contestants could just play the game like normal."

panelshow,2a8jna,canausernamebetoolon,5,Wed Jul 9 16:55:10 2014 UTC,And the press release.
panelshow,2a8jna,canausernamebetoolon,18,Wed Jul 9 19:46:50 2014 UTC,This is awesome. But I did like the rotating guest hosts and also I would have chosen Lee Mack to host.
panelshow,2a8jna,Ninmatt,16,Wed Jul 9 14:35:36 2014 UTC,"I think that Rhod will be great. It means that I need to improve my Welsh accent comprehension though. When he talks fast he can still lose me.   Given my druthers, I would have liked to see Frankie Boyle take the slot."
panelshow,2a8jna,alephnul,12,Wed Jul 9 15:16:28 2014 UTC,"Oh my gosh, I would have LOVED if Frankie Boyle were the permanent host.  Could you imagine all the ""celebs"" that just wouldn't get his humor?  When he was on the panel with Destiny Child's Michelle Williams, I couldn't stop laughing.  ... of to watch NMTB episodes on Youtube for the millionth time..."
panelshow,2a8jna,courtachino,2,Wed Jul 9 22:22:35 2014 UTC,"In my own personal Best Of All Possible Worlds, I would like to see Frankie back in his old seat on Mock The Week, but I don't see that happening. Next best would be to see him in a regular spot on another topical panel show. I thought that his turn as host of NMTB was the best of any guest host."
panelshow,2a8jna,alephnul,1 point,Thu Jul 10 03:34:24 2014 UTC,Simon is the gold standard of NTB for me... except for any episode Frankie Boyle's in. I would have watched his episodes five or six times each I reckon.
panelshow,2a8jna,PrettyGirlsMakeRaves,2,Thu Jul 10 11:42:23 2014 UTC,"Question. As an American who loves watching these shows (WILTY, 8 Out of 10 Cats and their Countdown episodes, QI, etc), what's a good way to try and learn all the dialects?"
panelshow,2a8jna,Auxillary,1 point,Wed Jul 9 20:26:18 2014 UTC,"Learn to understand them, differentiate them, or speak them?  An answer that covers all three would be to just keep watching all these shows and totally immerse yourself in a variety of different media. The most important thing is use critical thinking. Use context clues and all the other skills that you picked up reading challenging literature at school."
panelshow,2a8jna,SuddenlyGiraffe,2,Wed Jul 9 20:57:12 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's basically it. I've been watching UK stuff so long they're instantly recognizable to me. If you're just trying to learn to identify them look at some extremes like Charles Dance's toff accent, Ross Noble's northern accent, Cheryl Cole's geordie, Kevin Bridges's glasweigan, Danny Dyer's cockney, there's a thousand of them but you get the point."

panelshow,2a8jna,radiobaby,1 point,Thu Jul 10 00:34:52 2014 UTC,"More to understand, at least as a starter. I figure if I can understand them, the differentiation will come naturally. Jon Richardson and Sean Lock I picked up on quite easily. Some other guests not so much."
panelshow,2a8jna,Auxillary,1 point,Wed Jul 9 21:23:38 2014 UTC,"Honestly I think the hardest part is not being familiar with all of the slang and local/cultural references while trying to adjust to the accent at the same time.

Untitled seems more conversational and anecdotal, like friends sharing stories over a pint.  untitled is more polished too, the shaky-hand-cam-closeups in green room bothered me"

Beyond the fact The Green Room is simply more aesthetically interesting than As Yet Untitled.   Compelling guests is a matter of opinion, I have enjoyed the British guests much more than the American sample provided. Sophisticated production? It's a bunch of people sitting around a table talking, how sophisticated do you want? And as for aesthetically interesting, if you're worried about the aesthetic feel of the show, the actual content really can't be thrilling you that much.  I don't know if anyone can copyright the concept of ""a bunch of people talking around a table with a drink being funny."" That's almost a fundamental aspect of life, and I sure as hell am not going to be paying a licensing fee whenever my friends come over for a night of hanging out.  IANAL, but I'm fairly certain there is a very specific ""intent"" component when talking about IP theft, and I can EASILY see the concept being independently thought up."

I do like the openness of ""controversial topics,"" so they don't get bogged down in a certain gimmick (looking at you Would I Lie to You and Was It Something I Said).   However, I'm worried the ""controversial"" part may cause some of the panelists to clam up if the joke is insensitive. I trust they trust the Canadian public to distinguish ribbing from hate speech, but not having as large a culture of panel games as the UK it's not certain.

The unnecessary pretext of an organized competition has been dropped, and Rove McManus is a better host than Grant Denyer was.  In practice, the program is a disaster.  For all of its flaws, Slide Show at least came across as a professional television production.  Riot seems more like a series of failed experiments by college students who somehow obtained a network TV budget.  It was just painful to watch.  I don't recall viewing a televised comedy show in which the studio audience was less enthusiastic than this one was.  And sweetening their reactions (or lack thereof) with a laugh track wasn't a viable option; much of the audience appeared on camera, so their boredom was on display.  As joke after joke landed with a thud, I actually felt embarrassed for the performers.  They clearly tried very hard, but this format is astonishingly ill-conceived."

panelshow,25ac6i,TWiThead,1 point,Mon May 12 03:15:16 2014 UTC,"Indeed, the Australian version was excellent, in part because it stuck around long enough for the most talented performers to be invited back repeatedly and grow increasingly comfortable with the format.  The American version didn't quite measure up, but I've always felt that it had the same potential (which went unrealized because it was canceled almost immediately).  It came much closer to duplicating the Australian version than the equally short-lived British version did."
panelshow,25ac6i,TWiThead,5,Mon May 12 03:27:54 2014 UTC,"I just viewed the first installment of the Australian version, Slide Show.  I was not impressed.  The program opened and closed with each of the two teams taking a turn with the slanted stage bit, titled Slide On Over, which was the only segment involving improvisational comedy (and calling it that is generous).  The performers (including highly talented veterans of Thank God You're Here) were assigned identities with no noteworthy characteristics and placed in mundane scenarios with no interesting or unusual elements.    Because of the 22.5° angle, the participants struggled to walk and complete simple tasks, causing them (and various props) to fall down and slide across the floor repeatedly (which made little sense in the fictional situation's context).  That's it.  There were no other sources of comedy.  Given the physical constraints, it was nearly impossible for the performers to even act out a remotely coherent scene, let alone improvise any humorous dialogue.  The host, Grant Denyer, interjected instructions — not to introduce new twists, but to tell the performers how to react and what props to use (purely to ensure that the desired mishaps occurred).  If there was even a slight chance of something funny being improvised, that surely killed it.  After the second scenario's conclusion, Denyer arbitrarily named a Slide On Over winner.   The remainder of the show comprised a series of party games (similar to those from Hollywood Game Night), which varied from week to week.  In this instance, the first required two members of each three-person team to lie on a mat and use their bodies to form the individual letters in a single five-letter word (""ZEBRA"" for the first team and ""HANGS"" for the second).  This game appears in the Riot preview video.  Every other game was a variant of charades, with the participants acting out or drawing words or phrases for their teammates to guess.  Each round was won by whichever team completed a task in less time or accomplished the most in a predetermined time period.  At the end of the program, all of the score-keeping was inexplicably disregarded, with the studio audience selecting the winning team by show of applause.  I found this off-putting.  Whose Line Is It Anyway? famously has points that don't matter, and Thank God You're Here's winner was selected on a whim as well, but all of that is/was clear throughout the proceedings.  Conversely, Slide Show went though the tedious formalities of an organized competition, only to abruptly cast aside the scorecard for no apparent reason.  Even the overall presentation was poor, with Denyer continually stumbling through the performers' and segments' introductions.  Note that Slide Show was canceled after a brief run last year.  Hopefully, Riot will be somewhat better.  I expect Rove McManus (who's Australian, but wasn't involved in the production of Slide Show) to be more competent in the role of emcee.  But that won't be enough."
panelshow,25ac6i,seriousmurr,2,Mon May 12 02:56:44 2014 UTC,"What a shame.  Well, I guess if you build such a set, you want it to be used as much as possible. But I can see the novelty of it wearing off quickly.  I'm personally not a big fan of whose line's sideways scenes either, but at least the cast is still top-notch and it's only part of the total show."
panelshow,25ac6i,TWiThead,2,Mon May 12 09:04:21 2014 UTC,"Also, while Sideways Scene's setup impedes movement, it doesn't prevent the performers from engaging in actual improvisational comedy (albeit with similar sight gags arising every time, which becomes tiresome).  In Slide Show, the slanted stage gimmick's humor was derived from the participants' inability to function normally and difficulty interacting with one another.  The show featured some of Australia's top comics alongside entertainers without comedic backgrounds, who were rendered essentially indistinguishable from each other.  Had random studio audience members taken part, the outcome would have been much the same.  It was all about people struggling to complete mundane tasks, falling down and sliding around.  For me, the novelty wore off during the first scenario."

By and large, Hollywood can't compete.  I dunno, maybe it's just me.  I just think the humor usually displayed on the UK's panels is quicker, smarter, and has more bite."
panelshow,253fbg,FiftyCals,3,Fri May 9 03:24:46 2014 UTC,"Thats true, but a lot of these people are actors and not necessarily comedians."
panelshow,253fbg,BajaBeans,3,Fri May 9 04:43:52 2014 UTC,"On comedy panel shows, I agree. But this isn't a comedy show — no one on this show is a stand-up comedian. This is just a game played by celebrities.  But I also think part of the UK's superiority with comedy panel shows comes from decades of those shows being on the air. Comedians (and producers) have watched, studied and practiced what works in the back-and-forth of TV panel shows for 24 years now, since HIGNFY came on the air. But when the US tries a comedian-led panel show, the comedians don't richochet their jokes off other comedians, they just fire them straight at the audience. It's like the comedians are just lined up and told to each deliver a punchline. (See @midnight.) I think a big part of that is that American comedians have never had a ratings-juggernaut panel show that they've been rehearsing for in their heads since before they ever went to an open mike night. They've just been rehearsing their solo standup routines.  Of course, then something like Viral Tap comes along and reminds us that, even in Britain, the choice of comedians is everything. Maybe America just hasn't found the right ones."
panelshow,253fbg,pgl,1 point,Fri May 9 07:58:27 2014 UTC,They've just been rehearsing their solo standup routines   This is my issue with shows like Mock the Week. The comedians are too clearly just reusing lines from their standup shows.
panelshow,253fbg,Mr_Dionysus,1 point,Fri May 9 11:33:26 2014 UTC,"Well, the ""standup challenge"" round usually only features comics who are on tour (that's why they don't all go up), and the subjects are straight from their routines, rather than randomly selected. But the other rounds (Here's a photo of Cameron with the initials GOFB, things you're unlikely to hear at a Labour party conference, things about the number 83) are made-to-measure. They all come up with the material ahead of time, though."

The mixing makes it even worse - the public is already so over the top, why do they have to be that LOUD on TV?  I really feel the show is going towards a 'mediocre laugh all the time' direction while I personally prefer the 'huge laugh every minute'."

I have now watched every 8oo10c, QI, Mock the Week, Never Mind The Buzzcocks, a lot of Would I lie to You, much of Charlie Brooker's various shows, and bits of other Brit comedy here and there.   It took a while, but I am getting so that I understand most of the cultural and political references. The problem I still have is with a few guests like Rhod Gilbert, Johnny Vegas, and John Bishop. I think that Rhod and Johnny are hilarious when I can understand them, but when they talk fast I just can't cut the accent. I don't know if John Bishop is funny. I have never been able to understand a word that he says.  I keep watching, and I hope that, sooner or later, the accents will come clear for me. The struggle has been worth it so far.

(Hops act as a preservative and produce a bitter, beer-like flavor.) The alcoholic content of mead may range from about 8% ABV  to more than 20%. The defining characteristic of mead is that the majority of the beverage's fermentable sugar is derived from honey.  It may be still, carbonated or naturally sparkling, and it may be dry, semi-sweet or sweet.     Image i - A dry home-made orange melomel.

Asked if another straight-laced newsman, veteran Chicago TV anchor Bill Kurtis, might take the role, Sagal suggested the show could be looking for generational and stylistic change, as well. “Bill Kurtis is great, and he's another retired gentleman in his 70s,” Sagal said. “As you know Bill Kurtis has filled in for us very well. I would not be surprised if he came back and helped us out in the short term.”  But so significant a personnel change gives the staff an opportunity to tinker with the format in a way that hit NPR shows rarely are able to, for fear of offending viewers.  “For example,” Sagal said, “what if we got somebody who was really good at sound effects? What if we got somebody who was a stand-up comedian? A really good mimic? There's all kinds of things we could do. Even a beatboxer.”   I think that makes sense, minus the beatboxing."

Exceptions I can think of are Rochelle Humes as team captain on Sweat The Small Stuff on BBC Three and Victoria Coren Mitchell hosting Only Connect on There's A Fourth BBC Channel?

It just has a certain dynamic to it that you don't get when a female comedian is part of the ensemble, even if she is fanstastic. There are a quite few female comedians I really like, but to be honest, I think this rule puts constraints on something that should not be constrained."
panelshow,1xe60m,Azurean,17,Sun Feb 9 01:36:41 2014 UTC,"I think it will be a good thing in the end, it may be different and weird at first but the issue is not with requiring a female panelist. Social expectations, having less role models, and having a 'boys club' atmosphere are often cited as dissuading/stopping women from becoming as successful as men in certain fields, comedy being one of them. This requirement may help give exposure to some really funny female comedians which may inspire other really funny women to pursue comedy."
panelshow,1xe60m,SuddenlyGiraffe,17,Sun Feb 9 01:55:51 2014 UTC,"but whenever I look at britian, they are generally on the forefront of breaking down barriers between people, such as gender/ethnicity/sexual orientation.  I don't think this is going to give exposure to female comedians, because many places like QI regularly have female quests.  I can imagine that stephen fry doesn't like this rule because it is very ludicrous to force a quota onto a show, when it comes down to having guests that are qualified to be on the show. In the end a persons body should not determine their eligibility, their qualifications should determine eligibility. Its the classic argument that forcing a certain type of person to be in, forces out other people who are more qualified and deserve the sport more. Being a minority doesn't grant you special treatment. If you grant minorities special treatment, they will always be looked at as a minority and not an equal."
panelshow,1xe60m,AjBlue7,11,Sun Feb 9 03:50:13 2014 UTC,"Its the classic argument that forcing a certain type of person to be in, forces out other people who are more qualified and deserve the sport more.   The problem is that sometimes certain people aren't even considered for the spot because they don't ""fit the bill."" How do you know those people aren't good enough if you don't even give them a chance? Enforcing rules like this forces ""casting directors"" (not sure what the process is for panel shows) to put aside their own prejudices for a bit. Sometimes equality is not about literally treating everyone equally, it's about giving enough so everyone is on equal ground.  I don't know if it's just me, but I've noticed that QI is much, much more of a ""boys' club"" than panel shows like 8 out of 10 Cats, Would I Lie To You, etc. It's improved in recent years, but it's painfully obvious in the earlier series. It has so little diversity overall that it detracts from the show sometimes--it was almost embarrassing to watch the panel be so clueless in a segment about kimchi in a recent episode, for example."
panelshow,1xe60m,projectfigment,5,Sun Feb 9 05:24:51 2014 UTC,"However shows like QI already had multiple women on their show, so thinking that the casting directors have a prejudice against women doesn't really work. I guess we won't know for sure, but if the network had to push for those female guests to be on the show, I suppose the mandate is necessary if they had to fight for it, but if it was natural I see no reason in requiring atleast a woman on every show.  Also there is the scarcity problem, what if schedules don't work out and they can't get their ideal female guest on the show? Then you would have a subpar substitute guest that runs the risk of viewers hating the show because of a bad guest.  Just as bad, what if the shows can't find enough female guests, and they have the same female guests on every single episode. If they end up having the same 3 female guests, this new rule would have had no affect on exposing female comedians and talent.  Also, you can reduce the progress of full equality, as many shows might get used to have their one token female on every show, where in an alternate reality without the rule, the show might have been accustomed to have a cast comprised of 50% or more of females."

This is something that irks me: if a male guest is subpar, people chalk it down to the fact that they're just not funny. If a female guest is subpar, people complain that female comedians aren't funny. IMO it's more of a problem with people's perception than it is with actual female panellists. One of my favourite panellists ever to appear on the show was Emma Thompson, and she's more of an actress than a comedian. Maybe they should branch out and not just get female comedians.   Also, you can reduce the progress of full equality, as many shows might get used to have their one token female on every show, where in an alternate reality without the rule, the show might have been accustomed to have a cast comprised of 50% or more of females.   This is something that concerns me as well. I'd love to see more female panellists on the more ""boys' clubbish"" panel shows (Mock the Week is a particularly bad offender), but I do hate quotas. I'm just not sure how else we'd go about solving the problem, though. I find it hard to believe that we'd ever have a panel of 50%+ women, though, with or without quotas.  And just out of curiosity, what do you think about the lack of ethnic and cultural diversity on some of these shows? Particularly QI."
panelshow,1xe60m,projectfigment,1 point,Sun Feb 9 06:16:37 2014 UTC,"Its quite interesting, however I just figure that the cultural diversity is due to uk not having a lot of different culture, but I don't know because I don't live there.  Honestly I think I like it not focusing on being culturally diverse. Like they have that one black guy that goes on QI every now and then, and they don't really care or atleast make his difference a topic in the show, he is just treated like another person.  Where 8 out of 10 cats countdown always talks at length about their ethnicity."
panelshow,1xe60m,AjBlue7,4,Sun Feb 9 08:05:25 2014 UTC,"Just looking at statistics, the UK seems quite diverse, especially in the urban areas.   I don't mean that they should actually talk about being culturally diverse, I agree with you that they should just be treated like another person. I mean that they should have more people of differing cultural/ethnic backgrounds on the show. There's just a general air of being culturally ignorant on QI that bothers me sometimes. It leads to awkward situations like the panel spending such a long time on a question about kimchi, which I really don't think is that unknown. I think more diversity also leads to quite interesting tangents like Trevor Noah talking about Zulu resistance when the panel was talking about British imperialism in South Africa.  If the black guy you're talking about is Reginald D. Hunter, he's actually only been on the show three times. The only other black guy I can think of is Trevor Noah, and he's only ever been on the show once. I think that says something."

panelshow,1xe60m,SuddenlyGiraffe,5,Fri Feb 14 14:08:43 2014 UTC,"I recommend you watch 8 Out of 10 Cats, Jimmy Carr's tax scandal episode. Georgie Thompson is there as a celebrity/tv presenter, not a comedian, so yeah, she's not that great, but no worse than most non-comedian participants on the show.  Sarah Millican is though, and one thing that makes her appearance on panel shows great (in my opinion) is that she's not trying to make a point of being female. She's not afraid of making herself look stupid and she's not shy about her sexuality either (as in having sex, not as in ""she's a lesbian"").  That kind of behaviour opens the male participants a lot less reserved as well, which results in one of the greatest exchanges I've seen on a panel show (segment starts at 32:45), so far only topped by ""they say of the Acropolis where the Parthenon is"" and Sean and Miles' wager on 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown.  Generally the problem isn't with the female participants - it's with the men, who tend to be quite gun shy when women are on the shows. Most of them tend to be scared of offending the women on the show, which is really stupid, and then it tends towards ""pot, kettle ... racist?"""

panelshow,1xe60m,projectfigment,0,Sun Feb 9 05:27:46 2014 UTC,"Because, like it or not, women are subjected to much harsher reactions than men. Not on the shows, but how often have you read comments directed at men, saying that someone would like to kill and then rape them? That happens entirely too often with female participants on shows like these.  That's only one part of the picture though. If you're looking for comedians, there are simply more males than females for whatever reason. I don't know the ratio on that list, but it was 5 of 19 in impressionists and 2 of 37 in musical comedians - that's 12.5%, so if they're exactly as funny (and that ratio holds up), you'd see women 1/7th as often as men."
panelshow,1xe60m,MartinSchou,5,Sun Feb 9 14:29:54 2014 UTC,"It doesn't mention it in the article, but after Stephen and Alan, Jo Brand has actually been in more episodes of QI than anyone."
panelshow,1xe60m,CheezyMcWang,-12,Sun Feb 9 04:03:06 2014 UTC,"Exactly, I'm an american and I was very surprised by this announcement, because many of the panel shows already have a lot of women on them, and none of them felt particularly focus around men. Especially when most panel shows have atleast two people that are on every episode, and it just happens to be men.   For example, the countdown episodes have rachel and suzie, and its no doubt that they are the smartest in the room.  Also, there is a good argument about female comedians, as most comedians are all pretty removed from emotions, since they have to be able to control theirs on stage, like not laughing at their own jokes.   Women generally are more emotional than men, and women that become comedians almost sound dead inside, because they have no emotion left. Most of the women use a deadpan comedic style."
panelshow,1xe60m,AjBlue7,6,Sun Feb 9 03:59:14 2014 UTC,I uh ... what?  I don't feel like that argument is as sound as you think it is.
panelshow,1xe60m,GutterMaiden,5,Sun Feb 9 04:29:23 2014 UTC,"Results from research studies actually suggest that it's a myth that woman are more emotional and empathetic than men. I think your discomfort is because some women defying societal expectations for how a woman should be, which seems more an issue with an inflexible society that doesn't accept diversity than an issue with the woman.   There is also an issue with how we perceive gender ratios. We tend to believe there is an equal amount of men and women in situations where men out number women. Women make up half the population yet 2/8 or 3/8 of the cast being female is seen as a good amount?  To address your other comment: Stephen Fry is a progressive Englishman so he probably doesn't have conservative American values. Though I think he is probably in support of affirmative action, that has no influence on the ethics of the matter.  I can find out the names and scientists of studies for you if you'd like but I am not too interested in getting in a long debate since that turns into a ya-huh/nuh-uh arguement pretty quickly."
panelshow,1xe60m,SuddenlyGiraffe,-6,Sun Feb 9 04:55:57 2014 UTC,"Regardless of reality, there is no doubt that all societies breed the women to be expecting romantic fairytale like relationships, where men are bred to be unemotional mainly to function as a hunter with no remorse for killing life, stemming back to when they were relied upon to kill things for food or to protect their village. Just because society tells people to act a certain way doesn't mean that they do.  There are a few outlier cultures and animals that had women that did all the hunting, however that doesn't affect current humans.  I really don't appreciate your assumptions upon my beliefs, I don't have any discomfort pertaining to women defying societal expectations of how a woman should be, especially since I am a male that prefers to go against the grain on many of societal exceptions of males. Furthermore I don't like how you classify my argument as invalid due to my bias to conservative American values, which is absurd considering about 50% of the Tv I watch is British. It is possible to have an open mind, and while I might label a group of people to think one way or another, I would never expect every member of said group to think the same way. I always allow the possibility for people to be outliers, as there are always outliers no matter what you try to stereotype."

panelshow,1xe60m,bamberoo,4,Sun Feb 9 04:14:57 2014 UTC,"The problem there, is that people confuse ""ventriloquist"" with ""comedian"". Those are two entirely different skill sets. Same with Keith and Orville.  The reason Jeff Dunham is so hugely famous and popular, is not that he's a great ventriloquist - I'm sure there are ventriloquists who are better than him. He's famous and popular, because he's funny. If you can't be funny without your puppet, you can't be funny with your puppet. And while Nina's a pretty good ventriloquist, she is (in my opinion) an average comic, and once you add the awkwardness of the puppet, it becomes even worse in an unrehearsed show - just like Keith and Orville.  Average comics get away with panel show appearances, because they rarely draw that much scrutiny. But if you're going to bring your act to a panel show, you'll be drawing a hell of a lot of scrutiny and attention, and every tiny little thing you do will be magnified like crazy."

panelshow,1xe60m,brain4breakfast,2,Sun Feb 9 00:33:59 2014 UTC,"Whilst I don't really have a problem with this policy I do think it's a tad unnecessary.  When I read through the article I didn't necessarily see it as an issue about female comedians. Whilst it would be nice to see some of my favourite female comedians popping up in more panel shows I also think this is as much to do with the style of comedian and the style of the shows.  Mock The Week (using the articles example) is all about competition to say the funniest thing. The news quiz element is a good structure to get all those people together, but it is comedians competing to be the funniest. That's the style of the show and the comedians it attracts.  Stephen Fry and Alan Davies would be unlikely to appear on it. So would Noel Fielding and Richard Ayoade. These comedians have their own styles and appear on different panel shows. The audiences for all these panel shows will likely enjoy multiple shows, but each show has a different tone.  I honestly think the BBC would have greater success developing a new panel show with a different tone/target that would be more accommodating to the female (and indeed male) panellists who feel uncomfortable in the pre-established shows.  Channel 4 has often been guilty of using women as jokes on panel shows but this really only occurs when they invite reality TV contestants/models/Hollyoaks etc actresses (and actors) onto the shows. With the greatest respect to these people: you are entertainers not comedians. If you come onto a news panel show knowing nothing about news (for example) you're going to get laughed at."

And why are so many people assuming this will make the shows worse? Is it really such a radical position to think that there are more than 4 or 5 funny women in the entire fucking world?

I single out Mock the Week because, while I love Dara, that show has become so painfully puerile that it's no wonder they have a hard time getting women on.  Every other show, especially QI (who for the last episode of series K had three women on the show with Alan and Stephen) and WILTY, get great women comedians week after week.  And on a week it happens to be all men, ""discrimination!"" is the furthest thing from my mind.

Off the top of my head, I think there could be a few panelists from David Mitchell's radio show The Unbelievable Truth whom I haven't yet seen on panel shows that could do quite well.   I agree with others that QI seems to be a rather minor offender in the grand scheme of things. After all, there are only three spots to fill each week, and especially in the later series, I think they've done an excellent job of female representation. When they find great panelists (Isy Suttie and Victoria Coren come to mind) they really shine. And, as with male comedians, sometimes they have a miss (Katherine Ryan seemed ill suited for the format, but I like her on Buzzcocks and Mock the Week).

Unlike other panel shows where there's two really funny team captains and four guests meaning the calibre of comedy is always guaranteed, QI's strength has always been in really funny guests filling those three essential spots. Once you weaken that then the quality of the show will go down.  It already hurts that Sean Lock's regular spot seems to have been taken over by Sue Perkins."

panelshow,1x0evs,David_Harrison,13,Tue Feb 4 22:46:25 2014 UTC,It's predictable and light-hearted entertainment that offsets the unpredictable and sometimes scary real world.
panelshow,1x0evs,SuddenlyGiraffe,9,Tue Feb 4 23:04:57 2014 UTC,"Sitcoms have become predictable, full of stereotypes, and its all been done before. Panel shows kind of remind me of riffing with friends. The jokes are made up on the spot, absurd, and theres a chance it wont work. The cast itself laughs because they're not acting, and its contagious. Not to mention, in many of them, the topics are always topical, like 10 Cats."

Everyone seems like they're trying too hard, Hardwick is only occasionally funny and his host presence often seems forced, and the guests often seem a little confused by the format. It's a tough gig because it's unlike anything else on American TV and I just don't think they've figured out how to really make it work yet."

panelshow,1wo9ua,MartinSchou,2,Sat Feb 1 15:54:34 2014 UTC,"Good point. The show is loud and abrasive, with point totals in the several hundreds (which are constantly displayed in front of each player, something that never happens on the British panel shows). It's just too amped up and feels like a game show. Panel shows should be much more laid back, but of course when we Americanize the concept we can't help but make it more intense and competitive."
panelshow,1wo9ua,Dashtego,1 point,Sat Feb 1 16:50:27 2014 UTC,"That points are constantly displayed isn't that foreign. Have I Got News For You and You Have Been Watching springs to mind.  The arbitrarily high scores is weird though. You saw relatively high scores in the early versions of Have I Got News For You and QI, but that's almost entirely gone to the wayside. It's all for shits and giggles, and as one quiz says (I think it was Angus Deaton in Would I Lie to You) ""the points don't matter""."
panelshow,1wo9ua,MartinSchou,4,Sat Feb 1 17:08:55 2014 UTC,"I think the Sklar Brothers worked because they do a podcast and are used to making comedic banter together. My advice would be to either get rid of the written/recited parts, or limit the written responses to about 7 words so you get punchlines rather than these drawn-out answers that don't get laughs.  The show's still going for the ""young male drunk at night"" demo, but it's improving, I think."

I got way too angry about how bad they are at wordplay. 'Gulliver's instagram feed' 'Girl with a dragon emoji' THOSE AREN'T EVEN PUNS! They just literally put a vaguely internet-y word in a famous title. I think I'm good now that I got that out of my system."
panelshow,1umx84,SuddenlyGiraffe,4,Tue Jan 7 23:05:56 2014 UTC,"I know, there are a few people who were good last season, I think they need to really narrow down a list of quality regulars and keep inviting them back to improve the consistency. Or maybe expand the panel so they can have good regulars while still trying out new people. But the show is doing well in the ratings, beating The Tonight Show and The Late Show in their 18-34 target demographic. Maybe that means they can spend money on more and better comedians?"
panelshow,1umx84,SuddenlyGiraffe,2,Tue Jan 7 23:34:27 2014 UTC,"wow, I didn't know it was that popular. I'd never heard of the show. Are there episodes you recommend? I don't want to write off the show for just one episode."
panelshow,1umx84,FlipFlarington,2,Wed Jan 8 00:04:37 2014 UTC,"Well, I don't know if it's that popular every night or just last night, but it's only ahead in their particular 18-34 demo, and they're behind The Daily Show and The Colbert Report.  I don't know if I'd recommend entire episodes, but some rounds have been fun. Basically, I just forget it's on for a couple of weeks, then check online to see if there were any comedians on who I'm interested in. I'm hoping the show might mature a little more, maybe they'll figure out something to have Hardwick do other than his repetitive ""I can barely contain my laughter enough to say 'points' every three seconds"" routine. Also, I assume the comedians get the questions ahead of time, but I think they need writers, or more of them, to punch up the answers."
panelshow,1umx84,SuddenlyGiraffe,3,Wed Jan 8 02:12:35 2014 UTC,Are they supposed to be strictly puns? Gulliver's Instagram feed is a joke on the fact that people who use Instagram often post their worldwide travels on it. Those two aren't the best jokes ever but not bad for thought up on the spot.

panelshow,1umx84,theshrewd,2,Wed Jan 8 05:19:08 2014 UTC,"I hate the whole, ""omg, British panel show is best panel show"", so I gave this a try and, yeah ok. Maybe export a working series? Something like mock the week could do quite well. Without Frankie Boyle, it's a fairly safe show, and even lets comedians prepare lines, I think that could work over there."
panelshow,1umx84,SuddenlyGiraffe,6,Wed Jan 8 17:46:19 2014 UTC,"Someone mentioned in another thread that British comedians get more practice in comedic conversation than Americans do, so while American comedians are great at sketch comedy or improv they don't necessarily know how to have a conversation with a group of other comedians that an audience will enjoy.   Just a thought I found interesting."

A group of three anythings from archaeologists to zipper repairmen could have the same 'discovery' that they dont know something.  I just 'discovered' I have nothing better to do than rant online about a small inconsequential bit of bullshittery but unless someone peer reviews my schedule and then backs up my assertation, I am just finding out I'm ignorant of yet another thing.

David Mitchell:  Well educated, middle class, quick witted, dull, and self conscious: relatable enough but still better than you could ever wish to be   Rhod Gilbert: Surly and full of ridiculous  stories    Sandi Toksvig:  Sandi is fantastic on QI. She is smart and manages to answer questions correctly while still being funny and without looking like a complete prick who googles the answers beforehand (I'm looking at you Jeremy Clarkson)  *Dara Ó Briain:  Dara is another quite intelligent guy, plus he's irish, so he has that funny accent Greg Davies:  snorkel parka music practice room.

And the show was successful in its short run over the summer: It was #1 in its time slot every night. I don't know why networks aren't trying harder to make panel shows work in the US, since they're cheap to make and get good ratings — a lot like reality shows, finance-wise. Reality shows have been way overplayed. It's time for something new.  The ratings success of this and @Midnight on Comedy Central give me some hope.

BBC blocks their videos in the UK because they're losing money when people don't use iPlayer but the rest of the world can watch whatever they want because there is no immediate loss from letting them.  Channel 4 probably doesn't need to take these down because it creates more marketing from other parts of the world, or they simply haven't realised yet."

It's pretty cool of them really since I rely on youtube to watch stuff like this and can't access 4oD or iPlayer.

I'd find it very odd if people were actually watching for a competitive element or taking marks off the comedian because it wasn't spontaneous. Besides there's plenty of unscripted funny banter.   Ross is entitled to his opinion (I really like his stuff btw) but it's not much of a big deal.

panelshow,1pilu1,canausernamebetoolon,1 point,Wed Oct 30 03:44:31 2013 UTC,Here's Part 2.
panelshow,1pfw48,canausernamebetoolon,5,Tue Oct 29 03:37:33 2013 UTC,"Sigh... guest hosts. Just hire somebody already. Or get back Lamarr.  edit: A pretty good episode, minus the Elvis bullshit. Point still stands though."
panelshow,1pfw48,blekkja,5,Tue Oct 29 06:30:12 2013 UTC,I liked simon amstell a lot as well - thought he did a great job hosting for a while there.
panelshow,1pfw48,tebiegirl,2,Wed Oct 30 02:46:00 2013 UTC,"Yep. Either would be fine. Adam Buxton would be rad, too."

panelshow,1pdj3p,canausernamebetoolon,4,Mon Oct 28 08:59:23 2013 UTC,I want Brian Blessed to narrate me making love.
panelshow,1pdj3p,pacdude,1 point,Mon Oct 28 17:41:06 2013 UTC,"What do people think of WISIS? Do you think it will be a long-running show like HIGNFY/QI/810C/WILTY/MTW? Would you make any changes?  I think the format works, though I would turn the lights up on the set like WILTY and 8 out of 10, and I might prefer David in the team captain role rather than host. David is my favorite panelist, but his energy isn't quite at the level of TV host. He's great hosting The Unbelievable Truth, though. And I miss The Bubble."
panelshow,1pdj3p,SuperSpaze,2,Mon Oct 28 12:40:59 2013 UTC,"This show will probably continue on radio if it's axed by the BBC. There are still if you ask me, quite a few growing pains to get through before it ends up among the classics."
panelshow,1pdj3p,TheBellyButton,6,Mon Oct 28 21:35:54 2013 UTC,I think they need to drop the twitter part of the show. It adds nothing to the show in my opinion.
panelshow,1pdj3p,basementboy,2,Mon Oct 28 23:48:04 2013 UTC,"It feels too polite and stifled. I like the line-up, so I hope it soon starts to come out of it's shell and really show it's potential."
panelshow,1pdj3p,phamnuwen92,2,Tue Oct 29 04:10:05 2013 UTC,I need David Mitchell to start getting angry and ranting.

panelshow,1pbtox,canausernamebetoolon,4,Sun Oct 27 18:51:32 2013 UTC,"Thanks. This sub is exactly what I've been looking for. I've been keeping an eye on /r/BritishTV, /r/quiteinteresting and /r/britishpanelshows but everything is a tad haphazard.  What can we do to help out? If I'm doing the refresh thing waiting for uploads would it help for me to post when something comes up?  Also: Your tags for previews and XL are both blue. Maybe different colours?"
panelshow,1pbtox,blekkja,1 point,Mon Oct 28 03:53:37 2013 UTC,"Oh, I didn't know there was a /r/britishpanelshows. I didn't want to compete with another sub. But it does look like that sub isn't as thorough and obsessive as this one.  Yes, please post new episodes. Also, a trick to finding shows early is to subscribe to uploaders' channels. Videos often show up for subscribers before they show up in YouTube's search results.  And I just turned the preview clips green.  Edit: I've added /r/BritishTV and /r/britishpanelshows to the list of subreddits. And I guess this sub doesn't entirely compete with /r/britishpanelshows, since we've got American and Australian shows, too."
panelshow,1pbtox,blekkja,2,Mon Oct 28 04:28:24 2013 UTC,"Well you seem to be onto it enough to make a go of it anyway. /r/bps doesn't really have that many more subscribers so you aren't really stepping on toes. Adding in US and Australia helps make it different enough, especially if you focus on getting new episodes when they come out - other related subs have a bit of a nostelgia and ""favourite moment in X?"" type discussion aspect too."
panelshow,1pbtox,blekkja,1 point,Mon Oct 28 05:07:28 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I've disabled text posts because I think the ""fan forum"" type posts work best in the show-dedicated subreddits. That said, I will probably post some top 10 lists of clips and things."
panelshow,1pbtox,willwakef,1 point,Mon Oct 28 06:49:50 2013 UTC,"Maybe a good idea for the off season. Right now, for UK shows at least, most of the major shows are early to mid run. With previews, normal and extended cuts there is quite a bit going on from now until Christmas special time."
panelshow,1pbtox,btcprox,2,Mon Oct 28 08:26:53 2013 UTC,"Feel free to suggest shows to add. For the non-panel shows, it's a bit arbitrary, but I'm looking for either topical satire, or shows that have conversational and entertainment elements, but aren't straight game shows, talk shows, interviews or monologues."
