malepolish,3dz5hy,Carguy91246,5,Mon Jul 20 18:38:48 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/a/M9D8q  This really helped my cuticles and nails. The biggest thing is to make sure to moisturize often. You may also want to consider going in for a manicure (without polish you like) to help get the cuticles in shape for self-care.
malepolish,3dz5hy,MissPicklesMeow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:14 2015 UTC,Soak them in warm water and olive oil. They'll be stronger if you cut straight across instead of round. Even just start cutting the tip straight as they grow out. Won't be awkward for long. I use toenail cutters b/c it's wider. And soak them often. They look pretty good.
malepolish,3dz5hy,rscatteredleaves,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"Ok. I'd start working on your cuticles. Begin with moisturizing, even something as simple as a tiny amount of olive oil, once a day, will do wonders. I'd also consider investing in a cuticle pusher if I were you. I have a nice metal one. You can push them back once a week and probably avoid needing a cuticle remover or full manicure. Visually these two things will probably help the most.  After that you might want to think about changing how you trim your nails. The nicest way is just filing them once a week. It takes a little practice but you get the best control over the results, so you can make them look however you like. If you simply must use a trimmer then let them get a little longer than you have now and try to trim each nail evenly. Using a trimmer and getting nice results is actually harder than filing in my opinion."
malepolish,3dz5hy,ShadyBible,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"If you want to go the simpler route, you can buy yourself some krill oil pills. The highest count they'd have. Take those daily and you'll notice a change within two weeks. Your dry cuticles are due to low omega in your diet. All the stuff everyone else said is great if you like the maintenance though!"
malepolish,3dz5hy,purpalit,2,Tue Jul 21 03:57:29 2015 UTC,"I second moisturizing as your 80/20 solution to busted-looking hands and nails. Get two moisturizers: a hand cream (not a regular lotion, a hand cream. you need the big guns.), and a cuticle balm or oil. Buy multiples to keep in different places if you can.  I like Udder Cream for a hand cream because it's light and not greasy. I also prefer cuticle balms over oils because they're not runny and therefore easier to apply. I use Burt's Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream.  So here's what you do:  1) Gently, carefully clip those hangnails. For serious. 2) Put the hand cream in your bathroom. Put a travel size bottle of the hand cream in your daily carry bag, your car, or wherever you will have it with you. Everytime you wash your hands, put the hand cream on afterwards. 3) Put the hand cream and the cuticle oil or balm on every night. Make it part of your routine. If you really want to accelerate your results, wear a pair of cotton gloves to bed to seal the moisturizers in.   A couple weeks of this routine and you will have brand new hands. If you want to go that last 20 percent, then you can go get a mani and learn to maintain your cuticles yourself. I wouldn't try to use a cuticle remover in your current state because you have too much broken skin. It will hurt and expose you to infection. Wait until your cuticles are healthy before regulating their growth.  A couple of other tips: You're cutting your nails a bit too short and rounding them, which is a no-no. It encourages ingrown nails and risks infection. This image is tiny, but it's the best visual I've found that shows a proper cut. Also, you've got sharp edges all around from those clippers. Get a fine grit cushioned nail file and learn how to use it to smooth your nails after cutting them.  Finally, I notice your username (carguy) and some marks around your knuckles suggest that you do some work with your hands. Do yourself a favor and wear mechanic's gloves when wrenching and nitrile gloves when detailing or doing other dirty jobs. Not only do they protect your hands and nails, they keep your hands much cleaner, which means less exposure to things like, say, orange pumice hand cleaner, which is really drying to your skin and nails.   Good luck, and please post your ""after"" pictures! I'd love to see your progress!"

I'm not the kind of person to disregard the feelings of the people I love and say, ""it's my body, I'll do what I want!"" Though I do believe that to a certain extent, I do see it from the other side as well and sympathize with how she feels.  It's something that is a part of me and she's slowly trying to accept it... I'm just venting some lament for the days when it was all a little easier to express myself. These fingernails have been bare for far too long!"
malepolish,3dhxfh,Anjeho,3,Thu Jul 16 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"Do you demand anything of her, appearance-wise? (And what's she got against trans people, anyway?)"
malepolish,3dhxfh,NuclearQueen,3,Thu Jul 16 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"I love guys wearing nail polish.  I just think it's great when men express themselves visually the way women do and always thought it was unfair that they are restricted from doing so more freely culturally.   People are all people and men can be beautiful to, and take pride in that if they choose to in my opinion.  I've been with my SO for over eight years now and he's absolutely not interested in expressing himself that way.  There's occasional jokes between us where I just out of nowhere ask if I can paint his baby toenail. Even half. Even clear. But it's more teasing silliness.  I accept that he's not into it. I've never actually nagged or suggested I find him less attractive because he doesn't. Because I don't and it would be his genuine interest in it that would appeal.  I've also gone out with men who often wore nail polish, and who fully indulged on realising I found it completing acceptable practice. Many even loved getting a full face of make up at times too.  Relationships are give and take.  I know a lot of people in this thread are saying it's a relationship ender, but if you for the most part are ok with the current compromise and the rest of your relationship is full, happy and loving it's your choice.  You could however have a bit more of a chat about it some day. Ask more about why your SO is worried people might think you're gay or trans. I think that's an important thing to establish.  Are they worried you will face violence or harassment? Are they worried because you enjoy decorating your nails that you might be gay or trans and are afraid encouraging it will somehow bring these possibilities to fruition? Are they worried how it will reflect on them? Do they personally find it physically unappealing? If you often wear dark colours does it make them worried you are depressed, or look like you're into a life style she doesn't understand our agree with (goth/punk/metal ect)  By chatting about the reasons why they take umbridge you might abate some reasons behind your SOs dislike. Or allow for more options for use without causing tension.  I think the closest example I have that might relate is an absolute adoration of glitter. In the past I often wore it on my collar bones, under my eyes, on my cleavage, in my hair, on my skin in general. Not necessarily all at the same time...  My SO is not a fan of glitter. And over time early in our relationship would pass comment on it more often.   He had known me for years before we went out, so this sudden ""a thing you do all the time annoys me I'm going to passively aggressively get you to stop"" thing pissed me off a fair bit.  Chatted about it and he didn't mind the glitter on me. But glitter never stays on just one person. So every dance, hug and kiss while we were out on the town transferred to him like a sparkly STD. Showers and days later it would still be in his beard. He was at the time in a job that was male dominated and mostly had older conservative men as customers. So when he started arriving into work with bits of glitter all over him he got abuse in the form of jeering and snide comments. He was jokingly asked if he was gay, had he not gotten his own make up of properly, had he been in a stripclub? When he said it was from me then it turned into questions about whether he was dating Tinkerbell, was i a stripper etc.  So now most nights out I wear less glitter. At music festivals or holidays I soak up the sparkle like a human disco ball. I started using those stick on flat backed crystals under my eyes instead. I use a more subtle shimmering body oil for nights out.  But I don't mind.  It's not him trying to control how I look or not accepting me as I am. There was a real reason behind it and I would prefer his life to be a bit more stress free than to glitter up.  That's why I suggest finding out her real reason for not liking it. And explain your reasons for enjoying it too.  If it comes to a conversation about men not being meant to wear it just because they're men, chat about trousers, it used to seem indecent for women to wear them due to gender norms. If there is little that is gender limited for women to wear it is a step in the right direction for the same to apply to everyone."
malepolish,3dhxfh,iCANdoTH1S,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:32:07 2015 UTC,"What a great insightful reply. Thank-you. To answer your question, I think it's a combination of wondering what our families would think, worried about having to deal with negative comments and jokes, our jobs (in business), and finally ya I think she still thinks that it might be some closeted gay/trans tendencies (which is not at all the case).  It comes down to the fear of the unknown mostly and the inability to turn back. I.e. once someone sees you with mail polish, you can take it off, but you can't change the fact that they saw you wearing it and formed whatever impressions they did.   Yes, I agree with all the noble ""don't judge"" comments. O, myself try to be that way... But I think it's hard to expect that most people you meet in life (even those close to us) wouldn't judge a man for wearing nail polish."

I saw this pink one called LA Selfie by ORLY at Target and bought it on impulse. It was fun!  I did my toenails for the first time, too.

I hear Orly's and OPI's blacks are good too but I'm so happy with Sally Hansen's I haven't tried them.  Edit: I'm also definitely getting LA Selfie.

Lol  For me it's not a feminine thing, or a gay thing, or whatever, I just like the feeling and look of smooth nails, and I really like the color/art aspect of it too!   I'm glad to have found this subreddit, you guys seem really cool! I love that guys with colorful nails is starting to become more socially accepted!"

malepolish,3boszb,adej12345,13,Tue Jun 30 22:51:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds like an awful salon. Don't let it discourage you, there are better salons out there. Heck, I got a buddy in a real conservative town who gets his nails done at a salon that treats him like any other customer.  As for going viral, that isn't something to worry about. My buddy hasn't had issues with his nails in conservative west Texas, nor have in in the more liberal central Texas, so I don't think you have anything to fear there."
malepolish,3boszb,Zanorfgor,14,Wed Jul 1 01:03:02 2015 UTC,"The photo was clearly inappropriate and I wouldn't ever spend money again at a place where something like that happened. But I'd also try not to worry about it.  It's really hard to make your dreams real when you live in a world that doesn't support them. And it takes something special to make the kind of effort you did.  I think that the things you describe feeling are all reasonable responses to the things that happened. I sometimes feel terrified and judged when I have my nails done, but I also feel like myself. And that makes it with it for me."
malepolish,3boszb,ShadyBible,5,Tue Jun 30 23:58:53 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'm really sorry you went through that, that is extremely rude and strange of them. Some of those places are really bad, I am a female and many of nail salons make me uncomfortable. I have on several occasions had bitchy encounters with women who were clearly speaking about me in their language and even have gone as far as to say straight up rude/judgmental things (I have some weird toenails.. Learn the trade yourself, it has become a great hobby for me and the materials aren't too steep if you purchase on amazon. Keep your chin up, and I would seriously write them a bad review, how unprofessional. (Or go to a real salon like someone else mentioned in the thread)"
malepolish,3boszb,letshaveateaparty,3,Wed Jul 1 00:25:50 2015 UTC,"personally i wouldn't go to a nail mill.  most nail shops in strip malls are all the same.  the techs aren't licensed, little experience, dont make much money.  i prefer to go to a real salon or independent.  you will pay more but they can speak English, are generally friendly and make you feel comfortable.  since you got a acrylics what is the plan to remove them in a few days?  i thought they did some light drilling to get them to bond well."
malepolish,3boszb,stevie658,3,Tue Jun 30 23:56:05 2015 UTC,"Proper dehydration and nail priming can make the drilling/filing completely unnecessary, but places like this normally follow the old drilling techniques. He could remove them himself with a $2 bottle of 100% acetone and a glass bowl, but it's so time consuming to properly soak them off without someone filing off the excess length(the tip) and pushing the gooey acrylic off every 10 minutes for you. I'm an amateur nail tech and even I hate removing my own acrylics.   :l"
malepolish,3boszb,A_Sexy_Muffin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:20:13 2015 UTC,Sorry this happened! If you are still interested in having acrylics you can buy the stuff online and do them on yourself.
malepolish,3boszb,heartbeat123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:37:58 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that happened to you.  I'm female and I've had a bad experience at a salon like this as well.  I have a condition that makes my hands super sweaty, and I'm nervous about it when people touch my hands, which makes them sweat even more.  The whole time I was getting my nails done the lady was talking in another language to the other ladies and had a disgusted look on her face.  She made rude comments the whole time to me in English about how I needed to get surgery to fix my hands.    I think it's a relatively common experience in salons with foreign employees, that they talk about clients right in front of them, protected by the language barrier.  My advice is that  you not go back to that place, but don't be discouraged from trying again at another place.  Or, you could buy some fake nails and do them yourself :)  don't let the people make you feel bad about yourself.  They're the ignorant and rude ones...  Try not to care what they think, and do what makes you happy"

malepolish,3boszb,doddsykins,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:28:20 2015 UTC,It sucks you had a bad experience. My first acrylics were done in a small salon. I stopped in and spoke with her about how my nails break easy and I can't get them to grow out. Her english was good and she suggested acrylic. She chatted with me like any other client. I continued going back to her for the rebalancing(fills). It was always a relaxing experience. I no longer have acrylics. I bought an IDB gel kit from Sally's Beauty Supply that came with a DVD. I now do my own nails. I still go to this salon for a pedicure every three weeks. She also cuts and colors my hair. Find a small shop or someone that does it out of their house. Call and talk over the phone first and you can decide if they sound right.
malepolish,3boszb,GuyPolish,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:50:52 2015 UTC,"Dude, that royally sucks. Taking your picture was just unbelievably rude, let alone the staring and talking behind your back.

I suggest checking out some youtube tutorials and kind of mimic what they do.  the biggest problem I had with this pattern was that compared to others, the 'grooves' seemed to be so incredibly thin. so it was really easy to scrape all of the nail polish out of the stamp plate if you didn't do it quickly / with the right amount of pressure."

malepolish,39zpb1,PAULA_DEENS_WET_CUNT,3,Tue Jun 16 10:32:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you're planning to pay / what is accepted at the business.  If I'm paying by card I will remove it from my wallet in an easy to access area, if by cash I keep it stored away safety but easy access again."
malepolish,39zpb1,MissPicklesMeow,3,Tue Jun 16 03:23:24 2015 UTC,"As a girl who keeps a slim wallet in her back pocket... If I have to leave before they dry completely I just slide my wallet up by using my knuckle on the outside of my pocket, or am very careful to use only the pads of my fingers (like if you were leaving a perfect fingerprint on something, as flat as possible). Sometimes I take my card/cash out beforehand so I don't have to be super careful about getting it out of my wallet. But really they let you sit under the drying fan/lamp as long as you feel the need before you leave (they almost always have the drying spray as well), and it only takes a couple hours to be rock solid not just dry enough to do things with your fingers. I've seen others pay beforehand, though some salons don't want you to do that at all."
malepolish,39zpb1,squidofhearts,3,Tue Jun 16 03:27:49 2015 UTC,"Almost always, in my experience, they will ask you before they apply the polish if you want to pay. Just slide them your card or cash before they apply the first coat."

malepolish,393ldd,SexyPizzaChick,3,Tue Jun 9 00:38:03 2015 UTC,"Those colours are great! Just a quick question: are you using a base and top coat? That will greatly increase your wear time! And, if you don't find it too messy and time consuming (which I totally understand, lol) you might want to try wrapping your tips! Just in between coats of your colour, brush some polish along the tip of your fingernail. This seals it in and wraps your polish around the edge. Do it with your top coat as well. This way your polish doesn't have an edge to chip up from, and the tips won't wear off quite so quickly!"
malepolish,393ldd,jeffersonbible,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:30:42 2015 UTC,Yaaaay!  I used to put on fresh polish every day during exams and pick it off  while waiting and while I thought. Went through a lot of polish.

malepolish,36mir1,melody-lee,2,Wed May 20 14:17:40 2015 UTC,Also running your freshly dried mani under cold running water can help set the polish better.  I got that trick from /r/RedditLaqueristas :)
malepolish,36mir1,Byron-Blue,1 point,Wed May 20 17:03:53 2015 UTC,"Seche Vite Quick Dry top coat will save you so much time and trouble. If I do more than 2 coats of color over a base and don't top coat it...I will wake up the next day with scratches or like you say - I will do something and the top layer will dent or slide to the side like the first layer never dried. Some polishes I've had do tend to do this and I've stopped using them.  Through trial and error - it seems that if I don't wait a long time between 1st and 2nd coats...it holds better (like 2-3 minutes). Also don't put the color layers on too thick. I usually put the 2nd layer on thicker than the first.  To solve a ton of headaches and make your polish last - grab a bottle of Seche Vite quick dry top coat. After your 2nd coat of color (or 3rd if you really need it) wait 5 minutes and then put a thick coat of this top coat on. You can put this top coat on tacky, not yet dry nails. It hides some errors you might have had happen and it makes them totally even and shiny. Within 5 - 10 minutes of the top coat - it is dry and hard. (though you should still wait a bit to do anything rough with them) It dries fast - so you need to swipe it on decently quickly without brushing over it too many times or you will start seeing brush marks and get an uneven top coat."

malepolish,36fkaz,IAMADouchecunt,1 point,Tue May 19 00:15:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know that there are fake nails for men specifically, but I would strongly recommend looking at getting gel nails done. Find a salon that's going to put some thought into it, make sure that your real nails aren't just going to flake off (Wikipedia tells me that could be a problem for you), and then go for a natural look with a matte finish.   I'm no expert, and that's a solution off the top of my head. A good nail tech is an expert, so give them a try!"
malepolish,36fkaz,unmaned,1 point,Tue May 19 03:21:02 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree with the other poster and came here to suggest gel nails as well. Acrylic nails (the long claws you see many women wear) are thick, and very harsh on your nails. Women with normal nails have to deal with their nails flaking and peeling after removal, which often takes coarse files and acetone soaks.  Gel nails are something I just got into, I wanted to have pretty nails for my wedding, didn't want to do acrylics, and gel nails in a salon cost an arm an a leg. I looked up how to do it myself and bought everything I needed on ebay for $30.  They are very simple to do for yourself if you have a steady hand, or even better a friend to do it for you. For a natural looking color free nail you'll need:   UV gel polish Base & Top coat A Florescent UV gel curing lamp Nail buffing blocks Acetone nail polish remover (bought from any drug store, make sure it says ""acetone"" not ""acetone free"")   This is all you need to get started. First, wash your hands really well, gel polish is picky about oils on your skin or nails. Second, be prepared to take your time, like 45 minutes or more at first.  Use a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol and wipe your nails down. Then use the second side of the buffing block, the one like super fine grit sand paper, and use that to rough the surface of your nails gently. Just a little bit will do. Use alcohol and wipe them all down again.  Now take the bottle of base coat and apply one thin layer of polish to just your two thumb nails. Be very careful not to get any on the skin at the sides of your nails, as this will start the polish peeling. If you do get some on there, take acetone and wipe the nail and try again, if it's a tiny amount use a tooth pick to get it off before you cure.  Now take your two thumbs and put them under the light, use a stop watch or online timer to time it for two minutes. Remove your thumbs, the nail polish will be dry but have a layer of stickiness. Wipe with alcohol to get it off. Repeat on the rest of the nails on your left hand, then right hand. Polish, light for 2 mins, wipe.  Next repeat this process with the top coat. This coat you do thicker, and be amazed as you watch it settle into the grooves and waves of your nail, creating a smooth surface. Put them under the light to cure. After this layer, you're done, but if you want it to look the most natural, use the buffer block to buff the shine off the top coat and create a more matte look.  This will last 2-3 weeks. When it starts to peel, its time to soak it off. Wrap your nails in tin foil with a cotton ball soaked with acetone. Let it sit for 10 minutes and check it, the polish should be cracked and peeling off, help it along with a good scrub with a cotton balls and resoak if needed til its all off. Buff it smooth again and re apply the polish.  This will help your nails grow (mine peel and break just past my finger tips without the gel) by leaving a super thin layer each time you remove and reapply. It's super strong, but will (usually) break at the tip like a real nail instead of breaking off and traumatizing your nail bed like acrylic.  Hope this helps!"

Plus, once we're getting into the pillars of femininity, like cosmetics and dresses, it's not as if men have been waiting for the right marketing to use these products. It's deeper than that.

I only had time to do two nails, so I painted polka dots on the others.  Some things I learned from this experience: 1) toothpicks are harder to paint with than you might think. 2) Your nails must be completely dry before adding a top coat or you'll smear the colors together. Even if you think they're dry enough, they're probably not."

I like to do mine while I'm watching netflix, that makes it easier to sit and wait for them to dry :) Also, a fast-dry top coat (I use Seche Vite) can help - you can put it on when your polish is slightly tacky and it helps them to dry more quickly if you're a bit pressed for time.

I forgot about it & we all went out to dinner, and I got several compliments from the female staff.  ""Oh, really?""  I thought.  I decided to do a test & paint them all one color & wear it to work just to see what sort of reaction I would get.  For TWO solid months, maybe 4 people out of scores that I encountered said anything about it and it was never negative.  I decided to crank it up a notch and do some stripes, patterns, and recently marbling (which i've not quite perfected) and what has happened is that it draws attention and quite frequently someone will ask to see them or where I had them done.  I reply that I did it myself.  They ask if that is what I do, I reply ""No, but I DO fix computers here in town"".  That leads to a card being given out & money coming in.  Aside from that I like the colors.  Look at the birds, fish, the males in most species are brightly colored.  Why not you too?  You'll buy fancy shoes, wear fancy jewelry, spend money on an elaborate watch & haircut, get a fancy car but draw the line on a few drops of paint on your fingers? Sometimes I am a little self conscious about it, but the truth is no one will care as much as you think they will."

malepolish,32msch,manclaws,3,Wed Apr 15 12:07:24 2015 UTC,"I understand your concern - I've only recently been doing it openly on my fingers.  I started with my toes.  First, Rarely does any guy look at another guy's feet.  2nd.  Most people ignore it.  Society as a whole is becoming more accepting about alternate expression - but even given that for the past 2years I only did color on toes & clear on fingers.    Then it became color on weekends on fingers.  with me furiously stripping the polish off Monday 5 minutes before work.   One day I had finally had enough, and just walked out the door with polish on to work.  My boss saw it did a double take - visibly shrugged & nothing was said.    (Although I do have a somewhat unconventional appearance already) -- Long hair & earrings. It's been commented that I have a somewhat androgynous look right now.    Most people just ignore it.  there are a few whispers, & a little gossip about me.  When my friends are asked about it they simply respond with a ""Yeah he paints his nails -- so what?""  I imagine the gossip is mostly because it's New & novel in time that novelty will wear off & it'll just be something I do.    So yeah, it's tough to take that first step -- but don't worry, it's not a cliff.  & each step after gets easier.  p.s. -- Their acceptance will most likely mirror yours - don't hide it don't shy from it.  (When you're ready that is).  If you act natural, they'll act natural."
malepolish,32msch,WizardMelcar,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:34:12 2015 UTC,"Start with your close friend (females seem to be less judgmental on this) and with family....that way you can wear it much more often if you are around them a lot. Realllly...it shouldn't matter, if you think about it....then remind yourself again it doesn't matter...it is just color. Who cares what others think. Its your weekly expressive art!  After you get that in your mind enough...you will get more confident. It took me 45 years to realize that. I've had mine painted 24/7 since mid January. Work doesn't mind...family doesn't mind. I still haven't had a negative occurrence. I still do hide them a bit in public so I am not 100% confident but it increases day to day slowly. I wear them long too...which adds to society's judgement on me.  But I am so happy I decided to share it and wear it openly without having to take it off at night or at the end of the weekend."

malepolish,31zzzp,aidrocsid,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:00:49 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much exactly how to do marbling other than your fuck up with the middle finger, which I suspect was a product of trying to make it too clean. There are ways to make water marbling less messy, personally I've only used tape (which sucks), but elmer's glue is supposed to work and someone else suggested liquid latex, but who cares? Nobody can tell that your fingers got a bit messy after cleanup. Let them get messy, you can wash it right off. Make sure you trace your nail and cuticle with your little nail file  hook thingy, so it's not a continuous blob and will form nicely on the nail, but disregard everything around it until you're done. Once you've got your top coat on and it's good and dry, just wash your hands really thoroughly. Maybe scrape your fingers slightly while it's still wet, but the priority is getting the nail straightened out. I would not recommend water marbling if you don't have a few hours to hang around and not worry about how your fingers look.   As far as acetone goes, I personally never use it for cleanup. I just end up ruining nails and soap and water works fine."

malepolish,31tzgi,Svenian,2,Wed Apr 8 03:26:29 2015 UTC,"So this time, I actually took some advice. I spent a couple hours on making this look decent this morning and I believe it turned out semi-decent in most nails. I just wish the color would show more in these pictures!  I tried cleaning the edges up... and my hand. An immense love/hate relationship with glitter right now. Some of it was hard to get off though. Probably gonna try to OPI lacquer remover, as I believe /u/Azzura47 mentioned. But thank you to all the kind men and women who have been so supportive and helpful. So many to thank! Never really expected it, honestly. I am having a lot of fun though.  Once I go and buy some more nail polish, I can try to get a better look and try to take care of my fingers some more. And hopefully I can get into more advanced things like art and stuff.  Nail Polish used this time is Sally Hansen's Diamond Strength No Chip Nail Color - Pulled Sugar"

malepolish,31p5oq,nishidake,2,Tue Apr 7 01:34:09 2015 UTC,"I recently picked this one up. It's part of the new Wet 'n' Wild Wild Shine line and it's called Ready to Propose.  It's a nice, warm gold. Not a foil, I would say more of a frosty metallic. The formula and pigment are really similar to W'n'W Metallica, which is like this, but silver.   I've seen swatches of this online where it makes some people look sallow and some look ruddy, so I was hesitant to try it. There's an interesting undertone to this polish where it has some red and blue to it and I think it really only works on neutral skintones, but YMMV. Anyway, I think it's a great metallic, and if those are your thing, you should check it out!"
malepolish,31p5oq,oph1uchus,2,Tue Apr 7 01:40:49 2015 UTC,"just a heads up on these new Wet and Wild bottles- if you put the cap on just a bit too tight, the whole bottle will shatter.  granted it stayed together long enough for me to pour most of the polish into another empty bottle, it was still a pain in my butt.   i really like this gold btw. :)"

malepolish,31kxih,Svenian,2,Mon Apr 6 01:41:05 2015 UTC,"Everyone else already gave you great tips, I just wanted to compliment your choice of pink.  Looks great on you.  Also protip/hack you can apply a layer of elmers glue around the outside of your finger/cuticle up to the nail. Let it dry, then when you are done you just peal it away (catches the overflow of polish). Then clean it up as others have said with a small brush and some acetone. Super super easy. Lots of tutorials of this/and or liquid latex on youtube."
malepolish,31kxih,MadameInternet,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:36:47 2015 UTC,"File them down so the polish has something to stick to. Also, use a clear top coat. Pink is nice!"
malepolish,31kxih,wellrelaxed,2,Mon Apr 6 03:05:24 2015 UTC,Don't file the surface - that just makes your nails thinner and will cause them to break when they grow out. Base coat is specifically designed to grip and stick to your nail much better than polish alone. Buffing is ok if you see a bunch of ridges...but try not to remove too much of your nail layers.
malepolish,31kxih,Azzura47,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:23:03 2015 UTC,Got it! I'll see if I ever have more time to do some serious work with my nails. Thank you!
malepolish,31kxih,NuclearQueen,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:25:23 2015 UTC,"Base coat, honey. It's all about your foundation. Use more polish with each coat, as well, to get better coverage and no streaking. Bring the polish all the way out to the end of the nail, and paint the paper-thin edge, it helps stop chipping. File your nails to smooth edges, it makes a huge difference. Clear top coat is also important, and you really want to COAT the nail. A good manicure should take like 3 hours to totally dry, that's how much polish you want to be using. If you're going for a pastel look and don't like how dark two coats is, paint your nails white first, then put on a single coat of your color once your nails are dry.   If you can't seem to get the base coat to stay nice for more than a day, use a buffer and stop after stage 2. The surface of your nails will be really rough and will help the paint stick.  Nails look best when they're longer than they are wide, and you're pretty close. Always have some tip to them (the white part) unless you've just trimmed off a bad hang nail.   What color is that, by the way? I love that it's the exact color as the starburst!  Edited for clarity."
malepolish,31kxih,NuclearQueen,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:38:19 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness! You are amazing! Now I just need 3 hours to myself!  I've learned a lot in the past hour, and it has been so amazing. I'll see what I can do now that I kinda know what I'm supposed to be doing, at least!  I was going for more of a pastel, which I think does look amazing! I borrowed the color from someone, so I'll try my best to track it down for you! It is just a wonderful color! It being the same color as the starburst was just a coincidence though, I do think it fits though! (I just wanted to grab something to take place of a nail polish bottle I didn't have)  I guess I'll just work on my technique before I really work on presentation. I see that some people don't include a tip to their work, and I am not sure where to start if I did want to do that. I still need a lot more work, as you can see! Thank you so much however!"

For decals I use a regular cheap drug store topcoat. Seche Vite is not good for decals. I let them dry pretty good before trying to peel them off the mat(hours not days). I like decals because you can make them ahead of time for a special occasion. The mickey mouses were made months ago. I have done them for my daughter to use later."

malepolish,2zbauc,nishidake,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:48:47 2015 UTC,"It is if you've broken the biting habit, or if that mani will remind you not to bite. Even if you don't get color, having your cuticles seen to and having everything filed and buffed would probably feel great. This is, of course, something you can do at home if you want to save some money. Either way, it's a good idea is to start re-habbing your nails with regular applications of a cuticle oil/balm, and if you're still biting, a nail strengthener with a bittering agent added.   Taking care of your hands and biting less is a virtuous circle, so don't give up!"
malepolish,2zbauc,JakeRaderick,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:51:30 2015 UTC,"Another advantage of the manicure is that they will clean and smooth your nail beds, and cleanup your cuticles.  If you pay attention, you may even learn a few things about taking better care of your nails. And, of course, the gel polish will tend to discourage you from biting them because it's tough - like the paint on your car - it won't just flake off!  Besides, you may find that you really like the way they look and that might help you to let them grow out a bit. I highly recommend trying it - you'll love how gel makes your nails look!!"

malepolish,2yzvbb,unmaned,3,Mon Mar 16 04:12:47 2015 UTC,"Boise, huh? Well, it could be worse. I'd say go for it. Do your toenails however you want, and if your parents notice, don't make a big deal of it. Clear matte on your fingernails if you want to get away with it, gloss if you want to look like you're trying to get away with something, black if you want them to think you're just going through a goth phase, pink if you're an absolute stud.  The real trick to telling parents, if you think they're not going to absolutely freak out, is to have perfect confidence that you're not doing anything wrong. (If they are going to freak out, wait until you can support yourself.) It's only a big deal if someone makes it a big deal, and that someone is not going to be you. If they have a problem with it, then they have a problem, not you. You're young, you're experimenting with your gender to see what happens, it doesn't mean they've failed as a parent or that you've got a sugar daddy. Don't be snotty or teen-supercilious about it, don't go up and say ""Mom, Dad, I want to have a Serious Emotions Talk about painting my nails;"" just be chill.   Also: pics or it didn't happen."

What I've found out, for me, is hardly anyone cares at all.  My mom asked why (when she saw it on FB) and I said 'because I like the colors'.  That pretty much ended it.  An idea for OP would be to paint ONE nail.  If parents overreact, tell them it was a joke or a prank.  That way at least it's out in the open.  It's just a drop of paint."
malepolish,2yzvbb,MadameInternet,2,Tue Mar 17 03:09:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with someone else' advice here.  Paint 1, see if they notice, see how they react. You can always play one off of a joke/bet/prank/etc.  Now that being said I highly encourage everyone to be WHO THEY ARE TRULY. So if it was me I would just paint my nails, but I understand all familiar dynamics are different.   goodluck! Do what feels right!"

My mom of course thought I was kidding but then she gave in. We now talk colors and other stuff very freely. My dad thinks I should use clear and skip the color. He feels men should only do things like that in private because life is hard enough without drawing attention to our ""strangeness."" I kid around and ask him what color I should wear if I know we are going out...and of course he picks clear (but I don't listen)  He accepts it and doesn't give me that fatherly look...it took 2 or 3 times seeing it for him to not care. They had no clue I had been doing it since I was like 10 yrs old or so. My son doesn't mind at all. Sister and her husband didn't even blink - boss and the girls where I work didn't mind at all...one guy seemed a bit stunned at first but doesn't mind.  I still get a bit nervous checking out at a store and sort of hide them still...drive thrus are fun to watch the cashiers reactions when exchanging money and grabbing your drink. I have not had any negative run ins yet. A few compliments.

malepolish,2ygafa,SageTX,2,Mon Mar 9 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"For me, it's not the topcoat that's the problem.  It's the base coat and the raw nail strength that's the problem.  If the nail and base coat are weak, then the upper layers wind up being harder, and will shear away from the nail, causing chips.  Once I started using a hardening base coat, my polish lasted a heck of a lot longer.  I also stopped using Sally Hansen stuff, just... too low a quality and strength for me.  I can't remember my current though."
malepolish,2ygafa,unixbeardxd,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:59:03 2015 UTC,People place too much importance on top coat (myself included in past). Base coat makes the biggest difference in my experience. I have hard nails and use ORLY bonder. A hardening formula is important for soft nails.
malepolish,2ygafa,litui,3,Fri Mar 13 07:33:56 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people swear by Seche Vite, but I haven't tried it, being as it doesn't play nicely with 3-free and 5-free polishes, which all of mine are. I've heard there is a version that doesn't contain toluene and formaldehyde, but I've never encountered it.  What I do use is NYC Grand Central Station. It's not even a technically a topcoat, but it seals your nails with a plastic like finish that is long-wearing, very shiny, and very chip resistant. It's 3-free and it doesn't shrink your polish. G from Nouveau Cheap calls it her holy grail topcoat. Bonus: it's only $2 regular price and I stock up during bogo sales!"
malepolish,2ygafa,nishidake,2,Wed Mar 11 04:43:49 2015 UTC,"After trying several topcoats, I'm currently using Essie good to go. Not only does it create an amazing shine and has a wide brush, it also dries in a minute, which is great for people like me who tend to mess up everything because, well, impatience. ;) No chipping for days now. :)   Also Seche Vite top coats are getting great reviews everywhere, but I haven't tried them personally yet.   Aside from brands, I get less chipping if I also apply a little basecoat, paint and topcoat to the front of the nail."

But I found that the paint easily comes off when the skin gets wet for a few minutes. My other nails are about 5mm longer than the fingertip, no problem there. I think it looks better when the nails are not too short, but it takes some time to get used to it and of course it depends on what you ned your hands for.

malepolish,2ygafa,Joanno77,1 point,Tue Mar 10 11:47:23 2015 UTC,"If your nails have any length at all, ""wrapping"" the tips with base and topcoat really helps. Another good reason to let your nails grow, not long necessarily, but to a healthy length!"
malepolish,2ygafa,nishidake,2,Wed Mar 11 04:46:15 2015 UTC,"Those Sally Hansen miracle gel polishes that don't require setting with a light have a really good topcoat. I've heard that it's the topcoat that makes them last so long rather than the polish itself. The only problem is it picks up a bit of the color from regular nail polish, so I've been using a quick dry topcoat followed by the gel one and it's worked really well, when normally I get chips within the first 48 hours of painting my nails."

I just figure they weren't the ones who painted them and it's not a thing they're into. Other times I get the feeling that some men don't want to talk about it or that they will feel self conscious if I mention it. If I keep looking at their nails and smiling and they refuse to make eye contact, well...   So I guess my answer would be to smile and make eye contact with more people in general, especially if you see them noticing your nails. If you seem friendly, people will take it as an invitation to talk to you. If you ignore people around you, or seem absorbed in your own thing, people will assume you don't want to be bothered."

I don't comment because I don't get super excited about that. It doesn't tell me that they're 'into' nail polish. I would probably be more stoked if I were also male. The same goes for women. If the polish is an afterthought, I don't comment. If it looks like they're a laquer enthusiast I'm more likely to strike up a conversation. Sometimes I see a proper mani on a guy, in which case I usually comment. Once though, I saw a guy on the train wearing what looked like Sally Hansen Pixel Perfect over a very bright blue. It was obviously intentional and I wanted to ask him about the topper he was wearing.

And while positive reactions far outstrip negative reactions, I have had the latter. But only 2 in 2 years, which really isn't a lot.

malepolish,2xwph1,SageTX,4,Wed Mar 4 16:19:07 2015 UTC,"My reason for painting is that I feel I have been jilted in being lead to believe nail polish is for women only.  I'm married (10 years, 4 kids) and do it because I like pretty colors.  Who doesn't?  What are your reasons for painting?  Has anyone ever acted offended because of it?"
malepolish,2xwph1,LukeWarm92,5,Wed Mar 4 14:24:29 2015 UTC,"I do it because it makes me happy, simple as that. When I look down and see that flash of colour, it makes me feel good and I think it looks good."
malepolish,2xwph1,WizardMelcar,2,Wed Mar 4 19:54:05 2015 UTC,"My reasons:  1) I think I'm a little genderqueer -- What that means exactly, I'm still trying to figure out, for me starting to paint my toenails was a part of my coming out for that - and trying to explain to my wife, what exactly I was going through.  (We are seperated/ getting divorced) in a large part because of that.  2) I like pretty colors too.  3) I'm just trying to be my own unique little snowflake - just like everybody else.  As for Offended?  Only comments I've ever had have been positive.  Most people ignore it.  Some I think don't even see it, because they don't expect to see it so it just gets over looked.  Others, simply do a double take - then just shrug it off & we continue discussing whatever we were discussing before it was noticed."
malepolish,2xwph1,WizardMelcar,2,Thu Mar 5 17:14:32 2015 UTC,"IDK what genderqueer means either.  I just started wearing the polish, I'd BEEN wearing a few pairs of my wife's jeans just because my ass looks absolutely amazing in them.  Guyliner on the weekends as well.  I can't wait for sandal weather, I'll break out the grinder & make these misshapen hunks of keratin into vague toenail shapes & glitter paint the heck out of them.  We have a 9 yr old son who INSISTS on painting his nails, he does NOT give a crap what anyone thinks, and if left to his own devices he WILL go full drag makeup...which is fine, we don't care as long as he's happy...but he's going to have to wait til he's an adult to go OUT like that.  Coming out?  What?  One of my business neighbors (I'm self employed) had a few smart things to say about it, but I shot him down & now he won't even touch the subject anymore."
malepolish,2xwph1,WizardMelcar,3,Thu Mar 5 18:35:24 2015 UTC,"Well for me personally.  My wife said I started to feel like a ""Best girlfriend"" to her as opposed to a husband.  Before I met her, I hung out with a group of ladies, who basically treated me as one of them, I was invited to the ""girls nights"" out, and things of that nature.  So after years of repressing and trying to bury that part of my nature - I'm exploring that, and having fun with it.  The nail polish is a part of that, an exploration of self."
malepolish,2xwph1,litui,3,Fri Mar 6 04:44:59 2015 UTC,"and actually come to think of it I do recall an incident a few years ago;  It was a kid, 12-15 male;    I had been walking my dog in the park, had flip flops on, it being summer;  Dog is a ""German Shepard Mutt"", he's got the Shepard coloring & body, his head is more like a lab (big floppy ears).  Anyways this group of boys sees me walking the dog - call to me ask if they can pet him, he's super friendly, so I say sure & walk him over.  They're petting him and chatting with me for several minutes when 1 finally noticed the polish on my toes.    Asked why I had polish on my toes.  I responded with ""it's just something I like to do for fun from time to time"";   One of the other boys spoke up with a Yeah, I do that occasionally too.  The original who spotted the toes at that point said ""ugh - get away from me man"".  I just shrugged & went back to my walk."
malepolish,2xwph1,man-polish,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:01:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you've been through the back stories in the sidebar but, long story short. I realized I loved the look of polish and the act of application, and realized it was bullshit social stigma holding me back from being the person I wanted to be and expressing what I had to express. I started this subreddit to help myself and others.   While it's certainly not the case for everyone, along the way I discovered that I was actually denying deep truths I knew about myself and had been suffering for it. Nail polish helped me to come to terms with being a woman (though it's certainly not gendered in itself or a requirement of womanhood) and I eventually transitioned. I've been living life as a woman for over a year now.   I don't post anymore, just upvote, comment, mod a bit, and support everyone in expressing themselves to the fullest, whoever they may be and whatever their journey.   Edit: and only one person ever acted like a dick about my nails when I presented ""as a man"". He was a close friend and it hurt a lot, but I think he got over it, and I got enough support and praise from others it didn't hold me back."
malepolish,2xwph1,GuyPolish,5,Fri Mar 13 07:09:55 2015 UTC,I paint my nails because I like the contrast colors bring to my hands; plus every life needs a little color to brighten it up.
malepolish,2xwph1,nishidake,5,Wed Mar 4 16:44:09 2015 UTC,I have been confused about liking polish and womens things since I was a kid. How could I like these things and not be gay. It took me another 40 years to realize that there is nothing wrong with liking pretty nails on women or myself. I look down at my nails and see neon green or pink and smile. It makes me happy and that is what counts. Polish makeup or clothing choice should be gender neutral. We should all be able to pick and choose what we like.
malepolish,2xwph1,collapsibletank,3,Sat Mar 7 22:02:55 2015 UTC,"I polish because I love color. Because I can do it my own way, with my own style. Because nail polish is an ideal accessory to a capsule wardrobe. Because I enjoy the mindful ritual of prepping and painting. Because it protects my nails and makes them less sharp.  Because it's an activity I can share with my partner. Because it makes me feel more put together/fancy/pretty/badass/whatever I want to portray that week. Because my color choice can reflect/affect my mood. Most of all because it's fun."

malepolish,2xujkf,nishidake,4,Wed Mar 4 00:02:07 2015 UTC,"Here's a new color for you lads! Allow me to introduce the respectable Earl Gray! Can you tell I think it should be the English spelling; grey? :D  I picked up a bunch of Sally Hansen Complete Salon Manicure polishes on clearance last week and this warm, light gray was the first one I tried. I think it's pretty similar to Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear in Wet Cement.  I liked this color much more than I thought I would. It had the subtlety and class of wearing a nude, but without the delicate feeling of some pinks and sheers. I'll probably wear it again soon.  SH CSM makes a lot of claims about the 7-in-1 benefits of these polishes (give it a quick Google), but basically, you're supposed to be able to get 10 days of wear out of these polishes without a base or top coat.   I don't know about that, but these pictures are after 6 days of wear with only a topcoat. In an average week I do housework, commute by light rail and bicycle, type, and play fingerstyle guitar. What finally started to chip it was playing tug-o-war with a mouthy dog. I'm pretty impressed.   I wouldn't wear it without a basecoat regularly, mostly because my natural nail ridges were more than the topcoat alone could fix, but it's definitely a polish that you could throw on two coats with nothing else and head out the door, which I did earlier this week, no problems. These polishes also dry quickly, come in a 14.7 ml bottle and are 5-free, so they have some nice things going for them. I'll share some more of the colors I got from this line as I try them."

She was doing her nails for an event once and asked if I'd let her paint mine. I said yes, and she added that I probably wouldn't be able to do it on my own anyway because it was harder than it looked. Well, of course, with a challenge issued, I announced that I would do my own nails, much to her skepticism. About an hour and some water decals later, I had  a perfect manicure depicting twilight settling over a city skyline. Amazed, she asked me how I had pulled off such work on my first try.

malepolish,2x62cb,thefucksgoingon,2,Wed Feb 25 23:07:38 2015 UTC,"You should use Sally Hanson cuticle remover and an orange stick. Be careful with this stuff, it's not gentle.   Apply it on your nails along the cuticle where the dry skin is. Let it sit for at least a minute (do one hand at a time). GENTLY (stop if it hurts!) scrape away the now softened dead skin with the flat end of the orange stick. Rinse and use a nail brush under warm water. Repeat on your other hand. Don't use this more than once a week."

malepolish,2x62cb,A_Sexy_Muffin,1 point,Thu Feb 26 00:15:18 2015 UTC,"If you're just venturing into cuticle management, it's helpful to understand that the living tissue surrounding your nail is not cuticle and should never be cut. Your cuticle is a protective layer of dead skin that grows out over your nail plate and seals dirt and bacteria out of your nail bed. So you don't want to fully remove it, just tidy it up a bit and free up some real estate for polish. Soften your cuticles by soaking fingers in warm water and then gently push them back with an orange stick. Personally, I don't use cuticle remover or nip any dead skin unless there's a lot of excess, and I always proceed with caution. Regularly pushing cuticles back seems to discourage them from growing halfway up your nail, and they settle into a tighter growth pattern around the base, so maintenance gets easier over time. Cuticle removers and nippers are handy when there is excess dead cuticle that's all snaggled and raggedy, but otherwise, gentle, regular pushing is usually enough. Once you start painting, it pays to learn how to do a neat paint job that doesn't touch your cuticles. You can be gentler to them and they stay smoother when you're not scrubbing glitter polish off of them! Finally, moisturize, moisturize, moisturize! I swear by Burt's Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Balm. Staying hydrated helps too.  These links might help:   6 Ways to Care for Your Cuticles  THE GREAT CUTICLE DEBATE: TO CUT OR NOT TO CUT?  What are my cuticles and how do I tame them?"

I don't mind shelling out a few quid if the product is worth it, but I am kinda poor so I want to make sure I'm getting my money's worth :)"

My mom has been using it(ignoring those directions...) and applying it every day for over a month and the bottle doesn't look like it has lost much product at all. I'd say a bottle would easily last 4+ months. People who have reviewed it are normally those that have worn acrylic nails for a very, very long time and are left with incredibly thin nails. Some of them say that after 4 months their nails are healthy and SUPER strong to where thy don't even need nail envy anymore. I'm 90% sure that it has lasting effects, but you could shoot OPI's customer service email a question or ask someone who has used it more than I have. c:"

malepolish,2wxpmi,derpderper,6,Tue Feb 24 01:00:25 2015 UTC,"Number 1 - Use a base coat. Colors (especially cheap colors) will stain your nails.  Number 2 - Use one of those nail tools to make sure your cuticle is free of polish. (If you're not sure how it's done, get a professional manicure at a reputable place, they will do it and probably answer any questions you have. Totally worth the $$)  Number 3 - Avoid anything with any kind of glitter/matte. (Matte is probably safer, but not always...)   Number 4 - Get up a little early and soak your nails in plenty of remover. Should come right off!"
malepolish,2wxpmi,mr_mrs,5,Tue Feb 24 02:46:11 2015 UTC,"Female here, but I hope you still find my advice useful.   I use the cotton ball method to remove polish without staining my cuticle. The secret is to unroll the cotton ball until it's a single layer. Divide it up into 10 little pieces. Dip each piece until it's soaked in acetone, then lay it flat to cover your whole nail. Don't touch it until you've done five fingers on one hand and waited at least one minute (it should feel really cold). Then firmly wipe the cotton and polish off in one go, from the cuticle to the end of your nail. Don't reuse this piece of cotton to go back and get missed spots, just get it all in one swipe, and use clean cotton to get missed spots. Doing this prevents polishes from getting all over your cuticle.   Glitters are tougher. Some people use a variation on the cotton technique, which is the foil method, where you soak small bits of cotton in acetone, the wrap your fingers in individual pieces of foil. This lets you soak the polish off for longer, but it's extremely drying on your nails (even more so than the first technique).  I would recommend when you use a glitter polish to use a peel-off base coat (look on Amazon) when you apply the polish, and an orange stick when you remove it. There are tutorial videos online for how to do this and reviews of different brands. I've tried Elmer's glue, but it didn't work at all for me. Maybe it will for you.  Good luck!"
malepolish,2wxpmi,lizzyshoe,2,Tue Feb 24 06:41:26 2015 UTC,"Ooh I thought Id gotten pretty fast at removing, but the unrolling a cotton ball sounds pro, i'll try that tomorrow. I'm also gonna give the elmers a shot and will look into a peel off base coat if that doesn't work."
malepolish,2wxpmi,lrhoades1,1 point,Tue Feb 24 17:23:08 2015 UTC,I think its about time for my next manicure anyways :) thanks for the tips
malepolish,2wxpmi,MissPicklesMeow,4,Tue Feb 24 17:24:30 2015 UTC,"For glitter polish removal, I use the foil method:  You'll need: -pieces of cotton (cotton pads, cotton balls, whatever). You'll want them to be about the size of your nail, a little larger. Shape isn't super important, you can tear off pieces or cut em, whatever.  - acetone - tin foil. Tear or cut off pieces about 3""x3"". One piece for each nail   Take a piece of cotton and soak it in acetone. Set it gently on the nail, make sure it's covering all of the polish.  Take foil piece and wrap it all around your finger tip. Tighten it so its secure but not so you squeeze out all the acetone.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all nails.  Let sit for 5-10 minutes. You'll have silver bulb fingers and be less dextrous for a while, but when you paint your nails you're used it, right.   Remove the foil and cotton pads together by firmly gripping and twisting as you pull. Repeat for each nail.  Go back with cotton and acetone to clean up anything you missed.    Not always 100% effective but it cuts the work down immensely.   Also, for preventative measures, consider glue-based peel off base coat."
malepolish,2wxpmi,chalkchick0,4,Tue Feb 24 03:48:27 2015 UTC,A thin coat of Elmer's glue underneath really helps it peel up quickly.

malepolish,2wxpmi,nishidake,2,Tue Feb 24 08:13:22 2015 UTC,"Forever this. This is the answer.  Get one of these, and only wear glitter with a peel-off base coat/white glue base. Or just start quietly wearing polish to work. Sorry to burst your bubble, but other people are not keenly watching your fingernails like you think they are, and when they do notice, it's unlikely to be the bombshell you imagine. Folks are just not as interested in you as you think! :D"
malepolish,2wxpmi,manclaws,2,Tue Feb 24 10:35:41 2015 UTC,thank you! this is what i'm looking for..have you used it? does it dry out the skin or anything?
malepolish,2wxpmi,manclaws,1 point,Tue Feb 24 17:12:49 2015 UTC,"Sadly, an acetone remover will dry your nails and cuticles some no matter how it's applied. Non-acetone is less drying, but takes longer to remove polish, especially stubborn glitters and foils. I use acetone and follow up with Burt's Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream."
malepolish,2wxpmi,stevie658,2,Wed Feb 25 01:21:05 2015 UTC,"Haha I totally know, people aren't noticing the random colors that are always at the base (I don't stare at other peoples cuticles generally). I guess I use my hands to show people car parts and small mechanical devices and I would be self conscious of the glossy effect which is apparent when people are looking at your hands. You know, it probably wouldn't be the bombshell I imagine I just sort of don't want to go there fearing it affecting how I get along with my coworkers. Maybe something matte and subtle...but I like the blues and pinks better anyways"
malepolish,2wxpmi,JamieRG,1 point,Tue Feb 24 17:18:13 2015 UTC,"In that case, people might notice in a good way!

You don't mention the nail polish at all. The post is even titled to reflect the focus on your legs. The comments above also veer into a clearly sexual discussion about your underwear and who might appreciate sexual contact with you. This is all fine. Well and good. And yes, this sub does encourage discussion of nail polish as it relates to gender expression. I happen to enjoy such discussion and although I'm one of the few female posters here, I even recently posted an article by a man discussing exactly such issues, not to give my opinion on it, but to share it with the lacqueristos here and simply be informed by their deconstruction of their experiences. Your post is obviously not such a discussion. As a queer person and trans ally myself, I say be as queer and trans positive as you want! There are tons of subreddits for that! But posts here that have little or nothing to do with nail lacquer simply dilute the focus and post quality of this sub. I hope that makes my previous comment more clear!"

I see nothing wrong with your post aside from categorization. It makes as much sense to post that here as it does to post about your interest in pony play with pictures of you in a saddle to a forum about horse tack. I, and likely others, would also disagree with you that men wearing nail polish is all about the sexual thrill of gender deviancy. That's an extremely broad assumption to make about the sexuality of those who post here. That may be what nail polish is about for you, but there are plenty of posters here who seem to simply like the way it looks, or to enjoy the process of painting, or who like sharing polish with their wives and daughters, or a myriad of other reasons.

malepolish,2vyk8n,Joanno77,3,Sun Feb 15 09:42:52 2015 UTC,"For the weekend I tried Jordana mardi gras - a really cool dark, slightly sparkling purple going to black in low light. Please excuse the far from perfect paint work. The paint looks marvellous but is a hell to handle. A small brush, streaky for the first layer and thin enough to run into your cuticles in no time. It took me about two hours for both hands (including cuticle treatment, base coat, top coat and cleanup)."
malepolish,2vyk8n,collapsibletank,2,Sun Feb 15 09:55:33 2015 UTC,Great colour and great application too. I don't know what you are talking about!

malepolish,2vxp5v,NuclearQueen,1 point,Sun Feb 15 09:17:21 2015 UTC,"I really like the metallic effect of your paint. :)  For the bubbles: Usually I get them when I:   apply too much paint in one coat. apply another coat before the first one had enough time to dry. try to speed up drying by blowing on the paint.   In those cases the surface dries faster than the paint below which can result in bubbles, but this depends a lot on the formula too.   Streaks seam to be a result from not using enough paint, when the paint can't flow to an even surface. It usually happens with older, thickened paint. Some paint thinner would do the trick then (don't use paint remover for it!)."

But thanks for the tips -- Thinner coats, let them dry longer in between -- That is probably where I'm going wrong.    This was one of the first polishes I bought for myself too - the very first time I did my nails was with one of my wife's pink on my toes.  Decided it was kind of fun, & started my own polish collection.  Also big step for me,  I left the polish on my nails when I went to work this morning.  So far nobody has even noticed.  I'm sure I will get some comments at some point -   I have worn polish openly around town - but this is my first time wearing it openly at work."

I'm doing my nails for just two weeks now. Color is Essie cocktail bling, which I was wearing for a whole week at the office. I thought a more decent color would not attract to much attention. Funny enough I didn't get any comments, neither negative nor positive. But that may also be due to the fact that they are already used to weird things with me as I'm also a fulltime barefooter. Most people seem to start painting their toe nails first because they can easily be hidden. Obviously that was not an option for me. ;) But I'm wearing clear polish on my toes always. For some reason I like the more natural look with my feet."

""Gender expression"" (that is, how you externalize your gender) is only given definition by our culture and the people in it (including you). It only has as much to do with gender and sexuality as you and others in your society ascribe to it.   If you believe it helps you express some aspect of your identity that was previously repressed, that's great! If you just like the aesthetic or act and it has no gender significance for you, that's also great! If you enjoy it as a form of statement or rebellion, also great!   As for crossdressing, it's only crossdressing if you view nail polish as inherently part of the expression of another gender. In my view if men put polish on their fingernails it becomes as much their gender's activity or expression as any other gender's. Nail polish belongs to you now and all men. Go forth, lacqueristo and be fabulous.   (full disclosure: some of us do realize through challenging restrictive gender norms that we aren't cis. Transgender woman here)"

I identified with much of what you said, wherein I don't think of myself a crossdresser, even though I (choose to) retain very little body hair, like to wear tights/pantyhose, and enjoy painting my nails (even though my wife absolutely hates when I do it).    I do like the way my nails look when painted, especially my toes.  I also do enjoy displaying some unique-ness in my appearance; always have, even early in life.  I was the first guy in my small town (in the 80's) to get a perm; the guy in highschool who wore his shirt a little different than anyone else, and who had a retro (50's) haircut (had lost the perm by then).  I didn't do those things to get attention, but did them because I (emphasis on I) liked the way they looked at that time.  Because those ""styles"" weren't considered overtly feminine, I was able to ""get away with it"", with very little ribbing from my peers.  But now, the things I like are considered (strictly) feminine territory for most of my peers, and I have to deal with the repercussions of that perception."

I love nail polish and have always looked at womens manicures and pedicures. I have always been jealous of how much freedom women have with altering their appearance to fit their mood or adopt a whole different persona. I have no desire to be a women, but I feel men should have the same fashion freedom women enjoy. I openly wear polish 24/7 365 days a year. I now wear any color that strikes my fancy. I wish it didn't take until I was 50 to realize it is my life and I should dress to make myself happy, not others. There is nothing wrong with you, it is society that needs to be less uptight."

You know, you would have more polish canvas to work with if your nails were a bit longer. It looks like you're cutting them too short, actually, which can cause painful ingrown nails or even lead to nail bed infections. This is an example of how to cut your nails to keep them healthy. Keep having fun with polish!"

Long nails freak me out a bit too. I think they're kind of gross, and I hate it if mine get long enough to catch dirt. I keep my nails short enough that they extend to my finger tip but never beyond. They're out of the way, but just long enough that I can use them to open a pocket knife or crack a beer can. I use clippers rarely and sparingly. Instead, I keep my length dialed in by gently filing them before I polish. Get yourself a multi-grit file meant for shaping your nails and try using that instead of clipping. That way you can never go to short!  I look forward to seeing your future polishes, especially as your nails grow. :)"

Penny Talk by Essie - Nice shiny copper with very few brush strokes, and stays super shiny. Edie by Color Club - I love a bright kelly green, especially since I wear so much of it. British Racing Green from Butter London - If you can paint nice straight lines, this deep green is stunning. 914 from Ozotic - This is a deep blue scatter-holo polish that looks like stars in the sky. Breath-taking! The It Color by OPI - I doubt a bright yellow will make it to the top of most people's favorites, but I really enjoy it AND I look damn good in yellow."

I have to go buy Penny Talk, now, geez... I love that you rock that crazy bright yellow. I think yellow is on it's way, WnW's new line has a yellow creme in it this year called Do'h!"
malepolish,2vj0yr,collapsibletank,2,Thu Feb 12 09:57:10 2015 UTC,"Right now, my top polishes five are:  5. Sally Hansen Diamond Strength in Black Tie This is a very dark, black-based multichrome with predominantly purple shimmer that gives way to green and then blue. It's rich and complex while still being subtle enough that it deserves it's classy name. So much more fun than plain black and the formula applies really well. This is a new favorite that just fired basic black for me.  4. Sinful Colors in Amethyst I love purple. It's a primary color in my wardrobe. The only creme to sneak into my top five, this shade is a classic, grape-y purple that reminds me of Grape Vines and grape Bubble Yum. It looks lovely and downright royal in matte, and it's bright enough wear in summer and cool enough to wear in winter. This is a definite purple-lover's shade, and it always gets attention.  3. Wet 'n' Wild Wild Shine in Metallica This looks like a basic, metallic silver, but really, it's so much more. I'm so glad that this one made it back into WnW's re-vamped 2015 Wild Shine line. Smooth formula and full coverage in two coats. The best part is the finish: it looks near-chrome with a gloss topcoat and like brushed steel with a matte topcoat. There's something about its industrial, nails-dipped-in-metal look that I love and I keep coming back to it. It looks super hot paired with matte black polish.  2. Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear in Coin Flip Coin Flip, true to it's name, is a metallic foil containing gold, copper, silver, and bronze. I love, love, love this shade so much. It's so versatile and interesting, and it flatters every skin tone. It goes from classy and dressy, to casual, to edgy, to conservative with ease. It's incredibly elegant and unique topped off in matte and it's an easy color to rock year-round. This polish made me totally reevaluate my opinion of metallics (spoiler alert: I love them now!).  1. Sinful Colors in Secret Admirer A black jelly base packed from wall-to-wall with fine silver shimmer. With a matte topcoat it looks like graphite on the nail and it's absolutely delicious. A versatile shade that dresses up and down with equal aplomb, it always says, ""I am cooler than a leather tuxedo. I am a badass, and a part-time secret agent/rock star. Did I mention my motorcycle is parked right outside?"" The best part is the formula. It's applies super smooth and is opaque in one coat for when you need to be awesome in a hurry. Boom. If I lost all my polish in a fire, I would replace this first.  Honorable mentions:  Wet 'n' Wild Wild Shine Matte Topcoat for mattify-ing all the things! A true matte, not waxy or satiny, with a matte finish almost as matte as Butter London and OPI, but for a humble 99 cents. The bottom of the bottle can get a little thick, but it's unrivaled at its price. Buy this and don't look back if you go through a lot of matte topcoat.  NYC In a New York Minute Quick Dry Nail Polish in Grand Central Station because, holy crap, it's amazing. Very quick drying and lots of shine, but the best part is the formula. It's incredibly durable and dries to a smooth, glassy, almost plastic-like finish that seals your manicure up like bulletproof shrinkwrap. Glitter? Just try to chip it. Gems or studs? Those babies are going NOWHERE. Under a matte topcoat? Lasts until you get tired of the color. Grand Central Station solved all my problems with slow-drying, bubbles, and getting dents and sheet wrinkles hours after finishing a mani. It saved my nail polish life, no lie."

It's a super-dark (black?) base with a dark purple, green, and blue multichrome shimmer.  In indirect or low lighting, it looks off-black. In direct light, the purple shimmer pops. Viewed at an angle, the green and blue shimmer shows. This polish has so much character; I've seen it read as dark brown, black, charcoal grey, dark purple, black with green shimmer, and dusky navy blue - all with a flick of the wrist. It's a great effect, while still being understated. Try as I might, I couldn't take a picture that would do justice to how this looks in person, probably because of the matte topcoat scattering the light. If you Google a picture of this in regular gloss, the multichrome shows up just like that, but you know, not shiny.  Just wanted to share this because it's an awesome shade for those who like dark colors and purples and it looks really fantastic in matte."

I'd suggest picking one based on the formula you like, since there are so many dupes out there. Some are cool, some are warm, some are sheer...just have fun with it and add your own matte topcoat.  As to your concern about wear-time, it is true that a matte topcoat does not wear as long as a regular gloss topcoat, it's just the nature of it. A basecoat helps. I've also found that putting a regular topcoat on before the matte topcoat makes it more durable. I often find that my matte manis start to crack finely before they chip. Then I know it's time to start again. I don't mind it, since I'm usually ready for a new look after a week or so, which is about as long as I can get my matte manis to last."
malepolish,2v5728,nishidake,2,Sun Feb 8 11:16:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with nishidake, I put a glossy topcoat on before my matte coat.   Zoya Loredana is super pretty, but has a slight shimmer to it, and I don't know about the Essie. I have Sinful Colors My Turn, which is matte out of the bottle, but is more of a medium-dark gray. Also have Sinful Colors Cool Gray, which is very light, but glossy."

malepolish,2v3lqo,MITPewPewPew,9,Sat Feb 7 16:15:51 2015 UTC,"Wear nail polish.  Just get neutral colors that aren't super noticeable, then gradually change it up.  Wear something brighter to school and bring along some remover with you.  If it's a problem, just take it off.  There were plenty of boys with their nails painted black when I was in high school, and that was over ten years ago.  I bet people will notice even less than you expect."
malepolish,2v3lqo,lmoneyholla,2,Sat Feb 7 16:21:50 2015 UTC,What colors would you suggest?
malepolish,2v3lqo,lmoneyholla,1 point,Sat Feb 7 17:19:35 2015 UTC,Check out Essie brand polish next time you're at the store.  They have lots of sheers and neutrals.  Just hold the bottle against your skin and see if you like the way it looks color wise.
malepolish,2v3lqo,JaxenGrey,10,Sun Feb 8 15:37:42 2015 UTC,"If you are concerned about how being teased will make you feel, and don't think you are prepared to be the recipient of negative commentary, then opt not to wear polish to school.  On the contrary, you could wear it anyway, rock that shit, and understand that the naysayers are just insignificant nobodies whose opinion doesn't mean a damn thing in the grand scheme of things. So they disapprove. Big deal. Who knows; maybe you'll start a thing."
malepolish,2v3lqo,drwilco,2,Sat Feb 7 16:37:51 2015 UTC,"So very much this. I know adult life is very unlike high school, but I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised by how few negative and how many positive reactions I've had.  Being in high school though, I expect you'll get some taunts from insecure people who don't know how to deal with things that don't fit in their world view.  I suggest you prepare yourself for that, by remembering exactly what /u/JaxenGrey said. And coming up with some funny retorts in advance. You don't actually have to use them, and it's probably best if you just don't respond at all, but thinking up beforehand what people might say will help you realize how sad and predictable the negative people are when they actually do say those things to you.  Hey, if Jason Mewes can rock nailpolish, so can you! :)"
malepolish,2v3lqo,JaxenGrey,3,Sun Feb 8 20:12:46 2015 UTC,"And Snoop, who regularly posts his pro manicures on his Instagram. And Jason Ellis, and Johnny Depp, multiple MMA fighters, and a whole bunch of other notable people. I think there is a link on the sidebar with a big list."
malepolish,2v3lqo,tang0008,6,Sun Feb 8 23:52:30 2015 UTC,"I started wearing nail polish in high school and it prompted a conversation with the big mohawked punk dude who sat in the back of my study hall. I always knew he was cool, but that sort of started our friendship. So, yeah, it's intimidating, and you'll get comments, but if you're prepared for the repercussions of being yourself you can be pleasantly surprised."
malepolish,2v3lqo,GypsyRoseTea,5,Sat Feb 7 21:19:21 2015 UTC,"Have you seen the peel off base coats you can get now?  If you use that under the colour then you can remove it all quickly and easily if needed and it won't stain your nails.    If you're looking to ease into it then maybe try just wearing clear for a bit, then work up to nudes and greys for a neutral look."
malepolish,2v3lqo,nishidake,6,Sat Feb 7 18:43:53 2015 UTC,"Just do it. As others suggested you can start with clear and then work to nudes and neutrals. Or you can just go straight to good old, butch black. Try doing just your thumbnail or ring finger black for starters. Dark blue, dark purple, grey and military green are good as well. Add a matte topcoat to tone down the shine and make it more masculine if you like.  You can really wear the most ridiculous and flamboyant things if you do it with supreme confidence, so the key is to commit fully to your own baddassery. It's all about swagger. As a bonus, chicks (and dudes, I'm told) really dig confidence.  You will not look back on high school and be grateful for how you conformed, all the times you kept your head down, and how many chances to express yourself you passed up. Part of becoming an adult and a self-actualized human is learning how to be genuinely, unapologetically yourself.  Many a confused soul has wasted their life fighting that and trying to be who they think others want them to be, so don't fall for it.  You want to wear nail polish? Don't ask for anyone's permission to be yourself; just go do it, and do it big."
malepolish,2v3lqo,drwilco,3,Sun Feb 8 11:26:58 2015 UTC,"I wear sparkly stuff on my nails more often than not. One friend asked why I was wearing nailpolish, and followed it with ""are you trying to protect your nails?"" My reply was ""Yeah, I wear super flamboyant black with silver sparkles on my nails to protect them. What do you think?""  The issue was never brought up again. :)  Remember that you are the only person that can decide whether negative people can impact you. Do what you want, what you think suits yourself best, and own it. Acknowledge compliments, and ignore criticism that's not constructive. Ignore ""dude, you gay or something?"" and embrace ""you're chipping pretty bad, have you considered base and top coats?"" or ""the yellow on your nails doesn't go well with the pink shirt you're wearking."" Unless yellow & pink are the school colors or something. :)"
malepolish,2v3lqo,GuyPolish,3,Sun Feb 8 20:19:56 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, you should go all in and go with a color you really like. The key is owning it. Attitude is everything. If you try and hide it, they will sense your insecurity and the feeding frenzy will start. It is harder for them criticize you if you act like their opinion doesn't matter to you. I wish I had started younger. Let us know what you decided and how it went."
malepolish,2v3lqo,collapsibletank,2,Wed Feb 11 02:22:35 2015 UTC,I wear it for the same reasons everyone else does. And for none of the reasons that they don't.

Im a newbie and this has been my first weekend with polish on my nails - I went with Opi - 4 in the morning ( its a flat black).

malepolish,2u4fpp,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jan 29 23:07:00 2015 UTC,"TARDIS:       The TARDIS   (/ˈtɑrdɪs/; Time and Relative Dimension in Space)  is a time machine and spacecraft in the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who and its associated spin-offs The Sarah Jane Adventures, Torchwood and more.  A TARDIS is a product of the advanced technology of the Time Lords, an extraterrestrial civilisation to which the programme's central character, the Doctor, belongs. A properly maintained and piloted TARDIS can transport its occupants to any point in time and any place in the universe. The interior of a TARDIS is much larger than its exterior, which can blend in with its surroundings using the ship's ""chameleon circuit"". TARDISes also possess a degree of sentience (which has been expressed in a variety of ways ranging from implied machine personality and free will through to the use of a conversant avatar) and provide their users with additional tools and abilities including a telepathically based universal translation system.  In the series, the Doctor pilots an apparently unreliable, obsolete Type 40, Mark 1   TARDIS. Its chameleon circuit is broken, leaving it stuck in the shape of a 1960s-style London police box after a visit to London in 1963.  The Doctor's TARDIS was for most of the series' history said to have been stolen from the Time Lords' home planet, Gallifrey, where it was old, decommissioned and derelict.  However, during the events of ""The Doctor's Wife"" (2011), the ship's consciousness briefly inhabits a human body named Idris, and she reveals that far from being stolen, she left of her own free will. During this episode, she flirtatiously implies that she ""stole"" the Doctor rather than the other way around, although she does also refer to him as her ""thief"" in the same episode.

malepolish,2u1hsl,nishidake,2,Thu Jan 29 03:13:38 2015 UTC,Awesome design. I'd love to meet someone to share my love of polish with. Your a lucky guy.
malepolish,2u1hsl,GuyPolish,1 point,Wed Feb 11 03:11:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Actually, I'm a gal, as it were, but I agree that I'm lucky to have a partner that isn't at all worried by non-binary gender expression and is really into queering fashion conventions.  My style leans to an androgynous mashup/juxtaposition of feminine and masculine elements. Let's call it Tomboy Glam.   Anyway, there are plenty of people, even it the LGBTQ community that really want to put everyone in butch/femme buckets. Those people see a female like that, one that doesn't fit their idea of text-book feminine, and they want to cram her into a 'butch' box and tell her she can't wear makeup/nail polish/pink/dresses/ or be really f***ing fabulous because OMG it's totally confusing their narrow view and can she just make up her mind already?? It presents a unique challenge.  So I wear nail polish on my terms, dammit, and I share it here with you guys because I think we face some of the same resistance in trying to both redefine nail polish as not inherently 'girly' and refusing to accept that femininity is anything to be ashamed about in the first place."
malepolish,2u1hsl,GuyPolish,2,Wed Feb 11 11:46:48 2015 UTC,It is a shame that wanting to label people and put them in neat little boxes is even in the LGBT community. Maybe it is just human nature. You keep rocking your Tomboy Glam! BTW I think that is an awesome look.

malepolish,2rawc5,drwilco,1 point,Tue Jan 13 06:07:06 2015 UTC,I'm very skeptical of this. Also steam just sounds like a bad idea due to the temperature. Where are you that you can't order online quickly?
malepolish,2rawc5,nishidake,1 point,Mon Jan 5 09:52:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, this totally works. I've done this before. It doesn't give a totally smooth finish like a matte topcoat will as it picks up a few water spots if you hold it too close to the steam, but it works. Great way to see how you feel about matte finishes before you go buy a bottle of matte topcoat.  My favorite matte topcoat is Wet n Wild Wild Shine Matte topcoat. You can usually find it at any drugstore that carries Wet n Wild. It's super-matte (surpassed only by Butter London!), and cheap at only $1. One caveat: the last half of the bottle gets quite thick, so you may want to have some thinner on hand or be prepared to toss it when it's no longer workable. NYC also makes a matte topcoat (In a New York Color Minute Matte Me Crazy), but I haven't personally tried it yet. There are probably some other drugstore brands with a matte topcoat you might be able to find locally. If you really can't find a matte topcoat, you can also try matte-ifying the polish you have by mixing it with black eye shadow or with cornstarch. Just look around online for specific instructions."
