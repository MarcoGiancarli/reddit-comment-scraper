witcher,3dxwcu,IAmYourFath,225,Mon Jul 20 13:23:59 2015 UTC,This is a common problem in games and it bugs me. I want to use unique weapons like this because they look so cool but I end up using weapons that have better stats. :(

witcher,3dxwcu,MeshesAreConfusing,12,Mon Jul 20 16:21:08 2015 UTC,"At least Dawnbreaker had a unique effect on undead creatures that, as far as I know, no other weapon or spell will have. The Daedric weapons were pretty good about being legitimately unique. Off the top of my head, there was the mace that both drained stamina and cast soul trap, and the magic deflecting shield. I had a Mage character and used the Sanguine Rose and Jabberwock pretty extensively. On the other hand, when the Jarl of Whiterun gives you that weapon ""from his personal armory"" like its some kind of unique, powerful thing, it's pretty disappointing to find its on par or worse compared to something you could craft for cheap."
witcher,3dxwcu,Shawn_of_the_Dead,5,Mon Jul 20 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you were making a joke or not (if you were, then sorry), but it's the Wabbajack!"
witcher,3dxwcu,GaiusCassius,2,Mon Jul 20 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"That's a problem with all of the Elder Scrolls game.  It's actually a good idea to avoid crafting entirely, because it's insanely broken.  Try a playthrough with just the shit you find in dungeons and as quest rewards, you won't find it so painfully dull by the end."

witcher,3dxwcu,TheImmortalLS,2,Mon Jul 20 18:48:23 2015 UTC,"Most of the Daedra weapons were pretty good in design, and fit the lore well, too. Molag Bal is all about domination, and his mace weakens the foe with each hit and eventually dominates their soul. Dawnbreaker reflects Meridia's hate for the undead. Wabbajack reflects Sheogorath's wild and unpredictable personality. Mephala's blade has an interesting upgrade mechanic that suits her affinity for murder. But then you have Peryite's shield which blocks spells. Awesome upgrade, but why's it connected to Peryite? And Mehrunes' Razor's unique enchantment is just lazy."

witcher,3dxwcu,cespes,18,Mon Jul 20 15:43:51 2015 UTC,"Well, the only other way to do it better is to make new weapons and armour rare as fuck.   Look at Gothic I and II, every weapon you gained was something special, every armour was hard earned. And the differences between the weapons and armour (in stats) was something you really noticed. 30% protection against swords instead of 20%? That's a chance to survive one more hit! 25 damage instead of 15? Wow, now I can kill a Goblin in two hits, or even one if I land a critical..."
witcher,3dxwcu,Mandarion,13,Mon Jul 20 14:39:15 2015 UTC,"Why not make all the ""legendary"" weapons relevant to endgame by attaching a perk system like Destiny's guns have but tied to character level instead of usage?   So you find the Mythic Axe of Smiting or some such and it's listed as a max level weapon but you are still able to wield it and as your level increases the axe becomes better (unique effects, increased stats, etc) because your character is becoming more skilled."

witcher,3dxwcu,478431188447,8,Mon Jul 20 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"BS. Oblivion was filled with diverse and strong Weapons as Quest Rewards. The problem there was that they were levelled according to the level you had when finishing the quests, which meant you had to wait until you were medium-high level yourself or you'd get a crappy version of them. Except for the ones that were actually in any way ""hyped"" - those were mostly daedric artifacts and they all lived up to the hype.   Skyrim has the problem that Crafting is so overpowered that if you invest some points in it you'll never find anything better than the stuff you make yourself. It still doesnt suffer from the problem you described though."

That should be a feature in every fucking game. Now sure, one could argue that it would make players less likely to want to work for better gear, and to them I say, shut up I want my cool killy knife."
witcher,3dxwcu,Macismyname,12,Mon Jul 20 15:34:47 2015 UTC,"That's why I don't understand the reward leveling system in Elder Scrolls. As you level up your long blade, for instance, you will do more and more damage with your long blades. You'll always do more damage with a rusty iron short sword at level 100 than a daedric longsword at level 10, or whatever the base is, even though the base stats for the daedric item are much better. At the very least, why not have a similar effect happen to a weapon's magic properties as you level up your magic skills? The current system they have just ensures your God Killing Sword of Ultimate Destruction won't give a bandit a paper cut in five levels."
witcher,3dxwcu,FoeHammer7777,2,Mon Jul 20 15:48:58 2015 UTC,Morrowind did this. As your magical skills improved the damage your enchanted weapons did magically also did.

The Redanian guard that takes your swords before you talk to Radovid says pretty much the same thing. Geralt responds: ""It's not the edge of the sword, but the man who wields it"" or something to that effect. Anyway, a sword's swing is only as powerful as the person swinging it."

witcher,3dxwcu,BonTonVon,4,Mon Jul 20 15:39:33 2015 UTC,"Should make a mod that all the unique swords scale with your level - 5 or something. That way you could ALWAYS use them but if you find a normal non-unique sword that's better, you could use that for around 2-3 levels and then return to the unique one.  Also the combat redesign mod in witcher 2 did solve this problem as well in a way. Instead of having sword damage increase and things, almost every sword had the same stats. That way you could use whatever you want.  I'm interested what the community would make once the modding tools are released."
witcher,3dxwcu,zelin11,5,Mon Jul 20 15:41:09 2015 UTC,"It could be easily fixed. Most RPG just use a system where weapons and armors have level tied to them as well as different stats that are increased depending on how good you want them to be:  I.e lvl1 weapon does 20 dmg while lvl 15 weapon does 150 dmg.  It could be super easily fixed by NOT HAVING LEVELS AND FIXED STATS TIED TO A WEAPON.   Solution? MAYBE MAKE DAMAGE DEPENDENT ON YOUR CHARACTERS LEVEL AND ATTRIBUTES. Seriously, why is this not a thing? All you need on weapons and armors are different multipliers.  I.e You begin with a small sword that gives you increased attackspeed and critical percentage but only provides 75% damage.  Later on you get an ancient cool sword from a King that is quite big, so it lowers attackspeed with 15% but it deals 10% more damage than normal (damage is set according to player level and attributes remember), it gives 15% extra cold damage and can also do some other cool shit. It's also way more durable due to that it's made out of some cool material iunno.  This way a weapon is never out of date, you could switch back to your first weapon if you want a bit more attackspeed or something and it won't totally suck shit, and ""legendary"" weapons WILL ACTUALLY BE LEGENDARY AND NOT DISCARDED 3 MINUTES AFTER YOU GOT IT BECAUSE IT'S 2 LEVELS BELOW THE SWORD YOU CURRENTLY GOT EQUIPPED.  /end of rant.  Sorry, I just hate level system on equipment when they're not needed. It totally makes sense in WoW imo but for a game like witcher or skyrim (ooh an ancient badass sword that's been buried for 200 years in a crypt, better sell it for 20 gold) just annoys the shit out of me.  //EDIT I also hate it due to you check a store at lvl1 that has a lvl1 shit weapons it (in witcher for example). Lets say they got a ""Iron longsword"" it does 0.00001 damage and totally sucks. 25 levels later you go back to the same vendor and check his goods, now he got lvl25 Iron longswords that does 280 damage for some fucking reason, it's supposed to be the same kind of sword isn't it! WHY DIDN'T YOU HAVE THEM EARLIER, and don't try to evade it by saying that levels is just an arbitrary thing, it represents how you get stronger, I still got that lvl1 sword that does basically NO damage, explain that! Crap vendors selling me shit gear."

Feel free to reshare as desired, but please give me a little credit and let me know if you do."
witcher,3dxwcu,Laislebai,34,Mon Jul 20 13:02:35 2015 UTC,"The sword I got from Crach was called ""Winter's Blade""... Does the blade you get vary?"
witcher,3dxwcu,Laislebai,43,Mon Jul 20 13:15:02 2015 UTC,"Nah, there's two actually. You get Fate from a side quest, and Winter's Blade from the main quest. They both have very similar dialog scenes before them where Crach really talks up the meaning of the sword."
witcher,3dxwcu,vipr9,10,Mon Jul 20 13:16:35 2015 UTC,Ah... okay. Thanks for the clarification. What's the side quest you can get Fate from?
witcher,3dxwcu,Laislebai,15,Mon Jul 20 13:27:55 2015 UTC,"Help both of Crach's kids, I think ""Possession"" and ""The Lord of Undvik"""
witcher,3dxwcu,brianbrianbrian,9,Mon Jul 20 13:39:34 2015 UTC,Hmm... Kk... Might have missed it or already sold it and forgotten it then... mild spoiler
witcher,3dxwcu,Laislebai,7,Mon Jul 20 14:35:25 2015 UTC,First time I've been here with CSS on. Holy crap that is some amazing spoiler formatting.
witcher,3dxwcu,PM_ME_CAKE,4,Mon Jul 20 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"I've used spoiler tags in other subreddits, but I had to edit my first spoiler post in r/witcher three times before I got it right :P"
witcher,3dxwcu,lupo_grigio,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:44:34 2015 UTC,"There used to be different, in my opinion easier, formatting but then it got changed to fit in with the mainstream formatting reddit uses I believe. Just some piece of trivia there."
witcher,3dxwcu,watchme3,3,Mon Jul 20 16:19:11 2015 UTC,"I love how you draw characters's expression, it's fucking priceless!"
witcher,3dxwcu,Kashik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, I really appreciate it!"
witcher,3dxwcu,Kashik,2,Mon Jul 20 17:27:26 2015 UTC,Can you make a comic on how you enter a map by pressing m near a marked post to find your travel destination just to exit the map and then access the same thing through the travel post.
witcher,3dxwcu,ultZor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"quick question - where did you get this sword? i mean, from whom :)"
witcher,3dxwcu,Yourhero88,2,Mon Jul 20 16:06:24 2015 UTC,You get it from Crach an Craite in Skellige. He's supposed to be the dude in panel 1.
witcher,3dxwcu,zold5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Didn't follow that quest yet."
witcher,3dxwcu,gardenalli,35,Mon Jul 20 18:02:57 2015 UTC,"I felt so bad that I just dropped it right there in that room. I was so rich I could buy their whole island. And that sword was so cheap and useless. It was like if Bruce Wayne took a toy gun from some little kid, whose father gave it to him as a present.   After finishing the game the sword is still there on the floor. A lonely x on the map..."
witcher,3dxwcu,Warpig-034,12,Mon Jul 20 14:21:29 2015 UTC,"Now, that's role playing!"
witcher,3dxwcu,Mysquff,23,Mon Jul 20 14:30:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I felt quite a bit worse, since I went and immediately melted it down for scrap at his own blacksmith."
witcher,3dxwcu,Badm0n,11,Mon Jul 20 13:31:08 2015 UTC,"I considered doing that in the strip instead, but decided it was more cruel to sell the sword to his own armorsmith. The next time Crach comes by to look at his inventory, he's gonna be in for a shock!"
witcher,3dxwcu,Mysquff,17,Mon Jul 20 14:04:49 2015 UTC,Yeah that part really bothered me. That sword was garbage. It should have been been one of the best weapons in the game.
witcher,3dxwcu,Revoran,11,Mon Jul 20 13:44:05 2015 UTC,also...  like some other guy here said:   its a steel sword and you use silver swords against the wild hunt.
witcher,3dxwcu,Joha_Mraadu,16,Mon Jul 20 14:48:02 2015 UTC,I wish you had an actual home at Kaer Morhen like in Elder Scrolls games. I feel so shitty selling story significant or otherwise nice weapons instead of mounting them on a wall.
witcher,3dxwcu,FenixR,4,Mon Jul 20 14:25:27 2015 UTC,You are not the only one waiting for RedKit ;)
witcher,3dxwcu,thealienelite,13,Mon Jul 20 14:42:43 2015 UTC,TOP NOTCH SWORDS!
witcher,3dxwcu,Mysquff,4,Mon Jul 20 14:29:34 2015 UTC,Said my favourite armorer :)
witcher,3dxwcu,HopelessChip35,11,Mon Jul 20 15:36:23 2015 UTC,"Lol, that Blacksmith is the guy with the cluster headaches/migraines (AKA suicide headaches) who CDPR put in the game."
witcher,3dxwcu,thealienelite,7,Mon Jul 20 14:04:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I found that out when looking for visual references for the blacksmith. He's a redditor!"
witcher,3dxwcu,zeelenman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:07:12 2015 UTC,Hailing /u/KingNick!!
witcher,3dxwcu,SeryaphFR,9,Mon Jul 20 18:04:19 2015 UTC,Wait a minute... They are other swords besides the witcher school ones?! Shock
witcher,3dxwcu,SeryaphFR,8,Mon Jul 20 14:34:30 2015 UTC,Feline sword ftw!  But I would so use better versions of the Viper if they existed.
witcher,3dxwcu,Thousand_Minus_Seven,5,Mon Jul 20 14:52:09 2015 UTC,"When RedKit comes out, I hope someone will create whole Viper School set based on Letho armor."
witcher,3dxwcu,Bojangles1987,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:33 2015 UTC,I always used the Wolf school set and wolf school swords because I thought that is what suits Geralt the most. Also wolf school mastercrafted swords are the best looking swords in the game imo.
witcher,3dxwcu,runetrantor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:34:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm doing post-game treasure hunts now. Question, did you have any trouble finding the mastercrafted woven armor? It's supposed to be in this well but I can't find it..."
witcher,3dxwcu,HMPoweredMan,8,Mon Jul 20 18:28:36 2015 UTC,"Same goes for the ""Of swords and dumplings"" quest. ""A sword fit for killing gods"" was promised to me, made him brake it up into parts and discarded them as payback in the end."
witcher,3dxwcu,General_Task,8,Mon Jul 20 14:45:41 2015 UTC,peice of crap
witcher,3dxwcu,Sleith,3,Mon Jul 20 15:24:52 2015 UTC,"Fuuuuuuuuuuck. Gotta fix that, thanks!"
witcher,3dxwcu,Dusty8,3,Mon Jul 20 15:25:42 2015 UTC,"Haha, no worries. Sorry to be that guy, but it's just a million times worse when you see it on a comic or something."
witcher,3dxwcu,soupdujourdesigns,3,Mon Jul 20 15:28:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, I get it and appreciate the catch! I'm just kicking myself now for missing it, but I'll at least be able to fix it elsewhere."
witcher,3dxwcu,MrBootylove,7,Mon Jul 20 15:31:48 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who kept it? I mean yeah it was useless, but come on, it was a gift !"
witcher,3dxwcu,JohanDeWitt,5,Mon Jul 20 15:23:25 2015 UTC,"I did, too. Not keeping it after that scene would feel wrong to me."
witcher,3dxwcu,biggpoppa,3,Mon Jul 20 17:58:57 2015 UTC,"Only his sword I kept despite being underpowered, Crach treated you like a brother, no way I would insult him that way."
witcher,3dxwcu,LeeSingerGG,4,Mon Jul 20 18:47:25 2015 UTC,"If nothing less, the chracht sword inspired me to make my steel sword an ice sword and my silver sword a fire sword."
witcher,3dxwcu,mattu411,5,Mon Jul 20 13:47:28 2015 UTC,"Good one u/thecrazyD  Normally I just collect them.  For some reason Geralt seems to have lost Fate from Witcher 2, which leads me to believe Crach is a liar or Geralt tossed it previously after raiding a crypt :)."
witcher,3dxwcu,Nolat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:50:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I put all the unique swords in my stash
witcher,3dxwcu,NoMeGustav,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:01:07 2015 UTC,Thanks!
witcher,3dxwcu,bigoletim,4,Mon Jul 20 14:05:22 2015 UTC,#NoRespectForHistory
witcher,3dxwcu,Winged_Bull,3,Mon Jul 20 13:57:07 2015 UTC,"This is the exact time when I stopped playing until the patch came out.  I couldn't sell the Crach family sword - I've been storing every Relic item I get all weekend and yeah, I'm broke but at least I have a ton of awesome swords and armor."
witcher,3dxwcu,Pokkuru,2,Mon Jul 20 14:54:45 2015 UTC,"Cool comic, though I saw a video posted on this sub a while back that was literally this exact joke."
witcher,3dxwcu,Jorumvar,2,Mon Jul 20 15:01:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially The Swords and dumplings guy oversold it a bit."
witcher,3dxwcu,Obihai,2,Mon Jul 20 15:08:58 2015 UTC,That sword I kept for a good while it was a pretty good upgrade for me.  Once I could craft my enhanced ursine steel sword then it went bye bye.
witcher,3dxwcu,ozman51,2,Mon Jul 20 15:24:28 2015 UTC,This sword was actually good and useful to me.
witcher,3dxwcu,Dredly,3,Mon Jul 20 15:38:19 2015 UTC,"It may depend on how many side missions you do. I know I was on the Enhanced Feline armor and weapons already when I got to this point, which blew these swords out of the water."
witcher,3dxwcu,Ottaw,2,Mon Jul 20 15:40:15 2015 UTC,Where's Matt Hardy?
witcher,3dxwcu,D3USN3X,2,Mon Jul 20 15:39:43 2015 UTC,the second panel makes it look like hes hypnotizing someone lol
witcher,3dxwcu,MetalusVerne,2,Mon Jul 20 16:40:41 2015 UTC,I just played this exact scene last night lol
witcher,3dxwcu,Solifluktion,2,Mon Jul 20 19:14:12 2015 UTC,But it looks soo cool with runes though
witcher,3dxwcu,MetalusVerne,2,Mon Jul 20 20:10:56 2015 UTC,"I kinda felt bad for selling it, but still sold it because it was junk."
witcher,3dxwcu,Solifluktion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:33 2015 UTC,Any news on when modders will be able to correct stupid issues like these with the Redkit?
witcher,3dxwcu,Kursed_Valeth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:43:47 2015 UTC,"So very, very true...  I feel terrible about it for exactly 6 seconds, then I forget about it and move on"
witcher,3dxwcu,biggpoppa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:37 2015 UTC,"Strange thing, I was actually using it for a little while. Change 2 minutes later to 4 hours later :D"
witcher,3dxwcu,WolfSL4Y3R,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:49 2015 UTC,So True...
witcher,3dxwcu,Omegaus492,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:17 2015 UTC,"LOL, yeah I think I did the exact same thing. I sold the armor back to the chick that made it, sold the God Killing sword back to the guy that made it and this sword to the first blacksmith I found... meanwhile I'm using an axe that I found off a bandit that does 20 more damage and a silver sword that I found some random vendor had that is randomly generated... the loot really needs to be scaled WAY differently."
witcher,3dxwcu,0v3rcl0ck3r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:10:41 2015 UTC,i carried it around for a while and actually thought he demands it back.  so not knowing what to do with it i dropped it on his bed.
witcher,3dxwcu,Chiefhammerprime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:18 2015 UTC,"And that's why I think witcher 3 would be better without levels.  Of course they would've had to replace it with something to simulate progress, but levels, in the classical sense are outdated."
witcher,3dxwcu,MarshmellowPoot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:15:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, say what you want about the first witcher, at least they did this mostly right.  Aerondight was far better than the rune swords you could craft before getting it."
witcher,3dxwcu,NotPaulieWalnuts,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. However there's a long time (act 2-4) where you run around wearing the same armor, using the same swords and once you've reached the end of act 4 and the beginning of act 5 you get drowned in new weapons. I could've replaced Aerondight within 2 hours after receiving it. And I was forced to replace the Mahakam Rune Sihil within an hour after receiving it. I feel like you should've gotten both in act 3 instead."
witcher,3dxwcu,Endyo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:49 2015 UTC,"That's true, although I'd have moved something else up before Aerondight rather than making it non-endgame gear.  Given the circumstances in which it was acquired, it feels more special than any of Geralt's other weapons, which makes it sad that the other end-game silver sword had better stats in Witcher 2."
witcher,3dxwcu,savantfool,2,Mon Jul 20 15:38:18 2015 UTC,Agreed. I refused to use the Moonblade/Dyable in Witcher 2 and kept the Mahakam Rune Sihil and Aerondight for as long as feasible because they just looked better.
witcher,3dxwcu,troyschmehl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:44:57 2015 UTC,Plus lore :)
witcher,3dxwcu,docfate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:24:47 2015 UTC,I felt bad about dismantling or selling it so it put it in my stash :)
witcher,3dxwcu,Ex_Outis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:23:42 2015 UTC,I mighta done that actually if a stash was implemented at the time I played.
witcher,3dxwcu,drinkit_or_wearit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:22 2015 UTC,that's the exact thing that I did once I got it haha.
witcher,3dxwcu,eobet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:43 2015 UTC,"I actually kept it because I felt like it was so important, of course I didn't use it, it was just my tiny bit of roleplaying I suppose."
witcher,3dxwcu,bertojr09,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:31:04 2015 UTC,"Attack damage should be bound to character stats not weapon. Weapon should only provide some perks like bleeding, piercing, and what not that will be effective in certain type of monsters or enemies."
witcher,3dxwcu,nstablen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:31:49 2015 UTC,"I held onto it for awhile because I thought at some point in the story, Crach would ask me about it and not having the sword would result in some sort of story twist.   Then I got sick of looking at it and dismantled it for parts."
witcher,3dxwcu,Gundarc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:31:58 2015 UTC,I like that it's a steel sword and completely useless against the hunt regardless of what lvl it is.
witcher,3dxwcu,krabklayton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:44:17 2015 UTC,Pretty much
witcher,3dxwcu,pureparadise,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:33 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is that I found some of the best swords for my level either in random crates or from extremely underleveled quests.  The drop system doesn't make a whole lot of sense when it comes to levels.    The strange thing is for this particular quest I did it the first time and said like ""hell yeah let me have that"" and got a sword four levels under me, then I felt bad (and was kind of miffed) so I reloaded and did it again saying ""nah that's too fancy"" and of course he gives it to you anyways and it was suddenly a different level and actually useful for a bit."
witcher,3dxwcu,ILikeCannabis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:59:39 2015 UTC,I went back to Crach and dropped the sword in his room cause I could not sell it.
witcher,3dxwcu,comicbookbeard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:56 2015 UTC,"When I first got this sword I was like, ""Fuck yeah man! Thanks I shall slay many monsters that cross my path with your beautifully forged steel."" So I took a look at the stats and say, "" Damn I feel bad that I took this piece of shit."" Then I sold it.  NO REGRETS"
witcher,3dxwcu,JStrikly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:13 2015 UTC,"I actually felt badly about doing that so I stopped playing for 6 days with my weight at 162/160 until 1.07 came out so I could put these crap ""legendary"" swords into my storage."
witcher,3dxwcu,foolonahill89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:50 2015 UTC,"I saved both swords, put them in my chest, and sometimes put on the Undvik armor and tour Skellige with these swords, kicking as like a true skelliger"
witcher,3dxwcu,schkibberd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:26 2015 UTC,"Games should just give money rewards or usable rewards. In a game like Witcher 3 we could even be able to just tell the quest giver, ""Hey, look I already made/have better. Can I just get paid?"" I mean, isn't that kind of a Witcher thing anyway?"
witcher,3dxwcu,Arafax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:34 2015 UTC,I sold it before the stash patch got released. Can you find it at a vendor randomly again? I do feel bad...
witcher,3dxwcu,_cheal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:35:35 2015 UTC,My exact reaction
witcher,3dxwcu,Sardonnicus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:29 2015 UTC,I was so disappointed when I completed Of Swords and Dumplings. Stupid level 22 Blade from the Bits or whatever it was
witcher,3dxwcu,theransaid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:15 2015 UTC,"Its the nature of the combat system, and is not likely to be remedied with out throwing balance out of whack.  Now, if they went to a system where weapons had marginal in stats, and quality differences, and the majority of the dmg was applied by some sort of skill based system, oh like Ultima Online as an example, then it could work."
