minnesotavikings,3e38hi,Ewulkevoli,8,Tue Jul 21 18:16:28 2015 UTC,Well....I had a pretty huge lunch so all my energy is going towards digestion...  I'm pretty happy about this though. More surprised really. Pleasantly surprised even!!
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,swampsparrow,3,Tue Jul 21 18:27:58 2015 UTC,I would say I'm even quite titillated by this series of events.
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,Splagodiablo,5,Tue Jul 21 18:33:33 2015 UTC,"to be fair, he did capitalize the H in Hi. That's like at least level 2 enthusiasm"
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,PKThundr7,13,Tue Jul 21 18:32:42 2015 UTC,I'm guessing he got more guaranteed money. Hopefully they worked out so it lowers his cap hit too.
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,dustinyo_,4,Tue Jul 21 16:55:26 2015 UTC,PFT reporting $20million guaranteed
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,stromprommer,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:24 2015 UTC,"So his original remaining three years were essentially zero guaranteed but totalled 47 million, does that sound correct?  Now it seems like they gave him a ton of guaranteed but lowered the overall cap hit substantially. Hopefully it's like 11-12 million a year  That shit would be amazing, he'd save quite a bit of face by doing that."
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,full_fire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:27 2015 UTC,how much do you guarantee him? how significantly does it reduce his cap? i'd like to see it drop to ~8M
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,dustinyo_,3,Tue Jul 21 16:58:02 2015 UTC,I'm sure the details will be out by the end of the day so probably not much point to try and guess.
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,datekman,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:40 2015 UTC,agreed. But that's half the fun!
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,PKS_5,7,Tue Jul 21 17:00:55 2015 UTC,"This seems to have come out of nowhere. I didn't seem any rumblings from the normal Schefter type people. I'm wondering if he agreed to take less to have it all guaranteed, with some added performance bonuses."
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,deadjawa,18,Tue Jul 21 16:56:03 2015 UTC,That's bc our organization is tight lipped from top to bottom.

minnesotavikings,3e38hi,istasber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:27 2015 UTC,he almost had ~50M left in 3 years....how much less would he accept? how much would you guarantee?
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,in_sight,3,Tue Jul 21 16:58:37 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing they guaranteed about $20M, possibly shaved $10M off of the overall number. It isn't like we don't have the cap space to pay him for his final 3 years as long as his production holds."
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,datekman,0,Tue Jul 21 17:04:03 2015 UTC,"I feel $20M is too much. If it is that high I would believe it to be incentives based. The guy missed a season and had nothing but bad PR for the team. I wouldn't think they would smooth things over by throwing cash at him. But, I've been wrong before.   edit: changes ""tied to incentives"" to ""incentives based."""
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,p_U_c_K_IV,5,Tue Jul 21 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"$20M is a little high, maybe, but it's not that far off. They could fully guarantee his pay (~12.5 million, IIRC) this year and guarantee half of his salary next year, which would add up to around 20$ million total. All that while changing a majority of the other half of his 2016 salary into incentives to spread out his cap hit a bit. 2017 could have the same thing done, except the first half of his salary wouldn't be guaranteed.  That's probably not as team-friendly as you can make the deal, but it'd probably be a decent compromise for both parties. AD gets somewhere between a third and a half of his remaining contract guaranteed, earns his full contract if he plays lights out, a fair enough contract if he plays reasonably well, or is expendable in 2017 if he hits the over 30 wall."
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,adags18,3,Tue Jul 21 17:31:07 2015 UTC,"Guaranteed money is, by definition, not tied to incentives."

That's not too much. And AD is as important to us as Aaron Rodgers is to the Packers. So I don't think you're looking at this the right way.   Money pays for players. He's a once in a generation player. Don't be so worried about the cap that we end up not paying anyone. 'Tis the nature of the beast."

minnesotavikings,3e38hi,mysterygin,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:32 2015 UTC,"This is what I predicted from the beginning, if you want to look up the old posts. No reason for Spielman not to guarantee at least part of his contract, especially after he showed up and ended the drama."
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,LackofOriginality,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:53 2015 UTC,REAL NEWS!
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,Killer_Whale_Penguin,2,Tue Jul 21 17:47:31 2015 UTC,"Rotoworld clarifies:    Although some outlets are reporting Peterson has $7 million guaranteed in 2016, it is actually guaranteed for injury only. The Vikings will have to make a decision on A.D. next spring, when he's due a $5 million roster bonus in early March. The Vikings could conceivably cut Peterson early next offseason and wipe all of his $12.75 million scheduled payments for that year off the books. Peterson is only guaranteed to be a Viking in 2015."
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,jjspaceman,4,Tue Jul 21 23:05:50 2015 UTC,I really hope this was to clear up some space to sign Evan Mathis.
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,kvothe,8,Tue Jul 21 17:02:49 2015 UTC,"I doubt we're interested in Mathis. The guy is a stud, but he's 34? We aren't in the business of 1-2 year rentals anymore..."
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,vbullinger,3,Tue Jul 21 17:05:01 2015 UTC,Why not?  Mathis was one of the best guards in the league last year and we have a hole at guard.  One that we can fill in the 1-2 years that Mathis plays for us.  It would be perfect IMO
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,PKS_5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:23 2015 UTC,Although he was one of the best guards last year the Eagles let him seek the money he is asking for. He was slotted for $6.5M this upcoming year. He wants more. I just don't see us shelling out that kind of dough for a 34 year old guard that is seeking guarantees. Just my two cents.
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,chucktestlacoil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:19 2015 UTC,If this Adrian restructure creates more cap space this year then we can attempt to frontload the contract to pay him most of the guarantees he wants this year instead of the next
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,Manndrake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:18:41 2015 UTC,"If nobody else is willing to pay him more, he'll have to settle.  Judging by how he's not on an NFL roster? I'm willing to bet that he's finding out the rough way how much he's worth."
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,chucktestlacoil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:09:44 2015 UTC,He already stated that he didn't anticipate being signed till the end of July due to staff and decision makers traveling and vacationing. I'm sure he will still command at least 6.5M or return to the Eagles...?
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,HesLoose,3,Tue Jul 21 19:47:45 2015 UTC,"I know it probably won't happen, but a boy can dream, right? IMO if we got Mathis we would be one of the most complete teams in the league."

minnesotavikings,3e38hi,strib666,3,Tue Jul 21 17:13:47 2015 UTC,And our receivers pan out...I think this team has a few questions marks that the fans are willing to admit; the kool aid is clouding their judgment.
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,jaroto,5,Tue Jul 21 19:07:17 2015 UTC,Having Mathis next to him would be a major boost for Kalil
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,Aram_Fingal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:40:14 2015 UTC,Sounds perfect to me. Let's all our projects linemen work themselves out and gives us a stud in the meantime.  If none of the projects work out? Draft an LG in the first next year or the year after. Easy.
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,chucktestlacoil,0,Tue Jul 21 18:12:38 2015 UTC,I was thinking that but we won't know what we have in the line until camp is well under way.
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,asw1791,4,Tue Jul 21 17:13:45 2015 UTC,"Awesome.  Player of his caliber shouldn't be asked to play with that little guaranteed money, even if the base salary is ridiculous."
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,MNBLIZZARD,11,Tue Jul 21 16:57:09 2015 UTC,Whatever. I want team friendly contracts.  AP has been paid plenty and if he didn't want to play the remaining years without guarantees then he shouldn't agree to structure his contract that way. Players want front loaded contracts with all the guarantees up front. The consequence of that is the contract becomes very team friendly after a few years. I hope the team didn't guarantee anything beyond this year.
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,mcorcoran3,3,Tue Jul 21 17:12:41 2015 UTC,Everything non guaranteed really isn't really a contract in the nfl.  That works both ways.
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,jaroto,4,Tue Jul 21 17:16:54 2015 UTC,agreed. it pays off when you don't have a BS contract standoff...report to camp and it will work out. I just wish he had replaced his agent. Fuck that guy..
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,MNBLIZZARD,4,Tue Jul 21 16:59:34 2015 UTC,Exactly. the only thing that pains me in this situation Ben Douchra gettin' paid.
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,jaroto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:24 2015 UTC,"Douchra gets paid a percentage of ADs wages as AD gets paid. This doesn't really pay him any more, possibly less."

I doubt very much that these restructurings hurt the agents - they don't this work out of the goodness of their hearts, after all.  It's possible, if not likely, that the agents get a larger percentage of guaranteed money than they do of non-guaranteed money."
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,xGENERALxMiLLZx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:07:32 2015 UTC,"I'm glad he won't throw a fit this season, but a player who 1) was suspended nearly all of last season and 2) carried himself the way he did this summer (or let his agent push him dictate things) needs to produce before I think he's guaranteed anything."
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,datekman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:12:48 2015 UTC,What caliber is he anymore?  We don't know that.  He signed that contract knowing the terms.  How should he not be asked to play it out?  Hopefully we've lowered his base salary for 2016.  Give me DeMarco Murray for $8M/year any day of the week over Peterson for $13M/year.
minnesotavikings,3e38hi,mcorcoran3,2,Tue Jul 21 18:20:55 2015 UTC,I'd say we never know shit.  Most redditor opinions are based on zero real knowledge.  If the Vikings talent evaluators saw his camp workouts and trusted AD... That's good enough for me.

It was difficult to find fast tight ends and safeties, but there were always a couple Manziel-like quarterbacks (B speed, A agility, A acceleration), fast 6'4+ receivers and 6'0+ corners, 90+ speed linebackers, and defensive tackles that had A in both strength and acceleration."

minnesotavikings,3e3l4l,bro-en_-eyboard,5,Tue Jul 21 18:18:47 2015 UTC,That 90 speed rating is suspect as well.  After AP goes out and gets loose a couple times it will go up with the weekly updates.

The Vikings don't pay the Radisson to have their logo behind them during press conferences.   And businesses don't have morals. They have profit and loss statements, marketing departments and the rational thinking of a dolphin with a head injury.   They thought that associating with the team would affect their brand. It's as simple as that. I highly doubt that people over at Carlson Companies give two shits about AD's child, or are actually abhorred.

I thought I read somewhere that half of his 2016 salary is guaranteed in the event he's injured this year.  It sort of makes sense that those two things would go together. The injury guarantee means he can go all out this year without worrying about his income next year, which he'll need to do if he wants to have a shot at beating the escalator/de-escalator conditions."

minnesotavikings,3e2tgx,OnTheSwishHard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:49:32 2015 UTC,"What the fuck games did these people watch?! Obviously Teddy wasn't perfect. He shouldn't be, he was a rookie, thrown into the fire with a sub par running game, and an O-Line with only 2 true starters. It's as if they threw out every single thing he did right, and just said he's terrible. Forget about the come from behind wins, forget about the check into a screen for an 80yd TD, forget about the massive improvement throughout the year. I just have to shake my head, and patiently wait for these people to eat their words."

I think the game against the Broncos will be the first big test for our defense in 2015.

minnesotavikings,3dz9e8,jjspaceman,3,Mon Jul 20 20:55:50 2015 UTC,A win is a win for a union vs the employer.  Going forward this will be used in future CBA negotiations.
minnesotavikings,3dz9e8,Newport_100s,4,Tue Jul 21 00:04:49 2015 UTC,"My understanding is the league applied the new domestic violence policy to Adrian Peterson, but the union successfully argued that the old policy should have been applied(because of when the incident occured).   Doesn't mean much to the fans, or the team. Peterson could potentially get some money out of it. It also could affect other players who were subjected to the new policy(Ray Rice, Hardy)."
minnesotavikings,3dz9e8,jmcdon00,2,Tue Jul 21 05:55:05 2015 UTC,"The public certainly doesn't care anymore how this will affect Peterson monetarily. I think the new policy after Ray Rice was 6 games for first timers. Sooo maybe since the NFL unfairly trapped on the exempt list they might settle for less game checks he has to pay back. I dont even know if he had to pay anything back at all for being suspended since essentially served 9 extra games.   Its not like the Vikings are fighting this because it hurt their playoff chances. So yeah, i don't know what anyone has to gain besides Peterson's game checks and to set a precedent so this doesnt happen again."

minnesotavikings,3dwa59,Rufusking1,25,Mon Jul 20 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"Cian was livetweeting some of his analysis before people started bagging him for it. It was really unusual and not up to his standards, in my opinion. I disagree with /u/MN_hydroplane that this kind of analysis isn't useful—I think it's much more useful than only analysis when the ball is thrown to him because it eliminates the questions about the quality of the QB, the scheme and the quality of teammates (if you have a shitty teammate, they're going to get the lion's share of targets). It provides more consistency and a larger sample size. I think it's very relevant and that's how pro and college scouts evaluate players.  I've been doing work with someone (Ian Wharton, @NFLFilmStudy—he's doing all the tape stuff, I'm just doing math) who is doing something very similar and though he and Cian usually agree, his tape study of Rhodes was far different than Cian's. Though Ian only has some of the NFC done (and all of the AFC), Rhodes comes out favorably. I translate his coverage-by-route scores into letter grades by weighting routes for difficulty and by how often receivers run them (so each CB gets an individual grade for each route based on that route's difficulty and their success rate, then each of those scores gets weighted according to the frequency by which they're ran) and Rhodes is in top-fifteen territory.  Cian is better than this."
minnesotavikings,3dwa59,ArifHasanDN,3,Mon Jul 20 13:04:56 2015 UTC,"I remember him live-tweeting and pointing this play out, calling Rhodes sloppy. I think you made a comment on it where Cian said it was a bad play on Xavier's part where he went to cover the flat and then backed off to his zone.  No one was streaking through, he didn't bite on a fake, and he recovered to his original assignment like nothing happened.  Seemed like a fairly smart play.  He also seemed to focus quite a bit on the Patriots game during the live tweeting.  That was no one's best showing that day, and when Cassel couldn't keep the Offense on the field, the Defense was going to get exhausted."
minnesotavikings,3dwa59,menes40,8,Mon Jul 20 13:38:17 2015 UTC,"That play makes no sense to criticize. Rhodes has to check route combinations when making his decisions, and two eligible receivers could have stemmed into his zone. If so, he has to pick them up with man principles. If one of those receivers enters his zone, they are the primary targets for him because they are the outermost receivers. They did not enter his zone because of the stem of their routes (though I suppose technically the RB would have on the wheel route) so he moved back quickly to his deep third in order to protect the corner route, a route that would never be thrown on an opposite-end rollout. The timing for an action-7 route like that would not have been an issue unless the QB is throwing out of rhythm with bad footwork, which... good luck I guess?"
minnesotavikings,3dwa59,ArifHasanDN,2,Mon Jul 20 13:57:38 2015 UTC,"That was no one's best showing that day, and when Cassel couldn't keep the Offense on the field, the Defense was going to get exhausted.   I thought our defense did surprisingly well that day, considering the circumstances. They actually held the Pats offense to 1 legit drive / score, IIRC, and the rest were thanks to Cassel's turnovers."

I also definitely agree that analyzing a CB when they aren't targeted is important.  I have a question on the image you posted with the charting data. Some of the players (Vontae Davis pops out) don't appear to have a letter grade that correlates with their number grade (with Davis' INT-Adj grade, you'd expect him to be in the Bs, not the Cs). Is there any reason for why that happened?"

minnesotavikings,3dwa59,Just_Some_Homer,17,Mon Jul 20 03:11:59 2015 UTC,"This is essentially an analysis of how Rhodes performs when the ball wasn't thrown to him.  It seems a little pointless.  It's important to play every snap, but this is overboard imo"
minnesotavikings,3dwa59,MN_hydroplane,2,Mon Jul 20 02:13:12 2015 UTC,That's not pointless at all.  A CB's job is to make it so the opposing team cannot easily throw near them.
minnesotavikings,3dwa59,Decker87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:01 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I said it seemed a little pointless, and I asserted it as my opinion, not fact.  In my opinion, analyzing what a corner does when the ball was not thrown his way is kinda pointless.  There's two ways to look at it.  (1) look at it like this article does where getting beat by good receivers, even when the ball is not thrown his way, is significant because he's allowing more opportunity for the ball to be completed. Or (2) that the totality of the play resulted in his receiver not catching the ball, so that's good and end of story.  If he was consistently leaving receivers wide open, even bad quarterbacks would find a way to get the ball out there.  The bottom line is that when he was targeted (the important part of the game) he was pretty solid.  That's why this analysis seams pointless to me, but it's just an opinion which you can attribute to the way I choose to look at the play."
minnesotavikings,3dwa59,MN_hydroplane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:49:26 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, analyzing what a corner does when the ball was not thrown his way is kinda pointless.    No. It isn't. If he does his job the ball shouldn't be thrown his way, ever. See: Revis.  Also. I find it interesting that the analysis of Rhodes sounds A LOT like the criticism of Waynes before the draft. Athleticism, footwork... etc.   Zimmer is known for having a defense that evolves based on personnel. If this analysis is accurate (debatable), then perhaps we snagged Waynes to have two similar CBs, that will be a part of a defensive scheme that we haven't completely seen yet..."
minnesotavikings,3dwa59,p_U_c_K_IV,2,Mon Jul 20 18:34:43 2015 UTC,"Revis is a really great corner (either 1 or 2 in the league, probably depending on whether your a seahawks fan or not) with years of experience.  And the ball gets thrown his way plenty of times.  Don't get me wrong, Rhodes can definitely improve.  I just think analyzing what he's doing away from the ball is pointless for fans.  Did his receiver catch the ball?  No?  Fantastic.  Pass me a beer!  But hey, it's the off-season so I get it."

Fantastic. Pass me a beer! But hey, it's the off-season so I get it.   Under what context?   If the ball isn't thrown his way, more often than not he is doing his job or the other corner isn't. Either way, he is doing better than his counterpart and therefore it is definitely worth analyzing.   I don't understand your point. It's not as if the ball isn't thrown his way he isn't working his ass off. It actually means the opposite and is one position where not being involved definitely means you're super involved."

minnesotavikings,3dwa59,jjspaceman,6,Mon Jul 20 21:12:19 2015 UTC,"Rhodes will do worse in this type of evaluation because of having to line up against Calvin Johnson, Alshon Jeffrey, and Jordy Nelson.  Also, saying that coverage is either successful or unsuccessful isn't that great for analysis.  There is a big difference between getting space from your defender and being wide open, but this doesn't account for that"

I think that the article itself was a bit harsh in the middle, but I think that was mostly for effect. Reading the conclusion alone seems to give a more agreeable point:   Rhodes is an average starter with the potential to become much more...Being average means that you are better than half of the players starting at the position across all 32 rosters. An average starter is a valuable player. Rhodes is a valuable player.   I think Rhodes' performance was top 10 last year. I think he has the tools to be a top 5 CB if things go well for him. I don't think calling him top 16 right now is too cynical myself, since he's had one average season and one good one."

That said, assessing the players' weaknesses is important. If the coaching staff can only see their strengths, we'll lose. Because other coaches are looking for any weakness to exploit. And every player has them.  I see no problem with analysts bloggers etc. writing about some areas our team and players struggle in.

minnesotavikings,3du0xu,ragnarockette,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:40:14 2015 UTC,"""most of that was Dogra""  ""wasn't at all his fault?""  I think his statement implies that AD had some culpability in the process, but also that he was being guided by a shady agent in Dogra.  And I agree with him.  I agree with you that AD likely wanted out, but I think any orchestration of that in the media was all Dogra.  I don't think AD is cunning enough to ask Dogra to do everything he did like it was all part of the plan (fighting with Spielman at the combine, refusing to meet Spielman at the owner's meetings, posting a FB photo of him wearing a Bucs hat while sitting on an AD jersey).  AD actively met Spielman and Zimmer, as well as the Wilfs.  Even after Dogra accepted that the Vikings were doubling down on their claim that AD wouldn't be going anywhere, he continued to try and strongarm the Vikings into paying more guaranteed money.  Although, I will say that my opinion is based on believing that Peterson isn't the brightest, and is willing to listen to whatever his agent will tell him.  If Dogra said, ""Hey, you know we can try to use this situation to your advantage.  We might even be able to move you to Dallas"", I can't imagine AD would have said, ""no, do everything you can to keep me in Minnesota,"" especially after expressing interest in finishing his career there.  Dogra knows the buttons to push, and AD was kind of a pawn in his greedy game.  That's just my opinion, of course.  I think if AD truly felt the way that he's been portrayed in the media, he wouldn't have shown up until camp, or later."
minnesotavikings,3du0xu,BigPaulAndy,4,Mon Jul 20 17:58:20 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, an agent's job is to take negative attention away from their client. If he was acting against Adrian's wishes he would have shut up pretty damn quick or been fired."

The actual team doctors that initially mis-diagnosed Bo's injury were interviewed, and the surgical team that performed the replacement were interviewed. They ALL AGREED that the initial injury was the root cause of the condition that led to the replacement. In fact, the Duke University Medical School wrote an article about this exact injury, and it cites Bo by name.  To sum up:   Bo Jackson DID NOT HAVE A PRE-EXISTING DEGENERATIVE HIP CONDITION PRIOR TO HIS SUBLUXATION INJURY. Bo Jackson suffered an injury that caused a hip condition that later led to his hip being replaced. Bo's hip did not ""shatter"" when he injured it initially -- this is 100% inaccurate."

That you're even asking this question means that you're ignoring the most OBVIOUS difference.  Bo Jackson was a two sport athlete.  Bo Jackson threw motherfuckers out from the warning track.  Bo Jackson broke bats.  Bo Jackson scaled WALLS.  He made the Pro Bowl and the All Star game in consecutive years.  Bo Jackson's feats sound imaginary- like a fucking tall tale.  He's on his own tier in his own world.  AD has done plenty of legendary shit, too, but comparing them is lazy and flat out wrong.

There have only been 5 players in NFL history to run sub 4.3, and that's in the past 10 years with all the improved training techniques. I have no doubt that the dude was damn fast, but he wasn't 4.2 fast, no way. Even Deion and Moss ran only 4.25 unofficials (which I'm assuming is somewhat faster than their actual times, even though Moss supposedly ""ran into the wind"")"

Everyone acts like favre ""won"" because they beat the packers twice in the 2009 season but he played another year after that that everyone just ignores."
minnesotavikings,3dsufs,Newport_100s,4,Sun Jul 19 19:47:27 2015 UTC,"He didn't fall flat on his face.

minnesotavikings,3dsufs,TheDandyWarhol,-9,Sun Jul 19 19:52:47 2015 UTC,"We disowned him because he tried to make himself bigger than the organization and was playing the retirement game which no fan of any team can justify. He was holding the organization hostage with that shit and he ""officially retired"" tears and all and Green Bay simply called him on his bluff. Obviously this was the right decision as we had an even better QB waiting in the wings. When he went to New York, no one cared, he still had plenty of fans in Green Bay. However, when he ""retired"" again for the sole purpose of going to Minnesota to try and get back at the Packers for doing nothing more than making a tough decision that he forced them to make then yes, he was vilified for that and rightly so. His entire tenure in Minnesota just reeked of someone who got dumped just trying to make his ex jealous and looking even more pathetic in the process since the ex had already moved on to bigger and better things."
minnesotavikings,3dsufs,Gway22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"We? More like you disowned him.  You're what,  in your mid twenties? Do you even understand what he did for your franchise? As a Vikings fan,  he's one of the main reasons I love football add much as I do and that's with him kicking our asses for many years. I get his retirement shit got old.  I understand that.  But the front office also didn't give him dick to work with for many years."
minnesotavikings,3dsufs,DropkickMikey22,-3,Mon Jul 20 05:34:44 2015 UTC,"Yes I absolutely understand what he did and that's why now that he's not in the jersey of a hated division rival that he was wearing purely out of spite he is welcomed back in open arms. No one cared when he went to New York, but when he went to Minnesota he got treated like every other Viking coming to lambeau and was booed, that's it. Still don't see what the issue is plus you say they never gave him dick to work with but the last year he was in Green Bay they were 13-3 and made it to the nfc title game with a team he himself called ""the most talented team he had ever been on"" so if part of his reason for leaving was not getting free agents years ago even though the team was elite then that's even MORE petty. The packers called his bluff and he did even more retirement bullshit to go to Minnesota strictly to stick it to the packers and somehow we are bad fans for booing him..lol okay. Plus if they had kept him they'd have neither him nor rodgers currently, it was one of the best decisions in recent sports history."

So exciting thinking about guys like Clemmings, Diggs, Kendricks, Crichton, McKinnon, etc. all developing further and hopefully earning contributing roles.  If our coaching staff can keep these guys improving this could be a really deep and talented roster."
minnesotavikings,3dsp7k,EarnestQuestion,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:48:23 2015 UTC,The only problem with so much young depth is having to sign them all once their contracts are up
minnesotavikings,3dsp7k,Newport_100s,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:55:54 2015 UTC,"Watching that aspect of it unfold will actually be really interesting. If the FO continues to conduct business as it has under Speilman/Brzezinski I'm not worried at all that we'll see the core guys taken care of - Harrison Smith next, Rhodes/Floyd to follow.   But then there are going to be some tough decisions. What do they do with Kalil? Or Patterson? Guys like Charles Johnson, Jarius Wright, Phil Loadholt etc. are coming up too.  This roster is becoming more like Baltimore's, where success in the draft leads to difficulty retaining all the talent as 2nd contracts roll around. Luckily we don't have that franchise QB contract on the books (yet :D), but even with guys like Robison and Wallace unlikely to remain on the team for long without restructuring we'll probably have to watch one or two guys walk. It's a little new and scary, but if it comes down to it it's a good problem to have. Given the work they've done since Zimmer came on board, I trust them to continue to stock up on guys who can come in and contribute"
minnesotavikings,3dsp7k,EarnestQuestion,3,Sun Jul 19 21:59:30 2015 UTC,"Having such a great coach really puts my mind at ease. It's nice to hear from Zim himself that he understands the concerns at offensive line. Well I know for sure now that he will be paying some extra attention to their work in training camp. If they can rebound this year, we will be very dangerous very fast."

minnesotavikings,3dsp7k,Newport_100s,2,Sun Jul 19 19:59:57 2015 UTC,"I would love to see some of the extra cap money go toward signing Evan Mathis. The guy would instantly make our o-line reliable by adding the best guard at his spot to the team and allowing Fusco to move back to right guard.  A 3 year contract for a guy his age who is somehow in the prime of his career doesn't sound so bad. This is all assuming he isn't demanding Steve Hutchinson money, but I would go for Evan Mathis on a $6-6.7M cap hit if it's possible. I really don't care if he burns out at the end of his contract as long as there's a good probability he plays at or above expectation for most of it.  Committing philosophically to building a ""young team"" through the draft is valuable once you have to start resigning guys after their rookie contracts are up, but we have until the end of 2016 to worry about Harrison Smith, and I think AP would agree to a restructured contract for a $9M cap hit if more guaranteed money and another year can be added. I'd love to see this team succeed in 3-5 years, but if it can succeed over the next 2 years with very little long-term risk, I would be all for it."

minnesotavikings,3drxqg,PortIslandStation,4,Sat Jul 18 21:45:01 2015 UTC,Yeah people take route running for granted. IMO it's the most important attribute for any wide receiver (aside from catching). Charles Johnson is an incredible route runner and his footwork on this route is unreal. That move paired with Teddy's pump fake would have probably faked out anyone on the league.
minnesotavikings,3drxqg,JTS2008,7,Sun Jul 19 00:27:56 2015 UTC,What a perfect step up by Teddy after facing pressure. The o-line was a litle fail there but eventually created a good hole to step into.
minnesotavikings,3drxqg,cadderly09,8,Sat Jul 18 21:48:38 2015 UTC,In that same Jets game there's another TD pass to Johnson(actually CJ12 fumbled it at the goal line and Felton recovered for the TD) where Teddy steps up into a DB and took a hard hit. By far my favorite Teddy pass. He didn't even flinch at the big hit and made a beautiful pass under intense pressure.
minnesotavikings,3drxqg,nautilusnautilus,4,Sat Jul 18 23:39:40 2015 UTC,"He just doesn't look as fast as he really is. It really doesn't look like he's moving that fast after beating the CB, but the CB isn't gaining, so he must be. You can really see the explosion in the first step downfield after the double move. I hope he improves his catch radius. Seemed like anything that wasn't thrown to his numbers wouldn't be caught last year."
minnesotavikings,3drxqg,ull90,3,Sat Jul 18 21:59:56 2015 UTC,Id consider that more of a stutter step than a double move
minnesotavikings,3drxqg,Newport_100s,5,Sat Jul 18 22:08:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I think that's pretty much the extent of a double move. He fakes like he's about to break off on a different route and then blows past the corner. I guess it's not a full-on fake like a corner-post or out-n-up, though."
minnesotavikings,3drxqg,ull90,3,Sat Jul 18 22:16:56 2015 UTC,"He looks a lot faster when you see he's winning the foot race vs Wright. Johnson's got legit speed. Both Wallace and Johnson are sub 4.40 runners. If Patterson could actually be good this year, we'd have our own poor man's 3-deep."

It's hard to have a superstar at every position, but finding depth through the draft is a real art in and of itself. It seems that whenever one of our starters go down, they're replaced with a guy who is just as able to execute the gameplan (except for offensive line, which doesn't count because no team has depth at offensive line). If you actually look at Spielman and his drafts, we have retained far more late round picks compared to other teams. Sure, we haven't hit on any Sherman-esque superstars, but we have found lots of talent that bolster this team so that it's not merely top heavy."

minnesotavikings,3dmhbj,aMinnesotaBro,14,Fri Jul 17 13:52:11 2015 UTC,"I'm genuinely curious if you actually think that? I thought the NFL had some of the most tests, guys are extremely aware at how detrimental steroids can be, and they wouldn't want to risk missing a season, etc.  I know there's still those few guys, but ELI5: Do NFL players actually use PEDs still and how would they not get caught?"
minnesotavikings,3dmhbj,PKS_5,48,Fri Jul 17 14:17:59 2015 UTC,I 100% believe the majority of players especially at the skill positions are taking illegal substances at some point during the year.   The NFL tests irrc are very easy to time so that you can cycle on and off and I just think it's something no one wants brought to light.
minnesotavikings,3dmhbj,ragnarockette,2,Fri Jul 17 14:23:55 2015 UTC,"I would suspect he's used steroids at some point. However he looks quite lean right now.   Loads of guys (and some girls) at my ghetto gym talk openly about their usage. When they're on gear they bulk up and gain body fat (and acne). Their torsos are much thicker as well. Then when they cycle off, they get this ripped look like AP.   I would guess he's probably not using currently, but probably did during his year away. Frankly, I don't give a shit as long as he doesn't get caught."
minnesotavikings,3dmhbj,agnostic_penguin,10,Sat Jul 18 15:27:19 2015 UTC,"The NFL does not have a truly random, extensive drug testing program. They have no incentive for doing so. They want to put on a good appearance, which is why the idea of drug testing basically exists. But it's really a sham. Everyone will know how to cheat it, and the NFL wouldn't want anyone to get caught really anyway.   Here's a few reasons why we can also be reasonably sure most players are using steroids:   1) Players have an enormous incentive to use. An incremental advantage is the difference between one million dollars and not having a career. What would you do?  2) Look at their body fat. As you age into your late 20s and 30s, it doesn't just become hard, it becomes nearly impossible to naturally maintain 3-5% body fat and still have all that muscle. ...unless you take steroids... or are literally a mutant like Bo Jackson or maybe Randy Moss...  3) You hear about these athletes gaining 10-20 lbs in an off-season? Look at them without their shirts on. A lot of them are still rocking 3-5% BF, even after putting on 10-20 lbs. That means all that weight put on was muscle. That's not just good. That's proof positive of steroid use.  For any athlete who has spent more than 1 year in a gym lifting, adding 10-20 pounds of muscle in an offseason is just flat-out impossible without steroids. An advanced athlete, putting on 5 lbs of muscle in a year would be considered nearly superhuman without steroids. 10-20 lbs is just comically absurd. There's no way that is legit. But you hear stories like that all the time. Here's one on Derrick Rose (NBA, but same deal): .  4) Go back through history and look at weight and height trends per position in the NFL. Certain positions, like WR, have changed quite a bit. WR keep getting taller and bigger. Why is that?  Well, it used to be that being tall and big meant you were also slow. So you weren't actually an ideal WR, even though you were a larger target. It was simply physiologically impossible to put enough muscle on their large legs to make them go as fast as a small guy. Too much leg, not enough torque. But steroids changed all that! Now you can get big guys with as much torque as you like. Now their long legs are an advantage instead of a problem. You remove the physiological limits of how much muscle can go on the leg with steroids. And now you have guys like Jadevon Clowney weighing 270 lbs and running a 4.53 40-yard dash. I can't point to Clowney and say he was using for sure. Maybe he's just a mutant. That happens occasionally. But when you look at all athletes? It's a sign of the times."
minnesotavikings,3dmhbj,PizzaCornerPizza,6,Fri Jul 17 16:25:16 2015 UTC,You do realize they aren't even close to 3-5% body fat right?
minnesotavikings,3dmhbj,agnostic_penguin,0,Fri Jul 17 18:53:06 2015 UTC,"Yikes. You're right. I was talking about bodybuilders yesterday with a friend and so I threw around the same numbers without thinking. You're right. For NFL athletes, it's easily twice that for a lot of the skill positions. For the linemen, it's obviously much higher.  I guess I'll still claim my point holds, because the BF% doesn't seems to change from year to year. I was just trying to cover my bases when I was making a particular argument. When athletes say they gained 10-20 lbs of muscle in an offseason, I believe them because I can see their chest and see it's not fat. On the other hand, when my neighbor says he gained 20 lbs of muscle this year, I know he's full of crap, because I've seen his definition, and he's just gotten flabby and puffy -- it's 20 lbs of mostly water and fat."

I have no problems believing that most NFL players are mutants and they work exceptionally hard."
minnesotavikings,3dmhbj,agnostic_penguin,5,Fri Jul 17 17:21:03 2015 UTC,"When I say ""mutant"" I mean exceptionally rare though. Like maybe one per generation rare. Bo Jackson wasn't just good. I don't think he had a slow twitch muscle fiber in his entire body. And every now and then a Jim Thorpe will come along, too. Guys like Ali and Jordan might have come from a different time, too. They were also loaded with talent. And running a fast 40 wouldn't make or break their careers, so there would be less incentive to use back then. So they might have been immune. But it's a different time now. I think you can use the mutant argument to explain a few cases. But I don't think you can use that to explain the overall trends that we see in sports, especially in the NFL.   Look at the Tour de France scandal. They weren't serious about anti-doping for a long time. But the French and other international teams finally got too pissed off at Lance Armstrong, so they went after the whole sport. Everyone of significance in the sport was found guilty. And that's just guys on bikes. Just think about all the additional money and pressure that guys playing the most popular sport in the US would face instead."

Especially in the first year of correct and consistent weight lifting. You sound like you're having a beginner's response, which is pretty normal. The thing is, after that, it slows down to about 1 lbs per month. Once you're more advanced, it slows down even more, to about half a pound per month. It only takes a few years to plateau.

Their organs LOOK different.  I don't disagree entirely with you.  If I took one drop of steroids one time, it would have no effect.  I could probably shoot heroin once a year with a physician's assistance and have zero long term effect.  But if you are regularly using steroids, even in ""prescribed"" doses, they most certainly have a negative affect on your body.  Basically all drugs are that way, but steroids are definately harder on you than, say, Ibuprofen."
minnesotavikings,3dmhbj,ballbeard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:06:44 2015 UTC,Some steroids are bad on internal organs.  I suggest you look up the differences between corticosteroids and anabolic steroids.  Prednisone is a corticosteroid and would not be used by athletes looking to gain an edge because it wouldn't do anything of use for them.  Vitamin D is also technically a steroid.  You can't compare the monitored use of anabolic steroids by professional athletes to your wife's use of prednisone because they are completely different things despite both being forms of steroids.  This is where the misconceptions come from

Watt looks like he would be using, but I highly doubt he is. These guys have amazing trainers, facilities, and amazing, legal supplements to take to help them get stronger.

minnesotavikings,3dmhbj,ull90,2,Fri Jul 17 19:06:08 2015 UTC,"It's not preposterous to say when there's no evidence he did any. The bad thing about it is that it makes the playing field unlevel. The richer players would get the better stuff. The players not making as much money either wouldn't get the same quality or wouldn't get any at all. It's not going to be ""if all of them are using, it cancels out."" No, it's going to be richer guys getting super high quality stuff and not as well off guys getting shit. I also hate the idea of athletes being enhanced. It's just not real. If Olympians were allowed to use PEDs, it would lose a lot of prestige to me. It'd no longer be about what humans can do alone, but what humans can do if you pump enough artificial shit into them. Why stop at PEDs? Why not try to make super-human cyborgs and watch them play football? I mean, it's be way cooler and obviously those guys would be much better at the game than mere humans on PEDs. It'd be the height of football!   I'm not one of the guys that just wants to watch primates hit each other while trying to get the ball to either end of the field. There's a reason the steroid era in baseball is shamed and Sammy Sosa, McGuire, and Bonds, etc., are bullshit. Players should not be able to just pay money to be able to play better. It's a stupid idea. We should just allow cheating? I can't believe how many people literally don't care that Rice used stick'um. I can't believe how many people would be fine with players using PEDs just because it could make for better players. Well, fucking of course it does. Just like if a baseball player used a non regulation bat. Yeah, it probably helps, but it's not ethical."

I also lived with some D1 athletes during college, and I don't know exactly how the NCAA does testing, but the scrutiny my roommates were under was crazy. As I don't see any numbers for the weight/size gains AP is making in the offseason (as opposed to the claims about NFL players in general),  and he always looks fucking heaven-sent, and part of his narrative has always been that he is awe-inspiring to other pros, doctors, and coaches in how hard he works and pushes himself every day, I feel comfortable believing he is clean. He is exceptional. No matter how tired people get of idolizing him and other athletes, it is true that he is exceptional, and his continued dominance and super-saiyan power levels can be explained by that."

minnesotavikings,3dos9o,p_U_c_K_IV,6,Sat Jul 18 00:46:43 2015 UTC,"I still believe in him. He's a good player when he's not injured. He's been injured the last couple seasons, so I can't really blame his lack of production solely on him.   How often does any TE get 100 yards in a game? I actually just looked up this question. Though I can't say what the average is, I can tell you that Tony Gonzalez leads all TEs in total 100-yard games with 31 in his career. His career spanned 17 years. For those keeping track at home, that's less than two 100-yard games per season (1.8). So, best case scenario, Rudolph would have about  six or seven right now (due to injury).   Gonzalez didn't have any 100-yard games through his first three years as a pro. He broke out in his fourth year with 6 100-yard games. The three seasons after that? Only one per year. In 2004, he broke out again with six. In 2005, none. 100-yard games are not easy to come by at TE. I don't understand why a lot of people are up in arms over him not having one.   Jason Witten, who I would say is the kind of player Rudolph could be, only had two through his first four seasons. The 100-yard game is a dumb measurement for a TE.  Edit: And these are two HOF-caliber TEs. An above-average TE like Greg Olson looks a lot different. Olson's first 100-yard game came in 2012, his sixth year in the league. Though we don't want Rudolph to be just above-average, we shouldn't be setting unrealistic standards for him. TEs just don't get 100-yard games often enough that it's a significant measuring stick.   TE production in the passing game, I think, is a lot more dependent on outside factors than WR production. WRs are always going to be targeted on passing plays across all offensive systems. TEs are often a checkdown and not usually the first read. Thus, I think they're also dependent a lot on QB play. Can the QB get through his reads and come back to the TE? I remember one specific play from 2013 where there was an obvious blitz coming from the LB who would have been in coverage on Rudolph had he not been blitzing. Ponder either didn't see the blitz or didn't know well enough to throw into the vacated space, where Rudolph was sitting wide-open.   In some offenses, there are TEs who are featured in the passing game. Take NE, SF, Denver, and (until recently) NO. NE split Gronk out wide to match up one on one as a split end against an LB. Vernon Davis has been used as a main weapon in the passing game. Julius Thomas and Graham, as well. Those guys get fed so many balls just because the scheme was tailored to them. Rudolph hasn't really had the benefit of the scheme until now. Turner has used the TE as a weapon for years now. He'll finally get opportunities other than in the red zone and on checkdowns.   Also, the argument that he's bad (or just not good or whatever the author was trying to imply) just because he couldn't build great chemistry with Teddy is very shallow. The author didn't even get to the spot in his thought process of ""I wonder why that might have been..."" If the writer had gotten there, he would have realized that Teddy had almost zero time working with Rudolph on the field either in-game or during practice. He was injured most of the time that Teddy could have been working with him. Prior to the season starting, Teddy wasn't getting many first team reps, so he wouldn't have seen him much there, either. When Rudolph finally came back from injury, he wasn't 100% and there's not much time during the practice week with which to build some sort of chemistry. This off-season, Teddy spent a ton of time with Rudolph, plus they'll both be getting first-team reps.   The reason Rudolph is getting more slack than Kalil is also really fucking obvious. The slack is also warranted. Kalil has had injuries, yet has still played every game during his decline. Rudolph has had really great moments and has done well when not injured. Not that the writer said it, but I hate when people say we brought in Pruitt as an insurance policy. He's not. He's a versatile player they brought in to create mismatches. He's going to be playing at FB and TE and moving around the offense to get one-on-one with slower LBs in space. Spielman mentioned in a presser that Turner really wanted a guy like Charles Clay and liked Pruitt for the job. That's Pruitt's fit."

Now that I'm a little older, and have more perspective, my father's blessing is the most important evaluation my relationship can receive."

minnesotavikings,3dmj96,nothinglikevinyl,2,Fri Jul 17 14:56:57 2015 UTC,I'd feel like your finance background would be enough to do that transition without an MBA man. Maybe we should chat?

I would expect that this ranking is him just doubling down on that assertion, believing that Bortles has all the physical tools to succeed and is likely to put it all together.  I completely disagree with him, but at least I can understand why he would put Bortles that high.  The Cassel one I also completely disagree with, but kind of understand, I think?

Paradocks had more Patriot fans, but I liked the setup the screens.  It was easier to follow multiple games.  The Green Turtle in Hampton had the most viking fans, and some chill Lions fans.  Sitting at the bar was better so didn't have to crane your neck, but it filled up pretty fast.  And, I was never really a fan of their food.  Those were my experiences anyway.  With all the military there, you are not alone in Viking fandom.  Hope you find em."

minnesotavikings,3djocg,JaquiskiTaterTartt,5,Thu Jul 16 20:32:18 2015 UTC,Great picks. Griffen is very underrated. Kudos to Slick Rick for finding so much talent for this team.
minnesotavikings,3djocg,LuckyNickels,4,Fri Jul 17 02:27:23 2015 UTC,"The big thing is we are hitting on a lot of top round talent, and developing the mid-late round talent at the same time.  Sure Khalil and Patterson aren't fully known yet, but Smith, Rhodes, Barr, Teddy, and Floyd are either all already bona fide studs, emerging studs, or in the case of Teddy and Barr look to be like they will be the real deal.  Then you got guys like Walsh, and Griffen who are dominating.  Plus a supporting cast such as J Wright, Rhett, Blanton, etc. who all are help in the team.    After that the lesser known guys like McKinnon, Cole, Hodges, who are all decent in rotation and are well liked by coaches.  I dont even want to get into the tier below that who are unproven guys with little to no playing time that out coaches/reporters talk well about as well, because they are numerous."
minnesotavikings,3djocg,Newport_100s,2,Fri Jul 17 02:38:59 2015 UTC,"This past draft they got plenty of projected hits as well. The Waynes pick was great, while the Kendricks one was among the best on Day 2. T.J. Clemmings and Stephon Diggs were Day 3 steals. Anthony Harris was also a nice pickup after the draft.  I wouldn't say Kalil and Patterson ""aren't fully known yet"" I'd say they haven't lived up to there potential. There is still time of course, but they have yet to prove themselves as reliable starters. They don't have anyone else that can step in at left tackle (I don't think Clemmings would be able to anytime soon), while receiver looks to be up for grabs, so they will both get at least this year."

What we're talking about here is rocket technology.  A technology used to successfully send thing into space in fact NASA first did it in July of 1950. https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_644.html  So we have a 65 year old technology that they as a private company are having trouble with.  This technology as you have said has caused deaths in the past the last one being January 1986 the Challenger launch by NASA, 29 years ago.  So you're comparing a NASA failure 29 years ago to one that SpaceX just had a month ago.  Pretty unfair comparison considering the advancements in safety and technology, which I guess makes SpaceX that much more incompetent was that your argument?  Especially since these private companies you are fawning over are not as good at putting rockets into space as NASA is.  ""The string of failures since October 2014 came after just one lost mission to the space station in the previous 16 years, a period in which more than 150 launches went up to build and outfit the complex."" http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/07/07/musk-falcon-9-rocket-failure-a-huge-blow-to-spacex/  In fact looking at all of the launches that SpaceX has done so far this year doesn't look so hot either.   January - Payload was delivered into orbit but then ""SpaceX attempted to land the first stage on a platform in the Atlantic Ocean, but the first stage crash-landed on its landing platform"" February - Launch successful rocket recovered after a water landing. March - Launch successful. April - Payload delivered but, ""First stage recovery failed; the rocket stage landed on the target drone ship too fast, tipped over, and exploded"" May - No launches. June - Complete failure rocket disintegrated including payload. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_in_spaceflight  Thats just the last 6 months not some event that happened 29 years ago.  I think SpaceX is a nice company and Elon Musk is a nice guy, but it is nowhere near the model of efficiency that you claim it is and desperately want it to be.  So no I am not uninformed and no I am not an asshole, I guess I'm just not into calling people names anonymously on the internet like you.  But either way at least you now have more information on SpaceX than you did before so maybe you won't make misinformed comments, then double down by insulting the person giving you correct information.  We're all just people on the internet dude, Skol Vikings."

You can bash them all you want but in no way ever would NASA be making the same strides  IMHO.  They are pushing for 100% reusable rockets... We are talking about a company that delivers cargo to the ISS by shooting a rocket in to the sky and delivering cargo by a robotic arm (this is all they are required to do... The next step they are just doing because they can)  and then trying to vertically land it on a drone ship so they can use it again.   And maybe just for fun, i would love you for you to show me a company that shows as much ambition and demonstrates the level of efficiency and innovation that SpaceX does because to be quite frank, That company doesn't exist. From Mars Colonization, To Reusable rockets (have you seen their Grasshopper rocket?!!), satellites.

It will give them money that they can use to buy things and people will spend their money in it to buy things. It will generate tax revenue. It will encourage business growth in the surrounding area. That will generate more business and more jobs and more tax revenue for the state. It will provide a lot of measurable, good things. Not just football.  What does New Horizons provide? Jobs to build the probe. Some pictures. Some data. And that's the end of it.

minnesotavikings,3di9ui,JohnathanTheBrave,6,Thu Jul 16 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, best case in my opinion would be: split with the packers, sweep the lions and bears (5-1), AFC West, I'm gonna chalk the Broncos up as a loss, and then split one of the games between KC/SD, beat Oakland (7-3), NFC West, lose to the Seahawks, beat everyone else (10-4), NYG/ATL, I think it's a split.

That being said, if everything clicks: Adrian Peterson runs like a monster, Teddy picks up where he left off with the last five games of the season, Mike Wallace is a monster downfield threat that opens of the rest of the field for our receivers, Zimmer's defense is as good as we expect it to be, we stay healthy, etc... our roster has the potential to give us a very, very good season."
minnesotavikings,3di9ui,pingpongguy,7,Thu Jul 16 14:44:20 2015 UTC,"8 or 9 wins would be my guess. I'd be pretty surprised if we got to 11, but it's possible if everything goes right. I don't think we'll finish with less than 7 unless things really go wrong."
minnesotavikings,3di9ui,WhirledWorld,5,Thu Jul 16 14:36:02 2015 UTC,"Offense  Teddy will take a step forward, as almost all QBs do, but I expect it to be on the Tannehill/Luck level, i.e. about 10 points up in QB rating (so ~95ish).  Teddy's accuracy is already there, but with Wallace stretching the field vertically, his YPA will go up, and with Rudolph and AD available as a checkdown, his TDs will go up.  And his INTs will go down just because so many INTs last year were bad luck.  Peterson will still be electric at times, but not 2012 level -- more like 2013 level.  So maybe 1300 yards rushing, 4.5 YPA, but an additional 500 yards coming from receiving.  Kalil will prove himself a bust this season, in part because his matchups suck so much, but also because his knee doesn't account for just how bad he was last year.  Patterson will also bust.  Neither will get new contracts, but Wallace and Charles Johnson will work out and soften the blow.  Our offensive line will be top 10 in run blocking, led by Phil and Sully (with Clemmings showing promise) but mediocre to bad in pass blocking (thanks to Kalil and Clemmings).  Defense  Kendricks will be a runner-up for defensive rookie of the year, looking like Bobby Wagner's rookie season but with some sexy pass deflections and an interception or two.  Floyd and Griffen will combine for 20 sacks, and Floyd will earn some pro bowl nods (if not a spot).  Barr will look only slightly better, still bad in run support but with some nasty highlight-reel sacks.  Rhodes will start earning media hype as he shuts down receiver after receiver.  Smith will earn second-team all pro behind Thomas.  Waynes will look bad at first, and casual fans will label him a bust after he blows coverage or doesn't get to the right spot on throws, but he'll show improvement throughout the year.  Overall, we have a top 10 offense thanks to AD and Teddy/Wallace/Rudolph/CJ, and a top 10 defense thanks to Floyd/Smith/Rhodes.  We go 10-6 with our schedule."
minnesotavikings,3di9ui,roberttatefan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:05:42 2015 UTC,"I like this analysis. I don't necessarily agree with every point but I think you'll be fairly accurate.   I disagree with the Kalil assessment, and also don't see Waynes making as much of an impact (even late) as you do, but do see a re-emergence of Munnerlyn in the slot and outside against smaller receivers. I think we will see the largest improvement in Teddy in his footwork, assuming he gets some semblance of a pocket. I also think we will see true contributions from Pruitt and Diggs throughout, which I didn't see mentioned.   Our D Line will be the surprise, with a lot of youth, talent and deep rotations mixed with some legit veteran talent.   My hailmary is that Greenway plays decently this year while getting healthy and splitting snaps with Hodges or Cole."

Vikes have 2 of the 3 teams (that I think will be tough this year) west division teams at home. (Seahawks and Rams. Chiefs and Chargers). So 5-6 wins against those teams.  3-4 wins in division. I think Falcons will take them in Atlanta but they should destroy the Giants.    Packers get 11-13 wins. They are 35-4 at home the last 5 years under Rodgers. They have the same favorable home game schedule against west plus their away game against the Broncos comes after a bye. So 6-7 win. Division 4-5 wins. Cowboys game is home. Panthers away could be tough so split. 1-1.    Lions are the biggest wildcard and have the unfavorable home/away schedule against the West teams. 3-5 wins. Probably 2-3 division wins. I think they will win 1 game max vs Eagles and Saints so 0-1 wins. So 5 to 9 wins.   Bears also have an unfavorable home/away schedule against the west. 3-4 wins vs the West. 2-3 divisional wins. I think they should be favorites against both Skins and Bucs so 1-1. So they finish with 6-8 wins

minnesotavikings,3dfoaq,nautilusnautilus,12,Wed Jul 15 22:15:52 2015 UTC,"So I'm like 90% on board with John Oliver on this one. I agree that the stadium designs are getting out of control, and that there are way too many unnecessary features driving up the costs of these new stadiums. For example, a stadium like NRG in Houston would cost roughly $486 million in today's money. And the profits for naming rights should be split at the very least.  One thing I don't agree with however is the concept that cities shouldn't contribute anything to the stadium's cost, at least in scenarios where they retain control of the stadium. I think that if the city is going to retain ownership of the stadium, charge rent, and use it on weeks it is unused, they should put down the amount of money they would pay for an event center(s) that would serve the same purpose. It's far from uncommon for cities to have event centers in order to attract prestigious events, and if the stadium is going to serve that function, then there's no reason for the owner of the team to front that cost.  Having said all of that, the main reason cities are losing money recently are because they are dishing out way too much money to build these mega palaces. Would any city ever approve a $500 million event center if a football team wasn't part of the deal? Probably not. So there's no reason for a city to spend that much money for an event center that's not even usable for 10+ weeks a year either. But a reasonably sized stadium at the same split would cost the taxpayers nearly half as much, which I think is reasonable given the utility the city could get out of it. For reference, the total cost of the Metrodome (construction plus infrastructure) was roughly equal to that amount in today's money, and the city got a positive return on that investment."
minnesotavikings,3dfoaq,joey_sandwich277,12,Wed Jul 15 23:45:10 2015 UTC,"10+ days a year, you mean."
minnesotavikings,3dfoaq,Jarl_Bridgewater,7,Thu Jul 16 01:31:32 2015 UTC,"Your NRG quote only factors in inflation and doesn't include stuff like the price of steel, which skyrocketed after 2001. It is starting to stabilize now, but it is still nearly twice the price it was in 2001."
minnesotavikings,3dfoaq,Remnants,3,Thu Jul 16 02:03:01 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I'd be interested to see a breakdown of the total costs. My understanding is that usually you end up paying more for labor than you do materials in large scale construction, but if the materials price has gone up significantly it could make a significant impact. That doesn't change the fact that teams are building larger (in terms of square footage, not capacity) venues with more high end seating, both of which I was led to believe were primary culprits of the increased cost. A new Metrodome with a better roof and more efficient floorplan would have been cheaper than what we built, but Zygi and the city wanted something that looked pretty and had plenty of suites."
minnesotavikings,3dfoaq,joey_sandwich277,3,Thu Jul 16 02:33:42 2015 UTC,"You also have to figure in the cost of energy efficient stuff (toilets, lighting, etc), which is quite a bit more expensive than the things that would have been used in NRG."
minnesotavikings,3dfoaq,nomaam05,3,Thu Jul 16 03:02:25 2015 UTC,"I think youre neglecting the two most important reason municipalities spend so damn much money on pro sports teams arenas: they have major marketing value, and they are considered a major amenity by the people with money that they are trying to attract.  So the value to the municipality is much more than just as an event center.  Nobody moves to Minneapolis over Sioux Falls because Minneapolis has a nice civic center.  But certainly access to amenities like night life, restaurants, and indeed pro sports teams weighs heavily on that decision.  Corporations and business also care about these things because it allows them to attract and retain talent.  I don't know what the right split is, but certainly there is a lot of competition between cities for pro sports teams which suggests that there is a good amount of pricing truth built in to all the proposals.  So I don't buy the argument that munis are paying too much for stadiums.  If they didn't think they'd see a benefit from them, then the market just wouldn't be there.  But it is, and I think if you could add up the true value of having a sports team on an entire economy you'd find that the cost is relatively cheap compared to the overall economic gains."
minnesotavikings,3dfoaq,deadjawa,2,Thu Jul 16 04:19:15 2015 UTC,"The only reason the state/city owns the stadium is because the owners don't want it. Owning a stadium comes with lots of expenses and liabilities. (property taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance).   Also leasing allows the team a tax advantage as they can write off the lease payments fully in the year they are paid, rather than depreciating the cost of the stadium over many years.   Also once the lease is up(or broken) the team can do whatever it wants with no liability for the old stadium. Sure the state might be able to break even as long as the Vikings are paying the lease, but after the lease expires the state still has all the operating expenses(an older stadium probably costs more to maintain)."

Anyways, for what it's worth, large industry and fortune 500 companies are great for a city to have around.  3M, best buy, Honeywell, they all get tax breaks that have added up over the years which greatly exceed what we have given the Vikings.  They keep 100% of everything.  It's true that we didn't pay for their facilities up front, but we did in the long run.  There's a huge bias against sports facilities because their only product really is entertainment.  But I argue that entertainment is, and always has been, just as important to society as industry.  For our sanity, our passion, its worth spending money on.  We don't technically need roads and cars, if people weren't so lazy they could bike and walk (fuck that right), but we spend money on it, not because we absolutely need it, but because it makes our lives a little better."
minnesotavikings,3dfoaq,MN_hydroplane,2,Thu Jul 16 05:31:29 2015 UTC,"The difference is that 3M, Best Buy, and Honeywell employ tens of thousands of Minnesotans who consequently feed the tax base. The Vikings don't."
minnesotavikings,3dfoaq,MR35,2,Thu Jul 16 14:05:15 2015 UTC,"That's a good point.  I'm not going to pretend I know much about the tax structure and how much of it is offset by income tax.  However, I do know that the majority of income tax would go to the federal governement (5-10% income based in MN vs. 10-35% income based Federal), whereas all of the property taxes go to municipalities, counties, and states.  That's why companies try to avoid them, because they are substantial.    The vikings do employe thousands of minnesotans and the players are required to pay significant state taxes because they work here (also property and miscellaneous taxes if they own property here).  Surprisingly, many of the vikings executives live here year round and they pay substantial taxes.  The vikings still pay property tax at Winter Park if I'm not mistaken, and everyone who works there is probably a Minnesota Resident (and even if they're not, they still pay income tax here for working here).  You can begin to see that although Honeywell, 3M, and Bestbuy employ more more people than the vikings, I think if someone actually took the time to do a tax breakdown (especially when you factor in that Bestbuy either rents, or pays no property taxes for their stores), you would find that Minnesota has basically given these corporations many billions of dollars over the years.  The Wilfs asked for 500 million."
minnesotavikings,3dfoaq,MN_hydroplane,0,Thu Jul 16 14:51:01 2015 UTC,"The vikings do employe thousands of minnesotans   Thousands? Maybe hundreds, maybe.

Ticket takers, security, concessions, janitors, maintenance, etc. There is no ""maybe"" that it's well into the hundreds. It's a maybe that it's in the thousands. But you can't sit here and actually question that they employ hundreds.   The minor league hockey team in my home town has, during a normal game, 50 people alone doing concessions, 10-15 cheerleaders, 7-10 people selling tickets, 20 ish people taking tickets, plus security, plus the team and teams staff, and untold number of maintenance people, marketing, social networking, management, etc., all for a 9200 seat arena.

And, actually, ""most Minnesotans"" aren't big Vikings fans and will never use the stadium.  The point is, things like light rail, the stadiums, etc., are investments.  Some will pay off better than others (most studies have shown transit pays off significantly better than sports stadiums), but in order to determine their worth, you have to examine their impact on their surroundings and the overall economy - not view them as a popularity contest."

Without a mass transit system, you're looking at an increasing amount of gridlock (which is really much more of a problem than just wasting peoples time) or expanding highway corridors, which in dense urban commercial centers is massively expensive.  Not to mention the maintenance cost of a roadway would be significantly higher, and we all love to complain about the condition of MN roads.  What you said just isn't true.  TL;DR:  There's a reason nearly every major city in the world has a   decent mass transit system."

minnesotavikings,3deqyh,jmcdon00,20,Wed Jul 15 20:55:21 2015 UTC,I think it was expected to jump when they landed the new stadium deal. Taxpayer money goes right into the pocket of a billionaire.
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,LuckyNickels,6,Wed Jul 15 18:54:39 2015 UTC,I just wish there was some kind of way that only people who actually have an interest in the team would pay for the stadium. There are tons of people who love the Vikes but plenty who don't and who don't care about sports in general. I'm uneasy with the fact that they have to pay for something that offers no benefit to them.
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,gerbs,11,Wed Jul 15 20:43:47 2015 UTC,"Except, they do benefit. People don't just go to a Vikings game, watch the game, and go home. They go to bars to watch the game, stock up on snacks at local grocery stores, they commute in and out, people come from out of town to see the games; All of which generates tax revenue that goes to the state and funds their roads and schools and generates income for the people working and running those shops.  When I lived in Duluth, I was paying sales taxes which fixed roads in the Twin Cities. Seems like bullshit. Except freeways in the Twin Cities are trafficked by semis carrying tons and tons (literally) of food from Hopkins all over the upper Midwest. Supervalu owns Cub Foods and many other brands and stores#Chains). So while I don't personally benefit every day from better roads in Hopkins, they do make it easier to get food to my door around Minnesota, and in turn, reduces the cost of getting the product to my table by reducing the cost of moving that food around.  That's just one example. So no, I don't buy ""I don't like sports, why am I paying for a stadium that I'm not using?"" because you're benefitting without even having to use it."
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,MightySasquatch,14,Wed Jul 15 21:11:13 2015 UTC,"All of which generates tax revenue that goes to the state and funds their roads and schools and generates income for the people working and running those shops.   Economic studies about the impacts of stadiums find little to no impact on tax revenues because of the substitution effect. People who spend at the stadium would have spent at a movie or theater or some other leisure activity instead, leaving tax revenues the same.   Although your example of Duluth and roads is a good one because there aren't really good alternatives to roads for long term travel."
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,nomaam05,2,Thu Jul 16 01:21:23 2015 UTC,"Sure sounds like those studies are missing a lot of key factors.   What about people from out of state that travel to see games? They get hotel rooms, visit restaurants and bars, use taxis or public transport, etc. Pro teams bring in massive tourism dollars. The vast majority of people coming from out of state to see games, aren't going to be traveling to Minnesota if the Vikings, Twolves, Wild, and Twins aren't there. You can't just factor in people that already live in the area. Sure, people from out of state aren't clearing a billion dollars in tax revenue a year, but it's not something that can just be dismissed.   And as I said about it earlier, every single player on the team (and probably the majority of coaches) are taxed at 10% and generated around 14 million in state taxes. If the team is gone, will 53 other people making between 450k and 12 million a year move to Minnesota to make up those lost taxes? Possible, but I highly doubt it, and there surely isn't any data to support such an idea.   Plus, more than just games are held there. 8 games minimum leaves a lot of time. All the people that will be coming in for the Superbowl, the final four, numerous concerts, etc,. There's a lot more going on than, ""People that live there would have spent that money if there weren't games"" could ever cover."
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,Riper_Snifle,4,Thu Jul 16 03:46:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly, for a game me and my wife will spend at the very least $500 in 1.5 days between tickets, hotel, booze, and food. On top of all of this, we're driving in from Iowa. We don't come to Minnesota to see the Mall of America, we come to see the Vikes."
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,MR35,-1,Thu Jul 16 04:59:41 2015 UTC,"Yea, and your experience is a tiny, essentially insignifigant part of the puzzle. Your $500 dollars in spending comes out to maybe $50 in taxes. Most Vikings fans are in state, and would have spent the money regardless."
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,Riper_Snifle,2,Thu Jul 16 15:03:08 2015 UTC,Assuming I am the only out of state fan then yes its miniscule.
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,kitkatbar,3,Thu Jul 16 16:56:32 2015 UTC,"There are a multitude of studies from different professors at different universities that agree that sports franchises don't in fact bring in tons of money for the city. So yes, they have considered the factors that you point out ,and no the economic benefits of 8 games per year and other events and the taxes of coaches and players are not even close to comparable to the $500 million paid by the city and state."
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,nomaam05,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:26:47 2015 UTC,"The tax dollars of the Vikings players salaries alone, damn near covered the cost of the Metrodome even after accounting for inflation, if not completely covering it. And their taxable income, plus everything else will most certainly crest 500 million in the life of the stadium, unless for some reason, they leave the stadium in 15 years or so, and it's not even logical to say otherwise. Even if the cap didn't raise ever again, the tax from player salaries would recoup roughly 140 million in state taxes each decade (plus any taxable revenues from game, plus taxable salaries for the rest of the staff, plus taxable revenue from all other events held there, plus taxable revenue from tourists). So I'll call bullshit that a ""multitude of studies"" have factored any of that in.  I've seen some of these studies, and they talk about economic growth, not tax return to the city outside of ""people would have spent that money anyway."" I'll gladly welcome any of these multitude of studies you've read that source taxable player, and staff income, as well as tourism dollars though, but I won't be holding my breath, because I sincerely doubt they exist."
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,MightySasquatch,2,Thu Jul 16 06:28:40 2015 UTC,"There was a comprehensive study of the historical impact of sports stadiums. It found that that sports stadiums have very little effect on the economy or on tax revenues. Likewise the substitution effect also applies for tourism, this has to be people who would not otherwise travel to the Twin Cities if not for the football stadium. And if they travel within the state they're not creating additional state revenue. And even if they travel out of state they're just taking state revenue from South Dakota and bringing it to Minnesota, which I guess is better but not by much.   There's also lost revenue from the property taxes that are not being paid. I'm sure player revenue and tourism add up to some amount of tax dollars gained but it's nowhere close to the amount of money the city has to put in it. And on top of it all in the Twin Cities they have 2 other places to host concerts so it is not like US Bank Stadium is going to be hosting a lot of revenue generating events.   Granted because Minnesotans didn't get a horrible deal it's not as bad as many other publicly funded stadiums, the state doesn't pay maintenance and still retains revenue from other events or sports there. But the impact is still minimal and certainly a lot less than what the state could get if they used the money elsewhere.   Don't get me wrong I love the Vikings and would absolutely hate it if they moved but I don't think the stadium deal is a good deal for the state. It's not but it's just kind of the price of having an NFL franchise these days, and football is so popular everyone is willing to compete to keep teams."
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,nomaam05,2,Thu Jul 16 04:12:01 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying, it has never been my argument that the economy will boom, or that income will increase or some shit like that.   That study seems to hamper on two things more than not: Local revenue, and contradictions. It reads like reddit, to be honest. ""Well I know a bunch of people said this, but I'm saying this, and not providing much actual data to back that up."" I mean, at one point it says the Superbowl brings no tax increase, at another point it says ""The results indicated that the Super Bowl did raise sales tax revenues in Houston, by about $4 million.""  My problem with the writing aside, they harp mostly on the local economy, and hinges on there needing to be a spike in the local economy. Why? Why does the local economy need to have a massive spike. What exactly is wrong with just earning that tax revenue back, and then some, over the next 30+ years? Just like a city doesn't need a sports franchise to have a good economy, they don't need a massive economical spike to have a sports franchise. More importantly, most of this seems to be talking about immediate impact, rather than long term revenue gains. You don't invest half a billion dollars in anything, and expect half a billion back right away.   Now, I will admit, I didn't read every single paragraph of that article yet, but I did notice a reoccurring factor: There is almost no actual data in this study. Maybe you've combed through the hundred odd references they have to fact check all of this to the best of your ability, but I'm not going to bother with that kind of time. So, you've now given me a paper that says ""It's bad, because these other papers say it's bad, even those these other papers said it's not."" That kind of stuff isn't changing my thinking in the least.    but I don't think the stadium deal is a good deal for the state   You are 100% wrong, IMO. I understand the argument that it's not good for the city, because it's a lot harder for the city to make back 150 million, than it will be for the state to make back 350 million. As I already pointed out, 14 million in state income tax from players alone last year. With an ever raising cap, that number goes up every year. Over the next 30 years, even if the cap doesn't go up at all, the Vikings players alone will have contributed 420 million in state income taxes. That's 14+ million dollars in taxable income every year that would not be there without a team there, and I don't think anyone can debate that. There's no way that can be seen as a bad deal."

But the point is that it's more complicated than that. The money that pays the players mostly comes locally either from money people spend at the stadium or through TV subscriptions which then pay the cable companies which then pay the NFL. The players pay income tax but they usually live outside the state so the money they are actually spending is mostly at home then in the area.   Meanwhile the money that people spend at the stadium is money they are not spending elsewhere. Meaning that other entertainers are no longer getting as much of an income or have to work somewhere else meaning they are no longer paying income tax or paying sales tax locally to the economy.   So you can't just take one facet of income tax and say that that money appears of out nowhere because it doesn't. It competes with other goods and services that already exist locally and thus doesn't bring that much additional money locally or to the state. I'm sure it does add some revenue (which is why there are 'contradictions') but all the evidence points to it being very small.   And even if it does bring in some tax revenue to the state, it draws it from other states. Meaning nationally it's just turning public dollars into private dollars. I realize we should focus on the effect on the state but I do think it's useful to examine the issue nationally as well.  Here's another good article on the subject,  http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/1997/06/summer-taxes-noll  I've seen a lot of historical studies of stadiums and their effect locally and on the state that all say low to no effect. In addition, almost all economists I've ever seen comment on the subject all have the same opinion, it doesn't do much for the economy or tax revenue. I think it's pretty clear where the evidence is pointed."
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,nomaam05,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:54:22 2015 UTC,"It doesn't ""do much"" for the economy or tax revenue? Why does it have to be some massive impact? This stadium could be there for the next century. A small change to anything over a long period of time, can't be summed up as not doing much. Just because the NFL says it will be a massive impact, and it turns out it's only negligible, it's automatically bad? And there are studies that say otherwise. That study you linked me, acknowledged those. Have you read them? Or do you get to PhD and just decide what they have to say doesn't matter?"
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,MightySasquatch,0,Thu Jul 16 18:35:22 2015 UTC,"They're not spending 500 million state and local they're borrowing 500 million and it's going to cost 20-30 million a year for the lifetime of the stadium so there isn't catch up to be had unless it generates 20 million in revenue for the local and state governments, or economic growth comparable to what the money could have accomplished elsewhere."
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,MR35,0,Thu Jul 16 23:33:45 2015 UTC,"Except all the studies cover the exact situations you are talking about as well. But I love how you dismissed the economic history research entirely without reading it.  Pro teams bring in massive tourism dollars.   Have any evidence for this? Because the studies don't show it. The studies also account for lost player/coach income tax, and the math still doesn't come out in favor of stadium investment."
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,jjspaceman,2,Thu Jul 16 15:05:26 2015 UTC,"The positive impacts of an NFL stadium are vastly over-rated. What seemed shady to me was the manner in which they pushed the stadium initiative through the government. My recollection is hazy at this point, but I recall something about circumventing a law that required that kind of taxpayer expenditure going on a ballot for the citizens to vote on."
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,Drewole,2,Thu Jul 16 02:53:06 2015 UTC,"I agree fully, but why couldn't there be some clause where, say, all concessions profits are paid to the state for 5 years after to help return some of the money that was fronted. This is just an example of how I am thinking.  Also to tag onto what you said, having pro sports teams may be viewed as an attractor to out-state businesses moving here as well as people."
minnesotavikings,3deqyh,nomaam05,3,Wed Jul 15 21:24:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, every player on the team is taxed 10% in Minnesota (any household making over like 250k a year), so that's already roughly 14 million going back to the state next year, and even if the cap number somehow didn't change for the next 30 years, the state will still see roughly 420 million from taxing players that wouldn't have been there otherwise. Of course, that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of sales tax for things like what /u/LuckyNickels  said. The non NFL revenue. Bars, hotels, grocery stores, etc, that will all see business specifically because a game is happening. And that's just for a minimum of 8 Viking home games a year. This doesn't factor in the endless number of other events or concerts that can be held at the stadium.  So, using concession profits may work, but there's no way the Wilf's would have ever went for that. I would imagine losing concessions money, particularity beer, would decimate any profit seen. This report says that on average, the NFL brings in 600K per game in beer revenue., which is 4.8 million over the course of 8 home games (and I can imagine since bud lights are running about 20 bucks for 4 ounces at games now, it's mostly profit). Take that away from Jerry Jones, and he probably won't bat an eye, but Minnesota doesn't make Cowboys profit. I mean, yeah, the Wilf's can afford it, but if you were a businessman that fronted over 500 million, would you want one of your most profitable things gone for the next 5 years?  Yeah, it kind of sucks that it will take a decade or more for the state to earn back their 348 million, but their going to make a lot more than that back when all is said and done."

The problem in general with trades is that beyond the actual trade value, you compare the scouting departments of the two teams.  As you can see in the Patterson trade, we got schooled.  Our team would be better if we had Logan Ryan and Jamie Collins last year over Patterson, but would we have taken them in those spots?  Now look at the trade that netted Exum, Sprull was ok when he started, but having a depth safety and a depth corner that are on special teams?  I'll take that twice every sunday.

minnesotavikings,3de3dw,Bigtiger27,15,Wed Jul 15 15:34:29 2015 UTC,No way the lions are above us. Painful != bad. The fact that the Vikings have had more success than the teams that will be above us is exactly why we should be higher.   Very few teams get punched in the gut like we do a couple times a decade.
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,vita10gy,34,Wed Jul 15 17:28:36 2015 UTC,What a joke. Vikings are the most painful team in NFL history. Period.  You need to be good (sometimes really good) to really crush the fans hearts.  The only other franchise that comes close is Buffalo with their four straight Super Bowl losses

minnesotavikings,3de3dw,MiatasAreForGirls,10,Thu Jul 16 06:07:21 2015 UTC,I thank my lucky stars every day that we're not Cleveland.
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,spokenflow22,5,Wed Jul 15 19:02:54 2015 UTC,The surest proof that God exists is that somebody must be up there messing with Vikings fans.
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,ApertureScienc,4,Wed Jul 15 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. Buffalo and Browns are the only team that can hold a candle to us. Buffalo though only had the 4 straight years of let downs. Vikings have had been consistent letdowns. My grandfather, father and me have experienced baffling let downs."
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,brick75,3,Wed Jul 15 22:26:01 2015 UTC,Bills have had success and fallen. The Browns though..they just manage to fall even further lol.

minnesotavikings,3de3dw,jjspaceman,22,Thu Jul 16 03:03:38 2015 UTC,"I must point out to you youngins. 98, and 09, are not the only Vikings heartaches. They are just the more recent. We lost to the Washington within a few yards of the winning touchdown as time ran out. Washington won that Super Bowl easily. Hail Mary anyone. Giants, 41-0.   This year will be different. We are at the beginning of a dynasty."
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,Deserveyourneed,8,Wed Jul 15 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"Nelson's catch would have only tied the game, if I'm told correctly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihXAHi0WM9U  Not that it makes the drop that much better. Some of my dad's friends saw Darren Nelson in a bar and asked him how we could drop that pass. He said, ""I don't know man. I think about it every day.""  << Now, that's REAL Vikings heartache there!"
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,jpkjpk,6,Wed Jul 15 17:09:10 2015 UTC,John Randle says he thinks about the '98 every day too.   The pain really gives us a unique bond with our players that other fanbases can't really fathom.
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,LuckyNickels,2,Wed Jul 15 20:46:00 2015 UTC,"I actually forgot how it ended, just how close it was. I went back and watched the last two minutes, painful."
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,Deserveyourneed,0,Wed Jul 15 22:39:52 2015 UTC,Your dad needs new friends. What a bunch of dicks.
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,heaintheavy,6,Thu Jul 16 03:47:43 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the tweet only mentioned '98 and '09.  In his article he also references: the superbowl losses, the trade, wrong way marshall, '00, the hailmary game, and '05 love boat."
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,prozach64,10,Wed Jul 15 17:18:50 2015 UTC,And they didn't even mention Korey Stringer. :(

minnesotavikings,3de3dw,imhereforthevotes,6,Thu Jul 16 02:25:59 2015 UTC,41-0 never happened. I have no idea what you're talking about.
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,youvebeengreggd,3,Wed Jul 15 17:44:34 2015 UTC,I think the reason the '98 season was the worst is it was suppose to be redemption for all of the previous bad times Vikings fans endured. It was the chosen season to end the decades of heartache.
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,CampBenCh,2,Wed Jul 15 20:49:17 2015 UTC,I think almost enough time has past for me to go back and watch the 2000 Giants game. Because from memory...what the fuck happened??? We get a glimmer of suggestion in this article but it can never be just 1 player when the loss is that bad...hellllooo offense???
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,Calendar_Girl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:16:36 2015 UTC,Basically what happened to the Broncos.  Shit went bad and just spiraled out of control and the players were shocked and no one ever got their heads back into it.
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,Crime-WoW,7,Thu Jul 16 02:47:18 2015 UTC,"We should be number 1 by a landslide. Other franchises suck more but we've always been good enough to give you hope just to destroy that hope.  98 and 09 I cried like a baby. I had already sent out the super bowl invitations in 98. The years after were almost as hard because you had that hope they'd be just as good.  The Hail Mary so named for the pass to Pearson where Pearson pushed off the Viking corner to catch that ball and win. Guy in the crowd threw a bottle of Jack and hit the official in the head for the missed call. My dad was at a hotel in Minnesota and after that call the guy above his room threw the hotel TV out the window.  Giants 41-0 in 01' when they cheated.  Hershel Walker trade  4 super bowl losses along with that last Oakland loss. There's a man whose probably still alive who decided to stop shaving until the Vikes win a super bowl after their first loss.  The Washington loss as mentioned by someone else here  The list is long and all of them hurt more than the Bills, Browns or Lions because those were years where we were one of if not the best in the game and got robbed and had our hopes destroyed."
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,jfolstrp,7,Wed Jul 15 18:08:04 2015 UTC,There's a man whose probably still alive who decided to stop shaving until the Vikes win a super bowl after their first loss.     He died. http://deadspin.com/old-guy-who-refused-to-shave-till-the-vikings-won-a-sup-1452348322
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,ApertureScienc,2,Wed Jul 15 19:43:20 2015 UTC,"We have one of the best winning percentages and post-season appearances in the league, so yeah, i'd say that statistically shows we have more heartache."
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,jjspaceman,-3,Thu Jul 16 03:06:04 2015 UTC,We should be number 1 by a landslide. Other franchises suck more but we've always been good enough to give you hope just to destroy that hope.   Ever think that is because the delusion of the fans? I mean top comment right now is talking about the current Vikings dynasty when they have one playoff win in the last 10 years.   Not saying they can't become one but Viking fans are already so hopeful this team is a dynasty when they have done nothing.
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,LaCW09,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:46:49 2015 UTC,Maybe not now or even recently but historically we've gone top 10 in wins and have been pretty competitive

minnesotavikings,3de3dw,Hammerthegunner,5,Thu Jul 16 01:54:24 2015 UTC,For me 98 will always be the most painful because that was the year my casual fandom became full on.  Watching that team play was something else and we were deprived of more. Do we have a name for the curse? Like curse of the bambino...a real karma explanation? Then I can know what we have to do to break it and if I can get my hopes up about the new crew.
minnesotavikings,3de3dw,Calendar_Girl,6,Wed Jul 15 17:18:59 2015 UTC,Take it from a Red Sox fan - please don't name the Vikings' curse.  Just pretend it doesn't exist and eventually we'll break it.

minnesotavikings,3djaly,Deserveyourneed,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:39:58 2015 UTC,"The same still applies, either way. I would say that I expect he will be in the running. But he could have a good season, one we are delighted with, and still not win. If another coach has a bigger impact. Right now, a lot of people expect us to have a good season. Partially because of new players, partly because of Zimmer. So if we have a good season, because Patterson, Waynes, and Clemmings  all do really well, then the credit will be split between Zimmer and Spielman. However if Chicago has a great season, I think that they say, Fox turned it around in one season with essentially the same crew.   The bottom line is, it depends on how we do, and how much credit goes to Zimmer. And if another coach that no one expects to win does."

I'm still pissed off at myself for defending the dude.  edit: Oh, and lets not forget that he admitted to having knowledge of a statutory rape committed by members of the team and was trying to use it to blackmail the front office while Twitter ranting like a fucking child.  edit2: I'm still shocked how many people here actually like the dude after all the shit he tried to pull on the team.

minnesotavikings,3demw6,ThreeDeep1998,2,Wed Jul 15 23:09:43 2015 UTC,Kluwe making light of the rapes at Penn State was equally stupid. It's almost as if locker rooms generally contain off-color jokes.  No one is saying Jeff Locke is good.

If that offended some people, then yes, I'm sorry for offending those people. I realize some people may not like that sort of humor. If it comes to speaking truth to power, standing up to blind fanaticism, that's what I'm going to do."""

minnesotavikings,3demw6,ThreeDeep1998,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:32:24 2015 UTC,"Not being on Kluwe's side did not mean you didn't support gay rights. Minnesota had gay marriage legalized since 2013.  He was being a hypocrite because he had an off color joke directed at him and took it extremely personally. Like Priefer really wanted to nuke the gays. Oh, but he can make those kinds of jokes about college rape (of guys its ok to make fun of right?) and that's completely okay.  Again, I'm pissed at myself for actually defending the dude.

The NFL is a business, Kluwe certainly didn't get that memo."
minnesotavikings,3demw6,emersonlakeandlagoon,7,Wed Jul 15 20:23:52 2015 UTC,None of that really has anything to do with him playing a card game.

Are we just forgetting that this is the guy who tried to blackmail the Vikings(aka OUR FAVORITE TEAM) after he was released for being an overpaid, underachieving punter(dude couldn't even get a job with the Raiders and their punting situation was HORRIBLE). Are we just forgetting that this is the guy who made fun of the molesting @ Penn State? Oh and don't even bother copy and pasting his weak ass excuse to cover his ass.

And if you read the article you'd have read the part where they plan to get in touch with Mayweather in the future for additional training advice and ""more mentoring"".  So his concerns are legit. Maybe your dissenting opinion could be a little less standoff-ish?"
minnesotavikings,3dcyu0,0dde0,3,Wed Jul 15 14:30:15 2015 UTC,"They are going to ask a great athlete, for training and athletic mentoring. No where in this article does it say they are going to him for life advice, or how to get away with beating their girlfriends.   I'm not saying Mayweather's not a dick, but this guy is very obviously here just to shit on Mayweather. Them going to his gym, and asking him for training and conditioning advice, in hardly even news worthy, let alone an actual issue."

minnesotavikings,3dcyu0,nomaam05,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:45:42 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with you.  It's definitely not an issue that needs concern, although I don't think he's here just to shit on Mayweather. His first comment was that he's not sure how to feel about this, and I kind of agree.  There's a ton of great athletes to get training advice from (Adrian Peterson anyone?) so maybe don't pick Mayweather I guess.  Like you said if it's just for training advice then cool.  But the inclusion of the word ""mentoring"" does imply more than just how to run faster and jump higher.  It's typically reserved for teaching people how to conduct themselves in their business and personal endeavors.  So, if TMZ said it then whatevs, they've proven time and again the skill with which they operate.  But if Trae said it..."

minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,Dymobe,8,Wed Jul 15 17:26:56 2015 UTC,No. Great for him. But he rubs a lot of people the wrong way from time to time. You can't honestly tell me that Carter and a guy like Bridgewater get along with everybody the same way. Carter pushes people's buttons from time to time.  I was under the assumption that this was well documented and agreed upon.

He had a lot more time as a Viking, played more games, had more TDs, more yards, more catches, etc, for the Vikings. While Moss goes down as a better WR than Carter, Carter takes the nod for being better for the Vikings."
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,nomaam05,3,Wed Jul 15 07:43:17 2015 UTC,Carter got the short end if the stick playing in our run dominant offenses in the 90s. Put him in a system like the 9ers had and I truly believe this conversation is a different one.
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,TheAesir,3,Wed Jul 15 11:35:13 2015 UTC,Lol didn't he gave like 120 catches one year?
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,kranzb2,6,Wed Jul 15 11:50:05 2015 UTC,at one point he held the record for most catches in a single season.
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,djzenmastak,5,Wed Jul 15 11:57:08 2015 UTC,"Moss. Watching him was just so exciting, Carter moved the chains, but Moss changed the outcome of games with a couple plays"
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,Zepher2228,5,Wed Jul 15 12:14:30 2015 UTC,"Personally Carter was my favorite Viking.  He could catch anything, and would play at the top of his game every week.  Moss... like he said he played when he wanted to play.  If he had the work ethic of Carter he would have surpassed him.  (note: Vikings Carter, not Eagles Carter)  The things Carter could catch and his sidelines awareness are unparalleled.    That being said, at no point in his career could he compete with Moss in pure speed.  Moss could also catch everything nearly as well as Carter.    I'd say Cris was more valuable overall though.  Consistency has something to be said for it."
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,D_Odinson,2,Wed Jul 15 04:19:46 2015 UTC,"I'm an Ohio State fan and a Vikings fan, so Cris Carter was the best combo while I was growing up.  I have more memory of Moss, but I really love seeing buckeyes play for the Vikings."
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,Sometimeswelose,2,Wed Jul 15 11:19:31 2015 UTC,"I think you could argue that without Carter, Moss could have been a failure. Cris was Randy's mentor, and kept him from getting into trouble and making bonehead mistakes like the ones he made in college. For that reason alone I would have to say that Carter was much more valuable to us."

minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,djzenmastak,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:58:36 2015 UTC,"There really is no wrong answer. We love both of these guys to death and it was amazing to get the chance to see them play together.   I would give a slight edge to Carter because the level of quarterback play improved when Moss got here (independent of Moss' effect on it, which was of course very positive as well) while Carter put up amazing numbers suffering through the Sean Salisburies and Rich Gannons of the world."
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,LuckyNickels,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:39:31 2015 UTC,Moss. My first Vikings game was home opener September 98 against the Bucs when Moss made his debut. He came into the league as a rookie and destroyed it. He changed the way teams played defense. I'm not knocking down Carter because he was a great Viking as well. I just love how Moss made fast players look slow.
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,doublea08,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:58:19 2015 UTC,"Loved them both, but there was just something about Moss when you watched him.  Like everytime Cunningham or Pep would drop back and just launch the ball out of frame, I would slowly get out of my seat yelling ""oooooooh"" and then just erupt in joy when Moss came down with it on the other end.  He made the deep ball fun again! He changed the way defenses covered the field.  In a way he made WR being THE position kids wanted to be when we played in the back yard."

Carter I loved, have a jersey too. BUT, his last two years were nothing but a huge retirement distraction. Then he didn't retire anyway. Robert smith on the other hand retired with class."
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,RynoRama,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:31:58 2015 UTC,"https://youtu.be/OWmR3kltOsA  Randy was best. Carter was a beast, but I'm a believer that a motivated Moss was better than any WR to ever play. Including Rice."
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,Vinniemack84,0,Tue Jul 21 18:29:21 2015 UTC,Chris Carter in my opinion played for the team Moss played for himself
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,Crazygluegun,-6,Wed Jul 15 04:28:24 2015 UTC,"first off it's CRIS...jesus christ.    secondly, what does this comment even mean?  like honestly.  you have no secret window into either of these men's minds.  both players are all time great's and made all types of great football plays.  way try to pigeonhole them ?"
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,dacarpenter,3,Wed Jul 15 08:20:16 2015 UTC,It was just a fun question... calm down. So sorry that you know how to spell his name better than everyone else. You are so brilliant.

I thought it was a fun question and most people's opinions were at least based in some sort of reality.    The guy above just decided to pull some stupid shit out of his ass and I decided to point that out....do you honestly think that I feel smarter than people because I know how to spell cris?  Fuck off.
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,ull90,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:45:06 2015 UTC,"I've got to say Moss. I love his story and the fact that, considering his attitude, background and approach there are lots of people who say he never should have made it in the pros. And yet here we are."
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,IamTrogdor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:06:25 2015 UTC,"I'd go with Carter since he was here longer and seemed to be more of a team player. Moss was more explosive, though, and probably more talented than Carter in every area of the game besides, maybe, hands and body control (but he was really really close to Carter in those areas, too)."
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,vita10gy,2,Wed Jul 15 05:24:33 2015 UTC,There would be no Moss without Carter

minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,drawingdead0,9,Wed Jul 15 03:23:24 2015 UTC,It's probably not actually true.
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,drawingdead0,3,Wed Jul 15 03:24:24 2015 UTC,"Carter was already elite. Think about if the Lions drafted OBJ. He was already good on the Giants, but with CJ next to him he would have broken records. How does a defense even begin to cover that? Now, Moss probably would have been an all time great regardless in my opinion, but Carter made that offense special."
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,Zepher2228,2,Wed Jul 15 03:28:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've heard the OBJ-Randy Moss comparisons. It seems pretty apt, because Moss took the league by storm like OBJ posting similar stats."
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,awolf97,6,Wed Jul 15 03:32:42 2015 UTC,"OBJ is no Moss, let's be clear about that. He's very good and looks to be elite for a long time, but Moss changed the way defenses played."
minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,gradual_alzheimers,3,Wed Jul 15 03:39:42 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if that is how I came off as. I know Moss is on another totally new level, but I was just talking about their rookie seasons."

minnesotavikings,3dc6xz,gradual_alzheimers,2,Wed Jul 15 12:12:26 2015 UTC,"with CJ next to him he would have broken records   Well, he would've broken records had he played 16 games. Didn't need anyone next to him to do that."

That said, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em - and methinks the image of a clean cut guy like Teddy is good for the image of the game and I think we might start getting the same treatment real soon."

minnesotavikings,3dc4ms,SergeantFartbox,2,Wed Jul 15 04:14:26 2015 UTC,"I went once in 2004 and another in 2007.  Neither experience was that bad for me.  The first was with my then-girlfriend, my sister, and her boyfriend (a Packers fan).  Then-gf was from Texas and wore flip-flops to a game in November.  We had to buy her Packers socks from the team store and left early because she claims the old couple behind her were calling her a retarded slut, but she was manipulative and lied a lot.  I didn't hear anything.  I still had a good time.  Second time was with a high school friend of mine, road tripping from Minneapolis.  We went to a gas station to pick up a six pack right outside the stadium, parked our car, and found another group of Vikings fans tailgating (who yelled at us ""COME HERE!  STRENGTH IN NUMBERS!"").  Slammed our beers, went inside.  Packers fans were fine, for the most part.  Maybe one or two had some genuine hostility, but for the most part it was a joking, light-hearted ""boooo,"" and I'd sing ""why can't weee be friends!"" and they'd start laughing.    Honestly, the worst fan at that game was a Vikings fan seated behind us that was like 45-50, hammered drunk and driven his RV with a few buddies from Minneapolis.  He started telling my friend that he was an upstanding young guy, should come work for him at his dealership, and meet his daughter ""instead of that dumb nigger she's currently with.""  He was barely standing when the game was over and said he was driving all the way back to Minneapolis that night.  Not a cool guy.  Packers fans sitting next to us were actually pretty cool to talk to.  Both times was wearing full Vikings gear; Darren Sharper stuff in 2007.  I'm assuming things haven't changed much in the last 10 years, but your life won't be in danger no matter what you wear.  You'll run into a few assholes, but as long as you're not confrontational yourself and you just joke around with people, you'll be fine."
minnesotavikings,3dc4ms,BrownianNotion,2,Wed Jul 15 11:57:56 2015 UTC,I've been and there are a lot of vikings fans that make the trip.  That was even a down year.

Be nice to us, and we'll be nice to you. It's the loud and obnoxious visiting fans who usually get the heat. I've had countless intelligent, fun conversations with visiting fans. I've also had a few mean visiting fans, but I've also set straight a few mean Packer fans when they cross the line. There's jerks everywhere, including Lambeau.

We were all big football fans so took in 2 games that weekend.   Cardinals @ Packers on the Sunday and Patriots @ Vikings in MNF the following day.   Packers won and Vikings lost so it wasn't a great weekend - other than the copious amounts of food and alcohol.

He also compared relatively well to Tom Brady during his first full campaign in 2001.       during the final five weeks of the year, the 22-year-old was the league's second-highest-rated qualified passer, behind only Romo      Among quarterbacks with at least 25 red-zone pass attempts,Bridgewater led the NFL with a completion percentage of 73.1 inside his opponent's 20-yard line. His touchdown-to-interception ratio under those circumstances was 9-to-1.

PFF deemed Bridgewater to be the third-most-accurate passer in football, and had he thrown enough passes beyond 20 yards to qualify, he would have ranked seventh among 25 quarterbacks in terms of deep accuracy.       PFF deemed him to be the most accurate qualified passer in the league while under pressure.       Bridgewater ranked fifth in the league in (depth adjusted completion percentage)  (+3.6%), well ahead of fellow youngsters like Wilson (+3.3%), Tannehill(+2.6%) and Luck (+1.5%)."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,pingpongguy,6,Tue Jul 14 16:23:54 2015 UTC,I just went from 6 to midnight.
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,skinnyKss,34,Wed Jul 15 06:06:53 2015 UTC,Teddy is the next elite QB in my opinion. Dude can ball.
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,FinsFan93,10,Tue Jul 14 14:30:30 2015 UTC,"Teddy could become great, but he does have physical limitations that make me skeptical. Some people grow stronger, like Tom Brady with his arm strength (which, still never became great, became satisfactory), and some people don't.  Right now, Teddy is potentially on pace towards being in that 2nd tier of QBs: below Matt Ryan, but above Joe Flacco (which doesn't mean anything if you think Flacco is better, but it basically means that he could be among the 6-11th best QB).  I love Teddy, but when Manning, Brady, and Brees retire, and Rivers and Romo decline, it's going to be Rodgers, Ryan, Wilson, and Luck that make the next wave of elite QBs, I think."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,Staple_Overlord,27,Tue Jul 14 15:37:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, I really don't think his arm strength is going to hold him back at all. He was clocked at 54 mph last year, which is only 1mph less that Wilson, Flacco, and Winston. The highest ever recorded is Logan Thomas at 60mph; most guys with 'cannon arm' label are anywhere from 56-59. A lot of prospects throw in the high 40s - low 50s.   I'm certainly not ready to label him the next 'elite' QB just yet, but not because of any physical limitations."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,pingpongguy,0,Tue Jul 14 16:32:07 2015 UTC,"Sure, he can throw hard when in testing, but in games, he just doesn't. Even when he needs to get the ball there quickly because he was late on the timing, he still lets it float. This INT vs the Bills is a perfect example.  It's pretty much a fact that Teddy does not throw the ball with much velocity in games. He needs to work on that. Because some throws requires the QB to throw on the rope and have perfect anticipation. If he can't get better, then arm strength will be a limitation, and there will be some throws he simply can't make unlike the Aaron Rodger's of the world."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,Staple_Overlord,21,Tue Jul 14 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"That throw was also late. He improved on that throw a lot. It's basically the same throw he made on the touchdown to Jennings at Miami. That time, he ripped it before Jennings  made his break. He's getting there."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,ull90,2,Tue Jul 14 18:07:23 2015 UTC,"He certainly is getting there. But on the mental side. Which leads me to say that I think people are misunderstanding me. I value anticipation more than arm strength. But when you are talking about elite players, either they are elite at everything (Rodgers), or they are GOAT at one thing and great at everything else (current Manning)."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,Staple_Overlord,10,Tue Jul 14 18:41:02 2015 UTC,"I think he's shown pretty decent arm strength. I think his potential is more limited by his throwing mechanics. If his mechanics don't become better and more consistent, balls will continue to sail on him. Arm strength will come with better mechanics, too, and I think it's pretty much adequate right now. I think he just needs to keep learning when he needs to rip it. It's not college anymore. You can't throw late and you can't float the ball unless it's like a go route. There's still room for growth in arm strength, but I don't think it's the thing that will hold him back."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,ull90,9,Tue Jul 14 19:21:03 2015 UTC,Current Manning's arm strength is a far cry from great
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,EarnestQuestion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"It's true. Based off of the 2nd half of the season, Manning might be on that decline where we might not be able to call him elite at the end of this next season. Only time will tell."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,Staple_Overlord,7,Tue Jul 14 19:12:36 2015 UTC,"We're not projecting into the future, we're talking about right now. Current (2014) Manning's arm is far weaker than you're claiming an elite QB can have.  This arbitrary definition of elite as GOAT at one thing and great at everything else just doesn't hold water."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,EarnestQuestion,2,Tue Jul 14 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"Okay, it doesn't hold water to perhaps the greatest QB of all time who did happen to have great arm strength in his first 10-15 years in the league.  Needless to say, there is a lot that has to be right with a player to consider him elite. I don't even see how this is an argument. You're just disagreeing with the minor details, not the point.  The point is: There is so much Teddy has to improve upon to become ""elite"". Having lacking arm strength will hinder earning that title. Is that so outrageous?"
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,Staple_Overlord,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:29:52 2015 UTC,Late and a bad decision - excellent coverage by the corner. Teddy should have checked it down there
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,EarnestQuestion,3,Wed Jul 15 18:58:07 2015 UTC,Teddy's still 21 and admittedly pretty scrony. I think as he ages and goes through more seasons of NFL strength training he'll bulk up and get a little more zip on the ball. Drew Brees has pretty meh arm-strength and I'd call him elite. I think Teddy has all the physical tools Brees does (while being a little taller) so I don't think there's anything physical holding him back.
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,dis_what_I_say,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:00:20 2015 UTC,"Brees has the whole ""most accurate QB of all time"" thing going for him. It's too early to say that Teddy will become GOAT at any trait in particular. Because in order to be elite, you are either great at everything, or GOAT at one thing and very good at everything else.  I'm just saying that Teddy has a long ways to go. If he truly was ""an NFL ready QB but with a low ceiling"", then we are in trouble. I scoffed at those critiques, but it is still something to keep in mind."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,Staple_Overlord,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"Well, doesn't Teddy sort of have the ""most accurate 21 year old of all time"" going for him?  Maybe if he progresses the way other great QB's have, he can become the most accurate ever?  Just a thought."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,sand0789,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:39:00 2015 UTC,Teddy was the best in the NFL in the red zone with 9to 1 touchdown ratio and 73 % completion percentage. As a rookie I call that Goat.
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,Independentthought0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:35:28 2015 UTC,"We'll see in time, but I think that Teddy can still develop his arm strength somewhat, the kid's young.  If he's still throwing floaters in year 3 and 4 I might be a little worried."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,armetheus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:00:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree he does tend to float it. That bills INT was atrocious; maybe his worst play of the year.  Still, I think he does throw with good velocity from time to time as well. His first preseason throw had good velocity ~25 yards downfield. Just one I remember off the top of my head.  So I think it's more of a mental/mechanics thing than a physical limitation per se. He needs to learn to throw with velocity in game with a lot more consistency, and who knows if he will, but physically he is capable of doing so."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,pingpongguy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:02:01 2015 UTC,"Kurt Warner was working out with several of the rookie prospects and he said he never once in an NFL game through as hard as he could. It's all about timing and I personally think Teddy is especially good at timing. I good deep ball is not 60 yards it's 25 to 35 yards on time as the receiver first breaks behind the receiver , Charles Johnsons touchdowns against the Jets and I think it was the Bucs are great examples of this."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,Independentthought0,7,Wed Jul 15 04:59:05 2015 UTC,"What specific physical limitations does he have that will hold him back?  He's put multiple balls 50+ yards downfield in the NFL, and today has as much mustard on his deep out as Drew Brees ever has. He's proven his arm strength is just as adequate as Brees or Brady's.   Is there anything besides strength/velocity, which he's proven to be adequate - just not panty-wetting - that will prevent his growth?  I don't know whether Teddy will be an elite QB, and this isn't even about him in particular. I'm just sick of seeing this argument made about the QB position at all.   Year after year the elite QBs prove that what makes them great are their decision making, pocket presence, and accuracy; year after year the 6'5 gods of thunder prove they are only as good as they are at those things.  Teddy only has adequate physical traits for the NFL, and he'll have to be great at the intangibles if he's going to rise to that elite level of play. The same is true of Cam Newton. Of every QB in the league. Five years from now, whether Teddy's the best QB in the NFL or Christian Ponder's backup, it won't be because of 'physical limitations,' it'll be a result of how developed he is (or isn't) at those factors which truly determine QB play."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,EarnestQuestion,3,Tue Jul 14 17:57:45 2015 UTC,"Well, we flat out don't know if Teddy will grow or not. Some players simply don't improve the way you want them too. And some even regress despite being smart, hard working players (eg. Christian Ponder).   Teddy's arm strength is currently lacking. He can overcome this by having excellent anticipation. In fact, I'd rather have anticipation than arm strength, because those QB's don't throw awful passes as often (eg. Colin Kaepernick). But if Teddy doesn't develop the way we want to, then that will be an issue. I think it's highly unlikely that he won't improve, but I don't think it's reasonable to be so sure at this point.  I'm basically playing a role as a buffer solution. When people say Teddy is bad, I tell them why they're wrong and why he'll become good. When people say he'll be elite, I tell them that it's unreasonable to assume that yet and that they should just consider his potential to be a very good QB for us"
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,Staple_Overlord,3,Tue Jul 14 18:48:06 2015 UTC,"Teddy's arm strength is currently lacking.   You're confusing mechanics for arm strength. He had a number of balls sail on him from dropping his elbow early, and that will cause passes to float.  The arm's adequate already, he just needs to stay working on his mechanics to optimize velocity and placement. He'll never have a cannon but he's strong enough to make all the throws"
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,EarnestQuestion,3,Tue Jul 14 20:23:40 2015 UTC,"Teddy has less physical limitations than Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and certainly Drew Brees.  He has above average NFL athleticism.  His arm strength is average to slightly above average.  He's quick and smooth.  Super accurate.    Plus he hasn't even filled out.  He has plenty of physical tools.  If he fails it won't be because of that.    Keep in mind he was 21 years old last season.  Most rookies QB's that do well are a year older.  He has the highest QB rating of all time in the NFL for a player his age or younger.  And virtually all QB's will add strength after age 21, as well as velocity.  Rodgers entered the league with an average arm, as did Brady.  It is difficult to project how much he'll add, but it is already pretty decent."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,sand0789,0,Tue Jul 14 23:37:41 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm laughing that I actually have to talk down Teddy after how much I've said about him the past two years.  Second, these are incorrect assessments. His arm strength is not average, let alone above average, compared to other starters in the league. Give me ~16 QBs that have weaker arms than Teddy. Probably can't because there are probably not even 5.  Also, his delivery is not smooth. His throwing motion is actually pretty strange compared to other QBs. And his accuracy is not always excellent. I point to the 2nd Lions games last year where he was consistently misplacing the ball, losing those precious after-the-catch yards, and even throwing two very costly interceptions that turned the tides of the game (since the Lions were playing awfully otherwise). Stats say Teddy was extremely accurate, but up until the last 5 games of the year, Teddy's YPA was hovering around the low 6.1's.  Teddy will get better. But this sub is going crazy with the expectations, and even lying to themselves about some pretty basic facts. Teddy is not a strong armed QB. He's a finesse QB. And he always will be."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,Staple_Overlord,7,Tue Jul 14 23:52:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think Wilson will be as elite as everyone thinks he is. I think he's great at using his evasiveness to extend plays for the deep ball, but I haven't seen him really thread the needle on consistent basis, or drop one where no one else but his receiver can get it. Sure he does it occasionally, but not at the level Luck or Rodgers does. I think of Wilson as more of a young Michael Vick."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,swimtothemoon1,4,Tue Jul 14 15:41:19 2015 UTC,"He's also never been on anything less than a Super Bowl quality roster, where as Luck took over for a team that was dismal enough to get the number one pick, and pretty much instantly turned them around.   Wilson is almost certainly not a bad qb (we've seen that a ready-to-roll except at QB roster can still make a bad qb look bad), but I think there's a ""non loony tunes"" debate about how good we should have already decided he is too."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,vita10gy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:10:28 2015 UTC,"His efficiency numbers are outstanding.  Remarkable.  He's done nothing but win.  But at the same time he's never finished in the top 20 in passing yards, nor has he commanded a high volume offense.    It is the efficiency versus volume debate.  Truth is we might not truly know ""what he's got"" until the defense and running game take a step back and he's forced to pass more frequently and into defenses that are expecting it.    I mean, could he carry a team if Lynch and that pass defense were merely average, the way Peyton, Brees, Brady, and Rodgers have done?  Time will tell.  He's also still quite young for a guy with his success and he could certainly get better."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,sand0789,2,Tue Jul 14 23:41:45 2015 UTC,"The kid's tough. I'm kinda doing the same thing as you, just looking at future potential. I think he has it in him, but it's hard to tell.  It's also difficult to tell since I'm a biased U of L fan. Love me some Teddy."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,FinsFan93,2,Tue Jul 14 15:47:35 2015 UTC,"I think top-end arm strength is overrated. He's never gonna be a gunslinger, but plenty of really great QBs aren't gunslingers. He made a handful of throws last year from awkward angles or without the room to step up and still got it there on time, so he's strong enough.  Whether or not he can get stronger isn't going to make the difference between Teddy topping out as one of those 2nd tier franchise QBs and becoming part of the next wave of elite QBs."
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,istasber,3,Tue Jul 14 17:21:55 2015 UTC,Romo's good but are you really gonna mention him with a list of top QBs and not include Roethlisberger?
minnesotavikings,3d94h5,twdavis18,2,Tue Jul 14 15:45:50 2015 UTC,"Romo was elite last season, at least in basic stats.  But he doesn't have the body of work that the other players have.  He also had a really stacked offense around him.    I don't consider hiim quite elite, but he's probably better than some give him credit for.  I think he's top 10."

Maybe on Madden, but in real life, Bridgewater showed sufficient zip and distance on his passes to be an elite QB.

minnesotavikings,3d94h5,sand0789,2,Wed Jul 15 01:09:30 2015 UTC,"Personally what I think makes Teddy a good player, and one with an extremely high ceiling, is how natural he is at playing the game.  He just seems to naturally get it.  He makes a lot of things look easy.  He moves around effortlessly and flicks passes around with generally pinpoint accuracy.  He did that with, in my opinion, a very weak supporting cast.  Looking at the other ""top 5"" rookie QB ratings of all time, I see teams that had more talent surrounding the QB.  Vikings were horrible in pass blocking and lacked anything resembling an elite WR, TE, or RB.  And Teddy put up a top 5 QB rating for a rookie QB and the highest rating ever by a 21 year old, amidst all of that.    How are we not supposed to be super excited kool-aid chuggers when it comes to Teddy Two Gloves."

minnesotavikings,3da4tx,HakunaMatata023,3,Wed Jul 15 00:52:31 2015 UTC,I'd love to hear this guys explanation on how Harrison Smith isn't elite and how Charles Johnson wasn't even mentioned
minnesotavikings,3da4tx,roybringus,4,Tue Jul 14 21:25:49 2015 UTC,I like how the whole article was completely complimentary of the Vikings yet the one thing that could possibly be considered slightly negative is the thing you took away from it.  Harrison Smith is not elite in Madden.  He is extremely good (probably one of the highest rated safeties in Madden 16) but you can't be truly elite in Madden unless you have top end speed.
minnesotavikings,3da4tx,mostdope92,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:43:34 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind this is all Madden related and even though Charles will likely be higher rated than CP, CP is likely still considered the better playmaker due to his running attributes(speed, quickness, juking, spin move, break takle, etc.).  And as for Harry he doesn't have top end speed in Madden so he isn't seen as elite in terms of Madden. Although he can be pretty deadly when user controlled as long Madden's goofy physics/animations don't take over."
minnesotavikings,3da4tx,uponplane,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:34:09 2015 UTC,I don't think the Vikings operate in a bend but don't break defense anymore. Fraizer has moved on!

minnesotavikings,3dadlw,WhatMovesYou,3,Tue Jul 14 19:10:05 2015 UTC,"Diggs is gonna be awesome, Patterson is gonna really have to earn his keep."
minnesotavikings,3dadlw,NicoSuave2020,3,Wed Jul 15 02:49:54 2015 UTC,"Coach Gray is my favorite position coach. He comes with a stellar resume and will not get the recognition he deserves in Minnesota because Zimmer will get the credit for making the defensive backs great. I hope he is starting to feel old, likes the place he lives, is tired of moving every few years, and because of this denies interviews to be a defensive coordinator again, because they'll surely come when our defense, more specifically our defensive backs, really start to thrive."
minnesotavikings,3dadlw,Haminthepaint,2,Wed Jul 15 02:24:50 2015 UTC,So is he saying Diggs is acting like a vet or not? Or is he saying he's playing like a vet but not acting like one?   That part confused me

minnesotavikings,3d9h6h,Procure,3,Tue Jul 14 15:53:50 2015 UTC,We went from almost worse to close to best within a year. Shitty coaching and bad player moves have prevented us from being a perennial contender and we've only gotten close when the coaches knew their jobs were on the line and pushed all their chips into the pot.  We have a long term coaching structure setup that gets along perfectly. Whether or not we assmebled a superbowl elite team I don't really care much right now. We're definitely going to be in the playoffs within the next few seasons and our shitstorm will officially be over.

minnesotavikings,3d8p1u,cusoman,28,Tue Jul 14 16:52:24 2015 UTC,"The Vikings entered the league as an expansion team in the early 1960s.  They are one of only 2 teams to be 0-4 in the Super Bowl.   They haven't appeared in a Super Bowl since the 1970s, but regardless they have been one of the more consistently good teams in the league.  In 1998, they fielded one of the greatest offenses in history (featuring legendary wide receivers Randy Moss and Cris Carter) only to fall in the conference championship game (one step before the SB). This conference championship is infamous because our placekicker, who was perfect on field goals the entire year, missed a field goal that would've all but sealed the game. We then went into overtime and lost.  In 2000, we had a pretty good team (including QB Daunte Culpepper, who many people considered to be a rising star), but we were utterly annihilated in the NFC championship by the NY Giants. This is where the phrase ""41-donut"" comes from.  In 2004, we traded Randy Moss away to the Raiders. He hated it there and didn't really try (which helped further establish his reputation as a total diva). A few seasons later he joined the New England Patriots (the most dominant team in the league, led by QB Tom Brady). In 2007, the Pats went undefeated and Moss ended up setting the record for receiving TDs in one season, with 23.  In 2007, we drafted Adrian Peterson, a star RB out of Oklahoma that entered the league with some injury concerns but was still considered to be a top talent. He's since cemented himself as one of the greatest RBs ever to play the game, despite some recent legal troubles that kept him out for almost all of last season.  In 2009, after years of mediocre QB play, we signed Brett Favre, a legendary QB that played for our rival - the Green Bay Packers - for nearly 15 years before spending a year with the NY Jets. We then experienced one of the most exciting years in team history, until the conference championship game (sensing a theme here?) where we lost to the New Orleans Saints.  Which brings me to an important part of Vikings fandom. To make it as a Vikes fan, you have to irrationally hate the teams that beat you in the playoffs, on a personal level. Well, tbh, the Saints deserve it, because their coaches encouraged their players to take cheap shots at Favre on a lot of plays. The 2009 NFC Championship is one of the dirtiest, most poorly-officiated games I've ever seen.  But I digress. 2010 was a horrible year. Favre, now 41, was clearly slowing down, and he spent the year nursing injuries and getting the snot beaten out of him. We ended up trading for Moss from the Pats and, despite fans foolishly expecting Favre-to-Moss to develop into the best connection ever, he got cut after only a month with a team. He allegedly called out our head coach, Brad Childress, in front of the team's owners. Bad move. Favre retired after this year.  In 2011, we bounced from one horrible QB (Donovan McNabb, who was way over the hill when we signed him) to a mediocre rookie (Christian Ponder). We sucked that year.  We made the playoffs in 2012, but we only got there because Peterson came within spitting distance of the single-season rushing record. The rest of the team was pretty meh.  I chose to forget 2013.  Last season was the first under head coach Mike Zimmer, widely regarded as one of the sharpest defensive minds in football. It was also Teddy Bridgewater's rookie season. His name may sound like a character from Game of Thrones, but in reality he's a talented QB that some expect to make the jump to ""pretty darn good"" in his second year. Like I said before, Peterson only played one game last year after getting in trouble for beating his kid.  The end.  TL;DR - I spent way too much time on this. Skol Vikings."

minnesotavikings,3d4lg3,spokenflow22,0,Mon Jul 13 22:23:32 2015 UTC,"He had like 200 yards against the saints, so using his per start output is kind of disingenuous.  But still, if you give him credit for 12.5 games, that's still like 3700 yards extrapolated out to 16 games. People laugh at me when I say I think he can throw for more than 4000 next year, but it's only like another 20 yards a game average, which is a totally reasonable year one to year two bump."
minnesotavikings,3d4lg3,istasber,2,Tue Jul 14 00:14:28 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't argue your logic based off Teddy's capability and potential but instead based off our receiver corps. If Patterson doesn't get his shit together? That's going to hurt a lot and then no, I don't see Teddy passing for 4k. I think he could, absolutely, my concerns are with our receivers, and possibly even his protection, not Teddy himself."
minnesotavikings,3d4lg3,You-Can-Quote-Me,2,Tue Jul 14 00:31:22 2015 UTC,But Patterson not having his shot together didn't keep Teddy from averaging roughly 230 yards per game in his rookie year. I think a lot more than just having Patterson fail to take a step would have to happen to put 4k out of reach for year 2.
minnesotavikings,3d4lg3,istasber,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:26:19 2015 UTC,"You're right, but we also didn't have Peterson to feed the ball to.  McKinnon and Asiata did well but only combined for a little over 1100 yards and then another 200 came from Bridgewater himself. Let's face it, we would've been running the ball much more with Peterson there. Or in the very least we would've had to pass it less because we would've covered more yards on the ground.  Then you have to consider that Jennings is no longer with us; that's our lead receiver from last year gone, which means you can say goodbye to his 742 yards.  PLEASE understand that just because X or Y or Z is going to fill his role does not at all mean that they will get his yards.    The next highest receiver was Wright with 588 and then Johnson with 475. Patterson at 384 and Asiata at 312.    I'm sorry, I just don't think the idea is that feasible. We were the 28th ranked team in the league regarding our passing and we aren't built around the pass like some other teams are that would allow us to go for 4k or more. I'd love to see it, I would, and I think Bridgewater has an arm for it, but let's slow down and not try to play football that's contrary to the team we actually are.  Not until we have some more tools at least."
minnesotavikings,3d4lg3,You-Can-Quote-Me,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:32:08 2015 UTC,"I get all of this, losing Jennings does hurt But we added Wallace, Johnson's going into his second year as a starter with a full offseason not dealing with rehab issues and staying with one team, Rudy will hopefully be back and healthy (hopefully), we added Pruitt and Diggs in the draft, Thielen got a lot of praise from Norv at the end of last year and is getting a lot of praise in OTAs this year...  There's reason to be optimistic that our receiving situation should be at least as good as it was last year, if not better. Couple that with Teddy taking a step forward going from year 1 to year 2, and I think it's at least conceivable he'll throw 4000.  Peterson coming back might be the biggest issue. Only 3 teams had more rushing yards than us (1804) last year, but still threw for 4000+, and none of those teams rushed for more than we did back in 2013 (2081). While two of those teams had QBs named Rodgers and Brees, the other one was Philly... so, there is that."
minnesotavikings,3d4lg3,istasber,5,Tue Jul 14 15:50:04 2015 UTC,"I think there's actually a very good reason that this stat is misleading (and it's also the reason Bridgewater's TD-INT ratio was so bad): the Vikings clearly prefered running the ball inside the 10, especially inside the 5. Seriously, they had a 2:1 run:pass ratio.  Passing plays inside the redzone (and especially those inside the five) are absolutely more difficult than other areas of the field because the space you have to throw in is so much more compressed and it's easier for the defense to cover that smaller area. The Vikings prefered to run with Asiata in those situations, that's why he got 9 TDs last year. Teddy only threw 3 TDs inside the 5. On the other hand, a guy like Derek Carr threw 10 of his TDs from inside the five. He's clearly attempting way more passes (and probably a large chunk of his total redzone attempts) inside the five yardline, and throwing from the five is a lot more difficult than throwing from the 20 (note: what I mean by this is that it's more difficult to complete a pass from the 5 yard line, not necessarily throw for a TD, because if you complete one out of thre passes there's a good chance the completion will be a score). So saying that Bridgewater is clearly awesome because of this stat is flawed because he was simply in a different situation than the other QBs.  By the same token, I think it does make Bridgewater's 14 TDs look more impressive, because he's not getting a lot of short TD passes, because those were taken up by the run game."
minnesotavikings,3d4lg3,skepticismissurvival,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:07:26 2015 UTC,I think a lot of this was a result of not having a catch-point receiver on the roster last year. Tough to throw inside the five when your #1 receiver Johnson couldn't win a jump ball against my grandma  Hopefully Rudolph can stay healthy and Wallace brings something in these situations as well. We should see Bridgewater's comp. % drop but his TDs go up
minnesotavikings,3d4lg3,EarnestQuestion,7,Tue Jul 14 03:57:54 2015 UTC,I think this might be a little bit of an inflated stat because we were really not throwing on the goal line much at all. I would expect his red zone accuracy to go down this year assuming we start using him more in goal line situations.
minnesotavikings,3d4lg3,Haminthepaint,7,Wed Jul 15 04:39:43 2015 UTC,"Naw, he'll have 100% accuracy because we'll line up Asiata and Peterson in the backfield and that'll leave someone wide open when we  choose to pass it."

minnesotavikings,3d4lg3,agnostic_penguin,5,Mon Jul 13 17:54:31 2015 UTC,"The argument that his numbers are inflated, due to small sample size, is a bad way to look at the data.   26 attempts is much less than Manning's 109. But 26 is still a pretty good sample size! Even if Teddy had missed 2 more of his 26 attempts, he would still be at 17/26 (65.3%), which would STILL be tops in the league. Admittedly, there is NOT enough data to say with confidence whether Teddy has ""the best"" red zone accuracy in the league. But there IS enough data to say with confidence that his red zone accuracy is pretty damn good."

I don't think they'd say it if they didn't think it was true, but I guess I'm a bit suspicious that it might not be a terribly spontaneous observation/declaration.  I'm over thinking this.

minnesotavikings,3d5wj7,PurpleVikings,8,Mon Jul 13 19:45:57 2015 UTC,My non-expert analysis is that a team will sign him right before training camp and it will not be the Vikings.
minnesotavikings,3d5wj7,matthewmpls,8,Mon Jul 13 20:08:41 2015 UTC,"I reckon he wants too much money, and nobody's been able to make it work. Not a huge market for an old guard coming off of injury for a big salary."
minnesotavikings,3d5wj7,spokenflow22,7,Mon Jul 13 19:49:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah this. Maybe he was given bad info, or maybe he just wanted out, but I think Mathis is realizing that the market he wants to exist for his services simply doesn't.

People tend to forget that Zimmer's Bengals secondary is one of the few teams to really ""figure out"" Rodgers and really give him a run for his money.  Packer fans, when bringing this up, are quick to post the picture of Zimmer looking confused with the 42-0 score from our Lambeau game last year, but that defense was gassed and you really can't lend full credence to what a coach is capable of in only his first year, unless it was an unmitigated train wreck of a season, which 2014 was most certainly not.  I think Zimmer's vaunted secondary coaching really starts to show signs of that unit gelling this year and we start flustering some of the top 3rd QBs in the league.  I think he's good enough that he can get things near to what he had in Cincinnati, this year."

Many fans embrace being the heel of the NFL given the history of our team. The middle finger is simply a symbolic ritual that helps identify oneself as belonging to this Raider's culture.

minnesotavikings,3d2jyo,SkoalVikings,3,Mon Jul 13 06:31:26 2015 UTC,"There is a feud centered around who had the best rookie quarterback.  One one hand, you have Teddy Bridgewater, who posted the 5th highest rookie QB rating in the last 15 years and finished on a 5 game tear.  On the other hand, you have Derek Carr, who was quietly atrocious, posting a lower YPA than any good quarterback has posted in the last 10 years at any point in their career, while also being in the bottom 3 for QB rating, QBR, and virtually any other efficiency metric.  Utterly fucking atrocious.  Objectively bad.  Statistically in company with only losers.  So you get in these arguments and I don't even know what they are about.  The Raiders fans talk jive about total TD's and total yards, as well as arm strength, to display their pathetic understanding of football or how just getting tons of attempts doesn't make you good.  They act like deer in the headlights when you point out that Bridge threw for more yards per game, with less attempts per game and almost 50% more YPA.    It just isn't remotely close quite frankly.  Carr might be a great QB.  He might be the greatest ever one day.  But he will have to overcome a disastrous rookie season in which he was utterly horrendous.  Nobody has done that in the last 10 years.  The only real example of a guy pulling it off is Drew Brees, who posted 6.2 YPA in his first full season, as a Sophomore in the NFL (and then he was arguably worse his 3rd year in the league).  But he never had a year as bad as Carr.  But close.    So either Carr is Drew Brees or he's a big steaming pile of horseshit waste of a 2nd rounder.  Teddy had a fabulous rookie season consistent with guys who generally make it in the league, but it is certainly possible that he still flames out despite it (RGIII also is in that top 5 rookie QB rating club)."

minnesotavikings,3d2176,OmahaVike,18,Sun Jul 12 21:58:39 2015 UTC,"Wobby thinks every Viking, every year is ""poised to have a big season"". Patterson however is poised to remain the teams starting kick returner and won't see much time as a receiver unless Charles Johnson gets hurt."
minnesotavikings,3d2176,SkoalVikings,13,Sun Jul 12 23:43:29 2015 UTC,That's silly. He'll get a lot of snaps with or without injuries.
minnesotavikings,3d2176,NicoSuave2020,5,Mon Jul 13 00:17:16 2015 UTC,Why did he get hardly any at the end of last year then?
minnesotavikings,3d2176,SkoalVikings,5,Mon Jul 13 00:31:27 2015 UTC,"There are so many factors that go into that but from what I've gathered he was running a lot of incorrect routes. He wasn't anticipating coverages and just wasn't clicking with Teddy. The emergence of Charles Johnson also didn't help him, Cordarrelle probably would have continued starting if they didn't think Johnson was really good. Also, they were giving Cordarrelle tough love last year. They wanted him to learn how to be a real receiver and not just a gadget guy. Zim admitted right after the season that they should have manufactured more touches for him. He was thinking long term with the tough love approach, and that's fine with me. He's apparently worked extremely hard this offseason and I fully expect him to see a lot of playing time. Felton is gone, Norv likes his 3WR sets, and Teddy has done well in spread formations dating back to Louisville. I think Wright and Patterson will both get a ton of snaps for guys considered 3rd and 4th on the depth chart."
minnesotavikings,3d2176,NicoSuave2020,3,Mon Jul 13 04:38:27 2015 UTC,"He was the 4th receiver the end of last year and he was getting under a ten snaps a game. I guess you'll have to define ""a ton of snaps"". I don't consider less than 160 snaps a season to be a ton. Nobody uses their 4th receiver that much unless the starters get injured. I'm not sure he's even a lock to be Johnson's backup. They may just view him as a kick returner because he can't run a route. If Patterson couldn't return kicks as well as he does he wouldn't make the roster."
minnesotavikings,3d2176,SkoalVikings,-2,Mon Jul 13 05:17:39 2015 UTC,If he plays every game he's going to get way more than 160 snaps. I think he'll be in on 30+ offensive snaps a game. People in this sub really let the narratives around Cordarrelle get to them. He's not nearly as poor of a route runner as people think. He ran a lot of wrong routes and that's what cost him his starting spot. I have a lot of confidence that he's going to be a beast this year.
minnesotavikings,3d2176,NicoSuave2020,6,Mon Jul 13 06:18:11 2015 UTC,"Running the wrong route is a bad route. He played in all these games last year after receiving his reduced role and this was his offensive snap count.   Week 13: 3 snaps  Week 14: 1 snap  Week 15: 8 snaps  Week 16: 9 snaps  Week 17: 6 snaps  27 snaps in 5 games is a little less than thirty a game. He could average 30 a game if he starts for over half the year again but otherwise no way. They would have to bench Johnson for half the game to give 30 snaps to Patterson. If you aren't the #1 flanker, split end or slot receiver then you don't get on the field much. That's just how it is.  It's not like we have to sit here and speculate as to what a reduced role looks like for Patterson. We saw it last year at the end of the season. We can reasonably assume, barring an injury, he won't get on the field much this season. On what team has the 4th receiver gotten 30 snaps per game when the guys in front of him stayed healthy? That just doesn't happen in the NFL."

minnesotavikings,3d2176,SkoalVikings,3,Mon Jul 13 02:02:34 2015 UTC,"I just did thirty seconds of research so I only have a single piece of evidence he was injured.  From here:   Cordarrelle Patterson secured 2-of-3 targets for 16 yards in the Vikings' Week 15 loss to the Lions. Patterson entered this game questionable with a hamstring injury. He played behind Charles Johnson, Greg Jennings, and Jarius Wright. Patterson did break off a 51-yard kickoff return in the fourth quarter and made two late catches on Minnesota's final drive. Unfortunately, he was droppable in re-draft leagues awhile back."
minnesotavikings,3d2176,kisswithaf,5,Mon Jul 13 03:17:55 2015 UTC,He wasn't benched because of a hamstring injury. He was benched because he can't run routes. He didn't have a hamstring injury for half the season. They started somebody else because Patterson wasn't getting it done.
minnesotavikings,3d2176,SkoalVikings,4,Mon Jul 13 05:03:54 2015 UTC,He fought both foot/ankle and hamstring injuries throughout the entire season. I thought it was pretty clear that it was affecting him. You could really tell on kick returns. He didn't have the same burst or that insane cutting ability he showed his rookie season.
minnesotavikings,3d2176,NicoSuave2020,0,Mon Jul 13 04:41:37 2015 UTC,"He was benched 2 weeks prior to that, and didn't have any hammy issues at the time."
minnesotavikings,3d2176,nomaam05,6,Mon Jul 13 08:35:21 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for the best.
minnesotavikings,3d2176,OhSnappitySnap,7,Sun Jul 12 22:51:31 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for even just average.
minnesotavikings,3d2176,cusoman,2,Sun Jul 12 23:05:40 2015 UTC,Thats not going to happen. He's either going to be really good or suck hard.
minnesotavikings,3d2176,paddywacknack,3,Sun Jul 12 23:24:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think he has a much better shot at being around average as a WR, but still a great KR than being great. At this point it's a stretch to imagine he'll be a top tier WR, he has to become an average one first, and I don't think he has the (hate to use this word) intangible skills to be top tier. By intangibles I mean the great catching ability that pretty much can't be taught, the crisp routes, the willingness to listen to coaches and improve in the right way (from what we know Patterson got stronger and faster, but didn't work on the weakest part of his game, the technical side)."
minnesotavikings,3d2176,McRawffles,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:14:51 2015 UTC,"I think if he can get the ball in his hands, he will be great. If he can't get it, he is going to be off the field quick and they will see what Diggs can do."
minnesotavikings,3d2176,kisswithaf,3,Mon Jul 13 01:44:05 2015 UTC,"Nah.  I think Jacoby Jones is a pretty good player comp.  Decent #3 receiver, awesome return man, gadget guy."
minnesotavikings,3d2176,guitarhunterdude,0,Mon Jul 13 22:46:15 2015 UTC,JJ is what Patterson needs to try and be. JJ gets 40 catches a year and makes his money in the return game.
minnesotavikings,3d2176,miketheblade,9,Sun Jul 19 08:21:09 2015 UTC,"What's with the negativity? I wouldn't doubt it if Patterson does have a big year - especially with both him and Teddy having another year under the belt and with AP back.  You just sit there thinking to yourself ""Hmph! We've heard that one before >:("" And I'll sit over here enjoying the slow hopeful buildup."

minnesotavikings,3d2176,kayeat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:33:43 2015 UTC,I'm just neutral about it. after all the buzz about him last year that got me real hot and bothered I don't think I'll be putting too much stock on him this time around.   BUT DAT CHARLES THO AM I RIGHT GUYS
minnesotavikings,3d2176,gin-rummy,0,Mon Jul 13 03:35:35 2015 UTC,The negativity comes with the fact that he was an all out liability on the field last year aside from returns.  He wasn't picking up the offense and couldn't read the defense.  If he doesn't make massive strides in the mental aspect of his position he's going to end up on the bench again.  He's more a show me and I'll believe it kind of player right now.  Luckily he as training camp and pre-season to exactly that.
minnesotavikings,3d2176,rageaholic55,3,Mon Jul 13 18:43:16 2015 UTC,"I can just imagine all the praise and ""well we all knew receivers break out in their 3rd year"" posts when he has a good year."
minnesotavikings,3d2176,EquinsuOchaACE,4,Mon Jul 13 16:57:58 2015 UTC,Pass the koolaid
minnesotavikings,3d2176,imgonnaquit,4,Mon Jul 13 01:59:34 2015 UTC,He was unfairly hyped up last year. He came into the league and was phenomenal based on his physical ability and then when we lost Peterson last year Patterson was our only offensive threat so defenses could key in on him. Every time he was on the field defenses were watching for the end around or the quick little swing passes. Now with more options on offense these plays will be more effective. When he was drafted the reports were that he was a freak athlete that couldn't run routes. At the end of the year last year he started to show better route running ability especially across the middle of the field with those short to intermediate routes. He'll be fine this year
minnesotavikings,3d2176,carsonr22,2,Mon Jul 13 08:09:32 2015 UTC,"I truly believe that Patterson will be much improved this coming season and will play more like the last half of his rookie season. I think coming into last season he heard all the hype and his head got a little too big and started thinking he's athletic enough to just show up and be great without putting in extra effort and that he'll be the star that everyone thought he would be. But I think he's gonna come in more humble this year and really put in the work and that it will pay off big time for him. Also he's had a full year to get use to the playbook, it hasn't changed like every year in college and the NFL so that should also help out a lot."

minnesotavikings,3d2176,agnostic_penguin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:27:53 2015 UTC,"Or we wanted to dump Jennings and get someone who can stretch the field instead of a possession receiver.  Even at WR3 Patterson is scary, and he probably would be served best in the slot anyways. Quick hook routes and crosses with that kind of speed have me salivating.  He is no guarantee, but he certainly is not a bad player."
minnesotavikings,3d2176,tunafister,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:25:04 2015 UTC,"The dude is only what 23-24? Give him at least one more year, the people completely writing CP off are ridiculous. Remember he has never had the same OC for more than 2 years so he's gone throught a lot of changes in a short amount of time. Now that our situation seems fairly stable I think this is a great time for him to be able to break out, especially after last year's wake up call."

minnesotavikings,3d2176,taksark,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:06:06 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand the Patterson bashing and just all around negativity. He's a raw athlete, we drafted him as a raw athlete. He's been playing high level football for 3 years and he's had 3 different offensive coordinators and offensive schemes. He's not a polished route runner, maybe he never will be but there are very few guys as dangerous with the ball in their hands. Peterson not taking any heat off Patterson is what really hurt his production.  Prime example is the Rams game. With Peterson back, a second year in Norv's offense and Norv's teachings, plus the addition of a legit deep threat and a TE that needs to be focused on I also expect Patterson to have a good year."

minnesotavikings,3d1044,McRawffles,6,Sun Jul 12 16:54:57 2015 UTC,"I seem to be in a small minority that thinks Cole is a good backer worthy of starting. I know he isn't as athletic as Zim's backers have been in the past but he's proven time and time again that he's a tackling machine when starting inside. I'd like to see him start at Mike with Kendricks starting at Will, and have Kendricks and Barr in on nickel packages. I love Greenway, absolutely love him, but it's time for him to take a huge step back in terms of snaps played. He is a liability in the passing game if asked to cover a TE or RB one-on-one. I would assume most of you think it'd be best to keep Kendricks at Mike and start Hodges at Will, which I'd still like more than having Greenway out there, but, after watching every game from last season 4+ times, I can't help but feel like Hodges has no idea how to find the ball on run plays. Not only can he not find it, he routinely gets blasted by blockers while trying to find it. I see Hodges best role as being a rotational player, who can start at either outside spots if needed, who only plays in sub-packages when everybody is healthy.   TLDR; I think Cole should start inside and Kendricks on the weak-side."
minnesotavikings,3d1044,NicoSuave2020,3,Sun Jul 12 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about that recently as well and I agree. I think Barr/Cole/Kendricks is a better skillset mix than Barr/Kendricks/Hodges. Kendricks has good coverage skills, so he should be our coverage linebacker, and Cole is really good against the run."
minnesotavikings,3d1044,drawingdead0,2,Sun Jul 12 17:21:20 2015 UTC,"I think he has shown a lot of promise, and it definitely earns him a ticket to the competition, but it's gotta be a lot more to just gift him the spot."
minnesotavikings,3d1044,NicoSuave2020,3,Mon Jul 13 20:47:02 2015 UTC,"For sure. I'm just kind of worried about Greenway, and with Kendricks being a more natural fit at Will, and Cole being on the last year of his rookie deal, I think it would make sense to start him at Mike and see what we have in him as a full time starter. No doubt he has to go earn it. I doubt it happens, it's just what I think would be best."
minnesotavikings,3d1044,drawingdead0,2,Mon Jul 13 20:56:31 2015 UTC,"Yup, it'll be great if he could win the job, but that's what camp/preseason is for. It's great that we don't have to make that decision in July."

His PRP numbers on PFF are skewed because of that. A lot more edge-setting from him (not like the previous scheme where both DEs needed to rush the passer much more often).  Which also drives some of the criticism of him, which is a little unfair. Still, he could have done better in clear third-and-long situations and hopefully he will."

On the flip side, Directv allows you to watch the games (and stream them) with their select package which is $50 a month (or a 12 month promo of $20 then a year at $50) which is $600 a year."

Improvement needed, but the guy's conveniently ignoring facts that show the kid stepped up to the challenge and gave his team a fighting chance."

minnesotavikings,3cxwfe,cadderly09,5,Sun Jul 12 01:53:10 2015 UTC,Raiders   lol. Teddy Bridgewater is only gonna widen the gap between best QB from that class and it won't even be close after that game.
minnesotavikings,3cxwfe,pingpongguy,2,Sat Jul 11 20:43:24 2015 UTC,Yeah i agree. I have no faith in Carr being a competent QB whatsoever.

Optimistic predictors would love to beat an ""up and coming"" team, but know they couldn't beat the entrenched great teams.  The season's overall record will end up 256-256, but if you compiled the Offseason Review records it'd probably predict something like 384-128."

The most appearances in a Superbowl out of everyone in the division at five, four wins.  I honestly think this year will be the Packers and Vikings as the #1 and 2 slot and I really do hope for a big final game with them both.  Love both teams, I know, it's weird."

minnesotavikings,3csv2m,rastapasta9,6,Fri Jul 10 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"No they're not. Not yet. We still need a safety to line up with Smith, offensive line still may be an issue, we still need a true #1 receiver, Robison will retire soon and we need to find a replacement for him, and we need another LB to replace Greenway, and we need to find Adrian Peterson's replacement in the coming years."
minnesotavikings,3csv2m,genno334,16,Fri Jul 10 15:28:21 2015 UTC,"You make it sound like we need the perfect team to become one. Every team has weaknesss'. The Seahawks receivers, the Patriots running backs and defensive backfield. The list goes on"
minnesotavikings,3csv2m,DarkMuret,9,Fri Jul 10 16:18:09 2015 UTC,You really don't like Blanton....despite the fact that he was a pretty decent SS....
minnesotavikings,3csv2m,spokenflow22,6,Fri Jul 10 15:35:10 2015 UTC,"That's far from a unanimous thing. Blanton is very polarizing, there are good points on both sides."
minnesotavikings,3csv2m,DarkMuret,2,Fri Jul 10 19:18:38 2015 UTC,"Usually if someone brings up any mention of Blanton being at least a pretty decent safety, I usually see it get downvoted.  Either way, the SS battle will be interesting...."
minnesotavikings,3csv2m,proves,3,Sat Jul 11 15:45:07 2015 UTC,"Ehhhh...we're not that far off.   Blanton played well enough to not be a detriment.  Exum could step up and take over (keep in mind he was a projected 1st rounder prior to injury).   I believe Hunter is said to be the heir to Robison.  Also, Crichton is around...although both are an unknown, but both are said to have a lot of upside.  We'll see this year as I predict Robison to rotate out more often this year.     You have a point with Greenway...Hodges is there, but the jury is still out.  Not a lot of OLB depth and will probably be a key focus for next year's off-season.   EDIT: Whoops...I was focused on the defense.  I think the OL will figure it out this year.  WRs have a lot of potential, but also unproven."
minnesotavikings,3csv2m,TheAesir,3,Fri Jul 10 16:40:52 2015 UTC,"From what I understand Hunter lines up opposite of Robison   Hunter won't be replacing Griffen, no chance"
minnesotavikings,3csv2m,DirtD4er,2,Fri Jul 10 16:43:13 2015 UTC,"Plus we need every piece we have to work out. If, say, Waynes and Patterson bust out, and Johnson never shows more than flashes of talent, it's not gonna happen."
minnesotavikings,3csv2m,asdfgh12045,2,Fri Jul 10 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"I have answers for all your concerns. Blanton may have failed the eye test more than once and be overrated by PFF, but his stats don't lie. If not, we have Exum which after looking at his tape does seem like he could be a viable safety.  Our line is fine in my opinion. The right side is coming back, and with Johnson gone, we can finally put someone competent there. We do have very highly touted o-linemen on the team. (Clemmings and Yankey were both considered to be high draft picks)  Johnson came on very strongly last year and we have Mike Wallace this year; given his time of dominance with Big Ben, it's not unreasonable to think that he can do it again. Plus, Patterson's offseason training hopefully has helped him right the ship.  We drafted 2 athletic freaks at DE and I think that Hunter or Crichton can be very capable replacements for Robison.   No one around here really gives Hodges, (or Cole for that matter) any credit as replacements. We already have Barr and hopefully Kendricks so we're at least 1/3 there if not 2/3.  Also, I think Jet is finally coming into his own so who's not to say he can be AD's replacement. AD already thinks very highly of him so I'll take his word on it.  We do have pieces (albeit raw) in place and a great coaching staff to maximize all their potential. I get you're being cautiously optimistic, but don't discount the talent we have now."
minnesotavikings,3csv2m,vbullinger,0,Fri Jul 10 16:58:11 2015 UTC,"Not really. The article title is ""Measurably New?"" As opposed to just a little better based off of new personnel.

minnesotavikings,3ctnvn,McRawffles,2,Fri Jul 10 21:08:08 2015 UTC,"Not really.  Although I've sat in multiple seats at the stadium and IMO the best seats are in the upper bowl on the sidelines--although I'd probably say that about any stadium when it comes to watching football. It provides the best angle for watching the game. Endzone seats are exciting and expensive, but you can't clearly see what's going on (especially when the ball's on the other half of the field), lower seats are good but don't provide quite as good an angle IMO.  Also I really enjoy hanging out with the crowd in those sections. Had some good discussions with people up there. That's probably just luck though."
minnesotavikings,3ctnvn,BarackSays,2,Fri Jul 10 21:35:09 2015 UTC,"It is definitely a smaller stadium, seats 45,000, but it opened in 2009 and is excellent. I've only been there for Gopher games but my cheap seats both times provided a great view. Plus, outdoor football!"

minnesotavikings,3ct17t,cynthiadangus,3,Fri Jul 10 21:10:41 2015 UTC,"www.cash4kek.com/lel.htm  Trust me, I've tried everything. I had a bunch of blood tests and x-rays and whatnot done a few months ago at the request of my doctor (a gastroenterologist was also involved at one point) just to make sure something wasn't wrong with my thyroid or whatever, and the doctor literally said ""well this doesn't make sense because you're doing everything right"" because for a couple months this winter I would only shit about once every 5 days. One time a couple years ago I went 7 days without - THAT was awful. That's what happened this weekend - a little too much meat and then bam, 5 days of constipation.  Typically it's under control under ideal circumstances - e.g. running ~10 miles a week, lots of leafy greens, ~1800 calories a day, easy on/no cheese and other stuff that would bind a person up, etc. But then there's the whole other dimension of stress, getting enough sleep, and so on. It's predictably unpredictable. I was prescribed Amitiza, but my insurance refused to cover it and I can't afford it straight up, so I just have to be hyper-vigilant with diet and exercise. And then for the times when I have a flare-up (typically once or twice a month) I down a bottle of magnesium citrate, white knuckle the toilet seat, close my eyes and think of England. And with that, strangers on the internet know more about my bowel habits than my girlfriend or family.  TL;DR I suck at shitting."

In good news I might be heading down the Beartooth Highway this weekend with some friends. Suppose to be the most scenic drive in America and pretty much is required for anyone who lives here
minnesotavikings,3ct17t,bacoon,3,Fri Jul 10 16:10:34 2015 UTC,Had an interview last Tuesday and still haven't heard anything. My heart sinks with every phone call I've been getting lately.
minnesotavikings,3ct17t,CampBenCh,4,Fri Jul 10 16:29:04 2015 UTC,Good luck! I've been applying to tons of jobs and only gotten 2 interviews- however one was for strictly temp work and so I probably won't take it if offered. I've applied to about 50 jobs so far so I feel the pain. What was the job interview for?

minnesotavikings,3ct17t,Jarl_Bridgewater,5,Fri Jul 10 16:39:32 2015 UTC,"The issue is this- I live in Montana and it was for work in Minneapolis... for 4 months. I would have to move in with my parents and leave my fiancee behind. Or she would move too and then she would be without a job. Once the 4 months is up, then I'd be back in the same position I am now.   I thought about it a lot, and the best thing I can do now is keep looking for a full-time, permanent position. I don't want to add extra costs and stress with having to move multiple times, not to mention my fiancee having to look for work each time we move.   I thought very long about taking the temp job if I am offered it and in the end it just wouldn't be the best for my situation."
minnesotavikings,3ct17t,nautilusnautilus,2,Fri Jul 10 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, that is a complication I didn't consider.  So it's not the temp part that's the real problem, it's the moving. Understood. Also, while temping (in Montana), keep looking while you're temping."

minnesotavikings,3ct17t,nautilusnautilus,5,Fri Jul 10 20:03:41 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend of 21 months as of the 4th broke up with me on Wednesday. Kinda came out of the blue. She wants to ""have fun"" at college, and she's going to UW-Madison, and I go to a school two and a half hours from there. One of the worst parts is she broke up with me over text.  That snowballed. I got hammered, alone, on Wednesday night, then went to my summer math class with a hangover on 4.5 hours of sleep. I discovered I had texted some chick who led me on for a long time during high school, and was disappointed in myself. During math, I kept getting called on to answer because I was zoning out. Then I drove 2 hours to my parents house, grabbed everything my now-ex has ever given me, then drove 3 hours and dropped all of that off at her house. Then I was hanging out with some old friends who live down there, and we were just getting into a highway when my left tire blew out. I have a Kia Rio, so there's not much space to get a jack under. The jack that came with the car bent under the cars weight, and it was about 915 at night and dark out, so we had to call a sherif to come wait behind us because cars kept being assholes and almost hitting us. Then my other friend finally showed up, and jacked my car up, and put the spare on.  Then this morning I woke up with a bloody nose, and am super depressed about the break up. I went to buy a new tire, but they didn't carry in stock the one I wanted, so I had to buy a worse tire. Then they told me my other front tire was worn to the wire, which is really odd because theses tires are only like 2000 miles/3 months old. So I had to shell out $130 bucks that I don't really have to fix my tires. The tread in the middle of the tires isn't worn down at all, while on the outsides they were practically bald. I think it might be over inflation, but the max psi is 51, and I always have them at the recommended 32.  Tonight I'm getting more alcohol, and drinking my sorrows. Will probably help me become a better Vikings fan. Still completely torn about the break up. My friends keep telling me to go smash some random girls, but I'm not that type of person, though on Wednesday I drunk texted a former coworker who also now goes to my college, and she said I made her night. Not sure how to feel.  TLDR; single and drinking"

While I do agree with the vast majority of what you said, legalizing drugs would not kill gangs. Gangs existed far before the boom of illegal drugs in this country (With reports of gangs as far back as right after the revolutionary war), and even legalizing every drug would not kill them. It would hamper their income, and reduce their ranks for sure, but gangs and gang activity would not be killed just because drugs become legal. There are still plenty of illegal things for gangs to do, turf to protect, etc."
minnesotavikings,3ct17t,Jarl_Bridgewater,3,Fri Jul 10 18:51:56 2015 UTC,Dramatically reducing their ranks and saving many a victim is all I really meant. It would decimate their ranks and their power.

minnesotavikings,3ct17t,cynthiadangus,0,Sat Jul 11 00:23:46 2015 UTC,"It's counter intuitive but there is. Most people who use drugs use them responsible and don't let them interfere with their lives. The other type of person is the one who uses even when consequences are crippling their lives, neglecting family, lose job, declining health. These are called addicts. And we shouldn't treat them like a violent criminal. They should be treated like sick patients. If we remove the stigma then it will be easier for them to get help. Listen to this neurologist that came on the show Dr Carl Hart. http://youtu.be/T5jMC8j7ElI edit: sorry for sharing a 2 hour podcast, but this is what changed my mind on the subject."

Some drugs are flat out dangerous, period, whether the people doing them are addicted or not.  Bring me something that isn't two hours long, and is a good argument for why something as bad as meth should be decriminalized. Spoiler alert, you're going to be searching forever, because that argument doesn't exist."
minnesotavikings,3ct17t,cynthiadangus,-1,Sat Jul 11 01:07:16 2015 UTC,"Here is the argument  you say doesn't exist. Twelve years ago, Portugal eliminated criminal penalties for drug users. Since then, those caught with small amounts of marijuana, cocaine or heroin go unindicted and possession is a misdemeanor on par with illegal parking. Experts are pleased with the results."
minnesotavikings,3ct17t,gt14199,-1,Sat Jul 11 01:23:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they kept people out of prison. That's great. That isn't a legitimate reason.  You know what else they did? They created more drug addicts. What's the first thing you're going to do if something you kind of what to try, or liked to do, but stopped for fear of jail time is suddenly decriminalized. You're going to go do it. More people sparking up a meth pipe is not a valid solution to anything, even if it's a small amount (and yes, I checked. Everything points to a raise in drug use during the early stages of decriminalization in Portugal). If every drug under the sun only affected the people that took them, I'd be all for it. BUT SOME DRUGS ARE DANGEROUS, not just to the people that do them, but the people around them as well. Not sure how many times I'll have to chant that one out for you to understand. Obviously, too many for me to continue to care. Seeing is how your only argument is, ""these people did it, and there were small negative impacts but a greater emphasis on mental health care."" then don't bother responding, because that's the worst argument on the planet for why Meth should be decriminalized like it was in a 2nd class country. So, have a good one."

Most of the other players are still kind of hard to call ""underrated."" Maybe we should make up our own.  Joe Flacco's making a hojillion dollars a year. He can't be on here. I'd either use Tannehill or Teddy, to be honest.  Clay at TE? Is he still ""underrated?"" At RB... that's a toughy. It's hard to be an under-the-radar RB... CJ Anderson? Jeremy Hill?  I think they did a great job with the WRs, though.  I'd look to Dallas and Denver for suggestions on o-line replacements (so long as they, too, are not seen as elite)  D-line's on point. I'd probably go with four instead of three. I know they're shooting for 3-4, but I would just list 4 LBs and 4 D-linemen.  Replacement for Kerrigan... Hey, maybe even Barr?  The corners are ridiculous and the safeties I think are quite well-regarded to anybody more than the most casual of fans. We'd need an entirely different secondary. And I'd toss in a slot corner, as well. They're pretty important when you look at the contributions of elite slot receivers.  I hesitate to say Rhodes. Not because he isn't extremely good, but I believe he's getting recognized quite a bit.  Josh Norman, for sure. EJ Gaines? Corey Graham? Leon Hall for slot, I think.  Safeties... Eric Reid... Reshad Jones?"
minnesotavikings,3csrcz,vbullinger,-1,Fri Jul 10 14:49:07 2015 UTC,Josh Sitton is regarded as the best if not second best guard in the league by just about anyone worth a damn.
minnesotavikings,3csrcz,NicoSuave2020,2,Fri Jul 10 15:03:10 2015 UTC,... He didn't mention Sitton. Is there a reason you brought him up specifically?
minnesotavikings,3csrcz,Settler_of_Catan,-1,Fri Jul 10 23:30:50 2015 UTC,I was reiterating his point.   EDIT: do you people know what reiterating means?
minnesotavikings,3csrcz,NicoSuave2020,-2,Sat Jul 11 00:20:48 2015 UTC,Joe Flacco is not underrated. He's just an average QB making elite QB cash. I suppose he is the definition of overrated.

minnesotavikings,3cvykf,Fireslasher10101,4,Sat Jul 11 05:55:59 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Walsh was bad last year. Not all of it was his fault, but still... he was pretty bad."
minnesotavikings,3cvykf,istasber,3,Sat Jul 11 10:55:13 2015 UTC,"It's very difficult for most football people (me included) to evaluate special teams.  One thing I'd add is that it was a bad year for the holder and an extremely bad year for the long snapper. With that in mind, I'd say that though Walsh is in the bottom half, he's not near the bottom.  As for Matt Miller--I disagree with him a lot, but I think this sub is bagging him too much. He's not just an extremely hard worker, but a good evaluator. There's a reason he's been offered positions with multiple NFL teams. I think he's better than CBS' Rob Rang. Dane Brugler (also with CBS, but technically with a subordinate organization) is better than both imo, but there you go."
minnesotavikings,3cvykf,ArifHasanDN,3,Sat Jul 11 20:14:58 2015 UTC,Don't know who he is. I do know that's an unreliable site. So I guess I don't give a shit about his opinion.
minnesotavikings,3cvykf,YoKellyDude,-4,Sat Jul 11 10:12:23 2015 UTC,"He's kind of a joke. There are a few people around here that love him to death (probably because of his purple hard on) but his rankings are outrageous.   He ranked Hodges well over Barr, Blanton as the number 7 safety, and Teddy above Newton, Stafford, and Rivers. Pretty ridiculous, IMO."
minnesotavikings,3cvykf,nomaam05,4,Sat Jul 11 13:37:08 2015 UTC,That's why I like Miller. I don't always agree with his rankings but at least he doesn't just regurgitate the media/fan consensus for everything. I like him better for draft analysis though.
minnesotavikings,3cvykf,pingpongguy,4,Sat Jul 11 15:02:24 2015 UTC,"That's why I hate him. It's one thing to not say what everyone else is saying, but it's a whole different animal to be so crazy about it, that fans of the players you rank too high call you out on it. I don't think it's interesting to read that Teddy was better than Rivers last year, because, not matter how much we love Teddy, not matter how much kool aid someone wants to drink, we all know he wasn't better than Rivers last year.   Rivers had an insane season last year and was better in every statistical category other than INT%."
minnesotavikings,3cvykf,nomaam05,0,Sat Jul 11 15:15:25 2015 UTC,"Hodges was probably better than Barr last year. Having Blanton that high seems dumb, and Rivers was clearly better than Teddy, but hey, I agree with pingpongguy, it's refreshing to read what somebody going against the consensus has to say."

I seriously, cannot follow that logic in the least. That would be like saying it's refreshing to see the number of DUIs are at the lowest point they've ever been in America, even though it's not true.   Refreshing to me, would be if everyone ranked Teddy far too low, and someone stepped in, and ranked him where he should be, not when some people rank him too low, some rank him right around where he should be, and one guy ranks him above players (at the very least one) that he definitively wasn't better than."
minnesotavikings,3cvykf,nomaam05,2,Sat Jul 11 15:42:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's refreshing the way these rankings are set up (i.e. by weighting properties, assigning players values based on their performance for each of the properties, and then ranking players based on their overall score), but I don't take them that seriously since there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to how the values are assigned."
minnesotavikings,3cvykf,istasber,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:45:16 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot more sense, and I can agree with that.

He's going against the consensuses, by giving, what we agree are bad rankings (agree for 2 of the 3 at least.)   I understand why you would like the system itself, and even find it refreshing, but not the guy that using that system in a flawed manner.

While I do agree there are some questionable rankings, I still think it's refreshing to see something different. Obviously you think too lowly of some of these rankings to respect them, but I don't. I like Matt and value his opinions. Take it for what it is and move on. I guarantee you he knows more about football than either of us.   EDIT: also your DUI analogy makes zero sense to me"

So sorry I asked valid questions, but thanks the snarky reply.   And I'm not sure how you don't understand the DUI analogy. If someone told you DUIs were at an all time low (or that Teddy was better than Rivers last year) it sounds great, until you realize how false it is. Sorry you're having so much trouble.   Maybe he knows more about football than you, but anybody that says Teddy had a better year than Rivers has pretty questionable football knowledge, or is cherry picking stats to make certain players look better at the very least.

minnesotavikings,3cr4sh,nomaam05,9,Fri Jul 10 07:42:17 2015 UTC,"I guess I have no idea how good/bad of a teammate he was, but after reading his book and following him actively on social media for awhile, I see no real evidence--other than occasional pretentious attitudes--that's point towards him being a poor human being. He's liberal and that pisses some people off, but to say he's a bad person?? In the words of Tom Jackson: C'mon man."
minnesotavikings,3cr4sh,cashmoneythuggin,15,Fri Jul 10 08:15:47 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with him being a liberal. The guy tried to ruin someone's career over what other players called a joke. And while the comment Priefer made was inappropriate, and out of line, it was still a joke.   Why is it being a joke important? Because Kluwe likes to engage in inappropriate, out of line jokes in the locker room himself, and admitted to cutting a hole in the seat of his pants and saying he was a PENN STATE VICTIM, which he tried to justify by saying that half the team did it. Yeah, that makes shitty, off base jokes okay. If only half the team made gay jokes, we wouldn't even still be talking about this jerkoff. So, obviously, he's a major hypocrite, and that's really not even up for debate. And I would say trying to get a coach fired for doing the same shit you did in the locker room, makes you a shitty teammate.   As a person, he's told people that criticized him during the lawsuit to kill themselves via ""mainlining bleach."" Sounds pretty shitty. How about the time he claimed that ""two very well known Vikings players were caught in a compromising situation with an underage girl"" but never gave a single shred of details to the news, or more importantly, the authorities about it? Probably, because he made it up, because it was right after the Penn State joke allegations came out, and he was trying (and failing) to get the heat off him.   He was fired for having the 9th highest salary, in a very expendable position, and was replaced by someone that cost a fourth of what he did, who happened to not pan out, which gave him the ammunition he needed. He just HAD to start a fight because he was so ""obviously"" fired for speaking out about gay rights. Give me a break. He was fired because they found someone cheaper, and thought it was beneficial to drop him. And let's face it, keeping Kluwe wouldn't have magically turned us into a playoff team. That million dollars they saved cutting Kluwe was utilized finding talent that will improve the team, at a sacrifice of have a slightly worse punter than what Kluwe might have been.   He's a piece of shit, and without a doubt, yeah, he's a bad person. Being a gay rights advocate doesn't erase what he's done. Not even close."
minnesotavikings,3cr4sh,nomaam05,5,Fri Jul 10 08:42:59 2015 UTC,"This was very well said. He was a big hypocrite. A coach can't joke about gays, but you can joke about pedofiles!? When I heard about that, I lost full respect for him. Also, that he waited till the season was over (and realizing no other team would pick him up), to then criticize the Vikings for cutting him."

minnesotavikings,3cr4sh,cashmoneythuggin,-4,Fri Jul 10 15:18:18 2015 UTC,"Eh, Kluwe was trying to make fun of how shitty Penn State looked because of the whole ordeal and just did it extremely poorly.  What was Preifer's ""joke"" intended to do?  Besides if it was just a harmless joke why did Preifer feel the need to lie about it multiple times?  Kluwe's definitely arrogant and abrasive but I wouldn't really says he's a hypocrite since it's quite a stretch to equate what he did to was Preifer did.  It's not like he's the only proponent for change who's done a few shitty things; Thomas Jefferson/John F. Kennedy/ Martin Luther King Jr. etc...

I guess it's not as easy for me to believe someones bullshit they pull out weeks after giving a reason, in order to try and save face.   Even if it was his intention (which is obviously false. How does cutting a hole in the seat of your pants while calling yourself a Penn State Victim, make fun of how they handled the situation), it doesn't make any less of a shitty thing to say, nor does it make him any less of a hypocrite for get all pissy when someone else makes a joke that might offend someone."

minnesotavikings,3cr4sh,Eargoe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:29:30 2015 UTC,I still think Locke is salvagable even though it's not really seen as possible for a punter.  He was amazing in college and set a bunch of records for punts landing in certain ranges from the endzone(within 5/10/etc..)  Then I believe his first offseason before training camp he spent time with some rugby guys learning how to kick the ball to spin in backwards and attempt to be of high accuracy. I'm not sure if that's a reason for his low average punt distance but I feel like if it were a problem that we'd address it sooner.

minnesotavikings,3cozv9,BarackSays,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:34:27 2015 UTC,Good point. The drive to add more games is probably stemming from owners wanting to make more money.

minnesotavikings,3cpxsg,OnceInABlueMoon,3,Fri Jul 10 02:23:28 2015 UTC,"The Vikings need to reaffirm that they're making wise choices selecting players.  The coaches need to reaffirm that they're good at coaching up players, and developing good systems.  Teddy needs to show he's at least an above-average NFL QB, and not get any serious injuries.  It shouldn't matter too much how well AD does, as he's unlikely to be a big factor in 2017 - they need to show they can run their offense effectively without having an elite RB on hand."

minnesotavikings,3cocw5,datekman,21,Thu Jul 9 13:52:56 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of talent, young talent, on this team... But, I don't foresee them being the best defense in the NFL.  Although I don't think top 6 is out of reach.  For this young team, ironically, I think that it comes down to the vets;  Do Robison, Greenway, and Newman have the ability to perform at adequate levels (for a top defense)?   I love that this is even a discussion."
minnesotavikings,3cocw5,escapeclaws,11,Thu Jul 9 15:21:43 2015 UTC,"If we are to have the best defense in the NFL, everyone has to live up to their potential. So for the sake of argument and kool aid, let's assume that happens.   Griffen stays the course Joseph hovers around average and Floyd breaks out Robison splits reps with Crichton and both do a serviceable job Greenway leads Kendricks and Barr into greatness Rhodes, Waynes, are shut down corners. Smith is Smith, Blanton continues to improve (Exum?)   Is that defense the best in the NFL? It could be."
minnesotavikings,3cocw5,spokenflow22,8,Thu Jul 9 16:32:24 2015 UTC,"The offense needs to have good time of possession, convert third downs, and keep the defense rested."
minnesotavikings,3cocw5,Khatib,13,Thu Jul 9 17:39:32 2015 UTC,Just having AD back should help increase time of possession.
minnesotavikings,3cocw5,spokenflow22,4,Thu Jul 9 17:41:31 2015 UTC,That's true too. Having a strong running game should help.

minnesotavikings,3cocw5,sand0789,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:50:54 2015 UTC,"There are 32 teams in the NFL, so it isn't likely that the Vikings will have the best defense of all of them.  Just the way it is.    But for them to jump from 14th (yards) and 10th (points) up to top 5 this season, given the fact that the defense is younger than most, would not be really all that remarkable or crazy if it happened.  Then perhaps the following season they could make 1st.  I'm not trying to say this is likely.  But if it happens, nobody is going to be ""shocked"" or whatever.  NFL teams can move up and down pretty quickly.  (But the better you get, the harder it is to make big jumps, since you won't be drafting as high and the salary cap is going to start taking bites.)"

We all know Cordarrelle's physical abilities are off the freaking charts, but that wasn't his problem last season. Poor route running, possibly checking out of plays, and the mental aspect of the position are what plagued him all last season. You can legitimately say he is the 4th or 5th WR on this team after last season, and I am interested in seeing how he responds, and if he can bring back the magic he had in his rookie season."
minnesotavikings,3co8k3,alexandercr8,5,Thu Jul 9 14:12:36 2015 UTC,"The whole ""4th or 5th best receiver on this team"" tag has been passed along a lot in the past year or so, but one fact still remains for me:  If I had to pick one of our receivers to have possession of the ball in the open field, I would pick Cordarrelle #1 in a landslide. I think that notion is why we all have such high hopes for a guy that is fairly noted as the 4th or 5th best guy at his position right now based on his inconsistencies."

If we didn't have him burning people for kick-off returns for TD's and great field position. Blair Walsh would have been a lot less effective.  Then theres the Detroit, Philly, and Baltimore game where he made defenders look flat out stupid. However this offense has moved towards being more consistent and having greater intricacy. His lack of development as a true receiver showed. This offense is very well structured as this point to have multiple facets to attack with. AP n the run/play-action, with Rudolph and some big guys on the End. Jarius Wright has been explosive, Wallace is expected to be better than Jennings, Johnson has shown ability. I gotta believe Patterson is better than Thielen and more athletic than Diggs. But its still promising to know those last 2 seem like great options for depth."

minnesotavikings,3co8k3,drawingdead0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:52:47 2015 UTC,"Based on the angle, it looks like he's either late in a deep 2 or the corner wasn't there and he's the deep safety in cover 1. This angle doesn't give us a very accurate portrayal of what's going on"
minnesotavikings,3co8k3,BDillz28,3,Thu Jul 9 22:47:15 2015 UTC,It's also OTAs. Defensive players are at a disadvantage in shorts.
minnesotavikings,3co8k3,drawingdead0,0,Thu Jul 9 21:20:41 2015 UTC,"Blanton is sub par at every attribute you want your safety to have. Slow to react, poor instincts, doesn't come down hill to tackle, and poor awareness.   Not sure where the misconception that ins't that bad came from."

minnesotavikings,3co8k3,drawingdead0,2,Fri Jul 10 01:26:42 2015 UTC,He was penalized on punt and kick-offs repeatedly for being a fucking moron. Idiotic penalties are a good way to end up in Zim's doghouse
minnesotavikings,3co8k3,swampsparrow,3,Fri Jul 10 01:44:36 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I remember that. Wasn't that like preseason though? Last year? I don't think it's persisting."

minnesotavikings,3co8k3,BDillz28,2,Fri Jul 10 02:03:32 2015 UTC,Huh. I have like no recollection of that. Oh well.
minnesotavikings,3co8k3,drawingdead0,2,Fri Jul 10 02:04:44 2015 UTC,"Sometimes stats lie. This is one of those cases, i could walk you through plays and point out his errors, while he may make the tackles they occur while he's getting run over, and not him coming down hill.   The guy may need 3 yards for a first down, and Blanton will tackle him after 5 yards. Yeah he gets a good rating on PFF for making the tackle, but he hurts the team.   The other team throws a pass and Blaton's first step is bad, the pass is completed. He winds up making the tackle and it was the corners guy, but he could've made a play on the ball, but was too slow.   It's a toss right, Blanton shoulda had an angle to come up and make the tackle behind the line, but he has a slow first step, takes a bad angle, and gets the guy 6 yards down the field instead.   It was stuff like this on almost every play, i could show u if i have film, but i don't. Yeah he looks good in the stat book, but he is actually hurting the team."

minnesotavikings,3coa8z,escapeclaws,7,Thu Jul 9 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"Teddy. Easy. But for one game, today? I'd rather have Stafford."
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,vbullinger,2,Thu Jul 9 16:45:50 2015 UTC,Cutler is toxic
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,Jacobie23,40,Fri Jul 10 06:33:00 2015 UTC,"Not yet. Of course not. I fucking love the kid, but he's not provably better than even Cutler yet.  I think he WILL be. I think he'll be better than Stafford before long...but not yet."
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,youvebeengreggd,21,Thu Jul 9 14:14:58 2015 UTC,"Stafford and Cutler have huge arms. Stafford makes less mistakes, but he hasn't ascended to that elite level yet despite having a ton of talent at the WR position. Cutler is a gunslinger, he has a big arm, but he makes a ton of mistakes. Teddy doesn't have the physical tools of either, but so far he has shown that he is smart. Whether or not he can take the next step remains to be seen. We have no idea what Teddy's ceiling is.... yet. This year will tell us a lot.   I'd say right now it's    stupid idiot in GB Stafford (although I don't think he is as good as people think he is). Cutler - Teddy will likely take this spot from him by midseason.  Teddy - He is only 22 with 12 starts under his belt. He will improve, but we just don't know what his ceiling is yet. We know what the other 3 qbs are."
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,CopyCenterPhil,7,Thu Jul 9 14:41:16 2015 UTC,stupid idiot in GB   Beautiful
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,BarackSays,21,Fri Jul 10 00:45:47 2015 UTC,No. Rodgers and Stafford are better QBs.
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,schwertfeger,5,Thu Jul 9 13:40:58 2015 UTC,"If Cutler is only meltdown mode Jay and never returns to form, then yes, I think so. Of course, like Jay, he could regress and then not be.  I think Stafford is overrated. He puts up counting stats because they attempt 3093 passes a game, and what percent of his career is simply ""get it in the vague direction of Megatron""? (He's done enough that he's almost certainly not a bad QB buoyed by a great receiver, but I think people are too quick to count him among the top qbs.)"
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,vita10gy,15,Thu Jul 9 14:48:57 2015 UTC,"I'm excited to see what Teddy can do, but there's no way I can say he's better than 2 other Pro Bowl QBs. It is just too soon with too small of a sample size. Now, I love what I see out of Teddy(dat pocket presence doe), haven't been this stoked for a season since 2009, so let's just enjoy the ride."

minnesotavikings,3coa8z,antidid4,3,Thu Jul 9 15:26:35 2015 UTC,"I would take Teddy over Stafford in the long term based on potential.  In other words, I think Teddy's ceiling is higher.  I might even take year 2 Teddy over year 7 Stafford.  Still I don't think you can say Teddy ""is"" the 2nd best QB in the division, but I have complete confidence that he will be.  Another important factor is money.  Quarterbacks that are good early in their careers can really help their team by letting them invest in other positions.  Stafford's contact is a fucking boat anchor at this point and was never all that favorable since he was drafted before the new CBA/rookie pay scale."
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,Aram_Fingal,5,Thu Jul 9 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"Currently no, but after this year I think he will be."
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,pingpongguy,2,Thu Jul 9 14:48:11 2015 UTC,"After this season he may be. But right now, no. Lets not get carried away after he had one pretty good season."
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,Remnants,5,Thu Jul 9 18:12:21 2015 UTC,"Matt Stafford is 3-32 in his career against teams that finished the season with a winning record. He throws to Calvin Johnson and now Golden Tate. He is hot garbage camouflaged by weapons.  Jay Cutler might be better than Teddy by virtue of being a veteran. He was fucking terrible last season, however. He's also a cancer.  Aaron Rodgers is beyond reproach. Fuck him.  Based on that 3-32 stat, I'm gonna say that Teddy is the second best QB in the division, and even if he isn't, he will be by December."
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,themoertel,2,Thu Jul 9 16:35:55 2015 UTC,Teddy's 0-4 against winning teams FWIW
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,swing_first,0,Fri Jul 10 00:45:22 2015 UTC,0-4 can still turn into 31-4. 3-32 will probably never sniff .500. Point taken though. The stat is meant to demonstrate that Stafford is overrated more than anything.
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,themoertel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:12:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly. People think Stafford is Godly because he won a game with a sepersted shoulder. Big whoop, he has the best receiver in the league, by far. How is it people always bashed Ponder with ""he just hands it to AD all day"" yet Stafford gets a pass? His stats drop off whenever Megatron is hurt."
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,NorthBlizzard,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:22:26 2015 UTC,Solid reasoning. In Teddy Throwsevelt we trust.

minnesotavikings,3coa8z,QuixoticViking,2,Thu Jul 9 19:59:01 2015 UTC,But we did beat a team that made it to the divisional round! beat them badly too.
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,Eargoe,0,Fri Jul 10 03:03:39 2015 UTC,"Stafford has had a few years of playoff-caliber teams and 35 chances to beat winning teams. Teddy had last year's team and 4 chances to beat winning teams. I'll take 0-4 over 3-32 any day of the week, thanks."
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,themoertel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:58:40 2015 UTC,I'd start him over Cutler. Wouldn't be fair to Stafford. Certainly not Rodgers.  I don't think I'm spilling the beans by saying Teddy will never be better than Rodgers. But we're making up for it with out Stout defense.
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,SpYf3R,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:58:30 2015 UTC,Of course your not spilling the beans but never say never. No one thought Rodgers would explode the way he did. Is it unlikely that Bridgewater will reach that level? Sure. But impossible? No way.

minnesotavikings,3coa8z,KingCardinal17,2,Sat Jul 11 01:22:42 2015 UTC,Teddy does have a higher career QB rating than Stafford or Cutler.
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,jmcdon00,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"I would say so, adjusting for surrounding talent and such. He's slightly above Stafford, but a decent chunk above Cutler, IMHO."
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,MegatonMessiah,0,Thu Jul 9 18:13:58 2015 UTC,I think he is. One could argue Stafford but after watching a lot of the Lions games from last year I would say HE is what held them back from being a great team. I don't think it's even a debate with Cutler. I can't believe how many people in here seem to think he is clearly better than Teddy.
minnesotavikings,3coa8z,NicoSuave2020,0,Thu Jul 9 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"Okay, calm down"

minnesotavikings,3cnz0k,HoodByAir_88,6,Thu Jul 9 11:31:18 2015 UTC,What's the price on those bad boys?
minnesotavikings,3cnz0k,aMinnesotaBro,4,Thu Jul 9 14:34:12 2015 UTC,"http://media.bizj.us/view/img/1915031/vikingsstadiumsblmap.jpg  There's the ticket prices. You should probably contact the Vikings, I don't know what is still available(good seats might not be available).   If you don't mind uppers I think the best value is going to come after this season when they sell all the non-SBL seats(nobody can buy those yet, only SBL seats)."
minnesotavikings,3cnz0k,jmcdon00,3,Thu Jul 9 15:07:08 2015 UTC,"For anyone confused looking at that.  Say you wanted 2 seats in yellow. You would have to pay $4000 ($2000 per seat * 2 seats) for the SBL. The SBL can be spread out over multiple years but for this example lets say you pay it up front.  After you pay for the SBL for both seats you can then buy tickets, which in that section will cost $2000 ($100 per game * 10 games * 2 seats).  All future years will just be $2000 (unless they raise prices) for seats since you already paid off the SBL the first year.  If you do not pay for the SBL completely up front then that $4000 will be spread over x amount of years. So if it's 4 years, you'd end up paying $3000 per year for the tickets for the first 4 years and then $2000 after the SBL is paid off."
minnesotavikings,3cnz0k,Remnants,3,Thu Jul 9 17:35:39 2015 UTC,"I justified the SBL as a 10 year investment(don't expect to ever be able to sell, just an investment in my personal entertainment). So my tickets cost $500, and the SBL is $500, I figure my cost is $550 per season, or $55 per game."
minnesotavikings,3cnz0k,jmcdon00,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:21:07 2015 UTC,plus interest if you don't pay off the SBL when the payment for the 2016 season tickets is due
minnesotavikings,3cnz0k,bacoon,7,Thu Jul 9 18:14:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely not and I don't care how nice the new stadium is or how much the tickets cost.  The best seats are at my house in front on my TV where I have unlimited access to my beer and snacks.  Also, the bathroom lines are shorter.  Don't get me wrong, I love going to sporting events and usually go to 2-3 games every season, but it just isn't worth it to pay face value on preseason games just to guarantee your tickets for other games.  I've also never paid face value on regular season games.  That said, I appreciate those of you who are subsidizing the team and my ability to get cheap tickets."
minnesotavikings,3cnz0k,Aram_Fingal,7,Thu Jul 9 16:12:09 2015 UTC,no problem. I am assuming you live in MN. i am returning the favor for your tax dollars building the nice new stadium :D
minnesotavikings,3cnz0k,bacoon,2,Thu Jul 9 18:40:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed. A couple other nice things about watching it at home is that my toes stay warm in the heart of winter, and the filming crews do such a great job in that I can see what's really going on. Especially with replays, and the football can be as large as my TV at times - which is nice when you don't have 20/20!  But every year I'll be making the trek to the stadium to watch a game or two. I can't wait to see the new stadium! Now, to convince my wife buying a brick if totally worth it..."
minnesotavikings,3cnz0k,thundrsnake,2,Fri Jul 10 06:13:16 2015 UTC,"I got my seat selected already for the new stadium. Sect 343 row C   The biggest cost is the Seat license. Cost me 3.5k for two seats, but they spread it over 3 payments (2 of which I've paid, last due at the end of the 2015 season). It is an actual 'asset' because i own the license and can resell it in the future.

minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,vsky,7,Thu Jul 9 12:34:28 2015 UTC,I assume you're trolling but just in case you're not... That net is meant to simulate a defender in shallow zone coverage. It's a common training gimmick that is seen frequently in the Viking's offseason videos. The QB is supposed to throw over the linebacker (the net) and to the receiver (guy with baseball glove).
minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,7th_Cuil,0,Thu Jul 9 12:50:08 2015 UTC,"Understood. They also use the net to throw into specific targets as well. That said, look at the front end of the video, the throw he makes to the WR isn't great.   Everyone needs to chill on this sub. You make 1 critique of a 2nd year QB and everyone downvotes you because 'you're dumb.' I wasn't trolling, I was being honest. It's OK to acknowledge a potential area of improvement."
minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,vsky,3,Thu Jul 9 16:59:32 2015 UTC,"Well, you were being honest but you you were also critiquing it partially based on an incorrect assumption.

minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,7th_Cuil,2,Thu Jul 9 22:47:56 2015 UTC,"The accuracy/ball placement did seem to be off on quite a few of these throws. I'm hoping that gets better, but it probably won't get better until he makes his throwing motion more consistent. I'm happy that his other qualities make up for it more or less. His decision making and anticipation have been helping with that."
minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,ull90,3,Thu Jul 9 15:02:34 2015 UTC,I agree 100%. You make 1 comment about a 2nd year QB and everyone freaks out because apparently we're supposed to treat him like a hall of famer.
minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,vsky,-1,Thu Jul 9 17:00:13 2015 UTC,"No dummy , that drill is shown in another video, he's supposed to hit the guy over the net. Its an arc drill, get it over the net but drop it to the guy just behind it. He misses that net by like two inches , its a ridiculous through. I've been a fan if the Vikings since 67' and have been a student of quarter backs. I'm telling you all that was an amazing display of accuracy and timing, remember 70% last year(6 games) that means he's doing that 7 out of 10 times , everyone of those receivers were able to go for extra yards because of where he threw it. He's one of the most natural throwers I've ever seen. He's gunna be stupid good in this offense."
minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,Independentthought0,3,Thu Jul 9 13:03:11 2015 UTC,"Teddy is a good quarterback, but he does not have a good throwing motion. His inconsistent mechanics have caused incompletions and interceptions. When he throws, often times, the ball will shoot past his ear. This is a very low release and causes his throws to sail on him and be high. See the screen to Wright at the end of the jets game or the interception thrown when targeting Johnson in the second lions game. He does place the ball nicely at times despite his inconsistent mechanics and sometimes he'll throw with a good throwing motion. He does not have a natural throwing motion, though. It's only occasionally that he throws with a good motion. I can't believe you'd say he's the most natural thrower you've ever seen when we play Rodgers twice per year.   What teddy does have that makes up for some of his ball placement issues is good decision making and improving anticipation. When you do those things, the defense doesn't have time to react to a ball that was maybe thrown a little high or behind.   His mechanics and motion are something he can improve, though. If he does make them better and more consistent, he could be very, very good."
minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,ull90,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:39:38 2015 UTC,"The screen with Wright is a play you don't get your fingers on the laces, you don't have time. I don't know what your talking about he's an extremely natural thrower with a very quick release. The only thing he does is drop his elbow and wrist a little to much and it will sail, but that comes in him from relaxing too much which is actually a good thing. It also comes from his great touch. A little wrist our elbow drop is what you use in touch passes."
minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,Independentthought0,2,Thu Jul 9 20:38:59 2015 UTC,"His elbow was dropped when he threw that ball to Wright and it sailed. That very easily could have gone for no gain because he threw the ball like that. That's not how you throw touch passes. If you watch the best QBs in the league, that's not how they throw with touch. It's a very inefficient way to throw the ball. The best passers will use, basically, the same throwing motion for every pass. The only thing they will change is velocity and trajectory, unless there are extenuating circumstances that cause them to throw side arm or do something weird. Teddy has a quick release, but it's not a natural motion. If you want to see a real, natural motion, watch Rodgers. When he throws with touch, he doesn't drop his elbow. Watch him throw a screen pass over linemen. His motion is always up and over, it's not firing out of his shoulder. He just lessens the velocity and increases the trajectory.   Remember the preseason game against the cardinals when Thielen kept jumping up to catch Teddy's passes? That's what happens when you drop your elbow. If relaxing too much is causing his passes to sail, it's not a good thing. It's good to have a calm demeanor and confidence. It's not good to throw bad passes. He has things to fix. You can't have a ""natural"" throwing motion if you still have to work to fix things."
minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,ull90,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"Comparing him to Rodgers is silly, he's the gold standard throwing motion after 10 years. This early on of course he will have his moments of in accuracy, and yes the deep ball is thrown by not coming over the top of the ball as quickly, which is dropping the angle of your wrist, you just need to not drop the wrist height along with it."
minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,Independentthought0,2,Thu Jul 9 21:15:32 2015 UTC,"Derek Carr has a more natural throwing motion. Ponder does too. I wasn't the one really comparing him to Rodgers, though, originally. You were when you said he is the most natural thrower you've ever seen. And now you're saying Rodgers is the ""gold standard"" for throwing motions.   ""You just need to not drop the wrist height along with it."" Teddy drops the wrist height very often, which is the only thing I was claiming. You don't throw touch passes by dropping the elbow (and thereby the height of the wrist).   I just don't get how you can say that teddy is the most natural thrower you've ever seen when he has such noticeable issues in his throwing motion. Especially when there's players like Luck out there."
minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,ull90,0,Thu Jul 9 21:28:38 2015 UTC,"I'll say 70% completion rate suggests its not a consistent flaw. Flaw is different than natural, the balls he throws to Ford and Jennings were perfect throws especially his ability to drop it down the chimney in a short distance like the Ford throw. If you look at his Louisville tape he does that quite a few times."
minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,Independentthought0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:28:28 2015 UTC,"Completion rate doesn't necessarily tell you about a throwing motion flaw. He completed a lot of throws while displaying this flaw (for example, the screen to Wright or the deep pass to Wright vs. Carolina and many others). The completion percentage (btw, don't cherry pick the completion percentage at 70 when, over the entire season, it was closer to 64) was more likely a product of his decision making and anticipation than it was accuracy.   No one is denying that he made good throws. The only thing I'm denying is that he has such a natural throwing motion. I mean, this should be very noticeable for most people. It'd be very easy for someone to just put the throwing motion side by side with Rodgers'.   The throws you mention are more outliers than they are the rule. His throwing motion needs work, there's nothing wrong with that. It can get better. It's just not the most natural motion in the world and he isn't a very natural thrower as a result of that."
minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,ull90,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:34:55 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with you, natural throwers can throw when your mechanics can't be perfect ie people at your feet , especially moving, Rogers and Farve both did that well and so does Teddy. A natural thrower can adjust to those things , mechanical throwers need a clean pocket for accuracy. Natural is more timing and feel , mechanical is technical. Though they have touch and accuracy Brady and Manning are more mechanical and technical where Rodgers and Farve have that natural feel. Rodgers is probably the best at both."
minnesotavikings,3cn1fp,Independentthought0,2,Fri Jul 10 06:42:21 2015 UTC,All these years of studying quarterbacks and you don't spell the position correctly?  There are also drills where they throw the ball into the different targets in the net.

minnesotavikings,3cnye8,nomaam05,14,Thu Jul 9 12:06:43 2015 UTC,"No judgment, but as a general rule, I only read Bleacher Report articles when I am (A) bored and/or (B) completely tapped on Vikings' news. In neither scenario do I ever (A) consider it legitimate information and/or (B) worthy of comment.  While Blanton's stats continued to surprise me last season, he rarely passed the eyeball test.  Like Hodges and Greenway (until last season), the most over-inflating stat are tackles.  Unless you are dropping Luke Kuechly-like totals, it's just not a good representation of a player's skill/worth on the field."
minnesotavikings,3cnye8,BeardedMN,6,Thu Jul 9 12:18:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for mentioning tackles. It gets way too often cited as a 100% definitive way to evaluate a defensive player. On like a DT, maybe, or a linebacker, but as a safety? You're responsible for way too many things for tackle stats to be more than a piece of the puzzle. Really any stats, for that matter. It's so hard to quantify defensive production.   I mean, it's not disputable to say he was good against the run and his tackling form is good. But that doesn't make a complete safety. His hesitation and instincts cost us plays, period. He made plays and gave up plays. Sort of like having an offensive lineman who can maul on the run but struggles on the pass. Maybe a more well-rounded player can usurp him. Maybe his mauling is still enough to make up for his struggles.  One thing I will say about Blanton that I don't think I've given enough credit to- his improvement. He seemed to be a little faster and a little more instinctive as the year went on. If that trajectory improves, he can definitely be a solid starter. But #7 in the league is kind of a joke if you ask me."

minnesotavikings,3cn8sg,drawingdead0,3,Fri Jul 10 02:03:18 2015 UTC,"According to a couple articles on the subject, I'm hearing a recovery time of 4-6 months for good use.  Remember to add to that at least a few weeks to re-acclimate to playing physically/mentally.  The pessimistic view is that he's out for the season, only getting back to strength possibly in time for playoff season.  The optimistic view is that he'll come back near the end of the regular season and play... well we don't know how well, even as optimists :)  EDIT:  I'm pretty sure I'm wrong.  The announcements would've been much more clear.  Best I can find on Josh Robinson himself was that it was only a partial tear, and therefore can bet on an shorter recovery period.  The speculation from articles at the time is ""questionable to start the season."""

Scalpers around here are pretty tough to get any good deal so I would try checking craigslist up until there is an hour or so left before kickoff (shit happens and people try and get rid of them for face value the day of).

minnesotavikings,3cmcty,HoodByAir_88,2,Thu Jul 9 00:58:18 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with ""loosening the leash"" and not putting TOO much pressure on him, but I really don't think they are.  We as fans might be getting a little carried away at times, but for good reason for the most part.  I think there's a good chance he's our guy, but it's too early to say that before he's played another season or two.    I personally feel really good about him, and the fact we got him where we did.....I hope he improves each year like he did in college.  If he does, he's gonna be a beast"
minnesotavikings,3ckk7x,Luft5,2,Wed Jul 8 17:08:19 2015 UTC,"If he wins the starting position, it could mean having two very similar safeties, which would be great. Exum has similar strengths, but still needs to develop them. He's an exciting player to watch and it's going to be one of the most intriguing position battles."
minnesotavikings,3ckk7x,ull90,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:50:31 2015 UTC,"I really don't see why we need to replace Robert Blanton with an unproven player. Most sites rank Blanton as a good safety, and Bleacher Report has him ranked as the 7th best safety in the league. If they let go of Blanton, they can't afford not to get at least a 3rd round pick in return.  Hopefully, this means Antone Exum more than lives up to the hype.  At least whoever wins the starting job at SS has a high probability of being very good."
minnesotavikings,3ckk7x,AtlantaDogfighter,6,Wed Jul 8 19:02:44 2015 UTC,"Blanton isn't going anywhere, he might just become the backup instead of the starter. All of those sites vastly overrate him as well. He is alright, but we could use an upgrade."
minnesotavikings,3ckk7x,schwertfeger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:22:53 2015 UTC,"I half-agree with you. His coverage is a liability, and the kind of safety Zimmer needs for his scheme is someone who can play center field. However, he's a big help in the team's suspect run defense, and I'm not sure if we really added any personnel to improve our run defense.  I'm also curious about what Blanton could do if he were moved to slot corner. His scouting combine 40 wasn't a good reflection of his actual speed, his Notre Dame pro day had him run a 4.5 40yd dash.   There's a place for Blanton to stand out somewhere on this team. I wouldn't be surprised if he steals Captain Munnerlyn's job playing slot corner by the start of 2016. He has adequate short-area speed, he's a great tackler, and he has good length.  http://www.und.com/blog/2012/04/notes-from-pro-day-1.html"
minnesotavikings,3ckk7x,AtlantaDogfighter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:11:15 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with Blanton starting, but if he really was an above average safety, I doubt Zimmer would be so uneasy about that safety position. Blanton makes really good depth, but I feel we can do better."
minnesotavikings,3ckk7x,Staple_Overlord,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:48:30 2015 UTC,"Same feeling. Zimmer and Spielman talked Exum alot while making it very obvious the safety spot opposite of Smith is wide open. I don't what games these analyst watched, but Blanton certainly was not a top 10 safety."
minnesotavikings,3ckk7x,schwertfeger,8,Thu Jul 9 11:56:23 2015 UTC,"I've thought Blanton was underrated by fans, but I think both PFF and Matt Miller in that B/R piece overrated him quite a bit. I think he's an ""average"" safety in a league with uncommonly weak safeties, which makes him a liability. Good backup."
minnesotavikings,3ckk7x,ArifHasanDN,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:36:48 2015 UTC,"He makes a very good backup imo. But far from 7th best in the league, that's way out there."
minnesotavikings,3ckk7x,drawingdead0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:32:59 2015 UTC,"What is his value as a slot corner? He has just enough speed to play that role, he's a very good tackler, and on the surface his skillset seems versatile enough to cover both tight ends and slot receivers about as well as any slot receiver."
minnesotavikings,3ckk7x,AtlantaDogfighter,2,Thu Jul 9 17:31:20 2015 UTC,"He has limited agility in that context. I've also felt his react ability is not as good as his diagnose ability, which is why safety always made sense for him to me.  Obviously his testing numbers say a lot of positive things about his agility and for the most part they are correct about the aspects of agility they test (good stop-start and he can probably bend the edge if he needed to), but he just always has taken too many steps to do things and his hips are stiff in movement, especially transition. That's not particularly great for defending the two-way go.  Receivers got separation from him in college at the break almost always because he got turned around, or needed extra steps or was just slow to turn.  If you had him manned up against a tight end, I wouldn't worry too much about him staying with them athletically (though the height/weight disparity might be an issue, depending on the tight end), like I would for most slot receivers."
minnesotavikings,3ckk7x,ArifHasanDN,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:44:55 2015 UTC,"We will replace him, though, if Exum ends up being better. That's how training camp works. See, ""proven"" or ""unproven"" mean nothing when it comes to position battles. It's whoever plays better in the month+ of working with these guys every day. And most of that, we don't get to see, so we just kinda have to assume that if Exum is starting, he was objectively better."

minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,Dybs_On_That,15,Wed Jul 8 14:11:02 2015 UTC,Blanton is #7 and Smith is #3. Very surprised to see Blanton that high but Smith is no doubt a top 5 Safety.
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,ull90,7,Wed Jul 8 14:11:43 2015 UTC,"Blanton played much better than people think. I wouldn't put him that high, but he seemed about average."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,WhirledWorld,2,Wed Jul 8 14:44:05 2015 UTC,"Blanton was a liability in coverage but good in other areas.  PFF gave him a randomly good grade, but we all know he's not actually that good because he was benched for Sendejo late in the season.  I'd bet that these analysts just look at PFF's safety rankings and adjust up or down based on their own thoughts.  But that's lazy.  We all know Blanton is not a top ten safety."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,ull90,3,Wed Jul 8 16:15:28 2015 UTC,"I really don't think he was benched for Sendejo. Blanton was injured at the end of the season, so it could have something to do with that. I highly doubt Sendejo would start over him this season. If they did bench him for Sendejo, maybe it was just to check out our other options at safety. We're not satisfied with either Blanton or Sendejo. If anyone takes the starting spot from Blanton, it'll be Exum."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,WhirledWorld,4,Wed Jul 8 17:29:52 2015 UTC,"Blanton was out due to injury for week 14, when Sendejo took over, but Blanton was healthy in the last two weeks of the season (or at least listed as healthy) and Sendejo still played.  Could be that Blanton's ankle hadn't fully recovered, or it could be that Zim liked what he saw of Sendejo against the Lions."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,jjspaceman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:51:14 2015 UTC,"Could be a mix, Blanton recovering from injury, Vikings out of contention, so give Sendejo reps to see what he can do."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,ull90,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:53:26 2015 UTC,"Injuries do linger. Especially ankle injuries. Blanton started the Miami game, but got injured again. When he got injured, Exum came in. Then Exum injured himself and Sendejo came in. I highly doubt Zimmer really liked what he saw of Sendejo. Sendejo was no different by the end of the season from what he was at the beginning. Maybe we just decided not to risk reinjuring Blanton's ankle. At this point, we're just looking at our other options and hoping one stands out."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,ArifHasanDN,3,Wed Jul 8 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"Well, Zimmer did go out of his way to say that it was because Sendejo played well. The consistent feeling is that Blanton was benched.  Zimmer definitely said he liked what he saw of Sendejo and gave that as the reason for starting Sendejo. He has been pretty open in the past about whether or not an injury is the reason a guy isn't playing, so that would be a big break from tradition. Moreover, I don't really see the magnitude of the risk involved in reinjuring a player for the last game of the season. Reaggravating that injury doesn't really have an impact on the season and would almost certainly heal by the time training camp starts again."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,ull90,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:58:45 2015 UTC,"The reaggravation bit wasn't really meant to be the most probable reason. I was just throwing that out there to show that there could be quite a few different reasons they might not have a starter play the final game.   Your evidence doesn't really explain why Blanton started the Miami game and then left due to injury (or I assume it was due to injury). As far as I know, Blanton has been taking first team snaps in OTAs this off-season. I believe it's most probable that Zimmer just wanted an extra look at Sendejo before the end of the season."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,ArifHasanDN,2,Thu Jul 9 01:11:23 2015 UTC,"Sendejo started the Miami game. He started the last three games of the year. The Vikings announced it that way and then PFF tracked it as happening (Sendejo started the last three games according to them, too). Sendejo had a concussion early on, and then returned when he was cleared to play. I believe it is most probable that Zimmer's stated reason for starting Sendejo is the reason they employed when making the decision.  That stuff about OTAs is true, though."

minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,spokenflow22,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:39:24 2015 UTC,"PFF gave him a good grade because he was a good tackler and had a good run presence. I still maintain that he was too hesitant and late to a lot of plays, and that inflated his tackle stat. That said, you could do a lot worse."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,vbullinger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:12:36 2015 UTC,"He was much better in 2014 than in 2013 and he improved all year. I'm done complaining about him, even if I still don't like him and think they ranked him a little too highly."

minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,becomesthehunted,6,Wed Jul 8 15:04:35 2015 UTC,They gave weddle a perfect rating on pass defense when he allowed the same catches on less passes thrown on him? And only one pick.
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,ArifHasanDN,3,Wed Jul 8 15:01:45 2015 UTC,but no touchdowns allowed. maybe they weighted that like crazy
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,OnePlusOneEqualsOne,3,Wed Jul 8 15:16:17 2015 UTC,"Neither. PFF's grades and stats are not dependent on each other. They do not give a negative grade if something is in ""your coverage"" but not your fault, or if the throw was perfect and being in perfect coverage would not have done much. Moreover, they do not give positive grades if the player drops the ball or it's a bad pass but you were badly burned.  The grades and the stats are both useful, but I would not mistake the grade as a weird weighting of the stats. The plays are individually graded subjectively and the stats are handed out in a theoretically more objective fashion (though like any stat, it is also subjectively gathered)."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,ThreeDeep1998,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:00:31 2015 UTC,I fully expected to see Smith ranked lower - because people always seem to underrate him. It's nice to see him at #3.

minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,JohnathanTheBrave,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:52:31 2015 UTC,"Wait, I was under the impression SS was one of the holes in our roster... According to this we're looking pretty good."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,TheAesir,4,Wed Jul 8 15:42:43 2015 UTC,"That's because this sub has a deep hatred for Blanton.  He did get burned a few times during the season, and it stood out in this subs mind."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,JohnathanTheBrave,2,Wed Jul 8 17:26:09 2015 UTC,Getting burned as a safety in the NFL is one of the most demoralizing things to watch as a fan. Especially when your assignment is to cover deep.
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,TheAesir,5,Wed Jul 8 18:11:50 2015 UTC,There are days I wonder if this sub generally knows the difference between cover 1 and cover 2 man.
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,JohnathanTheBrave,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:08:36 2015 UTC,"Uhhh... Cover 1 is FS (Harrison Smith) covers deep middle and reacts to the play, SS (Blanton) most likely covers the tight end or rushes, and everyone else is man to man. Cover 2 man is safeties taking their respective deep halves of the field and corners cover wide receivers, offensive personnel would probably dictate whether we're in a base/nickel/dime situation, but all eligible receivers should be covered?  Pretry sure we mostly run a base cover 2?"
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,TheAesir,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:03:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry that comment wasn't directed entirely at you, more so users in this sub in general. We actually played quite a bit of cover 1 last season. A lot of the plays that people credit Blanton getting burned on are actually him coming from the underneath safety spot in cover 1 to try and help out."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,JohnathanTheBrave,0,Wed Jul 8 21:44:19 2015 UTC,"Idk the play in Chicago where Blanton looks absolutely retarded against Marshall stands out. That's just off the top of my head. I think Blanton was a fine safety, but he wasn't the seventh best safety in the league."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,ArifHasanDN,0,Thu Jul 9 01:23:11 2015 UTC,video?
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,NFLVideoConverterBot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:25:19 2015 UTC,"@ 0:51 I don't have a better angle, based on how close Blanton is at the end of the play though it's his responsibility to cover his half. And then missing a tackle at 2:06  EDIT: Actually, I'm not even going to say that it's likely Blanton's responsibility for his deep half at 0:51. It's fucking COVER FUCKING 1 and he gets beat 15 yards off the line of scrimmage when he's lined up 11 yards deep. That is just straight up, retarded blown coverage. No excuse at the NFL level.  I'll also take your's or whoever's downvotes I keep getting. Blanton is an average safety. I'd be happy for him to line up next to Smith in September. I'm not about to jerk him off like he's some fucking pro-bowler though because he's not."
minnesotavikings,3cjw9o,TheAesir,3,Thu Jul 9 01:36:24 2015 UTC,"This is a case where the broadcast lies. From the All-22, it is almost certainly Cover-2 man. GIF here. Munnerlyn is the other deep safety in this play and Blanton certainly screwed things up in transition. Both he and Robinson are at fault (and if you want to assign differential blame, Robinson is more at fault, even though Blanton screwed up more).  But I agree with your conclusion, even if not the analysis of the play—Blanton is an average safety."

minnesotavikings,3chyic,PostsNonSequitur,5,Wed Jul 8 06:39:54 2015 UTC,My first ever Vikings game was the season opener in 1998. Moss made his rookie debut and scored two awesome touchdowns.

minnesotavikings,3chpzv,adnasium,4,Wed Jul 8 01:16:16 2015 UTC,Seems like he did improve over the course of the year.  Can't wait to see if he takes another step forward this year.
minnesotavikings,3chpzv,istasber,3,Wed Jul 8 02:06:10 2015 UTC,"I like the music. As for cj, there was not a single contested catch or sideline toe tap in this video. That is a red flag. Maybe he just needs to stop getting so open or bridgewater could be a little more inaccurate and we would see some of those skills."
minnesotavikings,3chpzv,Fineyouwin,4,Wed Jul 8 02:20:46 2015 UTC,What I do see is a talented receiver who isn't scared to take a hit. That's a positive 👍🏿
minnesotavikings,3chpzv,ImKiddOH,3,Wed Jul 8 04:34:39 2015 UTC,"You can't get red flags from a highlight video. Sure, he didn't make many of those kinds of catches last year (maybe one or two), but you can't know that just by watching a highlight video. Maybe the guy who created the video just left them out for various reasons. Maybe there was never a good angle shown of the catch so it just wasn't worth putting in the video.   I also wouldn't call it a red flag. That's an exaggeration. These are things he can get better at."
minnesotavikings,3chpzv,ull90,5,Wed Jul 8 04:55:51 2015 UTC,"The dude had 31 receptions last year. Most of them were in the video. If the dude made the kind of catches last year I described (he didn't) they would be in the video. So I think it is fair enough. Regardless this takes place within the context of having watched all those games with my eyes.  I just wanna see him put together some of the receiver skills next year I haven't seen from him yet. A red flag is something you use to highlight a cause for concern. Considering I haven't seen him do the receiver type things I mentioned, it is a cause for attention/warning/ red flag."
minnesotavikings,3chpzv,Fineyouwin,2,Wed Jul 8 10:28:23 2015 UTC,"Again, I know he didn't make many of those catches. The fact that none of those kinds of catches appear in this video isn't cause for concern. The fact that he didn't make many may be cause for concern. Regardless, I see a red flag as something that's much more concerning and will prevent a player from being productive at all or could keep a player off the field for whatever reason. I'd call Johnson's lack of those kinds of catches a concern of mine. I've brought it up before on this sub. Red flag, to me, is just something more severe that probably will make a player unproductive and bad. Johnson isn't going to be spectacular unless he starts catching those balls, but he can still be productive. Difference in definition, I guess."
minnesotavikings,3chpzv,ull90,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:21:41 2015 UTC,"Your red flag was talked about. His knee injury prevented him from jumping. Your looking at a guy who did that with almost no ability to jump, he still wasn't fully healthy. And sorry if Teddy made it look too easy for you, you might want to think about how good a sign that video was. That 40 harder against the Jets looked easy because of how perfect Teddy threw that ball, especially the timing."
minnesotavikings,3chpzv,Independentthought0,0,Thu Jul 9 13:26:58 2015 UTC,Did you just hear yourself? We need Teddy to be a little more inaccurate...now go sit in the corner and think about what you did.
minnesotavikings,3chpzv,Independentthought0,3,Thu Jul 9 13:20:27 2015 UTC,He needs to work on securing the ball better. Before he dove to the end zone in the jets game he was one handing it and made me nervous
minnesotavikings,3chpzv,barukatang,3,Wed Jul 8 03:45:51 2015 UTC,"Nice vid.  Music was a little wearing for my taste and lacked suspense for the tape, but was leagues better than more more gangster rap."
minnesotavikings,3chpzv,kertusc,2,Wed Jul 8 04:03:53 2015 UTC,"I took a chance with the music... Probably should've went with a more mainstream flavor. Music selection is pretty a big deal, and I totally agree amateur gangsta rap is a deal breaker for me when watching highlights. Have to watch them on mute."
minnesotavikings,3chpzv,hoopdummy,3,Wed Jul 8 10:26:51 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, I really loved the music."
minnesotavikings,3chpzv,vita10gy,3,Wed Jul 8 14:26:25 2015 UTC,"Watching this made me feel like ""man, how were we so mediocre last year, Teddy is slinging it.""  Then I realized that many teams wouldn't have a highlight reel full of 6 yard drags and 11 yard slants and consider that exciting.  Turns out you're actually supposed to complete 4 yard stopping routes and such. We're just so hard up for an even moderately good passing game it's easy to forget sometimes that that in and of itself just holds serve against the top half of the league."

This one was written by a Vikings fan, so I hope that you agree with his decisions!  One question I have is: Are you guys as hyped for the Vikings this year as fans of other teams seem to be? You have a pretty good team on paper but there are a few noticeable holes - realistically, how far are you hoping to go this season?  If you have any feedback please share it, whether it's about the writing style or the rankings. Thanks guys!"
minnesotavikings,3ch28s,highque,10,Tue Jul 7 21:19:55 2015 UTC,I think we're going to go as far as Teddy is able to take us. A lot hinges on the fact that he still has lots to prove. We are solid in most other areas. If he can put up elite numbers then watch out for us in the playoffs.   It's a tough schedule. Tough division. So who knows. Any given Sunday.   Skol
minnesotavikings,3ch28s,MNBLIZZARD,4,Tue Jul 7 21:29:14 2015 UTC,"As most fans have said in previous posts, this is the best teams we could have since 09. This is the year where we could finish in second in the division and possibly make the playoffs as a wild card. Although all of this is dependent on AP coming back with a vengeance and Teddy making strides. Plus, nobody falling off from previous performances"
minnesotavikings,3ch28s,Dybs_On_That,3,Tue Jul 7 21:29:30 2015 UTC,"For the OLB portion, it isn't set in stone that Hodges will be the starter at WLB. Many think it will be decided in training camp but that Greenway has the edge until Hodges proves to be the better player."
minnesotavikings,3ch28s,cadderly09,9,Tue Jul 7 21:38:56 2015 UTC,I thought it would be   Barr     Kendricks           Greenway
minnesotavikings,3ch28s,Dybs_On_That,4,Tue Jul 7 23:27:21 2015 UTC,He has Kendricks as the inside linebacker in the article. The outside line backers are listed as Barr and Hodges.

minnesotavikings,3ch28s,Dybs_On_That,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:28:34 2015 UTC,I agree but I don't think its outside of the realm of possibility. Linebacker will be a need for us again in the 2016 draft.

minnesotavikings,3ch28s,Dybs_On_That,2,Wed Jul 8 14:33:45 2015 UTC,Jaylon Smith from Notre Dame for an OLB or if they move Kendricks to WLB they could go Reggie Ragland from Alabama or Dominique Alexander from Oklahoma.
minnesotavikings,3ch28s,cadderly09,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:48:12 2015 UTC,Thanks bro. I'll be watching them this season
minnesotavikings,3ch28s,ull90,2,Wed Jul 8 15:02:30 2015 UTC,"Hodges is not starting over Greenway. If we were ready to move on from him, we would have just cut him. And he's not even that good to begin with. Greenway is the starter until further notice. Hodges might compete, but Zimmer has said he doesn't even see Hodges as a Will. Zimmer has also said that the plan for Kendricks is to move him to Will in the future (likely when Greenway leaves). You don't say you have a plan to do that if you have a ""starting quality"", young linebacker that you think can play that position."

minnesotavikings,3ch28s,Ricky_Droschmidt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:50:45 2015 UTC,I think the WR portion was a bit lowballed but I sort of understand what he was trying to get at. As of now I'm almost positive the depth chart has J wright starting in the slot or WR3 and Thielen is probably WR4A Patterson being WR 4B depending on situation. Greenway also has the starting job at OLB over Hodges and I really don't think he was ever legitimately close to being cut.

Then I remembered he went 3 and Out after Jared Allen made that huge 3rd down sack after getting his nose bloodied by a cheap shot.

minnesotavikings,3cgc1k,CopyCenterPhil,50,Tue Jul 7 18:15:33 2015 UTC,"Vikes win 70-0, completing a sweep of the Packers for that season. In those two games, the Vikings outscored the Packers 140-0. McCarthy resigns. Aaron Rogers requests a release from GB and attempts to sign with the Vikings as Teddy's backup, saying ""There's clearly a lot I have to learn, and who better to learn from than Teddy?"". Eddy Lacy quits due to weight concerns, becomes a Weight Watchers spokesman and an avid leader in the ""gluten-free"" culture. Jordy Nelson is hit with depression and hangs up his pads for the final time to focus on his wife and kids, completely abandoning his career and never speaking of it again. Decades later, Jordy's kids and grandkids, who are Vikings fans, (without knowing their father was an all-star WR for GB) do some exploring in the basement, uncovering a dusty box full of pictures and DVDs of Jordy playing for GB. Shocked and confused, they confront him, but as they do he leaves to fight a bear to the death on Lambeau Field. His kin find out where he is, and as he narrowly defeats the bear, he looks at his kin and says ""You can't Flim-flam the Zim-Zam"" and turns into ashes; the wind carries and disperses the ashes as the sun peaks from the clouds upon Lambeau Field. Brett Favre's light-spirit appears from the sun, holding Thor's hammer, striking into the ground. The Earth shakes and Packers' stadium then crumbles around the family, like the ground and the tower in Lord of the Rings. Packers fans everywhere, all around the country, screech and sprint away, only to fall into the ground crumbling beneath them. After decades of misery the Green Bay Packers are no more."

I like our picks fine, and I'm excited about Kendricks and Barr I suppose, but there's also a reason he was there in the second round.

Then a bloody Jared Allen hypes the Dome dome up before a 3rd down getting the place so loud that TB is forced to take a timeout. Then to top it off Allen sacks Freeman and forces them to punt. I've never heard the Dome so loud. It was absolutely insane! Suck we couldn't capitalize on the momentum though.

Drafting Dalton presented its own issues, and now there's Teddy so it's good.  Rudolph in the second round and Fusco 6th help."

minnesotavikings,3cdxki,tree_l0rd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:51:22 2015 UTC,"Ponder would be a great back up or plain average starter.  I just feel like he never really got a chance.  New HC, new OC, new DC, the lock out, etc.  I always knew season one would be a train wreck but season two was great.  Seasone three? Injuries, new players, no support, etc.  Ponder might never be a big name QB but he could easily get 8-13 wins in the right system."
minnesotavikings,3cdxki,CodyRCantrell,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:01:48 2015 UTC,"Something went wrong with vision and information processing. Then it's moot on who ended up being open or his feet, arm, etc.  I would note Stafford, Eli Manning, Flacco, etc. can all have dud games on huge contracts or even some months/seasons went south before considering the upside that Ponder never shared, and his funk was just permanent. Not incapable as it worked in wk 17 2012. Dalton in a lesser tier can be awful for his team."
minnesotavikings,3cdxki,plasker6,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:53:28 2015 UTC,Did you watch the GB game last year?  Dude isn't even a fit backup.  You need a guy who will not make mistakes and can run an offense.  Ponder cannot do either of those things.  His IQ is the only thing keeping him on the field as a number 3.
minnesotavikings,3cdxki,whambamthankyoulamb,-2,Tue Jul 7 16:04:28 2015 UTC,Why would you have ever gotten a ponder anything?!?

minnesotavikings,3cdxki,CampBenCh,5,Tue Jul 7 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"Really? I had moments I liked the guy.   He came in during the lockout and didn't have a great mentor. He came in and immediately took on the Packers rivialry- even telling a little girl who said she was a Packer fan that, ""well we all make mistakes.""  He was an improvement from our current QB- Donovan ""the ground is my favorite Viking"" McNabb.   Ponder definitely had his bouts of bad plays and he had his good games too. I don't understand the hate. Vikings fans were crying for a new QB and Spielman complied.   It was clear the Vikings coaches didn't know what to do with him and everything about his career has been pretty shit luck. Ponder isn't an elite QB and IMO is still better than Joe Webb was.   I'm not saying people should like Ponder, but I don't understand how people act like he was the cause of those bad seasons."
minnesotavikings,3cdxki,mscarce,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:59:26 2015 UTC,I was just mad that the Vikings actually took him that early off the board and he hadn't really proved much of anything in college. I was actually really wanting Andy Dalton at the time and we passed up on him.

I've been to two preseason games in the past and you should be fine. People will say stuff to you, but as long as you don't mouth off to a bunch of drunk fans in a group, nobody is going to do anything to you.  I had the best experience(s) by chatting up the people sitting around you before the game starts, complimenting their team and just talking football for a bit. That way when the game starts getting heated later on, nobody does anything to you.  I usually go wearing full on purple, head to toe. I have shoes, jersey and hat. So I usually have a target on me and it's not that bad. I had a guy come up to me a couple years back wearing normal street clothes and he goes ""Hey nice jersey"" and then unzipped his jacket to show his jersey underneath. So you could always go that route too if you were worried."

Everyone already knows he's having a great season. And they all-star game (which isn't even comparable to a world cup, or one of the best NBA drafts of any team in recent memory) doesn't change that.

When I kept looking through the list too I noticed Packers CB Casey Hayward at number 6. I thought to myself. ""We could've/should've had him"" If my memory serves me right the Vikings were targeting him their 3rd round pick, but the Pack swooped in and got him before us. So we picked Josh Robinson instead."

minnesotavikings,3cb0at,dougnn55,3,Mon Jul 6 16:25:01 2015 UTC,Wow!  I almost completely agree with this list.  I think there are a lot of similarities between Patrick Peterson and Rhodes.  They have almost identical builds and are both very physical.  This is exciting because Rhodes has been in the league half the amount of time as Peterson.   Edit: I agree with the top portion of this list. I don't even know how to begin ranking corners outside of the top 20-25.

As far as him being on the roster bubble, we kept 6 CB's last season. Sure, we may want to change the amount we keep this year if Diggs shows some PR skills,  but Robinson likely will not get cut.  Especially with his injury. If anything we will put him on the PUP list.   EDIT: PUP instead of IR."
minnesotavikings,3cb0at,SkoalVikings,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:00:00 2015 UTC,He's super awesome in coverage which is why they took a corner in the first and brought a 36 year old Terrence Newman
minnesotavikings,3cb0at,Dorkamundo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:36:07 2015 UTC,"And?  It is obvious Robinson isn't good enough to be a starting CB against the type of receivers we have in the NFC north, but the acquisition of a veteran CB Zimmer has a history with in the offseason and the drafting of Waynes doesn't automatically mean Robinson is going to be cut."
minnesotavikings,3cb0at,SkoalVikings,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:06:42 2015 UTC,It means he's on the roster bubble. He's making idiotic comments on Twitter and is doing nothing to secure his roster spot. It depends on what they decide to do with Sherels. If they decide to keep him as a punt returner then it leaves one spot left open for another corner. If someone else does well in camp I wouldn't be suprised if they let him go. Robinson is a cover 2 corner. He was brought in for Les Fraizer's scheme.
minnesotavikings,3ccoy9,Xanthum1,6,Mon Jul 6 21:54:21 2015 UTC,"1300 yards, 8 TDs, 250 receiving yards, 3 TDs  I find it hard to picture him as a 1500-yard guy in our offense."
minnesotavikings,3ccoy9,SergeantFartbox,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:54:26 2015 UTC,"I like this; optimism tempered with realism. 1300 rushing yards would be exceptionally good for Peterson. If he had a season like that for 2 years in a row, he would be in the top 10 running backs of all time, which is where I think he belongs.  In response to OP: Smith's record is probably out of reach. If Adrian Peterson played be as old as Smith was when he retired (35), he would need 1600+ yards per season to catch up, which would probably be a very unrealistic expectation.  If Peterson plays until 38, he only needs to average around 1000 yards per year in order to make it to the top spot. But although that's a slightly more realistic path to the title, it's an unrealistic possibility from the longevity side of things.   Walter Peyton, Barry Sanders, and Emmitt Smith all played into their 30s, were among the greatest running backs of all time, but they all hung up their cleats well before 38. Jim Thorpe is said to have played professional football as a running back to the age of 40. So I guess it's theoretically possible? But that was a different time, and Jim Thorpe was likely a better athlete than even Adrian Peterson."
minnesotavikings,3ccoy9,agnostic_penguin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:21:50 2015 UTC,"In order for AP to even sniff some of the top records, we will have to surround him with a top offensive line for many years to come. If we hit on some of our Oline draft choices this year, I think it's possible."
minnesotavikings,3ccoy9,whambamthankyoulamb,3,Wed Jul 8 16:20:51 2015 UTC,"I think his stats will look something like this this season..  1,700 rushing yds/10 TDs  475 receiving yds/4 TDs  and by the end of his career I really think people will call him the best ever."
minnesotavikings,3ccoy9,BeardedBASTARD23,5,Mon Jul 6 22:26:18 2015 UTC,1700?! Not a chance.

minnesotavikings,3ccoy9,waterbuffalo750,2,Mon Jul 6 23:00:17 2015 UTC,Why not? You can't just say that isn't possible.
minnesotavikings,3ccoy9,schwertfeger,8,Tue Jul 7 00:07:35 2015 UTC,"That would be 265 yards more than his career average in rushing yards, 233 more than his career average for receiving yards (close to double), and 1 more TD than average.  It would be the second highest total yards in his career and only 139 less than his MVP year. Add in Turner's comments about using him more sparingly to keep him fresh and the fact that we have a decent passing attack (or at least better than Ponder-ball 2012) and it's extremely unlikely he touches that type of performance, even if he is the AP of old.  Not impossible but I'd put any amount of money on him not reaching those levels."
minnesotavikings,3ccoy9,pingpongguy,4,Tue Jul 7 00:30:00 2015 UTC,"It isn't as crazy as you think, if Peterson plays all 16 games.    If you pro-rate his career averages per game to a 16 game season, this is his stat line:  1586 yards rushing with 13.2 touchdowns.  265 yards receiving with 0.76 TD's.    Yes he'd have to double his receiving yards while also gaining a few more rushing yards than normal.  He'd have to play every game.  He'd also have to get a few extra receiving TD's.    None of that is out of the question.  But I do agree it is too high to be an ""expectation""."
minnesotavikings,3ccoy9,sand0789,2,Tue Jul 7 02:35:04 2015 UTC,"But how many of those years did we have a passing attack like we hopefully have this year?   A passing game can help the running game because we get the occasional new set of downs because of it, but at some point there's only one ball, and so much field.   Sort of akin to everyone pointing out what hum drum numbers Ponder had during Peterson's MVP run ""even though Peterson was taking all the pressure off him."" It's true some of the pressure, and certainly the focus, was off Ponder, but at the same time, the Vikings offense is only ""faced"" with x amount of field ahead of them, any yard Peterson gets on the ground is a yard Ponder can't get."
minnesotavikings,3ccoy9,vita10gy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:32:25 2015 UTC,"It's a tough thing to analyze ahead of time IMO.  Pass game helps the run game, but a run game supposedly helps the pass game.  If you have a balanced offense and a decent O-line, you're probably going to have a 1,000 yard back.  What separates guys like AD, is there ability to turn enough of those 3-yard runs into 80-yard runs, to get that production up to 1500+ yards."
minnesotavikings,3ccoy9,MN_hydroplane,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:44:09 2015 UTC,"Right, but on those 80 yard runs there's no remaining yards for Teddy, and on a 60 yard bomb to Wallace, there's no remaining yards for Peterson.   Peterson's yardage total has been greatly helped over the years by the fact that we house a big pass like 2 times a year compared to other teams' 2 times a game."

If Teddy puts up 300+ and a few scores then it'll be a Teddy Touchdowns kinda headline."
minnesotavikings,3ca6z2,Katbot22,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:42:02 2015 UTC,Nationally it will most likely be about the 49ers because they are the 'sexier' team market wise
minnesotavikings,3ca6z2,Katbot22,2,Mon Jul 6 20:37:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the 49ners would be lucky to not get swept by their division. They'd be really lucky to go 2-4 in their division IMHO. They'd then need to split the rest of their games just to get to 7-9 which doesn't seem too likely to me. My guess is 6-10 or worse. It sure feels like a win for the Vikes, thats for sure.

These threads always devolve into ""how exact are they"", except, on some level, who cares? I mean, sure, you don't want a giants blue jersey, or the numbers sewn on upside down, etc, but the people that ""side by side"" these, and analyze the purple dyes under a spectrometer to make sure they're the same thing, partially miss the point, IMO.  $20-$24 gets you almost nothing these days. Maybe a Tshirt? Even that might have to be on sale. So the real comparison should be what's better for sub $25: these things that are 97% indistinguishable from a $300 jersey from 3 feet away, or a tshirt with a ""Vikings"" on the front and nothing else?

minnesotavikings,3c85t5,rastapasta9,13,Sun Jul 5 20:19:09 2015 UTC,"Most successful: Teddy.  Most likely to bust:  This is a difficult question. Obviously, one of the late-round guys is most likely to be bad, so ""bust"" needs to be relative. Would it be considered a bust if TJ Clemmings doesn't do so well? Would it be considered a bust if Yankey doesn't? The most likely, I'd say, would be the players who are most raw or play positions where many bust. So, for that reason, I'd say Waynes and Hunter are most likely to bust. Waynes because he is a little raw plus is playing corner, which is very tough. Hunter because he's insanely raw."
minnesotavikings,3c85t5,ull90,6,Sun Jul 5 20:37:17 2015 UTC,"IMO, I don't consider anyone picked beyond the 3rd round to be a ""bust"".  You're lucky if you pick a contributor past the 3rd."

minnesotavikings,3c85t5,Tabemaju,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:20:33 2015 UTC,"I love Teddy, but let's not forget he is playing the most demanding position in the league. I really do not think you can name any QB ""most likely to succeed"" after only one season. A great example is RGIII, who people really thought would have a Hall of Fame career after his brilliant rookie season.  That said, I think Barr has the physical tools to remain a starter in this league. The knock on him was whether he would be mentally prepared to play standing up, and I think we saw enough of him last year to know that he will only get better in that department. He clearly has the instincts needed to excel.  I do not, however, like to predict whether someone will or will not be successful based on injury, which is the only thing I could see potentially derailing Barr (or anyone, for that matter).   Although I was hoping we would trade back and grab Peters, I don't want to make any sort of prediction on Waynes. We have a coach that knows a lot about CBs, and he clearly saw value in him as a top CB in the draft. From all reports, it sounds like he is very teachable and eager to learn, and he obviously has the physical tools to be very good.  I still worry that Patterson may not be salvageable. It was clear that in his second year he struggled with some very basic route concepts. These are things, in the second year, that he should only have improved on. I worry that he's a gimmick player and will never reach the potential we were all sure he had after his rookie season. If I had to pick a bust, he is the clear leader right now."
minnesotavikings,3c85t5,bluewing,0,Tue Jul 7 16:52:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone can call any of the picks made so far a bust. It will take at least one more year to even consider if any of last years picks are a ""bust""."
minnesotavikings,3c85t5,NicoSuave2020,6,Sun Jul 5 21:53:05 2015 UTC,That's probably why he asked which is most likely to be a bust and not which one is a bust.

So that leaves Waynes and Kendricks. I'll go with Kendricks since everyone seems to think Waynes will fail of all 4 picks.
minnesotavikings,3c85t5,vbullinger,0,Mon Jul 6 08:16:52 2015 UTC,"Teddy most likely to succeed, though his ceiling isn't as high as, say, Barr.  Bust? Well, is it fair to say someone like Crichton or Hunter? Third-rounders? Waynes, being picked at 11, should demand decent starter status in two years. If he doesn't do that? Then he's more of a bust then Crichton could ever be."

minnesotavikings,3c85vh,Staple_Overlord,12,Sun Jul 5 22:36:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Bradford being higher than Teddy is debateable. But Carr being higher than Bradford and Teddy is looney."
minnesotavikings,3c85vh,Shakerheight,-2,Sun Jul 5 23:14:50 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter, when you see that Derek Carr is ahead of him you know this list is a piece of shit. I also saw that Tom Brady was number one and then realized my dog's anus could have created a more accurate list than this."
minnesotavikings,3c85vh,fawkes9,8,Mon Jul 6 16:34:00 2015 UTC,"Meh, it is one guys opinion. I just hope that Teddy goes out there this year and proves that he should be higher on that list."

This is also why I have been very patient the last few years. They are building this very carefully. Rather than splurge on some over priced, over the hill, superstar. They did it through the draft. So we have a very young team with talent that still has room to improve, at all aspects of the game. We also have a coach, a coaching staff, that is strong. If Teddy develops into a good QB, look out."
minnesotavikings,3c7u0v,CypherLH,3,Sun Jul 5 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"Yep. I've bled purple since I was old enough to follow football, in the mid 80's. I can honestly say I haven't felt a vibe like this since before the 89' season when it felt like we had everything in place, or after drafting Moss before the 98' season, or after signing Favre before the 09' season.    We're gonna make a run over the next few years, and the window should be a long one since they've built this thing around the draft and young talent."
minnesotavikings,3c7u0v,1iI1iI1iI1iI,2,Mon Jul 6 08:39:47 2015 UTC,It all depends on Teddy. I liked what I saw as the season went on last year. The rest of the team can be phenomenal but if Teddy doesn't continue to progress then we'll be in trouble.

We only need a few more pieces that we need to address. Just because we have assets doesn't mean those assets will be able to do what they're expected to do at their full potential immediately. There's the gelling period. Off season is great, but on-field in-game chemistry is a huge plus that only develops as the season goes on. That will get carried into the next offseason and then we can build on that. The 2016 season will be a huge season for us. Don't expect a Lombardi this year."

It really doesn't say that much about the Vikings D.   Secondly, the NFC North may have the worse defensive division. I'd say the Vikes are bottom of the top 10 defenses and the only one from the NFC North sniffing top 20. And the packers D is absolutely laughable. So the point still stands that they are #1 in the division. Also getting younger and better in basically every category.   Fun year to be a vikes fan."
minnesotavikings,3c529t,fantasygod777,3,Sun Jul 5 15:13:22 2015 UTC,"He puts 40+ on any team who doesn't have a pass rush. Watch his games against the Lions and Bills. Rodgers is human and can be stopped as long as you have stellar line play. I think we have a good enough line to hang with anybody. Our strengths hit every weakness the Packers have (no run defense, sub par offensive line play) so I see no reason that the games won't be competitive this season."

minnesotavikings,3c529t,cusoman,2,Sun Jul 5 14:37:06 2015 UTC,"Specific to Vikings vs. Packers it should be a hell of a lot different now that we have Peterson back and Bridgewater starting. If you don't think the game will be a LOT more competitive than the Ponder catastrophe last year, then you're either a troll or lack a basic understanding of football. Lambeau isn't some mystical home field advantage, the Packers have just been consistently good the past 20+ years thanks to two HoF-caliber QBs, which usually leads to a great record at home."
minnesotavikings,3c529t,Xamen12,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:29:17 2015 UTC,They did that last year and still had the second best defense in the division. Most people see the Lions defense taking a step back with the loss of Suh.

minnesotavikings,3c9zxn,NUvikesfan,4,Mon Jul 6 09:51:17 2015 UTC,Jesus. Carr is a good QB. Teddy is a good QB. They both have their plusses and minuses. The arguments are irrelevant because whoever is holding the Lombardi trophy trumps everything else.
minnesotavikings,3c9zxn,rastapasta9,5,Mon Jul 6 15:51:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure where you get off saying Carr ""isn't very good"".  The debate over who is better Bridgewater or Carr is completely different from arguing one or both of them ""Isn't very good.""  Maybe they argue with that when you say that because it actually is baseless nonsense, as opposed to because they're blinded by their love for their all ready in the HOF QB. All signs point to Carr being, at the very least, a promising QB. Almost nothing points to him being bad.   You're making us all look bad, and you should feel bad."
minnesotavikings,3c9zxn,vita10gy,2,Mon Jul 6 16:28:16 2015 UTC,No more than we are. We didn't win a single game against winning opponents last year and we took Tampa Bay to OT. We proved very little.

minnesotavikings,3c4igy,UpperDecker30,16,Sat Jul 4 18:27:41 2015 UTC,We need all the depth we can get in the secondary. Hopefully he has a speedy recovery. Not sure how long it takes to recover from an injury like this.
minnesotavikings,3c4igy,ull90,9,Sat Jul 4 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's true anymore. He was decent last year but we didn't give Newman $2.5mil to sit on the bench, and we didn't draft Waynes 11th overall to do nothing all year long."
minnesotavikings,3c4igy,McRawffles,16,Sat Jul 4 20:14:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you can never have too many talented corners."
minnesotavikings,3c4igy,ull90,-2,Sat Jul 4 20:29:19 2015 UTC,"I never said it wasn't a good thing to have depth, I was just saying I don't think we need it. It'd be nice, but it's not the end of the world if he misses time.  I'd be more worried if this happened to McKinnon, or even Cole."
minnesotavikings,3c4igy,McRawffles,10,Sat Jul 4 20:30:26 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't we need it? Injuries happen all of the time, and cornerback depth has historically been a HUGE weakness for the Vikings. If Rhodes goes down, we are gonna be in a very bad spot at CB. Robinson isn't a great player but I'd rather have him healthy and playing than have to rely on Waynes who doesn't seem to be ready yet."
minnesotavikings,3c4igy,VikesRule,3,Sat Jul 4 21:12:24 2015 UTC,"I  know that's not what you said. I was just adding that. Didn't mean for it to come off that way. It's not going to break us, and I actually have a lot of confidence in Price, but I think it's generally a need to have good depth at corner. If you're too top heavy and one guy goes down, you're screwed. Even without injury, I could see a scenario where Newman shows his age and/or Waynes isn't ready and we need Robinson to play more (maybe not start, but play more). We saw what happened back in 2013, when we had to go through like 5 corners in one game. By the end, Sherels was playing. Blanton was playing in the slot at the end of the season. So, just in general, I think good depth is necessary in the secondary."
minnesotavikings,3c4igy,ull90,13,Sat Jul 4 20:50:32 2015 UTC,"Sucks for him. I felt like he was really starting to put it together last year. It was going to be an uphill battle for playing time this year anyway, and now he's really going to lose ground on these other young guys.  As far as the team goes, it's not a devastating loss. You never want to lose depth, but I don't think we'll need to make any major adjustments while he's out."
minnesotavikings,3c4igy,idiot382,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:25:58 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's gonna be tough for Robinson.  Zimmer really values durability and Robinson has earned the ""injury prone"" label."
minnesotavikings,3c4igy,whambamthankyoulamb,6,Mon Jul 6 17:41:07 2015 UTC,"He is the third prominent Vikings player to suffer a pectoral injury in the past year; offensive linemen Brandon Fusco and Phil Loadholt both wound up on injured reserve after tearing pectoral muscles last season, and defensive end Brian Robison was limited during most of the Vikings' spring program because of a pectoral injury he sustained during a workout in May.   Interesting and scary trend."
minnesotavikings,3c4igy,ElqruqpurplE,6,Sat Jul 4 23:51:51 2015 UTC,That is...any ideas what it could be? Overtraining maybe? Didn't Jet have a weight lifting inury too?
minnesotavikings,3c4igy,youvebeengreggd,4,Sun Jul 5 03:17:13 2015 UTC,"There's definitely reason to be concerned. I looked into this just a tiny bit when I wrote the update for VT. Quoted:   The rash of pectoral muscle tears could be random, or it could be a product of switching to free weights from machines—designed by strength and conditioning coach Marcus Evans to create more dynamic and explosive movements instead of isolating muscles, though it may increase injuries.  For what it’s worth, Miami had the 9th-best record when it comes to injuries when Evans was employed there as the S&C coach from 2008 to 2010. None of the players they had on injured reserve in that period were there because of pectoral injuries, as far as I can tell.  Either way, it’s something the Vikings have to look into. That doesn’t mean changing the strength and conditioning program entirely, but perhaps finding ways to reduce the incidence of injury.   Any workout bros know anything about this?"
minnesotavikings,3c4igy,ArifHasanDN,3,Sun Jul 5 06:37:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call myself a workout bro really, but I do some lifting and I have a good friend that is a trainer.  I tend to think it's more of a freak thing, and a lot of trainers recommend free weights because it isolates and builds better strength. But, I believe it puts more strain on the joints. That wouldn't explain the pec thing though.  Edit: I do the Pectoral Fly sometimes and it always pulls and puts a lot of pressure on my arms and pecs. I'd be curious if these injuries are happening during the pec fly:    A pectoral strain often occurs suddenly due to a high force going through the muscle and tendon beyond what it can withstand. This typically occurs during weight training especially when performing a bench press, chest press or pectoral flys (especially with free weights).     http://www.physioadvisor.com.au/14703550/pectoral-strain-torn-pectoral-physioadvisor.htm  Sample of pec fly: http://www.sportsinjuryclinic.net/rehabilitation-exercises/free-weights-exercises/pec-fly"

minnesotavikings,3c4igy,istasber,5,Sun Jul 5 03:52:16 2015 UTC,"Wonder how serious it is.  Maybe if it's serious, we can have our cake and eat it too, by putting him on IR and then letting him walk in FA next year. We get credit for compensatory picks AND get an extra roster spot.  On the other hand, he's probably one of the better CBs we have as a back-up on the outside, so I'm not really sure it's necessarily a good thing to lose him for the season... But if he was going to be at risk of getting cut anyhow, might as well turn him into a potential future pick."
minnesotavikings,3c4igy,EarnestQuestion,9,Sat Jul 4 18:44:35 2015 UTC,"If he's on IR the whole season he'll only get a small prove-it deal in FA, which would net us little to nothing pick-wise. Ideally he'll stay on the field and play well enough to get a modest deal somewhere"

minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,immortalis,2,Fri Jul 3 20:13:43 2015 UTC,What part of Texas are you moving to? Welcome!
minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,rastapasta9,2,Fri Jul 3 22:22:30 2015 UTC,Just outside of Southlake!   Gonna be crazy different from a small farm town in MN!
minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,immortalis,3,Fri Jul 3 22:34:42 2015 UTC,"Nice! I'm in Lubbock. Southlake is a really nice area, so I'm just going to assume you're rich. Which is awesome. The culture in Texas is different - it'll shock you at first but you'll grow to love it."
minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,rastapasta9,2,Fri Jul 3 22:37:06 2015 UTC,"Oh god no. Hahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahhaahahahahhaha.  I wasn't gonna post specifics but I'm not rich and it's not Southlake! Haha, it's prolly 15 min from Southlake!   Anti-rich; not opposed just poor."
minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,SkolVikingsLmao,2,Fri Jul 3 22:38:51 2015 UTC,Just don't become a fan of Baylor or TCU or Texas or Oklahoma or Oklahoma State or Texas A&M. So that leaves you with Texas Tech. Welcome aboard.

minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,noseonarugI7,2,Fri Jul 3 22:46:52 2015 UTC,lol yes and you'll soon realize that the college teams here are treated like the NFL teams in the north. huge collegiate athletics atmosphere here. You'll really enjoy it.
minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,youvebeengreggd,2,Fri Jul 3 22:47:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have a buddy down south and I guess it's just insane. Like HS football is even huge, it's almost incomprehensible coming from a town where we have won like 5 games in maybe 5 years."
minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,youvebeengreggd,2,Fri Jul 3 22:56:24 2015 UTC,"Haha understandable. I moved up to MN for high school and when we went to the state title i was shocked with how few people were there compared to Texas high school ball. But welcome, enjoy your stay, and catch some real college football games. TCU and Baylor will be a great one, among others. It'll be awesome not having a Minnesota winter!"

Oops.  Anyway, I could talk about a lot this week, but the only thing that matters is that I had a DTR with this girl and we decided neither of us are at a great spot to start a relationship, BUT we're just going to keep hanging out and see if we can't make something happen when we are ready. So that's neat."

minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,bainpr,3,Fri Jul 3 21:14:53 2015 UTC,So you guys are precommitted to dating each other?  Edit: that sounds flippant but I swear it's not. I'm just curious because it sounds like you are dating which is awesome.
minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,bainpr,2,Fri Jul 3 18:09:33 2015 UTC,"Sort of? I'm going to be moving back to the cities at the end of the summer so it's not the best of times to start something. Plus we both want our next relationship to be the last one, so rushing into something doesn't make any sense.  It's hard to explain, but yes, we're kind of going on dates but dot dating, per se. Best way I can think to say it is we're friends who have dibs on each other."
minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,meduses,3,Fri Jul 3 18:16:56 2015 UTC,"Hmm...sounds like a couple of people who may have been burned before and don't want to get burned again. I can relate to that.  When you say you're moving, how far away are you moving?"

Just from Duluth back to the cities. She's from the cities too and may or may not move back after she finishes school in the fall."
minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,Clamwizard,3,Fri Jul 3 18:42:49 2015 UTC,"So, precommited for the fall! I like it."

minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,meduses,3,Fri Jul 3 19:23:27 2015 UTC,"I had two girls on separate occasions who moved back to the cities. The first moved back over a summer to work with her parents security company and would guilt the shit out of me whenever I went out on Friday nights. Thinking I was going to bang every ass on the Arrowhead. That ended shortly thereafter. The second moved to uptown, me thinking we broke up, her thinking we didn't I fucked every ass at my work including getting with a man. Those were fucked up days. Long story short I miss the Arrowhead. Good luck."
minnesotavikings,3c0kbo,paddywacknack,2,Fri Jul 3 19:49:55 2015 UTC,That's quite the story! Hopefully we'll avoid such...shenanigans.

It may make the relationship very difficult,  just let what's gonna happen, happen."

And it's not expecting the relationship to go there, per se, just making it known that marriage is your end goal in a relationship at this point and if you're starting a relationship with someone, it's someone you can see yourself marrying."

minnesotavikings,3bzp1b,dougnn55,7,Fri Jul 3 15:20:01 2015 UTC,That was pretty terrible.  I'm not a huge rap/hiphop fan either but it usually meshes well with these videos.

minnesotavikings,3bzp1b,CelestialFury,7,Sat Jul 4 15:04:06 2015 UTC,"He's got a crazy good nose for the ball. Wasn't one of the knocks on him that he was too small for an NFL LB? I saw at least 4 plays where he took on dudes that easily had 50-60 lbs on him, and he won. So excited for the season to start already!"
minnesotavikings,3bzp1b,Moomaster48,7,Sat Jul 4 00:41:31 2015 UTC,"I always get worried when a defensive highlight tape is a bunch of big hits and athleticism plays. That kind of stuff doesn't translate into the NFL from college.  This is not one of those highlight tapes. He seems to be 2 steps ahead of everyone else on that defense. So unbelievably reactive. These plays aren't some athletic marvel, they're plays that don't need athletic talent. And that is exactly what I want in a linebacker. I know we're supposed to be taking highlight tapes with a grain of salt, but there's a reason this guy was the only one I felt was a must-have in the draft."
minnesotavikings,3bzp1b,drawingdead0,4,Sat Jul 4 01:55:56 2015 UTC,"We can have Myles Jack, too, please?"
minnesotavikings,3bzp1b,ull90,3,Sat Jul 4 17:01:56 2015 UTC,"Now those of you who didn't watch tape see why I'm super hyped for him. I watched his tape (amongst many others) and loved it. I thought he'd actually sneak into the top 20 picks because he looked so good, and was the best ILB in the draft by far.  No offense to Waynes, but I'm more confident that Kendricks will become a great player than him (not to say Waynes can't be great too, I also liked his tape a lot, but corners are a risky business)."
minnesotavikings,3bzp1b,McRawffles,2,Sat Jul 4 04:17:07 2015 UTC,I'm so excited to see him and Barr play together. I think Kendricks is going to be a beast for years to come.
minnesotavikings,3bzp1b,DrKoooolAid,2,Fri Jul 3 20:15:01 2015 UTC,Liked a lot of what I saw. By far his best traits seems to be between the ears. Excellent anticipation. He's really damn quick in space too. Looks to be an excellent coverage backer. He looked really good on a clean break or in space at run stopping. My only concern is that I didn't see any plays of him setting an edge or making plays once someone got their hands on him clean. If his ability to use his head and agility to make plays translates he'll be a fun player to watch. I will note that he makes up for his lack of size on tackles by getting really low and twisting. I'm really glad to see that. Too many guys try to hit high or arm tackle.

minnesotavikings,3byb2o,Stoods,2,Fri Jul 3 17:17:55 2015 UTC,I doubt it... they've let go the people integral to /r/IAmA and Reddit Gifts (/r/secretsanta). With the new search tool everyone hates and the new anti-harassment policy Reddit is getting much worse. I don't think the admins can do much to fix what they've done and there's a mass exodus to voat.co going on. It'll be interesting to see what the Admins decide to do before the year ends

When I can, I try to sit down and watch 7 hours of uninterrupted football on my Redzone subscription.  I use football as a means of relaxation and entertainment.  I like it for the fact that it is separate from the rest of the drama in the world (for the most part).  Rewind to last season, week 2.  Scott Hanson opens up Redzone with his familiar welcoming.  But then he acknowledges the drama occurring off the field (read: Adrian Peterson).  I was thinking ""please, I've heard enough, just give me football.""  And that's exactly what he did, saying ""These issues will be discussed at the appropriate time, by the appropriate media outlets, and that's not what we do here.  This show is about football, so let's get to it.""  (I'm paraphrasing).    I see the same sentiment being acknowledge now in the NFL subreddits.  And I think that should be applauded."

minnesotavikings,3byb2o,brunswick,26,Fri Jul 3 04:07:10 2015 UTC,"Eh, considering how expansive reddit is, I don't think you can just trivialize it by calling it a ""website"". Granted, that is the interface that people use to post their thoughts and discussions, but to many, it's a place to find news, discuss items of their lives, interact one-on-one with celebrities or people with unique experiences, find answers to scientific questions, or discuss your favorite NFL team.  It's not ESPN or CNN. It's a community driven website for users seeking community based content. Many people on here look at a subreddit the same as meeting a specific group of friends offline. Just because you don't share that sentiment, doesn't diminish their hurt from the admins actions."

minnesotavikings,3byb2o,McRawffles,5,Fri Jul 3 05:20:47 2015 UTC,"I think the big deal for many of these subreddits is how mods have felt treated by the admins. The mod tools are a decade out of date, and various AMA subreddits were really left out to dry by firing Veronica without any warning."
minnesotavikings,3byb2o,BarackSays,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:45:39 2015 UTC,"But here's what confuses me: the mod tools have been out of date for a while. The admins have been uncooperative for a while. What is sparking this protest is Victoria's firing, of which we know no details. For all we know, Victoria did something that warranted her being let go immediately, which would leave no time to set up backup plans. People keep saying this is the straw that broke the camel's back, but it's also possible this was an unavoidable series of events.  Also, I can't overstate this enough, there is no such thing as a warning for an employee being fired. Especially a warning for lower level employees. This is not her taking her two weeks notice or retiring. You don't tell people's coworkers you're about to fire them. There's too much that can go wrong, and there's a reason it's never done that way. If the mod's think they're entitled to a heads up that an employee is being fired, they need to take a step back and think about the situation more rationally."
minnesotavikings,3byb2o,joey_sandwich277,3,Fri Jul 3 15:49:33 2015 UTC,"It's not just that. This is a storm that's been brewing for a while. I'm just going to summarize some of what I know.   Reddit management has been mostly ignoring a large number of mods, including mods of defaults, for months. FPH happened, Reddit management did nothing but fan the flames caused by that situation by shadowbanning a number of people. They didn't help the mods at all with the situation. New reddit search got rolled out sitewide yesterday. A lot of mods use the old search tool to moderate. Many had asked for the old search to be kept and usable somewhere, but to no avail (it's been in beta for months). Finally, Victoria is let go with no warning, no explanation. Victoria was in the middle of organizing AMAs for several subreddits--poof, those are all gone. IAMA gets royally fucked, so they shut down (the vast majority of their content for a day is pretty much gone in an instant). She was well known and well respected. IAMA finds out that she's been canned by the agent of someone scheduled to do an AMA with her help today, not from Reddit management.  To top it off, kn0thing, who is supposedly in charge of dealing with the situation, has done nothing but act like an asshole in nearly every response he's posted in the last day.    TL;DR: Reddit management has been fucking mods for months on end, this was the last straw.   Unless Victoria royally fucked up there was no reason for her to be instantly let go. If they wanted to lay her off they should've at least given a week or two week transitional period.  Now this can go one of two ways:    Reddit reconciles with the mods, promises to listen more in the future, actually develops a working relationship with them outside of Victoria. Reddit overthrows the mods, in the process killing itself as everyone moves to some other website.    I'm somewhat worried about #2 actually, partially because of Reddit management's questionable decision making the last couple years, and partially because they just hired the former Digg community manager who was, at the very least, partially responsible for the death of Digg.   Edit: A bestof mod actually explained it way better than I could"
minnesotavikings,3byb2o,McRawffles,2,Fri Jul 3 05:45:51 2015 UTC,There was absolutely nothing wrong with the admins banning FPH. That was an extremely toxic sub that actually did prey and harass on individual users.
minnesotavikings,3byb2o,swampsparrow,2,Fri Jul 3 14:28:26 2015 UTC,I agree 100%. The way they handled the FPH situation after the ban was not the best though.

minnesotavikings,3byb2o,SirDiego,2,Fri Jul 3 18:50:21 2015 UTC,"Finally, Victoria is let go with no warning, no explanation.   As things are almost always done when employees are fired. Don't get me wrong, the complaints about lack of communication, outdated mod tools, and lack of cooperation after Victoria's firing sound valid. But as a business, you never tell a person's coworkers (apart from possibly their supervisors) that they are being fired first."
minnesotavikings,3byb2o,mwharp,2,Fri Jul 3 15:56:07 2015 UTC,No one is overthrowing the mods in this sub. Period.
minnesotavikings,3byb2o,NostradamAssHat,2,Fri Jul 3 16:59:19 2015 UTC,"Oh they wouldn't do that for this sub, just the defaults that closed down. As I said that would single-handedly kill Reddit though. Everyone would leave if that happened.  And the admins have had that power all along. They can remove mods, ban them, and replace them. They've done it in the past in exceptional circumstances."

How many times do we see stuff on Reddit in general, be it news or funny things or videos, only to see them on the actual news the next day? This is a great place to come learn things, talk to celebrities, laugh, and review our own opinions against thousands of other people. There have been strong opinions that I've had on subjects that I eventually learned weren't actually based on fact. That's why I come here. To expand my knowledge and grow as a person. Yes, there's various cesspools of rotten humanity sprinkled throughout Reddit, but sometimes that's your own fault for subscribing to that subreddit. There are plenty of places to go here that help people get through their day. That help people that are suicidal get their life back on track. That help people that have a stigma of some sort find other people with similar issues. It's easy to say it's just a website. It's harder to admit that this is a great place to come to relax or learn. I've only been on Reddit for a couple of years, but there's WAY more good things that have come from this place than bad."

So here ya are:   The Vikings have the most division titles in the NFCN at 18. The Pack are getting close but I just counter that by taking a shot of purple Kool Aid and explaining that the Pack won't be a lock to win starting this season.   -The Vikings have the 3rd most playoff appearances in the entire league, so while they haven't capped it off with a Super Bowl victory, they are consistently sucessful.  -Point to the 70s and 80s Packers and just how god awful they were until 2 HOF QBs fell into their lap.  -Head to head in the playoffs, the Vikes and Pack are tied 1-1, their one victory being against Joe Webb... slow clap  -The Vikes have had a metric shit ton of really notable players that are deeply famous and still household names. Moss, Carter, Purple People Eaters, Adrian, etc. Included in that is a very substantial Canton presence.  -Our fans have dealt with all this shit, yet still remain loyal to the team.

minnesotavikings,3bx1k6,goldenboots,13,Thu Jul 2 21:20:17 2015 UTC,Randy Moss evolved the game.
minnesotavikings,3bx1k6,FlashGorden,15,Thu Jul 2 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"This chart illustrates why Rice's record will be difficult to break for some time. Moss was ahead of Rice's pace at 35 years old, and yet Jerry still played another 7 seasons after that and grabbed another 40ish TD's. That's ridiculous longevity."
minnesotavikings,3bx1k6,joey_sandwich277,2,Fri Jul 3 00:24:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Moss was his own worst enemy, he immaturity on and off the field is really the only thing that stopped him from surpassing Rice.  And because of that I'd still take Chris Carter over Randy Moss in their prime."

It was really sad and disgusting. The dad got security involved and got him removed. Never been to a Vikings game since I live in CA and do not want to get this kind of attention as the away team fan. I really enjoy watching games at home so I can yell at the tv, do idiotic victory dances, and basically go full retard. But one day I'll make the pilgrimage to the new stadium and go full retard with you guys."

minnesotavikings,3byr7i,__JeRM,5,Sat Jul 4 21:04:59 2015 UTC,"I went to the game in detroit after the dome collapsed, and Ford Field was quite disappointing. The sound in there just dies as soon as it leaves your mouth. It was the quitest game I had ever been to, granted half the people were just there because they got in free if they went to the lions game the night before, but even their noise was barely heard."
minnesotavikings,3byr7i,Bling_Gordan,5,Fri Jul 3 13:50:55 2015 UTC,"I was at the preseason game vs. the Raiders when tons of people booed Ponder when he came out in the third, maybe fourth, quarter. I was pissed. First, it's the preseason. Second, it's the fourth quarter. Third, Ponder is already the third string QB. Fourth, Ponder played hard for this team. He got injured diving for a touchdown because he wasn't some weak QB who was scared to get hurt. He tried hard to be better. Sometimes, it just doesn't work out.   Another time, I was watching the Twins play the Blue Jays a long time ago. This girl, who was a fan of the Blue Jays, sitting a couple rows up from us was yelling and screaming for the Blue Jays the entire game. Like, really yelling and screaming. Fucking annoying when you're at a baseball game and things will often be quiet."
minnesotavikings,3byr7i,ull90,3,Fri Jul 3 14:35:08 2015 UTC,"Was in SoCal for training a few (several)years ago, and rented a car & drove down to SD. I caught the opener- Vikes @ Chargers ( Percy ran back opening kickoff!), McNabb started, I was pumped wearing my AD jersey. Drank in the parking lot, seemed like there was more Purple than blue, everyone around me had some ties to Minny, very friendly & festive. Inside, the concourse was narrow, lines for concessions crossed the normal 'walk area' - not good flow, got nowhere fast, LOTS of fights in the stands. I'm trying to find men's room, guy in front of me stops dead in his tracks, face to face with a huge killer dude, no shirt on, tattoos everywhere (prison/homemade?), Killer says how much he hates all the Vikings fans & purple jerseys - just like challenging all of us (like 10 Vikes fans) around him, we're all like 'come on, enjoy the game..' I seriously thought about taking off the #28 after that.  Back to my nosebleed seats, had another beer & watched McFlubb throw passes in the dirt.  Overall; great weather is the best thing I can say about that game! Stadium sucked, concessions sucked, fights sucked, traffic sucked, I loved it!"
minnesotavikings,3byr7i,Aero98,3,Fri Jul 3 13:54:43 2015 UTC,Went to the Rams game last year. They played shake it off after we trounced them. Pretty good experience overall I'd say.
minnesotavikings,3byr7i,MightySasquatch,3,Fri Jul 3 14:00:09 2015 UTC,"So I go to school in Indiana, so I've been to Indy and Cincinatti (and also Green Bay when I was still in high school).  Cincy was the best. We got BTFO, I think it was 14-42. But I was there with my roommate (who's from Cincy), and everyone there was really funny and awesome. The only time we felt mocked was when we were waiting for my roommate's mom to pick us up, and this guy in the passenger seat of a truck while driving by just pointed and gave one solid ""HAH."" And it made us laugh pretty hard. Plus, on the stairwell down after the game, we got stopped by another guy dressed in solid Viking gear like us, and he got his Bengal buddy to take a picture of us. He told us how the Vikings are never in Cincy and no Vikings fans were around there, so he was happy to finally meet a few. Best game.  Surprisingly, Green Bay comes in next. Outside of the stadium, we were treated very poorly and kind of got scoffed at, but inside the stadium we talked with the people around us (all Packer fans, maybe one other Vikings group in our section). All were very nice and talked about how they got their tickets and afterward that it was very nice meeting us (as we reciprocated with them). They even told us how if they keep depending on Aaron Rodgers that they're never gonna go back to the Super Bowl, and they need a running back if they wanna do that. Then we left the stadium, and proceeded to get treated like dirt again. I saw a Packer fan drop their mitten and I picked it up for her and gave it to her and she said ""F*** you."" .......... k. She looked like she had eaten too much cheese anyway.  Lastly and leastly, Indianapolis. If I were to meet every male porn star in the history of earth while they were all naked, I still would not meet as many dicks as I would when I went to Indianapolis. I went with another Colts fan, which I thought would make it ok. HE had a hot dog thrown at him because he was with me. It was ridiculous. I didn't feel threatened at Green Bay, but I was afraid that I was going to get hurt in Indy.  Again, all these could be anomalies, but they're just what I've experienced."
minnesotavikings,3byr7i,canigetawoop_woop,3,Sat Jul 4 06:20:40 2015 UTC,"No comment on stadium, but I went to a Colts/Panthers game in Charlotte when Manning was still in Indy.   Saw a married couple get into it pretty badly, she then smacked the husband in the face SUPER hard, and stormed out.   I felt bad for the guy just sitting there embarrassed with a red face."
minnesotavikings,3byr7i,__JeRM,2,Sat Jul 4 21:08:16 2015 UTC,"I've only ever been to games at Solider field, soooooo soldier field. Seriously, they can be huge dicks.

minnesotavikings,3bwooo,Mariox,4,Thu Jul 2 23:41:10 2015 UTC,I'm thinking it's because the color coding is similar to a rainbow. Makes perfect sense to me.
minnesotavikings,3bwooo,Ben_Eide,3,Fri Jul 3 00:09:11 2015 UTC,"Good going. A small suggestion: position groups by color and hue. If you put darker colors as guys who start the play near the ball and lighter if they generally start the play farther away from the ball. This way as you are watching you can have a better understanding of where to look on replays and how the game is flowing. I can help too with the color scheme, for example:  C stands for center on the offensive line. Make them dark red  OG is for guard, they play just outside the center. Make them a lighter red  OT is for Tackle. The play outside of the guard. Make them light red  OL is for Offensive line. These players will be Offensive Guards or Tackles, but the team hasn't decided where yet. Any red will do   because I am on a phone this is cumbersome to write, so if you like this idea let us know and we can help telling you who to group together"
minnesotavikings,3bwooo,phoneusername,2,Fri Jul 3 12:07:20 2015 UTC,I think as long as you know the big name players. If you watch the games youll pick up on most everyone else quick.

Your defense of her in the face of encouraging and constructive comments is called ""white knighting"". You valiant defense of m'lady has all been in vain.  You last two sentences are correct. However the rest is trash. Is it really ""amazing"" that she is gonna try and like the Vikings? Is she really an ""awesome"" gf because she printed out a roster? It's a nice gesture. My favorite part was the declaration that this sub must be ""jealous"" of this mysterious magical girl unicorn potential football fan. Oh man.  If you don't see my point, that is okay, it doesn't matter. I kinda want to explain the Internet rule, ""there are no girls on the Internet "" but I feel you would misunderstand and take it literally because I explain things poorly.

Maybe you've never had a gf that hated football, but I've had quite a few and it would have been amazing if one of them had taken the time to attempt to relate to something which I hold so dear. The jealous comment was clearly tongue in cheek because I didn't understand why people were being negative when she was coming here looking for support and suggestions.

Just spend time with him watching the games and do your best to enjoy them. The names will come eventually.  Are you expecting him to be like, ""Hell yea, Xavier Rhodes with the pick 6"", and you can respond with, ""Oh yea, Rhodes, CB. He's 6-1, 218 and only 25 yrs old. Oh yea, and did i mention he went to Florida State?""   Again, not trying to sound like an ass but I just don't understand how this helps much.  Also - C (center), G (gaurd), and OL (O-Line) should probably all be kept together. And I agree with what several others have said. Depth Chart would be better.

I see a lot of similarities between Teddy and Tannehill. I worry that Norv could be doing what he did in San Diego...forcing his system to work even if he doesn't have the personnel to do it."
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,JesperIsHere,5,Thu Jul 2 16:49:40 2015 UTC,Teddy has a way better deep ball than tannenhill.
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,MNProtest,2,Fri Jul 3 00:11:01 2015 UTC,Which could still mean Teddy has a poor deep ball.

minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,ThreeDeep1998,5,Thu Jul 2 16:07:05 2015 UTC,"Nice list, Greenway I don't think would be a surprise. Fusco on the left side, maybe? Or, if we're going for a big surprise, Peterson. I can't believe I said that. I take it back."
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,jack_slim,3,Thu Jul 2 14:40:51 2015 UTC,How do you think Waynes will be a letdown?  I suppose if one's expectation is that he'll be an effective full time starter or all pro that would be a let down. But that jusy wouldn't be a sensible expectation to have for a rookie.
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,youvebeengreggd,5,Thu Jul 2 14:51:27 2015 UTC,He could have a let down even for a rookie's standard. I don't think he will but I needed a 5th person.
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,schwertfeger,5,Thu Jul 2 14:58:19 2015 UTC,"Hmm, in that case I think I'd replace him with Kalil.  If Kalil doesn't imorove or continues to regress that would be an enormous hit for the team."
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,youvebeengreggd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:02:37 2015 UTC,"to be fair, Cap Munnerlyn had kind of a crap season last year. So it really wouldnt be a surprise. Point made regardless, im skeptical."
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,kayeat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:11:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know that many of those would be surprises, though. Rudolph has consistently underwhelmed, Munnerlyn wasn't very good, Greenway has lost a step, Wanyes is a rookie, and Walsh took a step back last year, too.  I'd say Bridgewater, Peterson, Rhodes, Barr, and Floyd are all players that could potentially regress, but would qualify as a surprise if they do.  edit: Charles Johnson and Mike Wallace are good candidates, too, I think."
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,jjspaceman,3,Thu Jul 2 18:57:43 2015 UTC,"AD - He is starting to get up there in age and our expectations are him to exceed his average season superhuman abilities.  He might still be around 1000 yards yet disappoint us.  Bridgewater - Based on how he finished last year, our expectation levels are to continue or improve from there.  He looked good but we still struggled to beat Chicago during that stretch.  I expect him to be a middle of the pack QB which may be a let down if turnovers go up (fumbles for example last year will likely get worse).  Barr - Again, another guy last year who showed great potential which has raised expectations.  Injuries slowed him down last year and during this years OTAs.  He could continue to struggle with them which would either keep him out or hurt his level of play.  Wallace - If we struggle early and Teddy has issues with long passes that Wallace thrived on in Pittsburgh, he might get discouraged/disinterested and never play at his former level.  We really are hoping for a lot here, but it doesn't always work out with free agents/trades.  Norv Turner - Not a player, but he might not be as flexible with our play calling as needed.  After AD went down last year, the game plan on the offensive side was pretty bland.  We have a lot of exciting players, but if they are not used to their strengths, we are set up for disappointment."
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,cromulu5,5,Thu Jul 2 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: these aren't players I think will experience a letdown season, but rather players that I think plausibly could.  Peterson - I know that we all love the ""AD is a cyborg"" narrative, but he is getting older, and who knows how almost a year away from football will affect him. Also, given the levels of hype around here, I'd say that a 1,000 yard season could be considered a letdown to some.  Rudolph - every year it seems we play the ""if he stays healthy game."" While I have full confidence in his abilities when healthy, I don't have full confidence in his ability to stay healthy.  Johnson - was essentially a rookie last year. Could pull a Patterson and drop off in his second year.  Robison - what if he has less left in the tank than we thought?  Walsh - kickers are unpredictable. I'm thinking last year was just a down year more than a trend, but if it is a trend, we might be in trouble."
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,coveredinbeeees,7,Thu Jul 2 15:20:48 2015 UTC,"Bridgewater - he's not going to be bad, but the expectations for him from Viking fans are WAY too high. He's going to be mediocre/average. He's still young and learning. He's not going to throw for 4,000 yards and 30 touchdowns in his second season with a bad offensive line, IMO. Greenway - he's aging and has definitely lost a step. With our younger and more athletic linebackers that have been drafted he's going to look even worse by comparison. Waynes - he doesn't seem ready to handle starting and I think he's got a ways to go in developing before he's ready to contribute. I don't think he's going to see the field much this year unless we have injuries. Peterson - he's not going to light it up this year like many expect in my opinion. I still predict 1200-1400 yards but I could see him barely eclipse 1000 depending on how the season goes. So I think he'll have a letdown season compared to those who think he'll approach anywhere near 2000 rushing yards. Wallace - Bridgewater's deep ball is still a big weakness even though he improved throughout the season last year. I think Wallace is going to get frustrated in the same way he did with Tannehill in Miami."
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,VikesRule,3,Thu Jul 2 16:43:47 2015 UTC,"He's not going to throw for 4,000 yards and 30 touchdowns in his second season with a bad offensive line, IMO.   First, what makes you think our line will be bad? Our line was bad last year due to injuries, but Sullivan, Loadholt and Fusco are all great lineman and Kalil still can play at a high level.   Second, 4000 yards IS attainable for him in the modern NFL."
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,Dorkamundo,-3,Thu Jul 2 22:21:15 2015 UTC,"Kalil is terrible, Loadhold is average, Fusco is coming off an injury, we have nobody at RG. Sullivan is great and Fusco should hopefully return to form, but that's 2 solid players, 1 average player, one terrible player, and one question mark. That's a bad offensive line, IMO.  4000 yards is attainable but I don't think he will achieve it this year."
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,VikesRule,3,Thu Jul 2 22:24:48 2015 UTC,I'm not ready to give up on Kalil. I don't expect him to be a huge liability like he was early last year. He was playing a lot better (still not great) at the end of the year. He could turn into a decent player. I still think loadholt is definitely above average. He's good on run blocking and fine in pass blocking. Wasnt he injured last year too?
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,grrrimabear,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:23:13 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% about Wallace. I think he and Teddy are both talented, but may not be a good match...just like Miami had."

minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,Dorkamundo,2,Thu Jul 2 22:19:26 2015 UTC,Barr. If he can't stay healthy.
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,bahamut458,2,Thu Jul 2 15:37:16 2015 UTC,"Two things.  First, I'm assuming all players in my list are injury free.  Second, I am not necessarily saying that I believe these players WILL have letdowns.  Adrian Peterson - This is more about his history and how the Vikings might utilize him.  If McKinnon gets a decent share of plays, and Asiata eats up those goal line carries, I could envision Peterson having less than 10 TD's and around 1000-1200 yards.  Even if he has great YPC, it could still be seen as a letdown.  Charles Johnson - Let's not forget that this dude has 2 TD's and 500 yards in his career.  Many people point to him as our #1, or for sure #2 WR.  That may be the case today, but basically our expectations at this point are for him to far surpass anything he's ever done.    Teddy Bridgewater - Similar to Charles Johnson.  I'm super high on Teddy.  But let's not forget that he's a 2nd year QB with potentially a below average receiving corps and bottom 5 pass blocking unit.  Yet we are almost expecting him to be firmly a top ten QB.    Anthony Barr - I think he's got great points to his game, and the athleticism is sick.  But he did miss a lot of tackles last year and hasn't yet learned coverage.  He'll have splash plays.  That's a certainty.  But if he fails to clean up a lot of those ""little things"", he could be actually giving a lot up on plays.  Trey Waynes - This depends on people's expectations, obviously.  But a lot of folks are drinking the kool-aid that this is a corner who gets it.  Zimmer fueled this fire by saying Waynes picks up technique as fast as any player he's ever had.  As a general rule, rookie corners suck.  Even the ones who go on to be perennial pro bowlers.  To me, a solid season for Waynes would be holding down a starting job while playing mediocre and having no picks.  Most people would say ""wha...bust!"".  I'm just being realistic.  A bad season would be him playing a minimal role and getting absolutely targeted whenever in there, imo.  So this is all about expectations."
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,sand0789,2,Thu Jul 2 19:30:20 2015 UTC,"Players will always have up and down seasons. As long as there is the chance of redemption or improvement (or even a predicted decline in the older players) in the next season then there isn’t ever a true letdown. There is always hope for the future and we’ll drink the purple koolaid.  For me, a letdown only occurs when it’s clear there is little to no hope left. The train has run out of track. In recent years, it happened to Ponder (“He isn’t a franchise QB”) and Troy Richardson (“He just can’t catch”) for us. Trent Richardson is another great example of a player who has hit the letdown point.  Peterson, Bridgewater, Griffin, Waynes, Barr, Johnson, Kendricks etc. could all underperform this season and they wouldn’t be letdowns. They’d just be disappointments. Greenway, Robison and Loadholt could decline and they’d just be disappointments. Even Wallace would just be a disappointment because we haven’t got emotionally invested in him over several seasons.  The potential letdowns for me are the guys in the last chance saloon where it’s make or break and we’ve been eager for them to come good for several seasons: Kalil, Patterson and Rudolph. This isn’t to say that they’ll be cut after the season. It’s just that the hope will be gone.  Kalil is the biggest possible letdown because he has to prove he has three qualities (Resilience, attitude and ability). He could fail if any of those three let him down. I don’t think the odds are in his favour.  Patterson has to prove he can run routes and perform as a primary threat. If he doesn’t show it this season then I have little hope he’ll ever come good for us.  Rudolph has to prove that he can stay healthy. Another season cut short and I doubt he’ll ever be able to achieve his true potential."

minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,guitarhunterdude,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:03:16 2015 UTC,"I think Wallace tops the list, but it won't be his fault. Vikes fans may be dreaming big of him being this spectacular downfield threat, scoring 10+ TDs, 1,200+ yards. In reality, I think he will do a great job of stretching the defense but won't crack 1,000 yards. He will do great in his role but not be as dynamic as he was back in the Steeler years IMO.    I'd put Rudolph and Griffen on that list too just because I think expectations for each of them may be higher than they should be. Griffen will be solid but not outstanding, Rudolph just isn't as good as we like to think he is."
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,GLineSportsWORDPRESS,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:24:08 2015 UTC,"Must...counter...the...kool-aid....  Alright, my picks:  Kalil - Heard he's more confident and feeling better after his off-season surgeries...let's hope that translates, but there's a chance it won't and we're left with big problems on the left side.  Then again...Fusco over there could be the answer.   Blanton - He did lead the team in tackles last year, but I heard a lot of talk about Exum at OTA's and now that we're more firm at CB and MLB there may be less used in ours schemes this year.  Greenway - I expect Hodges to take his spot this year, and for the slide to continue. Great locker room presence though.   Patterson - I'm just not a believer of Patterson.  He's proven to be a little...slow (off the field...you know what I mean)...and I hate saying that.  The guy needs a strong mentor (apparently he has one), but I'm not sure if that's a long term answer.  In my opinion, those that excel in the NFL seek to do so on their own...  Also, we have upgraded with Wallace and I think Diggs will be in the mix at the slot.   Rudolph - I've never been a fan of his contract extension. I've always felt he had more to prove, personally.  As everyone else has stated, injuries are a constant issue with this guy and until I see a healthy season I'm not sold.   For all the Waynes votes...I don't see a letdown season in his future.  Zimmer being the CB whisperer and all I think he'll be coached up quickly. I DON'T expect him to start until after the bye, but even if he's a rotational player at that point, I wouldn't consider that a down year.  CB is a tough position and many rookies never start."

Teddy, defenses could figure him out.  Rhodes, QB's could figure him out, while he also takes a step backwards in his development  Fusco, coming back from injury, he could be weaker.  Griffen, LT, LG and TE could figure out his move set.  This is probably a worst case scenario for the Vikings."
minnesotavikings,3bvi2c,DarkMuret,5,Thu Jul 2 15:05:13 2015 UTC,"Considering you essentially chose our best players (and most consistent in Fusco and Smith), I would say that is definitely the worst case scenario"

Kalil - the surgery may not help as much as we're hoping.  Kendricks - unfairly over-hyped, even more than Waynes.

Picked 29th overall, signs 5 year $5.3mil contract.  Walks out after the first practice and didn't return. Claims football got in the way of his faith. Gets released.  After 23 teams pass, Miami picks him up for $400k. He injures his shoulder on the first preseason game. Meanwhile the front office takes note of his lack of focus.  Arrested for not paying child and tries to kill himself within 24 hours of his arrest. His mother claims it's because of a church that he was attending that influenced him. She later redacted her claims.  After he escaped from a psychiatric facility, Miami finally releases him. Dallas gives him a chance and a two year contract. He had 21 tackles and four sacks as a reserve DT.  Less than a year after signing with Dallas he tries to kill himself again by running into traffic. Dallas released him after missing practices.  Did time for aggravated robbery, assault on public servant, and evading arrest.  In 2005, after being 4 years removed from football, he resurfaced in the CFL but is cut in less than a month.

But he didn't. He was finding open people left and right. Knowing where guys were, progressions, finding them, etc, was fine. He found someone on virtually every play....he just couldn't hit them.  +I didn't think Ponder was a secret superstar with some proper coaching or anything, and still think he's a capable backup, but Josh's performance made it clear it wasn't a supporting cast issue, maybe not even the playbook, or anything like that.

minnesotavikings,3buoyu,Skogrheim,3,Thu Jul 2 19:01:33 2015 UTC,"I worked in group sales at a hotel last year in Omaha. We housed all the visiting teams for the FXFL. The Boston team stayed with us for about 2 weeks for training before the season started (I still don't know why they had training in Omaha), so we got to know the staff really well. Their head coach was Terry Shea.He has worked one on one with several NFL QBS in his training institute.   The day the team arrived my boss at the time (Director of Sales) was talking to Coach Shea in our office, asking him where he has coached before and what QBs he has worked with. He mentioned he had worked with  Robert Griffin III, Blaine Gabbert, Sam Bradford, Matthew Stafford, and Josh Freeman. When he said that I said ""Ah Josh Freeman, he kinda played for my team for a hot minute."" Coach Shea asked who that was and when I said the Vikings, he said ""Oh yes."" I told him that I and some other Viking fans found that situation really strange and I always thought that the way it played out was weird. It was like the coaching staff wanted him to fail. The play calling that game was so absurd (why in the hell did they keep calling passing plays), and I never understood why they only gave him one chance to play and that was only when he had less than 2 weeks to work with his recievers. Especially after our season went downhill and it was clear that Ponder wasn't going to be the solution. I didn't understand why they didn't try to put him in even later, once we were out of post season contention. I just didn't get why we spent money on someone, set them up to fail, and then never gave them another shot. After I told Coach Shea my opinion he kinda chuckled and said ""You are very intuitive. You should hear Josh's side of things, because their was certainly more to the story and more things happening behind the curtain that the public did not know.""   He didn't tell me anymore information, but I will say that he is a wonderful man (he even sent me a Christmas card last year), very kind, and I don't think he'd have a reason to make that up. He was also very close to Josh Freeman as Josh showed up in Omaha on the sidelines for the 2nd Omaha-Boston game."

minnesotavikings,3buoyu,supernaut32,4,Thu Jul 2 09:57:48 2015 UTC,Ramos McDonald CB. So Denny drafts this dude in the 3rd round. Doesn't play much year one. Year two he's the starting CB out of camp. Starts the first 5 games. He's so damn awful Denny freaks out and trades him to SF after the 5th game. He's legit one the worst players I've seen. Just another dumb defensive draft pick by Denny.   Dude played out the year in SF then was trade to the Giants. Played a couple games the next year. Out of the league after year 3.

minnesotavikings,3butdm,kertusc,5,Thu Jul 2 09:32:47 2015 UTC,Teddy Munnerlyn.   I really think he can go from a liability to a contributor with his second season under Zimmer. I think he got a big head from his contract and freelanced too much. Ellison.   Two TE sets are going to have a lot of LB focused on Rudolph and allow Ellison to have a much bigger year than we expect Rhodes.  Makes the leap to elite Joseph.  Gets back his 2 gap monster mojo back

minnesotavikings,3butdm,guitarhunterdude,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:15:36 2015 UTC,"i truly hope Ruddy comes through in a big way. This offense is looking like it can beat you with so many different looks!  4 promising TE's, a WR group that could be the perfect storm, and of course Peterson supplemented with McKinnon for some thunder n lightning. And Teddy was never the kind of guy to rely heavily on the run game."
minnesotavikings,3butdm,EarnestQuestion,2,Thu Jul 2 19:12:29 2015 UTC,"Kendricks-Immediate starter.  I'm hoping he does for us what Mosley did for the Ravens last year.  Johnson- Has all the measureables to be awesome.  If he can improve on contested balls (and that needs to improve A LOT), he could be borderline #1 material.  Teddy- I'm expecting a fairly pedestrian 3200-yard, 20-TD, 14/15-INT year, but if he shows growth as quickly as he did at Louisville he could be pushing 3800/25/16.  Floyd- Had a bit of a breakout last year, but I think this year he could cement his name as a premier 3-tech (which he played like for five or six games last year).  Rhodes- Similar to Floyd, had a stretch of elite play last year but was mostly just ""very good.""  Could be elite after this year if he keeps progressing and is able to find a bit more consistency (and be better against the run)."
minnesotavikings,3butdm,agnostic_penguin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:51:36 2015 UTC,If Rhodes and Floyd make the leap to elite its gonna be rough sailing for QBs. And i got similar expectations for Kendricks.
minnesotavikings,3butdm,WhirledWorld,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:15:32 2015 UTC,"3800 isn't much of a stretch for Teddy. The coaches have been clear about their intention to lighten Peterson's rushing load and give him more work as a receiver, and Teddy's productivity last year already projects out to 3800 over 16 games.  I think they're serious about building the offense around Bridgewater and they'll optimize the offense for his effectiveness"
minnesotavikings,3butdm,EarnestQuestion,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:04:56 2015 UTC,"This is a really similar list to the one I was thinking of writing up. The only difference of opinion is that with AP back, I think the Vikings won't rely on Teddy as much. And I also think Teddy's accuracy will come back to Louisville form. So I'm thinking it's possible he could get closer to 3200 yards, 25 TD, 10 INT. Closer to a Russel Wilson level of production and efficiency."
minnesotavikings,3butdm,GhengisKongg,2,Thu Jul 2 22:53:40 2015 UTC,"Kendricks -- Dark horse DRoY, compares favorably to Bobby Wagner but worse tackler, better in coverage.  Will start game 1, will have double-digit pass deflections. Anthony Barr -- Sky's the ceiling for Barr, who has the speed of a wide receiver and the size of a defensive end.  Double digit sacks, top ten 4-3 OLB. Teddy -- Teddy's all about improvement -- all he does is train, and if you look at his college number or even over this past season, it's very clear he got better and better.  He'll be top ten in the league for INT% and Y/A. Charles Johnson -- Will continue to show chemistry with Teddy and have 10+ TDs.   That's all I got.  I think Shariff Floyd and Xavier Rhodes will win back up pro bowl spots, but they're already ""broken out"" to me."
minnesotavikings,3btpi3,jembachidu,20,Thu Jul 2 01:51:24 2015 UTC,"If you stay downtown, you will not need a car. You can take the light rail from the airport to downtown, and once you're there you'll be able to walk or take the bus to anything you want to do.  On gameday, the light rail goes pretty much straight from downtown to TCF stadium. It would just be an unnecessary hassle to deal with a rental car, I think.  There's definitely some nighttime activity downtown on the weekends, especially if you're into bars and clubs. Most of it is on Hennepin and 1st Ave. I don't know where you're from; don't expect it to be like L.A. or anything, but if your goal is to go dancing or barhopping you'll be fine downtown, at least on a Friday or Saturday night."

minnesotavikings,3btpi3,1niquity,9,Thu Jul 2 14:01:06 2015 UTC,"What kind of bar/nightlife scene are you into? If you are fans of craft beer we have a lot of top-notch breweries in the area. Nordeast Minneapolis is home to a good concentration of them that are close to each other (Dangerous Man, Indeed, Bauhaus, Sociable Cider Werks and others) and it would be a real quick Uber ride from downtown Minneapolis proper (which also has some other great breweries). I could talk breweries all day - so if it is something you are actually interested in, I can go into more detail.  Other than that, the Warehouse District closer to Target Field is kind of the most night-lifeish area if you are into night clubs and music venues. Not necessarily what you might be looking for, though.  The Light Rail line runs right through the University of Minnesota Campus and basically gets you like two blocks away from TCF Stadium, so staying downtown wouldn't be an issue if you want to take public transportation to the game. The Blue Line can take you to downtown from the airport. The Green Line can take you from downtown to the stadium.  Going back to my college days at the U, my favorite breakfast place is Al's Breakfast in Dinkytown. It is an interesting experience if nothing else: built in the former alleyway between two buildings, it is about 12 feet wide and sits only 12-14 people if I recall. Employees might give new-comers a joking hard time, but they are just having fun with you. Be prepared for a line out the door depending on the day of the week and time that you go, though... probably not the best choice if you are in a rush and need to catch a flight. I am several years removed, but 11am on weekdays was when things slowed down and you could pop in without trouble when I went to school there. ""The Jose"" is love. ""The Jose"" is life. Also, their pumpkin pancakes are ridiculously good and should be seasonally available around the time you are in town."
minnesotavikings,3btpi3,justTheTip12,6,Thu Jul 2 04:50:59 2015 UTC,"Perfect, good info, thanks. We're more into casual bars, loud club music and dancing isn't one of our priorities. We'll probably be doing the breweries- I think that will be more of our scene.  And Al's breakfast is exactly the kind of place I'm looking for, will definitely try it out."
minnesotavikings,3btpi3,1niquity,7,Thu Jul 2 02:19:03 2015 UTC,"Check out Brit's pub. Casual atmosphere, roof seating if it's a nice weekend, and great beer"
minnesotavikings,3btpi3,TrustMeIAMAProfessor,5,Thu Jul 2 03:17:24 2015 UTC,"Assuming you are staying downtown...  If you are looking for breweries, here is a map: http://growlermag.com/minnesota-brewery-map/  Surly Brewing (Right off of the Green Line, for easy access for you if you are doing public transportation) is kind of the big, flagship craft brewery in town. Their new brewery that you'd go to is really a sight to see. They have great food, too, if a bit overpriced in my opinion. If you like IPAs, trying a pint of Furious is a must. As an aside, for daily drinking, I really miss their old taproom in Brooklyn Center because it was so close to me and was much more low-key... Unfortunately the law only lets them maintain one taproom, so the new location wins out. For October 18th you are dangerously close to ""Darkness Day"" time... But they probably won't have Darkness on tap yet when you are around, unfortunately... It is their Russian Imperial Stout that they release every Halloween and people come from around the country to get it. If you're lucky they might pull out some reserve kegs of 2015 Darkness while you are in town to serve at the tap room, or they will break tradition and start tapping the kegs early for 2016, maybe?  Like I said before, in the Nordeast area you have Dangerous Man, Bauhaus, and Indeed. Also, Sociable Cider Werks if you are in the mood for some hard cider instead of beer. Insight Brewing isn't terribly far off from the area, either, and I give them a big thumbs up. 612 Brew is also in Nordeast, but I think they have maybe the worst beer town, personally...   On the westbank U campus you have Town Hall Brewery. Good food and good beer. I like sitting outside on the curbside tables during the autumn months, especially. The Republic is a brewery across the street from them that has a good beer selection, too (both local and otherwise).  Day Block brewing is downtown and just a block or two from the construction site of the new Vikings stadium. I haven't been there in person, but I liked the beer I had from them at a beer festival.  Fulton is also downtown and near the warehouse district / Target Field area. Solid beer there, too."

Bars downtown that ar'n't too loud and annoying would  probly be brothers, or that Irish bar across from the target center. Check out uptown(via uber) for a rooftop experience. Surley is amazing so go there maybe after the game since it's close to tcf field. Other then that you're on the right track. Weather could be in the 40s in October so plan accordingly lol"

If you have to stay downtown then stay in Uptown. That's where the hipsters live. They dress weird but they won't shoot at you. Stella's, Bar Louie and Uptown Tavern were always busy Friday and Saturday night when I worked down there there which was about a year ago. They are all right by each other too. Williams is another place in Uptown that's busy on the weekends. Nothing is really busy on Sunday night there though.  If you stay in Uptown then Uptown Diner is the place for hungover breakfast food. I usually go to Perkins though because it's dirt cheap and a lot closer to home.  If you're going out after the game on Sunday I'd try bars by the stadium first then that night I'm not sure what would be busy. Maybe one of the young guys that still does the does the bar scene could tell you what's busy on a Sunday night.  Oh and all bars can't legally be open past 2am in Minnesota. I remember some people from out of town thought that was weird when they visited here.  Public transportation depends on where you stay and what times you want to travel. http://www.metrotransit.org/  Friday and Saturday night there are cabs everywhere, especially at bar close.

minnesotavikings,3btd3e,paddywacknack,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:54:17 2015 UTC,The best part is the defender has to commit to him going inside. If he hadnt AP cuts inside and strolls in. Oh man I'm excited. But his run against the browns is still the best where he just throws the defender off him out of bounds. I remember because right before that there was the commercial with him for nike and he had like metallic nike skin and defenders hit him and fell off and then that play happened and blew me away. His real  life play was better than a photoshopped commercial.

Exum, Crichton, and Clemmings may not even start and, even if they do get significant playing time will likely have lots of growing pains.

minnesotavikings,3btrqo,n9neteen,21,Thu Jul 2 02:11:47 2015 UTC,"There were a lot of factors I think, and it all came together to create a perfect, shitty storm for our team.  First of all, I believe the wind was COMPLETELY taken out of their sails after the heartache of the NFC Championship game the year before. I don't think the team was ready to climb that mountain again. Chilly lost the locker room after 2009 and from there it was all downhill.  Favre got hurt again, the Moss trade was a disaster, for some reason just one year made all of our veterans go from ""solid veteran presence"" to ""way too old and slow,"" the Metrodome roof caved in...it was just all around ugly. The Bears and Packers also took big leaps forward that year too, so we were 1-5 inside of the division."
minnesotavikings,3btrqo,Barth_Simpson,15,Thu Jul 2 03:22:15 2015 UTC,"I believe the wind was COMPLETELY taken out of their sails after the heartache of the NFC Championship game the year before. I don't think the team was ready to climb that mountain again.   Even as a fan, this was so true. I remember when it was announced that Favre was signing in 09, people went nuts and there was borderline dancing in the streets. What a lot of people don't understand was just how fucking HUGE Favreamania was in the Twin Cities as that season went on. It became a cultural phenomenon throughout the entire state. It was boom or bust. And when we busted, you somehow just knew it wasn't going to work out the next year.  When Favre announced he was coming back, there wasn't nearly as much serendipity. It was like people WANTED to be excited but knew the magic wasn't there anymore. The first game against the Saints basically confirmed it. We were totally rudderless. Mentally, our guys just weren't there anymore. We kicked and scratched and clawed our way to the NFCG. The idea of doing it again, and even then having no guarantees, just didn't seem very viable. I think that's part of the same reason why so many Super Bowl losing teams fail to even make the playoffs the next season."
minnesotavikings,3btrqo,BarackSays,6,Thu Jul 2 05:10:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah you guys have it the most accurate so far. I remember Favre took a long time to decide if he was going to keep playing or not. I think that set the tone for the team's season (not anything against Favre, after the beating his body took in 2009 nobody would blame him for hanging em up). The coaching staff was getting a lot of flack for that 2009 NFCCG game, the 12 men on field after a time out, pushing us out of field goal range, was just inexcusable. Along with the pretty well known rumor that Favre didn't like Childress, they had a target on their back. As soon as the whole Randy Moss trade and release fiasco happened, that was when you knew something had to happen. And it was the right thing to happen. I still don't like Frazier or any of his staff he had here, but Childress still needed to go. That was a joke of a season."
minnesotavikings,3btrqo,Tullimory,10,Thu Jul 2 13:47:24 2015 UTC,"Favre missed some games because of injuries, and was pretty fucked up the games he did play.  AP missed a game  Percy missed some games  Rice missed most of the season. (and was never the same again)  Berrian went from having over 600 yards as a WR 3, to having less than 300 as a WR2.   Chester Taylor left.  Cedric Griffen only played a couple of games.  We lost too many key players for too many games."
minnesotavikings,3btrqo,nomaam05,12,Thu Jul 2 03:13:46 2015 UTC,Chester Taylor left.   This part is not to be understated. His value as a 3rd down back was phenomenal.
minnesotavikings,3btrqo,Sellasella123,4,Thu Jul 2 04:07:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this was the catalyst for the downfall of the season. He was the blocking and check down king of the team.

Drives would have been sustained much easier and longer leading to more scoring opportunities and less 3 and Outs."

minnesotavikings,3btrqo,nomaam05,6,Thu Jul 2 03:17:56 2015 UTC,"Favre's body finally broke down on him and his heart wasn't in it from the start. He came back because he had a strong bond with the guys in the lockerroom, but the magic just wasn't there anymore.  Sidney was dumb and waited too long to get surgery, costing him a big part of the season and also cost Favre a huge target.  Injury riddled defense. Cedric Griffin tore his ACL in the NFC Championship so his time for recovery was short and the guys who filled in for him were AWFUL (Asher fucking Allen). D-line was still strong but opponents could pass all over us now since our safeties sucked too.  Divisional opponents got way better. That was probably one of the biggest factors. They were younger, faster, and hungrier.  Losing games caused Chilly to lose his already shaky hold on the lockerroom. You have to understand, even when were winning, NOBODY in the state liked Brad Childress."

minnesotavikings,3btrqo,DirtD4er,3,Thu Jul 2 20:25:24 2015 UTC,"1 additional year of age, and several veteran players ""hit the wall.""  Favre, Pat Williams, and Allen notably.  Favre was shitty all year.  Fat Pat and Allen went from (IMO) the best at their positions in the league to just another body.  Sidney Rice (WR1) and Cedric Griffin (talented, young CB2) had both been injured vs the bounty hunting Saints bastards and never truly recovered, at least not in Vikings purple.  We also played the Saints in the season Thursday night opener and wouldn't you know it we had even more injuries.  Like others mention, 2009 had a year of destiny feel to it, and after the refs/bounties robbed us, that was gone in a heartbreaking fashion.  Especially after that Favre-Lewis TD to beat the Niners in the last play, every game it was ""How will we win this one?  What miracle is coming?""  After the NFC Championship, it returned to ""How will we blow this one?  What heartbreak is coming?""  There was no fight.  There were a ton of offseason distractions too - Favre and dick pics, Moss returning and getting cut, Childress being his general idiot dickhole self.  The coaching was pretty terrible too - Childress was fired midway through the season (rumor is he got fired for cutting Moss without ownership's permission over Randy being Randy - the 3rd #1 WR for us that Childress had cut over the years).  It's worth noting that the aura and talent of the 09 team got as far as they did IN SPITE of our coaching, not because of it.  With that aura gone and the talent lessened due to age and injuries, the poor coaching couldn't be overcome.  Going into 2009 I felt like we had 1 chance with Favre, Super Bowl or bust.  We busted.  Going into 2010, I didn't feel like anything special would happen - the only exception being the nostalgia of Randy Moss returning home, until Childress cut him."
minnesotavikings,3btrqo,DirtD4er,4,Thu Jul 2 19:56:10 2015 UTC,"I think the main ingredient was that Favre was just too banged up in 2010. He was injured and missed some games for the first time in basically his whole career. There's probably more to it than that, but that's the short answer."
minnesotavikings,3btrqo,naphini,4,Thu Jul 2 02:39:07 2015 UTC,"Easy the 2009 Saints basically ended Favre's careers with cheap late shots that the paid off refs didn't call.  Go look at pictures of Favre shirtless after that game, his whole body was pretty much black and blue. I'm still amazed he finished out that game, and honestly knowing the end maybe he shouldn't have.  Also 2009 revolved a lot around Favre basically telling Childress to fuck of and calling the plays himself. Childress was a horrible coach, unfortunately with how beat up Farve still was in 2010 Farve just couldn't do what he did the previous year."
minnesotavikings,3btrqo,adhal,2,Thu Jul 2 04:52:00 2015 UTC,Another big thing going on was the Jen Sturgis thing. Another big off field distraction. Favres mind was elsewhere
minnesotavikings,3btrqo,carsonr22,2,Thu Jul 2 08:14:11 2015 UTC,"Jared Allen wasn't getting the same pass rush and was even quoted that he realized he needed to get back to his old form when watching tape from '09.  Sage Rosenfelds was gone and no longer the buffer zone between Childress and Favre.  Jenn Steger was a huge distraction not just for Favre, but for the whole team. Ben Leiber even said on 9 to noon that when the guys were on the sidelines and should have been focusing on the next play they would actually be talking about whether or not they thought Favre had sent those texts.  Then when they lost the first game of the season to the Saints it was just like pouring salt unto an open wound, and the Vikes were limping on for the rest of the season."

He tried to make Berrian his guy but it just wasn't going to happen.  When we lost that Dolphins game in week 2 (Seriously, fuck that team.  Why can't we ever beat them?), I knew it was going to shit.  Favre threw 3 picks and the only reason why we scored that game was because Miami fumbled when they were pinned against their own 1 yard line.  Favre to Moss had no magic from the start.  A nice pass on MNF for Favre's 500th TD but otherwise?  Blah.  Defense reared it's ugly head and it went to show in 2011 and 2013 with Frazier."

The out of place part I can buy, but a LOT of that is due to how green he is in the system and as a rookie.  I'm not too shocked by the score. He's a good LB. Was pretty good in pass coverage at Penn State, so the fact that he's been good against the run is really promising (not that he was awful there necessarily).

minnesotavikings,3brake,SnarfSniffsStardust,5,Wed Jul 1 15:25:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe it was a scheme/surrounding talent problem?  Our line might not be the greatest at pass pro, but I wouldn't be surprised if we've got one of the better run blocking lines. I mean, even last year, both McKinnon and Asiata were among the most likely RBs in the league to run for at least 0 to 6 yards per run.  That could be a sign of how opposing defenses decided to focus on the pass once we lost Peterson, or it could just be that McKinnon surprised some people and Asiata's underrated as a short-yardage guy, but I'm betting the line's ability to block had something to do with it.  We had an offense built around the best back in the game for the better half of a decade. It shouldn't be any surprise that we're built to make okay backs look good."
minnesotavikings,3brake,jjspaceman,3,Wed Jul 1 15:45:24 2015 UTC,From what I saw it was just some poor blocking. I rewatched a lot of gerharts plays this year and as much as he tried there was usually a couple people behind the line immediately. He had great yards after catch iirc. I think his biggest problem was that he got injured early on  Edit* I can't grammar today
minnesotavikings,3brake,1niquity,4,Wed Jul 1 16:09:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought Jacksonville's poor line was what held them back a lot; also the reason Bortles didn't play as well, either. I could be mistaken, though. Didn't watch any of their games, just remember reading that was an issue with Bortles."
minnesotavikings,3brake,SnarfSniffsStardust,5,Wed Jul 1 18:49:25 2015 UTC,"He is a pure north/south runner and (in the limited Jacksonville games that I saw) it looked like the interior line had trouble making holes for him. Because of that, it looked like Jacksonville tried to run outside more often, which is not at all what you want Toby to be doing. Their other running backs were more effective in that role."

minnesotavikings,3bsb47,adnasium,24,Wed Jul 1 19:14:36 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent article if you are, like most people, completely and utterly ignorant to how money or the world works, or politics, or really anything that the ""big boys"" take care of.  I think we have a major problem in our society where the media panders to people, rather than explaining things.  I would like to just tear down a few portions of this article to help educate those who perhaps read an article like this and think it's ""great"".  Zygi Wilf has gotten a poor return on the purchasing of the Vikings.  He bought the team 10 years ago for $600 million.  On average, you can get a compound annual return of about 10% in the stock market, just to give one example.  Had Zygi bought a bunch of stock, he's probably be sitting on about $1.65 billion in today's dollars.  Instead, according to Forbes (cited in this article), he is sitting on $1.15 billion.    The article uses the increase in the value of the team as evidence that Zygi has already made out good, which should tell you right off the bat that this thing is written for idiots by idiots.  Right there.  Also, dropping $600 million on a single team in a single league is a freaking absurdly risky ""investment"".  What if the NFL gets really unpopular?  What if the soccer mom's unite their votes and make it illegal for youths to play ""dangerous"" sports like football, and the NFL valuation drops by 10X in light of the obvious limited viability of their sport?  Then your $600 million becomes $60 million.   Now, I did leave out an important fact and if you noticed it, then you might not be a lost soul.  Zygi also can earn (or lose) money annually on his team.  His team is private, and therefore we can't see his cash flow.  The only publicly owned team in the US is the Green Bay Packers, and their annual net income generally is between 10 and 30 million, usually on the low side of that.  That is actually absurdly low, but when players get 66% of all revenue, before you pay a single coach or utility bill, well, you probably won't have much cash.  Since the Packers are a bigger market team, they probably make more than the Vikings.  But if the Vikings did earn the same, then Zygi's investment might be close to market level but still more than likely fall short.  In fact, the Vikings have probably lost money in some of those seasons.  Anyways, I digress.  Buying a sports franchise in any league is an absurdly poor investment that generally never returns near what the market could.  Mark Cuban explains this occasionally better than I can.  The only reason to buy an NFL team is to be an NFL owner and fulfull childhood fantasies and have a freaking awesome fun amazing time doing it.  But for the money?  Don't be naive.  You'd earn more money by just investing your fortune, and you wouldn't have to take any of the same risks.  The rest of the article can very easily be summarized.  We have a representative government, elected by the people, who hold the power to pass laws and make deals.  Our elected government signed a deal which carefully outlined exactly ""who gets what"" in regards to every single item on this entire list.  It was agreed to and signed.  If Zygi DIDN'T get the naming rights for the stadiums during NFL games, then it would be due to our state breaking local and federal laws to prevent him from doing so.  The state could have negotiated for the naming rights, and called it the Nice Guys Edifice or whatever the hell they wanted.  So virtually all of the hand wringing over ""what Zygi gets"" is something that is a completely mute point.  All we know is that Zygi's investment will go from very poor, to possibly meh.  Lastly, why do we care if Zygi could potentially someday get a market appropriate return on his sizable investment?  We should care whether Minnesota is a better place to live with the Vikings staying, despite what we paid, or if we'd have been better off letting them walk and go to LA.  Would are lives, on average, be happier?  I mean, this is a lot of money we're talking about.  $500 million is like if every single citizen had to pay $4 or $5 per year for 25 years!  I have to pay $5 A YEAR to watch 16 Vikings games?  Holy crap.  That's a lot.  Actually I have a wife and two kids, so collectively that's like $20.  I mean, over a freaking buck a game!  I want to cry just thinking about how utterly big of a deal that is.  Also if the team had left, which was a virtual certainty if the State hadn't stepped up, then the net economic impact would have been negative.  Also, why are people so shallow to only worry about money?  An entire article that focuses on misinformation to make it look like some ""evil rich guy"" is making ""too much money"" and we're paying ""too much money"".  Are we that shallow?  When I think of the Vikings, honestly, I think ""wow that's a fucking badass looking stadium and omg that is going to be badass shit yeah"".  That is my reaction.  I don't sit and wring my hands over the $20 a year it is setting me back.    That's just me though.    Edit: fixed one stupid typo $60 million, not $6 million."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,sand0789,3,Wed Jul 1 21:29:56 2015 UTC,"Wilf bought the team in 2005, in 2014(9 years later) forbes valued them at 1.15 billion. Average return of 7.5%  McCombs bought the team for 250million and sold them 7 years later for 600 million, average return 13.3%.   If we combine them the Vikings went from 250 million to 1.15billion in 16 years. A hair over 10% annually.   Do you have a source that you can get an average return of 10% from the stock market? When I google it I get 7%."

minnesotavikings,3bsb47,pingpongguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:04:05 2015 UTC,"How?  Other than the fact that someone profits off the stadium, there really is not much difference. Sure, the people who utilize the facility are different, but both are entertainment venues that are funded with taxpayer dollars.  The scale is certainly different, but the principal is the same. The stadium is a waste of money from a fiscal standpoint and so is the Guthrie and the Walker.  The stadium may recoup up to 50 percent of the investment over the course of its life, I doubt the Guthrie can make that claim."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,Dorkamundo,2,Thu Jul 2 15:57:40 2015 UTC,"Other than the fact that someone profits off the stadium, there really is not much difference.   This is not a small difference though. If the Guthrie was a privately held corporation with $30 million annual profit, I would be against funding it too. But there are other significant differences. Everyone who payed for the Guthrie can feasibly see a show there. The stadium will be cost prohibitive for a lot of people and there are only 8 meaningful games per year. Compared to 600-700 performances at the Guthrie. Same story with the walker."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,pingpongguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:00:12 2015 UTC,"The difference being that I (and thousands of others) will drive the 400 mile round trip to Minneapolis to take in a Vikings game, while staying at one of the hotels in the area, drinking at one of the bars prior to the game, eating at a restaurant near the stadium after the game and shopping at one of many different establishments along the way.   I doubt you can find a single person who would make that trip to go to the Guthrie and spend even a fraction of what I would spend during that time."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,Dorkamundo,2,Thu Jul 2 21:19:46 2015 UTC,"Except every study that's been done on the subject says a stadium doesn't bring in near enough extra revenue to come close to paying for itself.  Plus, do you think people don't go out to eat before a play?  Or go out for drinks afterwards?  How many extra out of town people staying in hotels does it take to make up for the extra $475 million that the stadium cost the state?    But all of this is moot because the Guthrie is not a private corporation."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,pingpongguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:37:15 2015 UTC,"Except every study that's been done on the subject says a stadium doesn't bring in near enough extra revenue to come close to paying for itself.   Nobody is saying it will. I even said earlier that we would be lucky to recoup 50% of the initial investment. But the Guthrie will likely recoup even less.    Plus, do you think people don't go out to eat before a play? Or go out for drinks afterwards?   Some do, yes. But not nearly to the point as someone who is out of town. But just as those studies you reference use to calculate the benefit of the stadium, you have to apply the same concepts to the Guthrie. One of the major ones is the ""Substitution effect"" which states that if the stadium wasn't there, people would spend their money elsewhere. Hence if the Guthrie wasn't there, people would still go to dinner and still spend their money elsewhere in the MSP area.  The same cannot be said for those travelling to the area specifically for a Vikings game, which is a large contingent of people.    How many extra out of town people staying in hotels does it take to make up for the extra $475 million that the stadium cost the state?   See my first response.    But all of this is moot because the Guthrie is not a private corporation.   No it is not. You may be against funding a private corporation, but again the Guthrie is not bringing in money to the city from people as far away as Winnipeg, Omaha, Des Moines and Duluth.  It matters not if it is a public or private entity, it only matters that people want it there and it is a driving force in revenue from sources that would not normally be available.   Yes, we know the stadium is a raw deal. But it is not as raw as some people make it out to be."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,Dorkamundo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:55:04 2015 UTC,"See I think were we just fundamentally disagree is whether or not it is okay to fund private corporations capital expenses.  I do not, you do.  The Guthrie, for the 1000th time, is different because it could not exist without taxpayer dollars.  No one is making millions or billions of dollars off the Guthrie while also sticking their hand out for more subsidies. And even if the stadium does somehow bring in half of what it cost due to out of town visitors (which is very unlikely based on the research that has been done), it is still a $250 million dollar expense.  Or 10x what the Guthrie cost in the first place.    I am glad that the Vikings didn't move to L.A.  I would gladly pay my ""share"" of the stadium cost several times over because it is worth it to me.  I just don't think it a good idea to force everyone in the state to pay for the stadium just so Zygi can have an immediate triple digit ROI."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,pingpongguy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:43:47 2015 UTC,"The Guthrie estimates annual attendance at 500,000 (near the bottom of the page). US Bank Stadium's estimated regular season capacity is 65,000 slightly larger than the metrodome. Moreover, the Vikings broke 500,000 in total regular season attendance in 14 of the last 16 seasons they were in the Metrodome     So basically the Guthrie and US Bank Stadium will serve the same number of patrons and in that sense, number of performances doesn't really matter.      As far as costs go, tickets to the August 15th preseason game against Tampa Bay are from $8 I think we can all agree that's less than the cost of a movie in a lot of cases. And in case you don't think preseason football is ""real football,"" Chargers @ Vikings tickets on September 27th are from $42 which I'd say is roughly what I would expect to pay for a show at the Guthrie.     AND FINALLY, just because I pay taxes for something does not mean I expect to take advantage of or make use of those services. In many cases, like in the case of social programming, I already do not and hopefully will not ever qualify to use those services. On the other hand, I know that paying for and providing those things makes everyone's lives better so I'm happy to do it.      If I felt like doing the research, I could probably even go into the implication of corporate tax breaks that business all across the state receive for one reason or another, but I don't want to and I'm not going to because the fact of the matter is that taxes are a negotiating tool to be used between PRIVATE entities and state, local, and federal governments. If you don't like private businesses being given tax breaks or benefits from the government then you should start advocating 0% tax rates for private businesses and corporations."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,JohnathanTheBrave,3,Thu Jul 2 17:59:50 2015 UTC,"First of all, ticket prices at US Bank Stadium will not be the same as they are at TCF.  You can't just look at the cheapest tickets you can find on stubhub and assume that's what they'll cost at the new stadium.  75% of the tickets will have PSL, which means 75% of the seats will be occupied by season ticket holders, probably more.  The ""cheap"" second hand market tickets will be extremely limited.  Compare that to the Guthrie, where you can go to a show just about any night of the year and get a ticket for $15-30 (often times less).  You cannot honestly say that US Bank Stadium will have that accessibility.   You also make the mistake of comparing a massive expenditure that's purely for entertainment with social programs, which are necessary for those individuals who cannot provide for themselves. Those are totally different things, and the latter benefits you whether you ""use them"" or not.  You also make the mistake of equating tax breaks to capital funding.  A tax break for a corporation is to keep them in MN.  This gives us more tax down the road and keeps the local job market strong.  I have no problem giving the Vikings the same tax breaks that other local businesses get.  I do have a problem spending gobs of money to build their infrastructure for them, just like I would have a problem building a bunch of new stores for Target or Best Buy.  Even though a lot of people buy their products, just like a lot of people buy the Viking's."

I'm just going with your argument and trying to prove that tickets to NFL games aren't nearly as expensive as you say they are (and I'm not going to include places like Dallas, SF, or NYC for what should be obvious reasons including cost of living, and population which would both increase aggregate demand and therefore price).     If I'm not allowed to make that comparison then I guess I'll just say all expenses that aren't related to: social programs, education, infrastructure, and emergency services and other minimally necessary services are frivolous and devoid of value. /s The state government and our elected representatives made the appropriation. I'm not asking you to be happy about it, I just don't think it's as big of a deal as we're making it out to be.

The question that has to be asked is whether or not you think it's a good use of public money and that's largely a matter of opinion.      To me, considering the fact that 1) I already pay for services I'll hopefully never take advantage of and 2) corporate tax breaks are just a negotiating tool between private entities and governments to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes for the third parties that live in those jurisdictions (i.e., government gives tax breaks/decreases regulations that make opening/operating a business easier so that people become/stay employed), I don't mind.

minnesotavikings,3bsb47,pingpongguy,8,Wed Jul 1 20:03:30 2015 UTC,"At the same time the monstrosity now reaching for the clouds on the outskirts of downtown Minneapolis   I stopped reading right there. These are the kind of people that bitch about the state funding part of a building that'll at least return some of the money invested, while championing the state to give more money to museums and parks that will never bring in any money."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,DrNyanpasu,7,Wed Jul 1 23:34:20 2015 UTC,"He got the naming money because it was part of the deal he would.   I don't ""like"" the deal, but it's really this simple: if you want a professional sports team, you build them a place to play once every few decades. Yes, there are examples of owners doing it themselves, but they're they exception. ""Right"" or ""fair"" isn't really the point.   Furthermore, businesses get incentives to stay where they are or come to an area all the time. Not half a billion, but something, and it's a good move. Also, it's not like there is NO value here. Zigi could just as easily say ""why should I build this myself, just so hundreds of businesses and the local government profit off of it?""  A partnership of SOME form is normal and natural, the only real issue is the degree to which they take advantage because they can, but they only can do that because so many other cities ARE willing to build the stadium, which should say something.    So, we take a stand, the Vikings move to LA, and then 10 years later we decide we want a football team after all, spend 2 billion on the stadium, and suffer through a decade of trying to build the Minnesota Muskies into a team. Sound familiar?   Maybe we should have built the team a new stadium before the last possible second, when the team had ALL the power in the negotiations because they could leave tomorrow, instead of pissing away all the leverage while we stood around pretending the Metrodome was a legitimate major sports venue in the 2010s.   Can we move on already?"
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,vita10gy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:45:40 2015 UTC,"Could they have left that easily though? I think if LA actually wanted a football team they would have one.  You're right though, the problem is that even if the LA bogeyman didn't exist there are places willing to throw down for a stadium and until state and local governments collude to end the practice (which I won't hold my breath over) it isn't going to go away."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,mofoqin,3,Wed Jul 1 19:58:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean ""tomorrow"" in the literal sense, just that at point was very close to that option being real. I'd be willing to bet that a much more government friendly deal could have been reached had we sat down prior to such  a major deadline where the Vikings have all the cards.   Kind of like resigning your own players a year early: they're under contract so on the surface why give them more now? The answer is because it isn't that easy and there are factors like: Because you'll likely have to give them even MORE a year from now, when you're negotiating with someone who can become a free agent in a week Because they're willing to take less overall to get bigish money now, due to ""a bird in hand is worth 2 in the bush"" type thinking, etc.   Your lease isn't up for 5 more years. We could put these talk off until that day, but instead lets try and work something out now, with the understanding that we want your contribution to reflect getting into a new stadium 5 years sooner than otherwise, in some fashion."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,vita10gy,3,Wed Jul 1 20:17:05 2015 UTC,"Yes.  This.  If the team was still under lease, the state would in fact have had more leverage.  The metrodome undercut the team's ability to make money.  So if the state said ""you can take this deal today, or you can sit and suffer for the next 5 years until your lease is up"", well, that's a lot of leverage.  Construction costs also greatly outpaced inflation over that period of time, so it did indeed ""cost us more"" to build it when we did.  It can be debated whether calling Zygi's bluff would have been the right more.  But I think it is pretty clear that the State would have been better off negotiating a deal when they had more leverage.  In fact, it would have been better for both parties because the Vikings really wanted out of that dump."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,sand0789,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:55:53 2015 UTC,Deals only get made when they have to get made. Nobody negotiates from a position of weakness if they know that a little later down the road that the stakes will largely be the same and they'll have more leverage than they do right now.
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,JohnathanTheBrave,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:22:32 2015 UTC,"LA will have a football team, and sooner than later.  It will just not be the Vikings.    Would they have left?  I don't know.  We didn't call their bluff.  Zygi mucked his cards.  This ain't WPT."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,sand0789,5,Wed Jul 1 21:41:05 2015 UTC,"The NFL is a corporation essentially, just like Walmart and other franchises that get tax breaks to operate.  The bottom line is, non-football fans are quicker to call it a scam and football fans are more adept at rationalizing a fairly one-sided deal.  What gets me is how many people complain about how our money is being spent, and yet all they do is complain.  They don't pay attention to who they're voting to make sure they're represented properly.  This is a generalization but I think it's true for most of the population.    The other thing that I heard while the deal was being done was ""we should be spending this money on Education or other public needs.""  First of all, the money didn't exist before the stadium talks.  It's not like the State Legislature said ""hey let's reallocate a bunch of money from the schools, Brilliant!""  No, the money was generated specifically for this project.  the question isn't ""why are we spending money on sports?""  The question is ""why is it so much easier to convince our representatives and the public that we should raise money to spend on sports than it is to convince them to raise money for education?""  It says a lot about our society.  Entertainment has been valuable to us since before organized sports really existed.  It's not a mysterious force that steals our tax dollars, it's a legitimate social construct that costs a lot of money to keep around.  Be mad at the state for denying liquor stores being open on Sundays and all the extra tax money that would generate, or be mad at the state for not finding creative ways to ensure that our children have the best education possible.  But don't be mad at the state for giving [most of] us what we want.  Imagine how much it costs annually to be the top bike-friendly city in America, with all the trails and maintenance of bike lanes; just because there wasn't a ""bike-superiority deal"" doesn't mean that it doesn't cost the tax payers money.  And by the way, there is not sports team helping to fund those projects."
minnesotavikings,3bsb47,MN_hydroplane,4,Wed Jul 1 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"Throwing money at education has in recent memory produced minimal impact in cases when it is done.  Money is not everything.  Education starts at home, and it is a value instilled by excellent parenting.    This has nothing to do with what you wrote.  But I just want to get out there that it is poor to assume throwing money at education would make education produce better results.  Truth is that we the people, as a nation, have a lot of parents that don't push education and really don't care about it.  Some of those same parents complain that the schools aren't doing their jobs or don't have enough money, when in fact it is their own fault and the faults of their neighbors.    Families that strongly value education generally get tremendous results from thier children out of our educational system.  It also bears pointing out that while the US has, for over a century, ranked poorly in standardized tests worldwide, we also took over the world with the most innovative and badass technology and just ass-kickedness with those same adults that passed through our ""poor"" education system.  Basically we're like a team that has won 20 consecutive Super Bowls despite only drafting players outside of Mel Kipers top 100."

minnesotavikings,3brle9,NFLVideoConverterBot,2,Wed Jul 1 16:18:46 2015 UTC,"This should be one of the more interesting position battles this year.  In particular, I'm curious to see how things shake out for 4 guys:  Babs - obviously, since he's an interesting story. Unless the league wants to be a dick and deny us an international practice squad spot, he's pretty much guaranteed a practice squad spot this year so that's where I'm sure he'll end up. He's already kind of old for a developmental project at 27, but it's hard not to root for him. The fact that he'll be starting late, and that OL is one of the least age-dependent jobs on the team (with game-age from the abuse they take on the field being more important than biological age) might give him a shot to have a solid contract's worth of play if he catches on within a year or two.  Yankey - seems like a tough one to pin down. He's gotten first team RG reps in OTAs, but IIRC, he's spent most of his time on the second team at LT or LG. Does he have a future with the team as a starter, or was he a late round flyer that never grows beyond a backup role?  TJ Clemmings - There's a lot of talk about him playing guard this year, and if he's the best candidate for the job then sure... getting a starting RG in the 4th round is nothing to scoff at. But his measurables (mostly his relatively low bench reps, and his relatively strong broad/high jump and short shuttle results) are probably more suited to right tackle than anywhere else on the line. Is he going to be groomed to be a potential Loadholt replacement?  Tyrus Thompson - There's talk among some parts (mostly click-bait generators like BR) that Thompson could be the starting RG this year. He's a bit heavier and stronger than Clemmings, but that's about all he's got on him. It's more than likely going to come down to which guy (if either) has better technique in training camp, but it could be interesting if we wind up playing him over Clemmings in the RG spot. Or even better yet, if we wind up playing two rookies on the right side of the line, if Loadholt isn't 100% by the start of the season."

Scouts will receive points based on the player's real life performance throughout their career, with multipliers based on where the scout had that player ranked on their Big Board, Positional Ranking, and Sleeper rankings.  I hope that answers your question, if not, let me know.   Will there be monthly/yearly leaderboards, in addition to the all time leaderboard, to keep new users engaged?

I was rather young so a lot of the details are hazy. I just remember minnesota getting an Interception for a TD, and Kick-off for a TD (or punt return) and being like.. this is my team. It was one of the early morning games (atleast of the west coast).  I had grown up watching football with my Grandfather and my family but never really had a team (being from SoCal born '89)."

The first game I remember going to I was with my dad and grandpa and my grandpa had a heart attack halfway thru. I was between 8-10 y.o. I didn't really know what was going on but the paramedics came and took him away from our seats, he survived. It's odd the things you remember; I recall my dad saying he would buy me a football with a whiteout panel and I was confused/disappointed when we left without it. When I was 15 My grandpa passed away three days after we went to a vikings game together. I have the ticket from that game framed in my theater room along with pieces of the metrodome roof. We also own my grandpa's seat from the metrodome that we plan to put legs on someday."

The next game I went to was again the Bears when I was in college the in the 90s. The game where Ditka blew up on Harbough on the sidelines. Was an awesome game cause we came back after being down like 20? and i was there with a Bears fan.   The last game I went to was in New Orleans on my 40th in 2008. It was a fairly high scoring game with Longwell kicking a fg to win it. But New Orleans was a great city. Then 2009 happened. I haven't been back since.

Then just a few days before the game, an old, washed-up QB named Brett Favre signed with my team.  I was pissed.  I was sure this ancient, past his prime guy convinced himself he could still play simply because he wanted to stick it to his old team, since we played them twice each season.  I was going to watch my team go down in flames because couldn't accept reality.  When the players' names were announced as they ran on to the field, I booed loudly at our new QB.  The kid in front of me turned around and game me a ""What's wrong with you?"" look.  I didn't care, I knew more than he did.  The rest is history."

The first game I remember going to was a Vikings/Bears payoff game. I was 7, 8 or 9 somewhere around there (92-94ish). It could have been a bit after that. I don't even remember who won. All I remember is I took a small chain I found at my house, had it around a teddy bears neck, and had it dangled out the window of the car driving in. I have no idea why my dad let me do this, as now being 30 he still gets upset when I swear. Anyway, I carried it into the stadium, holding it up high and proud. Many Vikings fans cheering for me and giving me high fives. A lot of pictures taken. First half had a lot of screaming and twirling around the hung bear. Then it happened.  Middle of the third quarter my dad left to go to the bathroom. So it's just my mom, sis, and I. A bears fan walked up to me and pushed me over (in my seat), took the bear and threw it, while his friend poured his beer on me (an entire beer) and then spit in my face. Luckily some random Vikings fan hero who I never learned the name of saved the day by beating this guy and his friend senseless. The two guys got arrested, and I went home distraught and tormented.  Fuck Chicago. In every way possible. Fuck that while city and their shitty sports teams.  Edit: only bad experience I've had at any professional sporting event. I also saw AP get 296, Carter hit 1000, Barr strip and return for TD (in Tampa), Chris Walsh literally knocking a guys shoes off, and many more. I've been blessed when it comes to going to games.  TL:DR- Bears fans gave me a reason to hold high prejudice against all Chicago fans"

It was snow there were cars going into ditches left and right but we made it and My dad got tickets from a customer of his and we ended up FRONT ROW on near the goal line. My biggest memories were Chris Carter catching a TD from Brad Johnson right in front of us, the cheerleaders gave us hats, my mom and I ended up on the Jumbotron, and after the game a trainer from Tampa Bay gave us WR towels.

To this day, I believe this game primed me to be a true blooded Vikes fan for the rest of my life.  I wouldn't get to my next game until 1998, again against the Redskins, and we freaking creamed them of course.

What a day, will never forget the eggs and hash I had across from the dome. 2nd game was Vikings v. Cardinals in Tempe in 2003 when the Cards knocked the Vikes out of the playoffs. Tons of Vikes fans on site to see Moss make a one handed behind the back play, and then see Nathan Poole catch a tip toed touchdown pass in the corner of the end zone I was sitting in to win that fucking game."

In 2005, we went to a preseason game, Patriots at Packers, and seeing Tom Brady and Favre on the field was cool. 2006 preseason, was Titans at Packers. I don't remember much about that one, except it was hot as balls out, and the drunk people in front of me kept offering me beer. (I was 10.) 2007 Preseason, Jaguars at Packers, Desmond Bishop had a monster hit on Reggie Williams.  Then I didn't see an NFL game again until September 2013, when a friend and his parents had an extra ticket to the Redskins/Packers. I went hoping to see RG3 demolish the Pack, but that unfortunately didn't happen. Then, for my 18th birthday; I convinced that friend and his dad (both Packer fans) to go with me to the Packers at Vikings game. It was my first Vikings game, and though we lost, it was epic, because... Cordarrelle had his record kick return!!! That game made all those trips to Lambeau pale in comparison, and I was so glad I got to our old stadium just once in my lifetime; now, I'm saving for tickets in our new stadium, but I might have to buy them for this year, because it may be Chad Greenways last season, and he's been my favorite player since he entered the league."

MINNEAPOLIS -- Mike Wallace was hired by the Minnesota Vikings to be a wide receiver. Mike Wallace always wants to do good but has had trouble lately. Therefore, Mike Wallace wants very badly to do good this year. The Minnesota Vikings also always want to do good and have also had trouble lately. Maybe Mike Wallace doing good will make the Minnesota Vikings do good? That would probably make everyone happy. That would be neat!  Mike Wallace has ran on the practice field. Mike Wallace has caught balls that Teddy Bridgewater has thrown. Mike Wallace has run very fast. Teddy Bridgewater says he likes Mike Wallace. Teddy Bridgewater says Mike Wallace catches good. Mike Wallace has said he likes Teddy Bridgewater. Mike Wallace and Teddy Bridgewater play video games together. It sounds like Mike Wallace and Teddy Bridgewater are friends. That is neat!   Coach Mike Zimmer saw Teddy Bridgewater throw and also saw Mike Wallace run on the field and catch the balls that Teddy Bridgewater had thrown. This makes Coach Mike Zimmer happy because he likes to see football players go fast and catch balls good. Coach Mike Zimmer is cautiously optimistic. Norv Turner is cautiously optimistic. Maybe they will all be good. If you are a Minnesota Vikings fan, that is neat!  When asked about his new teammate, Everson Griffen said he likes Mike Wallace. It turns out that players you might not expect to interact with each other actually do interact. Sometimes they have fun. Sometimes they like each other. This makes it easier to remember that these are real people. That is neat to think about!   Cordarelle Patterson said that he also likes Mike Wallace. This is surprising because you might think that Cordarelle Patterson and Mike Wallace don't like each other because they are competing against each other. But it turns out that they actually do like each other! That is neat. Mike Wallace says he likes his new teammates, too."

At the end when he was on his way out, somebody went up to him to have him sign something. They were like 10 feet from me, so seizing the opportunity, I went up to him. I realized I was holding my empty Aquafina bottle, so when he turned to me I just said ""Hey Ben, will you sign my bottle?"" He laughed and said sure! While he was signing it I said ""you know the Powertrip guys are right, you are a good looking guy in person."" He chuckled, said thanks and gave my signed bottle back to me.

He might not stand out in any one area, and lacks the splash plays, but he's a consistent contributor that really holds the airwaves together.    While some doubt his high end potential as a pro bowler, he's the type of low cost workhorse that quietly can make or break your station, even if you don't know it.

minnesotavikings,3bpomb,Ricky_Droschmidt,2,Wed Jul 1 13:35:37 2015 UTC,"PA's on vacation, KFAN becomes reasonable.  He is insufferable sometimes but his optimism is supported to a certain extent.  He thinks 9-7 is the least we can do, I think 9-7 is a realistic goal, 10-6 probably being the ceiling just looking at our schedule.  He just optimizes his opinion to superfan levels.  I appreciate his dedication to the squad though  Common is funny, has good insight into sports, better insight into day-to-day practicalities.  However, he does get pretty negative just for the sake of bursting hope-bubbles, but we need that sometimes.    Berreiro is probably my favorite, mainly because it's the best thing to listen to after work while driving home.  It's the perfect mix of sports and nonsense.  The top 5 at 5 is always great.  His rants are epic but usually the voice of reason.  We can't forget the producers who do a fantastic job keeping the shows moving and providing interesting content"

Corey Cove is the shit, love that guy. He's great at tearing into callers making dumb arguments (ponder/Khalil defenders). I remember him predicting we acquire Greg Jennings. Also Ben Leber is the man. Great to get some perspective from an ex vike. But most of all the show is very grounded and are never leanin off dat purple drank.

I recall him explaining to callers who ask why do we try to win games when we are out of the playoff picture. He said these guys are playing for their careers, they are trying to make good tape to put on their resume. The players don't give an shit about draft picks. That may be a no brainier but that's the only example I could think of."
minnesotavikings,3bpomb,nautilusnautilus,2,Wed Jul 1 11:57:01 2015 UTC,"PA is my favorite because as hyperbolic and unrealistic as his optimism is, it's entertaining radio to hear glowing reviews of your favorite teams. Common man is hilarious but if I want actual sports coverage it gets lost in the bit. Barreiro sucks and his takes are constantly terrible. His personal vendetta against Mauer is borderline psychotic. I do, however, love his Funkadelic coverage of the Wolves.That said I listen to his show more often than any others for some reason. I can't listen to the Power Trip Morning Show. It reminds me of my high school friends sitting around in a basement trying to outdo each other for dumbest, most disgusting inside joke. Fun with friends, mind numbing with strangers."
minnesotavikings,3bpomb,ClemDeLaClem,5,Wed Jul 1 06:03:59 2015 UTC,"PA being ultra positive is basically his gimmick at this point. They even mention it in the show's intro music.  Common is my favorite by far. It takes a bit to get used to his style, but once you do, he's so enjoyable and flat out fun to listen to. Even the sound bites on that show make me laugh.  Barreiro is my least favorite. Too heavy on politics and other non-sports subjects and his style is just really boring to me.  Maybe I'm just cranky in the morning but Power Trip has never done much for me. To me it sounds like 6 people all yelling over each other at once and referencing a bunch of inside jokes that I don't understand then laughing for 30 seconds of essentially dead air.   That said, all of the shows are still better than any nationally syndicated ones they play at the later hours or on weekends. Dan Patrick is the only somewhat tolerable one but even he's bogged down significantly by the annoying ass Danettes (most notably by McLovin, rocking a cool hip teen reference from fucking 2008 as his on-air name)."

minnesotavikings,3bpomb,Nickthegreat,2,Wed Jul 1 05:42:30 2015 UTC,"This sub has become a lot more optimistic than it was two months ago. I felt like I was in a small minority who thought we had a really good team capable of making the playoffs. I still think the only thing that holds us back from being a really good team is Matt Kalil playing at the same level as the last two seasons. I really feel like he's the big X factor with this team. Now, after dozens of articles and quotes from big-name NFL people about the Vikings being a playoff caliber team, this sub has gotten a big-time boner for the possibility of making the playoffs this year. I don't listen to the radio so I'm not sure how confident PA is, but, knowing PA, I would imagine people in this sub are a little more reserved in their optimism than he is."

Love the power trip, yes its a trainwreck but they embrace it and they are funny people. I've listened long enough to get most of the inside jokes and as bad as Meatsauce can be, he is like a set up guy on a TV show, he says something and the others play off it. He also has a few good lines from time to time.  Big fan of common. Not a fan of PA's show but he is a great football commentor. Barriero is great interviewer but I don't really like the way he and JG sensationalize certain things and act like they are mad about it."

minnesotavikings,3bsp5t,kjhonek24,3,Wed Jul 1 22:15:55 2015 UTC,I took a year off last year from FF after doing it for the last 10ish years.  Made watching football so much less stressful and enjoyable.  Enjoy the off year!  I'm not planning on going back to FF this year either.

But there are 15 other games (in non bye weeks) that actually now have interest for me. I don't take it seriously...I have fun with it. The waiver wire isn't a huge hassle and I never forget to set my roster...that's an 11:30 am Sunday ritual now.  Oh, and if you want to add fun to draft day do auctions not snake drafts. Snake drafts are for beginners. Want a shot at every player in the league? Auction. 2015 marks my 15th year playing. Love it more every year."
minnesotavikings,3bsp5t,carsonr22,2,Thu Jul 2 04:28:23 2015 UTC,Totally agree with auction. We did an auction for the first time last year and I honestly think the auction was more fun than the actual league. A lot of trash talk.

Sure if your really good at it you can make a lot of money, but I'm not about to kid myself and believe that's me.

In 2011, I got 3rd place in a very competitive league, with Mark Sanchez and Tim Tebow as my QBs. In 2012, Adrian carried me to the playoffs, but I got 5th. In 2013, I was in two leagues; my longtime league I finished 11/12, because all but one of my drafted players ended up injured, and the other one was a kicker who I released. In the 2nd league, I was the best regular season team, but finished 3rd. Last year, I got third in that league again, and 10th in the longtime one, because my running backs were Adrian and Ray Rice...  I think my short term league is breaking up, and I'm not really close to the people in the longtime one anymore, so this year may be more focussing on my college homework."

minnesotavikings,3bojxa,MUTGraphics,14,Tue Jun 30 21:43:10 2015 UTC,"I wasn't alive but the 1975 Vikings that lost on the original Hail Mary against the Cowboys in the playoffs (PEARSON PUSHED OFF AJFBEJAB) are generally considered the best Bud Grant coached Vikes team, which says a LOT considering he brought 4 others to the actual Super Bowl.  But I think the clear choice would probably be 1998. They were 11 point favorites against a 14-2 Falcons team...in the NFC Championship Game. That's pretty fucking good."
minnesotavikings,3bojxa,BarackSays,14,Wed Jul 1 00:53:47 2015 UTC,"Look, for me? '98 and '09 are a toss up. They both hurt equally bad. One I was a kid for and one I was at college and sat in a bathtub pulling Phillips vodka on the phone with my other die hard vikings friend. Just saying, ""How.....How....man (10 seconds of silence)....but...like...how did we lose that? '98 and '09 were different though. Both years we we were heavy favorites but '98, Moss and Cunningham came the fuck out of nowhere. '09, you could smell the bandwagon hop ons as soon as Favre joined. Everybody and their momma was going, ""that MN team is nasty. The Vikes are my team this year!"". It was disgusting. '98 had an element of surprise, which was equally exciting as the ""ESPN Favre watch"". Just different.   '98 and '09, We tore up everybody but '09 was so satisfying watching Favre dominated the Pack, and just about everybody else. He may have had his best year in '09, which says a lot from the 3-time MVP.   BUT, being this is /r/minnesotavikings, we can't just forget the '69 - '78 Bud Grant teams only missing the playoffs once ('72). We are without a doubt, the best team to never win a Super Bowl. (Ok, Browns, Bills, and Eagles have cases) But really, that's a 9 year stretch of outstanding football. Very impressive regardless of bias.   That's Patriots type shit so, IDK, if you had to pick the best Patriot team, would you pick the one from '07 that lost to the Giants? Probably. I would. That team was sick. For us? Our '07 Patriot equivalent would be tough to call.   Maybe it would be:   '69, lost first game, then went 12-0, lost super bowl, finished 12-2   I'd vote maybe the 1975 team as the best team. Started the season 10-0. Went up 14-10 on the eventual Super Bowl champ Cowboys. Roger Staubach found Drew Pearson for a 50-yard Hail Mary touchdown and the Cowboys shocked the Vikings 17-14. Most Vikings’ fans believed that Pearson should’ve been called for pass interference on the reception (replays show Vikings’ All-Pro cornerback Nate Wright falling down).  Also, few people remember, Dallas Tarkenton, the father of Minnesota quarterback Fran Tarkenton, died of a heart attack while watching the game on TV from his home in Georgia.  Either '69, '71 (Alan Page's MVP Season), or '75 teams would be a good choice on a ""Could've been"" dynasty that saw 4 super bowl appearances. But I'm just riding the fence here. I'll admit, I cried in '98 but I was 10.   Real Not Riding the Fence Answer '09. Not because I was older but because pre-season, all we needed was a QB. Everybody new that. Well? We got one. And he slung the shit out of that ball. We lost the NFC championship game in OT by 3 points with 5 turnovers. FIVE TURNOVERS. AP fumbled at the Goaline for CHRIST'S SAKE!   THEN you throw in this shit:   Chad Greenway called for a phantom PI that leads to the game winning Aint's FG in OT. The fact that they MADE AN OT RULE after we lost that if you kick a FG on your first possession in OT, the other team has a chance to respond. Hmmm? why would they do that? Cuz we were clearly the better fucking team and that was bullshit. IDK...hmmm....how about BOUNTY GATE? (Gregg Williams is a G though). Favre got ""high-lowed"" on a hit and it was embarassing not seeing a flag. That pick Favre throws never happens if that's called. Little remembered fact: Darren Sharper had 11 Tackles + 2 QB Hits on Favre that game. Well? We let him go the year before. He played outstanding for us having 17 picks for us from '05-07'   Yea '09 was by far the worst. We would've ripped Peyton's fuckin heart out in the Superbowl, He'd still have zero rings, and Favre rides off into the sunset as the greatest QB in Vikings history. Nuff said. That shit hurt more than '98, given those circumstances.  TL;DR: I problem solved '98 Vs. '70s Vs. '09 on the fly. Resulting in: '09 makes '98, '69, and '75 look like little bitch losses. And fuck the 'Aints. And I may have gotten drunk in the process of reading this shit and thought the question was, which loss hurt the most. Fuckin' A  Edit: Spelling, Grammar, and shiz"

minnesotavikings,3bojxa,ArifHasanDN,6,Tue Jun 30 23:41:17 2015 UTC,"Surprised 1969 isn't getting more love here (hurr hurr).  I've mentioned/written about it extensively before and I know that 1998 had one of the top offenses of all time, but I still contend that 1969 had the best era-adjusted defense of all time (or... post 1960, anyway) while also putting up fantastic offensive numbers.   The 1969 Vikings ranked first in points allowed, points scored and opponent adjusted points allowed and points scored. 1998 was a great team with a very good defense, but I think the 1969 offense was better than the 1998 defense, even after acknowledging that the '69 defense may have helped out their own offense more than the '98 offense helped out their own defense.  I think comparing talent to talent is difficult, but may come out ahead in 1969's favor:   Alan Page > Randall McDaniel (pretty close) Carl Eller > Randy Moss (or at least, 1998 Randy Moss) John Randle > Paul Krause (tough, but Krause actually had a down year for interceptions—5—and Randle had 10.5 sacks which I think swings it despite a smaller impact on the run game than he normally has) Mick Tingelhoff > Cris Carter (also very tough, but Tingelhoff was particularly good in 1969. He got to prove in '67 that his pass protection had nothing to do with Tarkenton and '69 was the lowest sack percentage the Vikings had in their team history at that point while at the same time posting the highest yards per rushing attempt in the three years before or after 1969. Those would end up being the best running back YPC Vikings would put up before Chuck Foreman arrived. Both Tingelhoff and Carter made the Pro Bowl that year, but Mick grabbed the AP All-Pro and was named the Top OL of the Year by the 1000-yard club, in particular innovating cross-blocking with guards and cutting off middle linebackers) Jim Marshall > Robert Smith Randall Cunningham > Ron Yary Gene Washington > Jeff Christy Gary Larsen > Ed McDaniel Gary Anderson > Grady Alderman   Or thereabouts. For the most part the best players for the 1969 team were better for their position than the 1998 guys, in my opinion and the numbers back it up (1st/1st in a season is better than 1st/6th and for their era, the '69 defense was better than the '98 offense with both being historic).   The '69 Vikings had 9 Pro Bowlers and eight All-Pro selections while the '98 Vikings 10 Pro Bowlers and nine All-Pro selections so it's up to you (and kicker Fred Cox should have made the Pro Bowl over the Falcons' Bob Etter—not only did he grab the All-Pro, he had better FG% by 20 percent (70.3% to 50%), and better FG% at every distance - 100% from 0-19, 100% from 20-29, 89% from 30-39, 40% from 40-49 and 0% from 50+ (Etter: 100%, 100%, 50%, 0%, 0%)). I didn't distinguish between first and second-team All-Pro because 1969 was inconsistent and hard to determine from that perspective. I only counted AP All-Pros.  I think the best argument for the 1998 team is that it only lost one game of 16 while 1969 lost two of 14, but Kapp was sidelined for both games—Cuozzo's fumble was the reason that allowed HOF DE Claude Humphrey's to score the winning TD in the final game of the season while two consecutive Tarkenton drives allows the Giants to come back against the Vikings in the first game of the season.   The Bucs game the Vikings lost in 1999 was probably as bad as that Giants game in terms of late comebacks (Vikings couldn't hold on to the ball, had to punt, then couldn't hold off the comeback drive as they allowed penalties to help the Bucs). I don't think the Vikings would have lost either game with Kapp in instead of Cuozzo."
minnesotavikings,3bojxa,TheAesir,0,Wed Jul 1 11:50:49 2015 UTC,"uh Randall McDaniel is arguably the best player to play his position. Alan Page, why amazing, can't make that claim.  Actually for the most part, none of these comparisons make sense. You need to compare the positions as a whole, and not just the top talent."
minnesotavikings,3bojxa,ArifHasanDN,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:35:02 2015 UTC,"Huh? Both were historically great and arguably the best to play their position. Larry Allen and Bruce Matthews may have better claims than McDaniel, and Alan Page is still the only defensive tackle and the first defensive player to win the MVP. Obviously other have claims to the top 3-technique spot as well, but I don't think it's particularly close.  A third-party statistician (John Turney, from Utah) went through gamebooks, then NFL film to compile pre-1982 sacks, and has had them published in a few books, as a researcher for the Pro Football Researcher's Association. Turney has worked with NFL Films and nearly every NFL team. He is most famous for spearheading the drive that got Jack Youngblood into the Hall of Fame.   You know who has the most sacks for a defensive tackle of all time? Alan Page, with 148.5—that's 7th all time, at any position. Only two other defensive tackles had over 100 sacks, John Randle (137.5) and Randy White (111). Cortez Kennedy? 58.0. Warren Sapp? 96.5. Bob Lilly? 94.5.  Beyond that, Page did it at a time when it was damn near impossible to get 10 sacks a season for a DT (his high was in 1978 when he got 18). Pass protection was worse, but that was more than washed out by the fact that teams simply passed fewer times, and did so in fewer games. Before I tell you about Page's per-pass-attempt sack ability, we can look at some of the best in the NFL now and throughout history (using team totals, not player snap count totals):   Cortez Kennedy: 1.0% Geno Atkins: 1.1% Ndamukong Suh: 1.3% Joe Greene (not a 3-technique, so it's not the ""same position""): 1.4% Warren Sapp: 1.6% Randy White: 2.0% John Randle: 2.5% J.J. Watt (not called a DT, but he plays 3-tech more than any other alignment): 2.6%   Alan Page sacked the quarterback on 3.4% of opponents' passing plays. That's more than the per-play production of Haloti Ngata (0.5%) and J.J. Watt combined. It's better than combining John Randle and Ndamukong Suh.   And it wasn't necessarily easier to get high sack percentages in the 60s and 70s—Bob Lilly sacked the QB on 1.8% of passing plays and Merlin Olsen on 1.6%. Turney, who is a huge fan of Lilly, remarked at how surprised he was that Lilly's sack totals weren't that high. He said in the book Super 70's, ""I would have thought that Merlin Olsen and Bob Lilly would have been well over 100. Joe Greene as well. But because of the positions they played - mostly as run-stopping tackles - they actually set up more sacks than they got themselves. Then again, Alan Page, who was also a tackle, was able to get a lot of sacks, reaffirming how great a player he really was.""  In Alan Page's peak year, he grabbed 18 sacks (1976). That represents 5.9% of the passing plays the Vikings were up against. The peak percentages for other players:   Randy White: 3.8% Keith Millard: 3.8% J.J. Watt: 3.7% Cortez Kennedy: 3.4% John Randle: 2.9% Warren Sapp: 2.9% Ndamukong Suh: 2.0%   And his same-era peers, Merlin Olsen and Bob Lilly, had peak years of 2.6% and 2.3%.  The only person I wish I had data on is Buck Buchanan, but I've been told he's also had fewer than 100 sacks.  I mean, seriously. Reggie White has 198.0 sacks and has been on teams that have had the opponent pass 9203 times. That's 2.2%. Do you get why they gave Page the MVP? It wasn't even in his peak sack season they gave it to him, either.  Page was pretty damn good against the run, too. Teams will overestimate tackle totals, so you shouldn't believe the Vikings when they say he had 1,120 tackles (before he left for Chicago), but it is relevant that the Vikings have an all-time list of five team career leaders in tackles and the only one from the Purple People Eaters era is Page—not Eller, Larsen, Marshall or a linebacker like Hilgenberg, who started from 1969 to 1976. Teams generally seem to overestimate tackle totals (if we assume 1994 represents stability in tackle statistics) by about 25%. It's still a pretty bad stat for linebackers and defensive backs, but it is at least relevant for DLs. It would give Page 18.6% of team tackles against the run after adjusting for the fact that they don't have his Chicago statistics but overinflate the Vikings statistics. Close to him are Randy White (18.7%) and J.J. Watt (15.0%). After that it's Kennedy (11.7%), Suh (10.4%) and Sapp (9.0%).   Given how aggressive the front four setup was for Dallas, St. Louis and Minnesota, I don't think many of these are ""bad"" tackles, especially given how many accounts there are of Page meeting running backs in the backfield and forcing fumbles during the handoff. Though I would argue that Lilly (because of the Landry Flex) and Greene (because of the tilted nose) did more to change offensive blocking schemes (as well as Culp for changing the NT prototype), Page was the first modern DT to force OL to change their blocking setups in preparation for the game.  I won't say that Randall McDaniel isn't one of the greatest guards of all time. But I don't know if he's better than Allen or Matthews. It is hard for me to say that Page isn't the greatest three-technique of all time, if not defensive tackle (something I will defend too, but it is harder to compare Culp/Greene to that). Page wins by a significant margin.  NOTE: You can find much of the Turney Sack List in books like the Pro Football Historical Abstract but I've grabbed all the 100+ sack artists from various Turney forum posts (he's not just a forum-goer, he's been invited to NFL Films to clear up data, etc—all mentioned above) and updated it to 2014. Turney ended up calling Page the best inside pass-rusher of all time, not just because of his research, but the film he saw.  As for comparing positions as a whole, you would have to adjust for positional importance for each era. Still, '69 wins with DL, OL, LB and DBs, while '98 wins with QB, RB and WR. If nothing else, that's the entire side of the field plus the trenches on the offense (and I guess tight end, too).  Could the 1998 team beat the 1969 team? Easily. But for their era, the 1969 team was better statistically and player for player."
minnesotavikings,3bojxa,sand0789,0,Wed Jul 1 19:09:45 2015 UTC,"I don't argue that some of the advanced metrics for the 1969 team were better than 1998.  I also don't argue against the fact that I'm biased, having witnessed 98' in its glory, and pain.  But...the 1969 team went 12-2 in the regular season, and the 1998 team went 15-1.  While the Vikings offense was #1 in 1969, the Vikings offense was like #1 of all time in 1998, so I think that makes up for the lower defensive ranking.  Both teams had a similar point scoring differential, though the 69 team was one point higher at 17 and a decimal's worth.    I like 98'.  For me, the higher winning percentage is the ""tie breaker"".  But if I was 16 years old in 1969 then no doubt I'd sing a different tune."

minnesotavikings,3bojxa,Xanthum1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:18:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know how your simulation works, but does it assume the league gets better over time?  The numbers suggest that the 1969 team was more dominant.  But given that the league tends to get stronger every year, I'd expect the 1998 team to beat them in a head-to-head battle.  The other thing is that if you are planning on sharing the results you want it to be entertaining for redditors.  Many/most redditors remember the 1998 team.  At the very least people are familiar with Randy Moss and Cris Carter.  So if you are unsure, I'd choose the 1998 team.  Reading a fictional recap of a game involving Moss and Carter would be more entertaining than reading about Joe Kapp."
minnesotavikings,3bojxa,dejour,2,Wed Jul 1 16:28:21 2015 UTC,"Alright, got it, man.  Although there are some assumptions that the league gets better over time, (i.e, the 1960's Chiefs are likely to get beaten by the 2013 Seahawks) the simulation is made sure to be very balanced, so the '69 Vikings would definitely be contenders. However, I think I'll go with the '98 team since it's a popular choice and highly entertaining.  It should be up later today or tomorrow on /r/NFL, just gotta put a lot of effort into it.

minnesotavikings,3borqd,Dorkamundo,5,Tue Jun 30 22:49:47 2015 UTC,Agree. It also kind of reinforces the fact that Ponder was just really really bad.
minnesotavikings,3borqd,Zacthor,2,Wed Jul 1 12:52:26 2015 UTC,Then why would he want Ponder back on his team?
minnesotavikings,3borqd,crabOnaStick,2,Wed Jul 1 15:38:11 2015 UTC,Agree   He's a decent backup quality quarterback. Never has/will be a decent starting quarterback.
minnesotavikings,3borqd,Zacthor,17,Wed Jul 1 19:34:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it was Ponder.  I mean, it was pretty apparent that he had zero poise and would crumble if there's ANY pressure on the pocket.  He's a guy that was smart, and athletic, could practice well, but just couldn't handle live game pressure.  The stagnation of the passing game wasn't on Musgrave as much as it was his lack of QB talent. He just didn't have much to work with in Ponder.  I could definitely see it being the case that he's just not fit to handle a whole offense, and is better focusing just on QB play. But that would kind of go hand in hand with my previous point, an OC who's QB-focused cant make an effective offense with Ponder at the helm."

He somehow managed to call enough good plays to allow Peterson to have by far the best year of his career, with a bad QB and bad WRs.  Yes, Peterson did all the heavy lifting, but I don't think people give Musgrave enough credit for designing a workable offense without any talent in the passing game, which in today's NFL is kind of hard to believe.  All that being said, I'm really glad we got Norv."
minnesotavikings,3borqd,jmcdon00,3,Wed Jul 1 12:39:58 2015 UTC,"I've defended Musgrave many times, I really wanted the Vikings to keep him last year.   Vikings were 29th in points scored the year before Musgrave. They improved every year he was here, ranking 14th in 2013.   QB is the most important position on any offense. Look at the top 10 offenses, in any year, almost all have a franchise QB. Musgrave had Ponder(35starts), Donovan McNabb(6 starts), Matt Cassel(6 starts), Josh Freeman(1 start).   He puts playmakers in a position to succeed.    Patterson was utilized in the run game, and screen game with great success. Production fell dramatically under Turner.  Harvin had his best season in 2011, and was on pace to be even better in 2012 before getting injured. Hasn't done anything since. Peterson had his best season with Musgrave calling the plays."
minnesotavikings,3borqd,SkoalVikings,2,Wed Jul 1 19:31:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think they should have done that with Patterson as a rookie with all the gadget plays. I think it stunted his development and it has done him a disservice to his long term success in the NFL as a WR.   As far as ranking 14th in points scored it isn't that impressive. It's around middle of the pack. I think when you fire the head coach it's OK to drop his OC if his best ranking in points scored over a three year period is mediocre. Chicago managed to be 2nd in points scored in the NFL in 2013 with freaking Jay Cutler. Now that's impressive.  They didn't improve their ranking in points scored every year under Musgrave.  They were also ranked 14th in points scored in 2012. The way you word that it makes it seem like the offense was ascending every year in points scored, but the offense basically plateaued in 2012 if the only metric you want to use is total points. They were 19th in 2011 in points scored. So in three years under Musgrave the team ranked 19th, 14th and 14th in points scored. They also ranked 18th, 20th and 13th in total offensive yards over the same period under Musgrave. Every year they are in that middle third of the league offensively under Musgrave. I repeat myself, but again I just view this as mediocrity and not a great feat.  Just about every year some guy on the team has a career year. So, if you stick with a team for three years you're going to have guys that did well in your system. Last year for Norv Turner it was Matt Asatia, Chase Ford, Rhett Ellison and Jarius Wright. 4 guys in one year all had career years who all also played for Bill Musgrave. I don't view this as proof of anything. Next year you can probably add Charles Johnson and Teddy Bridgewater to the list provided they both stay healthy just based on the increase in total snap counts over the course of all 16 games as starters."
minnesotavikings,3borqd,WhatMovesYou,4,Thu Jul 2 01:28:20 2015 UTC,Good QB coach very bad play caller. I would always think what is the worst play we could run here and sure enough that would be the play he called.

minnesotavikings,3borqd,CederDUDE22,4,Thu Jul 2 00:17:56 2015 UTC,"I believe Musgrave can come up with some good plays and packages. He can even really take advantage of some player's athletic ability in some cases.   But when it comes to in-game decisions and adjustments, he just doesn't do well in that aspect as an OC."
minnesotavikings,3borqd,goldenboots,-5,Wed Jul 1 01:40:21 2015 UTC,He was a good OC. Very underrated among Vikings fans.  That's not to say he didn't have his fair share of terrible games (See 2012 playoffs).
minnesotavikings,3borqd,Newport_100s,7,Tue Jun 30 22:56:14 2015 UTC,I feel like 87% of internet football coaches claim they can do the same.
minnesotavikings,3borqd,joey_sandwich277,4,Wed Jul 1 00:31:48 2015 UTC,"That's because people who say that kind of stuff always call really vague plays like ""It's going to be a run up the middle!"" or ""They're going to do a quick slant!"" No shit, there's tons of different ways to run up the middle, and there are a ton of route combinations that include a slant."
minnesotavikings,3borqd,Waffleradio,2,Wed Jul 1 02:23:00 2015 UTC,"Or worse just ""run!"" or ""pass!"" Yeah no shit, you have a 50% chance to be right calling stuff like that. No one tries to predict much more accurately than that. Let me know when someone can predict things like ""RB screen"" ""sluggos"" ""iso"" ""dive"" ""curls"" etc. Not to mention that all those can probably be run in different ways."
minnesotavikings,3borqd,joey_sandwich277,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:57:13 2015 UTC,"Your last sentence pretty sums up my biggest problem with this. The reason you hear things like ""Soandso is going to throw another check down on 3rd and long"" is because these things are side effects of the play failing. Nobody drew up a flare pass as the first option on 3rd and 18, the defense expected the deep pass and all 3 deep routes were covered. Nobody called a run into the center's ass on 3rd and 1, that just happened because the d line beat the guard off the line and the back was looking for a hole elsewhere. People act like failed plays are the same as bad calls, which isn't always the case.  Having said that, I'm not defending Musgrave. He strikes me as the kind of coach who's great at drawing up plays but terrible at calling them at the correct time. But anyone who said they can call all of their OC's plays are either exaggerating or being willfully ignorant."
minnesotavikings,3borqd,Newport_100s,-1,Wed Jul 1 22:46:54 2015 UTC,Handing the ball off to the best back in the league doesn't make you a good OC.

I watched it with my cousin from New Orleans. He was displaced by Katrina, as was most of my family. He was a Saints fan.  Fumble at the one.  The wheels fell off.

minnesotavikings,3boy7g,spokenflow22,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:01:32 2015 UTC,"I get why people say 98' and 09' but we're talking relative strengths. The 1987 Vikes were relatively hugely better than the 87' Broncos.  People forget that the 87 Viking team was only 8-7 because the scab team lost several games during the strike. That team should have been 10-6 or 11-5. That team DESTROYED what was probably the best 49ner team of the 1980's in the second playoff game. And this was in an era when the AFC was a joke, the NFC was utterly dominant. I was rewatching the vike's 87' playoff run on youtube the other day and I just know, deep in my bones, that we would have utterly crushed that 87' Bronco team."

Second best rush D in the league, best pass rush in the league, best kick returner in the league.

minnesotavikings,3btrio,DrCobra1,3,Thu Jul 2 02:10:36 2015 UTC,I stopped asking myself that question years ago.
minnesotavikings,3btrio,adnasium,2,Thu Jul 2 02:22:30 2015 UTC,"To put it simply, Ponder was an all-around poor QB. Both mentally and physically, he could not get the job done. He was a terrific athlete, but in terms of arm strength (which was permanently hampered by an injury in college) and accuracy, he was not physically talented otherwise. And mentally, he was a mess. Needless to say, he just could not handle pressure. He tried to play too perfect. Sort of like how Bridgewater played at the beginning of the season. This need to play perfect meant he had an aversion to take risks. That meant checkdowns, rarely throwing with anticipation (leading to a lot of late throws), and never attempting to fit a ball into a tight window.  People want to criticize Musgrave, but I think Ponder was going to be a poor QB no matter what. He was a projected 2nd/3rd round QB for a reason. And actually, I think Musgrave made Ponder look good. Look at Ponder vs the Packers this year. He was absolutely terrible. He simply did not work in a system liked Norv's. He need a system that was easy and simple. And it made him look a lot better than he actually was. Because trust me, even though Ponder's stats weren't horrible in 2012, he still played horribly. No QB should ever have two 50 yard games in the same season if they were playing the whole game."
minnesotavikings,3btrio,Staple_Overlord,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:48:27 2015 UTC,Yep and 2012 he had Peterson tearing up the turf. With how much 1 on 1 coverage there was on receivers Ponders numbers should have been way better. Put any good QB on that team and there would have been offensive records broke.

Last year Teddy had less yards per attempt throwing to Johnson than he did overall.  IMO I'll consider him competent when that is an even number OR he puts up big TD's or something like that.  I really like Johnson's story and hope he becomes an above average player.  But I do think there is a little too much of a love fest on him.

minnesotavikings,3bjbns,UpperDecker30,26,Mon Jun 29 18:16:42 2015 UTC,"Those defenders looked like shit, so I did some research. The video is bad quality, but it looks like 46 and 47? Team Roster ... Looks like that would be Cullen Loeffler (LS) and Kevin McDermott (LS)? Not to take anything away from Diggs, but I think he just burned the long snappers.  I don't mean to take anything away from Diggs. To be clear: I don't think that's good or bad. I think it's just normal. Diggs should completely outclass those kind of guys in an open field, and he obviously does."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,agnostic_penguin,24,Mon Jun 29 18:42:39 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the guys in white are our long snappers.  Still a cool video though."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,bengalviking,10,Mon Jun 29 18:41:49 2015 UTC,"Was I the only one who was more worried about his hesitation than excited about his ability to cut?  With the pads on, the hesitation (more on the second one than the first) is gonna get him leveled against real defenders.  On the other hand, I suppose having some blockers in front of him might make the outcome different as well. The hesitation might let blockers get a better angle, and create a better running lane for him.  At any rate, I can't wait for the preseason. Should actually be fun to watch this year, with all of the roster depth this team has this year."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,istasber,8,Mon Jun 29 18:33:46 2015 UTC,"I think this was a specific 2 vs 1 drill where he had to get around them without being touched, so I wouldn't worry too much about that. It's an elusiveness drill."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,Ben_Eide,2,Mon Jun 29 21:59:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's more for the tacklers, actually. They're just supposed to corral the guy. The runners ""can't get in trouble"" as McKinnon says in his mic'd up clip. They're just supposed to make it hard for the special teams tacklers."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,ull90,3,Tue Jun 30 02:22:23 2015 UTC,"Guys, this is a drill for the tacklers. Diggs is supposed to try to get away and make it hard for them. Regardless of the fact that these are long snappers, that was pretty well contained and it's pretty remarkable that he got out of there. That likely doesn't happen with, say, Sherels and Thielen coming at him, but that's not really the point."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,ull90,16,Tue Jun 30 02:31:04 2015 UTC,"Fun to watch but he could never pull that off in game action.  Edit: Go ahead and downvote me. He's juking two long snappers and dancing around in a way that could never work against a defender trying knock his block off. If you think he can do that in game, go ahead and comment. Otherwise you're just being a dick."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,youvebeengreggd,11,Mon Jun 29 19:18:03 2015 UTC,Also this
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,Ben_Eide,10,Mon Jun 29 19:29:36 2015 UTC,A lot of defenders here
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,SirDiego,2,Mon Jun 29 19:30:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's the point though. It appears that this is a drill to work on elusiveness and change of direction. Just because this isn't going to happen in a game doesn't mean it isn't impressive. Sure he won't get in 5 jukes while staying in place, but he could certainly fuck up a few ankles with 1 or 2 changes of direction on a return."

minnesotavikings,3bjbns,MyDadBonedYourMom,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"It's so hard for me to judge college athletes. I mean, yeah, you can tell he's quick, but also in the majority of those highlights the defenders are hilariously bad. Like, just piss poor coverage, terrible tackling form, hell in one of them his blocker bowled over two guys because they tripped on each other. Aside from a few good contested jump catches, it's hard for me to see any of these plays directly translating to the NFL.   Not to say I'm down on Diggs, I think he can be really good, but this video doesn't really seem to prove all that much other than there's a reason why he was drafted."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,MyDadBonedYourMom,3,Tue Jun 30 21:01:13 2015 UTC,Yay for college highlights. Good thing this guy turned out to be the GOAT of stone hands.
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,Ben_Eide,7,Mon Jun 29 19:30:59 2015 UTC,Good comparison....
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,jgweiss,6,Mon Jun 29 19:34:02 2015 UTC,"The point is that highlights, by definition, are designed to show the best of a player, which isn't accurate of a player, just what they can do at their absolute best. There are a ton of players that never made it in the NFL that have killer highlight reels from college. See: Troy ""How do I catch the ball"" Williamson."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,hail_termite_queen,9,Mon Jun 29 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"I get that, but that wasn't the point. He said that Diggs couldn't do that in an actual game, but this video has clips that show that he can."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,youvebeengreggd,-2,Mon Jun 29 20:02:56 2015 UTC,"Video clips of him doing it in college, where the vast majority of players don't have NFL level talent, or speed. He isn't in college anymore.   I'm not saying he's going to be awful, but this is far from proof that he can do it in the NFL."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,Independentthought0,3,Mon Jun 29 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"Again, you are missing the point. He said ""in game"", not ""in the NFL""."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,youvebeengreggd,4,Mon Jun 29 20:55:25 2015 UTC,"Did you go back and read it? Doesn't matter what sub we are in. ""In game"" isn't ""in the NFL"" especially when discussing a rookie."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,dolphinflip,0,Mon Jun 29 20:59:38 2015 UTC,"No, it's not proof he can do it in the NFL, but guess what. That proof doesn't exist until he has actually played in the NFL, so this is the best evidence we have to judge him by."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,legendoflink3,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:01:38 2015 UTC,"i promise, watching him week in, week out.....he may not be able to stop on a dime and juke two defenders out of their shoes while barely moving, but the highlights are not just cherry picked. He can ball, plain and simple, and the moves you saw are his signature moves."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,legendoflink3,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the Diggs one is a whole lot more impressive than Williamson's. He's juking the entire team, and Williamson sometimes has one juke. Half of Williamson's is just footage of his face...it's amazing he was drafted so high, pretty much based on his 40 time. He doesn't even look that fast in game."

minnesotavikings,3bjbns,legendoflink3,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:34:15 2015 UTC,"I think your right, I've been watching all the camp videos, I think this kid has that special knack. His routes are really good, reminds me a lot off (dare I say it) Jerry Rice. Don't forget he had a crappy QB at Maryland , the Turners have known him since he was 15. I'm gonna guess they see something in him."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,nomaam05,0,Mon Jun 29 19:35:34 2015 UTC,That's some Sanders type shit right there.
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,Weegemonster5000,2,Tue Jun 30 06:49:18 2015 UTC,"This is a drill they practice. Those two were long snappers not going 100%. They're just suppose to go fast enough to make diggs move. It's a punt return practice. You know, when gunners are in your face and you have to dance around."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,Ben_Eide,4,Mon Jun 29 19:41:50 2015 UTC,Atleast you know that 1 on 1 he's gonna be trouble for the opposing defense.
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,nomaam05,2,Tue Jun 30 07:24:20 2015 UTC,No because all of his highlights suggest it. Not just this one.
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,Ben_Eide,2,Mon Jun 29 18:43:51 2015 UTC,He was drafted in the 5th round. Tom brady was drafted in the 6th. What's your point?
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,nomaam05,3,Mon Jun 29 19:22:36 2015 UTC,Doesn't mean he isn't either. Even if the odds are slim. No point in trying to stop someone from having hopes in their own eye spotting talent. Keep that shit to yourself.
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,Ben_Eide,3,Mon Jun 29 20:12:48 2015 UTC,I sure hope you come back. Especially because diggs was the 2nd best coming out of high school only to DGB who is a freakishly tall athlete who didn't have as much skills as diggs. And that the only reason he stayed in maryland and had not gone to a more recognized school was to be close to his family. That 1% chance doesn't sound right to me. Especially when Norv himself wanted him and has been praising him.
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,Maint_Man13,2,Mon Jun 29 20:22:37 2015 UTC,"I mean, the kid has a chance for sure, but high school recruit rankings are probably the worst argument you could make, TBH."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,penberkins,0,Mon Jun 29 20:47:39 2015 UTC,And we couldn't get our QB situation together after Danny took off to Wisconsin. Had he stuck around Diggs may have gotten more positive press. At one point our backup middle backer was our starting quarterback. I hope people recognize that. You combine that with a crappy injury history in a draft full of WR talent and Diggs becomes a 5th round pick. Keep him healthy and he will be an X factor in this league.
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,SnackbackBackpack,3,Mon Jun 29 20:52:32 2015 UTC,"Everyone saying, ""He can't do that in a game,"" or, ""if this was real there would be tons of other defenders collapsing,"" that is not the point of this video. This appears to be a drill working on elusiveness. It doesn't matter who was defending or whether or not it emulated a real, game-time scenario. The point is, look what he can do. Look at his change of direction and his athleticism. 2 guys who have nothing to do but bear down on a guy 5 yards away and he burns them. He is going to be a monster on returns and he clearly has natural running ability that might even rival CP84's. It's a drill, so please just chill and enjoy what little offseason highlights we're going to get right now."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,PKS_5,3,Mon Jun 29 20:55:59 2015 UTC,"2 guys who have nothing to do but bear down on a guy 5 yards away and he burns them.   Seriously? How do the people defending him not matter, if it's all about him burning them? He's not out there against corners that are fast, and spend their practices covering and tackling. He's burning long snappers, who spend their practices hiking a ball really far, and standing there.   Do you honestly think that any WR wouldn't look much, much better with longsnappers trying to stop him?  I get that people are excited about this kid, but he was being defended by longsnappers, and that is absolutely a factor into how he looked. Put Smith and Rhodes against him instead, and if he does even half as well as he did in the video, we can talk about how great he is."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,Jarl_Bridgewater,0,Mon Jun 29 20:58:17 2015 UTC,"Do you honestly think that any WR wouldn't look much, much better with longsnappers trying to stop him.   No, I don't, cause that's crazy. Stop trying to put words in my mouth and make me look dumb. It's not that he avoided them that's impressive, its how. He sells his jukes well and breaks out of them very quickly. It would be a useless drill if you had two corners with equal speed standing that close to him and blowing a whistle. The long snappers might as well be 2 giant orange cones moving in on him. The only difference is they have anticipation and can close gaps or bite on jukes."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,dis_what_I_say,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:07:18 2015 UTC,"A lot of players sell cuts far better than that every year in the combine against cones. Doing it against slow moving cones doesn't make it any more impressive, imo. He stutter steps like that against a good corner or safety, and he's going to get obliterated."
minnesotavikings,3bjbns,Newport_100s,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:35:10 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Maybe you're just thinking too much about the cones and not enough about the athlete. Maybe I'm just overselling it because it's the off season, and I think Diggs is going to flash."

The NFC West has taken a bit of a blow, but the Seahawks are elite and the Rams and Cardinals shouldn't be overlooked (and who knows, the 49ers will probably suck, but you never know with a new coaching staff). The NFC South was a dumpster fire last year, but the Panthers and Saints still have potential to be good and who knows maybe Winston is magical or something. And that's not even to mention we have to get through either the Packers and Lions (for divisional title), or at least one of the two.

minnesotavikings,3bjphi,greenbaseball,10,Mon Jun 29 19:53:52 2015 UTC,Looks like the flash out there compared to Greenway fwiw.
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,PKS_5,5,Mon Jun 29 20:02:40 2015 UTC,Maybe that's how they ranked him above Barr. They just compared him to Ole Chad.
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,nomaam05,5,Mon Jun 29 20:28:13 2015 UTC,"Fuck it. This Hodges post I've been working on is getting done by the end of the week. He's not the 11th best OLB in football, not even for a 43. He had, what, 5 maybe 6 starts and they're putting him that high? That's like calling teddy the best QB in football because pff rated him that high over the final 5 games."
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,ull90,2,Tue Jun 30 00:42:36 2015 UTC,I know some writers are such slaves to PFF grades which I think are very arbitrary. Like they had Mack #1 for this list and Donald 1 for DT. Those two are great rookies but they are not the best at their positions

I, along with many people on this post think calling him the 11th best 4-3 OLB is a stretch, but give him a shot. Also don't sleep on my boy Mike Mauti."
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,chungwildnfree,2,Tue Jun 30 01:13:57 2015 UTC,"Wow, he's almost as high on this list as the author was on...something!"
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,noseonarug17,0,Tue Jun 30 05:16:34 2015 UTC,Also he is rated above barr which is surprising
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,Killer_Whale_Penguin,0,Mon Jun 29 20:04:46 2015 UTC,Of outside linebackers in a 4-3 scheme? That is not exactly a small group of players.
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,spokenflow22,3,Mon Jun 29 20:12:14 2015 UTC,"11 of 40 ain't bad if you ask me. I agree with you on the Barr thing, though."
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,Killer_Whale_Penguin,0,Mon Jun 29 20:07:45 2015 UTC,"If you actually read the article it is based solely off of last years performances, and is written by a draft scout. He is deserving to be a starter, and PFF tells a similar story of his abilities as a OLB. While it may be a smaller group of players, being near the top is good."
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,Killer_Whale_Penguin,0,Mon Jun 29 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"As of right now he has prove himself in camp to start because he started due to injuries last season. I personally don't believe greenway should start, but what Matt Miller is saying in the article is that based off of Hodges Play last year alone, he was the 11th best. I fully expect Hodges to beat out greenway as the starter before the season begins. Barr was so low due to his missed tackles and injury, but the writer even said he could be top 10 this year."
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,ull90,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:47:39 2015 UTC,"Hodges doesn't even know what he's doing on the field. He's not as good as pff is saying. And you can't be the 11th best LB in football if you only started in like 5? 6 games? He sees the ball and runs to get the ball. That leaves him out of position for cutbacks, reverses, and play action passes. That's why he's not going to start over Greenway this year. There's a good Wobcast with Ben Leber breaking down the linebackers (posted a week or two ago). His perception of Hodges agrees with mine."
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,sand0789,0,Mon Jun 29 20:28:59 2015 UTC,"It's based on his limited tape from last year.  The Vikings are obviously not as high on Hodges than this scout.  The scout also has no way to know the intricacies of their defense and what he was expected to do.  He's just calling it like he sees it and trying to ignore a guy's reputation.    I like this kind of stuff.  I don't necessarily think Hodges is the 11th best OLB in the league, but I like that this scout was willing to call it like he sees it.  Most places just go by reputation."
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,sand0789,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:32:54 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know.  I think that everyone is biased to think Barr had the better season because that is his reputation.  Top dawg first rounder day one starter.  I mean, he simply MUST be better than Hodges.    But this scout is asserting that the missed tackles and spotty coverage of Barr outweighed his 4 sacks and splash plays.  Alternatively, he says that Hodges doesn't rush the Qb or do the big things but was so solid tackling and in coverage that he saw him as better.  I agree with the content of what the Scout said.  I don't necessarily know if I agree with the ranking.  But I can't disagree with the words themselves.  Seemed pretty spot on.  PFF also says Hodges was better.  In fact, this isnt' the first guy to say Hodges is super under rated.  We hear the same stuff about Blanton.    The Vikigns obviously don't agree iwth it all though."
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,HakunaMatata023,0,Mon Jun 29 20:40:58 2015 UTC,That is the article but I'm on mobile right now and can't fix the link.
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,HakunaMatata023,0,Tue Jun 30 00:40:19 2015 UTC,"He was better then almost 3/4th the players at his position, ya I think most would say that's pretty good. Of course Barr is lower but has more upside he missed a good amount of games last year, had he stayed healthy he would probably be top 10 already and most would assume that he'll get their by seasons end if he stays healthy. Hodges made huge improvements from his first year into his second and I'd expect for him to grow even more but even so Greenway is the vet and has been one of the leaders of this team and while he's not what he once was he still brings some value to the team. Should Hodges start over Greenway, probably and most likely will at some point if he keeps improving but Zimmer likes Greenway he praises him a lot and I'd expect he'll still get reps with this team even if he is outplayed. It sure wouldn't be the first time an aging regressed vet has started over a younger player with some more promise, we have a young team so that vet presence is a must. I've seen a couple articles though that think Hodges will have a break out year or will be sneaky good, he's better then some give him credit for."
minnesotavikings,3bjphi,HakunaMatata023,0,Mon Jun 29 22:33:33 2015 UTC,"It's not some random guy ranking players that he thought played good they do this kind of stuff for a living and use statistics and research, it's not just one guy I've seen Hosges mentioned a few times as one of the better OLB's this year as well as some that have him as a dark horse. Hodges played well last year and is underrated a lot like Blanton. Hodges was much better then you think as the stats and rankings tell."

I couldn't pass on these tickets the account iwas my buddies grandma and she has held tickets since the mid eighties.

He will have improved over summer and now with AP in the backfield his manufactured touches will come back.  Around round 10 when the talent starts to get thin he will be a player that could have a huge return for little investment.

minnesotavikings,3bchfm,All_Day88,7,Sun Jun 28 04:12:34 2015 UTC,As much as I think ap is still good I think a lot of people here are going to be real surprised when he declines. Nobody thought LT would every run out of gas with the chargers either. Father time is a real asshole and when you lose a step or two that 70 yard td can quickly turn into a short gain instead.   I think ap will still be great but people need to temper their expectations when I see people thinking he's going to be running for 2000 yards or something.

minnesotavikings,3bchfm,jjspaceman,2,Sun Jun 28 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"That's because he lost Hutch.  Also, I don't doubt that people will be ""surprised"" when someone declines with age.   The expectations associated with AD are based on reality. Really. The fact that he had a year off, so he's fresh. Combined with what his surgeon said about his leg, after his surgery (basically that he looked like a newborn baby, damage wise (outside of the exploded tendons)), his healing factor, and the fact that he is an angry runner with a lot of anger built up...   Other than that. I do think that AD is an exception. Most people accept that runners/most players decline after 30. Mas o Menos."

I think they want a pissed off Adrian, chip on his shoulder/point to prove, behind an OL with two absolute maulers in the run game on the right side.  Sounds like Adrian's carries per game are going to decrease a bit, but I wouldn't be surprised if he has a stellar season with a really high YPC - and does it running ANGRY"

Best running backs of all time, in no particular order (my opinion).  I've listed these guys along with the age at which they hit their wall, and number of carries:  Barry Sanders: Retired at age 30 and had not shown the slightest sign of slowing down.  3500+ combined rushing yards at age 29 and 30.  3062 career attempts at that point.  Emmit Smith: His decline was very gradual.  Started at age 32 and he retired at age 36.  Decline started after about 3600 carries.  But he still put up almost 1000 yards at age 36, so he never truly ""hit a wall"".    Walter Payton: Sweetness.  Decline started at age 32 but he really hit a wall at age 33.  3300 carries before he even showed a sign of slowing down though.  Jim Brown: Never hit a wall.  Retired on top of his game at age 29 with 2350 carries.  Not much to learn there.  Could have played quite a few more years probably.  Adrian Peterson: No statistical sign of slowing down.  Age 30 with 2000 carries.  He's over 1000 carries short of when any other all time great had ever shown even a sign of slowing down.  I mean, for all time greats, you can only find guys that showed a kink in their armor as early as 32 years old, with many more carries than AP will have by then.    If we just focus on the greats, Peterson is probably 2-3 years from showing any sign of slowing down."

minnesotavikings,3bbtve,naphini,2,Sat Jun 27 19:10:58 2015 UTC,"Let me think through this for a minute:  Tarkenton was a great QB, but he'd be lucky to crack a top ten all time list; maybe he makes the back end of one at best. That sets us back a bit, given that QB is the most important position, and some of the names ahead of him played for multiple teams.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I can only think of 3 Vikings players that can legitimately claim to contend for the best ever at their position: Page, McDaniel, and (controversially) Moss. Peterson may have an argument when his career is over. Actually, I forgot about Paul Krause; it might not be ludicrous to call him the GOAT safety. So that's 2 for sure, and as many as 5 if we're being very generous with  ourselves. There was a thread in /r/nfl recently asking this question of every team, and it seems most teams only have one or two names to put up. I guess we're looking pretty good there.  It would be tough to really figure this out without having a roster for every team to look at. I know there have been threads about that, but I don't have time to take it that far at the moment. Initially, I thought you were being too optimistic, but I could be convinced. We do have some weak spots, though."
minnesotavikings,3bbtve,sand0789,2,Sun Jun 28 04:45:18 2015 UTC,"Tarkenton is in a tough spot becuase everyone considers the recent QB's to basically all be better than the older ones.  But ol' Fran did finish his career with the most passing yards AND rushing yards ever by a QB, and both were by pretty huge margins.    It was a different Era.  It was harder to pass.  Different rules.  But every other QB played by those rules and Fran outdid them all hugely.    Peyton Manning will break the passing yardage record this year.  Now imagine if he had 20% MORE yards than he actually has.  Now imagine if he also had, in addition to everything else, more rushing yards by far than any other QB in history.    I tend to think that if Fran played today he would be really good."

minnesotavikings,3b9f5v,All_Day88,4,Sat Jun 27 05:48:18 2015 UTC,"The thing about baseball is that you enjoy it in a different way. When you watch a game, you don't watch every moment like a football game. It's a casual experience, whether on TV or live.   Unless it's the playoffs, or an important late season game, if you're at the game you go to your seats for a couple of innings, bullshit with the folks around you, and then get up and stroll around the stadium.  Check out sight lines, sample some food, maybe run into someone you know and chat it up, etc., then go back to your seats for a bit, or find an empty seat elsewhere and enjoy the view from there. I'm not saying you're not paying attention to the game, it's just casual man.   In addition, baseball is a game of personalities. The more you get to know players, the more fun it is.  The guys in the field are constantly chatting up each other or goofing around, and the commentators, on TV and radio, are a much bigger part of the baseball experience than any other sport.

minnesotavikings,3b9i50,rhadamanthus52,5,Sat Jun 27 02:06:12 2015 UTC,Howdy neighbors! This got posted in the Packers sub and I thought you guys would enjoy it as well. Great in depth Xs and Os review of a handful of plays with commentary on players and strategy from both sides of the ball. Enjoy!
minnesotavikings,3b9i50,Ajax_Malone,2,Sat Jun 27 02:08:01 2015 UTC,Thanks man. I did enjoy that.
minnesotavikings,3b9i50,armetheus,5,Mon Jun 29 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"At first this guys voice seemed like it would annoy me after 12 minutes, but by the end I just wanted to hear that entire game be analyzed by him.  Good stuff."
minnesotavikings,3b9i50,andejo16,2,Sat Jun 27 08:48:54 2015 UTC,I was honestly thinking the same thing. So nasally...12 minutes later...so monotonously beautiful.
minnesotavikings,3b9i50,pingpongguy,4,Sat Jun 27 16:45:36 2015 UTC,Very nice analysis.  Griffen and Rhodes were both great on this drive.
minnesotavikings,3b9i50,naphini,3,Sat Jun 27 03:08:42 2015 UTC,"Yep! Rhodes's ability able to single-cover Adams stood out as the cornerstone of the entire scheme. Adams may not be a #1 WR yet, but he's got a very high ceiling and shredded several teams that tried to man him this year (NE, DAL, MIA). He is dangerous when underestimated, so shutting him down like this and opening up the other side of the field for help is not as easy as it might sound in theory.  I was also really impressed by Griffen (I think?, RDE) single-highhandedly wrecking the counter by getting across Bahktiari's face. It is no secret Bahktiari struggles big time in the run game, but given his favorable positioning he should have been capable of at least delaying most players. However Griffen showed why he's more valuable than most non-Vikings fans probably realize by completely dominating on this play, and effectively forcing a favorable 3rd down that led to the drive stop."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,istasber,20,Fri Jun 26 14:43:29 2015 UTC,"The relevant part starts at around 16:50.  Paul Allen's argument is basically:   He's ""deceptively fast"" He might not be the best at anything, but he's a versatile backup He's good on special teams Coaches and assistants are constantly praising both his work ethic, and how much he's improving/impressing He's looked good in his limited time filling in for other players   Basically it sounds like he fits the mold of good depth. Good for now as a backup and utility player, but hasn't clearly hit a ceiling or plateau in terms of growth so he could figure to play a bigger role in the future.  A lot of people seem to think he's a long shot to make the roster, and I'll admit I go back and forth (especially after seeing how good Diggs seems to have been in OTAs), but sometimes you gotta remind yourself that it really doesn't matter where a guy's at now or who's ahead of him on the depth chart, it matters what kind of value he can bring to the team now, and whether or not that value is increasing."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,SirDiego,14,Fri Jun 26 14:53:36 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why everyone's obsessing over Diggs. I get that he's fast and he's been looking good in practice, but he's still a low-round pick that has yet to play a snap in an NFL game.   Thielen has experience and is really good on special teams and has done fine as a backup WR. Why are people assuming he's getting replaced by a rookie before training camp is even started, let alone preseason and regular season?"
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Mook7,10,Fri Jun 26 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the Diggs hype comes from people thinking that he's more talented than his draft position would have let on. I hadn't heard of him before the draft but Maryland fans had nothing but high praise for him, claiming that he would have been recognized as an amazing player if not for the chain of lackluster QB's he had throwing to him in college. Personally, I'm hoping we can keep both because I trust Norv to utilize everyone well, but the arm chair GM in me feels Diggs has more potential if we can only keep one.  Edit: Also, watching the videos the Vikings have been posting from OTA's and minicamp, you definitely see a lot more Diggs than Thielen. This might be intentional, I know new draftees bring more hype than returning back ups, but it could still explain a little why people are assuming Thielen's spot on the roster will be very tough to earn."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Dorkamundo,9,Fri Jun 26 17:57:13 2015 UTC,he would have been recognized as an amazing player if not for the chain of lackluster QB's he had throwing to him in college.   They literally had to play their LB as QB during part of Digg's career.
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,legendoflink3,4,Fri Jun 26 22:27:19 2015 UTC,"Have you seen his college highlights and read his back story?   It's not his speed that makes him great btw. He's just a great WR all around. Great hands, ball tracking and down fields vision.   Nothimg against Thielen. He's also great. I THINK folks here are just more excited for Diggs because he's new and also the ball in his hands could be a TD run all the time."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,SirDiego,4,Fri Jun 26 17:59:08 2015 UTC,"I get that he's a good prospect, but it seems like a lot of people (not just here I've heard analysts too) are putting Diffs ahead of Thielen automatically and we're still a month away from training camp. It's not like Thielen is awful or anything."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Waffleradio,4,Fri Jun 26 18:06:18 2015 UTC,Diffs   I  love Steblon Diffs
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Dorkamundo,4,Fri Jun 26 19:24:43 2015 UTC,"Steglon Diffs, actually."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Dorkamundo,2,Fri Jun 26 22:36:27 2015 UTC,"Well, it's also the fact that when you watch the OTA and Minicamp videos, there are always a few very impressive plays by Diggs in the highlights, along with a bunch of routine catches by Thielen.   Given the fact that we likely will not have the room to carry Sherels just for his PR ability, it gives Diggs another leg up to remain on the roster.   Personally, I do believe it is more likely that Diggs makes the roster than Thielen, despite his hometown love and work ethic. But that doesn't mean that Thielen can't make the roster as well."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,legendoflink3,2,Fri Jun 26 22:32:32 2015 UTC,Nope. Thielen is good. Infact I want to see him play more last year. And I for one hope he's on the roster this year.   If Patterson wasn't a 1st rounder all this talk would be a bit different. It does suck that we might not be able to carry all those guys but it's a good thing we have that depth.   What about Jarius. Are any of these guys an improvement over him?
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,SirDiego,3,Fri Jun 26 18:12:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say it goes Wallace-Johnson-Wright or Johnson-Wallace-Wright for the first three. Then, Patterson as a rotation/backup, but on a very short leash with some gadget plays. Then Thielen as backup and special teamer. Diggs is a developmental player and backup to all those guys as far as I'm concerned until at least the preseason. It's not that I don't believe he can be good, but I don't see him passing any of those guys yet until we've seen him take some snaps in the pros.   And I think we can carry all of those guys considering Thielen and Patterson both have roles on special teams as well."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,legendoflink3,3,Fri Jun 26 18:20:39 2015 UTC,Yeah. Preseason is gonna make or break certain players. I think that order is correct and will play into the season unless something significant happens.
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,sand0789,3,Fri Jun 26 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"I think Jarius is way underrated. I doubt Thielen or Diggs jumps him on the depth chart this season.  On the other hand, Jarius is a guy who's in a contract year and we know pretty much what we've got in him. Diggs or Thielen could save us from overpaying him. What overpaying means will depend on how Wright does this year, but still... Diggs and Thielen are both dirt cheap by comparison to what Wright will get paid even if he doesn't take a further step forward."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Ben_Eide,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:11:26 2015 UTC,"We have a tendency, as fans, to assume the best case scenario from unknowns.  Diggs is unknown.  He's a rookie, and WR is one of the most difficult positions to predict at the NFL level, outside of quarterback and maybe cornerback.    But it is hard not to see Diggs as having a higher ceiling.  I mean, can you find a player in NFL history who despite being healthy his first two season only amassed 137 receiving yards, then went on to be a stud WR?  That is where Theilan is at.  And many of his yards came on a blown coverage deep bomb."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Ben_Eide,5,Mon Jun 29 22:42:21 2015 UTC,"Because Diggs is a guy with a lot of potential. He is athletic and has great hands. He is young and only has room to grow. Thielen has pretty much hit his ceiling in my opinion. Sure, he is fine to throw in once in a while, but if your WR core is to the point it needs to rely on an Adam Thielen on a consistent basis, your WR core is in trouble. Diggs has the potential to be better than Thielen in every way, and he will get a chance to prove that. The fact that Diggs hasn't played a snap is good for his prospects because he is an unknown who could turn into a game changer. Thielen in known, and from what we've seen he is meh. Made some great special teams plays, but he isn't anyone I would be comfortable relying on."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Ben_Eide,3,Fri Jun 26 22:42:04 2015 UTC,"See, this is the attitude I don't get.  He's a walk-on that gets a contract in rookie minicamp in 2013, but can't break into the lineup and winds up on the practice squad. Coaches and media rave about how improved he is in the 2014 offseason, and he makes the roster as Patterson's backup at X and sherels backup at punt returner. He's really good on special teams, but Charles Johnson leapfrogs both him and Patterson on the X depth chart, so he gets limited playing time. He's solid in what little playing time he gets, though, getting 8 receptions for 137 yards and a TD. That might not seem like a lot, but in a year where the top two starting receivers only had like 1200 yards between them, that's nothing to scoff at.  Norv comments at the end of the year how Adam Thielen figures to be in the mix as a slot reciever after Jennings is released, and that he improved as much as anyone else on the offense over the course of the season.  Thielen comes out and has a strong OTA/minicamp showing, coaches again say he's improved and impressing.  I just don't get why people are so quick to give up on someone that's actually been GOOD in his limited showing so far, and by all accounts, keeps getting better. It's like... imagine if the Packers gave up on Nelson after 4 years, despite the fact that he wasn't really a factor in that time."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Ben_Eide,3,Sat Jun 27 00:20:14 2015 UTC,"I just tend not to read so deeply into what the coaches say about players when it is solicited. If a coach goes out of his way to praise a guy, then by all means buy into that. But Norv was asked about Thielen at a time when we knew we were losing Jennings. It was post season, with only 4 WR's to speak of. Norv is not going to just cut the guy's legs out from under him. He's going to say, ""Adam has been impressive. He's been working hard and improving and we will give him an opportunity to compete."" It is a cookie cutter response. Thielen has been good in very limited showings, but its dangerous to look at that 8 for 137 line and extrapolate it into anything meaningful. It is almost certain his average will drop as he catches more balls and is in the mix more. I'm not giving up on Thielen, but I was never a believer in the first place. He was always a bubble guy in my mind and his showing last year did not change that. Good on special teams (though even this is being overblown by people due to 2 or 3 fluky, lucky, but very good plays on his part) and ok as a WR.  I think Diggs can step in immediately and do what Thielen did on special teams, and as a WR I think he has a much higher ceiling. He was picked by our current coaching staff and has earned quite a bit of praise himself (again not reading too much into that because praise is all you're going to hear in the off-season). I see a clearer path to playing time for Diggs and would put pretty high stakes on that."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Ben_Eide,3,Sat Jun 27 00:45:03 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but the thing about Norv's comments is that he wasn't asked about thielen. I think the question was something like ""With Jennings gone, does that mean Wright is the slot receiver, or are you going to need to look to the draft?""  That's when Norv said that Thielen and Wright both took snaps there, and Thielen was as improved as anyone. I'll try to find the interview again to give you a more exact quote than that. That's also when I figured maybe the guy was more than just a feel-good hometown success story."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,MatticInYoAttic,2,Sat Jun 27 00:52:23 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, maybe I'm thinking of a different presser then. I know Norv has been specifically asked about Thielen a number of times so I may have done some transference in my brain."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,sand0789,2,Sat Jun 27 00:54:15 2015 UTC,"I should also point out (in case you didn't see me say it previously) I firmly believe we are going into the season with 6 WR's and that the 5/6 will be between Thielen and Diggs. I just think Diggs is going to be the better WR. Thielen could make more of an overall team impact, but just for WR depth I think Digss will be more of a value."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,spacezookeeper,2,Sat Jun 27 00:57:54 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I don't think anyone arguing that Thielen will make the roster is arguing that we'll only keep 5. Regardless of whatever value Thielen has, it's really tough to argue that we wouldn't keep any of the other 5.  Here's a link to my post about the Norv interview, if you were curious  edit: If you listen to the interview, start around 12:15 or so. I was wrong, Norv does mention thielen unprovoked as a possibility as a slot guy, but his glowing praise of Thielen was in response to a followup question specifically about thielen from PA."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,sand0789,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:05:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, if you look further down in the thread, there are a few people doing just that. Haha. Also, thanks for the time stamp. I know I've listened to this interview (I've swallowed up every bit of media the Vikings churn out in the off season) but it will be good to go back to."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,sand0789,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:09:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was actually fun to relisten to part of the interview, and reflect on it now that the draft and OTAs have come and gone. I was actually surprised just how glowing the praise of thielen was, though. I remembered the ""improved as much as anyone"" part, but all of the other stuff kind of faded away."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,jjspaceman,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:24:07 2015 UTC,"I think if Diggs went to an FSU/OSU, just overall powerhouse, he would've been a first rounder..especially in this draft, it seemed like WRs were over-valued. Either way, I like the pick, the only guarantee I can make is that he'll be better than Troy Williamson."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,ull90,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:43:05 2015 UTC,"Diggs was a top prospect out of high school, and was a total stud in the NCAA.  He wasn't drafted until the 4th primarily because he's been injured a lot."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,chucktestlacoil,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:27:56 2015 UTC,"What I would do is trade Patterson away for a 4th rounder while he still has that much value. Diggs is Patterson light, as far as physical ability goes, but if Diggs is better in the mental part of the game, then he'll be a better receiver. That, and Jarius Wright was getting a few plays that I imagine were drawn up with Patterson in mind. Wright took two balls from the line of scrimmage 60+ yards last year, in the Atlanta game, and in the Jets game."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,dolphinflip,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:30:52 2015 UTC,"Why not trade Wright?  Wright is a FA after this season, and Diggs plays the same position.  Honestly I don't think the Vikings are high enough on Wright to give him the $4 million or so he'll command on the market."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,paperllamasunited,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:27:16 2015 UTC,"He was a 4th rounder.  The Vikings aren't going to select a guy in the 4th round, have him show up and practice as good as advertised, then cut him."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,SirDiego,0,Mon Jun 29 22:26:20 2015 UTC,I don't understand why everyone's obsessing over <insert player name here>   Because off-season.
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Ben_Eide,2,Fri Jun 26 22:11:16 2015 UTC,"I think he's actually a very good player, even at wide receiver. I wouldn't say he's a cinch to make it like Paul Allen, but I think he most likely will. I think we'll keep 6 receivers unless something weird happens."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,SirDiego,9,Fri Jun 26 18:56:09 2015 UTC,Players like Thielen should never be a cinch at this time of the year.
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Ben_Eide,2,Fri Jun 26 17:41:51 2015 UTC,"I think saying someone is a cinch to make the roster at this time of the year is like saying the spot is his to lose in camp. Which is perfectly fine to say about anyone who's earned it, even players like Thielen (whatever that means), and PA thinks he's earned it."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Dorkamundo,6,Fri Jun 26 19:04:03 2015 UTC,"It's just going to be hard keeping Wallace, Johnson, Wright, Patterson, Diggs, and Thielen without losing depth elsewhere. When they get to the final spots with the roster I think Thielen will squeeze in. I think he will have to show his value outside of being a gunner this year otherwise he will be on the fringe again."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,sand0789,3,Fri Jun 26 15:29:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that hard to make room for him, especially if the praise from norv and the receivers coach is legitimate, without any expectation that he needs to contribute big outside of being a gunner/blocker for special teams this year. When you get down that deep into the roster, you're not only looking for guys who can help you now, but who put you in a better position later."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,VikesRule,2,Fri Jun 26 17:29:28 2015 UTC,"QB: 2? 3? Depending how that Undrafted kid does.  RB: 3 or 4 depending if we keep Zach Line or not?  WR: 5 or 6?  TE: 3 or 4?  OL: 8-10?  K, P, LS: 3  DE: 4  DT: 4  ILB: 2  OLB : 4  CB: 5  S: 4  Using those maximums, it's 53 players. Unless we need an extra linebacker, or lineman on either side, carrying 6 WRs would be fine for the overall depth."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Waffleradio,2,Sat Jun 27 22:24:04 2015 UTC,I don't think Diggs beats out Thielen just yet unless he does really really well in preseason or something. Thielen has experience and is a good special teamer and made an OK backup WR. Diggs hasn't played a single snap in the NFL yet.
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,bengalviking,2,Fri Jun 26 17:39:32 2015 UTC,"Thielen made an OK backup WR. That is why. He is only OK at his primary position, not anything more. Diggs has a much much higher ceiling than Thielen, and he is a rookie. If we only keep 5 WR's, (I firmly believe we will hold 6) I think Thielen is the guy on the bubble because we know what he is, and that is replacement level."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Waffleradio,4,Fri Jun 26 22:46:41 2015 UTC,"Except Thielen is a good special teams guy as well and Diggs is a rookie fifth rounder and training camp hasn't even started yet. I'm not saying Diggs can't beat out Thielen this season or even in preseason but people are acting like Diggs is ""automatic"" and I just think it's way too early to say that."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,SkoalVikings,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:03:00 2015 UTC,"I've already conceded that Thielen was good on special teams, but I also think people think he is better on ST than he is due to 3 fortunate fluky plays last year. Keep in mind Thielen barely made the roster last year, and we have better depth this year. I agree it isn't automatic, but my money is on Diggs being WR 5 regardless."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,SkoalVikings,0,Sat Jun 27 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"Right, but he does have return abilities and we are looking to likely replace Sherels if possible, as we have too much talent at CB to keep a guy like him on just for his PR skills.   Diggs not only can return punts, but he also plays a position where we need some help."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,JohnathanTheBrave,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:34:35 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that Theilan is a cinch.  If the Vikings again keep 5 wide receivers, then they have to cut either Diggs, Theilen, Johnson, Wright, or Patterson.  That's a really difficult decision.    If someone gets injured, the decision becomes much easier.  Not uncommon to lose one of 6 WR's by the team preseason is over.  But if everyone is healthy, they have to keep 6 or cut a promising player."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,nomaam05,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:25:30 2015 UTC,"I doubt he makes it. I like him as a player but I don't see us keeping more than 5 receivers and he's pretty much the #6 at this point, with how well Diggs is looking so far and since we're not gonna give up on Patterson so quickly."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,JohnathanTheBrave,4,Fri Jun 26 16:45:04 2015 UTC,"Why not 6 WR? I think 6 is a possibility. Not a given, but it's well within the realm of possibility. Especially with the sort of FB/TE role we have guys like Ellison in (meaning we don't need roster spots dedicated to a fullback)."

minnesotavikings,3b74rs,october21st,-1,Sat Jun 27 00:05:43 2015 UTC,"People like him because it's a nice story being a hometown kid, but he has no upside. They wouldn't use the 6th receiver. It would be a waste of a roster space. He's not really that good at anything which makes him expendable."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Dorkamundo,5,Sat Jun 27 00:25:05 2015 UTC,TIL constant improvement and a good work ethic = no upside.
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Ben_Eide,3,Sat Jun 27 00:31:33 2015 UTC,Seriously? This is a business. Unless you wanna call Thielen a straight up special teamer this conversation is ridiculous. He's never shown anything that would lead you to believe he has the potential to be a top three guy in this league. In my opinion this is his last year to break out otherwise he'll be replaced by a rookie next year just for the sake of the contract.
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,bengalviking,2,Sat Jun 27 01:47:13 2015 UTC,"So any WR that's not going to be a top 3 guy, is going to be cut?   And he very well could be cut by next year, but OP, and the article, are talking about this year."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,Fineyouwin,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:47:52 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what our final roster is going to look like in September. Honestly? The way training camp works out you never know where you're going to need depth, guys get injured, guys don't show up big, etc. When you're talking about ANY position where guys are battling at the bottom of the depth chart I don't really think there's anything close to being a ""cinch"" on the roster, especially in June.     Does Adam have the talent to be on the team this year? Yes, there are probably some teams he'd be an easy number four on. Does that make him head and shoulders above Diggs? I don't know. Could the effects of other positions at training camp effect how many wide receivers we actually carry into the season? Absolutely.     This is not a 100% all or nothing conversation right now and to discuss it as such is disingenuous and foolish."
minnesotavikings,3b74rs,ElqruqpurplE,0,Sat Jun 27 17:20:28 2015 UTC,"Athletic ability is upside and he's not super athletic. He's not great in the open field so you aren't going to run WR screens or reverses to him. He's not the type of guy that can take a short little pass and turn it into a 50 yard TD. He's not a great red zone threat. He's not much of a deep threat. He's doesn't have a real niche or thing he does way better than everyone else to carve a role out for himself in the offense. I don't see the point of keeping him around. It's a cute little hometown story, but he doesn't bring much to the table."

I'd call it about 50/50 right now. You Diggs haters need to wake the fuck up, he's a way better receiver than Thielan and is probably just as good of a special teams player. Thielan is only going to make the roster if we keep 6 receivers or cut Wright, and I'd consider cutting Wright very unlikely."

I also wouldn't be surprised if they have a similar record to us at the end of the season, with about 6-8 wins.  e: wording"
minnesotavikings,3b740k,NUvikesfan,2,Fri Jun 26 14:47:09 2015 UTC,They're an up and coming team?  Edit: holy crap I read this is redskins. I take this back. Yeah they're up and coming ish but I don't believe Carr is the Messiah. And it's not because he didn't look like Andrew luck but it's because 1 season doesn't make a QB. I just need to see more. Same goes for teddy.

minnesotavikings,3b740k,AdrianMVPeterson,-1,Sun Jun 28 20:42:29 2015 UTC,Diggs was a late round pick and we have other weapons at WR. Raiders are going to be relying heavily on Cooper this year.
minnesotavikings,3b740k,Sgt_Slate,3,Sun Jun 28 20:44:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying otherwise......  But in reality, we barely have other weapons at WR. Johnson may or may not keep it up after having a great year coming off a practice squad. Wright is more ""meh"" than Crabtree. Patterson is a joke. Thielen isn't that good, and Diggs is an unknown commodity."
minnesotavikings,3b740k,AdrianMVPeterson,-3,Sun Jun 28 20:46:06 2015 UTC,I think you'd have to provide some evidence that we're on Diggs's nuts anywhere near as much as they are on Cooper's nuts.

That's about it. Otherwise their defense is crap, their offensive weapons depend on a rookie WR, and the RB stable is a big question mark. Their coaching staff is uninspiring, and they still have a GM who has a tendency to make some majorly disastrous free agency moves. There's nothing up and coming about them besides the possibility of Carr not being his brother."

minnesotavikings,3b740k,Jose_xixpac,-4,Sun Jun 28 14:48:16 2015 UTC,I actually misread the prompt. I think they're up and coming but also they're the raiders so what does that even mean.   I like Cooper and the team could be functional after the picks they made this year. Then again they're the raiders.   I'm not sold on Carr but that's because he doesn't have the breadth of work yet. Same goes for Teddy. You can't sell me on a QB after 1 season.
minnesotavikings,3b740k,PKS_5,-3,Fri Jun 26 16:18:55 2015 UTC,They're a young team looking to get better and are up and coming somewhat but not in the same sense as us. I think if some of our guys can take the next step then we're not too far away from being title contenders maybe a couple seasons or even as soon as when we move into our New Stadium but the raiders are still a bit away from that possiblity but ya even though I think will win this game it's definitely not a lock or sure thing.

The only thing your team has that ours doesn't is AP. Everyone says Carr is unproven. By your own standards Bridgewater is unproven, and Carr had a better season than he did. If it wasn't for Favre your team would irrelevant as well."
minnesotavikings,3b740k,WDMChuff,0,Sun Jun 28 12:51:58 2015 UTC,"Carr did not have a better season.  That's silly.    I agree that Bridgewater is still unproven.  But Carr is proven at this point.  There are no QB's in NFL history that have posted 5.46 YPA in a season, even their rookie season, then went on to have success.  I mean, that's a done deal unless something happens that has never happened before.    Vikings do have AP, and without him last year they won 7 games to Oakland's 3.  And Oakland is a young team with pro...oh wait, they are one of the oldest teams in the NFL.  For Oakland to get good, they need a bunch of old players to get a lot better.  Vikings just need their young guys to improve, and Teddy to build on his very impressive rookie season."

Our offensive line is better, our overall WR Corp is better, our runninbacks our better, Barr/Greenway/Kendricks>Mack/Scrub/Scrub, our safety is better and our entire secondary is better. Not to mention our defensive line that includes a top 10 DE and a top 5 DT.   So who am I missing on the Raiders?"
minnesotavikings,3b740k,zer0signal,8,Sun Jun 28 15:49:48 2015 UTC,Since you used the excuse of injury. I'll use the excuse of having the toughest strength of schedule. We were 1st and you were 21st.

minnesotavikings,3b740k,JacobMHS,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:18:40 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, run run pass punt is the offensive equivalent of the cover 2 zone we played under Frazier. Man, Musgrave and Frazier had us playing some vanilla-as-fuck schemes."
minnesotavikings,3b740k,peekay427,2,Fri Jun 26 20:31:59 2015 UTC,Honestly running the Cover 2 as an offense would probably be more effective than Musgrave's scheme.

minnesotavikings,3b740k,JacobMHS,0,Fri Jun 26 16:06:26 2015 UTC,"Man, I started that shit and I am fucking ashamed of it.  But when I saw that Raiders fans posted an article that said Carr had a brighter future than Teddy to /r/NFL, for the sole reason that they were going to go in and downvote the ""butthurt Vikings fans"" that disagreed, was fucking immature. And for that reason (among many others), I hope Teddy Bridgewater ascends to star status and goes 30-36, 450 yards, and 5 touchdowns. /rant  But I don't wish for Carr to bust, I just think he's overrated based on the games I watch this year. He may step up in the pocket occasionally, but he still is scared of rushers. It's why his sack numbers are so low, and his completion percentage and y/a are so low."

minnesotavikings,3b6l37,youvebeengreggd,4,Fri Jun 26 15:50:20 2015 UTC,"I had a really busy (but fun) week so I'm just going to throw it into bullet points by day to try to make it a tad more organized/brief.   Grandma's was super busy, obviously, but it was a blast. Background on that here; short version is that I work at the Caribou in Canal Park so it was crazy. I'd post another picture in my Grandma's outfit but I don't have any really good ones and none that are alone, so meh. I did have a customer ask me to take a picture with her daughter...who was like 20. After Grandma's I went back to the coworkers' house I stayed at and watched Tangled with one of them. Then I went home and slept. Sunday morning I worked again, which was sort of like Grandma's part 2 - based on sales numbers, about half as busy, which is still really busy. So that was exhausting, but eventually it ended. Later that day I went exploring outside Duluth - Stewart Creek, specifically - with a friend. Cool spot. Monday I didn't do much most of the day (that I remember, anyway). Probably played MLB 2k12, as I've been playing that recently. I wish they made The Show for PC. In the evening I went to Two Harbors with that same friend. Here's a picture of me on a rock. I hope you like it because I tore my favorite jeans while climbing it. RIP (get it) Tuesday morning I helped a friend/coworker with her math homework. After that, I went exploring and whatnot with some coworkers. The first hour and a half was with just one of the girls, and then a second joined and we did a bit more exploring before getting ice cream. Then we paused to go to Caribou and give our boss a gift along with a bunch of other coworkers as a thank you for all her hard work for Grandma's (and in general). Then the second girl left and I walked around the lakewalk with the first girl while waiting for my main exploring buddy to get off work so we could all go back to Stewart Creek for additional exploring. Wednesday morning I opened, which was fun in a way. Then I decided to jump in the lake and swim to the icehouse (this thing, minus the pillar in front, which collapsed into the lake in February) with that one friend, who I apparently do everything with now. But we decided to wait for his roommate, who took forever to get there, and by the time he did, a rainstorm had started, which led to a series of hastily made and poorly conceived decisions, which in turn led to my phone falling into the lake in a manner not unlike Saruman's death scene. So that...sucked. Thursday was supposed to be for cleaning, but I just kind of took the day off. With the day off work and no phone to look at when I woke up, I didn't get out of bed until almost 1, and then my replacement phone came in the mail before 1:30 - less than 24 hours after I put in the claim with insurance, which is pretty impressive. I mean, it left Louisville after midnight. That's crazy. Also, I went to Old Chicago with some coworkers last night, and a couple of them refused to believe I was older than them. They carded me. Sigh.... I have work in 34 minutes so I should finish this up. Then I'm doing math help again, and the first of two visiting friends comes in at 6 tonight (the other at 1ish). They'll have to entertain themselves half of Saturday, though, because I work til 4. Then they'll head out Sunday afternoon, in time for me to have a Chinese food/movie night with the first girl from Tuesday's exploring. So that should be fun. Monday I have yet another friend visiting, just for the day and then heading out in the morning.   I guess that's it, because I should get going real soon. I'll leave behind a couple of my favorite homemade silly jokes, though:  Q: Why do artists need coffee in the morning? A: Because otherwise they can't espresso themselves!  Q: What do you call buy one, get one free dentures? A: Toofers!  Q: Did you hear about the guy who wanted to oxygenate his own blood? A: He tried, but it was in vein.  Q: Do you know why dung beetles roll poop? A: It's their doody!  Q: Why is Barbie's boyfriend afraid of commitment? A: Because he's a chic Ken. (This one is my favorite.)"

minnesotavikings,3b6l37,ull90,14,Fri Jun 26 18:01:42 2015 UTC,Gay marriage was just legalized nationwide by the SCOTUS! I can't believe it happened so soon!
minnesotavikings,3b6l37,joey_sandwich277,6,Fri Jun 26 14:29:30 2015 UTC,"I've trying to hammer down what was ruled.  Did they define marriage, or did they just say ""You can't say members of the same gender can't enter into certain kinds of contracts?"" The latter? Great! The former? I'm not OK with that. Marriage, legally, is just a kind of contract. Kind of like collective bargaining rights. So defining marriage is wrong, from a legal perspective."
minnesotavikings,3b6l37,vbullinger,2,Fri Jun 26 14:53:50 2015 UTC,"It's definitely the former.  The majority opinion closed the door pretty hard on anything else (from the summary): ""Since same-sex couples may now exercise the fundamental right to marry in all States..."""
minnesotavikings,3b6l37,3Mattack3,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:58:55 2015 UTC,They didn't define it. They said banning same-sex marriage is unconstitutional under the 14th amendment.

Besides, the Supreme Court is corrupt as all Hell. People act like they're some kind of impartial angels or something. Are you serious?!? These people are appointed by a corrupt-ass president and rubber stamped by Congress in there and vote the way they're told, faking their opinions along the way."

minnesotavikings,3b6l37,joey_sandwich277,2,Fri Jun 26 21:31:14 2015 UTC,"Basically, they were saying that you can't give hetero couples the ability to marry and not give same-sex couples the same right. 14th amendment. So, they ruled that banning same-sex marriage was unconstitutional."
minnesotavikings,3b6l37,vbullinger,2,Sun Jun 28 16:57:35 2015 UTC,"IMO the issue is that marriage has been both a legal and religious institution. Even a good number of religious people I've talked to don't oppose gay marriage in a legal sense. Usually their concern is that this ruling will be used to force their religious ceremonies to be changed. Many of them are okay with gay couples receiving all the legal benefits of a straight couple. They're more worried that this sets a precedent that churches will be sued for refusing to marry gay couples.  So in this sense, if the ruling is more to do with the latter, I don't see a real reason for too many people to get up in arms about it, because it's just adding sensible rights and benefits to people who are married in a legal sense. If it's the former, I think it's getting dangerously close to violating the 1st amendment."
minnesotavikings,3b6l37,dis_what_I_say,3,Fri Jun 26 18:44:53 2015 UTC,"Mm hmm. But I definitely don't like the ""benefits"" argument to marriage, either. There should be no benefit to getting married except that... you're married.  I married my wife because I love her, not to get a tax benefit.  Giving benefits to people based on their current relationship status is discriminatory against single people. I'm not making a joke. That's just wrong.  A ""marriage,"" legally, should just be a kind of contract. Like I said before: like collective bargaining rights. Or a partnership (like a corporation). If you and I were business partners and I died, you'd own my share of the business or something. In this case, when you get married and then die, you've contractually given up all of your possessions to your spouse.  But it's just a contract. It wouldn't be a government-sanctioned special contract. It's just a contract. The rest of what marriage is is in the eye of the beholder. If you see it as religious? Have a religious ceremony (like we did). If you are atheist but... still want to go through with one of the sacraments for some odd reason? Attach whatever meaning you want to it.  But you don't get to impose a definition on those who don't share that meaning.  Government should not regulate ""marriage,"" per se, at all.  EDIT: oh, and polygamy should be legal, too. In some cultures and religions, that's perfectly fine. And who am I to deny contractual rights such as shared ownership to people who decide to engage in said contractual agreements when there's more than an arbitrary number of them. Like two?"
minnesotavikings,3b6l37,slate15,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:59:14 2015 UTC,"I really wish they never used the word marriage at all in the ruling. In terms of rights it helps a ton with adoption stuff and in case of death which is cool, but marriage is something that means a lot to some people and whether they meant to or not, this redefines what marriage is. Call me a traditionalist, but I like my old definition of marriage."

minnesotavikings,3b6l37,slate15,0,Sun Jun 28 17:03:05 2015 UTC,"The tax benefits are pretty negligible (and can actually be negative), except in exemptions from estate taxes from people over the death-tax cap.  The bigger legal issues are around things like: must the government pay social security survivor benefits?  What about insurance payouts?  What about states that don't allow same-sex families to adopt?  (And what if the one allowable designated parent adopting dies?)  Stuff like that.    The laws around all of that were getting to be kind of mess - since in some states gays could get married, and some they couldn't - what if they moved?  What if (in the case of two married soldiers) they were FORCED to move to a non gay-marriage state?  Was their marriage annulled?  What if they then were forced to move elsewhere that had gay marriage?  Were they re-married?    Even though I think Roberts' dissent was pretty on point that it's not up to the job of SCOTUS to make policy decisions... had they not, those kinds of issues would have been a mess for years, maybe decades."

This is not a concern of anyone else's but me and my wife. And God, if you're religious. Otherwise? Just me and my wife. Everyone else can go jump off a cliff for all I care.   except in exemptions from estate taxes from people over the death-tax cap.   There should be no exemptions. No special rules because you're married. It's just a relationship status. No concern to a government. And I don't even think there should be an estate tax to begin with! It's layers of stupid on top of each other.   must the government pay social security survivor benefits?   No! WTF is that?!? Never, man! If my wife dies, why do I get money?!? She's a monetary burden! ...Don't tell her I said that :)   What about insurance payouts?   Contractual issue. You write in the contract who your beneficiary is. End of story.   What about states that don't allow same-sex families to adopt?    What's some unconstitutional bullshit right there, too!  All those questions in your second paragraph are answered by taking my approach.  None of this is a mess. It's straight forward.

Instead the state should not be involved in the marriage process at all, rather it should be concerned with civil unions.

The only question is ""Is this Constitutional?""  For example, I don't drink alcohol. But I don't get to decide whether or not you do. So, if someone passes a bill that says ""alcohol is banned,"" I rule that unconstitutional. Period. Doesn't matter how I feel about alcohol.  If you write a law that says ""You can't engage in a certain kind of contract akin to collective bargaining if all participants are the same gender,"" I will vote against its constitutionality (striking down a gay marriage ban, for example). Doesn't matter how you feel about gay marriage.  If you write a law that says that you're taxed for health insurance (the Supreme Court has ruled that it's a tax) then I say ""The Constitution demands all taxes be indirect or direct and equally apportioned, therefore this is unconstitutional, as it's direct and not equally apportioned,"" it doesn't matter how you feel about the ACA. It's cut and dry. End of story. See the 16th amendment as a way to get around this. They exempted income tax from the original constitutional taxation logic. The ACA doesn't fit in this category. Unconstitutional, regardless of how you feel about it. No interpretation necessary."
minnesotavikings,3b6l37,TheRealPeteWheeler,3,Fri Jun 26 17:01:31 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the interpretation of the Constitution can very much be up to the individual. Not to mention each justice probably has a different view on what the exact role of the Supreme Court is as that is a very nebulous question as well.  For example, the Supreme Court as we know it today could very well be argued to be unconstitutional especially in this decision. The idea of using judicial review to create laws was never actually written in the Constitution instead it was created by the Supreme Court in the ruling of Marbury v. Madison.  So you can see how some justices view the Constitution as iron bound and some view it as something which is made by the decision of the courts. Some justices view there position as one of guiding light of the nation and some as its stalwart protector. Neither is really wrong."

He didn't get a full off season to learn the system of a new offensive coordinator.  And he may not have been as stellar as he actually was in 2012, but that was the year we were running the ball so much that there was far less opportunities to accumulate statistics like sacks n hurries when they were handing the ball off to Adrian Peterson all the tune...

Without the fearful running game we were boasting more cracks are going to be revealed.  Even awesome CB's get burned because the dont have another CB/Safties to help them with coverage on multiple good recievers. Its a team game and Kalil was playing on the weak side of the line.

minnesotavikings,3b6qkr,Sauwan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:14:19 2015 UTC,So pretty damn fast in his own way.
minnesotavikings,3b6qkr,rippin_trippin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:15:15 2015 UTC,but he had a crazy 10 yard dash and 3 cone too
minnesotavikings,3b6qkr,full_fire,0,Fri Jun 26 18:06:54 2015 UTC,(dude's nearly in the 2000 lb club)    I'd like to see a source on this. LB for LB that would put him at one of the highest powerlifting totals on the planet.
minnesotavikings,3b6qkr,TheAesir,7,Fri Jun 26 14:42:19 2015 UTC,"He can bench twice his weight (~420), squat triple his weight (~640).  Not sure about his deadlift numbers but I assume they're probably in the same elite ballpark, maybe 600 is a safe guess? That's about 1700 lbs total, and that was at the combine.  On top of that, he ran a 4.41 40, had a 40.5"" vertical, 132"" broad jump and was a top performer at the three cone and 20 yard shuttle. Kid's just a freak."
minnesotavikings,3b6qkr,WhirledWorld,-3,Fri Jun 26 14:57:28 2015 UTC,"For starters, 1700 is good, but not earth shattering, and no where near a 2k total. On top of that, you have to factor in theres a good chance neither the squat or the bench would pass in a meet given the way most football players train the lifts. He'd likely still have an elite total (which is around 1600 for someone in the 220 weight class) and would definitely classify as strong, but not really worthy of being compared to the 2000lb totals you're going to find in the same weight class."
minnesotavikings,3b6qkr,TheAesir,3,Fri Jun 26 15:02:47 2015 UTC,"Man you powerlifters are super sensitive about this stuff.  Assuming his 1RM has progressed in the last couple years since the draft, and depending on his DL, it really wouldn't surprise me if he could do 2000 lbs between those three lifts. The guy in the NFL; shouldn't be that surprising if he's a world-class lifter."
minnesotavikings,3b6qkr,WhirledWorld,3,Fri Jun 26 15:40:39 2015 UTC,"You talk about a 2k total like its easily attainable. There are only a handful of sub 250 guys with a total at/over that. It's not sensitivity, its simply pointing out a fact in the sport"
minnesotavikings,3b6qkr,TheAesir,3,Fri Jun 26 17:38:57 2015 UTC,Put me in the camp that didn't know Robison was that athletic...
minnesotavikings,3b6qkr,Sauwan,7,Fri Jun 26 15:15:36 2015 UTC,Extremely. He had the highest vertical jump on the team before Rhodes (and then Donte Foster) showed up. It's nuts - http://www.nfldraftscout.com/ratings/dsprofile.php?pyid=8812&draftyear=2007&genpos=DE

minnesotavikings,3b6qkr,Newport_100s,0,Fri Jun 26 13:43:21 2015 UTC,Something like the length of a school bus.  Unfortunately a catch radius that large doesn't mean you can catch the god damned ball

minnesotavikings,3b4xyt,Jarlan23,8,Fri Jun 26 20:34:48 2015 UTC,I don't know anything about Basketball. Do we have a good team now? All I ever hear about is that the Wolves are terrible. It seems like whenever we get a good player he wants to be traded eventually.
minnesotavikings,3b4xyt,Jarlan23,22,Fri Jun 26 01:24:59 2015 UTC,"Last offseason, we traded Kevin Love to the Cavs for Andrew Wiggins, who was the first overall pick last offseason as well. Wiggins flashed superstar potential and won Rookie of the Year, Zach LaVine, the guy we drafted that year, won the dunk contest and also has flashed tons of potential, especially for a mid first round pick (there's only two rounds in the NBA draft, picks beyond the 3rd overall are usually regarded as far from guarantees, and a lot of second rounders don't even make the team). We also have Shabazz Muhammad and Giorgi Dieng, who are more young guys we drafted who have looked promising.  All of these guys are young though, so this year we knew we weren't gonna be very competitive. Thus, we had the worst record in the league, which secured us the first overall pick. With the first overall pick, we chose Karl-Anthony Towns, who's being regarded as one of the best prospects over the past few years. With Towns and Wiggins as our core guys and other young role players around them, it feels like for the first time in a decade the Wolves FINALLY have a chance to be competitive and work toward something bigger. Our drafts have been so miserable before the past two years because of inept management that our hopes have been pretty much nill since KG was traded to Boston.  EDIT: I need to emphasize how bad our drafts were. We had miserable luck in the lottery, and literally EVERY guy we've taken in the top 10 except Rubio has been a bust. And even Rubio has struggled with injuries and can't shoot. Trading OJ Mayo for Love on draft day has been our only other good move. Our GM from back then, David Kahn, was Matt Millen levels of inept."
minnesotavikings,3b4xyt,jargonista,8,Fri Jun 26 01:31:52 2015 UTC,You make it sound really good. Maybe I'll watch a few games next season. Thanks for the great reply.
minnesotavikings,3b4xyt,infiniteslice,4,Fri Jun 26 01:55:39 2015 UTC,"So I am not living in Minnesota anymore so I admittedly haven't watched them play in years, but from what I've read analytical guys don't really like Wiggins' game very much. For instance, his PER rating was something like 10th among all rookies. I'm not saying he's a bust but he does seem slightly overrated.   Pretty cool to get Jones though. hopefully he'll be the mauer of the twolves. The hometown boy to re-energize the franchise."
minnesotavikings,3b4xyt,ballbeard,3,Fri Jun 26 05:08:21 2015 UTC,"High usage, which Wiggins was forced into, really hurts efficiency which is what PER measures. It's better to compare Wiggins numbers to other higher usage rookies. Check out this comparison of Wiggins, Durant, Westbrook and Harden in the rookie years."

minnesotavikings,3b4xyt,Sellasella123,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:48:47 2015 UTC,"Wiggins defensive abilities are what really sets him apart. Everybody knew he was raw offensively but he showed great promise in that regard, but he also showed that he very likely can be the best wing defender in the league in the next couple of years"
minnesotavikings,3b4xyt,naphini,3,Fri Jun 26 17:03:43 2015 UTC,"Zach LaVine, the guy we drafted that year, won the dunk contest and also has flashed tons of potential   That's a load of optimism for a guy that will probably never be a starter."

minnesotavikings,3b4xyt,holla171,2,Fri Jun 26 01:44:28 2015 UTC,I'm not familiar with the nba. Just started watching this last season. Will towns most likely be a starter? Do players take about the same time to develope?
minnesotavikings,3b4xyt,Ajax_Malone,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:51:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on where they're taken in the draft. Towns will probably be a day one starter. It varies on other teams based on their situation, but most other rookies beyond the guys taken in the top 3-5 will either come off the bench or spend time in the developmental leagues."
minnesotavikings,3b4xyt,Narhen,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:54:32 2015 UTC,Do you think he starts over Pek? They can't really pay together can they? Or do you think Pek will be traded?

But someone with an insider's perspective knows the great talent and potential stored in every part of our team. The same goes for the T-Wolves. We have one of the best prospects in a long time in Andrew Wiggins. Now we have a great big man prospect in Towns. We have a couple really great young athletic guys up in LaVine and Muhammad. Overall the team composition is great and should be pretty fun to watch develop."

Honestly it sounded like it was Divac and Karl butting heads over Cousins rather than Karl and Cousins. Vlade has been very clear that Boogie was going to stay in Sac, but then seemingly out of nowhere the trade rumors started flying. It appears that Karl was the driving force behind it. I can understand why, as Boogie is arguably one of the top centers in the league and holds a lot of value. I think Twitter also played a huge role in fanning the flames. I just hope it's a non story, but we'll see."

This was the first draft I've ever watched where the team did exactly what I would've done as the GM. IMO Big KAT's ceiling is a poor man's Karl Malone, and combine that with the fact that Wiggins' ceiling is somewhere between T-Mac and Jordan and there's reason for excitement. I'm extremely excited for October to see how everyone does.   Bold prediction. The wolves are somewhere in the 6-8 seed range of a stacked western conference next season. Let's go Timber-pups!!"

minnesotavikings,3b4c8a,artcopywriter,4,Fri Jun 26 05:21:32 2015 UTC,That's right. Consecutive lifts until you need spotting and unless you lock out all the way reps don't count. Once watched an o-lineman do 30+ but because he didn't lock out enough his official figure was only 24 or something.
minnesotavikings,3b4c8a,Dorkamundo,9,Fri Jun 26 08:06:57 2015 UTC,"Kluwe stated in an interview that AD could squat more than anyone on the team, including linemen. I wouldn't doubt that he still could."

minnesotavikings,3b514o,NFLVideoConverterBot,2,Sat Jun 27 23:58:33 2015 UTC,"Favorite Vikings memory: Has a lot of recency bias but blocking 2 punts for touchdowns against the Panthers. Entertaining as hell and showed our massive defensive strides from last year.  Favorite Player: This is a tough choice, I'm not sure I can pick just one. I love Peterson's will and incredible talent, I wanna see him break records again. I'm glad he came back to the team and I want him to prove the world wrong and show that 30-year-old RBs don't have to decline. My sleeper pick is Safety Andrew Sendejo; he added a lot of us on snapchat and emailed us workout regimens and seems like he genuinely cares about his fans and his team, its hard not to love the dude. (Plus he's from San Antonio apparently, the city I'm currently living in.  Plans for the autograph: To be honest its nothing too flashy but I think its nice, I recently moved to San Antonio, Texas for school (I'm a Texas native btw), and my brother and I are currently shopping for houses to live in and I'd make it a part of my 'man-cave' and use it to keep a part of San Antonio dedicated to the Vikings.

minnesotavikings,3b514o,Nickthegreat,2,Fri Jun 26 17:15:58 2015 UTC,"My favourite Viking memory is also the reason AD is my all time favourite player. I never watched football growing up until AD's rookie season. My best friend at the time was a big Tomlinson fan and he asked if I wanted to watch the game with him when I was at his house for a sleepover, I said sure. All day leading up to the game he was telling me about how Tomlinson was the best running back in the league and showing me highlight videos of his. Naturally I was getting pretty excited to watch him play.   As it turns out this game was against a team called the Minnesota Vikings who had a hot shot rookie running back of their own that my friend was so excited to watch get blown away by Tomlinsons's numbers this game.   For anybody that doesn't know what happened in this particular game check here for results.   Needless to say I couldn't stop laughing at my friend the whole night and have been diehard Vikes fan ever since.   I would hang that autograph on my wall as proudly as ever. Sure Peterson isn't the best role model, but he'll always be the reason I'm a football fan and I'll have a place in my heart and on my wall for him for the rest of my life.   Edit: Currently the only Vikings stuff I have are a Peterson, Smith, and Patterson (I still have faith) jersey, as well as 2 ball caps I found at the very bottom of the bargain bin. Living in Atlantic Canada Vikings merch in stores is essentially non-existent"
minnesotavikings,3b514o,Elhockey3,5,Fri Jun 26 17:26:49 2015 UTC,"This is going to be kind of long, sorry in advance. When I get passionate about something it's hard to shut me up about it.   Favorite Vikings memory:  Every year I go to Vikings training camp. This story takes place in 2011. At training camp, I was standing near the fence close to the players when two young kids, brother and sister, weaseled their way up to the fence for autographs. When the players began signing autographs, the two children begged the players for their shoes. I know, seems silly, but Percy Harvin must have a soft spot for kids, because he took off his shoes right there, signed each of them, and handed them over to the kids. It was a seriously heart melting moment for me. Then Donovan McNabb walks over, the kids ask him for his shoes, and he laughs in their face and walks off (Without signing any autographs for them!) saying he wasn't going to give up his shoes! Pretty funny considering he threw our team under the bus that year and Percy was such a kind dude when everyone makes him out to be a jerk these days.   My favorite Vikings player:   ... has to be Teddy Bridgewater. I know, I know, he just came off a rookie season and we've barely seen him play, and he probably shouldn't be the favorite of a diehard, longtime Vikings fan like me, but Teddy has reinvigorated this passion inside of me that I haven't felt since 2009 with Brett Favre, and before that 2007 watching Adrian Peterson run all over the league, and before that 1998 watching Moss. I watched the 2014 draft on a stream in my old apartment with my terrible Internet, and part of me died when we picked Anthony Barr at #9. I was sure Teddy would be gone after Cleveland's pick. When Teddy remained on the board, my heart raced faster and faster with every pick. I knew we had to get him before Houston picked the next day. When the Seahawks called in the trade, I literally jumped around my apartment. I'm not ashamed to say I cried tears of joy at that moment. Since then I've been Teddy's biggest supporter I know. Even bought my dad his jersey so he can wear it when I take him to see Teddy play next season.   What I'll do with the autograph:  If I'm selected as the winner, I plan to get the autograph framed, and keep it on my desk at work to taunt my co-worker's Packers covered cubicle across from me. We have a friendly rivalry between each other. She has a huge Aaron Rodgers banner and I have an old school Vikings flag. It would be sweet to add that AP autograph into the mix for more of that sweet purple cred.   Edit: A few typos from typing this on mobile."

minnesotavikings,3b514o,TheGrappler60,2,Mon Jun 29 02:34:59 2015 UTC,"I've been a Minnesota native my whole life, and have always watched the Vikings. However I didn't get heavily into football until 2012. That being said, one of my favorite Vikings memories has to be watching AD's historic 2012 season, when he shocked the world, coming off an ACL/MCL injury to rush for 2000 yards while single-handedly carrying a bad team into the playoffs and winning an MVP award while he was at it (also carrying my fantasy team to a championship).  That season cemented my love for the Vikings. Going back further, I remember Randy Moss mooning a crowd of cheeseheads, and of course who can forget the magical 09 Favre year.  Ever since 2012, Adrian Peterson has been my favorite Viking. He's a once in a generation talent, and I wouldn't want to watch him play for any other team. Recently, however, he's been transplanted my Teddy Bridgewater. All offseason leading up to the draft I wanted Teddy, even as the naysayers piled up. Another favorite Vikings memory (possibly my number 1) is the moment we traded with Seattle to move up and get him. I got his jersey after the first preseason game. I can't wait to watch my two favorite Vikings in the backfield together this season.  What am I going to do with the autograph?  First, show every single person I know. Then, get it framed and put it on my shelf, in its own special spot. An Adrian Peterson autograph is the kind of thing you keep forever.  As for other Vikes memorabilia, I have three jerseys (Peterson, Patterson, Bridgewater), and every ticket from every Vikings game I've gone to, but really nothing else. Which is unfortunate, and also why something like this would mean a lot for me.  If you choose me, I may be able to chip in the money for shipping. Hoping to hear from you!"

I'd love the picture, if I got it it'd be framed and put on my desk, and every time I glanced at it I guarantee my face would light up like the 4th of July.Adrian Peterson is absolutely my favorite player, I've always been a huge fan of brusing offenses that fight for yards on the ground and nothing embodies that like AP putting an entire team on his back and dragging the Vikes into the playoffs.  If I'm honest though I'm a pretty young fan, only 19 and only been following the Vikes about 4 years (which is when I started following professional football,) and probably am not the most deserving.

minnesotavikings,3b514o,AiCPearlJam,4,Fri Jun 26 04:38:26 2015 UTC,"My favorite Vikings memory from when I was younger is when Moss caught that long bomb right as the half came to a close and he out of nowhere lateraled it to a streaking Moe Williams for a half-closing dagger of a touchdown. I think it was against the Niners, the same game that left Terrell Owens crying and fighting with his coaching staff on the sidelines. More recently, Brett Favre to Greg Lewis. I stood up a screamed ""THAT'S A FUCKIN TOUCHDOWN!"" a split second before the ref threw his arms up. Me and my best friend were freaking out.   My favorite player is Adrian Peterson. I think he's the hardest working and most determined player in the NFL next to JJ Watt. He ALWAYS gives 100% and is a great locker room guy. It hurt to see him getting bashed for a once in a lifetime mistake when I truly know that he's a good person who loves helping his community and impoverished children and schools.   If you choose me, I'm going to take it to Michaels to get it custom framed and matted behind anti-UV museum glass so that it doesn't take a beating from the sun. I'll cherish it forever."

Thinking of my favorite Vikings memory may be a little tough but I think I'd go with Moss' Lambeau fake moon. I think it was funny and I'm not sure when we'll have a player like that again that is a straight beast like him. Again this is a tough question lol. Buuuut I'm going to go with Harry the Hitman. He's a tough competitor that is, imo, underrated by a lot of people. I don't think he's even hit his potential now that Zimmer is here. Plus you can make him a monster in Madden!  Honestly, though, AP, Barr, McKinnon, Teddy, Flash, Everson, and Charles Johnson are all right there with him haha (I know I know... I might as well name the rest of the team haha). I think I'm going to get a nice Vikings colored frame like this. Or maybe this. Some kind of really nice frame with like a purple (above isn't really purple but I'm still looking or gold border). Then I'm probably going to hang it up in my room. Keep it nice and simple. I wouldn't mind getting a nice frame since this would be my first memorabilia (well I have some AP rookie cards and stuff but it's not signed so it doesn't count!) and AP is one of my favorite players. And I guess it is fitting because he is the only Vikings player whose jersey I own. If I do get this some suggestions on the frame would be much appreciated :) ."

Seeing Favre throw the hail mary to Greg Lewis, and having the Baltimore Ravens miss a field goal to win the game. Those are the two single most emotion filled moments in my life. I will always remember the deafening screams that make those moments with all those Vikings fans so much fun. Honorable mention would have to be when I went to the Vikings vs. Chargers game where Peterson broke the record for most yards in a game.   Favorite player: It has to be Peterson. Living on the border of Wisconsin and Minnesota I have always had to deal with Packer fans giving me crap my whole life for my team of choice. And when we got Peterson it made me so proud to root for our team because we had the single most talented player in the league and no one comes close to as much fun to watch as the electrifying Adrian Peterson.   What will I do with it: I would frame it and get it hung up in my Vikings themed bedroom.

For me its what made into the vikings fan i am today or even a football fan for that matter. Some backstory that ties together with my memory. I wanted to get into shape so i joined my local gym, on the tvs they had some nfl special show players working out in their gyms. I had been working out for a couple of months then and i gained a whole new perspective and respect for what these guys put themselves through. So i decided when i get home that hey i'll watch a football game tonight . So i turn on the game just in time to see Percy Harvin make an amazing play. He catches the ball and he is gone nobody is able to catch him as he runs into the endzone. From that moment on i was a vikings fan. I was not been born in Minnesota but the vikings are the team i love and care about.  Is AP your favorite player? If not, who is? What makes AP or them your favorite player?  Right now Teddy would have to be my favorite vikings player. I love this potential and what it could mean for everyone because he will make them all better players. Keeping the ball hungry Wide Receivers fed, Unleashing the beast that is AP, and thirdly that he will bring home the Lombardi for viking fans everywhere!  What are you going to do with the autograph? No sob stories, please!  I'll frame it as my first ever autograph possession and be so happy to have it no matter what because everything AP has done as a player has been nothing short of what a true Running back is, as we've seen in countless draft not player of his caliber comes around ever so often."
minnesotavikings,3b514o,jfolstrp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:20:04 2015 UTC,"What's your favorite Vikings memory? -Definitely AP's beastly run against the Browns Week 1 of the 2009 season, which was also Favre and Harvin's first game. I live in Cincinnati and drove up to Cleveland for the game with my dad (Minnesota native) and got to witness this amazing run in person. It was epic.  Is AP your favorite player? If not, who is? What makes AP or them your favorite player? -Absolutely AP is my favorite player. There are so many things that make him my favorite. I'll never forget the day he was drafted, I was pleading at the TV to let him fall to us at #7 and when they announced his name I flipped out. He immediately gave our franchise a much needed boost of confidence and life that we were lacking for so long. I don't know where all of you Vikings fans live but in Cincinnati I get shit all the time for being a Vikings fan. ""Why the Vikings?"" ""Dude, your favorite team wears purple..."". A lot of the hate got quieter when AP came around and finally gained our franchise some respect around the nation. Even with all the negative press AP has gotten in the last year he is still my favorite player. I'm honored to have him on our squad. Athletes of his caliber are rare and we should all appreciate the fact that we're getting to watch him play in our lifetime, for OUR team. He runs with a tenacity that is unmatched by any other RB in the league (Marshawn Lynch is his only competitor). Even with all the crap he pulled in the past year, I'm so thankful that he's still in Minnesota. Overall what makes AP my favorite player is that any time he touches the ball, he's trying to score. I love that brief moment before the ball is snapped and we're on our own 20. You think to yourself, ""Give it to Peterson, he'll take it all the way."" The ball is snapped, handed to AP, and he takes it 80 yards to the house. Best feeling in the world.  What are you going to do with the autograph? No sob stories, please! -Add it to my collection of Peterson memorabilia. I have a shrine for AP in my old room at my parents house. Including: An on-field version of his first probowl jersey, on-field version of his Oklahoma jersey (my favorite), on-field version of the old vikings jersey, and a full size helmet signed after his rookie year which includes ""R.O.Y. 07"" below his autograph. The only thing missing from my shrine is a signed photo of him (and possibly some game worn gear, but beggars can't be choosers).  I would be honored to receive this gift from you OP but don't want to be greedy either as I already have one signed piece of memorabilia from AP. I trust you will make the right decision based on all of the posts in this thread. Either way this is a wonderful idea and very generous of you! SKOL!"

I was 10 years old and didn't really care about football, lived in the heart of Packers country (about 20 minutes from Green Bay), and my parents were (still are) Packers season ticket holders.  Then I watched Randy Moss play, making spectacular play after spectacular play and I was hooked on the sport, and the team.  A close second would be attending the last game at the Metrodome in 2013, I was by the tunnel and was inches from catching one of Jared Allen's gloves after the game (girl sitting in front of me caught it, but she was cool and let me try it on/take a picture with it)  -AP is one of my favorite current players (Teddy and Smith are the others), but my all time still has to be Moss, he's the reason I fell in love with the game as a child.  Though I do own 3 AP jerseys (home purple from his rookie season, 2009 pro-bowl edition, and cool looking black/white alternate)  -If i win It will be framed and hung on my wall, to piss off my Packers season ticket holding Dad and brothers when they come over (my brothers and I were all put on the season ticket waiting list after I was born in 1988, but I sold my tickets to a friend of my parents after I got chosen 2 years ago).  Or maybe put it up by my desk at work (I work in Green Bay, literally 5 minutes from the stadium) to annoy co-workers.  -Only other Vikings memorabilia I have besides jerseys are a Michael Bennett autographed football, a pennant from the final game at the Metrodome in 2013, and a couple of Christmas tree ornaments.  Will edit the post later tonight if I have time but I'm getting ready for a poker game.

My favorite Viking memory was when Brett Favre with no time left threw a 35 yard pass to Greg Lewis in the back of the endzone. He evades a rusher, throws it as he gets put on the ground, couldn't have been in a better spot, Greg Lewis feet couldn't be closer to the out of bounds.  I was young when 98 happened. I remember thinking that this is just how football goes for your team. You're really good and good guys win. Then of course the Gary Anderson miss and I lost my foolish optimism. This Brett Favre moment was the moment since I first started watching football where I was like ""The magic is finally on our side. The good guys are going to win."" (Of course my hopes were dashed all the harder as we all know how the season ends. Still I'll never forget that feeling)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgxSzxIxPrY  Is AP your favorite player? If not, who is? What makes AP or them your favorite player? All-Time: Randy Moss. Could throw it anywhere near him, he'd come down with it. When he fake mooned the Green Bay crowd, I felt on top of the world. Being young and impressionable, I idolized him. Current: Adrian Peterson. What he's brought to this franchise is unprecedented. Not to mention the amount of excitement he brings, that skipped heartbeat every time the ball touches his hands and you know there's a chance something amazing will happen. The combination of speed, agility, and power is freakish. I think when it's all said and done, he'll be the best.  What are you going to do with the autograph?  I'm going to frame it and put it on my desk at work. I'm a teacher. I'll make sure all my students know I'm a Vikings fan because they're the best and the best running back is AP."

minnesotavikings,3b514o,Randy_Moss_84,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:32:51 2015 UTC,"-My favorite Vikings memory would have to be 1998. In a sick twisted way it taught me humility. My wife and I were watching ""The game"" and before the first half was over I said OMG I can't believe we're going to lose this game. She told me I was being negative, but I said no, we are not playing Vikings football. I know a great Vikings memory should be great like the last second Favre pass or something. But for me, this sums up watching the Vikes for my whole life. Watching 4 super bowl loses when my friends growing up were the other team fans hurt. 1998 put it all in perspective as to real Vikings fans can endure anything.  -AP, I backed through this whole mess. But, Robert Smith was so respectable I think he was great. Tark, to much show boat. The purple people eaters, were a unit not individuals. So many over the years but I compair the way Robert Smith went out vs Chris Carter. Carter had what seemed like two full years of distracting retirement only to go to who, Miami? Smith said ""thank you very much, goodby"" Reminded me of Barry Sanders scoring a TD and simply handing the ball to a ref as if to say thanks.  -The Autograph. I would mount above my desk to see it every day.I refused to update Verizon's android app because once news broke last year they quick updated it and removed AD from the cover page. I have a copy of the old apk, but if I don't update, I still get the new news, with the old photo.  -Other memorabilia. I have a 20 yr old winter coat never worn because I've not lost those couple pounds for it to fit yet. A CC jersey that was never worn, too big. A couple mugs, pennant, coat rack helmet and of course a gnome which is presently the only thing ""she"" lets me display.  And yes, I have Paypal. And I just read a few of the others. Great memories. Moss to Williams was practiced after practice every Friday. Coaches said they were nuts. The blocked punts were great but they used to do that more often years ago. But those two in one game were great. AP's 2000+ and game against SD were awesome. Anderson almost not missing a kick in a year was impressive.  Foreman's spins, Browner's hits, so, so many. Ok, I'm ranting now, sorry lol.   -No matter what, I do know I feel better about our Vikes than I have in a long long time. :)"

My favorite memory is very recent. I went with my family (Dad and two brothers..) Down to Tampa Bay. My dad has had season tickets for as long as I remember, but this last October was our first family game as the away team, minus my mom, she stayed in Minnesota. As you may recall that game was quite the scrum. After enjoying the sun and cheering the Vikes, Tampa started making a come back. This obnoxious, drunk Tampa fan in front of us was extremely rude, telling purple fans to fuck off and suck it. My brother started talking shit back to him. Not very smart, but pretty funny looking back now. After some big talk and some security coming to calm down the Tampa Fan. ( I'm bias but this dude was mega drunk and cussing up a storm)... O T hit. We still get silent looks and trash gestures from him (bird and such) when he would turn around. You know what happens next. Complete pass... Barr... TD. SKOL.... Long story short, it felt like the Vikings stood up for us and had our back just like my family has for many years.  • Is AP your favorite player? If not, who is? What makes AP or them your favorite player?  AP is my favorite player to watch. Maybe not my favorite person, but god damn he is electrifying. It reminds me of the excitement I had watching Randy growing up, which got me hooked on football, but this dude was also laying people out. AP had dictated my Madden teams since 2007. I've always been a RB guy, so my fav last year was McKinnon, but after AP, it is going to be tough because anything but the best RB play won't hit our expectations.  • What are you going to do with the autograph? No sob stories, please!  No lies. I'm going to Frame that fucker on my wall above my computer with my other Vikings stuff. Right next to my Batman stuff. And I'm getting my Cris Carter autographed to go next to it from my mom.  • Bonus: If you have some other Vikings autographs/memorabilia, show them off!  I don't have pics now because of mobile, but I've been collecting trading cards and posters since I was a kid. Trying to get rookie cards of my fav players. Got Randy and Robert and Daunte. Just bought Teddy plus an AP mvp to go with his rookie card. Working on Harrison and Randall McD. Coolest though is my Cris Carter  autographed picture (non authenticated). I mailed him when I was eight at the Vikings headquarters and I received an autographed picture back. I can send pictures if you'd like.  I'm not super active on this sub but this was fun to write.

I watched each game with my dad, and it was amazing to see what I was sure was the best team in the league each week.  The Favre to Greg Lewis play might have been the single highlight of that amazing year.  I am still bitter about the NFCCG.  Is AP your favorite player? If not, who is? What makes AP or them your favorite player?  Peterson is my favorite active player, but Randy Moss is my favorite player of all-time.  There is just no one like Moss.  He is maybe the greatest athlete I have ever seen.  As Randy once said, ""If I can't get to it, nobody can get to it.""  What are you going to do with the autograph? No sob stories, please!

Favorite Vikes Memories, I watched the 2009 NFCCG in Afghanistan on the AFN (Armed Forces Network) with a group of die hard Packers fans! I deployed with a unit from Wisconsin. I had been a Favre fan all my life (including a year as a Jets ""fan"" but when the Vikes had that (near) SB run in '09, I decided that it was always going to be the Vikings for me from now on! AP and Lord Have Mercy, Percy were so much fun to watch that game (and all season!!!). That year really got me into football, as I was a very very very casual fan until then, now my friends ask me to tone it down! AP is my favorite player, as with Brett and the dick pics, I can separate the player from the person. Adrian is the most amazing player to watch. I remember in 2009 when he trucked Pit Steelers William Gay (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmrAyU3HcU0) as I was running on the treadmill in the gym. I had to stop and stand while they showed the replay!!! It was awesome. As to what I will do, I really think I'd just hang it on the wall and treasure it forever.

minnesotavikings,3b2spr,Maint_Man13,2,Thu Jun 25 17:48:54 2015 UTC,"That pop over thing is annoying, so I quick copy-pasted. Here's the text:  Around this time every year I'm burdened by an emptiness that directly coincides with the cyclical scarcity of NFL news.  I'm that guy — the one unfulfilled by the U.S. Open and even a highly-entertaining NBA Finals series. Heck, a horse just won the first Triple Crown in 37 years and all I can see is the misspelling of ""pharaoh."" And baseball? Wake me up when we get to the Midsummer Classic.  I just want pro football to return — nothing else fully satisfies.  But despite a relative dead zone — OTAs and minicamps have concluded, and training camps won't start for a few more weeks — there's still plenty to talk about to fill the void.  When it comes to the Minnesota Vikings, I think an apt place to start is with Teddy Bridgewater. (Frankly, anything is better than rehashing the Adrian Peterson saga.)  With respect to Minnesota's up-and-coming quarterback, there are good reasons to believe a second-year surge lies ahead.  For the first clues, look at his finish last season.  Bridgewater's impressive five-game end to the regular season had him rated, by Pro Football Focus' metrics, as the top quarterback in the league over that stretch. No one should suggest that was actually the case, but Bridgewater's numbers — particularly the easily-workable completion percentage and yards per attempt — show a marked improvement in the season's final month.  I like completion percentage because it's a great starting point — rarely do your top-end quarterbacks do poorly in this category. (Exceptions exist: i.e. Joe Flacco's Super Bowl season/postseason.) Is the ball getting into the receivers' hands? This stat gives you a baseline, but truthfully it's not all that useful on its own.  I like yards per attempt because, like the former, it's simple — but also because it paints a clearer picture of a quarterback's production. Take the total passing yards and divide by the number of attempts. That's your average yards per attempt. Easy peasy. Low yards per attempt mean the passing game isn't too productive, and vice versa.  (It's also the base for two excellent-if-neglected measures — net yards per attempt and adjusted net yards per attempt, the first which takes into account negative plays like sacks and interceptions and the second which folds in touchdowns and interceptions.)  But back to Bridgewater.  Last season he stepped in for injured Matt Cassell midway into their Week 3 matchup in New Orleans. In his first eight games, Bridgewater compiled a rookie-like 1,689 passing yards, with 6 TDs/7 INTs. That included a 60.3 completion percentage, and 6.45 yards per attempt.  In the final five games — where Minnesota went 3-2, both defeats suffered on the road by two points — Bridgewater was another player altogether. He completed a prolific 72 percent of his passes, racking up 1,230 yards to go with 8 TDs/5 INTs. His average yards per attempt in that span ballooned to 8.79. (For what it's worth, Tony Romo led the league last season with 8.5 yards per attempt; Aaron Rodgers was second with 8.4.)  Those numbers weren't very rookie-like at all. The ball was getting to where it needed to get, and with admirable efficiency. At nearly nine yards a pop, this wasn't a dink-and-dunk offense.  Simply put, Bridgewater's late-season ascent — though small in sample size — showed the potential difference between a true, starting-calibre franchise quarterback and the last guy the Vikings pinned their hopes upon: Christian Ponder. To avoid comparisons to the latter, Bridgewater will need to continue to hit his targets at a high tick.  He'll also want life before and after the snap to slow down. Ponder never mastered reading defenses or working through his progressions. Even after just one year, Bridgewater's shown more.  It might be unreasonable this season to expect that same level of efficiency from Bridgewater week in, week out, but it is perfectly reasonable to expect a step forward.  Bridgewater has had a strong spring and summer as a second-year disciple in offensive coordinator Norv Turner's offense, and has reportedly started to gel with free agent speedster Mike Wallace while building upon a strong foundation with third-year receiver and breakout-candidate Charles Johnson.  (In Feb. before Wallace's signing, Turner said Johnson is ""far and away our best receiver,"" a strong vote of confidence for the 6-foot-2, 215 pound receiver with sub-4.40 speed.)  Bridgewater will also have Adrian Peterson in the backfield. You may have heard of him.  Add in a defense that's made significant strides under the guidance of head coach Mike Zimmer, and the budding optimism surrounding the Vikings seems a lot more grounded than it does pie-in-the-sky.  (The Vikings' defense ranked 31st in yards and 32nd in points in 2013, surging to 14th and 11th under Zimmer last season.)  There's more to a winning formula than a strong defense and running game, though that's a good place to start. But Bridgewater is the key to pushing the Vikings from 7-to-8-win mediocrity into 9-to-10-win-or-more playoff territory.  Count only the Arizona Cardinals among last year's playoff teams that got there with sub-standard quarterbacking, and injuries were to blame. In this league at this point in time, it's all about the quarterback.  If Minnesota's picks up where he left off last season, don't be surprised to see the Vikings back in the postseason."

That's why Diggs was dominating him during OTAs and whatnot. Waynes excels when he can use his body and the sideline to his advantage - he'll be put in spots to do this well.   I am a fan of Waynes and wanted the Vikings to draft him, so I'm not being pessimistic, it's just important to realize he probably won't start right away and will take some pretty big lumps as he acclimates with the level of play of the NFL."
minnesotavikings,3b2e2w,vsky,3,Thu Jun 25 13:27:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it's not a problem with agility or stiff hips like all these supposed draft experts are saying.  He's a natural physical jam corner, like Rhodes or Brandon Browner.  In college he played tight physical coverage.  High risk, high reward stuff.  That's why he sometimes got burned.  The problem I have is all these supposed draftniks watched one game where he got burned a couple of times, looked at his combine time, then declared him the Gregor Clegane of cornerbacks.  Then all the sudden this narrative appeared (cough Gruden cough) that he was not a good tackling corner.  Those things couldn't be farther from the truth.  If you actually take the time to watch just a little bit of tape on him, what you see is a corner that Michigan State used all over the field, on blitzes, in run support.  An aggressive, athletic corner who is prone to occasional mistakes because of mental positioning errors more than ""stiff hips.""  The reason his hips were ""stiff"" is because he wasn't making decisions as fast as he needed to in the coverage he was playing.  It's not because of some physical limitation.  But I guess the easier thing to do is nitpick a tenth of a second on an underwear olympics cone drill."
minnesotavikings,3b2e2w,deadjawa,5,Thu Jun 25 14:02:49 2015 UTC,"Gregor Clegane of cornerbacks.   Well, I mean... an 8 foot cornerback would be kind of neat to see."

minnesotavikings,3b2e2w,youvebeengreggd,0,Thu Jun 25 15:51:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he's a bad tackler, but I won't hesitate to say that he needs to bulk up and play more physically in order to be 'OK' in run support at the NFL level. I did a break down right after the draft and found several examples of him getting blown over by offensive lineman or wide receivers.   Again, don't get me wrong, very few rookie CBs will come into the league willing and able to support the run game like Winfield did, but it's an area of improvement, that's for sure."

I'm a big Diggs guy.  Also, I think he'll start. I just wrote an article about it... Actually.  I think with Captain being hurt, he will probably start in the slot.   But, then again. I wasn't aware of the Diggs shit. I knew Diggs was tearing up mini-camp and OTAs.   But, realistically. With Zimmer basically moving into Waynes' new Eden Prairie Townhouse... He will be ready by the time the season starts. And, that having been said. Keep in mind he is learning a new system, and there's a lot of thinking involved during practice, especially when he's being one on oned by Zimmer. Like, this article, talking about how they're dumping a TON on his plate. Asking him to learn each spot... I don't think you can say that something that happened in OTAs or Minicamp, under that context, is proof of struggling with shifty wide outs (http://espn.go.com/blog/minnesota-vikings/post/_/id/14238/vikings-will-be-thorough-with-trae-waynes)  Also, man. What tape were you watching? The youtube clips on PFF? That's not ""tape"". That's a replay of TV coverage. And, if he struggled THAT bad, against shifty receivers. He would've given up TD's. And he didn't. Excuse how confrontational that sounds... Not my intention. At all. I just think people need to realize that there's a difference between youtube replays and what the team watches.   And the stuff I've seen, to prove what you're saying. On sites? Were all like 10 yard completions where he was RIGHT THERE, and there was zero YAC. I have yet to see something that is anything but a couple first downs, and by a couple I mean a couple. And I felt like, if that's the best these dudes can find to support their ""overrated"" tag. Then... He's gonna be fine."
minnesotavikings,3b2e2w,ull90,3,Thu Jun 25 15:06:40 2015 UTC,"And, if he struggled THAT bad, against shifty receivers. He would've given up TD's. And he didn't.   Stats like that can be misleading. You don't need the all 22 to be able to make a reasonable assessment on a player. Waynes does struggle covering quick timing routes sometimes. You can watch a lot of full games of him and you'll see that. There's no need to try to discredit any criticism of him and pretend he doesn't have any flaws. If he was a perfect prospect he wouldn't be on our team."
minnesotavikings,3b2e2w,vsky,0,Thu Jun 25 17:10:21 2015 UTC,"Everyone has flaws. I just think that this particular set of criticisms is based on one PFF article that was reaching. Hard.   Simply because I am saying this criticism is wrong doesn't mean I think dude is perfect. And, the ""tape"" thing is a pet peeve, admittedly. It's the clips from the article. And, this goes beyond you, I just know most guys who say that didn't sit down and watch Michigan state games on YouTube. and even if they had, it isn't tape. It's a replay. Tape is film the team films.   And. From the ""tape"" shown, he was always right there. and made the tackle. So, I don't think he struggles enough for it to be a bullet point in the con category. He does have other cons, though. Strength, weight. Run support.   And the draft is more complicated than that. Teams drsft based on need. Especially higher up (except the Bears, ha), so, not everyone needed a CB. And, usually the first player taken is the most perfect of that position. So, I just haven't seen anything to support this point, and doubt that he would be considered the consensus best CB if he couldn't handle receivers who can juke, since most can in the Big Ten.   Edit: Switched from iPad to PC."
minnesotavikings,3b2e2w,bainpr,3,Thu Jun 25 17:27:11 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I just get sick of not being able to say anything remotely negative in this sub, especially about rookies. I think Waynes will struggle with quick receivers for a while but I can't say that without getting downvoted and a bunch of people telling me I'm wrong, even though CBs are like the riskiest players to draft in the first round and I've watched a lot of Waynes to try to develop an unbiased assessment. But the sub will take a 4.19 pro day shuttle as more proof that he will be great player because that's what we want to believe."
minnesotavikings,3b2e2w,full_fire,2,Thu Jun 25 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I came off that way. Not my intention.   I know what you mean. Big time.   And, to clarify. I posted the shuttle time because the sub took his original, combine shuttle, as proof that he was awful. That was kinda the point of this. So, while I know what you mean, this is kind of the opposite in that I've been downvoted for being positive.   It's all a matter of who read what article most recently. I like to debate stuff, and that's what I was doing here. I don't downvote people, and I don't get personal or anything. I just debate, and that usually turns into a shit show.

minnesotavikings,3b2e2w,NFLVideoConverterBot,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:39:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that he's going to struggle with the quick routes early on. He's going to struggle with a lot of things early on, as most rookies (especially rookie CBs) do. Rhodes still struggles with those quick routes and quicker receivers. Tall, lanky corners just don't cover those very well, generally. That's why Rhodes got burned by guys like Wallace. It's a condition of their size for the most part. Tall corners have to be very good at what they do because recovery is more difficult at that size. One false step and now you've got to move your 6-1, 200 lb. body the opposite direction."

He does have problems with shifty receivers, but wasn't asked to cover them at Michigan State - which is what I think will be the case here too. Hence my original comment."
minnesotavikings,3b2e2w,JCM83,2,Thu Jun 25 17:37:02 2015 UTC,"Who did he cover then? He was a starting corner. So, he covered the 1 or 2. Mostly. Are you saying he was moved off of ""shifty"" receivers and placed in the slot?   Edit: And, these are legitimate questions. They may sound sarcastic, or condescending, because tone gets lost. But I'm genuinely asking if that is the case. Because, that just doesn't make sense to me.   Also, keep in mind they had Dennard in '13. So, he obviously took the top guy. But in '14. I can't see how they wouldn't ask their #1, and the consensus #1 corner in the country, to cover someone."

minnesotavikings,3b2m5d,whambamthankyoulamb,7,Thu Jun 25 17:32:31 2015 UTC,I don't think he was very good at all. He threw a bunch of garbage time TDs and didn't have a lot of INTs due to some luck and a lot of conservative play. Every other stat or metric says he was one of the worst qbs in the league.

minnesotavikings,3b2m7s,iJerm,2,Thu Jun 25 15:34:31 2015 UTC,"He doesn't give grades, just talks about how the two of them are a big reason why our grades are so high. It's a decent read, for an ESPN blog piece.    With offseason workouts and minicamps in the rearview mirror and training camps just a few weeks away, we assess the Minnesota Vikings' offseason moves and assign a letter grade in the video above.  Best move: The Vikings made a few moves to put themselves in playoff position for 2015, but the strongest one wasn't a transaction at all. They got Adrian Peterson back in the fold after an eight-month absence and got the running back to put aside his concerns about returning to Minnesota and show up for OTAs. Peterson's relationship with coach Mike Zimmer was a major factor in his return, and his presence should give quarterback Teddy Bridgewater some more forgiving looks from defenses in 2015.  Riskiest move: The Vikings didn't go out on a limb with many of their offseason moves, but their trade for Mike Wallace could carry some risk. He is due to count $9.9 million against the cap this season, and he was available for a fifth-round pick after clashing with coaches in Miami. Wallace seems to be a better fit in the Vikings' scheme than he was in the Dolphins' offense, and running backs coach Kirby Wilson, who worked with Wallace in Pittsburgh, vouched for the receiver. But if things don't work out this season, the Vikings could face a tough decision on Wallace, who is due to make $11.45 million in 2016.  Competition in the secondary: Even though they had the seventh-best pass defense in the league in 2014, the Vikings felt they needed to address the cornerback position. They signed Terence Newman, who will be 37 this season, to a one-year deal, and they spent the 11th overall pick on Michigan State cornerback Trae Waynes. Newman heads into camp looking like the starting left cornerback, while Waynes will get some time to develop, but the Vikings' moves suggest they weren't satisfied with Josh Robinson and Captain Munnerlyn, who were both inconsistent in 2014. The Vikings' cornerback depth figures to bring plenty of training camp competition to the position.  Training camp outlook: The Vikings will get to work a week earlier than most teams in the league this July, thanks to their slot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game in August. The development of Bridgewater, in a season in which he should have plenty of weapons, could ultimately dictate whether the Vikings make a playoff push. He'll have plenty of time to build a rapport with a talented but unpolished receiving corps."

Clemmings could possibly start at RT, if Loadholt isn't 100% by the beginning of the season. I don't know if he or Harris would be the more likely starting RT.  Pruitt will be the ""starting"" TE2, at least for formations where both TEs are likely to run routes.  Diggs is unlikely to start as a receiver, just because it's unlikely that he jumps ahead of any of the top 3 before the start of the season. He could be in heavy rotation, though. Norv said something along the lines of ""It's better if we have 21 guys playing like starters on offense, that gives me more options"". That's kind of a duh statement, but I think he'd be willing to incorporate plays for depth receivers if they are talented enough for it.  Diggs could start at PR, though.  So 3-5 rookie starters, maybe?"
minnesotavikings,3b2ajw,istasber,6,Thu Jun 25 14:26:28 2015 UTC,"3 or 4  Waynes, Kendricks, Clemmings, and maybe Diggs.   Diggs could take over punt returner if he shines in pre season. I also see him getting 10 to 15 snaps at WR as well, although that isn't technically starting, I would still count it."
minnesotavikings,3b2ajw,schwertfeger,7,Thu Jun 25 12:40:31 2015 UTC,I don't think Clemmings or Waynes are sure things to start. I'd be surprised if we had more than 3 and my guess would be 2.
minnesotavikings,3b2ajw,pingpongguy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:15:09 2015 UTC,"Paul Allen said Clemmings is almost certainly a lock to start right guard. That could change during pre season , but for now that is how I see it. I also don't see old man Newman starting over Waynes, but again it will come down to pre season most likely."
minnesotavikings,3b2ajw,schwertfeger,3,Thu Jun 25 13:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wouldn't take PA's prediction on Clemmings as gospel. If the staff was set on Clemmings at RG why would they play Thompson there for the last 3 weeks?   As for Waynes, I don't think he'll start unless he's totally ready. CB is one of the toughest positions to transfer to the NFL and the last thing he needs is to get wrecked by Johnson/Tate/Cobb/Nelson if he isn't ready to cover those type of guys consistently. I'd be surprised if he isn't starting by the end of the year, but I could definitely see a Rhodes like rookie season where he doesn't play a lot right off the bat."
minnesotavikings,3b2ajw,pingpongguy,3,Thu Jun 25 13:42:07 2015 UTC,"I would definitely count being the punt returner as being a starter. It's a specialized position that carries enough weight to classify as a ""starting position"" IMO."
minnesotavikings,3b2ajw,nomaam05,2,Thu Jun 25 12:48:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry my wording was poor this morning. I was saying if he wasn't the starting punt returner, I still see him coming in for snaps at WR. He wouldn't technically be the starter but ""starting"" wide receiver doesn't really matter because they all sub in and out all game."
minnesotavikings,3b2ajw,schwertfeger,3,Thu Jun 25 12:54:55 2015 UTC,"The article pretty much mirrors my own thoughts. Waynes might not be ready, Kendricks will, and Clemmings is a bit of a long shot, I think, since he was a fourth rounder, is raw, and is converting to this new position. Right now, I think they know what Berger can do at RG, so they're looking at the other guys to get a feel for them."
minnesotavikings,3b2ajw,ull90,2,Thu Jun 25 14:09:29 2015 UTC,Mycole Pruitt will start as TE2. #1 if Rudy is injured preseason

BUT it sounds like our 3rd round pick from last draft seems to be primed.  It's going to be an interesting battle for the 2nd string edge rushers."

I don't count the special teams guys at starters. You don't get credited for a start by the NFL for returning the kickoff. The only exceptions I'd really make would be second TE/slot reciever or two down linebacker/nickel corner.

minnesotavikings,3b1riv,nomaam05,13,Thu Jun 25 07:17:31 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the rest of the circumstances for me.   For example, if Rodgers and Stafford have their best years next year, and we drop all 4 of those games, with our already rough schedule, I wouldn't be super worried.   But if they play to were they normally do, and we drop a lot of games that are perceived as ""easier"", then I might start to worry, but I'd still give him a few more years at that point."
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,cusoman,4,Thu Jun 25 07:27:16 2015 UTC,"For example, if Rodgers and Stafford have their best years next year, and we drop all 4 of those games, with our already rough schedule, I wouldn't be super worried.   See, I don't get this mentality.  Part of the reason our schedule always seems rough every year now is the fact that we play in the division we do, so that's not exactly going to change for the following season.  To be the best, you have to beat the best (WHOO!), and dropping so many division games simply because a QB is playing lights out just doesn't cut it for me, not for a brilliant defensive mind like Zimmer is supposed to be.  It's not like those teams are going to magically lose their QB the following year.  This is all to say I think Zimmer deserves at least 4 years to try and make it all come to life and start churning out success in the division.  I just can't give him a pass because of how good the division is, they gotta rise above that."
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,nomaam05,7,Thu Jun 25 12:09:18 2015 UTC,"I mean, there is a difference between Stafford and Rodgers playing like they normally do, and them having their best years ever. It really doesn't matter if those teams are losing their qbs afterwards or not, but teams didn't freak out for losing to Brady when they went 16-0, because sometimes, other people are just too far on it.   And our schedule doesn't look rough simply because we play the Packers twice and the Lions twice. We also play the Broncos, Chargers, Seahawks, and Cardinals."
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,AiCPearlJam,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:20:39 2015 UTC,Am I the only one not worried about the Broncos and Cardinals? I think these are the two teams who'll take a step back.
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,nomaam05,8,Thu Jun 25 12:47:56 2015 UTC,"Probably not the only one, bet I would think you're definitely in the minority on that. At least for the Broncos, probably not so much on the Cards."
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,AiCPearlJam,3,Thu Jun 25 12:52:00 2015 UTC,I think the Broncos will be beat regularly by teams with a decent to great pass rush. Their offensive line is non-existent and Manning isn't getting younger. I could easily see them getting out played a lot this season.
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,nomaam05,3,Thu Jun 25 12:55:46 2015 UTC,"He doesn't need to be younger, he still has one of, if not, the quickest releases in the game, IMO. That's what's saved him during years with bad o-lines before."
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,jjspaceman,2,Thu Jun 25 13:04:29 2015 UTC,Yup. Like that season he suffered Charlie Johnson.
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,JohnathanTheBrave,2,Thu Jun 25 19:29:18 2015 UTC,"If Manning is getting absolutely crushed on a regular basis, even if he gets the ball off, his game will be effected. He's getting old. Little dings take longer to heal."
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,nomaam05,2,Thu Jun 25 13:44:00 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, but the whole point of him having the fastest release in the game, is that he won't be getting hit nearly as much as other QBs in that position."

minnesotavikings,3b1riv,cusoman,0,Thu Jun 25 19:36:27 2015 UTC,"And our schedule doesn't look rough simply because we play the Packers twice and the Lions twice. We also play the Broncos, Chargers, Seahawks, and Cardinals.   But again, that doesn't change after this year.  Next year we have what will likely be tough opponents in:  Dallas, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, an NFC West opponent, on top of the normal slate of division games.  Every season is going to have those seemingly tough opponents, that's the NFL.  We need a team that's to the point where we look at those teams and go ""you know, that's going to be a tough matchup, but it's completely winnable""."
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,nomaam05,2,Thu Jun 25 13:05:02 2015 UTC,"We aren't talking about what happens after this year. And no, we don't have Schedules with this many tough looking games every season.    We need a team that's to the point where we look at those teams and go ""you know, that's going to be a tough matchup, but it's completely winnable"".   I agree 100%, but we don't have that, nor is that what we are talking about. Like, when I look at the Packers and the Lions, It seems perfectly reasonable to say, ""Hey, no reason for us to lose all 4 of those games."" But, if Stafford and/or Rodgers just flat out dominate the league next year, I'm not going to sweat it as the coaching staff's fault."
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,jjspaceman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:24:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you give a coach 3-4 years to re-shape the roster the way he wants and make sure his system is fully installed.

minnesotavikings,3b1riv,creative_dreams,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:28:15 2015 UTC,how do you know we have a rough schedule? i believe with the parity in the NFL you cant use that as a logical answer.

minnesotavikings,3b1riv,whambamthankyoulamb,5,Thu Jun 25 14:27:30 2015 UTC,"The other flip of the coin is that while you want a coaching staff to make a certain amount of progress in a certain amount of time, when you replace them you have to have an improvement in mind, and for arguments sake, let's say we cut the coaching staff right now, nobody available is even close."
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,full_fire,2,Thu Jun 25 14:30:14 2015 UTC,Sometimes coaches burn so many bridges that you just have to move on.    I'm hoping we stick with Zim for a while.  Everyone here feels it: he has what it takes to elevate this team to perennial contender.
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,Waffleradio,4,Thu Jun 25 14:43:34 2015 UTC,"If we have the same record, that means our team got better. Our team scaled properly with the rest of the NFL. If we have a losing record, it also doesn't mean we're a worse team. The 2015 Vikings could beat the 2014 Vikings, it's just others teams had better improvements over the offseason."

They're only comparing the 2015 version of their team to the 2014 versions of others. The real idea is comparing your 2015 team to your 2014 team and then testing it against your opponents who've scaled as well.  It's hard to think that way because your win record is really all that matters in terms of team success."
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,SpYf3R,2,Thu Jun 25 22:33:29 2015 UTC,"8-8 or worse is a pretty large span. The ship wouldn't really need righting after an 8-8 season or a 7-9 season.

minnesotavikings,3b1riv,sand0789,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:44:59 2015 UTC,I was actually thinking about this question the other day but about the Jags. Every Jags fan says how they love their coach and how he's the key to turning them around and while I do think he is a good coach it hasn't shown yet on the field so even if he's a great coach how long do they stick with him if he doesn't win.  As for the Vikings and Zimmer I believe he is the right coach for us and even if we somehow had our worst season ever I think he stay and should stay. He will get the most out of this team and with him were gonna be true title contenders sooner than later!
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,Waffleradio,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:19:25 2015 UTC,"Assuming that they aren't hit with an abnormally high number of injuries, I think coaches should get 3 seasons no matter what.  But if it is 3 seasons without a winning record, you should just move on.    That is my personal belief on the situation.  I think it is difficult to historically find a coaching staff that couldn't get to the playoffs in 3 seasons, yet went on to win a superbowl.  Much like with quarterbacks.  You have to see something early or you probably won't see it ever.    Not saying Teddy needs to be MVP or the team must win a Superbowl for the coaches to stay around.  But a playoff appearance in the first three seasons is my absolute bare minimum standard for continued employment."
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,crosenblum,2,Thu Jun 25 20:39:03 2015 UTC,"I think that depends on the starting point. If you take over the Lions who went defeated that one season, well, it's probably gonna take more than 3 years to turn the team around. If you take over the Vikings who almost went to the superbowl on the shoulders of Favre and Peterson, then bombed out the next year, 2-4 years for another playoff appearance isn't unreasonable."
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,CypherLH,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:26:39 2015 UTC,"I think no matter who the hc oc/dc it is going to take a few years to get into Playoff/Superbowl potential.  Because we luck out and get some wild supergenius Coach, it is just takes time.  Time to find the right players, talented with work ethic.  Time to take any players we do get, to develop and train them to their highest potential.  Time to develop schemes that will give each of our playmakers the ability to maximize their efforts.  So this year has been exciting for many different reasons.   Our defense is really getting a lot better. We have brand new talent, and apparently so far, well-trained talent. Teddy Bridgewater has more weapons, AP is back, and healthy, Mike Wallace as a Deep Threat, plus we have a really nice depth of WR's. Healthy TE Kyle Rudolph. Slick Rick, is getting us valuable talent, that we can leverage over time to become full playmakers. Solid Coaches that know how to train and develop our players.   I think no matter how good your draft and free agency is, if you can't train and develop them, you will lose.  And I think that one item, is something we have been really lacking for the last many years.  Where are we still weak?   Offensive Line, we need to stay healthy, and protect Teddy, and give him time, to make good throws. And create holes for AP. What if Teddy turns out to be a bust, who is our back up plan? I think if our history show's us, we get a new HC, we get a new QB, and then once the HC busts and is fired, we get another QB.    I am not in any way saying Teddy is a bust, but can we afford to not have a backup option, a rookie or near rookie QB with good potential to start as well?   TE/FB. I like Kyle Rudolph, but he has to show he can play well and be healthy this year. If he can't we have to move on. We can't afford guys to be paid well and not stay healthy. In the past we had to have an FB to help AP block, especially with sucky OL. Is that still the case, who know's? Once we have starters and playmakers in each key position offense and defense, who is their backup in case they get injured?   That's my two-cents."
minnesotavikings,3b1riv,mighty_jid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:23:07 2015 UTC,"Personally I'll be disappointed with anything under 9-7 this year. With all our young talent I really feel like we should take another step this year. That said, if we went 8-8 but at least finished the season strong then I would still have a lot of hope that 2016 is THE year for everything to come together.  A LOT depends on Teddy as well, of course.   If we go under 8-8 then it'd probably mean that some players aren't taking anywhere near the step we expected, or that Teddy isn't developing nearly as fast as we hoped, etc.   EDIT - to answer the actual question, if we're not at least in the playoffs by the 2016 season then that's when I start to seriously worry"

minnesotavikings,3az17y,LittleBitLoose,19,Wed Jun 24 17:19:15 2015 UTC,I'm more comfortable with Hill as our backup than Cassell or Ponder. He's a very good backup and can still win you games.
minnesotavikings,3az17y,Tullimory,11,Wed Jun 24 17:42:25 2015 UTC,More than Cassell? I'm not so sure about that one. But it's close.
minnesotavikings,3az17y,vbullinger,7,Wed Jun 24 18:43:26 2015 UTC,Well Cassel is rumored to be getting cut by the bills cause he isn't doing well at all.
minnesotavikings,3az17y,InfiniteDeWitt,-1,Wed Jun 24 19:39:28 2015 UTC,I sincerely doubt that.
minnesotavikings,3az17y,vbullinger,2,Wed Jun 24 20:25:31 2015 UTC,You doubt what?  The rumor?
minnesotavikings,3az17y,bainpr,4,Wed Jun 24 21:38:16 2015 UTC,Yep. They won't cut him.
minnesotavikings,3az17y,vbullinger,2,Wed Jun 24 21:49:04 2015 UTC,I don't think they will cut him but a lot of people are saying he is doing pretty badly.
minnesotavikings,3az17y,bainpr,3,Wed Jun 24 21:51:07 2015 UTC,"Ya Cassel has been playing bad and because of that I could see him getting cut but it all has more to do with the fact that he doesn't fit new OC Romans offensive style. In a regular Offense like the Air Coryell or West Coast I think he'd be doing fine but Romans style calls for a mobile QB which Cassel definitely is not, that's why someone like Tyrod Taylor could win the job it's because he's a much better system fit. Hopefully they'll just release him soon enough where he can at least sign on with another team and have some kind of competing chance because he's not gonna make it in this type of system."
minnesotavikings,3az17y,HakunaMatata023,35,Thu Jun 25 01:27:50 2015 UTC,I wouldn't give us an automatic loss like I did before Ponder took the field against Green Bay this year.
minnesotavikings,3az17y,schwertfeger,11,Wed Jun 24 17:38:37 2015 UTC,If it's against GB I'm giving us an automatic loss.   Hell with teddy @Lambeu I'm only going to give us like a 10% chance.

minnesotavikings,3az17y,schwertfeger,0,Wed Jun 24 22:27:00 2015 UTC,That wasnt Ponder's first rodeo. He started like 3 seasons. No excuses for that.

minnesotavikings,3az17y,strallweat,16,Wed Jun 24 22:30:55 2015 UTC,I'm only 2000x more confident in him winning for us than I was with Ponder.

minnesotavikings,3az17y,vbullinger,11,Wed Jun 24 17:23:49 2015 UTC,I'm sorry. I was unaware that Shaun Hill was ever awesome.
minnesotavikings,3az17y,OmahaVike,4,Wed Jun 24 18:43:49 2015 UTC,Touche!
minnesotavikings,3az17y,ull90,8,Wed Jun 24 18:45:19 2015 UTC,"He'd win us some, I'm sure. Not many, though. Luckily, we'd be able to rely heavily on Peterson and the defense. He'd just have to not screw up very often. Hill seems to be a smart, conservative QB, which is why he makes for a good backup. You don't want your backup going out and losing games by turning the ball over. As long as he plays it safe and makes just enough completions that the offense can move down the field at times, we could win some games."
minnesotavikings,3az17y,SeanziHunterelli,3,Wed Jun 24 17:24:38 2015 UTC,"Peterson got Ponder into the playoffs. As long as AP is healthy and running well, anyone taking the helm at QB would have a chance of winning games."
minnesotavikings,3az17y,naphini,5,Wed Jun 24 20:16:33 2015 UTC,I literally have no idea.
minnesotavikings,3az17y,Sellasella123,2,Wed Jun 24 21:00:32 2015 UTC,Check out some of the stuff he did last year in STL. I think the evidence shows he can be a decent backup
minnesotavikings,3az17y,AlongCamePollyIsBae,2,Wed Jun 24 22:50:06 2015 UTC,"No idea, and I don't care. If Teddy goes down, the season is over IMO."
minnesotavikings,3az17y,pingpongguy,3,Thu Jun 25 05:38:18 2015 UTC,I hope we don't see him but there are much worse backups than Shaun Hill. I like him a lot as a player.
minnesotavikings,3az17y,Arkios,2,Wed Jun 24 20:27:17 2015 UTC,"He actually was playing pretty well last year before he went down and Davis had to come in for the Rams.   He was also decent when he was starting for the Niners. He's not phenomenal by any means, but he's a strong backup with starting experience.   I would much rather have Hill as backup, than a rookie that is being ""groomed"". I think he's actually an improvement over Cassel."
minnesotavikings,3az17y,legendoflink3,2,Wed Jun 24 20:51:45 2015 UTC,"As long as AP, Jerrick and the O-line are good. We can depend on him."
minnesotavikings,3az17y,penberkins,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:21:37 2015 UTC,I would say he would be able to go .500 during any extended stretch. Depends who the opponents are.
minnesotavikings,3az17y,ElMorono,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:47:20 2015 UTC,I think he's ok. I'd still rather have T-Jax back. Sad he resigned with the Hawks.

minnesotavikings,3az17y,phd2k1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:20:26 2015 UTC,"This concerns me as well. Last year we saw a dominant team in Arizona fall to complete shit after losing Carson Palmer, then Drew Stanton, and some key pieces on defense. That team went from having a first round bye locked up, to a complete dumpster fire by the end of the season. I would hate for that to happen to us.  Depth is really important in the NFL, so I hope Hill is a solid backup if anything unforeseen happens to Teddy."
minnesotavikings,3az17y,nomaam05,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:41:26 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly confident in him. Not to the point where I think he will be able to win as many games as I think Teddy will, but Hill as shown himself to be quite a competent backup."
minnesotavikings,3az17y,chronophage,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:33:21 2015 UTC,He's got about 6-8 quality quarters in him.

minnesotavikings,3az17y,whambamthankyoulamb,4,Wed Jun 24 17:21:09 2015 UTC,"Any reason why?  He's got experience in Norv's system, which is a huge plus.  Hill isn't going to win us any games.  On the flip side, I don't think he chokes and loses us any.  He'd be able to win with good support from the defense and run game."
minnesotavikings,3az17y,DirtD4er,3,Wed Jun 24 18:17:33 2015 UTC,I really think he's terrible.  Seems to be a minority opinion; I'd rather have Cassel or Ponder than him.

minnesotavikings,3az17y,vbullinger,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:17:32 2015 UTC,He looked solid those seven minutes he wasn't injured last year.
minnesotavikings,3az17y,DirtD4er,2,Wed Jun 24 20:23:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't necessarily have a good reason.  I just really don't trust him.  Why, I'm not 100% sure I can explain"
minnesotavikings,3az17y,ThatCatisaFish,2,Wed Jun 24 20:25:21 2015 UTC,Does it have anything to do with him stepping in for an injured Carson Palmer and crushing the Bengals' playoff chances years back?   He's a solid backup. He's got starting experience and he's got experience in Norv's system. I can still appreciate your point of view though.
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,nomaam05,9,Wed Jun 24 15:49:05 2015 UTC,"Wobby's talked up Theilen a lot in recent articles.  Unless a couple of guys really drop off in camp/the preseason, it feels like this could be one of the more difficult to predict final cuts in recent history. We have a handful of guys who are either not going to be practice squad eligible, or who are unlikely to survive cuts to make the practice squad, competing for a small number of roster spots on each side of the ball."
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,istasber,9,Wed Jun 24 16:05:07 2015 UTC,I'm putting my money on us keeping 6. Wallace Johnson Wright Patterson Diggs Thielen. We had 6 last year until Simpson got suspended right?  Edit: autocorrect mis spell.
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,jtmcginty,8,Wed Jun 24 18:16:41 2015 UTC,What a crew.
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,Calendar_Girl,6,Wed Jun 24 18:27:49 2015 UTC,"2014's final 53  We carried 6 while Simpson was suspended, because he didn't count for a roster spot. We cut him before his suspension was over, and picked up Johnson a few days after we cut Simpson.  We only had 6 WRs on the active roster for the ~two weeks between when we signed Charles Johnson (Sept. 20) and when we released Rodney Smith (Oct 2).  I think Theilen's a lot more valuable than a guy like Smith was, and we shouldn't have to carry 2 FBs this year, and may not even need to keep one with how little we used one last year. On the other hand, we probably have 4 TEs worth keeping rather than just 2, and how much OL depth we'll keep is a pretty big question mark right now."
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,istasber,5,Wed Jun 24 18:39:41 2015 UTC,He won't make the squad.. .I'd almost put a bet on it
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,All_Day88,5,Wed Jun 24 17:42:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna make that bet, but I think he's got a shot. We've basically got 3 ""sure-things"" at wide receiver (Wallace, Johnson, Wright).  I agree that Theilen's spot is probably the least safe of the other 3, but he's probably got more all-around value as a backup, blocker, returner and special teams player than other offensive long-shots (Ford, Line, Banyard, etc.). Linesmen might provide some competition, we likely want a lot of depth there after what happened last season, and I could see bubble players either being ineligible for the practice squad, or tough to sneak through.  Theilen's biggest competition might actually be on the defensive side of the ball, though. The uncertainty at some positions and the fact that we've got old guys (Newman, Greenway and Robison) figuring to have significant playing time, might make us want to keep more deep depth on the defensive roster."
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,istasber,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:04:39 2015 UTC,What about special teams?
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,uncommonpanda,3,Wed Jun 24 21:28:46 2015 UTC,"Taking that unto consideration too.  I really dont think he'll be on the team.  Unpopular opinion, probably, but that's my opinion"
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,All_Day88,3,Wed Jun 24 22:08:09 2015 UTC,"Thielen has been talked up a lot for 3 straight preseasons. He's gotten on the field, but how's he going to get on the field ahead of Wallace, Wright, Diggs, Patterson, and Charles Johnson? He's not.   Charles Johnson already beat him out. He was brought in late last offseason and started over Thielen, so Thielen isn't going to start over him. Wallace is in until he's released due to underperformance. Wright has been good while on the field.   You know, maybe you'll see Johnson, Wallace, Thielen on the field as the top three. Maaaaybe he can beat out Wright, and Diggs won't pan out, and they'll give up on Patterson, but that's a long shot."
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,spacezookeeper,3,Wed Jun 24 23:54:49 2015 UTC,"I don't get this idea that there's zero value in keeping a guy around if he's not a starter. Thielen played last year because players ahead of him got hurt or benched, the same thing could happen this year as well.  We'll keep 6 WRs if our 6th best receiver adds more value (either short term or long term) to the team, overall, than our 4th best RB or 4th best TE or 6th best CB or whatever. That could very well be the case this year, especially if a receiver (Patterson, Diggs or Thielen) is also returning punts."
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,istasber,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:21:01 2015 UTC,you missed the idea
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,spacezookeeper,2,Thu Jun 25 00:27:18 2015 UTC,I guess I did. Were you just arguing that he's not as good as the other receivers? I don't think you'll get any argument from me there. I still think he's got a good shot of making the team.
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,istasber,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:43:21 2015 UTC,It's irrelevant if he does well in camp because he'll never see the field to showcase his ability that he's supposedly showing in camp
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,spacezookeeper,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:17:57 2015 UTC,"It isn't irrelevant, though.  If he didn't have decent camps in the past few years, he's not even with the team for us to be discussing this.  Obviously the coaches see his value for WR depth in case of injury, or special teams play if nothing else.  Are you saying that if a guy can't expect to be getting quality playing time (not even just starting), that he holds no value to the team?  Are you saying Thielen's NFL success is predicated on him getting regular playing time?  If you're simply saying that Thielen won't be everything everybody hopes he's cracked up to be, you'd get no argument here, though."
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,BigPaulAndy,2,Thu Jun 25 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"You're not explaining yourself that well.  I agree with /u/istasber, in the sense of valuing Thielen's potential contribution versus that of a 4th TE (for example) will be the determining factor.  Thielen doesn't need guaranteed snaps to secure a roster spot or ""prove himself"", he just has to be better depth than other positional depth across the roster."
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,BigPaulAndy,5,Thu Jun 25 15:48:09 2015 UTC,"Depending on how many we keep, I still don't see a place for Sherels. I haven't heard ANYTHING about him... Am I just missing something? Where is he?"
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,cadderly09,3,Wed Jun 24 18:46:21 2015 UTC,"Priefer's basically said that Sherels is really good and he's definitely the guy to beat for punt returner. That's in contrast to Patterson, who he said, in his eyes, is easily the best KR in the league.  Sherels name was also left out in a few articles on vikings.com that discussed CB depth.  You gotta wonder if he'll be able to make the team on PR ability alone, even if he is the best returner by a fair margin."
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,istasber,3,Thu Jun 25 03:05:57 2015 UTC,I want to see Cole and Kendricks on the field together.
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,legendoflink3,4,Wed Jun 24 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Nothing against Hodges but I think Barr/Cole/Kendricks might be a better lineup than Barr/Kendricks/Hodges. Based on what I've seen of all three, I think their skillsets would mesh better."
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,McRawffles,2,Wed Jun 24 21:03:11 2015 UTC,Let's hope zimmer thinks the same and if he doesn't then in zims we trust.
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,legendoflink3,3,Wed Jun 24 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's going to be Barr/Kendricks/Greenway this year. It's Greenway's last year and he can help Kendricks learn more by being on the field with him. We know Barr came along SUPER fast last year but that doesn't mean Kendricks will adapt as quickly, and might need some guidance."
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,McRawffles,2,Thu Jun 25 00:33:34 2015 UTC,"After last season, shouldn't Patterson be on this list? I understand Theilen being a walk on but he played more than CP did last year. Shouldn't this be 8 Vikings with something to prove?"
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,Docta608,3,Thu Jun 25 13:26:02 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. What he brings to Kickoff returns (not to mention, the run game), even though he regressed last year, is far more valuable than Theilen's play on Special teams, IMO."
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,Docta608,2,Thu Jun 25 13:28:01 2015 UTC,"I can't disagree with that but at the same time, what he was vs. what he should have been is disgusting. I understand he has been given time due to his age, athleticism and how little he knew on route running coming into the NFL, but it is still a make or break deal for him this year, at least in Minnesota."
minnesotavikings,3ayokm,ThatOneBadassGuy,2,Thu Jun 25 13:31:44 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely, if he doesn't get it together this season, I'd be willing to be he's gone."

minnesotavikings,3ayokm,TheHypemanCometh,5,Wed Jun 24 17:27:15 2015 UTC,"I mean....there is an actual list printed.    OL Babatunde Aiyegbusi The signing of the 6-9 Polish OL caught fire within the Vikings fan base and curiosity about Babs’ progress and prospects for 2015 remains high. Contact restrictions during the offseason program make it difficult to truly evaluate the progress of most players, but particularly in the trenches with the DL and OL. Training camp offers a true test, though, so Babs will be a player to watch in Mankato this summer. LB Audie Cole Cole has already far exceeded the expectations of a seventh-round pick, but that only leaves everyone wanting more from him. Although he racks up the tackles when he’s put in the lineup, he’s been unable to secure a starting job to this point. And now, a second-round rookie – Eric Kendricks – is expected to take the bulk of first-team reps at Mike LB heading into training camp. Expect Cole to have another impressive training camp (and preseason) and make the competition for the starting Mike LB job a tight one. OL Mike Harris Acquiring and developing depth along the OL is a priority for the Vikings, and Harris could be a central figure in that effort because of his position flexibility. If he can build on his playing experience from last season by having a strong training camp, Harris could be an every-week active player because of his ability to play either RG or RT should injury strike either of the starters. QB Mike Kafka In the battle for the third QB spot, can we assume a tie goes to rookie Taylor Heinicke? With an established starter and a veteran backup, you can’t blame the Vikings for wanting the 3rd guy to be a development project. If so, Kafka will need an impressive training camp and preseason to beat the Old Dominion product out of a job. LT Matt Kalil Confidence is building in Kalil. Vikings Head Coach Mike Zimmer said last week that Kalil looks more comfortable on the field, and that is good news for the Vikings. After a tumultuous early-season stretch in 2014, Kalil turned things around and finished well over the final eight games. With increasing confidence and health, Kalil is poised to arrive at training camp ready to roll and square off against Everson Griffen, the team’s sack leader in 2014, on a day-to-day basis, which will only help him prepare to face other talented pass rushers in the regular season. CB Captain Munnerlyn The Vikings suddenly have quality depth at CB. Munnerlyn is part of that, but the veteran should beware of younger players who have upside taking his spot on the roster. It didn’t help that an injury sidelined Munnerlyn for much of the OTA schedule and all of minicamp, but once he arrives in Mankato Munnerlyn can get right back on track with a solid showing to retain his role as a veteran leader in the CB room. WR Adam Thielen The competition is thick at WR. The additions of Stefon Diggs via the draft and Mike Wallace via trade have increased the talent level, there is optimism that Cordarrelle Patterson has improved, and both Charles Johnson and Jarius Wright are emerging difference-makers in Norv Turner’s scheme. But don’t shortchange Thielen. It’s hard to walk away from a Vikings practice and not be impressed with him. He has proven himself time and again in Mankato, first as a member of the Minnesota State University Mavericks football team and lately as a member of the Vikings. With sure hands, better-than-you-think speed and quality route running on top of the ability to contribute in multiple phases of special teams, Thielen is a good bet to impress at training camp."

CB Gabrielle Douglas - Signed him to a good amount of guaranteed money, so he will likely make the team. Amazing play making and balance.  ILB EJ Henderson-   A former viking returns to solidify the middle. Should provide good depth in case Kendricks doesn't pick up the position quickly, or moved to WLB. He has always been known for his run stopping and should be a great addition this year. Love you big guy!  CB Marcus Trufant- I am surprised more people around here are not excited about this signing. Sure, he is old 34, but if our CB Terrance Newman has gas left in the tank at 38, Trufant should be able to lock down the dime CB for us. Great signing!  Good list so far, with the other comments and mine I think you have a complete list of our major FA signings this year."

"" the actual speed of the receivers only constitutes one dimension of their ability, and in some cases, a small dimension at that"" ""there is no shame in taking second in a generally meaningless competition anyway.""

To me, that means Teddy'd have to be at that point. And Fran was considered to be one of the greatest ever, as his hall of fame status shows. He was the all-time leader in most passing stats until the nfl started to become more pass-oriented.  Edit: to clarify, I'm not down on Teddy or anything. I'm not even saying he's not going to be special. I'm saying that there's probably no QB in the league that could have made a hall of fame case by their third or fourth year."

Although, if Daunte hadn't gotten his knee blow out by a cheap shot from a Carolina's DB, I think we would be talking him up a lot more. Remember, he had a MVP-like season in 2004. Damn, it would have been nice to see him have a 15 year career with the Vikes. Chances are the organization would have tried to keep Randy had Culpepper not gotten hurt. Granted he was having a subpar season. But a nagging knee issue, Matt Birk out for the season and his alleged involvement in the Love Boat incident, more than likely contributed to this poor start. In the long haul, I think he would have been a Viking great."

minnesotavikings,3aw7zj,whywoodley,37,Wed Jun 24 13:33:06 2015 UTC,That was a fantastic video. Probably the best video editing I've seen for Viking's content in a long time. The thing that really stood out to me is that the producer took so many of the plays that we know and love (or hate) and showed them to us from an angle that we have never seen. Almost every single play came from an angle that I had not seen at least.

minnesotavikings,3awzoj,TheDandyWarhol,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:52:59 2015 UTC,You're wrong. NFL Rules Article 9(a)8: It is a foul if a player initiates unnecessary contact against a player who is in a defenseless posture. A defenseless posture is defined as ...  A player who receives a “blindside” block when the blocker is moving toward his own endline and approaches the opponent from behind or from the side.     Penalty: For unnecessary roughness: Loss of 15 yards. The player may be disqualified if the action is judged by the official(s) to be flagrant.     Edit: Dunno why you guys are downing /u/seenunseen. This is a perfectly legitimate response/question to a rule that has been continually evolving before our eyes over the course of the last three years.
minnesotavikings,3awzoj,JohnathanTheBrave,3,Wed Jun 24 18:21:13 2015 UTC,How is that unnecessary contact?
minnesotavikings,3awzoj,seenunseen,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:24:54 2015 UTC,"Same Link NFL Rules: Rule 12, Section 2 Article 8(e) and Article 8(j):      There shall be no unnecessary roughness. This shall include, but will not be limited to:    (e) unnecessarily running, diving into, cutting, or throwing the body against or on a player who (i) is out of the play or (ii) should not have reasonably anticipated such contact by an opponent, before or after the ball is dead; or throwing the runner to the ground after the ball is dead;    (j) if a player illegally launces into a defenseless opponent. It is an illegal launch if a player (1) leaves both feet prior to contact to spring forward and upward into his opponent and (2) uses any part of his helmet (including the top/crown and forehead/""hairline"" parts to initiate forcible contact against any part of his opponents body.       Chris obviously leaves his feet, and uses the crown of his helmet to forcibly strike his opponent and its pretty obvious considering the way the player took the hit (fencing response) that ""he should not have reasonably anticipated such contact by an opponent, before ... the ball was dead"". This is textbook unnecessary roughness since the beginning of last season."
minnesotavikings,3awzoj,JohnathanTheBrave,2,Wed Jun 24 18:54:33 2015 UTC,"I really disagree. I do not see him launching, he just runs into him and does not lead with his helmet, he hits him with his shoulder. As far as him reasonably expecting to be hit like that, I would say if you are making a play on the ball carrier than you should always reasonably expect a blocker to get in the way."

minnesotavikings,3awzoj,ChipThaBlackBoy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:52:02 2015 UTC,"I think you're right that there's a chance that he doesn't make contact with the defender's head, in which case it wouldn't be a penalty.  It's hard to tell from these replay angles, though, and there's a chance that the top of Walsh's head hit's right around the jaw of the defender's facemask.  Refs are so cautious about this stuff nowadays that I don't think they'd risk it, especially with the guy getting laid out, and would just throw the flag."

This shall include, but will not be limited to:    (e) unnecessarily running, diving into, cutting, or throwing the body against or on a player who (i) is out of the play or (ii) should not have reasonably anticipated such contact by an opponent, before or after the ball is dead; or throwing the runner to the ground after the ball is dead;      Edit: I think it's a pretty bogus writing because ""reasonable anticipation of such contact"" is vague as hell especially when you're on a 120x53 1/3 yd gridiron where everyone's goal is to either put the ball in the endzone by any means possible (keeping defenders off my guy aka I'll lay ya out) or keep the ball as far away from the endzone by any means possible aka I'll lay ya out. So shouldn't the expectation be that on any given play I could absolutely get my bell rung?"

Zimmer has depended on him for a very long time. I'm curious whether in TC we see Waynes eating into his reps at all, or if they put him in the slot with Newman and Rhodes outside.   In the end the best thing is there are a ton of looks they can put together with the depth we have, something which couldn't be said last year"
minnesotavikings,3aws0v,EarnestQuestion,2,Wed Jun 24 03:33:40 2015 UTC,"Ya it's crazy to think someone at that age and playing that position can still be as effective as he's been. He was a signing that I was really happy about, I know a lot of Vikes fans saw him more as just a teacher and someone who wouldn't make the team but he's still playing good ball and has been a starter for Cinnci even when they had some young high Draft picks around him and he can be an effective piece on our D as well as mentor to the youngsters.  I love Rhodes and our new Draft pick Waynes and think both will do good for us but still believe that Newman will get some solid minutes on D."

Munnerlyn starts in the slot. Waynes starts next year after Newman's gone. Robinson still rides pine despite his growth but we're happy with our depth instead of scared to death of it, as I have been for years."
minnesotavikings,3aws0v,vbullinger,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:46:18 2015 UTC,"They could also have Price or Munnerlyn as the slot guy, but have Waynes spell Newman in the Nickel situations to ease Waynes into an outside role more slowly than if he was the #2 corner in the base defense.  But yeah, we should have crazy depth on both sides of the ball this year, unless players take a serious step back when the pads go on. It'll be interesting to see if they do anything with that level of depth (like more rotational play than just keeping the starters in there for 90+% of the snaps when healthy)."
minnesotavikings,3aws0v,istasber,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:32:15 2015 UTC,"Great point about the slot, I'm curious who the dime/#2 nickel is.

Zimmer seems to really think highly of him (and for good reason)"
minnesotavikings,3aws0v,EarnestQuestion,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:43:22 2015 UTC,"Probably Robinson.  I'm not completely against it, he's shown improvement every year.  He's fast enough to keep up with most slot receivers.  He does seem to struggle without the sideline's help though."

minnesotavikings,3auwqs,pugwarrior,51,Tue Jun 23 18:28:56 2015 UTC,"1) He's only crossed the 1800 yard threshold once in his career, in a year where he was virtually our entire offense for half of the season.  2) We've got a more balanced team around him, so we won't need to run as often or as much. Our years with Favre (when we actually had competent QB play - 2009 and 2010) he only rushed for 1383 and 1298 yards, respectively.  3) We've got a capable backup in McKinnon who should see the field a good bit.  4) Peterson has had a year off, which could either mean he comes back rested, or he comes back rusty. If he's rusty, it may take him some time to get up to speed again.  5) He's 30, which is when runningbacks begin to decline.  Now I could certainly see him having a season like 2013 with 1200-1400 yards or so. And if he comes out angry and well-rested (like I hope), he's got a chance to approach 2000. But it's unlikely he does that since we shouldn't have to rely on the run game as much as we did in 2012, unless Bridgewater goes down.  My prediction would be anywhere between 1200-1400 yards."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,VikesRule,8,Tue Jun 23 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"5) He's 30, which is when runningbacks begin to decline.   Decent points except for this one. This magical age of ""30"" is often quoted as being the time RBs decline, but in reality it's the amount of carries that a RB receives that wears him down in his elder years, and 30 is just a convenient age where RBs tend to accumulate that many touches."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,MostlyUselessFacts,2,Tue Jun 23 22:04:26 2015 UTC,I'm guessing you haven't turned 30... It's a newly disappointing world as far as your body is concerned.
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,proves,3,Wed Jun 24 23:24:22 2015 UTC,"It's mainly the gradual loss of elasticity in the muscles and tendons that slows them down.  That comes from age, not use.  It's not a kind of ""wearing"", it's a cellular change that happens to everyone, whether they run footballs or do accounting.  It begins well before the age of 30 - more like the mid-twenties."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,OldNedder,11,Wed Jun 24 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"We actually don't WANT any more than about 1400 yards.  That implies that something is seriously broken when our offense, unless he's just getting 80 yard run after 80 yard run."

minnesotavikings,3auwqs,jjspaceman,5,Tue Jun 23 19:26:11 2015 UTC,But the Seahawks #2 RB (Turbin?) did get some carries. A change-of-pace back can make a big difference in the right situation.
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,Waffleradio,3,Tue Jun 23 20:37:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he had like a 4th of the RB carries over the last two years."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,nomaam05,3,Tue Jun 23 20:07:44 2015 UTC,"My point is that, just like Turbin did not impact the overall production of Lynch because when the game was on the line and they needed yards, they gave it to Lynch   What? Turbin had over 150 carries in the last two years. That ABSOLUTELY impacted Lynch's overall production, there's really no debating that. 75 extra carries last year takes Lynch from 1306 yards, to 1658 yards."

Of course they are going to give it to Lynch in a goal to go scenario, that has nothing to do with whether or not Turbin gets meaningful rushing attempts."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,Vukomanovich,8,Tue Jun 23 20:25:44 2015 UTC,"we're running an play action bubble screen to Wallace/Johnson/Patterson   If you don't give McKinnon any touches you may as well tell everyone you are passing the ball when you sub him in. He shouldn't be getting 10-15 a game, but he certainly needs a few, otherwise it is a dead give away.   Just like everyone knew the Saints were going to run the ball when Jimmy subbed off."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,Vukomanovich,2,Tue Jun 23 20:49:12 2015 UTC,"Your also assuming that what I meant was every time we throw the ball we should sub in McKinnon,   I am not assuming that at all, all I am saying is that play action passes are not effective if you don't actually give the running back the ball once and a while. Everyone who is not assigned to cover him will learn to ignore him quickly.    why would you put McKinnon in if you know your running the ball and Adrian is good to go?   Because it adds a wrinkle to our offense, and makes the defense question what we are doing. McKinnon is no slouch.    Edit/Addition: you said so yourself, he won't get many carries; and certainly not many on key drives, so how is that a factor in how many yards AP will get?   You are responding to someone else, I said nothing about APs yards. My entire point is that if you do not give him any touches there is no point in playing him outside of obvious passing situations, as he will be a dead give away to everyone in the stadium as soon as he steps on the field."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,Vukomanovich,3,Tue Jun 23 20:53:06 2015 UTC,"(and I'm always surprising myself that I never learn on this sub to be so explicit that there is not room for sidetrakcing)   Its funny that you would say this, because your original statement was not explicit at all. You did not even hint at ""the point you were trying to make in the first place"". Do not be so dismissive, especially not when you fail to make your point clear.   The original comment was a list of reasons why the commenter thought AP would rush between 1200 and 1400 yards. You responded with   No offense, because I see what you're getting at, but I'm gonna go ahead and say that if you're putting McKinnon out there instead of AP, All Day better be injured, or we better be up by 30 points.   Capping off with.    But for christ's sake, if we're running off-tackle AP is getting the damn ball.   One can make an argument that you were tangentially making the point that Mickinnon's production will not be enough to significantly alter Adrian's. However, your comment is suggesting that Jerrick is not deserving of any touches. Which given the love for AP on this sub would not be a surprising opinion. I simply provided a reason why he would be deserving of a few rushing attempts per game. You then felt the need to argue, further suggesting that your opinion is that Mickinnon is not deserving.    A much better way to word ""the point you were trying to make in the first place"" would be ""Mickinnion will not see enough attempts to significantly reduce Adrian's production"", not "" if you're putting McKinnon out there instead of AP, All Day better be injured, or we better be up by 30 points."" The first is a completely valid point, it is unlikely that he will see many touches (Tourbin only got 74 in Seattle and Toby only had 34 his last year in town)   Edit: Looking at the rest of the conversation based on your comment it seems pretty clear that the problem here is not me sidetracking, but you failing to convey your message."

minnesotavikings,3auwqs,nomaam05,4,Tue Jun 23 19:48:31 2015 UTC,"It's because of both, dude. No ones saying they will evenly split carries or anything, but if you think McKinnon is walking away from this season with 20 or 30 carries, you're nuts."

minnesotavikings,3auwqs,nomaam05,2,Tue Jun 23 22:14:03 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what the reason is, the bottom line is he isn't going to be getting more than 280 touches and historically with him that means 1200-1300 yds and 10-12 tds. That's what I expect to happen."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,Zepher2228,3,Wed Jun 24 01:49:30 2015 UTC,"theres really no need to downvote this, just don't upvote it if you don't agree with him. Personally I agree with some of what he's saying, I've said before that I love McKinnon and honestly I see him as our eventual replacement RB1, but at this stage AP is a better option than, well, anyone. By the way, Norv Turner has said they will be giving AP less touches, but not less carries. I.E. occasionally use AP for blocking/pass plays, occasionally use McKinnon. I like this because even a cyborg like AP wears down eventually, and although it might key in you're probably going to pass when McKinnon is in, that means you can get away with some sweet dump offs or draw plays if you only pull them once a game or so, and eventually people will respect McKinnon as a rushing threat even if he doesn't typically rush. I mean, the guy is a proven NFL-caliber starter, he just happens to be behind the depth chart behind a motherfucking legend."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,Imbrandnewhere,-1,Wed Jun 24 12:24:39 2015 UTC,"Right on point, and oddly enough your post has 28 points so I am not going to upvote it.   That said, I expect around the same in yards, but I also expect an uptick in TD's this year, closer to 15."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,Dorkamundo,12,Tue Jun 23 19:49:00 2015 UTC,I think the only thing that could hold him back this season is touches. I don't think he's going to get enough of them for him to reach those kinds of heights.
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,youvebeengreggd,4,Tue Jun 23 19:51:26 2015 UTC,"This is what I think most fans don't understand.  AP is a great RB, but he's 30 and isn't very good (not terrible, but not great) at catching the ball, which is a huge part of Norv's offense.  Personally, I think we are deep enough on offense this year that having AP out there for 3 downs isn't really necessary.  Why not keep him fresh for the playoffs and spread the ball around?  Our QB isn't terrible.  Our WR core is, in my opinion, highly underrated.  All signs are pointing to an improved O-line this year.  There's no need for AP to get 300 carries.  Let's all sit back and appreciate having a balanced offense for once."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,HoneyBucket-,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:58:57 2015 UTC,It will be better for the remainder of his career anyway that he gets about 50 less touches or so.
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,youvebeengreggd,5,Tue Jun 23 20:07:33 2015 UTC,Even 1800 yards from scrimmage seems like a stretch to me at this point. They already said he's not going to carries like he used to.
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,nomaam05,5,Tue Jun 23 20:10:41 2015 UTC,"My thought is this. When he was all we had, he would run three times for no yards, then rip off a 20 yard run for a 5 ypa. But that was with 8 to 9 man boxes. They basically played AD every play. But now, with a passing game, they won't necessarily know when he is going to run. So he will get two or three attempts and still rip one off for 15 or 20 yards. Same yards, fewer carries."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,Deserveyourneed,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:39:27 2015 UTC,"This is what I've been thinking as well. AD had his career year when he was our whole offense. With there finally being a QB that'll make defense's respect the pass, no more 8 man fronts and the play action can and will make all the defenders look stupid haha"
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,asdfgh12045,6,Tue Jun 23 20:59:22 2015 UTC,Teddy is going to be passing so well we won't use AD as much.  I think AD will get 1300 yards.

minnesotavikings,3auwqs,shack026,3,Tue Jun 23 19:57:13 2015 UTC,I think if we need AP to rush for 1800 yards we are in trouble.  Our offense should be much more balanced than that this year.

minnesotavikings,3auwqs,notnicholas,2,Tue Jun 23 18:33:29 2015 UTC,I think 1400 is an accurate over/under betting line if he starts every game.

minnesotavikings,3auwqs,MightySasquatch,2,Tue Jun 23 20:08:52 2015 UTC,"You're wrong because he's rushing for 2,150 yards and 2600 total yards giving him both yards from scrimmage and the rushing total leader AND being the first running back to have 2x 2,000 yard seasons."

A 1600 year is really great for a rb, so what makes us think he'll get that at 30? In 2013 he looked a slower than past Adrian. I can only imagine two years later"
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,sedgwickian,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:04:56 2015 UTC,"Too low. During the first game, he runs his first touch through the endzone, reaching Superman-like speeds, causing time itself to shift. Not only does he use this to rush for 2000 yards this season, but he also goes back in time to erase the cause of his suspension so he can run for 2500 last year. Then, goes back to the 70s in order to suit up for those 3 Super Bowls with Tarkenton (he is, of course, dominant). Finally, he makes a quick stop-off in '89 to talk Mike Lynn out of the Herschel trade, which leads to a dominant run for the Vikings in the '90s with Emmitt Smith, Alvin Harper, and Darren Woodsen. Vikings become America's team. Dallas burns to the ground.  I mean, so long as we're pitching unrealistic fantasies, we might as well go big."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,sand0789,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:09:07 2015 UTC,"He averages 1500 yards a season, if you ignore the year he tore his ACL and last season when he played only one game.  If you assume that Peterson's age isn't yet a factor, and that Turner's offense will give Peterson the type of carries that Musgrave/Bevell provided in the past, then 1500 yards ought to be your over/under.  He has played 6 seasons in my average above (eliminating the ACL and switch years).  In those 6 seasons, he hit 2000 yards one year and 1760 yards another year.  So basically in 1/3 of those seasons he hit 1800 yards (I mean, 1760 is friggen close enough for what we're doing here).  I don't think 1800 yards is outrageous.  In my opinion, he has about a 20% chance of getting there.  The team has already said that they want to keep his snaps down, and it is possible that he will get less carries per game than typical.  Peterson has always put up good yards per carries, quite frankly, and how many yards he get will probably have more to do with the carries he gets than anything else.  Turner does have a good track record for RB's with great yards from scrimmage.  My personal feeling on this is that Peterson will have a great year, but that he will receive for more yards than in the past and overall he'll put up a yards from scrimmage total that is in the top half of his best seasons.    I have him on 1500 yards rushing, 12 total touchdowns, and 650 yards receivering.  5 yards per carry and 18.75 carries per game.  Basically I have him on a huge season.  Just not huge in terms of pure rushing yards."
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,MN_hydroplane,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:22:17 2015 UTC,it's really hard to land on a nice round number like 1800.  I would say it's more likely he would end up with 1785 or 1806.  Just my take anyways.
minnesotavikings,3auwqs,KushedCudi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:37:07 2015 UTC,"I'm going 1,600. He's just not going to touch the ball enough to get that many yards and I think even 1,600 is generous"

Watching that late 80's team brings back so many memories. Can't believe its been almost 30 years!  Watching Nelson DROP IT in that Championship game still kills me all these years later. Right in his hands and it was a first down even if he didn't cross the goal line. I watched the final drive the other day. That drop is still a punch to the gut.  I also made the mistake of watching one of the Viking superbowls. Ugh.

I want to read at least somewhat objective takes on how the team is looking from outsiders. Question marks won't be given any credence when the article is written by Wobschall.  For example:    The line will be fine    Will it? I'm not so sure. They aren't even in pads yet and there is a lot of personnel movement in that area. This sounds like the team trying to reassure people that everything is fine here. The reality could be starkly different. Regardless, I'd want someone like Arif or even the guys from 1500espn to write how the line is looking.  Keep putting up insider videos of the team and leave the analysis to analysts Wobby."

While he can be a bit more objective, KFAN did lose their contract with a squad (T-wolves maybe? Does anyone remember?) for not totting the company line, a few years back.   And PA, deep down, is insecure because he's not from here. So, he tries to play the homer card a bit too hard. But, he does have good access, so, it's worth it. As is some of what Wobby says."

minnesotavikings,3arfc9,youvebeengreggd,2,Tue Jun 23 11:11:02 2015 UTC,"I love podcasts, but no. There just isn't enough real content out there. I might listen to a once a week thing that breaks down the game in serious detail, but you guys would have to actually know football. That isnt even best served as a podcast, more like a video wrapup."
minnesotavikings,3arfc9,FlannelBeard,2,Tue Jun 23 02:35:51 2015 UTC,I only have a very limited brain space for podcasts because most of them are horrificly bad.  So...I honestly can't say I would definitely listen. I might...but probably not.
minnesotavikings,3arfc9,noseonarug17,2,Tue Jun 23 02:53:28 2015 UTC,"I listen to a number of podcasts so I would, but I know im in the minority. I spend a ton of time at work in an are with no cell or wifi so I download podcasts to help the boredom."
minnesotavikings,3arfc9,uponplane,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:23:24 2015 UTC,"/u/PKS_5, /u/KushedCudi, and I briefly talked last offseason about doing one. I think that could be a real fun lineup, especially with guests, but it hasn't been brought up in a year. And honestly, I don't know that I would listen to a /r/minnesotavikings podcast. Maybe if it was hosted by my favorite users."
minnesotavikings,3arfc9,Waffleradio,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:48:04 2015 UTC,"I'd be interested in participating in one, considering I graduated with a degree in broadcasting. I've thought about doing a podcast for some time but no one to do it with. Problem that I'm not in Minnesota??"

minnesotavikings,3arfc9,uponplane,2,Tue Jun 23 23:41:05 2015 UTC,"Genuine. Naturally a podcast like Hardcore History (ie a successful one) has support staff, but it's one voice doing the talking (Dan Carlin's). That's what I was referring to.  My point is that you can't start off expecting to have a team people on the tech side or to fact check or whatever. Just set up a mic and make some notes and get a rough take done. Not having a team of people doesn't prevent you from giving podcasts a stab. If you get something made, people will want a part of it."

minnesotavikings,3astye,cadderly09,6,Tue Jun 23 11:23:27 2015 UTC,Iv'e bought 30+ jersey from this aliexpress. 100% recommend actually sad you can get 10 jersey's for the price of 1 here

Its been to TCF and worn at home/to the bar for most games last year. Holding up quite well IMO.  https://imgur.com/gallery/DB1Nc/new"
minnesotavikings,3astye,WhiskeyRacer,2,Tue Jun 23 15:21:36 2015 UTC,Just order that exact jersey a few days ago from AliExpress. How long does it typically take for it to arrive? Mine looks like it is still in China.
minnesotavikings,3astye,datekman,6,Tue Jun 23 16:20:56 2015 UTC,A couple of weeks usually.  The fastest I've ever got a package was about 6 days back when it was Alibaba
minnesotavikings,3astye,Newport_100s,3,Tue Jun 23 16:44:47 2015 UTC,Hey there are some fake Aimee smiths on that site. Make sure you buy from the real one! I learned the hard way and ended up getting a piece of shit jersey.
minnesotavikings,3astye,JennaTill,4,Tue Jun 23 17:58:42 2015 UTC,"Depends on your stance on counterfeits because that aimee chick makes some good ones.  After spending, well, thousands of dollars on legit jerseys over the years...to be honest I'll be buying them from aimee from here on out.    I just got an elite AD Jersey a few months ago for $300 and had buyers remorse (because of price not player) almost right away.  Quality is amazing but still.  It's just too much.  The normal $100 ones quality suck imo, and I wouldn't be surprised if one of those aimee counterfeits are better quality than the normal $100 non stitched Nike ones the NFL sells"

minnesotavikings,3astye,ygrohmanx,2,Wed Jul 1 03:23:50 2015 UTC,"My advice will be get one from China for cheap,22 bucks,and if really his last season with team.won't be a big lost."

minnesotavikings,3ar5uo,Rufusking1,2,Tue Jun 23 04:01:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I get that his game plan was focused around Peterson (and a healthy Cassel) last year, so I've got to give him some grace there, but it was still pretty disappointing. Hopefully, everyone stays on the field so we can see what Turner is actually capable of."
minnesotavikings,3ar5uo,goldenboots,2,Tue Jun 23 05:29:51 2015 UTC,"He consistently loses HC jobs. He's well respected as an OC, and his track record there is much, much better than as a HC."
minnesotavikings,3ar5uo,MegatonMessiah,2,Tue Jun 23 14:32:57 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the consensus is that he's a bad head coach, but a somewhat effective to very effective offensive coordinator."
minnesotavikings,3aq1z3,Despaire2,24,Mon Jun 22 16:07:52 2015 UTC,Such chills. Best RB of the generation. Anyone else starting to feel the pre-season hype magic of 1998 // 2010? Hopefully the end is better this year.

minnesotavikings,3aq1z3,ILikeLampz,9,Thu Jun 25 02:24:40 2015 UTC,"I wonder why he plows into defenders on the sidelines instead of running out. I think he just enjoys inflicting punishment. Also, not a lot of highlights in the new jersey design."
minnesotavikings,3aq1z3,nautilusnautilus,7,Mon Jun 22 22:46:21 2015 UTC,He wanted to make the last hit. Sent a message to the defenders that he won't go down without a fight.
minnesotavikings,3aq1z3,austhyma,7,Mon Jun 22 23:32:28 2015 UTC,I remember him mentioning that he does it early in the game to make defenders hesitate later so he can beat them with speed and agility.
minnesotavikings,3aq1z3,CederDUDE22,3,Mon Jun 22 23:51:30 2015 UTC,"That's pretty awesome. I hope he starts to conserve his body more so he can be the exception to the rule that RB's begin to decline at 30. Also, with what we know about the effects of taking shots to the head, it would be depressing if Adrian started suffering from mental deterioration.  Which may have already begun (raging on loved ones)."
minnesotavikings,3aq1z3,nautilusnautilus,2,Tue Jun 23 03:17:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure how fast those things set in, but look for it when he's 45. Dementia, alzhiemers, etc. Bad times. I hope he somehow avoids it, but it happens a lot to ex-NFL players."

I'm also excited for the inevitable couple more Vikings that will be on this list. I'm thinking Anthony Barr around 14 and Harrison Smith around 8. Also, you heard it here first, Teddy will be #1."
minnesotavikings,3aq2jo,Webjunky3,5,Mon Jun 22 21:11:19 2015 UTC,I'm not sure Harrison Smith will be on the list since he's probably a unanimous top 10 safety as is.  Barr definitely should be though.

minnesotavikings,3aq2jo,Webjunky3,5,Tue Jun 23 01:05:18 2015 UTC,"He really should already be a super star.  He beat Earl Thomas in every single statistic last season except for assisted tackles, but he made up for that by having like 19 more solo tackles.

minnesotavikings,3aq2jo,IAMTHEDEATHMACHINE,7,Tue Jun 23 02:06:34 2015 UTC,This is awesome. Really happy to see a guy like Johnson getting some attention. Looking forward to his year.
minnesotavikings,3aq2jo,swampsparrow,4,Mon Jun 22 17:32:10 2015 UTC,BEWARE!  I think Patterson was on this list last year
minnesotavikings,3aq2jo,Webjunky3,4,Mon Jun 22 22:31:15 2015 UTC,"He was #1 last year, but to be fair...when they made the list, it was with the assumption that Adrian Peterson would be playing."
minnesotavikings,3aq2jo,swampsparrow,2,Mon Jun 22 22:36:39 2015 UTC,"Peterson playing or not....Patterson had an awful year. He regressed in every aspect of his game, including kick returns (which having Peterson doesn't affect one bit)"
minnesotavikings,3aq2jo,Webjunky3,3,Mon Jun 22 23:20:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but in the 1 week that they had Peterson, Flash had 3 rushes for 102 yards and a TD paired with 3 catches for 26 yards.  Away, against a tough Rams defense.  It seems unfair to assume that losing AD wouldn't have impacted him much considering how well he opened the year with Peterson on the field."
minnesotavikings,3aq2jo,vita10gy,3,Mon Jun 22 23:29:38 2015 UTC,"We also for some reason decided to stop manufacturing touches for him, such as those handoffs."
minnesotavikings,3aq2jo,austhyma,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:11:32 2015 UTC,I don't put a lot of stock in this shit. But I think Johnson will be a solid contributor. Norv Turner did say he was the Viking's best receiver with a roster that contained Gregg Jennings.
minnesotavikings,3astes,AHSfav,15,Tue Jun 23 05:49:04 2015 UTC,Charles Johnson maybe?

minnesotavikings,3astes,jack_slim,7,Tue Jun 23 06:01:26 2015 UTC,Yesterday there was a link to a Fantasy Football article that said Teddy had great third down and red zone completion percentages.

minnesotavikings,3astes,full_fire,3,Tue Jun 23 05:59:31 2015 UTC,Doesn't great actual mean best? I thought he led in both categories.
minnesotavikings,3astes,HakunaMatata023,3,Tue Jun 23 13:17:41 2015 UTC,"Yes you're right, 72% on Redzones and 68.5% on 3rd downs, both led the league."
minnesotavikings,3astes,sleepsoncouches,5,Tue Jun 23 17:26:32 2015 UTC,"Losing Jennings as a sure-handed receiver doesn't help the situation but I think that Wright can be that ""easy"" short pass 3rd down guy. Rudolph(/Pruitt) as another option. Charles Johnson just seemed to be too much of a natural #1/#2 wideout with big play ability to warrant accreditation as a ""possession"" WR."
minnesotavikings,3astes,Notorious21,4,Tue Jun 23 06:17:42 2015 UTC,"Just because someone is known as more of a deep threat, or has other talents, does not mean they're not a reliable possession receiver as well.  If anything the term is pejorative for slow receivers with good hands."

minnesotavikings,3astes,ull90,6,Tue Jun 23 17:34:45 2015 UTC,"Turner seems to play his split ends in that sort of role. It's not so much just running deep all the time. Turner wants a big, strong target at that position. Johnson is our split end. I'm not sure if Johnson will do well in this role. Last year, he didn't seem to do well catching balls that were contested or hard to get. This is just the role he is supposed to play in the offense. Teddy or Turner may try to target different receivers on third down depending on the situation."

minnesotavikings,3astes,youvebeengreggd,3,Tue Jun 23 16:35:01 2015 UTC,"In a Norv Turner offense, you're looking at a lot of TE possesion throws and RBs in the flat.  At WR, Charles Johnson is probably the likely candidate but we don't seem to have a true possession guy right now. We're stacked with superb athletes at WR but not Cris Carter/Wes Welker types."

minnesotavikings,3astes,Calendar_Girl,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:08:37 2015 UTC,And then when he gets open but drops the ball continuously. At this point Rudolph needs to have a massive season to make me a believer.

minnesotavikings,3astes,Staple_Overlord,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:40:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Vikings have that in their wide receiver corps. Johnson is the closest one to it with his route running and size, but he did not display the kind of strength and aggressiveness that are characteristic of possession receivers.   Kyle Rudolph, when healthy, certainly is. He has excellent hands and finds space well. He needs to stop (1) getting injured, and (2) disappearing for multiple games at a time. Otherwise, he is a very good target."
minnesotavikings,3astes,HakunaMatata023,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:50:53 2015 UTC,"I think Rudolph will be a main guy in these situations and become a fan fav of Teddy and become his safety net. One guy though for the redzone that could help and I'm sure most won't talk about is Mike Wallace. Yes he is a true deep treat put 9 of his 10 TD's last season came in the redzone, that's impressive and not something to overlook.  I also think Pruitt could become a reliable target for Teddy but I'd saying seeing Teddy share the wealth last year I could see it as that where multiple guys step up and it's just whoever is in the best position but if I had to name some players those 3 would be my best bets especially Rudolph."

minnesotavikings,3apsg6,1niquity,4,Mon Jun 22 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"This is key.  Zimmer pretty much came out and said as much about both of the lines, that it's tough to evaluate them without pads on.

Right now they're probably trying to feel out which of the new linemen are making progress on learning playbook intricacies and building chemistry, getting them a good base of reps.  Not much press on his abilities because we still haven't seen them. And I think people kind of overlook whether linemen are learning the scheme well. Probably hard to judge without being with the coaching staff or sitting in front of a pile of film.  When pads go on I think the line competition will be a lot more clear."

He's also used to having a QB with a bigger arm, which likely suits EJ more than Matt.   Overall though, my comment was more towards just incompetence than anything else."
minnesotavikings,3apmnr,Dorkamundo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:47:04 2015 UTC,"Ahhh... Good call dude. Thanks for the thorough response...   Sounds like an odd situation for Shady McCoy. They sound like the team that pays for new, shiny pieces that don't gel. It could be a disaster."
minnesotavikings,3apfom,p_U_c_K_IV,7,Mon Jun 22 12:53:36 2015 UTC,"If I have the first pick in my draft, I'm taking him. That's all I know."
minnesotavikings,3apfom,waterbuffalo750,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:06:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, man. It'll be interesting to see what people do in non- Vikes fan type leagues. I think as the draft dates near, the hype around AD will intensify. I can't imagine anyone picking someone ahead of him.   I could see that maybe Bell would've maybe been competition, if he wasn't suspended. But, either way, he'll be a $60 + auction spend."
minnesotavikings,3apfom,Tullimory,2,Mon Jun 22 14:00:08 2015 UTC,"I'm banking on my league mates having short memories and letting AD fall to me some how, some way."
minnesotavikings,3apfom,Tullimory,2,Mon Jun 22 14:26:42 2015 UTC,"That's what im hoping too. I always end up with like the seventh pick of twelve. Right after every ""sure thing"" is picked. That's why I like auctions. It's fun to mess with people, too. Last year i got a Cowboys fan to put up $62 for Tony Romo."
minnesotavikings,3apfom,Tullimory,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:42:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the fanboy thing doesn't work against me. I know damn well not to attach my fantasy hopes to the Vikings. I've already got to deal with possible disappointment just watching the games as a fan, last thing I need to do is have it ruin my fantasy season too. That said, I'm buying AP this year and probably Teddy as a backup QB flier. Possibly CJ too in the later rounds."
minnesotavikings,3apfom,itsamamaluigi,2,Mon Jun 22 14:51:41 2015 UTC,"Well said dude. So true.   I try to abide by the same logic. But, do find it hard to draft any Packers. I had Rodgers two years ago and my dad disowned me."

My Dad moved to Minnesota to pursue his degree at the time Fran Tarkenton was the QB for the Vikes.  To get aclimated to the culture, one of the first things he did was get into the local sports teams.  To this day, with the fond memories of Tarkenton, he still refers to him as, ""Frank"".    At least 4 or 5 times a season, while watching games he'll always bring up ""Frank"" Tarkenton, and it gets me everytime!  AND he keeps calling AD, Adrian Patterson, well before CP was on the team.  Imagine those two names in an mixed Indian/Sota accent HAHA.  The dude is too funny!  But his most favorite Minnesota player of all-time is Kirby Puckett!"
minnesotavikings,3annns,PurpleVikings,2,Mon Jun 22 04:03:05 2015 UTC,My dad is a Packers fan. Watching him debate in his mind for a minute was quite entertaining. He has always loved Randy Moss but he went with Teddy. He really respects the kid and sees a bright future for him.

minnesotavikings,3ama8g,LittleBitLoose,3,Sun Jun 21 18:36:12 2015 UTC,This is awesome... Thanks OP.   I honestly have zero memory of this game. TO the point that I am worried about my brain... I need to rewatch it...
minnesotavikings,3al386,gradual_alzheimers,8,Sun Jun 21 06:41:22 2015 UTC,"I fucking loved when he fake mooned the Packer fans, I don't care what anyone says that shit was awesome."

minnesotavikings,3al386,couchglue,8,Sun Jun 21 19:13:25 2015 UTC,I've hated Joe Buck since that game. He blew it way out of proportion.
minnesotavikings,3al386,chorse11,2,Sun Jun 21 19:24:24 2015 UTC,"Because gb it's wholesome, Midwestern, and more America's team than the cowboys if you follow sports media. It's insane how much they choke on cheese dick out there."
minnesotavikings,3al386,Kelzer66,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:49:36 2015 UTC,No packer fan has ever cried about that.  No one made it into a big deal at all
minnesotavikings,3al386,seenunseen,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:39:19 2015 UTC,"That shit... Man... I've never instantly hated someone as ... instantly... as I did when Joe Buck responded to that.   It was kinda similar to the AD child abuse situation. IIRC there was some controversy about TD celebrations around that time, which is why Buck defaulted to disgust. It wasn't that big of a deal, and actually made a lot of sense based on the situation (Packers fans mooning the Vikes bus on the regular).   But of course, for whatever reason, it became this huge issue. I hate when that happens. Moss IS the greatest of all time, and we ran him out of town because he had the ""gall"" to say he could pay a fine with ""straight cash, homie'.   I thought that this AD situation was going to play out exactly like the Moss one. Another once in a lifetime player that we somehow ended up with, leaving over mostly personal nonsense by faux fans who seem to think that their children need guidance from 25 year old millionaires who catch footballs...   A lot of my bitterness is based on this situation. I will never forget waking up to 10 texts about Moss being traded. I broke my hand punching the wall next to my bed."
minnesotavikings,3al386,p_U_c_K_IV,8,Sun Jun 21 23:11:20 2015 UTC,Will upvote a Super freak thread all the time!
minnesotavikings,3al386,ITzCHURCH,6,Sun Jun 21 11:10:12 2015 UTC,Someone tried to tell me once that Moss couldn't beat double or triple coverage like Calvin Johnson does.
minnesotavikings,3al386,ull90,9,Sun Jun 21 12:20:24 2015 UTC,Moss had 70 TD catches of 20 or more yards by age of 30. Calvin has 34. Only Jerry Rice was close with 65. Moss was truly an amazing deep threat and the best of all time in that regard.
minnesotavikings,3al386,p_U_c_K_IV,3,Sun Jun 21 16:57:57 2015 UTC,"Yep. He changed the game. Calvin Johnson is called the New Moss. He is held to that standard, and he isn't surpassing it. But, people will always compare deep threats to Moss, just like the NBA always has a ""New MJ!"".   But the fact remains that Moss had 92 TD's and > 9,000 yards in the 7 seasons he was here. No one has ever done that. He was on the top 2 scoring offenses up until 2013.   Rice had back to back HOF Qb's. Moss had has beens and back ups. When he got his HOF'er he became uncoverable.   There is no argument."
minnesotavikings,3al386,Notorious21,2,Sun Jun 21 23:13:46 2015 UTC,"Starting with Plaxico Burress, every tall wide receiver coming out gets compared to Moss, but year after year, it's still Moss that is the standard of comparison."
minnesotavikings,3al386,whambamthankyoulamb,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:14:30 2015 UTC,"Yup, you're right.  I do think OBJ has a chance to get close, though.  I know it's really early to call it, but I have a feeling OBJ is really special.  He, like Moss, has dominated right away.  Their physical traits are so special that they were both able to dominate DBs immediately.  I won't be surprised if OBJ lives up to the comparison more so than other WRs in the past."
minnesotavikings,3al386,youvebeengreggd,5,Mon Jun 22 17:52:14 2015 UTC,How old were they? I'm guessing early twenties.
minnesotavikings,3al386,SNESdrunk,5,Sun Jun 21 13:05:07 2015 UTC,"Man, Jeff George had a hell of an arm"
minnesotavikings,3al386,Notorious21,3,Sun Jun 21 12:47:45 2015 UTC,From the video: Jeff George's QB rating with Moss ? 90.  Without Moss? 80.
minnesotavikings,3al386,p_U_c_K_IV,2,Sun Jun 21 17:11:56 2015 UTC,Brady's was even more dramatic.  He went from 6 or 7 years of hovering right around 90 to about 130 in 2007.
minnesotavikings,3al386,CelestialFury,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:15:25 2015 UTC,"Was that him @2:16? He casually threw it 65 yards from our endzone.   I loved George when he got to play. Granted, Moss made everyone look like a HOF'er, but, all Moss needed was someone who could toss it deep, someone to give him a shot at a jump ball (Kerry Collins notwithstanding)."
minnesotavikings,3al386,DirtD4er,5,Sun Jun 21 23:18:27 2015 UTC,Moss is a tough sob; he took monster hits and walked away like it was nothing.

minnesotavikings,3am8l7,Fineyouwin,3,Sun Jun 21 21:35:38 2015 UTC,"Yes and it was nuts. I saw a fist fight, saw a woman dump a full beer on a dude then get knocked out, 3 guys in row in front of us were lighting bowls all game. Halftime the heckling of us got pretty aggressive until said bowl smokers stood up for us and backed down the hecklers. As we left the stadium no less than 25 people yelled something at us for our jerseys and Vikings attire. I didn't have a bad time as the weather was great but it was really aggressive from start to finish.  On the other hand my grandparents sat in the black hole ( no Viking attire) and had a great time."
minnesotavikings,3am8l7,foxmtbr,5,Mon Jun 22 00:38:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to the game on 11/15. I'm not going to wear Vikings gear, for my own safety. I'm just going to sit and quietly enjoy a Vikings victory"
minnesotavikings,3am8l7,avengedteddy,5,Sun Jun 21 16:53:03 2015 UTC,was thinking of doing the same when im there... but they may stab me because it will be too obvious we aren't raider fans: - wearing neutral colors - not celebrating when raiders score
minnesotavikings,3am8l7,foxmtbr,3,Sun Jun 21 17:31:18 2015 UTC,"Nah, we'll be fine. I've been to a few Raiders games and it's not as horrible as the rumors. Fights and stabbings definitely do happen among the rowdy & stupid fans. If you're just there watching the game, minding your own business, nobody is going to bother you. You most likely could wear a Vikings jersey without any trouble, but I'm just going to play it safe. I'm not really worried about getting stabbed; I'd just be worried about constant heckling and maybe someone throwing food at me.  On the other hand, I've been to a few Vikes-Niners games at Candlestick with my chest painted purple, and I think there were more of our fans than theirs... granted, this was back when the Niners were horrible (Dilfer at QB lol) and didn't have the new influx of bandwagoners"
minnesotavikings,3am8l7,avengedteddy,3,Sun Jun 21 18:07:42 2015 UTC,"looks like you're from california like me hah. I do know that raider fans are less tolerant towards divisional teams' fans. A friend witnessed a dad that had a chargers jersey getting jumped while taking a leak at the urinal. Raider fans warned him to take it off or else. He just said ""look im here to watch the game with my son"" and refused to. Took a leak and  raider idiots jumped him.   I've been to quite a few SF games. Most of the time, they try to egg me on to start arguing with them. I just laugh it off like its no big deal."

minnesotavikings,3alpxe,hurley17,2,Sun Jun 21 13:21:15 2015 UTC,Good read. The Vikings are one of the main things that me and my dad bonded over as well. While neither of our dad's will be here to witness their favorite team finally win a Super Bowl (I lost my dad 2 months ago); they can watch them win one while sharing a round wherever their souls reside now. Thanks for sharing OP and Skol.
