hiddenwow,3dosiv,justintime4awesome,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:32:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Definitely worth a look if you haven't been there before. I can't tell my methods of getting there on high level characters but you can see a lot of the stuff I showed with just a level 1. Its also one of the only places in the game now that has the vanilla worgen model."

The tree shadow is the most unique and unexpected thing out of those for me, that's so funny! Also, the noises may have something to do with the Ironforge Airport... you can look up lots of videos of people getting there before Cata. But maybe it's different. Odd either way. I've heard of the pearl before, interesting lost doodad. I have to look into your other stuff and see what I can find out about them for a more thorough answer."

hiddenwow,3ctqpr,KadeLylath,2,Sat Jul 11 01:08:37 2015 UTC,"The moonglade paw is a set of rocks on the northern cliffs of moonglade looking out towards the ocean. Just go to eh town in moonglade, fly north over the mountains and look along the coast.  The pearl is likely just object testing when they were building the zone. They put that stuff down to test sizings and textures and just never bothered to remove it.  The shadow tree is likely a lighting bug. If I'm correct, that screen shot was taken below the cliffs. Well likely what is happening is there's a free at the top of the cliff and for some reason, the shadow of that tree is being extended down onto that beach instead of being stopped by the ground."
hiddenwow,3ctqpr,AKDovah,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:30:09 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm new to this sub as well but I've been exploring for about 2 years. Heres a picture of that house. http://i.imgur.com/0E30rxq.jpg If you look out the portal upon entering the tram you'll see it. Its just to make it seem like you're still in Stormwind. The tree was probably removed when that zone was being developed and they forgot about the shadow or figured nobody would ever notice."

hiddenwow,3bda0d,Nightgloom,13,Sun Jun 28 03:16:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't consider this hidden and more cheating. It can be done by accident but linking things that can get you banned is stupid on this sub.
hiddenwow,3bda0d,Vereorx,5,Sun Jun 28 09:43:48 2015 UTC,"first method could actually be done on accident. Many people die during the fight and will run back only for the boss to die before they could hit resurrect. Then go again later that same week and forget they killed it, get loot again, realize they now for sure killed it and get targeted for exploit.   So be warned, make sure you get loot from him once, or you may get banned?"
hiddenwow,3bda0d,Zakkimatsu,2,Sun Jun 28 09:18:00 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that's how it was discovered in the first place: player drops out of group, finds loot in mailbox later. However, there's probably a pretty obvious difference between the behaviour of a player who did this by accident, and that of someone exploiting it deliberately (especially since Blizzard can see everything you've typed in chat).  Regardless, I'm sure a lot of people will be saying it was totally an accident when the ban wave hits. :)"
hiddenwow,3bda0d,carlfish,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:56:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I just shared and made the video to let people know. I tried to be quite clear that it can result in a ban in the video. They can do what they want with tha info. I'm personally not risking it.
hiddenwow,3bda0d,Zakkimatsu,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:02:39 2015 UTC,"If you are still in the group when the boss dies, you get a lockout and can't go do it again. You have to leave the group before the boss dies and stay in ghost form to not get a lockout."
hiddenwow,3bda0d,Vuul,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:01:56 2015 UTC,"Either way, with so many millions of players playing, one will remember the times when you wouldn't get loot if you were a ghost.  If I remember correctly, in MoP, if you died on a world boss and released you could not get loot because you were out of that bosses range of combat to be eligible."

He was just going ape-shit crazy and I'm standing behind him pissed off that he took over my character and wondering what the fuck is going on. After he caught it he told me why it was a big deal. He was more than a little irked that the first time I venture in to K3 area it spawns right by me. Beginner's luck I guess!"

I hearthed back to what I was doing and then I hear the noise again.. boy who cried wolf in my mind.  He was dead silent, didn't say a word.  Guildie of mine was there and got it.

hiddenwow,37z4bp,stevebobby,7,Sun May 31 17:04:08 2015 UTC,"Aviana's Feather gives you more control and doesn't kill you. Also, it doesn't have charges."
hiddenwow,37z4bp,Senappi,8,Mon Jun 1 06:06:58 2015 UTC,"Why not use both? First rocket yourself up into the air with Aviana's Feather, and once you start gliding use the Falling Flame. You can cross continents with this combination."
hiddenwow,37z4bp,suchtie,3,Mon Jun 1 08:26:59 2015 UTC,just make sure you have a parachute or a glider when you do that.
hiddenwow,37z4bp,Senappi,3,Mon Jun 1 08:49:58 2015 UTC,You're already gliding because of the feather though. But it might still be a good idea to keep a glider anyway for safety.
hiddenwow,37z4bp,suchtie,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:08:59 2015 UTC,"Can confirm; combining the Falling Flame and Aviana's Feather gives you a very fast method of travel, as you glide at the speed of roughly twice (if not three times) the speed of your flying mount at 310% movement speed. Very handy for traversing Draenor, thought you may want to bring a glider with you, as the effects of the Falling Flame do not wear off until you're safe on the ground, while your Feather's slow fall effect has a 2min duration. Be advised though, the Falling Flame won't kill you if your slow fall fades and you're merely a few feet off the ground, so don't panic too much."
hiddenwow,37z4bp,MaugerMan,4,Fri Jul 10 21:55:49 2015 UTC,"Not in my experience. It's better for covering large distances, but a glider CAN stop the effect and let you glide down from a high altitude."
hiddenwow,37z4bp,TheDeckonomist,3,Sun May 31 20:28:00 2015 UTC,"I've actually never really tried with the Flame simply because I'm so scared of using my charges, but I do have to say that it's pretty much my favorite toy in the game. So damn fun."

hiddenwow,35ykbj,Anosognosia,2,Thu May 14 22:05:06 2015 UTC,why is there even an outside of a dungeon?
hiddenwow,35ykbj,Lukiedookie,6,Thu May 14 20:33:58 2015 UTC,"When blizzard makes dungeons they typically use a part of either Kalimdor or Azeroth as a ""background"" because either 1) the dungeon has an outside component (windows, a skybox, courtyards, etc) that they want to be located in the world or 2) there are properties that they need that already exist, e.g. Naxx using Winterspring for the ""frozen breath"" effect.   Since it's just a cut and paste, you can exit the boundaries of the instance and check out the ground that was cut around it. Sometimes this includes things that have been taken out of live and may be remnants from an Alpha or Beta build, sometimes there are multiple areas and it's neat to see how they're put together, and sometimes it helps you get to places you aren't supposed to, like getting behind the raid portal in Stratholme."

hiddenwow,35yznr,myselfalex,8,Thu May 14 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, I discovered this as well early on: Eye of Kilrogg, when glyphed, would actually fly around on Draenor which made some objectives and locations easier to reach (because the glyph also allowed you to drop a summoning circle that allowed you to use Demonic Circle: Teleport.)  I searched for openings but found none either.  :(      They nerfed the Eye of Kilrogg so that you can't fly with it anymore in Draenor.  QQ"

hiddenwow,35yznr,LufttheMage,7,Fri May 15 17:18:53 2015 UTC,Usually only GM island was worthy of a ban. I explored a whole lot during Classic and only ever encountered a GM once in Hyjal when we started summoning tons of people to the construction sign. He just gave us a slap on the wrist and ported us all out.     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyFiXMqTg8c (Dopefish: the Last Wallwalk) actually documents a group of players being banned (temporarily I presume) for wall-walking to Ironforge Airport and the outer-reaches above Orgrimmar the day before Wall-walking was removed.

hiddenwow,30g07a,nachobel,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:28:56 2015 UTC,I also think i need something to switch the scholo files or something..
hiddenwow,30g07a,nachobel,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:40:24 2015 UTC,"It had to be scholomance because the map tiles (adt) from ED and Scholomance overlap eachother, that way, when you do the swap, you don't go out of bounds and fall in the void."
hiddenwow,30g07a,merfed,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:59:27 2015 UTC,"If you're on a private server see if the .worldport command is enabled. This lets you zone in to any instance in the game. I'm not sure which number ED is but you can easily look that up. Much easier than model editing.   If it's not, then you'll need to change and instance you can zone in to look like the ED. I recommend Scholomance. It's been a long long time since I've done this but essentially there are two ways - the first is to change all the files from instance one into the ME instance. This is time consuming and isn't great for large maps. The second is to change the index file to use everything from the ME instance. It involves some relatively simple hex editing. Do this instead.   But seriously, that worldport command tho..."
hiddenwow,30g07a,merfed,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:48:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help. Worldport is not allowed , there's a donor mall in testing and i suppose they don't want people to ho there.

hiddenwow,30g07a,Suzaru-ac,1 point,Sat Mar 28 15:39:47 2015 UTC,"If you found packaged mpq files then you don't need to do anything but put that into your data file folder and then load the game. The trick is knowing where ED was placed (how to access it) since it all depends on how it was built. I'd try scholo and go from there. If you PM me the patch I may be able to figure it out, but it's been over 8 years since I've done any of this and I don't have any of my old tools.   Another option may be to message a GM and see if they'll port you. Any GM will have the ability to worldport."

hiddenwow,2yaurl,Gronfors,3,Sun Mar 8 02:39:44 2015 UTC,"Way I always did it (not having access to the zep) was:   Jump on top of the teleport On top of the street lamp thing On top of the cogs on the wall From there, you may see an opening on the wooden pillar wall Use Disengage/Rocket Jump/Warlockthingy to manouver yourself there Should fall through the floor and be free Elevators work so I climbed on top of one of the taller mountains and jumped to the zeppelin, helped by Goblin Glider   The first few steps are all seen on the first picture with the wooden pillar wall on the upper left with the opening being higher on it."

hiddenwow,2y4m8s,boabg,5,Fri Mar 6 13:37:03 2015 UTC,Probably if you just bypassed the portal to zone you in to the instance. There is probably a full version in there without enemies.  Otherwise you could try getting out of the sunwell instance and going in that way.

hiddenwow,2xyis5,waahht,5,Thu Mar 5 22:52:31 2015 UTC,"Initially, I was simply looking at minimaps and comparing dungeon minimaps with the world minimaps. Now, however, I use Neo, an open source WoW Map Viewer/Editor (https://gitlab.cromon.ch/Cromon/woweditor) to look at the terrain, and analyze the areas that don't get an in-game minimap.   Here's a finding that I made public once already, a long time ago - Deadmines was constructed from the landmass of Westfall, in its entirety. Where the boat is, and would lead out to was not STV, but would have been the eastern shore of Westfall. Highlighted, overlay map: http://i.imgur.com/cGZCGC1.jpg  With this in mind, the so-called Outland Testing Area would have actually been somewhere around Stormwind/Dun Morogh. I plan on updating the linked image at some point with a more accurate depiction as to where the Outland Testing Area exists in relation to the over-world.  There are a lot of maps in WoW that either have the corresponding minimap redacted or edited, to hide the areas that blizzard doesn't want the end user to see."

hiddenwow,2xyis5,waahht,4,Wed Apr 22 06:30:38 2015 UTC,Another interesting thing about this exploration is that when you get outside of deepholm I believe the skybox goes on forever (at least it used to) I remember AFK flying upwards for 20+ minutes without hitting a ceiling.
hiddenwow,2xyis5,BigClifty,3,Thu Mar 5 18:09:41 2015 UTC,And if you go high enough it gets sunny and clouds form above you.  I did it once and then fell forever.

hiddenwow,2xyis5,waahht,4,Thu Mar 5 18:13:29 2015 UTC,I was using ashes of alar which has a trail particle effect and it seemed to keep moving. Also when I finally dismounted and fell I remember falling for several minutes. So if I was hitting a ceiling it was much much higher than your typical skybox. I could very well be wrong though.
hiddenwow,2xyis5,Deeblite,3,Thu Mar 5 18:16:29 2015 UTC,"You're probably not wrong.  They don't expect people to be outside of the box, so there's no reason to put an artificial ceiling in place."

hiddenwow,2x9006,Seradania,7,Thu Feb 26 18:46:40 2015 UTC,"I could still hear Thaddius yelling and the general Naxx ambiance while I was exploring, so I assume it is still considered a raid area. In the guild roster where it displays your location it also said 'Naxxramas' even when I was in Strat, so it probably wouldn't work. :("
hiddenwow,2x9006,waahht,7,Thu Feb 26 18:56:04 2015 UTC,Have you tried going to the absolute furthest out point from the instance? I have noticed while exploring outside of a few dungeons that if you go out far enough it will just list your zone as a blank space and you will be able to mount on flying mounts even. If I remember correctly I was able to do this with very little issue in either utgarde keep or utgarde pinnacle.

hiddenwow,2x9006,Seradania,6,Thu Feb 26 19:07:27 2015 UTC,I've found that whenever I get stuck (whether it be falling through the ground and getting infinity DC'd or something like that) if I just log out of that char for 10 or so minutes I will be at a graveyard somewhere. I end up getting stuck often and have never had to ticket a GM for help. I haven't done any really awesome exploring in a few months so obviously do that at your own risk. Things may have changed.

I managed to climb to the top of the largest mountain in the zone just outside of Sapphiron's room with demon leap and demonic portal (a very long process).  My friend had convinced me that the raid shown in image 20 of the OP was original level 60 Naxx somehow, and I wanted to check. Turns out it's possible to get in with the goblin glider, and you just fall through the ceiling into normal level 80 Naxx.  I think I may have screenshots, I'll try to find them"
hiddenwow,2x9006,TharpDaddy,2,Fri Feb 27 16:01:31 2015 UTC,"Late reply, but I used Aviana's feather in a few raids before Blizz nerfed it, including Naxx (from outside in EPL). Basically, the sky in EPL is Naxxramas, but with invisible walls as seen from outside. If you look at the minimap, you should be able to see Naxx aswell. I think you are able to enter it, as you are able to clip through it.  If you stand in Plaguewood and look up, you can see Naxx as OP posted, but that isn't the old lvl 60 version. You can still see that the raid portals are not green, and instead use the modern blue-green swirl portal."
hiddenwow,2x9006,that_nagger_guy,2,Fri Feb 27 06:17:57 2015 UTC,"You would, but the naxx you see there is the same naxx you enter in. If you look out of the windows when zoning in, you'll still see plaguewood below even though naxx has been moved.  New naxx is still old naxx (though a different map ID, old naxx's map ID still exists but the instance is entirely removed except for the instance portals where you zone in, it's where any characters logged off in old naxx get stuck and are forced to zone out) so there's no hope of anything creative like that. :/"

hiddenwow,2x9006,quasielvis,3,Thu Feb 26 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"It's actually a lot simpler than that. It was well known that standing in tight spots like this and mounting up would cause you to go through a wall, but when they hotfixed that people had to improvise and instead log out right when the mount cast was about to finish. I assume making yourself bigger with something like the firewater or vrykul drinking horn works in a similar way to the mounts. I agree though, it is amazing how people find this stuff out."

There's a raised part of the flat ground there, so we had the mage give us slowfall and we mounted up and jumped over there.

It is actually the first floor of Naxx, as evidenced by me going back to murder some stuff in the Plague Quarter and then check back.

hiddenwow,2wzl70,akspa420,1 point,Sat Feb 28 10:35:36 2015 UTC,"The only random water in that region of the kalimdor map that I could find would be a little pond that would have been part of the original player housing. As such, it was likely removed in 4.x, as the map got completely revamped, and unused areas were removed from the map in their entirety."
hiddenwow,2v1mgp,Slyme_JR,11,Sat Feb 7 00:45:27 2015 UTC,I wonder if these are just recycled assets from Outland or if this is actually a clue about whats to come.
hiddenwow,2v1mgp,Psychotrip,4,Sat Feb 7 03:47:35 2015 UTC,"Recycled due to copy/pasting the throne in its entirety into the continent of draenor. A lot of bits and pieces of Outland were used to form the new zones. Most of the time, Blizzard strips the original bits that aren't terrain - especially when in an outdoor area (except for Deepholm, where bits and pieces of Crystalsong Forest can be found, which was likely the prefab terrain used to develop the zone."
hiddenwow,2v1mgp,akspa420,4,Sat Feb 7 07:10:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed, i'm fairly certain Tanaan is based ofa copy-pasted Hellfire Penninsula.  There's also a screwed up version of Hellfire Citadel in there, and at one point in the beta you got the Hellfire Superiority buff if you got into the zone."

hiddenwow,2tx14t,Callous_Mat,5,Wed Jan 28 03:02:06 2015 UTC,I have to agree with the person above. There are vendors and I think also a quest that takes you into the sewers. I'm sure anyone who played during Wrath of the Lich King knows of this place and has been down there.
hiddenwow,2tx14t,Pixelsaurus,-14,Wed Jan 28 03:07:24 2015 UTC,We thoroughly searched the area and couldn't find any of these quests you're talking about. Maybe there are a separate sewers in Dalaran but I can assure this area is quite hidden.

The reason people ask if you're trolling is because that area was pretty populated back when Dalaran was the main hub (in WotLK expansion). It held PvP and several other assorted vendors, it was also a preferred duelling area.  Your find is on the same level as ""wow I just found that there is a ring with portals in Stormwind behind the walls! amazing!"", so people are mostly amused at this naivete and assume you're a troll instead."

hiddenwow,2tgmrf,opmsdd,11,Sat Jan 24 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"As someone mentioned, it sounds like Duke Hydraxis.  However, you would have had to start from Kalimdor, as he was over here when he existed.  It sounds right, because you had to go through fatigue to get to him.  But he was removed from the game at Cataclysm launch.  So there's no way you would have seen him when Vashj""ir existed.  I also searched through all friendly elemental NPC's on wowhead, as well as the vanilla wow database, without finding anything promising.  If you want to search for it again with relative ease, try rolling a shaman.  I haven't played in a few months, but last I checked you could use farsight from the location you set your last farsight to.  You can effectively see anywhere out at sea (until you hit the invisible wall) from the shore, by chaining together farsights.  Good luck."

From the town hall entrance in your garrison you can fly straight to shattrath to do a daily or something. If you need to go further you can bounce off the dome of the city. It will boost you up again because you're not allowed to land on it.

hiddenwow,2pc8s2,ShallowBasketcase,38,Mon Dec 15 08:14:50 2014 UTC,"Lots of events are triggered within a Garrison.  Triggers need an object to trigger from and can also be a source of ambient sounds or spawning points for mobs.  A new object will have this checkerboard pattern by default when no texture has been applied to them.  Normally they are flagged as invisible, but sometimes they are not because they are not expected to be seen under the terrain anyway.  Anytime something is spawned or despawn, it is controlled by an object, and many of these are simply invisible little cubes."

Other they look like this because it is both a simple texture to map and because it sticks out like  sore thumb.  Could be a trigger for any object that requires an action, or for scene chunking. I'm also guessing that line indicates some directional vector for an object, like a normal or something.  TL;DR The camera was probably not supposed to see here."

hiddenwow,2pc8s2,DaftOnecommaThe,6,Tue Dec 30 19:56:29 2014 UTC,"Speaking from direct experience, game developers use all kinds of placeholder objects for different things. Cubes with a colorful checkerboard pattern are the most common ""generic"" or ""nothing"" object to represent something (primarily because it stands out against any surface and is super obvious ""holy shit this is so wrong, someone fix it!"") If you make it invisible, it's harder to see later, but you can still do this if you have a list of objects in the scene and know what you're looking for.  In many cases, they could represent a missing 3D model or something, perhaps a typo called out for the wrong asset, or someone wrote ""building_stabel"" instead of ""building_stable"". But I don't think this is the case here.  I'm going to assume it's some sort of anchor point for the garrison. Clearly it's an ""editor only"" thing that you're not supposed to see, hence why it's cleverly hidden under the terrain, and Blizz didn't bother to turn off its graphics draw.  By anchor point, it could be that this central point is what all the other lots and objects are tied to. You could think of it like a folder, containing all of the stuff in the garrison. Each level of garrison could be a different folder, so they just swap one object to get all the objects attached to it - instead of having to tell the game trigger to swap each and every single object 1 at a time when you trigger the upgrade. Makes for simpler editing and it's easier to work with.  You could have a trigger that says:   If player upgrades Garrison to Level 2 Delete Garrison_level1_node which would remove the node (called the parent) and all its objects attached to it (called the children) Place Garrison_leve2_node which would place the node parent and all its children without having to list all the children.   Instead of something stupid like:   If player upgrades Garrison to Level 2 Delete Garrison_Stable Delete Garrison_Townhall_level1 Delete Garrison_Wall3 blah blah blah all the objects then place all the objects (very long list)   Could be wrong, but that'd be my guess from what I can see in this thread and what I know of WoW."

Part of old stormwind is out past the instance portal, if you know how to get out past it. In fact, any instance that has a portal you can see on the other side of has parts of the world out there that was copied when the instance was made. Some have larger copies of the map than others - some have ridiculously large copies of the world outside, for example naxxramas has large portions of EPL in it, as that was were the instance was originally, in vanilla. Heres one video that explains one method for glitching out of an instance, and shows you what's on the other side of the walls.

Deadmines is contained in a shell of an rotated Westfall landmass, but no buildings from the terrain it was pulled from exist there.

Not just your common thugs and gnolls like in the normal Stockades but a prison for powerful mages, demons, and other more dangerous foes.  The idea for a second prison instance in wow was scrapped however and although you can still see the second prison building in wow, it's unlikely the Vault will ever be used as an instance simply because of the impracticality of having another instance in a major faction city.

ElvUI is a complete UI overhaul. It's really complicated, but if you take the time to learn how to play with it, it's really worth it.

hiddenwow,2nvnvm,cocoabishnu,7,Mon Dec 1 00:40:34 2014 UTC,"I loved these back in the day. There was a whole group of people who released videos under the Nogg-Aholic name. Geek33 found most of the original ""hidden"" areas, as well as how to do model editing. From there dopefish, malu05, cryect, snoman/snobaste, BAT4DEAD, zax, Antiklesys and a bunch more made some really cool exploration videos, and other things.  I say other things because after the wall walking nerf many really devoted all their energy into model editing. There was a small group inside Nogg-aholic called #SecretMeeting after a irc channel they would meet up in. They had tiered access, where you could complete challenges to get in, as far as I remember SecretMeeting was the top. Some pretty amazing stuff came out of this, Malu did some pretty clever animation editing, and eventually moved on to WoWMachinaTool, among other things. Snoman's videos were really good for redone/custom zones, and dopefish's and geek33 had some fantastic exploration videos. Cryect did a awesome armor swap of the warlock fan art that was floating around during vanilla. And many more put a story to their explorations making them a lot more enjoyable then your run of the mill tutorial videos.  Nogg-aholic the movie featured a few model edits, and I believe most was filmed on a private server. The model editing ""scene"" is really dead at this point. I could go on about this stuff for hours, having archived about 20gbs of videos, tools and what not from when I was involved. But I don't know how this form of exploring is accepted here.  That said, don't just check out dopefish's videos, almost everyone in the nogg-aholic group released some of the best early exploration videos that focused on a cinematic experience vs a tutorial one."

Nintoxicated produced some of the best original m2 documentation that no one seems to have anymore. GM was mostly an off shoot group because Dopefish didn't want to keep Nogg going anymore. They had a tool set that was leaked maybe 7 years ago? Mostly featured cryects stuff, malu's file renamer, mount point stuff, and more. They stayed on 1.12, and lot of the stuff never got out beyond that because the people involved never showed much of anything off after their show off video featured on the wow eu site.

The island to the west of the Spires of Arak, however, was in the game. It was a semi-textured island that had high spires that poked the sky. then it disappeared during one of the beta waves.  Farahlon was also in the game, to a degree. It's technically still in the game, at least in the form of areaID data. It was, for a time, still marked on the Draenor map files, such that you could venture out to where it should be, and the game would identify that you were in that particular zone.

The dead gnome obviously knew something that he shouldn't have. His partner was tasked with ensuring he never talked. Both gnomes took off in a spy plane on an alleged recon mission to points north of the Plaguelands. Our unfortunate friend got a knife in the back, but he didn't go down quietly and managed to bring the plane down as well. The murdering partner makes it to shore, only to see a stunned orc fishing in the lake. Loose ends. The orc tries to run but is stabbed at ass level and bleeds out onto the beach. The stone cold killer makes his way back to SI:7 or Ironforge or wherever and tells of how their plane suffered a major malfunction and went down over Forsaken territory and that his partner was killed in the crash. Command gives them both medals, and makes the killer accept the medal for the partner he murdered. The trauma and guilt eat away at him... He starts to drink constantly, always fingering his dead partner's medal. The alcohol therapy starts to loosen the lid on the secret, and Command decides that it might be time to tie up another loose end...   I mean, that's obviously what happened. The evidence is right there. 20 years as Alliance Detective and you've seen it all at least once. This? Cut-and-dry, this is a cover up gone wrong. Goddamn gnomes."

hiddenwow,2gjcax,prust89,2,Mon Oct 27 17:51:39 2014 UTC,"Me nor anyone I know about has been banned for it. Personally I don't think Blizzard cares about glitching in instances, they know we have fun doing it and that we aren't doing anything unfair.  It seems like Blizzard doesn't ban people that glitch as long as you don't do anything to gain an advantage over anyone or anything.  For example, glitching out of Zul'gurub to find the hidden Smiley Face and explore; they don't care about and will not ban you or fix the glitch. But, glitching out of Karazhan to skip to the last boss(yes, you can do this), they will ban you for doing that, as you are gaining an advantage over other players and doing something that is unfair."

hiddenwow,2g32qe,TripJohansen,1 point,Fri Sep 12 05:00:13 2014 UTC,"I missunderstood lol, the first chain you don't need to be all the way ontop the thing, as you can see the video, I am not standing on top it, I'm standing in the air on the side of it. But if you're having trouble jumping on the actual chain.. like the first thing I do there, then I.. really can't help you, sorry.  BUT, for anyone that might be having problems to do the 'getting out of the instance part', hope this helps:  It can be a real pain to do that, the only tips I have is what I do in the video, use a growth potion, mammoth and jump backwards.  You first want to jump behind the chains, which you can do by just spam jumping forwards until you are behind the chains, once you are behind the chains you back up to the thing I jumped up on, then start jumping backwards. Do not spam jump at this point, because if you do, you're gonna end up making the jump but you'll just jump off it again because you're spam jumping.  Once you are up on the chain, turn your mammoth's behind the same direction I do in the video, then jump one time, backwards to make it easier, when you are standing on the side of the wall, dismount and jump the rest by foot. Again, do not spam jump at this point, you don't wanna make the jump after 10 minutes then fall of because you were spam jumping.  Good luck, and again, I am aware that this glitch can be really hard, but hang in there, I spent maybe about 15-20 minutes(first time). Once you are used to it, it's easier."

hiddenwow,2g0ckw,byraq,1 point,Wed Sep 10 16:47:50 2014 UTC,"Not every wall acts the same, unfortunately. Also, be sure you have just enough space to hop off the tiger, and still get inside of whatever you're trying to get into. The game client will try to 'fix' your collision if you end up hitting a wall with not enough room between you and the wall. What's really happening is your collision model gets swapped out for the tiger's collision model, and the server either doesn't register the sudden change, thus pushing you through the surface, or it detects and tries to correct your collision.   I sometimes have luck with mounting up, logging out, then logging back in, and hopping off the tiger. At least that gives the server more lead-time to try and figure out what you're attempting (as in, it takes more time to calculate the appropriate collision model). This is in all actuality why the large mount bug still sorta works between mount-exit-login."

hiddenwow,2e7f8k,TrustmeIknowaguy,2,Thu Aug 21 20:47:03 2014 UTC,My guess and I may be wrong is that you can see Dalaran from the instance and the city isn't it's own object and it part of the physical environment and I would assume it would just be easiest to copy and paste everything rather than make a new object.

hiddenwow,2e7f8k,Lucidentropy,1 point,Fri Aug 22 03:02:56 2014 UTC,"These areas are probably re-used for other instanced content when they're close enough together. For example, a personal instanced version of Dalaran is used during the Purge of Dalaran. There may be technical reasons why just instancing the original city is not viable.  Another alternative is that when they duplicate the landscape it's probably easier to just take that world-chunk as one piece instead of manually removing things."
hiddenwow,2e7f8k,wung,3,Thu Aug 21 21:44:54 2014 UTC,"they don't reuse instances like that, for technical reasons, e.g. the scripts running being different.   Why copying the city instead of phasing: script running is starting per player, not a loop, thus would need multiple phases, thus would be quite some load. also, they obviuosly don't want trade in that scenario, or you being able to leave the city. also, it is not supposed to be in northrend at that time, iirc.  the world is defined in a 64x64 grid. copying less than one of that grid is a pain, and as you can see from even mail boxes being copied in that instance, copying those chunks is trivial in their tools. instances using existing areas by now always begin with a copy of just everything in that area, then deleting npcs, objects, and adding invisible walls where needed. most outdoors instances capture a good view of the state of development when adding the instance."

hiddenwow,2d21tr,TheKolbrin,1 point,Sat Aug 9 21:59:55 2014 UTC,"Regarding number 2, all through Vanilla and really I suspect until Cata, Hyjal looked like that.  You could get in and ride through there and it was almost exactly like the version in CoT except minus a lot of the architecture (and of course all the mobs).  The skeleton was there and everything, pretty cool.  Sometime around late Vanilla or early BC Blizz added some detector thing so whenever you entered the Hyjal zone you'd get DC'd automatically.  Also, with that, so originally there were four (maybe 5, I'm unsure if the green raid portal into AQ40 was there initially or not, I have no personal experience with that and no good source to check) green raid portals:  1) at the end of BRD to zone into MC 2) at the end (well middle) of UBRS to zone into BWL 3) at the end of Strath dead side to zone into Naxx, though this ended up getting changed 4) at the end of Darkwhisper Gorge into Hyjal  Obviously this was a planned raid and was likely fleshed out much like the CoT instanced version (given the similarity of the Durnhold 5-man as well as the Black Morass 5-man), though I think the Archimonde skeleton was added purely for an ""easter egg"" of sorts (same with the ""Blizzard Construction Co"" signs...no reason to have those if you didn't want people/someone to see them).

hiddenwow,2ck4lt,Jennabi,2,Mon Aug 4 15:20:19 2014 UTC,Welcome.  I was looking at some of the other guides on WoWhead when I ran across that.  Figured it needed sharing.
hiddenwow,2c4uyn,dmbardal,11,Wed Jul 30 12:15:54 2014 UTC,You might be interested to know that the skeleton is the orc model (tested myself by leaving my own skeleton there beside it). I don't know if it means anything but still fun to know.

You can see them from both Arathi Highlands--though the location is Forbidding Sea--and from Twilight Highlands.  I  was able to use my hunter's Eagle Eye to get fairly close from Arathi and not so close on the other side.  They are near this area Dwarven Farm near Arathi.    From the Twilight Highlands side"

hiddenwow,28rqmj,Kerstmangang,4,Wed Nov 5 04:50:37 2014 UTC,"The ships are part of the Horde intro cinematic, you can see the ships down there and garrosh sends his planes to attack them, leaving the zeppelins vulnerable and black dragons taking down the zeppelins."
hiddenwow,28rqmj,Flame5135,-1,Sat Aug 16 05:34:53 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that is how the Alliance makes landfall in Twilight Highlands. If you play through there as Horde, Garrosh makes a big deal about sending his air support to ambush the ships."
hiddenwow,28rqmj,Mielin,2,Sun Jun 22 05:16:52 2014 UTC,"Alliance flies in on a plane with Flintlocke. That fleet is part of the Horde Twilight Highlands intro. As Flame said, it solely serves as the reason Garrosh sends his air support away so that the transport zeppelins you're on are defenseless against the black dragons, thus leading to you bailing out."

hiddenwow,28igfa,bondiblueos9,2,Thu Jun 19 21:13:24 2014 UTC,Can someone put some extra lines and labels on this to make it easier to read for someone not as familiar with the geography and maps being overlayed?

hiddenwow,28igfa,bondiblueos9,2,Thu Jun 19 23:07:05 2014 UTC,Thanks! This is a lot clearer.
hiddenwow,28igfa,sndzag1,2,Thu Jun 19 23:11:08 2014 UTC,"I've never seen anyone get into that door. I'm not entirely sure the entire Deadmines instance actually exists inside the terrain, but I'm not sure."
hiddenwow,28igfa,The_Homestarmy,6,Thu Jun 19 04:04:56 2014 UTC,Deadmines is instanced for a reason. It probably sits somewhere 500 miles beneath Dun Morogh or something.
hiddenwow,28igfa,akspa420,2,Thu Jun 19 06:44:47 2014 UTC,"See: Imgur The actual instance itself is located on its own worldserver, just as most instances are. This image is a composite of Westfall and the Deadmines terrain overlayed on top of each other."
hiddenwow,28igfa,dre__,2,Thu Jun 19 08:35:46 2014 UTC,There was a program a long time ago called something like Warcraft World Viewer or Wow Map Viewer. It used the game's files to render the world in it's own window and let you nocilp through everything. It doesn't require you to login to wow or anything so there's no risk of getting banned from wow.  You can use that to check inside those doors if the program still exists and updated.
hiddenwow,28igfa,akspa420,2,Thu Jun 19 14:08:25 2014 UTC,"Noggit3 exists that works for this sort of thing, but only up through WoTLK. There exists a community of modders that have even managed to get most of MoP & Cata Content working within the 3.3.5 engine, despite the various changes that Blizzard has made over the years to their map format. Currently, work is being done to convert WoD content (alpha, anyway) over to 3.3.5's engine. Google ""Modcraft+superparanoid"" for more info"

One thing though, in picture 13:   These all stem from a core belief that women you must have the woman you are talking to right now.

hiddenwow,27wsk5,WellThatsJustSilly,1 point,Thu Jun 12 03:18:15 2014 UTC,"I think it's meant to say ""These all stem from a core belief that the woman you must have is the woman you are talking to right now""."

It can be used anywhere in the world and it's chainable so you can get pretty far with it.   Ask any Jewelcrafter with a skill of over 525 and they'll probably make a few for you if they have the mats :)  A few places worth taking a look at:    Stratholme (You can see the original Naxx there! Not textured though) Sunwell  Siege of Orgrimmar Mt. Hyjal (Instanced)
