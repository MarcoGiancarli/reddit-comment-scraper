sydney,3e1qmi,you-people,10,Tue Jul 21 08:55:55 2015 UTC,"This is about right on average, yeah. Sometimes it'll be a quick turnaround, I had an application get back to me within 24 hours today. Sometimes it'll be longer - I applied for a job in January and got a rejection letter in June."
sydney,3e1qmi,thelastrewind,5,Tue Jul 21 08:57:54 2015 UTC,"My first job, my interview was exactly a month after I applied for the job.  My current job was less than 24 hours between receiving a notification that someone had looked at my resume to getting a phone call offering me a job. And there was an interview in there, if 10 minutes counts.  That makes it sound almost dodgy."
sydney,3e1qmi,walkerreuben,5,Tue Jul 21 09:52:31 2015 UTC,"I got one offer within 4 days for one company, and another company took 3 days. I think the longest I've ever waited was... maybe 2.5 weeks?   Wow, the January to July rejection - do you know if their hiring process really just took that long, or was it a ""oh we should probably notify these guys at some point"" sort of thing?"
sydney,3e1qmi,princesspeachey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:57:09 2015 UTC,"I think it was the latter.   The other times from interview to hiring was a couple of weeks, but waiting for an interview took a while. And these were for part time, make money during uni jobs."
sydney,3e1qmi,thelastrewind,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:52 2015 UTC,I applied for a job in January and got a rejection letter in June.   Maybe they're making sure the new hire makes it through the probation period?

Except for Manly Fast Ferry and perhaps the Palm Beach to Basin service they all form regular public transport and are essential commuter services. It's not really fair that inner city commuters get huge subsidies for their ferries by virtue of being in Opal, but these other locations get left out and have to pay extra.

sydney,3e1qmi,Delicious_Muffins,10,Tue Jul 21 08:59:08 2015 UTC,I did one and I just told it what I thought it wanted to hear. I ended up getting the job.
sydney,3e1qmi,Sicklad,5,Tue Jul 21 10:02:31 2015 UTC,"Do you know the organisation/website that the company organises it through? If it's one of the bigger ones like SHL/Revelian, the personality ones are normally straightforward. Some of them may be role play/scenario based, whereas some may present you with a bunch of options and ask you to rate which one you think matches you the most and which one matches you the least. Just depends on what sort of psychometric test it is. I.e. it gives you three options: ""more team-oriented, more analytically minded, strictly adheres to rules"" and you'd have to choose which one matches you the most and which one matches you the least.  The more difficult ones are of course what I think you mean by merit-based in that they test numerical/quantitative skills, logic and comprehension (reading/information)."
sydney,3e1qmi,sanswork,4,Tue Jul 21 10:21:35 2015 UTC,"Nice! I had to do one a few days ago. Do you know what level you're doing? They usually do different ones depending on your role. Mine was just a 40 minute (untimed) multiple choice that asked for best and next best answer (out of 4) in customer service situations.  Eg. A customer has a complaint about x, and you notice that it was a coworkers mistake. How do you handle it?  a) Apologise for the mistake and ensure the customer you will do everything you can to rectify the issue.  b) Tell the customer it was not your fault, but your colleagues.  c) Shit in a trash can and pass it to the customer  d) The customer is actually Hitler."

sydney,3e1qmi,fddfgs,3,Tue Jul 21 11:44:53 2015 UTC,It's only happened twice actually(saying no).  Last time I was already their head of technology(they'd hired some new management consultant who suggested it for all the staff) so they weren't going to sack me for refusing.  Time before that I just said I wouldn't do it and that was it.  Still got the job.  I did have a fair bit of experience in my role at the time though so that helps.

So Telstra needed to do a ~10 day investigation into proving we were the current occupiers of the unit and could have their line disconnected.  They've finally done this only to find out the previous tenant were using naked DSL so it will now take them about 6 days to switch it to a normal phone line(I went with a normal line instead of naked DSL since iinet said it would take 30 days to get a naked DSL install).  Tethering is getting expensive and I miss youtube.

Is the second job (time wise) something where he must be 100% alert for safety-critical reasons - i.e. driving?   If not, I'd try to just stick it out without caffeine, so at least the limited sleep time can be quality sleep.

sydney,3e1tfz,duck_with_a_hat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:42:49 2015 UTC,Don't get me wrong - they do an excellent job but their fees are insane. They wanted to charge me close to $400 per MONTH on top of my regular monthly fee. And that was the most basic cheapest package.
sydney,3e1tfz,littlewoolie,2,Tue Jul 21 10:58:33 2015 UTC,"I signed up 3 months before the opening and got the $10.95 a week deal. Normally you'd think they charge you 4x10.95 which is $43.8 but they work it as such: $10.95x52/12 which comes down to $47.45 which is still extremely low.   They are a good gym, depending on your location and circumstances (late trainer, accessibility) but can also be annoying. Their gyms are relatively small and they don't regulate the amount of members so sometimes it's busy and then insanely, stupidely busy (then again, this can be said about any damn gym. Especially these days with the amount of little shits who go in groups and just hover or take up a machine for 30 minutes because a group of 5 people are training together. As with every gym, it all depends on the time of day).   My recommendation is too see when a new shop is opening up, or possibly of any deals are being handed out and shop around and see other gyms.  Remember this is about your preference so don't feel obligated to any gym.   I signed up 3 years ago so I was greeted and treated fairly well since I was one of the first 100 to sign up to my local one. Now I hear the prices are much steeper ($64 onwards on contracts and even more for month to month). Also heard contracts are 24/18/12 months and the lower you go, the more expensive...  Which they contently haggle me about because I pay dirt compared to their current prices and they are constantly trying to get me to cancel or renew to a new plan for no reason.   Also please be careful because I've been hearing some private owners are throwing in some bullshit loopholes that favour them (such as if you go to another anytime fitness, they automatically transfer you too they one and bump your pay up).   In summary this can be a great gym as long as you are happy with the location, services, pricing and other aspects such as contract and rules. Other than that, I wish you the best in finding a suitable gym."

sydney,3e1t3b,PervertedPeacock,9,Tue Jul 21 08:25:21 2015 UTC,"At my work there's a running joke that no one is doing a job related to their degree.   My number one advice would be to jump on seek and other job sites to get a feel for what jobs are actually out there (no point upskilling in a saturated field).   Pick a degree that will give you some core business skills.  And if all else fails look in to TAFE or an apprenticeship. Lots of tafes offer 2/3 year diplomas that you can finish at uni and it will cost you much less. Also, if you have a skill that can't be off shored you'll have future job security. My brother is a carpenter and is on a much better wicket than me (graphic designer) and I went to uni (not in a design field) and restudied at TAFE.  Education is never wasted, so even if your degree doesn't turn out to be want you want, it doesn't mean you still can't do something else :)"

sydney,3e1t3b,BigglesInAus,3,Tue Jul 21 09:23:45 2015 UTC,"kinda is not going to cut it, imo. Whilst what you do at uni can and likely be largely different to what you would do in the real world you need to have a fundamental interest in the area.  Personally, i enjoy my field but i didnt anticipate it to be so stressful, and it was my interest in the field that sustained me through the teething period that is your first real industry job. Without interest and enjoyment i'd imagine you would be more likely to quit/leave/etc. which will lead to regret.  (this is my unchecked opinion) Commerce and business degrees seem to be to go to degree for undecideds. It provides the illusion of direction and future that an arts degree is perceived as missing. Alot of the people i knew that dropped out, changed, deferred, etc were commerce/business majors. Apparently there is a huge oversupply of graduates there. So if your kinda interested, you probably going to kinda try and your results will be kinda okay. and you know what. you will kinda have trouble finding a industry job.  Sorry to sound rude, its a difficult decision and really shouldnt be made when your this young, but thats the world. you really need to properly research all aspects to find something suitable for you. there isnt any one resource thats going to give you the answer."

There are always options - if not in the short term then in the longer term. Finish your first degree, apply as a post-grad student. Do a masters course.

sydney,3e1t3b,stephaniexrae,4,Tue Jul 21 13:08:45 2015 UTC,"To figure out what uni is right for you, you should have an idea of what you want to get out of the experience.Go to open days and get a sense of the vibe and community at each university. Figure out what kind of environment you want - do you just want to study and focus on things outside of uni or do you want to immerse yourself in student life with clubs and societies, etc.? Bigger universities (from my own experience/experience of friends) such as USYD/UNSW/UTS have greta community/student life due to the sheer number of students and the size/location of the primary locations. Focusing on the academics, speak to other students, talk to professors and unit coordinators at open days, email the universities! (also, look at what majors different universities offer, I chose USYD because of its huge range in arts majors/units which allowed me the opportunity to branch out to more specific subjects and figure out what I wanted to do)  I was hoping to do law/arts when I finished high school but missed out by a few marks, so I decided to do a three year BA Arts degree where I study majors that I love more than my original plan. Basically what I'm saying is that unfortunately the ATAR system works on a supply and demand basis and no matter how intelligent and passionate you are, you may miss out on what you want. Don't be afraid in that case to try something different, but if you're still unsure, take a gap year/s and come back to it. Also remember that during that time off you can do vocational study at TAFE or take community classes at places like USYD's CCE or Sydney Community College to help figure out what you want to do. Lastly, there is no shame in what you study or where you study.  I think you get 9 choices on UAC, and you receive one offer per round (how you order your applied courses is important in relation to what offers you get). However, you can rearrange your applied course order, and you can also apply for university in other states such as Victoria through VTAC."
sydney,3e1t3b,abfguisf,3,Tue Jul 21 09:46:41 2015 UTC,don't go to a uni because it has the highest cutoff firstly. Go to a uni for what its reputable for. E.g. go to unsw for engineering or computer science. Research what uni is good for what dont just go for cutoffs and prestige.   To help you with second choices we need to know what your first choice is. E.g. If you want to get into engineering but don't have your first preference. You can do science which is usually lower cutoff and transfer  to engineering and you wont waste much time because first year subjects are similar.
sydney,3e1t3b,PavlovianIgnorance,2,Tue Jul 21 10:21:12 2015 UTC,I really don't have many preferences as of yet. I've had my eyes on Law for a while but recently my marks haven't really been going too well and i'm expecting around an 85 ATAR based off previous marks.
sydney,3e1t3b,littlewoolie,3,Tue Jul 21 10:25:26 2015 UTC,"The second tier universities are fine, like someone else said, once you have your first job your experience will count for more.  I would suggest do the degree you are most excited by, not the one you are excited by the pay!    After 10-15 years after uni the only people I know who are doing a job that directly flows on from their degree are teachers and nurses.  Everyone else has combined their education with their personal interests to find some really funky niches that you wouldn't know exist otherwise.  Trust yourself, you will to.  Do something you love, and you won't be dragging yourself out of bed to go to class, just make sure it is not a degree in performing arts ... those guys just don't find jobs (kinda joking, kinda not).  Good luck, there are no bad decisions, just different paths."

sydney,3e1t3b,abfguisf,2,Tue Jul 21 13:11:56 2015 UTC,"There are alternative ways to get into law. I finished with a 76 ATAR. I didn't get into law and took a year off after year 12. In March-ish of my gap year, I applied for mid-year entry into Monash in Melbourne, and got in even though the ATAR cut off was 86, I think. So after a year at Monash (2 years after Yr 12 ended), I applied through VTAC (Vic equivalent of UAC) to Law/Arts at Deakin and got in, even though the cut off is 90. That was because they looked at my HSC marks, but not my ATAR.   So don't stress if you don't get the ATAR you need because there are other pathways into it :)"
sydney,3e1t3b,abfguisf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:01:37 2015 UTC,if you dont get into law straight away don't fret. Say you want to do arts and law. Enrol in arts first and do as well as you can then you can transfer into arts and law after 1 semester i believe.
sydney,3e1t3b,abfguisf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:37:38 2015 UTC,Do all universities offer opportunities like this?
sydney,3e1t3b,speccy2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:54:41 2015 UTC,I believe so yeah. For engineering you only need to get at least 65 in each subject for first semester and you can transfer into engineering. For law you might have to get 70 or 75.
sydney,3e1t3b,DVWLD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:26:21 2015 UTC,Are majors in Arts a factor to transfers?
sydney,3e1t3b,puppy2010,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:27:37 2015 UTC,"doesnt matter what degree you do first semester. As long as you get the required mark to transfer to law. When you do law  you have to do something with law like commerce, arts, science or engineering, you can't do law by itself. So say if you chose arts/law you probably would want to choose just arts if you didnt make the cutoff. Get the 70 or 75 in arts and transfer to arts/law."
sydney,3e1t3b,thedayved,2,Tue Jul 21 12:50:19 2015 UTC,"No, only your marks. The law faculty couldn't care less about your other degree, only how you perform. So if law is really your goal, get into any degree, anywhere, and work your butt off. If you can get a mix of Ds and HDs, you're in.  EDIT: I was a mature-age entry into law, didn't even get an ATAR in high school, let alone a low one. But a strong showing in my uni prep course and high score on the ALSET got me in."
sydney,3e1t3b,superjjskate,4,Tue Jul 21 12:59:13 2015 UTC,"I have hired many staff. I have never once paid attention to which university their degree came from, if they even had a degree.  If you have no idea what you want to do, take a year out of education and get a job or travel. It'll give you a sense of what's out there.  If you feel you must go straight to uni, do a general but useful degree. Business/commerce would be my suggestion. You'll pick up some useful knowledge that can be applied to most any career you choose."
sydney,3e1t3b,starrzz,3,Tue Jul 21 11:21:28 2015 UTC,"If you don't know what to do but are determined to go to uni, you should start off by studying a generalist degree like Arts or Commerce/Business. In either of those there's plenty of majors to choose from so it's pretty open ended, or you can transfer to another degree once you have a better idea of what you want to do.  But despite what parents/friends/teachers/Whirlpool might tell you though, you don't need to go to uni to be successful in life. Have you looked into trades (eg plumbing, electrical, carpentry etc) at all?"
sydney,3e1t3b,thedayved,2,Tue Jul 21 11:53:15 2015 UTC,I did work experience in year 10 with trade like work and physical labour but I don't think i'm too cut out to do it tbh.
sydney,3e1t3b,yourarm,5,Tue Jul 21 11:56:48 2015 UTC,"I was pretty much the same as you, it's a shitfight to find any info so i'll try & hep you out    What will a degree at a harder entry uni such as Sydney give me that I cant get at somewhere like ACU?   From my understanding, the more prestigious universities (UNSW, USYD etc) generally look more favourable as a degree, but only in certain circumstances. Eg: if two people go for one position with the exam same marks, one graduate from USYD is gonna beat out UWS students hands down. I know tons of graduates who have told me that your degree is pretty much gonna be relevant in getting you your first entry level position, after that you're pretty much gonna be assessed on experience in combination with your degree. IMO, if i had to put a percentage on significance i'd say that it's 75% your marks, and 25% where you attended.   If I were to not achieve the ATAR I needed for a high-end degree, what other entries to that degree are possible?   Plenty. If you're going for some of the lesser significant uni's, you've got the option of doing a diploma of something at tafe or whatever and transferring to uni. Alternatively, the general rule of thumb is that once you complete 8 units (12 months) of uni, you can transfer IF you've got good enough marks. I followed this path, and i feel that this is 10000x easier than the HSC (a credit average can get you into a 90+ ATAR course any day).   How many things can I apply for?   Up to 9 through uac, but you'll only get 1 offer per round. usually there's a couple of rounds before main round, and then maybe 1 or 2 afterwards. you list them under 'priorities', so you get assessed for your most desirable course"
sydney,3e1t3b,patlis,2,Tue Jul 21 09:04:00 2015 UTC,Don't forget you can only get one offer. You can get varying more offers if you change your first offer and take it away from being first preference. I managed to get three offers last year.
sydney,3e1t3b,superjjskate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:27:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. Will doing 8 units of certain degrees give me better chances of transferring into other degrees?
sydney,3e1t3b,ilovewatermelon,2,Tue Jul 21 09:17:49 2015 UTC,"Most universities provide foundation courses in the summer break, which are designed to teach you the basics that you need to know to commence that degree."
sydney,3e1t3b,aahjyoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:42:39 2015 UTC,"nah dude, doesn't matter what units you do at all. You could do 8 arts units and try and get accepted into law if you wanted, well at least im pretty sure unsw and uts work that way. But i think you'd be mental to pick different units just to try to get into a different course. If you're transferring between uni's and keeping the same degree, most of the time they'll give you academic credit."
sydney,3e1t3b,notquitedrdeath,2,Tue Jul 21 09:58:58 2015 UTC,"If you're looking at anything engineering related at UNSW, check out FEAS, which lets you do engineering with an ATAR of 81+ based on an interview and other non-academic criteria."

sydney,3e1t3b,taciturnlurker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:05:51 2015 UTC,"What will a degree at a harder entry uni such as Sydney give me that I cant get at somewhere like ACU?   While the prestige is the shallow benefit, but in reality a lot of it is about the cohort - you'll generally be with smarter and more driven people which can affect some people a lot. i.e. I am very much a group learner and feel being in friendly competition and collaboration with my course friends is the hugely beneficial for my studies. Some other people prefer to study alone, which this wouldn't really apply. For most courses, the coursework and teaching will be pretty much the same.   If I were to not achieve the ATAR I needed for a high-end degree, what other entries to that degree are possible?   Cross uni transfer - do the same degree at a uni then transfer to a better degree, OR Internal uni degree transfer - do a lesser degree (BA or BSc) at the same uni then transfer up into your preferred degree. Internal uni transfer is generally much easier than between unis."

sydney,3e0cec,MavEtJu,5,Tue Jul 21 02:12:01 2015 UTC,"Parental tip: When going to Canberra we often stay in Goulburn for the night so we only have to drive one hour in the morning so everybody is fresh when arriving at the Floriade.  If your kids are young enough: Do it during a weekday.  And afterwards go to the other things to be done in Canberra: National Gallery (not so kids friendly), Australia Museum (pretty kids friendly), Questacon (very kids friendly) and of course cycling around the lake, the Zoo, botanical gardens, walking on the mountains/forests nearby."
sydney,3e0cec,im_philbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:56 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't you just drive the entire way and then drive like ten minutes in the morning?
sydney,3e0cec,Jammb,3,Tue Jul 21 03:06:32 2015 UTC,"It's the difference between, for the kids, of going to sleep at 20:30-21:00 instead of 22:00. And the associated tiredness in the morning.  And for me the ability to relax a little bit more before going to sleep."
sydney,3e0cec,Scuzzbag,2,Tue Jul 21 03:49:36 2015 UTC,Heaps cheaper to stay in Goulburn
sydney,3e0cec,CocaCoal,5,Tue Jul 21 03:08:14 2015 UTC,"It depends if you really, really really like flowers.  If not, I'd go at another time when it's not crazy busy.  The questacon is fantastic for kids.  The war memorial is amazing too, kids (especially boys) love the museum with all the planes, tanks etc."
sydney,3e0cec,whiskybearapocalypse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:43:35 2015 UTC,This is exactly why we are weighing our option to go or not. We are not that flower connossiuer. Granted we'd like to see the spectacle but to hustle and bustle with the crowd with 2 kids maybe a bit of a challenge.   I think we'd rather see the other suggestions listed here so that the kids will enjoy the experience.
sydney,3e0cec,timix,7,Tue Jul 21 02:47:08 2015 UTC,"Ex Truck driver here:  It's not a 3 hour drive, it's a 6 hour drive overall with no stopping (there and return).  The hotels and motels in Canberra are vastly overpriced and often booked out during floriade.  Better to stay in Queanbeyan, we normally hit up the leagues hotel."
sydney,3e0cec,H00ded,3,Tue Jul 21 00:36:04 2015 UTC,"Haha. Yes, I meant one-way 3hr drive. Thanks for the tip. I'll check out Queanbeyan"
sydney,3e0cec,sloppyrock,3,Tue Jul 21 00:45:56 2015 UTC,"Make a booking to tour the Parliament House gardens. In the past, they've had special tours on during floriade time. Great building. But much better on a tour. And even better when going through usually not public areas."
sydney,3e0cec,megablast,3,Tue Jul 21 00:30:52 2015 UTC,"It's boring and not worth the effort. If you wanted to go to Canberra anyways, fine, but it's definitely not something you would make the trip for. There is other stuff nearby - Questacon, Parliament House(s), Nat Portrait Gallery, the wonky museum at Black Mtn Peninsula, etc. Depends whether you want to make a (short) trip of it, I guess.  Source: had to drive through the swarms of auto-mode-dslr-carrying, grey haired, bum-bag-wearing dickheads leisurely strolling across Commonwealth Avenue in peak hour every September for too many years."

sydney,3e0e9r,therkd,4,Tue Jul 21 02:02:06 2015 UTC,"Lots of good information.   I like that they are reviewing the frequent travel discounts:   IPART seeks comments on the following 12 Do you receive any benefit from the current weekly and daily caps? Do you receive any benefit from the weekly travel reward? How fair do you think the current discounts are? 13 Does the weekly travel reward (free trips after you pay for the first eight journeys) encourage you to use more public transport than you would otherwise? Are you more likely to make shorter bus or light rail journeys early in the week in order to access the discount sooner? 14 Would you support discounted fares on more services (eg, a $2.50 daily cap for rail, bus and light rail travel on Saturdays and Sundays) if that meant that you were unable to use free trips during peak times?    Also note that the last question sort of implies that ferries would be removed from the discounted daily caps on weekends.  This makes sense to me as they have become overcrowded heavily-subsidized harbour cruises - this probably isn't ideal long term."
sydney,3e0e9r,SilverStar9192,3,Tue Jul 21 01:50:05 2015 UTC,"I will guess so that I can come back to this post, but I would wager at least a 15% fare increase across the board, closing of the $15/weekly travel loophole, a sharp increase in short distance and multi-modal trips with significant cost bump for the buses where distances over 5KM are done."
sydney,3e0e9r,thelindsay,3,Tue Jul 21 00:19:47 2015 UTC,"at least a 15% fare increase across the board   I don't think that is contemplated.  They do talk about possibly increasing base fares in order to accommodate other revisions to the fare structure, such as discounted off-peak fares for modes that don't currently have them, but the paper isn't focused on mass revenue-raising via huge increases."

sydney,3e0gwo,puppy2010,3,Tue Jul 21 03:48:06 2015 UTC,Good point! Looks like about 1h 20m to get there which is more than an unmotivated person would travel for work for low wage work. Sydney transport is great and cheap if you're on a train line that runs to where you want to go. If not you're stuffed.
sydney,3e0gwo,idontknowhwatimdoing,4,Tue Jul 21 04:14:36 2015 UTC,They could travel to the CBD or Parramatta in less time than Bella Vista (on public transport).
sydney,3e0gwo,puppy2010,6,Tue Jul 21 04:16:36 2015 UTC,"It's not just Bella Vista/Norwest (which is probably closer to 30/40 minutes if you don't pay tolls and account for peak traffic)  Blacktown, Penrith, Parramatta. All within a 30 minute train trip. Marsden Park and Weitherill Park, both big industrial areas. These places have plenty jobs which don't necessarily require tertiary qualifications.   On top of that, anybody saying they can't complete education needs to take their head out. UWS has a campus 10 minutes from St Marys. They have comparitvely low entry requirements, and plenty of pathways programs.   There are also a host of TAFE nearby. And the government supports people in full time education.  Plenty of hard workers live out this way and they are willing to travel to get there. I used to spend an hour and a half each way getting to my job every day.   It's not like there aren't jobs between Penrith and the Sydney CBD."
sydney,3e0gwo,maekattt,4,Tue Jul 21 04:12:31 2015 UTC,"I think places like the Central Coast would be more disadvantaged in that respect. At least in Mount Druitt you don't have to go far to find jobs. Lots of warehousing work in Eastern Creek and Erskine Park which is 10-20 minutes drive/bus ride away, which is pretty easy work to get and doesn't require many qualifications."
sydney,3e0gwo,puppy2010,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:19:00 2015 UTC,I completely agree. Regional areas (basically anywhere that isn't a capital city) have had issues with employment even for those with skills and qualifications.

sydney,3e07ni,ronnknee,3,Tue Jul 21 00:04:22 2015 UTC,Yea I remember my friend had to pay them when he went to pick up his wallet. His money was missing even though it was reported that it was found with money.
sydney,3e07ni,boblikesbeer,5,Tue Jul 21 04:14:34 2015 UTC,The money is normally removed when found and counted. The money is put in the safe and a slip is kept with the lost item which can be dropped off at a ticket office for the return of the money.
sydney,3e07ni,ronnknee,3,Tue Jul 21 04:30:51 2015 UTC,Interesting. I didn't know that. Not sure if there was a slip with the wallet.
sydney,3e07ni,boblikesbeer,3,Tue Jul 21 04:57:20 2015 UTC,Just to make it clear when the item is handed in it will stay at the station for about a week before been sent to Central. When it is at the station there is no fee for collection and it can be sent to another station at the owners request so they can claim it within reason.

sydney,3e0vg6,SilverStar9192,-6,Tue Jul 21 02:59:42 2015 UTC,Sydney public transport is very expensive not just regionally but also at an national and international scale.

Co-working spaces are really the best option then and you will simply need to be realistic that it will cost you money.  There's really no economic reason why someone should supply you a work place for free, is there?  I mean, it's nice that libraries exist and some suggestions were given along those lines, but if you're after a regular/permanent arrangement, co-working is the best option.

sydney,3e0vg6,kevlarman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:44:10 2015 UTC,"I think that headline is wrong.  Nowhere in the article does it say that Sydney has the most expensive public transport fares.  It only says that fares are more expensive than in some developing markets.  That's probably true but hardly a fair comparison.  If you compare to places like Tokyo, Singapore, London, or NYC, you will find that Sydney's fares are particularly cheap, especially for mid-range and longer distances.  (Sydney does have a slightly higher base fare for trains than some other locations for short trips.)   Sydney is an amazingly good deal compared to London and NYC is in particular - the Asian cities are more affordable but not hugely so.  Here's a comparison I did a while back:  https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/2xvvxr/uni_concession/cp3wvxg  I wouldn't know anything about Opal runners, no siree :)"

My agent is happy with this arrangement (the landlord is absentee and doesn't give a shit), and just asks that I update him with name and contact number of the other occupant(s) when they change.  Since you mention you have the income/ability to cover the rent yourself if need be, I suspect this will work out best for you.   As noted if you don't want to have full responsibility you need to organise your co-tenants ahead of time and apply jointly. Agents don't like this as its more work for them for the same commission, but some landlords will insist on it for share houses.  In this case, if a co-tenant leaves they have to be replaced with a new tenant who is approved by the landlord - you wouldn't be the sole arbiter of this.   Also note that even if each tenant is on the lease they are all jointly responsible for paying the whole rent of the unit. So if one tenant does a runner it doesn't protect you from having to cough up their share. The landlord still must get paid.  Good luck!"

sydney,3dzdsz,Manky_Dingo,3,Tue Jul 21 03:44:20 2015 UTC,"You'd probably be better off dealing with an agent unless your landlords have sense and aren't just money hungry assholes.  It's hard to tell what they're like though until stuff needs fixing or they need to handle other complaints. An agent will also provide proof through an agreement so if you ever end up in a situation where the tenancy body has to be involved, it's all official."

If a RE Agent approves you and your GF, they might object to either modifying the lease or permitting sub-letting later."

It's not a bar to go to alone- the people there are not engaging or willing to include strangers. Not sure what I was hoping for to be honest.... Overall it was ok but I won't be back. Good to grab a single drink with a friend on a week night after a long day shopping just as a way to round out the day and say you've done it.   As dorky as this is, I'd like it more if they had quick table top games (hello Munchkin) and an app or message board you could use to sign up to play at an appointed time. Maybe have a 10$ reservation fee that covers your first drink."

sydney,3dx6qg,derhelo,2,Mon Jul 20 08:27:03 2015 UTC,"My brother just gets an accountant every year. If you're not getting all of it back, it's probably worth looking into. (If you can find a good one)  A good accountant gets more tax back than their fee costs you. And then claims their fee as a tax deduction the following year."
sydney,3dx6qg,walkerreuben,6,Mon Jul 20 08:37:34 2015 UTC,"An accountant can't claim anything or do anything differently than what you can.  Next time if you want to save the fee, study the return and learn what they're doing.  If your tax situation is simple, that is - e.g. don't own property or have fancy investments."
sydney,3dx6qg,SilverStar9192,5,Mon Jul 20 08:44:42 2015 UTC,"This right here. I'm an accountant and you speak the truth. What value an accountant does bring however, is the ability to provide tax advice on your specific situation. (If it isn't a simple salary earner).   For normal salary earners, I usually recommend etax or mytax. Ive had a brief look at mytax and is extremely user friendly."

Nope, your educational institution must share the data with TfNSW to confirm eligibility, for card issuance and ongoing eligibility checks.  If your institution isn't on the list, but you have a concession foil sticker, you can continue to purchase concession paper tickets, but won't be able to request/order an Opal card."

sydney,3dxq3k,PurpleKirby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:09:28 2015 UTC,I knew people who got one by getting their friends and having their friends get another one. not sure if the system has limits per name by now but this was early on in the year when some universities didn't get their opals yet. totally not legal and good luck if u wish to try that
sydney,3dxq3k,Brosley,-1,Tue Jul 21 07:25:34 2015 UTC,"It only seems silly right now. The government has made it quite clear that paper tickets will all be retired in due course. Once they do that, the ticketing system generally will be a lot more effective at preventing people who are not eligible from accessing concessions.  Unless you live in NSW, you will likely lose access to these concessions when they stop selling the relevant paper tickets. Presumably ACT universities will need to be registered eventually, but I imagine that they are a low priority because most of their students would not be eligible on account of living in the ACT (because you must be a NSW resident to be eligible)."
sydney,3dxq3k,Brosley,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:19:57 2015 UTC,Having a valid transport concession foil will no longer entitle me to concession fares?
sydney,3dxq3k,omegagoose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:38:12 2015 UTC,"Well, no. The little sticker on your student card is not used for Opal. Instead, your eligibility checked electronically when you order a Concession Opal card. Then, whenever you are using your Opal card, you just need to carry your student ID card (with or without the sticker - it makes no difference). Ticket inspectors can use an app to read your Opal card and check your details and presumably match them to your student card, though they in practice they don't seem to worry too much about that part.  The sticker universities put on student cards doesn't really serve a purpose anymore, so I'd say it is safe to assume that when Transport for NSW - the government department that produces both those stickers and manages Opal - stops selling paper tickets, they will also stop sending out the stickers (except maybe for people who want to use services that don't have Opal).  Basically, the sticker is meant to prove that the bearer is eligible, but now they can do that electronically. But like I said, if you don't live in NSW, you are not eligible for student concessions in NSW anyway. I would be very surprised if a large part of the rationale for using online checks instead of stickers isn't that universities used to just hand them out to anyone they felt like, including ACT students. There have definitely been similar complaints on r/Sydney from New Zealanders (who are also not eligible)."
sydney,3dxq3k,Brosley,3,Mon Jul 20 21:52:08 2015 UTC,You still need the foil to get student fares on Countrylink trains - which is a bit annoying because many universities didn't automatically issue foils (or new student cards) at all this year
sydney,3dxq3k,SilverStar9192,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:47:40 2015 UTC,"That's true, and the same goes for local buses in regional towns, like Dubbo or Armidale, which don't have Opal.  They might well continue to use the concessions stickers for these services, but it looks like once they stop selling paper tickets, that sticker would only be used for these non-Opal services - that is, the sticker would cease to get you a concession on metro services and you would instead need to use the Concession Opal card (or pay full fare)."
sydney,3dxq3k,Brosley,3,Tue Jul 21 01:05:01 2015 UTC,Buses as close by as Picton aren't on Opal and need the concession sticker for their concession fares.  Also the concession sticker is useful for other businesses which offer discounts to students - like Taronga Zoo.
sydney,3dxq3k,SilverStar9192,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:23:39 2015 UTC,"I doubt that TfNSW is going to keep issuing concession stickers for the benefit of third parties like Taronga Zoo. But yes, everything that doesn't take Opal cards will need something (either a sticker or some replacement for it) to allow students to prove their eligibility for concessions.  My point was more that they will become worthless for most students once you can't buy a concession paper ticket within Sydney, because the only public transport the vast majority of students are ever going to use are Opal services in Sydney.  This is probably why many universities stopped issuing them to all eligible students this year, and started issuing them only by exception or on request."
sydney,3dxq3k,Brosley,2,Tue Jul 21 02:28:55 2015 UTC,"TfNSW hasn't signaled that they are going to roll out Opal to regional buses/trains or provide any kind of option besides the stickers for regional students.  So universities will still need to issue them upon request for the foreseeable future.   Keep in mind some universities like Charles Sturt, Southern Cross, and University of New England, primarily operate in these areas."

This is not an excuse, it's a poor design.  Just an explanation...  Supposedly this is because of the way the gates are an old model that was only retrofitted to take Opal.  The new design gates, which can be seen at Olympic Park for example, should be faster."

sydney,3dy8eq,scottx2,4,Mon Jul 20 14:44:11 2015 UTC,"The trains in Sydney are like metros. Just buy a ticket and sit anywhere or stand. The 2 stations that serve the airport are premium stops, so will cost about $17 each way from memory. They arrive every few minutes, give yourself 30 mins each way. tripadvisor  Head to Circular Quay station to see The Opera House and Harbour Bridge and the Rocks area, it should be on the same train line.  Ferries make for cheap harbour cruises.  You could just dawdle south through the cbd with your spare time, get on nearest train then headback when ready.  You could go up Sydney Tower.  I don't know of any Hop on Hop off, but I guess they might exist, not sure what they would show you."

sydney,3dy8eq,SilverStar9192,5,Mon Jul 20 22:52:43 2015 UTC,"There is a Hop On , Hop Off tour but it is fairly expensive for what it is ($40 per person).  Given you're already going to have to pay a lot for your train ticket from the airport, I would give it a miss and just catch a ferry to Manly instead - as mentioned the ferries are a great way to see the harbour.   If you are wedded to this idea though, check out Sydney Explorer Bus Tours.  To save on transport costs, I would consider getting an Opal card and loading $30 on it (there is no fee for the card itself).  You can get them from the airport rail station or the news agent in the airport arrivals area.  This will be enough for the airport gate pass fee ($13) and the daily maximum for transport fares of $15, which will include the Manly ferry (and any other ferries, train rides, or buses, except for the private Fast Ferry).  When you return to the airport your card will be charged another gate pass fee ($10) but it can go negative - just throw away the card.  Paying $30 for your Opal card would be a lot less than separately buying a return train ticket ($35.60) and a return Manly ferry ticket ($15.20) - a total of $50.80 !

If you can walk a reasonable distance (~2km) you will be fine. Take the train to Circular Quay where you can see the Opera House, Harbour Bridge and the Rocks. Walk down George St and see the Sydney Tower, Queen Victoria Building and all the shops. Then walk down to Darling Harbour and have a look around there, there is an Aquarium and little zoo with Australian animals. There is also a free bus (Route 555) that travels up and down George St if you get tired of walking. Have taken many international cousins of mine on this route and they always seem to be happy with how much they see. Hope this helps."

My name had come up in a search warrant, and could I please contact them. Imagine his panic (and mine as I wondered WTF had gone down while I was at work). Turns out it was the box.  The best I can figure is that the jam man discarded the box, someone had found it in the alley, thought ""ooh that's handy"", and taken it home to store their [I don't want to know] in before being raided. I called the station, left a message telling the ridiculous story about jam, and thankfully never heard back.  I haven't thrown anything out with my name on it since then. You're not paranoid!"

sydney,3dvuyq,SilverStar9192,3,Mon Jul 20 07:41:23 2015 UTC,That's so weird. It's really common in Singapore. It's another case where a British term survives in a far flung former colony when it's died out in the motherland/other former colonies.

It's physical work but it's interesting, you get to play with big toys, the hours are flexible and you get skills and qualifications that transfer well to other industries down the track.   No experience necessary because entry level is literally throwing bags until they train you up (and they tend to upskill you quite quickly), and a high turnover of staff (some because the work is physical, mostly because the industry is volatile in terms of carrier contracts chopping and changing) means that someone is always hiring."

I'd say all you'd need to do is find any aftermarket audio installer that is an authorised Pioneer dealer, and presumably they can source the appropriate model head units as well as the other upgrades you're interested in.

I downloaded it on the condition that if I ever get any inappropriate photos I'd be telling their parents immediately (which thankfully I haven't had to do).  Since then a lot of my friends have also started using it. What I like - it's basically instagram without the likes etc. You can literally take a photo of something in the ""instant"" and send it to someone. It adds a sense of ""This is where I am and what I'm doing"" without being a status update etc - and I guess because of that you can tailor it to certain friends - e.g. see a cute dog, send it to my friends that are obsessed with cute dogs. At a sporting event - selfie in my scarf and beanie and send it to my friends that are into sport.  It's this short in the moment interaction tool which I kinda dig.

What are you going to do when you have your first child and realize you have to feed it everyday for the next 18 years? Quit? Run away from your problems?  If you want to quit, do it. But after you quit the easy part of life, get ready for the hard part."
sydney,3dtm6l,TrappedInMyConcious,31,Sun Jul 19 09:53:50 2015 UTC,Totally agree.  Uni isn't for everyone but year 12 is.
sydney,3dtm6l,Jammb,6,Sun Jul 19 12:18:03 2015 UTC,Absolutely this.   The work habits you establish now will become harder to change the older you get. Make good habits now and it'll make things easier later.
sydney,3dtm6l,Shockmouth,3,Sun Jul 19 11:56:31 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with the last line. Young people tend to think that having a job and making money is awesome and easy, they soon realize how hard it is when you have 50 bucks to last you the week for food, and socializing."

sydney,3dtm6l,tomdickandhairy,3,Mon Jul 20 23:48:22 2015 UTC,"I'm eighteen, working full time, living by myself and dropped out after completing year nine due to bullying. Trust me, it took me a lot of courage, hard work and determination to get up and leave than it would have taken for me to stay in school. Year twelve isn't for everyone. I'm now working in finance and hiring people who have just finished their HSC. Sure, I'll never be a doctor or a lawyer, but that's okay because I don't think having a high ranking job is a good tool to measure your self worth. It's good you're questioning things. Take all the advice you've gotten here and make the choice you think will make you happiest. Don't be scared by people saying it'll only get harder. School was way harder for me, and I'm happy with the choice I made. Don't ""knuckle down"" and keep your head in the sand, question things and think :)"
sydney,3dtm6l,lachlansreddit,29,Mon Jul 20 09:21:49 2015 UTC,"Don't drop out unless you have an apprenticeship lined up. Finishing your education with only a School Certificate is essentially lining yourself up for only menial jobs, and even those are disappearing in this day and age.   Knuckle down and continue your studies. See if you have remedial options or can repeat Year 10 or do additional tutoring or something. It's going to be hard, since you'll have to cover more ground to work back to the standard of your peers, but it's better to do that than to resign yourself to drudgery."
sydney,3dtm6l,InstantShiningWizard,21,Sun Jul 19 10:02:41 2015 UTC,"I didn't do particularly well in high school. Got 52.75 as my HSC score (in NSW). I had no plans to go to uni, but I had always said I would finish HS, just to show I could.  HS wasn't good to me. I didn't respond well to that type of teaching at all. I hated being ""micro managed"" with my education and I hated the learning and regurgitating information, rather than actually analysing.  Three years after I finished school, I decided I wanted to try university. Based on my finishing HS and being ""mature Age"" my application was enough to get accepted to a communications degree. I didn't really want to do communications, but I figured I would start and see how it went. I made it through my first year with fairly decent grades (which, I won't lie, was pretty hard work). That year of uni and good grades enabled me to transfer into a double bachelor of communications/bachelor of law.   I got addicted to education once I started law. I finished both degrees. Got admitted to practise law. Started a coursework masters (nearly finished) and am half way through shaping an application for a masters by research degree. Oh, and I'm one of the few law grads who is actually practising law.  My advice: education is generally a good investment. You may not think that you'll ever want to use it but you might change your mind, and having completed HS will make it much easier for you if you do!"
sydney,3dtm6l,Forgotmyfknpassword2,16,Sun Jul 19 11:11:55 2015 UTC,I thought of not going on to year 12 but my mum said if I didn't have a job by the time school went back I'd have to do Year 12. I didn't find a job over the holidays so I went back. My grades weren't great but I'm glad I did my HSC in the end.
sydney,3dtm6l,lazydazy246,9,Sun Jul 19 09:56:19 2015 UTC,"I've been reading through this thread and noticed you want to go into Real Estate. I'm really happy you have an idea of what you want to do if you do finish school at year 10, however, I need to encourage you to stay in school because those two final years will help you mature and ready you for the work world.   I'm 23 and work in a commercial real estate office in reception and admin. I was 100% ready to drop out in high school but my mum kept on supporting me and begged me to keep going and I am so happy that she did, as shit as school was to me I do not regret my senior years. I didn't get the grades I wanted but did multiple Tafe courses until I found what I wanted.   Please, I know what it's like to have people give up on you, I have been exactly in your position. Please get your HSC, even if you don't get into uni, go get your Real Estate licence and start working in a small firm and then progress into university. The more you learn the better qualified you become and then incredible job opportunities will open up for you.  I got away with not going to university but like I said I'm only in admin and I plan on enrolling eventually. The guys that do the real estate/ property management side of things are in their mid to late twenties and are studying their masters. All of the people I have met look at education as the most important thing you can achieve in life, you can never stop learning. So please, I'm begging you, please stay in school, talk to me if you need to I'm always here to help."
sydney,3dtm6l,_TheCleaningLady_,8,Sun Jul 19 10:53:23 2015 UTC,"The point of school is the learning.  You learn so much stuff that you will never have the time and opportunity to learn after you finish.  Marks mean nothing, ignore the numbers they write on your tests.  Right now you are in the easiest part of life.  You can cruise in, hang out with your friends all day and go home early.  You can even skip classes and just hang out.  Soon you will have to find a way to pay for your own life.  If you have no money, you go hungry and sleep on the street.  Being a grown up is real.  I didn't like school that much either but if you asked me now if I would like to go back to that point and spend a couple of years with no bills and no pressure,  sheeeiit I'd be there instantly."
sydney,3dtm6l,gentlemanofleisure,6,Sun Jul 19 11:18:16 2015 UTC,"IMO you should just pull yourself together and power through the rest of high school. You're only 2 years from finishing highschool and doing the HSC, and a lot can change in that time. If you start laying down some good study habits now, you can very well get a great HSC mark.  Year 10-12 should be an incredibly influential time in your life, and you should be exposed to a large variety of opportunities and options for post-highschool. Around about after Year 10 was when I completely changed my career goals/direction. And going through Year 10-12 will equip you with study skills which may be valuable to you later in life."

Don't just settle for a shit job with no room for advancement though, even if you don't see school in your future try to find a job with room for growth and advancement."
sydney,3dtm6l,maxwellsmartarse,5,Sun Jul 19 12:10:35 2015 UTC,"What's the benefit of dropping out now? What are you going to do with these two years that's going to be more valuable than getting a HSC?  Having your year 12 certificate is going to give you more options down the track, if you want to change your mind and switch careers. It's becoming more normal for people to have 3-4 different vocations, and if you decide to get a tertiary qualification some time down the track it might be necessary to have finished year 12."

There was a story of a kid who did work experience after school as the secretary and worked his way up to realestate agent by 22. This is what you need to do if your serious about it. Don't tell them about school just go there and tell them your keen. Alternatively do the rage course and volunteer, you need to impress them."

sydney,3dtm6l,chezty,2,Sun Jul 19 10:10:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly, walk in there resume in hand, dressed well and ask them if you can file papers answer phones and learn from them for free after school/on weekends. If you pick a real estate agent in a nice suburb, working your way up will be worth it. If you volunteer for 3 months you can ask for minimum wage and they will likely give it to you as you are already trained and ready to go. From there you ask to help agents at open houses and auctions and do office work after school a couple of nights a week. If they like you enough they will tell you to get you realestate qualifications and you'll handle rentals. It's shit work but where they all start, best to do it while your young and live at home. Stick it out and perform and you'll be selling realestate and another parasite on Sydney's realestate boom in no time."

I have noticed that are a lot of homeless people sleeping in the train station at night. Today I was sitting down in the main hall of central waiting for my friend at 10:30pm. I was only there for 20 mins, but I was freezing my ass off despite my big coat. I couldn't possibly imagine what it would be like to be homeless like that.  It really made you think how lucky some of us are, especially you can tell some of these people probably have some serious mental health issues.  I sometimes easily blow a hundred to two hundred bucks on a night out with friends. So I have decided I am going to not drink for a month in September. Instead, everytime I want to get a drink, I am gonna save that money up and donate it to charity at the end of the month."

One I have been to a few times is on... Sussex Street, somewhere behind the Cinema complex. Can't find the name at the moment but you go underground. The place is old, but the staff there are really nice.  If you've been to a couple, you notice that the format and food are all the same. It's really up to the atmosphere of the place to have a good experience. So that's a good shop on a busy night, and having a table full of fun people.  Perhaps it could be a subreddit meet event?"

sydney,3dsx84,SilverStar9192,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:40:44 2015 UTC,"Luckily, on the salary I mentioned above this is not half. Thanks for the advice though, I've been reading 30% is the cutoff and anything more would not be worth it."
sydney,3dsx84,sunada,6,Sun Jul 19 04:45:53 2015 UTC,"depending on the actual numbers, what you are quoting above appears to be very close to half (after tax).  anyway, i overpay on rent too and love it, so don't let me stop you. you're young and will get a lot of enjoyment from it. a flatshare in the CBD or newtown seems good for you."
sydney,3dsx84,sunshinebuns,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:38:10 2015 UTC,"That's definitely something I've been considering, I don't go to clubs very much and prefer smaller bars and then relaxing at home so I'm not too stressed if I do overpay slightly.

sydney,3dsx84,champerty,3,Sun Jul 19 08:01:58 2015 UTC,"The 30% recommendation is of your after-tax income. Don't forget the tax man!  Personally in your situation I would consider sharing a 2br flat. Saves a lot on rent while still your own personal space, compared to larger share houses."
sydney,3dsx84,SilverStar9192,0,Sun Jul 19 07:47:03 2015 UTC,"rent would be like 30k while his salary being like 70k, seems reasonable unless im missing something. rent could only get as low as 20k."

You'd be left with ~$55,000 a year. Sure, it's doable, but as I said earlier only if you think its worth it.  OP has never lived out of home before, so probably doesn't have a good idea of financial future, what they are interested in saving/spending/investing, what other costs come from living out of home. Tying yourself down with a huge rent isn't always the best choice if you want to enjoy yourself, but if you're set on living by yourself sometimes that is worth more of your income. Definitely OPs choice, but it helps to have others point out their experiences. For me, I'd rather live inner Sydney with someone else than pay more, be further out and on my own."

sydney,3dsx84,Lflacko,2,Sun Jul 19 08:49:00 2015 UTC,A salary of $70k is only a take home pay of around $53k including Medicare deduction. If you spent $30k on rent that's over 56% spent on rent with very little left for daily expenses and any savings for the future.   With a take home pay of $53k I'd recommend limiting rent to 40% or about $400/week. That's still a lot for that salary though.
sydney,3dsx84,willhughes,3,Sun Jul 19 08:59:08 2015 UTC,"Being on your own, I think you'd want to keep your rent to ~$350 a week (if only so you have plenty of savings for holidays etc). Think about a share house - many, many people in Sydney do this even once they are working professional jobs full time. If you were paying up to the amount you're prepared to spend, you'd be spending almost half your income on rent which is a lot.  You might want to check out share houses in Newtown/Redfern, it'll be easy access for work, there are awesome bars and pubs, and you'll still be in easy travel distance of the city."
sydney,3dsx84,SilverStar9192,2,Sun Jul 19 04:06:41 2015 UTC,I'll definitely look into share houses but currently I'm pretty keen on being on my own for a while. Someone else had mentioned Wolli Creek which looks to be quite nice too and is along the rail line that I'm after.   Thanks for your help!
sydney,3dsx84,sixth_balls,3,Sun Jul 19 04:46:56 2015 UTC,"Newtown and surrounds has the better bars and nightlife, so it's really up to you with what matters more - Wolli Creek definitely has the more affordable options for living on your own."
sydney,3dsx84,FCnL2GFJ,3,Sun Jul 19 04:49:58 2015 UTC,"I've lived here for close to 2 years, there's plenty of new apartment complexes popping up, and retail spaces too. It's a quiet neighborhood close to everything."
sydney,3dsx84,hippi_ippi,3,Sun Jul 19 04:50:36 2015 UTC,how are you 20 and earning 80k?
sydney,3dsx84,planeray,4,Sun Jul 19 13:46:59 2015 UTC,"On $80k spending $550/week is going to be a hell of a stretch. You'll probably find that real estate agents won't take you as a tenant for an apartment at that price anyway, since most of them ask for some form of proof of income.   Remember that the cost of living for everything in Sydney is a lot higher than Adelade, so factor that into the price of things.   A general rule of thumb is that your accommodation should be no more than about 30% of your income.  As for the suburbs - the post you link to is for someone that's literally on the opposite side of Sydney, and further out. You'd have terrible commute times.   To get some idea of the commute time, Use Google Map's Transit Directions to pop in various suburbs, and the address of the company, remembering to set it for arrival at 9am Monday.   Others have suggested share houses - this is generally a good idea for someone new to the city that doesn't have existing friends/etc. At least for a little while.    Would prefer to live high up where possible (I love the cityscape/light)   Even at $500/week, getting a good view is a matter of extraordinary luck."
sydney,3dsx84,Jammb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:54:50 2015 UTC,"I certainly wasn't hoping to spend 550pw and I understand that's a bit much for what I need.   As others have suggested Wolli Creek and Newtown might be good areas for what I'm after. Any thoughts on this?  I was in Sydney not long ago and commute time from the CBD to Kogarah was roughly 20 minutes which is fine for me, anything closer and that time will only be shorter which is great."

I seem to recall TV monitors with sound at town hall station about 5 years ago. Then they seemed to go away. Now they are back.  It's bad enough that one should be subject to private advertising billboards, not erected at the place of business, in a public space. That's an abuse of the public space.  However, it's easy enough to zone out and ignore them. However, moving images on a screen and, this takes the cake, accompanying sound ... counts as a violation of your freedom of thought and speech. It becomes difficult to read a book or hear yourself think.  And it is Orwellian, whether the messages are from the government or private industry.

sydney,3dqm0q,TheOrangeBananaNinja,2,Sun Jul 19 00:00:55 2015 UTC,"Active noise cancelling headphones will reduce the outside noise by about 90% in my experience, its like wearing actual hearing protection earmuffs for all but the highest decibel, sharp abrupt sounds. If you're wearing them and playing music, it will block out pretty much all ambient noise and people speaking directly at you standing right next to you are really muffled sounding. Its like when you go to a loud live music venue and go into the bathroom, you can still hear the music but most of the loudness and disorientating noise is dialed right down.  They are expensive, but I love them."

sydney,3dqm0q,CaptnYossarian,28,Sat Jul 18 23:42:44 2015 UTC,"Well for example, you sure as hell won't be able to find many other cities in the world that would allow you to travel 540km for only $8.30 or $5.81 off-peak. That's from Scone in the Hunter, to Goulburn in the Southern Highlands.   Of course that's along slow, windy, near ancient railways; so a cheaper fare in comparison to other countries, where the equivalent would be in the hundreds of dollars, is kind of acceptable. But that is just completely unsustainable.  No one should expect fare recovery to be like London (90%) which has over a billion passengers a year, or Hong Kong (186%) who's private operator uses it's stations and excess land for property development. But getting it even close to 50% would allow for so much more investment into new infrastructure and rolling stock without an enormous hit to the public purse.  This blog post from early last year outlines a lot of the issues with the current fare system using Bureau of Transport Statistics, and Auditor General data.   The cost recovery from ticket fares for the Sydney rail network, in 2012-13, was 19.8%. This is rumoured to be even less now with Opal's cheaper fares and free trips etc..   You can see why the government is keen to pay the private sector to operate the new metro. The government gives the operator a monthly fee that can be penalised for delays etc., but the government keeps the infrastructure and fares. So when the operator runs an efficient railway they get more money. Then the extra passengers attracted to the efficient railway will pay the fares to the government, going someway to paying the operator.   IPART is now looking into whether the amount of cars that public transport takes off the roads is enough reason for the government to be spending so much on running the PT network, while charging such low fares to the passengers. I doubt it will be too in favour of lower fares (is IPART ever?), but it could spark a discussion into charging more for travelling longer distances."
sydney,3dqm0q,megamate,8,Sun Jul 19 00:41:35 2015 UTC,"Well for example, you sure as hell won't be able to find many other cities in the world that would allow you to travel 540km for only $8.30 or $5.81 off-peak. That's from Scone in the Hunter, to Goulburn in the Southern Highlands.   Almost no one (as a percentage of PT use) does that, and I think most people would be justified in thinking that anyone who does actually should be paying more.  So, actually, we just have an extremely unbalanced fare system.  Examples:   Take 8 short bus trips on Monday to pay $15 for the week, then travel thousands of kilometres for the rest of the week at no additional cost. Going 1km on the train? That'll be $3.38, so, $3.38 per kilometre. Going 60km on the train? That'll be $6.46, so, $0.11 (rounded up) per kilometre. You pay nearly 3000% more per kilometre for short trips.   Edit: Fixed my error that /u/walkerreuben pointed out below."
sydney,3dqm0q,CaptnYossarian,7,Sun Jul 19 03:47:47 2015 UTC,"No, but a lot of people like me travel fairly long distances from places like Gosford, the Blue Mountains or Wollongong to get to the city, which is definitely cheap compared to, say, the UK's Inter-City services. Sydney trains are fine fare-wise, it's just Sydney's long tradition of private bus operators which is holding up integrated fares from happening any time soon, even with Opal."
sydney,3dqm0q,walkerreuben,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:19:44 2015 UTC,"No, it isn't that. Private bus operators in and around Sydney haven't kept their fare revenue for years. They operate services under contract to TfNSW, get paid to run those services and - just like trains, ferries and light rail - hand any fare revenue collected back to TfNSW. With Opal, they don't even collect the revenue anymore.  There aren't any contractual or legal obstacles to integrated fares for any services using Opal. All it requires is a government that wants to do it, and is willing to either cop a loss from reforming fares in a way where no-one or few people are worse off (like MyZone or the current Opal fare structure) or bring in a new fare structure that raises the same amount of money overall and makes some people worse off (very long distance train and bus passengers being the most likely group of losers)."
sydney,3dqm0q,megamate,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:06:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think we're in agreement about long-distance being cheap. What I'm suggesting is that it is cheap at the expense of short-distance commuters."
sydney,3dqm0q,ShibaHook,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:26:58 2015 UTC,"That's true practically anywhere in the world. You can pay £2.50 ($5.30) for a trip from Covent Garden to Piccadilly Square in London, which are 300m apart; more (£4) if you buy a paper ticket like a tourist who doesn't know where they're going. Base far with incremental distance cost is pretty standard."
sydney,3dqm0q,SilverStar9192,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"Naturally additional kilometres should be successively lower cost. It's the magnitude of the figures that is important, in my opinion. 3000% more per km for a shorter journey seems excessive to me."
sydney,3dqm0q,needadviceokk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:59:17 2015 UTC,"Because you're seeing a single figure - if it was broken out, you'd see something like Train Access Fee: $3, Distance (0-10km block) fee: $0.38. (n.b. making up this proportion, I don't know what the cost breakout is, but that's how it works).  ""3000% more per km"" isn't the right comparison to be made because you're including a non-distance based component - the component that doesn't vary based on how far you're travelling or from where to where (but does vary in other cases, for peak/off-peak/concession fares.)"
sydney,3dqm0q,yllekleahcimnire,4,Mon Jul 20 03:07:27 2015 UTC,"Going 1km on the train? That'll be $4.20, so, $4.20 per kilometre.   1km is $3.38. It's only once it's over 10km that it's $4.20.  Yay for a 9.37km trip to work."

That was kind of the point of the articles.  Edit: and obviously some comes from the advertising revenue."
sydney,3dqm0q,RichieMclad,3,Sun Jul 19 00:25:00 2015 UTC,"It's actually about 11% of trips. This is quite different to only 11% of people using public transport because people who use PT don't only use PT - they also walk, drive, cycle, catch taxis and everything else. For example, at the average rate of 3.6 trips per day/person, even someone who commutes by PT five days a week is only making about 40% of their trips by PT, and there would be many people using PT less frequently than this (once a month, only on weekends, only for going to NYE and the Easter Show etc).  The proportion of people who never use public transport is probably pretty low in Sydney - and certainly less than 50% of the population - though likely much higher in regional areas. However, I'm not sure that accurate stats are publicly available on this."
sydney,3dqm0q,joonix,2,Sun Jul 19 04:33:07 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Is that 10% nationally or in NSW?  My comment was more an exception. As an average PT user and above average taxpayer, I'm probably funding 100% of my fares in some form or another."

Back then the most important thing internally for your assessment was your cohort ranking.  It should be the same, since it was quite a fair system to me.  But make sure you nail those trials so your ranking is high as possible, first would be the best.   Obviously go through as much past papers as possible.  See if you can obtain other trial past papers from other schools as well.  Keep doing past papers over and over again, even when you feel like you're so bored of it you know it all, because you will have mental blanks. So keep doing them over and over again.  Make sure you look through the syllabus for each subject and ensure you know everything that it says it can assess you on.  Read a question TWICE, always. The last thing you want to do is to screw up not reading it right and solving a question with the wrong assumption. It's like cooking, if you miss one step, you can really ruin the outcomes of what you're making.  Good luck!"

If trying to remember full essays is hard, at least try and remember the important quotes etc.  Use the trial exams to get a feel of your exam ethic, I know you've probably had enough experience in half-yearly and yearly exams, but use these trial exams to take note of how you can possibly manage your time better in certain areas.  don't overstress and always remember to take a break from studying! wishing you luck in your trials :)"

Half the problem is people heap it on like it's jam or nutella or something, when they've never had it before.  Then they get hit with this massive overwhelming super salty taste.   Yes, a slice of cheese on top is also great. Plus pretty much anything that goes well with a bit of salt - sliced tomato, smashed avocado, some kind of sliced cold meat.  Goes well in cooking too where you need some kind of stock to build up the body.   The kind of classic version though is just butter (or margarine) and vegemite on toast, bread, or crackers.   The crackers one has a special thing that you can make 'worms' - spread the butter and vegemite onto two crackers, then sandwich them together. Pressing down forces the butter/vegemite mix through the holes in the crackers.  Sao or Vita-Wheats are the typical ones with the right sized holes."

It burned a little but didn't hurt too bad at all -- just an annoying amount of pressure.  The doctor prescribed ear drops and advised that yanking the ear back hard should create enough of an opening for the liquid to seep in.  Nope.  So three times a day for the next few days we went in to visit the nurse/s who used this small speculum like thing to pry my ear canal open just enough to get the drops it.

And was basically crying about how embarrassed she is about the whole thing and how she was 100% to blame for getting in the guys car.   I have always tell my friends if they ever need me they can always call me and I'll come help them out. But the one time my friend actually needed me, I ignored her because I was busy trying to hook up with some girl. And now my friend feels absolutely terrified and there is nothing I can do about it.  FUCK."

Cut through the domain back to Martin Place. Go through the Domain, around Wooloomooloo Bay and up Wylde St. in Potts Point. Then you cut through a stairway and a couple streets in Elizabeth Bay and you're into Rushcutters Bay park.

sydney,3dpbkl,coolibahtree,31,Sat Jul 18 03:49:21 2015 UTC,"I've done a postgraduate degree in journalism. A few points for your consideration   There are very few jobs available in journalism for grads going at the moment, and they are usually very poorly paid.  If you want a decent 9-5 job then journalism might not be the answer.  Like psychology, it's a uni degree that far too many people have and I suspect that the vast majority of grads don't work as journalists (I don't).  To get a good job you need to be exceptional and have a lot of experience from unpaid internships. Journalism is one of those industries where the simple principle of being paid for work you do doesn't always count.  A lot of internships will feed you a lot of bullshit about ""exposure,"" ""networking"" and ""experience"" but not pay a cent for what you do.  How are you going to intern for free and study all while you are trying to make ends meet to pay bills etc?  If you are a good writer and you want to give journalism a go, just go ahead and write something great and have it published.  You don't need an expensive degree.  In any case it gives you a chance to road-test being a working journo and you can do the degree later if it really is your thing.   Being a good writer isn't enough.  Learn about TV, radio, video-editing and all that kind of stuff.  Broad skills are your best chance of getting employed.   Hope this helps."
sydney,3dpbkl,HomeboyFrost,3,Sat Jul 18 04:16:09 2015 UTC,I like your third point. Blogging might be a good route to take to 'test drive'. There are plenty of bloggers out there who earn a living from their work.

I now work in advertising and make decent money. I think the degree would be a waste of time and money, if you can write well you don't need it. Just start a blog and build upon it. Your bound to get noticed and as you grow you can monetize it with advertising etc."

Good quality journalism isn't in high demand any more, and most sites (e.g. Buzzfeed) post random crap that is designed to lure you in and make you press on their links (e.g. 100 WAYS TO LOSE FAT).

sydney,3dpbkl,teambob,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:23:57 2015 UTC,"I would pay the price of a newspaper every day to read news and analysis that are independent and that tell you something useful.  So even as everybody in this post tells you that journalism is a dying industry, there is hope in Australian journalism because the media is so bad and the independent media contains few high quality articles (there are of course some good articles, I have read some, but you don't see them everyday) (for example: https://newmatilda.com/ seems independent but most articles are very long and very boring).  So I think there is hope for new journalism in Australia as other persons may share my opinion.  And there is another thing: if you create a good quality independent media then someone with a lot of money could buy it so it stops being independent and then you would have made a lot of money."

Those people that don't vote are disillusioned with political system and say that it's useless to vote, I tried to convince them to vote but they don't listen, so sad). More on demographics: it's said that the people that read Reddit are professionals and upper-class (although I'm an exception, I'm not upper-class), so their reading matters more than from people that don't make any effort in life.

GGs TH and GW for 40K, both GGs and Games Den for MTG. (Disclaimer: I haven't been to any of these stores in over a year, and cannot vouch for their current quality.

Lynn (High quality Shanghainese at reasonable prices.) Lord of the Fries (Weird vego fast food chain from Melbourne, tasty as hell though. No seating.) 3Q Chicken (Taiwanese fried chicken chain, bloody delicious if you ask me. No seating.) Nazimi (Small downstairs Japanese restaurant, good value for the quality, can get full of businesspeople.) Gumshara (Ramen place in a Chinatown food court, infamously thick tonkotsu broth, love it or hate it (I love it) but it sits near the top of every Sydney ramen ranking. Make sure you bring an appetite.) Chinese Noodle Restaurant (Fantastic Chinese, brusque service and cramped but fuck it, there's a reason it's so busy.) Braza (All-you-can-eat Brazilian BBQ, expensive but if you just want to pig out on meat it's hard to beat.) El Loco (Mexican cantina in the back of a pub, high quality and cheap though.) Buffalo Dining Club (Cheeeeeese, also nice antipasti and mains. Small and limited bookings, get in early.) Chicken Institute (Korean-American fusion, fried chicken is as Damn Good as it says on the menu.) GPO Cheese & Wine Room (Equally legit for a gourmet dinner or $15 for the best mac and cheese you've ever eaten at lunchtime.) Tapavino (Tapas bar that also has an insane sherry list.)   I...think those are most of my preferred haunts that are reasonably close to you. I can do further afield too, but I think I'd be here all day.  For spending money, depends on exactly how much your food and drink budget is. Excluding that, get yourselves each an Opal card with $40 on it from a newsagent and that will cover your transport for the duration (unless you're going to be using a LOT of public transport AND you're arriving on Friday or Saturday so you hit the rollover point midway through your stay, in which case MyMultis would be better).

sydney,3dlnl7,freepenguin,13,Fri Jul 17 07:23:13 2015 UTC,Opal's fare system is a bit of a mess:   Newcastle railbus is actually a train Stockton ferry is actually a bus Gladys originally said the city light rail completion will make light rail a bus Gameable Wonderful travel reward system (to Redditors' advantage) Funny ferry transfer rules (can't transfer anywhere except CQ) A->B->A train journey results in a 0km fare
sydney,3dlnl7,fr00t-l00p,11,Fri Jul 17 08:16:37 2015 UTC,"Also, light rail stops are coded internally on the card as ferry.  Yet they use bus fares and the train logo shows up online.  :)"
sydney,3dlnl7,SilverStar9192,3,Fri Jul 17 09:22:14 2015 UTC,"So /u/fr00t-l00p and SilverStar9192, what's the solution here?  Would the following rules work?    Fares are now always calculated on a crow flies basis, regardless of mode. Switching between modes with the transfer time now counts as one journey."

sydney,3dlnl7,firestorm91,2,Fri Jul 17 22:18:15 2015 UTC,"Your impression is correct. But Trains don't use the crows flies method.   For trains, the Opal fare matches the distance of track traveled between two Opal activated stations. For ferries and buses it is the straight line distance between the tap on and tap off.   https://www.opal.com.au/en/fares-and-benefits/calculating_opal_fares/  I suppose there is no reason to change from track distance to crows flies (and I'm not clear why there track distance is chosen). The main thing to think about is whether having a new rule like ...    Switching between modes with the transfer time now counts as one journey.    is problematic."
sydney,3dlnl7,johnbentley,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:37:37 2015 UTC,"It actually appears to be 'as the crow flies' for each bus trip, then adding them all together to get the total distance. That is A to B, plus B to C, instead of just A to C (which would be similar to the train distance calculation).  This is why backtracking on buses can't result in a refund, whereas it can on trains."

The fact that they are doing a review means that they are at least considering it.  That said, a fare hike is a real possibility. If integrating fares results in some people paying less when they transfer - which is highly likely - then the government will need to either make up the cash from changes to other fares, or cop the loss (which they can't really afford to do). It is quite conceivable that integrating fares to benefit people who interchange will require higher fares than people currently pay when using just one mode. We just don't know how big a difference it would actually be until IPART does the work."

sydney,3dmqte,bananaconcoction,2,Fri Jul 17 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"Basically they're just fillings put over your teeth to make them appear as though they're straight. Had them done myself years ago and they still look good. Takes about an hour in the chair depending how many you need done, which is obviously less than braces etc. Downside is that they discolour easier and you have to get them replaced every now and then as your mouth changes shape."
sydney,3dmqte,Mellenoire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:47:00 2015 UTC,"They're great if you aren't a severe case. They can move teeth quite effectively up to 1mm. They can still move teeth further than that but the effectiveness drops off. The only thing they're not that good with is rotating crooked teeth, but newer systems have improvements on this.   You'll need to wear the tray at all times except when eating and brushing your teeth, and you'll need to wear a retainer for the rest of your life (most people skip this step and end up going back to their original configuration within a year).   My experiences with prices are a little different to Megahurtz though, I've seen patients quoted from 7k right up to 12k at high end specialists offices. Most of that fee goes towards getting all the trays made in the U.S."

sydney,3dmqte,Quolli,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:21:32 2015 UTC,You only have to wear a retainer for as long as you want the teeth to stay straight and gaps closed ;) sometimes a fixed retainer may be an option but best to speak with your clinician

sydney,3dmqte,Quolli,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:23:50 2015 UTC,I'm considering a fixed retainer after my invisalign treatment - would love to know more about your experience. What makes them suck?
sydney,3dmqte,kzezoor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:29:26 2015 UTC,"Keeping that area clean is a major, major hassle. The fixed retainer is a bar of metal that doesn't sit flush against the teeth so there's a minor gap. Small food particles get stuck there which is uncomfortable and can compromise oral health if they don't get removed.  When I get my teeth cleaned at the dentist the dentist always comments on how difficult it is to clean the area properly too. And I never feel like he can do the job properly either because they get in the way of the cleaning equipment.  At least it's a squiggle of metal so flossing isn't compromised."
sydney,3dmqte,princesspeachey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:04:12 2015 UTC,"I have a fixed wire with no issues at all. Have a little pokey bottle brush thing, but its also easy to thread floss through. Takes maybe an extra minute.   No complaints from the dentist, or hygienist.   My wire is straight across though, not wiggly. So there is less for the food to get stuck on, maybe that's why I have less issues."
sydney,3dmqte,carlymason,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:12:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't got a wire myself - but a few of my friends have had them and had them come unglued from their teeth which requires a trip back to the ortho to get reglued. Little bit of extra time required for flossing or a special tool to help with it, too."

sydney,3dmq68,Andrenid,2,Sat Jul 18 05:54:38 2015 UTC,Opera bar? Or something down on the water. I quite like going out to dinner alone to places with a nice view and just soaking it in.
sydney,3dmq68,meowffins,5,Sat Jul 18 10:00:04 2015 UTC,It's cold right now but after july it will start warming up. It's not crazy so much as it is the seasons. Winter = cold and summer = hot.  A little bit more than usual this year but nothing ridiculous like the CBD being buried under snow.  Maybe pack/buy really good walking shoes because they're expensive here (pretty much everything is but you'd already know that).
sydney,3dmq68,maekattt,3,Fri Jul 17 16:08:16 2015 UTC,"It's cold, but probably not as cold from where you are from. A thick jumper, jeans and maybe a scarf will easily keep you warm. By December it will be hot, so if you want, being summery stuff. The lecture theatres/rooms will have a wide variety of temperatures, so I usually dress in layers so i can add/remove easily.  Macquarie also means walking a fair distance outside no matter where you are coming from or going to. I'd definitely bring a good pair of shoes you can wear in all weather without worry. Things like umbrellas and that you can get here cheaply. Macquarie Centre (a big shopping centre) is right across the road, so if you do forget anything, its easy enough to buy what you need.  Hope you like it here in Sydney and at Macquarie!"

sydney,3dmq68,meowffins,2,Sat Jul 18 06:13:16 2015 UTC,"Calling real estate photographers, agents and anyone else with comments to share.     Anyone have experience with shooting real estate? I'm interested in hearing about your experience and rough prices/quotes for doing this kind of work.  Like, what are standard rates for an average house with 10-12 shots delivered? I suspect that $150 is an average or minimum price. Does this change with number of shots needed and value of the property?  How many shots are usually expected? I see many properties having 5-10 shots, usually on the lower end. Does this mean they are 'cheaping out' for less shots or do they not want too many shots (showing too much perhaps)?  I'm somewhat interested in doing this kind of work but have avoided it because it's not very high paying (from my understanding) but money's money at the end of the day.     Please comment if you have experience or can comment on this from a different perspective (as an agent, home owner, friend of a photographer or anything). Or PM me if you'd like to talk privately.   I'm all set in terms of actually carrying out the job, I just don't have experience with pricing this kind of work or the sydney market.   Thanks."
sydney,3dmq68,carlymason,3,Sat Jul 18 07:38:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting query. I'm curious about this too. I don't have any personal experiences but I must say there is great variation in property photography. I have a feeling some agencies DIY because the shots are terrible, the lighting is inadequate 'oh ok there is a washing machine in this room, and oh there is a toilet' honestly intuition should have it that the photo does not contribute at all!"
sydney,3dmq68,meowffins,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:40:47 2015 UTC,Are you a photographer yourself?  I think almost all residential places could do with better photos; DIY is to save money. It's true crappy place may not give much benefit but that's a matter of investment (paying for better photos) and return (how much more effective the 'pro' photos can be).
sydney,3dmq68,FrenchieSmalls,3,Fri Jul 17 21:31:42 2015 UTC,"Don't know about pricing, but one piece of pragmatic advice that I recently came across: shooting at dusk will allow for balanced light levels between the interior and exterior. That way, you can have properly exposed interior shots while also maintaining proper exposure in the windows, without having to resort to HDR or blended exposures."

With that budget, you can afford to, and the convenience of being that close to work/the city is amazing.  There are also some great places in suburbs within a short distance like Ultimo, Chippendale or Glebe (can be especially convenient if you are close to Broadway Shopping Centre).  Beware that parking in a lot of these areas can be difficult, so if you can, it would be worth finding a place that includes a parking space (though many will not).

The Service will honour those who lost their lives and thank those who were involved in the recovery and investigation process.  As a mark of respect and mourning to those who lost their lives, the Australian National Flag should be flown at half-mast all day on Friday 17 July 2015 from all buildings and establishments occupied by Australian Government departments and affiliated agencies.  Other organisations are welcome to participate.  In accordance with flag protocol, all flags and ensigns at each flag station should be flown at half-mast during daylight hours.  However, should it be the custom to fly the flags of other nations at your flag station, it would be appropriate to seek permission from the diplomatic representatives of that nation to half-mast their flag.

The choice of text as a defacement is... common, but I think it's fair to call it tacky.  Edit: For those interested. I think the Wikipedia source is not quite accurate with the original Federation customs flag, either. It's more likely that ""HMC AUSTRALIA"" appeared on a plain British Blue Ensign (no stars), and the ""AUSTRALIA"" was removed when the Australian Blue Ensign with stars was used instead in 1904.  If that's the case, it's only the present government who tried to put ""AUSTRALIAN"" on a distinctively Australian flag (the original regulations say this flag says ""AUSTRALIAN BORDER FORCE""), but at least it seems someone has realised it's silly.   Oh, and this Border Force flag is now the present customs flag, which is the main reason the design was used (probably without anything else even being considered)."

sydney,3dhjdp,hohohob,35,Thu Jul 16 09:16:50 2015 UTC,"What about bus/train combo fares?  This flyer keeps talking about how you may find it convenient to transfer to a train at X. Sorry, but adding a train transfer usually adds $3.38/journey or $27.04 per week assuming no extra Opal fare minimisation tactics. That's around $1300 a year. Not so convenient when you look at it that way is it?     Even if you do save $1 or $1.40 with a slightly lower bus fare, that doesn't anywhere near offset the Opal transfer penalty.   The transfer penalty for Opal remains one of its absolute worst legacies and TfNSW and the Libs cannot continue to delude themselves that this is a good idea. Come on Baird, Andrew Constance, and Gladys if you still care - admit failure and switch to a sensible fare system."
sydney,3dhjdp,SilverStar9192,7,Thu Jul 16 10:35:57 2015 UTC,Here's to hoping an integrated fare structure will be implemented on October 4.
sydney,3dhjdp,nandos1,7,Thu Jul 16 10:42:25 2015 UTC,"Highly unlikely, and UTS still doesn't have Opal so there's a big crowd suffering in extra fares too."
sydney,3dhjdp,superjjskate,2,Thu Jul 16 10:44:49 2015 UTC,Genuinely surprised no students have raised a fuss about it. Students are brilliant at making a fuss about shitty authority decisions.  Why isn't anyone protesting?
sydney,3dhjdp,Silverymine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:56:16 2015 UTC,"Personally from my understanding, it's now the uni itself holding back the Opal concessions. From my uni we had a TOS that listed out the privacy shit and it was our choice to let the gov access it by clicking ""I agree""."
sydney,3dhjdp,superjjskate,5,Fri Jul 17 17:25:07 2015 UTC,"I doubt the fare structure will change in the short term. Therefore in the meantime, the strategy would be to catch any bus along a trunk route (bus transfer). See p31 for an example. It advises change of buses at Druitt St. or route M52.  Personally, I think the fare structure will change when the CSELR and NWRL are completed."
sydney,3dhjdp,aussieham,2,Thu Jul 16 10:46:05 2015 UTC,"I haven't got my head around the transfer penalty? Is it that you are considered to have taken one journey when you change trains/buses, even though you are paying for 2 different trips?"
sydney,3dhjdp,the_snook,2,Thu Jul 16 13:26:31 2015 UTC,"Also that if you transfer bus-bus you only pay the end-to-end cost of the trip (as if you'd taken one bus the whole way). If you transfer bus-train you pay at least the minimum fare on each, so a minimum far of something like $5.50 even for a short trip."
sydney,3dhjdp,grimlock81,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:32:12 2015 UTC,Yes but only if you transfer within 60 minutes and it involves a change of transport mode.
sydney,3dhjdp,lbft,2,Thu Jul 16 13:51:17 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but each transfer means your commute takes longer - you get off wherever your bus now terminates, and then have to either walk a lot further or wait for the next bus going to where you used to be able to keep going.   And how much do you want to bet all the services left passing through the CBD are going to be totally packed, and you're going to struggle to actually get on."
sydney,3dhjdp,AncientSamus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:08:05 2015 UTC,"I've been to a few cities where the ticket system worked, you buy one ticket for $3 and you can make as many trips and transfers between buses, trains, etc as you want in 2 hours in a certain zone. Extra zones cost more but it allows for transfers easily.  I'd like something like that in Sydney"
sydney,3dhjdp,SilverStar9192,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:38:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every other city in Australia works this way. Some other cities have a system where you do pay an additional fare when going from say, train to bus, but there is a system set up where you get a discount of transferring."
sydney,3dhjdp,pehpehsha,15,Thu Jul 16 22:06:34 2015 UTC,"An issue that i haven't seen brought up yet. They're changing the start of the nightrider buses to Park Street, moving it away from Town Hall. That is a stupid idea. The police station is right next to the nightrider start point making it safer and they're able to be on scene in seconds if any trouble starts. Hope they think about what they are going to have in place for the new start point."
sydney,3dhjdp,SilverStar9192,3,Thu Jul 16 12:11:30 2015 UTC,"It will put it closer to Maccas and HJ's though, that's good to be a boon for the late night riders. Also there is security at the supervised cab rank there."
sydney,3dhjdp,Hidden_Bomb,3,Thu Jul 16 13:08:49 2015 UTC,"I rate the police station as safer still. Admittedly Maccas is a little far away if you want a 3am feed or drunk piss, but it's still better there in my opinion. Is there any rationale behind the change other than what you've said? It all seems a little superficial to me. Why change something that isn't broken, especially when you've got drunks who are just trying to get home. No one wants or needs extra confused drunks."
sydney,3dhjdp,SilverStar9192,4,Thu Jul 16 13:37:13 2015 UTC,"Um, the reason for the change is they are building a light rail line on George St.  No buses will be able to use George St ever again.  That's what's driving this entire shakeup."

When October comes, it will be; Harbour Bridge -> Western Distributor -> Bathurst St -> Kent St. That's inbound to the CBD. Outbound no longer goes along Clarence Street and will be along Kent Street, with all stops only being on Kent St.  This applies to all Dural Depot Hillsbus services."

sydney,3dhjdp,thefush,2,Thu Jul 16 11:31:16 2015 UTC,So the 328 bus is only running between darling point to edgecliff? Or did i read that wrong.
sydney,3dhjdp,SilverStar9192,2,Thu Jul 16 13:06:46 2015 UTC,I think 328 is a new route from Bondi Junction to Edgecliff. It replaces the 200 during off peak.
sydney,3dhjdp,mandonov,2,Thu Jul 16 13:13:53 2015 UTC,"But only runs to Edgecliffe during the peak, while the 200 runs to Bondi Jct."
sydney,3dhjdp,SilverStar9192,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:48:52 2015 UTC,"Well, it makes better use of the Edgecliff bus/train interchange this way.  People from Darling Point can either catch a train to the city or Bondi Junction at Edgecliff, so there really should be no urgent need to have 328 continue to Bondi Junction, and 200 will be covering Ocean St during that period.  The main need is to make sure the various side areas of Bellevue Hill and Edgecliff (Ocean St) are still served in some way.    The confusing thing is why they don't have 327 continue as it does now to Darling Point during the peak (but looping back to terminate at Edgecliff instead of the city), instead of separating it out into a new 328."
sydney,3dhjdp,arfamcarfa,2,Thu Jul 16 23:58:53 2015 UTC,That's completely different to the other one posted earlier.

sydney,3dhqv7,Lear6,20,Thu Jul 16 11:07:13 2015 UTC,"I respond as a lifetime Shire resident. To me it is very much that The Shire is a catchcry for the large number of myopic people who live here. There is significantly less diversity in The Shire than other parts of Sydney, so many people struggle to deal with things that are ""different"" or new.   In many ways it is a country town struggling for its identity within the bounds of a city.  As a resident who regularly crosses the bridges for work and social purposes I can be a massive critic of The Shire Mentality, but in fairness the people are nice, but (warning-massive over generalisation coming) lack the sophistication and tolerance of urban dwellers. When you visit, treat it as you would a small country town, reach out and say hello and people will open up."
sydney,3dhqv7,PavlovianIgnorance,2,Thu Jul 16 12:36:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks. This explains a lot. What I don't understand is why the country town mentality has developed so close to other places where it hasn't? Also, is it true about the higher suicide rate?"
sydney,3dhqv7,PavlovianIgnorance,2,Fri Jul 17 01:28:11 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on the suicide rate, except to say that (fortunately) it has not affected me.  I personally believe the country town feeling comes from having physical barriers that define the area (National Park, and the Georges River), combined with the mono-cultural background that has historically been a part of the shire.  This is similar to a country town with distance as its barrier, and cultural norms attached to the town."
sydney,3dhqv7,tabula_rasta,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:15:26 2015 UTC,"The Shire is naturally isolated. It is bordered on all sides by rivers wilderness, and ocean. Is is not really possible to just wander into it from an adjoining area without crossing a road bridge or walking through many kilometres of bush. Maybe this has something to do with the small town vibe?  I was born and raised in the heart of it, though I havent lived there for some time. As others have noted, the people are generally nice enough, and the provincial attitudes are waning quickly in the 21st century."
sydney,3dhqv7,justaguywithnoname,21,Fri Jul 17 14:16:35 2015 UTC,"I grew up in the shire but haven't lived there for almost 10 years now.  If I am ever back there I often find myself thinking ""something's not quite right"".  Then I have a look around and realise there is zero diversity there.  The vast majority are well to do, Anglo-saxen people.  Every other part of sydney I have been to has a range of cultures represented but the shire can be very limited.  I don't think the people there are intentionally racist or anything, but they have very limited exposure to other cultures so naturally can be a little narrow minded.  Its funny to look back at school photos and see how much my good friend who was probably the only Lebanese person in the grade stands out.  Things have probably improved a bit since then but its still a bit like that."

It was just another part of Sydney as far as I was concerned. Then something happened that made me realize I was somewhere very different. I was early to visit a friend in Kareela and had to kill time for an hour, so I sat in a park and read a book. Somebody called the cops on me and reported me as homeless. I mean for fuck's sake. I have long hair, I guess?  This van from the local youth centre rocked up and I had to explain to them that I was just a normal person reading a book in a park. This was after I had been there for about half an hour. I just cannot imagine this happening anywhere else in Sydney. I watched the youth workers walk across the street and calm down an old lady quivering behind her rose bushes who had apparently been watching me all this time.   Hahaha!! That's fucking hilarious!!

sydney,3dhqv7,Tekes88,15,Thu Jul 16 23:51:40 2015 UTC,I grew up in a small rural town in the southern highlands. I live in the inner west now but I study at Loftus Tafe. My theory on the shire is that it is this little Occa bubble. It's an area full of mostly Anglo Australians from a working class background who's favorite pass time is going to the beach or the pub. The reason you feel odd there is because you don't identify as a true blue Occa Aussie who sculls scooners and surfs. The northern beaches are the same but from higher socio economic backgrounds so instead of being an Occa bubble it's a Yuppy bubble where you drink cappuccinos instead of scooners.  Wollongong is much the same as the shire except they have a uni there so there's a couple more hipsters thrown in the mix. Get over it or stay in your inner west bubble where you feel safe.

As a lifelong shire resident, I've been a member of the inner circle of the secret organisation that controls shire residents. We use a combination of witchcraft and bionic implants to control the population and ensure that they continue to behave according to the ideals that we want for our community.  The lady you saw starting off into space is an unfortunate incident that happens occasionally. Sometimes the implants don't take and people are left slightly brain damaged. We care for these people as well as possible, but it's a small price to pay for the community as a whole.  Obviously, we program the citizens to report any outsiders that set foot in the shire and appear to be surveiling our operations. That park was probably opposite one of our re-education facilities, so the response time would be fairly quick in that case."

In the 80's I went to primary school at Miranda and had Greek, Italian, Lebanese, Pacific Islander, Chinese and Vietnamese kids at my school - sure it was majority white, but it certainly was not pure white kids. My first contact with ""boat people"" was a Vietnamese kid who had come by boat from Vietnam and scared us with stories of the Thai pirates who had boarded his boat on his way to Australia. He was a well liked kid at our school when he came sometime in the mid-80s. At High School in Sylvania it was a similar mix then a big influx of Hong Kong Chinese kids as the families got out of HK as it changed hands back to China. I remember as a kid seeing big groups of Muslim men smoking hookahs at the picnic tables at Gunnamatta Bay every weekend. I don't go to Cronulla beach often, but when I do, I see Muslim women in hijabs on the beach with their families. I mean, I like a ""white bread"" joke about the Shire as much as the next guy, but in reality I don't think it is any less diverse than many other parts of Sydney."

I do think the shire is an absolute shithole, a cultural wasteland. I really loathe having to go there because I feel like a bogan just being there.

Then for the police to contact youth workers who turned up in that 30 min window to settle the old scared lady and speak with this guy and move him on or see what his situation is?

""We've had reports, um, generally, around here, of a homeless person-- Not saying it's you, just, y'know, checking that everything's alright and that you're okay.."" After I had convinced them I was in fact, a normal person, I watched them go across the street and calm down an old lady who was invisibly cowering behind her bushes watching this play out. She had obviously seen me and felt threatened, then called someone to let them know. I suppose I don't know whether she technically called the police first, who then sent the youth centre people to check it out, or whether she had the youth centre on speed dial. The end result is the same really, a ridiculous situation."

Yet you think someone sitting in their front yard is creepy too.. Are we not allowed to enjoy just siting in our own front yard?  As someone else said i think you're over thinking. I've lived in the shire my whole life. Yeah it's pretty white (hello Australians are white?) I work at Revesby and coach gymnastics, we've got a decent mix of kids, but a lot of us will have groups of predominantly white kids..  Everybody is friendly, you know your neighbours and say good morning to people on the street.. Funnily enough when I walk towards Taronga zoo at 6am everyone in Mosman will always say hello or good morning too.  I think 'the deal with the shire' is that it's just a bunch of suburbs that just go about their business the same as everywhere else while other people look in, see what they want to see and have a laugh, oh well it what it is. I love the shire, i also love working at Revesby, and visiting my sister in north sydney too.. We're not really close minded people  Edit: oh dear kind of put my foot in it didn't i? Poor word choices to say Australia is mostly white when we have our aboriginal heritage, my bad, no intentions of offending anyone, I'm terrible at getting my points out in words   I just don't understand why everyone gets so uppity about having a community that seems to be predominantly white when we have areas that are hubs for other ethnicities. The shire is not unfriendly towards other races and no one is out to make anyone else feel uncomfortable, the same way I feel no unease or discomfort working at Revesby or Greenacre.  I'm not saying the shire doesn't have it's flaws, but I feel the shire mentality only exists out of the shire"

Apparently if you're a white guy or girl you are meant to feel great shame these days as its no longer acceptable.   The vast majority of Australians are white, with their heritage mostly European.  I find it troubling that you are questioning something that is fact only so you can be PC and not upset people."
sydney,3dhqv7,SirQuackington,2,Thu Jul 16 22:41:05 2015 UTC,Well considering that Chinese nationals have had interests in Australia almost as long as British Colonials I'm not sure if Political Correctness has anything to do with it at all. The fact that you yourself acknowledge the first peoples of your country makes me struggle to come to terms with any claim of Australian - White synonymity.
sydney,3dhqv7,SirQuackington,6,Thu Jul 16 23:40:41 2015 UTC,"Having an interest doesn't mean much, they didn't settle and didn't have the population that the Europeans had in Australia.  While I can only find ABS 2011 stats the breakdown of the top 5 ancestries the top two and heavy percentage pullers are nominated ancestries that are considered to be Caucasian or white.  English (36.1%) Australian (35.4%) Irish (10.4%) Scottish (8.9%) Italian (4.6%)  Given that Aboriginals only make up <3% of the population its not a stretch to say Australia now (and for a reasonable period of time) has been predominantly white."
sydney,3dhqv7,a_slinky,5,Thu Jul 16 23:55:53 2015 UTC,Sure. Nobody would disagree that the population of Australia is overwhelmingly white. But to say that Australians are white by definition is to say that if you aren't white then you aren't Australian. Which is obviously false.

We were arranging it and he said, I can come but my dad wants to talk to you on the phone first. I thought this was kinda odd but said okay. His dad grilled me for ten, fifteen minutes. Who are you? Where do you live? What are you doing? Why? What's your address? What's the address of the place you're going? What's your parents' names? What's your parents' numbers? It got to a certain point where it was making me uncomfortable, and I said something like, look, we are a bunch of teenagers who are in a band, we're just having a jam session in my mates garage. The line went quiet for a minute, then my friend came back on the phone: Dad says I can't come. I thought this was weird at the time.

They think they're king shit but mostly did basic jobs and bought their houses for fifty bucks. Which is why they're so nauseating.  I get a similar feeling around the northern beaches but I'm used to it now and everyone seems to have the boomers sussed and they get ignored and get no respect.

Nowadays, there is self-reinforcement going on, i.e. people who don't want to live in modern, multicultural Australia will move there or stay there, and people who are non-white-anglo-Australians will be reluctant, up to and including afraid to live there.

It also does slightly alter my comments as the original post from OP made it out it was only white people who were the problem not being accepting, as you have and others who seem to have a problem with white people have also added to this same view."

So not what I said.   you might want to review what happened as there were things fueling the situation until it tipped on both sides   Seriously, your characterisation of a brutal, organised racist riot involving serious injuries to random passers-by because of their skin colour is ""there was fault on both sides""? You think there was sufficient provocation for that? Do go on."

For the most part people are accepting and get along, however multiculturalism doesn't always work so well, these things are going to happen. It will happen again.    Quite simply people (Aussies) were fed up of the attitudes and behavior of the Lebanese and Middle Eastern groups, this wasn't confined to the beach. Lets face it the gang rapes which were racial kicked a lot of it off, things got worse, I lived out in those areas with friends a couple years before Cronulla happened and its the only times any of us had been threatened in the streets, a friend robbed at knife point (4 of them on 1 of us, because he shouldn't have been there) in daylight hours on a main road, cars and where we were living broken in to and stuff stolen.  Funny that I've never had any of this shit done to me by another white Aussie.  But please continue to apologize for these people who's parents had come to this country to escape some of the shit they had to deal with, had ungrateful children who seem to think they are all little gangsta's and thugs and go around causing shit and blame the other (white) locals that they are the problem in their own country.   Now you're in a thread where you get the chance to blame white Aussies for something else and joined in.  If that's what it means to be part of ""modern multicultural Australia"" I can see why they want to be somewhere there aren't people like you."

sydney,3dhbfn,superjjskate,2,Thu Jul 16 10:37:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean - transferring between busses is fine with Opal (no penalty).  My comment was about transferring between modes, primarily bus to train. USYD should have Opal now afaik; it's only UTS that's backwards and can't get their act together for Opal.   Concession card holders can still use MyMulti in the interim."
sydney,3dhbfn,SilverStar9192,3,Thu Jul 16 10:44:25 2015 UTC,"I was just adding another disadvantage point, UTS students from the Hills would terminate at Town Hall, judging from the overview it looks like a trek to continue their journey down to Chippendale so they would either catch a train or another bus which isn't necessarily cheaper.   I've never used a MyMulti but will that help alot with cost benefits?"

From what I've planned out, only issue is that I have less buses I can take from the CBD to USYD and vice-versa now (if I don't wanna walk 4-6 blocks).   Right now, I usually take 610 or 610X all the way to Railway Square where I can just cross the road and take basically M30 or any 42(X) bus that goes towards City Road. When the changes take place, I have to get off at QVB and from there, I could just cross the road and only take M30 to uni now. Same for going from USYD back to the CBD.   If I wanna take any 42(X) bus, I would have to walk all the way from QVB to Elizabeth street which is kinda a long walk."

sydney,3dhbfn,Bring-Back-The-Biff,10,Fri Jul 17 04:35:20 2015 UTC,"Summarised:   There are no changes to Eastern Suburbs services which run via Oxford Street into the city. However, Eastern services running through Surry Hills and into the city via Elizabeth Street will now terminate at Railway Square. William Street buses will terminate at either Millers Point, Walsh Bay, or Railway Square.  Parramatta Road buses will be diverted up Elizabeth Street and terminate at either The Domain or Martin Place.  Victoria Road buses will pass through the city east-west on Park Street and terminate at the Domain.  Epping and Lane Cove buses will terminate at King Street Wharf instead of at the QVB or Central.  Metrobus services will be diverted up Elizabeth Street or around Hyde Park between Central and Town Hall.  The 440 will run to some point down Oxford Street (possibly Bondi Junction?) instead of up to Circular Quay.  Hills District buses from Dural and Cherrybrook will come into the city via the Western Distributor, exit at Harbour Street, left onto Bathurst Street, and run up Kent Street to let passengers off.  The 389 will run east-west (east thru Market Street, west thru Park Street) through to Pyrmont instead of terminating at Circular Quay.  Northern Suburbs buses will terminate at QVB.  It's not very clear what's happening with Crown Street buses and the 343, but it looks like some services will terminate at Circular Quay, while some will terminate at some point over the bridge.  Similarly, some northern beaches services will terminate at Wynyard, while others will loop back out of the city via Bridge and Grosvenor Streets from the Cahill Expressway."

Also they will need to use George St as a lesson so we can have an improvement the current ""Conga line"" of buses going up George St in the morning. I've sat on buses which are half an hour from Central to Wynyard.  Having buses stop every stop will be a bad idea, they will need a ""stand"" arrangement like they have around York/Carrington St.  There are areas that will get VERY BAD. Think about when a bus turns from Bathurst into Elizabeth.  Currently there are all sorts of issues with large metro buses turning from Park to Castlereagh to Bathurst to Elizabeth."

Some people may find a larger woman pretty, some people find a smaller woman pretty, some people find men who look like they've done steroids ""pretty"" and some people find men who are lanky and scrawny ""pretty.""   Putting this all into the Hooters argument, the argument goes that since Hooters is providing ""entertainment"", they can thus discriminate on the grounds of beauty. Except that their job is no different to any other waiter or waitress at all, so the argument really holds no sway. If you're after waitresses who ""supposedly"" provide entertainment, then look for a Playboy Bunny (yes, this is a thing)"

sydney,3dif4e,SilverStar9192,4,Thu Jul 16 21:29:25 2015 UTC,Found a lost opal card. Has no name or number and the bus driver didn't seem very interested in it. What do?
sydney,3dif4e,Ryuten,6,Thu Jul 16 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"See if you can check its balance online. If it's unregistered and you can see the balance - happy days, it's yours now. It's just like losing cash, there's no way the owner can be found.   If the card was registered then you won't be able to login online. In that case just throw it away. The registered owner will be able to request a new card online and have the balance transferred. Opal doesn't really want the old one back (although you can send it in if you want to waste a stamp)."
sydney,3dif4e,SilverStar9192,7,Thu Jul 16 22:11:01 2015 UTC,"Just had a look, it's not registered and has about 25 bucks on it. I feel kind of weird because I can see the persons whole travel history... So I now have some idea of where they live and where they get on the bus.  Today was their free travel day too : ("
sydney,3dif4e,Ryuten,5,Fri Jul 17 00:23:23 2015 UTC,"Is it the exact same time every day?  Could just go to that bus stop at that time, and say, ""anyone lost their Opal card?""  ... if you felt really generous.    I would just spend the credit.  Or register it to your account and transfer the credit to your normal card.   It's the first guy's fault for not registering his card or keeping track of it."
sydney,3dif4e,SilverStar9192,5,Fri Jul 17 02:27:55 2015 UTC,"In the morning  they get on anytime between 6-8am and on the way home its anytime from 6:30pm to 8:30pm. Looks like they work pretty long days, kinda feel bad for them, hopefully he/she learned a lesson from this though.  I'm on concession, wondering if I could transfer the balance between adult and concession, not that I use opal. Damn you opal for penalizing people who use bus and trains!"
sydney,3dif4e,boblikesbeer,2,Fri Jul 17 02:32:47 2015 UTC,"wondering if I could transfer the balance between adult and concession   I believe you can.  If you add the card to your account, the adult card will still be registered to your account as an adult Opal, but the balance can be transferred over.    The concession entitlement only applies to the specific concession Opal card, not your overall account.  This allows for example, a parent to control several child accounts."
sydney,3dif4e,SilverStar9192,6,Fri Jul 17 02:59:15 2015 UTC,"You can also drop it of at a train station as they send them on to opal, but I wouldn't be surprised if opal just disposes of them like you said..."
sydney,3dif4e,kjoro,4,Thu Jul 16 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah there is really no use for the old card - a new one would have long been issued to the original card holder.  Actually the original card holder can just go get a new card from a newsagent, then register it to their account, and then cancel the old card and transfer the balance via the web site.  Opal isn't exactly going to re-issue the old card to a new cardholder - although that's probably possible from a technical point of view, who wants an old beat up card.  They only cost a dollar or so."

sydney,3dif4e,SilverStar9192,3,Thu Jul 16 21:49:57 2015 UTC,But where do the busses take naps after they terminate early? ): Do they still nap together with the bus drivers at Central?
sydney,3dif4e,megants,4,Thu Jul 16 17:20:40 2015 UTC,"One of the things you might notice is that the Hillsbuses are mostly being sent right back out of the city, instead of down towards Central. They will likely use that large bus carpark that was built along the Gore Hill Freeway.   This will free up space in the bus facility near Central for various bus routes that used to go into the City and are now finishing at Railway Square.   There are increasing numbers of routes terminating at King St Wharf and Walsh Bay, so there will be more buses parked around that area.   Also the increased number of through routes, like 443 connecting to 389, will mean the buses just go straight through the city. These drivers will have to do their napping at the other end points - Maritime Museum and North Bondi in this case."

sydney,3dhpl5,Mfjy578gd5aqr,2,Thu Jul 16 10:48:57 2015 UTC,Short answer: yes. Ask to sit at the bar so you can watch the chefs work. I didn't do the wine pairing though so I can't comment on that.
sydney,3dhpl5,pigslovebacon,2,Thu Jul 16 20:10:55 2015 UTC,"Going against the grain here - NO.  I've been a number of times with friends and work - I've always found it disappointing in terms of the food, which to be fair is the whole point. (Note that I've gotten into an argument with the sous-chef at Marque on my instagram for calling their food shit - serious social media fail)   The atmosphere is somewhat interesting but there are a number of places with open kitchens now. Also if you have three people, 90% of the time, you will be seated at the table and not at the bar.   I think it depends what you are looking for, if you want fancy fancy, I prefer Quay, Sepia or Guillaume and you'd have change left.   These days I'm a little sick of degustations and much prefer the ease of casual dining #firstworldfoodieproblems  If you just want a great feed, the standard of casual dining Sydney is stupidly good and for $875, you can go pretty anywhere and have even more change left over - I'd suggest the recently opened Bennelong as a nice alternative."
sydney,3dhpl5,moomooland,2,Fri Jul 17 02:04:45 2015 UTC,I cannot understand why people like Marque. It's the emperors new clothes. Totally uninteresting  and pedestrian combinations. The worst is those fucking awful paint chips that taste like nothing.

sydney,3dgmst,Pigley_3,7,Thu Jul 16 04:05:07 2015 UTC,"This reads way wrong and I suspect there are certain unwritten rules for which types of syllables are replaced in what ways.  I think that nouns are more likely to get the ""-o"" suffixes, so ""important"" wouldn't get shortened like that. But phrases where the noun is dropped and the adjective turns into a noun, almost always are '-ie.'  For example, ""trackie"" from ""tracksuit"" or ""scratchie"" from ""scratch-off lottery ticket.""  You wouldn't normally lengthen a word unless you're doing so to contract some other part of the phrase.  So there's no need for ""drinkies"" since it's not shorter, but ""pokie"" is fine because it's short for ""poker machine"" (not just poker), postie for postal worker, etc.  The exception is the ""-o"" added to single syllable men's names (Dave -> Dave-O, John -> Johno).  Some exceptions to the ""o"" for nouns though; servo = service station (why is not not servie?), aggro = aggressive.  Edit: clarify."

Jeremy or Jerry becomes ""Jez"" or ""Jezza"" and you also have Gary - > Gazza, Barry - > Baz/Bazza, and Sharon -> Shazza.

I would be careful when describing cultures other to your own using slightly judgmental terms like this.  Diminutives of various sorts are extremely common in many languages.  If you speak some Spanish (since many Americans do), you would know how this works and it's definitely not ""childish"" there - just informal/familiar.

[EDIT: Actually, /u/Gaydag might be right here.] The rest of these are all pretty common terms, yeah. We also use terms like bikie (for members of motorcycle gangs), for instance.  I'm not exactly sure why. There was a joke on an old Australian comedy program about ten years ago (called Micallef Tonight) that suggested that Australians like to diminutise everything, in order to downplay its seriousness. While this was a joke, I think there's a sliver of truth to this.   Americans are the only ones who really call lollies ""candy"". The rest of those terms seem exclusive to Australia, but I could be wrong."

From my personal observations, also as an imported yank (but I've been here 8+ years), one thing that drives a lot of Australian culture is the need for the removal of class barriers  that were formalised and ritualised by the British.  I could see how using ""childish"" sort of language could fit in with that, except now it's simply slang/informal language used in a wide range of situations."
sydney,3dgmst,JackEatsSharks,3,Thu Jul 16 04:17:11 2015 UTC,"Americans, particularly Southerners, are way more formal than Australians, too. I've never in my life called a boss, cop, or teacher ""sir"" or ""ma'am, for instance."
sydney,3dgmst,Tekes88,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:24:21 2015 UTC,"There are certain aspects of southern US ""aristocratic"" culture that parallel British cultural norms much more so than in the rest of the US.  During the American revolution there were many ""tories"" - at the time that referred to loyalists to the UK crown - in the South.  And later Britain was on the cusp of supporting the South during the US Civil war.  Over the years, upper class southerners often styled themselves like British landed gentry, even though the US officially has no aristocratic system.  In the city I grew up in (southeastern US), it was fairly common, even among the middle class, for youth to go to etiquette classes called ""cotillion"" and associated formal events like debutante balls.  But this was exclusively a white thing.  African American culture was distinctly different as you might imagine."

So you want to send a message to the public that it's OK to leave a kid in a car, so long as you're going to a job interview and you can't afford childcare. Why not put the exemption into law then?  It's either a crime or it isn't. If it's a crime then he should be charged. Extenuating circumstances are for a judge to determine, and I agree that he probably doesn't warrant a heavy punishment. A suspended sentence, a suspended fine pending six months probation. If he doesn't lock his kid in a car in six months, then he doesn't have to pay any fine, and his criminal record is expunged. The judge can order that no conviction is recorded, but he should be found guilty if it's a crime that he admits to.  At least that sends a message that it's wrong.  No charges at all sends a message that what he did is OK, and there's no reason that this special snowflake should get special treatment, so it's OK for everyone."

I have also heard of and seen people lose opportunities simply because of their attitude, availability, communication style and you name it come interview time.

I fail to see how you could call my intelligence into question when you're saying it's okay to leave a defenceless child locked in a vehicle in public for an hour. You can disagree with me all you want - but you're wrong, I cannot believe that there are people that are apparently okay with leaving their two year old in public for an hour."
sydney,3dfnpt,wallyupdabungenstein,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:13:41 2015 UTC,"I guess that would have to depend on the situation, now wouldn't it?  There is so much this article doesn't say, that it makes it impossible to judge if he was completely in the wrong or not, and making that pre-judgment is a sign of lack of judgment.   If I knew all of the facts, I may well have looked at the whole thing and said: yeah, lock him up. But I don't, not even close.   So anything that has to do with extrapolating from what you read in the article to making judgment is a sign that you are unable to appreciate the nuances and thought processes that might occur to make such a situation a good option."

Showing knees, leg or ""shape"" is different to having your breasts hanging out.    ""Huge portion of them are on drugs"" ? And? So? What's your problem with that?   The type of drugs these kids are on are incredibly dangerous. They don't know what they are taking and they have no idea how it can (and does) affect their development.

My point is that you need perspective. A little less than a century ago showing your legs as a woman or going to the beach in a normal bathing suit would've been considered quite scandalous.  And now here's you, saying ""No, this time is different, I'm definitely right. I'm the first person in history to know exactly where the line is objectively, here it is, because I say so""  Get some perspective.   The type of drugs these kids are on are incredibly dangerous.    Nope.  http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm  They're not safe (due to criminalisation, not the actual substance), but they're ""less dangerous than horse riding"" to quote the UKs former cheif drug adviser.   You honestly think 18 year olds are carrying around water bottles at night to stay hydrated?   Yeah. I guarentee you that some of them have taken ecstacy, and are carrying water bottles to stay hydrated while they're dancing.   Act like a tool and prepared to be laughed at.   fair enough   Bit ironic. You have flown off the handle at me. You are just as judgemental - you are just being hip by sticking up for the youth.   True. That was pretty hypocritical. I guess it comes as a reaction to the onslaught against ""youths"". It happens constantly, it's tiresome. Young people don't get enough breathing room. They need to be allowed to act dumb, make mistakes, and learn and grow from those mistakes - within reason. So long as no serious harm occurs to others whilst they're going through that stage of their lives, it's fine by me. That's the part I'm saying people should back off from, and not be so judgemental about.  Young people need to act dumb and make mistakes to grow into healthy functional adults.   Most young people don't act like - this isn't normal dress or behaviour.    But everyone has photos of themselves when they were younger with dumbass hairstyles, or stupid clothes, or acting silly, or memories of doing something risky, or making mistakes. Yeh, not exactly the same, but the experience is similar. It's a part of life."

The overwhelming majority of the jokes are coming from people age 16-24 - the same dempgraphic of the kids at the party.   These clowns in the pictures are being laughed at and joked about because they are acting like tools. It's comical. There are some photos that look like they've come out of a comedy show. It's that bad.  It isn't a case of kids being kids. They are all pulling ridiculous poses, the majority of males are clearly stereotypical scummy ""lads"" and the majority of females are all wearing the same damn midriff tops with their breasts falling out. There are a few faces of people clearly having bad trips and come downs. There is a dude with one of the funniest mullets I have ever seen.  It is fucking funny. It is not an attack on youth. It is people laughing at a very comical demographic of people. The majority of the jokes are totally harmless and the kids probably like some of the attention.   Stop being so damn sensitive.  Note: I did say in my first post I do not find the real bullying funny.  That is one thing I agree with you.

It really sucks at the moment :( rent should be around $500/week for a house. The housing situation in Sydney is getting unbelievable!

On the flip side, it would be hard to rent and put your heart and soul into improving a place that someone else will be benefitting on, but it seems that's the way the cookie bounces here for the time being, maybe I will invest in Solar Panels or something or start a small business :)"
sydney,3dhfo3,swineanddine,2,Thu Jul 16 11:09:54 2015 UTC,$275k? That's just about enough for a deposit for a 3 bed house within 15 to 20km of the Sydney CBD. I think you'll either have to settle for a studio/1 bed apt for $400k (if you're lucky) in a nice area.

sydney,3dhfo3,ninth_reddit_account,2,Thu Jul 16 11:14:33 2015 UTC,"So I'm thinking $275[k] tops for house    In Sydney?  Are you kidding?   Have you spent any time on real estate sites like domain.com.au or realestate.com.au ?  Please take a look there (but not if you are prone to heart attacks!).  You need to go many many hours outside the Sydney CBD to get anything in that range.   If you don't have a job I don't know what kind of mortgage you can get, so not really sure about that aspect.  Renting is probably the best option and I don't think landlords overall are ""sharks"" - rents are lower than you might expect given the actual value of the properties.  I guess for Sydney a really rough estimate is that weekly rent is about 1/1000 of the purchase price.  Again that's really rough but gives you a thought to what you might be paying."

If you look at a map that includes going out to (roughly), Hornsby, Penrith, Campbelltown, Sutherland.  The outlying areas normally use their own names, e.g. the Central Coast, Blue Mountains, Southern Highlands, or Wollongong/South Coast.  While these are economically connected to Sydney, and are part of the greater metropolitan area, most people wouldn't directly consider them part of ""Sydney.""   Newcastle in addition has its own economic drivers well separate from Sydney, and isn't really part of the Sydney region (it's the Hunter region), even though it's fairly close."

sydney,3dhaht,Evil_Scientician,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:46:33 2015 UTC,"It could also be to do with the fact that it would interfere with the Kingsgrove Rd Eastbound entrance. They could have them both on the same side, but then you would have a situation like the M5 section between Moorebank Ave and Hume Highway Exits, which would result in traffic weaving. (see https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Liverpool+NSW+2170/@-33.9396183,150.9197425,457m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x6b129610b02d4195:0x5017d681632bea0!6m1!1e1)  I mean they could have switched the exits around, but then you would be entering from Kingsgrove Rd into the fast lane, which is arguably worse.  But as Rougey said, It could also be a billion other reasons.  EDIT: Also consider that the area of motorway we're talking about isn't technically a fast lane/slow lane type deal, since the speed limit is 80 km/h. RMS says you only need to keep left unless overtaking on roads with speed limits above 80 km/h. http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/roads/safety-rules/road-rules/overtaking.html  Pretty annoying, but eh, that's what you get for driving in Sydney :P"

There are pepernoten which are essentially mini speculaas which we only got at Saint Nicholas.   But I agree with you after looking around: apparently speculaas are a Christmas thing.

As such, they are ineligible to request govt benefits or housing - in addition to this, with mental issues often a factor the process of applying for housing proves difficult.  It's really sad that there isn't enough emergency housing for people in need.  As a woman, I'd rather go bush than sleep somewhere more public for fear of sexual/general assault.

sydney,3dcl90,SirQuackington,13,Wed Jul 15 10:02:59 2015 UTC,"Can't agree with that entirely.  While there are many support agencies most don't work and are at or over capacity. The waiting times are very long, if you don't have friends or family you can stay with and can't hold a job then you don't stand a chance.  Throw in medical conditions and mental health issues which also have services which are maxed out, once your one visit a week is up you're on your own until next time. After that you add some attitude and not trusting people or playing by the rules and you're shit out of luck.  If the person was male I would be easier to convince about drugs, substance abuse and other reasons for them choosing to be homeless."

sydney,3ddz32,SilverStar9192,4,Thu Jul 16 05:36:44 2015 UTC,"Admins have gone on a shadowban craze recently (although the new Reddit CEO claims this will stop), so a lot of long time regulars got the boot.  Apparently just following a link to another subreddit and then up or downvoting something was enough for an instant shadowban without warning or explanation.  Seems we lost /u/miss_sparrow to this for example, but hopefully she'll make a new account and pop up again...  I also got shadowbanned but persisted with enough messages to the admins to get un-banned, but for a lot of people it just really turns them off reddit permanently."
sydney,3ddz32,CaptnYossarian,3,Thu Jul 16 00:29:07 2015 UTC,"Anti-brigading tools were basically what slapped a bunch of shadowbans, and why links to other reddits generally favour np.reddit.com (np = non-participation), as used on bestof"
sydney,3ddz32,SilverStar9192,3,Thu Jul 16 01:29:28 2015 UTC,"I get that but it still doesn't make it right to use a no-warning, no-notification approach for obviously real users (lots of karma, old accounts, etc).   The tools were dumb and the fact that reddit management supported it for so long was even dumber.   There's a big difference between someone actively brigading and someone innocently following a link to another subreddit and then voting because they thought it was cool. It's not even clear that this is against the rules, yet potentially thousands of users were shadowbanned for this.   Also, unless it has changed recently the NP thing won't really protect most users. It is the Nepalese language pack and only does something if the target sub has blocked down voting in the CSS for that language. But many subs haven't implemented this, many people have turned off CSS, and most mobile views and apps don't respect CSS controls like this. So it's still easy to get tripped up and banned even if using NP links."
sydney,3ddz32,CaptnYossarian,2,Thu Jul 16 03:56:08 2015 UTC,"Lots of karma and an old account doesn't stop them being part of a brigade, and at times it's not so much the nuance that's needed as a big fat banhammer (or the threat thereof).  I haven't been a mod on reddit, but managing forums elsewhere, sometimes you need tools to slap people down and give everything a timeout. Permanent ban isn't a policy I've used without having a conversation with the affected party, but Reddit's a different scale, and I can understand why mods/admins would deploy these tools - sometimes you'll catch people in the cross-fire, but that may be the best solution for a site with 35 million users.  Yeah, NP's not universal and it's a kludge that fails in many ways, but it's what we've got at the moment, and much like some RES features getting rolled into core Reddit, the more subs that use NP, the more likely something like that can be implemented."
sydney,3ddz32,SilverStar9192,2,Thu Jul 16 04:23:11 2015 UTC,"(or the threat thereof).   The problem was that the threat wasn't being used enough.  Common decency would be to warn someone first, threatening with the ban if the behaviour wasn't stopped.  Not ignore it for years and then suddenly perma-ban people from the entire site with no warning.  As a user, if you weren't following the politics of and details of reddit you would have no idea that the enforcement suddenly got so strict.  There is no reason why warnings and communication about upcoming/possible bans couldn't' be fully automated."
sydney,3ddz32,CaptnYossarian,2,Thu Jul 16 04:25:03 2015 UTC,"Well it's stuff like this that was why I had a lot of sympathy for the mod-led blackout post Victoria's firing - the tools from reddit are crude and really lacking when it comes to managing this stuff, and things like automoderator, NP, etc are stuff people have developed themselves to help manage these things - but even so there's limits to that.  Reddit the company doesn't provide the tools for the nuanced warnings etc, and the typical small list of moderators in a sub can't always keep up, which is where the banhammer comes into play. I'd be surprised if they come up with the tools in the next 6 months after ignoring it for so long, and with the revenue focus that seems to be around, it's not exactly something that will play into reduced costs or increased revenue."
sydney,3ddz32,SilverStar9192,2,Thu Jul 16 04:51:01 2015 UTC,", and the typical small list of moderators in a sub can't always keep up, which is where the banhammer comes into play   I wasn't talking about moderators.  I was referring only to the site-wide shadowbans which are only done by admins or automatic tools as part of a site-wide process.  They have nothing to do with moderators which operate at the subreddit level."
sydney,3ddz32,CaptnYossarian,2,Thu Jul 16 04:53:30 2015 UTC,"I know, I'm saying those tools are usually only deployed when mods think the situation is out of hand & can't be managed. A lack of more nuanced tools is partly to blame for why everything goes from DEFCON 5 to DEFCON 1 at a moment's notice."

Spread out along the platform  The middle carriages of a train tend to be the most crowded - the ratio of seats to passengers can vary by as much as 50% within a single train. If your train is crowded, try boarding nearer each end of the train.  Consider using an all-stops service  Express and limited-stops services are more likely to be crowded. For example, customers travelling from Strathfield to the City will find that seats are more likely to be available on Inner West Line services than South Line services. Check the timetable for your line to see what options are available.  Consider avoiding the busiest part of the peak  More seats are available on services arriving in the Sydney CBD before 8.00am and after 9.00am. Find out when seats are more likely to be available on your line, and consider travelling earlier or later in the day to avoid the busiest part of the peak.   Source: http://www.sydneytrains.info/travelling_with/trip_tips/  I try to avoid crowded train stations. To avoid crowded train stations decreases one's chance of accidentally falling onto the train track or accidentally pushing somebody onto the train track. It seems that there is little space between the platform and the train track."

Dear [manager]:  Please accept this letter as official notice of my resignation from [company].   It is bittersweet as my 10 years at [company] have formed a good part of my professional career so far and I will have many lasting memories.  However, I believe there are better opportunities for professional growth and personal development at another company whose offer I plan to accept.  In accordance with my employment contract, I give one month’s notice.  Therefore, I propose Friday, 1 May 2015 as my final day of employment.   Sincerely, [name, title]   As you can see it's polite and to the point, and gives vague positive reasons for quitting.  I phoned my manager to tell him that I was about to send him my resignation letter (he worked at a remote location to me).  The call was difficult as I had worked there for 10 years, but I was upfront about the fact that this was a completed decision, and the letter was notification of what would happen, not an invitation to bargain (they tried to suggest a counter-offer etc but I had already decided that was not in the cards)."

The letter is filed for personnel records, and it should have date of sending and the expected end date based on that. If you have a conversation where they ask you to stay on longer, or leave earlier, it can be noted on the letter as an amendment.  Have the conversation first though as you've suggested - don't want to just drop the letter and wait for them to react."

Maybe, maybe not.  When I resigned from my part time job that I had during uni, I wrote a letter and physically gave it to my manager on one of my days off. I offered two weeks notice, but due to the nature of the business he preferred to not have me around for that period, which was fine.  You might prefer not to do this.   Kind regards is polite and is used pretty universally. So, unless you want to tell them to fuck off, I'd use it."

While some are unremarkable, I saw a lot of Sydney that I wouldn't have otherwise.  I've eaten some great Sri Lankan food at Pendle Hill, I've visited the exclusive Cheltenham (no businesses allowed), I've been to the modern sterile edifices of Schofields and Shellharbour Junction.   I feel like I should write some more lyrics to ""I've been everywhere, man"" because this is really true when it comes to the Sydney Trains/NSW Trains network for me :)  If you like, post your station and I'll tell you when I went and what I thought."
sydney,3d8m85,Aziante,16,Tue Jul 14 10:53:11 2015 UTC,Which was your favourite station when you add all things together?
sydney,3d8m85,a_can_of_solo,37,Tue Jul 14 11:01:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm that's a hard one, but I think it would have to be Zig Zag. A few reasons:   short platforms, request station (but served by full length trains) gorgeous scenery  challenge of figuring out road access to visit by car.  Zig Zag railway nearby with its workshops and rolling stock  the various feats of engineering nearby - the original Zig Zag and also the 10 tunnels on the main west line that replaced it   It's a bit cheating to say this however as I had visited Zig Zag several times, both by road and by train, before this project. In terms of new stations once I decided to visit all of them, I think Wirragulla, for the various reasons I put in the gallery.   There are  gems all over the place though - Mt Victoria is really pretty landscaping wise, and Bombo right on the beach is unforgettable in its own way.   Edit:  some more of my photos of Zig Zag station:  https://imgur.com/a/r2vdP . The real stunning views in the area are of the Zig Zag itself however (not my photo).  There is also a great view of the Zig Zag viaducts from the bushwalking trail that connects Clarence (which is along the main road), with the Zig Zag ""Bottom Points"" area (the area of the mainline Zig Zag station).    If you have a day to bushwalk this is the ideal way to see this, although you will have to either walk both directions, or use two cars for a shuttle, since there's no other way to get between Bottom Points and Clarence with the Zig Zag railway out of service."
sydney,3d8m85,colondee,7,Tue Jul 14 11:11:31 2015 UTC,request station   how do you get back on?
sydney,3d8m85,yyRequiem,13,Tue Jul 14 12:56:41 2015 UTC,wave furiously when the train approaches
sydney,3d8m85,yyRequiem,6,Tue Jul 14 13:06:17 2015 UTC,Precisely. :)
sydney,3d8m85,Aziante,4,Tue Jul 14 13:38:55 2015 UTC,There's actually a green staff on the platform that you can use to flag it down. That or just waving haha.
sydney,3d8m85,beatmetodeath,3,Wed Jul 15 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"As I said elsewhere, that staff or ""paddle"" definitely wasn't present at Wondabyne or any of the Hunter Line stations that I visited recently, and while it used to be present at Zig Zag, I couldn't find them on my most recent visit (May 2015). On another message board, someone said they were discontinued as they kept getting stolen."
sydney,3d8m85,another-work-acct,2,Wed Jul 15 07:59:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's interesting. I saw them about a couple of months ago when I visited. Shame they got taken."

sydney,3d8m85,Caveman77,6,Wed Jul 15 08:16:55 2015 UTC,"that's so cool man. Must've been such a fun experience. I went on the Zig Zag Railway once with my dad when I was younger, but I love seeing it every time I drive into Newnes State Forest. I haven't actually been to the Sydney Trains platform, I may take a quick drive up next time im out there"
sydney,3d8m85,boblikesbeer,9,Tue Jul 14 11:16:34 2015 UTC,"If you do go via car, you can park at Clarence and walk in, but it's a good steep hike back up.  Track notes and map here.  If you want to drive to the ""Bottom Points"" area (where the Zig Zag station is), you need to drive all the way to Lithgow, via Bells Line of Rd / Chifley Rd.  When you get into town, turn right at the appropriately named Bridge St, cross the bridge, turn right again, and then follow the railway line back towards the east.  You will pass the turnoff for the State Mine, but continue straight along Bells Rd.  Eventually Bells Rd bears to the left, you will need to make a right to continue paralleling the railway .  I think there is a small sign at this turn marked ""Zig Zag Section Hut"" or something like that.  The road turns to gravel and becomes one lane.  Don't worry, this is a public road and you are allowed to be there.  Eventually you will come to the Zig Zag station area; make sure you park in a way that doesn't block the turnaround area at the end of the road, as Railcorp trucks need to use the area, particularly if trackwork is on that weekend.  If you go to a Saturday you might see people from the Zig Zag Railway around - don't enter the workshop area as it is still off-limits after the bushfire, but you can cross the mainline tracks to the Zig Zag station platform if you want.  From the ""carpark"" area, the bushwalking track actually starts straight ahead and slightly to your left - on the same side of the railway as the road.  If you can find it, follow it up for a short distance to get a good view over the precinct.  If there's anyone there from the Zig Zag cooperative, they can help point you to the track, which wasn't well marked last time I was there.  Good luck!"
sydney,3d8m85,puppy2010,2,Tue Jul 14 13:01:19 2015 UTC,Don't forget to call in to the Zig Zag Brewery on the way back. You'll see the sign on Bells Road as you head towards the station.

Also some great bushwalking tracks nearby.  They are really hidden gems of Sydney as they are so close to the city yet so natural."
sydney,3d8m85,oshyare,5,Tue Jul 14 13:36:23 2015 UTC,"Oh cool I never noticed the monitors before, thanks. I've been living here for a year... Glad you enjoyed the walks, you must have seen so many nice places on your journey."
sydney,3d8m85,xosfear,6,Tue Jul 14 13:51:40 2015 UTC,"Yep; I should note that I've been travelling all over the rail network for the 8+ years I've lived in Sydney, so many of my comments here come from other visits over that time.    For example I had already taken every single train line right to the end (including all of the regional/XPT/XPL lines, except the Broken Hill one), so I've technically been to each of those stations before, but this recent project was about visiting them on foot and tapping on/off at each Opal pole."
sydney,3d8m85,AncientSamus,3,Tue Jul 14 14:08:20 2015 UTC,That station there is a PA ban there so the staff aren't aloud to play any messages on the PA as some locals complained...

(Or is there more than one?)  Macquarie University?  I know it's not very unique, but I like it. Stays a decent temperature. Needs more seats though."
sydney,3d8m85,xosfear,10,Tue Jul 14 11:36:14 2015 UTC,I do like the super deep stations on the ECRL. The design reminds me of the Washington DC metro for some reason. The super high escalators don't always agree with my mild fear of heights however!
sydney,3d8m85,Shunto,8,Tue Jul 14 11:40:04 2015 UTC,"The lifts are quite popular. It gets annoying when you're coming home from a trip away with luggage and have to wait for the lift because a bunch of uni students are lazy but in a hurry.  The lift time is roughly equivalent to running up the escalators. I do it sometimes just to get there at the same time as the other people, trip them out a little."
sydney,3d8m85,funfwf,4,Tue Jul 14 12:19:22 2015 UTC,So it really is just houses and a school   That and a lawn bowls club that's about it...  Though the station is been renovated to allow for a third track between Epping and Thornleigh.

sydney,3d8m85,FarKingCnut,7,Tue Jul 14 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"Fun Fact. There was a rich old lady who had a house on what is now the Cheltenham girls school grounds. When she died, she bequeathed the property to the school so they could expand, on the proviso they kept the school uniform pink."
sydney,3d8m85,kerodean,5,Tue Jul 14 23:09:57 2015 UTC,"Telling this story here because I have no where else to tell  There's a Catholic Girls School in Glebe called Saint Scholastica's which also has a boarding college. The boarding college is actually an old Mansion and the guy used to own roughly 1/3 of the current Glebe boundary (it's still a massive suburb). When he passed away his will stipulated that his land was not to be sold to any church because he hated religion. Well the nuns got people to bid for them in secret, bought the grounds and turned it into the school it is today!"

sydney,3d8m85,funfwf,2,Wed Jul 15 02:33:28 2015 UTC,Heh. The exclusive bit was mainly because there was a sign at the station talking about how the suburb was residential only and disallowed businesses. Something about how the original owner/developer wanted it that way.
sydney,3d8m85,WoollyMittens,7,Tue Jul 14 21:36:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah i live in Cheltenham, there's nothing there. You have to drive to either Beecroft, Epping or Carlingford to get something from the shops. The people there are a special breed, they're all retired and at one point or another probably had money, snobby, senile, not at all friendly and wouldn't be seen waving to the neighbours when they drive past. Now they sit at home and write letters to the council. One of them wrote so many letters to the council that she decided to run in the next election. She lost in a landslide with a total of 140 votes."
sydney,3d8m85,funfwf,2,Tue Jul 14 23:11:59 2015 UTC,I don't understand your comment regarding the 'exclusive Cheltenham'?

sydney,3d8m85,funfwf,26,Wed Jul 15 00:06:05 2015 UTC,"This post is awesome. On my bucket list is to visit one of the short stations where you have to tell the guard that you're getting off, like Wondabyne."
sydney,3d8m85,WoollyMittens,21,Tue Jul 14 11:10:50 2015 UTC,"Wondabyne is a great choice for that. It's not that far from the city and has a decent number of trains, compared to say Zig Zag or Bell, which are also request stations, but only have service every two hours. You can walk up the bushwalk trail nearby for some nice views of the region (it goes up a steep escarpment right away). Or maybe take a fishing line and fish off the wharf for a bit. It's a beautiful spot."

sydney,3d8m85,StereotypicalAussie,6,Tue Jul 14 11:29:36 2015 UTC,I lived at Berowra and now Tascott (What do you think of Tascott station btw lol). I pass Wondabyne all the time and one day it was completely packed out with young trainspotters and full camera rigs.
sydney,3d8m85,boblikesbeer,5,Tue Jul 14 12:41:05 2015 UTC,"Tascott, Koolewong, and Point Clare, are somewhat odd stations due to their quite short platforms, even though it's a busy part of the CCN line served by lots of trains.   Some pretty nice houses in that area and good views of Brisbane Water.  Unfortunately it was raining the day I did the CCN line and I had a lot of stations to cover in one day, so I didn't stick around, but would like to visit again some time."
sydney,3d8m85,magicaxis,2,Tue Jul 14 13:13:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah its quite nice, although annoying because they are so small the trains arent as regular. Theres no shops at Tascott anymore though but theres a quite good coffee shop across from Koolewong station."

sydney,3d8m85,boblikesbeer,2,Wed Jul 15 08:00:42 2015 UTC,Looks brill but 20km/8h Is a bit much for me. Thinking of doing the Pinder caves walk from there which is a more achievable 14km round trip.
sydney,3d8m85,jayteeayy,2,Wed Jul 15 07:46:47 2015 UTC,I did that trip a few years ago.  Bring insect repellent and wear long pants and shirts.   There were a lot of growth that brushes up against you.
sydney,3d8m85,jayteeayy,2,Wed Jul 15 08:01:24 2015 UTC,"That should prove quite spectacular. :D Be sure to pack a GPS though, because the track is a little overgrown near the end."
sydney,3d8m85,boblikesbeer,2,Wed Jul 15 08:26:11 2015 UTC,"I am not an experienced bushwalker but it is something I am wanting to try. There will only be 2 of us going. Would a smartphone with offline GPS maps suffice? Would I need to carry anything apart from water, food, mozzie repellant? I'll be doing this in the next few weeks so the weather shouldn't be hot."
sydney,3d8m85,walkerreuben,3,Wed Jul 15 08:51:17 2015 UTC,"Would a smartphone ... suffice?   Sure, your phone will be just fine. Just be sure not to run the battery completely dry and leave enough charge for an emergency call.   offline GPS maps   The Pindar cave track is not on Google Maps, so be sure to download one of the many free Android OpenStreetMap apps or iPhone OpenStreetMap apps.   Would I need to carry anything apart from water, food, mozzie repellant?    Bring a raincoat just in case. The bugs aren't bad there either.  You have to ask the train guard to actually stop at Wondabyne a few station before you get there. If you plan on getting back on the train there too, make sure you wave at the oncoming train or they might not be able to slam on the brakes on time.  Good luck! Be sure to post your adventure on the subreddit. :D"
sydney,3d8m85,walkerreuben,2,Wed Jul 15 09:36:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the help! I have my OsmAnd app ready from when I went travelling so I've just updated my maps and I'll be ready to go.

sydney,3d8m85,FashionSense,10,Tue Jul 14 11:01:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I visited Killara on April 28th in the evening. I had a number of North Shore stations to visit that night and looks like I only spent a few minutes there. On that trip I did stop at Gordon for some takeaway Indian food, and I also remember noting Lindfield's odd design with multiple levels. Most of the stations in that area are really leafy and pretty, and I should really go back in the day time."
sydney,3d8m85,puppy2010,10,Tue Jul 14 11:50:25 2015 UTC,"If you do the North Shore during the day Gordon station has an old signal box on platforms 2-3 where the platform staff work, it's quite popular with a lot of rail buffs."
sydney,3d8m85,Linksterman,5,Tue Jul 14 12:07:36 2015 UTC,nice! curry monitor in gordon? that spot is pretty ace. i like the leafiness of the north shore stations too. thanks for sharing your thoughts!
sydney,3d8m85,puppy2010,8,Tue Jul 14 12:22:16 2015 UTC,That station used win best garden awards (don't know if they still do enter/have these things)  Also that word means permanent or always there in an Aboriginal language.
sydney,3d8m85,gogboy30,10,Tue Jul 14 11:27:22 2015 UTC,"Amazing post.  How does a request station work? I understand it for getting off, but how do they know if someone wants to get on?   Do they just slow down and look for passengers?"
sydney,3d8m85,gogboy30,11,Tue Jul 14 12:11:23 2015 UTC,"The train travels slow enough through these areas so that the driver can see if anyone is on the platform, and stop in time if so.  I've stopped trains at both Wondabyne and Zig Zag - it's worked fine both times.   There used to be flags/signs of a sort at Zig Zag that you could use to signal the driver, but I think they kept getting stolen. Perhaps /u/boblikesbeer may know more about this."
sydney,3d8m85,DogPawsCanType,8,Tue Jul 14 12:19:36 2015 UTC,"Depends on the station some the driver slows down, some have a little button to request a stop and if your not sure you can use the orange help point and they can contact the train to request a stop for you.   Though I haven't been to these so I can't really say for sure how effective all these ways of doing really is..."
sydney,3d8m85,DogPawsCanType,6,Tue Jul 14 12:32:34 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen buttons to request the stop anywhere in NSW.  Maybe in the past?  I have been to a place that definitely has them - the Norristown High Speed Line in Philadelphia, USA.  It lights up a light that can be seen by the driver from some distance away.  I think in NSW this simply hasn't been needed since the main request stops are on fairly slow parts of the railway anyway."
sydney,3d8m85,clomclom,2,Tue Jul 14 13:42:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe in the past then, spose the help point is a button... It's been ages since I have needed to think about this stuff tbh and my knowledge of these things is based on what different train crew have told me in the past. Though I do admit there are some gaps if my knowledge when it comes to the intercity network."
sydney,3d8m85,megablast,9,Tue Jul 14 14:03:05 2015 UTC,"This is so incredibly awesome. Really interesting stuff, some of these stations are incredibly picturesque   As for my local, Leumeah train station was rebuilt in the late 90s to do away with the crossing and a bridge was built about a km away over the line. Cool part is that the council decided to keep the original crossing sign and plant it in the garden right outside the station for heritage sake. Its still there today"
sydney,3d8m85,ieatkittentails,3,Tue Jul 14 11:35:26 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I missed that about Leumeah. Cool. I have to admit with so many stations to visit I didn't always spend as much time exploring the suburban ones as I would have liked to. Leumeah was one I went to by car on my way back from the Southern Highlands in January, and it was a super hot day so I mainly just found the Opal pole, tapped on (or off) and got back in the car!"
sydney,3d8m85,Rougey,2,Tue Jul 14 11:44:50 2015 UTC,"I dont blame you, could imagine trawling through all those inner city stations would have been a bit of a chore since so many are designed pretty similarly (I honestly wasnt expecting much when I saw this post, but I, like like many others it seems, was pleasantly surprised)"

For example I found a few stations, Petershan I think was one, that still have really old wooden planking on the stairs."
sydney,3d8m85,aidenh37,4,Tue Jul 14 11:54:42 2015 UTC,"Plus the Former Petersham station building is quite lovely   There used to be another platform there on middle set of tracks (suburban set rather than the local set that is left now) you can sort of see the remains of it, there was also a siding there that is now the training center for transport."
sydney,3d8m85,aidenh37,8,Tue Jul 14 12:48:05 2015 UTC,"Dungog. Apparently the trains use to go a couple of stations further. A pity that stopped or I'd be able to get to my hometown really cheaply.  I did catch a train from Central once, changed at Hamilton (Newcastle), and got off at Dungog. Took me 5 hours.  Probably an hour or two faster to go via the XPT though."
sydney,3d8m85,kerodean,3,Tue Jul 14 11:42:12 2015 UTC,Well if you want to save money you could use the intercity train to Dungog and then XPT from there. The time tabling probably makes that a bit of a long day however.
sydney,3d8m85,boblikesbeer,3,Tue Jul 14 11:56:36 2015 UTC,"I caught the intercity from Epping to Broadmeadow once, and then caught the XPT the rest of the way. That adds about an hour to the trip, saves about $10, almost $20 if it's on a weekend and you've hit your opal cap. I decided it wasn't worth it. I value my sleep at more than $10 an hour."
sydney,3d8m85,aidenh37,8,Tue Jul 14 12:17:02 2015 UTC,Fantastic stuff. I would love to do this myself one day. I am particularly fascinated by the very short platforms!

sydney,3d8m85,Korzic,9,Tue Jul 14 13:43:36 2015 UTC,One of the best posts i've ever seen in this sub. As a born and bred Sydney lad I was obsessed with the trains when I was little and your pictures brought back tons of memories. The zig zag railway is rad.   This post deserves to go in the /r/sydney hall of fame or something.
sydney,3d8m85,vidyagames,7,Tue Jul 14 14:35:54 2015 UTC,"Great project! This was an unexpectedly interesting read; it was fun following your journey through photos.  My local is Carlingford - probably one of the more run-down/basic suburban stations, wouldn't you say? The 30-minute frequency was the bane of my existence for a few years travelling into the city for uni."
sydney,3d8m85,Assandfinger,4,Tue Jul 14 13:07:17 2015 UTC,"Carlingford was neat as you can see that it used to be an industrial area with a number of freight sidings connecting to the end of the rail line there, out in that grassy area.  It's really too bad that NSW has so little industry receiving freight by rail these days.  It's much more efficient than trucks for certain types of goods.  The Carlingford Line is mostly only a 60 minute frequency.  I don't understand why they can't at least make it 30 minutes all day long.  The return trip for a single train set takes about 20 minutes, so that leaves 5 minutes to turn it around at each end, and they could still have a 30-minute frequency.     But despite the 60 minute frequency on weekends, there were actually about 10 people waiting for the train when I went there!  I do like the proposal to convert it to light rail.  Ideally they could work out a way to connect it to Granville at the south end, instead of Clyde, to give it better connections."
sydney,3d8m85,alotofwords,5,Tue Jul 14 13:27:58 2015 UTC,"ITT: People giving their location away, but I'll bite.   What did you think of Burradoo? Probably the last station you'd remember, but I'm curious. Recently moved there and it's so much homelier than Turramurra was."
sydney,3d8m85,velocifaptorsaurus,7,Tue Jul 14 13:12:12 2015 UTC,"Wait, do you commute from Burradoo to Central daily?  That really would be an extreme commute.  Or do you stay somewhere in the City while working at Central?"
sydney,3d8m85,puppy2010,3,Tue Jul 14 14:05:31 2015 UTC,"Yea, stay in Turramurra till I can afford (or much more realistically flatshare) someplace in Sydney   Edit: but I would do the commute if I had to."
sydney,3d8m85,demondice,3,Tue Jul 14 22:16:25 2015 UTC,"Burradoo is in the album!  I liked it a lot.  Was down a quiet and unpretentious street and was pretty and shaded.  I actually waited while a train came and went and was surprised to see quite a few people alighting.  It was on a Sunday but I don't think people had quite caught onto $2.50 Opal journeys on Sundays, as I didn't see any of these passengers tap off.  Maybe most passengers don't bother to buy a ticket at all for short journeys within the Southern Highlands line - as many of these stations don't even have the facilities."
sydney,3d8m85,i_justwanna_knowww,4,Tue Jul 14 13:22:05 2015 UTC,"I just learnt that Newcastle station has closed down! Also, what a cool post. I have always found the train stations fascinating, and you have certainly showed me a bunch I never knew existed."
sydney,3d8m85,Karmafia,5,Tue Jul 14 11:27:49 2015 UTC,Yay Linden made it into the album! The Opal pole really is in the middle of nowhere.
sydney,3d8m85,kris171,4,Tue Jul 14 12:21:54 2015 UTC,"I accidently got off at Linden once and this sole pole was one of the major sources of entertainment while i waited for the next train! i loved the old water reservoir hidden on the the ridge line above the station, the remains of a cable-bucket system and all of its graffiti art. It was once used to fill up steam trains with water! (Penrith station still has a taller, uglier one!)  If you've never seen it before, it's just a few metres behind where this shot was taken."
sydney,3d8m85,oliverbm,2,Tue Jul 14 17:01:05 2015 UTC,That's a nice shot of Linden.  I wish I had some better shots of Blue Mountains and South Coast Line stations so they could be better represented in this album.  Both of those lines go through some beautiful areas.
sydney,3d8m85,El_Rodeo,4,Tue Jul 14 23:11:35 2015 UTC,"I think Medlow Bath was another station with a similarly placed Opal pole. I noticed different patterns in Opal pole placement in different areas - must be different people responsible, or perhaps different standards in terms of where electrical connections could be run. For example Blue Mountains stations almost always had the poles on the platform, whereas in other areas they might be on the bridges or concourses."
sydney,3d8m85,Frenchy182,2,Tue Jul 14 15:19:22 2015 UTC,Didn't Linden used to be a request stop? I could swear it was on some trains until the 2013 timetable.
sydney,3d8m85,NoddysShardblade,2,Tue Jul 14 12:39:40 2015 UTC,I don't remember it being request in high school which was 2011. It most likely was a few years ago though.
sydney,3d8m85,mhacdebhandia,2,Tue Jul 14 13:18:09 2015 UTC,IIRC it was only a request stop on some peak hour trains.
sydney,3d8m85,RichieMclad,4,Tue Jul 14 23:49:49 2015 UTC,"being a dungog boy (hence username) I'm strangely happy someone took the time to waste traversing the horrid trainline that i called home for so many years. It's strange seeing it some -7 years on since i left, though not surprising that none of it looks any different! Also, must ask why the fuck did you bother? You literally appear to have taken some trips to nowhere."
sydney,3d8m85,NoddysShardblade,7,Tue Jul 14 12:56:22 2015 UTC,"I don't find these places ""nowhere.""  I quite enjoy visiting new places which is what made this project continually interesting for me.  Dungog in particular is a pleasant town - this was actually my second visit as I had come via train once a few years prior.  At Dungog on this trip, I stopped at a quite nice bakery and got an apple strudel slice of some sort, and a 600 mL diet coke from the newsagent.  I ate/drank those on the drive to Singleton, which was my next stop, to cover the other branch of the Hunter line.  Oh, and I also remember Dungog as I realised after stopping at the newsagency that I had inadvertently parked in a No Stopping zone.  Fortunately, it being a small town, there were no rangers ready to pounce on such an infraction :)  This thread has turned into a sort of bizarre travelogue, I hope people don't mind... :)"
sydney,3d8m85,f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9,4,Tue Jul 14 13:18:29 2015 UTC,"good idea driving, i was imagining a poor soul waiting at mindaribba, wallarobba etc and having to wait hours for the next train, in some sort of epic cathartic/sort of self flagellating exercise!"
sydney,3d8m85,f1f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9,3,Tue Jul 14 21:20:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, while I like trains and train stations, it would have taken many more months to do things that way!  It was slow enough visiting most of the suburban stations by train, particularly those with 30-minute frequencies."
sydney,3d8m85,warriortah,9,Tue Jul 14 21:41:19 2015 UTC,"This is pretty cool, what made you do this and how long did you spend doing it?"
sydney,3d8m85,Glenn89,13,Tue Jul 14 11:01:23 2015 UTC,"The whole project took about six months, but the majority of the intercity stations were covered in three separate weekends:  1a)  did the whole South Coast Line on a Saturday and drove to Exeter/etc spending the night in Goulburn. A very long day as there are a lot of stations around Wollongong, and then some longer distances as you go further south 1b) Southen Highlands Line and South Line (most of it)   2a) drove to Newcastle (Cardiff) and did that whole region including all of the Hunter branches and many of the photos posted. Long day. Stayed in Maitland. 2b) CCN line: Cockle Creek through Hornsby except a few places already visited - another long day; some of these stations are far away from major roads, plus it rained all day  3) Blue Mountains Line out to Bathurst. Richmond Line on the way back. Another huge day.   4) most suburban lines by train over a dozen or so other half days at a time mostly.  Covered the Illawarra and Cronulla all in one big day, and all by train. This day also included some of the Bankstown Line just for good measure.  Ended up going to Kirawee twice for no good reason (lost track).  5) Carligford Line and most of the western line on another day by car (the completion day, 10 May), as I didn't want to deal with the 30 minute frequencies out west. Some stations tricky to park at. Almost got a parking ticket at Burwood (which oddly I hadn't visited yet).  But had the goal in mind :)"
sydney,3d8m85,freepenguin,9,Tue Jul 14 11:37:22 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, for some reason I was thinking you did it all by train which would of been a real mission.  There used to be a station called Allendale near Maitland which was tiny. My pop used to work on the railways a long time ago, started off in the bush and ended up as the station master at central. He had a thing called a gold pass that gave him free travel everywhere for life so as a little kid I was constantly going on trips up the coast and to Tamworth and places like that.   Here is Allandale station in all its glory"

Then caught the next train (or back the other way, depending on which worked out better timetable wise).  Many of the regional and outer suburban stations were visited by car however.  This was a more practical way to get to these locations in a reasonable amount of time.  For why, read some of my other replies.  Mainly because, why not?"

sydney,3d8m85,CaptnYossarian,5,Tue Jul 14 12:20:13 2015 UTC,"Asquith is a bit different in the way at least one of the platforms is right at ground level - no incline up - if I remember correctly.  Also interesting that the Hornsby Maintenance Centre is so big that it stretches almost all the way to Asquith station.   Hornsby is of course a major well known transfer station so not sure what to say about it. Except that I have been there both before during and after the construction of the extra platform.  Despite that, Hornsby can still be a train bottleneck due to the way the two lines join, many services terminate, etc."

sydney,3d8m85,AncientSamus,4,Tue Jul 14 22:32:01 2015 UTC,"I love this. This is something I would totally do if I could!! I used to always take a random train trip from school to anywhere just to chill with friends on the train and enjoy the view (before you take out your pitchforks, we never took these trips during peak hours or on packed trains.)   What jump started this idea?   And what's your favourite place to visit by train for the place and the trip there by train."
sydney,3d8m85,sfacets,10,Tue Jul 14 12:23:20 2015 UTC,"What jump started this idea?   I think it was when I read about Opal having been rolled out to every single station, including some of these really isolated ones.  The placement of the Opal poles is really funny in some cases.  So I figured I'd check out and photograph some of the Opal poles (notice most of my photos show them).  Using Opal also allowed me to track which ones I've visited somewhat easily.   And what's your favourite place to visit by train for the place and the trip there by train.   Wow, hard question, but for a short trip, Hawkesbury River (Brooklyn) is a winner.  Nice ride down the Cowan bank (escarpment) and a relaxing spot for some fish and chips.  There's also a park up on the hill with a good view of the precinct.  For a longer trip, head down to Gerringong or Berry on the South Coast Line.  The South Coast Line between Otford and Austinmer is gorgeous and is really one of the world's best coastal train rides.  And then I find the section from Kiama to Gerringong to be other-worldly.  It's like NZ or England or a scene from the LotR.  I don't know why I like that scenery so much but it's just really stunning.  If you are fit and up for a bit of a walk, there is a coastal track from Kiama to Gerringong as well, but do note it's 10+ km and involves wading across an inlet.  Still I've done it and would recommend.  (I wouldn't recommend being in a massive rush to catch the train at Gerringong however.  Better to do it from Gerringong->Kiama instead of the other way.)  Another trip just for the sake of travelling that I recommend is a big looping multi- modal trip involving the Central Coast to Palm Beach:   Train from City to Woy Woy station - nice scenery of the Cowan Bank, Hawkesbury River, Mullet Creek, etc. Lunch at Woy Woy - there's a nice seafood takeaway on the wharf there.  People-watching in Woy Woy is fun too :) Bus or taxi from Woy Woy to Ettalong ferry wharf. Ferry service from Ettalong to Palm Beach (check timetables) Visit Palm Beach if you like - short bus ride to the ocean beach, or walk up the bushwalking track over the hill. L90 bus to Warringah Mall Transfer to Bus to Manly Ferry, Manly-> Circular Quay    (of course the L90 goes back to the city too)   You can do all of that on Opal except the Ettalong->Palm Beach ferry which is about $11."

sydney,3d8m85,Ayrr,3,Tue Jul 14 11:02:41 2015 UTC,How was my local Marayong? Did you get anything from the awesome Viet run bakery across the road? Or Quakers Hill?
sydney,3d8m85,Ayrr,7,Tue Jul 14 12:30:11 2015 UTC,"I went to both of those at night unfortunately, but I remember Marayong because of its very tall glass enclosed lift.  (I'm not always the best with heights.)   Quakers Hill station was a bit embarrassing - I had used my phone with Google Maps to find the entrance to these stations.  I went to Quakers Hill, tapped off my Opal card, and then left.  But I didn't properly program in the next station, drove away for a bit and then started following the GPS instructions blindly.  Turns out I still had Quakers Hill station programmed in and it started taking me back to where I was.  Oops.   It was the end of a very long day as I had covered the entire Blue Mountains line out to Bathurst (including Zig Zag etc), earlier that day.  I do like the Richmond Line and have been out that way a number of times before Opal, including for the first day of operation of Schofields Station.   I think Windsor station is my favourite on that line, although Vineyard is appropriately isolated enough to perhaps feature in an album like this."
sydney,3d8m85,CaptnYossarian,4,Tue Jul 14 13:10:15 2015 UTC,"The Richmond line is a very picturesque journey, especially as most of it is single track, you can look out either window and see nothing but fields and cows and trees and shit. Quite surreal to be seeing that while on a Tangara."

sydney,3dcttt,h3ndofry,5,Wed Jul 15 11:25:06 2015 UTC,"You don't get them back. Instead, they age, and after 40 months they are no longer counted towards your current total if you commit any other driving offences."

I never thought a banana could taste so good! If I'd had the money, I would have bought him out of stock. Fortunately, I didn't, so I stopped at a couple, erm 4.  Trade shows are fun, but hard on the feet. Lots of walking all day. Buggered now."

sydney,3dcttt,niteblane,2,Wed Jul 15 11:46:04 2015 UTC,Corks are stupid and part of the reason I swore off wine a while back. As in I could never get the pesky mofos out without a fight

sydney,3dcttt,HeadacheCentral,5,Wed Jul 15 11:44:57 2015 UTC,"Type of food? Preference for location? Time of week?  Weekends are more expensive at most places.  Personally, I don't reckon you can go wrong with Sydney Tower - the buffet is pretty damn good, but might not suit your company tastes. Too, you've only got an hour and a half per sitting, which can put some people off, but the view is great!"
sydney,3dcttt,-Hao-,4,Wed Jul 15 11:48:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response! hahas the buffet looks awesome(damn im hungry), but the 1.5hrs per seating feels short for a corporate dinner sadly. hahas   dont really need the exact place but it will be awesome if there are suggest. just wondering what is the price estimation to put in the budget xD   its a monday to weds, need to have 3 days of dinner  Might be staying either in Novotel Sydney Central – 169 Thomas Street or Park Royal Darling Harbour - 150 Day Street.   there will be a mix of people from these  countries : Singapore Malaysia Thailand India Vietnam Pakistan Sri Lanka Philippines Japan and some of them are some vegetarians.

There is a non-buffet option (on the next floor down), but it's much more expensive. Probably not suitable for a corporate gathering either.   dont really need the exact place but it will be awesome if there are suggest. just wondering what is the price estimation to put in the budget   For a decent, restaurant based feed you're looking at a minimum of probably $45 per person, maybe $60 if you want to include drinks - but that's without going anywhere too fancy.  Actually, we had a meet up at a great place in the Rocks - Phillips Foote which is a flat base $32 plus drinks, but you've got to cook your own steak. Don't know if that's be suitable for one night.   Might be staying either in Novotel Sydney Central – 169 Thomas Street or Park Royal Darling Harbour - 150 Day Street.   If you're staying at Darling Harbour, you could always go to The Star, but some of the restaurants there are very pricey.  Maybe look into Chinatown. There are a number of outstanding places down there."
sydney,3dcttt,AncientSamus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:03:54 2015 UTC,"PLS NO!!, dont eat at the sydney tower, seriously no, the food there is over priced and is very limited choice, the reason why its expensive there is because they have to shoot the food up an elevator!  if you seriously want to eat at a buffet go eat at Garden buffet in the casino, i wouldnt say its super high quality, but its pretty good for $40 per head.  also, you just need to cross a foot bridge (depending on where you live) to get to the casino."

To quote Opal support:   After tapping on, and during the journey, the system holds an amount equivalent to a default fare. If this results in the Opal card balance moving below $10.00, auto top up will be activated.   And here I was thinking that the whole point of it being $10 is to ensure that you've got enough to cover even the default fare. Apparently not."
sydney,3dcttt,hamandcheeseisation,3,Wed Jul 15 10:18:49 2015 UTC,The $10 auto top up thing has caused me so much grief - many times I haven't had enough money in my bank account and it comes out before I can top the account up - it's harder than it sounds because sometimes it might even kick in at a higher value and leaves me having to set up the subscription again. So annoying.

sydney,3dbecd,setzz,16,Wed Jul 15 01:41:30 2015 UTC,"So make it compulsory for everyone then, including children, passengers in motor vehicles and pedestrians. Everything you've said applies to everyone out in public, so surely we need to require everyone to carry photo ID at all times."
sydney,3dbecd,Zedexx,3,Wed Jul 15 02:44:11 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. What's wrong with having ID's with you at all times?  Having said that, it's more practical if it's are based on certain issues, maybe say some being requirements (legal issues) some being encouraged (medical or safety issues)."

More cycling promotes better public health, less congestion.

If you have amnesia, you should be wearing a medi alert bracelet anyway. If you get amnesia, nothing will affect your stay in hospital, apart from alerting your S/O.

Forget the argument of cyclists hurting pedestrians, most pedestrians are hurt in car accidents.  Forget registration, its based on vehicle weight good luck registering a 10kg road bike for more than it would cost to do the paperwork.  Oh and general tax pays for the roads, not registration.

sydney,3dbecd,moomooland,2,Thu Jul 16 03:51:50 2015 UTC,"I think my only gripe with the fine is that some infrastructure fails cyclists.  A perfect example is near turramurra where a carbon bike won't trigger the lights. I have literally sat there for 10/20mins just waiting for a car to come up behind and trigger the set.   Another being college street where buses and bikes are meant to coexist which simply doesn't work, they can't see us.  But riding on the path would incur a massive fine."

sydney,3dbecd,moomooland,2,Thu Jul 16 04:20:19 2015 UTC,"I like to think of it like this...   We know cyclist like to go fast where they can and we choose the fastest routes. Pretty much everyone I know who rides has this mentality. However there is one exception. If its too dangerous.  So their only other option is the footpath where its slow and they risk a fine, but it's still better than being hit by are car or bus. Yes, a lot of them riding on the paths are space cadets but tbh you get as much abuse from people riding on the footpath as you do walking your bike on the footpath.   Ironically to trigger those lights that don't trigger for bikes you have to ride the footpath and press the pedestrian crossing button. So that leaves the choice of, run the red light fine, the footpath fine or get abused by motorists because no ones triggering the lights.  Most cyclist try to do the right thing but even more want to get home in one piece to their loved ones."

That ""fastest route"" mentality rings alarm bells for me - everyone believes their internal risk assessment is finely tuned - that is until they get into an accident and your top speed as a cyclist is higher than my top speed as a runner.   But it's not something that is going to be solved immediately and the original point of asking cyclists to carry ID, is something that's not unreasonable and it's should not be construed as a catalyst for accountability, it's just that the law is built in a consequential manner and the consequences must always outweigh the action.   We all share the road with different types of vehicles, all vehicles operators are required to carry ID  - this concept that cyclists are so holy that they shouldn't be subject to that basic requirement is quite frankly ridiculous as is the concept of comparing them to pedestrians and public transport users.   I don't disagree that rules and traffic systems need to be continually adapted to cyclists but at the same time, car rules are continually being adapted so there's nothing set in stone, it's an evolving process. But there is also a requirement that cyclists understand that sharing the road (and footpaths) comes with a shared responsibility."

Drivers are not made to carry ID - they are obliged to carry their licence (which happens to be accepted as ID). If cyclists were required to be licensed then this would be a moot point but the fact is they aren't. That is a separate argument - this is about carrying ID. If we accept the rational that most people seem to be suggesting then everyone that is at risk of injury or police apprehension should also be obliged to carry ID. Orwell here we come.

But we can talk about pedestrians, or public transport users on another time.   FWIW, In my opinion, it's besides the point if it's cyclist or pedestrians, everyone really should bring ID's."

Some OEM car manufacturers also use the Whereis crap. Expensive map updates and what not. I suspect that's changed with charging for updates as other competitors are not.  Now using Garmin that uses NAVTEQ mapping and never looked back. I just love the clarity of the maps and the frequency of free updates to the maps (every 6-9 months) and updates to the firmware of the units.  Also you can get ""free"" (dodgy) red light/speed camera updates from community forums or you can subscribe to them.  Just get one with ""lifetime"" map updates and you're sweet. Maybe one with voice recognition, always useful when driving."

sydney,3dd8dm,johnbentley,4,Thu Jul 16 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"download WAZE on your smartphone for free, it's owned by Google who paid a billion dollars for it 2 years ago. Maps are current as they are updated nearly everyday by users. There is a rank system so a new user can't start editing the M4 etc. Cameras, potholes, vehicles blocking road etc are available.  It uses your mobile phone data for live traffic. Historical data is by far the best compared to it's ""competition"". Every segment that is mapped has an average speed, Eg main ,secondary and local street, and is updated whenever someone drives over the segment, whereas the competition generally focus on the main roads. I've used Tom Tom before but prefer WAZE. Also data is feed into by the RMS re accidents & road works as part of Waze's Connected Citizens program with the government. Usually during peak hour their are 200-300 users online so the coverage is quite good, uptake has been a bit slower in Australia, although it has 50+ million users worldwide, it's not going anywhere, it doing what Google do so well, destroying the competition.

sydney,3dd8dm,SirQuackington,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:39:09 2015 UTC,Interesting idea. I've been using HERE Maps (Nokia's mapping  solution) for the past few months and have really liked it. Only downside is that it chews through my mobiles battery like  anything!   I'll give Waze a shot if my stand alone GPS plans don't materialise ;)
sydney,3dd8dm,SirQuackington,3,Thu Jul 16 08:12:28 2015 UTC,"The free Nokia Here on Android looks good. I haven't tested it in the wild. It has offline capability. The best thing about Nokia Here is that it has an offline base map, and a satellite overlay which depends on a connection. If you can't get a reception the base map is still available to you (after you download ""Australia/Oceania"").  The free Waze and Google Maps/Navigation would also be worth a go, but they both depend on an active connection for best use (Google Maps/Navigation has the ability to save maps offline, but you have be quite conscious of the targert areas you are going to and download ahead of time).   Back in the day hardware TomTom 730Go seemed to have the most up to date, most comprehensive map (with a good speed and traffic camera db). The application was well designed.  But the company itself seems to have lost the plot. The android version from TomTom, for example, was painful (I've tried their latest)."

sydney,3dcx4d,spottycow,7,Fri Jul 17 05:48:56 2015 UTC,"I would first check what type of criminal records they are going to be checking.  Is your shoplifting conviction a summary offense/misdemeanor, and maybe the check is only for indictable offenses, or something like that?  If that's the case it might be something you don't need to worry about.  I don't know if this actually applies but I would suggest looking into it.  Maybe ask in /r/auslaw what the NPC covers. (Just be sure you phrase it in a way that you're not asking for legal advice directly, as that can't be answered.)  However, if you are sure that the issue will come up, I think as an employer I would want that to be known asap.  I think yo uwould look better bringing it up and explaining yourself similar to how you've done so here.  However I would also caution you not to be too optimistic.  If it was something like 10-15 years I might be less concerned, but five years doesn't sound like a huge amount of time, and shoplifiting is something that might be incompatible with business (depending on the position) - how can I be sure you'd be honest with the business' resources?"

sydney,3dcbit,borderlinebadger,3,Wed Jul 15 05:03:47 2015 UTC,"When you say journey, does it reset at the end of the week? For example, Monday to Thursday pay regular fair using Opal and then Friday, Saturday and Sunday travel is free?"

sydney,3d8tz0,trish1975,3,Tue Jul 14 12:08:55 2015 UTC,"Another side effect of this is that the smokers are concentrated into a more dense location, causing people in those areas to receive more secondhand smoke before.  For example the Jet Cafe at the QVB has set up a smoking area that's near the QVB bus stands A and B.  This means the smoke wafts right over into the area where everyone is waiting.  This was never an issue when smoking was allowed at all of the outdoor seating.  I complained to the building management about this but they said it's all within the rules, as there is no definition of how close smoking is allowed near bus stops.  The law simply says people can't smoke ""at"" a bus stop.  They told me the smoking area is at least 2.5 metres from the bus stop sign which they considered good enough."

sydney,3d6vwy,CaptnYossarian,6,Tue Jul 14 03:05:47 2015 UTC,"Because of Western Sydney voters - Bob Carr made an election promise in 1995 for private travel on the M4 and M5 to be refunded; at the time, it was targeted at the regular commuters who had tolling accounts with the operator, with no cashback for occasional users paying cash or vehicles operated for commercial purposes. No government has proposed seriously removing it since, fearing they'd lose the vote in the west.  Obviously as the M4 is now toll free, that's not a factor, so the M5 remains as the last toll refund motorway in Sydney.  Since the motorway went cashless a year ago, basically everyone travelling on the M5 with a toll tag and a privately registered NSW numberplate gets the toll component from the state government back - minus the GST because that's a federal tax and there's no legal mechanism for NSW to refund federal taxes equitably."
sydney,3d6vwy,Krinos,4,Tue Jul 14 04:15:57 2015 UTC,"Bob Carr made an election promise in 1995 for private travel on the M4 and M5 to be refunded   It was more than this - Bobby Carr promised to get rid of the M4 and M5 tolls altogether.  The promise pretty much won him the election out of opposition by the barest of margins by winning over the Liberal seats at the end of the M4.  After he won the government realised that it wasn't a fiscally viable promise and reneged on it, but later went on to put in this cashback scheme instead to secure the west and south west electorates serviced by the M5/M4.  The government has paid out over a billion dollars so far on this pork barrelling, with more to come because the M5 cashback runs til 2023."
sydney,3d6vwy,CaptnYossarian,2,Tue Jul 14 04:37:37 2015 UTC,"This particular pork barrelling works for me, so as long as I'm a voter, I'll be happy with it.... :P  (self interest at work; I get that it's not necessarily the best spending for the state, but at a cost of $50m/year over the past 20 years, it's not necessarily a headline budget item for a $60bn annual budget, and there would be arguments to be made for productivity and reduced congestion costs from parallel roads that haven't had the money spent when the M4/M5 has been able to cope with personal traffic.)"
sydney,3d6vwy,Krinos,-1,Tue Jul 14 06:24:55 2015 UTC,"While I'm sure its good for you that you personally benefit, it was an otherwise pretty indefensible piece of work.  It was a blatant cash hand out for the benefit of very specific electorates to buy an election or two.  Money that could have otherwise built road or rail was wasted to do so, and there wasn't even any infrastructure built on a nominally transport spend.  And to add a shit cherry to the top of that shit sundae he didn't just use cash from the budget of the day; he saddled future governments with the cash handouts as well, well beyond the terms of the elections he bought.  Pretty dick move for someone who prided himself on being fiscally conservative.  It was extra insulting to someone like myself who lived in the North West at the time - not only did we have to pay for all our own tolls, we didn't even have the option to catch a train.  Instead we got to watch successive Labor governments dick around the NWRL for a few terms in government.  Good times."
sydney,3d6vwy,CaptnYossarian,3,Tue Jul 14 10:16:22 2015 UTC,"Don't get on your high horse about services in the north west suffering - Labor built the T-Way and added the bus services along the M2, along with the first proposal for the NWRL, which could easily be seen as a bigger white elephant than alternatives which would've seen it integrated with the existing heavy rail network.  In the south west, we've had sweet fuck all when it comes to improved public transport since the airport line was built - the ""South west rail link"" is a bullshit stub of a line built to places no one lives and running as a shuttle to Liverpool rather than anywhere useful. Try getting from somewhere like Ingelburn to the CBD or Parramatta in under an hour during peak, whether by public or private transport - and compare to express bus services from the north west.  Yeah the M4/M5 cash back is a bit of pork barrelling - considering its budgetary impact on a $60bn annual state budget, it really isn't the most wasteful way state governments of both persuasions could've spent their money. Everywhere in Sydney has had chronic underinvestment in transport & infrastructure, the North West is by no means a special flower."
sydney,3d6vwy,Krinos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:30:10 2015 UTC,"Firstly the rampant underinvestment in infrastructure makes the pork barrelling in no way less egregious.  That's a bit of sleight of hand to draw attention away from Carr's dirty deed.   In the south west, we've had sweet fuck all when it comes to improved public transport since the airport line was built    He threw free toll money at areas already serviced by heavy rail.  They could have taken that money and built actual, physical infrastructure in any of those areas.  It could have paid for 2 or 3 of the $500 million North West T-Way you think so highly of in those areas (edit or the $350 million Liverpool to Parra T-way, that's in the South West isn't it?).  That would at least have been 'better' pork barrelling.   compare to express bus services from the north west.   I think you're giving the North-West T-way a little too much credit here.  It connects the Hills to Blacktown and Parra, and only indirectly connected to the CBD via the poor, overloaded M2.  The M2 was a private build out, so that means it was paid for with toll money.  That means that whilst some areas were being handed cash to pay for their toll payments, other areas were handing over toll payments to pay for and expand infrastructure."
sydney,3d6vwy,Jackklompus2222,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:48:18 2015 UTC,The thing the north west whingers never seem to understand is that when the pork barrelling' remove the tolls' election promise was made the m2 didnt exist.

The word that great things were happening here in Arts, music, film really made Australia a focus area on the jnternational scene. Duran Duran were a massive group at the time and recorded an album here in 1983, staying at the ritzy York Apartments, for example.   Bowie just made the issue of race relations his focus- nobody else bothered to turn a spotlight on that issue, and that was the unique and quite inspired aspect of the video."

sydney,3d74u8,muddlet,4,Tue Jul 14 04:11:46 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that the most needed part, the inner west bypass, is going to be constructed last, which means in the meantime more traffic on King St."
sydney,3d74u8,trish1975,6,Tue Jul 14 05:11:43 2015 UTC,Stop it with the King St traffic nonsense.  You literally cannot get any more traffic on King St than there already is.  All these people who will supposedly end up on King St... where are they going and where are they coming from?
sydney,3d74u8,Korzic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:39:45 2015 UTC,"Well that's what the government is proposing we do during the time when Stage 2 is finished yet Stage 3 is under construction.  Stage 2 ends at the SE corner of Sydney Park, where the plan is to level a row of houses along Campbell St to increase capacity through to the Princes Highway, and increase capacity along Euston Rd. A significant portion of traffic will still end up getting funnelled through King St because of the limited number of paths traffic has to get out of that area."
sydney,3d74u8,trish1975,4,Tue Jul 14 05:55:21 2015 UTC,"You still haven't identified where this traffic is supposedly going to.

Edit:  Better wording."
sydney,3d74u8,Korzic,3,Tue Jul 14 06:04:37 2015 UTC,I guess the worry is that King St will be turned into a full-time clearway thus allowing more traffic than it can currently take.  This could cause degradation a la Paramatta Rd.  I don't know if this is really in the plans though.
sydney,3d74u8,SilverStar9192,0,Tue Jul 14 07:17:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe if we we serious about it and decentralise the city and stop thinking this is the 80s and businesses need a 2000 post code to be taken seriously people wouldn't need all these roads in to the city? While I'm not against the road from what I've read and some roads (ED and others) are great for bypassing large sections of city to get elsewhere much of the problem is everyone headed in to the CBD.  Public transport is lacking and is poor at best during peak times which start and finish earlier and later than each previous year reaching capacity, then add in changes to public transport like the Chatswood-Macquarie and west line which is going to completely F anyone who relies on that rail line for quite some time. Undoing what had been done to connect people with PT.  Look at the billions spent (taxpayer money) on that project only for us to sell that arm of the network to a partly foreign entity who will rip it all up and segregate that section from the rest of the network.  Makes it hard to take the high road on PT when it ends up like that doesn't it."

sydney,3d74u8,SirQuackington,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:52:51 2015 UTC,and my argument is that instead of building infrastructure for our future and looking towards decentralisation or higher density living we're building a useless road
sydney,3d74u8,muddlet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:55:08 2015 UTC,"These roads still shift lots of people who will use them and don't want to be in the city, how do you think packages get transported? Food makes its way to supermarkets? I'd rather trucks and other vehicles were on these types of roads and bypasses than on the existing network.   The East West link in Melbourne is a great example of a useful bypass that was stopped because of the NIMBYism going on. Sure the cost was huge and should have been much cheaper and is a problem we have in Australia where things go out of control, but still something where planned will be beneficial."
sydney,3d74u8,SirQuackington,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:05:20 2015 UTC,"i disagree. having the extra road may make the in between trip go quicker, but there will be just as much or more congestion at its end points. building a road that encourages more people to drive into the city isn't a good idea imo"
sydney,3d74u8,muddlet,2,Tue Jul 14 10:09:20 2015 UTC,"Not everyone wants to go into the city, many hate it and only do it for work, I know thats my case. I have little to no reason to get to those areas otherwise.  Pretty sure the tens of thousands that do the trek in from Wollongong, Central Coast or Newcastle have similar feelings.   Yes some intake and end points will be busy, more than likely they are already are and this is just hoping to move people quicker.   The Artarmon LCT area is a good example, the traffic years after the tunnels being put in isn't any worse than pre-tunnel from what I've experienced having spent years driving in and out of the area. The roads are still busy but they'd be worse if it wasn't there.   People are getting overly worked up about King St, the fact is there is no perfect solution that will clear the traffic it already has and turn it into this utopia those who live nearby seem to believe it is.  Also if it's stopped for these people who seem to believe this then the next area who are on the cards to have a similar project will create the same fuss, nothing will get built and the cycle continues.  Its part of living in a city that has been cursed with the geography we have and poor urban planning and vision for the future."

But you can probably break it down into a couple of reasons.  1 - We should be spending more on public transport than big new roads because these roads will only ease congestion for a time, before filling to capacity again.  The demographic of the inner west trends towards the left and public transport etc is more their bailiwick  2 - A giant tunnel bypassing them somehow creates more street level traffic.  A large factor to this is that Stage 2 when complete will terminate at Canal Rd before Stage 3 is finished.  3 - Cost benefit.  The numbers on are somewhat sketchy."

sydney,3d74u8,SilverStar9192,3,Tue Jul 14 07:23:07 2015 UTC,"There's little chance of it not being built, I reckon.   Stage 2 of WestConnex relies on Stage 3 being built to be viable, because the plans indicate that there won't be any exits for the new tunnel between St Peters and Bexley until Stage 3 is built. My prediction is that not many people will use it if it's just acting as a large funnel between St Peters and the M5 West. It would be a white elephant on a grand scale if they didn't finish the entire project to plan."

Tunnels put most of this underground.  The stacks mostly contain C02 and certain other gases that would be going into the surrounding environment anyway.  In fact, stacks are better than surface streets since it elevates the gases higher into the atmosphere.

A whole bunch of community workshops and presentations were cancelled in the lead up the last election.  Some reasons:   The funnelling of traffic from the tunnel onto King St Newtown. A busy and vibrant shopping and entertainment area could become clogged with traffic, and then most probably will be made a no parking zone, which will destroy local businesses. Newtown will become like Parramatta Road Annandale, a smog filed dead zone littered with for lease signs.   Filters on exhaust stacks. Does anyone want an unfiltered stack near their house? Filters were placed on the M5 tunnel, and then removed because they cost a lot to run. Paying fair market price for acquired housing.

Really?   most probably will be made a no parking zone, which will destroy local businesses.   It's really strange how local businesses think they will be ""destroyed"" by reduced parking (this came up in the Bondi thread also) - the amount of parking in Newtown is miniscule as it is.  There's no way any business in Newtown right now is dependent on street parking - there is like one carpark for every two businesses.  The traffic comes by train, bus, taxi, foot, bicycle, whatever - the number of cars actually parking and visiting businesses must be tiny.   Newtown will become like Parramatta Road Annandale, a smog filed dead zone littered with for lease signs.   I agree that avoiding this is important.   I don't have an easy answer except completion of the later phase tunnel.   Does anyone want an unfiltered stack near their house? Filters were placed on the M5 tunnel, and then removed because they cost a lot to run.   Try not to take an emotional response to questions like this.  It may be the case that there is no significant environmental or health difference one way or another.  I don't think the argument is all that strong either way at the moment.   I live near the ANZAC Bridge and get a lot of particulate matter on my balcony - this comes from diesel exhaust mostly.  It's not exactly beautiful but the particles are too large a diameter to pose a health risk.  They are simply messy.  It's something that science can answer for us, if we are able to trust it.   My suburb also has the western distributor and the Cross City Tunnel exhaust stack and we haven't all turned into aliens yet.   Paying fair market price for acquired housing. Already home owners around Haberfield are reporting that the govt is offering way below market value   Market value is so inflated right now, that this probably just reflects that the government did their valuations a few months previously :)"

My property is worth about 750k which I can sell when the AUD is strong   You can be very selective about the country to which you will immigrate. Some countries offer investor visas. The United States has the most foreign-born population. The investor visa for the United States is 500,000 USD. The People's Republic of China is the most populated country. The investor visa for the People's Republic of China is 500,000 USD.   Retiring early is not possible in Australia due to the high cost of living..   I think that you have the chance of retiring early, because of the value of your property. I think that 1,000,000 AUD is enough for retiring. I do not know about the cost of living in other countries, so my suggestion will not consider the cost of living.   What countries would you suggest? what about living there permanently?   Here is the list of countries and their respective official languages.   Angola | Portuguese Brazil | Portuguese Colombia | Spanish Costa Rica | Spanish Ethiopia | Amharic, English Guatemala | Spanish Indonesia | Indonesian Kenya | English, Swahili Madagascar | Malagasy, French, English Peru | Spanish Venezuela | Spanish Zimbabwe | English   This is the source for the countries and their respective official languages.

Australia and The People's Republic of China and The United States are added for comparison.   Colombia Australia Costa Rica United States Venezuela Guatemala Peru Kenya People's Republic of China Zimbabwe Madagascar Ethiopia   I will not consider the human development index for all cities, because that is too difficult to compare. Some cities have data for different years. Some cities do not have the data for the human development index. To find the human development index for some cities is difficult.  The choices are Colombia and Costa Rica. Their selected cities are Medellín and San José. Medellín has a higher human development index than San José has, so I suggest that Colombia be chosen for your criteria.  The average body mass index of Colombia and Costa Rica is greater than 25. The body mass index of 25 of greater is overweight. Source.  I think that to have a body mass index of 25 or higher is better for a country than a body mass index of 25 or less, because to eat too much because of much food is a choice but to eat too little because of little food is not a choice."

sydney,3d75rx,trish1975,4,Tue Jul 14 01:24:42 2015 UTC,If I'm not mistaken - More people died at the Quarantine centre and they not only do a really famous ghost tour but you can have events there...  I guess if they did this in 10 years it would be acceptable.
sydney,3d75rx,Cragboar,7,Tue Jul 14 01:34:40 2015 UTC,I can see where the parents/grandparents are coming from. Not so sure that there's anyone still alive who's had direct contact with anyone who died in quarantine. And they weren't gruesomely murdered either.

Regardless, those last two wouldn't have been murdered, or died some horrific death. I'd imagine they would have had proper medical attention as well, or perhaps they died of natural causes.   The ghost tours would relate to the more numerous deaths from previous centuries, from stuff like the plague, and Spanish flu."

A ghost tour a of serial killer is slightly different, for some reason average people are really intrigued by serial killers and cult leaders.  The fact they exist, their lives before and after - what they're like as people - these things interest a large body of normal citizens, why? I have no idea - but we all have the friend that knows a little too much about John Wayne Gesey and Jeffrey Dahmer, not to mention how much people know about Jonestown and Helter Skelter... It's fascination that leads people here, sure the ghost tour is a grim way to phrase it - but pretending that it doesn't interest somebody is silly."

sydney,3d75rx,puppy2010,3,Tue Jul 14 02:23:25 2015 UTC,I don't think it's the same thing. The WTC site is a memorial to the towers and the people who died in the attacks. it has a sombre tone to it and doesn't glorify the attacks or the deaths. This is a morbid murder site tour.

If you ease off the brake at the last second, just a bit, you avoid that large jolt stop. Instead, the bus stops quickly and feels much smoother.  There is a great 178 driver that does it! Havent seen him for a bit though."

I'm not a bus commuter to be honest but I do take the bus from central to town hall sometime due to lack of time. And it's freaking insane! Once the poor driver had to hit the brakes so damn hard we thought we actually hit something, turns out an idiot taxi driver just jumped AND then stopped in front of us!! I mean it was like 2cm between the bus and the taxi!!   Sometimes I'm impartial to buses, but mostly I dislike them coz it's so difficult to rely 100% on them :("
sydney,3d8ci8,bananahead09,2,Tue Jul 14 12:30:02 2015 UTC,"Yes!!  The fucking braking!  The problem is they leave the braek pedal jammed in until the end.  If you ease off it near the end of the stop, you avoid that jerk at the end.  Try it in your car! Break normally but right at the end just ease off a bit. Makes a big difference!  Limo drivers do this."

The private company's advertising just omits this fact, so people who don't bother to check just pay extra."
sydney,3d6pur,SilverStar9192,2,Tue Jul 14 00:57:50 2015 UTC,The one issued directly by RMS is the best because it has the lowest fees.  There's no reason to go with a private company.

Toll amounts on each road are the same no matter who you go with.  You can use any e-tag on any toll roads in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane (no other toll roads in the country)"

sydney,3d6pur,CoolCoolBeans,3,Tue Jul 14 06:25:15 2015 UTC,If you do further research you may hear about other interstate providers which have a lower minimum balance compared to the RMS one (all etags can be used Australia wide). So while you can register and use it here keep in mind that only NSW registered etags are eligible for the M5 cashback scheme
sydney,3d6pur,chewxy,3,Tue Jul 14 01:18:18 2015 UTC,TIL that Roam is not the only company for E-Tags.

sydney,3d6pur,jctfd,3,Tue Jul 14 02:36:33 2015 UTC,I use the Melbourne east link tag. No deposit and no account keeping fee. Costs $30 and includes $30 of credit. All tags are usable around Australia.

sydney,3d6pur,BertRitto,2,Tue Jul 14 01:31:43 2015 UTC,I use e-way (www.tollpay.com.au). The advantage is that they offer the case back incentive (only pay the GST) if you use the M5 for private use.
sydney,3d6pur,SilverStar9192,5,Tue Jul 14 02:46:41 2015 UTC,You can get the M5 cash back regardless of toll provider.
sydney,3d6pur,timmmmb,2,Tue Jul 14 03:14:38 2015 UTC,Bingo. RMS makes M5 cashback simple as can be. Just a few clicks and the non-GST component of all M5 journeys are rebated.

For a proper dicking over I'd need at least three dozen 50 kilotons to hit enough key bridges, railway depos, damns and airfields to my hearts content, but the tool crashed about the time I was making my way down the South Coast - I dropped one on Ottford for reasons that now escape me then the whole thing went tits.  Fun thing is, most damage will actually be caused by the bushfires to follow.  I don't think I'll sleep well tonight."
sydney,3d4d61,princesskate,5,Mon Jul 13 12:47:15 2015 UTC,"It's past 12 and I'm still dropping bombs. This is actually quite fun, I started doing it using ten 1 Megaton devices, basically the Payload of some MIRV ICBMs.  Sydney got four for the airports (two military, Sydney Airport, and a current planned airport out west), one for Port Botany, Warrabamba, Prospect, Central Station and then two major rail depos - excellent spread, end result by my guesstimate is I probably killed about 90% of the population before the fires burned out, overlap was pretty solid. South West was spared (barring fires) and if the wind was blowing west that day, the Northern Beaches survived as well.  With limited knowledge of Melbourne I hit the MCG, Airport, used five devices on what looked like damns/reservoirs, then used the remaining three on Road interchanges for their orbital. Good Spread, MCG one even dicked over the port somewhat, but I should have saved one for Gelong.   Brisvegas got one out at Wivenhoe, two for the airport, one for the port, then I just blanketed the rest over the population center and threw one down on Surfers for good luck.   Radilaide is fucking tiny and hugs the coast, they got a nice straight line to wipe them off the face of the Earth. I gave Port half of the warheads for shits and giggles.  For Canberra, I used one on Parliament, one on the airport, another on a damn, and used the rest to make a smiley face."

He offered me either a Tesla or Audi A8 to drive and heaps of jobs.   Does anyone here have experience or tips in this sector ? My uncle is a HC driver and he loves it.   Edit: spelling
sydney,3d3pft,Wogachino,5,Mon Jul 13 07:39:20 2015 UTC,"He offered me either a Tesla or Audi A8 to drive and heaps of jobs.   Nice.   How many KM/day would you do as a driver? My concern with the Tesla (even though I love 'em) is that you'd be limited to less than 400KM/day (allowing for AC use and rain losses), unless they could install some serious charging infrastructure.    The Schipol Airport taxis are all Teslas, and they clog the Tesla provided charging infrastructure in Amsterdam (because there's ""free"" super-fast charging)"
sydney,3d3pft,willhughes,2,Mon Jul 13 08:02:58 2015 UTC,I asked the same question. They have a charger at their depot and also there are superchargers located at either the Sydney Tesla dealship or at the star casino carpark. He said he never had a problem with the range of the Tesla and gets about 450kms in it.
sydney,3d3pft,Wogachino,3,Mon Jul 13 09:52:02 2015 UTC,"Sydney Tesla dealship or at the star casino carpark   There are, but there's signals from Tesla that they're going to start enforcing the ""it's free for long distance"" aspect, rather than letting people use it for free power all the time.   Having the charger at the depot will help - hopefully when the 3 Phase (80Amp) chargers come out the depot will install those - cuts the charging time roughly in half (~5hrs) vs the 40 Amp one (~10hrs) for a full charge. (Hopefully they included the dual charger option in the car when they ordered it too)"

sydney,3d3pft,Trapasaurus_Rex,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"It takes more energy to move a car in rain... No, really - you almost certainly won't notice it in a petrol car, but electric cars have much less power to work with.   They use fractions of the energy, which is why you can get an electric car that does 500km without looking like a plane wing.  It takes another 10-20% energy to drive in the rain, which translates to 50-100km loss of range. Driving into a headwind also makes a difference too - so cold windy rainy days and you might be looking at 300k range."

sydney,3d3pft,FrenchieSmalls,4,Mon Jul 13 08:35:22 2015 UTC,"Sydney is not unfriendly. Whoever said that lied. Unless of course you are on a train on a wet day, then people can be a little vile...  Hope you will love our fair city!"
sydney,3d3pft,FrenchieSmalls,7,Mon Jul 13 09:54:55 2015 UTC,"I have travelled (and lived) all around the world, and I've found that it's often the case (although not always) that the people who say the most negative things about a given part of the world are those who are actually from there. It's sort of a reverse grass-is-always-greener type of scenario.  More often than not, people who have moved to another part of the world are generally quite positive about those who live there, more so than those who are actually from that place.  In my experience, it's far more likely that people are pleasant and welcoming and helpful than not... anywhere around the world... no real exceptions that I can think of. If you are friendly and welcoming, then others usually want to be friendly and welcoming as well. It may be a naïve view of humanity, but it's what I've come to believe from my experience."
sydney,3d3pft,sloppyrock,3,Mon Jul 13 10:17:21 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, the cat. Anyway I hope it all goes well for you, your wife and the cat. September should be a nice time to arrive."

sydney,3d3pft,FrenchieSmalls,4,Mon Jul 13 08:05:26 2015 UTC,"It was somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but that's good to know."
sydney,3d3pft,sloppyrock,9,Mon Jul 13 08:06:58 2015 UTC,It was somewhat tongue-in-cheek   So that's why you guys talk funny. Good luck!
sydney,3d3pft,FrenchieSmalls,4,Mon Jul 13 08:12:03 2015 UTC,Hehe. Nice.   Thanks!
sydney,3d3pft,blue_horse_shoe,3,Mon Jul 13 08:15:59 2015 UTC,Haa anyone here been an uber driver? I'd like to join up but not sure if it really pays off.
sydney,3d3pft,toon_knight,6,Mon Jul 13 07:51:47 2015 UTC,"I do it. You're pretty much guaranteed $30 an hour if you work at peak times. That's not including taxes. Or fuel. If you want a bit of extra cash to help pay the bills then yea, it's pretty good. But you aren't going to get rich quick from it. I actually enjoy driving people about though, it's fun chatting to new people. I can PM you more info if you need it."
sydney,3d3pft,SilverStar9192,3,Mon Jul 13 10:50:32 2015 UTC,I take it you haven't told your insurance company you are driving for pay?
sydney,3d3pft,willhughes,3,Mon Jul 13 12:34:38 2015 UTC,"Uber Black, Uber Taxi or UberX?  They're all very different.  If you're going UberX, check with your insurer (I assume you have comprehensive?) what that would do to your premium.  They might not cover you for commercial usage of your vehicle."
sydney,3d3pft,blue_horse_shoe,4,Mon Jul 13 08:20:56 2015 UTC,Oh man now im confused.  I currently have comprehensive with NRMA. Any idea on how much more my insurance will go up?
sydney,3d3pft,willhughes,5,Mon Jul 13 08:39:30 2015 UTC,"UberX paint it all as totally easy way to make money, without pointing out that there's a bunch of potholes.   I mention asking your insurer because that's the start of issues. They might be cool with it, they might not be - that's a conversation you need to have with them.  As I understand it, its currently not lawful to drive for UberX the way its set up. You would need to hold a commercial licence, and drive a commercially registered vehicle operated by a commercial operator.  Uber might say they'll all sorts of things, but remember that theyre out to make money, not to be your friend. You can be stuck in all sorts of legal hot water.   I'm not saying do or don't do it - but definitely check the fine print (even the stuff Uber don't mention)"
sydney,3d3pft,puppy2010,3,Mon Jul 13 08:54:02 2015 UTC,without pointing out that there's a bunch of potholes   Pun intended?
sydney,3d3pft,willhughes,3,Mon Jul 13 11:00:38 2015 UTC,Puns make the world go round.
sydney,3d3pft,SilverStar9192,3,Mon Jul 13 11:03:47 2015 UTC,Puns and innuendo ftw
sydney,3d3pft,cantfeelmylegs,3,Mon Jul 13 11:56:31 2015 UTC,"I suspect they will simply say it isn't allowed. They might offer you commercial insurance from another department, but you'd have to show a commercial license and operator certificate (in other words you'd have to be a taxi or HC owner). Insurers don't want anything to do with UberX drivers from what I've heard.   Insurance for actual taxis is many times the cost of non-commercial - I think I saw somewhere on the order of 3x to 5x as much. It's a major cost of running a for-hire vehicle."
sydney,3d3pft,HeadacheCentral,3,Mon Jul 13 09:45:56 2015 UTC,Have a listen to a recent podcast series from Theory of Everything where they got someone to live off nothing but instaserf jobs and document it:  https://toe.prx.org/2015/06/instaserfs-i-of-iii/
sydney,3d3pft,HeadacheCentral,4,Mon Jul 13 11:58:19 2015 UTC,Ugh. 5 am start tomorrow morning. Sometimes I hate being head geek.
sydney,3d3pft,HeadacheCentral,2,Mon Jul 13 09:58:33 2015 UTC,Early kip for you then!

sydney,3d3pft,puppy2010,3,Mon Jul 13 10:39:56 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to figure out if I should move, or stay here.  Pros of staying   Macquarie Park is close to Pennant Hills (where I work) There's a KFC nearby There's a train station just down the road I have NBN After a year and a half, this is home.   Pros of moving   New experience Most likely cheaper Possibly closer to work   Not that distance from is that bad at the moment. Takes me about 30 minutes walking and catching the train. And it's the cheapest train ticket.  I'm currently paying $190 per week, but stuff changes next month.  I can:   Stay here and find new housemates. But my current housemate may have ruined this place for me. Go to a one bedroom, if they'll have me. But that's about $500 per week. Find housemates and go 2 or 3 bedroom, which would be about $300 per week either way. Go to somewhere cheaper and lose my amazing internet. Move with my housemate and lose my fast internet.   Just kidding. Once I'm out of here I'm never talking to them again."
sydney,3d3pft,yl9307,3,Mon Jul 13 10:00:56 2015 UTC,"If you think Pennant Hills will be cheaper,  you're in for a surprise!"
sydney,3d3pft,puppy2010,4,Mon Jul 13 10:29:23 2015 UTC,A KFC nearby would be a reason for me to move!  Not good for the waistline... the ones in the city are too close as it is for me...
sydney,3d3pft,SilverStar9192,4,Mon Jul 13 10:35:44 2015 UTC,Unless there's a Hot Star near his new place!
sydney,3d3pft,alllefty,2,Mon Jul 13 10:51:54 2015 UTC,"Am I missing out on something? What is Hot Star?  Speaking of chicken joints, I giggled when I swear I saw a place called Pyscho Chicken in Roseville"
sydney,3d3pft,WhyYouDoThatStupid,4,Mon Jul 13 11:05:07 2015 UTC,A fried chicken chain originally from Taiwan. Better than KFC imo (even though KFC is still awesome)
sydney,3d3pft,alllefty,3,Mon Jul 13 11:10:01 2015 UTC,I think there is possibly one in Campsie (or did I just imagine that?)  Should try some time.
sydney,3d3pft,WhyYouDoThatStupid,3,Mon Jul 13 11:13:34 2015 UTC,yep one in campsie
sydney,3d3pft,twelveofjune,3,Mon Jul 13 11:26:07 2015 UTC,"Not sure, there's definately one in the CBD though on Bathurst Street."
sydney,3d3pft,sloppyrock,3,Mon Jul 13 11:29:03 2015 UTC,KFC is awesome. Shame my closest one is a bit too far to walk and a bit too short a distance by public transport.
sydney,3d3pft,tirese,2,Mon Jul 13 10:39:24 2015 UTC,a bit too short a distance by public transport   Such a thing is not possible before you've hit your Opal weekly reward!
sydney,3d3pft,alllefty,7,Mon Jul 13 10:45:00 2015 UTC,There is one in Dulwich Hill which requires a short walk then one light rail stop. There is also one about about 3 km away but in a shopping centre.
sydney,3d3pft,sloppyrock,3,Mon Jul 13 10:47:31 2015 UTC,i have to have an idea what i want to do for a mini PIP (personal interest project) for Society and culture by tomorrow. Im Stumped.... Any Ideas. im really accepting anything by now
sydney,3d3pft,HectorMcFreckle,6,Mon Jul 13 07:43:24 2015 UTC,Do social media effects on restaurants. Yelp. Instagram blogs and all that.
sydney,3d3pft,a_slinky,3,Mon Jul 13 08:09:12 2015 UTC,"thats actually pretty cool, i'm writing that down now. thanks"

sydney,3d3pft,a_slinky,5,Mon Jul 13 08:18:26 2015 UTC,"Something to do with the effect social media has on X?   It's probably an overdone thing now, I don't know. I didn't do society and culture :)"
sydney,3d3pft,derrodad,5,Mon Jul 13 07:54:34 2015 UTC,Mini PIP? I thought you just did a PIP and it was like a major work ie 5000 to 7000 words?
sydney,3d3pft,sloppyrock,5,Mon Jul 13 08:11:14 2015 UTC,I think it is a practice PIP for Yr 11.
sydney,3d3pft,sloppyrock,4,Mon Jul 13 08:16:27 2015 UTC,"i'm in year 11, and our teachers sort of just wanna prepare us with some of the first hand techniques and a short synopsis"
sydney,3d3pft,sloppyrock,4,Mon Jul 13 08:15:08 2015 UTC,Ah OK. We get a lot of survey requests here. I have one doing a PIP right now.Big job.
sydney,3d3pft,derrodad,3,Mon Jul 13 08:19:11 2015 UTC,Khao soi for dinner at the pub. Well earned after a lung busting session in the gym. I think i must be getting older.

You can still see them in their back holding yard at the top of Chimp Road and in their stalls at the front of the exhibit 😀"

sydney,3d3pft,walkerreuben,2,Mon Jul 13 11:56:26 2015 UTC,That made me think of a very old song 'Yellow Rose of Texas'. Mitch Miller and Elvis did versions long ago.
sydney,3d3pft,Rougey,3,Mon Jul 13 10:46:34 2015 UTC,I had this rather obscure Ringo Starr song in mind.  Inspired by a yellow rose obtained at the French thing at CQ on Friday. And other rose generating thoughts.
sydney,3d3pft,timmmmb,2,Mon Jul 13 11:02:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, never seen that one. I do have this one somewhere. No rose theme but it is Ringo (trying) to sing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp_HIHxca5I"

All I could think was ""Wow I am in the same room as a Beatle!""  That is actually my favourite Ringo Starr song. Along with It Don't Come Easy."
sydney,3d3pft,timmmmb,2,Mon Jul 13 11:11:20 2015 UTC,It dont come easy. That is a great song.  Watch out for those bohunks with their ju-ju's alight.
